<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Imagine a movie in which Adam Sandler stars as a perpetual underdog with a
speech impediment who dotes on a parent. Despite himself, he acquires a
girlfriend who's a bit of a social reject herself. He finds a purpose in
his life; it involves Sandler getting knocked down a lot. Oh, and Henry
Winkler appears.</P>
<P>Quick, am I describing "The Waterboy" or "Little Nicky"?</P>
<P>Indeed, Sandler's latest comedy effort, "Little Nicky", bears an awful lot
of similarities to his blockbuster "The Waterboy" -- it just has more
special effects and extraneous cameo appearances. The level of humour and
the appeal of the two films are virtually identical. Basically, if you
like Adam Sandler movies, you'll probably like "Little Nicky". Otherwise,
chances are you'll be better off steering clear.</P>
<P>In "Little Nicky", Sandler plays the title character, the third and
youngest son of Satan (Harvey Keitel). Whereas Nicky is timid and loves
his Dad, his brothers -- devious Adrian (Rhys Ifans) and powerful Cassius
(Tom 'Tiny' Lister Jr) -- want nothing more than to supplant their father
as ruler of Hell. When the Devil tells his boys that -- instead of
retiring after 10,000 years like his father before him -- he's going to
stay on for another ten-millennium term, a furious Adrian and Cassius flee
Hades for Earth, freezing the gates of Hell behind them. This prevents the
souls of sinners from entering the realm, and without them, Satan quickly
begins to physically deteriorate.</P>
<P>This means that it's up to Nicky to travel to Earth and convince his 
brothers to go home, before their father disintegrates completely. But
Adrian and Cassius have already begun turning our world into their own
private Hell, beginning with New York (presumably because it was the least
work). They use their demonic powers to possess major public and religious
figures, and have them promote acts of sin and degradation. Nicky teams up
with the awkward Valerie (Patricia Arquette), a talking bulldog named 
Beefy (voiced by Robert Smigel), and a motley crew of other misfits to 
save the day.</P>
<P>"Little Nicky" constitutes a series of wildly uneven gags; some of them
are hilarious, others fall desperately flat, and many just sit there
uncomfortably. It is Adrian's and Cassius' shenanigans which provoke the
biggest laughs -- they cause the legal drinking age to be lowered to ten
years old, for example, and make Regis Philbin talk about committing 
homicide on national television (at least, I think Regis was supposed to
have been possessed; it's been years since I saw "Live With..." so maybe 
he's always like that now). Ifans is particularly delicious as the fey,
machiavellian Adrian, camping up the screen like a latter-day Dr
Frankenfurter.</P>
<P>The other characters, though, are a largely unimpressive lot. Sandler
feels as though he's running in place with Nicky -- the differences
between this character and his past roles, such as Bobby Boucher in "The
Waterboy" and Robbie Hart in "The Wedding Singer", are fairly minimal,
Sandler has shown some capacity for comic range in the past, and he needs
to start demonstrating it as part of his movie career soon. Otherwise, he
risks quickly winding up in the same has-been hell as Paulie Shore and
similar would-be talents. With Nicky, he is playing a character who is
simply too soft and timid to match the caustic tone of the film. Instead
of being the center of attention like a lead actor should be, Sandler
stands on the sidelines for "Little Nicky".</P>
<P>Similarly, characters such as Arquette's Valerie and Nicky's roommate Todd
(Allen Covert) feel out of place and underdeveloped, being mostly the butt
of staid old jokes. Only Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran, who play two
would-be Satanists ("Devil groupies" might be more appropriate), are
particularly funny, and even they get pretty old, pretty fast.</P>
<P>"Little Nicky" is littered with cameo appearances by Sandler's acting
colleagues, particularly ex-"Saturday Night Live" castmembers. Some of
these work well: Jon Lovitz is amusing as an ill-fate peeping tom, and
Reese Witherspoon is enormously charming as a Valley Girl-like angel. But
many of them are just bizarre and off-putting -- consider Dana Carvey as
an evil referee, and especially Quentin Tarantino, who hams up the screen
as a crazy preacher. Even Rodney Dangerfield, who plays Nicky's
grandfather Lucifer, can't mine his brief appearances for laughs of any
kind. By and large, these cameos are just gratuitous and unnecessary, and
detract from the overall flow of the film.</P>
<P>"Little Nicky" basically amounts to a lightweight version of "Dogma", last
year's wonderful Kevin Smith religious comedy. It is a movie which 
certainly has its moments; I admit, I laughed out loud on more than one
occasion. But it is frustratingly uneven, and settles more than a few
times for the sorts of immature, unfunny gags which have become the staple
of major comedies in the past few years. If you're hoping for a devil of a
good movie, look elsewhere: "Little Nicky" is a minor demon at best.</P>
