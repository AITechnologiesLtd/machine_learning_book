<P>   Did Hitler really believe in the Nazi ideology, or did he
simply use his convictions to manipulate the people he
governed?  You won't find the answer by reading "Mein
Kampf," since, after all, the rambling rhetoric of his infamous
book is self-serving.  According to R. Buckingham and Barry
J. Hershey, who have written a difficult new movie "The
Empty Mirror," the answer is both: he was a true believer and
he cleverly exploited his theories to maintain absolute control
over the German people during his reign as chancellor. 
Buckingham and Hershey could have made a talking-heads
documentary, interviewing scores of people in the style of
James Moll's Oscar-winning documentary "The Last Days."
He opts instead for a dramatic monologue backed up by
surreal imagery, actual footage from the film archives of the
1930's and 1940's, stagy dialogue between Hitler and his
chief ministers, and fanciful exchanges between Hitler and
the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. While "The
Empty Mirror" avoids the off-putting, cerebral, and
uncinematic flaws of chronicles like a recent one about Ayn
Rand, it settles for off-putting, cerebral and uncinematic
conversations, ruminations and speculations assisted by the
background drone of film footage, both actual and
resourceful.</P>
<P>   "The Empty Mirror," which was photographed over a period
of just 66 days completely within a claustrophobic set, is the
sort of vehicle that should have been produced on the stage,
the natural medium for extended soliloquies and prolonged,
invented conversations.  The screen is the proper mode for
action.  Using its spacious dimensions for pontifications,
however complemented with imagery, gives the viewer the
impression of squandered space, as though the music-
dramas of Richard Wagner were performed by a single
trumpet.  Nor is the audience about to be animated by the
sort of exchanges launched by advancing warmed-over,
fortune-cookie philosophy.  This two-hour drama, directed in
a heavy-handed manner by Barry J. Hershey, is cumbersome
and tedious as you'd expect from a film dominated by
interminable talk, however gussied up by the director's flights
of fancy.</P>
<P>   Unlike wartime leaders such as Churchill and Roosevelt,
Hitler never produced a volume of memoirs.  His "Mein
Kampf," written during the 1920's while he served a brief
sentence in prison, lets us in on his view of history and the
place he would reserve for himself in its tapestry.  But we're
left in the dark about how he felt when the smoke cleared
and the Russians were advancing on his bunker in 1945.  Did
he have a conscience at all, the slightest tinge of regret about
the untold suffering he caused the world as its greatest mass
murderer?  For most of its playing time, "The Empty Mirror"
takes the view that Hitler regrets only that he got caught. 
Only in its final segment do we gain a more complex insight
into his global perspective.</P>
<P>   Director Hershey keeps his subject on a single set,
designed to represent an underground bunker--or perhaps the
dictator's mind, a dank prison to which he might have been
confined pending his trial, or perhaps a hell in which he must
spend eternity mulling over his deeds.  He is visited by
Sigmund Freud (Peter Michael Goetz), his propagandist Josef
Goebbels (Joel Grey), his right-hand man Hermann Goering
(Glenn Shadix), and his adoring mistress Eva Braun (Camilla
Soeberg).  These callers provide him with a sounding board
for his thoughts which are later dictated to a typist (Doug
McKeon).  Insisting that people want round numbers for the
memoirs they read, he settles on 6 million (rather than 5.7
million) as the number of Jews he had exterminated during
the early 1940's.  Responding to the probing questions of
Freud, he holds that only a poet could touch the edge of his
mystery; only a genius like Richard Wagner could do justice
to his mission of reviving the mythic greatness of the German
Volk.  While re-confirming and broadening ideas brooded
upon in "Mein Kampf" such as his conviction that modern art
is filth that can be traced to a people representing just one
percent of the world's population, he describes his means of
manipulating the public.  "I was born to rule; others love to
obey," he states proudly while contending, "Put a man in
uniform and he will commit acts he never before imagined." 
The national socialist spirit will "make high school dropouts
feel included by stressing only external differences."  Most of
all, he attributes his success to combining Jews and Marxists
into a single great enemy that the masses could hate.</P>
<P>   Hitler babbles on in a stream-of consciousness manner to
his visitors--who include samples of the golden-haired youth
whose patriotism he captured and channeled for his perverted
world view.  Hershey keeps the background occupied with
newsreel clips and dream-like images which come across
largely as busy-work to deflect from the movie's static nature. 
Norman Rodway, a fine British actor in the title role,
resembles Der Fuhrer only superficially with a thick mustache
and a shock of hair that reaches down toward his eyebrows. 
His frequent outbursts, however, appear forced--considering
that he speaks either into a camera or to a guest or two. 
Despite the picture's aim of giving us insights into Hitler's
conscience, Mr. Rodway's ruminations merely mine old
territory, the background clips serving mostly as superfluous
distractions.</P>
