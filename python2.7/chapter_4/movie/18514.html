<PRE>Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 73</PRE>
<P>Every now and then, a film proves to be much better
than its story.  This is the case for "Heaven Knows,
Mr. Allison", which should be a laughable attempt
to combine unlikely romance and war-time heroism.
Instead, the lead characters are both sympathetic
and compelling.  Much credit goes to the well-cast
leads, Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr, and to
John Huston, who directed and co-wrote the script.</P>
<P>The story is set in 1944.  Mitchum is an orphan
and drifter who has finally found a home with
the Marines.  Kerr is a nun-to-be who is one
month away from taking her final vows.  A convoluted
plot contrivance (it takes ten minutes for the
leads to explain it) places both of them alone
together on a remote Pacific island (perhaps its
"The Blue Lagoon"), where, predictably, Mitchum
begins wooing Kerr.  Kerr, who is dependant upon
Mitchum for her survival, is torn between her two
saviors: God and Mitchum.</P>
<P>Their would-be relationship is endangered by the
Japanese, who alternate between occupying and
abandoning the island.  Mitchum steals food from
and sabotages the Japanese, while Kerr hides from
them in a remarkably well-lit cave.  Just when
the settlers (Kerr and Mitchum) are surrounded
by the Indians (the Japanese), the cavalry (the
U.S. Air Force and Navy) comes to the rescue.</P>
<P>But again, the film is much better than the
cynical plot summary would indicate.  Thanks
to the script and performances, Kerr and Mitchum
come across as two ordinary souls developing
a friendship through adversity, rather than
two formula characters in a calculated marketing
attempt to attract both male and female audiences
to the theater.</P>
<P>Deborah Kerr received an Oscar nomination for
Best Actress. The Huston/John Lee Mahin
screenplay (based on the Charles Shaw novel)
was also nominated.</P>
