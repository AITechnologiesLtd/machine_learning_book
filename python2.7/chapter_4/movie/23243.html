<P>   Pen pals have been reduced to a relic thanks to e-mail and
cell phones have made Western Union virtually passe.  There
is yet room, though, for good old-fashioned correspondence
by mail, and 2000 could turn out the year of the longhand
prison notes.  In John Grisham's latest thriller, "The
Brethren," three mischievous ex-judges concoct a scam from
their jail cells involving the writing of love letters to people on
the outside who have advertised their lonely hearts in gay
magazines, only to blackmail them when they get back a
batch of amorous responses.  In "Reindeer Games," thrill-
king John Frankenheimer helms a fast-paced, slyly comic tale
of betrayal which begin with a prison correspondence and 
concludes with a slam-bang series of twists
and turns in no way as surprising as the resolutions in Neil
Jordan's "The Crying Game" or M. Night Shyamalan's "The
Sixth Sense," but I challenge the audience to unravel the
design by mid-point.  </P>
<P>   "Reindeer Games" is unfortunately not a step forward for
Frankenheimer, best known for deeper, more resonant
thrillers like "Seven Days in May" which was, unlike his
current offering, a believable story about a design to
overthrow the government.  Nor can it compare to his
towering "Manchurian Candidate" made thirty-eight years
ago, which featured the strange but plausible experiences of
a decorated Korean War veteran and his mother's
machinations to advance her husband's career.  In fact,
credibility is the one element sorely lacking in this sometimes
convoluted drama, which like so many B-grade tinglers deals
with a bad guy who could have won the day if only he had
blown away the hero at obvious points in the story.</P>
<P>   "Reindeer Games" is a noir project which in former times
would have been filmed in black and white to accent its bleak
character and cynical attitude.  The story opens in a Michigan
prison where Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) has done five years
for car theft and is to be released in two days.  His mind has
been kept active by his cellmate, Nick (James Frain), who
has periodically read him ardent letters from a woman named
Ashley (Charlize Theron) whom he does not know but has
established an epistolary relationship through a magazine ad. 
On the day after Nick is stabbed during a food fight, Rudy's
sentence ends.  When he sees a woman waiting to drive
away with Nick who meets Ashley's description he sees his
opportunity.  Passing himself off as Nick, he establishes a
quick, erotic relationship with her, but when fun in a motel is
broken up by a gang of thugs led by Ashley's brother Gabriel
(Gary Sinese), the group become involved in a complex
scheme to rob a casino on an Indian reservation.  Since Nick
had worked as a security guard there before landing in jail,
the gang considers him the key to the break-in, not believing
Rudy's story that he is not Nick at all but simply an
impersonator.</P>
<P>   Though Ehren Kruger's script cleverly negotiates the twists-
-which begin with Rudy's identity crisis and pile up two-thirds
of the way through the story--the direction is Frankenheimer
lite.  Whereas his "Ronin," a similar tale of double-crosses
which made us wonder who can be trusted--contained some
of the great car chases in movie history (he directed "Grand
Prix," remember)--this time around J.F. throws around all too
many implausible coincidences, casting the thugs as
interchangeable parts with Steppenwolf's eminent Gary Sinise
a one-note, off-the-wall nut.  Moreover unlike performers like
Laurence Olivier, Burt Lancaster, and Robert De Niro whom
Frankenheimer utilized wonderfully in his other works, Ben
Affleck does not work as a noir tough guy but comes across
more like a recent member of the University of Michigan's
Alpha Sigma Rho chapter.</P>
<P>   Even if you're not a big fan of this genre, you can enjoy it
for the gorgeous scenery, and I don't mean the snow-capped
roads of British Colombia where it was filmed.  Charlize
Theron, the hottest actress in Hollywood today, is the one to
watch here (as she is anywhere else that she appears).  Not
exactly the sort who'd correspond with a jailbird while whiling
away the hours sewing until he got released, her performance
as Ashley is the most pleasing part of this popcorn piece.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 104 minutes.  (C) 2000
