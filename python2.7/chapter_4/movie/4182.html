<PRE>                             DEAD PRESIDENTS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Although the movie's story is hardly new, it still is able to
create anger and arouse emotions.  It is about Vietnam  and it is about
the Black situation told with a straightforward inevitability.  We can
see it all coming.</P>
<P>     We have a Black family living in the Bronx, NY in 1968, with
father (James Pickens, Jr.) and mother (Jenifer Lewis), concerned
parents sitting around the kitchen table.  Anthony Curtis (Larenz
Tate), eighteen, is announcing that he will not go to college upon graduation
from high school.  His brother is an attorney.  Anthony says he is
joining the Marines along with his two best friends, Skip, (Chris
Tucker) and Jose (Freddy Rodriguez).  In addition to his family whom he
will be leaving, he also leaves his girl friend, Juanita, (Rose
Jackson).</P>
<P>     In the Marines, he and his friends are sent to Vietnam where they
find themselves placed on reconnaissance patrol, about as dangerous as
missions can get.  While the war pictures are like those we have seen
many times before in other films, it serves to remind us of what it was
like (as much as a movie can do) and also serves to show us how
heroically Anthony performs under fire.  A few months after his arrival
in Vietnam he learns that he has become a father; Juanita has given
birth to a baby girl.</P>
<P>     Fast forward to 1972 and Anthony, with sergeant stripes, returns
home only to find that not only is he not greeted as a hero, but he is
berated for having fought "the White man's war," and that he cannot
even get a job that will support his family.  Black revolutionaries
urge him to join with them but he does not see that as a solution.</P>
<P>     Juanita, meanwhile, keeps harassing him to do something to change
their financial situation.  In desperation, he and friends decide to do
a heist of an armored truck that picks up "dead presidents" at the Post
Office to take to Washington DC for burning.  For those (like me) to
whom the term is new, it refers to the pictures of Washington, Lincoln,
etc. on our paper money. Despite his upbringing he succumbs to the
temptation to turn his life around with this one robbery ... which
it does.</P>
<PRE>     The cast is uniformly excellent.</PRE>
<P>Directed by the fraternal twins, The Hughes Brothers, (Allen and Albert)
from some real life events.</P>
