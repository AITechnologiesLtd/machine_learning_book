<P>If you've ever watched the real-life Westminster Dog Show - and as an
unabashed Dog Person, I have, many times - you'll recognize the dogs
running rampant in BEST IN SHOW.  But as is often the case, the Wacky
Humans owned by those dogs, are the real show...</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Conformation dog shows, in which purebred dogs are judged against the
physical standards of their breeds to vie for the ultimate "best of
show" championship (as opposed to field trials which tests dogs for
their obedience and similar abilities) - and more important, the lengths
that the human "owners" of the dogs go through to get the coveted Blue
Ribbon - are the target of satire in this "mockumentary" revolving
around the fictitious Mayflower Dog Show.</P>
<P>The dogs and their hilarious humans, are:</P>
<P>-Beatrice the neurotic Weimaraner, whose humans are high-strung
  Illinois yuppies Hamilton Swan (Michael Hitchcock) and his wife
  Meg (Parker Posey) - most likely the cause of Beatrice's many
  Issues;
-Winky the scruffy Norwich Terrier, hailing from Fern City, Florida
  and bringing the man-magnet Cookie Fleck (Catherine O'Hara) and her
  two-left-footed salesman  husband Gerry (Eugene Levy), along for
  the show;
-Hubert the laid-back Bloodhound, accompanied by Pinenut,
  North Carolina's own Good Ol' Boy Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest),
  dog fancier and owner of The Fishin' Hole;
-Tyrone the pampered Shih Tzu, cohabitating along with his sister,
  Miss Thang (uh, Miss Agnes) with Tribeca New York gay couple
  Scott "Ice Ice Baby" Donlan (John Michael Higgins) and
  Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean);
-And the prissy Poodle and two-time Mayflower winner, Butch, who
  lives at the Cabot Mansion with young, rich Anna Nicole-esque
  Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge) and her very old, very
  silent husband Leslie Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw), and is being
  Shown at Mayflower by the rather butch in her own right
  Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch).</P>
<PRE>The Upshot:
Dag, this flick was FUNNY!</PRE>
<P>Ok, so I'll say a bit more, but it all just comes back to my first
statement.  I can't remember when I've laughed more at a satire.  BEST
IN SHOW did an excellent job of deflating the craziness surrounding the
bizarre world of conformation dog shows.</P>
<P>The writing and directing were tight, and the human's performances were
spot-on wacky, though Michael McKean's Stefan was the most straight [uh,
no pun intended] of the lot.  Still, I hesitate to point out any of the
actors here, they were all just that good; and the fact that they could
play these caricatures with such straight faces, most def earns my
praise.  Hmmm...actually, I should point out that in addition to the
great bits from all the actors mentioned in "The Story" above, Larry
Miller as Max Bergman, one of Cookie's many ex-boyfriends, Ed Begley Jr.
as the manager of the hotel Taft, and Fred Willard as Mayflower
announcer Buck Laughlin, also had me in stitches.  Miller's
suicide-prevention guy was a straight-up riot; Begley's character had
one of the best lines of the movie (something about rock stars and
toilets; listen for it); and Willard had me rollin' with Buck's
irreverent asides about the dog show, while the hapless dog expert
Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock) tried but failed to keep Buck on-track.</P>
<P>What amazes me most of all is that all the dogs used for this movie,
were real-life show champions - meaning that the real owners either had
a healthy sense of humor about themselves, or had no idea of what they
were getting into.  Either way, it's a delicious irony.</P>
<P>BEST IN SHOW tickled my funny bone in the way that only a mockumentary
about a subject I hold Near And Dear, could.  Whether you're a dog or a
cat person, you should see this flick.   Unless you're a completely
out-there dog or cat person, and can't laugh at yourself.  Don't worry;
the rest of us will laugh at you.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
Reminiscent in tone to RAISING ARIZONA, with more than a passing
resemblance to McKean's mockumentary SPINAL TAP, BEST IN SHOW certainly
was this movie week's Blue Ribbon winner, and ranks right up there with
the year's best flicks.  I don't think I'll ever be able to watch
Westminster the same way again.</P>
<PRE>BEST IN SHOW (rating: greenlight):
Two paws up!</PRE>
