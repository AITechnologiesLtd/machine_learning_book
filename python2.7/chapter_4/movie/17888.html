<P>   "Election" takes place in a high school but is not a
teen flick.  Directed by Alexander Payne and written by
Payne and fellow satirist Jim Taylor, "Election" uses the
setting of a secondary school in Omaha, Nebraska as a
parable of life in America; specifically, about the craving that
Americans have to succeed at all costs and the emptiness
that triumph can bring to people who neglect other aspects of
their lives.  Its creators imply that what really counts are
genuine friendship, true love, and modesty.  As the song
goes, "It's fine to be a genius of course,/ but keep that old
horse before the cart,/ First you've gotta have heart."</P>
<P>   Being the fine satirists that they are, Payne and Taylor--
whose well-cast 1996 film "Citizen Ruth" was also about the
depraved nature of fanaticism--is never didactic.  We do not
feel we are receiving a lesson when we watch this ingenious
piece, which is so well written and wonderfully acted that its
comic moments come across unforced.  You may go away
from this sparkling picture resolved (at least for a day or so)
to take yourself just a trifle less seriously while putting your
ambition in perspective. Given regular reinforcement of other
such films, you may wind up staying around on this earth a
mite longer, enjoying yourself more, and cultivating a more
sensible outlook on your life.  That's quite a return on your
eight dollars, but then, "Election" is not your ordinary
Saturday night at the pictures.</P>
<P>   This is not to say that the country's economy would grind
to a halt if we all absorbed Payne and Taylor's purport.  One
character in the movie, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), does
become successful in gaining the school office that he seeks-
-if only for a day or so--and he achieves his prominence while
holding on to his modesty, his popularity, and his guileless
aw-shucks attitude.  "Election" is a spirited teen-dominated
film that throws spitballs at Americans unlike Paul-- who will
step on everyone in their way to gain power, who rigidly insist
that their hard work signifies the correctness of their vision. 
Director Taylor levels his feature at nothing less than
America's Puritan heritage, at the conviction that celebrity,
riches and power will assure its adherents a place in heaven
among God's elect.</P>
<P>   "Election" centers on two people; Jim McAllister (Matthew
Broderick), a popular social studies teacher in his late thirties
who acts as adviser to student government, and Tracy Flick
(Reese Witherspoon), a junior with an unwholesome impact
on her teacher's life.  There's a Tracy in every high school: in
the movie "Rushmore," her protege would be Max Fischer
(Jason Schwartzman), an overachiever who takes charge of
virtually every extracurricular activity and, with his romantic
pursuit of one of his school's instructors, appraises himself an
adult.  Tracy's is the hand that is always raised while others
in the class are stymied.  Her drive is all-encompassing
enough to seduce her geometry teacher, Dave Novotny (Mark
Harelik), thereby ruining his career.  Her vigor and
aggressiveness have adverse effects on Jim McAllister, who
has been unable to get his wife pregnant and who is
becoming increasingly irritated with his spouse's quirks. 
Though McAllister is smart enough, there are times that we
think young Tracy knows more about him than he is aware of
himself.  Despite his popularity (he has been selected
teacher-of-the-year three times, a school record), Tracy feels
sorry for him: after all, he teaches the same subject year
after year, and what person of reasonable faculties would not
climb the walls after drawing a chalkboard diagram of the
legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government for
the seventy-fifth time?  Tracy's vital sense of life becomes a
malevolent influence on Jim, who will eventually
self-destruct--though in ways far more comical than you
would imagine.</P>
<P>   The story is told with extensive narration, mostly in
flashback, and centers on a school election.  When no-one
dares oppose the willful Tracy, McAllister is determined to
thwart her drive to the top student office.  He recruits a
popular athlete, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), a lad who is none
too bright but who has high regard for McAllister and
reluctantly agrees to run.  The fun swells when Paul's lesbian
sister, Tammy Metzler (Jessica Campbell) enters the race, a
friendless youngster whose popularity soars when she
declares that if elected, she would dismantle student
government permanently so that "we would never have to go
to another stupid election assembly."  Had the film not been
blessed by marvelous leading performances, Ms. Campbell
could have stolen the show.  Without for a moment expressly
intending to be amusing, she brings down the house with her
genuinely felt anarchism, though she can be touching as well
when her love for another young woman goes unrequited.</P>
<P>   Best of all is Reese Witherspoon--at 23 years of age a fast-
rising star currently on the cover of trendy magazines like
TimeOutNY. She knocks out a trenchant performance as a
17-year-old who thinks she has it all but deep in her soul
realizes that she is missing life's most important reward: the
sincere affection of her peers.  Matthew Broderick comes on
wonderfully as well as a kind of Willy Loman. Though unlike
Arthur Miller's creation this Jim McAllister is confident of his
choice of profession, he shares Willy's unawareness of the
kind of man he really is. Throughout the story we are
cognizant of some inner adversary that gnaws at his essence
far more profoundly than the bee which lands on his eyelid
while he is visiting a momentary lover and creates an ugly
bump with its stinger. Because "Election" is so well acted, so
probing, directed with such a laid-back hand by a man with a
perfect sense of comic timing, this movie is right up there
with such terrific accomplishments as Todd Solondz's equally
satiric classics, "Happiness" and "Welcome to the Dollhouse." </P>
