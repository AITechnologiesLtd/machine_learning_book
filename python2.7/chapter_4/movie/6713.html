<PRE>                                   EVITA
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The on-again, off-again history of
          attempts to bring this Webber and Rice musical to
          the screen finally culminates in a spectacular film
          starring Madonna, Antonio Banderas and Jonathan
          Pryce.  By now the music is mostly familiar.  The
          politics are superficially explained, but the
          visuals give the film a great epic feel.  It is
          hard to imagine Madonna will ever have as powerful
          a role or be as good in another film. Rating: high
          +2 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 4 positive, 4 negative, 3 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Eva Peron was dead 26 years before the musical was produced, and
it took nearly as long, 19 more years, for that musical to be filmed.
It is not clear why the film should be made even now or why the people
at Disney thought the American public would be interested in this story
of the attractive, blond, and politically-active wife of a
controversial reformer President who is popular among the poor but
disliked by the rich, the military, and the Right Wing.</P>
<P>     Like the play EVITA, the film opens in 1952 with the announcement
of the death of Eva Peron.  The film then tells in flashback the life
story of Eva, supposedly related by Che (Antonio Banderas).  Che is
every bit as omnipresent here as he was in the musical, but in Alan
Parker's film version he is no longer a research chemist developing an
insecticide, he is now just sort of a one-man voice of public opinion.
(This creates something of a problem with the lyrics of some of the
songs.  They have images of images of dying insects that now seem to
come out of nowhere.)  Eva is the illegitimate daughter of a prosperous
middle class man. Her life is forged in bitterness by her father's
other family refusing to acknowledge her existence or letting her
attend her own father's funeral.  Her being forcibly ejected from the
church is the film's most powerful scene.  At age fifteen, still filled
with venom, she sleeps with popular singer visiting her village.
Seeing this as an opportunity she attaches herself like a lamprey to
the singer forcing him to take her to Buenos Aires. In spite of bad
treatment, she works her way up a human ladder of men, trading her way
up until she allies herself to the powerful and politically ambitious
Colonel Juan Peron (Jonathan Pryce).  Juan unexpectedly finds himself
caught between Eva on one side and the Army and the wealthy of
Argentina on the other.  It is a moot point which side has a greater
loathing of the other.  But "Little Eva" brings with her an
overwhelming payload of political support from the Descamisados--the
poor, "shirtless" workers and Juan rides their support to the
Presidency--a very stormy trip.</P>
<P>     Madonna Louise Ciccone has not had a very distinguished acting
career up to this point but finally seems cast perfectly in a role.
Madonna not only resembles Eva Person, both have notoriety for a
somewhat salacious background.  The biggest drawback to casting Madonna
in the role is that she is 38--five years older than Eva Peron was even
at her death--and the days are long past when Madonna could reasonably
play the fifteen-year-old Eva.  Antonio Banderas is transformed from
chemist into a sort of narrator and Greek chorus and that causes some
problems with his character.  It is not clear what his point of view
means or if it is even consistent.  When Che was envisioned as a real
human, he could change his mind about Eva without it being a story
problem.  But can a narrator or a chorus change his mind in the course
of a story?  It is not usually done.  Ironically the Banderas character
has far more lines than does the much more literal character of Pryce.
Through much of the film Pryce has only to look good.  I was surprised
when Pryce speaks toward the middle of the film and I realized that we
have not heard his voice in quite a while.</P>
<P>     EVITA looks like a very expensive production and Parker has used
his budget very cleverly in some cases to make a film that looks
extremely extravagant.  In some cases it appears he had a whole scene
setup with a crowd on the screen only for the length of one line of a
song.  In fact there are some clever reuses of settings which may or
may not be disguised to offset the cost.  Part of the spectacle was
made possible undoubtedly only because of the comparative low cost of
filming in Argentina and Hungary.  The two sets of scenes flow together
seamlessly.  We get to see some impressively-scaled political rallies
or major street riots. Camerawork is by Darius Khondji who previously
filmed DELICATESSEN, SE7EN, and the amazing CITY OF LOST CHILDREN.  His
camera is at its most impressive in the long-shots.  Too often on the
close-ups are plagued by bad synchronization between the singing and
the lip movements.  Some images go by often too quickly to be
completely understood, including what looks like a sort of surrealistic
ballroom dance on the occasion of the death of Eva.  Webber's and Tim
Rice's play gives us only a superficial view of Peronist politics, but
then one does not expect an operetta to have the historical content of
a GETTYSBURG.  We never really see much of Eva Peron's politics beyond
her allying herself to the Descamisados and avenging herself against
the middle classes.  Andrew Lloyd Webber apparently could not resist
the opportunity to write one new song eligible for the Academy Award
race.  That song is "You Must Love Me," and it you want to hear it you
must listen carefully.  It is such a bland and lackluster piece of
music it can slip right by the viewer unnoticed.  It sounds more like a
bridging piece of music than a song of the caliber of "Don't Cry For
Me, Argentina."</P>
<P>     As a history film, EVITA is limited by the perfunctory musical
script on which it is based, but the look of the film is dazzling.  I
rate the film a high +2 the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
