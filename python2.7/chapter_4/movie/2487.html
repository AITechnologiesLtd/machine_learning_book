<PRE>                                 THE PAPER
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     In THE PAPER Michael Keaton is the assistant managing editor of a
tabloid newspaper in New York City.  He relentlessly pursues truth in
the face of opposition from his wife (Marisa Tomei), who is 8-1/2
months pregnant and doesn't want him to work so hard, and the managing
editor (Glenn Close) who wants to maintain control over the paper and
doesn't like being shown up.  Naturally, all this leads to a huge
dust-up over Truth.  Does Keaton win?  You'll have to see the film (or
practically any other film based on the legend of the Fisher King) to
find out.</P>
<P>     The depiction of life in a newspaper room is very realistic and
compelling.  It has just about the right amount of tension and disorder
that you'd expect, with conflicting personalities playing a major
role.  This is the most entertaining part of the film.</P>
<P>     On the downside, there is an artificial juxtaposition of three or
four subplots leading up to the big tension-filled climax of the film.
It's just not credible that so many things would happen all at once.
Since the film aims for accuracy, this silly device diminishes the
whole thing.</P>
<P>     Michael Keaton is very good, if familiar.  All this Type A
frenetic wise cracking is beginning to wear a little thin.  I would
like to see him stretch himself a little (though I suppose BATMAN
qualifies.)  Marisa Tomei plays her role successfully, but she should
be trying something more demanding.  After her Oscar last year she
should be taking the lead in a film that does not require her to act
like a up-from-lower class New Yorker, or she is going to get type
cast.</P>
<P>     I found Glenn Close's performance to be the most satisfying of the
major characters.  She is right on the edge, heading over the hill,
threatened by Keaton, a cold and distant woman who has no one to fall
back on when things start to go wrong.  The part is a little too small
to earn her an Oscar nomination, but she is clearly an actress at the
peak of her abilities.</P>
<P>     Robert Duvall is very nice as the editor of the paper.  I really
enjoy watching him play these gentle fatherly roles.  I don't think the
part is well-written--the interaction with his daughter seems very
cliche--but he's still fun to watch.</P>
<P>     Randy Quaid has a nice small role, and Spalding Gray has fun as
the guy at the New York Times who tries to hire Keaton away from his
tabloid.  It's always nice to see Mr. Gray in a movie, and to think
about his working this experience into one of his monologues.</P>
