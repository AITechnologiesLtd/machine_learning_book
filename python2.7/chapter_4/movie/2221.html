<P>     ROBOCOP 3 is merely a run-of-the-mill superhero movie, complete
with comic-book type villains and a plot of limited scope and even more
restricted appeal.  It's the good guys versus the bad guys in a time-
honored tradition.  There's a lot of firepower, numerous explosions,
and a few amazing new gadgets for the superhero to put to use.
All-in-all, it's pretty routine, and that's a big disappointment.  For
those hoping that the third entry in the series would bring things back
around to the level of the first, 'tis not to be.  At least, however,
we're spared another plodding and pointlessly violent adventure like
ROBOCOP 2.  This one has a little life; rigor mortis has not quite set
in.</P>
<P>     Detroit is still a war zone, but this time it's an elite element
of the police force--the "Rehabilitators" against a group of
terrorists who are, in reality, citizens fighting for the right to stay
in their homes.  When Robocop (Robert John Burke) enters the fray, he
does so not on the side of the OCP forces, but on the side of the
downtrodden--which means he's fighting the police.  Not surprisingly,
a warrant is issued for his arrest, but the Japanese powers behind the
Rehabilitators aren't taking any chances, and send an elite Ninja
warrior (Bruce Locke) after the half-man, half-machine police officer.</P>
<P>     The great thing about the original ROBOCOP (directed by a
pre-BASIC INSTINCT Paul Verhoven) was a tongue-in-cheek attitude
coupled with an indefatigable wit.  There was action, to be sure, but
the script was clever, and it made the old superhero formula seem
fresh.  Alas, with ROBOCOP 2, little of that freshness remained, and we
got what amounted to a senselessly-violent rehash of the first.  The
satire was tired and the action pedestrian.  Now, along comes ROBOCOP 3
and, while it doesn't breathe new life into the series, it at least
offers something moderately more diverting than its immediate
predecessor.  Even though there's nothing extraordinary about the plot,
it has a few moments that almost make us forget that the film makers
are beating the proverbial dead horse.</P>
<P>     ROBOCOP 3 goes for straight action, allowing brief instances only
of the facetiousness which made the initial installment so enjoyable.
There's one instance where a crook makes the foolish mistake of trying
to rob a donut shop.  On another occasion, we see just how much
punishment a solid American car can take and still keep running.
Coupled with a few random one-liners, that's about all the humor that
this picture has to offer.</P>
<P>     Peter Weller chose not to reprise his role in ROBOCOP 3, but he
isn't really missed.  Robert John Burke does a passable job as the
cyborg officer, and bears a resemblance to Weller with the mask off.
Great acting skills certainly aren't required for the part, and there's
nothing about Burke that would cause anyone but a relative to lament
the change in lead actor.</P>
<P>     Almost all the surviving characters from the first two films are
back, so there's a nice sense of continuity.  The murky politics of who
controls the police gets even more confusing in this movie, but that
becomes moot by the final battle.  Murphy's search for his lost family
is reduced to an almost-nonexistent subplot.</P>
<P>     One of the biggest improvements from ROBOCOP 2 is the music
score.  In the last film, Leonard Rosenman created one of the
least-inspired action film soundtracks of all time--music that was a
bastardization of his own feeble STAR TREK IV work.  For this movie,
Basil Poledouris has given us an overblown, pompous score totally in
keeping with the nature of superhero action movies.</P>
<P>     I'd like to make mention of the special effects.  While most of
them are okay, there are some scenes featuring an airborne Robocop that
are absolutely laughable.  Hasn't someone come up with a way to make
flying look better than the horrible sequences when Christopher Reeve
donned the Superman cloak?  Judging from this movie, the answer would
have to be "no."</P>
<P>     Orion's financial problems delayed the release of this film for so
long that its arrival is distinctly anticlimactic.  People will wait a
long time for a special movie, but that's a description that doesn't
fit ROBOCOP 3.  Since it's hard to imagine conditions under which the
series will be granted a further entry, this particular superhero may
have flown off into the sunset.  Too bad it wasn't in a cinematic blaze
of glory.</P>
