<P>Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Adam Arkin
1 1/2 stars out of 4</P>
<P> Twenty years ago Halloween was a groundbreaker, an intense, scary,
shockfest that held you breathless from start to finish.</P>
<P>  It introduced most of the modus operendi of what became known as the
"slasher" film; linking sexual promiscuity, especially that of teen-age
girls, to death; the jump-into-frame bump; the unstoppable killer.</P>
<P> Without Halloween, they'd be no Jasons and no Freddie Kruegers. I will
leave it to the sociologists to determine whether that is a good or bad
thing.</P>
<P> Kevin Williamson, the writer of Scream and Scream 2, was profoundly
influenced by Halloween. It's obvious in his works.</P>
<P> Now, he serves as executive producer of Halloween H2O: 20 Years Later, a
cumbersome title for a cumbersome movie.</P>
<P> Williamson probably meant this film as a tribute to a work that set him on
his career course. Unfortunately, his writers and director have done a hack
job with this latest incarnation in the deadly exploits of Michael Myers.</P>
<P> Ignorning all the sequels that came after Halloween 2, H2O's story picks
up 20 years after that infamous Halloween night back in Illinois in which
Michael massacred half the teen-age population.</P>
<P> His sister, Laurie Strode, has changed her name to Keri Tate and is
headmistress at a private school in northern California. Reprising her role
as Laurie is Jamie Lee Curtis.</P>
<P> Her Laurie/Keri is a single mom, a closet alcoholic beset by nightmares
about Michael coming after her.</P>
<P> And so he does. No explanation is given for where Michael came from or how
he even knew how to begin to look for his long-lost sister.</P>
<P> But before you can say butcher knife, Michael has murdered his way to
California and is making plans to skewer Laurie and anyone else within his
grasp.</P>
<P>  H2O is a pale imitation of the original. But, to be fair, this is not so
much the fault of the filmmakers, as it is with the changing times.</P>
<P>  So many films has copied and ripped off the original Halloween formula
that instead of being one step behind the filmmaker, as in the original,
the audience is one step ahead.</P>
<P>  Yes H2O offers some frights. It has its share of people jumping out of
corners into into the frame, red-herring screeching music that sets the
audience on edge, but signifies nothing. Yet it is now so familiar, so
predictable that it elicits laughs instead of screams.</P>
<P>  H2O may be meant as a homage, but nearly comes off as parody, especially
in the over-the-top finale.</P>
<P>  Curtis is too good an actress to allow the weak material to underwhelm
her. She makes Laurie/Keri's fears palatable. She does not condescend to
the material. It's a shame the script never is able to reach her artistic
level.</P>
<P>  The rest of the cast is merely there to be victims. Adam Arkin really has
nothing to do as the school's counselor, who also happens to be Laurie's
lover.</P>
<P>  Only LL Cool J as the school's romance-writing security guard offers some
originality.</P>
<P>  Other Halloween H2O is merely just another cliched entry into the
overstuffed trunk of slasher films. And it's a sad commentary on the
audience that we can laugh at all these gruesome proceedings without
feeling a bit of pity or empathy for the plight of those Michael is
stalking.</P>
<P> The vast number of these movies have so overwhelmed our senses that we
have become immune to any normal reaction - except perhaps to keep a body
count.</P>
