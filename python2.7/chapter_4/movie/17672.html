<P>Filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a
dull, dreary, and overused idea. Doug Liman (SWINGERS), director of the
ultra-hip and severely dark comedy GO, is an example of just such a
filmmaker. In his latest, he gives the viewers a raucous, neon-lit
backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested
path of misadventure as director. But he fails to come up with any
parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect
with the audience on any level, bringing the worth of his efforts to nil
and the value of GO to about the same. </P>
<P>His movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from
multiple (three) points of view, much as an author might write a serial
novel. Consistent with this ethic, Liman and screenwriter John August
provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and
insert brief connections to other narratives. The thread that laces the
three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter. In
story A we have checkout clerk Ronna (Sarah Polley) looking to score
some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it; in story B we
have regular drug dealer Simon (Desmond Askew) gone to Las Vegas giving
Ronna her opportunity; and in story C we have gay soap actors Zack (Jay
Mohr) and Adam (Scott Wolf) working undercover for the police to bust
said drug deal. </P>
<P>Neither of the three stories have much substance, and the movie has the
feel of a campfire story (albeit a rather strange one) that could be
told in five to ten minutes. (In fact, the movie was originally a short
film entitled X expanded to feature length.) The early April release
date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie's Christmas setting, and
the Los Angeles/Las Vegas nightlife is something too far from the
mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to. The
characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite, and performances
from little-known players like Polley, Askew, and Taye Diggs don't help
or hurt the roles. In fact, even bigger names like Mohr, Wolf, and Katie
Holmes don't have enough time to make substantial success. </P>
<P>Although that's almost expected for lack of continuous screen time, the
success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories.
GO doesn't have this, and it suffers because of it. As far as teen
movies are concerned, GO represents the absolute bottom, for its
constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without
some sort of common theme. (The following do not count as common themes:
drug deals, people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug
dealers, people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives, or people
not involved in drug deals stumbling into them.) At times, the humor in
GO is sickly funny, and on a low night, almost watchable; but for the
majority of its running time and for most viewers, this movie will best
be left to teens at Blockbuster on a Saturday night. </P>
