<P>     A wronged man.  A femme fatale.  A body.  A deception.  Avarice 
and alcohol.  Sweat, sex, cigarettes and shadows.  These are the little
things of which the contemporary film noir mystery is made, so predictably
that the genre has descended into the kind of ridiculous self-parody of
which direct-to-video Mickey Rourke vehicles are made.  With too many
film-makers content to keep re-making DOUBLE INDEMNITY and BODY HEAT,
there doesn't seem to be anywhere to go but subversion.</P>
<P>     For a while, that looks like where PALMETTO is headed.  The
obligatory sucker is a former reporter named Harry Barber (Woody
Harrelson) who has learned the hard way that honesty is not necessarily
the best policy.  After threatening to expose corrupt government
officials and refusing to accept hush money, Harry found himself framed,
convicted and sitting in jail for two years.  Now released and
understandably bitter, Harry becomes the perfect target for Rhea Malroux
(Elisabeth Shue), the trophy wife of an ailing millionaire.  Rhea invites
Harry to participate in a scam to fake the kidnapping of Malroux's teenage
daughter Odette (Chloe Sevigny) and share in a $500,000 ransom.  Harry
finds the offer too tempting to pass up, but the deal begins to sour when
bodies start turning up at inconvenient times, with a trail that keeps
pointing directly at Harry.</P>
<P>     Standard noir stuff, to be sure, tag-teaming with a sultry South
Florida setting to create some major deja vu.  Then screenwriter E. Max
Frye (working from James Hadley Chase's novel "Just Another Sucker") pulls
out some of the expectation-twisting tricks he showed off in his script
for Jonathan Demme's SOMETHING WILD.  The oddball touches start popping up
with regularity:  Harry lighting a cigarette which flares up in his face;
Harry running face first into a post; Harry fumbing with a tape recorder
as he tries to catch his accomplices scheming; Harry "seducing" Rhea with 
all the romantic subtlety of a stud horse.  Suddenly PALMETTO seems to be
coming from a slightly different place, one where the protagonist isn't
just an ordinary guy led into a bad situation by his zipper.  Harry
appears to be hopelessly inept, portrayed by Harrelson with his impressive
gift for convincing ineptitude.</P>
<P>     Sadly, PALMETTO soon veers from goofiness to predictable
over-complexity to twisty-turny absurdity.  The plot twists become ever
more elaborate and ever more unnecessary, burying a few sturdy sequences
like Harry's efforts to keep a cop from spotting a body in his car's
trunk.  Since there's never any real attempt to establish the
relationships, it's hard to care much about how Harry will explain his
actions to his artist girlfriend Nina (Gina Gershon), or what exactly
Harry might learn from his ordeal.  Finally, the whole film goes
completely mental in a finale which finds Harrelson suspended over a vat
of acid, Gershon tied to a chair and Shue vamping around in a black
pixie-cut wig.  I half expected the story to be concluded next week, same
Bat-time, same Bat-channel.</P>
<P>     I suppose at the very least PALMETTO succeeds at avoiding the film
noir rut where only the names change from one film to the next.  It's just
bizarre enough that it might have been entertaining, if only it made an
ounce of sense.  Credit Harrelson and Frye with providing a brief, faint
hope that noir might have a few more miles left in it, provided somebody
remembers to bring along a steering wheel.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 sweaty palms:  5.</PRE>
