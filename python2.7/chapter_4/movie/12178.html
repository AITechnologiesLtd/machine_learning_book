<PRE>U.S MARSHALS
A review by David Wilcock (C)1998</PRE>
<PRE>(WARNER BROTHERS)
RUNNING TIME: 2 HOURS 13 MINUTES
STARRING TOMMY LEE JONES, WESLEY SNIPES AND ROBERT DOWNEY JNR.
DIRECTED BY STUART BAIRD.</PRE>
<P>The sequel to The Fugitive (1993), U.S Marshals is an average thriller using
it's association with The Fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks.
Tommy Lee Jones returns to his role as Chief Deputy Samuel Gerard, the
grizzly cop who was after Harrison Ford in The Fugitive. This time, he's
after fugitive Mark Sheridan (Snipes) who the police think killed two FBI
agents, but of course he's been set up, and when the police  plane escort he
(and Gerard) are riding crashes, he makes a run for it, Gerard not so hot on
his tail. What follows is about 2 hours of action, brought to us by the
director of Executive Decision (1995), another film curiously involving a
plane.
When comparing  this movie to The Fugitive, the prequel is far superior. But
even on it's own, U.S Marshals is a pretty lousy movie. While the original
was reasonably intelligent, and had a fugitive to root for, the audience
feels strangely distanced from Snipes fugitive, mainly because we know so
little about him until way into the film's overlong running time. While The
Fugitive gave a little time to develop Harrison Fords character, U.S
Marshals is straight in there, pulling it's trump card (the place crash)
almost immediately. To be honest, I couldn't care less if Snipe's character
got captured or not. Snipes performance is average, and his character gets
surprisingly little screen time (considering he is the fugitive) for reasons
I'll explain later. Tommy Lee Jones is as fine as ever, although his role is
hardly a challenge. The sense of deja vu was overwhelming. I know it's the
same role from The Fugitive, but there is seemingly no attempt to develop
his character from the last film. There's a few 'nudge nudge' references
from the first film, but apart from that, nothing. Nobody even mentions
Harrison Ford in this movie. Downey Jnr is OK as FBI agent John Royce who's
roped into the chase, and sexy french actress Irene Jacob wanders in and out
of the movie as Snipes wife. Nobody looks as if their having a good time,
and all the performers are on autopilot. The supporting cast are O.K, but
when it comes to performances, U.S Marshals falls flat on it's face.
It doesn't fare any better plot-wise, either. The film starts off with
Gerard trying to capture Snipes, but then veers off into terrorists
territory. As said above, the film is an normal, average terrorist thriller,
seen a million times before, but is using The Fugitive reputation to make it
sound more professional. If this film wasn't the 'sequel' to The Fugitive,
this would probably go straight to video, or not even been made at all,
because it's so average. And because of the film's plot changing it's
course, Snipes is almost forgotten apart, and hardly features in the movie.
Stuart Baird, the director, is all right, but there's no particular scene
that stands out. It's director is the usual action movie style. Even the
plane crash is sorely lacking in tension. The special effects are nice,
especially the plane crash, and there's a good (if very loud) soundtrack by
veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith.
But in the end, U.S Marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of
excitement. Sure, it's loud and dumb, but in the end U.S Marshals just ain't
fun. Bored performers and a lackluster plot and script, do not make a good
action movie.
OVERALL RATING=  ** OUT OF  *****
