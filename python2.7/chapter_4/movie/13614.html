A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Steven Spielberg</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Robert Rodat</PRE>
<P>Starring: Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Jeremy Davies, Matt
Damon</P>
<P>Ingredients: Philosophy, World War II, humans trapped in carnage, rescue
mission, cowering, crying, killing</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
At the bottom of Nature's food chain, population in prey animals is kept
in check by predators. But among the top creatures there are no higher
predators. Often the top creatures themselves - - whether they be lions
or wolves or primitive humans - - keep their numbers low mainly through
vicious regionalism and territorial resource competition, using crude
weapons such as teeth and claws, or spears and arrows. The setting of
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is World War II, an era in history when Germany's
(and Japan's) "Manifest Destiny" included resource expansion and racial
exclusion on an immense scale involving advanced 20th century weaponry
and populations of millions, resulting in continuous, gruesome carnage
and psychological denial.</P>
<P>Among the countries resisting Germany and Japan was the United States,
at that time an economic heavyweight and regional power, but militarily
inadequate compared to the great powers. For example, Japan had the
world's most powerful and technologically advanced navy at the time of
Pearl Harbor. As a result of the United States' relative inexperience, a
situation occurred where ordinary American men such as kindly
schoolteachers and terrified, fresh-faced kids (today some would be
below the legal drinking age) found themselves responsible for
penetrating hostile territory to battle killing machines in an attempt
to stem the tide of Nazi expansion. Many combatants made the ultimate
sacrifice, dying like flies in a hailstorm. </P>
<P>In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is not a
professional soldier; he is more likely to read Emerson than to pack a
machine gun. But because it is wartime, Miller and a small squad of men
are unfortunately given an unwise suicidal mission behind enemy lines to
locate a lost but relatively unimportant soldier named Private James
Ryan (Matt Damon) and return Ryan to safety. Although the men question
and resist their mission, they eventually decide it is the only way
they'll ever be allowed to return home from the War, and so they
courageously do their duty. Finding and rescuing Ryan becomes a kind of
Holy Grail, symbolizing the desire of every man to protect innocent,
ordinary life from the brutality of war, even if the heroes themselves
risk being consumed, body and personality, by warfare.  </P>
<P>Opinion:
You can always tell a four-star movie because when the audience comes
out of the theater after seeing it, they look a little dazed, as if in
their minds some part of the movie is still playing. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
is one such movie.</P>
<P>Most of us live pleasant lives of convenience, unmindful of gritty,
value-laden, life -and-death decisions that others have to make. We go
down to the grocery store refrigerator and select meat for our
consumption, our minds far removed from the physical act of having to
butcher the food ourselves. From plush, comfortable couches some of us
can push buttons that enable long range bombs to fly far away, and go
down the chimney to incinerate a cartoonish villain, or demolish an
electrical power plant in a rogue state. Or we may clap our hands when
we see it on TV. Like watching a video game.</P>
<P>But the exact same executions would have an entirely different effect on
us if we had to do them face to face. For example, what if we had to
stab and kill thirteen-year-old enemy soldiers ourselves instead of by
push-button? What if we had to live in the same building with civilian
families dying from lack of water, and eating rotten, non-refrigerated,
food as a result of the local electrical power plant being bombed? Or
suppose we were responsible for deciding from among our friends and
family, which member must die in a hail of gunfire in order to take out
an enemy station. In that case things wouldn't be so easy. Life would
take on a gritty texture. We'd be forced to clarify our values, who we
are, and what we stand for.</P>
<P>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN explores this idea. Ordinary men are sent into a
situation of utter carnage - - not to swagger and easily save the
universe as per usual summer blockbuster - -  but so that the film may
allow us to vicariously examine how Joe Everyman might feel in a FUBAR
situation such as the war our grandfathers faced half a century ago, a
war which we may yet fight again, if vigilance falters and human
inattention allows history to repeat itself.</P>
<P>Behind the scenes, somebody, somewhere is responsible for slaughtering
the food animal; somebody does engage the enemy; somebody does make
courageous, forgotten sacrifices in defense and nurturance of the common
good. The "dirty work" happens in history and every day behind the
sanitized curtains of our convenience in order to make possible our
pampered and privileged lifestyles. Accustomed to free entertainment,
facilities, and civil liberties, we only rarely ponder - - as the
characters do in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN - - the politically incorrect and
often disturbing concept of sacrifice.</P>
<P>While watching the movie inside the theater I noticed a father consoling
a teenage boy who had covered his face with his shirt because he could
not stomach the frightening, gut-wrenching visual detail of the war
scenes (bleached colors and on-foot camerawork along with periods of
deafness and slow motion make the audience feel as if it is partaking in
the mayhem). It is a tribute to Spielberg, his cast, and crew that
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN successfully captures the realism and emotion of
war. </P>
<P>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a classic that is easily as good if not better
than the best previous movies of Tom Hanks or Steven Spielberg. </P>
