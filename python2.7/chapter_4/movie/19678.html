<PRE>_Deep_Blue_Sea_ (R) *** 1/2</PRE>

<P>In this most uncommonly eclectic summer of films--which has offered just
about everything from record-shattering space epics to potty-mouthed
animated kids--it's ironic that the one thing that has been missing is
_the_ typical summertime staple: the all-out, full-throttle action
extravaganza.  Leave it to popcorn director extraordinaire Renny Harlin
to fill the void in explosive fashion with his exciting super-shark
thriller _Deep_Blue_Sea_.</P>
<P>The killer shark theme of _Deep_Blue_Sea_ will inevitably (and
understandably) invite comparison to _Jaws_.  However, Harlin's film is
more reminiscent of the _Alien_ films, with a group of people trapped in
a confined space as murderous monsters stalk the halls: in this case,
three sharks that have large, genetically-altered brains--and a larger
appetite for blood to match.  If one must describe _Deep_Blue_Sea_ in
terms of other films, the best way to do so would be as "_Aliens_ meets
_Jaws_ meets _The_Abyss_," for the sea laboratory setting also means that
our human cast must also evade, as in that third film, violent rushes of
water.</P>
<P>If I said there weren't much more going on in _Deep_Blue_Sea_ aside from
sharks chasing people, I'd only be half lying.  There is a plot behind
the mayhem; something about how the enhanced sharks are part of scientist
Susan McAlester's (Saffron Burrows) experiments in developing a way to
regenerate human brain tissue.  But all plot pretty much goes out the
window once the first of her three test sharks breaks loose, setting off
a chain reaction of events that traps Susan and five others (played by
Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J, Thomas Jane, Michael Rapaport, and
Jacqueline McKenzie) aboard the lab facility, which floats somewhere in
the ocean.</P>
<P>Of course, Harlin does take a break here and there from the ensuing
action in the interest of plot.  In theory, this would make this thrill
ride a bit more well-rounded, but the dialogue scenes play as excess
baggage--and often of the most ludicrous variety.  Many of the quieter
moments were met with derisive laughter by the audience, and it's no
surprise considering how laughable much of writers Duncan Kennedy, Donna
Powers, and Wayne Powers's dialogue is.  The characters (and actors) are
pretty much faceless mice placed into an experimental maze, and the
heavyhanded "dramatic" moments meant to correct the situation just end up
hurting the film.</P>
<P>Despite the hamfisted stabs at dramatic substance, Harlin never loses
his wicked sense of fun, best exemplified by how one character's
earnestly over-the-top monologue is punctuated by the fatal chomp of a
shark.  Fun is the intent of pictures such as _Deep_Blue_Sea_, and Harlin
delivers the goods, as he has many times in the past (most recently in
the underrated 1996 machisma-fueled shoot-'em-up
_The_Long_Kiss_Goodnight_).  Those breath-catching pauses for talk do not
derail the propulsive momentum of the film, which is essentially one long
run from the water and sharks.  There may be no emotional attachment to
any of the characters (though LL Cool J's wisecracking chef proved to be
an audience favorite, and indie stalwart Jane ably holds down the action
hero role), but the suspense and fright factor are definitely felt as
they are hunted down by the trio of sharks.</P>
<P>_Deep_Blue_Sea_ is indeed a triumph of Harlin's style over a lack of
substance, but when the results are as exciting and exhilarating as this
fast-paced thrill ride, any such complaint is moot.  After all, what more
can anyone ask from an unpretentious piece of pure action escapism?</P>
<P>On the other hand, "exciting" and "exhilarating" aren't the words I'd
use to describe the season's other "killer creature in the water" movie,
_Lake_Placid_.  "Bizarre" is more like it.  I hesitate to call Steve
Miner's film, in which a giant crocodile gobbles up anyone who sets foot
in a still Maine lake either a thriller or a comedy, and not because it
fairly seamlessly blends both of those genres.  It's that it doesn't do
either aspect much justice.  The "scare" sequences fail to do so,
especially due to the less-than-effective croc effects; and the humorous
touches thrown in by writer David E. Kelley--yes, the same David E.
Kelley responsible for such TV series as _Ally_McBeal_ and
_The_Practice_--aren't so much smart as they are silly.  The cast, which
is led by Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson, and
an amusingly foul-mouthed Betty White, is game enough, but they cannot
elevate the weak material beyond the watchable junk level.</P>
