<P>     FUNNY BONES is anything but what the title suggests.  As a comedy, 
this movie is a complete flop, with fewer laughs than the average 
mindless sitcom.  As a drama, it isn't much more successful.  
Writer/director Peter Chelsom, who brought us 1992's magical HEAR MY 
SONG, here gives us an array of offbeat characters who lack any semblance 
of three-dimensionality.  They all have their little quirks, but none is 
able to engage our attention or sympathy. </P>
<P>     For the most part, FUNNY BONES is flat.  Even the presence of funny 
man Jerry Lewis, still as energetic and zany as ever, can't liven up 
these proceedings.  The story doesn't allow for much light humor, 
preferring instead to dwell on long-buried family secrets, and the tone 
has only two modes: dismal and grim.  While this might be the proper mood 
for a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions, the actual story turns out to 
be rather unspectacular--not to mention muddled.   </P>
<P>     Tommy Fawkes (Oliver Platt) is an up-and-coming comedian about to go 
on stage for his big Las Vegas debut.  On hand are his mother, Laura 
(Ruta Lee), and father, George (Jerry Lewis), a world-famous comic.  From 
the beginning, Tommy's evening is a disaster.  No one's laughing at his 
jokes and he's becoming progressively more desperate.  Finally, after the 
spectacular failure of one gag, Tommy walks off the stage after informing 
his audience that he has only two weeks to live (this is a metaphorical, 
not factual, statement). </P>
<P>     Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, a transaction is taking place 
between two ships.  A group of Englishmen, led by an unscrupulous 
policeman named Stanley Sharkey (Ian McNeice), is buying six mysterious 
"eggs" from four Frenchman.  Sharkey's party has no intention of playing 
fair, however, and things get ugly.  One of the French crew is killed; 
one of the English, Jack Parker (Lee Evans), is hung out to dry by his 
companions; and an egg is lost.  Jack, a strong swimmer, manages to make 
his way to shore.  Once on solid land, his emotional instability gets the 
better of him and he climbs the Blackpool tower, threatening to kill 
himself.  He is talked down through the efforts of his father (Freddie 
Davis), uncle (George Carl), mother (Leslie Caron), and a dog called 
Toast. </P>
<P>     Fresh from his Las Vegas failure, Tommy arrives in Blackpool, 
intending to find and buy funny acts to convert for his own use.  After 
witnessing dozens of embarrassing performances, Tommy is introduced to 
the Parker Brothers--two aging gentlemen with a "unique" slapstick act.  
Things are not as straightforward as they first seem, however, and in 
getting to know the Parkers, Tommy is forced to confront unpleasant 
truths about himself and his famous father. </P>
<P>     Anyone who has seen a Vaudeville act knows that, like the routines 
of standup comics, they're a lot more funny in person than on camera.  In 
fact, it takes an extremely talented performer to effectively translate a 
portion of the spontaneous humor to the screen.  In FUNNY BONES, while 
the cast is comprised of accomplished actors, no one exhibits this 
ability.  Unfortunately, more than one quarter of the film is devoted to 
Vaudeville performances, and these sequences are more often tedious than 
diverting. </P>
<P>     As lifeless as the slapstick routines are, a solidly-dramatic script 
could have salvaged FUNNY BONES.  Alas, there isn't one.  Oh, there are a 
few clever lines here and there, and one or two thought provoking ideas, 
but little is done with any of the better elements.  Character 
development is routine and the narrative often strays onto odd tangents.  
By the time the overlong story sputters to a close, only a few loose ends 
have been tied off, and you're unlikely to care about the ones left 
unresolved.  This motion picture is a disjointed, messy affair, and a 
disappointment to those who had been looking forward to this director's 
sophomore effort. </P>
