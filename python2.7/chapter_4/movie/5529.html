<P>     Nobody lays it on quite as thick as Walt Disney.  Their newest
seasonal juggernaut, an animated operetta based on the Victor Hugo
classic, is just as big, bright, and beautiful as the marketing and
merchandising assault would lead us to believe.  Heck, we *already* know
most of what we're getting.  Having purchased our limited-edition
copies of THE LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, ALADDIN, THE LION
KING, and POCAHANTAS, we're pumped and primed for the schmaltzy ballads,
anthropomorphic critters, adult in-jokes, and, of course, an everybody-
cries ending.  Throw in the strange sight of a singing hunchback, some
more of that nifty computer- aided artwork, and a trio of finger-
snapping, wise-cracking gargoyles (led by the voice of "Seinfeld's"
Jason Alexander) and, viola, Disney's done it again...  except, this
time, with a twist.</P>
<P>     Under the direction of Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise (both from
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST), the animators have broken the mold in many
places.  This is a very Gothic movie that festers with surprisingly dark
and sinister deeds.  In the first ten minutes, alone, we witness both a
murder and attempted infanticide!  (You may want to keep the three- and
four-year olds away from this one.)  There are plenty of other adult
references, some serious and some side-splitting.  It's all a well-
deserved form of compensation for us grown ups; a reward, if you will,
for having to endure all the trailers, the tie-ins, and those dreadful
cardboard figures in the lobby.</P>
<P>     Yeah, the commercialism *is* crass.  (And, perhaps, in the case of
most major studios, entirely co-dependent to the creative process.)
However, I challenge anyone to name another movie this season (or year?)
that shows as much inspiration as perspiration.  No child, for example,
is likely to understand the agonies of the villainous Frolio, the
repressed Parisian judge who is tormented by his desire for the feisty
gypsy girl Esmeralda (voiced and modeled after Demi Moore).  But just as
they laughed at pink elephants on parade and without knowing a thing
about inebriation, so can children marvel at the demons that erupt from
Frolio's fireplace as he imagines the Hell that awaits his condemned
soul.</P>
