<P>It's always interesting to watch a film in which several A-list actors
have been thrown into the fold with each other. Conflicting acting
styles are modified (sometimes) to give interesting and fresh
perspectives (sometimes) on actors we've known for quite some time. A
successful meshing of talent like this is one of the brightest things
about THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK, the cinematic rendition of the third
episode in Alexandre Dumas' THREE MUSKATEERS trilogy. Unfortunately, a
lot of the talent incorporated into IRON MASK is not in the limelight
for a good portion of the movie, and so the finished product is a bit
muddled. So is the A-list cast the only thing that makes IRON MASK
worth watching? </P>
<P>Trying to pass THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK off as a heavyweight period
costume drama is like trying to pass a Geo Metro off as a muscle car.
Director Randall Wallace, who wrote the script for Braveheart and also
wrote the script here, rushes his drama through its opening moments. He
doesn't take advantage of the initial screen time to build the
atmosphere of a famine-wrought Paris on the edge of revolution, and the
sets that he constructs and fills with extras do not have a very
Renaissance feel about them. Without atmosphere, the movie has a hard
time conveying the characters' motivations and a lot of great characters
are therefore unfortunately left empty. </P>
<P>The plot itself is relatively simple. In the late 1600s, King Louis XIV
(Leonardo DiCaprio) sits on the throne of France, although his country
is in shambles. Aided by D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byerne), he shows no signs
of improving, although D'Artagnan hopes for the better. Louis has also
earned the hatred of several of his Muskateers (now retired), including
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis (John Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu, and Jeremy
Irons). The three conspire to replace the king with his twin brother
Phillippe (also DiCaprio), who is locked up at the Bastille. They spirit
the young lad out of prison, teach him the ways of royalty, and make the
switch during a costume party, but the wily D'Artagnan notices and soon
things are headed for the worse. </P>
<P>DiCaprio's double role does not necessarily make him twice as good.
Although his characters are so far apart that it almost seems like there
are two different actors, his arrogance for Louis is stale and his
innocence for Phillippe is too cute for the character's good. DiCaprio
did much better in TITANIC. The Three Muskateers and D'Artagnan are the
best, but Wallace has written them off to the side until the end and
does not take full advantage of their characters: the straightforward
Malkovich, the buffoonish Depardieu, and the contemplative Irons are all
fine performances. Byrne as D'Artagnan isn't as good, but only because
he takes the side of the evil Louis. Overall, it's obvious that
lightning doesn't strike the same place twice, both for DiCaprio and
Randall Wallace. IRON MASK is missable for better fare.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK": 2.0 stars - a fair movie.</P>
