<P>Based on an old Chinese folktale, this movie becomes Disney's 36th
animated feature, and its best since THE LION KING back in 1994.</P>
<P>PLOT:
The Huns have invaded China. One man from every Chinese family must
join the Army and serve in the country's defense. Recognizing that her
father is very old and incapable of effective combat duty, Mulan chops
her hair into a boy-cut, and pretends to be a man, so that she can take
her father's place in the war. She does effectively join the troops,
and fight for the honour of her father, her country and herself.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Funny, interesting, and mostly entertaining animated Disney feature
made for the marketing summer of 1998. Having gone in with little
expectations, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to find many
humorous moments in this animated fable, along with some pretty cool
action sequences, and an interesting lead character in Mulan. Of
course, it goes without saying that the real star of this film wasn't
Mulan, but the tiny disgraced dragon Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy.
This little creature managed to get a crack out of the audience during
every single one of its wonderful appearances on the big screen.
Reminded me a little of the "young" Murphy on Saturday Night Live,
before he got all pretty and serious (Surely, many of the lines in this
film were ad-libbed by Murphy himself.). </P>
<P>The story of this film was also very interesting to absorb, seeing that
it went within a culture that I knew very little about (Mind you, I
really have no idea how accurate this film's facts are, but still...).
The animation was also very well done, especially during the winter
scenes in the mountains, which really looked like the real deal. On the
down side, I guess that the songs in this movie could be considered its
weakest link, but then again, I've never been much of a musical guy
anyway, so that didn't bother me too much. </P>
<P>Overall, I would say this movie was a touch better than HERCULES
(6.5/10), and just about as good as the unexpectedly decent ANASTASIA
(7/10), but on a much funnier level, thanks mostly to the wonderful
talents of Eddie Murphy. Kids will love it (As loudly expressed in the
theater that I attended with Mrs. JoBlo), and most adults should also
enjoy it. The cinema or video question is one that I would just as soon
leave in your hands considering that I don't know of everyone's
financial situation. But if the movie sounds interesting enough to you,
or your lover's begging you to take her/him, by all means, go ahead and
see it on the big screen. It's fun and genuinely harmless (At 88
minutes run-time...how could you go wrong?)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Two of this film's previous titles were CHINA DOLL and THE LEGEND OF
MULAN.
Ming-Na Wen also starred in ONE NIGHT STAND (5/10) opposite Wesley
Snipes.
Lea Salonga does the voice of Mulan singing in this movie, as Donny
Osmond does the voice of Shang belting out the tunes.<HR>Visit JoBlo's Movie Emporium
