<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A psychological thriller about a sociopath who buries a missing woman
alive in an undisclosed location and gives the police 24 hours to find
her. The killer's motive at first seems to be ransom, but as the story
develops it turns out that he wants to see her suffer and for him to get
away with the dual murder of her and a policewoman, thereby he will be
recognized like his hero Harry Houdini, as the greatest escape artist of
all.</P>
<P>Harry (Adrien Brody) kidnaps Frances Hannon (Laila) and her pooch in
front of her Manhattan building and takes the hysterical woman to a
wooded area around the NYC area (Poughkeepsie cemetery), where he
videotapes her and buries her alive in her underclothes. He then has his
partner deliver the ransom demand of a million dollars and the videotape
of her screaming for help to her wealthy art dealer husband (James
Naughton). The location of the ransom drop is at the Queens cemetery
where Houdini was buried in 1926.</P>
<P>Assigned to the case are a team of NYPD detectives, which includes a
working together husband and wife team, police captain Tim (Terry
Kinney) and detective Madeline (Maura Tierney), and an ace detective
Jessie (Paul Calderon). The married couple are going through a rough
period in their marriage, where Madeline is not faithful to him and is
lost in her own troubled world, realizing that she has a very dark side
to her that she can't stop from surfacing.</P>
<P>Written and directed with style by Richard Shepard (The Linguini
Incident), "Oxygen" is a compelling psychodrama, whose story is
sickening but is superbly played by an excellent cast. Adrien Brody got
the most he could get out of the character and gives a riveting
performance of someone who has gone over the edge. Maura Tierney also
turns in a spectacular performance, portraying a very troubled but
courageous woman. It was clearer to find out what was troubling Harry
than it was to get to the bottom of her problem, but her
characterization of a pained woman was almost as interesting as his.</P>
<P>When the victim's husband goes to the cops even though he is not
supposed to, the cops nab Harry after the ransom drop-off at the
cemetery and a high-speed car chase into Manhattan. It then becomes a
cat-and-mouse game between Harry and the police, with him refusing to
talk to anyone but Madeline, as he spots cigarette burns on Madeline's
arm and senses they have the same perversions and need for pain. The
victim's impatient husband pulls strings and gets thev F.B.I. involved
in the case, muttering under his breath that these cops are amateurs.</P>
<P>There are many problems with the story's credibility, starting from all
the power the woman detective is given in handling the case, and the
fact that NYC has a department code that states a married couple can't
have one of them be the supervisor of the other. There are many other
contrivances in the story that I'm afraid don't add up, such as Madeline
being left alone in a room with Harry and without a two-way mirror or
microphones, whereby he slips out of his handcuffs and escapes taking
her with him to be buried with Frances. No police procedure would ever
take that chance, and the film hinges all its marbles on that being
accepted for its tricky ending to work. But for sheer excitement, the
fast-paced film moves rapidly along to see if the police can get to the
buried Frances in time, and in the meantime, Brody gives the performance
of his career so far. "Oxygen" had some fresh air in its tank which it
leaked out at times to refreshen some of its derivative scenes,
especially the opening subway scene, where the lead police couple come
across a wanted felon and give chase, in a scene that looked like it
came right out of "The French Connection."</P>
