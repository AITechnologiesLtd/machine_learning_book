Mousey (1974)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 81</PRE>
<P>"Mousey" is a humble and obscure made-for-TV movie, but it is 
surprisingly tough.  Most TV movies are targeted to women, and 
usually feature a heroic woman who has to overcome obstacles put 
in her path by a controlling man or a jealous woman.  "Mousey" is 
nothing like that formula, and is an interesting and intense 
character study of a disturbed and obsessed man.</P>
<P>The film stars Kirk Douglas, a veteran high school biology
teacher who has been stuck with the nickname Mousey by his
students.  His wife has recently left him, also taking her preteen 
son.  Douglas begins to stalk his ex-wife.  He begins to murder
strangers, having the disturbed logic that this will somehow
impress his wife.</P>
<P>Jean Seberg and John Vernon co-star.  It would be the last
American production for Seberg.</P>
<P>Douglas' character loves his ex-wife and her son, but he
loves them as possessions, not as individuals.  He believed that
his marriage was content, while his ex-wife thought it was
empty.  Mousey reacts to the loss of his family as if it were 
a loss of his property, with him having the "right" to recover
that property.</P>
<P>There is a lot of tension in the film, mostly generated by
Mousey's underlying pathos.  Douglas gives an excellent 
performance, never softening his vengeful character except for 
tenderness to his lost adopted son.  The lower budget is
obvious only in the hokey soundtrack.</P>
<P>"Mousey" shows that a film, even a made-for-TV movie, can be
successful in focusing completely on a single character, as long
as that character is deserving of such study.</P>
