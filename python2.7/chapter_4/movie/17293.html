<P>THE CORRUPTOR can best be summarized as a movie about individuals who
are stuck in the gray areas of life. Many a film has been made about
this dubious ground which lacks morals and order, and survival is easily
half chance. But try as it might, THE CORRUPTOR, directed by James Foley
(GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS) cannot reach the level of intelligence necessary
to skillfully carry this theme. Instead, it's simply a plain old
detective thriller with neon lights and naked women put in for
"atmosphere." </P>
<P>Chow Yun-Fat, making his sophomore domestic effort here after last
year's action thriller THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, stars as NYPD Asian Gang
Unit officer Nick Chen. On the payroll of a local Chinatown mobster (Ric
Young) and faced with a surging wave of crime in his territory Nick is
also in the company of a new partner, Danny Wallace (Mark Wahlberg).
Although Danny reeks of inexperience, Nick takes him under his wing and
the two go on a mission of vengeance to clean up Chinatown -- despite
emotional baggage and an interesting plot twist. </P>
<P>The script for this story is clever but not excessively so, the first
such piece written for the screen by Robert Pucci. It demands a lot of
energy from the director and the cast, hidden amongst awesome
pyrotechnics and furious gun battles, and unfortunately neither Foley
nor Wahlberg and Chow can deliver on that promise. Instead, the movie
comes off feeling like a fake, which pretends to have its supply of
adrenaline wound taut like a tennis net but never delivers on that
promise. Camera tricks and editing room finesse can only go so far to
hide these shortcomings. </P>
<P>The rest of the script devotes itself to a detective story which is not
skillfully written. Although the plot may have been orderly and clear to
Pucci, on the screen it plays out in an unrefined fashion. Bits of
crucial information are bookended by half-finished subplots and become
lost among the flashiness of THE CORRUPTOR's visual side. This last bit,
the visuals, is perhaps the movie's most redeeming value, for there are
moments when the action is good and the plot is straightforward. Put
simply, THE CORRUPTOR falls into its own gray area: it does not succeed
and it does not fail, giving it the unfortunate disposition of being
easily forgotten. </P>
