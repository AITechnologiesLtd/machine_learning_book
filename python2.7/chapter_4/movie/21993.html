<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A heart-rendering film capably directed by the actor now turned
first-time director, Tony Goldwyn, for and about the baby boom
generation, taking place in upstate New York, where a lower middle class
couple annually rent a bungalow for the summer in a Jewish resort and
react to all the change that is in the air for the country and for them
in the summer of '69. It was the summer of the Vietnam War protests,
Neil Armstrong's walk on
the moon, and Woodstock, so the music in the background is appropriately
enough from Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Grateful Dead, Richie Havens,
Dylan, and Hendrix, and so on, which should bring on a case of nostalgia
for those who were around during that period. There should also be some
nostalgia left over for the days of bungalow colonies as family vacation
spots, for those who might have experienced that sort of vacation when
growing up or raising a family.</P>
<P>like the other couples heading for their summer oasis, the featured
couple like to keep time how long it takes them to get from the city by
car to their Catskill Mountain lodgings, with the Red Apple being the
famous rest stop on the thru-way and the half-way point in their
commute. Pearl Kantrowitz (Diane Lane) is the restless housewife asking
her steadfast television repairman husband, Marty (Liev Schreiber), "Why
do we do the same thing every summer?" His unsatisfactory response to
her is, "Because we do." The eldest child, the 14-year-old Alison (Anna
Paquin), seen wearing a peace medallion around her neck and is also seen
rebelling against her parents lack of idealogy, while her younger
brother, Danny (Boriello), is dressed in a cowboy hat and is just an
innocent kid. The housewife's mother-in-law, the perceptive Lilian
(Tovah Feldshuh), who is a visionary and is very close with her son,
especially so, after her husband just took off and left her one day, and
her son swore he would look out for her from here on. She feels sorry
that her son who dreamed of being a scientist but went to work as a
television repairman, as the easiest way to support his wife, had to
give up his childhood dream.</P>
<P>The Kantrowitz's met when she was a teenager and he was a waiter in a
resort hotel, and the first time they made love the 17-year-old virgin
became pregnant with Alison, which led to their marriage, something the
husband says is the best thing that has happened to him, even if that
marriage led to his not becoming a college graduate but a television
repairman. She now feels that she can't communicate her feelings to her
husband, that life has past her by. She complains to him that the most
important decision that she has to do as a housewife is to choose
whether to shop in the A&P or at Waldbaums. His response is that the
Ring-Dings are fresher at the A&P.</P>
<P>The bungalow colony is a place where everyone knows everyone else's
business, where the men work in the city during the week and come up for
the weekend. It is a place where visitors such as the knish man, is
announced so that the colony will know that he is on the premises. One
of the visitors to the bungalow colony is the handsome blouse man,
Walker Jerome (Viggo), a free-spirited hippie type, peddling his wares
from colony to colony, who bought out the regular blouse man's truck and
route. Tempted by what seems to be the greener grass on the other side
of the fence, Pearl has an affair with the gentle and laidback hippie on
the night of the walk on the moon and is seen by her daughter with him
while attending the nearby Woodstock concert. The film purposefully
means to mirror the couple's life with the changes that altered the face
of the nation during that period.</P>
<P>The ramifications of her affair becomes common knowledge to the family
and threatens the marriage, a marriage where the husband has done
nothing wrong and is, if anything, too good. Marty goes out of his head
at the thought of her with another man and will go into an
uncontrollable rage, feeling the one thing he was most secure about in
life has been taken away from him, while Pearl wrestles with her sense
of responsibility and with what she really wants to do. Finally, she
decides not to ride off with Walker and live a hippie-style of life, and
the super-straight Marty decides to loosen up a little and get with the
new music coming into vogue.</P>
<P>The story allows mother and daughter to come to terms freely with who
they are, as Alison has her first period and her first boyfriend, and is
exploring who she is just like her mother is currently doing. The
conflict between mother and daughter, reflects on how this particularly
volatile time in American history resulted in a sexual revolution and in
a generational movement of attitude changes, that forced families to
face what was in the air at the time or else wide gaps developed in
family relationships.</P>
<P>The moral question the film raises about adultery can only be resolved
accordingly by the parties affected, and so what happens in the film's
mild rendering to the problem seems credible at first glance, as it is
put forth in a way that worked out for the film's sake but might not
have seemed correct for many a viewer, or at least, it was not important
enough to be resolved by the film, even if that clash was supposedly the
whole point of the film.</P>
<P>The acting was convincing, the story had a nice feel to it, and it
followed along with the historical mood the country was going through at
that time. The yearnings for a new kind of freedom and to step away from
the old boredom of other generations was in the air, as a counterculture
was constantly being dangled in front of all types. What the film
lacked, was resolution. The aim of the film was realized as a small step
for a troubled woman feeling the need for passion in her life and
getting it via an affair; but, there were no gigantic aims to be
accomplished after Pearl takes her gigantic leap into the arms of her
hippie lover. I thought that the fleeting affair she had with the
long-haired sculptured Adonis figure, certainly satisfied her sexual
needs but the bigger moral question of adultery was never even attempted
to be answered with any kind of satisfactory response, which left me
believing that the liaison was the thing here, just like in those
romantic pulp fiction books that are an easy read, with nothing more to
tax your mind.</P>
