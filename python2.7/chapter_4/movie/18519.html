FATHERLAND (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Almost half a century after World War Two, there are still
many voices, especially in some countries of Eastern Europe,
who lament the outcome of that global conflict. For them,
the wrong side has lost and the world would have been much
better place if it happened otherwise. For others, Hitler's
victory in WW2 is a matter of pure speculation, and Sci-Fi
novels from the alternative history sub-genre used that
concept very often (most notably in 1962 novel THE MAN IN
THE HIGH CASTLE by Philip K. Dick). However, first such
novel to reach the mainstream audience was Robert Harris'
FATHERLAND, bestseller who later served as basis for 1994
HBO movie, directed by Christopher Menaul.</P>
<P>The plot of this film is set in the alternative 1964, in a
world where Hitler managed to successfully finish conquest
of Europe, while USA was too busy making war with Japan. The
result is Germania, grand Nazi empire that controls the
entire Old Continent, with 75-year old Adolf Hitler still at
its helm. After the decades of cold war and still frustrated
with the inability to finish the bitter guerrilla war with
the remnants of Soviet Union, Hitler's regime wants to
improve relations with the other superpower, USA, led by
anti-Semitic and pro-German President Joseph Kennedy. The
summit in Berlin is set, and among many invited journalists
is Charlie Maguire (played by Miranda Richardson). She would
stumble on Xavier March (Rutger Hauer), SS officer who is
investigating the mysterious death of former Nazi official.
The murder is somewhat connected with the "Jewish question"
conference that took place during the war, and almost all
participants are dying. While trying to find the motive for
the killings, March and Maguire become targets of Gestapo.</P>
<P>The entire concept of alternative history is really
fascinating. On one hand, the created worlds are so
different from the world we live in, and on the other hand,
they are in the same time closer and more recognisable than
fantastic worlds of distant galaxies or distant futures. The
world of FATHERLAND, although some may question its
plausibility (most of the today's historians are almost
unanimous in their opinion that Hitler could never win WW2,
at least not in the way indicated in the film), is very
realistic one. The most intriguing idea is to show the most
evil and universally despised political system in the world
- German Nazism - slowly evolving into its "gentler and
kinder" form, in a manner very similar to the path Soviet
Union took from Stalin to Gorbachev era.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, like many good novels, FATHERLAND suffered a
terrible fate in its version as feature film. Instead of
putting an effort to show the fascinating and intriguing
details of Robert Harris' world, screenplay by Ron
Hutchinson and Stanley Weiser concentrated almost
exclusively on the lame, predictable and boring crime
investigation. Such subplots, as the example of much better
GORKY PARK shows us, simply don't work in totalitarian
settings, as long as the all-powerful government is one of
culprits. And with Nazi Germany, even in its "reformed"
version, that is definitely the case. Things are even made
worse with the poorly drawn characters, and actors who don't
put much effort in playing, which is especially the case
with Rutger Hauer. Terrible scripting culminates with hardly
believable, unoriginal finale and corny epilogue that would
have to establish the parallels between the fall of
alternative Nazism and our world's Communism.</P>
<P>It would be unfair to say that FATHERLAND doesn't have its
good sides. Director Menaul put some real effort in
portraying some interesting details while portraying Robert
Harris' world (like the posters of "Die Beatles" band). The
locations and some of the artifacts from Communist era
Czehoslovakia provided good hints how would latter dazy
Third Reich would look like. Unfortunately, all those
details are catching our attention only in the first part of
the film. The rest is one great disappointment - one of the
most tragic examples of great movies ideas being wasted in
mediocre screen effort.</P>
