<P>     KISS THE GIRLS is a textbook example of how to ruin a good story.
Gary Fleder (THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD) directs this
torturously sanitized adaptation of James Patterson's bestseller about a
D.C.  forensic psychologist (Morgan Freeman) who comes to Durham, North
Carolina, after his Duke-attending niece goes up missing.  Turns out
that the D.P.D. (and the F.B.I.) have been sitting on a series of
kidnappings and murders, of college girls from all around the area.
What Freeman's character surmises is that "Casanova," as he calls
himself, is actually a collector who's keeping these young women alive
for various sundry, sordid purposes.  (And of which the graphic details
are nearly entirely omitted.  With the exception of a wee bit of gore,
the creepiest images in this movie are safe enough to be shown on the
Disney channel.) Before long, Freeman's character has a partner-in-
crime-control, a medical student (Ashley Judd) who escapes from the
kidnapper-killer's underground lair with an assist from some convenient
kick-boxing skills.  An older black man as an action hero?  A slasher
victim who fights back??  And the barest whiff of a romance between the
two???  Admittedly, this is non-standard fare for Hollywood, which makes
the movie's many, many failures all the more regrettable.</P>
<P>     On the up side, Morgan Freeman is his expectedly excellent self.
He brings the necessary weight to the story and without enduring the
humiliation of having to spout one-liners, such as, say, "you've been
pasteurized." Ms. Judd, who should be but isn't the other anchor at the
story's core, fares far less better.  She's a good actress saddled with
an only-okay characterization.  (In the novel, as I recall, she suffers
much more abuse before her escape, which adds an edge to the character
that's missing from the filmed version.) And so, with two talented
actors at front and center, KISS THE GIRLS never becomes unwatchable--
no matter how hard Fleder tries to kill the non-mood, be it through bozo
casting (what the Hell is Cary Elwes doing here?), atrocious southern
accents on the part of the supporting cast (what dialect is Brian Cox,
one- time Hannibal Lecter in MANHUNTER, speaking in the minuscule role
of Durham's police chief?), giggle-inducing shots of the disguised
villain, way too many moonlight foot chases, and an underground dungeon
that, truth be told, looks more like an amusement park ride than a Civil
War-era leftover.  Sigh.  I suppose that the biggest disappointment is
the lack of local color.  Short of a shot or two of Duke, Durham, and
the RTP, you'd never know that KISS THE GIRLS was filmed around here.</P>
