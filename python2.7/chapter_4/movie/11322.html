<PRE>                       The Replacement Killers
                    A film review by Frank Ochieng</PRE>
<PRE>starring: Chow Yun-Fat, Mira Sorvino
Director: Antoine Fuqua</PRE>
<P>      Antoine Fuqua, noted music video director, supplies the action
in his latest action thriller cleverly called THE REPLACEMENT
KILLERS. This flashy, action-packed flick comes with some notable
performers: top Asian star Chow Yun-Fat and Oscar-winning actress Mira
Sorvino. THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS is your typical kinetic-kicking,
bullet-bouncing, danger-dodging, Hong Kong-oriented thriller that has
the legs but never manages to run with what you would expect a
distinctive action piece such as this deserves.</P>
<P>      Yun-Fat, who obviously is testing his stardom status here in the
U.S. just like his fellow Asian action stars Jackie Chan and Michelle
Yeoh, plays a wayward assassin from China sent to the United States to
complete a "hit" but his heart isn't in the right mode to do so. As a
result, Yun-Fat is stuck in the country and his only way of escaping
is to utilize the services of Sorvino's document forger. Together,
they scamper through chaotic crazy situations while shooting up the
joint left and right. There are some devastatingly dangerous yet dandy
stunts plus both stars come off as more clever and keen than what is
actually believed given their involvement in these sensational situ-
ations. However, you never really get to see any enthusiasm or robust
reaction to action hero Yun-Fat's character. He seems remote and more
like a shoot 'em up robot.  He doesn't seem to possess the campy high-
flying enjoyment like his action counterpart Jackie Chan does in his
movies. And the duo of Yun-Fat and Sorvino doesn't really click on
screen...their dynamic duo routine somehow doesn't register in the
compatibility department.</P>
<P>       THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS is indeed a crafty and catchy title for
a thriller. But this movie never lives up to its exciting name. Maybe
it is because this film's motivation is from an American music video
director in that of Fuqua who simply lacks the intense, atmospheric
slap-happy exuberance from that of Asian directors like John Woo or
Stanley Tong who can satisfy the needs of the Hong Kong-style action
genre. THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS ands its main star Chow Yun-Fat both
have the potential as a breakout hit and star in the U.S.
respectively but this vehicle needs to be driven by someone with more
charisma and character. A fair action thriller is offered here but
what a difference this movie would make from merely being fair to that
of being a fist-full-of-frenzied fun. A mild recommendation at best.</P>
