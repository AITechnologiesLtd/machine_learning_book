<PRE>POSSESSED BY THE NIGHT
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>"De gustibus non disputandum est" ("People's tastes should
not be discussed") is an old Latin proverb that is going to
be seriously challenged whenever someone chooses interior
decoration similar to the one chosen by the protagonist of
POSSESSED BY THE NIGHT, 1994 erotic thriller directed by
Fred Olen Ray. For writer Howard Hansen (played by Ted
Prior) a simple jar containing brain looks like an exotic
artefact so he brings it home. Needless to say, the said jar
is alive and able to lead Hansen and people around him to
evil. But this is just a part of Hansen's problems, since
his literary agent Murray (played by Frank Sivero) is a
gambling addict in serious debt to mean gangland boss Scott
Lindsay (played by Henry Silva). In order to pay his debts,
he wants to steal the manuscript of Hansen's yet unfinished
novel and his sexy secretary Carol McKay (played by Shannon
Tweed) is sent to Hansen's household.</P>
<P>When queen of cheap 1990s "erotic thrillers" Shannon Tweeds
stars in a film directed by trash cinema king Fred Olen Ray
the viewers might be certain that the result of this
combination won't have any redeeming values. Whole
Cormanesque horror plot is nothing more than an excuse to
have Shannon Tweed naked in front of cameras. The trouble
with POSSESSED BY THE NIGHT is in the plot being way bellow
even such minimal standards necessary for this kind of
movies. To make things even worse, this "plot" is combined
with even more ridiculous subplot about loanshark wanting to
go straight, introduced probably only in order to fill 90
minutes of running time. Result of all this is, as you might
expect, a complete mess. It is sad to see how once great
actors like Henry Silva or notable performers like Sandahl
Bergman sink their reputations by appearing in this film.
However, at certain points this film becomes so bad in an
entertaining way, and Shannon Tweed does deliver her goods
on the screen, so it could be said that POSSESSED BY THE
NIGHT fulfilled its purpose.</P>
