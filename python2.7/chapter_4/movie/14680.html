<P>When I was a little kid (before I even started school), I used to
think that war had spectators like a sporting event would.  I thought
that there were bleachers or something similar where people from
opposing countries would sit and watch (look, I was just five years
old, ok?)  Well, Saving Private Ryan makes you feel like you are a
spectator in World War II, sitting just far enough away as to not get
killed.  It's the first war film I've ever seen that seemingly
presents war as it probably was, instead of how Hollywood thinks it
was.</P>
<P>The film starts with the invasion of Normandy during World War II.
And right away you'll know that you're not about to see just another
war film.  We see one of the invasion boats open up it's doors and
within a second at least ten soldiers are brutally killed.  It's such
a powerful jolt, and I've never seen anything like it.  Compare it to
a scene from another great WWII movie The Longest Day where during the
invasion of Normandy, Sean Connery jumps out of his invasion boat,
falls into the water, and it's treated like a wacky little moment.
Nothing against The Longest Day, but I think that Saving Private Ryan
is probably a little closer to reality.</P>
<P>After an incredibly brutal 20-30 minutes, we come to the plot of the
film.  Three brothers have been killed and their mother is about to
receive all three telegrams announcing their deaths.  It's learned
that there's a fourth brother, Private James Ryan, who is somewhere
behind enemy lines.  A squad of soldiers (led by Tom Hanks in another
outstanding dramatic performance) is ordered to go and find him, so
that he can be sent home.</P>
<P>The plot however, just isn't too crucial to the film.  Saving Private
Ryan isn't about finding a man and sending him home, it's about war,
about what soldiers go through, and the overall devastation that war
causes.  The violence in the film is shockingly brutal.  It may seem
gratuitous, but then again, so is war.</P>
<P>I didn't really care for the film's wrap-around scenes, the scenes
which open and close the film.  In them, an elderly Ryan visits the
graves of the fallen soldiers from the film.  While the scene's
intentions are good, they just don't mesh with the rest of the film.
To me they came off like cheesy TV-movie type theatrics.  That's
pretty much my only gripe though, and it can be easily overlooked
thanks to the excellence of the rest of the film.</P>
<P>So it all comes down to this: is Saving Private Ryan a good movie?
Yes, it most certainly is.  But it's more of a great film, or rather
an example of great filmmaking, than a great story.  It's certainly
not something I'd call entertaining, not something that I'd want to
watch over and over again.  It's powerful, moving, and clearly the
front-runner for an Academy Award in so many categories.  It's easily
the best film Spielberg has ever made, maybe not the best story he's
ever told, but the greatest film he's ever put together.  [R]</P>
