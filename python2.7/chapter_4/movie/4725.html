<P>     The first Big Action Movie of the year opens, appropriately enough,
in a boxing ring.  In this corner is John Travolta, a test-pilot-gone-
bad who's stealing nukes and demanding ransom.  His challenger is
Christian Slater, his copilot and supposed friend.  Their playpen is the
Utah Canyonlands, where Travolta has ditched their B-3 Stealth bomber
and is planning Bad Things if Uncle Sam doesn't pay.  Assisting Mr.
Slater is his PUMP UP THE VOLUME costar Samantha Mathis as a feisty Park
Ranger.  Together, they chase the Comeback Kid via plane, train, boat,
moat, and Humvie, as only SPEED scribe Graham Yost could imagine.</P>
<P>     Behind the lens is legendary action director John Woo (HARD BOILED,
HARD TARGET), who seems a mere shadow of his usual self.  Sure, he
brings a unique rhythm to an already too-familiar formula, but his
action sequences lack the fluid finesse that Woo is world-renowned for.
No bone breaking ballet here, just the occasional over-the-top thrill.
Such as Mathis and Slater evading a crashing helicopter's tail rotor.
Or the film's final twenty minutes, set aboard a hijacked freight train.</P>
<P>     All told, BROKEN ARROW is entertaining enough.  The script is
lively, Travolta is a blast as a badass, and John Woo is effective
enough, even at quarter-speed.  Unfortunately, there's not much that
*anyone* can do with the more, uh, erroneous casting choices.  Christian
Slater is hardly larger-than-life, but some viewers will probably accept
him as an action hero.  Samantha Mathis, however, is just plain awful.
What's she doing here?  The inclusion of, say, Travolta's GET SHORTY
costar Delroy Lindo we can understand.  Even former NFL player Howie
Long is an acceptable addition.  But looks-all-of-twenty-years-old Frank
Whaley as a Pentagon "suit?" Maybe the casting director was thinking
John *Hughes*.</P>
