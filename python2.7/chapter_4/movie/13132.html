<P>   If you talk at length to your dog, don't worry about it.
Everyone does.  When the dog starts answering you, then
you've got problems. Or do you?  If only the world accepted
such a two-way communication both you and they would be
better off.  You'd learn something about yourself relayed
straight from the horse's mouth from their four-legged views
and might even become as human as the animals themselves
are.</P>
<P>   With this in mind, Betty Thomas--perhaps most celebrated
by teens and adults for directing Howard Stern in "Private
Parts" and for subteens for helming the squarest of the
square families in "The Brady Bunch Movie"--seems eager to
bring a strong moral point home to her mostly small-fry
audience, a suggestion that will be most appreciated by the
adults who are escorted by them.  One is that doctors--and
even people--should relate to their fellow living creatures as
ends in themselves and not for what others can do to
advance their careers and income. She takes aim against the
shoddy practices of HMO's and should find little dissension in
the audience for that posture.  </P>
<P>   The movie opens on little John Dolittle, played as a three-
year-old by Raymond Matthew Mason and by a five-year-old
by Dari Gerard Smith.  The kid has is precocious.  He has a
way with animals and like St. Francis is devoted to gabbing
with them, though at this stage of development he does not
get a reply.  Many years later, when John (Eddie Murphy) has
become a successful doctor with a lovely wife, Lisa (Kristen
Wilson), he almost strikes a stray dog with his van.  When the
dog, at first appearing dead, rises, the animal remarks "Why
don't you look where you're going, you bonehead?"  No
explanation is given for Dolittle's new ability, though a blatant
product placement implies it might have been the Dunkin'
Donuts he had just eaten.  In no time flat, the title character
colloquies with his daughter's guinea pig, a couple of rats
fighting in a trash bin, a tiger in a circus, until he is packed off
to a mental institution.  His partner, Dr. Mark Weller (Oliver
Pratt), is concerned that John's behavior will ruin a lucrative
HMO buyout deal, and his wife wonders why he frequently
wanders off just when she feels her seductive powers working
on him.  The only understanding folks are his daughter Maya
(Kyla Pratt), who already considers herself weird and a misfit
and thereby identifies with dad; and John's father Archer
(Ossie Davis) who sees John's dialogues as a gift.</P>
<P>   Since special effects at a high stage of development, the
audience has no problem really believing that the animals are
mouthing the words, be they owls, rodents, goats, ducks,
dogs or cats.  As for lines, the best belong not to Eddie
Murphy but to the four-legged creatures, though Oscar Wilde
has nothing to fear from them. For example, in the pound as
one dog is being led to his death, another behind the cage
remarks "Dead dog walking."  A German shepherd in the vet's
office whines, "Don't fix me...I won't look at another female,"
but when an attractive collie passes by, he can't resist: "Yo,
baby!"  A horse carrying a mounted police officer remarks,
"Oh, look, a doughnut shop!" and one large woman's pet
comments as his owner bends over, "Isn't that the biggest ass
you've ever seen?"</P>
<P>   "Dr. Doolittle" is not "Masterpiece Theater" and no way can
it compete with the stories in Hugh Lofting's book, but it's a
heck of a lot better--less pretentious--that the overproduced
musical of the same name starring Rex Harrison that almost
wrecked Fox in 1967.  Eddie Murphy seems headed down the
route of Jim Carrey--less manic, more somber messaging,
and he does just fine.</P>
