<P>Just got back from watching Godzilla. I was a big fan of ID4, and even
though it wasn't logical, it was a lot of fun. I went in to Godzilla
expecting the same. What I got was 1 / 2 of what made ID4 good. Special
Effects. And I am not echoing what other people/critics have been saying,
just to be on a bandwagon, but the script was horrible! There was no
Character development. I didn't  care about a single soul! The acting by
Maria Pitillo was awful, almost to the point where I needed to quit looking
at the screen and cover up my ears! (I.E. The scene where she was crying.)
All of the other actors were wasted. They were not fun at all! The on going
jokes (Coffee, Tatopoulos last name, etc..) were not staged well at all, so
there was no humor in them. The one-liners were either mumbled, or said so
fast, that I couldn't understand them! And why wasn't Godzilla given more to
do?</P>
<P>As for Godzilla, he was an awesome site, but all of the action scenes
reminded me of Jurassic Park.</P>
<P>Also, why was it raining all of the time? What point in the plot did this
serve?</P>
<P>I left feeling let down and almost bored. I didn't care what happened by
midway through, I just wanted the movie to end! But I give it two stars
because of the special effects and the effort put forth by Broderick!</P>
