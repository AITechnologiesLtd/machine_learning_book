<P>ADDICTION, THE (director: Abel Ferrara; cast: Lili Taylor (Kathleen
Conklin), Edie Falco (Jean), Christopher Walken (Peina), Paul Caldaron
(Professor), Kathryn Erbe (Anthropology Student), Annabella Sciorra
(Casanova),  Robert Castle (Priest), 1995)</P>
<P>An N.Y.U. philosophy doctoral candidate, Kathleen Conklin (Lili), gets
her doctorate despite being bitten in the neck by a vampire (Sciorra)
and becoming one herself, when pulled into an alley after attending a
lecture on the My Lai massacre in Vietnam.</P>
<P>This handsomely shot b/w film, relates vampyrism to the evil that is
inherent in man, that becomes his addiction. Vampires are compared to
junkies who need their fix.The film brings out a collection of
philosophers to state its case; such as, Sartre, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche,
and Heidegger. In the background, we hear funky rap music and witness
the action on the mean streets of Greenwich Village.</P>
<P>The film makes use of the 24-hour around the clock slide show the
Holocaust Museum in NYC features, to interject from time-to-time, the
evil of the Nazis depicted in those slides. This was a mistake. You are
comparing apples with oranges, and the film suffers with its credibility
from such an unjust comparison. In case Ferrara forgot, vampires are not
real but the Holocaust was only too real.</P>
<P>The film itself, does not feature much action, relying on a lot of
chatter and non-communicative conversations to get its story across.
There is one mass bloodsucking scene at the film's climax, as Kathy
invites all her college mentors and personal acquaintances over to help
her celebrate her attaining of a doctoral degree with a reception. She
thanks them for coming, and then says, `I'd like to take a minute to
share with you a little of what I've learned while studying for my
doctorate.' Then she pounces on one of her professors, sucks out a
mouthful of blood, and spits it out at the crowd. Now that's what we
were waiting for, since the film did not feel quite right up to that
point. It felt better being more campy.</P>
<P>Despite the short-comings of the plot, Lili Taylor gives a credible
performance. She is especially good in the scene where she is pulling
out her own molar to prove a philosophical point. She is the best thing
about the film, playing a vampire addict who just wants her fix.</P>
<P>This thinking man's vampire movie, is a natural for the midnight cult
audience, but will seem out of place in a prime time slot. Christopher
Walken is a natural for this type of film, but has a part that might as
well be nonexistent. We don't see him until the film is nearly over, and
when we do see him, he doesn't do much, except drain the blood of the
still-not-evolved vampire, Kathy.</P>
<P>One of the many problems with this low-budgeter, is that it couldn't
tell its story without the philosophers. It needs their explanations to
explain itself. The story, which could have been more interesting if
developed properly, never has a chance to really express itself without
being explained away in philosophical terms. All its weird subjects are
brazenly brought up and we are teased with the weight of their meaning,
and then we are stopped short from following through on what their
implications are. For instance, the topic of free will, always a good
philosophical one; but, when Kathy says it is now my will against
theirs, we are not quite sure what she means by that. When she confronts
her next chosen victim and is ready to vamp them, she asks them to look
her in the face and tell her, convincingly, to let go. But what does
that mean. Unless this is a blatant call against pacifism, saying we
have to get ready to kick ass whenever we are set-upon.</P>
<P>The film's theme becomes, that existence itself is the search for relief
from our habits, and existence is the only relief we can find from our
habits that makes sense. What Kathy learns from her vampire guru, Peina
(Walken), not her college prof, is that we are all evil: we must
annihilate the self. So the question becomes, what should we do, if we
can't kill what is dead...You will do anything for a fix, says Kathy. An
addiction is an evil thing to have. And if you are faced with choosing
you or them, jumping or being pushed, Kathy still believes that you must
satisfy your own needs first. Or, you can do with as little as you
possibly can, says the diet-conscious and wise vampire, Peina.</P>
<P>If you want to see a film that is more credible than this one, that
handles the same subject, but injects more life and fear into its story,
and less philosophy and guilt-ridden religious themes, check out Larry
Fessenden's Habit.</P>
