<P>I've never really enjoyed period pieces because, most of the time, I 
don't think they are done very well. Usually, they seem to lack the 
urgency that they desperately need so that they become interesting. In 
"Mrs. Dalloway," unfortnately, there is no such luck.</P>
<P>At the start of "Mrs. Dalloway," which is set over a period of one day 
in 1923, the title character (Vanessa Redgrave), an aging, recently 
divorced woman living in England, is preparing for a party that she will 
be holding that night. Throughout the day, she reflects back to the life 
she once knew when she was a young woman (portrayed by Natascha 
McElhone), and had the chance to marry a spontaneous, loving man (Rupert 
Graves), but chose instead to play it safe with an uncaring beau. </P>
<P>I rented "Mrs. Dalloway" basically because I thought it might be 
interesting, since it is set during a 24-hour period, but what I didn't 
count on was for it to be constantly distracting. The film switches 
countless times from 1923 to when she was younger, to the point that it 
started to feel muddled and painfully episodic. By having the story cut 
away so often to other things (and a few subplots I haven't mentioned), 
I could never get caught up in Mrs. Dalloway's ultimate search for 
happiness. And the way that another story involving a shell-shocked WWI 
soldier is interwined with the main one felt convoluted and obvious.</P>
<P>The performances in "Mrs. Dalloway" are not to be faulted. Redgrave is 
believable as Mrs. Dalloway, and she looks startlingly like McElhone, 
who plays her in the flashbacks. Another performance I admired, but who 
was underused, was Katie Carr, as Redgrave's young daughter.</P>
<P>Since the structuring of the story was needlessly drawn out and 
unnecessary, I didn't grow to care about any of the characters, and at 
the end, when "Mrs. Dalloway," attempts to be moving, it left me cold. </P>
