Reviewed January 8, 1999.</P>
<P>Paul Schrader's "Affliction" is such an angry and bitter motion picture 
that you can almost physically feel the emotional coldness that is 
brewing under the surface of the two central characters who are living 
in the wintry, snowy landscape of New Hampshire: a brutal, insensitive 
father (James Coburn) whose shockingly heartless and cruel character 
traits seem to be rubbing off on his son, Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte), 
a small-town sheriff in his fifties.</P>
<P>As "Affliction" opens, it is Halloween night, although it certainly 
doesn't appear to be, as the entire town is covered in a heavy blanket 
of snow. Wade is taking his young daughter, Jill (Brigid Tierney), to a 
Halloween party, but before the night is over, the unhappy Jill has 
called her mother and Wade's ex-wife, Lillian (Mary Beth Hurt), to come 
and get her. Wade is outraged by this action and is fed up of being a 
stranger to his daughter, so much so that he becomes set on aquiring an 
attorney to start a custody battle. The following day, a hunting 
accident involving one of Wade's friends goes awry, leaving the other 
man, who slipped on the snow and ice and shot himself, dead. Although 
there is no evidence that would lead anyone to believe otherwise, Wade 
is convinced that there was a conspiracy to murder him, and that maybe 
even the mob is in on it. Finally, there is a love interest in Wade's 
life, Maggie Fogg (Sissy Spacek), an understanding and caring waitress 
who only wants to make Wade happy. From the first shot of Wade, it is 
obvious that he has an edgy temper, and as the film progresses, we are 
treated to glimpses of his traumatic childhood, as he was constantly 
bullied and terrorized by his abusive and emotionally wounding father. 
There are slight traces of his father in Wade, to be sure, and he knows 
it himself, but seems trapped, not only in his life, but in what is 
quickly becoming an inevitable transformation into his father, whom he 
desperately hates.</P>
<P>"Affliction" reminded me of an equally brilliant previous film from 
1998, "The Celebration," which dealt with many of the same topics, such 
as the hurtful wounds and hatred in a family. Based on a novel by 
Russell Banks, whose other book, "The Sweet Hereafter," was adapted 
superbly for the screen in 1997 by Atom Egoyan, "Affliction" is a 
superior piece of work and an enormous accomplishment for director Paul 
Schrader, who wrote such film classics as 1976's "Taxi Driver" and 
1980's "Raging Bull," and specializes in the underlying dark emotions of 
the human psyche.</P>
<P>One of the pleasures I always get from a motion picture like 
"Affliction," although the subject matter is difficult at times, is its 
multi-layered story. It would be easy enough to create a film about a 
man losing his grip with saneness, but it is completely another thing to 
create multiple subplots, such as the hunting accident mystery, which 
may just be part of Wade's deterioration; his relationship with his 
confused daughter; and his romantic involvement with Maggie. All of 
these elements smoothly come together to form an extraordinary tapestry 
of the human conditon, and a more affirming character study of Wade, who 
is not a bad man, but finds his grim future inescapable.</P>
<P>As Wade, Nick Nolte gives, perhaps, the best performance of the year. He 
is flawless throughout, and seamlessly is able to convey all of his 
character's feelings to the audience without spelling it out with words. 
Wade is heartbreaking because of the reality that he knows he is headed 
for, but doesn't want to go to, and Nolte is certainly up to the 
challenge. Meanwhile, James Coburn is hateful and even terrifying as 
Wade's father, and whenever he appeared on screen I was taken over by a 
deep sense of dread at what he might say or do. If an actor can make you 
believe he is as mean and sick of a human being as Coburn does, it is a 
sign of an exceptional performance. Lending fine support are Sissy 
Spacek, who was refreshing to see after a considerable absense from the 
screen lately, and in her portrayal of Maggie Fogg, we sympathize with 
her plight as she sees the man she loves slowly begin to turn into his 
nightmarish father. And as Jill, Wade's daughter, Brigid Tierney gives 
an amazing performance, for we believe that she is her character, a 
young girl in the middle of her love, and fear, of her own father, and 
her longing to be in the confines of the safety of her mother. The film 
is occasionally narrated by Rolfe, Wade's younger brother (Willem 
Dafoe), who is living far away but briefly makes an appearance a little 
over an hour into the film.</P>
<P>Adding to the effectiveness of the picture is the simple, yet perfectly 
realized, music score by Michael Brook, and the blustery, atmospheric 
cinematography by Paul Sarossy, which grows to become an effective 
metaphor for the isolation that appears between the characters.</P>
<P>As I watched "Affliction," I was not quite sure where everything was 
headed, and the masterfully-done climax caught me by utter surprise, and 
left me with feelings of uneasiness, which was entirely appropriate 
since the film was only staying true to itself. All of the plot threads 
never seemed false or out of place, and I never once doubted the 
reasoning and emotions of the characters. Paul Schrader not only shows 
his grand abilities of directing the film, but also for writing its 
remarkable screenplay, which, I doubt, could have been any better. 
"Affliction" is one of the most powerful and heartwrenching films of 
1998. </P>
