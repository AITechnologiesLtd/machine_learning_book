<PRE>Hope Floats (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The latest weepy chick flick from actor-director Forest Whitaker
(_Waiting_to_Exhale_) demonstrates all too well the limitations of good
acting.  Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick Jr., Gena Rowlands, and young Mae
Whitman turn in strong performances, but they can't make Steven Rogers's
soggy script float (yeah, bad pun) above the level of made-for-TV movie.
After being dumped by her husband (Michael Pare) on a national TV talk show
(by far the film's most entertaining scene) Birdee Pruitt (a radiant
Bullock) and her daughter Bernice (Whitman) moves back in with her
taxidermist mother (Rowlands) in backwater Smithville, Texas.</P>
<P>>From this point on, everything belongs on the small screen.  Birdee is
aggressively wooed by a nice guy (Connick) who's had a crush on her since
high school, but she and especially Bernice can't overcome the hope that
her hubby will come back to her.  There is also the obligatory
disease-stricken older relative: in this case, Birdee's father, who's been
staying in a rest home since having a stroke and coming down with
Alzheimer's.  I'm not spoiling anything by revealing Birdee eventually
stops feeling sorry for herself and starts living again, but, of course,
not before a number of tears are shed, people lovingly embrace, and the de
rigueur death of a loved one.  Nothing spells dull and saccharine quite
like the two dreaded Hs--hugs and healing.</P>
