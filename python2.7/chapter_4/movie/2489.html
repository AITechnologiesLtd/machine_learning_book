<PRE>"We're gonna be too big for Hamburg.  We're gonna be too big for 
Liverpool.  We're gonna be too big for our own bloody good." 
          - John Lennon, BACKBEAT </PRE>
<P>     Oliver Stone probably loves this film.  Not only is BACKBEAT a
story from "his" era, the early Sixties, but it bears more than a
passing resemblance to one of his own pictures, THE DOORS (although it
should be noted that BACKBEAT moves a lot faster).  If nothing else,
however, Stone usually gets his characters right, but the failure to
create a compelling protagonist is this movie's greatest flaw.</P>
<P>     Back before anyone had heard of the Beatles, they were a group of
five--John Lennon (Ian Hart), Paul McCartney (Gary Bakewell), George
Harrison (Chris ONeill), Pete Best (Scot Williams), and Stuart
Sutcliffe (Stephen Dorff)--playing clubs in Hamburg.  Lennon and
Sutcliffe were best friends, and every time McCartney tried to oust the
less-talented Sutcliffe from the band, Lennon threatened to leave as
well.  While in Hamburg, the group met Astrid Kirchherr (Sheryl Lee), a
photographer who became especially fond of Sutcliffe.  The love affair
that developed between these two threatened the stability of the band,
and led to one of the most difficult decisions that Sutcliffe ever had
to make.</P>
<P>     I would have enjoyed BACKBEAT more if I had begun to feel
something for any of the men or women populating this tale.  However,
since director Iain Softley seems more interested in establishing tone
and atmosphere than in creating vibrant personalities, he is unable to
harness the full power of his story.  In fact, the script itself is not
tightly-focused, although the lack of a strong lead character could in
part be responsible for this.</P>
<P>     On one hand, BACKBEAT wants to recount the story of how the
Beatles emerged from playing seedy German nightclubs to where they were
poised on the brink of stardom.  Equally, however, it attempts to
chronicle the development of the not-so-simple love affair between Stu
Sutcliffe and Astrid Kirchherr, and how that romance affected the last
years of Stuart's life.  While BACKBEAT does, to some extent, fulfill
both of these goals, it does neither to full advantage.  When the film
works, it's because the two purposes complement each other; when it
fails, it's because they are at odds.</P>
<P>     Mr. Softley uses an almost-documentary style of filmmaking,
complete with unusual camera angles and often-dark settings, to bring
home the immediacy of his motion picture.  This is successful more
often than not, but it could be argued that this method aids in further
distancing the characters from the audience.</P>
<P>     Music--rock 'n roll in particular--saturates BACKBEAT.  It has
the most thunderous soundtrack since that of THE COMMITMENTS and, if
marketed right, will sell tons of CDs and tapes.  Nevertheless, all the
visual and audio flare--and the tremendous energy that goes with
them--can't quite make up for those elements where the film is found
lacking.</P>
<P>     What makes it even more surprising that the characters have such
little magnetism is that, for the most part, the actors portraying them
do excellent jobs.  Other than having a somewhat variable accent,
Stephen Dorff is fine as Stu Sutcliffe and, excepting a single
over-the-top scene, TWIN PEAKS Sheryl Lee does a credible job playing
Astrid. Ian Hart gives an amazingly energetic and powerful rendering of
John Lennon.</P>
<P>     Movies like BACKBEAT are often the most difficult for me to
review.  I recognize the craft used in making the film, I admire the
intent, and I like the music.  The problem is, the characters don't
grab me, and the story meanders a little too much to limit the
importance of these minimalist personalities.  Many will doubtless feel
differently, especially those with a special interest in the early days
of the Fab Four.</P>
<P>     Regardless of how BACKBEAT is received, certain things about the
Beatles are immutable, including their history and their music.  It's
too bad this film didn't do as good a job capturing the other elements
surrounding the group as they did those two aspects.</P>
