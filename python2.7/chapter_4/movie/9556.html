<PRE>                           A SELF MADE HERO
                        (UN HEROS TRES DISCRET)
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     As World War II draws to a close, Albert Dehousse (Mathieu
Kassovitz), a simple salesman in occupied France, dreams of having been
something more important.  And turning dreams into reality, he
convinces his countrymen that he was actually a valiant member of the
French Resistance.  With a few facts and a lot of chutzpah, he succeeds
beyond his wildest dreams.  He becomes such an enormous and mysterious
hero that people begin doting on his every word.</P>
<P>     If A SELF MADE HERO (UN HEROS TRES DISCRET) sounds like a hundred
other films (Tony Curtis's THE GREAT IMPOSTOR and Peter Sellers's BEING
THERE come immediately to mind), it is.  The difference is in the
execution.  The script by Jacques Audiard and Alain Le Henry, based on
the novel by Jean-Francois Deniau, confuses the viewers by swirling a
host of supporting characters past them in a blur.  The first half of
the film is hopelessly muddled with the latter half being relatively
better.</P>
<P>     Exacerbating the problems of the narrative, Jean-Marc Fabre's
cinematography pans the camera in a constant twirl, and most of the
first half is so dark that it is hard to see the expressions on the
actors' faces.  Juliette Welfling's erratic editing adds to the overall
obfuscation.  Even the editing of the newsreel footage is so choppy
that it becomes difficult ascertaining what is happening.</P>
<P>     All of this notwithstanding, the premise of the show has great
promise.  The film, which garnered many French cinematic awards last
year, has taken over a year to get a U.S. distributor.</P>
<P>     Although the film spends much of the time trying to be humorous,
it rarely succeeds.  It works better in its serious moments, but its
attempts at poignancy are muted by the chaos of the storyline.</P>
<P>     In the later part of the film, Albert emerges from the story's
cloudy beginning.  But by then, your interest in this much told tale
may have waned.</P>
<P>     A SELF MADE HERO runs 1:47.  It is in French with English
subtitles.  The movie is not rated but would be an R for war carnage,
brief nudity, and a little profanity.  The film would be fine for
teenagers.</P>
