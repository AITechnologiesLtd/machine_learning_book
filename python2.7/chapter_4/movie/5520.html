<P>     Once upon a time, Quentin Tarantino was a hot writer/director.  His 
first and second films, RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION, wowed audiences 
worldwide, and made him a "can't-miss" commodity.  Then, for some 
reason, he decided to concentrate on acting.  Problem:  he can't act.  
That didn't stop him, so movie-goers have been forced to endure 
Tarantino mugging for the camera in such titles as DESTINY TURNS ON THE 
RADIO, FOUR ROOMS, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, and DESPERADO.  Not content with 
writing, directing, and acting, Tarantino decided that he wanted to get 
into the film releasing business.  So was born Rolling Thunder, a 
Miramax imprint.  The first film released under this label was CHUNGKING 
EXPRESS, a sublimely thoughtful (if somewhat confusing) import.  No such 
praise can be heaped upon SWITCHBLADE SISTERS, Rolling Thunder entry #2.  
A 1975 exploitation dud, this is the kind of movie Cinemax screens late 
at night.  It's not just bad, it's execrable.  If this is the kind of 
flick that Tarantino enjoyed while working at the video store, it's 
amazing that RESERVOIR DOGS turned out so well.</P>
<P>     The plot of SWITCHBLADE SISTERS, such as it is, involves gang wars 
and in-fighting between the girls of the Dagger Debs (who are renamed 
the Jezebels mid-way through the film).  These Switchblade Sisters have 
at least three problems:  a rival gang leader (with the unforgettable 
name of Crabs) who wants them dead, a traitor in their midst, and a pair 
of cops (or, in the language of the day, pigs) who are waiting to bust 
them.  The two lead Jezebels, Lace (Robbie Lee) and Maggie (Joanne 
Nail), are fighting over the same guy, Silver Daggers stud-leader, Dom 
(Asher Brauner), who knocks up one of them and forces himself on the 
other.  Strangely, however, when Dom gets blown away by a blast from 
Crabs' gun, both Lace and Maggie want to waste Crabs, instead of shaking 
his hand.  </P>
<P>     Leather and lace.  Studded boots and bell bottoms.  An electro-
disco score.  Roller skating rinks.  Afros.  SWITCHBLADE SISTERS reeks 
of the worst excesses of the '70s.  Calling it dated is an 
understatement.  This is the kind of film that '90s movies delight in 
parodying.  There's a certain campy value to a production like this 
(especially twenty years later), but only for about the first thirty 
minutes.  Then things get repetitive and dull.  This movie is too 
lifeless and amateurish to be enjoyable for long.  If you want good, 
well-made, high-energy camp, check out any of Russ Meyer's films.  Meyer 
(FASTER, PUSSYCAT!  KILL! KILL!) made good bad stuff.  Director Jack 
Hill (who was also responsible for THE SWINGING CHEERLEADERS) 
specialized in bad bad movies.</P>
<P>     This is one of those rare movies where every member of the cast 
turns in an unbearably bad performance.  There isn't anything remotely 
competent about any of the actors.  The only one I recognized was Asher 
Brauner -- I think he was in a soap opera during the late '70s.  Robbie 
Lee has a helium voice that is reminiscent of fingernails scraping 
across a blackboard.  Joanne Nail looks like she could have been one of 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS (according to the production notes, she turned down the 
opportunity).  All the actors literally snarl every line of dialogue.  
Then again, if I had to say the kind of inane lines they're given, I 
might be in a snarling mood, too.</P>
<P>     One of the most laughable aspects of this film is that all the 
characters are supposed to be high school students, but the oldest 
actors are pushing 30.  I guess some of them got held back a few times.  
There's a classic catfight where the Dagger Debs do battle with a nasty 
prison matron.  During the tussle, we get a pretty good look at a 
stuntman in a wig.  Maybe this scene inspired a similar moment in Keenan 
Ivory Wayans' I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA.  And, of course, there's also the 
gratuitous topless scene, when one of the girls gets her shirt ripped 
off.</P>
<P>     I won't completely dismiss this as celluloid tripe.  For those who 
are inexplicably infatuated with the '70s, SWITCHBLADE SISTERS gives a 
glimpse of a different aspect of the era's pop culture than what is 
typically portrayed through nostalgia-tinged lenses.  It's cheap, 
tawdry, and practically unwatchable, but some viewers will undoubtedly 
enjoy it -- after all, Tarantino can't be the only SWITCHBLADE SISTERS 
fan, can he?  For my money, I'd prefer sitting through just about 
anything else currently playing in theaters -- even THE CABLE GUY.  
SWITCHBLADE SISTERS doesn't cut it on any level.</P>
