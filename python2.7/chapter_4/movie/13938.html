<PRE>Snake Eyes
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2</PRE>
<P>Personal morals live in a foggy area. Sins for one person are virtues for
another. What would be wrong at one time becomes acceptable under different
circumstances. Our youthful idealism is often compromized as life goes on.
Stealing is dishonest, but there's that proverbial loaf of bread and starving
family. And so it goes. Situational ethics can be a slippery slope and
sometimes there's a deciding moment where a decision must be made.</P>
<P>Atlantic City police detective Nick Santoro (Nicolas Cage) has slid down that
slope about as far as he can. The archetypal corrupt cop, he doesn't just look
the other way, he is the other way. He shakes down a drug dealer, puts big
money on a prize fight, accepts thousands of dollars in bribes and has a
girlfriend that his wife doesn't know about. Strutting about in a Hawaiian
shirt like the loud fast-talking cock of the walk, his ambition is to become
mayor of his "sewer"  of a town. He's not worried about consequences, because
"If there's one thing I know, it's how to cover my ass."</P>
<P> Clean-cut Navy Commander Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise) has invited his old buddy
Santoro to the heavyweight fight where Dunne is head of security for the
Secretary Of Defense who is also in attendance.</P>
<P>The action is fast and furious. Hurricane Jezebel rages through the streets
while boxer Lincoln Tyler (Stan Shaw) is defending his title.Dunne is
distracted by a red-head with deep cleavage who doesn't seem "right" and
leaves to follow her. A buxom (this attribute seems as common as poker chips
in the city) blonde sits next to Santoro and turns to talk to the Secretary.
The champ is felled by a phantom blow. Shots ring out from across the arena.
The Secretary is hit. The blonde catches a bullet in the shoulder and flees in
a blood-splattered white blouse. More shots and the assassin falls, dead,
through shattered glass.</P>
<P>Dunne and Santoro take charge of the investigation after bullying the state
officials and lock 14,000 people in the building. It seems that the killer is
a lone gunman, a nutcase political terrorist with a history of making threats. </P>
<P>It all falls into place quickly but it's a little too easy for the detective.
Something just doesn't make sense to him. He has hung out with enough of them
to know exactly what a rat smells like. Things are not what they seem. People
are not what they seem. Even the blonde is not what she seems.</P>
<P>Most of the actors over-play their roles, but that's part of the
entertainment. Cage is enjoyable in his bigger than life character. He's been
this person before and has the part down. Sinise does well although Dunne is a
bit too stiff to believe. Carla Gugino plays the mysterious faux blonde with a
quirky style that is easy to warm up to.</P>
<P>Taking place in almost real time, the movie doesn't give us a chance to
breathe. If you look away for a few seconds, you're likely to miss important
details. But don't worry, not watching is the last thing the audience will do
as the action jumps off the screen. The film never stops moving.</P>
<P>Veteran director Brian DePalma knows how to set a mood. Beginning with a
single twenty-minute shot of Santoro swaggering through the arena, the camera
is definitely the star of the show. Liberally using a subjective point of
view, he shows us the events through the eyes of several of the participants.
Each gives more clues as to what actually happened. There's a magnificent shot
from the ceiling that slowly moves from hotel room to hotel room. We see empty
rooms, an out-of-control party, intimate moments and finally a blonde washing
blood out of a white top.</P>
<P>There is an interesting point where duty, loyalty and personal ambitions come
into conflict. One of the characters knows the right thing to do. He also
knows the best thing for him. Unfortunately these are not the same. If there
is a theme to the film, this is it. When do you put aside your personal
interests for the benefit of others and the salvation of your own soul?</P>
<P>The scenes are so well constructed and the energy so frenzied that it's easy
to overlook the film's flaws. Until the ending. There are problems before
this. Although the true killer is revealed too soon, it's still great fun But
then there's that last ten minutes.</P>
<P>Without giving too much away, the film completely falls apart. The situation
is dire. Santoro is so beat up he can hardly walk, but he's attempting to save
the damsel in distress. The real killer is following him to eliminate his last
few witnesses. She's locked in a storage room and can't get out. The storm is
worse and explosions from the sky overwhelm the sound track. Electricity
sputters in the wet streets. The situation is tense.</P>
<P>And then? And then, events occur that have nothing to do with anything that
has happened previously and solve everything. Deus ex machina is a technique
used in poor novels and it doesn't work any better in films.</P>
<P>To make matters worse, there's another ending tacked on: a "several days"
later where one of the bad good guys gets his just desserts. If that's not
enough, there's yet another ending after that to provide the happy resolution
that Hollywood thinks audiences need.</P>
<P>Like far too many films, this could have been excellent with just a little
care. As it is, you'll have a good time during ninety percent of the movie,
but you'll leave saying "What were they thinking?"</P>
