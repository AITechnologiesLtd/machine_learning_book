"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Imagine Hollywood had something similar to baseball^Òs Hall of Fame and
that retired/dead stars had to have their entire careers summarized in a
brief paragraph on a bronze plaque hanging in an overpriced tourist
attraction somewhere in Los Angeles. What the heck would Bruce Willis^Ò
plaque say? Would it mention his great work in edgy films like Pulp
Fiction and Twelve Monkeys? Probably not. Would the plaque list the
actor^Òs popular action films like Die Hard and Armageddon? Maybe, but
this is probably how Willis^Ò plaque would read:</P>
<P>^ÓBorn in West Germany, ^ÑBruno^Ò made the successful leap from bartender
to television^Òs Moonlighting to feature films in the late 1980s. Willis
was best known for starring opposite talented child actors and providing
the voices for infants. He was married to actress Demi Moore for ten
years, and the two superstars had three kids with really dumb names^Ô</P>
<P>Okay, the last part might not make it on there, but you get the point.
Despite having a pretty eclectic resumé, Willis^Ò career may be
remembered this way. Why? Because the following mathematical formula is
the hottest thing in Hollywood: ^ÓWillis + pre-pubescent boy + clever
script = box office gold^Ô</P>
<P>The movie with the kid who could see dead people made how much money?
Quick, let^Òs get Willis in something else with a kid right away. The
result is Disney^Òs The Kid, a whimsical tale about a grumpy workaholic
that gets in touch with the kid he used to be by actually meeting the
kid he used to be. That^Òs right; through some sort of kooky Freaky
Friday movie magic, the grouch actually meets himself at age seven.</P>
<P>Willis (The Whole Nine Yards) plays Russell Morley Duritz, an
over-stressed image consultant with a twitchy left eye. The Kid^Òs first
five minutes sets up Russell as a maniacal jerk that shuns his own
family but helps his crooked, high-profile clients look better in the
public^Òs eye. Though this is supposed to make Russell an unsympathetic
character, I couldn^Òt help but think that the world would be a better
place with more people like him. He^Òs smart, efficient and cuts through
the bull with a blunt honesty that comes off as rude and arrogant. If
saying things that are on your mind is a bad thing, then lock me up.</P>
<P>A few days before his fortieth birthday, Russell begins seeing some
strange things. A red bi-plane seems to be following him around and a
snot-nosed kid appears in his house, somehow evading his
state-of-the-art security system. At first, he thinks he^Òs hallucinating
the whole thing, but after comparing scars and birthmarks, he realizes
that the kid, Rusty (Spencer Breslin from the short-lived Dan Ackroyd
sitcom Soul Man), is really himself from thirty-two years ago.</P>
<P>The rest of The Kid involves Russell hating Rusty and trying to get rid
of him, but eventually growing attached to the boy and learning a little
bit about himself in the process before the film winds down to a
two-hankie finale that should choke up anyone that has recently had a
pulse. I^Òm sure The Kid will hit home with anyone under age twelve or
over age forty, but everybody else might just roll their eyes at the
films sentimentality, which is hammered home by South Park musical
collaborator Marc Shaiman^Òs sweeping score.</P>
<P>Breslin is a revelation as young Rusty, who shrieks his disappointment
that he grows up to be wife-less, dog-less and cool-job-less. Willis
plays a pretty good tight-ass but looks like he^Òs having way too much
fun doing it. There are times when Willis is barely able to stifle his
smirk when he^Òs supposed to be miserable. He did nasty and irritable
much better with General William Devereaux in The Siege. Willis^Ò
apparent new best friend Matthew Perry makes a funny unbilled cameo, as
well.</P>
<P>The Kid^Òs script, which was written by Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award
winner Audrey Wells (Guinevere), is pretty clever for a family film, but
it had a bunch of problems, too. Russell spends his whole life trying to
distance himself from his past, yet somehow has totally forgotten the
most traumatic event that ever happened to him. And the film is dragged
down a bit by the romance between Russell and his perky moralistic
sidekick (played by British waif Emily Mortimer, Love^Òs Labour^Òs Lost).
She^Òs not even the best match for Russell. He would have been better off
with his wisecracking personal assistant (Lily Tomlin, Tea With
Mussolini) or a local television news anchor (Jean Smart from Wells^Ò
Guinevere).</P>
<P>The Kid was directed by Jon Turteltaub, who has helmed such
non-kid-friendly films as Instinct and Phenomenon. It plays pretty
similarly to a couple of films that have already come out this year,
especially the arthouse release of Pip Karmel^Òs Me Myself I, where
Rachel Griffiths goes through a similar ordeal on her thirtieth
birthday. You know, movies like these are the reason people dread the
big 3-0 and 4-0 (and beyond). They aren^Òt upset about getting older ^Ö
they^Òre worried about having to meet themselves.</P>
