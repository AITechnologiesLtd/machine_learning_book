<P>KIKUJIRO (Kikujro no natsu) (Japan, 1999) ***. Directed, written, 
edited by Takeshi Kitano. Photography, Katsumi Yanagishima. Art 
editor, Norihiro Isoda. Music, Joe Hisaishi. Cast: Beat Takeshi 
(Kikujiro), Yusuke Sekiguchi (Masao), et al.  In Japanese, with 
subtitles. A Sony release. 116 minutes. PG-13.</P>
<P>Takeshi Kitano (b. 1947) is now probably the best-known media person 
in Japan. He started out in a comedy-club stand-up duo "The Two 
Beats" which went on to television. "Beat Takeshi," became one of the 
names Kitano uses as an actor. He then became a TV superstar ( to 
this day he appears in 8 programs a week),  a movie actor and a 
director-writer-editor as well as a literary person and a cartoonist 
and painter,  Some of his art work can be seen in "Kikujiro."  The 
Kitano cult in Japan  roughly approximates the American enthusiasm 
for Quentin Tarantino, with whom Kitano superficially shares violence 
and cool. But Kitano consciously changes styles.  He prefaces the 
notes on "Kikujiro" with this statement::</P>
<P>"After 'Hana-Bi' ['Fireworks'] I couldn't help feeling that my films 
were being stereotyped: 'gangster, violence, life and death.' It 
becomes difficult for me to identify with them.  So I decided to try 
and make a film no one would expect from me. To tell the truth, the 
story of this film belongs to a genre which is outside my specialty. 
But I decided to make this film because it would be a challenge for 
me to cope with this ordinary story and try to make it my very own 
through my direction, and I tried lots of experiments with imagery. I 
think it ended up being a very strange film with my trademark all 
over it. I hope to continue upsetting people's expectations in a 
positive way."</P>
<P>The genre Kitano refers to is the old one about a kid bonding with an 
adult. The many reviewers of "Kikujiro" have mentioned a plethora of 
titles. although no one seems to remember one of the best, the French 
"The Two of Us." The reviews have been overall middling to negative, 
which is unfair.</P>
<P>Summer holidays finds Tokyo schoolboy Masao at loose ends, bereft of 
pals and things to do. He is also bereft of a mother. She's stepped 
out of his life long ago, left him with his grandma, a working woman, 
yet regularly sends money for the kid. Masao is nine, a bit fat by 
Japanese standards, a bit short by American standards, a bit moody 
and pretty quiet by any standards. He decides to go and visit his 
mother.</P>
<P> From this point on the spectator must forget about realism, 
verissimilitude and logic. Grandma has a friend whose middle-aged 
husband Kikujiro is a fellow who strikes rough poses, is gruff, 
insulting and aggressive, but probably has a heart of deeply hidden 
gold. The wife orders him to accompany the kid's peregrinations, so 
that we get a sort of road movie with semi-picaresque sides.</P>
<P>The film is, depending on your reactions, slow, leisurely, with an 
oriental tempo (whatever that is), sweet, full of chutzpah (amply 
provided by Kikujiro), improbable, absurd but nice, absurd and 
irritating, charming but predictable, charming and full of surprises, 
unreal, surreal, silly, dull, quietly exciting and inventive, and so 
on...</P>
<P>I will not get into details, descriptions or even an outline. My own 
reaction to the movie is most positive. I like its quiet surprises, a 
great deal of subtly humorous inventions, a few cliches and many 
anti-cliches, the rough but not objectionable edges, sparse dialogue, 
and its originality disguised as deja vu. The main annoyance is not 
the story but a simple, very nice jazz-like music score (piano and 
strings) by the director's pal and collaborator. This gets repeated 
so incredibly often that with all due respect to the most talented 
Kitano, you wonder about his musical ear. Otherwise, this movie is 
one that I enjoyed at the 1999 Cannes Festival and which I just saw 
again with undiminished pleasure.</P>
