 Director: Malcolm D. Lee    
 Writer:   Malcolm D. Lee
 Cast: Monica Calhoun, Morris Chestnut, Melissa DeSousa,
Taye Diggs, Terrence Dashon Howard, Sanaa Lathan, Nia
Long, Harold Perrineau Jr.</P>
<P>   Like "How Stella Got Her Groove Back," this film is yet
another story of the romantic woes of members of the
African-American middle class.  None of the characters in
Malcolm D. Lee's "The Best Man" have money problems and
so all can concentrate on backbiting and expressing doubts
about sentimental subjects like fidelity and commitment.  The
movie stars Taye Diggs, who got a fortuitous start in the
business as the 20-year-old med school hopeful being
romanced by a 40-year-old San Francisco stockbroker in
Kevin Rodney Sullivan's aforementioned "Stella."  As then,
Diggs, who appears to have a stellar career ahead of him,
gets plenty of opportunities to display his muscular physique. 
Too much time, in fact, as "The Best Man," at just under two
hours, wears out its welcome considerably before its superior
final third, the point in which all problems are resolved and
the principal couples--kept apart for most of the movie's
elongated duration--are solidly bound together as is the
custom with by-the-numbers romantic comedies.</P>
<P>   The wholly predictable tale, which evokes scant laughter
from situations flattened by repetition, focuses on a group of
educated men and women in their twenties who, as you
might expect, talk endlessly about their love lives and jive
each other on the mistakes made in the past which have
come to haunt them.  The title character at the center of the
tale, Harper (Taye Diggs), has just published his first novel
called "Unfinished Business," which is a thinly disguised
account of the people in his life.  (Strangely enough, though
this is Harper's first contribution to the literary world, the
newly published tome is already in paperback.)  Like many
pieces of fiction, the work simply disguises the names of the
characters but extracts actual circumstances that befall them. 
This is the sort of book that gets the real-life people on whom
it is based downright angry, exposing intimate details of their
lives including the liaisons that they are not supposed to have
had.  The principal revelation that sets Harper's circle of
friends fuming and threatens their love lives involves an
alleged one-night stand that he had had with Mia (Monica
Calhoun, who is about to marry Harper's best friend, college
football star Lance (Morris Chestnut).  </P>
<P>   One gets the impression from Lee's film that the men are
irresistible, judging by the way their women dote on them
despite their straying.  Ironically the person most upset by the
possibility that his fiance has not been faithful to him is a
male, Lance, who can't put Harper's book down once he
realizes the true-to-life nature of the work--especially since it
hints of the relationship that Harper had with the woman he is
about to marry.  </P>
<P>   Some of the genial personalities who inhabit Lee's movie
are Jordan (Nia Long), a workaholic former flame of Harper's,
who calls herself a horny nutbasket and is determined to bed
the upcoming author; Murch (Harold Perrineau Jr.), a shy
member of the circle who gets lucky at a bachelor party;
Quentin (Terrence Dashon Howard), who is quite talented
with the guitar but seems to be aimless; and Shelby (Melissa
DeSousa), a whiner who needs convincing that she likes men
at all.  </P>
<P>   Lee takes us through a swinging bachelor party, a couple
of fights, and a whole lot of rap sessions that the guys hold
about women.  I was surprised to hear how many times the
"n" word gets used--not out of hostility of course, but in the
mocking way that some African-Americans have treated the
word for over a decade.  Considering the level of education of
these fellows, this particular obscenity would seem to have
no place and is particularly annoying even when used in an
obviously playful manner.  "The Best Man" offers nothing new
on the subject of male bonding and the endless roundelay of
discussions of the opposite sex.</P>
