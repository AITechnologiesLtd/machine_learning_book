<PRE>THE YARDS
A film review by Norm Schrager

<P>The Yards begins with a rebirth of sorts.  A subway train emerges from a
tunnel into daylight.  It is carrying Leo Handler (Mark Wahlberg) out of
the darkness and home, after spending time in prison.  He has taken the
rap for an auto theft circle, one including close buddy Willie (Joaquin
Phoenix), and is returning to a grateful homecoming.  But The Yards is a
dark crime drama, and Leo's future doesn't remain in the light for long
in James Gray's impressive, classically styled mini-saga.</P>
<P>Gray, recently appearing with The Yards at the Boston Film Festival,
based his tale of New York City subway vendor corruption on his own
father's experiences.  The filmmaker has given us a well-composed
script, deftly flowing through intertwining relations of families,
friends, enemies, and politicians.  He sustains a hopelessly dim design
throughout the film, even having the mind to steal wonderfully from a
few Godfather scenes (he claims by accident), and lifting Gordon Willis'
outstanding cinematography with his DP, Harris Savides (on purpose). 
Gray's direction gives us an overriding sense of doom that retains
suspense far beyond that of a second-time filmmaker (his first being
1994's grim Little Odessa).  But all that is nothing without Mark
Wahlberg.</P>
<P>The movie world is finally becoming convinced that Wahlberg can tackle
just about any role and carry an entire picture if need be.  Initially,
he had to sell himself to Gray, assuring him that having done jail time
himself, he "gets it" and could make Leo his own.</P>
<P>Instead of playing the streetwise punk that Gray may have first
envisioned, Wahlberg nails a more sympathetic Leo -- tough, proud,
loyal, uneducated -- all with a pinpoint conservation of emotion and
energy.  He walks through most of The Yards in a daze, not knowing how
to handle a larcenous offer but sliding into it anyway, slowly
contemplating his moves after one particularly disastrous jam.</P>
<P>When Wahlberg finally stages a fistfight with another actor, it has an
explosive feel, as if we've been tensing up for the entire movie right
along with him, staying quiet and pensive, and finally letting it out. 
Wahlberg knew well enough to keep the tone way down, and Gray was smart
enough to take advantage of it.</P>
<P>If Wahlberg is great casting, the company as a whole is inspired:  James
Caan as a crooked company boss (he finally gets to play the Don!), Ellen
Burstyn as Leo's ailing mother, Charlize Theron as Leo's cousin, Faye
Dunaway as Caan's well-to-do wife, the raw, talented Joaquin Phoenix as
the buddy, and the piece de resistance, crooner Steve Lawrence as the
Queens borough President.  (The first time Lawrence appears on screen,
Gray makes him look like a typical movie mobster, not only creating a
surprise in casting, but making a telling statement between crime and
politics.)  This cadre performs like a team.  They come together easily
to work the flow of cross-conversation and ad lib, and they make the
more structured scenes click like clockwork.</P>
<P>Moments of slick predictability aside, Gray uses that cast to create a
classic tragedy, taking eternal themes from some of history's great
storytelling.  While that always carries with it a sense of timelessness
and honor, Gray adds the kind of design and style that make The Yards
his own, and casts Mark Wahlberg in an increasingly more impressive
light.  Highly recommended.</P>
