<P>    I shouldn't have to review this film.  Don't get me wrong -- The Faculty
rocks -- but anyone with a half of an IQ point should know that.  Think
about it.  Look at who wrote it, look at who directed it.  Admit it, we all
loved Scream, Scream 2, and IKWYDLS.  And Desperado kicked ass.  So why
should I have to bother telling you why the collaboration between the writer
of Scream and the director of Desperado is the best horror movie of the
year.
Not that the competition is high: ISKWYDLS sucked.  But, compared to that
film, The Faculty is still light years ahead.</P>
<P>    The Faculty has the same plot as The Puppet Masters: parasites are
taking over the Earth.  This time, however, they sneak in through the back
door of Ohio and start taking over a high school in an unnamed football
town.  And six kids (an anti-social girl, the school nerd, a new girl from
Georgia, the editor of the newspaper which has more scandal than The Drudge
Report, the ex-quarterback, and the high school drug dealer) have to stop
the aliens from taking over the planet.</P>
<P>    As always with Williamson, whom I believe to be a satirist with
proportion to a script-writer Kurt Vonnegut, he is setting his sights on
something to parody.  This time, it's the all-too-cheesy and idiotic sci-fi
films.  He points out to all of us just how stupid Independence Day was, how
much Invasion of the Body Snatchers was a rip-off, and how the monsters
always die from the dumbest things (In Puppet Masters, it was a brain
disease.  In The Faculty, it's caffeine).  This alone would have been cool
enough for me.  But, no, they stuck Rodreguiz behind the camera.</P>
<P>    Now I hated From Dusk till Dawn, but I loved this one.  He continues his
love affair with the stedicam as he takes the first major scene of the film
in a roughly 7-minute tracking shot.  He follows the victims during the
chase scenes with great precision that rivals John Carpenter's skill.  He
goes to slow-motion at just the right moment, edits his film until all the
errors are tweaked out, and uses our fear of the unknown as good as
Speilberg did in Jaws.</P>
<P>    Now I go to the flaws for all of you who haven't left and seen the movie
already: the script is as predictable as any you've seen.  The "queen" alien
is known to you after the first thirty minutes.  The dialogue sucks.  The
performances are atrocious.  But, like I said with Blade: to hell with all
that.  Have some fun.</P>
