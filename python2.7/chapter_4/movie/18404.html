<P>8MM (EIGHT MILLIMETER)
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *** (out of ****)
Columbia / 2:06 / 1999 / R (language, violence, subject matter, glimpses 
of nudity and sexual depravity)
Cast: Nicolas Cage; Joaquin Phoenix; James Gandolfini; Peter Stormare; 
Anthony Heald; Chris Bauer; Catherine Keener; Myra Carter; Amy Morton 
Director: Joel Schumacher 
Screenplay: Andrew Kevin Walker <HR>Any collaboration between the scribe of "Seven" and the director of 
"Batman & Robin" pretty much guarantees a high curio factor, and that 
interest level is the most telling trait to trumpet in "8mm." Andrew 
Kevin Walker, best known for penning that grim mini-masterpiece, and 
Joel Schumacher, best known for a grim mini-masterpiece himself - 1993's 
"Falling Down" - before allegedly killing the "Batman" franchise, brand 
this disturbingly downbeat chiller with assorted elements from their 
respective bits of feel-bad cinema. A disgusting murder here, a hero 
driven to the edge by societal decay there - what's not to grit your 
teeth during? </P>
<P>Like a recipe assembled from scraps of other dishes, "8mm" is less than 
the sum of its parts, delicious to fans of the dark and brooding though 
they may be. But, oh, does this two-hour-plus ode to unpleasantness make 
good on its engaging creative pairing, while a further boost is given by 
the casting of Nicolas Cage in the lead, one of those progressively 
unhinged roles the Oscar-winner excels at playing. The hot-button 
subject matter - pornography - should determine whether uncertain 
potential viewers will love it or leave it early, though you can 
probably already tell from this description alone if this is your kind 
of movie. </P>
<P>That Cage stars as a private dick in a film that heavily incorporates 
the adult entertainment industry is worth a small chuckle, but this 
possible in-joke is close to the extent of "8mm"'s humor quotient. Like 
"Seven," the story is played with almost no comic relief, yet another 
cause of probable diminishing audience appreciation. (Then again, that 
didn't stop "Seven" from being a $100 million hit, but that movie only 
fleetingly relied on sexual violence.) Those seeking cheap, explicit 
thrills are better off visiting a seedy video store somewhere, however, 
because Schumacher knows that the unseen is far more terrifying than 
what's in plain view. </P>
<P>Cage's professional sleuth goes by the name Tom Welles and has just 
accepted a case from the widow (Myra Carter) of a recently deceased and 
immensely wealthy steel tycoon. While going through his private things, 
she located a reel of eight millimeter stock on which a young girl is 
raped and murdered by a creep wearing a leather mask. Yowza. But is it 
an actual snuff film or something feigned to give perverts their 
jollies? And how did it come to be in this rich guy's belongings? Those 
are the questions Welles gets bankrolled to answer, and he starts by 
identifying the alleged victim and tracing her back to her hometown. </P>
<P>There, he meets her mother (Amy Morton) but not her, and these scenes, 
perfectly handled by Schumacher, are a powerful reminder that every 
missing child is more than just a statistic. This'll have to do - and it 
does - for "8mm"'s emotional content, because Welles' relationship with 
his wife (nice work from Catherine Keener) and his new baby are somewhat 
ill-defined. That flaw hardly matters, though, because "8mm" devotes 
much of its attention on Welles' unfolding, engrossing search for the 
truth, and if you can make it through some of the early scenes without 
the need to exit the theatre, you'll be OK for the long run. </P>
<P>Without giving away too much, Welles' trail leads him into the seamy 
world of underground sleaze, and needless to say, it isn't a pretty 
place. The seedy ground he covers with a porn clerk (game Joaquin 
Phoenix), his only ally, begins to transform him, though it's no fair to 
say in what ways. Plot twists are guaranteed; some are predictable, some 
are not, and an example of the latter is a disturbing climax (one of 
several) that takes place in a rain-soaked graveyard, complete with 
vivid flashes of lightning. Perhaps Schumacher's gorgeously gaudy 
"Batman" takes prove he isn't one for restraint, but the stylish 
overkill of "8mm" works more often than it doesn't. </P>
<P>He does, however, treat the whole porn/snuff area with moderation - and 
thankfully so. We're treated only to fleeting glimpses (the worst 
depicts a "nurse" preparing to do something to a "patient" that probably 
isn't covered on his HMO), but we get a strong enough reading of their 
explicit content from Cage's bountiful terrified - but eventually 
desensitized - reaction shots. Those who appreciate this dissection of 
humanity's dark side can wonder what sort of dreams Andrew Kevin Walker 
has while they wait for his next screenplay. This much appears to be a 
given: It'll be solemn, it'll be somber, and it'll have some form of the 
number nine in its title.<HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck
