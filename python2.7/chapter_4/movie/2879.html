<PRE>                                 TIMECOP
                                [Spoilers]
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Jean-Claude Van Damme is a
     policeman charged with stopping time travel related
     crime.  He is on the trail of a politician played by Ron
     Silver who travels back from 2004 to steal and to change
     history.  This is a nice looking film, particularly in
     its 1920s sets, but what Van Damme does to the villains
     is about what the script does to logic.  Rating: low +1
     (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It is 1863 and a shipment of gold for the Confederacy is stolen by
a highwayman sporting a laser-guided machine gun.  This is a time
travel crime and that makes it particularly dangerous since even a
small change to the past could completely change the future.  That is
why the government has created the Time Enforcement Commission or TEC.
And one of its chief operatives is Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme).
The TEC is watched over by Senator McComb (Ron Silver).  But McComb has
been seduced by the power time travel gives and is hatching his own
illegal plans to make himself President.  Walker knows his chief enemy
is the Senator who controls his agency.  But his efforts are sabotaged
by widespread corruption in the TEC going back to McComb.  Complicating
things, now he is saddled with an inexperienced partner, Fielding
(played by Gloria Reuben), and he would rather be working alone.  (Gee,
what an original plot complication!)  Walker must go back with Fielding
to 1994, that pivotal year when i) the TEC was founded, ii) mysterious
thugs killed Walker's wife (Mia Sara), and iii) McComb got control ofa
major high-TEC and high-tech corporation.  That 1994 must have been a
pretty exciting year to live!</P>
<P>     Like a lot of current films the look of TIMECOP seems to take
precedence over the acting or plot.  The film is directed by Peter
Hyams who proved in films like OUTLAND that he is much more into the
look of science fiction than the thought behind it.  In fact, he wears
an unusual pairing of hats on this film.  He is not just the director
of the film, he is also the director of photography and some of the
effects are effective.  Hyams uses a nice effect of warping space to
show people's arrival in a new time, though it looks related to the
invisibility effect in PREDATOR.  The rocket sled that launches time
travel is a bit melodramatic and the reason why this acceleration is
needed is never explained, unless it is some sort of tribute to BACK TO
THE FUTURE.  It does contribute to the effect of a film that is
generally fairly slickly mounted.  Not all of the visuals are as good,
however.  One false move is the production design of the 2004 cars,
which apparently have evolved to look almost like DAMNATION ALLEY
armored vehicles by 2004.  Certainly the look of cars is intended to
change more in the next ten years than it did in the last ten.</P>
<P>     Other script touches are about what one could expect.  There was
entirely too many fights for my taste, but after all, this is a Jean-
Claude Van Damme movie.  One could complain about the Bondisms--the
wisecracks after violent fights--but it seems that they have become</P>

<P>inseparable from action films.  There is some reasonable wit in the
film.  There is a nice bit connected with a piece of advice that that
McComb gives his younger self.  But the nicest quip is the choice of
end-title music.</P>
<P>     As an actor Jean-Claude Van Damme has playing an expert Belgian
kick-boxer down very well.  I suppose that is better than him not being
able to play an expert Belgian kick-boxer, but it still does not amount
to breadth.  For once he has co-stars who have previously been in films
that do not feature fighting.  Ron Silver is an actual actor in the
non-exploitation film sense.  He may not have a lot of real acting to
do here other than to seem sinister, but he at least does his villain
with dignified restraint.  Gloria Reuben and Mia Sara are along as co-
stars but neither of them have anything special to do in their roles.
Mia Sara has been around in films at least since FERRIS BEULLER'S DAY
OFF, Reuben is a relative newcomer, and each seems to do what the
script requires and avoids walking into furniture, but neither shows
any real flash.</P>
<P>     This is a film with too little science fictional thought and too
much karate kicking.  But parts are undeniably fun.  I give it a low +1
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<PRE>SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER</PRE>
<P>     Some of the concepts of TIMECOP should be discussed in an
evaluation of the film and I hope I don't come off like the film
reviewer (I think from the New York Times) whose review of DESTINATION
MOON said that it was absurd and that even the children in the audience
could tell the producers that in space rockets don't work because there
is nothing to push against.  Don't trust a film reviewer's knowledge,
including mine.</P>
<P>     Time enforcement is an old idea in science fiction harkening back
at least to Jack Williamson's LEGION OF TIME and Poul Anderson's TIME
PATROL.  Generally a feature of time travel stories are time paradoxes,
most of which hark from the paradox that a time traveler could go back
in time and kill his parents before they bear him.  Then he would never
have existed, so there would have been nobody to kill his parents.
Also often a feature of time travel stories are extra rules supposedly
fall out of the physics of time travel.  These may or may not bear
close scrutiny.  One that might make sense might be that an equal mass
has to be sent in the opposite direction in time or that you are
limited in the amount of magnetic metal that can go through time.
Rules often make less sense.  THE TERMINATOR assumed only living matter
can be sent.  No other physical phenomenon can detect living from non-
living matter, but I would be willing to give them the benefit of the
doubt if they just followed that rule.  But, of course various parts of
the human body like hair are not really living matter either.  If only
living matter went through time portals, a time traveler would arrive
at best bald.  THE TERMINATOR seemed to miss that detail and did not
shave Michael Biehn.</P>
<P>     TIMECOP shows signs that the authors thought about *having* rules
and paradoxes, but not much about the rules and paradoxes themselves.
The special rules include this concept that "the same object cannot
occupy the same place at the same time."  I think that the principle is
that different objects cannot do that.  But what generally happens
there is that they rebound off each other.  Technically speaking, the
same object ALWAYS occupies the same place at the same time.  Actually
the rule as applied in the film seems to be that is a time traveler
comes in contact with his previous self the two annihilated each other.
But you have very little matter in common with yourself of ten years
ago.  Nearly all (or is it actually all?) of the living matter in your
body from ten years ago has been replaced.  Even if that was not true
and there was some point on the surface that had not changed, you would
have to get those two points to come in contact.  It would not suffice
that your left hand from 1994 and your right shoulder from 2004 came in
contact.  This whole rule of annihilation is more a plot contrivance
than having anything much to do with logic.  It is like having vampires
killed by sunlight.</P>
<P>     Mike Richardson and Mark Verheiden don't actually seem to
understand what makes time paradoxes work.  In the film Fielding@2004
(if I may coin a notation) is killed in 1994.  Back in 2004 there is no
sign that Fielding lived that last decade from 1994 to 2004.  That
would be true if Fielding@1994 had been killed, but there seems not to
make sense as a result of Fielding@2004 being killed.  At the end of
the film Walker has nullified his whole reason to have gone to 1994 and
nobody remembers that he went.  But he obviously is returning from some
place.  Where do people think he is returning from?  And while I am
asking questions, how do you carbon-date gold?  And what does it even
mean to carbon-date gold?</P>
