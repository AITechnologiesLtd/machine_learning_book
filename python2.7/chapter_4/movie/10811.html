<P>  Detractors of Ayn Rand--and there are many--say that the
antidote to her allegedly malign ideals is her accent.  Just
listen to the heavy Russian overlay in the woman's speech
and you'll intuit she's more than a tough cookie,
but in reality a heavily armored person impervious to human
sentiment.  Is that what her philosophy, called "objectivism," is
all about? After all, she admits several times during this long,
well-edited documentary, that selfishness is the highest good! 
But to judge this philosophy by sound bites is to
misunderstand her view of the world.  To gain more than a
bumper-sticker impression of the woman, you'd want to read
a few of her novels, particularly her seminal work "Atlas
Shrugged."  The motion picture "Ayn Rand: A Sense of Self" 
which is directed, written and produced by Michael Paxton is
an introduction, which will serve its purpose if it motivates the
viewers to dip into her long works of fiction.</P>
<P>   "Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life," is not unusual for its genre.  It
displays clips of interviews the author gave to such luminaries
as Mike Wallace and Phil Donohue; some old black-and-white
footage of scenes in Russia, New York and Chicago; actual
clips from silent films and old talkies such as "Orphans of the
Storm," "The Beggar Student," "Canadian Capers"  "The
Fountainhead" and "King of Kings;" some filmed moments of
Ayn Rand in the company of Cecil B. DeMille, who had hired
her as an extra not long after her arrival from Russia; and
commentary from scholars who knew her work well, such as
Harry Binswanger, Daniel E. Greene, Leonard Peikoff and
John Ridpath; and some animation, particularly of railroad
cars.  In that sense it follows the path worn well by
documentaries in general.</P>
<P>   While considerable time has obviously been spent in
organizing the material, little is particularly original or
groundbreaking in the structure of this documentary. It follows
a chronological organization, beginning with the subject's birth
in 1905 in St. Petersburg, her voyage to America on a six-
months' visa (which she parlayed into American citizenship
courtesy of her marriage to actor Frank O'Connor), her
meeting with DeMille, which provided her with the funds
needed to survive, and her 1936 Broadway success "Night of
January 16th," which enabled her to give up her days jobs
and devote her time to writing.  </P>
<P>   If we were to try to sum up the main theme of this film in
one word, nay just one letter, it would be the letter "I."  Rand,
who was born Alyssa Rosenbaum, despised collectivism,
which she defines as the replacement of "I" with "we."   To
sacrifice one's self for the good of the state is anathema.  The
human being exists for his own happiness, and not for the
pleasure of others.  As an example, she cites the reality that I
do not marry out of guilt feelings for another or to make a
mate happy: I marry because I feel this partner can make ME
happy.  If my partner can make me happy, I will value him or
her more than I would value my neighbor, and would gladly
make sacrifices forthe  good of my significant other, because
such tribute would give ME a great sense of self-esteem and
thus make me happier.</P>
<P>   In a film of this length, Mr. Paxton would have done better
to spend more time with Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal,
Raymond Massey and Kent Smith. who portrayed characters
from her principal movie.  Perhaps a fifteen-minute interlude
from King Vidor's 1949 film "The Fountainhead" would give
the audience more insight into her world-view, that film
centering on an idealistic architect's clash with the
compromises of big business.  This movie is only marginally
successful in grappling with her ideas and the controversy
that emanated from their circulation.  We're all too likely to
leave the theater with oversimplified views such as "I don't go
for that woman: she's selfish" or "What's the big deal? You
can't compare her simple convictions with those of
Kierkegaard or Sorenson."  </P>
<P>   Still, "Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life," is likely to whet the thirst
of the curious in the audience to pick up "Atlas Shrugged,"
which still sells 100,000 copies annually, and to wade through
the eight-hundred odd pages if for no other reason than to
find out who is John Galt.  Not Rated.  Running time: 141
minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
