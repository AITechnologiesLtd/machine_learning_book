<PRE>"The Contender"</PRE>
<P>The Vice President of the United States is dead and President Jackson Evans
(Jeff Bridges) is being pressed from all sides to replace the deceased politico.
Governor Jack Hathaway (William Petersen) seems like a shoe-in for the nations
number two spot, especially after he performs a heroic rescue attempt while on a
fishing holiday. But, the president has different plans and unceremoniously
rejects Hathaway in favor of Senator Laine Billings Hanson (Joan Allen), who
could be the first female vice president, ever, in "The Contender."</P>
<P>Writer/director Rod Lurie takes on a subject that is reminiscent of the
political films of the 60's, especially Otto Preminger's "Advise and Consent."
The older film also dealt with a political appointment to a powerful government
post - Henry Fonda vying for the Secretary of State, then, versus Joan Allen
shooting for the VP slot now. The 1962 film was made at the height of the Red
Scare, so the plot revolved around the political morality of right against left,
with a strong, almost preachy, moral message. "The Contender" brings us into the
new millennium with a very different kind of political tale, but with a hint of
the ethics of a bygone era.</P>
<P>Lurie's screenplay cuts right to the chase from the start. Governor Hathaway's
vain but brave attempt to save a young woman from drowning makes him appear to
be the perfect nominee for VP. He's surprised, even shocked, when White House
Chief of Staff Kermit Newman declares that the rescue effort would be compared,
by the public, to Ted Kennedy and Chappaquidic. The president thanks him,
declares the governor "the future of the party," and nearly boots him out of the
Oval Office. Evans says, "I need a VP" and demands that Laine Hanson get the
nomination.</P>
<P>A woman vice president is a hard pill to swallow for those - men - in power.
Newman questions his boss's stubbornly held decision to back Hanson. Even more
formidable, senior Congressman Sheldon Runyon (Gary Oldman), who heads the
committee tasked to investigate the nominee, has his own agenda. Shelly knows,
in his heart, that Hanson is not the right person for the job that is a
heartbeat away from the presidency. He is joined by a freshman congressman,
Reginald Webster (Christian Slater), who is looking to make the right
connections and sees the senior politician as his means to an end. The search
for the dirt that will bury Laine's chances for VP begins in earnest.</P>
<P>Runyon's investigation of Hanson's past uncovers some sordid evidence from her
college days. The photos that come to the surface show a young woman who looks
like Laine performing sex with two men. Even as the photos are entered into the
official records of the committee hearing, they are leaked onto the Internet in
an effort to gain public opposition to Hanson's appointment. Sen. Hanson refuses
to even bother denying the accusations as they are beneath her dignity. As the
committee continues its inquisition of Hanson, Runyon tries to build upon his
accusation of sexual deviance by introducing questions about Laine's positions
on birth control, adultery, abortion and switching political parties. Hanson
maintains her unshakable dignity throughout as the political intrigues build
around her.</P>
<P>It's not just hearings and smutty pictures, though, as Lurie builds his
characters into complex people. Good and bad are not simple concepts and there
is complexity in the minds and hearts of the characters. Actually, the talented
cast puts flesh on the bones of his characters, giving each a nuance that make
them unique individual. This is not a film that draws its images and people in
black and white.</P>
<P>Joan Allen, for the first time in all of her respectable career, is the center
of attention in "The Contender" and she proves her capability as a first rate
actor quite able to control the center stage. Even though there is "proof" of
her sexual indiscretions, Laine maintains her stand on her record, not on
denying some foggy accusations. Allen gives her role the dignity that befits the
honest senator. You know she knows that she has what it takes to do the job, she
just has to get past the sordid side of politics to get that job. Allen is
forceful and dynamic in her performance as a woman who grew up in politics (her
father, played by Philip Baker Hall, is a highly respected ex-governor) and
gained her own respect in the Senate. If anyone is going to break in to the male
dominated Executive Branch, Laine Hanson is the one to do it. There aren't many
"best actress" perfs so far this year. Allen's is one of them.</P>
<P>Allen's fine performance is supplemented by some terrifically effective
supporting characters. Jeff Bridges is a wonderful enigma as the president.
Jackson Evans is in the waning years of his successful, two-term presidency and
is comfortable as can be in his position as world leader. Bridges gives a
relaxed, confident performance and comes across as very presidential, indeed.
Evans is in charge of a smooth running government machine and has the best
running it. The president can even partake in a bit of frivolity as he has a
ongoing challenge to try and stump the White House chef by asking for shark
steak sandwiches or walnut pudding with nary a moment's notice. Bridges also
gives a touch of elegance to the role, especially when decked out in his
splendid custom wardrobe, which I'll get to later.</P>
<P>Gary Oldman, whom I think is one of the great character actors alive today, is
simply superb as the outwardly slimy Sheldon Runyon. The powerful congressman
comes across as unscrupulous in his diligent attacks on Sen. Hanson. But, Oldman
gives Shelly a level of complexity that makes you understand his motivations. He
is not a bad man and his opposition of the nomination is based on firmly held
political convictions. He believes, as he puts it, "this nomination is the
cancer of affirmative action" and this is his motivation in opposing the
president's wishes. Oldman, with some really bad hair and an equally bad
wardrobe, also gives a dead-on Midwestern accent and makes you forget that
you're watching an actor.</P>
<P>Sam Elliot is executive office material as the president's chief of staff. He is
the Greek chorus in the White House and openly opposes his boss on his selection
for VP. But, he is loyal above all and, when the die is cast, he stands firmly
behind President Evans. Christian Slater has a small, pivotal role as the frosh
rep Webster. When we meet the ambitious young man, he aligns himself with
Runyon, looking only for political advancement. As the truth, and Laine's
integrity, comes to the surface, Webster changes and grows to support the
President. It's a nice touch showing a newly elected politician learning the
importance of personal honor.</P>
<P>The first rate production shows artistic imagination. Costuming by Matthew
Jacobsen provides the right tailoring for the president and gives Allen an
elegant look in business suits and evening gowns. Production designer Alexander
Hammond does a beautiful job in recreating the Oval Office and the floor of
Congress. Denis Maloney's crisp lensing adds another plus to the proceedings.</P>
<P>One problem, kind of a big one, with the script is an important development
concerning Governor Hathaway. I won't give it away, but suspension of disbelief
is required of us to accept an out-of-nowhere plot twist. It detracts from the
overall quality of the story. Nonetheless, "The Contender" is a solid political
thriller with old-fashioned concepts packaged in a slick, well-made container. I
give it a B+.</P>
