<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"The Thing" was long suspected of being directed by Howard Hawks--much
later on this  was confirmed by the actors. Christian Nyby was Hawks's
longtime editor and was looking to advance his career, but had trouble
handling the directing chores, which induced Hawks to step in and help
his friend out.</P>
<P>This is one of the better science-fiction cheapie films, one that became
a cult classic. It is a wonderfully banal film about a flying saucer
landing on the North Pole and a superior alien, who looks like
Frankenstein, being thawed out. The alien will attack a group of
scientists and Air Force personnel in the scientists' Arctic outpost.
Hawks wastes no time with any liberal messages about why this creature
came here, instead the film has a jovial Air Force crew snappily banter
at each other, a sparring romantic relationship develop between the
womanizing captain and the scientist's independent-minded secretary cut
through the fierceness of the monster story, and for quirkiness, we see
plants as monsters crying for more blood to spawn more monsters. The
cast is perfect, their non-chalant attitude gives the film its raucous
mood and allows the warlike atmosphere between beast and man to be a
battle of both wits and brawn.</P>
<P>The film opens with General Fogarty (McMahon) at the Air Force base in
Anchorage, receiving an urgent call from Dr. Carrington (Cornthwaite) at
his scientific outpost for botanists and experimental lab scientists at
the North Pole, telling him to send a search party, that an unidentified
metallic flying object crashed near-by. Captain Hendry (Kenneth Tobey)
is dispatched there with his genial crew and with a wisecracking
journalist, Scotty (Spencer).</P>
<P>The bumbling military men detonate the found spacecraft but accidently
destroy it, but they capture the alien (James Arness) who is frozen in a
lump of ice and bring it back to their outpost to await orders from
General Fogarty. They store the monster in a freezing store room, but
accidently, while on guard duty, their electric blanket gets too close
to it and it thaws out, whereby it escapes, killing their sled dogs in
the process, but losing an arm.</P>
<P>After the brilliant but misguided Carrington experiments on the
recovered arm, he sees no blood or nervous system and boldly concludes
it is some form of a vegetable, that through evolution lives on human or
animal blood and has developed a more superior intelligence than humans.</P>
<P>A nice little confrontation takes place between the Air Force men and
the scientist over what to do with the monster. Dr. Carrington wants to
communicate with this superior being, he states, "There are no enemies
in science, only phenomena to study." But the Air Force is only
interested in the safety of everyone concerned and see no redeeming
value in communicating with the alien. Captain Hendry takes charge of
the outpost; and because of his professional duties, he curtails his
romantic advances on the pretty secretary, Nikki (Margaret Sheridan),
who is trapped in the Arctic with the brainy scientists. He says the
scientists are like kids with a new toy, making a big fuss over this
alien, and he proceeds to treat them like children who need a father to
discipline them, while he waits for further orders.</P>
<P>While Carrington retreats to the greenhouse and discovers the alien was
there, he decides
not to tell Hendry where it is and goes ahead trying to raise new
monsters by feeding them with frozen bags of blood plasma. Meanwhile,
Hendry can't kill the monster by shooting it, so he asks aloud, "How do
you kill a vegetable?" Nikki snaps back, "You boil it." When the inept
military men try to douse it with kerosene and set it on fire, they
nearly burn down their building and hardly harm the creature in the
process, though they do incur its wrath.</P>
<P>The monster comes back to the greenhouse and kills the two scientist
doing guard duty. Then, as an ironic twist, the monster cuts off the
heat in the building. Hendry now follows the advice of a scientist, who
suggests they electrocute it with the power from their generator. But
Carrington has gone crazy, clammoring "I want to understand it," and has
shut off the generator. The monster rewards him by swatting him away, as
if he were a fly, but in its pursuit of blood, it steps on the electric
trap and sizzles to death.</P>
<P>The film closes with the excited Scottie breaking the story to the
world, screaming into the microphone: " I bring a warning--to every one
of you listening to the sound of my voice. Tell the world, tell this to
everyone wherever they are: watch the skies, watch everywhere, keep
looking--watch the skies! "</P>
<P>This is a fast-paced and enjoyable B-film, giving us a feel for the cold
war paranoia taking hold of the country at the time. It is about how
anyone different is viewed as an enemy, and how there is a sense of
isolation for intellectuals in the country. It also shows how rational
people when just trying to do their professional jobs, still act
irrationally. This is evidenced by the conflict between the scientists
versus the military, with this reactionary film clearly looking at the
common man types who are in the military as a better alternative than
the arrogant intellectual-minded scientists, who are skeptically viewed
as being so different from the man in the street that they are not to be
trusted.</P>
