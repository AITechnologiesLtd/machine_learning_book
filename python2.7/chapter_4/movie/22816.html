<PRE>                             ISN'T SHE GREAT
                    A film review by Christopher Null
                      Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>     I'll start by saying up front that I really don't admire Bette
Midler.  I find her loud, hammy, a bit trashy, and generally obnoxious
in every way.  Oddly, this instantly qualifies her to play novelist
Jacqueline Susann, who was loud, hammy, a bit trashy, and generally
obnoxious in every way.</P>
<P>     If the name Susann doesn't ring a bell, it's because you're too
young.  "Jackie" was a washed-up actress and radio star when she penned
her first novel, The Valley of the Dolls, which went on to become, at
its time, the biggest selling novel ever.  Why?  In the late 60's the
tale of drugs and lurid sex against the backdrop of Hollywood was
shocking.  Now, it's quite tepid, and so is this film, exploring
Susann's rise to fame.</P>
<P>     And fame is what our Jackie was after.  She was what you might even
call a fame whore.  She prays to a tree for fame.  After getting cancer,
she bargains with God for ten more years of life so she can have more
fame.  Kids, this is not a role model.</P>
<P>     With the movie's tagline "Talent isn't everything," our heroes hope
to inspire the wretches of the earth to greatness, by showing that even
a loud, hammy, trashy, and generally obnoxious in every way person can
become a star with a little luck and grunt work.  But Susann/Midler is
so gratingly awful, not only when it comes to talent, but also as a
person, it's impossible to relate to the character.</P>
<P>     Oh, and this is a comedy.  You might think a comedy would really
blow if the lead is dying of cancer.  Oh, and how it blows.  I smiled
maybe once during this film, and what with jokes like "Table for three:
two adults and one Gentile," how can you blame me?  Everything from the
opening credits to Burt Bacharach's tinny score is just plain bad.  That
said, I was stunned to hear the laughter of our baby boomer-heavy
audience throughout this film.</P>
<P>     Maybe it worked for them, but boy did it fail for me.  Frankly I
would have preferred to go BEYOND The Valley of the Dolls.</P>
