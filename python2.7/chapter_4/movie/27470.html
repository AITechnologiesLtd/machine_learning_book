<PRE>PLACE VENDOME</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by Nicole Garcia</P>

<P>     There are great pleasures to this silkily adult thriller set in the 
murky world of precious stones, and none is greater, silkier, or more 
adult that the presence of the great Catherine Deneuve.  As beautiful in 
her late fifties as she was in her early twenties, Ms. Deneuve has long 
since justified the Best Actress awards she won as a newcomer in The 
Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964).</P>
<P>     She's never been better than she is here as Marianne Malivert, the 
dipsomaniac wife (and before too long, widow) of the head of one of the 
great jewelry firms of Paris's famed Place Vendome.  When we first meet 
her, she's virtually a full-time resident of a private alcohol clinic.  
But the sudden death of her husband (Bernard Fresson) shakes her out of 
it, and re-armed with her former expertise as a diamond specialist and 
in possession of a cache of stolen gems he showed her before he drove 
his car into a truck, she penetrates the dark and dangerous shadows of 
the diamond trade, from De Beers in London to the burrows of Antwerp in 
an effort to secure her future.</P>
<P>     Actress-turned-writer/director Nicole Garcia keeps the mind 
churning by gradually revealing knots and tangles as she spools out her 
story.  There are multiple links between many of the characters, of both 
a professional and a romantic character, but we only discover them bit 
by bit.  There is a determined rejection of consistency, that hobgoblin 
of little minds; instead Garcia challenges us with shifting attitudes 
and character traits.  Marianne is a drunk; when she sobers up, she can 
still slip without falling apart.  Her feelings toward the beautiful 
Nathalie (Emmanuelle Seignier) range unapologetically from hostility to 
empathy.  Strong performances from Jacques Dutronc and Jean-Pierre Bacri 
as a couple of the men in her life draw the twisted skein of this story 
tighter.  "Love means getting lied to and betrayed," Marianne muses, and 
mendacity and betrayal in love and business are at the heart of this 
often difficult but always rewarding film noir.</P>
