<PRE>          Review by Thor Thomas</PRE>
<P>          The movie _Starship Troopers_ is full of sound and fury and
     blood and testosterone.  A tongue-in-cheek deconstruction of
     Robert A. Heinlein's novel and war movies as fascist propaganda.
          So, what's in it?  Macho women with guns!  Macho men with
     guns!  Phallic spaceships! Guns that shoot 23-skidillion bullets
     before reloading!  Nuclear grenades!  Decapitations! 
     Mutilations!  Defenestrations!  Whipping!  And bugs!  Bugs!! 
     Bugs!!!
          It's been a while since I have read the book, but as I
     recall, it was not much more than a series of battle vignettes
     framed by flashbacks to the main character's high-school civics
     class.  Inspired in part by Heinlein's experiences during WWII,
     it is a platform for Heinlein to preach and philosophize about
     how the military is necessary for the survival of civilians,
     though as it is an allegory, it does perhaps get taken a bit far.
     The military rules society, and anyone who is not a member does
     not have citizen's rights.  True, we have to be "not as nice"
     during war, we had to become a more militaristic society in order
     to beat the Nazis (check out posters of that era), and that was
     one of the points of the novel.  The Bugs are an enemy with whom
     we cannot have peace (because we have nothing in common but a
     need for the same planets), only victory or defeat.  Hence, a war
     that goes on pretty much forever as the two sides are fairly
     evenly matched.  In this sort of scenario, the society Heinlein
     presents is perhaps justified, but it is a nasty world I could
     not like very much while reading the book, and the filmmakers
     evidently had similar feelings.  Personally, I never felt the
     book was one of Heinlein's stronger works; for a better coming-
     of-age story in a military setting, I would recommend his _Space
     Cadets_ much more highly.
          In the book version of _Starship Troopers_, the Mobile
     Infantry does its fighting in power battlesuits that inspired the
     whole "Japanime" mech genre.  One of the cooler parts of the
     book, and you might think something they would like to do
     onscreen, now that they have the computer graphics technology to
     do it; but no, these are just soldiers lugging around big guns
     and nuke-launchers.  Perhaps someone figured they wouldn't need
     actors anymore if they did the CGI powersuits.
          The crypto-fascist society of Starship Troopers takes a back
     seat to the action, but between acts we do get treated to spoofs
     of interactive government propaganda.  In the book, the Bug War
     had been going on for some time, which explained the militaristic
     society, but in the movie the war starts during the story, and
     the junta is already well-established, which is slightly more
     disturbing.  Many of the uniforms and insignia have a definite
     "Nazi" look about them.  I'm not sure Heinlein would have
     approved of the interpretation,  but it's definitely an element
     of his story, whether he meant it precisely that way or not. 
     Another difference: in the movie, the military is fully
     integrated, while in the book the infantry was all-male and only
     women flew the ships.
          The philosophy is still there, though in smaller proportions
     than the novel (which is a good thing, we wouldn't want to fall
     asleep in the theater, would we?), and the brutality is not as
     sugar-coated.  Director Paul Verhoeven seems to be exposing some
     of the Heinlein's nastier subtext.
          Verhoeven is also a director who loves to depict death and
     blood, and this is not a movie for the squeamish.  Nothing
     perhaps as blatant and gratuitous as the transit-station shoot-
     out in his movie _Total Recall_, but in addition to battlefield
     casualties shown in full view, we also have violence off the
     battlefield, including a broken arm, a knife through a hand,
     someone cut in half by a pressure door, and a death during a
     training exercise.  Ironically, the only violence censored is one
     scene of a cow being slaughtered and one of cruelty to an alien.
          Despite the satiric element, the movie comes across as
     fairly mindless once all is said and done, mainly due to the
     testosterone-poisoned cornball plot and stock characters lifted
     from old WWII movies.  But it is fun in the mode of _Independence
     Day_ - cheer the humans squashing those nasty alien bugs.  And
     such pretty bugs, too: the computer graphics really turned out
     well!  See it for the special effects and the bugs, or for the
     part of the novel that is still there, rather than the
     intellectual content or a retelling of the book, and be warned of
     the gore.
          DISCLAIMER:  It has been a while since I read _Starship
     Troopers_ (I considered re-reading it before seeing the movie,
     but decided not to), so any misrepresentations of Heinlein's text
     are my fault entirely.</P>
