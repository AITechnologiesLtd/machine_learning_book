<PRE>Bite the Bullet (1975)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 67</PRE>
<P>"Bite the Bullet" is a Western drama with a good
cast and good cinematography.  However, the
characters aren't completely credible, and the
dialogue is only perfunctory, keeping the film
from the greatness that some have assigned to it.</P>
<P>"Bite the Bullet" takes place in the west, around
the turn of the century.  A lengthy horse race,
with a prize of $2,000, attracts disparate entries.
Gene Hackman and James Coburn are the big names.
Other contestants include Candice Bergen with a
bad husband, Jan-Michael Vincent with a bad attitude,
Mario Arteaga with a bad toothache, Ben Johnson
with a bad heart, and Ian Bannen who is merely
present.</P>
<P>The story should provide suspense, since the
audience doesn't know who will win the race.
But the suspense never happens.  All the contestants
except Vincent are bland and likeable, and one
has a strong suspicion that first-billed Hackman,
whose character is essentially perfect, is going
to cross the finish line first.</P>
<P>The competitors bring new meaning to the word
"sportsmanship", helping each other as if they were
on the same team.  The friendliness leads to a
pleasant but passionless film, with only Vincent
to throw in bad vibes.  Even Vincent's character,
however, suddenly becomes a nice guy after he
meets his comeuppance.</P>
<P>Bergen's designer jeans fit well, but don't fit
in with the late Victorian era of the film.</P>
<P>Richard Brooks was both Producer and Director,
and wrote the screenplay as well.</P>
