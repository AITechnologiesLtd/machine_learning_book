<PRE>Shadow Hours
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright <A HREF="mailto:2000@filmcritic.com">2000@filmcritic.com</A></PRE>
<P>Bad movies described as "a swift descent into sinful pleasure, decay,
and debauchery" are hard to watch.  Bad 2000's movies that resemble bad
1980s films are even harder to watch.  Shadow Hours falls into the
latter category, a mish-mashed train wreck of B-movie actors (including
Michael Dorn, aka Star Trek's Worf), an uninteresting plot, vain
attempts at capitalizing on the "underground" scenes of seedy Los
Angeles, and really, really bad directing and horrendous music
video-esque ballistic editing that was taught to me in film school right
before I decided to drop out.</P>
<P>The film revolves around the life of Michael Holloway (Balthazar Getty)
who is trying to restart his life with his one-dimensional wife Chloe
(Rebecca Gayheart) after a nasty bout of drug and alcohol addictions. 
Michael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas
station and is bombarded by the ugliness and weirdness of the nightlife
of L.A.  One night, he meets a strange gent named Stuart (Mr. Buckaroo
Banzai, Peter Weller). He drives a Porsche, smokes French cigarettes,
and drones on about life, eventually coaxing Mike into exploring the
"underbelly" of L.A. together, a tour of punk bars, S&M clubs, and
bare-knuckle fights.</P>
<P>The film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played Peter Greene,
acting like he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in The
Mask 2. The film then simply dissolves into a cheap rip-off of Dante's
Inferno mixed with an old Stephen J. Cannell television pilot.</P>
<P>The pace of the film is jarring and utterly without focus.  Other
horrors include the endless montages of people pumping gas and the
Charlie Sheen, Johnny Depp, Richard Grieco-esque acting of Balthazar
Getty.  Peter Weller clearly knows his career is completely gone and
doesn't give two shits about it.  And after the cheap exploitation of
bondage clubs, dance clubs, and brothels - damn, isn't anyone safe any
more from the ugly eye of Hollywood!?</P>
<P>Way back in 1984, a great but crazy director named Abel Ferrara made his
worse film and called it Fear City.  Shadow Hours reminds me of an
almost perfect sequel.</P>
