<P>   A recent issue of the New Yorker magazine has a cartoon
in which the man, reading the newspaper, says to his wife,
"Now that everyone's in NATO, we don't have to take crap
from Mars any more."  Maybe not.  But worldwide
membership in that powerful security force is no match for
humankind's most potent enemy: Nature.  Recent disaster
movies have had us poor beings inundated by twisters,
floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, fire, and animals. 
We've been able to prevail, though not without great losses. 
Now comes yet another natural disaster, a comet which is
speeding toward the planet on an treacherous trajectory which
allows astronomers to predict the exact moment it will make a
deep impact but leaves them almost powerful to prevent a
tragedy.  Almost, but not entirely.  There is one hope, and is
for a group of astronauts to travel to the speeding meteor and
plant a nuclear device into it, throwing the entire inanimate
godzilla into a tizzy as if to say, "Get off my planet!"</P>
<P>   The younger set, expecting to see a dazzling show courtesy
of Industrial Light & Magic for at least half the time, will be
disappointed.  The picture, directed by Mimi Leder ("The
Peacemaker"), undergoes a woman's touch in focusing on
sentiment and office politics.  Whether this is to the good
depends on your tolerance for the saccharine and your
predilection for violence.  If you weep the like of "Love Story"
you'll go for the tearful partings of families and reconciliation
of father and daughter.  If you like sci-fi but with a deliberate
pace of Robert Zemeckis's "Contact" or Andrew Niccol's
"Gattaca," you will be sufficiently involved.  If you've had
enough of formulaic family feeling, you'll have reservations. 
"Deep Impact," then, is a cautiously paced tale of woe which
will have you guessing: will the comet hit the earth or not? 
While it may be unconscionable to give away the answer in a
review, here's a hint: the comet divides into two parts, a
devastating, humongous rock and a relatively small hunk of
astral projection.</P>
<P>   "Deep Impact" begins as does many a thriller, with a scene
designed to thrill audience adolescents.  Leo Biederman
(Elijah Wood), a bright-eyed high-school kid who calls
teachers and parents "sir," is on an outing with his astronomy
teacher, when he peers through the telescope and discovers
an unknown body adjacent to two well-known stars.  When a
specialist in his lab (Charles Martin Smith) examines the
body's orbit in his computer, he is so shocked at its trajectory
that he drops his slice of pizza, jumps into his jeep with the
evidence, and meets with catastrophe.  As director Mimi
Leder cuts to Hillary Clinton lookalike Jenny Lerner (Tea
Leoni), a career-driven TV news reporter, we find her
investigating the resignation of the Secretary of the Treasury,
whose departure she believes is not occasioned by his wish
to spend more time with his sick wife.  Believing that an
expose of the affair he is allegedly having with someone
named Ellie will spur her into the anchor's seat, she instead
falls upon information about E.L.E., which means Extinction
Level Event.  A mean meteor is determined to wipe out all life
on earth.</P>
<P>   As astronaut Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall), nicknamed
"Fish" because his name sounds like one, joins a mission to
duel the big rock, tearful events occur back on earth among
folks who believe that the mission will fail.  Most important,
newscaster Jenny Lerner decides to hate her dad (Maximilian
Schell), who has recently divorced his wife (Vanessa
Redgrave) to marry a bimbo two years old than Jenny.  Much
of the film treats the family split and ultimate reconciliation--as
Jenny recalls the wonderful times she enjoyed at the age of
five with the aging Jason.  The other tear-evoking tale centers
on young Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood), who has decided
quickly to marry his sweetheart in order to make her eligible
along with him for a safety program and she must choose
whether to stay back home with her parents and die or to join
her new, shotgun partner.</P>
<P>   Morgan Freeman does a dignified job as the president of
the United States, offering both hope and realism to the
people of his country, as he prepares to transport one million
designated by computer to be conveyed to a safe place in
Missouri where they along with one pair of each animal
species (sound familiar?) will survive and procreate.  </P>
<P>   The film has a few brief humorous moments, as when 17-
year-old Biederman becomes famous for discovering the
comet, and a classmate says in front of the other students in
a school assembly program, "You're gonna have more sex
starting now. Famous people always get more sex."  Similarly,
when the astronauts cynically ponder their fate in the
rocketship "Messiah," one says, "Look at the bright side...we'll
all get high schools named for us."</P>
<P>   "Deep Impact" is a by-the-numbers disaster movie with just
enough special effects to please the calamity-starved in the
audience and, like other formulaic films, one in which various
individuals are assigned problems they must either reconcile
themselves to or gain reconciliation from.  Despite its
familiarity, it's a sincere work and, it should be added, one
that's not so far off course.  Just as some people hold that the
earth was attacked by runaway comets several millenia ago
and gained rebirth, others believe that such a calamity could
happen again, at any time.  After all, nature is neutral: it is not
pro-U.S. or pro-Iran or even pro-earth and there's a lot of stuff
up there.  Rated PG-13.  Running time: 115 minutes.  (C)
