<P>Starring Robin Williams, Embeth Davidtz, Sam Neill. Directed by Chris
Columbus. Rated PG.</P>
<P>Chris Columbus is master of melodrama, sire of schmaltz and czar of
cheapness. His films are notorious sentimental hanky-fests. Stepmom, in
particular, comes to mind, but each of his films, from Mrs. Doubtfire
to Home Alone have those infamous moments of ultra-sentimental emotion.
Many have labeled Columbus's movies as cheap and false, and they may be
right, but his new one, Bicentennial Man is different. Somehow, the
emotion in this one is genuine and the movie works: as a tearjerker, as
family entertainment and as a comedy.</P>
<P>Robin Williams, who hasn't done an all-out comedy since the abominable
Flubber and hasn't made a good one since Columbus's Nine Months, stars
here as Andrew, a domestic robot owned by a kindly 2005 family. The
head of the family (Sam Neill), known only as "Sir" since that's what
Andrew calls him, begins to notice something unique about his household
appliance. He takes Andrew to his parent company which wants
to "correct the defect." They go away and Sir takes on Andrew's
education himself, feeling the responsibility to help the robot grow to
bigger and better things.</P>
<P>Andrew himself has grown fond of Sir's youngest daughter, "Little
Miss," who befriends him. Their relationship develops for fifteen years
until Andrew, now officially an enlightened robot (as well as an expert
clock-maker), asks for his freedom. Sir gets PO-ed at Andrew's alleged
ungratefulness and, in essense, kicks him out, with a self-
righteous "You now have your freedom." So Andrew goes off and builds a
house of his own on the oceanside, where Little Miss can come to visit
him as often as she likes.</P>
<P>After Sir's death, Andrew feels something missing from his "life," so
he goes on a twenty year journey to seek out other robots like him.
What he finds is a robot scientist (the dependable Oliver Platt) who
helps him take on human form. But can he actually become a human and
obtain all the privileges that go with it, like the ability to marry a
human?</P>
<P>Bicentennial Man was based on a pair of short stories by renowned sci-
fi writer Isaac Asimov but it was, of course, altered to be more crowd-
pleasing and mainstream. The result is hardly ground-breaking cinema,
but it's watchable, touching, profound and sometimes downright
allegorical. Granted, it occasionally has over-sentimental and cloying
moments Chris Columbus-style, but they feel marginally genuine: things
real people might say or do. I'm still not sold on Columbus's often
condescending style of filmmaking, but at least he's heading in the
right direction.</P>
<P>I liked Robin Williams here too; his purpose, for once, isn't sucking
up to the audience. His performance is quirky, funny and sincere; not
his best, but a lot of fun to watch. I also enjoyed Oliver Platt, whose
hilarious deadpan delivery is impossible to get tired of. This isn't an
actors' movie: the performances are often overshadowed by the flashy,
though not spectacular special effects. The animatronics and CGI used
to create the robot are just as smooth and aesthetically flawless as
the performances. This is, after all, a 100 million dollar movie: the A-
List stars are here, but they are not alone.</P>
<P>There is, of course, a final "inspirational" speech and it's in a
courtroom, of sorts. I dread that family movie staple. But in
Bicentennial Man it is kept concise and to the point -- definitely a
plus. Most importantly, though, the speech doesn't make you cringe. It
actually means something. It's well-written and well-delivered. It
doesn't always follow the formula.</P>
<P>As some critics have pointed out, this plot has been done before, and
sometimes better, on the tv series Star Trek: The Next Generation,
where "Data," an android, was on a constant quest to become as human as
possible. True, there are similarities -- ah hell, it's exactly the
same thing -- but it's unfair to penalize Bicentennial Man for it.
There was more than enough room for two falling meteor flicks (Deep
Impact and Armageddon) as well as two computer-animated movies about
ants (Antz and A Bug's Life) all in the same year, so why cripe about
something that's not nearly as conspicuous?</P>
<P>A couple of final quibbles: I'm now offering a substantial reward for
James Horner's severed head on a stick. The whole movie, I was wishing
he would shut up. The Oscar-winning composer's music here is god-awful,
with "tender" violin compositions playing ceaselessly in the
background, telling us exactly how to feel about the events on screen.
Also, at 2 hours 11 minutes, Bicentennial Man is a little on the long
side, but then again with the streak of 3-hour-plus Oscar contenders
being released in these next few months, I guess I shouldn't complain.</P>
<P>Bicentennial Man is well-worth a look this holiday season, especially
if your other choice is something like Anna and the King which, I hope,
leaves theaters in a hurry. This isn't a perfect movie, but it
entertains and touches the heart, and it's certainly a big step up from
Patch Adams.</P>
