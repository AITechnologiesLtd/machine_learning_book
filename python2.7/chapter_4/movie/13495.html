<P>   Once again, Steven Spielberg proves that as a constructer
of movie images, he's unbeatable.  Critic Matt Zoller Seitz
reports in the July 8 issue of New York Press that "Spielberg
is the most consistently inventive, passionate and precise
director in American cinema....It's a rare shot in a Spielberg
film that isn't beautiful."  While we'd have a tough time
describing scenes of total warfare as beautiful, we would have
to admit that as a forger of indelible images, Spielberg has
accomplished his principal goal in the making of "Saving
Private Ryan."  He has demonstrated the sheer reality of war
as no other filmmaker before him has done.  His latest film
does not move us as did Lewis Milestone's 1930 film "All
Quiet on the Western Front."  Milestone's 68-year-old work is
cloaked with a powerful antiwar message based on Erich
Maria Remarque's pacifist novel about German boy's
experiences as soldier's during World War I. "All Quiet" hones
in more effectively on the war's meaning to a single
individual.  "Ryan" is more of a piece with Ken Annakin's 1962
epic, "The Longest Day," featuring an all-star cast in a
retelling of the Allied invasion of Normandy--a re-creation of
historical events emphasizing the actuality of battle more than
an exploration of the lives of its combatants.  "Ryan" is no
"Schindler's List," still Spielberg's greatest accomplishment,
because its characters do not undergo radical changes of
behavior. As portrayed by Spielberg, Schindler was a
man of particular interest because he was such a flawed
character; a businessman whose principal goal at first was to
become a millionaire using cheap Jewish labor, who proudly
wore a Nazi insignia in his jacket and loved his brandy, night
clubs and finely-tailored suits.  "The Saving of Private Ryan"
includes no such complex personality.  We know little of its
hero, subtly played by Tom Hanks, save that he was an
English teacher in a small town high school and who, despite
a pronounced tremor in his right hand has no distinct
imperfections.  Characterization is what made "Schindler's
List" mong the most moving films of all time.  Imagery, on the
other hand, makes "The Saving of Private Ryan" remarkable.</P>
<P>   You need not wait long to perceive this.  While the story is
framed by a contemporary scene in much the way that
Spielberg concluded "Schindler's List," the attention of Janusz
Kaminski's frequently hand-held camera shifts to the landing
of troops on Omaha Beach, situated in a northwest corner of
France just east of Cherbourg.  It is D-Day, June 6, 1944, the
opening day of the Allied invasion of Europe and the men
who are about to hit the sands are not a platoon of gung-ho
Zorros preparing to battle evil.  Some are throwing up, others
pray in a variety of tongues; orders are barked as though the
men were hearing the proposed strategy of the campaign,
which was effectively kept a secret from Nazi intelligence. 
The Omaha campaign, a pyrrhic victory for the Allies, was
bungled from the start.  The Americans appear to lose ten
men for every German killed, hitting the beach amid a flurry of
bullets from the enemy who are situated high above them as
though lobbing kettles of hot oil from the tower
of a medieval castle.  In the confusion of the adrenalin-
pumping scene, the American forces cannot be blamed for
some acts of stupidity and self-destruction, foremost of which
is that of one G.I. whose life is saved when a bullet richochets
from his helmet.  He removes the helmet in surprise, stares at
it in wonderment, and promptly receives a fatal bullet in the
head.  Spielberg is a master at representing carnage in a
believable, indelible fashion, spinning his camera to the sea
which has become incarnadine with the blood of American
victims.  The stereophonic sound sound of the theater
envelopes up in the endless rat-tat-tat of machine guns
accompanied subtly and only intermittently by John Williams's
score.  Little music is needed to manipulate our emotions.</P>
<P>   While "Saving Private Ryan" succeeds each time it portrays
combat, it is less successful in developing its characters, and
particularly uninventive and superficial in verbalizing ethical
questions.  The storyline hinges on an order received from
the very top brass, Chief of Staff George C. Marshall, to
search out and bring home one James Francis Ryan, the sole
surviving member of a family of five.  On a single day Ryan's
mother receives news from the war office that three of her
sons were killed in action.  To save Mrs. Ryan the tragedy of
losing her last surviving boy, the general has ordered a
dangerous mission: a team will comb the area of France to
which Private Ryan (Matt Damon) has parachuted, find the
soldier, and escort him home.  Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) is
chosen to lead the search party, made up of his right-hand
man, Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore); an intellectual pulled
from his desk job as a language interpreter, Corporal Upham
(Jeremy Davies); a Jewish soldier from Brooklyn, Private
Mellish (Adam Golberg); and a medic, Wade (Giovanni Ribisi),
who must try without sterile equipment or even gloves to save
the lives of men who receive bullet wounds in the field. 
Ethical issues are raised in short order, as the small legion
question the appropriateness of risking the lives of eight
people in order to remove a single soldier from his company. 
Further debate focuses on whether James Ryan should be
singled out for release from combat since "we all have
mothers," from which two additional issues emerge. 
What if removing Ryan from the battlefield will cause a
hardship in his own unit, which needs him badly to fulfill a
bridge-blowing mission, and what if Ryan himself does not
want to desert "the only brothers I know," the men in his unit
he has grown to love?</P>
<P>   Though the story is driven by the search for one man, the
glory of the movie is in portraying a succession of combat
scenes which materialize almost without letup, without giving
the audience much time to breathe.  The rapid-fire sequence
of bloody encounters maintains the tension throughout the
170-minute film but do not allow for much insight into the lives
of the individuals in the unit.  Aside from the initial portrayal of
the Gallipoli-like bloodshed at Omaha Beach, Spielberg
extracts the horrors of war from some noteworthy panoramas. 
In one instance involving hand-to-hand combat between a
large, powerful German and a hapless member of the search
party, the German gains a dominant position over Private
Mellish, his knife slowly descending toward Mellish's heart as
the American impotently calls out "stop!"  In another, a
German unit is successfully ambushed by the Americans and
wiped out save for one German, who is ordered to dig a
grave for his dead buddies.  The Nazi soldier, desperately
trying to save his hide, insists "I love America," tries
pathetically to sing the Star Spangled Banner, curses Hitler,
and forces Captain Miller to make a decision amid appeals
from the scholarly Upham that killing him "is not right."</P>
<P>   Tom Hanks's performance is visceral. You can imagine him
as the beloved, small-town English teacher who takes up
arms when duty calls.  You see Matt Damon as the all-
American farm boy whose loyalty to his troop is more exalted
than his fondness for hom.  You empathize with Edward
Burns who as Private Reiben is so enraged by the seeming
absurdity of the mission that he is prepared to desert.  And
you can understand the screwups of Jeremy Davies who, as
a language interpreter with only the barest of arms training,
rains havoc on his own men until he gains the courage of the
battlefield.</P>
<P>   The immediacy of the drama is furthered by the use of
a hand-held camera, stripped of protective lens coatings to
give the film the look of a 1940s war picture. The unit's
success in impressing us with the horrors of war is due
largely to the use of Stephen E. Ambrose, author of
"D-Day: June 6, 1994," as historical consultant.  Credibility is
not hurt by the training which a company called Warriors
Inc. gave the actors; a boot camp involving ten days of
rigorous weapons drills, close combat, individual manuevers,
and World War 2 lingo and hand signals.  Spielberg insists
that everything, down to the actual language the men used in
the field, is the 1940s McCoy, and though you can count on
your fingers the number of curse words the men utter, you
can have faith in the great director's word.  After all Spielberg
has made the world believe in the authenticity of a rich array
of films in all genres--the mystical experience of "Close
Encounters," the feverishness of "Sugarland Express," the
wildly imaginative "Indiana Jones" series among others--that if
you've been lucky enough to avoid front-line service, you can
with absolutely safety be right up there with Captain Miller's
daredevil unit.</P>
