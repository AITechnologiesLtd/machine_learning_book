<PRE>Local Hero
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**** (out of 4) LOCAL HERO is one of my all-time favorite movies. I can
watch it again and again, year after year. Each time I see something
new, and each time I see something familiar. It is my yearly pilgrimage
to Scotland to visit old friends and homey places. </P>
<P>The setting is a charming small town called Ferness. The town is
geographically and economically isolated. It conists of a small row of
houses, pressed between a cliff and the sea. There is a pub, a tiny
hotel, a church, and one red phone box. </P>
<P>The inhabitants of Ferness are good, kind, small-town folk. Fishermen
pull a living from the sea and everyone else makes a living however they
can, doubling up on jobs when necessary. They may appear quirky at
first, but once you get to know them, they are no more unusual than your
own friends and family. </P>
<P>Ferness sounds like an idyllic town, ripe for a fairy tale. The film
does indeed start out that way. There is an uncaring villain who works
for corporate developers. There is a town full of peasants in danger of
losing their charming homes, their rustic land, their simple livelihood
to make way for big business. There is even a mermaid. </P>
<P>What ACTUALLY happens is less a fairy tale and more human nature. </P>
<P>A big oil company sets out to buy the scenic little town on a bay in
north Scotland. It plans to replace the town with an oil refinery.</P>
<P>The oil company sends "Mac" MacIntyre (Peter Riegert) from acquisitions
to buy the land. (He's actually Polish, but he's got the right name for
the job.) He'd rather deal over the phone, but the company insists he be
on-site. He arrives and meets Danny (Peter Capaldi), his assistant while
in Scotland, and Marina (Jenny Seagrove), a marine biologist working for
the Aberdeen branch of Knox Oil, who wants to turn the bay into a marine
sanctuary. (She knows nothing of the company's plans, and wouldn't
believe them even if she knew.)</P>
<P>Mac and Danny head up to Ferness where they meet Gordon Urquhart (Denis
Lawson), hotel proprietor, accountant, and barkeep. Mac confirms to
Gordon the rumor that the the oil company wants to buy all of Ferness.
He entrusts Gordon, as the local accountant, to meet with the populace
and work out some numbers for the purchase of the town. In the meantime,
Gordon suggests that Mac take a look around; get to know the place.</P>
<P>Mac spends the day settling in and walking around the beach in his suit
and tie with Danny trailing behind. They spot an old man in the
distance, doing the same. </P>
<P>The townspeople of this paradise are thrilled at the chance to sell
their land and become instant millionaires. That night, when Mac has to
call home, he learns his name and reputation have preceeded him. He has
become a local hero to these people he'll make rich, and they instantly
take a liking to him. </P>
<P>The next day Mac has lightened up a bit. He still has his suit on, but
he fits in better. The locals are starting to accept him as part of the
population, and he's even learned a name or two. Eventually Mac slips
farther and farther into the local life. Each scene shows Mac in less
and less formal clothes as he grows more and more fond of Ferness.
Meanwhile, Gordon carries on the business of arranging for the sale of
the land. </P>
<P>As the deal draws near, the locals call a ceilidh (pronounced "Kay-Lee",
it means town meeting) to socialize and talk about the deal. Everyone
gets drunk and talks about how they will spend their millions. Grizzled
fishermen argue over the relative merits of Mazzeratis and Ferraris. </P>
<P>Everyone has a great time with the POSSIBLE exception of Mac. Mac has
grown to love this town and its people. The ceilidh only cements the
sense of community that Mac wants in his life, that only the undeveloped
village could provide. Ironically, he will be the destroyer of the
village, and even more ironically, he will be the only one who feels its
loss.  </P>
<P>At the emotional apex of the story, Mac, uninhibited with drink, asks
Gordon to trade with him. Everything. The car, the house, the job. Mac
wants to trade his Porsche, his six-figure salary, and his stock
options, for Gordon's life in Ferness, doing odd jobs, running the
hotel, being the local bartender, and living a simple life. Nothing
comes of the proposition, but it is the point when Mac sheds his shell
and bares his soul. </P>
<P>The deal is nearly sealed when, the next day, Mac and Gordon get a
shock. Ben (Fulton Mackay), the old man who walks the beach, actually
OWNS the beach, and he won't sell. Mac's boss, Mr. Happer (Burt
Lancaster) flies to Ferness to close the deal himself. </P>
<P>Happer and Ben, who share an interest in astronomy, become fast friends
and somehow, Old Ben manages to change Happer's mind, at least about the
refinery. Happer still wants to acquire the site, but not to destroy it.
He wants to build an observatory, an institute for scientific research.
Marina was right all along. </P>
<P>Nearly everyone is happy with Happer's new arrangement. The townspeople
will still get to sell their property. Happer gets his bay. Ben keeps
his beach. Marina gets her laboratory, and Danny gets Marina. </P>
<P>But not everyone wins. In the most devastating moment of the film,
Happer tells Mac to pack up and head back to Houston immediately to take
care of business from that end. It becomes painfully clear how far Mac
has fallen in love with Ferness-when he gets the order to return, he is
in a sweater, he has five o'clock shadow, and he's eating an orange that
Ben found on the beach. When the film cuts to him in his creaseless suit
and crisp tie, we understand what a transformation he had undergone
while in town.</P>
<P>Mac obeys his boss, but before he leaves he puts his outer shell back
on. He insists on paying for his stay at the hotel, he shaves, he
dresses properly, and his businesslike manner almost conceals the
disappointment in his face. </P>
<P>He walks into his cold, cramped, fluorescent apartment, smells the sea
shells he brought back, and hangs up the snapshots he took of Ferness. </P>
<P>He steps out on the balcony and looks out at the bleak neon skyline of
Houston, with its traffic and sirens, longing for the friendly open
streets of Ferness. </P>
<P>Mac can't return and see Ferness. Work will presumably keep him in
Houston, and development will soon forever change the place.</P>
<P>But I can go back, year after year, and I do. With each viewing, the
simple joy of life at Ferness, and the transitory pricelessness of that
particular time and place becomes more and more dear. </P>
