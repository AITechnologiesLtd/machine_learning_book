<P>Remember back in my ROMEO MUST DIE review where I said that Jet Li 
displayed "the charm and humor of Jackie Chan"?  Well, strap me down and 
slap me silly--because I was just plain wrong.  I like Jet Li, but he's 
no Jackie Chan.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Set in the late 1800s, SHANGHAI NOON is a fun mix of humor, martial 
arts, riffs on and homages to Western flicks ranging from HIGH NOON to 
BLAZING SADDLES to BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, with a few 
Eastern movie standards ("You killed my uncle!") thrown in for good 
measure.</P>
<P>After Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is kidnapped away from Forbidden City, 
China and taken to America's western frontier of Carson City, Nevada, 
Imperial Guard Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) is reluctantly allowed to go to 
America along with three other guardsmen, to rescue her.  Fate meets him 
on a train, when Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), a flirtatious train robber 
with a heart o' gold (and a nose for finding gold), crosses paths with 
Chon and eventually teams up with him to help Chon find the princess.  
Standing in their way is the traitorous ex-guardsman Lo Fong (Roger 
Yuan) who is behind Pei Pei's kidnapping, Marshall Nathan VanCleef 
(Xander Berkeley), out to arrest Roy and Chon, and Wallace (Walt 
Goggins), one of Roy's trigger-happy newbie bandits.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
The word best used to describe SHANGHAI NOON is, "fun".  Not just fun-ny 
- though, it was definitely that - "Shanghai" worked well because it 
never took itself too seriously (ya gotta love a Cowboy movie where the 
Indians aren't treated like Noble Savages, and they poke fun at 
themselves), and neither did its two lead actors/characters.  And 
because of its lighthearted approach, I was easily able to ignore plot 
slippages that might otherwise have bugged the daylights out of me had 
"Shanghai" been a more straight-ahead action flick.</P>
<P>The trademark of any Jackie Chan movie comes in his high-energy martial 
arts acrobatics, combined with his usual humorous flair.  And as usual, 
Chan did not disappoint on either end.  Chan is the Dick Clark of 
martial arts movies; the man must be 105 years old by now (I remember 
watching him in CANNONBALL RUN when I was a wee pup myself--and he 
looked about the same age even then), but watching him fly around 
on-screen, doing all his own fighting and stunts, you'd swear that he 
was still a young thing.  It is nothing less than amazing to me, and I 
could watch his movies without the sound on as long as he could keep his 
tremendous kicks (puts Chuck Norris to shame, I tell ya) and punches 
going.  And I defy you to find anything cuter than Jackie Chan getting 
silly after puffing on a peace pipe ("Could be worse; at least he's not 
White"...man, they kept me rollin').</P>
<P>Equally enjoyable, in a different way, was Owen Wilson as Roy O'Bannon.  
I couldn't help but to see shades of a young Robert Redford in Wilson, 
though unlike Redford's Butch Cassidy, Roy was a lot more personable and 
a lot less misogynic.  "Sincere and charming" describes his character 
best; never sarcastic or winking at the audience, you'd be hard-pressed 
to see Roy as a true bad guy, even when he opens mouth, inserts foot. </P>
<P>But it was the interplay between Roy and Chon (and of course, between 
Chan and Wilson), that most impressed me.  The "Chinese Drinking Game" 
they played had me in stitches, as did their early fight scene together 
(which reminds me: don't believe everything you see in the trailer for 
this flick.  You'll see what I mean). I'd dearly love to see these two 
actors expand on their great chemistry; who knows--maybe they could be 
the next Paul Newman And Robert Redford buddy team.</P>
<P>The beauty of SHANGHAI NOON, though, is that it doesn't just rely on the 
two leads to progress its story.  Lucy Liu's Princess is no shrinking 
violet; as headstrong as she is beautiful, it was quite heartening to 
see that she had some fight in her, and she didn't just sit back and let 
herself get Rescued like a damsel in distress.  And though Roger Yuan 
didn't really distinguish himself in what could've been a plum role as 
bad guy Lo Fong, the same cannot be said of Xander Berkeley; the fun he 
must've had in playing the Marshall in his dueling scenes with Roy, was 
evident during his performance.  It's just too bad that he wasn't given 
more on-screen time.</P>
<P>A couple or three bits didn't work all that well. I never did get what 
Wallace's deal was all about; he seemed to be one bad guy too many.  
Maybe I blinked and missed it--or maybe the meat of their parts were 
left on the editor's cutting floor--but where were the three Imperial 
Guards hanging out over the course of the movie?  And though the tribal 
chief's daughter was apparently a throwback to similar female characters 
in past Westerns, I rolled my eyes at how her story played out in the 
end.  Fortunately, these were minor missteps, and they had a negligible 
effect on my enjoyment of the movie.</P>
<P>Usually, thoughts of movie remakes and part-twos, give me the hives; but 
I didn't get enough of SHANGHAI NOON.  I want more.  If approached 
well--and if Jackie Chan can hold up (and he shows no signs of slowing), 
I could groove on SHANGHAI NOON II: DESTRY RIDES AGAIN.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]
I hesitated on addressing the Black Factor--or more precisely, the 
"Minority Factor"--in this review; after all, Chan & company took such a 
whimsical look at the lives of Chinese and Native Americans in the wild 
wild west of yore ("I don't know why they call me the 'Shanghai Kid'; 
I'm not from Shanghai!") that it seems almost wrong to deal with those 
issues on a more serious basis.  Still, I've not been one to back down 
from examining prejudices - Hollywood's, as well as my own.</P>
<P>The lighthearted approach used in dealing with the issues of race in 
this movie didn't mean that it was glossed-over; it was just treated 
subtlety, and in my opinion, worked all the better for that subtle 
treatment.  Only once did my BS meter go off (Blacks would be welcome in 
a saloon in the 1800s, but not Chinese?), and only once was bigotry 
specifically, directly addressed.  The treatment felt right, though 
issues of Chon's assimilation into western culture (in a "when in Rome" 
fashion) left me vaguely ill-at-ease.</P>
<P>But more disturbing to me, on a personal level, was my own prejudicial 
reaction to this movie--in a roundabout way, most of which had little to 
do with "Shanghai", and more to do with Chan's recent hit movie, RUSH 
HOUR, co-starring Chris Tucker (which I didn't watch for the longest 
time because I, frankly, didn't feel like seeing Tucker play the 
sidekick as court-jester).</P>
<P>The Diva broached this issue in her review of Held Up when she said, 
"Why is okay for me to spend my money watching a stupid Adam Sandler 
movie, but not okay for me to watch 'Booty Call'?"; and it made me stop 
and wonder the same about my own pre-judging of the role of the Black 
Sidekick--like Tucker in "Rush", vs the White Sidekick--like Wilson in 
"Shanghai".  The self-examination left me somewhat disconcerted; I had 
to ask myself if there's really a difference in how the characters are 
written and/or played by their respective actors, and more to the point, 
whether the difference is an actual, tangible thing, or merely my 
perception.</P>
<P>I haven't quite decided yet.  My heart wants to say that a Tucker, or a 
Danny Glover, or a [insert Black Actor as Sidekick name here] is written 
or directed differently than would be a Wilson, or a Gene Wilder, or a 
[insert White Actor as Sidekick name here].  But my head tells me that 
even where there is fault in the writing or direction, there is probably 
also duplicity on the actor's part.  And maybe a bit of some on mine.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
Forget MISSION: IMPLAUSIBLE TOO; spend your movie duckets next week on 
SHANGHAI NOON.  It's the funniest movie I've seen all year; Owen Wilson 
is a silly charmer, and Jackie Chan is still one baaad mofo.  And don't 
forget: as with most Jackie Chan movies, do not leave before you see the 
outtakes.</P>
<P>SHANGHAI NOON (rating: greenlight):   
GLADIATOR brought the roar into the summer movie season, but SHANGHAI 
NOON adds the fun.</P>
