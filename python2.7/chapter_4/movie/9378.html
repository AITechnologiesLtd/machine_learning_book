STRIPTEASE
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        About 14 months after its original release, I finally got 
around to seeing STRIPTEASE and, let me tell you, I could have 
waited at least another 14 months. There's good news and bad news 
about STRIPTEASE. The good news is that a lot of this movie is 
completely different from what it was marketed as -- Demi Moore Gets 
Topless. The bad news is that there is still a lot of focus on the Demi 
striptease motif which, as far as that goes, is nothing but a tease. As 
highly publicized and compensated ($12.5 million) as her nudity is, 
you get good, unadulterated glimpses of her breasts for maybe 12.5 
seconds, which adds up to a million bucks a second. Even I'd get 
naked in a movie for that kind of money.</P>
<P>        STRIPTEASE was adapted from a comic novel by Carl 
Hiaasen that made light of the skin trade and its patrons, and a lot of 
the comedy still shines through. Every character but Demi's is played 
for laughs, but it just doesn't work to have her dropped in as the one 
serious character, the one who sees her "dancing" as a form of art and 
expression, and a way to make an honest living. There's a moment 
early on where she holds up a cocktail napkin with a nude female 
silhouette and tells the owner of the club, "Get rid of these. They're 
tacky and they objectify women." Come on, Demi, those are the 
cornerstones of your career. That and a telling lack of any sense of 
humor. Think about it -- when have you ever seen Demi be anything 
but dead serious in a movie? Then why is it I keep laughing so hard at 
her whenever I watch one of her movies?</P>
<P>        If not for Demi, STRIPTEASE could have been a good, fun 
movie. If they'd cast someone who could play the character for laughs 
to fit in with the others, it might have worked. Instead, painful steps 
are taken to make Demi into the single parent martyr of the strip 
industry. Before the dust has settled on the opening credits, Demi has 
already been screwed over by the male power establishment, as a 
bastard judge awards custody of her 7-year-old daughter to her 
husband (Robert "T-1000" Patrick), a redneck scam artist who makes 
a living stealing wheelchairs.</P>
<P>        Demi has to take solace in her dancing, as we see in at least 
six stripteases, only three of which she shows brief glimpses of each 
$6.25 million breast. She dances to more Annie Lennox songs than I 
knew existed, but I do have to give her props for doing a striptease to 
Prince's "If I Was Your Girlfriend," making it an even trilogy of 
Prince-teases in 1995 and 1996, from "Erotic City" in GIRL 6 to "319" 
in SHOWGIRLS (which I never saw, by the way, Mom). Actually, we 
see more of the other dancers' skin than Demi's, especially silicone-
enhanced snake dancer Pandora Peaks.</P>
<P>        The plot is more wacky and clever than Demi deserves. 
It involves a Demi-obsessed fan (William Hill) who tries to help her 
get custody back by blackmailing perverted Congressman Burt 
Reynolds (in his lamest hairpiece yet) with pictures of him attacking 
one of the strip club customers to protect his "angel," who of course 
turns out to be Demi. After Hill turns up dead, cop Armand Assante 
shows up to ask questions and investigate. It turns into a sex farce that 
could have been a decent comeback for Reynolds had anyone gone to 
see this movie.</P>
<P>        And I must give the Person Who Almost Saved This Movie 
award to Ving Rhames, who made me laugh every single time he 
turned up in STRIPTEASE . Playing a comic version of his toughass 
Marsellus Wallace character from PULP FICTION, Ving is the strip 
club bouncer and father figure to the dancers. Pure muscle at first 
appearance, he is more clever, literate and sarcastic than everyone else 
in the movie. Where Demi is too serious and Reynolds too wacky, 
Ving invigorates the movie with the same biting wit and satire 
Hiaasen intended for all the characters. Right now, I'd kill to see him 
in a decent comedy. One word of advice to anyone planning to adapt 
and film a Carl Hiaasen novel -- lock Demi up and pay Ving the $12.5 
million.</P>
