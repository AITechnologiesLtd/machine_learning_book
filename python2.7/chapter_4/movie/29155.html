<PRE>THE VERTICAL RAY OF THE SUN
---------------------------</PRE>
<P>In present day Hanoi, three sisters reflect on their parents' relationship 
while trying to define their own in writer/director Tran Anh Hung's
("The Scent of Green Papaya") "The Vertical Ray of the Sun."</P>
<P>Youngest sister Lien (Tran Nu Yen-Khe) greets the day with Hai (Ngo Quanq 
Hai), the only brother whom she rooms and relentlessly flirts with.  Their 
morning ritual of Tai Chi and Lou Reed precedes crossing the 
street to eldest sister Suong's (Nguyen Nhu Quynh) cafe, where Lien works, 
for breakfast.  The three sisters lovingly prepare their mother's memorial
banquet of traditional delicacies, prepared as much for look as taste,
while giggling over the differences between the sexes.</P>
<P>After the family breaks from the banquet, we learn that Suong's young son 
'little monkey' is doted upon, but there's a distance developing with her 
husband Quoc (Chu Ngoc Hung), who's leaving for one of his habitual botanical 
photography trips.  Middle sister Khanh (Tran Manh Cuong) tells her writer
husband she's pregnant before he leaves on a trip to Saigon to research Tuan,
a mysterious man in his mother-in-law's past.  Lien keeps crawling into Hai's
bed at night, causing him to fall out of it.  The initial serenity we witnessed
starts turning into a soap opera before coming to full circle one month
later, as the three women prepare their father's memorial banquet.</P>
<P>"The Vertical Ray of the Sun" is a contemplative piece where strong passions
exist underneath calm exteriors.  Sly humor, self deceit and harsh truths
all exist in the cyclic screenplay.  Tran Anh Hung and his cinematographer Mark
Lee Ping-Bin ("Flowers of Shanghai") linger over and repeat the small gestures
of everyday life - a wife washes her husbands hands, a woman makes water
dance in a bowl, a man pulls his lover to face him before they part.  Small
spaces such as rooms, alleys and courtyards create intimacy.  The color green,
symbolizing life and tranquility, is used heavily in the film's visual styling,
lapsing into yellowish hues and blues.</P>
<P>Writer/director Tran Anh Hung's film recalls Ang Lee's "Eat Drink Man Woman,"
another tale of three sisters of varying modernity coming together
traditionally for a parent.  But while Lee's more traditionally story-driven
film resulted in radical changes for all concerned, "The Vertical Ray of the 
Sun's" characters strive for peaceful harmony.  Watching it is like trailing
your fingertips in a stream on a cool spring day.</P>
