<PRE>102 Dalmatians
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2000 - filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>It's always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children --
are either walking out early or are half-asleep when the credits roll at
the end of a film.  That about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102
Dalmatians, a cold pea soup of cute animals, stupid Home Alone antics, a
boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans, and Glenn Close reprising
her best Joan Crawford impression.  Indeed, Walt Disney is rolling over
in his grave again, cursing John Hughes' name for making the original
live-action 101 Dalmatians, one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time,
and now its sequel.</P>
<P>The main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 Dalmatians is its
predecessor, 101 Dalmatians.  The original made more than $100 million
dollars at the box office, spawned a torrid collection of "collectible"
items that ended up months later in the discount bins of Wal-Marts
across the country, and generally made every kid on the planet want a
damn Dalmatian pup for Christmas.  Well, it's been about four years
since then, and Dalmatian fever is coming back, and this time it's
digitally enhanced.</P>
<P>Here's the story.  Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close) is released from prison
due to the "cure" of her puppy homicide urges by one Dr. Pavlov.  (Oh,
how witty.)  She rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a
probation officer, who oddly turns out to be her victim from the
original film.</P>
<P>Cruella then becomes Ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists, like a
dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck, and she becomes
the evil vixen again.  A kidnapping plot unfurls again as Cruella
decides she still needs her Dalmatian coat, but she now needs 102
Dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 Dalmatian formula.  At this
point, I was envying those kids filing out of the theater.</P>
<P>How low have Glenn Close and Gerard Depardieu (as the film's villain)
sunk in the film business?  It's almost laughable in a sadistic way to
watch Close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the
wardrobe of Flash Gordon.  And Depardieu... how can a French guy have a
bad French accent?  And never mind the toilet brush haircut.</P>
<P>The only minutely positive selling point I can even think to point out
is the talking bird with a British accent (courtesy of Eric Idle) that
thinks he's a Rottweiler.  Now that's funny.</P>
