Magnolia  (8/10) </PRE>
<P>Magnolia is writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's follow-up to Boogie
Nights. This time, Anderson has come over all Robert Altman, resisting
traditional notions of narrative and instead taking a huge cast of
characters and weaving together a series of vaguely interconnected
stories, some of which come to a resolution of sorts, others of which
are left dangling. Story hardly seems to matter in this swirling mix of
rejection, death, loneliness, coercion, unfulfilled promise, abandonment
and coincidence.</P>
<P>The film has a cast to die for, and includes particularly good
performances from Jason Robards, who plays a dying man and looks really
very ill indeed, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (surely Hollywood's new
superstar among character actors) as Robards's nurse, and John C. Reilly
as a lonely cop. There are, though, a couple of disappointments from
usually excellent actors. William H. Macy plays an ineffectual man
turned bungling criminal and gives what is little more than a reprise of
his performance in Fargo, and Julianne Moore plays a character so whiney
and unstable that she descends from being merely unconvincing and
laughable to being positively annoying. Perhaps surprisingly, given the
acting talent on show, the standout performance is given by Tom Cruise,
who has never been better. All teeth and flashing eyes, he plays a
motivational guru promoting his monstrous Seduce and Destroy program for
predatory males. Cruise excels as he repels, explaining to his whooping
followers that he is about to show them "how to fake being kind and
caring". Later, when an interviewer offends him with a line of
questioning about his family background, the smile fades and he grows
silent. "What are you doing?" she asks. "I'm quietly judging you," he
replies. I have always had my suspicions that Stanley Kubrick's methods
were not suited to getting the best out of actors. All that time locked
away making Eyes Wide Shut and at the end of it Cruise was middling at
best. Here he is simply terrific, and all credit to him for taking this
part in an ensemble piece, rather than just signing up for more obvious
star-vehicles such as Mission: Impossible 2.</P>
<P>Technically, Magnolia, is big-budget American indie at its best and is
beautifully photographed by Robert Elswit. Some haunting songs by Aimee
Mann feature in several key sequences, including an effective scene in
which we cut from one strand of the film to the next and see each of the
main characters singing along to the same melancholy song. In some
scenes, the songs are so high up in the sound mix that the dialogue is
virtually inaudible, suggesting that the lyrics have more to say than
the characters. The opening pre-credits sequence, narrated by
actor/magician Ricky Jay, establishes the theme of meaningful
coincidence in people's lives, and is the best short film the Coen
brothers never made. This macabrely funny sequence, and the
magnificently bizarre meteorological conditions near the end of the
filmThis macabrely funny sequence, and the magnificently bizarre
meteorological conditions near the end of the film, are moments of light
relief in an otherwise pretty oppressive movie. (The strange climactic
weather event is a delightful surprise, although those with a detailed
knowledge of the Old Testament are given a couple of clues to what's
coming.)</P>
<P>If I had my sarcastic cynic head on, I might suggest that Magnolia must
be important because it's over three hours long, and it must be profound
because it's so depressing. In a fairer mood, I'd say that although
Magnolia teeters on the edge of self-indulgence and pretension, it is
still an ambitious and impressive mosaic of failed and corrupt but
ultimately redeemable lives.</P>
