<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>It's somewhat ironic that I saw "East-West" the evening after viewing Rod
Lurie's "The Contender". Both are politically charged movies which,
although laudable in broad strokes, fail to achieve their full potential
because they adopt an overtly simplistic approach to their subject 
matter. For "The Contender", it was a matter of dismissing potent dramatic
issues in favour of an easy, quick-fix resolution designed to make the
audience go home happy. In the case "East-West", the problem is somewhat
more ingrained.</P>
<P>Featuring French and Russian dialogue (with English subtitles), 
"East-West" is the decade-spanning story of Frenchwoman Marie Golovin
(Sandrine Bonnaire), whose husband Alexei (Oleg Menchikov) is one of
thousands of Russians being wooed back to their homeland in the aftermath
of World War II. The film, directed by Regis Wargnier, starts
beautifully as we watch the homeward-bound Russians celebrating in a 
sumptuous ship's cabin. Then, without warning, we are deposited into the
terrifying midst of the Soviet empire: as the passengers disembark, they
are immediately herded into two groups, depending on whether or not the
Kremlin believes them to be "imperialist spies".</P>
<P>Marie is initially amongst the condemned, and survives only because of the
pleas of her husband, a renowned doctor. They are sent to live in a
crowded residence housing several other families. Alexei becomes the head
of medicine at a factory while Marie does the laundry for a military
choir. They are constantly watched, though, and when the residence's
supervisor makes the mistake of revealing to Marie that she knows French,
she is soon relieved of her duties and taken away. The woman's grandson
Sacha (Sergei Bodrov Jr), now homeless, is taken in by the Golovins. 
Marie, disillusioned with her husband's apparent unwillingness to stand up
to the state, begins a passionate affair with Sacha. Together, they plot
to escape Russia by taking advantage of Sacha's position as a member of
the Soviet swim team.</P>
<P>"East-West" is a visual treat, as Wargnier fills the screen with contrasts
that are, naturally enough, both entrancing and horrifying. The stark
beauty of the Russian landscape is set tantalisingly against the sheer
brutality of the Communist regime. (The snowswept image of the pond where
Sacha trains, now frozen over with ice, is particularly memorable.) Scenes
of romance and tenderness are tempered by the knowledge that everyone is
being watched and nobody can be trusted. Even Sacha's triumph in
qualifying for the national swim team is offset by the fact that it has
been engineered for darker, more desperate purposes -- and the powers that
be may or may not be aware of the fact.</P>
<P>But unfortunately, Wargnier fails to conjure a story compelling enough to
live up to his stirring images. "East-West" is far too conventional in its
structure, dwelling not on the oppression of the Supreme Soviet but
instead on Marie's efforts to escape the country. It is the Cold War
reduced to its most simplistic form -- Communism is bad, democracy is
good, and shades of grey are all but nonexistent. "East-West" would have
been better served if Wargnier had opted to more strongly establish the
effect of the political climate on everyday Russian life. Instead, he
concentrates mostly on the more extreme aspects of the regime, such as a
Gestapo agent who is almost cartoonish in his villainy.</P>
<P>The result is that Wargnier loses touch with his characters. "East-West" 
is a movie that looks like a very personal drama, but is executed more
like a particularly slow-moving Tom Clancy thriller. None of the leads
enjoy much depth, and Menchikov is particularly ill-served by the flimsy,
tepid Alexei. Both Bonnaire and Bodrov bring a lot of vitality to their
roles, but have little personality. They are thinly-veiled stereotypes; 
Marie is the Westerner trapped behind the Iron Curtain, Sacha the
Easterner rebelling against his Communist masters.</P>
<P>Wargnier never effectively conveys the ties between the characters. Marie
and Alexei feel less like husband and wife than casual acquaintances. When
their marriage begins to break down and both begin affairs with other
people, it is an almost casual occurrence. "East-West" feels populated by
shadows, gliding through events without every truly becoming involved in
them. There is no resonance to the drama being played out.</P>
<P>Even Catherine Deneuve, portraying a French stage actress named Gabrielle
who may be Marie's most important ally, seems to be struggling to lend
substance to her character. To make matters worse, Deneuve brings such
presence to the film that she dominates any scene in which she appears; 
Bonnaire and the others simply cannot compete. This would be fine if
Gabrielle played a more central role in "East-West", but she does not; she
is a facilitator, whose emotional stakes in the drama are limited at best.</P>
<P>Ultimately, then, "East-West" is a lovely but disaffecting drama which
settles for simplicity when it should be striving for depth. Lacking the
complexity of characterisation and depiction needed to effectively explore
the themes it proffers, "East-West" ends up being little more than a
pretty (and chilling) pictorial of the Soviet Union in the middle part of
this century. This, in of itself, is not altogether without merit.
"East-West", however, could have been much more.</P>
