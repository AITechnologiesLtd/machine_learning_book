<PRE>                               THE BEST MAN</PRE>
<P>Poignant would be a good one-word description of this love story which
takes place in Italy just as the 1900s is coming to an end.   It is a
time when most women had no idea of what love can be.   While they made
excellent mothers, and even very good wives, they thought that being
obedient, faithful, dutiful to their husbands was what marriage and love
were all about.  Great emotion escaped them.</P>
<P>In THE BEST MAN, however,  Francesca (the Spanish actress Ines
Sastre) a young lady who is to be married to somene chosen by her
parents, is suddenly, uncontrollably attracted to her husband's best
friend. At the wedding, she pledges in her own mind, even as she says
the vows, that she is really marrying Angelo (Diego Abantantuono),
who has just returned from the United States after being away for 15
years, now a wealthy, handsome man.</P>
<P>Francesca hardly cares who knows her feelings but Angelo cautions her
that this infatuation will ruin her life.   Although Angelo reciprocates
her love, he is able to be more sensibly prudent. Nevertheless they share
a stolen, passionate kiss.  Even Angelo's confession that he did not earn
the money but inherited it from his hard-working brother does nothing to
change Francesca's love.</P>
<P>Husband Edgardo (Dario Cantarelli) has found an old flame of Angelo's,
Olimpia (Valeria D'Obici)  and surprises him by inviting her to his home.
Angelo tells Francesca there is no alternative, he cannot stay with her
as it would be a scandal, so he must leave with Olimpia.   Francesca runs
away to a church where she lives and teaches, never forgetting her true
love.   Need I add that the story does not end there?</P>
