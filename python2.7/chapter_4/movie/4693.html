<PRE>                               BEAUTIFUL GIRLS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     With a cryptic title like BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, one starts to wonder to
whom this film is being marketed.  Is it the frat boy model-ogling crowd? 
Is it a self-help flick for teenage girls?  Is it soft porn?  The answer,
of course, is none of these:  BEAUTIFUL GIRLS is a *date movie*, and quite
a good one at that.</P>
<P>     Something like THE BIG CHILL meets Generation X, BEAUTIFUL GIRLS is
one of those ensemble character movies that really defies description in
terms of plot points.  The ostensible main character is Willie (Timothy
Hutton), who is ambivalent about girlfriend Tracy (Annabeth Gish) so heads
back home to Knight's Ridge, Massachusetts to sort things out during his
10-year high school reunion.  Here, he hooks up with old pals Tommy (Matt
Dillon) and Paul (Michael Rapaport), each of whom is also flailing
helplessly in his own romantic mess.</P>
<P>     The "beautiful girls" in question include Sharon (MIGHTY APRHODITE's
Mira Sorvino), Tommy's girlfriend, and Darian (Lauren Holly), Tommy's
*other* girlfriend.  Jan (Martha Plimpton) is Paul's seven-year-long
lover, who's now dating the local butcher.  Then there's the visiting
heartbreaker Andera (Uma Thurman) and 13-year-old
"heartbreaker-in-training" Marty (Natalie Portman).  And don't forget a
special appearance by "Elle Macpherson"...Paul's Saint Bernard.</P>
<P>     The entanglements of the some 17 major cast members could fill pages
and would spoil the film.  Suffice it to say that they are mostly very
funny and realistic to boot.  After an awkward and confusing start,
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS really hits hard as a comedy and a romance without
becoming mushy and stilted like your average twentysomething date flick. 
And even more incredible is that director Ted Demme and writer Scott
Rosenberg have managed to imbue every character with life and originality,
something many filmmakers have trouble doing with just one or two.</P>
<P>     The acting is all top-notch, including the big surprise of Rosie
O'Donnell's best 10 minutes of her career, playing the local beautician. 
The young Portman is just fantastic, and Hutton also brings some real
emotion to his role (hopefully this will revive his career).</P>
<P>     And in case you're used to my crusty opinions and think I'm being
rough, my guest insisted BEAUTIFUL GIRLS was one of the best films she'd
ever seen.  Regardless, even if we're both overestimating this picture,
it's still worth a look.</P>
