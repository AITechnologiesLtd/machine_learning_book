<PRE>                             UN COEUR EN HIVER
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is just about the best film I
     could think of about a love triangle.  Most of the film
     revolves around the personality of one of the main
     characters, which is only gradually revealed in the film, so
     I will refrain from discussing it.  This is a thoughtful,
     intelligent film and one of the best I have seen this year.
     Rating: low +3 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     For many years Stephan (played by Daniel Auteuil) and Maxim (played by
Andre Dussolier) have been partners in a violin repair business in Paris.
Where Maxim is handsome and affable, Stephan is introspective and
introverted.  In the years of their partnership Maxim has been married and
divorced and has dated many women.  Stephan has little life outside of the
repair business.  He is a genius in building and repairing violins.  He has
one friend, a woman, in whom he confides, but their relationship is purely
platonic.  Maxim's latest girlfriend is Camille, a brilliant and beautiful
violinist (played by Emmanuelle Beart) who takes an instant dislike to the
blunt Stephan, but when it is clear that Stephan appreciates Camille's
music, Camille becomes interested in the odd loner.  The stage is set for a
tragic love story.</P>
<P>     UN COEUR EN HIVER revolves around about Stephan's unusual personality,
which is revealed only gradually through the film.  Suffice it to say this
is a much more touching and engaging film than could be expected from the
above description.  Stephan is a personality type rarely seen in film, yet
not nearly so rare in real life.  I went into this film expecting a fatuous
love story and came out with a film that will almost definitely be on my top
ten list of the year.  Stephan's personality, what it does to him, and how
others use it and react to it make this a thoughtful and intelligent
addition to the films of this year.  UN COEUR EN HIVER was directed by
Claude Sautet from a screenplay he co-authored with Jacques Fieschi.  Scenes
of Emmanuelle Beart playing Ravel (beautifully orchestrated by Philippe
Sarde) have a pristine beauty that is as sexy as anything you will find in
any American film this year.  I give it a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
