<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Joe Mitchell (Tucci) is a transplanted southerner living in New York
City in the 1940s, earning his keep by writing for The New Yorker
magazine. He speaks in a hesitatingly slow, thick southern drawl, and is
a very modest, inward man. He is always the gentleman, and appears to be
vulnerable to criticism, even unduly concerned when his elementary
school-aged daughter thinks one of the stories he is working on is
boring. When his editor Mr. Ross (Tovatt) compliments him on a story he
turned in, he seems too shy to accept the praise without stammering. He
is comfortably ensconced into his New York Greenwich Village apartment,
living there with his wife Therese (Hope Davis) and his two young
daughters.</P>
<P>Joe's life will be altered forever when he decides to write a feature
story on a homeless, Harvard educated, bohemian, the legendary Joe Gould
(Sir Ian Holm). Gould is a disheveled, raving madman, living off his wit
and charm to get handouts from those in the Village sympathetic to his
plight, in what he playfully calls the Joe Gould Fund that he has
established to take care of his basest needs. He has dedicated his life
for the last 25 years or so to writing a literary tome entitled "The
Oral History of Our Time." So far he has supposedly written over a
million-words to record his essays and the ordinary conversations people
have. He claims to have stored most of the writings in the basement of a
chicken farm in Long Island, writings that are composed in a school
composition book. But when asked to produce these writings by Mitchell,
he can only come up with two books of essays.</P>
<P>His life is a difficult one, where his level of discomfort is beyond
reasonable expectations. He is also too gabby, too drunk, too much of a
liar, and cannot discipline himself to write as much as he talks. But he
is not dull. At one Poetry Society recital, he propels himself onstage
to recite his comical zen ditty as an opposite response to all the
stuffy poems from the society members: "In the winter I'm a Buddhist, In
the summer I'm a nudist."</P>
<P>All the film's energy goes into Ian Holm's stellar performance. Gould is
personified as a fiery maniac and first-class exhibitionist, who when
painted by Alice Neel (Sarandon), an artist who is quite taken with him
as a genuine bohemian character, she nevertheless unromantically paints
his portrait by giving him three penises, as she says one won't be
enough for him. He does most of his performing at a few local Village
bars, where he is given free drinks. The actual bar he hung out in was
The Minetta Tavern, where he was viewed as a tourist attraction.</P>
<P>Joe Mitchell had great success with the 1942 story he did on Gould,
entitled Professor Sea Gull, where he wrote about the strange man in
terms of being a folk hero, telling how he can communicate with seagulls
and about his history tome. The magazine story made him a local
celebrity.</P>
<P>Mitchell tells how he first met Gould in a Greek luncheonette, where the
owner lets him have a free bowl of soup, whereby Gould insanely pours in
a whole bottle of ketchup.</P>
<P>After Mitchell finished the well-received story, he couldn't get rid of
Gould, who made himself a nuisance by visiting his office daily. They
then went their separate ways. In 1964, Mitchell wrote Joe Gould's
Secrets, which had a more downbeat tone to it than his first Gould
story. Strangely enough, he seemed to have caught something of Gould's
madcap psychological state himself or became enveloped by Gould's
doppelganger, because he never was able to write again for the magazine,
though he still reported to work there until he died in 1996.</P>
<P>Joe Gould after living in countless homeless shelters and on the street,
died as a pauper and in a mentally unbalanced state at Pilgrim State
Hospital on Long Island in 1957, with his tome never found, as Joe
Mitchell knew it wouldn't be.</P>
<P>This is a wonderful screen adaption, as scripted by Howard A. Rodman,
who caught the nostalgic and generous mood of Greenwich Village of the
1940s. Ian Holm's performance is brilliant and sparkling, one of his
best in his long and distinguished career. Stanley Tucci mirrors the
inward struggle Gould has in writing down what he feels, even though
they have completely opposite personalities. There's gold to be mined in
this story about understanding writers who can't write anymore and of
characters who can't stop themselves from destroying their gift of life.
This cautionary story pictures a city that has changed so much from Joe
Gould's time, that a talented eccentric nowadays should expect to
receive no help from a city that is becoming less interested in helping
its weirdo artists or its mentally ill, instead turning its attention to
more mundane concerns.</P>
