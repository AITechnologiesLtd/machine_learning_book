                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1995 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     Recently, Ireland has produced a number of interesting and
intelligent films.  The latest Irish-import, CIRCLE OF FRIENDS, is a
smart and charming  coming-of-age drama that provides a thoughtful look
at the complexities of young romance.</P>
<P>     The film follows the romance of Benny (Minnie Driver) and Jack
(Chris O'Donnell), two Irish college students experiencing love and
romance for the first time.  Their romance is contrasted with separate
romances experienced by Benny's two closest friends: repressed Eve
(Geraldine O'Rawe) and worldly Nan (Saffron Burrows).</P>
<P>     Much of the film's appeal comes from the thoughtful and believable
way that screenwriter Andrew Davies (working from a novel by Maeve
Binchy) has these characters approach issues of relationships and
sexuality.  The film is set in 1957 and does reflect the more openly
conservative values of the time, but the writing still seems
contemporary thanks to the writer's recognition that most of the base
feelings and concerns in these areas never change all that much.</P>
<P>     The movie is at its best when it simply has the main characters
talking to each other.  We discover that Benny and Jack are right for
each other during some wonderful early sequences where they go on walks
together and find that they are able to freely talk with one another
about anything.  The physical attraction between the characters isn't
ignored, but the film makes it clear that the emotional and
intellectual attraction is what really counts the most.</P>
<P>     Davies and director Pat O'Connor wisely keep the secondary
romances involving Eve and Nan in the background, only using them to
provide counterpoints to the main romance between Benny and Jack. Eve
is an orphan that was raised by nuns in a convent, giving her extremely
traditional Catholic views.  Her romance with another college boy
(Aiden Gillen) is marked by an interesting combination curiosity and a
desire to remain true to her values.  Nan, on the other hand, is much
more worldly and quicker to jump head first into a passionate affair
with an older man (Colin Firth).  Both of these romances are used to
contrast Benny and Jack's romance with more extreme examples.  A twist
in Nan's romance also eventually provides some conflict into several of
the film's key relationships.</P>
<P>     One refreshing aspect of the film is the very realistic way that
religion is included as a major factor in the characters' lives.  The
girls are all Irish Catholics and many of their conversations include
some discussion of the conflict between their religious beliefs and
their natural curiosity about sex.  It is rare today that a film treats
religious values as a subject worthy of thoughtful discussion.</P>
<P>     The one major part of the film that doesn't work is an unfortunate
subplot involving Sean (Alan Cumming), a clerk at Benny's store who is
a rival for her affections.  This subplot is very ineptly played and it
winds up being an unwelcome distraction.  The big mistake is making
Sean into an >obvious< villain in the film.  Cumming plays him as a
smirking, weasily character and O'Connor stages his scenes to make him
appear as unflattering as possible.  To top it all off, composer
Michael Kamen greets his every appearance with obviously sinister
music.  It is made clear from the start that Benny has no romantic
interest in Sean and that he is strictly her parents' choice for her.
Since he is such an unpleasant individual, though, we never can see why
>they< would see anything in him either.  The character simply doesn't
serve any useful purpose in the film and the time wasted on him could
have been better spent developing the relationship between Benny and
Jack even further.</P>
<P>     Minnie Driver's performance is one of the best reasons to see this
film.  She is a very smart and charming presence who easily carries
every scene that she is in.  The film makes the point that she is a bit
overweight and generally plain-looking, but she has an inner-beauty
that is instantly recognizable.  In an early scene, Jack very
accurately describes Benny as a "solid" personality who truly knows who
she is and what she wants.  Driver's very smart and sincere performance
clearly conveys this to the audience.</P>
<P>     Chris O'Donnell is developing a lot of skill as a strong
supporting actor.  He is a very generous actor who truly knows when to
stand back and let other actors dominate the scene.  In this film,
Benny is very much the central character and it is important to let
Jack be primarily defined by her reactions to him.  O'Donnell is able
to do this, quietly playing off of Driver's more dominating performance
to create an interesting chemistry.  It takes a lot of skill for an
actor to know when to stay out of the way.</P>
<P>     CIRCLE OF FRIENDS is a small, pleasant film with some very
thoughtful and intelligent dialog and a tremendously good lead
performance by Minnie Driver.  The film is marred somewhat by the
unfortunate subplot involving the store clerk, but the parts of the
film that work are easily able to overcome the parts that don't.</P>
