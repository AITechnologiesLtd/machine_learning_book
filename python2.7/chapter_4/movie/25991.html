<P>     THE WAY OF THE GUN -- the directing debut by Oscar-winning
screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (THE USUAL SUSPECTS) -- opens the way
you always hope a film will open: with so much energy and potential that
the whole theater seems electrified. In that opening, a pair of career
criminals identified simply as "Parker" (Ryan Phillippe) and "Longbaugh" 
(Benicio Del Toro) perch on the hood of a car in a nightclub parking lot,
drawing the ire of the car's owner and his loud-mouthed female companion. 
The scene is violent, profane, surprising and hilarious. As a tone-setter,
it's marvelous; as a stand-alone piece of writing and directing, it's
hella-fun.</P>
<P>     Filled with individual moments of loopy creativity, genuinely
unsettling violence and wicked dialogue, THE WAY OF THE GUN should have
been one of the best films of the year (though in a painfully lackluster
2000, it still has a shot at that dubious honor). The only reason it's not
is a fundamental narrative miscalculation on McQuarrie's part: There's no
good reason for Parker and Longbaugh to be the film's ostensible
protagonists. The story follows the pair as they launch their latest
scheme, which involves kidnapping a nine-month-pregnant surrogate mother
named Robin (Juliette Lewis). They know the baby's biological parents are
paying Robin $1 million for the child, so they know there's money to be
had. What they don't know is that the father, Hale Chidduck (Scott 
Wilson), launders money for organized crime. They also don't know that
Chidduck can call on associates like Joe Sarno (James Caan), who has a
knack for dealing with problems like Parker and Longbaugh.</P>
<P>     For at least the first half-hour, THE WAY OF THE GUN is so skillfully
rendered that it seems destined for glory. From Parker and Longbaugh's
torment of a clerk at a sperm bank, to the unconventional staging of the
kidnapping itself, to the splendid slow-speed chase that follows,
McQuarrie twists the crime caper genre 90 degrees at virtually every
opportunity. Even playing the Tarantino comparison card doesn't entirely
do justice to McQuarrie's ability to throw a wrench into expectations. The
connections between the characters become evident only after a bit of
reflection; there's no guarantee that bad-asses still won't get their bad
asses kicked, or that those who appear likely to take the most punishment
might not end up dishing it out. It's almost never exactly what you expect
it to be.</P>
<P>     And, in at least one case, that's not exactly a compliment. As THE
WAY OF THE GUN unfolds, it gradually becomes evident that the true
protagonist of the story is not Parker and Longbaugh. That distinction
goes to Caan's Sarno, a veteran tough guy with his own priorities in the
whole kidnapping episode. While a flurry of sub-plots spin through the
film -- attempts by Chidduck's two chief bodyguards (Taye Diggs and Nicky
Katt) to double-cross their boss; the manipulations of Chidduck's young
wife (Kristin Lehman); the obstetrician (Dylan Kussman) with a tragic past
-- it's ultimately Sarno's story. McQuarrie, however, never seems aware of
that fact. He lingers on Parker and Longbaugh as though they were the
modern-day Butch and Sundance suggested by their names, despite the fact
that we're almost never allowed inside the criminals' heads. Telling the
story largely from their perspective isn't a celebration of the
anti-hero; it's a narrative blunder.</P>
<P>     Is that blunder enough to throw THE WAY OF THE GUN entirely off
course? Fortunately not. The climax at a Mexican brothel showcases both a
nerve-wracking episode of impromptu surgery and a good old-fashioned
shoot-out (with a couple of new-fashioned variations). McQuarrie's
compositions are unusually rich for a writer-turned-director -- watch for
Mrs. Chidduck appearing in the background and at the edge of the frame --
yet he still ends on a kicker of a line of dialogue. The only thing
missing from THE WAY OF THE GUN is soul, the soul that would have been
provided by Sarno as its center. It's a good film that's a 90 degree twist
away from greatness -- the one 90 degree twist McQuarrie didn't take.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 unusual suspects:  7.</PRE>
