<P>   "This city'll kill ya," says Mary (Patricia Arquette), a
depressed New Yorker who has been clean for years but is
now drifting back into drugs to bury her pain.  Her comment
could be taken metaphorically, but for the people in Martin
Scorsese's new and gritty movie, a film that like all others by
that gifted director relies only minimally on tired formulas, the
suggestion is in fact literally true.  The screenplay, written by
long-term Scorsese collaborator Paul Schrader from a novel
by Joe Connelly, is not the sort that the Big Apple Tourist
Board would promote.  "Bringing Out the Dead," which takes
place in the early 1990s and is situated in the grimy Hell's
Kitchen area of the West 40s (the scene as well of Leonard
Bernstein and Arthur Laurents' musical "West Side Story"),
depicts a city badly in need of a strong mayor and a heavy
dose of moral fiber.  It could, in fact, have served as a
campaign video for Rudy Giuliani, who became its current
resident in Gracie Mansion on a promise to tighten law
enforcement and employ a zero-tolerance policy toward
malefactors.  While "Bringing Out the Dead" bears a strong
Scorsese imprint (in some ways a virtual sequel to his 1976
masterwork "Taxi Driver"), life in the city's lower depths
serves as mere background, however intensive, for an
exploration of its central characters who are each grieving for
a lost opportunity and seek closure in each other's
companionship.  This is also Nicolas Cage's finest
performance since his equally somber role as an alcoholic
determined to drink himself to death in Mike Figgis's
wonderful 1995 film "Leaving Las Vegas."</P>
<P>   This time around, Cage performs in the role of Frank
Pierce, a paramedic who drives an ambulance on the night
shift with three distinctly different partners, and who regrets
that he has not saved a life in many moons.  The movie is
chock full of leathery scenes, many portraying Gorky-like
depths of depravity.   "Bringing Out the Dead"--based
perhaps on the daily rounds made by its novelist, Joe
Connelly, who was himself a paramedic--is likely as not to
make you wonder why people choose high-stress
occupations which for all the strain do not pay princely sums
to their agents.  Scorcese's movie, not for anyone who insists
on a "good story" with a tight plot, takes us a three-day
physical and psychological ride with Frank, with his three
fellow drivers, and with the crew manning the emergency
room of an overburdened New York City hospital
appropriately named Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy. 
   The burnt-out Frank, who openly and self-destructively
challenges his boss (played in a small role by Martin
Scorcese himself), to fire him, patrols the streets of the West
Forties with his quirky partners, radio frequently jumping to
life with emergency assignments.  As Frank occasionally
narrates his story in a voiceover, we follow him as he
responds to a call regarding an old man in cardiac arrest
whose entire family jumps each time Frank administers a
shock from a defibrillator. Other calls, treated more routinely,
include the picking up of a suicidal man; the parking of a
chronic drunk into a wheelchair prior to his transport to the
hospital; and the pursuit of an addicted, violent, and paranoid
man named Noel (Marc Anthony) who regularly cries out for a
cup of water.  The film's one faintly humorous scene takes
place in the crash-pad of a small-time drug seller, a regular
Mr. Cool, who appears to take his customers' problems to
heart and allows them to take much needed rests in his
apartment while the sedative effects of his merchandise kick
in.</P>
<P>   Scorsese also makes points in displaying the idiosyncrasies
of Frank's partners: Larry (John Goodman), a foodaholic who
covers up his problems by overindulging; Marcus (Ving
Rhames), a Christian fundamentalist who treats his job of
bringing back the dead as the work of Jesus; and the sadistic
Walls (Tom Sizemore), a veritable human vampire who
figuratively thirsts for blood and welcomes the cracking of the
ambulance radio that allow him to chase after mauled and
maimed victims of violence.</P>
<P>   Much of "Bringing Out the Dead" is unfortunately routine
and predictable, the stuff of TV hospital dramas and "48
Hours" style documentaries.  By now, most people are at
least vaguely aware of the unending suffering of the poor,
who seek aid in emergency rooms rather than embrace the
services of private physicians.  The druggies, the drunks, and
the crazies are not particularly interesting and we learn
nothing about them that could enlighten us to the sources of
their misery.  </P>
<P>   On the other hand, the growing relationship of Frank and
Mary (Cage and Arquette are married in real life and work
together for the first time), is compelling, particularly because
Scorsese does not push the usual buttons to establish a
romantic bond between them.  Mary has been estranged from
her father for a few years and begs the hospital staff to use
extreme measures to keep him alive.  When that becomes
increasingly unlikely, she turns to Frank, with whom she has
established a tie, and who needs her as well to get over his
repeated contacts with the ghost of an 18-year-old girl whose
life he was unable to save.  To the extent that they succeed
in redeeming each other, the movie is not a downer--contrary
to the opinion of Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern
who, in a recent commentary on CNN, turned thumbs down
simply because he felt that the film was not sufficiently feel-
good.  "Bringing Out the Dead," then, is a mixed bag--one
whose background noise is unremarkable but whose success
in establishing a compelling connection between Nicolas
Cage and Patricia Arquette is most satisfying.</P>
