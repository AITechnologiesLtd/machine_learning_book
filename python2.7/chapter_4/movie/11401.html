<PRE>Vertigo
Rating: ***1/2 (out of four)
NR, 1958
Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Written by Alex Coppel and Samuel Taylor.
Starring James Stewart, Kim Novak.</PRE>
<P>Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" is the rare top-flight, well-acclaimed film that
succeeds despite a somewhat weak screenplay. While many modern movies throw
logic out the window in the name of  pointless action sequences and
explosions, "Vertigo" throws it out the window for the sake of emotional
resonance, ironic twists, and thematic coherence. The film is based on a
French novel, which makes me think that Hitchcock decided he wanted to adapt
the novel to film but hired screenwriters who, while careful to preserve the
most essential themes, failed to fit these themes into a tighter plot.</P>
<P>It is fortunate, then, that Hitchcock and his leads, James Stewart and Kim
Novak, seem to know exactly what they're doing here, because a less competent
team of director and actors would have ended up with little more than a
muddled psychological thriller. Instead, they deliver what starts out as an
intriguing mystery and turns into a tragic love story, a story of a doomed
romance based on deceptive appearances and obsession rather than on real
understanding or emotional connection. Hitchcock is known as the  "master of
suspense," but it is the final half hour of the film, after the mystery has
evaporated and the film focuses on the relationship between two desolate and
frankly sick characters, that is the most powerful.</P>
<P>As the film begins, we are introduced to ex-police detective John "Scotty"
Ferguson (Stewart), who has quit the force after an incident in which another
officer was killed in a high-altitude chase due to Scotty's fear of heights
and resulting inability to climb a roof. Scotty is approached by a friend of
his who claims that his wife Madeline (Novak) has been behaving strangely and
may be possessed by the spirit of a suicidal Hispanic woman from the 19th
century. Scotty reluctantly agrees to follow her and report back on her
activities so as to ascertain the cause of her odd behavior. Before long,
however, he develops a romantic obsession with Madeline, and when he saves her
from an apparent suicide attempt, the two fall in love and begin carrying on
an affair. He can't seem to save her from her apparent possession, and
eventually she acts out the destiny of the deceased woman and plunges to her
death from a church tower.</P>
<P>Grief-stricken and withdrawn, Scotty spends several years in a mental
hospital, then is released only to cross paths with a woman who is the
spitting image of Madeline. Her name, however, is Judy Barton, and she
claims to know nothing of Scotty or Madeline. Scotty won't leave her alone,
however, and the way in which he insists she make herself over to look exactly
like Madeline did, as well as her curious complicity, is truly disturbing and
perverse as portrayed by Stewart and Novak. Hitchcock handles  these
psychological themes deftly, particularly in the long, mostly dialogue-free
scenes in the beginning of the film in which Scotty follows Madeline from
place to place. This transplants Scotty's obsession with Madeline to the
audience, making the shift in perspective towards the end when we discover how
truly flawed he is  as a protagonist all the more powerful and frightening.</P>
<P>It is a shame, then, that the script was not any better, because "Vertigo"
might have been a true four-star masterpiece if the writing had been a little
more polished. For one thing, some of the dialogue is just plain silly, such
as when the condition which requires the commitment of the nearly vegetative
Scotty to a mental hospital is described as "melancholia, combined with a
guilt complex"; I know many people who could be said to be suffering from both
of those conditions, and none of them are catatonic. More notably, the
connection between Madeline and Judy and Scotty hinges on a rather bizarre and
excessively complex scheme, while not completely implausible, is not the sort
of thing in which most rational human beings would get themselves involved.
There are other instances of illogical behavior or plot development which seem
to indicate that the screenwriters were so intent on capturing the
psychological themes of obsession and love for an illusion that they didn't
bother to make sure that the story made sense.</P>
<P>"Vertigo" is not quite a masterpiece, and certainly Hitchcock, Stewart, and
Novak deserved a better script to back up their outstanding work in this film.
But, even in the absence of one, they follow through on what is, if nothing
else, a very intriguing premise, with enough force that the occasional
falterings of the script are almost forgotten in the face of the film's
powerful psychological impact.</P>
