<P>     More gratuitous garbage-- ah, the joys of summer-- this one a re-
lentlessly cheery romantic comedy that entertains with as much reckless
abandon any of those bloated boy toys, such as SPEED 2 or CON AIR, only
with broader laughs and big, goofy grins in place of the bombs, bullets,
and other things that go boom in the night.  Julia Roberts-- remember
her?-- plays a neurotic restaurant critic who, for no apparent reason,
decides to sabotage the wedding of her best friend (Dermot Mulroney).
See, they made a pact, years ago, to marry if each was still single at
age 28.  So, on the very day that she recalls this fact, just like that,
out the blue, he calls, not to propose, but, rather, to tell of his
*own*, few-days-away wedding.  This drives her nuts and for reasons that
the film never bothers to explain.  Worse, the bride-to-be (Cameron
Diaz, playing a prep princess) just up and starts loving her on the
spot, putting Roberts' character in an increasingly uncomfortable,
increasingly jealous, and, heh, increasingly *advantageous* position.
(There's even a cat fight.  And in a ballpark restroom, no less!)</P>
<P>     With Ms. Roberts beaming brighter than she's been in any number of
years, a frothy supporting cast that doesn't frown much, either, a huge,
high-dollar wedding ceremony at the end, and enough overall sunshine to
blind any Batpatron unlucky enough to stumble into the wrong theater, MY
BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is the perfect summer movie to laugh, coo, and get
all warm and fuzzy with.  Needless to say, I didn't buy a minute of it,
mostly because there's no core character motivation for Roberts' char-
acter.  Bam, she's racing to the airport, cigarette in hand and mayhem
on her mind.  (Do I recall a scene from the trailer, where Roberts is
rehearsing the reasons she can't get married, thinking that her friend
is calling to cash in on their pact?) Sure, she's funny, falling off
beds and knocking over dinner trays.  Sure, we feel her pain-of-the-
moment, though, really, what kind of best friend sabotages the other
one's wedding?  And then she pauses to flash that mega-watt smile and
everything is forgotten, except for how sore your bottom might be.  (Or,
as I noticed, how much her voice, over an answering machine, sounds like
Mary Tyler Moore's.)</P>
<P>     Director P.J. Hogan (MURIEL'S WEDDING), unafraid to try anything,
includes several musical numbers, ranging from the insipid (doo-wop
girls in wedding gowns over the opening credits) to the excruciatingly
insipid (an everybody-sings rendition of "I Say A Little Prayer," com-
plete with M. Emmet Walsh singing bass, if you can believe it.)  What
else helps pass the time?  Oh, there's the occasional oddball moment--
Roberts entering a plain-English Internet e-mail address, the actress
behind the wheel of a "borrowed" bread van, and her quiet moment with
PRIVATE PART's Pig Vomit, actor Paul Giamatti as a bellboy.  Let's
see... Cameron Diaz croaking karoke is a confirmed comic high point, as
is a fifteen-minute excursion into farce, when Roberts' character's
drop-dead dashing gay editor (Pierce Brosnan lookalike Rupert Everett)
pretends to be her fiance.  His attempt at public affection may well be
worth the price of admission.  Sorry about the hand.</P>
