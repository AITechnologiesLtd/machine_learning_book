                           THE FIRST POWER
                    A review in the public domain
                            by The Phantom
                      (<A HREF="mailto:baumgart@esquire.dpw.com">baumgart@esquire.dpw.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     THE FIRST POWER is what Hollywood insiders call a "high concept" film.
For those phans who aren't familiar with the term, high concept films are films
that can be pitched to agents and studio executives in one sentence.  That's
important, since most of the people in the film industry have just slightly
less patience than they have talent; a two or three paragraph summary would
have most nodding off before you could say "cut to the chase."</P>
<P>     But just because you can summarize a film's plot in one sentence doesn't
make it a high concept film, for otherwise nearly every film made since the
late 50s could be considered high concept.  How best can the Phantom explain?
Let us consider, by way of example, THE OMEN and its two sequels.  None of
these films are high concept; the original most certainly isn't, even though
its plot is far from complicated.  And its sequels, while easily described (but
alas, less easily watched), are just more of the same.  This summer's DIE HARD
2 isn't really high concept either, but it comes close ("OK, OK, so this time
Willis is in an airport, get it?").</P>
<P>     But how about our imaginary third sequel, DIE HARD 3: NOT OF THIS EARTH?
(No, the title doesn't refer to Willis' salary.)  I'll pitch it to you, phans,
and if one of you sells it to Fox remember, the Phantom wants his money above
the line.  Here's the high concept pitch: "OK, OK, so it's like DIE HARD meets
ALIENS, right?  Willis is stuck in Moonbase Alpha and meanwhile this thing
flies out and attaches itself to his ex-wife's face...."</P>
<P>     Now *that's* high concept.  The giveaway: any time you use the word
"meets" in a description, you're pitching with the best of them.</P>
<P>     This brings us, in a rather more roundabout way than usual, to the subject
of this week's review, THE FIRST POWER, a film that is nothing if not high
concept.  Here's the pitch: "OK, OK, so imagine THE OMEN but with those Brat
Pack kids, like Damien meets YOUNG GUNS, right?  And the killer's like "Freddy
meets SHOCKER," so we can throw in a lot of dream sequences.  And we'll do the
LETHAL WEAPON thing -- make it funny.  Did I leave anything out?"  And true to
its pitch, THE FIRST POWER is the epitome of high concept films.</P>
<P>     The Phantom went into THE FIRST POWER expecting an updated version of THE
OMEN, one of his all-time favorite horror films.  And to be fair, THE FIRST
POWER is exactly that, though since it's a 90s horror film, it can't help but
be influenced by the legacy of the 80s, including Jason and Michael, but most
especially Freddy.  In fact, in many ways, THE FIRST POWER is a better ELM
STREET sequel than was DREAM CHILD.</P>
<P>     Problems abound though.  For the Phantom, one of the biggest problems was
the miscasting of Lou Diamond Phillips as Logan, a cynical LA cop who heads the
investigation into a series of bizarre occult killings.  ("Bizarre occult
killings"?  The Phantom is going to have to stop writing his reviews during
Eyewitness News....)  Tracy Griffith, as Tess Seaton, the psychic who helps
Logan find the killer, doesn't help matters.  Both roles call for much older
actors, and though Lou and Tracy do their best, they really can't pull it off.
Of the two, Lou Diamond Phillips does a better job, but that's perhaps because
he has more experience than does Griffith.</P>
<P>     The film's plot is fairly simple, although its exposition is somewhat
confused.  Tess "sees" where the killer (Patrick Channing, played to the hilt
by Jeff Kober) is going to strike next.  Though she is curiously mute on the
point of *who* is he going to strike next, she tells Logan where Channing is
going to be, but only on the condition that he promise that there will be no
death penalty.  Why she believes that a cop could possibly honor such a promise
is one of the least puzzling aspects of the film, though it is sadly indicative
of the feeble plot devices that abound throughout.  In any case, suffice it to
say that Logan would have been wise to plead Channing's case before the Supreme
Court, since once he is executed, he gets much more screen time than he did
when he was just a garden variety, occult-inspired, serial killer.</P>
<P>     Indeed, it turns out that all those pentagrams that Channing had been
carving into his victims served a purpose: Channing made a deal with the Devil,
who in return has granted him what the film refers to as "the first power."  At
a very late stage in the film, the audience gets to find out what all the other
powers are (there are three), though by the time we're told, it's rather hard
to care; the "powers" seem to exist solely to explain the film's title, which
would better have been left as TRANSIT, the title by which it was known
throughout preproduction.  At least TRANSIT is original, and as a title it
makes as much sense as does anything else about the film, so perhaps then
audiences would be more prepared for the barrage of plot holes awaiting them
after the last preview is over.</P>
<P>     As to the film's title: according to a slightly deranged nun, the first
power is the power of resurrection.  The second and third powers are related to
this, though as the Phantom scored poorly on the "bogus Catholic theology" quiz
in the theater lobby, he is unable to explain precisely what those other powers
might be.  He himself had sadly lost his own first power, the power of
concentration, by the time the film had gotten around to explaining all of this
to the audience.</P>
<P>     In any case, once Channing has been dispatched, he returns in a number of
ways and in several different guises, since he has the power to take control of
the recently dead (but oh how the Phantom wished he had the power to take
control of the plot).  Sadly, Channing seems to have little motive for coming
back or not; though he pops in and out of the rest of the film (and of course
fights Logan to the death in the rather less than epic struggle at the film's
end), it's not clear why.  Surely if he wanted to kill Logan or Tess he could
just appear, push them into a bad career move, and leave.  But by the middle of
the film, there are really only three main characters, so unfortunately
Channing does not have the luxury of Freddy, Michael, or Jason; the screenplay
doesn't allow for a similar, metronome-like killing every 10 minutes.</P>
<P>     Still, things do get interesting when Channing makes an appearance, and
the audience never fails to perk up, if only because they know that an
appearance by Channing means that they'll have a badly need, though
all-too-brief, respite from Tracy Griffith's acting.  Tracy's very young face
is capable of nearly three different expressions, and we're treated to all of
them in various, usually inappropriate, combinations.  We're also treated to
dozens of scenes filled with, and focused on, her chest (though she never goes
topless).  But if there's a tight tee-shirt around, she'll wear it; if she has
to stand still, she'll be sure to throw her shoulders back; if she has to move,
she'll make every attempt to run toward the camera; and if she has to lie on
the ground, you can bet she'll be spread-eagled.  To be fair, she only lies on
the ground in one scene, but for that scene she removes her bra, just to keep
things interesting.</P>
<P>     This is, of course, nothing more than a classic case of
"naked-Ripley-syndrome" (from ALIEN: "I've just escaped the monsters, so I
better strip off all my clothes..."), and though The Phantom appreciates any
bit of sexploitation thrown his way, even he felt that someone here was going
overboard.  Tracy would be well advised to consult with Melanie or Don before
making her next film, since if this trend continues she'll have her name above
the credits for BLUE LAGOON II: THE NEXT GENERATION before she knows what hit
her.  Think, Tracy -- do you really want to be our generation's Phoebe Cates?</P>
<P>     As for Lou Diamond Phillips, he does his best, but he really looks less
than comfortable here.  He gets kicked around an awful lot in this film (in
fact the fight scenes are fabulously unrealistic -- most reminded the Phantom
of Dolph and Sly going at it in ROCKY IV), and he always appears to be dreading
the next scene.  Will it be Channing this time?  Will he be thrown off a roof?
Down a sewer?  Will the stunt-nun finally get him?  Logan's life is not an easy
one, and the Phantom was impressed with how well Phillips held up even after
taking all those kicks to the head.  Of course, the Phantom could sympathize a
little, since after THE FIRST POWER, he, too, felt like he had taken a few too
many kicks to the head -- by the time every one ends up in the sewer (no doubt
tripping over screenplays for THE SECOND POWER), he needed a score card to keep
track of who killed whom and of those, who was dead, who had been resurrected,
and who was currently possessed.</P>
<P>     But the Phantom doesn't want to paint an entirely bleak picture.  Although
it doesn't make sense for even 10 minutes, THE FIRST POWER was still
entertaining, especially if you could forgive it all of its self-contradictions
and other stupidities.  Although there are enough dream sequences to make even
Freddy roll his eyes, they're still fun to watch, and they're even occasionally
scary.  On the whole, the cinematography is above average -- the film doesn't
have that flat, mass-produced look that so many horror films have -- and Jeff
Kober does a great job as Channing.  This is the director, Robert Resnikoff's,
first film, and he does a fairly good job, given the absurdity of a screenplay
he had to work with.  Resnikoff has a good feel for horror, and the Phantom
hopes that he'll be back soon with another film, though he believes that next
time he and his crew should take a lunch together and decide just exactly what
kind of film they want to make *before* they start shooting.  "A little bit of
everything that was successful over the past 5 years" just doesn't cut it.</P>
<P>     So the Phantom is undecided: should he recommend that his phans see THE
FIRST POWER now, or wait until it hits Blockbusters?  For all its problems, THE
FIRST POWER is still fun to watch, and it's rarely boring.  But is it worth
$7.50?  Let the Phantom put it this way: if you liked SHOCKER, you'll like THE
FIRST POWER.  If you were upset that SHOCKER turned out to be so utterly
brainless, it might be best to wait for the $2, two-night special, since THE
FIRST POWER is, unfortunately, very nearly a homage to Wes Craven's botched
masterpiece.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the Phantom will organize a half-film festival, for all the films
he's seen recently that start out so well, but then take a bad turn about
half-way through, and finally end very badly indeed.  Admission will be
half-price, of course, and all the films will start every half hour, so his
phans can get up and walk out when a film's gone half way to hell (if a film's
gone all to hell, you know you've stayed too long).  Not a half bad idea, if
the Phantom does say so himself.</P>
