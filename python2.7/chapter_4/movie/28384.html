<PRE>THE MAN WHO CRIED
-----------------</PRE>
<P>In 1927, a doting father (Oleg Yankovsky, "Mute Witness") seemingly lives 
an idyllic life with his young daughter (Claudia Lander-Duke) in rural Russia.
Convinced by a visitting relative to try his luck in America, he ruefully
leaves the tiny girl with his mother (Hana Maria Pravda).  As their shtetl
is being burned to the ground, Grandmother gives her to escaping strangers, 
along with some gold coins and a photograph of her father.  After a horrific 
journey, she's named Suzie by an English port official (Clifford Barry), 
discovered to have a singing voice, and eventually lands in Paris (grown up,
played by Christina Ricci), but her goal remains America in "The Man Who
Cried."</P>
<P>Written and directed by Sally Potter ("Orlando, "The Tango Lesson), "The
Man Who Cried" is an odd amalgamation of filmmaking - good performances
admist luckluster and over the top, on location filming mixed with obviously
artificial set pieces, and a weirdly titled tale that, while nothing new, 
somehow remains engaging.  It's a survivor story set against a historical
background writ from the movie screen.</P>
<P>Suzie, presumed a Brit, gets a job in a cabaret and meets Lola (Cate 
Blanchett), a fellow Russian out to land a wealthy man.  He arrives in the
person of Dante (John Turturro), an egotistical Italian opera singer in
the stage company of Felix Perlman (Harry Dean Stanton).  Lola gets herself 
and Suzie jobs in its chorus and soon she's keeping company with Dante,
(who's most interested to learn Suzie's secret when he spies her father's
picture).  Suzie gravitates towards Cesar (Johnny Depp), a gypsy of few 
words who rides a white stallion onto the stage every night (much to Dante's 
chagrin).  The gypsy way of life reminds Suzie of her Jewish heritage and 
Cesar presents an alternative to the quest for her father.
But the lines are clearly drawn for these four characters with the onset
of WWII and the Nazi occupation of Paris.  (Their fate is economically summed
up with a crane shot of a vaguely Naziish prop looming over Dante 
and Suzie, faced off on the stage below.)</P>
<P>Potter opens her film with credits rolling over her heroine (Ricci), fighting
for life in a dark ocean (clearly a tank) surrounded by burning debris and
water.  Fire and mist continue as leitmotifs throughout the film, although what 
they symbolize is a mystery (the lack of solid ground afforded Suzie?).
The steam rising from a bowl of soup becomes the most predominant (and oddly
hypnotic) element of a shot.  Visually, "The Man Who Cried" is often stunning,
featuring slow-mo closeups of Suzie, costumed for an ornate outdoor tableau,
or Cesar performing stunts on horseback through the nighttime streets of Paris.
A shot of young Suzie stubbornly clutching the heavily framed portrait of
her father (it's almost as big as she is) while terror reigns around her is
haunting.  (Cinematography is by Sacha Vierny, "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife 
and Her Lover" and "Prospero's Books").</P>
<P>Ricci plays Suzie largely as an impassive observer.  This, combined
with Ricci's otherworldly appearance, makes for an empathetic portrayal of an 
intelligent survivor who's not what she appears to be.  A shy smile for 
Cesar is hard won and takes on more weight.  Blanchett continues to amaze with 
her ability to transform herself.  Peroxide blonde Lola targets Dante like a 
heat-seeking missile and Blanchett does the heavily-accented flirt well.  She 
also brings urgency and regret to her character when she must face 
the inevitable.  Depp recycles his role from "Chocolat" as a man of even lesser
words.  Potter objectifies him, but Depp gets across the simple points - anger
at oppression, love for his family.  Turturro, however, relies on theatrical
posing and grandstanding in a two dimensional performance.  Harry Dean Stanton
is quietly convincing, lending an air of melancholy to his democratic 
businessman.  Young Claudia Lander-Duke looks like Ricci and her stoicism 
meshes well into Ricci's portrayal of the character.</P>
<P>"The Man Who Cried" is an off kilter work from a visual, overtly 
romantic director.  </P>
