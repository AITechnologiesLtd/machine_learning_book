                       A film review by Alan Jay

France/USSR 1991

<P>Capsule:  Set in Mongolia, this film is about love, friendship and a
lost heritage. (+1)</P>
<P>     An Urga is a long pole with a lasso on one end that the Mongolians
use for catching their animals on the steppes.  They also use it as
parting of their mating rituals by catching their wives with it and then
planting it in the ground so that they are not disturbed during their
love making.</P>
<P>     URGA is about a family unit 60 miles from the nearest town who have
already got three children (under Chinese Law they are restricted to
two) and the husband wants another.  Into this situation arrives a
Russian construction worker.</P>
<P>     Within this premise the film show life on the steppe and the
killing and preparing of a sheep for dinner with their guest in graphic
detail.  The husband is sent out to buy condoms and returns to town with
the Russian.</P>
<P>     URGA is a film that slowly and beautifully tells its tale but on
occasions one was wondering if it too long at two hrs for the plot
involved.  There are some wondrous moments and so the film is definitely
worth seeing as a display of the way life was in Mongolia.</P>
