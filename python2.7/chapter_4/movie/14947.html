<PRE>                         A PERFECT MURDER 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                    2 :-) :-) out of 4 for re-dial M</PRE>
<P>Cast: Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, Viggo Mortensen, David Suchet,
Sarita Choudhury
Director: Andrew Davis
Screenplay: Patrick Smith Kelly based on the play "Dial M for Murder" by
Frederick Knott</P>
<P>When it comes to a good ol' murder yarn, one wants to be surprised,
thrilled and kept in suspense throughout. With these elements in place,
one will be swept away with the mystery. There is no perfect murder,
there are only those who get away with the crime and those who aren't so
lucky. In the case of this movie, the crime is almost perfect, with the
one exception of human error.</P>
<P>In a re-make-over of the classic DIAL M, we are represented with that
most horrid scenario of a man wanting to murder his wife. What is made
more poignant this time round, by Gwynetth Paltrow playing the wife,
than in the original role played by Grace Kelly, is that the wife is
having an extra marital affair. Whether this is a sufficient reason to
commit murder, is debatable, but it is made clear in the plot that the
two major roots for murder are money and jealousy.</P>
<P>Keeping this in mind, we are led through one man's (Michael Douglas)
most horrid attempt at ridding himself of his most beautiful, unfaithful
wife. There are new elements added to the original Hitchcock classic,
bringing it up to date with current trend of nineties plot twisting. The
lover (Viggo Mortensen) is one of these elements. This is not necessary
better, but does give a different perspective to those who have already
seen the many reruns of the original. Those who haven't seen the
Hitchcock classic, are the ones who will most likely appreciate this
almost perfect mystery.</P>
<P>Michael Douglas is ideal as the cold, manipulative husband, and all his
WALL STREET colours shine through brilliantly in this role. Gwyneth
Paltrow is as usual charming and beautiful as the wealthy, unfaithful
wife. Not classical material, but more a valiant attempt at trying to
recreate the magic of DIAL M.</P>
