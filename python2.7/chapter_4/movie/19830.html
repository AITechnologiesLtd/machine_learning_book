<P>It depends on your basis of judgment whether or not you will enjoy
Arlington Road, a suspenseful but convoluted Hitchockian yarn about
neighborly suspicion. Critics and audiences tend to react different to
this sort of movie, but if you are able to grasp the basic premise with
depth and believability, you should enjoy yourself.</P>
<P>Arlington Road was first set for release in mid-January ‘99, when it was
re-scheduled for a May 14 opening. But, after the violent and tragic
high school shooting in Colorado, the movie was postponed yet again to
avoid conflict that could result from it's terrorist-associated
plotline. All the more so because Arlington Road deals with violence
that takes place in a friendly environment that could resemble home for
more than a few people. It seemed nearly impossible for a film with such
a complicated past to break through in the busy season of summer.</P>
<P>The film does have big Hollywood names to combat the typical summer
action fare. Jeff Bridges, looking rather frigid and tense, plays
Michael Faraday, a university professor who teaches a class in U.S.
terrorism. He has a nine-year old child he's raised since the passing of
his wife, an F.B.I. agent who was killed in the line of duty. In a tense
prologue, Faraday comes upon a boy on the street, injured and bleeding
as he hobbles along helplessly. After driving him to the hospital,
Faraday meets the boy's parents, the humble and reserved Oliver Lang
(Tim Robbins) and his eccentric but caring wife (Joan Cusack). It turns
out the Lang's live just across the street from Michael, and the two
families strike a bond.</P>
<P>But perhaps there is more to Mr. Lang than the friendly, overly-generous
facade that he puts on. Faraday, a man so paranoid he could put Agent
Mulder to shame, suspects something more of his neighbor. He starts
digging, digs some more, and then can't stop extracting clues from
Lang's mysterious past. After discovering a name-change and scanning
through the suspect's local paper, he comes upon the conclusion that
Oliver Lang is a sophisticated terrorist bomber. His current girlfriend
(Hope Davis) thinks he's a loon, but while his son plays with the Lang's
10-year old boy who enjoys lighting firecrackers, Faraday becomes more
overwrought with fear that something is not right.</P>
<P>To watch Arlington Road is to appreciate good acting. Bridges is
terrific; a bit too extraneous, but terrific. And while Robbins and
Cusack are both appropriately creepy,  I wanted so much more from their
characters, more exploration resulting in greater discovery. The latter,
in particular, is left fairly one-note. And Tim Robbins has such great
abilities, his character could have been stretched far beyond the limits
it's taken. Still, there's a certain chill that runs down your back when
he tells Bridges, `I didn't know you taught a course in terrorism.
That's a pretty frightening subject.' But good for a living too, I
suppose.</P>
<P>Most viewers will be biting their nails to the nubs as Arlington Road
nears the climax, but the suspense could have been greater. The script,
which starts out too dreary and slow, contains so many convoluted plot
details that a sense of unease sets in. Luckily, the action picks up and
the suspense goes into overdrive during the final twenty minutes,
leaving room for a very surprising and deviously clever finale. Some may
find it unnecessary, but I actually found more to like in it than I did
with the twisted 2 hours that preceded it. If Arlington Road had
maintained a steady intellectual pace to support this climax, than
perhaps there would have been more to relish in this entertaining but
passable summer popcorn movie.</P>
<P>Footnote: A good invitation for a neighborhood barbecue hosted by
Robbins' character would read: `BYOB: Bring Your Own Bomb'. Ha, ha.</P>
