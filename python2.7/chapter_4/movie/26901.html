<PRE>102 DALMATIANS
--------------</PRE>
<P>As the 2nd Chance animal shelter struggles to stay afloat and the now
grown up Dipstick is about to become a father of three, Cruella De Vil
(Glenn Close), cured of her fur loving ways by behaviorist Dr. Pavlov, is 
released from prison.  Dipstick's owner Chloe (Alice Evans, "Le Dernier
Secret") is dismayed to learn that she's Cruella's parole officer, but
De Vil, begging to be called 'Ella,' becomes an animal rights crusader,
injecting time and cash into 2nd Chance.  But Dr. Pavlov discovers that
his therapy is easily undone and soon De Vil is secretly teaming up with
designer Le Pelt (Gerard Depardieu) to create her dreamed of spotted coat
in Walt Disney Pictures' "102 Dalmatians."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>De Vil is picked up at the prison gates by her faithful servant Alonso
(Tim McInnerny, "101 Dalmatians"), who presents her with a gift - Fluffy,
a Chinese crested dog.  She then orders him to rid her manse of her
furs, which get boarded up in a dungeon like room, along with her drawn
design of her spotted coat.  The tolling of Big Ben snaps her out of
her charitable ways, however, and soon she's revised her design to include
a hood, requiring one more puppy than the original pattern.  (Her
transformation puts her into a delusional state where the entire city
of London bears Dalmatian spots, a fun effect.)</P>
<P>She begins secretly stealing puppies to be shipped to France and manages
to frame Kevin (Ioan Gruffudd, "Titanic"), 2nd Chance's owner and Chloe's
budding love interest, for the crimes.</P>
<P>Once again Close proves herself a trooper as the outrageous De Vil.  She's
a hoot.  Evans is a bit too squeaky clean as Chloe, but Gruffudd is 
charming as the boyish Kevin.  McInnerny is sympathetic as Alonso, De Vil's
unwitting accomplice.  However, Depardieu is utterly wrong for this film
and his character and wardrobe should have been either completely revamped
or banished.  His French pronunciation of puppies as 'poopies' is supposed
to pass for high humor.</P>
<P>The animals are terrific and given an injection of new blood by Fluffy
and the inhabitants of 2nd Chance, which includes Waddlesworth, a Macaw
who thinks he's a dog.  Chloe's three puppies include Oddball, a pure
white pup traumatized by its lack of spots, who's always getting into
trouble.</P>
<P>The screenplay by Kristen Buckley, Brian Regan, Bob Tzudiker and Noni White
echoes Disney trademarks, such as reinventing the twilight bark in a puppy
version and contrasting the spaghetti and meatball scene from "Lady and the
Tramp" with Chloe and Kevin's first date.  "The Wizard of Oz" even comes
to mind as Cruella locks Chloe up in her dungeon match as the witch cages
Dorothy (and her little dog, too).  They've also cooked up a nice parallel 
with Oddball's spot issue and Waddlesworth's inability to fly.  Dialogue 
includes some pithy lines for Cruella ('The last time I underestimated a 
puppy, I ended up in the pokie.')  However, besides the Le Pelt problem, the 
climatic ending is far too reminiscent of this past summer's "Chicken Run."</P>
<P>Oscar winning costumer designer Anthony Powell returns (as does most of the
behind the scenes crew) and does some brilliant work for Cruella.  Her
black and white prison garb is hilarious and he cleverly presents her in
a Chanel suit - in a houndstooth pattern!  Powell even makes her resemble
a nun.  The black and white mane is smoothly coifed until the evil in De Vil
returns.  His work for Le Pelt, however, is another story.  Depardieu
is presented in what looks like a strong man's outfit made of fur sporting
a truly ridiculous hairstyle.</P>
<P>Animation director Kevin Lima (Disney's "Tarzan") confidently handles his
first live action film.  While it has problems, it's paced well enough that
we don't dwell on them.  "102 Dalmatians" will be fun for the kids while 
keeping the adults entertained as well.</P>
