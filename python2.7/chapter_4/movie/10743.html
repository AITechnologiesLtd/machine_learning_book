                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     LEA, a GOLDEN GLOBE nominee for best foreign film, tells the
lugubrious story of a woman so traumatized by an abusive childhood that
she remains almost mute for the rest of her life.  Existing more in a
metaphorical world than a real one, the bulk of the storyline serves as
a conceit to prepare the viewer for the film's incredible conclusion.</P>
<P>     As the story opens, Petr Hapka's overly dramatic music soon has
trumpets blaring, drums banging and flutes wailing.  A young Slovenian
girl named Lea and her mother suffer abuse from Lea's cruel father.
After a short series of dramatic incidents, the story jumps fourteen
years later to 1991.</P>
<P>     As the sullen Lea, Lenka Vlasakova gives a meticulous and delicate
performance.  With a better story than that by first-time writer and
director Ivan Fila, Vlasakova's work might have been moving as well.
But the story rings so false at every turn that there is rarely
sufficient motivation for the audience to delve into the inaccessible
picture's oblique characters.</P>
<P>     Lea, now living with her adoptive parents, keeps an underground
shrine filled with hundreds of glowing candles as a homage to her dead
mother.  A mysterious German named Strehlow shows up in their remote
Slovenian village and offers to purchase Lea so that she can come back
to Germany with him and be his bride.  Through some financial
maneuverings, Strehlow turns the offer into a non-negotiable demand.
Once he has her back in Germany, he abuses her in some of the same ways
that her father used to.</P>
<P>     As the quintessentially cold and inhumane villain Strehlow, who
obviously has a heart of gold hidden somewhere in his chest, Christian
Redl gives a dramatic reading of his inexplicable character.  Where
Strehlow's anger and bitterness comes from is but one of the convoluted
show's many conundrums.</P>
<P>     The tale, which is as bleak and morose as the frozen landscape
surrounding the derelict farm Strehlow calls home, manages to neatly
tie up most of the story's mysteries before its hard-to-believe ending.
Although the filmmaker clearly wants to illustrate utter despair and
the hope for redemption, the movie plays too much as an exercise in
cinematic style to draw one into the story.</P>
<P>     LEA runs 1:40.  The film's sparse dialog is in German and
Slovenian with English subtitles.  The movie is not rated but would be
an R for violence.</P>
