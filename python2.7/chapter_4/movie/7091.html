                       A film review by John Schuurman
                        Copyright 1997 John Schuurman</PRE>
<P>Directed by Jerry Zaks
Screenplay by Scott Mcpherson, based on his play.</P>
<P>Why is this film called 'MARVIN'S ROOM'? At first glance it doesn't
make much sense. Marvin, (Hume Cronyn) just lies there. He is an
entirely dependent, way old, completely non-verbal, pathetically
incontinent bed-case. He is of no obvious use to himself and is a great
burden to others. In short, conventional wisdom says that the guy is a
perfect candidate for a brief visit with Jack Kervorkian. </P>
<P>And yet the movie is named after him! Or more specifically his room.
This is -- MARVIN'S ROOM. But if Marvin is a nothing as a person, his
room is really a big zero. There is nothing unique or specific about it
at all. It is just a simple barren room with a hospital bed and the
hapless Marvin lying in it. In the stage play by the same title, you
don't even see inside the room or get to actually have a look at
Marvin. You only hear his moans and see his silhouette through the
glass block wall. </P>
<P>So why "Marvin's Room"? Instead of Marvin or his room the action seems
to center on his two grown daughters, Bessie (Diane Keaton) and Lee,
(Meryl Streep), and their fractured relationship. The two have had
little to do with each other for the last twenty years. It seems there
was a big disagreement and they went their separate ways. Lee, not
wanting to "waste her life,"  went off to experience various adventures
of romance and self-improvement (all of which fail). And Bessie stayed
at home tending the ailing Marvin whom she says "has been dying for
twenty years -- slowly, so that I won't miss anything."  </P>
<P>It seems that everybody has been wasting their life with depressing
regularity here. </P>
<P>But now, Lee has come home with her two sons. She has come because
Bessie has been diagnosed with Leukemia and there is a possibility that
either Lee or one of the boys might be a good match for a bone marrow
transplant. So it is understandable if we should conclude  that the
movie's theme concerns Lee and Bessie and their relationship made fresh
through the quest for a donor. But this is MARVIN'S ROOM. </P>
<P>Another issue that captures a lot of our attention is the situation of
Lee's eldest son Hank (Leonardo DiCaprio). He has "always been a
problem" for Lee and when we first meet him he is in the act of burning
her house down. Throughout the movie we watch this troubled lad come to
a measure of insight about himself and his mother and so here might be
a fruitful center for the movie. But, again,  this is MARVIN'S ROOM</P>
<P>What makes it MARVIN'S ROOM? Let me ask it this way: What makes for a
life of worth? And what makes for a life that is wasted? Those are the
root questions of MARVIN'S ROOM. </P>
<P>In the room lies the pathetic Marvin in a situation that all people
dread. We pray, "Please God, take me before I get like that." And,
"Lord, I don't think I could cope with someone like that." </P>
<P>What lies in the room gives us the shudders. And then question comes:
Is it worth anything? Would it be a waste to invest a life in caring
for this? </P>
<P>I delight to tell you that the movie's answer is clear and unequivocal.
In Marvin's room, lies the person Marvin --  someone who, though
capable of producing only body fluids and guttural noise -- is
eminently capable of BEING loved. The issue is not that he is able to
love in return. That is specifically rejected as any sort of a motive.
No, Bessie says, "I've been so lucky to have been able to love someone
so much." </P>
<P>What makes for a life of worth? This film says that Bessie has such a
life. She has loved a love that expected nothing and received much. It
is enough. </P>
<P>For an early hint at the driving theme of the film, check out the
opening credits. While the names role we see medicine bottles, hundreds
of them, along with syringes, thermometers, water bottles, and hand
wipes  all lovingly arranged and bathed in a soft and nostalgic golden
light. It is as if the the camera were panning Christmas tree ornaments
in the most sentimental of possible treatments. But there is no
sentimentalism in this movie, it is rather a combination of brute
realism and some of the great folk that enoble the rest of us. </P>
<P>Go see this truly wonderful film about the greatness of those who love
sacrificially. It will help you look afresh at who life's real heros
are.</P>
