Running time: 98 minutes.</P>
<P>Writer/director Wes Anderson is an audacious talent who possesses 
an unconventional and off 
beat sensibility.  Rushmore is the second film from Anderson, whose low 
budget, slacker crime caper 
Bottle Rocket was widely acclaimed but performed poorly at the box 
office.  In Rushmore he suffuses the 
typical elements of the dysfunctional teen genre, the coming of age tale, 
and adolescent school comedy 
with a subversive, wickedly anarchic spirit.  The result is a 
refreshingly offbeat and inventive comedy that 
at times becomes a little too clever for its own good.  Rushmore has an 
edgy, surreal quality that sets it 
apart from the puerile humour of most similarly themed comedies.  The 
film's deliberately eccentric style 
will probably hold more appeal to adult audiences.  </P>
<P>Fifteen year old Max Fischer (newcomer Jason Schwartzman) is a 
precocious student at 
Rushmore, a ritzy private school.  Although quite brilliant - he can 
solve complex mathematical equations 
quicker than that other prodigy Will Hunting - Max is also something of 
an obsessive under-achiever.  His 
grades have slipped because of his passion for pursuing extra curricular 
activities.  Max is the president 
and founding member of a number of clubs at Rushmore - bee keeping, 
fencing, chess.  He even formed 
the theatrical group that performs his offbeat plays, including a stage 
adaptation of Serpico and an 
ambitious Apocalypse Now-like scenario.  He is put on "sudden death 
academic probation," which simply 
means that if he fails one more exam he's out.  </P>
<P>Max is sort of like Ferris Bueller's evil brother - a devious, 
shrewd and manipulative schemer, but 
without the charm.  He is a thoroughly despicable character, and is never 
in danger of eliciting sympathy 
from the audience.  At times you want to strangle him, or shake him.  </P>
<P>Max's downfall begins when he falls heavily for Miss Cross 
(Olivia Williams, from The 
Postman), the junior grade teacher.  In an effort to impress her he 
attempts to build an aquarium on the 
edge of one of the school's sporting fields.  He approaches wealthy 
businessman and former alumni Mr 
Blume (Bill Murray) to fund the project.  The plan backfires, and Max is 
temporarily expelled from 
Rushmore.  Blume begins an affair with Miss Cross.  The jealous Max begin 
a vicious campaign of 
vengeance against Blume, which escalates out of control.  It is the 
unlikely relationship between these two 
eccentric characters that provides the film with much of its energy and 
humour.          The wealth of 
colourful incidents and wonderfully quirky characters suggests that 
Rushmore has been partially inspired 
by Anderson's own experiences at school.  Rushmore has a sophisticated 
and decidedly off beat sense of 
humour, although the laughs are not always obvious.  </P>
<P>The performers seem attuned to Anderson's off beat sense of 
humour.  In an impressive debut, 
Schwartzman delivers a strong performance as the thoroughly dislikeable 
Max.  Murray is at his 
smarmy, droll and laconic best, and delivers a wonderfully understated 
performance as the emotionally 
damaged Blume, who is little more than an overgrown child in a man's 
body.  </P>
<P>Anderson has an idiosyncratic visual style, which ensures that 
Rushmore is quite unlike any 
other coming of age tale that you've seen.  The quirkiness and 
originality of the scenario unfortunately 
doesn't last the distance however, as Anderson eventually settles for a 
rather conventional and somewhat 
unsatisfying resolution.</P>
