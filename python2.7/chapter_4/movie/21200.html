<P>On one side of the fight ring, we have a motion picture that is a visual 
masterpiece, one that knows exactly what it wants to do, and how it wants to 
look. As a study in style and camera artistry, it is as impressive and 
dizzyingly original as any other film of 1999. On the other side of the fight 
ring, we have a motion picture that runs out of worthwhile material at the 
one-hour mark, becoming repetitive, repugnant, and dull. Its message, about 
living your life the way you want to before the tedious nature of life takes 
over your soul, is severely muddled amid the grisly onslaught of violence, 
and was not only covered far more effectively in "American Beauty," but 
treated its characters with respect, rather than as a joke. Worse yet, the 
final thirty minutes brings a twist that is unpredictable, to be sure, but 
also genuine rubbish. Director David Fincher (whose 1995 psychological 
thriller, "Se7en," is his only successful venture, to date) clearly gets a 
lot of pleasure out of jerking his audiences around, and has come up with a 
sharp plot turn that is as superficial and plainly silly as probably anything 
I've seen since Fincher's very own, "The Game," in 1997. The more you stop to 
think about it, in fact, the less it makes sense, and not at all in the 
playful way David Lynch's best films delight, such as 1986's "Blue Velvet" 
and 1997's "Lost Highway."</P>
<P>Edward Norton stars as a bored office worker with no name, other than the 
Narrator. An insomniac who lives by himself in an apartment filled to 
bursting with consumer furniture and appliances, he starts to spend his 
evenings going to self-help groups for everything from testicular cancer to 
tuberculosis because he finds becoming a person other than himself each night 
adds comfort to his life. As he attends them more and more, he discovers that 
someone else has been doing the same thing as him. Her name is Marla Singer 
(Helena Bonham Carter), a darkly-dressed, hilariously extreme chain-smoker, 
and after he confronts her about it, they decide to work out a schedule so 
that they don't go to the same meetings. On a plane back home after a 
business trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), an "oh-so-cool," 
confident, possibly dangerous, thirtysomething who isn't afraid of anything 
or anyone. When his apartment ends up being destroyed in a fire, the Narrator 
shacks up with Tyler at his grimy pad, and they immediately form a sort of 
secret organization called Fight Club, in which a group of men meet each 
night and beat each other to a bloody pulp, in response to the 
dissatisfaction of their pathetic, working-class lives. The club surprisingly 
grows larger and larger with each night, until the Narrator suspects it may 
be getting out of control after Tyler throws acid on his hand one night and 
forces him to keep it there until it has burnt right through his skin. 
Meanwhile, Tyler and Marla have met up and begun a strictly sexual 
relationship.</P>
<P>"Fight Club" is a convoluted, blackly-comic thriller that director Fincher 
has said takes an anti-violence stance, despite its nearly non-stop barrage 
of fights, guns, and blood, and so my question to him is: "What exactly is 
anti-volent about it?" As far as this film's characters are concerned, 
fighting is an especially enjoyable way to spend an evening, and despite a 
few human casualties throughout, Fincher takes no stance on the subject of 
violence, nor does he responsibly handle it. Norton's character goes through 
few changes throughout, aside from becoming more liberated, and is never 
attempted to be developed as an actual person who might actually live on 
Earth, nor is any effort made to make him the least bit likable or 
sympathetic. Since Fincher wastes his chances to give Norton a character arc, 
or to make some sort of point on violence (unlike Oliver Stone's profound 
1994 satire, "Natural Born Killers"), the only recognizable meaning to get 
out of the film is, like I've already mentioned, almost identical to that of 
"American Beauty," minus the underlying themes and three-dimensional 
characters. </P>
<P>The first hour is spectacularly fascinating, as it draws you into the 
Narrator, his petty life, the self-help groups he meets with, Marla, and the 
early appearances of Tyler Durden. I questioned exactly where everything was 
going because, thus far, the film had intrigued and pulled me in like very 
few film do. That's when the Fight Club starts, and where the picture loses 
its footing and plausability. Merely the idea of an underground club that 
gets its kicks out of hurting others and getting hurt is difficult to 
swallow, because the way that the masochistic group grows so quickly is 
ludicrous. Are there really people in the world who would indulge in a Fight 
Club? Yes, probably so. But it's foolish to believe that so many men would be 
pulled into it so quickly, and actually like doing it. Sorry, I just don't 
buy it.</P>
<P>In a role that requires massive frenticism and energy, Edward Norton is more 
than acceptable to bring the Narrator's personality to life, but has very 
little to do on a character level. Brad Pitt, in his most assured performance 
since 1995's "12 Monkeys," nonetheless remains an enigma, and although this 
is appropriate under the cirmcumstances, I question the reasons for his 
attraction to the thin role. If anyone escapes relatively unscathed, it is 
Helena Bonham Carter, in one of the most memorable supporting performances of 
the year. Her portrayal of Marla is one-of-a-kind, and very few people could 
have pulled it off with such fearless bravado and genuine comic sensibilites. 
In supporting turns, Meat Loaf Aday, as Bob, a man struck with testicular 
cancer whose estrogen level has gone up, forcing him to grow breasts, is 
treated as nothing but a joke, rather than a real person. This is 
unfortunate, considering that Aday gives an otherwise moving performance. The 
big mystery in the actor department is Jared Leto, who is so wasted as one of 
Fight Club's members, I suspect his part was criminally edited down to what 
is now more or a less a cameo.</P>
<P>By the film's last half-hour, I had simply stopped caring. The twist is 
admittedly surprising, but also preposterous. Director Fincher and 
screenwriter Jim-Uhls may believe that they have made something clever and 
slick, a film for the late-'90s generation, but it comes off purely as a 
gimmick, and a frustrating one at that. The final image of "Fight Club" is 
unforgettable and oddly beautiful, but only in the context of the scene 
itself, rather than the film as a whole. And there lies the problem with the 
movie--taking every scene on an individual basis, it is often madly 
brilliant, but put it all together, and it is a pretentious, incoherent mess.</P>
