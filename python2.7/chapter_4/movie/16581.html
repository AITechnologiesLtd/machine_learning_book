<P> Reviewed by Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Universal Pictures
 Director:  Joe Johnston
 Writer:  Lewis Colick, on Homer Hickam Jr.'s novel, "Rocket Boys"
 Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, Laura Dern, Natalie
Canerday, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, Chad Lindberg</P>
<P>    Joe Johnston made a name for his special effects
work in razzle-dazzle movies like "Raiders of the Lost Ark"
and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."  He continued
his forte by directing the fanciful "Honey I Shrunk the Kids." 
You can scarcely believe that this same person is at the helm
of "October Sky," which has as conventional a structure as
you can find in any film, enough so that it could easily be
featured on prime-time TV.  Yet this standard "based-on-a-
true-story" tale works.  "October Sky" has stature as an
inspirational drama because it appears to replicate with
integrity a true story about a kid who later became a NASA
scientist, a position he holds to this day.  At the same time it
shuns the cheap sentiment of the soaps while avoiding the
obligatory hipness that makes so many Sundance entries
seem cut from the same cloth.  This is the sort of film that
may be bypassed by the high-school set intent on seeing yet
another video game on the big screen.  More's the pity,
because "October Sky," based on Homer H. Hickam Jr.'s
novel "Rocket Boys" and successfully adapted to the screen
by Lewis Colick, could inspire a whole generation of young
people who have no substantial heroes of their own.  Proving
that you've got to be a rocket scientist to get along with all
the pretty girls.</P>
<P>   Director Johnston takes us back to 1957, the year that
Sputnik caused alarm throughout the U.S. and fostered a new
interest, however fleeting, in the study of sciences throughout
the land.  As folks look up to the starry sky near the film's
opening and actually see the Soviet accomplishment, they
give vent to their feelings, usually expressed in cliches such
as "we have enough problems right here on the Earth."</P>
<P>   "October Sky," though, presents a sympathetic view of
people often considered hillbillies and hicks by those living in
more sophisticated areas than Coaltown, West Virginia, a
town which was formed, named and wholly owned by the
company running the mines.  The boys address their fathers
as "sir," the town appears to have only one drunk, and the
kids in school are polite except to the one boy, Quentin
(Chris Owen), whom they prochronistically label a geek. 
When Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes an uncommon
interest in the space travel introduced by the Russian ship,
he begins a letter-writing campaign to Werner von Braun,
then stationed in Cape Canaveral and, together with his pals
Roy Lee (William Lee Scott), Quentin, and O'Dell (Chad
Lindberg), gets to work on building a model rocket.  Through
trial and error, the quartet fail consistently (in their first
attempt they blow a hole in the Hickam family wooden fence)
until they discover the best fuel and the appropriate shape to
make the rocket's nozzle.</P>
<P>   The real story, however, takes place within Homer's family,
as his dad, John Hickam (Chris Cooper), looks at best with
indifference at his son's hobby.  John, who has worked his
way up in the mines to become the superintendent, has
hopes that Homer would follow in his footsteps and eventually
rise to become a supervisor himself, but in doing so John
comes into conflict with Homer's supportive teacher, Miss
Riley (Laura Dern), who is hostile to the mining profession
and wants her pupils literally to rise above the quarry.</P>
<P>   "October Sky" affords a powerful boost in stature for
science and math, the two subjects that are avoided by so
many kids today because they are considered either difficult
to irrelevant.  Just watch how the hero is able to discover the
exact spot in which one of his lost rockets landed by using
trigonometry! One has to look today to the specialty high
schools such as Bronx Science and Stuyvesant and Hunter
High in New York City to find lads as motivated to succeed in
a demanding pursuit as these four.  Kids today, more than
ever before, are being raised in single-parent homes and in
households that provide them with little or no sustenance
beyond the advice to "get out there and make a lot of
money."  Learning for its own sake has long taken a back
seat to the notion of work as simply a means to an affluent
end, which makes "October Sky" all the more heartening.  </P>
<P>   Director Johnston works with a cast that could not better
represent the genuine people from a poor, backwoods who
caused such a stir by their ambition and perseverance.  Chris
Cooper is altogether believable in the role of Homer's dad,
alternately disapproving and sanctioning his son's aspiration,
while Jake Gyllenhaal--accustomed to playing the son in
movies like "City Slickers" and the TV episode "Bop Gun"
from the series "Homicide: Life on the Streets"--is
spellbinding.  His is the glow that comes from a person when
he is reaching for the sky and determined to elude anyone
and anything in his way. Lewis Colick's dialogue is as square
as the majority of Coaltown's people, though he occasionally
tosses in some terms that were not likely used in 1957 such
as "geek," "it's cool," and "if your father was alive he'd kick
your ass."  </P>
<P>   When football captains take a back seat to rocket
scientists, the audience will have to settle for the suspense of
an awards ceremonies of an Indianapolis science fair, which
substitutes for the winning touchdown in the final two seconds
of a game.  Brains are paramount, Braun provides the
inspiration.  If you're amenable to this, "October Sky" should
furnish you the appropriate uplift. </P>
<PRE>Rated PG.  Running Time: 100 minutes.  (C) 1999
