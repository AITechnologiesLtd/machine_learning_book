                       A film review by Shane R. Burridge

<P>After being snapped up by Disney for the role of Pollyanna in her
second film, Hayley Mills returned to the girl-meets-convict theme of
her debut, TIGER BAY.  Twist is that she and her younger brother and
sister believe the mysterious arrival of a stranger (Alan Bates) in
their barn to be nothing less than the Second Coming.  Their active,
young imaginations, coupled with the rural isolation of the Northern
Country serve to make such a fanciful idea believably down-to-earth.
Hayley and her siblings (Diane Holgate and Alan Barnes, who give
effortless, "real" performances), who know little about Christ,
ironically develop faith and a sense of responsibility as soon as they
'meet' him.</P>
<P>Film speaks volumes about the way children rearrange facts to fit in
with their own interpretation of the world.  Their straightforward
reasoning has no time for awkward questions (e.g., they bring 'Christ'
bread and wine because "that's what he eats").  But who can blame their
approach when their token religious instruction is just as vague?  When
one of the children worries about his kitten, his Sunday school teacher
unhelpfully remarks that 'Jesus will look after it';  when Mills tries
to get a straight answer about Christ from the local priest he uses it
as an excuse to complain about vandalism.  Appropriately, the convict
(he has a name, as published by the police, but is referred to only as
"The Man" in the closing credits) responds to the children with equal
simplicity.  He rarely speaks a sentence more than a few words long.
Bates remains reticent throughout the story - we can never be sure of
his intentions.  He neither 'reforms' from contact with the children,
nor betrays them to use them as some kind of leverage when things start
looking bad.</P>
<P>Although the children find 'Jesus' in a barn, and then skip away to the
accompaniment of a Christmas carol, we are otherwise spared any coy
allegorical commentary.  Film is charming, not pretentious.  It is so
gentle that even a slap across the face stands out as a violent
moment.  Mills and the other children will completely win you over -
you'll remember the touching final moment.  Bryan Forbes directed from
a story by Mary Hayley Bell (Hayley's mother).  Composer Malcolm Arnold
arranged the cheerful score.  Title refers to a hawking expression,
more commonly known in its figurative sense of abandoning a person or
thing.</P>
