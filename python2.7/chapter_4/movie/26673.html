<P>Somebody do me a favor: find Nora Ephron and take her Director's Guild
card away.  And don't forget her Screenwriter's union card; she might
just sneak past an unsuspecting audience again.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Russ Richards (John Travolta), a doofus weatherman at WTPA in Harrisburg
Pennsylvania, is in trouble.  Sure, he has a Jaguar that he parks at his
reserved spot at Denny's "restaurant", and sure, he has a snowmobile
dealership; but when Harrisburg goes through - what, days? - of the
warmest winter on the books and his dealership slowly goes under, Russ
finds himself in need of a quick influx of income.  WTPA station manager
Dick Simmons (Ed O'Neill) won't front Russ the money, so Russ goes to
his friend Gig (Tim Roth) to ask for help.</P>
<P>Gig's first idea, involving a "business associate" by the name of Dale
The Thug (Michael Rapaport), was foiled by Russ' unwitting snowmobile
salesman Larry (Michael Weston); so they come up with Plan B: with the
help of Russ' Lotto Girl girlfriend Crystal Latroy (Lisa Kudrow) and her
wheezing cousin Walter (Michael Moore), they plan to somehow rig the
state lottery so they can win it.  And - you knew this was coming,
dincha? - Wackiness Ensues.</P>
<P>[Man, I'm surprised I made it through that description before my fingers
fell asleep.]</P>
<P>The Upshot:
John Travolta couldn't leave well enough alone when he stunk up the
joint with his ego-driven BATTLEFIELD EARTH wreck, I see.  That wasn't
punishment enough for his dwindling audience; he had to follow it up
with this sad excuse for a comedy.  One thing, though: he forgot to make
it funny.  I haven't groaned so much at a flick since the reel for
SUPERNOVA started up.</P>
<P>There's so much Stink to go around here, it's hard to know where to
start.  The acting - what little there was of it - was painfully
executed; the writing was done in pale crayon, with no hint of feasible
plot development whatsoever; and director Ephron just needs her butt
whupped and her access to the camera taken away permanently.  This was
the most over-written, under-funny, blindly directed, so-called "comedy"
I think I've ever seen.  It wasn't Dark.  It wasn't Broad.  It was just
D-U-L-L.</P>
<P>It'll be hard for me to choose between this one and Stupornova when the
time comes for Worst Of 2000.  No, let me not tell that lie; SUPERNOVA
still wins by a nose.  But LUCKY NUMBERS came close enough to make me
skulk, growling, from the theater.  Besides the overall stench, the two
movies had something else in common: a lack of opening credits.  And who
could blame them? I know I wouldn't want to take "credit" for either one!</P>
<P>The only good thing to come out of LUCKY NUMBERS was Michael Rapaport,
one of the most underrated White Dudes in the business.  Too bad Dale
didn't take a swing at Ephron with that bat of his.  Mr. Rapaport, you
certainly deserve better.  And Mr. Travolta, after threatening us with
"Battlefield Earth 2: The Ego Returns", you deserve *exactly* what's
coming to you.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
When Darryl Mitchell appeared on-screen as lazy cop Pat Lakewood's
partner, Officer Chambers [as if we needed to see yet more good actors
wasted on this drivel!], I was sure that there'd be lots of Wacky Black
Stuff to come; gotta admit, I was pleasantly surprised to see that
Mitchell was the straight man to poor Bill Pullman's Idiot.  Thank god
for small favors.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
Between John Travolta's wack acting and his wackier haircut, he looks
and acts like a morph of Jerry Lewis and Moe Howard.  He really needs to
stop it.  Now.  And somebody should stop director Nora Ephron before she
Kills again.</P>
<P>LUCKY NUMBERS (rating: redlight):
Unlucky me, I wasted 108 minutes of my life watching this mess.</P>
