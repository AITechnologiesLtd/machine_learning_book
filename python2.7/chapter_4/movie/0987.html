<PRE>                              MORTAL THOUGHTS
                       A film review by Wayne Citrin
                        Copyright 1991 Wayne Citrin</PRE>
<P>Micro-summary: Alan Rudolph does a murder mystery.</P>
<P>Summary:  A young woman (Demi Moore) gets inadvertently involved in
          a murder committed by her best friend (Glenne Headley).
          The facts come out at the police interrogation.</P>
<P>     I'll just start by saying that Alan Rudolph is one of my favorite
filmmakers, and that he's done some of my favorite films (THE MODERNS,
and TROUBLE IN MIND).  He always tries something unusual, and it's
usually interesting.  When the film started, though, I was surprised.
Where was the surreal or hyperreal story line and physical setting?
Where is Rudolph's production company (Geraldine Chaplin, Keith
Carradine, Genevieve Bujold)?  Something unusual was going on.</P>
<P>     As I learned later, this isn't entirely an Alan Rudolph film.
Rudolph joined the production a week into the shooting, when the
producers (Demi Moore and Taylor Hackford) fired the original director
and brought in Rudolph.  Rudolph was able to bring long-time
collaborator Mark Isham to do the music, but he had no hand in the
story.  Still, he was able to put his stamp on the film.</P>
<P>     Cynthia Kellogg (Demi Moore) and Joyce Urbansky (Glenne Headley)
are best friends.  Cynthia also works in Joyce's beauty parlor.  Joyce
is married to James, a dangerous and violent lout (played by Bruce
Willis, Moore's real-life husband).  Joyce keeps talking about killing
James, and, well, one day it happens.  Cynthia is there, and she ends
up helping her friend conceal the evidence and gets involved more and
more deeply.  The strain affects both women, and the friendship
unravels.  Cynthia isn't helped by the fact that her own husband isn't
any great shakes (although he's a step above James).</P>
<P>     All of this is revealed as flashbacks during Cynthia's
interrogation.  But the senior detective (Harvey Keitel) has some doubts
about Cynthia's story....</P>
<P>     The film is nicely paced, and the screenplay gives us good reason
to understand why James is killed when it happens.  We understand how
and why a law-abiding friend can be drawn into a crime, and then find it
hard to extricate herself.  The friendship between the two women is
believable.  Their acting is good, as is that of Willis, who makes a
convincing and hateful villain.  The supporting characters particularly
Keitel's detective and Cynthia's husband (John Pankow) are well-drawn
and well-acted.  The ending is good.  (Won't say anything more than
that.)  This is a superior murder mystery.</P>
<P>     Rudolph's contribution lies in the pacing, which is slow enough to
raise the tension, along with appropriate use of slow motion and sound,
vivid colors, and shiny lights reflected in wet nighttime streets.
Isham's music contributes to the atmosphere.  The main problem is that
he's constrained by the realism of the script, which just doesn't allow
many of the strange Rudolph touches (like the alternate reality of 'Rain
City'/Seattle in TROUBLE IN MIND or the modern-art painted backdrops to
many of the scenes in THE MODERNS).  This is definitely Bayonne, NJ in
the late 1980's, and there's nothing Rudolph can do to change that.</P>
<P>     As I said before, this is a superior murder mystery, and it also
shows that Rudolph is capable of handling conventional genre filmmaking
if he has to.  So it's worth seeing in itself.  However, there are any
number of directors who could have made this film.  I'd rather wait for
a film that only Alan Rudolph could make.</P>
