<P>The title `Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo' is undeniably more catchy than
the alternative descriptions offered for a male prostitute in the film
(releasing a film called `Deuce Bigalow: Man Whore' would probably fail
to draw much of an audience). Rob Schneider, a `Saturday Night Live'
veteran who is now renowned among comedy fans for his touching portrayal
of the `you can do it!' guy in `The Waterboy', plays the title
character. Deuce is actually a fish tank cleaner who inherits the role
of being a gigolo when circumstances become extreme. Sit back and I'll
tell you the story....</P>
<P>Antoine Laconte (Oded Fehr, `The Mummy') is a wealthy male prostitute
who requires the services of a aquarium attendant. Enter Deuce. When
Antoine is called away for an extensive business trip in Switzerland,
Deuce is left with the assignment of looking after a sick fish.
Unfortunately, Antoine's entire aquarium system is destroyed, leaving
Deuce with the daunting task of producing $6,000 for a replacement tank
before he returns (insert comedic plot-twist here). Reluctantly, Deuce
becomes a gigolo himself to raise the required amount of money in time.
Surely enough, the clients he attends to all have some kind of
ridiculous characteristic that will ensure their romantic interludes are
fall-down funny. Sorry guys, no dice.</P>
<P>The scatological humor in `Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo' is often mean and
obvious, with the screenplay centering around the prime concern of
taking cheap shots at those with mental and physical disabilities. The
list of targets include the blind, the tall, the overweight, those
afflicted with Tourrets syndrome and those with prosthetic limbs. For
it's majority, `Deuce Bigalow' scrapes the very bottom of the proverbial
comedy bucket in a manner that is both disgusting and thoroughly
careless. And yet, it's sort of funny at times. Eddie Griffin has an
amusing role as a black pimp named T.J. who takes Deuce under his wing,
but too often his character is reduced to low-brow gags such as eating
various food items after they've been dipped in a hot tub. Meanwhile,
William Forsythe overacts with gritted teeth and slicked back hair as a
cop who frequently drops his pants in public to ask Deuce advice about
his manhood. As Kate, a client who Deuce falls head-over-heels for,
Arija Bareikis navigates her way to an admirable performance. Anyone who
could make us believe that Schneider has some charming characteristics
must be doing a fantastic job.</P>
<P>Actually, even with such a heavy burden on his shoulders, Schneider
delivers. He is not a particularly well-rounded comic, and the extra
dimension someone like Adam Sandler might possess is missing, but the
actor nonetheless does a fair job. Speaking of Sandler, this is actually
his producing debut. Rest assured, I'm sure that his company - called,
appropriately enough, `Happy Madison' - won't go bankrupt anytime soon.</P>
<P>`Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo' is essentially a hit-and-miss comedy for
anyone craving endless potty mouth, but it does have it's charm. I know
that's hard to fathom in a breeding ground of perverse and offensive
vulgarity like this, but there are actually traces of it. The film does
have a few inspired gags up it's sleeve, too, particularly a pair of
well-executed nods to `The Matrix' that occur during elaborate battle
sequences. Unfortunately, though, this is just your typical
conglomeration of low-level humor on the whole. Perhaps,  one of these
days, the people of Hollywood will stop to ponder the idea of a decent
script being attached to a project like this. Alas, for every `There's
Something About Mary', there are ten grotesque and unfunny imitations
designed to attract only adolescent males. It has it's moments, but all
in all, `Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo' falls into the latter category.</P>
