Susan Granger's review of "TRIXIE"</PRE>
<P>  With Robert Altman as his mentor/producer, Alan Rudolph is
truly an experimental film-maker and, as with any innovator, he has
some hits ("Choose Me," "Afterglow") and misses ("Breakfast of
Champions," "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"). Unfortunately,
"Trixie" - an attempt at screwball comedy-turned-film noir - is one of
the latter. Oscar nominee for "Breaking the Waves" and "Angela's
Ashes," Emily Watson plays the title role of a quirky, gum-chewing
undercover casino security guard-turned-detective. It's supposed to be
cute that she's confused and mangles metaphors like "I'm a little
green behind the ears," "You can't just sit there like a sore thumb,"
"Take the bull by the tail," "Fish or get off the pot," "I've an ace
up my hole" etc. but this malaprop device soon grows very, very, very
tiresome. Trixie stumbles on a porn racket and a political cover-up
involving a swaggering, corrupt State Senator, played by Nick
Nolte. Supposedly, all of the Senator's garbled, inane dialogue is
culled verbatim from actual political slogans but that doesn't make
the double-talking gibberish easier to listen to. Credit Alan Rudolph
for lining up stellar talent, because Lesley Ann Warren plays a sleazy
aging showgirl who mysteriously disappears with Brittany Murphy as a
sleazy wannabe starlet, while Dermot Mulroney is a womanizing gambler
and Will Patton is a sneering, scheming developer. Nathan Lane is a
boozy lounge comedian who does celebrity impressions and spews lines
like "We're all tap dancers in the canoe of life." On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Trixie" is a tortuous, trivial 3. Don't be
tricked into spending your entertainment dollar for this
self-indulgent garbage.</P>
