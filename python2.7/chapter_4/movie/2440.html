                       A film review by Mark Takacs

<P>One-Line-Summary
----------------
     A woman comes to grips with her life, challenging her lifestyle,
family, friends and child in the process.</P>
<P>Tak Plot Summary
----------------
     Angie's (Geena Davis) dreams and ambitions are different than
those of her friend Tina (Aida Turturro), or her family (James
Gandolfini, Jenny O'Hara).  So it's no surprise that things become
difficult: she breaks with longtime boyfriend Vinnie (Philip Bosco)
after becoming pregnant, and has an affair with Noel (Stephen Rea), a
Manhattan lawyer.  In trying to define herself, she faces her family's
dark secrets, and learns responsibility for herself and her baby.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts 
------------
     I think you have to be a woman to *truly* appreciate ANGIE.
Directed by Martha Coolidge (RAMBLING ROSE), ANGIE touches on many
issues, including pregnancy, childbirth, and searching for her identity
and place within her family structure.  This movie focuses on a woman,
is directed by a woman, and is target at women.  And that's fine--it's
about time.  But, being male, I wasn't as moved.</P>
<P>     There's one scene where Angie reflects on childbirth as having
finally made her feel like a part of something bigger than herself.  A
chain from mother to daughter, stretching back through time and on into
the future.  Yeah.  Okay.  If you say so.  I'd imagine this has a
greater impact if you're female.  The same with the childbirth scenes,
where Angie goes through about five different emotions within the span
of four minutes, and runs down the traditional retorts made so familiar
by female comedians. The material seemed tired to me, but I suppose
it's a never-ending source of material for women, just like being
knee'd in the groin is for men. I imagine women are a bit tired of
that, but it never fails to get at least a little bit of a reaction
from me.  So I guess I'll have to deal with the childbirth shtick.</P>
<P>     Geena Davis has been called "a feminist spirit trapped in the body
of a goddess" (which suggests an inaccurate contradiction) in Feb
Premiere magazine.  As such, her roles are always interesting.  Her
characters are complicated people, and in the case of Angie, are not
above making mistakes.  Which makes for good viewing.  Plus, the accent
she picked up for the role of Angie is outrageously accurate.</P>
<P>     I felt empathy with Vinnie, Angie's longtime boyfriend.  He just
doesn't quite understand why Angie has to be so difficult, or her
strong spark of irreverence and energy.  He's "... got a good heart ...",
but that's not enough for her.  At first I thought James Gandolfini's
Vinnie was going to degenerate into the stereotypical Italian, but it
didn't happen, for which I was profoundly glad.</P>
<P>     I like to listen for comments as people are walking away.  I get
some gems that way--some people would make great critics (actually
some of them are) if they'd expand their one-liners.  The best one from
ANGIE was from two guys as they walked out of the theatre:  "Well ...
there was some good stuff there, but it's certainly not for me." To
which the other guy added his assent.  And I'll add mine, too.</P>
<P>Tak Rating:
-----------
     I didn't get a lot out of ANGIE. I enjoyed watching it, and it
engaged my interest and even my emotions to some extent.  But I can't
see myself watching it at the theatre again.  I would have been happy
to watch ANGIE on cable, and I recommend you do the same.</P>
<PRE>   avoid at all costs            see several times (w/friends) as matinee
   wait for videotape            see once at full price
 M watch it on cable            see it several times - full and/or matinee
 F see once as a matinee    see many times at full price</PRE>
