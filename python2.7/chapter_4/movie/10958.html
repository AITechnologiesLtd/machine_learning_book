<PRE>Wag the Dog</PRE>
<PRE>Dear Caroline --</PRE>
<P>Here's a movie, director Barry Levinson's latest filmed in just 29
days, that takes Ivan Reitman's "Dave" to another extreme.</P>
<P>Co-written by former Chicagoan David Mamet, it's a dark comedy about
how White House aides and spin doctors manipulate the news for the
sake of saving their jobs and their president's image. Presumably, not
in that order.</P>
<PRE>It's Ed Rollins meets Robert Evans.</PRE>
<P>Rollins was Ronald Reagan's bearded campaign manager, a master at
images such as the "Evil Empire," and Evans is the perpetually tanned
producer ("Chinatown") and former Paramount studio boss ("Love Story"
and "The Godfather").</P>
<P>Robert De Niro stars as Conrad Brean, the professorial-looking spin
doctor known as Mr. Fix It, who is brought into the White House for an
emergency when the President is caught in a sexual molestation scandal
involving a Firefly girl less than two weeks before the election.</P>
<P>In a meeting held deep in the White House basement, on a set right out
of Stanley Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove," Brean introduces the
non-existant B-3 Bomber and orders the President to become ill while
in China for a trade mission. The point? Take the focus off the
Firefly girl scandal by getting the media to focus on something else.</P>
<P>Brean, along with presidential aide Winifred Ames (Ann Heche), travels
to L.A. to meet with Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin
Hoffman). Brean needs Motss' help to engineer a fake war with Albania.</P>
<P>The film, based on Larry Beinhart's novel "American Hero," has many
targets to spoof from Grenada to the Persian Gulf War, to yellow
ribbons, "We Are the World," and country singer Lee Greenwood.</P>
<P>Motss brings in his own crew of spin doctors, including songwriter
John Dean (Willie Nelson), the Fad King (Denis Leary) and fashion guru
Liz (Andrea Martin).</P>
<P>In small performances, Kirsten Dunst plays a girl caught in war-torn
Albania and Woody Harrelson is a freaked-out war hero.</P>
<P>It seemed appropriate "Primary Colors" starring John Travolta was
among the trailers, another story about spin doctors manipulating a
presidential election inspired by Joe Klein's (aka Anonymous) novel
based on the Clinton campaign.</P>
<P>"Wag the Dog" features crackerjack dialogue and engaging performances
by De Niro and Hoffman. The film's only troubles occur in the final 30
minutes when the story turns surreal, almost too good to be
true. Maybe that's just the point Levinson was trying to make. That
everything about politics is too good to be true.</P>
<P>It's a fun romp for true cynics about the politic process. I think
even Jefferson Smith would laugh.</P>
<PRE>Rating: Three stars</PRE>
