A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:
Andy Wilson</PRE>
<PRE>Written by:
Mark Haskell Smith</PRE>
<P>Starring: David Duchovny, Timothy Hutton, Angelina Jolie</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
washed-up surgeon, software pirate, beautiful moll, 70s-style action
music, bantering 'Pulp Fiction' goons </P>
<P>Synopsis:
In the opening scene, drug-addicted loser Eugene Sands (David Duchovny)
goes to a bar to score some synthetic heroin, but thugs burst in and
shoot the man next to him. Using a knife, tubing from a beer tap, and a
plastic water bottle, Eugene instinctively drains blood from the
punctured lung of the victim, establishing himself as a gifted former
surgeon. Philosophical insights in the form of voice narration and a
flashback inform us that the talented young Eugene is banned from the
the medical profession due to a stupid mistake: he botched an operation
while under the influence of drugs. During the rest of the movie, Eugene
performs surgery on wounded thugs and meets a series of assorted inept
criminals and bungling FBI agents. Eugene also falls in love with Claire
(Angelina Jolie), the girlfriend of Raymond (Timothy Hutton), a
smalltime software pirate. The end of the movie involves a predictable
car chase between Eugene and Raymond. Will the failed doctor be able to
get his life back on track?</P>
<P>Opinion:
If you are expecting a serious drama, an action extravaganza, or a
suspense flick, 'Playing God' isn't any of these. Try to imagine
Humphrey Bogart as a doctor on the skids making philosophical quips
through voice narration, and you'll get the picture. The Doc's
redemption is the theme, but somehow two-bit software pirates and a
beautiful gangster moll are thrown into the mix, not quite effectively.</P>
<P>The good news is that Angelina Jolie does a fine job as the beautiful
gangster moll. David Duchovny's deadpan wit and boy next door face are
just right for the down and out doctor. Timothy Hutton somehow breathes
needed life into the cardboard character of Raymond the crook. </P>
<P>The bad news is that the film hasn't much sharpness or dramatic punch.
This is a redemption story about a failed doctor, but though much of the
film time is spent painting a fuzzy background subplot concerning the
plans of Russian, Chinese, and American software pirates, these plans
never get clarified. A scene where Sands is supposed to be undergoing
withdrawal symptoms from trying to kick his drug habit looks like he's
simply snoozing in bed with a lot of nearby chocolates. Small potatoes
villains don't seem very dangerous or threatening, and there are no high
stakes involved if anybody wins or loses. The ending is predictable: a
mediocre car chase. </P>
<P>Despite this, if you're in the mood to watch a downed but decent doctor
redeem himself, the movie succeeds on the strength of its message.</P>
