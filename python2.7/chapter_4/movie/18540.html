<P>If you see one sci-fi/action movie with Keanu Reeves this year, I would
highly recommend seeing The Matrix.</P>
<P>I was thoroughly pleased with this film, on more levels than one. First
off, in a world chock-full of brainless science-fiction movies with
irrelevant plots, it has a storyline that can carry the viewer from
beginning to end on a cushioned seat. Keanu Reeves', obviously not the
best actor in the world, makes for a fairly believable savior of
human-kind in the form of Thomas `Neo' Anderson. He is contacted by a
world-famous computer hacker named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who
thinks Neo is the `chosen one'. But I'm sure you're asking `What is the
Matrix?' and `The chosen one for what, exactly?'</P>
<P>The Matrix is, to quote a character in the movie, `the world that has
pulled over your eyes to shield you from the truth..' I'll not reveal
anything else, but consider this a favor toward you.</P>
<P>To learn how to manipulate the Matrix to his advantage, Neo first must
learn all the tricks of the trade (which involve spectacular stunts of
defying gravity, dodging bullets and leaping tall buildings in a single
bound, ala Superman). Then he must face-off against the enemy, called
the Sentinent Agents. They are dressed in black with strikingly cool
shades, and are headed by the immensely droll Agent Smith (the
delightfully deadpan Hugo Weaving). The acting is an all-around
surprise. In addition to Reeves there's the always excellent Fishburne
filling his role perfectly, and a hot newcomer named Carrie-Anne Moss,
who can seriously bruise a SWAT team. The special effects are seamless
and jaw-dropping, but they don't upstage the human dimensions of the
story.</P>
<P>I'll get right to the point: the action sequences in this film are
absolutely the best I've ever seen. The Wachowski brothers, Larry and
Andy, have obviously covered the book on how to construct a jaw-dropping
shootout. Until now, John Woo has been the unprecedented king of a
slo-mo action sequence. Until now. Even more impressive, however, are
the film's martial arts battles, which use a familiar device from the
Gap TV ads, where the camera circles the room while a character freezes
in midair with a drop-kick maneuver. Your reaction is bound to resemble
`Wow', or `Holy...' after seeing these unbelievable feats.</P>
<P>I had my grievances. There was an unnecessary double-cross scenario
planted unwisely into the 2nd act, and a few of the supporting
characters were only clichés from other movies of this kind. The Matrix
as a whole is a dazzling, wonderfully exciting escape from reality. What
is the Matrix? No, I won't tell, but it's a heck of a lot of fun finding
out.
