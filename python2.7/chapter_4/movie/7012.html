<P>     It's quite possible to argue that Jack Nicholson is among the ten 
best actors working today.  Some of his performances, like those in 
CHINATOWN and THE SHINING (for example), are classics.  So it's a little 
discouraging to note the alarming number of duds that Nicholson has 
recently participated in.  The star's latest, BLOOD AND WINE, continues 
this unfortunate trend -- Nicholson is good, but the movie isn't.</P>
<P>     Analyzed purely from a plot perspective, there's nothing terribly 
wrong with BLOOD AND WINE.  It's an unremarkable noir thriller with a 
few twists that, despite being telegraphed too early, keep the story 
moving.  Nicholson plays Alex Gates, the proprietor of a wine store.  
Alex is broke because he spends too much money lavishing gifts on his 
mistresses.  His latest is the stunning Gabriela (Jennifer Lopez), a 
mini-skirted nanny for a rich family.  Alex's solution to his financial 
insolvency is to steal a necklace from Gabriela's employers.  To help 
him with the burglary, he has brought in Victor (Michael Caine), a 
lowlife British thief with a consumptive cough and a taste for the finer 
things.  Things start to go wrong, however, when Gabriela becomes 
attracted to her lover's sullen stepson, Jason (Stephen Dorff), and 
Alex's wife (Judy Davis) finds out about his latest indiscretion. </P>
<P>     As involved as that all sounds, there are two reasons why it 
doesn't make for interesting drama.  In the first place, huge chunks of 
BLOOD AND WINE seem recycled.  We have stolen jewels, an attractive 
woman torn between an older and younger man, and a thick layer of 
mistrust between criminals.  BLOOD AND WINE has rare, isolated bursts of 
energy, but, for the most part, it comes down to fist fights, 
predictable betrayals, and car chases.  </P>
<P>     The second flaw is more detrimental, however.  One key to a good 
thriller is fashioning interesting characters.  They don't have to be 
likable -- RESERVOIR DOGS was populated by a bunch of no-good thugs and 
killers -- but they have to grab and hold the audience's attention.  No 
one in BLOOD AND WINE is able to do that.  This film contains a group of 
unappealing, banal personalities.  The more we watch them, the more 
apathetic we become towards their plight.  </P>
<P>     Even Nicholson, who displays all of his usual charming, cynical 
mannerisms, can't redeem Alex -- there's not enough there for the actor 
to work with.  Michael Caine has fun playing the amoral Victor, savoring 
one of his most interesting roles in some time.  Victor's motto, which 
adequately describes his personality, is that "there's no such thing as 
honor among thieves.  It's a myth."  Judy Davis is underused in a scanty 
part as Alex's wife.  Would that the same could be said of Stephen 
Dorff, whose sour, one-note performance becomes wearisome before the end 
of the first reel.  Jennifer Lopez, soon to star in SELENA, adds sex 
appeal, but little else.</P>
<P>     BLOOD AND WINE's director, Bob Rafelson, has previously made five 
movies with Nicholson, including 1970's memorable FIVE EASY PIECES.  
Their last collaboration prior to this one, 1992's MAN TROUBLE, was an 
unmitigated disaster, and BLOOD AND WINE isn't much of a step upwards.  
As an attempt to recapture past glory, this picture falls considerably 
short of the mark.</P>
<P>     There are instances when fully-realized characters can save a tired 
plot, and times when a snappy, well-executed storyline can cover up for 
ill-developed personalities.  Unfortunately, BLOOD AND WINE has neither.  
To give the film credit, it does possess a certain, dark style, but all 
the atmosphere in the world can't fill the holes left by the screenplay.  
BLOOD AND WINE develops a lot less than we expect from it, and leaves us 
wondering when Jack Nicholson will next tackle a role worthy of his 
reputation.</P>
