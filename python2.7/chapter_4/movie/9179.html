Review: My Best Friend's Wedding</PRE>
<P>Starring: Julia Roberts, Dermot Mulroney, Cameron Diaz, Rupert Everett
Written by Ronald Bass
Directed by P.J. Hogan</P>
<P>It only seems like yesterday when a small romantic comedy was released,
reviving the career of its male star and launching the career proper of
it's female one. Pretty Woman was the sleeper hit of the year and managed
to land Julia Roberts her second consecutive Oscar nomination, as well as
putting Richard Gere into the hearts of women everywhere (for a year or
two, at least).</P>
<P>Roberts started to make a career for herself playing beautiful women either
in love or in peril, but after a supporting role in Steven Spielberg's Hook
she took a break, only taking a cameo in Robert Altman's The Player before
returning in Alan J. Pakula's The Pelican Brief, which lead to a string of
relatively unsuccessful roles in such films as Something to Talk About and
I Love Trouble. Roberts' honeymoon with American audiences, it seemed, was
over, and moviegoers had a new sweetheart, in the sickening guise of Sandra
Bullock (critics even raved that her hit romantic comedy, While You Were
Sleeping, was "The Pretty Woman of the Nineties!" - conveniently forgetting
that the latter was, indeed, released in 1990). Roberts started putting
quality before salary by appearing in less commercial fare such as Everyone
Says I Love You and Michael Collins, but that didn't seem to be enough.</P>
<PRE>It was time for a comeback.</PRE>
<P>My Best Friend's Wedding is a complete success for Roberts, who plays
Julianne, a restaurant critic who's life is thrown into turmoil when her
ex-lover/best friend Michael (the comatose Dermot Mulroney) announces his
engagement to his brand new love, Kimmy (future star Cameron Diaz), who in
turn recruits Julianne to be her maid of honour. Julianne becomes insanely
jealous and plots to break the relationship by any means necessary to win
Michael, for whom she suddenly realises her true feelings.</P>
<P>Lending a helping hand is the disapproving George (Rupert Everett) who,
while sympathetic to Julianne's cause, decides to run things his own way,
much to Julianne's dismay.</P>
<P>The film was directed by Muriel's Wedding's writer-director P.J. Hogan and
so there are, predictably, some terrific set pieces, most notably Kimmy's
brave attempt at karaoke and George's scene in the restaurant, where he and
the other patrons break into song. There are also numourous little touches
that are far funnier than you'd fine in a romantic comedy directed by a
Hollywood filmmaker; the opening title sequence, for example, as well as
scenes involving, among other things, helium and Michelangelo's David
(don't ask).</P>
<P>Roberts gives her best performance yet. After seeing this, I realised
something I had never thought would happen - I was becoming a Julia Roberts
fan, a statement which would have appalled me six months ago. On the
strength of her work here she has easily wrestled Sandra Bullock off her
perch and should be able to rest comfortably for a couple of years yet,
although she should definately look out for her co-star, Cameron Diaz, who
has the charisma and personality to be a major screen presence in the near
future.</P>
<P>Someone with a distinct lack of charisma, however, is Dermot Mulroney. His
casting is puzzling; although he does turn in an adequate performance, he
just doesn't fit the role. Why would anyone even care about this man? Why
would someone as dull as Michael have two women such as Julianne and Kimmy
fighting for him?</P>
<P>At the other end of the spectrum is Rupert Everett. He is perfect as
George, Julianne's editor who just happens to be gay. Every single scene he
appears in is a delight, and if he doesn't turn his role here into at least
an Oscar nomination then the performances that are given nods will have to
be extraordinary.</P>
<P>This is the film that should redefine the American romantic comedy. While
mildly predictable, the screenplay is fine, and Hogan's direction is
flawless. Mulroney is the only real flaw, but with such fine actors as
Roberts, Diaz and especially Everett, it is a flaw that can be easily
overlooked.</P>
<PRE>4.5 out of 5</PRE>
