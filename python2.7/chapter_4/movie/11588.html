<PRE>[drama]</PRE>
<P>starring: Matt Damon (Will Hunting), Robin Williams (Prof. Sean Maguire),
 Stellan Skasgård (Prof. Gerald Lambeau), Ben Affleck (Chuckie); written by
 Matt Damon, Ben Affleck; produced by Lawrence Bender; directed by Gus Van
 Sant.</P>
<P>Seen March 18, 1998 at 7 p.m. at Rotterdam Square Mall (Rotterdam, NY),
 theater #3, by myself using my Sony/Loews critic's pass. [Theater rating: ***:
 good sound, picture, and seats]</P>
<P>        Most genres use story as a device, backdrop, or a conveince, but drama is a
 genre all about story and is just as likely to suffer from problems that
 hinder the storytelling process (i.e. predictability, question of
 plausibility, etc.) as anything else. Perhaps the reason drama gets a bad rap
 is due to our concentration on these elements where we might not notice them
 otherwise. In its most basic form, "Good Will Hunting" is as classic a drama
 as they come, but like its hero, it manages to exceed well beyond the
 standards to the point where it creates new ones. It isn't just  a
 surprisingly enjoyable drama, it IS drama.</P>
<P>        The film opens by introducing us to Will Hunting (Damon), a suave young man
 who holds a custodial position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 Looking at him one could never tell (or even believe, for that matter) that he
 is actually an orphan, a criminal, and a born genus. Thankfully, these aspects
 are put on the back burner for the sake of character development, which makes
 them all the more relevant later.</P>
<P>         Will likes to do things any another college-aged guy in a big city would do,
 such as hit the bars and clubs with his friends and mingle with the ladies.
 The initial atmosphere and dialogue is very realistic as the performances,
 combined with the terrific directing create for the kind of authentic
 camaraderie most films only try for. The delicate pacing allows us to learn
 things about Will by carefully dropping hints at the right moments without
 rushing anything. In fact, some elements are purposely left open-ended and
 contain little explanation, such as a scene in which Will and his best friend
 Chuckie (Affleck) attempt to beat up some guys over an elementary grudge. When
 Will is arrested he is freed with help from Gerald Lambeau (Skasgård) - an MIT
 professor who has realized Will's hidden talent and wants to help him.</P>
<P>        Part of Lambeau's plea bargain with the judge is that Will must undergo
 therapy, but when a few confrontations with psychiatrists go bad, Lambeau
 finally finds the perfect shrink - his old college friend Sean Maguire
 (Williams). Here is where the film begins to prove its merit even as the story
 works as expected. Will is a good kid at heart, but he has a tremendous
 problem with authority, but only Maguire is able to get past his violent
 temper and feel the ability (and need) to help him. Within just a few minutes
 time both men are able to analyze each other: Will because he is a genus, and
 Maguire because he's a psychologist. The process by which this occurs is
 nothing short of amazing, especially considering how quickly it happens
 without becoming the least bit trite. </P>
<P>        And if the film hadn't already established itself as a power character-driven
 drama, it manages to top itself as the story continues to expand. It's not
 surprising that Will meets a girl (Minnie Driver as Skyla), but what is
 surprising is the way in which the relationship works in conjunction with the
 various sub-plots. Damon and Driver have great chemistry together, and the
 screenplay allows them to be more than simply generic lovers, but as two
 intelligent people who genuinely care for each other. Will discusses the
 relationship with Maguire, whose analysis is fascinating as he draws parallels
 to his relationship with his now-deceased wife and thus provides for good
 character development and interaction.</P>
<P>        Although the film is comprised of various highly intellectual elements,
 intelligence without application is a pretty boring thing. Affleck and Damon
 realize this and have managed to chisel their script with the tiniest details
 of insight. The characters are so likable because we're allowed to learn what
 makes them tick - they're not simply people involved in conflicts for the sake
 of a Hollywood drama. And when Will and Skyla's romance becomes troubled it
 seems realistic as it isn't used as a gimmick.</P>
<P>        A countless number of minor topics come up and are dealt with accordingly,
 such as Will refusing to take a government job because of the harm it might do
 to people he doesn't know, or how his job as a construction worker is more
 honorable than a mathematician. Many idiosyncratic observations are also made,
 mostly through common dialogue, all of which continue to demonstrate the
 film's remarkable insight into everything it deals with.</P>
<P>        What's great about a film like "Good Will Hunting" is that within the course
 of a couple of hours it manages to deal with some of the heaviest subjects of
 life and always in the greatest of ways. It's emotionally powerful and an
 example of great story-telling. If there's any justice it will become a modern
 classic.</P>
