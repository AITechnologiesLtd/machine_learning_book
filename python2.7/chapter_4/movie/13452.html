<PRE>THE CHAMBERMAID ON THE TITANIC
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     As in a wonderful dream, Horty, a dirt-poor foundry worker, finds
himself in a luxury hotel room in a foreign city.  Answering a knock on
the bedroom door, he finds himself face to face with a beautiful woman.
Since there is no room in town, what with the maiden voyage tomorrow of
the Titanic on which she will be a chambermaid, he ends up sharing his
room with her.</P>
<P>     And it gets better.  Pulling back the sheets to reveal her skimpy
gown and her lithe body, she invites him to get out of the chair where
he is trying to sleep and spend the night with her in his bed.  It is
what happens or doesn't happen next that forms the basis of the plot.</P>
<P>     Director J.J. Bigas Luna's THE CHAMBERMAID ON THE TITANIC (LA
FEMME DE CHAMBRE DU TITANIC), based on the novel by Didier Decoin,
isn't some cheap exploitation picture trying to ride on the coattails
of TITANIC's success.  Instead, it is a delightful and whimsical tale,
full of the magic of the storytelling.  Beautifully and delicately
constructed, the film captivates and surprises the audience.  The
superlative acting adds to the enjoyment, and unlike many French films,
the three leads will probably be familiar to American viewers.</P>
<P>     It all starts when the strikingly handsome Horty, played with
quiet intensity and precision by Olivier Martinez from THE HORSEMAN ON
THE ROOF, wins a contest.  Every year his foundry in France runs a
brutal decathlon-style event, and this year there is to be a special
prize.</P>
<P>     The prize turns out to be two tickets to London to witness the
launching of the Titanic.  The foundry company's president lies, saying
there is only a single ticket because he wants time with Horty's wife
Zoe, while Horty is out of the country.  Romane Bohringer from Colonel
Chabert plays the innocent-looking Zoe.</P>
<P>     It is in London that Horty is smitten by the lovely chambermaid
named Marie.  Played with devilish good looks by Aitana Sanchez-Gijon
from A WALK IN THE CLOUDS, Maria soon has captured Horty's heart.  When
she sails away and dies on the Titanic, he has only her picture to
remember her by.  He dotes on her photograph as if it is the Star of
India.</P>
<P>     And that is only the setup for the plot.  The body of the movie
occurs after his return when Horty and Zoe confront each other with
their alleged infidelities.</P>
<P>     Soon he is spending his time at the bar telling the story about
Marie.  He comes to realize that his gift in life is not manual labor
but telling mesmerizing stories.  The question is what is true, and
what isn't?</P>
<P>     The audience's reaction may be similar to those of his friends in
the bar.  They are not entirely sure if they care about his veracity
since these ribald, adult fairy tales keep getting better and better.
The men and women of the town hang breathlessly on his every word.
Every night becomes Super Bowl Sunday, in which no one would miss going
to the bar to listen to him.</P>
<P>     The touching movie takes many unpredictable twists before coming
to a surprising and completely satisfying conclusion.  Like Horty's
stories, the movie is smart enough to serve up delicious little morsels
of ambiguity for us to savor and ponder long after the house lights
have gone up.</P>
<P>     THE CHAMBERMAID ON THE TITANIC runs a fast 1:41.  It is in French
with English subtitles.  The film is not rated but would be an R for
profanity and sex and would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
