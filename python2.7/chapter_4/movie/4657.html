<P>      At last!  A movie that explains the O.J. verdict!  Well-endowed
literary revisionist Demi Moore stars in this thrill-less thriller, about
a juror-in-jeopardy who must convince her peers to acquit a mobster, or
else whispering bad guy Alec Baldwin will do something scary to her son. 
(Such as, say, forcing him to watch Mom strip on a late-night television
talk show?) Bad bad bad.  There's a fundamental wrongness to THE JUROR
that almost defies explanation.  Every possible dramatic convention is
ignored; every on-screen action has no meaning other than as an absurd,
immediate gratification.  Even the camp value is minimal.  The first
unwatchable movie of the year and, yet, people were clapping and cheering
to the end.  I can't explain it.  Perhaps, after viewing Demi's various
tight-fitting tops, they had formed the opinion that, for certain figures,
Moore is better. </P>
