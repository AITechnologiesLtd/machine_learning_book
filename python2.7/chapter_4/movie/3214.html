<P>     And so it goes with any Disney movie.  The corporation can't
resist inserting at least one morally-uplifting theme into each of its
live action films.  While this philosophy might not be a distraction in
adventure movies like IRON WILL or THE JUNGLE BOOK, it's out-of-place
in the midst of HOUSEGUEST's juvenile humor.  People who attend movies
to see beautiful women with buck teeth and dentists operating with
anesthetized hands aren't looking for a discourse on the value of true
friendship and the need to believe in yourself.  Plain and simple,
they're in the theater to laugh.</P>
<P>     However, original intentions aside, it's impossible to deny one of
HOUSEGUEST's less savory agendas:  to act as a one-hundred eight minute
commercial for McDonald's.  This takes product placement to an obscene
level.  Scenes occur in front of, in, and around the fast food joint.
There's a nostalgia-laced parody of the "You Deserve a Break Today" TV
commercials, complete with the jingle.  Sinbad takes about one minute
placing a food order, checking off half the items on the menu.
Characters bond over Big Macs and fries.  On and on it goes...  It's
obvious where the audience is being manipulated to go for a meal after
the movie.  So, out of spite, I went to Burger King.</P>
<P>     As ACE VENTURA was meant as a vehicle for Jim Carrey, so
HOUSEGUEST is all Sinbad's.  Admittedly, the two comics have different
styles, but both share bigger-than-life personalities.  And, even
though I find Sinbad less irritating than the rubber-faced half of DUMB
AND DUMBER, nearly two hours of him is too much.  Even with likable
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE alum Phil Hartman as the film's straight man,
HOUSEGUEST wears out its welcome more than a half hour before the
Christmas-themed final credits start rolling.</P>
<P>     Plot-wise, there's little here beyond a few insubstantial
strands.  Everything that happens is designed to get Sinbad's Kevin
Franklin into a situation where he masquerades as someone he's not--a
wealthy dentist with an impeccable reputation.  It takes charisma and
energy, but not much effort, to pull the wool over everyone's eyes,
which leads to a series of predictable misadventures (such as speaking
at a high school career day when he doesn't even know what his supposed
profession is).  Meanwhile, a couple of incompetent goons (Paul
Ben-Victor and Tony Longo) are on his trail, trying to recoup $50,000.
Hence, the obligatory, poorly-edited chase scenes.</P>
<P>     The humor is at low tide, both in terms of quality and content
(thankfully, scatological jokes are kept to a minimum--DUMB AND
DUMBER offered more than enough of those).  I chuckled my way through a
fair portion of HOUSEGUEST.  Unfortunately, most of the time, I was
laughing *at* the movie, not *with* it.  In fact, I'm not sure whether
my most hilarious moment was intentionally funny.</P>
<P>     Admittedly, most who share my taste in films won't be lining up
for HOUSEGUEST, so this may be a case of "preaching to the converted."
Nevertheless, every once in a while, it's possible to find a rare gem
in one of the many like-minded comedies that spring up every year.
(Remember PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES?  How about CROCODILE
DUNDEE?) Alas, HOUSEGUEST is too tarnished.  About the best this film
has to offer is Sinbad doing his usual shtick beneath the Golden Arches
while Phil Hartman offers him some fries and confesses to having
fantasies about being Matlock.</P>
