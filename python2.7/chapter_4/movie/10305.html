<P>This movie was interesting.  As far as story is concerned, it was a
hell of a lot better than Alien 3.  At the same time, it was trying to
be an amalgamation of Alien and Aliens, and the result is, well, just
interesting.</P>
<P>ALIEN RESURRECTION is the story of the Auriga, a military ship which is
being used for the transport, breeding, and study of the alien species. 
A band of mercenaries boards the ship and becomes trapped on it when the
aliens escape.  Notice I haven't said anything about Lt. Ellen Ripley. 
The reason for this is because Ripley doesn't do much in this movie. 
Ripley used to be the centerpiece of the Alien series; apparently, the
aliens have really taken over.  Regretfully, in this movie, she seems to
be just another one of the people trying to get off the ship.  She is
brought to life as a clone (with some residual alien characteristics),
but is not "resurrected," as the title of the movie would have you
believe.  If she was truly resurrected, she would have kicked more alien
ass, expressed herself more, led more, and not stood idly by while other
people struggle with the aliens.</P>
<P>Ripley, in the original ALIEN, was the first female hero, leader, and
the first to survive at the end of the movie.  This made the character
of Ripley (and consequently Sigourney Weaver) into a role model and
inspiration for several young actresses and women everywhere. After all,
the women usually did not survive a horror movie, and if they did, they
would be subject to the damsel-in-distress syndrome.  Lt. Ellen Ripley
changed all that.  The character and role model was further reinforced
in ALIENS, where Ripley got to kick some alien ass and exorcise her own
demons in the process.  Weaver portrayed a woman who could be strong,
aggressive, and not lose her femininity in the process: she was not
killing aliens just to kill them; she had a little girl to protect. 
ALIEN 3 was just a rehash of the original ALIEN with a "what's the point
anymore?" version of Ripley.  In ALIEN: RESURRECTION, Ripley is just
there, because an ALIEN movie would not be an ALIEN movie without
Ripley.  I guess there's nothing else interesting enough to explore
about her character anymore.  That's too bad.  "Greedy studio execs
resurrect Ripley for another outing" would have been the headline if
this were a newspaper article.  Ripley had to be re-invented to attract
Weaver back to the role; unfortunately, the old Ripley is more
interesting than the new one. </P>
<P>What Ridley Scott (the director of ALIEN) established and James Cameron
(director of ALIENS) reinforced, David Fincher (director of ALIEN 3)
wasn't quite sure what to do with.  This criticism is not to deprecate
Fincher; its just that he was given the helm of the Titanic and was told
to keep it afloat as long as possible.  Given the story he had to deal
with, I'd say Fincher did a fabulous job.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director
of ALIEN RESURRECTION) looks like he didn't burden himself with any type
of ALIEN legacy.  He decided to make his movie his way. I respect that
kind of independence.  The film looks great, with stimulating color
contrasts and respectable FX.  Sigourney Weaver is a little more sedate
(with a few exceptions) in this movie.  Winona Ryder is good, although a
little out of her league amongst these people. Ron Perlman is as good as
always.</P>
<P>The writing demonstrates an openness to new ideas about the aliens,
although it's a little zealous about presenting them, and in the
process, the audience becomes lost as to how certain things happen. 
Ripley and the aliens seem to have a bond now; what kind of bond?  They
take the Queen out of Ripley's cloned body, and she starts to breed; how
is this possible?  I'm not a biologist, but don't you need a fertile
male to impregnate the female?  Were there any alien males on the ship?
Then the Queen (all of a sudden) sprouts a human-like womb after
squeezing out a few alien eggs; again, how?  How did the womb show up
after all that egg laying?  What impregnated her new womb?  Straight
cloning?  I don't think so.  And this newborn?  All this comes near the
end of the movie, after every familiar idea is exhausted.  It is clear
the ideas that should have been explored were neglected in favor of
things that are all too familiar: aliens, eggs, chest bursters, face
huggers, people trying to get off the ship, and, unfortunately, Ripley's
face, not her character.  This neglect means this movie is just a
rehash, and not an exploration of a new incarnation of Ripley and the
aliens.</P>
<P>Regardless of its flaws, this movie wasn't bad.  I just wish they would
have explored the ideas they brought up late in the film.  Apparently,
those ideas are brought up strictly for sequels (again, the studio execs
make sure they get a return on their investment, and I can't say I blame
them).  I could always describe each movie in the Alien series with one
superlative: ALIEN was suspenseful, ALIENS was exciting, and ALIEN 3 was
depressing.  The best word for Alien Resurrection would have to be
twisted.  It had potential -- maybe a second writer could have fleshed
out the loose ends better.</P>
