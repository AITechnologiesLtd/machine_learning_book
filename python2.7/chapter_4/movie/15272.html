<P>The mess that was the post-production of this film has turned into one
of the finest cinematic efforts of the year (See little known facts
below for more info on the mess). Director Tony Kaye wanted his name
removed from this film after meddling from "suits" and actor Edward
Norton (Kaye's allegations). A technicality prevented him from removing
his name, and out of these ashes comes forth a solid film about race,
hate and the human spirit.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Super-neo-nazi-skinhead Derek Vinyard (Norton) gets put into jail for
killing two black youths that were trying to steal his car. During his
stay in the bighouse, his younger brother Danny (Furlong) follows his
hateful ways and joins the nearest skinhead clan. While in jail, Derek
goes through many changes, and comes out with a new outlook on life.
Now, he wants to relay his newfound enlightenment to his impressionable
brother, before it's too late.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Intense, powerful, stylish directorial debut from British director Tony
Kaye, pulls together all aspects of dramatic achievement, including a
solid and emotional story line, an original film style and solid
performances by its cast, most specifically, the genuinely flawless
portrayal by Edward Norton. This film drives home many of the
sentiments seething beneath the hate of many people in this country. It
probes to explain and unravel their seeds of antipathy, while
presenting us with a fair portrayal of the many sides of the human
development. Why do we hate? And even when we do, do we allow it to
serve any real purpose in our lives, or do we simply hate because we
need something or someone else to blame? One of the characters said it
best in the film, "Has anything you've done, made your life better?"</P>
<PRE>The answer is quite obvious.</PRE>
<P>This film grapples with many of the hypotheses behind these questions,
and insists on educating us through creative and thought-provoking
imagery, and solid performances by its main protagonists. This film
reminded me of 1996's DEAD MAN WALKING (8/10), with the main
performance by Norton rating on the same scale as that of Penn in the
former film. In fact, I see Norton's performance as the more complex of
the two, since he actually portrays two polar opposite personalities in
this same movie. And despite Norton's real-life Ivy League background,
he manages to pull off an impressive acting gig as the head skinhead
who eventually clues in as to the hypocrisies of his peers. Mr. Oscar,
please save a seat for Edward Norton for the end of the year
nominations for Best Actor, because this is definitely one deserved
performance. All that and he's built like a champ in this film. Wow,
what a man!</P>
<P>The rest of the cast was also well qualified to handle their posts,
with the other Edward, Furlong, handing in another well-developed
performance of a sulken youth whose heart is pierced with sensitivity.
The only small issues that I did have with this movie was that it was a
tiny bit too long, and that the portrayal of Norton's girlfriend by
Fairuza Balk, was completely one-dimensional. The flashbacks were
handled extremely well, the style of the film enhanced its viewing, and
the film's gut-wrenching conclusion drove home every point made in its
previous two hours. The openness of some minds does not alleviate the
continued presence of hate and fear in our society. It is up to each
and every individual to manage their own rationale of hate, and
determine the truth within its purpose. Who does it really benefit? </P>
<P>This film bleeds the truth, speaks the lingo, and delivers on all
counts of entertainment, socially relevant value and solid
performances. Definitely one of the best told movies of the year! </P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Tony Kaye wanted his name changed to "Humpty Dumpty" for this
film, because of his disagreements with New Line Cinema, but the
Director's Guild of America disallowed it (One of the rules in regards
to changing your name in movie credits, is that you have to agree not
to bad-mouth the movie in public. In Kaye's case, he had taken out ads
in the Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, to do just that.) He
is presently putting together a documentary on the "Making of American
History X", which he hopes to premiere at next year's Sundance Film
Festival. His original cut of the movie was a mere 87 minutes, and he
also managed to be the cinematographer and camera operator on this
project.
Before this film, Tony Kaye had a lavish career as one of Europe's most
daring commercial directors, creating groundbreakingly gorgeous ads for
Guinness beer, Reebok and Volvo. 
Edward Norton lobbied hard for this role, and even offered to take a
pay cut (He claims that he only received about "one-fifth" of his then
$1million asking price.) He also put on 30 pounds of muscle for this
role. He has a history degree from Yale.
First-time screenwriter David McKenna is only 28 years of age.
Edward Furlong was discovered by a casting director at the Boys Club of
Pasadena, and won the part of John Connor in the 1991 film TERMINATOR 2
(8/10). He is presently involved in a live-in relationship with his
former tutor, Jackie Domac. She is 12 years his senior.
Actors Stacy Keach and Avery Brooks are better known for their
respective TV roles as "Mike Hammer: Private Eye" and Hawk from
"Spenser: For Hire". In 1984, Keach was jailed in England for nine
months for smuggling cocaine. Brooks spent 13 years as a Professor for
Drama-Science at Rutgers University in New Jersey from 1972 to 1985.
Fairuza (Balk) means turqoise in Turkish. 
Actor Ethan Suplee, who plays the fat skinhead Seth in this film, was
also in Kevin Smith's MALLRATS (6/10) and CHASING AMY (7/10).</P>
