<P>Jackie Chan is back! If this sentence means anything to you, if Kung-Fu, Karate and elegant fights make you happy, see this film. If not, you don't have to read the rest of this review. Maybe I am wrong, but I believe that the fans of Jackie Chan and martial arts will get much more out of this than other members of the audience. On front, let me just say that this is a very entertaining film. It is somewhat 'Wild Wild West' tried to be. Jackie Chan has never been better. And it may very be his first film where the story is equally appealing as the action sequences.</P>
<P>In the unknown regions of ancient China, lies a forbidden city, surrounded by majestic mountains, and hidden from the rest of the world. Mystique and treasures are conceived behind its walls and protected by the royal army of brave and invincible warriors. The Emperor's daughter (Lucy Liu) dreams of another life, where freedom is more important than wealth and traditions. Seduced by the western way of life, she follows an American officer to the land of opportunities, where she falls under the power of Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), a former warrior that escaped the forbidden city for the same dreams. Demanding a gigantic ransom for the princess, he imprisons her in his mine, where Chinese workers are tortured under his tyranny. It is now time for four brave worriers to rescue the princess and return her safely home. One of these worriers is Chon Wang (Jackie Chan). On a train to Carson City, Chon runs into Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) -- the inept leader of a gang of a bumbling but dang!
erous train robbers. He is an outlaw with ethics (imagine that). A romantic that  never steals from women and can barely shoot a gun. When Roy hears about the ransom that has to be paid, he becomes friends with Chon, but their relationship turns soon into a true friendship. We follow them on their quest, filled with dangers, surprises and adventures...</P>
<P>Forbidden exotic cities, snowy mountains, golden prairies, saloons, beautiful princesses, brave heroes, evil villains, duels to the death and "happily ever after" -- this film has it all. Like its plot, the movie combines the classic Cowboy-movies with the beautiful Hong Kong-action. The result is a good portion of good old fashioned entertainment presented with a new and refreshing twist. Most of the time 'Shanghai Noon' is very funny because of this rather original premise: the Ancient East meets the Wild West. You won't find a better contrast than that. China is a land of beauty,magic and mystique. Ancient traditions that command total obedience. Here a man must not think for himself. He must follow orders from a great, almost divine force. America is a land of endless fields, green forests, clear rivers. Unchanged since the beginning of time. Yet untouched by man's vanity. It is the sunrise of a new civilization that slowly emerges from the shadows of the gray taverns. Ben!
eath the ruffness, lies the endless and pure freedom. Alfred Gough's and Miles Millar's script consists of endless and mostly amusing whacks on the cultural differences between the civilizations. We follow our brave warrior on his quest, and his many amusing encounters with the Indians, Outlaws and Wild Cowboys. There are moments in the first hour of the film, when you won't stop laughing. But after making his point, first-time-director Tom Dey doesn't quite know what to do and so the second half of the movie is mostly a wait for the ending. Of course in a film like this, a climax can not exist for one simple reason: from the very beginning you know how the film will end. That is why the screenwriter should save some of the hilarious moments till the end. Instead they are all released in the first half of the movie, which although makes you laugh non stop in the beginning, leave you bored and a bit disappointed in the end. In other words, this film extends its curtecy for all !
too long, repeating itself for no obvious reason.</P>
<P>In the end it is the wisely chosen pair that holds this film together. That element is the constant positive force that makes the movie into a great experience. Together Chan and Wilson make a great and believable team. Jackie Chan is superb in this role. I couldn't think of anyone who could provoke genuine emotions between the graceful Kung-Fu kicks. There is something about him that alienates him from the other actors in his category. He does not posses the muscles of Arnold Schwartznegger, he doesn't resort to explosions or digital effects to look interesting (like Steven Segal), nor does he move with the gracefulness of Jean Claude van Dam. And yet he generates so much warmth and sweetness that it compensates for all the virtues mentioned above. We'r not just amazed by his physical abilities. He makes us care about his character. Wilson has what it takes to be a failed cowboy. What's very important is that he understands the atmosphere, the style of the film, so that he do!
esn't over act or make his character to serious.</P>
<P>A very decent cinematography and costume design are accompanied by an energetic musical score by Randy Edelman. The editing may need some polishing, since the film drags on for all too long, testing everyone's patience. Though Dey presents a story that gives him many possibilities, he uses few of them and resorts soon to an ordinary action / adventure that (though not original) is solid. It is a less artistic, but lighter and more amusing experience than 'Mission: Impossible 2' . A true, cheerful good hearted delight that provides a light, harmless entertainment for audience members of any age. </P>
