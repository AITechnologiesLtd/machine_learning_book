                       Halloween: 20 Years Later  (aka H20)

<P>        For better or for worse, I am a child of the '80s.  Yes, I cried
at "E.T." when I was ten.  I get nostalgic when I hear the "Miami Vice"
theme song.  I spent most of my lunch money on games of "Donkey Kong."
And yeah, if you must know, I've still got a copy of "Thriller" buried
deep in my album collection.
        Because of this, it's almost unfair for me to review horror
movies.  You may as well ask me to critique the time period during
which my entire personality was defined.  Horror movies weren't just a
once-in-a-while thing for my friends and I; we were obsessed by the silly
things.  Yes, that's right: I, your friendly neighborhood self-appointed
film critic, who loves to watch boring, subtitled French dramas, still
gets giggly with glee at the thought of a slasher flick.  I'm not proud
of this, but I can't help it.  It's in my blood, thanks to the many
Saturday afternoons I spent over at the homes of various friends during
my junior high-school years, catching up on the latest adventures of
Jason, Freddy, and all their ilk.
        The '80s were the closest thing to a Renaissance that the horror
genre has ever had.  New films appeared every few weeks in the already
saturated marketplace, and my friends and I saw most of them.  As America
moved into the politically-correct '90s, however, a decline in both the
quantity and quality of these films became apparent.  Gone were the
suspense and excitement that made the movies so much fun to watch, replaced
instead with lingering shots of gore and brutality.  Attendance plummeted.
Hollywood, following their usual logic, figured this must mean that people
were tired of scary movies.  No, Hollywood, we weren't.  We quit watching
horror flicks because, while we want to be scared, we don't neccessarily
need to see a step-by-step disembowelment of each victim.  The glory days
of suspensful thrillers were gone forever, or so it seemed.
        But in 1996, a little film called "Scream" came along and single-
handedly revitalised the horror industry.  Here, for the first time in
over a decade, was a horror movie with memorable characters and a
fiendishly clever plot, featuring witty (and often hilarious) dialogue.
So profound was "Scream" that, for the first time ever, a screenwriter
(first-time scripter Kevin Williamson), got as much attention as the
director (horror veteran Wes Craven).  The duo teamed up again on the
equally entertaining and successful "Scream 2"; since then, Williamson has
found his services much in demand: he penned the screenplay for "I Know
What You Did Last Summer," in addition to creating the hit TV series
"Dawson's Creek."
        In an interview with a popular screenwriting magazine, Williamson
was asked to name his favorite movie.  "Halloween," he replied without a
moment's hesitation.  He then went on to cite the profound effect that
the movie had on both his life and the horror genre in general.  He did
not exaggerate: "Halloween" is a certified classic, single-handedly
creating (for better or for worse) the slasher movie.
        The story, for those of you not in the know, involves an eight-
year-old boy named Michael Myers, who brutally murdered his sister on
Halloween night, 1963.  Committed to a mental hospital, Myers underwent
years of psycho-analysis before his doctor, Sam Loomis, pronounced him
incurable.  In 1978, Michael, now 23, escaped from the institution and
made his way back to his family's home in Haddonfield Illinois, with Dr.
Loomis in hot pursuit.  The climax of the film, in which Michael stalks the
residents of the neighborhood while Dr. Loomis attempts to stop him, is one
of the genre's finest moments.
        "Halloween" starred a then-unknown actress named Jamie Lee Curtis,
playing the role of all-American girl Laurie Strode, tormented by Myers
for reasons she doesn't understand.  She did an admirable job; her
performance still stands up, twenty years later.  Curtis brought a depth
to the character that reached far beyond the typical caricature roles that
women were usually assigned in such movies; it's easy to believe that
Laurie Strode is a "real" person, not the typical cardboard cutout that
is usually preferred in such parts.  That's why we rooted for her.
        "Halloween" was a huge success, both critically and financially.
Roger Ebert's famous review, in which he gave the film four stars (his
highest rating) and compared it favorably to "Psycho," was typical of the
adulation and praise that it received.  And movie-goers took note: until
recently, "Halloween" was the highest-grossing independent movie *ever*.
(If I remember correctly, "The English Patient" was the film which finally
stole away the title.)
        A sequel quickly followed, and "Halloween II," while flawed,
managed to thrill and delight audiences all over again.  Picking up mere
moments after the original movie ended, we watched as Dr. Loomis continued
his search for Michael Myers, who'd managed to slither from his grasp.
Curtis's character is sent to a nearby hospital to have her wounds treated.
Michael, wanting desperately to finish the job he'd begun earlier that
night, follows her, giving us the opportunity for a suspensful game of cat
and mouse.  In an "Empire Strikes Back"-type twist we learn that Michael is
actally Laurie's brother, which is the reason he's so gung-ho on killing
her: he wants to dispose of his entire family.  Dr. Loomis comes to the
rescue, however, and Michael is apparently destroyed.
        He wasn't, though, and other "Halloween" films followed.  None of
them were anywhere near as successful as these first two outings.  Jamie
Lee Curtis declined to return to the series; therefore, silly new plot
twists were invented, including the introduction of other relatives that
Michael feels the need to dispose of.  John Carpenter, the auteur who
created the series and composed its famous theme song, also called it quits
after two films.  The death of the series was imminent: in subsequent
outings, Dr. Loomis became more and more uninteresting, while the suspense
and tension the first film is so famous for were exchanged for gore.
Sadly, the franchise degenerated into just another bunch of slasher
pictures, no better than the other "copycat" movies which quickly flooded
the market after the success of the first installment.
        I've always thought the series should've given up when Curtis left;
happily, director Steve Miner agrees with me.  The latest installment in the
series, "Halloween: 20 Years Later" is a direct sequel to the first two
films, bringing Jamie Lee Curtis back to the role that began her career
and cheerfully ignoring the other dreadful movies that came out in the
interim.  Kudos, I say!
        The story: Laurie Strode, unable to come to terms with the tragedy
that Michael Myers inflicted upon her, devises a plan to free herself and
reclaim her life.  She fakes her death, changes her name, and moves to
California.  Over the next two decades she gets married, has a son, gets
divorced, and becomes the principal of a fancy private school.  She's a
well-respected community leader, but she still can't shake the demons from
her past.  She sees Michael Myers in every reflection, and has developed a
drug and alcohol problem as her way of dealing with the pressure and her
own questionable sanity.
        Dr. Loomis, her ally from the first two films, has passed away.
In the opening sequence, an intruder breaks into Loomis's empty home and
steals a file containing confidential data on Laurie Strode.  Yes, boys
and girls: it's Michael Myers, determined to find his little sister once
again.
        Offering assistance to Laurie are her son and his friends, plus
Ronnie Jones (LL Cool J), a local security guard/aspiring writer, all of
whom turn in acceptable performances.  (One of the most entertaining comes
from Ronnie's unseen wife, who chats with him constantly on the phone while
he reads her the latest pages of his novel-in-progress.)
        Mr. Miner throws in lots of subtle little touches which suit the
film nicely.  In the original "Halloween," Michael's victims watch "The
Thing" on TV, unaware that a more immediate terror lurks right outside the
living room window.  In "H20," teens watch Ed Wood's "Plan Nine From
Outer Space" ("Your stupid minds!  Stupid, stupid minds!" shouts the
television) and the aforementioned "Scream."  It's a nice tip of the hat
to Kevin Williamson, who also worked on the script (uncredited), no doubt
fulfilling a lifelong dream by doing so.
        Williamson's touch is present throughout, which may be one of the
reasons the film works.  This movie actually feels more like "Scream" than
the later "Halloween" sequels: we have many humorous lines (uncommon even
in the earlier movies), lots of "fake scares" (something Williamson's
earlier movies have thrived on), and of course, the patented "the killer
comes back to life after he's supposed to be dead" trick.  The cliches
occasionally get a bit tedious (do we really need to see the old "the car
won't start when we need to make a quick get-away" gag again?), but by
and large the film knows what to do.  It's not particularly innovative,
but it *is* rock solid.
        Is it perfect?  Hardly.  There are at least two instances in which
the viewer simply must roll his or her eyes good-naturedly at the screen.
One character, who gets all six chambers of a revolver emptied into his
chest, pops up again at the end of the film.  "I'm fine!  The bullets just
grazed me!" he explains.  Uh-huh.  Then why'd you'd bleed all over the
place?  Also, one skeptic who doesn't believe that Myers has really
returned asks: "Why would Michael wait twenty years before seeking revenge
on Laurie?"  An excellent question!  Too bad we never find out the answer.
Both are nitpicks, but they kinda bothered me.
         I loved the photography in this movie.  I'm a sucker for unusual
angles and lighting, and this film does not disappoint.  Like the original
"Halloween," Michael is mainly seen in shadowy profile, giving him an
ethereal quality which suits the film's mood.  The guy's still scary,
you gotta admit.
        The film flies by, thanks to its "to-the-bone" editing.  It runs
a scant 85 minutes (about half as long as "Saving Private Ryan"), making
it one of the shortest non-animated films I've ever seen.  Still,
additional footage would've only slowed its breakneck pace.  I, for one,
approved of its brevity.
        In fact, I have to confess something, and I hope my film-critic
license isn't revoked because of it: I absolutely loved this film.  Jamie
Lee is in top form (and still looks great), the direction is creative, and
the final scene is haunting and satisfying.  (It actually got a hearty
round of applause at the screening I attended.)  Horror films may be a
guilty pleasure for me, but when they're this much fun, who cares?  I felt
like I was 14 again while I was watching.  If I'd only been able to catch
a Mr. Mister tune on the radio after the show, the experience would've
been complete.
        (Oh, and check out the older lady who plays Laurie's receptionist:
yes, it's Janet Leigh!  Not only is she Jamie Lee Curtis's real-life mother,
but she played the shower scene victim in the original "Psycho," too.  How
can any horror fan resist two generations of Scream Queens in the same
movie?)</P>
