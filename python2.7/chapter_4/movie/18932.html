<PRE>THE WINSLOW BOY
Directed by David Mamet
Screenplay by Mamet from the play by Terence Rattigan
With Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon
Grand Illusion      G      110 min</PRE>
<P>     Somebody run a DNA test on David Mamet, and fast!  The expletive-
happy  playwright/filmmaker ("Glengarry, Glen Ross", etc.) has produced
a G-rated movie; the  master of painfully self-conscious pseudo-
naturalistic *dialogue interruptus* has turned  out an eloquent period
drama; and it's marvelous.</P>
<P>Mamet has adapted the Terence Rattigan stage play based on a
celebrated British court  case from the early part of this century.  A
boy is cashiered from military school for  stealing.  His father,
convinced of his son's innocence, fights the case first in the school 
and then in the courts, putting a tremendous strain on his family's
financial and emotional  resources, and catching the imagination of an
enthralled British public.  The boy's  suffragette sister champions his
cause though it wreaks havoc with her private life.   Buttons crop up
all over London, songs are written, cartoonists and editorial writers
opine  in newspapers, and even Parliament is tied up with hot debates on
the merits of the  Winslow Boy's situation.  One of London's leading
barristers takes an interest in his case -- and inevitably, past initial
friction, in his sister as well.</P>
<P>Nigel Hawthorne ("The Madness of King George") delivers an
extraordinary  performance that should once again land him in the thick
of the Oscar race.  His Arthur  Winslow is never quite what you expect. 
Our first impression is of a typically stern  Victorian patriarch, but
he immediately begins extending that character with humor,  shyness,
irony, tenderness, loyalty, and a perseverance that takes a toll on his
health and  family but not on his convictions.</P>
<P>Rebecca Pidgeon, the resident Mrs. Mamet, is Catherine Winslow,
whose  uncompromising dedication to principle has made her a leader in
the battle for women's  rights; when her brother's rights are
compromised, she brings the same cool fire and  perseverance to clearing
his name.  Pidgeon, who made Mamet's stylized dialogue work so  well in
"The Spanish Prisoner", here has a more nuanced character to work with,
and she  takes full advantage.  And there's an equally fine job from
Jeremy Northam ("Emma") as  the great lawyer, a man with the legal mind
of a Clarence Darrow and the dark  handsomeness and tightly controlled
emotional fires of a Heathcliffe.  </P>
<P>The movie is exquisitely lit by cinematographer Benoit Delhomme 
("The Scent of Green Papaya") with a conscious debt to the
contemporaneous American painter John Singer Sargeant.  Mamet's writing
is economical, powerful, and moving, and his direction is controlled and
sure.  He has burnished his characters with such sharp definition that
they move through his atmosphere like planets in the service of an
integrated theory of the universe.  You watch this celestial clockwork
with a profound appreciation of the individual elements, and of the mind
that shaped the whole.           </P>
