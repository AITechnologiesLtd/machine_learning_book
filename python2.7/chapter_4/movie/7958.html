<PRE>                          THE ENGLISH PATIENT
                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas, Juliette Binoche, Willem
Dafoe, Colin Firth, Naveen Andrews, Julian Wadham, Kevin Whately,
Juergen Prochnow Director: Anthony Minghella Producer: Saul Zaentz
Screenplay: Anthony Minghella based
on the novel by Michael Ondaatje Cinematography: John Seale Music:
Gabriel Yared</P>
<P>This movie gave me a neck ache, a backache, a bum ache and a headache. I
took two toilet breaks, waded through two litres of coke (to help me
stay awake) before it finally ended.</P>
<P>I spent 162 minutes of precious time to find out that the 'English
Patient', (Fiennes) was a count who was an adulterer, a traitor and a
murderer; all as a result of his fooling around. He ends up scar-faced
and unrecognisable so we are meant to feel sorry for him.</P>
<P>I don't buy it, but everybody around me did (especially the women all of
whom were snivelling with sympathy).</P>
<P>Perhaps I'm being too hard on him, after all he is a dying man. How
about the 'English woman' (Scott Thomas) who is involved, perhaps she is
of good character and somebody worth saving; but alas, she is a wealthy
snob, who has a loyal, caring husband and I'm beginning to feel sorry
for her already.</P>
<P>The only person that I had any sympathy for in the entire movie was the
husband who was cheated on. Perhaps he shouldn't have crashed the plane,
but sealed the 'English patient' and the 'English woman' up in that
lovely cave to give their romance some time to chill.</P>
<P>This movie is undoubtedly the con artist film of 1996. It conned the
audiences, the critics and the Academy Awards, all of whom failed to see
that it is nothing more than a glamorised story of two uninteresting,
English aristocrats.</P>
<P>The scenery and cinematography is undoubtedly spectacular, and the lull
of the soundtrack will reduce you to tears.</P>
<P>Comment: Get rid of Fiennes and Scott Thomas, bring in Garbo and
Valentino. Then perhaps the screen will start to sizzle.</P>
