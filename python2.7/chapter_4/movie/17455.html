<P>   This item appeared in the Associated Press on March
24...PIESON, Fla. (AP) - School officials reversed their
decision and will allow a teen-age boy to attend his high
school prom in drag.  Charles Rice plans to wear a red, floor-
length evening gown, red satin shoes, gloves and matching
rhinestone jewelry to Saturday's prom.  Taylor High School
Principal Peter Oatman changed his mind after conferring
with attorneys.  "I should have the freedom to express
myself," said the 18-year-old senior, who is gay.</P>
<P>   Good for the kid, and good for the principal who avoided an
inevitable, losing court fight!  The young men in American
high schools who would love to wear gowns to their proms
would not have the courage (and perhaps bad sense) to do
what this boy did, so we should not expect most gay young
men in upper-middle-class suburban English schools to dress
in drag either.  The central character of "Get Real," a well-
written, richly photographed film under the spirited direction of
Simon Shore, has no intention of being so audacious.  All he
wants is to be respected for what he is: a quiet, gay person,
with the right simply to be seen in public with a male lover if
he so chooses.  He does not want to be harassed or beaten
to a pulp simply because of his sexual orientation.  "Get
Real" is as British a film as "Jawbreaker" and "Waterboy" are
American high-school stories.  Like other English takes on
school life such as "The Winslow Boy" and "The Browning
Version" and "Quartermaine's Terms," nobody is stuffed into
the trunk of a car, nor is anyone scraped off the ceiling.  "Get
Real" is a compassionate, delicate narrative about a 16-year-
old in a reputable school who feels himself an outsider not
because he is gay, but because he must dishonesty portray
himself as straight to his parents and his schoolmates.  The
subtext--one which, I feel, is not a valid one despite the
writer's own feeling on the matter--is that a homosexual who
comes out of the closet will inevitably feel more comfortable
with himself and his surroundings.</P>
<P>   The story focuses on Steven Carter (Ben Silverstone), a
16-year-old attending a public (that is, a private) academy in
the wealthy English suburb of Basingstoke--itself unusual in
that the film breaks away from the current fashion for
working-class tales from the sceptered like "Twenty-four
Seven" and "Carla's Song."  Steven's parents seem in the
dark about their boy's sexual orientation, and while some of
the toughs in the school bother him and call him a queer, we
suspect they do so only because Steven is a delicate sort of
lad.  Steven is astonished when the school jock, John Dixon
(Brad Gordon), makes a play for him.  Dixon is adamant
about covering up his own orientation.  He dates a leggy
model, is a star athlete, and has every girl in the school
drooling.  Since only Steven's best friend, the plump and
sharp-tongued Linda (Charlotte Brittain), is aware of his
feelings, the lovely Jessica (Stacy A. Hart) wonders why
Steven rebuffs the advances she is making on the young
man.  Ultimately the dilemma is resolved at an awards
assembly program, at which point Steven lets it all hang out,
so to speak.</P>
<P>   While this is the sort of story that could have come from
the pen of early Oscar Wilde, the movie is actually based on
a play by Patrick Wilde, "What's Wrong With Angry?" 
Director Simon Shore has successfully opened the staged
drama to include some strikingly pretty photographs of the
English countryside.  His cinematographer, Alan Almond,
captures the environs of a fairly swanky school, where the
youngsters wear blazers and ties while some of the teachers
dress like urban American instructors.  Among the scenes
that capture the ambience of this privileged institution is one
taking place in an English class in which a 16-year-old girl
beautifully reads a section from "Romeo and Juliet" followed
by an active class discussion.  Significantly, the English
teacher (Richard Hawley) queries his small group about
whether they think Juliet should tell her parents about her
secret marriage to Romeo.</P>
<P>   While the tone of the story is a serious one, "Get Real" is
peppered with double-entendres, as when John offers Steven
a cigarette: "Fag?"  When John follows up with "filthy habit,"
Steven assumes that he means homosexuality, not smoking. 
There is a cute scene that introduces us to how Steven and
John initially form their liaison, one which takes place in a
park bathroom.</P>
<P>   If the conclusion is too pat--Steven's mother (Jacquetta
May) doing the obligatory "I'm-proud-of-my-gay-son" shtick,
the film as a whole is involving, one which succeeds not only
as entertainment but could be used as a primer for kids even
on the junior high school level to teach toleration and, even
better, acceptance of those whose ways of thinking less
popular. "Get Real" was screened at the Edinburgh Film
Festival where it won the Audience Award in 1998 and was
selected for the 1998 Toronto Festival and at Sundance in
1999.</P>
