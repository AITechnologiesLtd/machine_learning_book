<P>Tell me if this doesn't sound wonderful to you: You're a billionaire and
despite your age, you have a young, gorgeous model for your wife. When it
comes time for a photo shoot, you accompany your lovely bride, on your own
private plane mind you, to a beautiful, forest clad region complete with a
lake, snow capped mountains, and a cozy little cabin to sleep in.
Paradisiacal, eh? Oh, I just forgot to mention one thing . . . during an
excursion, your plane goes down and you're stuck fighting for your life in the
middle of the woods. Ok, not so great after all.</P>
<P>This is the plot for THE EDGE, an adventure/thriller written by David Mamet
and directed by Lee Tamahori. The billionaire is Charles Morse, played like a
perfect blend of Daddy Warbucks, MacGyver, and Grizzly Adams. The beautiful
wife is Mickey, played by Elle MacPherson in an essentially non-existent role.
In fact, the real purpose behind the character of Mickey is to allow for a
conflict between Morse and Robert Green (Alec Baldwin), Mickey's photographer
who just happens to go down along with Charles and the plane. Just before the
plane flies into a flock of migrating birds and crashes into the water below,
Charles confronts "Bob" about his true feelings for Mickey. In fact, the
aerial collision is cued with Charles asking Bob, "How do you plan to kill
me?"</P>
<P>The pilot dies and Charles, Bob, and Bob's assistant Stephen (Harold Perrineau
Jr.) are left to fend for themselves in a cold, aboriginal climate. Through
all this, Charles manages to keep his calm, which is more of an aggravation
than a comfort to Bob and Stephen. Nonetheless, they trust in Charles'
seemingly omnipotent understanding of life, nature, and the outdoors and
follow him thru the maze of trees in an attempt to rescue themselves (all the
while continuously confronting an overly persistent bear).</P>
<P>Reading a summary of THE EDGE would surely make one want to see the film. It
*sounds* rich, intriguing, exciting, and suspenseful. But with shotty
direction and dialogue that trudges along like dead weight, you're
expectations will quickly be dashed. In fact, if you have any sense, you might
just walk out of the theater within the first twenty minutes of the show -
it's that bad. Thankfully, if you do stick it out, it manages to pick up into
a semi-mediocre film after about thirty or so anaesthetic minutes.</P>
<P>The actors can't quite be blamed here. Although the characters are pretty
deadpan (special notice going to the trite, uneven Bob Green role), the
director seems more at fault. Tamahori doesn't seem to know where to take this
and winds up with only sporadic moments of intensity. Keep in mind, however,
that the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith wants you to feel that adrenaline
kick over the slightest things. It gets very tiring.</P>
<P>The only saving grace THE EDGE has to offer are some spectacular shots of
Canada, where it was filmed. There are some fabulous, breathtaking views of
Mother Nature's handiwork, but sadly it doesn't make this film worth sitting
through. If you still feel determined to see this one, please try to catch it
on the big screen before it's "reformatted" to fit the little one. If you
don't have the beautiful landscapes to appreciate in this movie, you'll have
nothing at all.</P>
