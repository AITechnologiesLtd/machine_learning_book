<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Stefan Ruzowitzky's film is an ominous parable set in the 1930s in an
Austrian village. The story centers on the mysterious death of a mean
and stingy landowner and his unusual last will. His land will be given
to the peasants to share and their peasant status will be elevated to
farmers (land owner). The farmer does this because he hates everyone,
including the church which expected to inherit the farm, and since he
has no family he mischievously leaves it to the peasants who worked for
him. He expects that they hate each other so much and can't work
together, that they will kill each other off.</P>
<P>It soon turns out that there is no mystery about who brutally killed the
farmer Hillinger, it is a silent peasant woman who remains by the
chicken coops. She was a virgin raped by Hillinger a number of years ago
and when she went to the police for help, she was framed by the farmer
who put a stolen brooch in her trunk and had her arrested for theft. She
became pregnant from that rape and gave birth to an idiot child called
Lukas (Schwarz). He was raised on the farm as a peasant and was blessed
with a happy-go-lucky disposition, but not knowing who his parents were
or where he came from. He tried to be friendly with everyone. The only
one who knew the secret, was the old peasant woman, Alte Nane (Julia),
who never told anyone else.</P>
<P>The hated foreman (Tilo) who used to beat the peasants regularly and
treat them with undue cruelty, refuses to go along with the seven others
who plan to work the farm and own something for once in their life,
after an offer by a rich farmer, Danniger (Wildgruber), to buy the place
well below its worth is refused. The battle becomes a class struggle
between the church, which sides with the landed citizens, and the town
farmers, against these new one-seventh farmers.</P>
<P>When the new farmers do better than expected and bring in a good
harvest, the established farmers, led by the particularly vindicative
Danniger, who is afraid of them succeeding and what it would mean to all
the other peasants in the territory, gets the city fathers to charge the
farm a high inheritance tax; when that fails as the peasants make the
payment, they resort to beating up the stableboy, killing a cow,
harassing them while working, and eventually to the most fatal incident
in the story, of burning down some of the farm buildings and forcing
Lukas to fight back to defend himself. That event leads Lukas to kill
the foreman and go on the run.</P>
<P>The film highlights the interactions of the likable but weakminded Lukas
and the vibrant Emmy (Sophie Rois) to tell its sad tale. Lukas loves
Emmy, romancing her freely, but things change when they have all the
responsibilities of running the farm and she is forced to become the
leader for the group, displaying a flashing temper at all the injustice
done to them. At first, the new farmers were confused about what to do
but soon were determined to succeeed, to put aside their differences and
work together.</P>
<P>It is a dark morality tale, excitingly shot, about the powerful ones
acting petty and cruel, while the peasants act with dignity and courage.
Ruzowitzky's film throws out many political ideas, gives one a true
sense of what collective hatred and what class warfare are like. The
film has many different moods to it: ranging from dark comedy to
free-spirited romance to bitter violence. It tells how a nonviolent soul
could suddely become a hunted man for murder. It is a well-made film; it
clearly shows how injustice is part of a system that enslaves people.</P>
