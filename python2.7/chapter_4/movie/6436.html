<PRE>                         A SINGLE GIRL
                A film review by Bryant Frazer
                 Copyright 1996 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<PRE>                                   Directed by Benoit Jacquot
                       Written by Jacquot and Jerome Beaujour
                              Cinematography by Roger Arpajou
                                   Edited by Pascale Chavance
                                    Starring Virginie Ledoyen
                                                France, 1995</PRE>

<P>The shot I remember best from A Single Girl is of Virginie
Ledoyen's face in profile, nearly filling the screen as she
changes her clothes. The camera watches from across the room
as Ledoyen pulls off her shirt, but then cuts respectfully to
the close shot, granting her modesty but never looking away.
The movie has a confidence in this lovely face, a conviction
that sometimes, it's enough for us to simply *watch.*</P>
<P>It's true -- Ledoyen's face is something to see, and her
nearly prim, perfectly composed presence helps move the film.
Equally propulsive is the tension generated as director
Benoit Jacquot steadicams his way into elevators, down
hallways, and through the portals of guest rooms at a Paris
hotel. The brilliance of A Single Girl is its elevation of
daily routine and its careful exploitation of voyeurism. When
the movie really works, we're following Ledoyen around in
real time, as she learns her trade as a room service worker.
When it doesn't work, it's because the film is busily
justifying its own existence, as in a framing device
involving two conversations between Valerie and her
boyfriend.</P>
<P>Those conversations are key to the film, because they set up
the conflict inside Valerie's head as she goes through the
motions of her first day on the job. On her way to work, she
tells her boyfriend that she's pregnant. She has to leave
right away, but promises that she'll find a way to come back
in an hour, if he'll wait. Naturally, he does, and what she
tells him then is sort of a foregone conclusion -- but she's
plenty introspective as she walks the halls, crossing into
the private lives of hotel guests and assessing the politics
of the workplace.</P>
<P>A young Russian director once became famous for what's known
as "the Kuleshov effect." As part of a series of
investigations into the nature of film editing, Lev Kuleshov
took raw footage of actor Ivan Mozhukhin's face and intercut
it with unrelated images -- a bowl of soup, a child in a
coffin, and a child playing with toys. Shown the footage with
no introduction, audiences praised the actor's sensitive
portrayals of hunger, grief, and joy. The joke, of course,
was on them, since no such "portrayal" ever existed on screen
or even in the actor's mind -- the emotion was created by the
audience (and herein may lie the key to many a great
performance).</P>
<P>I'm not suggesting that A Single Girl plays similar editing
tricks. As a matter of fact, the edits are painstakingly
naturalistic, necessarily preserving the "real time"
progression of the filmed events. But the whole film may be a
sort of a trick. Given the information that Valerie is
pregnant, we viewers can then project our own imagined
doubts, anxieties, and frustrations onto Ledoyen's largely
emotionless face. Perhaps this is a partial explanation of
the nearly universal raves Ledoyen has been receiving for
this role -- truly, what we "see" up on screen is essentially
a projection of ourselves, the ways that we might experience
a similar life crisis, onto a comfortably beautiful human
specimen.</P>
<P>This is not to diminish anyone's estimation of her talent,
since it's hard to overestimate the value of comfortable
beauty in the cinema -- pundits are claiming that this film's
audiences are witness to the rise of one of the next great
stars of French cinema, and I have no reason to doubt those
assertions. Any young actor should be so lucky as to get this
kind of role. Ledoyen seemed similarly aloof in Oliver
Assayas' excellent Cold Water (which never received a U.S.
release), but in that film she was a world-ravaged enigma,
nearly untouchable. Here, we're encouraged to get up close.</P>
<P>What's really terrific about A Single Girl is its simplicity.
Except for a lengthy, misguided coda, this is compelling in
the best way -- it's nearly guerilla filmmaking. When the
camera follows Ledoyen as she charges down Paris sidewalks,
bystanders get out of her way, gaping quizzically at the
camera -- Jacquot and company didn't even have the luxury of
roping off the streets before shooting their exteriors.
Seat-of-your-pants filmmaking is almost by definition a labor
of love, and such is the crazy energy of the bond between
filmmaker and performer that everyone else in the wide world
just bounces off of Ledoyen as she gets from point A to point
B. It is indeed a pleasure just to watch.</P>
