<P>     The death of his mother has been hard on Mark (Elijah Wood).  In
fact, as she lay on her deathbed, he promised her that he wouldn't let
her die--a promise that he couldn't keep.  Now, only a short time
after the tragedy, Mark's father (David Morse) has to jet off to Tokyo
to close a business deal, and Mark must spend his winter break with the
family of his uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly).  While at first the
prospect of two weeks in Maine is less than enticing, Mark loses much
of his reticence once he meets the people he'll be staying with, taking
an instant liking to his aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson), cousin Connie
(Quinn Culkin), and especially cousin Henry (Macaulay Culkin).
However, after an enjoyable first few days spent mostly in the company
of Henry, Mark comes to learn that his cousin has a dark and violent
streak that is becoming increasingly more twisted, and that it's only a
matter of time before someone dies--if they haven't already.</P>
<P>     The producers took a big chance in casting the youthful star of
HOME ALONE as the demonic child in THE GOOD SON.  Would Macaulay Culkin
fill the bill?  Could he fulfill the promise of his multi-million
dollar contract and turn in a sinister performance as a truly evil
twelve-year old masquerading as an angel?  The answer, in a word, is
no.</P>
<P>     Casting actors against type is always a risky proposition.  When
it works, the dividends are often huge, but when it fails, the movie
usually goes under.  Such is the case with THE GOOD SON.  Few are less
likely to play a conscienceless, nasty-minded boy than the lively
Culkin, and when he tries, he does a horrendous job.  Henry comes
across as a one-dimensional, boring kid who has nothing better to do
with his time than shoot bolts at animals, smoke cigarettes, cause
ten-car pileups, and tell damaging lies about people who annoy him.</P>
<P>     Elijah Wood, who did a solid job in Disney's newest ADVENTURES OF
HUCK FINN, is better than Culkin--but not by much.  There's something
not right about Mark.  He comes across more like a written character
than a real child, and Wood is unable to bridge the gap.  A few of
Mark's scenes ring true, but at least as many are overly-melodramatic
and acted with a distinct lack of inspiration.</P>
<P>     The plot itself is rather unimpressive, telling the story of a
psychotic pre-teen.  There are a number of fascinating psychological
issues that could have been exploited, but were left untouched in favor
of presenting a straightforward thriller.  For example, we get precious
little motivation for Henry's actions.  There are a couple of
throw-away lines that explain one incident, but say little about
everything else.</P>
<P>     The movie makes a few futile attempts to use Mark's guilt about
his mother's death as a plot device, but it keeps getting in the way of
the overall story.  Part of the problem may be that the guilt and grief
are never well-presented, and it's difficult to understand why Mark
comes to believe that his aunt is somehow the reincarnation of his
mother, whose dying words to him were that she would be with him
forever.  If anything, this element makes THE GOOD SON even less
believable than it already is.</P>
<P>     The ending of the movie is actually clever, which is a surprise
given the routine conclusions to so many thrillers, but those few good
minutes do not save the movie.  It's far more difficult for a bad
motion picture to be redeemed by a strong last scene than it is for a
good film to be ruined by a dumb finale.</P>
<P>     I'm a little surprised and disappointed that director Joseph Ruben
has turned out such a lackluster production (although this isn't his
first miss--witness SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, a pedestrian movie if
there ever was one).  Ruben, whose 1987 sleeper THE STEPFATHER was one
of the decade's best thrillers, has, in THE GOOD SON, ignored
everything that made that earlier film work:  a tight script, excellent
atmosphere, and solid characterization.</P>
<P>     From the red-clay backdrops of Nevada to the frosty winterscapes
of New England, THE GOOD SON is beautifully photographed (by
cinematographer John Lindley), but that's one of its few positive
points.  Not many people enjoy going to the movies just to see pretty
nature scenes, but that's just about the only reason for taking a trip
to the theaters for THE GOOD SON.  Those expecting a good scare would
do better to look elsewhere.  At best, this is strictly cable fare.</P>
