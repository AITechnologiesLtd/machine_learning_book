<PRE>SWIMMING WITH SHARKS</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * * 1/2</PRE>

Written by: George Huang</PRE>
<P>Guy (Frank Whaley) is an aspiring writer who just landed the job of his 
dreams. He's going to be working for one of the biggest executives in 
show-biz, Buddy Ackerman (Kevin Spacey). As Buddy's personal assistant, Guy 
will have the opportunity to go on to bigger and better things in time, as 
all of Buddy's previous assistants have done (one is directing all the 
Macaulay Culkin action pictures). Yep, Guy is certain that all his dreams 
are about to come true. Too bad for him, he's actually gone to hell. Buddy 
turns out to be the most evil, vicious boss ever to walk the planet, and 
Guy's life quickly becomes like that stuff you find underneath your toe 
nails. The only thing he has left is his relationship with Dawn Lockhart 
(Michelle Forbes), a producer who often works with Buddy. Then, after a year 
of dealing with Buddy's demands, something finally causes Guy to snap. One 
evening he enters Buddy's home, takes Buddy's gun from its secret hiding 
place, ties him up, and proceeds to make him pay for every insult and 
offense of the past year.</P>
<P>Make no mistake, "Swimming With Sharks" is one vicious little movie. It's 
the kind of film designed only for those people who like their humor black 
and bitter. If you're going in expecting a cute little story about a young 
guy trying to make it in Hollywood, you're in for quite a surprise. You have 
to not only be able to handle people acting in an appallingly base manner, 
but you have to be able to find it funny. If you can't do that, avoid this 
film like you'd avoid "Home Alone 4" (knock on wood that that never comes to 
be). Here's a quick quiz to see whether or not you'd enjoy the movie. Number 
one, do you find a man getting pencils, file folders, pens, and paper clips 
thrown at him while his boss mocks him to be funny? Two, do you find the 
thought of a man getting reemed by his boss for not knowing the difference 
between Sweet-N-Low and Equal funny? Three, do you find the thought of a man 
being tortured in various ingenious ways by his assistant to be repulsive? 
If you answered no to either of the first two questions, you might want to 
consider giving this one a miss. If you answered yes to the last question, 
definitely give this one a miss and go rent the latest Meg Ryan / Tom Hanks 
romantic comedy.</P>
<P>A lot of what makes the film so funny is the excellent cast. What makes this 
feat even more amazing is that the film is carried by only three actors. 
First up we have Frank Whaley ("Pulp Fiction"), playing a guy who bounces 
back and forth from being sympathetic, to being flat-out annoying. Whaley 
does an excellent job never letting the character fall too far into either 
of these categories. Whenever Guy gets to be too much of a schmuck, he gets 
reigned in to the point where we start disliking him as much as we dislike 
Buddy (okay, maybe not that much). Next up is Michelle Forbes (Ensign Ro 
from Star Trek: The Next Generation), playing a woman who is good at giving 
orders, but doesn't seem to know what she really wants. I found it rather 
amusing that she asks Guy that question at one point, but we get the 
impression throughout the film that she isn't too sure what she's looking 
for either, bouncing from one man to another. Forbes does give a good 
performance, but she isn't given quite enough screen time. Last is Kevin 
Spacey ("American Beauty"), and were the film pure garbage, his performance 
alone would make it worth seeing. Never before have I seen a man walk the 
fine line between overacting and playing a character as a true monster so 
nimbly. He doesn't falter once, and I'll say just this. While his first 
Oscar may say it's for "The Usual Suspects", I can't help but think the 
Academy members were really thinking of his performance here. Benicio Del 
Toro ("The Usual Suspects") also makes a brief, but excellent, appearance as 
Buddy's former assistant.</P>
<P>An interesting thing happened to me while watching "Swimming With Sharks" 
for the first time. When the film first started I was laughing like an idiot 
every few minutes. Yet as it progressed, I laughed less and less. By the 
time the final third of the film hit I realized I wasn't laughing at all, 
and hadn't been for awhile now. Does the movie run out of laughs? Well, in a 
way, yes. However, I don't think that really does justice to what happened. 
Instead, the film slowly changes into something else entirely. What starts 
off as a string of brilliant comic moments changes into a more involving 
story about how cutthroat Hollywood really is. This is the debut film of 
George Huang, who actually worked as an assistant for a major Hollywood 
producer. Word has it he actually went through some of the horrors captured 
here, and it's no surprise that his script is tinged with just a touch of 
bitterness. For a first time writer/director, Huang proves remarkably adept 
behind the camera. His direction is astute, and his script has just the 
right blend of comedy and shocks.</P>
<P>While the flashbacks to Guy's life as an assistant are certainly funny, the 
real brilliance of the film is in the torture scenes. No, I don't mean the 
torture itself is brilliant (although it is quite imaginative), I mean the 
dialogue between Guy and Buddy is brilliant. Watching Buddy slowly turn the 
tables on Guy is astonishing because it's actually believable. Buddy is just 
the sort of man who could torture his torturer by pointing out his flaws. 
Guy, on the other hand, is just the sort of man who would be devastated by 
these flaws being made clear to him. The finale to this little exchange 
first struck me as contrived, but after watching it for a second time I 
realized it made perfect sense. I won't say how it all ends here of course, 
but if you watch the film, do one thing; before you brush the end off as I 
did, really think about what each characters says, and you'll notice a 
wonderfully hidden double meaning to everything being said. One final thing 
I want to note is the soundtrack. It really features only one instrumental 
piece by composer Tom Hiel being played over and over during key scenes. 
It's a great piece, but I wish Hiel had written more so I could get a 
soundtrack. "Swimming With Sharks" runs a decent 101 minutes. I'd recommend 
it to fans of Kevin Spacey and to those who love their comedy black as 
pitch. I give it four and a half out of five stars.</P>
