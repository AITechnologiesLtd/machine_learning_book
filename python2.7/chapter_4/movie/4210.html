<P>     In the new thriller COPYCAT, Sigourney Weaver plays Helen Hunter,
a criminal psychologist whose specialty is serial killers.  That is,
whose specialty *was*.  She's since retired, after an attack thirteen
months ago left her an agoraphobic alcoholic.  (She can't leave her
heavily-reinforced home without a drink and a panic attack, and not
necessarily in that order.)  Into Helen's protected world steps a
diminutive detective (*Holly* Hunter), who needs her help in solving a
string of brutal murders.  (Is there any other kind?)  As it turns out,
there's another demented, young white male on the loose.  Except this
one is imitating the most infamous killers in history.</P>
<P>     Sitting-duck slasher pics don't come much more effective than
this.  Directory Jon Amiel (SOMMERSBY) keeps twisting the screws,
combining a stalker's POV in almost every other shot, with plenty of
throbbing music, and gratuitous scenes of the killer planning his
crimes.  (Ladies, please trim your fingernails before attending with
your dates.)  All very effective devices that are dressed-up
considerably by screenwriters Ann Bidermand and David Madsen.  Their
story is intelligent, though way too overplotted to be logical.**  The
psychology adds up okay, even if this is really just a big boo-house at
heart.  Where SEVEN was stylish, COPYCAT is shameless.  Where MANHUNTER
was moody, COPYCAT is manipulative.  And so on.</P>
<P>     The casting is choice.  After three ALIEN bug-hunts, Sigourney
Weaver certainly can play peril.  Her foil, Holly Hunter, is
surprisingly effective, despite her small size and smaller voice.
"Have the mice stopped screaming, Clarice?"  The partner is played a
solid Dermot Mulroney.  (Together, they patrol the streets of San
Francisco as "Monahan and Getz."  Such great cop names!)  In a
substantially smaller role, Harry Connick Jr. is a hoot as a backwoods
bad guy whose resemblance to Jim Varney suggests the title for the
inevitable sequel:  ERNEST GOES A-KILLIN'.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
<P>**- The audience has too much time to wonder about such things as why   
    Weaver's character doesn't own a gun.  Or, where and on what 
    planet did she find such a fast modem for her computer?  Or, if 
    anybody else thinks that Weaver could pass for Hugh Grant's older 
    sister?</P>
