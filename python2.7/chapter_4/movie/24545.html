<PRE>SMALL TIME CROOKS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Heeeeeeeee's back!  Woody Allen plays a vintage Woody Allen character
resurrected from his films of old in SMALL TIME CROOKS, a movie which he
also wrote and directed.  It is the starring role in the type of silly
comedies that first made him famous.  This one isn't in the same league
as the classic Woody comedies, which it mimics, but it is a pleasant
little movie that's as easy to listen to as Woody's signature jazz
scoring.</P>
<P>His script proves better than its delivery perhaps because the actors
seem a bit tired, like vaudevillians who've done the same routine so
often that they've lost their edge.</P>
<P>"What would you say if I told you that you were married to a very
brilliant man?" Ray (Allen) asks his wife, Frenchy (Tracey Ullman).
"I'd say, I'd have to be a bigamist!" she shoots back.  Frenchy is an
ex-exotic dancer, and Ray is an ex-con who currently makes a living as a
dishwasher while he plans a big heist.  Neither of them excels in brains
or class.</P>
<P>The movie's brief first act concerns the activities of Ray and his
cronies as they plan to tunnel under an old pizza shop in order to rob
the bank a couple of stores down.  As a cover operation, Frenchy turns
the pizza joint into a cookie shop.  The crime goes bust, but Frenchy's
cookies are such a big hit that she's vaulted into stardom as a "cookie
mogul."  Her empire is known as Sunset Farms, which she, Ray and his
two-bit crooks run on autopilot.  The rest of the movie revolves around
her attempts to get class and Ray's attempts to shun it like the plague.</P>
<P>With their newfound wealth they turn their lavish, new Manhattan
apartment into a garish imitation of a bad bordello with more gold than
Fort Knox.  Their home, Frenchy brags, has a rug with fiber optics that
light up in order to create just the right ambiance.  And their
outlandish outfits match the decor perfectly.</P>
<P>Clearly they need help, so they turn to
Wall-Street-broker-turned-art-dealer David (Hugh Grant).  Giving him
some hint as to her tastes, Frenchy says that she likes, "Rembrandt,
Michelangelo, Picasso -- you know, the boys."  David, somewhat
reluctantly, agrees to conduct a cultural crash course for them.  Ray
hates the idea.  "My idea of a good time is not opera and ruins," says
Ray.  "I get enough sleep at home."</P>
<P>In a direct parallel with Woody himself, Ray has quite simple needs.  He
just wants people to laugh at his jokes.  But when he tries them on his
sophisticated new acquaintances ("Have you heard of the Polish car pool?
Every day they meet at work."), they just stare at him without laughing
or even blinking an eye.</P>
<P>Eventually the movie ends as much because it just runs out of steam as
because the plot has reached its predictable conclusion.  Although it
has a few nice laughs, the movie never rises above forgettable fluff.
If you want to see the real thing, rather than this pale imitation, just
rent some of Woody's early pictures and savor what he once was capable
of creating.</P>
<P>SMALL TIME CROOKS runs 1:35.  It is rated PG for mild language and
innuendo and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up.</P>
