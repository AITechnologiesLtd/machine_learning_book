<PRE>rated R
MGM Pictures
113 minutes

Dunaway, Ben Gazzara
based on the story by Alan R. Trustman
written by Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer
directed by John McTiernan</PRE>
<P>John McTiernan's "The Thomas Crown Affair" is a predictable, overly familiar
remake of the Steve
McQueen/Faye Dunaway romance caper. Pierce Brosnan is Thomas Crown, a
billionaire who also
lies to steal fine art. When a valuable piece is missing from the New York
Museum of Modern Art,
ins urance bounty hunter Katherine(Rene Russo) must investigate Crown, and
ends up falling into a
passionate love affair with the man whom she knows is guilty. The plot
sounds a lot like
"Entrapment", with Sean Connery, but the acting in "Thomas Crown" is better.
Pierce Brosnan has
always annoyed me, playing the same role over and over, but this is that
role and he does fine with it.
Rene Russo is back on screen and looking better than ever; she also hasn't
lost her tough-girl act,
which is fine with me. However, this film is lacking a good script as well
as anything fresh or new, so
as a result it's not much fun. Also, while some elements of "The Thomas
Crown Affair" are
well-made, John McTiernan("Die Hard") pays little attention to details, so
the film should have gone
through one more edit. Where "The Thomas Crown Affair" should be slick and
smooth, it's glib and
rough. You're better off sticking with the original.</P>
