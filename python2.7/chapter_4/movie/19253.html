<P>Not since Animal Farm has a story been so important to its time.  Not since
Animal Farm has a story used such intellectual satire.  In the way that Animal
Farm portrayed our governments, South Park portrays our current day society and
does it well.  The people that complain about south park are missing out in its
hidden messages of parenthood and childhood.</P>
<P>People may complain about the vulgarity of the senseless violence in South
Park. But you must admit, if they are complaining about the movie then they
have obviously noticed it.  Maybe even seen it.  There are some movies that
need to be seen twice, once just to see and twice to analyse, this is one of
those movies.  This movie gets another thing straight too, kids aren't these
sweet angels that they seem to be, deep inside even the nicest kid is a bastard
lurking to come out, this movies jus has the guts to say so.</P>
<P>I applaud Trey Parker and Matt Stone for making this movie.  So what if you
don't think its funny, then don't see it.  If your offended, then don't take it
so seriously.  Every once in a while we need an alternative to seriousness and
this movies gives us one.  It allows us to laugh guilt free at some of the most
controversial topics in our modern society.  If you've read this far in my
review than I thank you for listening to me and I hope that you agree with me. 
I definately reccommend watching South Park at least once, there hasn't been
anything this funny in a long time.</P>
