<P>   One of the best ways a director has of creating tension is
subtly to give the audience the uncomfortable feeling that
something is about to happen.  In horror movies, the
convention calls for creating a series of false moves, of
positioning a look at a threatening arm or the sound of a
creaking door only to resolve the tension with a harmless
gesture.  "The Boys," billed by one writer as "a thinking man's
horror film," does not display the bait and switch technique of
conventional tales of the genre.  Instead, Stephen Sewell's
script, based on a successful play written by Gordon Graham,
is a psychological study of a dysfunctional family with only a
modicum of physical violence but one which seeks to give the
audience a feeling of tautness.  We spend a good deal of
time in our seats wondering when the lead male will explode
and what effect he will have on his brothers, his mother, and
the women in this household in a working-class district of
West Sydney, Australia.</P>
<P>   The characters speak with heavy Australian accents, giving
the marketers a primary target in their own country but
making us wonder whether it can travel the long distance to
rivet an audience in the U.S. or most other English-speaking
countries.  The most prominent flaw is that despite some
fancy camerawork (especially considering its limited budget
and five-week screening time), its origin as a staged play is
obvious.  The stage is the best place for a largely enclosed
story, one which centers on a single household with outside
scenes filmed in more or less a contrived way to open the
narrative cinematically.  Though we see vistas of a prison, a
convenience store, and some of Sydney's less fashionable
streets, "The Boys" is not suited for the big screen.  Director
Rowan Woods has, however, assembled a fine group of
performers, with Toni Collette (from "Muriel's Wedding") the
one most likely to be recognized by an American audience.</P>
<P>   Essentially the picture is about Brett Sprague (David
Wenham), one of three layabout brothers, who has just
emerged from a one-year sentence in prison for assault with
a deadly weapon.  His sibs had not visited him during that
time and now he is fuming with rage and their disregard for
him. That's not all.  He is certain that his brother ripped off a
cache of drugs, is annoyed that his youngest brother Stevie
(Anthony Hayes) has moved into his bedroom with his
pregnant, waif-like girlfriend Nola (Anna Lisse), and disgusted
that his middle brother Glenn (John Polson) has married a
woman he dislikes (Jeanette Cronin).  Strangely indifferent
toward restoring his relationship with his lusty girl friend
Michelle (Toni Collette), he moves to re-establish himself as
the alpha male of the family.  How he manipulates those
around him, eventually driving away the women--including
Michelle, who in one unfortunate incident is undiplomatic
enough to challenge her man's virility--is the principal aim of
the film.</P>
<P>   Looking at the family from the point of view of the mother,
Sandra (Lynette Curran), could give anyone pause before
deciding to have children at all.  Contemptuous of her
husband who had given her virtually nothing during their brief
marriage, she is perpetually on edge trying to provide for a
bunch of beer-drinking slackers and the women friends who
are either living in the house or hanging about it.  As the
boys drive about the locale, they contemplate crimes while
Rowan Woods's hand-held and tripod cameras move forward
and backward in time to give the audience a non-narrative
perspective on these essentially bad boys.  </P>
<P>   Those moviegoers who raved about "The Blair Witch
Project" might just buy into "The Boys."  After all, the
emphasis is on the tension, not the actual displays of
violence.  We wonder what is going to happen next.  We
might feel great sympathy for a harried mother who must feel
from time to time like Medea.  Perhaps Woods should be
applauded for using techniques so box-office effective with
the "Blair" team, but "The Boys" still comes across as a static
work unsuited for a medium larger than the stage and one
requiring subtitles for all but an Australian audience.</P>
