<PRE>The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 70</PRE>
<P>"The Lives of a Bengal Lancer" is an interesting action
film set in British-controlled India.  While the drama
centering around young Richard Cromwell's inability to
please his crusty father is overplayed, and the British
goal of subjegating the Indian populace not exactly
laudable, the dialogue and teasing competitiveness between
Gary Cooper and Franchot Tone is entertaining.</P>
<P>"The Lives of a Bengal Lancer" was directed by Henry
Hathaway and was based on a novel by Major Yeats-Brown.
Cooper stars as a British soldier eager to fight a
fortified Indian village.  His impulsiveness is opposed
by Sir Guy Standing, who prefers laying siege.  Cooper
is soon joined by young recruits Tone and Cromwell.
Cromwell is the hapless son of Standing, who opposes his
son's presence and refuses to give him any special treatment.
Will Cromwell win his father's love and respect? Will
the British flag wave triumphant over the 'rebel' village?</P>
<P>"Bengal Lancer" made a big splash, and the Academy nominated
the film for Best Picture and Best Director, as well as
lesser technical awards.  Time has not been kind to the
movie's depiction of silent, toadying Indians under British
rule.  Another flaw is that Cooper, Tone and Cromwell
often seem to be the only three soldiers in the army.
Still, the atmosphere of Colonial India is captured,
and the heroic battle scenes in the finale are rousing
albeit heavy-handed.</P>
<P>My favorite moment from the film has Cooper and Tone
in an Indian prison cell, whiling away boredom betting
thousands of non-existent rupees on cockroach races.
The cockroaches are named after the British and Indian
commanders.</P>
