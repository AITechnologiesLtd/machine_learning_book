<P>The love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man's
life, especially for those who have fostered their family under
precarious circumstances. Thematically in cinema, love for family has
been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects
of characters; it is rare, however, for it to develop as outstandingly
as it does in Roberto Benigni's neo-classic drama, LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL.
Through a central cast of father, mother, and son, Benigni demonstrates
the wonderful, undying love that a family shares in the best of times
and the worst of times. </P>
<P>Life *is* beautiful for Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni, directing
himself here for the sixth time in his career), an Italian Jew, master
con man, and aspiring waiter extraordinaire. Living in 1930's Italy, he
lives a carefree life of good fortune; it is made even better when he
happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named Dora (Nicoletta Braschi).
Although Dora is already engaged, Guido manages to sweep her off her
feet and persuades her to marry him instead; the two have a child named
Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini). Unfortunately for the happy family, the
Third Reich and its Nazi minions occupy Italy and imprison all Jews in
work camps. </P>
<P>It is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie's theme of
family love becomes the strongest. Although prior to this turning point
Benigni plays Guido with a sort of goofy charm, he relaxes the role to
ensure his son's happiness. Now, instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet
Dora, he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right.
Benigni's performance is truly a well-rounded one, and certainly one of
the more fluid turns all year. </P>
<P>The supports are all strong as well, but the movie truly excels in its
script. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is a self-proclaimed fable, one which tells
its story in grand, two-part fashion. In certain parts it manages to
sink to the level of a "Saturday Night Live" spinoff -- a number of
humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie's second
half the script's circular nature becomes admirably obvious. Characters
make reprise appearances in fine form, and certain events which are
intially curious become critically linked to the plot's outcome. </P>
<P>In all, fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion
picture, and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see
their first "artsy" film. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is an artsy movie by
convention but easily accessible to everyone, and above all is a fine
thematic picture. </P>
