<PRE>5.    " Run Lola Run "  * * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Once the technique - same scenario, three different
ways ­ has been established, RUN LOLA RUN loses its novelty
effect.  That¹s unfortunate, as Tom Tykwer¹s tale of lovers
against the clock, I think, had some degree of potential.
Then again, what more is actually going on, here, than device?
Lola (Franka Potente) is given a very specific deadline by her
boyfriend, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreau):  show up at a phone booth
downtown with 100,000 deutsche marks in exactly 20 minutes, or
he will rob a supermarket across the street.  He owes this sum ­
which was hastily left behind by him on a subway train ­ to a
gangster, forget why, whom he fears will kill him if not produced.
Lola insists (screams, actually) that he not do anything rash,
and vows to come up with the money, somehow, on her own in time
to save him.  What follows is a series of montages with red-haired
Lola running furiously down the streets of Berlin, seeking out
her father for a loan, and the several different outcomes of
various strangers she encounters along the way.</P>
<P>I enjoyed the filmmaker¹s style, up to a point, using smash-
cuts and animation and continuous techno music to create a dizzying,
breathless atmosphere.  It works, invigorates us, and then quickly
fizzles.  Why?  The film is a mere 80-something minutes long, and
should¹ve been able to sustain its energy.  But, somehow, it
doesn¹t.  One too many "and, then.." segments, perhaps; or, little
to no actual character arc (though, how much can one reasonably
expect from this premise).  I found myself not caring in the least
whether or not Lola would make it to her destination as scheduled,
or the outcome of a subplot involving her father and his mistress,
while at the same time admiring the film¹s construction.  Flip-
flopping time lines are always intriguing, and RUN LOLA RUN is
playful in this regard.  My favorite sequences are the purgatory-
esque ones between Lola and Manni, after one of them has been
killed; the dialogue is simple and contemplative when all we do
is lay in bed and listen to these characters speculate on the
importance, one way or another, of their relationship.  There is
also a rather feverish scene in a casino, which contains the single
funniest line of dialogue, and acts as a sort of culmination for
every ounce of steam the film has spent its time working up.</P>
<P>More often than not, though, the film refuses to rest.  Not
necessarily a bad thing, mind you, but after a while I just got
antsy:  see the old lady on the phone who needs shampoo; see Lola
run; watch as the street people have their fates altered depending
on whether cartoon Lola can avoid the dog on the staircase.
The film explores almost every single angle of the plot, leaving
nothing to question about any of it, until all we¹re left with is
inventive editing.  Had RUN LOLA RUN been half as ingenious with
its story, as it is, for the most part, with its storytelling,
this could¹ve been a remarkable achievement.</P>
<P>     Best line:  comes when Lola is trying to get in to the casino;
she asks how this works, and the clerk says something along the
lines of, "You put money down for chips, and then gamble it away."</P>
