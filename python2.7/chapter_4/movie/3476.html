<PRE>                                DISCLOSURE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     DISCLOSURE is the latest of the Michael Crichton's (the dinosaur
guy's) novels to be made into a movie.  It stars Michael Douglas as the
department head hoping to be made a VP and to get rich off of the stock
options of the computer company for whom he works.  His old flame
played by Demi Moore comes out of the field to get the promotion and
become his boss.  She is promoted by the CEO played by Donald
Sutherland.  The CEO wants to make a $100,000,000 from a buy out that
is scheduled to happen in four days.</P>
<P>     In the beginning of the movie Moore attempts to rape Douglas in
her office the first night after she becomes his boss.  The rest of the
movie is about the sexual harassment charges and countercharges, but
there is much more going on in the plot that just that.</P>
<P>     This is one of those can you suspend disbelief or not movies.  You
have to believe or ignore that in a meeting of mixed sexes in a modern
computer company you could have constant explicit conversations about
sex including explicit--very explicit joking.  You have to believe
that a boss would rape an employee in his or her office on their first
day.  Finally, you have to believe that women can be guilty of rape in
an office setting.  I managed to just ignore the plausibility of most
of it and accept the rest as well maybe it could happen.  If you can
get through the first ten minutes, you are in for a great show.</P>
<P>     The movie moves with the speed of a freight train that is
accelerating toward the big merger in 4 days.  The movie has the days
of the week printed in stark white sans serif letters on a totally
black background as the days switch making you feel like you are
reading one of those exciting books that you just can not put down as
it races to its conclusion.</P>
<P>     The three leads in the show are all great and perfectly cast.
Originally Annette Bening was to play Moore's part, but Bening got
pregnant.  I cannot see Bening doing near as good as Moore - who had a
tough part to play and did it extremely well.  Sutherland was great as
a classic slimeball type CEO who cared not a whit about his employees.
His sole goal in life was to become a billionaire.</P>
<P>     Douglas was the real star of the show.  I thought he was good
enough to deserve consideration for an Oscar nomination.  You could
feel the panic in him.  Okay, it was similar to some other parts he has
played, but he was, nevertheless, terrific in his role.</P>
<P>     The script was very funny in parts.  Lots of loud laughter in the
theater.  There is a two word piece of dialog at the end that Douglas
whispers that had the audience applauding, laughing, and cheering at
the same time.  One of the other many memorable lines was when Moore
said that their company's "technology was so good it gave people what
religion was always promising, but never has been able to deliver."</P>
<P>     There was no need to have the implausible beginning.  They could
have gotten rid of the non-believable constant explicit office sex
talk, and they could have had Moore come on to Douglas in a more
believable fashion.  This is my only criticism of the film, and the
only reason it did not get my top rating.</P>
<P>     The movie runs lightning fast and 2:00 long.  It is rated R for
sex and profanity.  I think it would be okay for some of the older
teenagers.  I recommend the movie strongly to adults especially those
who like mysteries because that is what it ultimately turns out to be.
I give DISCLOSURE *** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
