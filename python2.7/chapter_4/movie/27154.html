<PRE>"The New Old Mill"
State and Main</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>This briskly-paced dry comedy portrays the daily trials and tribulations 
of a film crew as they field obstacle after obstacle in Smalltown, 
America. The most blaring predicament - how to write the old mill out of 
a script entitled "The Old Mill?" </P>
<P>"Why did we have to leave New Hampshire?" the bumbling writer asks the 
producer who is never at a loss for a quick fix answer or "associate 
producer" credit with which to patronize a discouraged contributor. </P>
<P>There's the actress refusing to expose herself after recently finding 
God, the writer who can't create without a manual typewriter, the male 
lead actor with a fetish for underage girls and the local townsfolk 
spinning a love story or two into the mix. </P>
<P>Cute, cozy and wryly funny; the film, feeling of "Northern Exposure" is 
slightly too TV. This is a small drawback, especially in the face of a 
thumping bustling pace that the filmmakers maintain from beginning to 
end. The only other shortcoming (and again a small one) lies in the 
casting. Populated by many interesting characters, the writer eventually 
becomes the focal person. Though, Philip Seymour Hoffman, performs fine, 
he simply doesn't elicit the compassion of the audience. Other actors 
who may have been better suited for the role include: Will Smith, Ben 
Stiller, Owen Wilson. </P>
