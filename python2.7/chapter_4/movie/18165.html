SUPER FEATURES:       Wonderful story. Well done.</PRE>
<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>This is a story that relates to a sensitive subject in Japan, and America.
And how some people have dealt with it all.  The subject
is Hiroshima and the bomb.</P>
<P>While the bomb went on to get Japan to surrender, it did make a mark in its
people, a mark that still lingers today, if the story is any
indication.  But its effects, other than the terrain, have almost
disappeared, with the exception of the elder generation, who may
not only have seen the blast, but also experienced it first hand.</P>
<P>And the story is related to that event.  The parents have gone to Hawaii to
visit the elder mother's ailing brother.  And the grand mother is
basically the babysitter.  And the children, want to go to Hawaii, where
they seem to see a better life and fun.  And one of the
ailing man's children is an American, who will inherit the family's fortunes
and large plantations.  This does not sit well with the
elders, but it seems an opportunity for the rest of the family for better
jobs and pay.</P>
<P>But the main thrust of the story is not the family situation, but the grand
mother's state, in the aftermath of the explosion, which
she saw amidst the mountains.  It has affected her since, and did kill many
of her family and friends.  She spends most of her time
isolated, and in quiet prayer and meditation, and the only things she can
talk about are the events, then, and how they felt about
them.</P>
<P>And this film becomes a chronicle of a generation that suffered much pain,
and has had to withstand inner anger for an enemy
for 50 years. These feelings, are still there, but smoothed out by the
economic situations between the country and the world.</P>
<P>The film is strictly about the details of the event, and how the grand
mother works with them.  And a powerful example it
is of what war can do to a populace.  The mother is not angry  at the
Americans, although she has some misgivings about her
brother's American son.  But she doesn't take it too personal, since she is
getting on, and she is much too tied up in the
event itself.</P>
<P>An excellent film, with some beautiful acting, Akira Kurosawa still uses his
own theatrical symbols, rather than revert
to special effects.  The old lady sees the explosion, and also thinks that
an eye has been watching them ever since.</P>
<P>Worth seeing.  Although very literary in content, the film, still, is a
wonderful look at a generation that lost much of its
strength, because of the bomb.</P>
