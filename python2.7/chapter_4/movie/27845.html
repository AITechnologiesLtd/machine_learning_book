<PRE>   There's an old saw that goes like this.</PRE>
<PRE>Anti-Semite: Do you know who caused this earthquake?  It
was the Jews.</PRE>
<P>More rational person:  No, it was the bicycle riders.</P>
<P>Anti-Semite: Why the bicycle riders?</P>
<PRE>More rational person: Why the Jews?</PRE>
<P>   From the way the Jewish people have been regarded by
their enemies, you'd think folks of that persuasion were the
most powerful people that ever lived--causing not only
earthquakes but famines, economic crashes, wartime defeats,
and other forms of sorcery.  In watching "Simon Magus," a
magical picture in more ways than one, people in the
audience who are not Jewish can absorb through writer-
director Ben Hopkins's careful, detailed, thoroughly human
and humane storytelling the entire history of the scapegoating
of the Hebrew people writ small.  While the specific crimes
attributed to the besieged people in the now-vanished town
and culture of a 19th Century hamlet in Poland's Silesia
include the charge that the bearded community were
prepared to sacrifice a Christian baby for use in the Passover
matzoh, such an excuse scarcely seems necessary given the
dislike, indifference, or patronizing attitudes of the larger,
Christian community toward a group that numbered no more
than twenty in the poverty-stricken mud-slicked expanse.</P>
<P>   The two plots that intertwine concern the romantic interest
of the Jewish community's scholar, Dovid (Stuart Townsend)
in the somewhat older and resistant widow Leah (Embeth
Davidtz); and the struggle between Dovid and the ambitious
and ruthless merchant Hase (Sean McGinley) to buy a piece
of land from the an aristocratic squire (Rutger Hauer). If
Dovid were to gain possession, he would construct a terminal
through the community to allow the railroad to pass through,
thereby helping his people modernize by enabling the dying
neighborhood to trade with both Jews and Gentiles of other
areas. Were Hase to succeed in buying the land, he would
kill the idea of the terminal so that his own business--based
on traffic through the ordinary road--would continue to
prosper without competition.  The Jews gain help from an
unlikely source, the psychotic Simon Magus--who in the world
of the Twenty-First Century would inevitably be an ignored,
homeless individual living on the streets, playing a
rudimentary wind instrument to raise a few coins from
passersby.</P>
<P>   What gives the story its original edge is one particular:
Simon has grown to dislike, even hate his own people, and
with good reason.  The small Jewish boys throw stones at
him, the rabbi refuses to allow him to pray with the other men
on the ground floor of the crude little synagogue, and on at
least one occasion he is given ten lashes by rabbinical order
for urinating into the mouths of four sleeping children--an act
which Simon executes at the behest of the Devil himself
(played by Ian Holm).</P>
<P>   Writer-director Hopkins--the son of a Gentile mother and a
Jewish father--is adept at evoking the mystical quality of the
village.  Much of the action appears to take place during
twilight hours, made particularly mysterious by the mist
covering the muddy streets which harbor the fragile wooden
homes of the poor and diminishing population of religious
Jews.  Hopkins evokes a theatrical performance from Noah
Taylor in the title role, a man shunned by his own people and
thereby manipulated by the cunning Hase who uses him as a
mole to destroy the last remnants of the Jewish population. 
Taylor babbles to himself, shakes his body in prayer
frequently during the day, and seems to gain the affectionate
attentions of just one child while being exploited by the local
priest (Ken Dury) and manipulated by the greedy merchant,
Hase.  Though he is given a chance at redemption near the
story's conclusion, Hopkins's heroes appear to be the town's
landowning aristocrat, a man who represents old money with
all of the contempt that the class possesses for clutching
merchants like Hase; and Dovid, a Talmudic scholar who
pursues his lady fair despite countless rejections and widens
his horizons via poetry lessons from the more wordly, more
secular, and unmarried Sarah (Amanda Ryan).</P>
<P>   Hopkins knows that in dealing with special effects, less is
more.  He carefully restrains the number of Simon's diabolical
visions, making Ian Holm in the role of the prince of darkness
appear like an insane villager himself rather than a horned
demon costumed in red.  In a film of conventional length,
Hopkins manages to depict various types of persons--Anti-
Semites determined literally to burn out the Jews; a kindly
aristocrat more interested in poetry than in business; a
madman who get a chance for fifteen minutes of fame; a
distinguished rabbi (David De Keyser), who fears the steady
attrition of his people; a scholar whose interest in a woman
competes with the Torah for his attention.  This is the
ambience that many of Isaac Bashevis Singer's characters
could call home, a now-vanished shtetl which, railroad or not,
was doomed to become extinct.  </P>
