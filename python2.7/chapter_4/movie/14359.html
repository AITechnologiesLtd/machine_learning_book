<PRE>Sergeant York (1941)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 72</PRE>
<P>"Sergeant York" is a very good, if sometimes
unintentionally humorous, biography of Alvin York.
York was one of the most famous heroes of WWI,
killing 20 Germans and capturing another 130
single-handedly.</P>
<P>Released at a time when the U.S. was preparing for
war, "Sergeant York" reassured the public that
serving your country in war is good, that the Germans
deserve a good beating, and that even Joe Sixpack
can become a stirring war hero.  The film also
has the message that religion can turn around a
failed life, and that religion and defense of your
country do not conflict.</P>
<P>Alvin York (Gary Cooper) begins the film as
a hard drinking Tennessee hellraiser, trying to
scratch out a meager living as a farmer on
bad land with his mother (Margaret Wycherly) and
stone-faced younger brother (Dickie Moore).
After Alvin falls for perky Joan Leslie,
he makes a valiant but unsuccessful attempt to
obtain good "bottom" farmland.  Helped by
preacher Walter Brennan, he turns to religion
and his fortunes immediately improve.</P>
<P>When the U.S. enters WWI, Alvin at first resists
the draft because "killin' is aginst the Bible".
But once he is fighting the "krauts", the former
pacifist seems to enjoy picking off the Germans,
even boasting that it is "just like [shooting]
a flock of turkeys".  Alvin's war heroics play
like a ten year old boy's fantasies, and in the
face of massive acclaim afterwards, he still
retains his 'Aw, Shucks' demeanor.</P>
<P>Cooper is perhaps too old for the role, but he
still deserved his Best Actor Oscar.  Cooper
gives York a self-effacing, rural Southern
character that seems credible.  Cooper is helped
by a fine script, which was co-written by John Huston
and was nominated for Best Original Screenplay.
Howard Hawks was nominated for Best Director,
Sol Polito was nominated for Best B & W Cinematography,
and Walter Brennan and Margaret Wycherly were
respectively nominated for Best Supporting Actor
and Actress.</P>
<P>Sometimes the film is so corny that it seems
ripe for parody, like an unintentional comedy.
But the quality of the script and production values
is very high, and Cooper gives a winning performance.</P>
