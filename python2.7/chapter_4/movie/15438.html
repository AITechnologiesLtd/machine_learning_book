<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>It is nice to know, that there is always one novel that no one, can ever
touch and make any better in a film.  This has been done many times, but, as
usual, the emotional stuff, and the showcase moments are always taken away
from the novel and presented as
great moments for the screen.  And a film looks good, but is not really
following the novel.</P>
<P>While Kenneth Branagh's version is very good, and very close to the novel,
it basically fails in the moments where the doctor has to defend himself.
Perhaps this film might have been better if the lead were given to another
actor, and Kenneth allowed himself
to direct it, and not have to show off the lines, as greater than the whole.
And this is the major complaint that this reviewer has of this film.</P>
<P>Dan Curtis's television version of this novel, still remains the best of all
versions of this film, and the main reason why, was that the film lacked
resources, and it had to make do with much care and dedication by the actors
and people involved.  The same is not quite true on this film, but it does
have its moments.</P>
<P>The best acting in this film is done by the bit parts that are important in
the novel, but come off as not very good in this film, because they are
overacted, or punctuated for meaning. John Cleese is magnificent, but is
wasted because his scene has to take one minute, when it should have been
better taken care of.  It might have set a tone of care for a great novel.
Instead it showed a Hollywood tradition of cutting several pages into a set
of lines.  Then, the  problem might arise that this story would be over
three
hours long.  Good.  The story is that good.  But the film can never be
unless it does the novel justice, even if it looks good.</P>
<P>Missing in this film is the period feel that the Hammer studios perfected so
well.  The moody spaces.  The superstitious public, which the novel uses so
well to trap the reader in its web of suspense and desire.  In Branagh's
version, one gets the
feeling that the whole thing has to hurry up to get to the end, which has
already been given us at the start.</P>
<P>The monster, played by Robert DeNiro is very good, although I tend to prefer
Michael Sarrazin's version in Dan Curtis's magnificent film, and I happen to
like Christopher Lee's  wonderful representation of the monster.  His is
very different, and makes an attempt at becoming a person, which happens in
the novel, but was ignored in all other versions, including Boris Karloff's.</P>
<P>Perhaps the difficulty here is weather the story should be about the
monster, or the doctor.  Kenneth Branagh's version is more about the doctor
than it is about the creation, though it uses the narration of the story.
While this is the right attitude of the whole thing, it never gets off the
ground as one would have liked, and once again my view is that Kenneth
Branagh was not as good as he might have been, had he not been directing, or
vice versa.  He is a good actor, but one gets the feeling that here, he just
is not prepared enough.</P>
<P>The film is good, don't get me wrong, but I do not feel it is as satisfying
as some of the others, specially Dan Curtis' magnificent one, which still is
the best of all the versions
of Mary Shelley's opus novel. Maybe not the most accurate of all the
versions, but certainly the most intuitive and touching of them all.</P>
