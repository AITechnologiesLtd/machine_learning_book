                                IN & OUT
                     A film review by Andrew Hicks
                      Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1997) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        It's taking awhile, but slowly the comedy genre of straight 
actors playing gay guys is going mainstream. What began with 
outrageous dragfests like TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR 
EVERYTHING, JULIE NEWMAR and THE BIRDCAGE has given 
way to more realistic, traditional morality-threatening films like 
IN & OUT. The beauty of IN & OUT, in its message of toleration and 
individuality, is that it can still be enjoyed by the most homophobic 
hetero men because it's just plain funny.</P>
<P>        Frank Oz, who ten years ago brought us DIRTY ROTTEN 
SCOUNDRELS, directs from a script by Paul Rudnick. A lot of times, 
IN & OUT is just as merciless on pop culture as the Rudnick-penned 
ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES, with the same quota of intelligent one-
liners. It's a good foundation for a movie that is full of extraordinarily 
likeable people -- I loved seeing Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Bob 
Newhart and Debbie Reynolds all make me laugh in one movie.</P>
<P>        The leading man here is Kevin Kline, who has exuded 
smarmy masculinity in comedies like A FISH CALLED WANDA and 
FRENCH KISS. The best word to describe his IN & OUT character is 
"prissy." He is an English teacher, absolutely nuts about sonnets and 
Streisand. He wears neatly-tailored suits, rides to school on a bike 
rather than destroy the environment and can't resist dancing no matter 
how hard he tries. It's not as if these are innately bad things, just not 
commonly accepted macho behavior.</P>
<P>        Still, everyone thinks this is all right because Kline is 
engaged to Cusack and has been for the past three years. They haven't 
consummated the relationship, so we sense Kline's "heterosexuality" 
may never have been lab tested. And when the school's most famous 
actor alumnus (Matt Dillon) wins an Oscar (for a hilariously bad turn 
as a gay military officer), dedicating his performance to Kline with the 
words "and he's gay!" all small town hell breaks loose.</P>
<P>        It turns into a media circus, with every conceivable question 
thrown at Kline ("Do you know Ellen?"). Things get unstable. 
Principal Newhart, still stammering as much as ever, makes it clear 
that Kline's job is in jeopardy if what Dillon said is true. Kline's 
parents (Reynolds and Wilford Brimley) begin to come undone. 
Reynolds, almost continuing her MOTHER performance, can't 
imagine going to her grave without throwing a wedding for her son, 
and Brimley... well, old Wilford don't want no fruit for a kid because, 
remember, Quaker Oats are "the right thing to do," not men.</P>
<P>        Selleck, sans moustache and Hawaiian shirt, is the most 
aggressive TV journalist out to make Kline's life hell, and we soon 
find out why. He's very, very gay and he's digging for more than just 
the scoop. Yeah, he's got the hots for Kev, but Kline is in denial and 
Cusack's life would lie in ruins without this wedding. Her situation, 
losing a lot of weight to net a man so she'll have some self esteem, 
deserves almost as much sympathy as Kline's search for a sexual 
identity.</P>
<P>        IN & OUT draws a huge laugh quotient from a still-
controversial premise, and directs it in such a way that it still turns 
into a happy, idyllic ending with a mate for everyone and a MR. 
HOLLAND'S OPUS testimonial climax. Even the villain figures, like 
Newhart and Dillon's insensitive, anorexic model girlfriend (Shalom 
Harlow), are likeable, and boogie with everyone else in the closing 
sequence.</P>
<P>        There's an entirely different genre of serious-as-hell gay 
dramas that focus on the real struggles of the homosexual community, 
but it's this fun fluff that draws the big names and the big bucks at the 
box office. IN & OUT is no exception.</P>
