<P>A good sci-fi is hard to come by these days. For every ingenious,
mind-boggling rarity like The Matrix, there are half a dozen idiotic
atrocities such as Virus. Where does The Thirteenth Floor come into
play? Somewhere in the middle, I should think.</P>
<P>During every twist and turn of this movie, you can sense the abundance
of good ideas stirring. The problem is, these ideas are never allowed to
escape, and the experience we’re left with putters along for an
incredibly hollow two-hour running time. Director Joseph Rusnak
obviously thinks that less is more. Well, in a situation like The
Thirteenth Floor, more would have definintely been appreciated.</P>
<P>The story involves brilliant scientist Hammond Fuller (Armin
Mueller-Stahl), who’s created a possible link to a parallel dimension; a
visual simulation that allows the user to be transported circa 1937 and
experience the old days. As we soon learn, Fuller has something very
important to tell a co-worker of his named Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko).
But before he successfully passes on the message, he is brutally stabbed
to death by an unknown assailant outside a bar. The first twenty minutes
of The Thirteenth Floor contain just the right dosage of intrigue and
paranoia, but the story soon dissipates into a jigsaw puzzle that never
gets finished. It has the right pieces, but never uses them quite right.</P>
<P>Yes, this film does have obvious comparisons to Dark City, eXistenZ and
The Matrix. But it’s approach is so laid-back and boring you don’t seem
to care. Even when the plot gets up into high gear (if that’s what you
want to call it), you still want it to go that extra yard.</P>
<P>The premise is quite intriguing, but I needed far more convincing. In
the last third, there’s an interesting sub-plot that delves into the
question of “what is reality?” Could it be possible that their world is
also a simulation, and that Fuller’s creation had already been
experimented with and they were the resulting product? Could their world
be a mere fabrication for other’s enjoyment? The Thirteenth Floor raises
so many questions, but unfortunately very few are answered for our
convenience.</P>
<P>The cast has a fun time playing dual, or sometimes triple roles with
this scenario. Vincent D’Onofrio plays a present day computer programmer
named Whitney, but also the tight-fisted bartender Ashton in 1937.
Gretchen Mol is unfairly wasted as a mysterious woman charading as
Fuller’s daughter, but also as a part-time clerk at a grocery store. The
one actor who plays just a single character is Dennis Haysbert,
captivating yet underused as a LAPD detective on the case.</P>
<P>With all of its shortcomings, it’s thankful the visual appearance of The
Thirteenth Floor is both diverting and impressive. There are marvelous
old-fashioned crane shots that cover the towering, shimmering buildings
of present day Los Angeles, and the 30’s are shown with convincing
effect.</P>
<P>It’s really too bad that The Thirteenth Floor couldn’t have amounted to
more. It had the potential to be a great science-fiction film. It’s
always important to have a strong premise in this sort of film, but the
payoff is even more vital. The rising action will set the audience up,
hopefully captivate them for long enough, until the much needed payoff
takes over and carries a movie to a sturdy finish. The Thirteenth Floor
has nothing of the kind.</P>
<P>This is not a bad film, when it comes down to it. The intelligence and
creativity are above average for the genre, the actors are competent
enough to carry the project... where, pray tell, did it all go wrong? I
believe the answer to that lies within the director’s choice to
completely ignore the third (and most important) act. The material here
would have gone a long way, if the movie was about 30 minutes long.</P>
