<P>     In the words of that eminently quotable maestro of malapropisms, 
Yogi Berra, "It's deja vu all over again."</P>
<P>     After a brief hiccup that saw the releases of COURAGE UNDER FIRE, 
MULTIPLICITY, and A TIME TO KILL, we're right back into the thick of the 
action again.  And, as has been the style all season, it's adrenaline 
without brains.  Looking back to the summer's beginning with TWISTER, 
you can probably name about a dozen movies that belong in this group -- 
some of which were reasonably entertaining, some of which weren't.  
CHAIN REACTION is just the latest link.</P>
<P>     Director Andrew Davis has lifted whole segments of CHAIN REACTION 
from another, better chase movie -- but at least he's had the good taste 
to steal from himself.  Aspects of this film are likely to remind even 
the most oblivious movie-goer of THE FUGITIVE, which Davis also 
directed.  There's the man on the run, the supposed friend who's not as 
helpful as he first seems, and the lawman who, despite pursuing the 
protagonist, is actually on his side.   </P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the hero, Eddie Kasalivich, is played by Keanu 
Reeves, not Harrison Ford, and it's fair to say that the two are not in 
the same class as actors.  Eddie, a machinist, works at the University 
of Chicago on the "Hydrogen Energy Project".  The man in charge of the 
project, Paul Shannon (Morgan Freeman), seems like a nice, helpful 
person -- which probably means he's anything but that.  One night, while 
working late, Eddie arrives at the solution to a problem that has been 
plaguing the project since its inception.  Following this breakthrough, 
the scientists have at their fingertips a method of producing stable 
hydrogen from ordinary water -- "cheap, clean, abundant energy" which 
has the potential of making fossil fuels obsolete.  Someone, however, 
doesn't want the formula to get out, and they're willing to murder, not 
to mention destroy an eight-block area of Chicago's south side, to bury 
the secret.  Eddie soon finds himself, along with an attractive female 
physicist, Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz), framed for murder, and on the 
run from an FBI team led by the no-nonsense Inspector Ford (Fred Ward).</P>
<P>     Yes, the plot contains some interesting elements, but, when all is 
said and done, they're only window dressing for the elaborate chase 
sequences.  This isn't a thought-provoking motion picture interested in 
exploring fertile territory; it's a reasonably straightforward action 
feature.  If you don't believe me, just count the number of explosions, 
gun shots, and fights.  </P>
<P>     In its defense, CHAIN REACTION has an excellent first half hour.  
There's a satisfying explosion that levels a significant portion of 
south Chicago (although, based on the low number of casualties, this 
part of the city appears to be largely uninhabited) and a well-paced 
foot chase along Michigan Avenue that ends with a race up an opening 
draw bridge.  Unfortunately, after that, CHAIN REACTION settles into a 
comfortable, routine rhythm that lasts until the rousing conclusion.</P>
<P>     As in SPEED, Reeves' acting limitations aren't a severe liability, 
since the part of Eddie doesn't require great range.  On the other hand, 
Rachel Weisz (one of the best things about STEALING BEAUTY) is 
reasonably  impressive.  While Reeves' Eddie faces adversity with a 
blase attitude, Weisz' Lily appears frightened, bewildered, and 
vulnerable.  The actress takes her token female sidekick role and 
develops a character of some substance out of it.  In fact, given the 
obvious constraints, it's hard to imagine anyone doing anything more 
with Lily.  Meanwhile, Morgan Freeman basically re-creates his OUTBREAK 
personae.  Freeman always has an arresting screen presence, but this 
isn't one of his more challenging parts.  Fred Ward, while no Tommy Lee 
Jones, is adequate as the sympathetic FBI agent.</P>
<P>     Aside from the lip service paid to the pros and cons of releasing 
free hydrogen onto the world market, CHAIN REACTION doesn't contain 
anything that we haven't already seen this summer.  The explosive 
destruction that wipes out a portion of Chicago looks like it could have 
been excised from INDEPENDENCE DAY.  The action sequences recall MISSION 
IMPOSSIBLE, ERASER, and THE ROCK, albeit with less energy.  The concept 
of government agents being bad guys has been used so often that it has 
long since turned into a tired cliche.  CHAIN REACTION isn't dull -- the 
film is paced to keep audiences attentive -- but the lack of originality 
dampens its enjoyability.  As a result, box office reaction will almost 
certainly be more like a spark than an explosion.</P>
