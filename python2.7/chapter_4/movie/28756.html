<PRE>KEEP THE RIVER ON YOUR RIGHT
A MODERN CANNIBAL TALE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"I don't want to seem rude, but how do people taste?" a polite high 
school girl on a museum outing asks Tobias Schneebaum, a 76-year-old 
artist turned anthropologist whose claim to fame is that he once tasted 
human flesh.  He doesn't remember, which is symptomatic of the problem 
of the documentary KEEP THE RIVER ON YOUR RIGHT: A MODERN CANNIBAL TALE, 
an intriguing but frustrating look back at a man's life.  Told with 
interviews conducted on locations where Tobais once traveled and with 
archival footage -- he was a big hit on the television show circuit in 
1969 -- the movie tantalizes but rarely satisfies.</P>
<P>A man who convincingly claims to have found inner peace, Tobias proves 
to be a rather bland interviewee.  Once the shock factor of his having 
once eaten another human is over, the movie doesn't have much more to 
offer.  We learn how the big incident came about.  He was in Peru and 
heard about one tribe killing and eating another so he felt he had to 
find the cannibals.  He walked for 8 days, following the instructions he 
was given of keeping the river on his right.  He doesn't seem remorseful 
about his subsequent participation in another raid and subsequent feast, 
although he feigns some regret in one interview.  Moreover, he claims 
that cannibals were more compassionate than so-called civilized 
societies -- a curious view that is challenged on one talk show.</P>
<P>Besides cannibalism, the movie also dwells on Tobias's homosexuality and 
on the homosexuality of the tribes that he lived with.  What we have is 
a story about an honest man who is happy to share his thoughts with us, 
but who has remarkably little insightful to say about his one, brief 
episode of cannibalism.  The film makers, David and Laurie Shapiro, miss 
golden opportunities to pursue what it means when someone takes an 
active part in something they set out to examine.  How would we feel if 
a reporter took part in a bank robbery or a mugging in order to better 
understand the criminal mind?  We would certainly, at least, want to ask 
the reporter some very probing questions.   </P>
<P>KEEP THE RIVER ON YOUR RIGHT: A MODERN CANNIBAL TALE runs rather long at 
1:35.  It is rated R for depiction of mature thematic material and would 
be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
