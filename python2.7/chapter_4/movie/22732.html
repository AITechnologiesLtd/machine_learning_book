<P>Angela's Ashes (1999) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Emily Watson,
Robert Carlyle, Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge. Written by
Alan Parker and Laura Jones. Directed by Parker.</P>
<P> In a strange, almost perverse way, "Angela's Ashes" is a feel-good
movie. You stumble out of the theater after watching two-plus hours
about one family coping with a poverty level that is unimaginable to
most of us, and you want to clasp your hands and whisper a prayer to
whatever deity you worship, thanking him (or her) for whatever bounties
you have.</P>
<P> Many will find the abject misery displayed in this adaptation of Frank
McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir hard to ingest.</P>
<P> What keeps the movie from being unbearably morose is the bits of humor
displayed throughout the proceedings. Even amidst the most dire of
circumstances - and as long as they are together - the McCourts can
rummage for scraps of happiness.</P>
<PRE> And scraps are the main course at the McCourts - when they are
available.</PRE>
<P> Director Alan Parker's adaptation is wet and bleak. Death is a constant
neighbor, hunger a daily playmate, despair a daily companion.</P>
<P> Set mostly in Limerick, Ireland, in the 1930s and ‘40s, "Angela's
Ashes" almost revels in the displaying the hardships endured by the
McCourts.</P>
<P> Children are born, then die.  The local church is no help, neither are
the local charities who would rather judge than assist.</P>
<P> Part of the problem is simple prejudice. Malachy McCourt (Robert
Carlyle) is a Protestant from Belfast. But his wife, Angela (Emily
Watson) is a Catholic girl from Limerick. In a nation with such
sectarian hatred and religious divisiveness as Ireland, such a union is
scandalous.</P>
<P> Plus, Malachy is a wastrel. He drinks and cannot hold a job. His only
function is to entertain his children with tall tales and legends from
Irish history.</P>
<P> The McCourts are a family, as an adult Frank narrates, that do things
backwards. </P>
<P> The family leaves the slums of Brooklyn, N.Y., to return to a harsher,
more unforgiving live back in Limerick.</P>
<P> Parker presents all the wants and hunger and humiliations suffered by
the McCourts with a journalist's objectivity. It would have been so easy
to transform "Angela's Ashes" into a maudlin tear-jerker in which you
could only feel sorry for this pitiful family.</P>
<P> Yet Parker creates - not a nobility - but an admirable fortitude so
that you feel uncomfortable pitying the McCourts.</P>
<P> The film's performances are splendid. Watson, with her saintly visage,
seems so soft, yet she is a woman of indomitable strength who goes to
any lengths, makes any sacrifice to keep her family together and a roof
over its head.</P>
<P> Carlyle is a dreamer, a drunkard, but not really a bad man. He is weak
and overwhelmed, proud and stubborn. Yet he is a loving and caring
father and husband.</P>
<P> Three young actors portray Frank at various stages and the
transformation from one to the other is seamless. All three - Joe Breen
(Young Frank, age 5 to 8), Ciaran Owens (Middle Frank, age 10 to 13) and
Michael Legge (Older Frank), all display the gaunt, hollow-eyed, gnawing
pangs that constant hunger creates. But they all also show spirit and an
energy that allows Frank to constantly battle back.</P>
<P> In the beginning, the film's narrator intones the opening of McCourt's
book: `When I look back on my childhood, I wonder how my brothers and I
managed to survive at all. It was ... a miserable childhood; the happy
childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable
childhood is the miserable Irish childhood; and worse yet is the
miserable Irish Catholic childhood.'</P>
<P> Parker, who adapted McCourt's book with Laura Jones, has been able to
transform misery into near poetry.</P>
<P> Some of the pieces in "Angela's Ashes" will leave you depressed, some
may sicken and sadden. But - in the end - it will inspire.</P>
