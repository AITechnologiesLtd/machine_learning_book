<P>The Preacher's Wife (PG) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>'Tis the season for shopping, gift-giving, and feel-good family
films like The Preacher's Wife, which, despite a major problem (which can be
summed up in two words), gets the uplifting job done.</P>
<P>In Penny Marshall's frothy reworking of 1947's The Bishop's Wife,
Denzel Washington plays Dudley, an angel sent down from Heaven to help
Reverend Henry Biggs (Courtney B. Vance), who is doubting his ability to
make a difference to the community and his family--wife Julia (Whitney
Houston) and son Jeremiah (Justin Pierre Edmund).  Dudley does his best to
restore the reverend's faith in himself, but along the way he cannot help
but be sidetracked by what earth has to offer, including the neglected Julia
and Jeremiah, who savor the attention he, and not Henry, gives them.</P>
<P>It's good to see the gifted Washington in a departure from the heavy
dramatic roles he's made his name in, and he has a ball as the funloving and
well-meaning Dudley; the fact that he does so well in a lighthearted role is
just a testament to his  remarkable talent.  Vance is likely to go
underappreciated for his subtle performance; he manages to make the audience
care without resorting to showy theatrics.  Perhaps the most memorable turns
come from a trio of supporting players.  Loretta Devine has a few choice
moments of neurosis as Henry's put-upon secretary;  the hilarious Jenifer
Lewis all but steals the show as Julia's sassy mother; and Edmund is a
natural charmer as Jeremiah.  He's bound to leave audiences going "aw" all
through the movie as he did with the preview audience I was in.</P>
<P>To her credit, Houston gives her least annoying performance to date.
In a wise move, Marshall and screenwriters Nat Mauldin and Allan Scott have
her break into spirited gospel numbers whenever the story allows it, and it
is during these moments that she truly comes to life, showing an infectious
energy like never before on the big screen.  But when the music dies down,
so does her performance.  As an actress, Houston is the blandest of the
bland.  She can't make a line sound natural to save her life; every word
that comes out of her mouth sounds scripted.  She is also an oddly chilly,
distant, self-involved presence; she does not have a convincing maternal
rapport with Edmund, let alone any romantic sparks with Vance or Washington.
It's as if she's acting in a box apart from everyone else.  As a result, the
emotional involvement in Henry and Julia's relationship--the center of the
story--is weakened.  We want Henry to get his life together and make his
family happy because he, Jeremiah, and Dudley want it; the fact that Julia
is involved at all is of little consequence.</P>
<P>But the aim of The Preacher's Wife is to make the audience walk out
of the auditorium with smiles on their faces and their spirits lifted, and I
cannot imagine anyone not giving in at least in part to its charms--of which
there are many.  It is a fun, feel-good family film that actually does leave
you feeling good.<HR></P>
