<PRE>BLESS THE CHILD</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Chuck Russell
Written by: Cathy Cash Spellman (novel), Thomas Rickman</P>
<P>Maggie O'Connor (Kim Basinger) is a child psychologist whose sister, Jenna 
(Angela Bettis), just dropped by after a several year hiatus. Jenna is a 
drug addict and dumps her baby girl, Cole (later played by Holliston 
Coleman), in Maggie's lap and then takes off. Maggie raises the child as her 
own, but Cole is different than most children. Cole has strange gifts like 
being able to move objects and bring the dead back to life, but Maggie 
doesn't seem to think anything of it. After six years of raising Cole, Jenna 
shows up again, still drugged up, but now married to a wealthy self-help 
guru named Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell). Eric and Jenna want Cole back, and 
when Maggie refuses they take her anyway. Maggie goes to the authorities and 
speaks to FBI agent John Travis (Jimmy Smits), who becomes convinced that 
Stark is behind a series of child murders that have been taking place in the 
city. As it turns out, Stark is the head of a Satanic cult and believes that 
Cole is the world's savior, who he must convert to his evil ways. Maggie and 
John have only one week to track Stark down and reclaim Cole before Stark 
either kills her or converts her, whichever proves easier.</P>
<P>I don't know about you, but I'm getting a little tired of these weird, 
quasi-religious movies Hollywood has been throwing at us lately ("Stigmata", 
"End of Days", even "Dogma"). These films are usually thrillers, and somehow 
involve a conflict with the church and the end of the world, and some 
hapless fool thrown in the middle of it all. That about sums up Chuck 
Russell's ("Eraser") "Bless the Child". The only difference is, Russell's 
film is deeply religious and pro-church, while most of these films are 
generally anti-religion. Does that make it less irritating? Not by a long 
shot. I can't honestly say there is one specific thing that's wrong with 
"Bless the Child", it's more that there's nothing really good about it. This 
is the kind of movie you'll sit through, not really caring what's going on, 
just waiting for it to end. The kind of movie where you'll be thinking about 
things like doing laundry when you get home, or how much fixing your car is 
going to cost instead of paying attention to what's happening on screen. 
It's not all Russell's fault, no one could have done much with this 
frightfully dull script, but a lot of the blame can rest firmly on his 
shoulders; mainly for the languid pacing and dreary cinematography.</P>
<P>"Bless the Child" does go out of its way to prove one thing: Kim Basinger's 
Oscar for "LA Confidential" was a fluke. I've never thought of Basinger as a 
great actress (quite the opposite actually), and while I thought she gave a 
very nice performance in "LA Confidential", I didn't think it was Oscar 
worthy (though every one of her co-stars gave a performance worthy of an 
award). In "Bless the Child" she doesn't seem quite sure how to act. Half 
the time she's timid and unsure of herself, then she'll suddenly switch to 
fighting people and screaming. Rufus Sewell, who gave great performances in 
both "Dark City" and "Dangerous Beauty", delivers a mediocre one here. He 
simply seemed incapable of acting turly evil, which is (I think) how this 
character was supposed to be. Jimmy Smits is, well, Jimmy Smitts; likeable 
enough, but little more to him. Holliston Coleman isn't required to act 
much. All she's really asked to do is refer to herself in the third person, 
hug people, and smash her head against walls (don't ask me about that one, 
it never gets explained). Despite what both the previews and the opening 
credits would have you believe, Christina Ricci ("Sleepy Hollow") and Ian 
Holm ("The Fifth Element") show up in what amount to little more than 
cameos.</P>
<P>"Bless the Child" is a movie filled with lots of little details that simply 
don't work. Right from the start, when Maggie and Jenna meet up I knew I was 
in for a bumpy ride. The two have an argument which somehow manages to 
dredge up every traditional reason why movie sisters fight. Why do I say 
movie sisters rather than just sisters? Because movie sisters fight about 
things like drug use, miscarriages, ex-husbands, and anything else remotely 
melodramatic the writers can think of. The dialogue is fairly hammy and 
cheesy (I actually started thinking of a ham and cheese sandwich my mind was 
wandering so much), and once again writers stole that classic line from "The 
Usual Suspects" - "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing 
the world he didn't exist." If that line gets stolen for use in one more 
cheesy movie I'm going to, well, complain some more I suppose. The fact that 
Chuck Russell doesn't direct too often becomes painfully obvious about 
fifteen minutes into the film, when he makes every mistake in the book. 
Russell's biggest mistake is throwing strange images at you, the picture 
fades to the next scene, and what happened in the last scene is never 
explained.</P>
<P>How many loose ends do you usually like your movies to have? None? Well then 
I'd recommend staying away for that reason alone because guess what, nothing 
gets explained. We never learn just who Cody is supposed to be (Savior 
reborn? An angel come to earth?), and we never learn what Eric Stark is 
hoping to accomplish by turning her to his side. His way of converting her 
doesn't make a whole lot of sense anyway. There's a brief hint of the last 
temptation of Christ in there, but Eric's idea of temptation seems to be "do 
this or I'll kill you". You're no doubt wondering about the special effects, 
because any good religious thriller (assuming one exists other than "The 
Exorcist") is bound to have them, right? Well, the special effects in "Bless 
the Child" probably would have been fairly creepy were it not for the fact 
that they appear to have been produced on a home computer. The score, by 
Christopher Young ("The Hurricane"), isn't exactly bad, it's just not used 
enough to make much of an impression. Russell throws the score in during the 
really dramatic moments, but other than that we don't hear it too often. 
It's obviously loud and dramatic during the film's finale, but the problem 
is that the finale is anything but dramatic. It's so anti-climactic I just 
about dozed off during it. "Bless the Child" runs a painful 110 minutes, but 
you'll have to decide if you want to pay eight dollars for a two hour nap. 
I'd recommend the film to fans of "Stigmata" (assuming they exist) and give 
it two and a half out of five stars.</P>
