<P>   This was the last Carry on movie (if you discount 'Carry on Columbus' 
as a Carry on movie) and was made by a new production company.
   Based in Central London, this movie is about the attempts by 
Emmanuelle Prevert (Suzanne Danielle) to bed her husband Emile the French 
Ambassador (Kenneth Williams). When he seems unwilling, she is given his 
permission to bed anyone she likes, such as the Prime Minister and the 
U.S.Ambassador. Her antics get her into trouble and the British press 
spread these rumours all over their front pages. She is invited to talk 
on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours 
instead. Meanwhile, Theodore Valentine (Larry Dann) is in love with 
Emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the Concorde and is 
determined to marry her. However, she is only interested in restoring her 
husband's ardour which seems a little difficult after Emile's accident 
with a church spire!
   This film is the second worst Carry on movie, the worst being 'Carry 
on England'. It is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars 
struggle through this diabolical script by Lance Peters and try to pull 
off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written. 
   Newcomers Suzanne Danielle and Beryl Reid (as Mrs.Valentine) are 
mildly funny, but Larry Dann as Theodore is excruciatingly bad. Kenneth 
Williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is 
warranted, given the script. The small parts for Jack Douglas as Lyons 
the butler, Joan Sims as Mrs.Dangle, Kenneth Connor as Leyland the 
chauffeur, and Peter Butterworth as Richmond, are worthless and 
embarassing. In fact, all four parts are surplus to requirements. 
However, the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them 
and Emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades. 
   An awful script, a terrible collection of jokes, very poor production 
values (especially the scene where Emmannuelle takes her clothes off at 
St.James Palace), a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score, and a 
non-existent plot or storyline. Its just a succession of awful set pieces 
about who Emmannuelle will bed next! Jack Douglas is not so annoying but 
is more boring, Joan Sims and Peter Butterworth are wasted, and Kenneth 
Connor and Kenneth Williams put in some poor performances as Leyland and 
Emile. A complete waste of time, this movie was trying to catch up with 
the new sexually permissive Seventies. It was a Certificate 15 film but 
by 1978, there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at 
the box office and was only given its premiere on UK terrestrial 
television in April 1998! Avoid at all costs!</P>
<PRE>My rating:- 0.5 out of 5 stars.</PRE>
