<PRE>                              MATRIX 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
                   3 out of 4 for bullets and leather</PRE>
<P>Cast:  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving,
Joe Pantoliano.
Screenplay:  Larry Wachowski and Andy Wachowski.
Producer:  Joel Silver.
Directors:  Larry Wachowski and Andy Wachowski.</P>
<P>In one of the slickest movies to arrive in our cinema this year, we have
Keanu Reeves and ensemble gang members donning leathers gunning down
computer generated anti-virus programmes, and anyone standing in
between.</P>
<P>Issues:
1. Can a movie such as Matrix tip hormonally-charged, acne-ridden
adolescent teenagers into gunning down their schoolmates? Possible in
theory, but made impossible without the existence of guns.
2. What is the Matrix? It's not a non-alcoholic cocktail, it's not a
formula for cold fusion, and it's not another name for the Rubik's Cube.
But it does smell of computer generated world used to house human guinea
pigs for energy.
3. Who got to keep all the leathers after shooting the movie finished?
Was it real leather or imitation? A budget of more than 100 000 000
answers this question.
4. Can Keanu Reeves act? Yes, but he was still better as Bill, or was it
Ted?
5. Was the movie boring? I watched it twice, but my best friend fell
asleep and the guy on the other side of me started snoring.
6. On action and special effects. What you see on the ads is really what
you get. Lots of smooth, streamlined karate kicks and bullet dodging.
7. Will my girlfriend like it? She will probably end up fantasising
about Keanu, leaving you feeling like an overweight jerk, who has done
little with his life. WARNING: Keanu Reeves is looking devastatingly
good in this movie; this movie should not be viewed by any male
individual who has a poor self image, or is on the verge of commiting
suicide.
8. Will there be a sequel? Probably.</P>
