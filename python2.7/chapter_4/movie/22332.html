<P>Stephen King has always made good horror movies (The Shining, Misery, Cujo) but
one might cringe at the fact of a drama coming from the hands of Stephen King.
Remember, however Stephen King also brought us great films such as "Stand By
Me" which became one of the best-known 'buddy flick', and "The Shawshank
Redemption" both movies being spectacular in every way and surprising people by
knowing that the horror master himself Stephen King wrote both of those books.
Now in 1999 we get yet another Stephen King masterpiece this one being better
than the ones mentioned above, it is strikingly original, emotional, powerful
and so absorbing that by the end we are left in a state that we sit in our seat
too amazed to move.</P>
<P>Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb a guard at a prison in Louisiana. He works with
inmates on death row who have committed crimes and soon go to the Electric
chair. A new inmate comes aboard by the name of John Coffey (Like the drink
only spellt different) who is accused of killing two little girls. John Coffey
however even though the size of him (played by Michael Duncan "Armageddon's
Bear") John Coffey is a nice man. Paul Edgecomb starts to find out that maybe
John didn't kill those little girls. Then John does the most amazing thing ever
and Paul realizes that what they are dealing with here is a miracle...on The
Green Mile (as in the prison walk). Now Paul must try and prove that John did
not kill those little girls...and get him off death row before he must be
killed.</P>
<P>The best thing about this whole movie is the performance by Michael
Duncan...who gives in my opinion the best performance of the year. In fact he
might even give the best performance of all time with his southern accent...and
sweet side Michael Duncan is truly brilliant. Tom Hanks (who never gives a bad
performance) yet again delivers an Oscar Worthy performance in this three hour+
film that seems to go by in no time. Surprisingly enough with such a dramatic
atmosphere and story the movie also has a big amount of comedy and witty
dialogue that doesn't seem beligerant or unnecessary.</P>
<P>The supporting performances by Michael Jeter who plays an inmate with a cute
little mouse named Mr. Jingles is also truly a great actor who gives a great
performance as does David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell and Patricia
Clarkson who all give believeable and powerhouse performances. The screenplay
by Frank Darabont who also directed the film is well-crafted and stays very
close to the book. The whole movie moved me in a way no other movie has and has
it's special magic like this years earlier masterpiece "The Sixth Sense" which
had it's own substance to take the viewer by the hand and leads then through an
amazing experience that after it is over they are left in their chair unable to
move.</P>
<P>In other words "The Green Mile" finds it's own path and makes it's own
miracles. It's never slow and it's never too dramatic. The best thing about the
film is that you yourself become a character and you yourself are there
watching what is happened instead of watching it as a movie. Movies that do
this are always magical and as the tagline for the film goes "Miracles are
found in the most unexpected places" and therefore "The Green Mile" is a
miracle all of it's own.</P>
