<P>Susan Granger's review of "DR. DOLITTLE 2" (20th Century-Fox)</P>
<P>When I took a seven year-old and a ten year-old to see Eddie 
Murphy, once again, play Dr. John Dolittle, they loved it. And 
why not? Filled a merry menagerie, including his faithful dog 
Lucky (voiced by Norm Macdonald), plus lots of fart and 
poop jokes, it's aimed directly at pre-teens. The story begins in 
Dr. Dolittle's San Francisco clinic where, after hours, he 
conducts a group therapy session for strays, assuring them, 
"Every dog can find a family and be someone's best friend." 
But his healer-who-talks-with-animals routine is interrupted 
by a summons to meet the Mafia-connected Mr. Beaver 
(voiced by Richard C. Sarafian). It seems the little critters 
need his help to save their forest that's being threatened by an 
evil logger (Jeffrey Jones) and his lawyer (Kevin Pollak). So 
Mrs. Dolittle (Kristen Wilson), a lawyer, gets an injunction, 
pleading that the forest is home to the last Pacific Western 
bear, an endangered species. The catch is that Dolittle must 
play match-maker for the bear, named Ava (voiced by Lisa 
Kudrow), pairing her with Archie (voiced by Steve Zahn), a 
circus-trained bear, who has no desire to live in the wild. 
"Winnie the Who?" Dolittle cajoles, appealing to his vanity. 
"You'll be famous!" But once Archie gets a look at Ava, he 
changes his tune to "I Will Survive" and tries to win her 
affections from a rival Kodiak bear. Written by Larry Levin 
and directed by Steve Carr, Dolittle's survival-training with 
Archie provides plenty of laughs, as does the subsequent 
world-wide Animal Strike. There's also a dreary romantic 
subplot involving Dolittle's petulant 16 year-old daughter 
(Raven-Symone) and her pizza-delivery boy-friend (Lil' 
Zane). On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Dr. Dolittle 
2" is a sweet-natured 6. It's an amiable, big-screen sit-com 
that's not hard to bear.</P>
