<PRE>Hard Rain</PRE>
<P>Starring Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Minnie Driver, Randy Quaid</P>
<P>First it was called "The Flood" and now it's called "Hard Rain".  I don't
see much of a difference, but apparently some executives at Paramount
figured that with a title like "The Flood", it might become another
casuality of the "disaster movie flops", a la "Volcano" and "Dante's
Peak". </P>
<P>Well, whatever you want to call it, it's a pretty good movie.  It's
written by Graham Yost, the guy responsible for the first "Speed" movie. 
"Hard Rain" is very similiar in many respects.  We have the hero who
doesn't really want to be a hero.  We have the love interest, who is much
wiser than she appears to be.  The only thing different, is that "Hard
Rain" doesn't really feature a clear villian, where "Speed" had Dennis
Hopper.  </P>
<P>This isn't a bad thing, really.  I mean, aren't we all sick of the stock
film bad guy?  It's usually some dude with a grudge, and a lot of
ammo/bombs at his disposal.  "Hard Rain" features Morgan Freeman as the
"bad guy", but once we get to know him, we find that he's really not that
bad after all.  He doesn't want to kill anyone, he just wants to get the
money that Christian Slater is responsible for.  It's through a set of
extreme circumstances that his non-violence plan is thrown off course.  To
say more, would really be unfair, because a large part of the enjoyment of
this film are the unexpected surprises along the way.</P>
<P>Christian Slater, recently jailed for beating up his girlfriend, gives a
fair performance as a man who's just trying to do the right thing under
really difficult circumstances.  The real star of the show, however, is
Freeman.  It's really surprising to see him "slumming" in a film like
this, but he does bring an unexpected air of dignity to what would have
otherwise been a standard action flick.</P>
<P>Anyway, while it's no "Speed", "Hard Rain" is a suitably diverting way to
spend an hour and a half.</P>
