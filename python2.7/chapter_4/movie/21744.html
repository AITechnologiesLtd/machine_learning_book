<P>`The Evil Dead' has developed into a cult classic over the years. The
idea was concocted by Sam Raimi and his college buddy, Bruce Campbell,
obviously when their beer keg had run dry. They set out to make a little
horror movie with a microscopic budget, out in a confined setting, with
a mere 5-person cast. I'm sure neither Raimi nor Campbell had planned on
the massive following that `The Evil Dead' has compiled since 1982.</P>
<P>The fact that `The Evil Dead' was produced with such a tiny budget only
seems to add to the fright factor. The movie has a dark, dank and cheesy
appearance that perfectly accentuates the plot of demonic possession.
And please, don't get me wrong, the anemic story line of the film is
flat-out idiotic. The material could have easily developed into another
perpetually retarded horror picture from the early 80's. But - with
Raimi's wonderful style and cunning approach - it somehow develops it
into a frightening, atmospheric and innovative bloodbath. Those looking
for a fun time of bloody cadavers, inventive shocks and corny special
effects couldn't do much better.</P>
<P>There are only five performers in `The Evil Dead' - a quintet of college
students who have slipped away for a quiet weekend at a rickety old
cabin in the woods. Ash (Bruce Campbell), Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss),
Scotty (Hal Delrich), Linda (Betsy Baker) and Shelly (Sarah York) are
mainly just the bunch of intellectually-impaired bimbos you would expect
from a horror film. After seeing something outside her window, one even
walks out into the middle of the woods to investigate. It could have
been a squirrel, but for whatever reason, the individual wanders into
the dark recesses of the forest calling `hello??' repeatedly. Movies
like `Scream' are so successful because they mock the horror genre with
such fun and accuracy. `The Evil Dead' does not revolve around
characters and dialogue. It's mainly about dismembered bodies, and
Raimi's ability to rattle our cages until we keel over like a petrified
sack of potatoes.</P>
<P>So, the five are living the good life until demons come and disrupt
their big party. Actually, the kids bring it on themselves, using a tape
recorder to play strange incantations which are supposedly recited by a
professor who previously stayed in the cabin. The magic spell awakes a
terrifying life force in the woods, and one by one the characters become
violently possessed by ferocious demons. Ash is left as the reluctant
hero, who barricades up every door and makes a last stand against the
demonic intruders.</P>
<P>Unlike it's two maniacal sequels, `Evil Dead 2' and `Army of Darkness',
this entry relies mainly on pulse-pounding horror. In that field, `The
Evil Dead' delivers in large, gory quantities. You may never want to go
camping again after enduring this relentless bloodbath of claustrophobic
chills. But, even though it's very subtle and hardly recognizable, Raimi
also injects a wry sense of humor to liven things up even more. There
are occasional moments that remind us, despite that `The Evil Dead' is
all in good fun. For instance, soon after poor Shelly has been hacked to
pieces (her severed parts still convulsing on the floor like gelatin),
Ash assures Scotty `we're all going to make it out of here. You, me,
Shelly.... well, not Shelly.'</P>
<P>While it may not be the bloodiest movie ever made, `The Evil Dead' could
easily register as the most disgusting. Scenes in which characters erupt
like pressurized tomatoes are repulsive and nauseating... not to mention
barrels of fun. You may feel obliged to lose your lunch during some
especially revolting bits. The one that caused my stomach to somersault
backwards occurred when a character rises from a buried grave, and rakes
poor Ash's leg with her fingernails (digging literally to the bone). Oh,
there's also the segment in which a girl is strapped down and raped by a
tree. That's in pretty bad taste, alright.</P>
<P>Campbell later evolved into a gung-ho heroic figure as the series
progressed, which was a lot of fun to watch, but here he is perfect. You
may recognizable Campbell from his prolonged stint on television's
`Xena: Warrior Princess' and a scene-stealing cameo in `Escape from LA'.
Sadly, little has come his way aside from the three `Evil Dead' films.
Campbell has an endearing everyman quality, and his delivery is brisk
and colorful, making him one of the more underrated actors of modern
cinema. Campbell's game performance and Raimi's tremendous direction are
the heart and soul behind the film.</P>
<P>It's not for all tastes, that's for sure, but `The Evil Dead' is a
highly enjoyable shocker for all who dare to grab their snorkel and
plunge in. Sam Raimi's delightful, dizzying camera work and imaginative
style help it prevail far over genre expectations. Why not rent this
diamond in the rough for Halloween?  It's one rare instance where a
tight budget actually paid off.</P>
