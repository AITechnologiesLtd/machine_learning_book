<P>Final Destination (2000) by John Sylva    Rating: A</P>

<P>The majority of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about to meet
their demise with cheesy music, worn out dialogue such as "I'll be right back,"
or simply with the overall tone of the scene.  How about a classic John Denver
song as a death signal for a change?  That's the kind of bursting originality
that allows "Final Destination" to invade the viewer's mind, even days after
seeing it, making one pause before ever entering a dark room, taking a shower,
or even going to sleep.  The unique and horrifying thriller is the best thing
to happen to the slasher genre since 1996's "Scream."  "Final Destination,"
directed by James Wong and penned by Jeffrey Riddick, Glen Morgan, and James
Wong, the latter two being writers for the T.V. series "The X-Files," is a
movie with wonderful ideas, and executes them effortlessly.  It's rare a film
of this nature can grab an audience's attention these days, as the genre has
seem to be completely worn outâ€`But "Final Destination" has more in store for
one than one can imagine.</P>
<P>Unlike "Halloween"'s Michael Myers or "Nightmare on Elm Street"'s Freddy
Kruger, "Final Destination"'s killer is of the supernatural, the dark one
himself, death.  The intriguing premise is as follows; A portion of a senior
class is set to travel by air to Paris for their class trip.  After boarding
the plane, one of the students, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) dreams of their
plane exploding into flames just after takeoff, killing everyone on board. 
Once waking up, Alex gets himself and six others off of that plane, all of who
seem to be rather confused by the entire happening.  Shortly after their
departure, the plane takes off, and guess what; It blows up in middair.  Now,
Alex, and fellow survivors, who consist of friend Clear Waters (Ali Larter),
enemy Carter (Kerr Smith), Carter's girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), the goofy
Billy (Sean William Scott) and his brother Tod (Chad Donella), and teacher, Ms.
Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke), are in extreme danger, as it seems they have
cheated death by getting off of that plane, and now death wants them.  The
number of survivors starts to peel back quite quickly as death goes around
offing those who got off the planeâ€`But who is next, and how will death get
them?</P>
<P>"Final Destination" is a film that is unbearably suspenseful; always making the
viewer frantic, as death will strike in the most unlikely of times.  John
Denver's "Rocky Mountain High" being played pretty much warrants another
deathâ€`Everyone on that plane learned the hard way.  Although it's usually
given whose life will be taken next, the intensity and unpredictability of the
film never fades, because you don't know when death is coming.  Like the
characters in the movie, I was constantly nervous and shaky during "Final
Destination".  The slightest noise or movement nearby would send me a mile into
the airâ€` And yes, the film is that intense.</P>
<P>The cast is surprisingly effective and up to par; the best ensemble in this
genre since "Scream."  The characters have multi-dimensional personalities for
a change, and for the most part, you highly sympathize with them once death
starts to come their way.  Devon Sawa and Ali Larter are the main focus of the
film, and both actors follow up their well written characters with even better
performances, that, like the "Scream" movies did for their cast, will launch
them into superstardom.  Kerr Smith and Kristen Cloke are also impressive,
although the two don't posses as much screen time as the leads.</P>
<P>"Final Destination" is one exhilarating, exciting ride.  Any age should be able
to enjoy the complexity and eeriness of the film, and should find an edge to it
that most slasher films lack.  For the blood loving moviegoer, "Destination"
contains buckets of blood, guts, and all that good stuff.  "Final Destination"
is a film that is destined to become a cult classic among horror fans, and a
sleeper hit at the box office.  Hands down to the first film in years that has
actually scared me.  By scare, I don't mean making me jump, or making me wonder
if I'm in danger, but by scare I mean a film that stays locked in your mind,
absorbing you, leaving one question that's constantly on your mind:  Is death
coming for me? </P>
<P>The Bottom Line: Make "Final Destination" your destination.</P>
