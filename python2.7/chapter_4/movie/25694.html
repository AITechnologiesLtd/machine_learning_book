"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>For starters, there isn't a character named Steve in The Tao of Steve.
The title refers to a less-than-spiritual way of trying to bed women who
wouldn't ordinarily give a guy the time of day.  The titular Steve isn't
one particular Steve, but rather a blend of cool Steves (like McQueen
and Austin…but definitely not Guttenburg).  Armed with a simple phrase
(`We pursue that which retreats from us'), the Tao's followers pride
themselves on their ability to score by simply acting uninterested in
scoring.</P>
<P>After a clever opening, where a book titled `The Tao of Steve' is shown
on a bookshelf beside Plato, Aquinas and Dante, we meet Dex (Donal
Logue, The Patriot), a chain-smoking, part-time kindergarten teacher who
rides a motorcycle like Steve McQueen in The Great Escape.  Dex is fat
like the Buddah which rests on the headboard of his bed and, between
breakfast bong hits, the fast-talking philosophizer maintains an affair
with his friend's wife.</P>
<P>Despite these qualities (or lack thereof), Dex is still able to
sweet-talk the ladies, as evidenced by his ten-year college reunion,
where he chats up a former classmate named Syd (Greer Goodman) and goes
home with a nubile student bartender (Dana Goodman).  But Dex can't seem
to shake the image of Syd, who is in town temporarily working as a set
designer for a Santa Fe opera production.   Before long, Dex is hanging
around Syd more and more, and the two even begin to carpool after his
motorcycle breaks down.</P>
<P>If you haven't figured out the plot yet, you may be a stroke victim.
Dex is a modern-day Don Giovanni who sleeps with thousands of women
because he's afraid he'll never find true love.  When he finds it in
Syd, Dex is forced to abandon his own beliefs and attitude toward the
opposite sex, turning himself into the lovesick loser that he used to
openly mock.</P>
<P>Steve is garnering heaps of critical praise, but that shouldn't be a
surprise to anyone.  Most film critics are lazy, self-centered
egomaniacs who aren't exactly beating off women with sticks (myself
included), so the idea of a slovenly know-it-all who can score with
chicks by not trying plays like the feel good film of the year (you can
use the same rationale to explain American Beauty's critical success
last year).  Logue, who won a Special Jury Award at this year's Sundance
Film Festival, is fantastic as Dex, but I sure hope he used a fake tummy
for his performance.</P>
<P>Visually, Steve features bright, vivid colors in the beautifully shot
(by Teodoro Maniaci, Smoke) interior and exterior Santa Fe scenes.  The
sky is always a perfect blue, and the sunsets are always amazing.  If
Steve were a bigger film, I'd almost expect Santa Fe's population to
double in the next year.  It looks that incredible.  If Steve's beauty
doesn't sell you on Santa Fe, maybe All the Pretty Horses will.  The
Billy Bob Thornton film, which was also shot in the New Mexico city,
will hit theatres at the end of this year.</P>
<P>Steve is the directorial debut of Jenniphr Goodman, who co-wrote the
screenplay with her sister Greer (the one who plays Syd) and Duncan
North.  If you look closely at the closing credits, they suggest the
film is based on North's life.  The film is well directed for a
first-timer, and the script is full of witty, intellectual banter that
made me wonder if people really talk like this.  At times, the
characters sound like they just stepped off the set of Dawson's Creek.</P>
