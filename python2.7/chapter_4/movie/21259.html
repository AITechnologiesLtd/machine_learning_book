PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></PRE>
<P>In the good old days it used to take television stars years to make the
big move to the silver screen, and this film is a prime example of why.
It's one thing to repeat your catch phrase or to raise your eyebrow and
wait for the studio audience's laughter to subside for twenty-three
minutes, but entirely another thing to stretch your already marginal
appeal into a feature-length film.  Ever since Helen Hunt won an Oscar
while still starring in a failing television sitcom, Hollywood has tried
to mine talent from the lesser medium.  This should be seen as a
disturbing trend, since sitcom producers seem to only create shows
around vaguely capable one-trick ponies in a rehash of their stand-up
routines.</P>
<P>In Three to Tango, there are not one, not two, but three leads that
still are on the silver screen's ugly stepchild.  It's a mish-mash of a
‘30s screwball comedy and a traditional love triangle, with a gay twist
for the ‘90s.  The story isn't anything new – a wealthy man (Dylan
McDermott) doesn't trust his girlfriend (Neve Campbell) while he isn't
around, finds a non-threatening guy (Matthew Perry) to keep her company,
and is surprised when the two fall in love.</P>
<P>McDermott (The Practice) plays Charles Newman, a married business tycoon
that has been placed in charge of hiring an architecture team to oversee
a prestigious $90 million museum restoration project in downtown
Chicago.  As the film opens we see that there are two design teams vying
for the illustrious undertaking – the upscale firm of Strauss & Decker
(respectively Bob Balaban, Jakob the Liar and John C. McGinley, Office
Space) and the protagonist upstarts Oscar Novak (Perry, Friends) and
Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt, Lake Placid).  Strauss and Decker bat
first, dazzling Newman with both a big-budget presentation and
accusations that their competitors are homosexuals.  Although their
display isn't quite as mind-blowing, Newman likes Novak and Steinberg
enough to hold a showdown between the two partnerships, with the creator
of the best model declared the winner of the project.</P>
<P>Enter Amy (Campbell, Party of Five), Newman's girlfriend deemed
untrustworthy by him.  Since he thinks Novak is gay, Newman asks him to
look after Amy and to make sure she doesn't become involved with any
other men.  Since his career is in Newman's hands, the nebbish Novak
agrees, despite his obvious attraction to her.  Once he begins to fall
in love with Amy, Novak's alleged alternative lifestyle becomes public
news as he is featured in a newspaper article titled `Proud to be Gay.'</P>
<P>You can figure the rest out on your own – Amy thinks Novak is gay, so
she changes in front of him and tells him all of her secrets and
desires.  They share many close, private moments, like simultaneously
vomiting up bad tuna melts.  But Novak just sits there and looks like a
lizard with a bad haircut.  The film's gay stereotypes are unimaginative
and probably offensive as well, with the audience likely questioning the
sexuality of each character.  Who is?  Who isn't?  Who cares?  Although
the film is advertised with three leads, McDermott's character all but
disappears for a good portion of the film.  And by `good portion,' I
don't mean the good part.  I mean the majority part.</P>
<P>Campbell's performance is almost refreshing, compared to her bland roles
in the Scream trilogy and the moody Julia on P.O.F.  Her squeaky voice
seems about two octaves higher than usual and conjures up memories of
former Fox Wednesday night co-star Jennie Garth as she tries to sound
sexy by making cute little bunny noises.  Perry is basically Chandler on
a really bad hair day and McDermott is practically invisible, leaving me
to wish there was more Oliver Platt in the film.</P>
<P>If you look at the track record of the film's stars, this disappointing
result won't be a surprise.  Perry's two films, Almost Heroes and Fools
Rush In, grossed less than what he makes for one episode of Friends.
McDermott is even worse, and his previous two movies, 'Til There was You
and Destiny Turns on the Radio, performed even more poorly.  On the
other hand, Campbell made more than both combined for figuratively
dining on tuna melt in Wild Things, not to mention starring in the
blockbuster Scream flicks.  But she's hardly box office gold on her own
(read: without either a hot script or a hot lesbian scene).</P>
<P>There is one scene where Amy and Novak discuss the use of the line
`Let's get outta here' in modern cinema, deciding that that could be the
response to just about any line delivered by any actor at any point in
any movie.  I also used this line as a suggestion to everybody sitting
around me after about twenty minutes of Tango.</P>
<P>1:55 - PG-13 for sex-related situations and language</P>
