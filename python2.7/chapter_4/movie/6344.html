<P>BREAKING THE WAVES, the powerful new movie from Danish
director Lars von Trier (ZENTROPA, THE KINGDOM) is as
daunting as it is satisfying. The satisfaction comes from von
Trier's audacious and ever-deepening sense for filmmaking --
BREAKING THE WAVES is his most ambitious and skillfully drawn
narrative so far, and it offers the pleasure of undertaking
an uncertain journey, unsure of where it might all end.
That's also what's daunting. BREAKING THE WAVES is epic in
scope, careering wildly from warm and fleshy love story to
grim tragedy to something else entirely over the course of
its 158 minutes. It's a film that demands your rapt attention
bit by bit, plumbing ever-deeper corners of the soul and
plunging at one point into the abyss. Finally, once it's
over, it will return day by day to haunt its audiences. This
is seriously nervy filmmaking.</P>
<P>BREAKING THE WAVES derives its truest power from Emily
Watson's fevered performance in the lead. Watson makes her
film debut as Bess, a young woman in a small Scottish village
who's getting married to Jan, a strapping oil-rig worker, as
the movie begins. The union is looked on with disapproval by
the Presbyterian village elders, who muzzle women's voices in
church and take their greatest apparent satisfaction in
consigning sinners to damnation. To the villagers, Bess is a
suitable case for treatment, an emotional basket case in a
community that prides itself on restraint. But Bess is
determined to marry, and the post-wedding scenes detail her
giddy sexual awakening in explicit yet gentle detail. With
Jan, she has found happiness.</P>
<P>It's not long before Jan is called back to sea, and Bess
lives in dread of the day that he will leave. She can't help
herself -- just before Jan's airborne, she cries out in pain
and rushes the helicopter, pulling the hatch open to take one
last look at her beloved. In another scene, Bess waits all
day beside a country road in the rain, under cover of the
telephone booth where she has arranged to receive Jan's phone
call. The erotically charged conversation is testimony to her
newfound comfort and maturity. She's a woman who takes the
most profound and life-affirming satisfaction in sexual
pleasure, and she prays to God for Jan's swift return. The
prayer is answered -- Jan is clocked on the head by a piece
of heavy equipment and returns to the village on a stretcher,
paralyzed.</P>
<P>Bess blames herself, believing that her prayers are
responsible for Jan's horrible misfortune. Upset that he
can't make love to her, Jan instructs his wife not to dress
in tight clothing, lest he be too aware of her body, out of
reach. And then he tells her she must have sex with other men
so that she can return to his bed and recount her lovemaking
to him -- in this way, he insists, he can be reminded of her
sexuality and his otherwise worthless life can be saved.</P>
<P>We get the distinct feeling that while Bess is nothing but
sincere in her devotion to her husband, Jan's motivations are
at best misguided and at worst downright malevolent.
Ostensibly, he's trying to give her life back to her, but how
could he be unaware of the pain his demands cause her?
Moreover, how can he stand to direct his beloved to debase
herself by, say, sitting next to a 50-year-old stranger at
the back of a bus and giving him a hand job? Or by making a
clumsy, naked pass at Jan's doctor? Still, Jan's condition is
seen to improve as Bess puts out, and that's reason enough
for her to clothe herself in the borrowed trappings of a
cheap whore.</P>
<P>Is this beginning to sound ridiculous, like the thinly
constructed plot of a softcore porn movie on late night cable
TV? Von Trier dares to walk that line, and such is his skill
and conviction that he staves off the inherent tawdriness of
such a concept and invests it with a fierce gravity.
Stylistically, BREAKING THE WAVES has a lot in common with
the director's television project, THE KINGDOM. In his
breakthrough, ZENTROPA, von Trier used every optical trick in
the book to create a highly stylized world -- replete with
rear-projection effects and process shots -- that was more
memorable for its visual impact than for its overreaching
characterization and narrative. But THE KINGDOM was a marvel,
a four-and-a-half hour ghost story that seemed to pass in
little more than a moment. Propelled by a fitful documentary
film style and a picture drained of most color and detail,
THE KINGDOM's supernatural pretensions were validated and
even amplified by a mood that felt like cinema verite.</P>
<P>BREAKING THE WAVES takes much greater risks, and
cinematographer Robbie Mueller (PARIS, TEXAS) was obviously
directed to take a similar approach. The film's bleak look is
reminiscent of THE KINGDOM's -- both were shot on film,
transferred to video and then back to film again, which
leeched out color and detail and imbued the image with an
odd, nearly ethereal quality -- but where THE KINGDOM took
place mostly within the institutional confines of a single
building, BREAKING THE WAVES allows that highly processed,
unnatural patina to infect a village, a countryside, and
indeed the whole world. In this bleak context, Muller, whose
extensive work with Wim Wenders is justly admired, showcases
the fine naturalistic portrayals of the characters peopling
that dim vista. If the bleak imagery represents von Trier's
intellectual guidance, in the rhythm of the camerawork and
the editing we can feel the movie's heartbeat.</P>
<P>And when Mueller's camera hovers for long moments in front of
Emily Watson's face, it finds the movie's soul. Hers is one
of those rare performances that it's impossible to
overpraise. The relationship between Watson and the camera is
reminiscent of nothing so much as the cold and exacting gaze
that delineates Renee Falconetti's monumental performance in
Carl Theodor Dreyer's THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC (perhaps
significantly; like Saint Joan, Bess is more or less accused
of heresy). The character of Bess becomes inarguably flesh,
and Watson inhabits that flesh with preternatural aplomb.
With wide, round eyes and slim lips the dark shade of blood,
there's nothing vague about Watson's emoting. Her feelings
are communicated with a precision that can be charming, as
when those lips curl near the cheek to puff a strand of hair
out of her eyes, or wrenching, as when her shriek suddenly
pierces the movie's uncommon quiet. Her marriage has
transformed her suddenly from virgin into a woman of full
sexuality whose very essence seems saturated with pleasure by
the act of lovemaking. (Helena Bonham Carter, who could
hardly be so unspoiled a presence, reportedly won the role of
Bess and then turned it down.) Even when she's carrying on a
two-way conversation with God -- or on those occasions where
she glances directly at the camera -- the character is never
overplayed, and our understanding of Bess is key to our
willingness to follow her on what seems to be rather a
dispiriting journey.</P>
<P>The performances are, in fact, uniformly excellent. The beefy
Stellan Skargaard plays Jan as an imperfect yet admirable
husband, the kind of robust fellow who can truly demand your
sympathy when he's laid up in a hospital bed. His playful
physicality in the early scenes is key to the rest of his
performance, since we need something to remember him by once
he's supine and under the influence of drugs and depression.
And Katrin Cartlidge as Bess's loving sister Dodo, who's at
all times wary of Jan's influence, is the essential
intellectual bridge between the outcast Bess and the rest of
this fundamentalist community. Von Trier's heroine is a Good
Woman, but Dodo helps remind us that her selflessness isn't
wholly admirable, or rational.</P>
<P>That having been said, the real crux of BREAKING THE WAVES is
a circumstance which can't be revealed in a movie review.
Let's just say that once the narrative concludes, von Trier
gives us an "epilogue" that confounds all expectations. The
last moments of this film are by far the most challenging,
and after some reflection I've decided that without them --
the final shot in particular -- BREAKING THE WAVES would
simply be an extraordinary film. As is, it's a great one.
Without resort to mere words, von Trier breaks the bounds of
narrative and presents a resolution that's as troublesome as
it is fulfilling. In a bold refutation of its own grim,
nearly sardonic logic, BREAKING THE WAVES cuts to the quick
of religious faith, personal sacrifice, and human existence.</P>
