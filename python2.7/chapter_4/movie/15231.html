<P>Hours after viewing the sweet reflective fantasy, "Meet Joe Black," my 
thoughts drifted to the TV series "Star Trek: The Next Generation," with 
which the film shares structural and thematic similarities. Like "ST:TNG,
" the production flips back and forth between its "A" and "B" storylines. 
If "Meet Joe Black" were an episode of "ST:TNG," the plot summary would 
read like this: Following an encounter with a mysterious alien, Captain 
Picard takes a hard look at his own mortality and begins to put his life 
affairs in order. Meanwhile, the android Data makes a concentrated effort 
to learn what it's really like to be human.</P>
<P>In many ways, "Meet Joe Black" plays like an exceptionally opulent, and 
extremely long, episode of "Star Trek: The Next Generation." Both 
entertaining works star distinguished British actors and convey a 
positive message in imaginative fashion. Both feature an idealized 
extended family and unusually literate dialogue. And both productions, 
while charming, are sometimes overly formal and a bit full of themselves. </P>
<P>Based very loosely on the stodgy chestnut, "Death Takes a Holiday," "Meet 
Joe Black" introduces William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), a media tycoon 
days away from his 65th birthday when he begins to hear a disembodied 
voice. Death (Brad Pitt) has come to collect Parrish, but the specter has 
a proposition. Having appropriated the body of a young stud muffin, Death 
wants to learn about the human experience and would like Parrish to be 
his guide. If the elderly man cooperates, his life will be extended; by 
days, maybe even weeks -- as long as it takes for Death to accomplish the 
goals of his field trip. Parrish agrees and introduces the omnipotent 
figure to the family as Joe Black ("If I say who you are," Parrish gently 
explains, "I don't think anyone will stay for dinner").</P>
<P>Joe becomes a constant in Parrish's life, to the consternation of his 
ambitious second-in-command, Drew (Jake Weber), and the confusion of 
Parrish's number one daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani). The young 
physician, romantically involved with Drew, had a brief, but memorable, 
encounter with the body Joe now inhabits, and finds herself drawn to this 
beautiful, otherworldly man.  </P>
<P>Like "Heaven Can Wait," another romantic fantasy dealing with life beyond 
death, "Meet Joe Black" features a business magnate making pronouncements 
that baffle his board of directors, while scheming underlings work 
against him. Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as William Parrish, creating a 
rich, warm gentleman of great compassion and dignity. Joe tells him "I 
chose you [as his guide] for your verve, your excellence and your ability 
to instruct. You've led a first-rate life." Thanks to Hopkins' great 
skills, you never for a moment question the wisdom of Joe's decision.</P>
<P>The film's best moments are quiet ones as Parrish prepares to leave this 
world. There is a moving exchange between him and daughter Allison 
(Marcia Gay Harden), who has spent weeks arranging an incredibly lavish 
birthday party for her father. She softly tells him that she understands 
that Susan is his favorite, and that's all right, because she knows how 
much her father loves her as well. Harden is excellent, but watch Hopkins 
during the conversation. He conveys more through minute facial 
expressions than most actors could do with elaborate speeches.</P>
<P>Brad Pitt receives equal time, but his is the less satisfying of the two 
storylines. The learning-what-it's-like-to-be-human tale has been told 
many times before, by everyone from Jeff Bridges in "Starman" to Brent 
Spiner in "Star Trek." Like those actors, Pitt adopts stiff mannerisms to 
convey the sense of an alien being mimicking human behavior. His 
performance is sincere, if at times too mannered and precious. Thankfully,
 he gets better as the film proceeds and his character grows more 
comfortable with his form. </P>
<P>Pitt is prettier than any of the women in the cast and his impossibly 
good looks are sometimes distracting. I found myself wondering how, if 
Joe needed help fixing his tie, he was able to keep his hair looking oh-
so-perfect. Apparently, mousse is much easier to manage than neckties. 
There are inconsistencies in his language skills as well. Early in the 
film, Joe doesn't understand a number of ordinary words and phrases, but 
seems nicely versed in contemporary slang. </P>
<P>Claire Forlani is fine as Susan. Her mannerisms and wispy inflection 
remind me of a young Dianne Wiest. Marcia Gay Harden is even better as 
Allison and the always-reliable Jeffrey Tambor gives a good performance 
as Quince, Allison's well-intentioned, bumbling husband. As Drew, Jake 
Weber is appropriately prickly, although it's hard to fathom why Parrish 
wouldn't recognize his obvious bad intentions. And Lois Kelly-Miller is 
stirring playing a gravely-ill Jamaican woman who recognizes Joe Black 
for what he really is.</P>
<P>Clocking in at just under three hours, "Meet Joe Black" is a little too 
leisurely. The film would have benefited from some edits during the mid-
section of the story, which sags a bit. To its credit, the production 
recovers nicely, building to a romantic climax at the birthday party to 
end all birthday parties, with a lavish fireworks display providing the 
backdrop for the film's final scenes. </P>
<P>"Meet Joe Black" is the kind of film that initially feels profound, but 
on later reflection has less substance than its sumptuous presentation 
indicates. Still, the story provides a lot of reasoned, thoughtful 
moments, with Anthony Hopkins delivering the lion's share of the rewards. 
It was nice to meet Joe Black, but much more satisfying to meet William 
Parrish.</P>
