<PRE>Gang Related - Tough yet Smart
by Homer Yen
(c) 1997</PRE>
<P>On the big screen, police in the big city are a corrupt breed.  They
unfairly wield their powers to exact their own self-righteous brand of
punishment, assuming the role of judge, jury and executioner.  These
themes were recently played out in the well-received Copland and the
entertainingly artsy LA Confidential.  Here, in this undermarketed film,
the writers revisit this theme, but the movie is not some lush,
cinematographic presentation, coated with heavy ambiance.  Rather, it
strips away the artistic fluff to give us a gritty look at two bad cops
desperately trying to dig themselves out of a situation gone bad.</P>
<P>Jim Belushi plays Detective DiVinci, a morally deprived, self-centered,
and prototypical 'bad cop.'  He has bad taste in clothes, a penchant to
use the "F" word whenever possible, a bad attitude, and a corrupt soul.
His partner in crime and punishment is Rodriguez (the late Tupac
Shakur), who is more reserved and slowly develops a bad taste for the
killings.  Their scam is simple, yet deadly.  These two sell drugs to
dealers.  But once the exchange is made, the cops kill the buyer, take
back the drugs to sell to someone else, and pockets the money.  The
murders are meant to seem gang-related.  They see nothing wrong in
taking the spoils of their quarry.  In their eyes, slaying drug dealers
reduces crime while making them rich.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the victim of their latest killing is an undercover DEA
agent, which immediately brings a large investigation into the faces of
DiVinci and Rodriguez.  They work quickly to deflect their guilt.  They
manipulate the evidence, look for scapegoats, falsify claims, and then
uses the flag of authority to cover their tracks.  But with each
cleverly calculated move, a surprise sets them back.  Things become
steadily more interesting as the two cops in charge of finding
themselves must find a way out.</P>
<P>This film does well to offer pure drama, although the dialogue is quite
raw.  It didn't cheat us with car chases, explosions, or ridiculous body
counts.  The writer-director, Jim Kouf, has a good story to tell and
makes it affecting.   Shakur exudes an appealingly fragile charisma as
the conscious-stricken cop.  As he continues to question the path that
they are on., he begins to stray away from their partnership.  Belushi
is also quite good as his ever-growing sleazy counterpart.  As the
situation gets more and more out of control, we see the chaos that
springs from vigilantism and we feel the tensions that surround a
partnership under extreme duress.  Nonetheless, DiVinci continues on
with his amoral pep talks, which further alienates his partner.  We are
not only treated to an engrossing psychological war displayed between
these two, but are also rewarded with a clever sequence of events where
the two cops try to maneuver out of their guilt.  I was satisfied with
the way the story stayed focused on the frailties of human nature.
You'll find that this film offers no heroes nor villains.  In some
well-told stories, they're actually one in the same.</P>
