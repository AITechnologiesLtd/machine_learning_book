<PRE>UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN</PRE>
<P>Jean-Claude's best days are behind him.  Way behind him.  The former
martial arts champion is now graying at the temples, and he still hasn't
improved on his English accent.  Of course, his acting skills -- in the
traditional sense of dialogue and mannerisms -- have never given us
sufficient reason to watch his movies, but when his physical
capabilities start to deteriorate, you know he's in trouble.</P>
<P>So what do you do when your star loses his signature appeal?  UNIVERSAL
SOLDIER: THE RETURN attempts to turn him into a sort of James Bond,
allowing him to rely on high tech stunts and clever intuition rather
than pure power.  The problem is that nobody wants Van Damme when we've
already got Arnold, Pierce Brosnan, and even Sly Stallone as kings of
the one-liner action flicks.  So the formula is set: a limited budget, a
fallible star, and Goldberg, the WCW wrestler, as your ominous villain.
The result is a predictably lackluster flick.</P>
<P>RETURN is the story of SETH, the uncontrollable mainframe computer, who
has ordered the practically invincible UNISOL soldiers on a wild killing
spree.  Can Jean-Claude stop them? You'll have to rent it to find out
for yourself, but I'll tell you that Jean-Claude only does his famous
reverse aerial roundhouse kick to the face once.</P>
<P>If you're looking for a few cool fight scenes or some cheeseball special
effects for a mind numbing evening then check it out.  Otherwise, you'd
be better off with some of JC's other combat movies like KICKBOXER or
BLOOD SPORT.</P>
<PRE>2 stars</PRE>
