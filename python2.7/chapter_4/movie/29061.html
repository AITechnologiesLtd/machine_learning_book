<PRE>ORIGINAL SIN
A film review by James Brundage
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Depending on who you ask, the original sin was either the eating of the
apple, the act of disobedience against God, or the act of betrayal.  But
in case you didn't know this, don't bother remembering it... the words
"original sin" never come up in the movie of the same name, let alone
the concept of it.  The closest the film even gets to Catholicism is in
its narrative (the story is told by Angelina Jolie to her priest while
on death row in Cuba, circa 1900).</P>
<P>Regardless of its senseless title, Original Sin does actually have a
plot (albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since The Art
of War, based on the book Waltz Across Darkness).  Boy (Antionio
Banderas) places personal ad sometime around 1900, searching for a
wife.  Since this is a century ago, we narrowly dodge a remake of Green
Card, only to find that the Girl (Jolie) faked her photo and is actually
beautiful.  Skipping a few moderately useless sex scenes (getting the
question out of the way, yes, we get to see Angelina Jolie's breasts
again), the Girl turns out to be a con artist, swindles Boy for his
money, and heads for the hills.</P>
<P>Original Sin then briefly tries to be a thriller.  We see Boy go
whore-chasing, saying he wants to find Girl and kill her.  But as soon
as Boy actually finds Girl, instead of following what might have been a
promising (or at least not completely fucking boring) thriller, the film
degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin/whore complex since
Milk Money.  Girl toys with the idea of reforming her con-girl past, all
the while avoiding the "other man," a lover that keeps making her start
these scams in the first place.</P>
<P>Add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in
cinematic history (literally half of the film is either in slow motion
or uses a strobe effect), and acting roughly the caliber of a B.B. gun,
and Original Sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer,
definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year.</P>
<P>Don't even bother with Original Sin, but if you do go, be honest with
yourself and admit its pure sex appeal.  Just keep in mind that although
this film may not be the most original on the block, it's much worse
than a sin.  This is sacrilege.</P>
