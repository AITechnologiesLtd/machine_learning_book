<PRE>                        JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        The commercials announce, "Jackie Chan fights for 
America..." Yeah, even though Jackie Chan's never been to 
America and this movie was made in Hong Kong. FIRST STRIKE 
is an accurate title for this movie, which isn't nearly as good as 
RUMBLE IN THE BRONX. Two more movies like this and he may 
indeed strike out in America. I saw this one the week after its 
release and there were only twenty people in the theater. METRO, 
which opened the same day as FIRST STRIKE, was packed. 
Moviegoers in this hemisphere apparently prefer people who 
speak their language.</P>
<P>        Jackie Chan movies are like porno movies. There's one 
attraction and everyone knows what it is, but you have to sit 
through a bunch of poorly-written dialogue and bad acting to get 
to the good stuff. It's a good thing Chan is a master at what he 
does. The action sequences in his movies are always amazing, 
more so because all the stunts are real -- no blue screens and 
no stuntmen. The actors are the stuntmen, and they do a much 
better job with the stunts than the acting.</P>
<P>        The plot this time is a continuation of the POLICE STORY 
series (which previously brought us the English-dubbed SUPERCOP), 
with Chan working for the Hong Kong government to follow a 
woman to the Ukraine. Her brother has a nuclear device and 
everyone wants it, including the new KGB, not nearly as cagey 
as before. Midway through the movie, Chan's own organization 
turns on him and he has no one to turn to when framed for the 
murder.</P>
<P>        The plot is always convoluted in these movies, and 
always a mere accessory to set up the action, so forgive me if 
I screwed up the details. All you need to know is Chan's the 
good guy and everyone he fights with is the bad guy. As 
always, there's a beautiful Asian woman to protect, only this 
time the woman doesn't get into the act by doing any of the 
action herself. As an employee of UnderWater World (the 
sister theme park of Under Dances With Wolves), she does 
provide the setting for the movie's climactic fight sequence.</P>
<P>        There are four main action sequences in the movie. 
The first comes in the Ukraine with a combination snowmobile / 
snowboard chase that ends with Chan falling from a helicopter 
into an icy river. Next is the Australia scene in which Chan 
is on vacation and two burly men visit his hotel room, followed 
shortly by Chan fending off a school of black belts with a table 
and a step ladder (the best scene in the movie) and the climax 
at UnderWater World, involving sharks, stingrays and a bunch 
of bad guys in wetsuits.</P>
<P>        It's like a real-life James Bond movie because Chan 
and everyone else is doing everything onscreen with no special 
effects. Every Jackie Chan action sequence is eye-popping; 
it's the rest of the movie that seems unbearable. What the 
world needs is an all-action Chan movie with no plot -- a 
greatest hits package, maybe. I mean, my God, the man's 
starred in at least twenty movies. That would improve his 
standing with American audiences, because we all know Chan 
could beat up Arnold, Stallone, Van Damme and the rest using 
only two fingers on his left hand.</P>
