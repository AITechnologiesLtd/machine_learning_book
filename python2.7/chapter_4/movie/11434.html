<PRE>Big Lebowski, The (1998)
3/09/97</PRE>
<P>        Usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug,  but not THE
BIG LEBOWSKI.  The new offering from the creators of 1996's critical hit
FARGO, is to say the least, wildly entertaining. Originality has always
been a strong trait in the Coen Brother's movies, and THE BIG LEBOWSKI is
insanely original.  </P>
<P>        It begins oddly enough when Jeff "The Dude" Lebowski(Jeff Bridges) is
mistaken for a millionaire, Jeff "The Big" Lebowski(David Huddleston),
who's wife, Bunny(Tara Reid) owes money all over town. Two goons,  out to
collect on Bunny's debt break into Dude's house. They attempt to collect
the money that Bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug. The
next day Dude explains his situation to his bowling team(Steve Buscemi &
John Goodman, respectively.) He is advised to go to the Big Lebowski and
get him to pay for the defiled rug.  He does this, and shortly after gets
tied up in a kidnapping caper. </P>
<P>        This is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments. The Coen
brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly.
Also several great supporting roles, John Turturro as a child molesting
bowler named Jesus. The Coen's script plays off perfectly and it all goes
together to make it extremely entertaining. I doubt this movie will be
nearly as popular as FARGO, but its off the wall moments make it so far the
best of 1998. If you like anything else the Coen brothers have done you
will love this one, if not they give this one a try its a little different.</P>
