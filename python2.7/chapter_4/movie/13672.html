<P>     Sometimes it's obvious that a film isn't about the plot, it's about
the names above the title.  COCKTAIL was no more a coming-of-age story
than it was a geopolitical thriller; it was about Tom Cruise smiling and
mixing drinks.  UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL was about as interested in
journalistic ethics as the National Enquirer; it was really about Robert
Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer sharing soft-focus love scenes.  And could
you differentiate between any two non-TERMINATOR Schwarzenegger action
films with a gun to your head?  For better or for worse -- more often the
latter, contemporary Hollywood films often sell personalities rather than
stories.</P>
<P>     If you watched commercials or previews for THE NEGOTIATOR closely
enough, you'd realize that Warner Bros. isn't selling us a story about a
veteran Chicago hostage negotiator named Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson)
who takes hostages in a police building after he's framed for insurance
fraud and the murder of his partner (Paul Guilfoyle).  It's not about the
cool negotiator named Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey) whom Roman demands as
his police liaison.  No, THE NEGOTIATOR is about a showdown between
Jackson and Spacey, two actors whose intensity and burning intelligence
make them magnetically watchable.  Even with theatrical trailers awash in
spraying bullets and shattering glass, you expect that the real warfare
will be psychological, a chess match as much between Jackson and Spacey as
between the characters they play.</P>
<P>     If THE NEGOTIATOR had delivered on that promise, it would have been
one of those rare exceptions where a "personality plot" would have been
the right choice.  You just know it's headed in the wrong direction when
it becomes clear how much time will be spent figuring out who's behind the
police conspiracy to set up Roman.  Is it internal affairs inspector
Niebaum (the late J. T. Walsh)?  Grandfatherly Commander Frost (Ron
Rifkin)?  Hard-nosed Commander Beck (David Morse)?  Mission chief Travis
(John Spencer)?  Will the mysterious informant turn up?  Will computer
files tell all?</P>
<P>     Who cares?  For all the sound and fury surrounding both the
conspiracy and the attempts to take Roman by force, THE NEGOTIATOR is
built on the clash of two characters who win not by shooting faster, but
by thinking faster, by turning words into their most effective weapons.
Jackson and Spacey take the two similar roles and turn them into distinct
individuals so deftly that the slices of family life provided as
back-story seem embarrassingly clumsy by contrast.  In Jackson's hands,
Roman is less a super-cop on a quest for justice than he is an arrogant
super-star who can't believe he's being treated like an ordinary citizen.
The flicker of instability which makes it possible to believe he'd kill
contrasts perfectly with the icy resolve of Spacey's Sabian.  When those
two characters lock wits and eyes, each struggling to size the other up
and determine whether he's an ally or an adversary, THE NEGOTIATOR is
compelling stuff.</P>
<P>     Those moments just don't come nearly often enough.  Spacey doesn't
make his first appearance until nearly 45 minutes have passed, leaving
plenty of time for the film to detour onto well-worn action-suspense
avenues.  Though Paul Giamatti (fast becoming the most recognizable
unknown actor in movies) provides solid comic relief as a con artist among
Roman's hostages, even the one-liners further emphasize that this drama
really isn't anything special.  It could have been and should have been
more than another DIE HARD clone, more than an over-long mystery where you
begin to feel you should leave as soon as you figure out the real bad guy.
THE NEGOTIATOR should have played to the strength of its cast, with more
scenes of Roman reducing his colleagues to blubbering bowls of putting, or
Sabian taking control of a room with the force of his confidence.  It's a
disappointing reverse-tease:  with two great stars to show off, it has the
nerve to go and offer us a plot.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 intensive negotiations:  5.</PRE>
