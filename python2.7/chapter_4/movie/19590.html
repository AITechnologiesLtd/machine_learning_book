<P>_The_Haunting_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)</P>
<P>        I never thought I'd see the day when Lili Taylor would carry a
big-budget, big studio summer blockbuster wannabe.  But here she is, the
indie queen herself, playing the lead in $80-million-plus _The_Haunting_.
 One could be led to believe that Taylor's surprising involvement would
indicate a popcorn film that manages to blend the best of the worlds of
art and commerce.  Alas, this all-flash, no-substance--and no
_scare_--thriller is a textbook example of the soulless, money-burning
Hollywood hype products she had so valiantly rebelled against throughout
her entire career.  Hope you enjoyed cashing that paycheck, Miss Taylor.</P>
<P>        I suppose I could see why _The_Haunting_ attracted the attention of
talent such as Taylor and co-stars Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones. 
It's an adaptation of Shirley Jackson's novel
_The_Haunting_of_Hill_House_, which had been memorably adapted to screen,
also under the title _The_Haunting_, by Robert Wise in 1963.  Also, the
man at the helm is Jan DeBont, who made his directorial debut with one of
the best and most exciting action thrillers of the decade, 1994's
_Speed_.</P>
<P>        However, _The_Haunting_ continues a disturbing trend that has been
evidenced in DeBont's work since _Speed_: an emphasis on effects and
pyrotechnics over story.  He was able to get by with this approach on the
utterly-brainless-but-fun _Twister_, but it did not serve him well on the
misbegotten _Speed_2:_Cruise_Control_ and is certainly the case here. 
Granted, the storyline of _The_Haunting_ does play like a countdown to
the inevitable grand effects sequences.  Eleanor (Taylor), Theo
(Zeta-Jones), and Luke (Owen Wilson) agree to stay in the large, isolated
old New England mansion named Hill House for an insomnia study conducted
by psychologist Dr. David Marrow (Neeson).  Dr. Marrow, of course, has a
hidden agenda--it is not insomnia but fear he is interested in, and the
creaky, creepy Hill House provides the perfect venue.  But he and his
three test subjects--especially the frightened but fascinated
Eleanor--get more than they bargained for when things do more than go
bump in the night.</P>
<P>        This is when the special effects kick in and the film should kick into
gear.  The physical effects of the living sets, the digital effects used
for the various ghosts, and the sound effects that lends every bump its
boom are of the highest technical order.  But all the polish can't gloss
over one cold, hard fact: none of what the effects bring to life is the
slightest bit scary.  The eye candy is especially enticing, but audiences
are more likely to be in awe of their visual splendor than scream in
fright.  With no jolts nor a sense of a haunting atmosphere, the lapses
in logic in rookie screenwriter David Self's hole-ridden script are made
all the more clear.</P>
<P>        As safe as this trip in a haunted house is, there was one moment during
_The_Haunting_ where many the screening audience did jump in their seats
(some even screamed).  Did it have anything to do with one of those
digital phantoms?  No.  The "living" set design?  No.  What caught
viewers so off guard was... a basic prop skeleton, no more special than
any one you can see in a typical B-movie.  Isn't it nice to know that
these big Hollywood budgets are being used so effectively?</P>
