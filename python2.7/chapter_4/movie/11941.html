The Spanish Prisoner
Written and Directed by David Mamet
Starring: Campbell Scott, Steve Martin, Rebecca Pigeon, Ben Gazzara
Approx 120 min.</PRE>
<P>No one is what you think they are. That is the basis of The Spanish 
Prisoner, a new film by Pulitzer Prize winning playwright and sometime 
director David Mamet. This psychological thriller has the makings of a 
big-time, whamm-o production, but still comes off as a rather small, soon 
to be forgotten picture. Which is too bad because it has a lot of bright 
spots. Belive it, Steve Martin is a bad guy, a rich guy, and not too 
funny. He is the mystery man who charms his way into techno-inventor 
Campbell Scott's life, and attempts to ruin it.</P>
<P>Scott's character, Joe Ross, has made a brilliant invention for his 
company (the details of which we never learn) but begins to feel slighted 
that he will not be monetarily rewarded for it. As his disappointment 
grows he becomes entangled in a web of mystery that is spun by enigmatic 
millionaire Martin (Jimmy) and a secretary for the company, Susua, played 
by Rebecca Pigeon (writer/director Mamet's real-life bride).</P>
<P>The Spanish Prisoner begins to take on the feel of David Fincher's The 
Game, as the lead characters from both are surrounded by uncertainty (as 
is indeed the audience) and they lose control of the events in their 
lives. But Michael Douglas portrayed a sense of frustration and 
helplessness that Scott was either unable to, or instructed not to convey 
to the viewer. As things get more and more out of hand, I never saw pain, 
frustration or terror in Scott's face. Though it is a good performance, 
the strength of The Spanish Prisoner is found in the extremely "Mametian" 
script, the refreshing performance by Martin, and the suspense 
and mystery that I, personally, could not help but fall into.</P>
<P>There are, of course, a number of coincidental happenings that allow the 
story to continue, and they, as much as anything else, make the film 
completely unoriginal, but it still mangages to deliver. The devices are 
just crafty enough to make it work. But I have a feeling that you will 
need to go out and see The Spanish Prisoner rather soon if you want to 
catch it on the big screen. It just has that feel.</P>
