<P>Director Neil Jordan adapts the novel "Doll Eyes" into a film starring
Warren Beatty's wife, Annette Bening, Jordan's own acting alter-ego, Stephen
Rea, and the wonderboy of Hollywood excess, Robert Downey Jr. This film
takes another bloody stab at serial killers on film, and borrows hints of
other thrillers including the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREETS, PSYCHO (6/10), SEVEN
(8.5/10), KISS THE GIRLS (7/10) and THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (7.5/10).</P>
<P>PLOT:
Woman prophesizes grisly visions in her dreams which ultimately transfer
into real-life fatal occurrences. She believes that a serial killer is
raping her mind, and dropping these dreams into her head. Eventually, the
woman psychologically deteriorates into a basket-case, but keeps fighting to
maintain her weak grasp on reality, and discover the truth behind her
unbelievable psychic apparitions.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
I had a dream about this film. I dreamt that it would be a muddled
psychological mess, pureed into several sparks of slick style, incoherent
and unbelievable plotting, and a deja-vu feeling of a deja-vu. I felt as
though the movie would be unoriginal in many ways, including its standard
ending, which would be close to laughable. I felt as though the first 25
minutes of the film would set a decent tone with some original camera work,
and a nice creepy mood, but that the second half of the movie would just
fall apart, and adhere to the blueprint of all other standard bogeyman
movies. I also dreamt that Robert Downey Jr. would barely make an appearance
in the film, despite his mug showing up all over the trailers, and float
through his role without an ounce of dedication to the art of original
character.</P>
<P>The dream continued with visions of a movie that seemed to have the
potential to break through all the standard serial killer movie barriers,
but did nothing less that run through an uninspired story line, with a
fast-cut editing knife, flashbacks, and a host of symbolism slapped in for
amusement. The apparitions that I had, also failed to fully explain any of
the real motives or methods used by the serial killer, consequently
disallowing me from understanding, or even appreciating his character on any
well-developed level.</P>
<P>The dream also allowed me to somewhat appreciate fellow movie critic Gene
Siskel's constant rants on the over-abundance of serial killer movies in
Hollywood, in that I am also getting sick and tired of seeing the same
subject done to death, without any unique or creative perspective. Rule #1:
If you reaaaaally insist on making a serial killer movie, please make sure
that it ain't a retread of a dozen better ones. All in all, the dream ended
on a somber note that remarked upon the film's lack of novelty, casual use
of child murders as a prop for a badly developed script, some very cool
style, and an overly typical ending which explained very little about the
actual mind of the killer, or his capacity to make unreal things happen.</P>
<P>It was only then that the house lights went on, the credit crawl began its
march upscreen, and I realized that none of it was a dream after all. I
clicked and clicked my heels, but I was nowhere to go. It was my reality,
and my chump change wasted on this piece of cinematic repetitiveness, which
turned out to be more of a nightmare than any state of dream.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film was originally titled BLUE VISION.
Robert Downey Jr. lived with actress Sarah Jessica Parker for seven years
during the 1980's. She is now married to fellow actor Matthew Broderick.
Since August, 1996, Robert has been arrested for heroin possession, remanded
to a secure drug rehabilitation center, revoked probation after continued
drug use, jailed 180 days after violating parole and treated for a cut over
his nose, after getting into a fight with a prison inmate. In 1992, he was
nominated for an Oscar as Best Actor for his role as Charlie Chaplin in
CHAPLIN (8/10). Natch!
Director Neil Jordan has used actor Stephen Rea in his last six movie
productions.
Strangely enough, the co-writer of this mediocre script, Bruce Robinson,
also co-wrote one of my favourite films from 1998, RETURN TO PARADISE
(7.5/10), and wrote and directed the British cult classic, WITHNAIL AND I.
Actor Aidan Quinn was Paramount's first choice to play Jesus Christ in their
production of LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST before a storm of controversy forced
them to cancel their plans for the movie. Actor Willem Dafoe scooped up the
posh part, after Universal picked up the film. He has been happily married
to actress Elizabeth Bracco since 1987.
Annette Bening received $3million for her role in 1998's THE SIEGE (6.5/10).</P>
