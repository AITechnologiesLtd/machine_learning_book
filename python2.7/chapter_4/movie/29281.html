<P>JOHN CARPENTER'S GHOSTS OF MARS (2001) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring Ice Cube,
Natasha Henstridge, Jason Statham, Pam Grier, Joanna Cassidy and Clea Duvall.
Written by Larry Sulkis and John Carpenter. Music by John Carpenter. Directed by
Carpenter. Rated R. </P>
<P>The Red Planet runs redder in John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars. Those who enjoy
watching decapitations and body limbs being hacked off will go orgasmic over
this cartoonish piece of unoriginality. </P>
<P>This pulplike outing is sloppy and derivative, owing much to Carpenter's first
big hit, Assault on Precinct 13. </P>
<P>So many parts of this movie go haywire that finding a starting point is
difficult. First, Carpenter offers a crash course on Martian colonization,
explaining that the colonists established a matriarchal society. </P>
<P>This is merely a setup so the audience won't be shocked when they see female
cops bossing men around. Big deal. </P>
<P>Then, there's the confusing story structure. The film is told in flashback by
Lt. Ballard (Natasha Henstridge), the sole survivor of a team set to a distant
mining town to check on a disturbance and bring back and well-known criminal
named James "Desolation" Williams (Ice Cube), whose characterization is most
reminiscent of Carpenter's Napoleon Wilson from Precinct 13. </P>
<P>Cube's Williams even cribs some dialogue that is similar to lines spoken by
Wilson in the earlier flick. </P>
<P>It seems that every major character must be given his or her own flashback,
explaining events we are watching as they do voice overs. it becomes most
repetitious and boring. </P>
<P>Carpenter takes too long in building up the suspense, and the payoff is a big
let down. </P>
<P>The Martian ghosts - really dustlike particles that take over humans - create an
army of zombies who run around shouting and killing colonists. The army also is
a rip-off of the anonymous gangbangers who were mowed down during Precinct 13. </P>
<P>Even what is supposed to pass for witty repartee between Henstridge's Ballard
and Ice Cube's Williams seems forced. The chemistry factor is zero. </P>
<P>Carpenter does add a couple of interesting touches. Ballard and her mouthy
subordinate, Jericho (Jason Statham) sneak off into a store room where Jericho
suggests they have one last fling before facing the overwhelming odds against
them. Instead of acting insulted or slapping his face, Ballard pauses, agrees
with him and begins sucking face. </P>
<P>Before anything can happen, though, those rude Martians begin attacking again. </P>
<P>Ghosts of Mars is one of Carpenter's weakest efforts yet, and he has helmed a
bunch of howlers. </P>
<P>And Carpenter doesn't help with his obnoxious, pulsating and loud score that
blares every suspenseful piece of business as if it was the most important bit
of action in the movie. </P>
<P>This is one of those watch movies. No, you're not watching the screen, but
checking your time piece to try to determine when it will all end. Ghosts of
Mars is a snoozer. Only the explosions may interfere with your napping. </P>
