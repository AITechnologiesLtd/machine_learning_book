<PRE>AFTERGLOW
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Alan Rudolph has such an uncanny ability to establish mood that it
often doesn't seem to matter just how excessively stylized his sets are,
how overwritten his dialogue is, or how inconsistently his actors perform.
His latest film, "Afterglow," has some problems in each of these
departments yet there's something about the film--and Rudolph's body of
work in general--that affects you emotionally, leaving how much you might
actually enjoy the experience a secondary consideration.</P>
<P>        "Afterglow" focuses on two couples who are on the outs.  Marianne
and Jeffrey Byron (played by Lara Flynn Boyle and Jonny Lee Miller) are in
conflict over the decision to have a child.  Phyllis and Lucky Mann (Julie
Christie and Nick Nolte) share a mutual dissatisfaction because of
complications surrounding having *had* one.</P>
<P>        Lucky is a handyman whose job often finds him flat on his back
checking out some frustrated housewife's plumbing (pun intended).  He's
recommended to Marianne, who wants a room remodeled for the kid she hasn't
quite conceived yet.  Marianne's coquetteishness in Lucky's presence is
understandable; what woman watching Nick Nolte ripping down drywall
wouldn't want to bear his child?</P>
<P>        Jeffrey, a successful executive, still seems interested in
women--he's always telling his middle-aged, French-speaking secretary how
attractive she looks--just not in the diaphanous Marianne.</P>
<PRE>        Maybe it's an older woman thing.</PRE>
<P>        When Jeffrey suspects Marianne of infidelity (it's pretty obvious;
she scrawls details of an illicit rendezvous with Lucky on her calendar) he
heads to the hotel bar to confront her, only to stumble upon Phyllis--there
to spy on her philandering husband for purely masochistic reasons--and
their brief, mismatched flirtation begins.  The foursome eventually wind up
at the Byron's beyond-mod Montreal apartment in a finale that would make
Mike Leigh proud.</P>
<P>        Nolte and Christie sparkle in "Afterglow," the latter in that very
dry, British way.  A faded star of B-movies, Phyllis lounges on the sofa
all day watching her awful films on television with a large gin at the
ready.  Weary, pathetic, and depressed, Phyllis seeks solace for a pain she
can't erase.  This is a plumb role for Christie; her recent screen
performances have been few and far between but when she does accept a part,
it's usually worth seeing (she received an Academy Award nomination for
this one).  Nolte has hardly made a bad movie (well, let's say that he's
hardly turned in a bad *performance*) and he and Christie easily overshadow
Boyle and Miller, who seem out of their depth compared to the two veterans.</P>
<P>        Boyle displays the same kind of mousy petulance she demonstrated in
Rudolph's "Equinox" and TV's "Twin Peaks."  Perhaps Rudolph simply asked
for "more of the same."  He got it; Marianne is more annoying than
alluring.  Miller's role seems to call for two modes of operation--awkward
and stiff--which limit the actor's emotional range.  He looks the part, and
downs scotch with all the elegance of a youthful corporate climber, but
when it comes to his Big Scene, awkward and stiff just don't cut it.  No
wonder Phyllis trots off to bed.  Alone.</P>
<P>        Uneven in the acting department, "Afterglow" is nevertheless worth
recommending.  It's not as well written as "Welcome to L.A." or "Choose
Me," and it's not as atmospheric as "Trouble In Mind" or "The Moderns"
(Rudolph pictures all).  But as a showcase for Nolte and
Christie--especially Christie--it's splendid, and carries an emotional
punch right to the bitter end.</P>
