<P>Actor/writer/director Albert Brooks teams up with several other well-known
directors, Scorsese, Cameron, Reiner, as actors, to create a magical film
about gorgeous actress Sharon Stone, and cute-as-a-patootie actress Andie
MacDowell, spending a night together naked in bed! Well...okay...not
exactly, but the point is, it almost happens! Anyway, on to my review...</P>
<P>PLOT:
A veteran Hollywood screenwriter gets his writing contract terminated when
everyone in the industry deems him to have "lost his edge". After querying
his successful producer friend for help, he suddenly finds himself hooked up
with a modern-day "muse", who is ready to stir up his creativity...but at a
price! You see, the "muse" likes to inspire at her own pace, loves
extravagance and has a "thing" for expensive gifts.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A very original fantasy tale strung along with plenty of funny lines, a nice
pace, a couple of twists and turns, a surprising ending, cameos galore,
Hollywood in-jokes, and a spectacular performance from Sharon Stone as "the
muse". I've given Sharon a hard time over the past few years, with her
trying to get all serious and shit, but she is perfect in this role, funny
as heck, cute as ever, and man-o-man...what a great ass! :) Albert Brooks is
someone whose humor is either appreciated by one or not, much like Woody
Allen, and if you haven't liked any of his previous films, you probably
won't like this one either. Fortunately for myself, I love Woody Allen, and
respect Brooks' unique brand of humor, despite his tepid acting range
leaving much to be desired. This film had me laughing out loud for the first
thirty minutes or so, but did take a little dip in the second half, with
little spurts of humor buoying me afloat.</P>
<P>Having said that, the plot itself always kept me interested, while Sharon
Stone and her engaging performance, locked me in for good! Don't get me
wrong, I also liked Albert Brooks' character, and he certainly hogged all
the best one-liners to himself, but Stone stole the show for me. MacDowell,
on the other hand, does little but float around in this one, adding very
little to the mix, and Jeff Bridges, well, he acts with his tan, and does a
mighty fine job at it, if I say so myself! Scorsese's walk-on and a couple
of other big scenes have giant laughs, but on the whole, the film is cute,
and fluffy, and fun, and well, entertaining. Surely my own bias as a
screenwriter might be shining through a little here (Just so you know where
I'm coming from :), but Mrs. JoBlo has no interest in the Woods of Holly,
and she was also spurting out laughter throughout. Take it as you will, but
do appreciate the fact that there are plenty of Hollywood jabs in here,
humor which treks heavily through the sardonic, and Sharon Stone is goddamn
delicious! Any questions...? And no...I haven't sold any of my scripts
either. Anyone know of any cheap muses running around?? Anyone? Bueller?</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Albert Brooks was born and raised in Los Angeles, Brooks is the son of radio
comedian Harry Einstein, known as "Parkyakarkus". Brooks' real name is
Albert Einstein. His brother is the infamous daredevil "Super Dave"
Osbourne, whose real name is Bob Einstein. Albert turned down the lead in
WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... (10/10) because he thought it was too much like a
Woody Allen script. Albert himself has been described as a West Coast Woody
Allen.
Sharon Stone's first (albeit fleeting) film appearance was as the blond
goddess glimpsed by Woody Allen on a passing train in Allen's STARDUST
MEMORIES. Stone's first major film role was as the conniving young actress
girlfriend of Ryan O'Neal in the comedy IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES. She is a
member of MENSA, with an IQ of 154. She once auditioned for the Cathy
Moriarty role in Martin Scorsese's classic 1980 film RAGING BULL, the Glenn
Close role in FATAL ATTRACTION (8/10), the Kim Basinger role in BATMAN
(8/10), and the Madonna role in DICK TRACY. She also speaks Italian.
Andie MacDowell's full name is Rosalie Anderson MacDowell. In 1988, she
became a member of the New York City Church of Christ, a local affiliate
with a cult known as the International Churches of Christ. She left the
group shortly thereafter, when she was forbidden to take part in the film
SEX, LIES & VIDEOTAPE by the leadership.
Jeff Bridges met his wife, Susan in 1975 while filming RANCHO DELUXE. She
was working as a maid on a dude ranch, and as of 1999, they're still
married.
Cameos in this film include directors James Cameron, Martin Scorsese and Rob
Reiner, actors Lorenzo Lamas, Cybill Shepherd and Jennifer Tilly, and famous
restauranteur Wolfgang Puck.
THE MUSE marks the sixth collaboration between screenwriter Monica Johnson
and Albert Brooks. Their previous films together were MOTHER, LOST IN
AMERICA, MODERN ROMANCE, and REAL LIFE (all of which starred and were
directed by Brooks) and THE SCOUT (which only starred Brooks).</P>
