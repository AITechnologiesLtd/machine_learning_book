A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:
Quentin Tarantino</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: 
Quentin Tarantino, from a book by Elmore Leonard. </PRE>
<PRE>Starring: 
Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Bridget Fonda, Michael
Keaton</PRE>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Smart stewardess, honest boyfriend, despicable gunrunner and henchmen,
federal agents</PRE>
<P>Synopsis: 
Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) - -  an impoverished stewardess for a dumpy
airline - - makes money on the side by smuggling cash from Mexican
buyers to LA gunrunner Ordell (Samuel Jackson). She is caught smuggling
by Ray (Michael Keaton) - -  an agent from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms. Now the ATF wants Jackie to testify against
gunrunner Ordell, and Ordell wants Jackie very dead. Jackie tells Ordell
she'll fool the ATF and smuggle him half a million dollars from Mexico.
She tells the ATF she'll fool Ordell and they can catch him in the act
of receiving fifty thousand smuggled dollars. Her real plan is to have
the ATF arrest Ordell, and then pocket Ordell's half million dollars
herself through an elaborate ruse involving a shopping mall dressing
room - - so that she can finally live happily ever after with her
boyfriend Max (Robert Forster). Will Jackie's scam succeed?</P>
<P>Opinion:
JACKIE BROWN is fairly enjoyable but two things bug me. First, it takes
a whole hour for the movie to explain and set up the initial situation. 
After that, there is nothing left for the audience to figure out for the
next hour and thirty minutes. Once Jackie reveals her plan to Max in the
beginning of the movie, it seems the whole caper goes off predictably
without a hitch, twist, surprise, or problem. It's just a matter of
seeing the mechanics of the thing, and one scene is shown three times
(through the eyes of three different characters) to make sure we
understand how the money is switched. Still, it is kind of nostalgic
hearing the 70s soundtrack and seeing action gal icon Pam Grier get
tough on crime like the good old days. Of course, Tarantino throws in
some side characters with flippant, slang dialogue.</P>
<P>Director:
Director Quentin Tarantino is a master at elevating old B-grade movie
stuff to the status of A-grade retro. Like Woody Allen, he always gives
us amusing neurotic characters with hip dialogue. The difference is,
Tarantino's neurotic characters are always TV trivia savvy, and his bad
guys are likely to be violent. Sometimes Tarantino's movies seem to be a
collage of scenes or vignettes put together into a film mosaic.
Personally I would love to see Tarantino direct a sequel for the JAMES
BOND or SCREAM movie series because of Tarantino's talent for mixing
homage with edge. The Bond movie could pay homage to previous Bond
movies, while SCREAM 3 could add action to the horror whodunit series by
being about kung fu video trivia fans being stalked by a masked karate
killer. </P>
