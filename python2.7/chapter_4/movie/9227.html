 TriStar
 Director:  Oliver Stone
 Writer:  John Ridley
 Cast: Sean Penn, Billy Bob Thornton, Powers Boothe,
Jennifer Lopez, Nick Nolte
   Oliver Stone must have decided he was getting too serious,
dealing with assassination conspiracies and other movies
filled with gruesome, dead-on violence.  He now makes a u-
turn in his career without giving up his favorite theme--what
characters do in extreme situations--and comes up with a fun
movie, one which allows him to relax a bit and send up a few
Hollywood gems of the genre.  Stone calls "U-Turn" a
"scorpion in a bucket" movie, with characters eating each
other and trying to crawl up out of the same bucket.  If that
sounds as though he's filming in the rat-race, urban milieu--
thousands of creatures going through their paces with office
politics, gang warfare and the like--Stone reminds us that the
smallest towns are no escape from mayhem, conspiracies,
intrigues, and a dog-eat-dog mentality.  City folks who think
they can bail out of the great void of anonymity by
disappearing into the friendliness of Small Town America
might think again after this movie.  "U-Turn" looks low budget,
with a minimalist production design, but what's lacking in
fashion is compensated for by photographer Robert
Richardson's jumpy camera, which scans Arizona's
breathtaking scenery and zeroes on one of its seedy towns as
though to contrast humankind's majesty with the individual's
scuzziest impulses.  The figures whom Stone creates, using
scripter John Ridley's adaptation of his own novel "Stray
Dogs" are not people you'd identify with.  They're off-the-wall. 
But the outlandish depictions are meant to highlight traits with
which we all share deep-down under our veneer of polish and
sophistication.  
   "U-Turn" is perhaps inspired by John Dahl's 1993 movie
"Red Rock West," a thriller about an unemployed, honest
Nicolas Cage who finds himself mistaken for a contract killer
hired to do in seductive adulterous Lara Flynn Boyle. It
illustrates the problems faced by the basically decent Bobby
Cooper (Sean Penn), now encumbered by a $13,000
gambling debt, driving across a dry Arizona highway en route
to California.  Missing two fingers, which have been
indelicately removed by a couple of Vegas hoodlums as a
down-payment of Bobby's arrears, he continues his bad
stroke of luck when his 1964 Ford Mustang breaks down just
outside the godforsaken dust bowl known ironically as
Superior, Arizona.  Leaving the vehicle with a repulsive Darrell
(Bill Bob Thornton), whom Bobby eventually calls an "ignorant
inbred turtleneck hick," he proceeds to the center of town
where he becomes embroiled in a web of treachery.  Ignoring
the advice of several townspeople who look at his bandaged
hand and counsel, "You've got to be more careful," he is
invited to the home of the sultry Grace (Jennifer Lopez) to
"hang drapes," is discovered and thrown out by Grace's
grizzled husband Jake (Nick Nolte), admonished by a blind,
fortune-cookie-philosopher Indian (Jon Voight), and beaten up
by a young, ignorant stud who is convinced that Bobby is
flirting with his bimbo, Jenny (Claire Danes).  Desperate to
raise the money to pay off the Russian criminal, he accepts
an offer of money if he would murder Grace, a promising
proposal provided that he can overcome the watchful eye of
the town sheriff (Boothe Powers) and his lust for the
voluptuous woman.
   Oliver Stone throws movie cognoscenti in the audience
some references to previous films, particularly to King Vidor's
1946 sex-Western "Duel in the Sun," a larger-scale, brawling
work with half-breed Jennifer Jones caught between her
brother Gregory Peck and Joseph Cotten.  Replicating that
movie's bizarre finale, Stone tickles our funny bones as we
watch an ax-murder, several beatings, a de-digitalization, and
other developments which would have Norman Rockwell
turning in his grave. He also frustrates us by his dependence
on outrageously cheap movie tricks, changing his film stock
as often as his characters swap loyalties and bouncing his
camera as though it were riding across the state's craggy
topography in a 1971 Volkswagen Bug.  Crosscutting some
portentous imagery--vultures feeding on the carcass of some
road-kill, a crow which emits warning signals from time to
time, and a couple of snakes--Stone seems to be having the
time of his life among a bevy of performers who prove that
like the creatures of the desert, we're all animals deep down.
New Age folks are convinced that AZ's red rocks have healing
properties, but the director of "Natural Born Killers" may have
succeeded in convincing them otherwise. Rated R.  Running
Time: 125 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
