<PRE>                                     SNIPER
                       A film review by James Berardinelli
                        Copyright 1993 James Berardinelli</PRE>

<P>     Thomas Beckett (Tom Berenger) is one of the best snipers in the
U. S. Military--an expert on the jungles of Panama with 74 confirmed
kills to his name.  Now, the National Security Council has decided that
a candidate for Panama's upcoming Presidential election needs to be
eliminated.  Beckett gets sent in, but not on his own.  Along with him
is Richard Miller (Billy Zane), Beckett's superior and new partner.
Although Miller scored well on the range, he's never killed anyone and
Beckett isn't sure he's capable of doing so.</P>
<P>     SNIPER starts out with a slickly-filmed, tense action scene that
promises a thrill-a-minute experience which the remainder of the movie
is unable to deliver.  There are about five or six action sequences
throughout the one-hundred-minute running time, and, while all are
exciting, it's what's in between that bogs down an otherwise-promising
film.  The reliance upon formulas is also annoying.  With just a little
more inventiveness on the part of writers Beckner and Leyland, this
could have been an eye-opener, but the script consistently falls back
on the tried-and-true.  There was an instant when I thought something
truly daring had been accomplished, but, alas, it was only my
misunderstanding of events.</P>
<P>     I also had a lot of trouble accepting the relationship between
Beckett and Miller.  The tension between them feels manufactured--a
plot device and nothing more.  One of the problems is probably that,
while I came to understand Beckett, Miller never gelled as a
character.  As far as I could tell, that was more the fault of the
script than Billy Zane's acting.</P>
<P>     The action scenes are expertly-directed, and even though the
slow-motion bullet effects have been lifted from ROBIN HOOD:  PRINCE OF
THIEVES (where the projectile was an arrow, not a bullet), they work to
good effect here.  Unfortunately, director Luis Llosa has trouble with
the long periods between shootings, especially in the first half of the
movie where there's a lot of aimless meandering about in the jungle.</P>
<P>     The plot, which seems relatively intelligent at the beginning,
falls apart in the last third.  So much for a tightly-constructed
film....  For a while, things were happening so fast that it was
difficult--and confusing--trying to keep up.  Maybe a different editor
would have helped the problem, but SNIPER needs help in the pacing
department.</P>
<P>     Overall, however, I don't think action fans will be offended.  This
isn't a complete no-brainer.  Some attention has been paid to plot and
character, and Berenger is certainly capable of giving a solid
performance.  No matter how many faults SNIPER may exhibit--and it has
a lot of them--it never commits the cardinal offense of becoming dull.</P>
<PRE>                        Rating:  7.4 (B-, **1/2)</PRE>
