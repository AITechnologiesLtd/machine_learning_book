<P>   What should be done about the problem of illegal drugs in
the U.S.?  Should our country deal with the supply side or the
demand aspect?  If the former, should we increase the
funding for the border patrol?  Give money to governments of
countries which are known to supply large amounts of drugs
so that they can fight the problem better on their own?  If the
latter, should we increase our education program?  Jail
suppliers and throw away the keys?  These are solutions
proposed in the past.  Are we winning the drug war?  No one
on any side of the political spectrum thinks so.  Millions upon
millions of Americans make a market for the product. 
According to Steven Soderbergh's challenging new film,
"Traffic," twenty-five percent of high-school kids are doing
drugs, and the situation today is different from the way it was
during the late 60's and 70's.  Young people are not casually
"experimenting" any more and the drugs are more plentiful
and purer than they ever were.  How do you cope with
numbers like that when the bad guys have more money to 
keep the stuff flowing into our country and into our citizens'
veins than our government can afford to halt the torrent?</P>
<P>   Utilizing a screenplay by Stephen Gaghan (who scripted
William Friedkin's"Rules of Engagement" but here eschews
a crazed scenario that focussed on a Marine officer who
"wastes" a throng of Arab demonstrators), Soderbergh makes
ample use of hand-held cameras to build an edgy but highly
intelligent police thriller.  Giving the two and one-half hour
drama the same docu-drama feel that he furnished to his first
movie, "sex, lies and videotape" (about a selfish lawyer
whose wife has turned frigid, whose sister-in-law is his lover,
and whose college friend comes up for a visit), Soderbergh
shucks that story's Eric-Rohmer style talkiness for the sort of
energy inherent in his February blockbuster, "Erin
Brockovich."</P>
<P>   "Traffic," whose hand-held cinematography by Peter
Andrews (a pseudonym for Soderbergh himself) gives the
picture a frighteningly real texture, embraces enough twists to
convince us that in this ongoing war on drugs, things are
seldom what they seem.  Twist follows curves, as Soderbergh
plunges us into three separate stories.  Unlike Robert Altman,
he does not ultimately unify his tales but nonetheless shows
how a narrative dealing with drug lords in Mexico meshes
with a yarn about a family's attempts to deal with their
daughter's addiction, which then plaits with the story of a
criminal who turns coat and prepares to testify against a
major U.S. kingpin.  Despite the docu-drama feel of the
movie, "Traffic" actually evokes the thrills of John
Frankenheimer's "The French Connection."</P>
<P>   Michael Douglas, now looking more like his dad than ever
before, could be called the center of the three stories.  In the
role of Robert Wakefield, a conservative justice on the Ohio
Supreme Court who has just been appointed by the president
to head the Drug Enforcement Administration, the handsome
actor symbolizes the cynicism that the so-called war on drugs
elicits in people of all political stripes.  Opening as a naive,
gung-ho fighter who expects to make a real dent in drug
traffic, he is bureaucratically restrained by the president's
staff, which cautions Wakefield to hold no press conferences
for several weeks and to deliver no speeches to the media
unless cleared by the the administration.  Convinced that he
will learn nothing if he remains in the Beltway like so many
other politicians, he travels to the Mexican border at San
Ysidro, consulting  with Mexican authorities and later with top
officials of the FBI and other organizations.  Naive to a fault,
he is unaware that his own 16-year-old daughter, Caroline
(Erika Christensen), is a heroin addict--a fact known for
months by his wife, Barbara (Amy Irving).</P>
<P>   In a second undertaking, police officers Montel Gordon
(played stirringly by Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis
Guzman) are determined to keep drug trafficker Eduardo Ruiz
(Miguel Ferrer) alive, at least long enough to testify against
multi-millionarie kingpin Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer).  Ayala's
beautiful wife Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), naive in her
way as Wakefield is in his, is unaware that her husband's
money comes from the drug trade.  The change that comes
over her after the arrest of her husband mirrors the
transformation of Wakefield upon learning of his young
daughter's habit.</P>
<P>   However the most gripping part of the picture centers on
Mexican police officer Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro),
an honest Tijuana cop who sees no problem accepting a
meager salary of under $400 a month but who at the risk of
his life is forced to become enmeshed in the rampant
corruption now an actual part of his country's system.  (As
the voluminous press notes indicate, some Mexicans have
been moving into the same position that criminals in
Colombia have relished, providing a huge share of illegal
substances smuggled partly through the 28-lane highway that
leads from Tijuana to San Diego.)</P>
<P>   Like many other filmmakers, Steven Soderbergh wants his
films to be enjoyable to his audience.  Entertainment is
primary.  He wants the bulk of his audience to come to the
theater for the roller-coaster ride but to leave not only
diverted from their daily cares but also encouraged to think
about the deeper issues posed by the films.  "Erin
Brockovich" would likely be the example he would trot out: a
story bolstered by Julia Roberts's over-the-top performance in
the title role of a poor, undereducated mother.  Her
determination to fight a major polluter not only inspires the
viewers but gets them to contemplate similar unscrupulous
activities by large corporations in their own areas of the
country.  </P>
<P>   While accounts of the drug trade are a daily staple in
newspapers and TV reports, they do not give the public the
kind of dramatic wholeness that a film like "Traffic" can
produce.  Soderbergh shows us the desperation that faces
responsible people in the U.S. who cannot understand the
great appeal drugs have for people across all walks of life. In
one scene, Wakefield flies to Washington with a group of
advisers, high-ranking officials of the FBI, the DEA and
others, asking them to think out of the box--to come up with
avenues of action perhaps never contemplated before.  What
he gets, essentially, is silence--his fellow travelers looking
blankly at this drug czar as if asking for a solution to the
problem confirms that he is looney.</P>
<P>   While "Traffic" is in no way as stylized as the slicker "Erin
Brockovich"--after all the story is filmed completely with hand-
held cameras and a hefty dose of improvised dialogue--no
one can fail to notice the effect of Soderbergh's use of color. 
To separate the mosaic, making clear to everyone which of
the three stories is being projected at any given time, he
divides the film into distinct hues, particularly tobacco-brown
for the gritty areas of Mexico and executive blue for the
opulent areas of the U.S. (the tony Cincinnati suburb of Hyde
Park, for example). This is overkill.  A more conventional use
of filters would have done the job without creating this
unnecessary set of distractions. For added authenticity he
has the Mexicans speak Spanish to one another (with English
subtitles), has cast a number of Latinos, and even uses the
actual director for the U.S. Customs service in San Diego,
Rudy R. Camacho, to play himself.  This is sound. Like Lars
von Trier and other followers of the Dogme 95 theory, he
uses natural light wherever possible, and artificial illumination
when needed to add some clarity to the cheap hotels and
crack dens--which differ exquisitely with the upper-middle
class suburbs or Cincinnati. The country clubs of San Diego
seem a different world from the seedy streets of Tijuana just
a couple of miles down the road, and in fact any traveler to
San Diego is bound to note the bold contrast between the
yacht-filled waters of southern California and the teeming
slums of Tijuana just over the fence.</P>
<P>   While the principal performers, particularly Benicio del
Toro, dramatize their roles expertly, the supporting players
are indispensable to the film's authentic feel.  Tomas Milian is
an almost inscrutable General Salazar, the highest-ranking
police official in Tijuana whose desire to crush the cartel of
one Juan Obregon seems so excessive that we wonder about
his true motivation.  Clifton Collins Jr. does an impressive
turn as a slightly-built hired assassin for a cartel, called in for
a job by a rich woman whose charity work belies her dark
nature.  As Robert Wakefield, Michael Douglas gives us
further reason to believe that a person can change radically
during the course of a drama.  If a wealthy woman, a pillar of
her community, can become an assassin; if a thoroughly
honest cop can become debauched against a lifetime of
evidence that contradicts the transformation; if a conservative
judge can shuck his $1500 suits, symbolically displaying his
newly acquired wisdom that outside appearances mask
tenebrous interiors--then who knows?  Maybe next year
Americans will stop freebasing, snorting, drinking, smoking,
carousing and gorging!</P>
