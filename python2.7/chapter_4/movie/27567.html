The Wedding Planner (2001) 1 star out of 4. Starring Jennifer Lopez,
Matthew McConaughey, Bridgette Wilson-Sampras, Justin Chambers, Judy
Greer, Alex Rocco, Joanna Gleason and Charles Kimbrough. Music by Mervyn
Warren. Writtrn by Pamela Falk and Michael Ellis. Directed by Adam
Shankman. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P> While watching The Wedding Planner, I played a game called ìCount the
Cliches.î</P>
<P> What are the rules? Simple. Just count characters or situations youíve
seen in countless other movies.
For example in The Wedding Planner we have:</P>
<P> 1. The successful, single career woman who everyone thinks lives a
glamorous life, but who goes home to a drab apartment, fixes a frozen
meal and watches The Antiques Road Show.</P>
<P> 2. The man-crazy, overly perky assistant who sees every single male as
a potential match for her boss.</P>
<P> 3. The meet-cute situation in which he and she come together, their
eyes meet and sparks fly.</P>
<P> 4. The old-world father ó hers ó who sees his daughter as a failure
because sheís still single.
You get the idea.</P>
<P> The Wedding Planner is a slick little trifle that is insipid,
inoffensive, corny and unoriginal.</P>
<P> Itís a movie that wastes the talents of Jennifer Lopez and Matthew
McConaughey. It play more like a TV pilot than a feature film. Even the
music gives off a sitcom-like aura. The only thing missing is a laugh
track.</P>
<P> This film is so predictable that if you canít figure out what is going
to happen 10 minutes before the event, you need a remedial course in
Movie Watching 101.</P>
<P> Lopez plays Mary Fiore, the always-in-control A-list wedding planner of
San Francisco who makes everyoneís most memorable day perfect and every
brideís dream come true.</P>
<P> She has just landed the biggest account of her career ó the wedding of
Fran Donnelly (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras), who is the daughter of a famed
Internet tycoon. This prize means she rises to partner in her company.</P>
<P> But on this fateful day, Mary almost has a near-fatal collision with a
runaway Dumpster. (Like I said, this is sitcom situationland.) She is
rescued at the last minute by Dr. Steve Edison (McConaughey), a
gorgeous-looking pediatrician.</P>
<P> After a quick checkup at the hospital, Maryís overly-eager assistant
invites Dr. Steve to join the two women that night for a
movie-in-the-park date. Of course when the doc shows up, Maryís
assistant takes a powder, thus allowing the two to share a lovely
evening.</P>
<P> But, guess what? Fran drops by Maryís office a day or two later to
begin planning her wedding and drags her fiancé along. And you know who
that is?</P>
<P> No need to go on. The rest of the plot falls into place as neatly as
those big-piece puzzles you buy a pre-schooler.</P>
<P> The Wedding Planner is a chick flick, and a lame one at that. It offers
nothing original. Even at about 100 minutes the movie seems to drag.</P>
<P> Lopez has some pleasant moments as the successful Cinderella looking
for her Prince Charming, but McConaughey appears totally bored and seems
to bring nothing to his character. He acts as if itís strictly a
take-the-money-and-run gig for the young heartthrob.</P>
<P> The Wedding Planner is rated PG-13 for some silly reason, and I canít
fathom why since the movie is so inoffensive and innocuous.</P>
<P> In the film, one of Maryís talents is predicting how long a marriage
will last by noting the color of the brides maidsí gowns, the types of
flowers selected and the title of the coupleís wedding song.</P>
<P> Too bad screenwriters Pamela Falk and Michael Ellis, along with
director Adam Shankman, didnít have a Movie Planner advising them on
this project. They may have left it at the altar.</P>
