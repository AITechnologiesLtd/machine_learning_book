<PRE>                              DANTE'S PEAK
                       A film review by Steve Kong
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Lately there have been a string of special effects driven movies that
are lacking in story and characters.  And Dante's Peak is not unlike
these movies.</P>
<P>If you've seen Twister, you'll know the basics for Dante's Peak.  A
scientist driven by a memory of a loved one lost to the "monster" of
nature.  In Twister the monster was the tornado, and the scientist was
Helen Hunt's character Jo.  In Dante's Peak, the monster is a volcano
and the scientist is Pierce Brosnan's Harry.</P>
<P>But, is that all the coincidence between the two movies?  No, Dante's
Peak also has the rag-tag team of scientists, the red truck, the corny
love story, and the opening scene showing how "the loved one" was
lost.</P>
<P>You might me wondering how a 2 hour movie can be made out of one
volcano blowing.  I know I did.  The movie starts with a bang (pun
intended).  But it quickly slows to a smoldering.  The movie then
spends the next hour building the antagonistic relationship between
Harry and his boss and the love story between Harry and the mayor of
Dante's Peak (Linda Hamilton).  This part is slow going, and had me
looking at my watch.  Then all the sudden Dante's Peak explodes (who
could have predicted that?) and although the action is dry and stale,
there is enough tension to keep the movie going from here on.</P>
<P>On a special effects level, Dante's Peak is incredible.  On a story
level it's nothing more than cold slowing lava.  Is it worth seeing?
If it is a matinee showing, sure, go see it on the big screen for the
special effects.</P>
<P>Steve
