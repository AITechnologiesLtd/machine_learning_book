Call Northside 777 (Reviewed on Jan. 31/99)</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Jimmy Stewart</PRE>
<P>Whenever I sit down to watch a Jimmy Stewart film, I always have the
expectation that I'm going to thoroughly enjoy myself.  Stewart always
manages to rise above his material, even when it's bottom-of-the-barrel
stuff.  Not that that tends to happen, though, because somehow Stewart
always managed to pick the most engaging and entertaining scripts. Not so
with "Call Northside 777".</P>
<P>The movie casts Stewart as a not-too-ambitious reporter assigned to cover
the execution of a death-row inmate accused of murder.  The prisoner says
that he's innocent, but Stewart (initially) does not believe him. 
Eventually, though, after reviewing the facts and speaking to a number of
people close to the prisoner, he begins to believe him and starts his own
investigation.</P>
<P>Intriguing premise, right?  There's no way a filmmaker could go wrong with
a setup like that, and Jimmy Stewart in the lead, right?  Wrong.  "Call
Northside 777" is an overlong bore.  For some reason, *every* single scene
in the film goes on much longer than they need to.  And to make things
worse, the movie is presented to us in a quasi-documentary style, so all
the dialogue is extremely dry and without humour.</P>
<P>Another problem with is that everything is over-explained to the max.  For
example, there is a scene in which the prisoner is hooked up to a
lie-detector.  Now, since most audiences in 1948 likely had no idea what a
lie-detector machine was, the characters spend far too much time
explaining how it works.  We even see the machine being calibrated for the
prisoner, a process that takes about five minutes.  Was it really
necessary to show all this?  I don't think so.  This ten minute scene
could have easily been cut in half.  And there are other examples of
scenes that run on much longer than they need to.</P>
<P>At the beginning of this review, I mentioned how Jimmy Stewart is always
good in his movies.  Sadly, this is not so here.  None of his usual charm
is present.  Instead, he plays the character very somberly, I suppose
because it's based on a true story.  Stewart looks like he's trapped in
this role.  You can see, ever-so-briefly, moments in which his engaging
personality bubbles to the surface, but these moments are very sparse.</P>
<P>"Call Northside 777" could have been an exciting, tension-filled thriller.
Instead, it's technically flawless, but there's no heart.</P>
<PRE>** out of ****</PRE>
