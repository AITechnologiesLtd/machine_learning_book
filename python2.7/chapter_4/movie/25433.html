<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>In the spotty two film history of Jay Wardâ€™s animated television shows making 
their way to the big screen, along comes Rocky and Bullwinkle. The duo is 
probably the most popular of his creations, but these two have something 
George of the Jungle and Dudley Do-Right donâ€™t. When the program aired during 
the 1960s, there was always a political aspect to it. Winking, nudging, and 
in conclusion suggesting that a dimwitted moose and above average flying 
squirrel could beat the Russians was never completely through the back door. 
Since the Russian paranoia in the states has subsided, what purpose would the 
creatures serve today? To satirize Hollywood of course! Their mission is 
pretty much the same, but technology has changed everything. Keeping the 
original cheap wordplay intact, this new movie smacks all former cartoon 
characters into '90s reality, a time of influential entertainment, improved 
communication, and an evil villain to bring to justice.</P>
<P>Boris (Jason Alexander) and Natasha (Rene Russo) get pulled out of reruns. 
Their leader, aptly named Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro), also pops up in 
the real world. He comes up with a brilliant scheme. He buys all of the 
television stations in the United States so he can broadcast his own network, 
Really Bad TV, across the nation. After watching just a few short minutes, 
viewers become stupefied and settle into a hypnotic trance. When the majority 
of Americans are under his spell, Fearless Leader will force them to vote for 
him as president. Naturally, the only people that can save the day are Rocky 
and Bullwinkle. They too get pulled out of reruns. Teaming up with FBI agent 
Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo), Moose and Squirrel travel the countryside to 
stop the evil television station. With Bullwinkleâ€™s mental capacity, Karenâ€™s 
identity issues, and Rocky past his prime the adventure is a rough one.  </P>
<P>The greatest pleasures of this movie are the cameos. Randy Quaid, Janeane 
Garofolo, Carl Reiner, Jonathan Winters, Billy Crystal, John Goodman, and 
Whoopi Goldberg all make appearances.  Piper Perabo fits her character well. 
Jason Alexander and Rene Russo are deliciously evil as Boris and Natasha. The 
chemistry between them is great. Robert De Niro hams it up to hilarious 
extremes, and he even spoofs his famous, â€œYou talkinâ€™ to me?â€? scene from 
Taxi Driver. Keith Scott is satisfactory as the narrator and new Bullwinkle. 
While he doesnâ€™t have the blundering Bullwinkle tone of the late Bill Scott, 
his lines are really funny. The wonderful June Foray is still the voice of 
Rocky. </P>
<P>The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle runs into difficulties in its 
presentation. Boris, Natasha, and Fearless leader are actual people. Rocky 
and Bullwinkle must settle for being awkward computer animated images. Why is 
that? One character raises this question during the movie, but receives no 
answer. Complete animation would mean the loss of already animated and 
excellent human performances. An actual live moose and squirrel would just be 
bizarre. Another problem I always have with Jay Ward movies is the way 
characters interact and converse with the narrator. He's just another 
character rather than being omnipotent. This was amusing in George of the 
Jungle, made Dudley Do-Right worse, and works only occasionally here.</P>
<P>Now Iâ€™m forgetting the context of the story. This is a live action cartoon 
with lots of witty or so bad itâ€™s funny lines. It succeeds at what a movie 
should do, entertain. Even though some of the jokes fall flat, this should be 
an enjoyable time for kids, and a nostalgia trip for baby boomers. Despite 
its many flaws, this is 88 minutes of pure fun.</P>
