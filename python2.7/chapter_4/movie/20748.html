Get Bruce</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Bruce is a real life comedy writer, aggressively sought and found by hit
performers like Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, Whoopi Goldberg and Better
Middler especially for award and event performances like the Oscars. "Get
Bruce" is a documentary/biography on Bruce sporting lengthy interviews with
the four stars mentioned above and briefer spots with others.</P>
<P>It's fairly interesting and at times very funny, but it doesn't really tell
a story. It's more like a definition of the current state of one interesting
guy and how useful he is to others. There's no drama, no climax; but as I
said -- it is quite amusing. I'm just not sure why it's released on film. It
seems to me it would naturally play well for TV audiences.</P>
