<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An amusing and sophisticated espionage thriller, only slightly flawed by
some of its contrivances. This British spy spoof is about a colorful
tailor who gets off on being respected by the prominent people he
surrounds himself with, who is a storyteller with a shady past. The
self-exiled tailor lives in Panama by the decree of his Uncle Benny
(Harold Pinter). He reluctantly becomes a spy for an unscrupulous
British agent. The British agent is Andy Osnard (Pierce Brosnan), who is
coming off a sex scandal in his last botched assignment. He's a
disgraced M.I.-6 agent exiled to Panama City to cool his heels. But Andy
is a go-getter, a schemer and an opportunist without scruples. He's one
of those handsome womanizer types (he's not exactly James Bond in this
role, but plays a parody of that role), who only looks out for himself
and is quite adept at leaving others in the lurch after seducing them.
The drug trafficking and gun-running climate of Panama will prove to be
a place just right for him to fit into.</P>
<P>Arriving in Panama the first thing he does is look up the fidgety tailor
Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush), a half-Jewish cockney ex-convict who
reinvented himself as the Saville Row tailor who makes up a tale that he
was partners with the WASP Brathwaite. He learned the craft in prison
and after serving his time, his beloved Uncle Benny set him up in
business far away from him. Here he sells old-fashioned custom-made
suits at steep prices, working out of a shop decorated with leather club
chairs where he serves class and Scotch to his pampered wealthy
clientele. He always speaks with utter praise for his late partner, the
revered Brathwaite; even though, Brathwaite never existed for him. The
oil painting that hangs on Harry's fitting-room wall that is supposed to
be a portrait of Brathwaite is actually a portrait of Harry's late Uncle
Benny, an East End rag man, whose dreamlike face appears at troubled
times to offer Harry advice on how to deal with his current state of
being. Harry lives a bourgeois life in his suburban villa, driving his
luxurious Land Rover around town, and enjoys being a doting father to
his two kids and a loving husband to a wife he adores.</P>
<P>Andy knows all this already and also knows that the tailor owes $50,000
on a farm he bought where he mortgaged his business and home, and now
the loan is being called in by the bank. His American wife, Louisa
(Jamie Lee Curtis), the respected daughter of an engineer who worked on
the canal, doesn't know Harry's dark secret from the past or how he has
put their two children Sarah and Mark in financial danger because of his
rash actions. But Harry has an offer from Andy he can't refuse. If he
sells Andy info about what's going on in Panama the loan will be paid
back by the Brits, as the Brits like the Americans are worried about the
canal now that it has been handed back to Panama. They are worried that
those in power shouldn't sell this very valuable trade route to another
country. And, since the tailor's wife is the high-powered executive
assistant to the Canal director, Andy gets him to spy on her. Harry
can't resist this temptation to tell tall stories and soon he's telling
Andy what he wants to hear. Andy knows that he's making this up, but
pays him anyway because it fits in with the scheme he's cooking up.</P>
<P>Geoffrey Rush is the timid man trapped in the post-Noriega Panamanian
intrigues, and Pierce Brosnan is the seducer without morals. They play
one another off in a most refreshingly joyous way, as for a while is
hard to tell who has the upper hand. Under John Boorman's
(Deliverance/Hope and Glory) competent direction, the film has air to
breathe for its smart storytelling tale and parody. It is based on the
popular 1996 novel by John John le Carré, who also was the screenwriter
and the executive producer, making sure his work was translated onto the
screen in a reasonable facsimile from the book. Which he said it was.</P>
<P>The supporting actors of note that lent a hand in making this spy story
edgy: were Chilean actress Leonor Varela's role as Harry's receptionist,
whose one side of the face is scarred because of the beating Noriega's
henchmen gave her. Noriega is the puppet the CIA head man Bush put in
power, but when his criminal activities and dealings in drugs became too
great for even President Bush, he was forcibly removed from power in an
invasion of the country. The country is now supposedly a democracy, but
as Boorman wryly points out these are the sames faces running the
country who were with Noriega. Brendan Gleeson plays the wino, a one
time rebel against Noriega, who is now too weak after spending some jail
time to be anything but a broken down man. Harry's tale to Andy is that
he's head of the 'silent opposition.' He says that this freedom-fighting
organization, headed by Gleeson, is planning to take back control of the
Panama Canal from the corrupt government. The joke is how readily the
Americans buy into this unreliable info without thoroughly checking it
out, and how this quickly turns into an international disagreement
between Panama and the U.S.. Catherine McCormack is part of the British
Embassy staff, who succumbs to Andy's sexual charms.</P>
<P>This farce works out fairly well. The script is tight. The directing is
impeccable, the acting finely tuned, and the mood it sets is for a
thinking man's picture to develop amidst all the comedy. Boorman gets
his digs in on what is going on down Panama way, now that Noriega is in
jail. The digs I liked best were: 'You know what the poor call those?'
pointing to the city's skyline, 'Cocaine towers! And the 85 banks?
Launderettes!' This is not an ordinary commercial formula film, but it's
more like Harry's handmade suits rather than those suits bought off the
rack.</P>
