<P>Invoking the spirit of Yul Brenner, Masayuki Suo's "Shall We Dansu?" invites
us to take a long look at a tradition which is as foreign to most of us as
it is to the Japanese: ballroom dancing.  The film begins by telling us that
dancing is almost unheard of in Japan, and that a man embracing a woman in
public is considered  lecherous and perverse.</P>
<P>The film then jumps to the workaday life of Shohei Sugiyama (excellently
portrayed by Koji Yakusho, managing to remind me of both Jackie Chan and
Harrison Ford, go figure).  Mr. Sugiyama is an accountant who has committed
his life to his wife, his child, his work and his new house.  However,
Sugiyama's soul is in limbo, and as he rides the train home every evening he
longs for a lonely soul he sees peering out of a dance studio window.
Natch, we find him entering the studio and taking classes without his wive's
foreknowledge.  Funny, heartwarming capers ensue.</P>
<P>Sometimes, while I'm watching a foreign film, I begin to wonder whether it
is the film I'm enjoying or the fact that I understand what's happening on
screen. Upon reflection, "Shall We Dance?" did at times succumb to sitcom
cliche characterization, and plot devices that might have irritated me in an
English language film.  However, this film is so lacking in the ever-present
self-consciousness of North American filmmaking, and so gleeful in its
spirit that I found myself forgiving the simplicity of sub-plots and simply
enjoying the film for what it was.  There was a more complex message about
the stoicism of Japanese society hiding within this film, but this state of
mind seemed to leave many of the main characters pretty easily.</P>
<P>I recommend this movie.  It's not pretentious, it's a little manipulative
and it's a lot of fun.  Your significant other will thank you for renting
this one, too.</P>
