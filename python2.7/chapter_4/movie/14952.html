THE DOGS OF WAR
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>While it was part of former Yugoslavia, my country, Croatia,
used to be almost completely ignored by Western films in
general. Words "Croatia" and "Croatians" were unheard, even
in movies whose plots actually took place on Croatian
locations. The rare exception was THE DOGS OF WAR, 1980
adaptation of Frederick Forsyth's bestselling novel, yet
that rare occasion only added insult to the injury, by
mentioning Croatians in most unflattering context. In a
single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people,
probably terrorists, who happen to remove parts of arm
dealers' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality
of merchandise.</P>
<P>Same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes
place - dark and violent world of shady international deals
with the blurred boundaries between business, politics and
crime. The movie protagonist, Shannon (Christopher Walken)
is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting
numerous little wars all over the globe. His latest job is a
intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that
demands information about political climate in West African
nation of Zangaro. Shannon arrives in that country only to
find oppressive regime of President Kimba, bloodthirsty
madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared
almost any Westerners away. After being arrested and
tortured by Kimba's secret police, Shannon leaves country
with a help of British journalist North (Colin Blakely).
Upon return, he is approached by mining company again, but
this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d'etat
against Kimba. Shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles
small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin
meticulous preparation for another small war.</P>
<P>Thing that separates THE DOGS OF WAR from conventional
action movies, especially those made in 1980s, is its
authenticity, almost close to documentary. It shouldn't
surprise anyone, because the author of the novel, Frederick
Forsyth, made reputation by blending fiction with real life,
thus creating interesting, exciting yet very believable
plots for his books. Those plots were also responsible for
few very successful 1970s thrillers, and one of them,
Zinnemman's THE DAY OF THE JACKAL, is now considered a
classic in that genre. This one deals with soldiers of
fortune, ancient tradition that was resurrected in great
turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by
vanishing colonial empires. Unlike WILD GEESE, that used it
as a pretext for conventional action adventure, script by
George Malko and Gary De Vore (author whose death last year
became real life mystery) is serious, and instead of action
puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their
work. The movie doesn't try to romanticise the mercenary
profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of
superheroes; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable
tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda.</P>
<P>Christopher Walken played in many movies, yet very rarely we
can see him in a leading role. His performance in this film
perhaps isn't breathtaking, yet adequate. His notoriously
expressionless face is perfect illustration of the
disillusioned, world- weary man whose alienation from the
"normal" way of life becomes complete and only remaining
ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends.
Although the movie doesn't lack capable actors, their roles
are miniature compared with Walken's, and only Colin Blakely
as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his
character. However, those who look familiar faces would find
them plenty in THE DOGS OF WAR - Tom Berenger, Paul Freeman,
Jo Beth Williams, Victoria Tennant (in brief cameo), and
biggest surprise is Ed O'Neill (of MARRIED WITH CHILDREN
fame) as Shannon's reluctant colleague.</P>
<P>This was the first major production for John Irvin, and it
shows why he earned the reputation of capable, yet second
class director. With the good script he can make very good
movie, with the bad script he can make real mess. Luckily,
THE DOGS OF WAR had a good script. Irvin's direction was
very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel.
The only distraction is dramatic music of Geoffrey Burgon,
used on the wrong places. In the final battle scene, where
we can see mercenaries at work, Irvin shows us that modern
warfare means superior firepower and tactics, unlike 1980s
Ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes.
Unfortunately, by making battle realistic Irvin made it
somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn't
help. But, despite those shortcomings, this movie remains
interesting and rare combination of action thriller and
gritty, realistic political drama.</P>
