<P> Did the studio brain trust who approved a title such as Whatís the
Worst That Could Happen? pause to consider the potential fun critics
could have playing off those words if they disliked the film?</P>
<PRE> For example:</PRE>
<PRE> Whatís the worst that could happen?</PRE>
<P> You can be forced to sit through this nonsense a second time.</P>
<PRE> Whatís the worst that could happen?</PRE>
<PRE> The studio can announce a sequel.</PRE>
<PRE> Whatís the worst that could happen?</PRE>
<P> You can find yourself locked in a theater holding a Martin Lawrence
film festival.</P>
<PRE> Whatís the worst that could happen?</PRE>
<P> The directorís cut on DVD could include an extra 30 minutes of footage.</P>
<PRE> Well, you get the idea.</PRE>
<P> Whatís the Worst That Could Happen is a lame, cynical movie trying to
pass itself off as a comedy caper. The movie has its moments, but you
could do the Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle between them.</P>
<P> Itís difficult enjoying a movie in which most of the characters are
thieves and crooks. Itís even harder to garner sympathy for people who
spend their lives thumbing their noses at the law.</P>
<P> Of course you can say actors such as James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart
made careers playing such characters. The difference is the agents of
law and order generally prevailed, and the Cagneys and Bogarts usually
paid the ultimate price in the final reel.</P>
<P> Whatís the Worst That Could Happen revolves around Kevin Caffery
(Lawrence), a high-class thief, and his battle with corrupt media tycoon
Max Fairbanks (Danny DeVito) to retrieve a ring Fairbanks took from
Caffery when the latter was caught burglarizing the mogulís summer home.</P>
<P> The ring was given to Kevin by his girlfriend, Amber (Carmen Ejogo).</P>
<P> Even taking into consideration that this feature is a comedy, the
plotting and storyline is preposterous. Though captured early in the
film in Fairbanksí mansion, Kevin escapes. Yet the police arenít looking
for him and he walks around in broad daylight without fear of seizure.</P>
<P> Amber falls in love with Kevin because he steals back a painting she
was forced to sell. Even when he admits to her that he is crook, she is
unfazed. Why? Because, as she tells him, she had dated lawyers, so
dating a thief shouldnít be much different.</P>
<P> In some ways the film is offensive. William Fichtner plays a police
detective who is a stereotyped gay directly from some homophobicís
handbook. He minces, swishes, carries a cane, dresses all in white, and
owns three cute little doggies to whom he speaks in baby talk.</P>
<P> The mush-mouthed Lawrence is not credible as a high-classed thief. He
lacks the sophistication and suaveness called for in the part.</P>
<P> DeVito merely seems to be reprising a role he has played many times
before ó most notably in Ruthless People ó that of the overbearing,
crooked tycoon who believes his wealth puts him above the law.</P>
<P> A strong supporting cast, including John Leguizamo, Glenne Headley,
Bernie Mac, Richard Schiff, Larry Miller, Nora Dunn and Ana Gasteyer are
wasted in this weak effort.</P>
<P> Whatís the worst that could happen? That this movie actually draws an
audience and takes up screen space that could be used for more deserving
fare.</P>
