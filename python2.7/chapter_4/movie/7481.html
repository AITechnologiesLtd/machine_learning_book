<PRE>                                SLING BLADE
                       A film review by John Bauer
                        Copyright 1997 John Bauer</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of 4)</PRE>
<P>Sometimes it is difficult to *not* resist the hype surrounding a movie.  We
are so saturated with media pronouncements of greatness that it seems nothing
could ever fulfill our heightened expectations.  So it is with pleasure that
I can say that the subtle charms of SLING BLADE were able to overcome the
burden of lavish praise.</P>
<P>For such a low-key film, this is no mean feat.  There are no sumptuous
landscapes to sweep you away, no grand acting gestures to amuse and
entertain, not really much in the way of high drama to rivet your attention.
 What we get instead is a small tale with big implications, just as a brief
shot of a man on a railroad bridge imparts nothing directly but conveys much
through the image.</P>
<P>The reason the story carries so much weight lies mainly in the performance of
writer-director Billy Bob Thornton.  Like a less fantastical Forrest Gump,
his character Karl Childers is earnest but somewhat dim.  Unlike the former's
humorous intersections with American history, however, Karl's earnestness
leads him to real trouble.  And when Karl finally concludes near the end of
the film that in his little piece of Arkansas "the world is too large," we
readily sympathize.</P>
<P>The heart of the film is about Karl's relationship with a fatherless boy,
well-played by Lucas Black.  But its soul is about Karl's struggle for
redemption and a place in the world.  Karl counts among his few possessions a
Bible which he claims to have read, though he doesn't understand much of it.
 On the surface, as another character suggests, that makes sense:  the Bible
is incomprehensible to most of us.  But for Karl the things we most readily
accept -- such as the sinfulness of murder -- assume a complexity that forces
him into tragic paradoxes.  In part this is because he is incapable of
understanding the complications of ordinary life that we take for granted;
but he is also a victim of our need for order, for justice in black and
white.</P>
<P>There are some holes in the script, the biggest being the all-too-easy
acceptance of Karl by the small town society he encounters.  I would think
that his crimes would make him infamous and something of a bogeyman around
town; rather, he is practically greeted with open arms wherever he goes.
 There are other, lesser tugs at credibility as well.</P>
<P>But in the end these do not matter.  The essentials of the story are strong
enough to hold our attention and meaningful enough to penetrate our
consciousness.  In crafting a small-town morality play that speaks to us all,
Billy Bob Thornton has made his world large indeed.</P>
