<PRE>RUNAWAY BRIDE
Directed by Garry Marshall
Screenplay by Sara Parriott, Josann McGibbon, Audrey Wells
With Julia Roberts, Richard Gere
UA North, De Vargas    PG      115 min</PRE>
<P>     Like a pair of former lovers trying to stir up the embers of a
dead affair, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts are together again, but
the magic that lit the screen in Garry Marshall's surprise 1990 hit
"Pretty Woman" is dead, and there's no bringing it back to life.</P>
<P>"Runaway Bride" is a calculated, empty shakedown of audiences
yearning for another round of the fairytale charm that made a
superstar of Roberts a decade ago.  The original notion was to do
"Pretty Woman II", but the parties involved couldn't agree on a
formula, so they had to settle for a new story.  This time Gere's a
misogynistic journalist who hears a tale in a bar about a Maryland
woman (Roberts) who keeps leaving grooms at the altar.  Without
checking a single fact he writes an error-riddled, actionable diatribe
in his USA Today column, naming names.  To the veteran journalist's
amazement, this gets him fired.  His boss (Rita Wilson), who is also
his ex-wife, has to pull his plug, but her husband (Hector Elizondo),
who is also his pal, offers to get him a cover story in GQ if he can
get the skinny on the runaway bride.</P>
<P>He jumps at the offer -- media superstar though he is, he isn't
syndicated, and the USA Today column seems to be his only gig (by the
looks of his penthouse, it must pay well.)  Down he goes to Maryland,
where the townspeople, and even Julia's family , welcome him as if he
were Pat Sajak.  The only person who shows any resistance to his charm
is Roberts herself, but she comes around quicker than you might think.</P>
<P>The screenplay is peppered with comedy cliches, like the coach
who talks only in sports terms, and the horny grandma who says things
like "I like his tight butt," a line with echoes that Gere might have
preferred left alone.  Joan Cusack adds some life with her dependable
comic flair.  But neither Gere nor Roberts get characters written with
any reference to reality, and despite his silver hair and lean jaw,
and her incandescent smile, there's not much they can do with a
relationship so obviously constructed on the page rather than in the
heart.  This isn't chemistry, it's instant coffee.</P>
