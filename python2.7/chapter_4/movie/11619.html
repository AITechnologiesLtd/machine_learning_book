<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        I don't care whether or not Jack Stanton, the character portrayed by
John Travolta in Primary Colors, is supposed to be Bill Clinton.  I've
read that he is, but it doesn't really matter.  I certainly don't care
about the book written by "Anonymous" (supposedly the author is
ex-Newsweek writer Joe Klein).  </P>
<P>        I think the entire situation is intensely silly.  If someone is going
to make a semi-biography about how our President got to where he is, why
not just do that?  Why all this secrecy?  Oh, I suppose that Clinton
wouldn't like a film to be made about him while he's still in office. 
Maybe this is just an easy way to tell the story without dealing with
whatever legal boundaries that needed to be crossed.</P>
<P>        In any event, this conspiracy stuff didn't give me a positive outlook
on Primary Colors before seeing it, although I expected to enjoy the
film.  But I didn't.  This film is profoundly uninteresting and
feigned.  It's phony in almost every scene, and painfully artificial in
each second of dialogue spewed out of Travolta's mushy, distracting,
Clinton-spoofing voice.  I despised almost every moment of this film,
and not necessarily because of Elaine May's script, but because of the
execution:  director Mike Nichols fails on a fundamental level to
explain the point of his film.  Is it an Intelligent and Cynical
satire?  Is it supposed to be a realistic account of how political
campaigns work?  Is it intended as a character study of Bill Clinton?  </P>
<P>        I don't know, and because Nichols goes in so many different directions,
the film is ultimately reduced to a soup of scenes that clash because of
their strikingly varied tones.  Some of these scenes work alone, but
many don't, and none of them work herded together in this disaster. 
This fact is not enhanced by the heinous, radically annoying performance
by John Travolta, a performance that has permanently made me cautious of
any film in which he may appear in the future. </P>
<P>        The film is about Governor Stanton's efforts to win the Democratic
nomination for the Presidential race.  The story is told through the
eyes of Henry Burton (Adrian Lester), a young, ambitious man who is
recruited by Stanton and his wife, Susan (Emma Thompson), to manage a
large part of the campaign.  Henry believes that he's working for a
great man, and his loyalty is tested through numerous trials, most of
which involve accusations that Stanton sleeps around at every given
chance.  A subplot, which becomes the focus towards the end, involves
Kathy Bates as Libby Holden, an old friend of the Stantons who is hired
to see what kind of dirt the press is going to be able to dig up on
them.</P>
<P>        Much of the film is supposedly about the relationship between Stanton
and his wife.  The relationship the audience gets to see is about as
watered-down as the relationship the American public sees between Bill
and Hilary Clinton.  Every intimate discussion, each moment when there
might be a word that isn't politics-related, is absent from this film. 
This is clearly intentional on Nichols' part, because I imagine he's
trying to imitate, to an extent, the kind of view we have of the
President and his personal life.  </P>
<P>        This isn't to say that we see nothing of his personal life, because we
do.  We see that he gets "upset" when his wife finds out that he
probably had sex with a teenage girl (does anyone else find the thought
of this action deplorable?); similar reserved displays of emotion are
scattered throughout the film, but none of them paint a picture any
more-defined than the one we all have of Clinton.  Perhaps, if the point
of the film is specifically to document the details of a political
campaign, then my qualms with the handling of Stanton's character would
be invalid.  But if the point is just to show the campaign, then why go
to all the trouble to make Stanton a replica of Clinton?</P>
<P>        I'm not a fan of Clinton myself, but that's irrelevant.  Every single
scene that features Travolta--with the exception of none--is totally
plastic and insincere.  I didn't believe a word he said at any point
during the film.  When he gives his speeches to the uneducated masses
(apparently, the majority of the American public can not read and
continuously get fired from their factory jobs), each word Travolta
utters singed my nerves in a way no performance ever has.  Clinton
himself does not irritate me the way Travolta does in this film.  When
Travolta has scenes with Thompson, I feel like he's lying to her.  When
he's supposed to be "frank" and "honest" with the people around him, I
still feel like he's lying.  </P>
<P>        And again, if Nichols' point is to satirize the way we all think
politicians constantly lie, then hats off to him.  But he's created a
character and a situation, both of which we are clearly intended to care
about, and we do not, because 1) we don't know the guy, and 2) he
irritates us.  It simply doesn't work.</P>
<P>        In addition, many of the scenes in the film are frustrating and
peripheral to the story.  Billy Bob Thornton, for instance, plays a
character named Richard Jemmons who has nothing to do with the film, and
provides only a few scenes that develop his own pointless character. 
And the subplot involving Bates' character ends predictably--this entire
portion of the film, which is inserted to show the potential viciousness
of the Stantons, is routinely manipulative, and serves simply as
somewhere to end the film.</P>
<P>        Whatever minimal points I obligingly and generously give this film go
to the other actors:  Thompson is wonderful, and not given enough screen
time;  Lester is also very good, and plays his part convincingly; and
Bates is charismatic as always.  None of these actors can escape the
shadow of Travolta's tremendously wretched mockery of Clinton, however.</P>
<P>        I've heard that to criticize a film is to create a new one, but I can't
think of what might have made Primary Colors acceptable, or even
watchable, for that matter.  Wag the Dog, which was another political
film that I didn't enjoy, was at least consistent and thorough in its
endeavors.  Primary Colors wants to be intelligent and insightful, and
maybe it is when it comes to politics.  But it has so much extra stuff
for us to consider that it leaves us battered and confused as to what
it's trying to prove.  Films this inept and incoherent should be
illegal.</P>
