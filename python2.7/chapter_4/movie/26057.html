<PRE>THE LIFE AND TIMES OF HANK GREENBERG
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Aviva Kempner's THE LIFE AND TIMES OF HANK GREENBERG opens with "Take Me 
Out To The Ball Game" sung in Yiddish, which made it my second movie 
with Yiddish in a single day.  (The other was the phenomenal 
Romeo-and-Juliet story called SOLOMON AND GAENOR.)</P>
<P>Hank Greenberg, an amazing athlete, was the first Jew to make it big in 
the major leagues.  A "lumbering giant" on the field, he was a 6-foot-4 
first baseman who was twice named Most Valuable Player and who helped 
his team, the Detroit Tigers, win pennants and World Series.  Although a 
few Jews had some earlier, smaller successes in baseball, they changed 
their names to mask their ethnic identity.</P>
<P>This traditionally composed documentary tells the story of Greenberg's 
incredible career and of the prejudice that he faced.  It makes the 
point that all ethnic groups were harassed on the field, but, being the 
only Jew, Greenberg suffered more than the others like the Italians and 
the Irish.  Some of the film's talking heads, such as famous liberal 
lawyer Alan M. Dershowitz, see conspiracies afoot against Greenberg.  
When Greenberg came close to breaking Babe Ruth's home run record, 
Dershowitz claimed that the pitchers weren't being fair to Greenberg 
because he was a Jew, otherwise he would have cracked the record.  In an 
interview taped in 1983, Greenberg pooh-poohed this idea, claiming that 
he got a fair shot.  He said that he was proud to have come within 2 
home runs of Ruth's record and asked how many people can say that.</P>
<P>A boy from the Bronx who was born of Romanian-immigrant parents, he was 
more than just a hero to his old neighborhood, he was called the "king" 
and the "emperor."  Walking down the street, the kids flocked to him 
like a god.  "Growing up in the Bronx in the 30s, you thought of nothing 
but baseball and Hank Greenberg," Walter Matthau tells us.  Matthau says 
that Greenberg's success gave him confidence that he didn't have to go 
to work in the garment district when he grew up.</P>
<P>Many of the interviewees are labeled simply as "fan."  One of them says 
that they were what we call "groupies" today.  They worshiped Greenberg 
and followed him whenever they could.</P>
<P>Greenberg's focus generally wasn't on the more glamorous and traditional 
home runs or batting average.  Instead, he tried to get the highest 
number of RBIs (runs batted in) since that is what wins games.</P>
<P>The movie commendably and honestly spends almost as much time on 
Greenberg's failures as his successes.  People remember his big plays, 
but the film reminds us too of those times when he missed the key hit or 
the essential catch that could have won one of the big games. This 
approach gives the documentary a heightened sense of credibility.</P>
<P>When most people think of prejudice and baseball, they think of Jackie 
Robinson.  It turns out that towards the end of Greenberg's career, 
Robinson literally ran into him -- at first base.  Picking him up, 
Greenberg gave him a little advice and encouragement.  As much flack as 
Greenberg got, he said that nothing he experienced was as bad as what 
Robinson had to endure.</P>
<P>THE LIFE AND TIMES OF HANK GREENBERG runs 1:30.  It is not rated but 
would be a G and has nothing to offend anyone of any age.</P>
