<PRE>                             ABSOLUTE POWER
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>Given that the cast of ABSOLUTE POWER consists of some of our best
actors; and given that Clint Eastwood  turned out some fine films in
recent years, we have to wonder why this film is so bad.   Is Clint a
victim of the adage, "You can't win them all?"    Or is it the
improbable story of a President of The United States murdering a woman
with whom he is having a rendezvous and then having his aides involved
in a coverup? Whatever. The results are not good.</P>
<P>Luther Whitney (Clint Eastwood) is an expert thief, a master of
disguise (we are lead to believe. . . the disguises we see would not
fool a blind person)  who, after just getting out of prison wants to do
one final big job before retirement.   That seems like a rather stupid
reason to risk getting caught,  While in a mansion he has cased to rob,
he hears a noise and hides in a vault which just happens to have a
one-way mirror so he can see President Richmond (poor Gene Hackman is
hardly in the film)  perpetrate a murder. .  Talk about coincidence.</P>
<P>Once the murder is committed,  the Secret Service agent Tim Collin
(Dennis Haysbert) who is assigned to guard the President, has to
arrange getting the President out of the house and so on.  Another
agent (Scott Glenn) is also in on everything and even Gloria Russell
(Judy Davis), the President's Chief of Staff, has to save the day.
Davis has the one good role in the movie and, fine actress that she is,
she makes the most of it.</P>
<P>Others wasted in this nonsense are Ed Harris (a homicide detective), E.
G. Marshall (a millionaire wheeler and dealer who helped elect the
President) and Laura Linney who has the role of Luther Whitney's
daughter whom he has not seen in years . . . but that is another
story.   Ms. Linney looks very much like Helen Hunt, acts very much
like her, has her charm and even her hairdo.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Clint Eastwood.
