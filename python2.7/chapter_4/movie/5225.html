<PRE>                               TOMMY BOY
                       A film review by Jer Fairall
                        Copyright 1996 Jer Fairall</PRE>
<PRE>(1995) **
Starring Chris Farley, David Spade, Brian Dennehy, Bo Derek, Rob Lowe, Dan
Aykroyd
Directed By Peter Segal</PRE>
<P>     I know that the critics of America all disagree with me but I think
that Chris Farley is pretty funny. He was enjoyable back when Saturday
night Live was still watchable and he had a funny cameo in fellow
SNL-alumni Adam Sandler's vehicle "Billy Madison" and he is just as
amusing in his first starring vehicle "Tommy Boy." 
     The plot is pretty simple. Farley plays Tommy, the clumsy, overweight
and dim witted son of the wealthy owner of an automobile company (played
nicely Brian Dennehy). When tommy's father has an untimely passing, the
company is in danger of slipping out of the families hands and into the
posession of two scam artists (Bo Derek and Rob Lowe). So Tommy, with the
help of one of the companies ass-kissing employees (smugly played by SNL's
David Spade) goes on the road in order to sell enough goods to save the
company. 
     The bulk of the movie consists pretty much of things going wrong on
the road and Spade getting mad at Farley who is always screwing up
somehow. Alot of it seems to be trying to imitate the same formula from
the great John Candy/Steve Martin film "Planes Trains and Automobiles." 
     This is not a very hard movie to review. It's pretty much a
hit-and-miss comedy. I did enjoy Farley and I especially like the scene
where he and Spade end up singing along to the Carpenters shmaltz classic
"Superstar."  I just wish that the movie hit more than it missed.  </P>
