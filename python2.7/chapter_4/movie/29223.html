<P>AMERICAN OUTLAWS (2001) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Colin Farrell, Scott Caan,
Ali Larter, Gabriel Macht, Gregory Smith, Harris Yulin, Will McCormack, Ronny
Cox, Terry O'Quinn, Nathaniel Arcand, Kathy Bates and Timothy Dalton. Story by
Roderick Taylor. Screenplay by Taylor and John Rogers. Directed by Les Mayfield.
About 95 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence. 
 American Outlaws is a pretty, but disposable movie. </P>
<P> This feature is just another retelling of the Jesse James legend. It adds
nothing to the canon. Its only reason for being is to show off a few studly
young actors shooting pistols and riding horses. </P>
<P> The story of Jesse James has been told and retold so many times that it is
almost unnecessary to discuss the plot. After all, actors from Tyrone Power to
Roy Rogers to Clayton ("The Lone Ranger") Moore to James Keach have portrayed
the famed (or infamous, depending on your point of view) Missouri outlaw. </P>
<P> Under the direction of Les Mayfield (who is comfortable with remakes, having
helmed Flubber as well as Miracle on 34th Street), we get the same, tired
retread: brothers Jesse and Frank James, along with their cousins, the Younger
brothers, return home after the Civil War only to find that the evil railroad
interests are trying to buy up their land cheaply, and, when failing, are
fomenting a reign of terror to drive the farmers out. </P>
<P> Jesse, Frank and the Youngers declare war on the railroad, holding up their
banks and trains, giving some of the loot to their poor neighbors and acting
like 19th-century Robin Hoods. </P>
<P> The scenery is lovely, the action is quick-paced, the bullets fly and the
explosions are massive and loud. 
But, what gnaws at you as you watch is, Why another Jesse James movie? The only
notable divergence is a tip of the hat to contemporary gender equality as
Jesse's bride leads a daring rescue of her imprisoned husband. Big deal. </P>
<P> That is not say the film is not fun. It is very likable with a personable cast
headed by Colin Farrell as Jesse; Scott Caan (looking and sounding a lot like
his old man, James) as Cole Younger; Ali Larter as Jesse's woman, Zee; and
Gabriel Macht as the wise and careful Frank James. </P>
<P> Also in the cast is ex-007 Timothy Dalton as Allan Pinkerton, hired to capture
Jesse; and Harris Yulin and Terry O'Quinn as the hissable railroad baddies. </P>
<P> Farrell is a very pleasant Jesse, a soft-spoken young man, sure of himself and
of his mission. The film's only tension is between him and Caan's Cole Younger
as to who is the leader of their outlaw band. </P>
<P> Larter is most photogenic and she is given plenty of opportunity to wave around
her golden locks, which has a nice clean, sheen, considering she lives on a farm
in 19th century Missouri and is without any hair products. </P>
<P> American Outlaws is a nice diversion. It's one of those movies you watch, enjoy
for the moment then quickly forget. It won't bring about a resurgence in the
sadly neglected Western genre, but it should make enough money at the box office
for other filmmakers wanting to saddle up to consider looking west. </P>
