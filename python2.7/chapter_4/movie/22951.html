<P>_Isn't_She_Great_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>        "Great" is unlikely the word to come to the mind of audiences in regards
to author Jacqueline Susann after seeing her depiction in the loose comic
biography _Isn't_She_Great_.  More likely are the words "boorish,"
"brash," "annoying," and "untalented," which effectively sums up where
writer Paul Rudnick and director Andrew Bergman have gone wrong.</P>
<P>        "Untalented" is the key word out of those four.  _Isn't_She_Great_ is
less a biography than an episodic chronicle of the struggling film and
stage actress' (Bette Midler) obsessive pursuit of stardom, which finally
comes in 1966 when she pens the notoriously salacious
drug-addicted-and-sex-mad-starlets-in-Hollywood epic
_Valley_of_the_Dolls_.  I suppose Susann's tale of success is supposed to
be a tribute to the unwavering belief in one's dreams, and in reality it
may very well be.  Yet as presented in _Isn't_She_Great_, it's the story
of someone with no discernible talent achieving a wholly undeserved
success on sheer schmooze power.  And while her catty one-liners
(predictably delivered with gusto by Midler, who can do this character in
her sleep) are good for a chuckle here and there, all the attitude
doesn't necessarily make her more likable.</P>
<P>        What is designed to add some layer of likability is Susann's domestic
life, but it's botched in the execution.  She and her husband and
manager, Irving Mansfield (Nathan Lane) have an autistic son, but she has
hardly any scenes to establish a convincing love for the child (Mansfield
has more screen time with him).  Most of all, it's the romance between
Susann and Mansfield that's supposed to be the emotional hook.  However,
while I believed that he loved her (Lane's gentle performance help), I
always got the sense that she didn't love him so much as the help he did
her career.  This could not be more clear in a climactic scene where
Susann and Mansfield, having reached a crisis point, reconcile when she
asks him to be her agent.  The scene is played for laughs, but it hammers
home the point that it's his career aid and not his love that holds the
most importance to her.</P>
<P>        _Isn't_She_Great_ is never less than interesting.  If anything, the
one-liners from Midler and Stockard Channing (a bundle of meow as
Susann's actress friend Florence Maybelle) amuse, as does David Hyde
Pierce's warmed-over Niles Crane act as Susann's uptight editor Michael
Hastings; and the gaudy costume and production design serve as sweet eye
candy.  But bare minimum amusement cannot pass muster for a film that
dares to ask the question _Isn't_She_Great_.  Perhaps the real Jacqueline
Susann was, but one would be hard-pressed to pay the film incarnation the
same compliment.</P>
