THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT
A movie review by Joe Barlow
(c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING: Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams,
           and Joshua Leonard
DIRECTORS: Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sánchez
WRITERS: Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sánchez
RATED: R
RELEASED: 1999</PRE>
<P>In October of 1994, three student filmmakers began work on a
documentary about the Blair Witch, a creature of urban legend (ala
Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster) which supposedly lives in the woods
outside Burkittsville, Maryland. Laughing at these children's tales,
which many of the townsfolk still believed, the trio entered the woods
in search of material for their 'Blair Witch project.' </P>
<PRE>They were never seen again. </PRE>
<P>But their story did not vanish along with them: nearly a year after
their disappearance, their film was found by a group of archaeology
students from a nearby university. Using this footage, and only this
footage, filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez have pieced
together an 88-minute account of the trio's last days, revealing an
intimate portrait of an expedition gone horribly wrong. It's a raw,
heartwrenching tale, drenched in slowly mounting paranoia and madness.
Through their own camera lenses, we witness the group's skyrocketing
sense of desperation, as well as their growing alienation from one
another. Things go wrong-- major things, all of which culminate in
their inability to escape from the mysterious entity (or entities)
quietly stalking them in the darkness. </P>
<P>There's something cathartic about fear--a certain trait which allows
us to put our own lives into perspective. Things could always be
worse, horror movies assure us. Many films have attempted to
capatilize on our love and need for terror over the years-- stories
like Jaws, The Exorcist, Friday the 13th, The Shining, and hundreds
more. Often these movies succeed in giving us a harmless case of
nighttime shivers (and who among us hasn't enjoyed watching horror
movies with our friends, later professing that you weren't really that
scared even though you know deep down that you're lying?), but rarely
do the images stay with us after the sun comes up.  </P>
<P>No film, in fact, has triggered quite the same sensation of impending
doom and crawling flesh that I received from a recent screening of The
Blair Witch Project. This achievement is even more remarkable since
the movie, a small production even by independent cinema standards,
contains no name actors, no special effects, no script, only a handful
of props, and a budget residing somewhere in the 'used car' price
range. </P>
<P>It's very rare indeed to find a film, any film, which offers not only
a fresh, intriguing premise and superior performances, but also a
complete retooling of the entire filmmaking process. There is no
musical score here, nor smooth, clean editing (the story is presented
as it was shot--with abrupt starts and starts courtesy of the amateur
camera operators). But the movie's biggest surprise is the way that it
doesn't feel like a movie at all: it's more akin to a historical
record, like the infamous Zapruder Super 8 reel which captured John F.
Kennedy's assassination for posterity. </P>
<P>The movie is ficticious, of course, but you'd never know it. The
performances are so incredibly astounding that the tale could easily
pass for a real documentary (and in fact, it has fooled many viewers).
Of particular note is the incredible Heather Donahue, the leader of
the trio, who flawlessly conveys many complex emotions and, through
her flawless performance, makes us feel them too. She gets the movie's
standout scene, the one that will go down in movie lore ala the shower
scene from Psycho: a mesmerizing monologue, delivered directly to the
camera, in which she begs for forgiveness from her parents and the
families of her two male companions. She believes that she is to blame
for their current hopeless predicament, due to a judgment error made
early in the journey. Heather seems to know, as do we, that time is
running out for the group, and her plea for absolution is so
hardhitting, the look in her eyes so tragic and terrified, that the
viewer can easily be forgived for blinking back involuntary tears of
his or her own. The film's skillful manipulation of the audience's
fear is only accentuated by our knowledge that these precedings cannot
possibly have a happy ending. </P>
<P>In terms of pure originality, The Blair Witch Project is sheer genius.
It is quite simply the most original approach to filmmaking I've seen
in recent memory, as innovative and disarmingly unique today as
Citizen Kane was upon its release nearly sixty years ago. It's proof
that films don't have to cost a hundred million dollars to be
fascinating. The movie is intense, scary, brilliant, and perhaps the
best film of 1999 thusfar. </P>
<P>But be warned: much of the story's terror comes not from watching the
events of the story on the screen, but from witnessing them on mental
instant-reply as the clock ticks away the long, early hours of the
morning, when every sound in the darkness of your bedroom could be the
Blair Witch, come to get you. I wasn't particularly scared while
watching the movie. Then I tried to go to sleep an hour later. </P>
<PRE>Damn you, movie. </PRE>
<PRE>                            RATING: **** (out of a possible ****) </PRE>
<P>(The Blair Witch Project haunts the suburbs of your psyche on July
30th.) </P>
