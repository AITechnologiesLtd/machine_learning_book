<P>Comedy set during one day at the racetrack may be torture for serious 
punters.  Richard Dreyfuss finds he is on an uncharacteristic winning 
streak, but instead of cashing in his ticket he keeps parlaying his bet.  
As each race runs its course he finds himself seduced by the new levels 
of track society that open up before him.  You'll find yourself wanting 
to scream "Stop!" when Dreyfuss is about to make what may be his last 
gamble.  Despite being restricted to one setting, Ernest Moreton's 
script (from a novel by Jay Cronley) contains a real sense of 
progression.  Dreyfuss starts his day kneeling before a toilet in a 
punter's bar, but gradually moves through the different strata of the 
racetrack world - the Jockey Club, the cashier's office, the counting 
room; similarly, as his winnings accrue and he starts planning what to 
do with the money, we see his future being laid out before us; and of 
course there are the relationships that keep developing throughout the 
course of the story as he gets more attention.  Here, having too much 
money is just as offensive to the regular high-rollers than having too 
little.  Jennifer Tilly, in another of her bubblehead roles, seems to be 
attracted to Dreyfuss only because of his newly-won money (or is it 
luck?) but remains strangely consistent throughout the story.  The 
others don't seem to have any particular stance - cashier Robbie 
Coltrane does a 180o  turn, Dreyfuss' friends keep vacillating, and wife 
Teri Garr is in a state of constant bewilderment.</P>
<P>Dreyfuss gives an energetically comic performance - the kind of thing we 
thought he'd left behind with THE GOODBYE GIRL (and just the role Jack 
Lemmon would have played if this film had been made twenty years 
earlier).  He's an ideal choice for the role of a small-time gambler - 
his slight stature, beady eyes, and moustache make him look right at 
home at the track.  Garr, an appealing actress, is once again saddled 
with the Wife/Mother role (she'd already had one marriage on the rocks 
with Dreyfuss in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).  The fringe characters, right down 
to the smallest bit parts, all have personality.  Everyone has their own 
system, mostly reliant on intuition - although LET IT RIDE doesn't give 
the impression that it is pro-gambling.  Rather, its message is that 
there is no workable system, and that everyone has one "really good day" 
inside them, whether at the track, the office, the sports field, or 
anywhere else.  It's a feel-good movie without the schmaltz - the dreamy 
look on Dreyfuss' face during the vital seconds of his last race 
indicate that in his mind he has already won.  Or, to adopt a truism, 
it's not whether you win or lose, but how you place the bet that counts.  
The racetrack is utilized well as the film's central setting -  it's 
nice for a change to see a cinema portrayal of the track which is sunny, 
friendly and lively, instead of the usual seediness and vice that 
usually ends up on screen. </P>
