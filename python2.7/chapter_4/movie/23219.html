"The Whole Nine Yards"
Reviewed by John Haywood
Overall Rating: **</PRE>
<P>     Somewhere along the line, mobsters became fair game for
comedies.  "Analyze This," about a mafioso in psychotherapy, and "Gun
Shy," a romantic comedy focusing on a police officer pursuing the
mob, both had funny previews.  I haven't seen either movie (in fact,
"Gun Shy" hasn't been released yet), but, like them, "The Whole Nine
Yards" had amusing previews--unfortunately, "The Whole Nine Yards"
isn't as good as its advertising.
     Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Matthew Perry) is an unsuccessful
dentist and a henpecked husband.  His wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette)
dragged him back to her native Montreal and berates him for not
making enough money.  Then, when he comes home from work one day, he
meets his new neighbor.  He soon realizes his new neighbor is Jimmy
"The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), an ex-hitman hiding from mobster
Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollack).  Just when Oz starts to build a tense
friendship with Jimmy, his wife puts him on a plane to Chicago so he
can tip off the mob and collect the bounty on Tudeski's head.  Oz
plans to meet with a friend in Chicago, maybe have an affair, and,
above all, avoid any contact with the mob; but when he finds hitman
Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan) in his hotel room, his plans
soon change.
     "The Whole Nine Yards" doesn't quite know whether it wants to be
a comedy or a crime movie--and fails twice as a result.  It's amusing
when Oz first realizes who his new neighbor is--and instantly goes
from a slight feeling of deja vu to sheer terror.  What's funny for
two minutes begins to get annoying after an hour.  The problem is
that the movie takes all the mob activities perfectly seriously, and
relies on Oz's awkwardness around the criminals as the sole source of
jokes.  We have mob enforcers planning to kill each other, and only
one poor schmuck tripping over himself and drinking himself blind in
the background as a distraction.  This gives the audience a few funny
moments, such as when Oz runs into a glass door, or when Jimmy throws
Oz a beer--and the stunned Oz doesn't even try to catch it.  Most
straight crime-dramas are funnier and much less tedious, than "The
Whole Nine Yards."
     The movie also strains credibility in several places.  For
instance, why does Oz stay with his shrew of a wife?  When she and
her mother are ruining his personal, professional, and financial
lives, how could the disastrous divorce settlement he fears possibly
be worse?  It's not love--putting aside their mutual acrimony, while
he's in Chicago, Oz falls in love with another woman; of course, the
awkward protagonist falling in love with the worst possible woman at
the worst possible time, with no explanation other than the fact that
the woman in question was there and vaguely disliked him (old
romantic comedy technique--if you hate someone, it's true love),
doesn't exactly help the film's credibility either.  Neither does the
fact that his lover--who nearly everyone else in the film has a
reason to kill--is still alive despite her frequent contact with
mobsters.  It might be one thing if the non sequiturs were funny, but
they're not jokes; they're just careless writing.
     The movie isn't a total loss.  There are a few funny moments.
Bruce Willis delivers a strong performance; his character isn't as
complex as Dr. Crowe from "The Sixth Sense" (or even Harry Stamper
from "Armageddon"), but, there's something to an actor who can make a
mob hitman likeable.  Similarly, Michael Clarke Duncan is also
charming (though at this point, I'm not sure what it says when a
movie's only likeable characters are mass murderers).
     While "The Whole Nine Yards" may try to appear kinder and
gentler than your average crime movie, don't let that fool you.
There are several on-screen murders, plenty of strong language, a
fairly strong sex scene, and full frontal nudity.
     Apparently, the expression "the whole nine yards" comes from
World War II machine gunners' ammunition belts being nine yards
long--"the whole nine yards" meant that you shot off all you could
without reloading.  In contrast, while the title phrase may tell of a
lot of ammunition, the movie "The Whole Nine Yards" itself fires
blanks.</P>
