<P>It must be tough to be a mob boss. Just ask Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro),
a man who finds his job as Mafia head to be rather stress inducing. I
can believe it, too - one can't even begin to fathom the turmoil he must
go through when he's forced to choose between an ice pick, baseball bat
or sledgehammer to torture victims with. Suffering from reoccurring
panic attacks, Paul decides he needs to consult some professional help.</P>
<P>And who better than Billy Crystal. After appearing in
bottom-of-the-barrel flops, Father's Day and My Giant, Crystal finally
finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here. Playing
Vitti's private shrink, the two very different stars strike an
unorthodox, but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable
comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish. Casting Robert
DeNiro as Paul Vitti is something of an in-joke, I think. Placed in this
mobster's shoes, DeNiro gets to spoof  characters he himself played in
films like The Godfather, Part II and Casino. It's obvious he's having a
lot of fun doing so.</P>
<P>The man behind the camera is Harold Ramis, whose credits include
Ghostbusters (as writer and star), and his best directing effort, the
Bill Murray vehicle, Groundhog Day. Ramis has a knack for drawing laughs
because he simply knows what's funny, and here he manages to accentuate
the strengths of nearly all the actors. The only character who weakens
the payoff is Crystal's bride-to-be (Lisa Kudrow). Playing the same
dumbed-down role as she does in Friends, Kudrow is amusing, but doesn't
fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped.</P>
<P>The supporting cast sparkles. Joe Viterelli is hilarious as Jelly,
Vitti's pea brained right-hand man, and Chazz Palminteri is a show
stopper playing a fellow mobster who's in desperate need of the
definition of `closure'. The movie manages to maintain
consistent chuckles throughout, putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really
big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides. The
situation is just too cute to resist.</P>
<P>It's unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand. But hey,
if you're in the Mafia, using obscenities probably comes naturally. And
near the end, seeing Billy Crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob
boss is truly a special treat.</P>
