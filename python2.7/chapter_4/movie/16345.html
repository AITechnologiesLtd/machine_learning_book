<PRE>Bulworth</PRE>
<P>Starring Warren Beatty, Halle Berry and Oliver Platt
Directed By Warren Beatty
Running Time: 1 hour 40 minutes.</P>
<PRE>(20th Century Fox)</PRE>
<P>Warren Beatty returns to the screens in the   funniest, craziest and hard
hitting movie in his career. Based on a story concocted by himself, and also
written by Beatty, Bulworth gives a good insight of what Beatty thinks of
the American government system. Beatty stars as Senator Jay Bulworth, who's
going through a nervous breakdown. After hiring someone to kill him, he
completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about
what's _really_ happening in American politics, much to the annoyance of
assistant Dennis Murphy (Platt.)   Instead of everyone hating him, the
American public love him. However, inside his party, more people want to
kill him than just the hired assassin. And he also strikes a relationship
with black girl Nina (Berry.)</P>
<P>It's remarkable that this film was released at all. Much more open than the
rather subdued Primary Colours, Bulworth barely gives the American politic
system a good name. The outrageous remarks Bulworth makes to his potential
voters are very funny, and also somewhat true. It's great that Beatty isn't
afraid to let loose on a subject. Talking of Beatty, he's excellent in the
role of the demented Senator, clearing having fun. And seeing Warren Beatty
have fun is a rare sight indeed. Even in Dick Tracy, he was the most
straighten face actor. (Then again, he was the only characters face we could
completely see.) The film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old Beatty to
indulge in some rapping, which he does with gusto (and also quite well.) And
seeing Beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed. It's nice to see
that Beatty can laugh at himself. Second best is Oliver Platt as the
flustered, coke snorting assistant, who goes over the top when he finally
snaps. Halle Berry is fine, and sexy, as the intellectual Nina, who comes to
like the senator. Also popping up in the supporting cast is Paul Sorvino wit
h a strange accent, Laurie Metcalf as the exact same characters she's also
played, and Christine Baranski of Cybill fame as Bullworths wife, who all
contribute to the fun. And, this being a political film, the ubiquitous
Larry King makes an appearance, as, *shock*, himself.</P>
<P>The writing and directing, both by Beatty, are above par. The direction is
very nearly sitcom like, but suits the film perfectly, and both the politics
are gangland parts are handled well. The script is funny, and the raps are
actually well produced and humorous, and quite clever. They're not cringe
inducing, at least. The script makes many points about society in America
today, and isn't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed
system. Best of all, the film is thought provoking, but directed and written
in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather, and is very
entertaining. There's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen
tunes.</P>
<P>Bulworth is a film with many advantages, and few flaws. Perhaps it could be
somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping, but Beatty does it
so well it's irrelevant. In fact, there's very little against Bulworth,
except for the language which is very heavy, but then again it should be
expected. Bulworth, then, is well worth watching.</P>
