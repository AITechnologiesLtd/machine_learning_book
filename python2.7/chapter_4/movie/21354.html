<PRE>Come on Get "Happy"
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>Somewhere nestled in the heart of the Lone Star state
is a small town where the citizens are as close to one
another as they are to their own families.  This place
(and the film's title) is Happy, Texas. It's the
typical postcard-pretty, one-sheriff town where
everyone knows each other's name.  One of the biggest
events for this charming community is the Little Miss
Fresh-Squeezed Pre-Teen Beauty Pageant.  Every year,
Happy's adorable little girls compete for the right to
represent their town in a statewide competition if
they can win.  But year after year, the little girls
aren't up to snuff.  This year, Happy will be the host
town of this year's pageant.  Knowing how well they've
performed in the past, the local community leaders
decide that they need some professional help to ensure
a good showing.  They anxiously await the arrival of
two men, who are just as well known for their success
at pageant consulting as well as their outwardly gay
lifestyle.  What they unknowingly get instead are two
on-the-run escapees from a local prison.  How does
this happen?</P>
<P>Prisonmates Harry (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne (Steve
Zahn) escape from their prison van and manage to steal
a beat up RV.  What they don't know is that the RV
belongs to the two previously mentioned pageant
consultants.  Though Harry and Wayne try to drive as
far away as possible, their van breaks down nearby
Happy.  Chappy Dent (William F. Macy), the town's
sheriff happens upon them saying, ‘we've been looking
for you.'  They are escorted back into town where the
two think that they are being arrested.  Totally
clueless about what's really going on, they soon learn
that they are actually being hired and are supposed to
be a gay couple.  This strikes them as totally
shocking.  They want to escape, but Harry notes that
the town's bank would be an easy target, so they
devise a plan to stay.  Harry will befriend Jo, the
bank's president (Ally Walker), as he figures out how
to execute the heist.  Meanwhile, Wayne will take on
the responsibility of training the girls for the
pageant.</P>
<P>This wild setup starts off a very funny movie that
mixes elements of mistaken identities and ‘fish out of
water.'  Zahn is extremely funny as the loony convict,
Wayne, who can barely keep himself from screaming.  To
start the little girls' training, he sings `99 Bottle
of Beers on the Wall.'  Harry's job is perhaps not as
difficult because Jo needs a friend that she can
confide in.  She takes comfort in the fact that she's
gay.  She speaks her mind and lets him explore her
house, which is his opportunity to learn the
combination of the safe.  It is not surprising that
Harry begins to fall for Jo or that Wayne begins to
fall for one of the teachers.  But because everyone
thinks that they're gay, Harry and Wayne must be very
careful not to give away their true identities.  This
situation becomes painfully funny as the two continue
to mingle with the various townsfolk and push through
with their tasks.</P>
<P>"Happy Texas" is a good-natured story that puts two
completely unprepared people in a situation totally
beyond their control.  They wrestle with the absurdity
of their predicament and squirm with agony.  The
result is a film that is funny and amusing and one of
the real comedic gems of the fall season.  </P>
