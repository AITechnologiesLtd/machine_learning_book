<P>     Although I loved this film when I recently saw it in Australia, my
initial reaction was that maybe it only spoke to gay men.  However, I
took two straight girl friends to see it this weekend, and they both
said "this is *my* life!"--so I'm recommending it to a wider audience.</P>
<P>     Amazingly, with only a $7,000 budget,  P. J. Castellaneta has
pulled together a credible and compelling B/W 35mm film about 2 guys
dialoguing "the morning after."  There's nothing to compare it to, but
one might be tempted to label it MY DINNER WITH ANDRE meets A MAN AND A
WOMAN ... with an all-male cast!</P>
<P>     It becomes clear within the first few minutes that (a) after a
one-night stand these two guys had sex and (b) they didn't use a condom.
The film transcends the expected "ABC Afterschool Special" heavy hitting
morality approach, and deals believably with trust, self-delusion, and
accepting the consequences of our choices.  In terms of addressing
issues of safe sex, and the "new/new" morality, the film effectively
deals with just about every self-deluding argument you might personally
encounter OR manufacture.</P>
<PRE>     (Semi-Spoiler follows) ....</PRE>
<P>     Terry Curry, as the heart throb hunk who turns out to be a "Married
with Children" bisexual, will strike a chord with many a wronged
straight gal, and may cause a few straight guys to fidget in their seats
from unwelcomed self-recognition.  Todd Stites is fairly believable as
the more "out" and usually "responsible" gay man.  Unfortunately he
inherits the lion's share of dreary political pronouncements, though
there are some delicious quotes (e.g., "Believe you me, there was
many a press-on nail and high heel that was broken to preserve our
rights" and "I don't think a drowning man is equipped to save the
whales.")</P>
<P>     Through both actor's gifted performances and the deft direction,
the unexpected result is that the characters are ultimately identical to
just about any straight guy that you might know, from the workplace to
the gym.  (Unexpected, that is for an *American* film to achieve such an
amazing revelation.)  The film should be viewed in the same spirit as
SOUNDER, which broke ground back in the 70's portraying a Black family
with few of the then prevailing stereotypes.  If you go to see it,
overlook the fact that the background music will occasionally remind you
of one of those early Sunday morning shows put on by the Brothers of
St. Paul, and that in the opening scenes the director got a little
over-fascinated with the effect of headlights through the patterned
curtains on the slumbering duo.  All of the "action" takes place on a
checkered bed spread (obviously a chess board) and the actors appear to
be lit only by a gooseneck lamp, (but amazingly they are well lit enough
to allow every nuance of expression show through, even when shadows
create "racoon eyes.")  There are some elements that over stretch
credibility (like them both having the same dream--are they aspects
of the same person?)</P>
<P>     If this were a major studio effort, I'd give it a 7, but making
allowances for the fact that only 4 people were in involved, (2 actors,
1 director/writer/caterer and 1 cameraman) it warrants an 8.</P>
<P>     The film also breaks new ground in that, despite it's "adult"
theme, there is *no* nudity, (the heater's broken so they put on their
sweats) *no* sex, *no* violence and *scant* profanity.  You don't even
see these guys kiss on the lips!  The magic of story telling and seeing
off screen characters in your own mind's eye holds this film together...
something that hasn't been done for a long, long time.  In terms of
criteria for content rating towards an NC-17 this film could be
shown on the Disney channel.   (Don't hold your breath, though!)</P>
<P>     Currently at San Francisco's Castro through Thurs 1/7; expect it at
San Jose's Camera 3, and possibly the Varsity in Palo Alto.  If it comes
out on Video, it'll be tough to locate.  At best, it might show up on
three or four PBS stations next Gay Pride week in June before it goes
into oblivion.</P>
