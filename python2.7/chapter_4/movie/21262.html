<P>Bats are scary.  Even though they are gentle, passive creatures that
will only bite in self-defense if they are picked up and handled, bats
still have a bad reputation.  Their presence is an indicator of a
healthy ecosystem.  They are good for the rainforest, they eat annoying
insects and their rate of rabies infection isn't more than any other
species (about 1 in 1,000).  But try rationalizing this to a person that
has a bat swooping around their attic at night and you are likely to
find yourself trampled by said person.</P>
<P>In Bats, the first offering from new Hollywood player Destination Films,
the director of Carnosaur 2 (Louis Morneau) is teamed with Gladiator
screenwriter John Logan to make one of the worst films of the year, if
not the entire decade.  It's not scary.  In fact, that Bugs Bunny
cartoon with the vampire that turns into a half-man/half-bat after
hearing the words `Hocus Cadabra' was scarier.  The filmmakers and
actors think they're making an Oscar contender, while they should be
playing everything with a sarcastic edge – like in Lake Placid.</P>
<P>Bats takes place in Gallup, Texas, and in the first scene we watch the
token young couple attacked by killer bats that claw their way through
the ragtop car roof and chomp on the teens' jugulars.  Flash to the
Arizona desert, where Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer, Starship Troopers), a
wildlife zoologist with a specialty in Chiroptera, is in a cave studying
docile bats with her idiotic sidekick Jimmy (León, OZ).  A chopper from
the Center for Disease Control lands nearby and whisks the two off to
Gallup to help them investigate the grisly deaths.</P>
<P>As it turns out, these bloodthirsty bats were actually a decade-long
government experiment that took Flying Foxes – an Indonesian bat with a
six-foot wingspan – and genetically increased their natural
intelligence, developed their ability to work as a team, as well as
making them aggressive and carnivorous.  Two of these killing machines
have escaped and infected the entire bat population of Gallup.  Their
creator, Dr. McCabe (Bob Gunton, Patch Adams), is one of the lamest evil
scientists in the history of movie bad guys.</P>
<P>Together with local Sheriff Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips, I Lost
my Wife to Melissa Etheridge), Casper and the bat-phobic Jimmy
brainlessly try to think of ways of stopping the bats from escalating
their nightly attacks on the town.  Their big idea is to hole up in the
school, covering each door and window with electrified chain-link
fencing, despite the fact that the bats were able to squeeze through a
car's ventilation system in an earlier scene.  How would a chain-link
fence be any more protective?</P>
<P>Kimsey, Casper and Jimmy proceed to an abandoned mine, where the throngs
of bats have congregated.  The Army is trying to trap them in the mine
and annihilate them using a large refrigeration device, since cold
temperatures are lethal to the winged critters.  But the bats wipe out
the Army, too, leaving Kimsey and Casper to venture into the mine
wearing what resembles scuba gear.  This, despite knowing that the bats
gnawed their way through a ragtop car roof.</P>
<P>Kimsey, in all of the wisdom his shallow character can muster, turns and
fires a pistol at the approaching bats as he flees the mine.  There are
millions of them - what does he think a few bullets would do?  This is
after he and Casper were chest-deep in a river of bat guano and he
decided to light a flare.  Maybe I don't know a lot about bats or the
flammability of their guano, but I would have second and third thoughts
about introducing flame to large amounts of the dung of any animal.  And
speaking of bat knowledge, aren't they supposed to be blind?  On several
occasions, the director offers a view from the perspective of a bat,
which is apparently red-hued and slanty.</P>
<P>Bats is a terrible mess when it should be a tongue-in-cheek mockery of
the genre.  The writer's idea of intentional laughs are León's awful
one-liners that fall as flat as Meyer's tummy.  He's a Chris Tucker
wannabe; a black Shaggy without the sidekick, left to lifelessly shout
dumb stuff like, `I don't like the sound of that,' `I hate this shit'
and the inevitably original `Damn.'  Hopefully, Logan's next script –
Oliver Stone's Christmas football pic Any Given Sunday – will be a bit
crisper. Morneau's action sequences are choppy and tough to make out,
and although the disgusting bats resemble a certain senior Senator from
North Carolina, they fail to terrify.</P>
<P>1:30 - PG-13 for bat attacks and adult language</P>
