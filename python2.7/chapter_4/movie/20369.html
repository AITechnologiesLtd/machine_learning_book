<PRE>_Chill_Factor_ (R) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Note to struggling actors everywhere: if you think winning an Academy
Award will make your career spring to life, look at the career of Cuba
Gooding Jr.  While he has appeared in small roles in two decent films
(_As_Good_As_It_Gets_, _What_Dreams_May_Come_) in the scant two years
since he won his Supporting Actor Oscar for _Jerry_Maguire_, the lead
roles he has landed have been less than satisfactory: in the overwrought
melodrama _Instinct_ and now in the routine buddy actioner
_Chill_Factor_.</P>
<P>Even more depressing about Gooding's involvement in _Chill_Factor_ is
that he's relegated to token wisecracking African-American sidekick to
ever-so-vanilla Skeet Ulrich, who has the true starring role here.  Or
perhaps that is a good thing since this tepid action comedy is not
exactly one would be proud to headline (though Gooding is top billed). 
Ulrich's Tim Mason is the central character, a young diner worker in a
small Montana town who comes into the possession of "Elvis," an explosive
chemical substance.  As instructed by a scientist friend, Tim must
deliver the chemical to a military station in a town 90 miles away before
some baddies can use it for their nefarious purposes.  The catch?  The
chemical must remain frozen, for at 50 degrees, it combusts.  Enter Arlo
(Gooding), ice cream delivery man, who is dragged into the dirty affair
when Tim decides to use his refrigerated truck for transport.</P>
<P>Thus begins one long chase, where our mismatched duo bickers and bonds
while pursued by evil military types (led by Peter Firth and _Xena_ and
former _Melrose_Place_ vixen Hudson Leick) in cars and on motorcycles. 
It's all fairly routine, but director Hugh Johnson is able to come up
with a couple of diverting action sequences, namely one where Arlo and
Tim must steer the truck on a narrow, blown-out mountain roadway; and
another where the two ride a boat down a steep hill.</P>
<P>What neither Johnson nor Gooding and Ulrich can redeem is the limp
banter given them by writers Drew Gitlin and Mike Cheda.  Most of the
laugh lines are given to Gooding, and, to his credit, he obviously
attempts to infuse as much punch into them as is humanly possible. 
Unfortunately, this results in a way over-the-top performance that can
best be described as a feature-length riff on his famously energized
Oscar acceptance speech.  But at least he displays some signs of life,
which cannot be said for Ulrich; as in the awful _Touch_, the last film
he was called on to carry, Ulrich makes for a flavorless, uninteresting
presence that is much too weak on which to hang an entire picture.</P>
<P>_Chill_Factor_ is a competently made studio assembly-line product, and
that ultimately is the problem.  Without anything remotely extraordinary
to its credit, it is taken in by the eyes with relative ease, but leaves
nothing of substance to penetrate any deeper.</P>
