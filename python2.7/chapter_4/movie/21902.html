<PRE>Review: The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc      </PRE>
<PRE>        Starring Milla Jovovich, John Malkovich, Faye
        Dunaway, Dustin Hoffman, Tcheky Karyo.
        Written and directed by Luc Besson.</PRE>
<P>Itâ€™s so tempting to make fun of this movie.  Luc Besson (â€œLa
Femme Nikita,â€? â€œThe Fifth Elementâ€?) insisted on casting his
girlfriend in the title role over the objections of the original
director, who was fired from the project.  Milla Jovovich
herself, model / pop singer / actress, seems like a classic case
of celebrity over-reaching. She is probably best known in the
U.S. for lisping her way through those Feria Hair Color
commercials on TV and for her role in â€œThe Fifth Element,â€? a
Bruce Willis sci-fi spoof where she played an alien. (She kept
saying â€œMulti-passâ€?; I think it was about her only line in
English in that movie.)  Milla is drop-dead gorgeous: she looks
like sheâ€™s about six feet tall and weighs maybe seventy-five
pounds, so she must be as dumb as a post, and the idea of her
taking on a role as complex as that of the legendary, enigmatic
Jeanne Dâ€™Arc has got to be some kind of joke.</P>
<P>Well, surprise of surprises.  I went to this movie to make fun of
it and ended up liking it. A lot.  It captivated me right from the
beginning and just kept getting better all the way through to the
end.  Besson presents a modern interpretation of Jeanne, a
Jeanne driven more by psychological damage than by religious
inspiration.  She has visions and hears voices all right, but
thatâ€™s because sheâ€™s clearly schizophrenic.  They begin when
sheâ€™s a little girl.  The local priest is light-heartedly chiding
young Jeanne about her twice-daily visits to the confessional
when she tells him about her visions.  Sheâ€™s both compulsive
and she has hallucinations, setting off alarm bells in a modern
audience.  </P>
<P>This medieval priest doesnâ€™t know what to make of her.
Heâ€™s not alone; neither does the Dauphin Charles (Malkovich),
who would be King of France but for the occupying English
forces.  Exiled to the provincial backwater of Chinon, heâ€™s a
man grasping at straws.  When Jeanne arrives claiming to be
on a mission from God to drive out the English and have him
crowned King, and she passes a little test he has devised for
her, he gives her an army to go relieve the besieged city of
Orleans.  He figures he has little enough to lose.</P>
<P>This is all very improbable.  If it werenâ€™t real history, it would
be downright unbelievable.</P>
<P>What this seventeen year old peasant girl accomplished is well
documented.  How she managed to do it is fertile ground for
speculation.  Countless historians and novelists have tried, and
there are nearly as many different Jeanne Dâ€™Arcs as there are
writers about her. (Even Mark Twain had a go at it.)  Luc
Bessonâ€™s Jeanne, schizophrenic and manic-depressive, is very
persuasive during her manic episodes, which are many.  Her
visions are utterly real to her and her manic energy is both
refreshing and inspiring to the Dauphinâ€™s dispirited followers. 
Gallows humor prevails among the professional soldiers in
command of the hopeless defense of Orleans: they gave
themselves up for dead months ago.  Almost as soon as Jeanne
arrives, she begins screaming hysterically at them because they
wonâ€™t listen to her.  With a collective Gallic shrug, they
acquiesce.  They suspect sheâ€™s kind of crazy, but as soldiers
they know that leading a frontal assault against heavily
defended enemy positions, being a little crazy is a good thing. 
Jeanne is ignorant of the methods of warfare, and her tactics
are unorthodox to the point of being comical. The English are
soon laughing out of the other side of their necks though.  Are
her successes just beginnerâ€™s luck? On this point as well as
many others, this film is deliberately ambiguous. </P>
<P>Jay Carr, film critic for The Boston Globe, stated flatly in his
review that Jovovich canâ€™t act.  Well, it sure looks like acting
to me.  The character walks a fine line between being very
peculiar indeed and being deranged, and she has to hold the
audienceâ€™s sympathy while doing it.  In one key scene, Jeanne
is wounded by an arrow.  Itâ€™s unclear whether itâ€™s in her
shoulder or her chest (thereâ€™s that ambiguity again.) Sheâ€™s
carried off the battlefield and surrounded by the Dauphinâ€™s
captains, who are terrified that sheâ€™ll die.  Impatient of the
arrival of a physician, she yanks the arrow out herself, like a
particularly stoical John Wayne.  But then she starts to cry,
because it hurts, and sheâ€™s scared.  Jovovich jumps between
these different modes like a switch being flipped, making
Jeanne a fascinating, puzzling yet somehow coherent character. 
Standing  in a cold rain outside the city walls, shivering in a
splendid suit of armor while her attack on Paris fizzles around
her, sheâ€™s noble and pathetic, absurd and absurdly courageous
all at once.   Maybe Jovovich would be lousy doing Jane
Austen, but sheâ€™s perfect in this role, where sheâ€™s bouncing off
walls, being three things at once.</P>
<P>Besson brings a thoroughly modern sensibility to his
interpretation of Jeanneâ€™s story.  There is no attempt to make
the dialogue sound fifteenth-century, and the charactersâ€™
motives never seem quaint.  In terms of character, there are
even similarities between â€œ The Messengerâ€? and his â€œLa
Femme Nikita.â€? Yet he sticks closely to the historical record. 
He uses visual symbolism to effectively blur the line between
reality and hallucination, without getting cute about it.  His
quick edits have the same effect, and have the added benefit of
keeping the narrative from becoming too seamless and
self-assured, something that would undercut the ambiguity.
(These quick edits that have been derided as â€œMTV-like,â€? as if
montage was something invented by American television!) 
The battle scenes do for medieval warfare what â€œSaving
Private Ryanâ€? did for the landing at Omaha Beach, and are
almost worthy of Akira Kurosawa.  Lastly, â€œThe Messengerâ€?
isnâ€™t without humor; it even has some Pythonesque bits.</P>
<P>Donâ€™t let the negative reviews keep you from seeing this
movie.  It wonâ€™t be the same experience on video.</P>
