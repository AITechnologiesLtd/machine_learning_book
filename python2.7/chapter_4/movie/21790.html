<PRE>                                THE LIMEY
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Part of me feels like I didn't really get THE LIMEY.  Though it's a
spare 85 minutes, director Steven Soderbergh always has a trick or two
up his sleeve, and I was sure some twists were in store for me.</P>
<P>     Witness OUT OF SIGHT, with criminal and cop falling into an
unlikely romance.  Witness SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE, which broke the
indie film scene wide open.  Witness SCHIZOPOLIS – you know, all of it.</P>
<P>     But no matter how many ways I slice it, despite the critical smash
that THE LIMEY has become, the film failed to impress me much.  The
story is trite:  British ex-con (Stamp) flies to L.A. to avenge his
daughter's death, which he assumes is the result of foul play due to a
music magnate (Fonda).  Expecting a clever plot twist, I waited and
waited, and then the movie was over.</P>
<P>     This isn't to say that THE LIMEY isn't a well-made film.  As usual,
Soderbergh is innovative behind the camera, with flashbacks,
flash-forwards, flashes sideways, alternate realities, and optical
trickery.  While this is distracting, it does server to make the film
more visceral and fun.  Stamp and Fonda make for interesting rivals, but
neither really owns the film.  The most intriguing part of THE LIMEY is
Stamp's limey slang: words like `snaffle' and `doolally' that spice up
the lingo a la A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (though never with the same power).</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, THE LIMEY falls into that class of films that is
perfectly watchable but ultimately forgettable.  Soderbergh fans will
rejoice.  The rest of the world will scratch its collective head.</P>
