<PRE>RASHOMON (1950)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Akira Kurosawa
Writers: Shinobu Hashimoto and Akira Kurosawa (based on the stories
"Rashomon" and "In a Grove" by Ryunosuke Akutagawa)
Starring: Toshirô Mifune, Machiko Kyô, Masayuki Mori, Takashi Shimura,
Minoru Chiaki, Kichijiro Ueda, Fumiko Honma</P>
<P>Watching Kurosawa's "Rashomon," I was reminded of the bits and pieces I
saw of the O.J. Simpson trial, or really any trial that goes on
forever.  The attorneys are all trying to dig up clues to what really
happened, brining in star witnesses to tell their side of the story, and
wouldn't you know it if most of them conflicted in some way(s) with the
others.  O.J. might have gotten off, but whether or not he did what some
people say he did is something we may never find out.  Truth may be in
the eye of the beholder, but nine-and-a-half times out of ten, it's not
the real truth.</P>
<P>"Roshomon," the breakthrough film for the incredible Japanese director,
Akira Kurosawa (who would go on to direct "The Seven Samurai,"
"Yojimbo," and "Ran," among many others), deals with three people
stranded at Roshomon, the gate of Japan in the medieval days, during an
intense rain storm.  They are: a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura), a priest
(Minoru Chiaki), and a nomad (Kichijiro Ueda).  The woodcutter is
ravaged due to a murder trial he witnessed, and proceeds to tell them
everything that occured for the duration of the storm.</P>
<P>Whilst journeying out to the woods, he stumbled upon a murder, went to
alert the police, and was dragged to the trial, which dealt with a
bandit named Tajomuru (the great Toshirô Mifune) who allegedly raped a
woman (Machiko Kyô), and killed her husband (Masayuki Mori).  His story
says that he wooed her and fought for her in a duel with the husband,
whom he then killed.  But her story is that she was raped, and
accidentally killed her husband because he could not trust her after she
was raped.  Two more perspectives are told, and each one ends up
conflicting with all the others.  Who is telling the truth?</P>
<P>That we don't find out.  Since only three to four people were involved
with it, either directly or indirectly, and each of them tells a
different story, there is no way of knowing the real truth.  Should we
pick one and say that is the general accepted truth?  Even a trial like
the one in this film can never truly discover what really happened.  We
will probably never know the real truth because whomever tells what
happens puts a personal spin on it for some personal reason.</P>
<P>The four stories are deftly written so to provide basis for the
characters who tell them.  They reveal so much about these people, that
it is obvious that none of these stories are the real truth, and that
whatever really happened is probably a composite of the four, with
different things right and wrong in each of them.  These people may be
suffering from guilt or some other personal problem, but each of them
cannot tell the whole truth for some reason, sometimes unexplained
blatantly, but disguised ingeniusly within the respective narrative.</P>
<P>The film is not only a landmark for being one of the most philosophical
and brilliant films of all time, but is also one of the most
entertaining.  At a short running time of 88 minutes (give or take a
second), the film is in constant motion, and is never boring.  Even
though we see the same story four times with different perspectives,
each time it's refreshing and as interesting as the last.  Not to
mention there is some really fun samurai action throughout - a staple of
Kurosawa's work.</P>
<P>Another out of the million things I love about this movie is how it
never explains what happens.  In "Courage Under Fire," we discovered the
truth, but that was for a different reason, although I can see it
actually being better if we never did.  This film presents us the facts,
but allows the viewer to debate over it.  And I don't know about you,
but I adore film as a form of debate.</P>
<P>With amazing direction, wonderful acting, and a deft screenplay, it is
no wonder to why it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film.  "Rashomon" is
after all a fable of man's inability to tell the truth, and one of those
films which you discuss and rack through your mind over and over again,
looking for the truth.  My argument: the truth is not to be found.  And
that's the cold hard truth about man kind.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
