<PRE>Lost In Space
Rated PG-13
By James Sanford
The Kalamazoo Gazette<HR></PRE>
<P>Ten years ago, William Hurt was "The Accidental Tourist" and now, he's "Lost
In Space."</P>
<P>That might seem like a journey from the sublime to the ridiculous, except
that the big-screen version of the 1960s TV show is considerably more
technically sophisticated and slightly more cerebral than the original,
which was notable chiefly for its charmingly absurd stories and
bargain-basement monsters: Remember the episode featuring the dreaded giant
carrot?</P>
<P>As TV-to-movie adaptations go, "Lost In Space" is probably one of the more
respectable entries in the field, with expensive production values adding a
classy sheen to what's essentially cheesy material. The film features some
impressive computer-generated animation, Akiva Goldman's script incorporates
mini-tributes to everything from the "Star Wars" movies to "The Waltons,"
and director Stephen Hopkins has avoided playing the movie as camp.
Still, something has been left out. Goldman ups the IQs - if not the
maturity levels - of most of the stalwart Robinson family and even
introduces a bit of dramatic dysfunction. Unfortunately he accomplishes this
at the expense of the characters' charms, so although libido-driven pilot
Don West (Matt LeBlanc) and disgruntled pre-teen Penny (Lacey Chabert) seem
much more human than their television counterparts, they're also less fun to
have around.</P>
<P>The Goldman creations that really work are his revisions of professor John
Robinson (Hurt) and the diabolical Dr. Smith (Gary Oldman). On the show,
Robinson rarely projected anything except concern, but Hurt humanizes the
man, introducing subtle twin undercurrents of jealousy toward youthful Don -
who's hot for John's daughter Judy (Heather Graham) - and Robinson's own
father, a legendary military strategist whom Don idolizes. Goldman also
restores Smith's dark heart (which vanished early on in the show), much to
Oldman's obvious delight. Graham and Mimi Rogers as mom Maureen, on the
other hand, are given little to do.</P>
<P>The first half of the film parallels the series' set-up, as scheming Dr.
Smith sabotages the Robinsons' mission to find a new Earth and, in the
process, becomes trapped aboard the Jupiter 2 spacecraft with the family as
they hurtle into unexplored galaxies. There's a fair amount of suspense as
the crew almost crashes into the sun and later discovers an abandoned ship
with a scary secret.</P>
<P>As he's proven in his scripts for the last two "Batman" movies, however,
Goldman is not particularly skilled at building plots. Though the last third
of "Lost In Space" introduces all sorts of intriguing concepts, Goldman
doesn't develop any of them particularly well, and the less said the better
about the excruciatingly cutesy Blawp, a combination monkey-chameleon which
looks glaringly fake and exists for no reason other than possible marketing
tie-ins.</P>
<P>Fans of the TV version will be amused by the cameos early on by series stars
June Lockhart, Angela Cartwright, Marta Kristen and Mark Goddard. Sadly
though, the innocent silliness that made the "Lost In Space" series a
classic guilty pleasure is missing in action here. Maybe the carrot monster
wasn't such a lame idea after all.</P>
