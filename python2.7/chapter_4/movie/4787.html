<P>     Asian superstar Jackie Chan is just a-kickin' and a-grinnin' 
through this cheery, cheesy martial-arts comedy about a lone Nice 
Guy (Chan) who must defend his friends against a rude biker gang.  
Add a slinky love interest, some stolen diamonds, and a runaway 
hovercraft (!), and you've got a recipe for some seriously hokey 
fun.  (And I mean *hokey*:  this Bronx is flanked by mountains and 
sports the occasional palm tree!)</P>
<P>     RUMBLE IN THE BRONX is Chan's second attempt to break into the 
American film market and he might just make it this time.  Despite 
the erratic pacing and some hilariously bad dubbing, RUMBLE is so 
relentlessly good-natured that you can do little more than groan 
and laugh.  Also adding to the amusement factor is the foreknow-
ledge that Chan does all of his own stunts, and only after director 
Stanley Tong attempts each one, himself!  (Check the blooper reel, 
at the end, for a run-down of who broke what during filming.)</P>
<P>     Given the overall slap-happy construction, snooty action fans 
may scoff at this stuff.  Sure, directors like James Cameron and Jan 
DuBont are choreographing equally impressive physical feats, but 
not with the raw effort of Mr. Chan.  He's a one-man arsenal of 
fury and fun.  However awful the film around him may seem, he's as 
bright a movie star as the world currently knows.  Recommended. </P>
