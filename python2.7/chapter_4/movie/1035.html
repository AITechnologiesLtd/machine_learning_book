<PRE>                            DROWNING BY NUMBERS
                     Reviewed by David N. Butterworth

<P>     Following the release of his highly controversial THE COOK, THE
THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER this time last year, the Roxy Screening
Rooms in Philadelphia presented a retrospective of films by eclectic
British film director Peter Greenaway.</P>
<P>     Included in that retrospective were the Art House hit THE
DRAUGHTSMAN'S CONTRACT, the film which put Greenaway on the map in this
country, and two Philadelphia premieres -- A ZED AND TWO NOUGHTS (which
prior to that time had only seen a limited run on the Bravo cable
channel) and THE BELLY OF AN ARCHITECT.</P>
<P>     Conspicuous by its absence was Greenaway's 1988 movie, DROWNING BY
NUMBERS, a film which is only now making its much-belated Philadelphia
debut.  This city, it seems, has saved the best until last.</P>
<P>     DROWNING BY NUMBERS is another visually striking essay by Britain's
master of the cinematic put-on.  Brimming with absurdist wordplay and an
exacting eye for detail, it's a very Tall Tale of murder, mathematics,
and misdirected love.</P>
<P>     From the opening scene, you know you are not watching any ordinary
film, or dealing with any ordinary filmmaker.  A young girl, bedecked in
an outrageous, fairy godmother-like party dress, jumps rope whilst
reciting the names of the stars in the constellation.  The lighting
casts giant shadows on the building behind her, an imposing Regency
edifice fronted by pom-pom-shaped trees.  A dead bird hangs from a pole
in the foreground.   It's like something out of Lewis Carroll.</P>
<P>     Three generations of women, each named Cissie, drown their husbands
out of passionate detachment.  They are played by Joan Plowright, Juliet
Stevenson (who can currently be seen in TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY) and
Joely Richardson.   This maternal camaraderie is incisively drawn, a
refreshing change after the misogynistic flourishes of A ZED AND TWO
NOUGHTS.</P>
<P>     A willing ally to their sanctimonious crimes is a local coroner
named Madgett (Bernard Hill).  Madgett, along with his son, Smut
(newcomer Jason Edwards), is an obsessive game-player, much like
Greenaway himself.  In love with all three women, Madgett pronounces
each death an accident.</P>
<P>     But Greenaway appears to be less concerned with plot than he is
with color and composition.  The writer/director uses Madgett's
indulgent preoccupations with contests and counting as an excuse to
exercise his own exuberant imagination, layering on the details like
oils on a canvas.</P>
<P>     In fact, many of the sequences in DROWNING BY NUMBERS -- the scenes
with the apples, the white beach house against a blackening sky, the
angular symmetry of the swimming pool -- are shot with a painter's eye
for beauty, like a Constable landscape or a Ruebens' nude.</P>
<P>     The numbers 1 to 100 run throughout the film like a chronometer,
marking time.  They start out obvious enough -- pinned to trees and tin
baths, painted on buildings, cows and passers-by -- but wind up being
woven into the overall fabric.  It's a rich and colorful tapestry, a
sumptuously crafted and richly textured experience that is at once
wicked, wry and thoroughly entertaining.</P>
<P>     If DROWNING BY NUMBERS is "about" anything, then it is about the
way in which women conspire together, choking the life out of those who
have disappointed them sexually, emotionally or otherwise.</P>
<P>     A darling of the British Film Institute, Peter Greenaway made his
mark in the late '60s/early '70s with a string of independently produced
short films.  His big break came in 1982 with the BFI-funded THE
DRAUGHTSMAN'S CONTRACT, an erotically charged murder mystery set in
17th Century England.  But it wasn't until the release of last year's
THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER that American audiences were
once again treated to the cinematic excesses of this extraordinary
talent.  </P>
<P>     In keeping with the film's mood, Michael Nyman's score is somber
and atypically melancholic, not the sawing strings that have punctuated
his other collaborations with the director.  And Sacha Vierny's
photography is no less exquisite than the picture-postcard perfect views
of Rome and its surrounding countryside that graced THE BELLY OF AN
ARCHITECT.</P>
<P>     The themes which populate most of Greenaway's films -- sex, death
and decay, puns and punning, religion, numerology, entomology and
ornithology  -- are also very much in evidence here.</P>
<P>     In DROWNING BY NUMBERS, Greenaway's most accessible film to date,
these collective themes add together to form a bizarre jigsaw puzzle
with few straight edges, a delineated, looking-glass world in which
numbers count for everything and love is often left dead in the water.</P>
