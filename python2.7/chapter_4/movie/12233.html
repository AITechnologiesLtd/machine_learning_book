<PRE>REVIEW:  The Wedding Singer</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<PRE>3 stars out of 5</PRE>
<P>Following the success of popular teen flicks Billy Maddison and Happy Gilmore,
Adam Sandler now combines his singing and comical talents alongside Drew
Barrymore in The Wedding Singer.</P>
<P>Whatever standards Sandler ever earned in the past are more than met: the loud
voice that shouts nothing in particular, the face that looks like a school kid
in mischief, and the overall manner that seems like a blend of Eddie Murphy and
Mike Myers.  But hes good  very good  with his new role as a hip wedding
singer in the 1980s.</P>
<P>Sandler plays Robbie Hart, the wedding singer, who loves his job and has a
natural gift for it.  Also a love of his, is seeing newly wedded couples
together, strengthening their relationships and celebrating in the festivities
that follow.  That is, until his own wedding arrives.  When Robbie is standing
at the altar reading to get married, he is stood up by his finance Linda (Angela
Featherstone).  Now disheartened and demoralized with the marriage scene, he
quits his much-loved job after a rendition of Love Stinks.  Meanwhile, he gets
to know a new waitress named Julia (Barrymore) and begins to fall in love all
over again.  The only problem is, she is set to be married to a womanizing
sleaze bag.</P>
<P>Anyone who is capable of reading this review will be able to figure out what
eventually happens to these two forbidden lovers.  Like most romantic comedies,
the ending is cheerful and predictable  but strangely satisfying.</P>
<P>By far the most enjoying parts of The Wedding Singer are its moments of song
and comedy  it is through these fabulously entertaining scenes that we truly
feel like we have been taken back a decade.  What fills the gaps in between
these moments, however, fail to give any creativity to a film that at first
seemed to be incredibly original.  Luckily, watching Adam Sandler and Drew
Barrymore on the screen together is just enough to keep the film attractive and
easygoing.  But, surprisingly, most of the films laughs come from its
supporting cast  namely Steve Buscemi as an idiotic best man and an old
alcoholic played by Carmen Filpi.</P>
<P>Mona Mays (Clueless, Romy and Micheles High School Reunion) costume design is
eerily eighties, and brings back awkward feelings of fashions we thought wed
seen the last of.  And not only that, but the movie has also brought back an
assortment of so-so 80s music in an attempt to make the mood feel ever more out
dated.  Its a pity that they had a whole decade to select music from but
somehow managed to stuff it upthe recent Jackie Brown proved to have much
greater taste not only in the choice of music but also the influence it had on
the film.</P>
<P>OK, the films sets and costumes do look superb  but if my mother taught be
correctly  its whats inside that counts. In the case if The Wedding Singer,
listening to Adam Sandler raise his voice whenever he desperately wants us to
laugh can only be funny for the first few hundred times.  You get the feeling
that Sandlers humor has been somewhat refined than what we have been exposed to
in some of his previous films; and although the comedy occasionally comes off as
a trifle lame, its generally clean cut and well executed.</P>
<P>The Wedding Singer is no Jerry Maguire or My Best Friends Wedding  but could
you imagine Tom Cruise in a bright blue suit, singing and entertaining in Hebrew
at a Bar Mitzvah?  I think not.</P>
