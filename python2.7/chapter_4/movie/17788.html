<PRE>BY AARON MICHAELS</PRE>
<P>Amadeus is considered one of the best films of the 1980s. That decade
mostly developed Brat Pack films so there's no doubt that the epic film
would be one of the best. It made the American Film Institute's Top 100
List in the summer of 1998. Although it is not as good as some of the
films near the bottom or off the list it still deserves it's place in
cinema.</P>
<P>Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) is a struggling composer who has
worked hard to become great. Throughout his childhood he has seen a
little boy named Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The young boy performed for
royalty. When Mozart grows up he is a giddy, over excited brat (played
now by Tom Hulce) who makes obscene comments to women and curses.
Salieri can't understand why God has chosen such a delinquent to pass
his music through. Salieri swears hatred on Mozart and the God who
raised him to his status.</P>
<P>The highlight of this movie is, of course, the music. John Strauss did
much of it but also included music by Mozart, Salieri, and Giovanni
Battista Pergolesi. The music is used beautifully in the many operas
that take place during the movie. Hulce and Abraham do a great job
acting during their many
scenes of conducting and piano playing.</P>
<P>Abraham and Hulce each were awarded Academy Award recognition which they
deserve. Abraham won Best Actor over Hulce, which isn't wrong because
two people can't win. Abraham plays Salieri with all the hatred he can
without becoming an evil character. He has no heart and just wants the
life that he thinks was taken from him as a brilliant composer.</P>
<P>Hulce does an excellent job as well as the eccentric Mozart. He is able
to act extremely serious during his compositions but then chase a woman
around a house. This was easily his best role to date. He is very well
cast with his young looking face and acting talent.</P>
<P>Director Milos Forman along with Cinematographer Miroslav Ondrícek and
the Art and Production Designers have created one beautiful movie. The
opera theater scenes, along with wonderful wigs, costumes, and makeup,
are a delight to watch. The use of scope is also very good.</P>
<P>Now to why I believe Amadeus to be less a film then the AFI makes it to
be. While I do really like many things about this movie I still have
some complaints. The movie is quite long at 158 minutes. The movie isn't
boring and is much shorter than other epics but it is still quite a long
time. A couple
of scenes could have been shortened and not have hurt the movie much.</P>
<P>With my complaint aside, I can still say that Amadeus was definitely one
of the better movies to come out in the 80s. I don't know if it's one of
100 best of all time but it is a very good movie.</P>
