A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:
Roger Spottiswoode</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: 
Bruce Feirstein</PRE>
<P>Starring: 
Pierce Brosnan, Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Pryce, Teri Hatcher </P>
<P>Ingredients: 
James Bond, scuba scene, car controlled by cellular telephone</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Warped media tycoon Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) plots to start a war
between Britain and China in order to boost ratings by using a 'stealth
ship' to fire a captured British missile at the city of Beijing.
Super-agent James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) uses trick gadgets, pluck, and
charm in order to foil Carver's scheme. This time Bond teams up with top
female agent Wai Lin from China (Michelle Yeoh). The film contains
fights, chases, gadgets, and comedic moments. </P>
<P>Opinion:
It does not have a casino scene or a ski scene, but TOMORROW NEVER DIES
is nevertheless a solid, enjoyable Bond movie. It neither stands out nor
disappoints. In old Bond movies Bond sometimes teamed up with American
CIA agent Felix Leiter. TOMORROW NEVER DIES introduces a new character
in the form of Chinese agent Wai Lin. Like Leiter's character, Wai Lin
would be a sure bet for a cameo in a later Bond movie.</P>
<P>Stars:
Michelle Yeoh was born a Leo in the Western zodiac in the year of the
Tiger on the Asian astrology calendar. I dont believe in horoscopes.
But at an airport I once browsed an astrology book with a section on Leo
Tigers (LTs). </P>
<P>"Leo Tigers prefer enough solitude to grow at their own pace. LTs are
unbelievably courageous when facing adversity. The LT is also classy,
and has an excellent sense of refinement, but she sees herself as an
adventurer, and prefers freedom of movement rather than flashy status
symbols. This person loves family and friends with a fierce loyalty. She
delights in siblings, nephews, nieces and extended family - -  but she
must have her personal freedom to come and go as she pleases. Sometimes
annoyance at injustice drives her to take up one or two causes. In love
life, the LT has an unfortunate mental block against committing to any
partner who is less powerful than she." </P>
<P>In real life, Michelle Yeoh is Asia's top female star. Like Jackie Chan,
she does her own stunts. She was born in Malaysia - - a country of many
languages - - and her primary language (the language she speaks in her
sleep) is English. She was taught Malay in school, and learned Cantonese
from bilingual parents. As an athlete Michelle represented Malaysia
internationally. She enjoyed squash, diving, swimming, and rugby. She
studied ballet at the Royal Academy of Dance in London, but switched to
drama after a spinal injury. In 1983 she won the Miss Malaysia pageant -
- without really intending to, since a family member had entered her in
the contest without her knowledge. Notoriety from the contest led
eventually to a movie career as an action heroine. Michelle has survived
a divorce with Asian retail tycoon Dickson Poon; a nearly fatal stunt
accident falling from a freeway overpass which put her in the hospital
for three months, and; a retirement from the movies. Her comeback from
retirement, SUPERCOP (1992) became the top grossing film in Asia that
year. It is not clear what Michelles martial arts style is, but it may
be a theatrical version of wing chun. Of her character Wai Lin in
TOMORROW NEVER DIES, Michelle says, "Wai Lin is the first Bond Girl who
is on a par with Bond, someone who can match up with him mentally and
physically." My own opinion is that casting Michelle Yeoh as agent Wai
Lin was an excellent choice.</P>
