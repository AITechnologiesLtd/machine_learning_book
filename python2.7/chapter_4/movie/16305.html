<P>Some people can pinpoint an exact moment that changed their lives
forever.  For Homer Hickman, it was watching the Russian rocket Sputnik
race across the sky on a starry night in his small West Virginia mining
town.  Homer's life was never quite the same.</P>
<P>Like the other kids in Coalwood, Homer's future was pretty much mapped
out for him before he was even born - graduate high school, work in the
mines, get black lung and die before he hits 50.  And because his father
(Chris Cooper, Lone Star) ran the mines, Homer's inescapable fate seemed
even more likely than most.  That's why his friends and family were so
surprised when Homer pursued his new rocketry hobby with such a fervent
intensity.</P>
<P>With the singular goal of winning the National Science Fair (and the
college scholarship attendant thereto), Homer spends all of his free
time trying to launch a rocket high and straight into the sky.  His
father ignores him, his jock brother laughs, and his mother can only
warn, `Don't blow yourself up,' in A Christmas Story fashion.</P>
<P>Well, he almost does blow himself up on his first attempt, so Homer
drafts the school nerd, Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen), to help with the
chemistry end of things.  The next launch was a bit more successful,
with the rocket becoming airborne, but also dangerously zipping through
a crowd of workers at the mine.</P>
<P>Having been banished from further rocket experiments on company land –
which pretty much made up the entire town of Coalwood – Homer and his
friends hike eight miles to the outskirts of town to test their latest
projectiles.  Using money raised by selling parts of an unused railroad
track, they build a launch pad and an observation shack to safely view
the dangerous blasts and, with some help from the mine metal shop
workers and their spunky teacher (Laura Dern), they begin to make real
progress.  And as their rockets grow in both size and intellect, so do
their methods of detonation and the size of the crowds that initially
gather to mock, but end up walking away slack-jawed and dumbfounded.</P>
<P>The boys are adorable and charismatic in a Teen Beat sort of way and,
for all I know, could actually be members of the pop faves N-Sync. Homer
(Jake Gyllenhaal) is more than believable as an everyday kid fighting
the usual battles of the average teenager, but also sensibly mixes in
the fear elicited by the mine's constant presence, a weight that is
always hanging just above his head, ready to crush all of his hopes and
dreams.  Chris Cooper capably handles the role of the crusty, distant
dad while Laura Dern's `follow your dreams' schoolteacher is just a
throwaway role.</P>
<P>Director Joe Johnston's (Jumanji) use of the mine as a parallel of Hell
is very effective in this heartwarming true tale of this small-town boy
that eventually became a NASA employee.  The script is well-paced and
hits its only stumbling block when it throws in a mine union strike that
has little to do with the overall plot.  The closing credits include
actual footage of the young boys and their later launch attempts, which
helps to drive home the power of this story.  But I couldn't help
thinking, `What if it was cloudy that night when Sputnik sped by?'</P>
