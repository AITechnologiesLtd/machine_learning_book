<P>In the opening scene of Playing By Heart (**), one character tells the
story of a musician friend that once profoundly said, `Talking about
love is like dancing about architecture.'  The next two hours, which are
totally devoted to talking about love, are more like having an Acme safe
repeatedly dropped on your head.</P>
<P>Like a Robert Altman film, Heart's story is compromised of several
vignettes about seemingly unrelated people that all end up being
connected in some way as the picture ends.  The trouble is that
writer/director Willard Carroll is not Robert Altman.  Instead, he has
created some of the most annoying characters this side of Hurlyburly.
Everyone is a whiny, shallow mope, which, despite the fantastic cast,
makes it hard to sympathize with even one of them.</P>
<P>Here's a quick breakdown of the losers:</P>
<P>Paul (Sean Connery) – an annoying old codger with a brain tumor who is
about to celebrate his 40th wedding anniversary to…</P>
<P>Hannah (Gena Rowlands) – Paul's annoying wife who still can't shake the
idea that her husband had an affair 25 years ago.</P>
<P>Gracie (Madeline Stowe) – an annoying hussy that cheats on her husband
with…</P>
<P>Roger (Anthony Edwards) – an annoying guy who feels guilty about
cheating on his wife.</P>
<P>Trent (Jon Stewart) – an annoying but successful architect that falls
for…</P>
<P>Meredith (Gillian Anderson) – an annoying divorcee who lost her husband
to another man.</P>
<P>Keenan (Ryan Phillippe) – an annoying blue-headed shy club-hopper that
finds himself inexplicably pursued by…</P>
<P>Joan (Angelina Jolie) – an annoying aspiring actress that can't seem to
shut up.</P>
<P>Hugh (Dennis Quaid) – an annoying drunk that tries to seduce Patricia
Clarkson, Nastassja Kinski and a drag queen with three different lies.</P>
<P>Mildred (Ellen Burstyn) – an annoying mother that has just traveled
across the country to see her son…</P>
<P>Mark (Jay Mohr) – an annoying bedridden guy that is dying of AIDS.</P>
<P>Okay, they aren't all that annoying, but I'm not too far off.  Jolie is
actually very good as the peppy Joan (she was honored by the National
Society of Film Critics for this role) and Phillippe shows some actual
depth and range after his summer debacle 54 (which I thought may have
been his I.Q. before seeing him in this film).</P>
<P>I don't know if this applies to everyone, but I found myself able to
relate only to characters that were close to my age (somewhere between
Keenan/Joan and Trent/Meredith, but closer to the former than the
latter).  But once the focus shifted to the older folks, my focus
shifted to the insides of my eyelids.</P>
