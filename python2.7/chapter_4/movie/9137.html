<PRE>                                   The Edge</PRE>
<P>(1997, one of two films with this title)</P>
<P>  Seen on 20 September 1997 at the Cineplex Baronet Coronet for $8.75 as a
  Sneak Preview.</P>
<P>   Thriller. Suvival. Wilderness. Bear. Those are the terms the Internet
   Movie Database uses to categorize The Edge, and boy, never were they
   more accurate. Initially, the commercials for this movie made it look
   like another dopey "two rivals fight in the deep woods, plus a
   grizzly" film. The lure of two-for-the-price-of-one brought me in, and
   I am glad I knew next to nothing before entering the theatre.</P>
<P>   In a nutshell, older gazillionaire Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins) and
   his much younger model wife (Elle Macpherson) come to the world's
   largest log cabin for a photoshoot, along with the photographer (Bob,
   played by Alec Baldwin), his assistant Stephen (Harold Perrineau Jr.),
   and various other personnel. Charles has a voracious appetite for
   knowledge and always has his nose in an informative book, but he also
   notices that his wife and Bob are way too chummy.</P>
<P>   Charles, Bob, and Stephen take on an impromptu adventure to find a
   lone hunter to be a model turns deadly as their small pontoon plane
   goes down (stunning homage to Hitchcock, that scene). The pilot dies;
   the other three have to figure out how they are going to get back to
   the lodge. Oh, and a gigantic bear (Bart the Bear) is after them. All
   this might sound like a vague improvement on The River Wild, but it
   far exceeds that sort of parallel thanks to riveting direction by
   relative nobody Lee Tamahori and an intelligent screenplay by David
   Mamet.</P>
<P>   What the commercials do not show is the presence of Stephen; it only
   shows Bob and Charles as rivals. Watching the billionaire bookworm
   take charge of their survival is interesting. If it were me, I'd be
   dead in about a half hour. Charles forces the men to participate in
   their own survival.</P>
<P>   The only intelligent line in Copland (the next movie I saw) is that
   despite technological and other advances, the human thought process is
   still rather primitive. Watching Hopkins play a man who has every
   reason to be less than civilized while poised to fight his rival in
   circumstances that would allow less than refined behavior is
   fascinating. But it is not a big intellectual exercise; The Edge
   provides one of the best edge-of-your-seat movies I have seen in
   years. Tamahori comes very close to being the next potential
   Hitchcock, giving the sort of thrills humanity gave up when they gave
   up hunting in favor of agriculture.</P>
<P>   The Edge takes none of the turns you might expect. The breathtaking
   woods of Alberta are not forced to carry the film. Anthony Hopkins
   once again proves why he is one of the best actors of our day, adding
   another wonderful performance to a pantheon of memorable characters.
   Alec Baldwin surprises also, and the hitherto unknown (to me) Harold
   Perrineau Jr. was equally good. Elle Macpherson serves her purpose, if
   you were wondering.</P>
