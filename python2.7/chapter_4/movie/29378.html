<P>Synopsis: Leonard Shelby (Pearce) is a former insurance investigator on 
the trail of the man who killed his wife. Leonard has only a few clues to 
the murderer's identity; to make matters worse, he suffers from a 
condition which inhibits the creation of short-term memories, meaning that 
Leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier. Because 
of this, Leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself. 
"Memento" traces the investigation back in time from its apparent 
culmination.</P>
<P>Review: "Memento" is the sort of movie I wish I'd written; I can think of 
no higher praise than that. I am envious that Nolan has concocted such a 
brilliant, involved, original movie as this. An instant film noir classic, 
"Memento" is virtually flawless. The script is unlike any I have ever seen 
-- a notable achievement in these days of recycled Hollywood homogeneity. 
Although the idea of starting at the "conclusion" of the plotline and then 
moving backward in time to the "start" is not entirely new, never before 
have I witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence. "Memento" is 
endlessly exciting and inventive, a rare story which keeps the viewers 
guessing during the film itself, and mulling over its connotations long 
after leaving the theatre. And it is not merely an exercise in 
cerebrality; there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to 
keep the proceedings lively. Nolan's direction is equally effective, never 
losing its crispness and clarity despite "Memento"'s challenging gimmick. 
And to top everything off, all the performances rise to the occasion. 
Pierce is terrific as the troubled Leonard; Moss shows great range as 
enigmatic Natalie; and Pantoliano's Teddy achieves a splendidly affable 
yet sinister quality. "Memento" may be the year's best screenplay, and is 
certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001.</P>
