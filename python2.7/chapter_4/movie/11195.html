<PRE>                              SCREAM 2 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                   2 :-) :-) for multiple stab wounds</PRE>
<P>Cast: Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Liev
Schreiber, Jada Pinkett, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laurie Metcalf, Omar
Epps, Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olyphant Director: Wes Craven Screenplay:
Kevin Williamson</P>
<P>If something works well for a movie, don't change it. Keep what worked
in SCREAM and apply it to SCREAM 2.</P>
<P>Principle 1: Keep the blood bath going with multiple stab wounds, and in
the meantime kill as many people as you can.</P>
<P>Victim 1: Is pissing peacefully in toilet, before the moment of relief
is interrupted with a knife through the head. Victim 2: Watching a
movie, stab, scream, stab, scream, stab, scream. Victim 3: Blonde Girl
from I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER TV
series, redoes her famous run through the house chased by serial killer
number. Victim 5: The guy who talks too much gets it in the Van. Victim
6: Boyfriend gets crucified. Victim 7: Gets mulched by the good old but
handy axe. Victims 8 and 9: Don't forget the cops. Victims 10: Get rid
of the best friend.</P>
<PRE>Life is a lonely place in SCREAM 2.</PRE>
<P>Principle 2: Keep them guessing right to the very end. There are two
killers in the original SCREAM. This movie doesn't stray from the
original format and you may even guess who the killer(s) are, but the
motive although cliché, is a mystery in itself.</P>
<P>As with the first movie, I was simultaneously shocked and amused, at how
quickly the cast was decimated in number by the end of the movie. Those
who remain standing are the major leads but even they must go through
near death experiences. Sadly, Neve Campbell doesn't cop the axe like I
wanted her to, and disappointingly so, because she's the only one I
wanted out of the movie. Courtney Cox reprises her role as the bitchy
reporter, but despite her defensive female front, is still very
likeable. I wept for my favourite character Dewey (David Arquette),
handicapped after the original SCREAM, one can only imagine the worse
scenario after this movie - perhaps paraplegic or quadriplegic. On the
bright side, SCREAM 3 may be a bit of a REAR WINDOW, which would be
something to look forward two.  This is an overall satisfactory sequel
to the original.</P>
