<P>     Bill (Michael Douglas) is having a bad morning.  He's stuck in his
car in a traffic jam, his air conditioner isn't putting out any cold
air, his windows won't work, and there's a fly buzzing around his head.
All this is enough to make him snap.  Just like that, he gets out of
his car, leaving it behind in the middle of the road, and sets off for
home on foot.  His cross-town trek quickly turns violent when he feels
his rights as a consumer and citizen are violated, and a number of
potentially-lethal weapons fall into his hands.  Meanwhile, police
officer Martin Prendergast (Robert Duvall) is going through a
life-crisis of his own.  How he deals with it not only puts him squarely
on the side of the law, but on a collision course with Bill.</P>
<P>     Some of the appeal of FALLING DOWN is doubtless the idea that an
average, middle-aged, white collar man can be empowered against the
numerous annoyances that the world throws at him.  Hopefully there
aren't many people out there who will resort to the lengths that Bill
goes to, but it gives a measure of vicarious enjoyment to watch him
dole out punishment to the people that insult, snub, and otherwise
aggravate him.  These are things that, at one time or another, we've
longed to say and do (a whole psychological treatise could be written
on this subject).  Until things get too violent, that is ....  While
it's easy to sympathize with punching a loud-mouthed, profane man in
the mouth, shooting someone to death, no matter how despicable they
might be, is another matter.</P>
<P>     The premise and early execution of FALLING DOWN are tremendous.
The idea is original and the filming of the scene where Bill snaps is
imaginative and evocative.  We can feel the heat, the tension, and the
building rage.  When he gets out of the car, it's as much a relief to us
as it is to him.  The movie's pacing, especially during the first half,
is on-target.</P>
<P>     Also, some of the early scenes with Bill are cathartic, but as the
violence of his attacks builds and the "righteousness" of his purpose
becomes fuzzy, the audience's sympathy for him erodes--even though he
never directly harms anyone who could be described as "good" or
"innocent."  Another thing that dissociates us from the character is
that we learn that he isn't as normal as we first thought.  Bill has
some deep problems that make it apparent that his snapping isn't a
spur-of-the-moment thing.  While we never lose our emotional attachment
to Bill, it isn't the same toward the end as in the beginning.</P>
<P>     As a counterpoint to Bill, we're given Robert Duvall's Prendergast,
who is in many ways a similar character.  He too feels the weight of
life pressing down on him and yearns to let out a shout.  But his
rebellion takes a more normal, natural course.  We understand
Prendergast more than we feel for him, but that's the nature of his
personality.  Bill has all the emotional volatility; Prendergast has
stability and sanity.</P>
<P>     As a thriller, FALLING DOWN works most of the time because of the
depth of its characters.  The plot is not especially remarkable.  In
fact, on some occasions, it comes dangerously close to a descent into
action/thriller cliches and formulas.  Fortunately, the performances of
Duvall and Douglas give this film greater strength than most movies of
the genre.</P>
<P>     The gallows humor also functions as a device to keep FALLING DOWN
rolling along.  The movie has such a slick sense of humor that it could
almost be considered a black comedy.  I think such a label would be a
misnomer, however, because of the film's breadth.  As FALLING DOWN
unfolds, numerous social statements are made.  Some are overt (such as
an incident with the neo-Nazi), but others are more subtle.  One of the
most disturbing scenes occurs when a young child teaches Bill how to use
a grenade launcher, claiming to have learned the lesson from television.
FALLING DOWN is replete with moments such as this, many of which are
uncomfortable because they strike a nerve.</P>
<P>     Indeed, the depth of issues dealt with by FALLING DOWN elevates it
above the normal shoot-'em-up film.  In many cases, the violence isn't
just for the sake of violence (although I'm sure the studio made no
attempt to dilute it).  There's more to this film than initially meets
the eye.  Sure, the viewer who wants to see a tightly-paced thriller
with a lot of gun-play and emotionally-satisfying moments won't be
disappointed, but the discerning, thinking movie-goer will find more
here than simple escapism.  FALLING DOWN has the power to disturb, and
if it takes a few wrong turns along the way, it should still be
applauded for the things it does--and tries to do--right.</P>
