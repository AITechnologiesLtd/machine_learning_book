<PRE>                                    BOGUS
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Because of the numerous possibilities of headlines and comments of a
negative nature, if I were making a film called "Bogus", Id go out of
my way to make sure that the film was one of quality. As usual, the
producer and director didnt beat a path to my door asking for advice.
Too bad.</P>
<P>Little boy Albert (Haley Joel Osment)'s Las Vegas chorus girl mother
dies in a traffic accident and he is sent to live with her lifeless
adoptive sister Harriet (Whoopi Goldberg). Albert is frightened and
doesnt want to go, but finds an imaginary friend, Bogus (Gerard
Depardieu) to help him on his way.</P>
<P>The subject of the imaginary friends of children and adults is an
intriguing one, worthy of imaginative exploration. But dont look for it
here amid the dull pap.  Often in films with kids, the problem is with
the overly-cute children. At least you dont have to worry about that
here. Osment has his wide-eyed look down fairly well, but most of the
time hes just there.</P>
<P>Goldberg isnt much better. Her film career has been dramatically uneven
running from the listless comedies to fine performances in "Boys On The
Side", "The Color Purple" and others.  Her appearance here is flat, as
if she had realized what a drab vehicle she was in and attempted to
match it.</P>
<P>The only semi-bright spot is Depardieu. His larger than life man-child
is occasionally delightful and comical. Dressed in an enormous floppy
trench coat that frequently seems to be going in a different direction
than he is, the French actor has a flair for physical humor.
Unfortunately he can't pull the movie out of itself.</P>
<P>Theres a powerful cinematic short-cut that is becoming over-used and
trite. During this film, we see scenes from "Harvey" on the television.
What this segment of Jimmy Stewart talking to his imaginary six foot
rabbit friend is supposed to do is bring us to an "Oh yeah, 'Harvey'!
That was a great film and was about the same subject as this one is so I
should transfer my warm feelings about 'Harvey' to this movie." state of
being. I first remember seeing this used effectively in "Close
Encounters", but here it seems like a sleazy trick.</P>
<P>Even worse than attending a film that you suspect might be mediocre is
seeing one that, based on the cast and story, you expect a magical time
and having it turn out to be a numbing experience. Stay home and rent
"Harvey"; youll have a much better time.</P>
<P>As alluded to in the first paragraph, "Bogus" is, indeed.</P>
