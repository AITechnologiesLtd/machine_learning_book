<P>   One of the unfortunate contradictions of our species is that
none of us likes to feel alone, and yet given our cynical age
we often put roadblocks in the way of intimate relationships. 
This phenomenon can be milked for humorous effect as well
as tragic, as Jeremy Podeswa does so well in his finely-
crafted Canadian film "The Five Senses."  Filmed in and
about Toronto, this production has appropriately
garnered awards and accolades at film festivals in Cannes
and Toronto, and deals with the role of taste, smell, sight,
hearing and touch in the lives of a group of characters whose
narratives are skillfully interwoven.  In some cases, people
with a special acuity use their senses to establish intimate
contact; in others, folks who are at a loss in particular
perceptions learn to initiate a modicum of happiness. 
Employing the plaited narrative structure of Robert Altman
and the texture of Atom Egoyan, Jeremy Podeswa has us
leaving the theater with a smile as his characters make 
peace with what they have lost, in some instances actually
profiting from their misfortunes.</P>
<P>   Podeswa introduces his personalities one by one making
clear to us what is at stake for each of them.  Ruth (Gabrielle
Rose) is a massage therapist not unlike Mitchell Stephens in
Atom Egoyan's "The Sweet Hereafter," having ironically lost
her ability to touch her daughter emotionally.  Robert (Daniel
MacIvor) cleans houses professionally, has a superior sense
of smell, and believes that by smelling the men and women
with whom he associates romantically he can tell which one
would be the ideal lover.  Richard (Philippe Volter), a Belgian-
born ophthalmologist living in Toronto, is slowly losing his
hearing and seeks to make a mental archive of sounds
before he goes completely deaf.  The sixteen-year-old Rachel
(Nadia Litz) has dropped out of high school because she
could not fit in and is alienated from her mother, Ruth.  She
uses her sight to become a voyeur, to look upon her
surroundings without getting involved.  Rona (Mary-Louise
Parker) bakes wonderful-looking cakes which taste utterly
bland.</P>
<P>   Podeswa milks the humor principally in his portrait of
Rona, an adorable baker approaching middle age who has
become involved with a chef, Roberto (Marco Leonardi)
during a vacation in Italy.  Though Roberto has given up his
job and traveled to Toronto to re-unite with Rona, Rona is too
cynical to believe the sincere and emotional Italian wants her
for anything short of Canadian citizenship.  At the same time,
Rona continues to be friendly with a previous lover, the
bisexual cleaner Robert--who may wonder why he and Rona
ever broke up but knows from his prescient sense of smell
that somehow a genuine love was missing.</P>
<P>   What eventually brings these disparate persons together is
the temporary disappearance of a child who is being watched
by young Rachel but who vanishes during the moments that
Rachel follows a young couple into a remote section of the
park to observe their lovemaking.  Unable to connect with her
schoolmates, her mom, or anyone at all, she lives vicariously
through her sight and will later grasp her true self through the
patient and tender ministrations of a boy her own age.</P>
<P>   "The Five Senses" was screened for critics in New York on
the same evening as was "Mission to Mars."  One cannot
help observing that the two pictures are about as disparate
from each other as movies can be.  "Mission to Mars" deals
with our fascination with outer space, with exploring the great
beyond.  "The Five Senses" turns inward, exploring Oscar
Wilde's epigram, "Nothing can cure the soul but the senses,
just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul."  While
Podeswa is not as assured a director as his countryman,
Atom Egoyan (he tends at times to dwell on particular scenes
when a fast cut would have sharpened the tension), he helps
prove that when it comes to making movies, the Canadians
seem able to do no wrong.  This is a film for those who
realize that the most important unexplored territory lies not on
the Red Planet but in a place even more intimate than our
own backyards.</P>
