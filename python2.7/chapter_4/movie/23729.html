<P>"The Cider House Rules", rich in texture and Dickensian in themes, is such a=
=20
skilful dance of a film that it hops over cinema's trickiest hurdles and we=20
hardly even notice. It makes sentimentality enjoyable, adapts a novel withou=
t=20
condensing it into a patronising Hollywood formula and avoids silly=20
speechmaking when commenting on the complex issue of abortion.</P>
<P>The source material is a 1985 best seller by John Irving, which ran eight=20
hundred pages and covered forty years in the life of an orphan named Homer=20
Wells. In adapting his book to the screen, Irving wrote a multitude of scrip=
t=20
drafts and took them to several directors; it's taken so long he's written a=
=20
book on the project itself. Miraculous, then, that the movie has been=20
realised at all, let alone so well.</P>
<P>It is set in the 1940s, and Homer (Tobey Maguire) has grown up in a Maine=20
orphanage, St. Cloud's. He was adopted twice as a baby, sent back once=20
because he didn't cry enough, and taken back on the other occasion because=20
one set of parents beat him. His father figure is the dedicated Dr. Larch=20
(Michael Caine), who is addicted to ether, and performs abortions at a time=20
when they are illegal, but is a good man nonetheless -- in taking Homer unde=
r=20
his wing, and making sure he is "of use", he has taught the boy enough about=
=20
medicine to qualify him as a skilled surgeon.</P>
<P>Homer is not convinced he wants to be a doctor, though, and has reservations=
=20
about the moral validity of abortion. He would like to see the outside world=
,=20
and gets his chance when the cute young couple of Wally (Paul Rudd) and Cand=
y=20
(Charlize Theron) come to St. Cloud's to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy.=20
Wally's family has an orchard near the ocean, and Homer is offered a job=20
there.</P>
<P>Wally gets called up to serve in World War Two, but since Homer has a heart=20
condition, he remains at his new home, picking apples. He and Candy begin a=20
love affair, which is significant because it's a taste of normal life, and=20
once he's sampled the joys of the real world, Homer must face up to its=20
grimmer realities too. When a seemingly upright orchard worker impregnates=20
his teenage daughter, Homer feels compelled to intervene, as the question of=
=20
abortion suddenly seems much less clear-cut. And so does his decision to=20
leave St. Cloud's -- perhaps Larch was right all along, and Homer is his=20
natural successor.</P>
<P>I am simplifying the story to a damaging degree; it does make good sense,=20
even though Irving had to compress the events of the novel into a two-year=20
period. The film is tighter and more focused for it; the abortion thread is=20
woven in with great skill, whereas in the book it seemed a tad tacked-on. An=
d=20
the messages are clearer -- rules may be for the good of humanity, but part=20
of being truly human is knowing when to break them; and people belong where=20
they can do the most good.</P>
<P>Both works feature mature character depictions, like that of the incestuous=20
father, Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo). He doesn't realise he's done anything=20
damaging, and that's the kind of self-delusion which similar people go=20
through in real life. Homer, the hero of the piece, doesn't do any=20
grandstanding; Tobey Maguire's performance is engaging because of boyish=20
innocence and quiet dignity. The character was raised in an orphanage,=20
remember, and has learnt to reveal in his eyes alone what he feels about his=
=20
wonderful and terrible discoveries.</P>
<P>The movie is more obviously sincere than the novel, which, although generall=
y=20
absorbing, had moments of messy wording that left me unsure of their tone.=20
The director, Lasse Hallstr=F6m, and his cinematographer, Oliver Stapleton,=20
have crafted an intimate New England look reminiscent of the third act in=20
"The Shawshank Redemption", full of naturally beautiful browns and greens. W=
e=20
can't help but be moved by all the cute little orphans, either, and it's nic=
e=20
to see Jane Alexander return to the screen, in the role of one of Larch's=20
nurses.</P>
<P>This is not quite a perfect movie. It doesn't emphasise any particular plot=20
point as being the driving force behind the narrative, the romance is=20
underdeveloped and Homer's final farewell to is too brief. But generally it=20
is an effective tearjerker, with old-fashioned pacing, sweet violin music an=
d=20
an admirable social conscience. Please, sir... I want some more.</P>
