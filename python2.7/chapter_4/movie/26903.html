<P>Actually, I made a mistake in something I wrote above: this film's genre
shouldn't include the word "romantic" in it at all.  Of course, the
mistake was really not mine; blame it on reportedly real-life lovebirds,
Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow, who did everything they could to
convince the audience that they're Not Really Seeing Each Other.  Too
bad that convincing shows *onscreen*.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
The Moral Of The Story?  Lies Are Bad.  Ask Buddy (Ben Affleck) and Abby
(Gwyneth Paltrow), two needy people who need to work on keeping their
stories straight.</P>
<P>When his plane got delayed in Chicago, advertising agent Buddy Amaral
("amoral", get it?) hooked up with two strangers, Greg Genello (Tony
Goldwyn) and Mimi (Natasha Henstridge) to pass the time away.  Wanting
to Get To Know Mimi Better, Buddy gave Greg his ticket voucher - a clear
breach of federal regulations, as Flight Attendant Janice Guererro
(Jennifer Grey) finds out (she helped Buddy's scheme to get Greg home to
his wife and kids).  Fed regs would be the least of Buddy's concerns,
however: after the plane - which *he* was supposed to be on - crashes
with Greg aboard, Buddy has Deep Guilt about what happened.  And,
keeping with the Theme, Buddy becomes an ugly drunk, much to the dismay
of his boss/business partner Jim (Joe Morgan).  Still not feeling
guilt-free, Buddy seeks out Greg's wife Abby (Gwyneth Paltrow), to
somehow try to make up for what he did.  Meanwhile, The Widow Abby has
Issues of her own to deal with: namely, her unforgiving older son Scott
(Alex D. Linz), her still-trusting youngest son Joey, her Nosy But
Well-Meaning friend Donna (Caroline Aaron), and a job for which Abby
is not very qualified, but has to do to make ends meet.</P>
<P>Buddy lied to Abby about how he came to find her. Abby lied to Buddy
about how she lost her husband. I'd say "and, of course, Wackiness
Ensues", but that'd be going against the moral of the story, I reckon.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
I swear, at times, watching BOUNCE go through its by-the-numbers paces
was like watching paint dry.  I'm not exaggerating.  Seriously; it's in
my review notes: "Here comes the Sad Guitar Music...now is the time
Buddy feels Remorse..."; and after Buddy and Abby met: "Here comes the
Sad Guitar Music again...now is the time for the Kiss..."</P>
<P>And so forth.  BOUNCE was an exercise in tedium, like watching a
read-through for a play that you just *know* is gonna bomb.  The movie -
and its characters - took itself *way* too seriously, much to its
deficit.  Me, I couldn't stop snickering.</P>
<P>What's funniest about BOUNCE, is that it's not even "So Bad It's
Good"-worthy; this one was just...there.  I'd dearly love to pick fun at
the high-fallutin' "Academy Award Winner Ben Affleck...Academy Award
Winner Gwyneth Paltrow" pronouncements, but the blame only partially
lies with those two.  More shameful was the TV Movie Of The Week script,
which put words into its characters' mouths that I daresay did *not*
belong there.  C'mon, guys; do people *really* talk like that?  I mean,
honest-to-goodness conversations between men and women just don't sound
*anything* like the overly-sentimental speechifying from Affleck, or the
- whateverthell it was that Paltrow failed to put across.  Even more
than Affleck (who at least *tried* to show some emotion, genuine or no),
Paltrow's monotone droning made me reach for a non-existent volume
control button.</P>
<P>The shame of it all was that Tony Goldwyn - one of those great actors
that you recognize immediately, but never remember the name - was offed
so soon.  He's about the only one of the bunch that seemed to believe in
what he was doing.  And though Gay Friend Seth (Johnny Galecki) was 
animated enough, the whole feel of the movie was flat, as if the 
actors were all only doing what they were doing because some lame 
director was yelling out lame
instructions at them.  There was no sense of discovery, of natural
progression from here to there; blink, and suddenly Things Changed, for
reasons that seemed murky, character development-wise.  In the end, that
was just it: there *was* no real development; just actors, Acting.
Fourth wall?  Hell, I could see the fourth ceiling, fourth floor, fourth
table, fourth chair...</P>
<P>I guess I called it right, back when I first saw previews for
Bounce, when I predicted it would be "RANDOM HEARTS-lite,
with the mindlessness of FINAL DESTINATION thrown in for bad measure".</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
At this point in his career, Joe Morton seems to be the kind of "go-to"
guy that Hollywood loves to use in situations that call for a solid, but
"safe", Black actor.  This is no slight on his part - he plays the kinds
of Everyman roles that are the earmark of a good character actor - but
it makes me wonder whether he's tapping his full potential yet.  No, I
don't need to see Yet Another 'Banger (plus, Morton's long-in-the-tooth
for that), and no, I don't want to pigeonhole Morton, or *any* Black
actor, for that fact, into "Black Roles".  I just wish he would play
something more than "safe", y'know?</P>
<P>But please, Mr. Morton, not another BLUES BROTHERS 2000, okay?</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
There's little doubt in my mind that "THE GRINCH" will bounce BOUNCE
right out of America's theaters.  That's too bad, too; with "Grinch" not
being strong enough to keep most adults' attention, we *need* an
intelligent, thought- or emotion-provoking, romantic tale to escape to
during this holiday season.  Sorry; BOUNCE just ain't it.</P>
<P>BOUNCE (rating: yellowlight):
Man, Affleck and Paltrow have *no* chemistry together on-screen.  Good
thing they're Not Really Seeing Each Other, eh?</P>
