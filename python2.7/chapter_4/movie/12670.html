<P>Perhaps somebody way out in Patagonia is seeing TITANIC for the first time
today, but for the rest us it is a memory threatening to dissolve in the
mist of passing, prematurely distant, weeks.</P>
<P>I remember TITANIC as a sleek and glossy film which in a way is just as
phony as the society beetles that infested the doomed ocean liner on its
maiden and only voyage. That is not to say that it is not a triumph of
technique and virtuosity, polished to a high sheen and  resplendent from
start to finish. The seeming dichotomy brings home the realization that a
movie can be devoid of any trace of imagination and all suspicion of
originality and still be a tour de force. TITANIC represents a triumph of
the stereotype; it is the epitome of cliché elevated to dogmatic
proportions. (For another example of unadulterated cliche risen to the level
of virtue one is reminded of Kramer Versus Kramer). And yet, despite its
phoniness and brainlessness, it is still a damn good movie because it
entertains pleasantly and is beautiful to watch. That one of the most horrid
maritime disasters of all time can be transformed into a pleasantly
entertaining film which is more beautiful than disturbing is an interesting
commentary on the virtuosity of the Hollywood alchemists.</P>
<P>But I overstate my case. The juxtaposition of the contemporary with the
historical was indeed a fine creative touch (albeit not astoundingly
original); but standing by its lonesome outside of the story, it is
insufficient to save the rest of the film from the rap of wall to wall
cliches and lack of imagination. Beyond that, I searched my recollection for
flashes of originality and came up with nothing more than the whistle scene.
Even the touted device of spiriting out an old survivor to tell the story of
a long-ago disaster is hardly an immaculate conceptus.</P>
<P>Still TITANIC succeeds splendidly as a fairy tale. It is De Caprio's second
crack at the Romeo and Juliet thing, and this time he gets it right. I can
understand why he boycotted the Academy Awards; he was robbed. It is not
often that an actor can flesh out a cardboard character and make it vibrant
and compelling. Leo unlocked the usually unrealized power of cliches; which
is based on the fact that nothing which is not profoundly human can ever
become a cliché. It may be that TITANIC was unsinkable, but without Leo it
would not have floated as majestic; it would have been just another well
made superproduction. Kate was nominated and she was a fine Juliet, but it
was Leo, not Kate, who stirred the juices of TITANIC and gave a heart to the
tin man. His failure to get even a nomination is a travesty. How often does
one get to see a flawless piece of work?</P>
<P>James Cameron deserves full credit for steering TITANIC past a plethora of
icebergs, some of his own making; but in proclaiming himself King of the
World he went clearly overboard. I also fail to understand the wisdom or
merit of carrying the authenticity concept beyond the simulation of
splendor, which is all that the camera can see. The camera doesn't care if
it's real mahogany; it just wants it to look like mahogany. Cameron could
have saved a bundle by simply growing up. After all, his crown and scepter
ARE phony.</P>
<P>TITANIC is not an important film the way GONE WITH THE WIND and GHANDI are.
It is important only as a big, well made film; it is another triumph of
style over substance. Not that there is anything wrong with that. If one can
not be both skillful and original, mere skill can still deliver a worthy
product.</P>
<PRE>4 1/2 stars out of 5
