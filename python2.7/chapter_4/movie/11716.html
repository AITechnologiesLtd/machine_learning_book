<PRE>WILD THINGS (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Wild Things falls into the "stupid but fun" group.  The plot is laughable,
the dialogue is hilarious, and all the major performers think they're in
different types of pictures.  Even the director looks like he's unable to
figure out what kind of movie this is supposed to be.</P>
<P>In the hardly sleepy town of Blue Bay resides a high school where all the
students look like magazine models.  In Blue Bay, people sleep with just
about everyone else; "promiscuity" is as common a word as "eating."  People
in this town look good and dress to promote themselves. So, what's the
problem in this town?</P>
<P>A student, Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards), claims her counselor, Sam
Lombardo (Matt Dillon), raped her.   But did he?  There is a doubt to Van
Ryan's claims until another student, Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell), comes
forward and says that Sam Lombardo too raped her.  Investigating this rape
case are two Blue Bay cops, Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) and Gloria Perez
(Daphne Rubin-Vega).</P>
<P>To tell any more of the story would spoil the movie.  Wild Things tries
hard to entertain the audience.  At most points the twists and turns in the
script work-but barely.  Wild Things is by far an example of how to make a
movie so bad that it actually looks good.</P>
<P>The twists and turns in Wild Things are mostly predictable but it is the
execution that makes them so enjoyable.  As I was watching the film, I was
trying to guess when and what would come up next.  And like James
Berardinelli, a prominent Internet film critic, I missed only one of the
twists.  However, as I said, it's the execution that makes the twist so
fun.  The script by Kem Numm and Stephen Peters has dialogue that goes so
deeply overboard it is laughable.</P>
<P>The lead performers, Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, and Denise Richards all
play their parts  tongue in cheek.  Dillon is likeable as the beat up
school counselor Lombardo.  Campbell seems to be relishing her part as the
tramp in the trailer park.  And Richards is given a handful more lines than
she had in Starship Troopers, but she is not given much more to work with.</P>
<P>In the supporting roles look for two outstanding performances; Bill Murray
as a Lombardo's sleazy lawyer and new comer Daphne Rubin-Vega as Kevin
Bacon's partner. Wild Things is full of unintentional laughs but Murray
brings some much-needed intentional comedy to Wild Things.  Rubin-Vega is a
newcomer but gives a wonderful performance.</P>
<P>For bad performers look for Robert Wagner as Kelly Van Ryan's lawyer and
Theresa Russell as Kelly Van Ryan's slutty mom.  Wagner seems to believe
that he is in a serious movie and sticks out like a sore thumb. My
favourite Wagner moment is when Wagner meets Dillon's Lombardo and says,
"You're finished in Blue Bay.  Get lost!"  I laughed and cringed at this
line.  Theresa Russell seems to be parodying herself in this film.</P>
<P>Wild Things is a largely commercially aimed film.  How do I know that?  It
is gratuitous.  But, you might ask, in what?  The answer:  it has
everything that will bring near or post-pubescent boys to the theatres:
sex and violence.  And for those of you curious, Denise Richards and
Theresa Russell get topless scenes and Kevin Bacon gets a full frontal nude
scene.</P>
<P>Should you see Wild Things?  Yes.  I'd recommend Wild Things during a
matinee showing.  This film is an unintentional comedy with a twist of
mystery and twist of thriller.  Sure, the film is trash, but it's fun
trash.  Don't pick up and leave once you see the credits!  There are some
fun credit cookies that will throw in more twists.  Don't Miss Wild Things
in the theatres.</P>
