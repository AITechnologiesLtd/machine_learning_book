Susan Granger's review of "JACK FROST" (Warner Brothers)</PRE>
<P>Just when career-obsessed, hip blues musician Jack Frost
(Michael Keaton) is about to achieve his lifelong dream of success, he
dies in a car wreck, leaving a devastated wife (Kelly Preston) and
young son (Joseph Cross). On the first anniversary of his father's
death, the lonely, still-grieving 12 year-old builds a snowman, just
like he did with his dad, and tops it with his dad's old hat, red
scarf, and gloves. Then, before he falls asleep that night, he plays
the old harmonica his dad gave him, remembering his father's promise:
"If you play this, I will always hear you, no matter where I am."
Magically, father and son are reunited in a way neither thought
possible.  Although loosely based on the children's tune "Frosty the
Snowman," credit director Troy Miller for diluting the heavily
emotional dialogue by allowing the camera to tell the story. So, with
the exception of a few digital shots, the "special effects" are
achieved through an incredible animatron from Jim Henson's Creature
Shop, a snowm an who can win snowball fights, go sledding, and
snow-boarding. Michael Keaton brings a goofy appeal, muttering "It's
bad enough that my ticket got punch but to come back like this is
embarrassing!" While not typical holiday fare, it's a contemporary
fantasy with thoughts to contemplate. For workaholic fathers, "I was
so busy trying to make my mark on the world, I didn't understand you
are my mark on the world." And for kids: "Life is full of setbacks,"
"Everybody deserves a second chance," and "As long as you hold someone
in your heart, you can never lose 'em."  (And don't confuse this "Jack
Frost" with a direct-to-video horror clunker about a vicious killer
snowman.) On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Jack Frost" is a
cool 7, a sentimental story with an icy edge.</P>
