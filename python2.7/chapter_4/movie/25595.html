<P> Forget scientific accuracy. That's not what "Space Cowboys" is all
about.</P>
<P> Its very title implies a boyish, larger-than-life fantasy. And that is
what is so darn appealing about this out-of-this-world tale; its
willingness to tap into a fountain of youth-like quality that we all can
identify with.</P>
<P> "Space Cowboys" is a good ol' boy romp with the emphasis on old. It's
about four space program veterans dismissed - back in 1958 - before the
project literally got off the ground who have `the ripe stuff' and get a
second chance to fulfill their longtime ambition - go soaring into
space.</P>
<P> The movie's main drawback is that - like its four protagonists - we
have to wait too long before liftoff.</P>
<P> Beginning with a flashback to show how the four hot shots - Frank
Corvin (Clint Eastwood), Frank `Hawk' Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones), Jerry
O'Neil (Donald Sutherland) and Tank Sullivan (James Garner) - were
dropped, the story flashes forward to contemporary times when the
services of the four are required to repair an old Russian satellite
that has a decaying orbit.
It seems the old Soviet satellite's design is one created by Corvin that
was stolen by the commies in the old days when they were our enemies.</P>
<P> Director Eastwood wastes too much time on old age jokes as the four
comrades go through their training for the space mission.</P>
<P> The film shifts into high gear when the quartet are blasted into orbit.</P>
<P> Of course, complications arise when the satellite's deep, dark secret
is revealed.
But the plot - and its inherent clichés - take a back seat to the
winning interplay between the four veteran performers. That is what
truly fuels "Space Cowboys."</P>
<P> It is a joy to watch the ease in which these wily actors work together.
They do become a team. No one tries to steal any scenes.</P>
<P> Jones with his Texas twang and Sutherland with his ‘60s laid-back
persona are so marvelous to watch and enjoy. Not that Eastwood and
Garner are any slouches. They just seem so comfortable around each
other, that you'd think they were all longtime friends, instead of hired
actors.</P>
<P> This is the reason to see "Space Cowboys." It is a film in which the
performers overshadow and blot out the shortcomings, of which there are
several. But you buy into the illusion because of their combined
charisma.</P>
<P> The premise that four 70+-year-old men could learn the complicated data
in the short time period allotted is a bit far-fetched. But who cares?</P>
<P> Just see "Space Cowboys" for a needed douse of old-fashioned
entertainment. It's charming, winsome and sentimental.</P>
