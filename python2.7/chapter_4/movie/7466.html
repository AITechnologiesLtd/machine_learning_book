<PRE>                              A CHEF IN LOVE
            (LES MILLE ET UNE RECETTES DU CUISINIER AMOUREUX)
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>As with most foreign films that are sent here to the States, the story
is simple, the pace leisurely, no guns get fired, no one is killed yet
the film holds you in its grip.  Such a one is A CHEF IN LOVE, the
Republic of Georgia's film that was one of the 5 nominees chosen for
Academy Award consideration. Georgia was once a part of the USSR.</P>
<P>In keeping with several other foreign films, (Babette's Feast, Eat
Drink Man Woman,  to name but two), we are treated to a gorgeous spread
while the story of the Chef, Pascal Ichac (Pierre Richard, who first
became a big star with THE TALL BLOND MAN WITH ONE BLACK SHOE)
unfolds.</P>
<P>In 1995, Anton (Jean-Yves Gautier), while arranging for an art
exhibition fortuitously meets a photographer, Marcelle (Micheline
Presle.)    She has with her a manuscript, unpublished, written by her
uncle, Pascal,  which she would like Anton to read.  "Is the name
familiar?"  It tells of Pascal's last adventure in a wild, exciting
life when he returned to the Republic of Georgia.    What intrigues
Anton, is that his mother, Princess Cecilia Abachidze (Nino Kirtadze)
often spoke reverently of the dashing Pascal.   The Chef had written a
book, 1001 Recipes Of A Chef In Love which Anton now recalls his mother
felt was even more important than  the Bible.</P>
<P>Thus begins the story.  As Anton reads, we are treated to flashbacks to
the 1920s of what Anton finds on the manuscript's pages, much of it
about food but also about his having met a most beautiful woman,
Princess Cecilia, much younger than he, and how they  fell in love with
each other in a shared cabin on a train headed for Tbilisi.    Back and
forth in time the flashbacks tell us of the revolution, and how the two
lovers are affected while Anton begins to grasp the significance of
what he is reading and who his real father may be.</P>
<P>Pierre Richard's performance as the Chef is a delight.</P>
<P>In French, Georgian and Russian with English subtitles.</P>
<P>Ingeniously Directed by Nana Djordjadze</P>
