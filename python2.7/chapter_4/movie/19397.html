<P>Wes Craven's career as a director is starting to get more interesting - he
seems to be finally exploring the mysteries of horror as he did in the classic
1984 film "A Nightmare On Elm Street." His subsequent films didn't match that
one's genuine power or mystery as witnessed by the horribly misguided "Wes
Craven's New Nightmare" or the jarring horror-comedy "Vampire in Brooklyn."
"Scream" is a visually impressive movie and it attempts to revise and transcend
the typical slasher flick with mixed results. At the very least, it tries.</P>
<P>"Scream" is set in a typical L.A. suburb where the local high school teenagers
worship the torpid slasher flicks of the 80's, including the Jamie Lee Curtis
screaming roles from "Halloween" to "Prom Night." They know all the formulas
and cliches by heart, and they worship them with unmitigated glee. Neve
Campbell, from TV's "Party of Five," stars as Sidney, a virginal teenager who
is receiving strange calls from a stalker; he keeps quizzing her on slasher
movies. Sidney's mother was killed by a stalker, and she is torn (pardon the
pun) by how he mentions intimate details of her. Enter Sidney's pals, which
include her anxious boyfriend, Billy (Skeet Ulrich), and her best friend (Rose
McGowan from "The Doom Generation"). I will omit the other cast members for now
because part of the fun of this thriller is that we don't know who the killer
is, it could be any of Sidney's clique of friends. </P>
<P>Strange murders start occurring at the high school and Billy is a prime
suspect. Feeling that her life is in danger, Sidney attends an all-night
slasher video party with her pals. Although not as naive as her friends, Sidney
should know better than to go to her friend's house (after all, she watches
those dumb movies, too). No medals for anyone who guesses that the killer may
be there. And if these teenagers are so clever, why do they make the same
mistakes as the cartoonish teens in those movies? </P>
<P>"Scream" is a smart, very entertaining satiric thriller in the first
three-quarters. It is only until the last quarter that the movie opts to be as
bloodily nauseating and predictably stupid as any of the slasher flicks it
pretends to mock. Instead of throwing us surprising thrills and chills, it goes
for nonstop gore and an avalanche of stabbings and pointless cruelty - blood
filling up the screen is not scary. Craven takes the easy route rather than
enthralling us in our seats with unimaginable horror as he does in roughly the
first hour and ten minutes. </P>
<P>The pleasures in "Scream," though, are many. The electrifyingly intense and
scary opening sequence with Drew Barrymore is one of the most thrilling
sequences in any thriller I've ever seen. Another plus is the killer who wears
a black cape, and a mask that resembles Edvard Munch's painting, The Scream,
thus making the killer a monstrous figure of pain. The performances by the
actors set the right tone for this material. Neve Campbell makes Sidney into an
effective heroine; a girl tortured by the painful memory of her mother's death,
and with the sad notion that her boyfriend could be the killer. Rose McGowan is
beguiling to watch with her huge eyes and Betty Boop lips as Sidney's
no-nonsense pal, and there's the brooding Skeet Ulrich who resembles Johnny
Depp from the original Elm Street. There's also a pointed jab at the media with
a "To Die For" news reporter (Courteney Cox) who wants to find this stalker by
any means necessary. There are also numerous in-jokes and cameos, including Wes
Craven himself as a janitor named Fred and, if you're quick, Linda Blair as a
reporter.</P>
<P>"Scream" is scary, effective and sometimes haunting, and balances elements of
comedy, horror and satire with ease. But when the typical stalker-in-the-house
routine ending comes in making Sidney less stronger than she was previously,
it's all blood and guts with no imagination or real sense of terror. Craven's
idea was to make a film that would transcend all the cliches of the slasher
film genre, invent some new ones, and bring a creepy sense of menace to the
proceedings. By the end, it's Craven wallowing in the bloody thrills rather
than poking fun at them, and reinventing them. </P>
