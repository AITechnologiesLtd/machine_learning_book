<P>Plot: The world is due to end at midnight - there are six hours left. 
Architect Patrick Wheeler tries to escape his family's attempts to 
celebrate a Christmas dinner, desiring to spend it alone and refusing to 
treat the day as any different and engage in meaningless gestures. But 
he is instead drawn in to helping a woman, Sandra, make her way home 
across a city that is collapsing into anarchy so that she can commit 
suicide with her husband. Meanwhile Patrick's best friend Craig 
determines to spend his remaining hours fulfilling all of his sexual 
fantasies, while a gas company executive sets out to ring every client 
and assure them the gas will be kept on until the very end.</P>
<P>This was one of six international films commissioned in 1998 to 
commemorate the turn of the millennium. Others in the series included 
the Taiwanese 'The Hole' and Hal Hartley's 'Book of Life'. 'Last Night' 
is the Canadian representative and marks the directorial debut of 
actor/screenwriter Don McKellar.</P>
<P>McKellar's film is never specifically mentioned as taking place around 
the millenial turning point. Rather McKellar's spin is to use the 
connection as the springboard for an intriguingly thoughtful What If ? 
drama, to ask how various people would meet the end if everybody had 
only six hours left to live. McKellar has stated that he didn't want to 
make a 'Deep Impact' or an 'Armageddon'. And the difference between 
these and what McKellar is attempting to achieve is immediately apparent 
- where 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon' are driven by state of the art 
special effects and feature only cliche-ridden human dramas, 'Last 
Night' is low-key and driven by characterization. (McKellar has said his 
model for his film was 'The Day the Earth Caught Fire' (1961), although 
the film he actually comes closest to is the little seen 1990 drama 
'Miracle Mile' and to some extent the 'The Last Night of the World' 
segment of 'The Illustrated Man' (1968)). McKellar is wholly unconcerned 
with the show-stopping spectacle of disaster movies - to such extent 
that the type of disaster that is about to occur is never specified 
apart from a vague reference near the end about how there is no night 
anymore which suggests something to do with the sun. The only special 
effects McKellar offers is the most simple effect of having the screen 
white out when the disaster comes.</P>
<P>But where McKellar eschews special effects he achieves considerable 
dramatic effect with small nevertheless potent background details - the 
radio station on the soundtrack that spends the hours counting down the 
Top 500 songs of All Time; the casual suggestion that McKellar makes to 
Oh that she just steal a car to drive home and her sudden realization 
that civilized nicety doesn't matter anymore (the subsequent break-in 
scene amusingly sends up every action movie cliche of trying to jump 
start a car); the hooker who says that she wants to experience an 
orgasm; the people who just sit on a tram car waiting even when they 
know no driver is coming. McKellar's does have a certain awkwardness in 
handling some of the actors in the early scenes but the film quickly 
absorbs and builds a strong climax. Unlike 'Deep Impact' et al none of 
the characters are cliches, each are written with depth and complexity. 
Perhaps the nearest that McKellar comes to cliche is reserving the 
humour for the most obvious target - Rennie as the friend who is 
determined to fulfil all his sexual fantasies - but even that produces 
an extremely funny scene where Rennie awkwardly propositions McKellar 
about trying gay sex. Maybe also one would have liked to have seen a 
little more given over to David Cronenberg's executive character who 
remains a relative enigma. But these are minor faults in an otherwise 
original and undeniably intelligent End of the World drama.</P>
