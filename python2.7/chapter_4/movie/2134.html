<PRE>                                  FORTRESS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This extremely formulaic prison film
     set in the 21st century will be more at home on cable than a
     Flying Wallenda.  Stuart Gordon's future prison looks like it
     is from the 21st Century, but the story feels like it is out
     of the 1950s--the low end of the 1950s.  Gordon is good at
     mixing dark humor and horror, but you couldn't prove it by
     this tired exercise in Sci-Fi (as opposed to science
     fiction).  Rating: high -1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
<P>     I went with friends to see this one.  They had coupons.  It was a
dollar to get into the movie and twenty-five cents for popcorn.  My friend
Dale got the popcorn.  When the film was over I told Dale I hoped he had
gotten a dollar's worth of popcorn because he hadn't gotten twenty-five
cents' worth of film.</P>
<P>     Okay, that is a bit of an overstatement.  But certainly this was a film
that is better to have seen than it was to be seeing it.  There was a breed
of science fiction writing called "space opera" because it was really just a
bad Western or "horse opera" translated to a science fiction story just by
making substitutions.  FORTRESS is not really a science fiction film at all
but a bad prison film thinly disguised as science fiction because it takes
place in the future.  The plot is one long string of prison film cliches.
We have the good guy who is sentenced to prison unfairly for breaking an
unjust law.  He is threatened and abused by the sadistic prison warden while
the tough prisoners want make hamburger out of him.  The toughs try beating
up on him and can't.  Meanwhile he wins the hearts and minds of all the
prisoners but the toughest con and he proves he has guts by taking a
punishment intended for a weaker friend.  But he still has to prove he is
the top of the pecking order by fighting the biggest and meanest of the
prisoners.  By the skin of his teeth he beats up the tough and has him in
his power, but... surprise... he shows mercy.  And on and on ad nauseum.
This is a plot built of one cliche after another.  Except it doesn't take
place in some jerkwater prison in the present, it takes place in Tomorrow.
In this future the ZPG folks AND the pro-life folks have both gotten their
way.  The law in "one woman, one pregnancy."  Our hero tried to have a
second baby after their first baby died.  So into the clinker husband and
wife go.  The prison is privately owned by sadists who somehow can run this
ultra-modern electronic prison on the $26/day/inmate they get from the
state.  This prison may be uncomfortable, but it sure is fancy, and how they
run it on $26/day/inmate is beyond explaining.</P>
<P>     Christopher Lambert did a decent job as Tarzan in GREYSTOKE.  That is
mostly because there seems to be something strange about him that is hard to
put a finger on and there would be with Tarzan also.  But generally he just
is not a very good actor.  In this film his acting seems particularly wooden
as he plays John Brennick, the lone wolf standing up against a society gone
wrong.  Loryn Locklin plays Brennick's beautiful blond wife, loved by
Brennick and lusted after by the nasty warden.  She is bland but she can
speak her lines and does not bump into the furniture.  Kurtwood Smith who
seems to be making a career of playing stern villains (like the
unsympathetic father in DEAD POETS SOCIETY) here plays the prison warden.
As it turns out there is a little more to him than meets the eye at first,
but nothing that is very interesting.  Still admittedly he is a better actor
than either Lambert or Locklin.  Lincoln Kilpatrick--trying hard to be
Morgan Freeman and nearly succeeding--plays a wise old inmate.</P>
<P>     Stuart Gordon who is better known for horror directs, but the drab
prison motif robs this film of the black humor that his REANIMATOR films and
his PIT AND THE PENDULUM had.  About the only aspect of this film that is
above rather than beneath expectation is the art direction and set design.
The prison really has a decent look.  I just wish a better story was written
to take advantage of the look.  My rating for this is a high -1 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
