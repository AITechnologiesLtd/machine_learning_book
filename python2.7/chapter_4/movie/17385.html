Reviewed March 21, 1999.</P>
<P>In the last two weeks of filmgoing, not one, but two films have 
contained characteristics that only the worst director of all-time, Ed 
Wood, could be proud of. The recent "Wing Commander" turned out to be 
one of the very worst movies of the whole decade, while in the new 
animated film, "The King and I," a quality-butchering remake of the 
famous Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, one sequence changes from day to 
night between shots. This foolish mistake might be at least a little 
understandable in a live-action picture, but keep in mind that this 
particular movie wasn't even filmed, but drawn!</P>
<P>In a children's adaptation that sticks to the bare minimum in the story 
department, there truthfully isn't much do discuss in the way of a 
premise, except that a 19th-century schoolteacher named Anna (voiced by 
Miranda Richardson) arrives at the kingdom of the stern King of Siam 
(Martin Vidnovic) to teach his eight children, while the King's evil 
brother, Kralahome (Ian Richardson), plots to destroy him, as well as 
his oldest son, so he can become the King and take over the palace.</P>
<P>To get a taste of how desperate for ideas "The King and I" actually is, 
take, for example, the ludicrous opening scene in which Kralahome 
creates a giant water serpent to cause Anna to shipwreck. Does Anna 
naturally shudder in fear? No, not at all. Why, she decides it would be 
a perfect time to sing the upbeat and delightful song, "I Whistle a 
Happy Tune!" Unfortunately, the film goes even further downhill from 
there, and the only element that kept it from becoming a thoroughly 
unbearable experience was the memorable, if one-dimensional, character 
of Anna, a head-strong woman who speaks up when she disagrees with 
things, and deeply believes in what is right and wrong. Amazingly, 
however, Anna disappears for long stretches of time to concentrate on 
the dull, predictable subplot involving the King's son and his 
blossoming romance with a kind-hearted servant whom he is forbidden to 
be with. Multiple awards for anyone who can guess what happens with this 
couple by the movie's end...</P>
<P>If animated films are expected to be money-makers, they've got to have 
at least something going for them, and obviously Warner Brothers doesn't 
have anything going for them. The animation itself is strictly 
amateurish and Saturday morning cartoonish; at several moments the songs 
are nearly drowned out by the loud, forgettable music score; and the 
overall story follows the basic slapdash formula of all animated films: 
a female protagonist; a male love interest who needs reforming; some 
cuddly animal sidekicks; and a dark, canniving villain that has magical 
powers, not to mention a clumsy, bumbling sidekick. Sigh. As the 
characters repeatedly say to the point of near-monotony throughout, 
etc., etc., etc.</P>
