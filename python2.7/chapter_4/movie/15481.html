<PRE>Celebrity</PRE>
<P>This was the most grievous loss, the most heartfelt tragedy, I
encountered on my weekend quest to see the Star Wars Episode 1 preview
in a movie theater.  Granted, it doesn't rate up there with, say,
having to face a ticked off dragon guarding the castle with the damsel
in distress, but every quest has its hazards and horrors, or you'd just
be able to pick up the, uh, quested object down at the Kwik-E-Mart.</P>
<P>Basically, in a mild fit of mania on Friday, I wandered to some
neighborhood movie theaters, asking whether they were showing the
Preview, and, if so, with what movie.  Most of the answers were
disappointing.  The first place I went to said they were showing it
with "Celebrity."  At that point in the day, I actually wanted to see
that movie, but the show wouldn't start for three hours.  Subsequent
theaters had it with that Brad Pitt in a tux movie, or with "Enemy of
the State", which I'd seen in an earlier Preview sighting attempt.  One
theater said they were showing it, but they weren't sure with which
movie.  At the end of this long, arduous road, one theater's ticket
taker said, yeah, we're showing it, try "Celebrity" at 3:30.  This
smarmy ticket taker, looking a lot like Jon Lovitz with a goatee and
less hair, lied to me.  In this age of the Net, with free-floating
campaigns and vendettas to cause material and psychological damage to
any number of random entities, from the deserving Circuit City/Divx to
Bob, the convenience store clerk who ticked off an 3l33t3 d00d because
the Slurpee just didn't have enough syrup, I'm going to show restraint
and not -- repeat, not -- call down a fatwa against this movie theater
in the East Village that's not the one next to Webster Hall, but a
couple of blocks away.  Except for this incident, I've had good
movie-going experiences there.</P>
<P>Digression aside, "Celebrity" was awful.  Well, it's not as bad as
"Shadows and Fog", so it doesn't qualify as the Worst Woody Allen Movie
Of All Time, but it's up there.  This is basically supposed to be
Woody's meditation on the idea of celebrity.  It plays somewhat more
like a cross between "Annie Hall" and "Husbands and Wives" with a
number of celebrity cameos, but with all the old-fashioned
movie-goodness leached out along with the color.</P>
<P>The main characters are Woody Allen, played by Kenneth Branaugh, and
his ex-wife, played by Judy Davis.  The movie has a self-referencing
moment in it, when there's a film premiere from a pretentious director
who always shoots in black and white, but a more interesting
self-reference may be to have Branaugh give his Woody Allen character
some sort of Hamlet spin, but that'd hark too much back to those early,
funny films.  Branaugh does such a shockingly good job being Woody
Allen, there's really no need for Woody to step in front of the camera
again.  </P>
<P>In any case, there was this divorce that takes place before the movie
starts, with the Woody Allen character wanting to sow his oats and the
Judy Davis character trying to recover.  Various hijinks ensue, as the
Woody Allen character, in this incarnation, is a movie industry
reporter, chasing after various starlets and aspiring starlets.  The
exploration of celebrity is touched on briefly in his various
encounters with actors and actresses, perhaps most prominently when he
meets Leonardo DiCaprio playing, uh, Leonardo DiCaprio.  There's also
Charlize Theron as a supermodel, which made me realize that either
Branaugh is really short or Theron is really tall.  Oh, and Winona
Ryder is using a Wonderbra nowadays.  You can learn more about
celebrity by reading the back cover of the historian Daniel Boorstin's
book, "The Image" (which is where celebrity is first defined as being
famous for being famous).</P>
<P>Anyway, the fates of the Woody Allen and Judy Davis characters take
their expected trajectories, with one expected happiness on the road to
loneliness, and vice versa.  There's nothing much to see here.  The
story of divergent was better told in "Annie Hall", the one about
separation in "Husbands and Wives".</P>
<P>Oh, I finally did see the Star Wars preview the next day, unfortunately
not in a movie theater, but as an mpeg.  And, you know, this little
window showing two minutes of grainy video was far more worthwhile than
"Celebrity."</P>
