<PRE>Kiss the Girls        
Review by Larry McGillicuddy
Copyright Larry McGillicuddy</PRE>
<P>**** (out of 4)
Directed by Gary Fleder
Starring Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Cary Elwes, Jay O. Sanders, Bill 
Nunn, Tony Goldwyn, Jeremy Piven</P>
<P>Great characters can carry a substandard story very far. If you can 
become involved in them, it overshadows the weaker plot aspects and makes 
a movie entertaining. On the other hand, if you have a solid, if somewhat 
familiar story, great characters can make that movie a memorable viewing 
experience and one of the most entertaining films of the year. Kiss the 
Girls is that kind of movie.</P>
<P>Morgan Freeman stars as Alex Cross, a forensic psychologist who comes to 
North Carolina to investigate the disappearance of several young women, 
one of whom is his own neice. Cross is a quietly intense man who could be 
ready to break out in rage at any moment.  The police chief warns him 
about not overstepping his bounds in one of the more cliched scenes in 
the movie, but as the movie progresses there is no attempt to derail 
Freeman's involvement in the investigation.</P>
<P>All of the kidnap victims are beautiful, strong, and talented women in 
their 20's So the first time we see Ashley Judd appear in the movie, we 
know what's going to happen. Judd plays a lonely medical intern who 
trains at kickboxing. She is kidnapped from her house, in a terrifyingly 
effective sequence that would make Wes Craven proud.</P>
<P>The kidnapper's dungeon has an errie and creative design. While spending 
time in the dungeon, Judd goes through a range of emotions and this is 
when her character really start to take focus, and Judd gets to display 
her expansive range. Then in an absolutely brilliant suspense sequence, 
Judd makes her escape, blinded by the first sign of light and lost among 
the dizzying pattern of the forest. The sequence ends with an effective 
lift from the Fugitive.</P>
<P>>From then on, the movie takes the form of a buddy movie, as Freeman and 
Judd team up to find this mysterious kidnapper. The teaming up of two of 
the most natural actors in Hollywood proves to be a terrific casting 
decision. Freeman and Judd work off each other like seasoned pros and 
their unforced chemistry in every scene is fascinating.</P>
<P>Kiss the Girls does run into a few problems, but it's hard to remember 
them now. With such talent on hand, the flaws are remembered for a couple 
minutes and then are just an afterthought, if that. Gary Fleder shows an 
impressive ability in staging his suspense and action sequences, and in 
between, he lets Freeman and Judd do their stuff, unhindered by lame 
pseudo-fancy camera shots that many younger directors think make a great 
film these days. Kiss the Girls may have a story with some familiar 
aspects, but the execution is near perfect from all involved.  Let's get 
Freeman and Judd together in another movie immediately.</P>
