<PRE>                         NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN
                      A film review by Bradley Null
                       Copyright 1997 Bradley Null</PRE>
<P>     With Night Falls on Manhattan, Sidney Lumet has created one of the
most dedicated issue movies in a long time.  As a high-profile, yet
righteous, defense attorney (a first in modern film), Richard Dreyfuss's
character admits that he took an unwinnable case because he wanted to
expose corruption in the NYPD.  Lumet seems to have created an
unwinnable film for similar reasons.</P>
<P>     Lumet has taken a very bare-bones approach with the plot of Night
Falls on Manhattan.  One minute Andy Garcia's Sean Casey is an assistant
DA trainee, the next minute he is the District Attorney of New York. 
Likewise, the first twenty minutes of the film set up a courtroom drama
which Lumet flies through in a series of quick scenes.  Unconventional
editing techniques, including periodic jump cuts and abrupt truncations
of scenes that barely seem to have begun, help push the narrative
forward, all of which serves to confuse the audience as to the film's
true focus.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, it becomes clear that the goal of this hectic structure
is to unfold a series of issues for the audience.  Lumet confronts us
with tough questions at every turn:  Who do we blame for police
corruption?  To whom is a lawyer most responsible, the law or his
family?  How much can we share with the people we love?  Lumet packs it
in, and he does so by creating several only-in-Hollywood coincidences. 
For example, Garcia happens to be in the right place to try the case of
the drug dealer that shot his father.  The perfect woman for Garcia also
just happens to work for a lawyer on the other side.</P>
<P>     The issues and questions that Lumet poses are powerful, but his
plot manipulation and acceleration for the sake of these issues hurts
his bid to satisfy a sophisticated audience.  In his need to get in and
out of every scene in half the time that it should take to develop,
Lumet seems to have resorted to a short-hand form of directing his
actors.  At every emotional point in the story, one character invariably
begins yelling.  Lumet is obviously trying to make a point that such
issues lead to uniform short-temperedness, but the consistency of these
outbursts prevents us from distinguishing the different character's
personalities.</P>
<P>     With this subject matter, Lumet is obviously trying to make a
gritty, un-Hollywood picture.  The sets (such as a courtroom modeled
after Lance Ito's instead of Perry Mason's) and the overwhelmingly drab
color of the film beg us to look at it as a slice of realism.  However,
the plot twists and flat characters confound this attempt to make an
intelligent film.  Lena Olin, miscast and unbelievable as Andy Garcia's
love interest, portrays the most awkward character.  Not until the end
of the film does it become clear that her character is actually in love
with Garcia's, when the plot resolution tells us so.</P>
<P>     An audience looking for a traditional Hollywood courtroom drama
will be taken aback by Night Falls on Manhattan.  Nevertheless, it
brings with it some powerful questions which a thoughtful audience will
want addressed.  In the end, the film's uncomfortable blend of Hollywood
conventions and complex subject matter will have a hard time finding its
audience among the main-stream majority of moviegoers that are only
looking for answers.</P>
