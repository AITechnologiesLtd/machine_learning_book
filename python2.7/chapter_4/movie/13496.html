<PRE>SMALL SOLDIERS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        In 1984, Joe Dante made a modest little film called "Gremlins," in
which a boy's cute little alien pet spawned a legion of very nasty
creatures that devasted a picture-postcard perfect town.  In 1998, he made
exactly the same picture, this time calling it "Small Soldiers."  That's
about it.</P>
<P>        "Gremlins" had some decent ideas, but its creativity was undermined
by in-jokes, sappy side characters, and too much repetitive violence.
Since "Small Soldiers" is essentially the same picture as "Gremlins," the
same criticisms apply.</P>
<P>        "Small Soldiers" starts out promisingly enough.  The new hard-line
head cheese at toy manufacturer Hartland Play Systems seeks innovation.
Toys that do what they appear to do in the commercials.  Talk.  Move.
Shoot.  Kill.  With today's technology it shouldn't be a problem, right?
He gives his remaining two employees three months to revamp their latest
product ideas.</P>
<P>        The merchandise is a collection of action figures called the
Commando Elite, headed up by Chip Hazard (voiced by Tommy Lee Jones).
They're a super tough rabble of  Rambo-like mercenaries with Jay Leno
chins; their incessant motto is "There will be no mercy."  Since action
figures need adversaries, the toy makers also conceive the Gorgonites, a
race of various alien creatures who look like rejects from the bar scene in
"Star Wars."  Emissary of the Gorgonites is a reptilian humanoid called
Archer.  His voice is supplied by a very polite sounding Frank Langella.</P>
<P>        In order for these toys to look and feel like the real thing, their
creators seek out a super microchip (using the Boolean arguments
"microcomputer chip," "state-of-the-art," and "surplus" via that darned
Internet), discovering the X1000 courtesy the Defense Department.  One
thing proves to be key about the X1000 munitions chip, however: it's
defective (perhaps "surplus" was an infelicitous search term to use?).</P>
<P>        Before the Commando Elite and the Gorgonites can be recalled, a kid
called Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith), whose father has left him in charge
of the company store, helps a shipment fall off the back of a truck, so to
speak.  Before you can scream "Gremlins 2" (better make that "Gremlins 3,"
since Dante is already credited with an official sequel), the pumped-up
plastic commandos have busted out of their shrink wrap and are tracking
down their arch enemies.  Unfortunately the passive Gorgonites have been
programmed only to hide and lose.</P>
<P>        At this point in the film we're well into "Gremlins" territory,
with the Commando Elite causing much twelve-inch mayhem courtesy Stan
Winston's animatronic and computer effects.</P>
<P>        Not all of "Small Soldiers" is a bust.  Tommy Lee Jones is
appropriately "cast" as Chip, who talks in a plethora of (often mixed-up)
military clichés, and Denis Leary, in a small role as the cut-throat CEO,
is typically dry and effective.  Also, the idea behind creating toys that
actually perform like they do in the TV spots, without explicity showing
the kids doing all of the work, had some potential.  But Dante and his four
screenwriters trash the interesting possibilities behind the concept as
quickly as their diminutive militia trash the town.</P>
<P>        By all means remake a bad movie and improve on the original.  Or
remake an old, good movie for the benefit of today's audience.  "Small
Soldiers" does neither.  It takes a mediocre movie and makes a mediocre
movie out of it.</P>
