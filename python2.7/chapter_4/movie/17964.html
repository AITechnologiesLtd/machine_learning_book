<P>"A Walk on the Moon," actor Tony Goldwyn's directing debut, is similar 
in place and time to 1987's far superior "Dirty Dancing." Both are set 
in the nostalgic '60s, during the summer, in the Catskills, and feature 
a female protagonist finally able to come into her own. But while "Dirty 
Dancing" got me involved in the characters and the beautiful setting, "A 
Walk on the Moon" is a smaller, slighter, and less-involving drama.</P>
<P>Set during the crucial summer of '69 when man first walked on the moon 
and the infamous Woodstock took place (both of which are conveniently 
portrayed here), Pearl Kantrowitz (Diane Lane) is an unsatisfied 
31-year-old woman who married her high school sweetheart, Marty (Liev 
Schreiber), when she was still a teenager and accidentally got pregnant. 
Despite having certain goals and dreams, Pearl and Marty both decided to 
take responsibility for their actions and be good parents. While on a 
summer-long vacation in the Catskills, Marty, a television repairman, is 
only able to come up on the weekends since there is a mad rush for t.v. 
sets due to the impending moon landing, leaving Pearl; her rebellious 
14-year-old daughter, Alison (Anna Paquin), who is just discovering and 
getting involved in boys; her precocious 5-year-old son; and her 
children's grandmother (Tovah Feldshuh), to fend for themselves during 
the week. By chance, Pearl meets Walker Jerome (Viggo Mortensen), a 
travelling "blouse man" whom, to her utter surprise, she sees as a light 
at the end of a dark tunnel, and starts an affair with, therefore 
putting her marriage and children's trust into jeopardy.</P>
<P>"A Walk on the Moon" is an overall unsatisfying domestic drama that 
feels like it begins in mid-stream, without any proper introduction to 
the characters, and it took me the film's first hour to actually get 
into the story. Even then, with only 45 minutes to go, the characters 
themselves always seemed to be standing at a far distance from me, and 
it was difficult to understand the motives of the central character, 
Pearl. We are supposed to believe that she is taken aback by Walker, but 
he is never written as a fully developed character, but more of a 
symbol, and therefore the whole plotting comes off as a mere contrivance 
in order to give us a story of "self-discovery."</P>
<P>If anything, the performances certainly can't be faulted. Diane Lane, a 
wonderful actress who began a promising career in the early '80s with 
such films as "The Outsiders" and "Rumble Fish," before resorting to 
low-rent or underused roles, has finally been given her first 
substantially satisfying in recent years. Lane proves a sympathetic 
heroine, even when she is making some very numskull decisions that are 
difficult to understand. In what comes off as one of the few successes 
in an otherwise largely unrealized screenplay, by Pamela Gray, the 
character of Marty is portrayed as not simply the "husband," but a real 
person who is genuinely good, even when considering that he sacrificed 
his own life for his family, and Liev Schreiber is up to every 
challenge. Giving the film's most assured and poignant performance is 
Anna Paquin, already an Academy Award winner (for 1993's "The Piano"), 
and at 16, she has already become one of the best actresses of her 
respective generation. A subplot involving Paquin's character of Alison 
discovering romance for the first time is supposed to come off as a 
catalyst to Pearl's blossoming affair, but not nearly enough time is 
devoted to her. Paquin is given the best scenes, however, including a 
bravura one in which Alison confronts her mother concerning her affair, 
and another in which she has a loving, truthful conversation with her 
father. Viggo Mortensen is the one weak link in the central roles, but I 
suspect this is due to his underwritten role of the "blouse man." There 
is no room given for Mortensen to create a definite personality, and 
director Goldwyn unwisely chooses to add a bunch of pointless sex scenes 
to stand as character development. And the likely winner of best 
performance by an actress in an unseen role goes to Julie Kavner as the 
resort's P.A. announcer, who is constantly announcing things over the 
intercom, including even Alison's first period!</P>
<P>Regardless of the obvious low budget, the film verifiably recreates 
Woodstock in a breathtaking sequence in which, allegedly, 300 people 
were transformed into hundreds of thousands via computer digitization. 
It ends up being an anticlimax, though, and before we are given a chance 
to see it, the film hurriedly moves on to something else.</P>
<P>"A Walk on the Moon" unmistakably feels like a rough cut of a possibly 
good movie. There's a fulfilling one lurking around in there somewhere, 
but the film feels too rushed and, because of this, no emotional 
momentum is allowed to build up. I liked Pearl, and I liked Alison, and 
Marty, but I'd like them even more in a better overall film. Not only 
does the story in "A Walk on the Moon" feel like a plot device, but it 
is also tiresome and unoriginal. So many similar motion pictures have 
been made, and more successfully, that this one only pales in 
comparison. That's too bad, because, even though not alive during the 
decade, I do have a fondness for the '60s.</P>
