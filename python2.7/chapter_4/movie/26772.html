<PRE>"Little Nicky"</PRE>
<P>Nicky (Adam Sandler) is a good boy, a sweet boy. He is also the spawn of
the Devil (Harvey Keitel). Dad has been on the throne of Hell for 10,000
years, but decides not to abdicate to any of his three sons. Nicky's elder
brothers Adrian (Rhys Ifans) and Cassius (Tom "Tiny" Lister, Jr.) have
designs on dad's throne and the pair vamoose to the mortal world to upset
the delicate balance between good and evil. This upheaval would mean the
end of Satan and it's up to Nicky to go after his malevolent siblings and
bring them back to Hell to save his Daddy in "Little Nicky."</P>
<P>Adam Sandler is an extraordinarily likable actor and comedian who captured
the hearts of American moviegoers with his comedy/romance "The Wedding
Singer." He solidified his icon status (and a $20 million paycheck) with
the good-natured and goofy "The Water Boy," then again with the malevolent
hit, "Big Daddy." Now, the comedian takes on his biggest role every - the
Son of Satan.</P>
<P>On the surface, this should be a ready-made laugher that just has to
capitalize on the good-versus-evil nature of the story and the comic
presence of Sandler. Nicky has a sweet disposition even if he is the demon
seed of the Devil. He has no designs to replace his Prince of Darkness dad
and seems like the wrong one to send to earth to bring back his brothers.
Adrian and Cassius team up to corrupt the morals of man and replace Satan
in Hell. The demonic duo engineer such heinous events as lowering the
drinking age to ten and changing New York's logo to "I Love Hookers." When
they take over Hell, they want to be sure they have a lot of new clients.</P>
<P>As Nicky endeavors to capture his bad brothers, he falls for a good-hearted
mortal woman name Valerie (Patricia Arquette). This proves a problem as
Nicky is torn between his mission and his budding love for Valerie,
jeopardizing daddy's wellbeing. This complicates things, as Nicky has to
worry about his newly found love as well as saving his daddy.</P>
<P>The problem with "Little Nicky" is that it is a comedy without humor. The
screenplay, by Tim Herlihy, wastes most opportunities for laughs on routine
pratfalls and lame devil on earth jokes. Some attempt at cleverness comes
with the arrival of two goofy dudes, Pete and John (Peter Dante and
Jonathan Loughran), but these apostles are more like Led Zeppelin hangers
on than disciples of the potential anti-Christ. Another sadly executed gag
involves Curt Howard (Ron's brother) dressing in drag - there was something
funny about this in concept that is woefully humorless in execution. The
script also makes reference to Roberto Benigni's "The Monster," but fails
to capitalize on this, and to "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and
"Frankenstein." It goes nowhere with these paths and just drops the thread
of these plot lines. Oh, yeah. The big battle for command of Hell is a
pillow fight</P>
<P>There is good-naturedness to Nicky that makes the character likable despite
the inane happenings around him. Sandler comes out best in a bad movie with
his self-effacing charm and niceness - you come to find out that Dad made
it with an angel (Reese Witherspoon) eons ago and Nicky was the result of
that union. The vast supporting cast around Nicky is made up of a who's who
list in Hollywood that, unfortunately, has little to do. Rodney Dangerfield
(as grandpa Lucifer), Dana Carvey, Jon Lovitz, Quentin Tarantino, Kevin
Neelon, Michael McKean, Carl Weathers, Rob Schneider, Henry Winkler, Ozzie
Osbourne and Regis Philbin, among others, make their appearances in cameo
perfs. It is a real waste of riches as no one has anything funny to do or
say.</P>
<P>Techs are good, but even visions of Hell can't save "Little Nicky." I give
it a D.</P>
