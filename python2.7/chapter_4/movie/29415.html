<P>   Nobody ever says "all you need is love" in this movie--which
could probably fit neatly into some WOR-TV schedule on a
Wednesday at 5 p.m.--but the subtext is there.  "Kill Me Later" is
about a woman, Shawn (Selma Blair) who has had a
dysfunctional childhood (product of a divorced dad) and who
works in a bank--and is worked on in bed by her boss Matthew
(D.W. Moffett).  The trouble is that Matthew is not about to break
up his marriage to his pregnant wife, though Selma insists "I
never asked you to leave your wife."  Original this is not.  So
what's a poor girl to do when his silly boss chooses to remain
with his own family?  Suicide, of course.  After all, even a pretty
woman like Shawn can't bear to live without this jerk, and despite
her knockout of a figure and her tasteful, black, urban threads,
she sees no prospect of something better. The question remains:
how to do herself in?  Jump off a high building?  Leap from a
bridge?  </P>
<P>   Nah.  Some postmodern Prince Charming is always ready to
save such an unhappy individual, and what better choice for a
man than someone far more exciting than a bank manager...how
about a dashing bank robber who is sensitive to a female's
needs?</P>
<P>   The movie gets its title from Shawn's verbal contract with a
bank robber whose plans were about to be foiled by the police,
Charlie (Max Beesley).  "I'll help you escape," she offers when he
thinks he's merely taking her as an unwilling hostage, "If you will
kill me later.  The story is banal enough, with decent performers
like Selma Blair ("Cruel Intentions") and Max Beesley ("The Last
Minute") unable to do much with a script devoid of wit to say
nothing of credibility.  But director Dana Lustig makes matters
worse with some film-school, music-video jump cuts, excessive
use of a blue filter at one point during a car chase, and generic,
intrusive rock music.  As young cop-old cop, Lochlyn Munro and
O'Neal Compton are locked into the hackneyed roles of bright kid
with scientific theories of suicide vs. seen-it-all-what's-with-you-
and-your-notions cynic.</P>
