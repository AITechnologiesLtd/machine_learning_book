<PRE>
 Krippendorf's Tribe (1998) 2 1/2 stars out of 4</PRE>
<P> Krippendorf's Tribe  is an old-fashioned piece of fluff from Touchstone
Pictures, one of the Disney studio's subsidiaries.</P>
<P> This is no coincidence, as the movie has that quaint kind of feeling as if
it were from the old Disney factory of the late 1950s or early '60s. Only,
to accommodate the '90s, this film adds a few profanities and a hint of
sex.</P>
<P>  Otherwise, 40 or 30 years ago, this comedy could have starred Fred
MacMurray or Dean Jones, instead of Richard Dreyfuss. And someone such as
Suzanne Pleshette could have played the Jenna Elfman role, while Annette,
Tommy Kirk or Kurt Russell and little "Moochie" would have nicely filled
the roles of the professor's children.</P>
<P> The slight story is about ant anthropology professor who, after the death
of his wife-partner, goes through burn out. Instead of using his grant
money to find a lost tribe of aborigines in New Guinea, he spends the money
on food and to make house payments.</P>
<P> Comes the day of his long-awaited lecture concerning the discovery of his
lost tribe, and poor Professor Krippendorf, at the prodding of a pushy
former student-turned-anthropologist (Elfman), pulls himself together long
enough to con his way through his talk in which he creates a fictitious
tribe, the Shelmikedmu, named after his children, Shelley, Mickey and
Edmund.</P>
<P> The entire fluff snowballs, as things usually do in such comedies, until
the professor drafts his kids into being the "natives" he filmed on his
expedition by faking scenes in his own back yard.</P>
<P> The rest, of course, is predictable, but that does not diminish the
movie's fun. Familiarity, in this case, does not breed contempt, but rather
a comfortable expectation of what's ahead.</P>
<P>  The performances are a bit over the top, especially those of Dreyfuss and
Lily Tomlin, who plays his academic rival.</P>
<P>  Elfman has an effervescent presence that carries over from her Dharma and
Greg  TV sitcom, only here she is more worldly and conniving than her
small-screen counterpart.</P>
<P> Krippendorf's Tribe is a family film with several laughs and a few
misfires. It's a junk-food movie that can be easily digested without fear
of any after-effects.</P>
