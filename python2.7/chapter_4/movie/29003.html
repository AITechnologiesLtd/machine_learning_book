<P>This review will be shorter than normal, because there's not a lot to
say about "The Closet," and that's just fine. Light as a soufflé, the
subtitled French farce takes a simple premise and runs with it. Ten
minutes after you leave the theater, you likely won't remember a thing
about "The Closet," except that it gave you one big belly laugh, several
chuckles and a lot of smiles.</P>
<P>The set up: After 20 years of faithful service at the rubber factory,
François Pignon (Daniel Auteuil) is about to be let go. The company has
nothing against the man; he is simply so unmemorable that sacking him
seems an easy way to cut costs. When Pignon tells new neighbor Belone
(Michel Aumont) about his pending fate, the elderly fellow cooks up an
idea: Doctor a photo to make it look as if Pignon is gay, then send it
anonymously to his workplace. Once word spreads around the company,
management will be afraid to fire him and open themselves to charges of
bigotry.</P>
<P>So, despite being 100% heterosexual, Pignon comes out of the closet, and
everything changes. Felix (Gerard Depardieu), a co-worker who bullied
Pignon in the past, becomes fearful that he will fired for being
homophobic and desperately tries to befriend the bewildered man. Other
co-workers who dismissed Pignon as hopelessly bland now decide that it
was all part of his cover. Pignon's sullen teenage son Franck (Stanislas
Crevillen) decides that Dad is now interesting, and his supervisor, Mlle
Bertrand (Michele Laroque) finds him intriguing as well. Meanwhile,
Belone, who was once fired for being gay, savors the irony of the
situation.</P>
<P>That's really all there is to it. As farces go, "The Closet" isn't
ambitious. The film offers no grand statements, just a clever idea and
exceptional cast. In a summer of cinematic disappointments, this modest
offering is a cool drink of water.</P>
