<PRE>THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI (1948)</PRE>
<P>"Maybe I'll live so long that I'll forget her. Maybe I'll die trying."</P>
<PRE>3.5 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane, Glenn Anders,
Ted de Corsia;
Written & Directed by Orson Welles, from a novel by Sherwood King;
Cinematography by Charles Lawton, Jr.</P>
<P>        Orson Welles's THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI reveals, as usual, a director
much enamoured of his own genius.  It dresses up its plot with spectacular
flourishes which frame and punctuate and sometimes overshadow the action.
Crucial scenes are backdropped by the Acapulco coastline, an aquarium
filled with very predatory seeming fish, a play in a Chinese theatre, and
an abandoned amusement park.   But Welles has the talent to flaunt his own
skill and get away with it, and he does, for the most part: THE LADY FROM
SHANGHAI is a wonderful film to look at.</P>
<P>        The story itself is classic noir fare, and must have seemed rather
routine even in 1948.  Welles plays worldly Irishman Michael O'Hara, who
falls for a beautiful enigmatic dame, Elsa, who, as played by Rita
Hayworth, is so blonde, imperial, and frigid she could be a Hitchcock
heroine.  Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister, a rich crippled lawyer (the
scene-stealing Everett Sloane).  Michael, after rescuing Elsa from
ruffians, is hired as bosun on the Bannisters' yacht, where his life is
complicated by his infatuation with Elsa, the schemes of Bannister's
partner, and the suspicion of his detective.  The cruise from San Francisco
to Mexico and back is rife with tension.  Everyone's double-crossing
everyone, unsurprisingly.</P>
<P>        We are given variations on the eternal noir themes: lust, greed,
corruption, betrayal.  One can sense Welles tweaking the material, trying
to put his own spin on it, adding clever touches in the background.  It's
entertaining as hell, with tart dialogue and extravagant performances, but
it seems somewhat forced.  At times the director's grandstanding is too
distracting, no more so than in a wildly overplayed courtroom scene, which
features preposterous plot twists (Bannister cross-examines himself on the
witness stand) and odd comical twitches (a juror whose sneezes keep
interrupting the prosecutor).  It deflates the doom-laden atmosphere which
has been building thus far.</P>
<P>        Never mind: the film soon recovers.  The famous finale--a gunfight
staged in a hall of mirrors--is a magnificent piece of virtuoso
film-making, with faces fracturing and multiplying and overlapping other
faces in kaleidoscopic patterns.  The fragmentation of images perfectly
dramatizes the disintegration of the characters' identities, as they fail
to resolve the contradictory roles they have enacted in pursuit of their
tangled schemes.</P>
<P>        But, again, the directorial brilliance is too much.  It takes the
emphasis off the tense confrontation which lies at the heart of film noir,
when illusion is stripped away, when characters are forced to reckon with
the deceptions they have wrought and the lies they have believed.  As a
stage director, Welles should know when to let his actors do the work
rather than his camera, but as hearts are being laid bare, he is still
showing off.  It's mighty impressive, but lacks the stark immediacy of,
say, THE MALTESE FALCON.</P>
<P>        There are blackly intense scenes to be found, nonetheless.  The
relations amongst Bannister and his wife and his partner betoken a deep
cynicism about human behaviour, verbalized by Michael in a showy but
effective monologue about sharks killing each other in a feeding frenzy.
There is a quiet conversation between Bannister and Michael while awaiting
a trial verdict that goes straight for the gut in its unsoftened
representation of hate and moral bankruptcy.  But although it's noir, it's
not noir enough: as a whole, the movie feels like the work of an inspired
director elaborating on material he doesn't quite believe in.  The touch of
evil is never truly felt.</P>
