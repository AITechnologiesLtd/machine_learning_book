<PRE>CECIL B. DEMENTED
Reviewed on March 28th, 2001
By Jerry Saravia</PRE>
<P>I am not sure what to make of John Waters at this point. The witty Baltimore 
trash director who opened the world's eyes with the fabulously disgusting 
"Pink Flamingos" has followed that hit with more lows than highs. For every 
"Hairspray" and "Serial Mom," there were travesties to cinematic decency such 
as "Cry-Baby" and "Pecker." "Cecil B. Demented" shows me a director who is 
sinking to such a low extreme that I found myself trying to come up for air 
repeatedly. </P>
<P>Cecil B. Demented (Stephen Dorff) is a no-budget film director/cult leader 
who along with his crew, known as the "Sprocket Holes," kidnap a famous movie 
star, Honey Whitlock (Melanie Griffith) and force her to star in their own 
demented production. Cecil's intent is to shoot a film titled "Raging Beauty" 
about outlaw filmmakers who bust in and out of multiplexes, production 
meetings and more multiplexes to proclaim their rant that Hollywood, 
basically, sucks! Their hostage, Honey with a peroxide hairdo, will help them 
fight their cause by threatening everyone with a gun and ranting their 
philosophies such as "Death to those who support mainstream cinema!"  </P>
<P>"The Sprocket Holes" are a motley crew of punkish, insufferably smug 
character types that include Cherish (Alicia Witt), an incest victim who is 
also a former porno star; a drug addict named Lyle (Adrienne Grenier) who 
consumes all substances and plays the leading man in Demented's film, and 
Rodney (Jack Noseworthy), the hair stylist, who hates being heterosexual. 
There is also a makeup artist, Raven (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a Satanic 
worshipper who adores Kenneth Anger and Aleister Crowley, and a butch female 
cinematographer and producer, and so on. None of these characters elicit much 
interest or inspiration. They come across as flat caricatures. </P>
<P>In the end, that may be the problem with John Waters. His last excruciating 
film, "Pecker", was so flatly staged that it induced boredom more than 
anything else. There is no drive, no energy, no real sense of movement in 
this film either. You get the sense that Waters only filmed one take of every 
scene with no punch or irony. Of course, none of that would matter if the 
film was funny but it is decidely not. The fundamental question is: who is 
Waters really attacking in this film? It may seem like Hollywood but that is 
a moot point when you consider savagely funny satires such as "The Player", 
"Living in Oblivion" and "My Life's in Turnaround," to name but a few. Also 
consider how in the last few years, independent films have become almost as 
mainstream as Hollywood. Has Waters heard of Miramax, which is literally 
Hollywood in the East Coast, the same company that produced "The English 
Patient"? The term "indie" has been abused so often that the line between 
Hollywood and independent is very thin. And what company has produced Waters 
latest? Well, it is Artisan entertainment, the same company that puts its 
label on a new video edition of Schwarzeneger's "The Terminator"! </P>
<P>"Cecil B. Demented" is simply not demented enough or savage enough to really 
attack its targets and so as satire, it fails miserably. The actors shout and 
rant but with little purpose or ingenuity. The film ends with a crowd forming 
around the drive-in showing of Honey's last Hollywood opus while Cecil and 
his demented group go around having sex with each other while the cops shoot 
at them. It may seem radical but I would call it desperate at best. </P>
