<P>The man behind FORREST GUMP (7.5/10) and CONTACT (6.5/10), Robert
Zemeckis, spent his formative years in "smaller" movie directions, as
his eighties ventures rumbled him through BACK TO THE FUTURE (8/10),
WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? (7/10) and the dismal sequel to this film,
JEWEL OF THE NILE (6/10). </P>
<P>PLOT:
Hopeless romantic and novelist Joan Wilder must deliver a map to
Columbia in order to save her sister's life from the hands of
kidnappers. Joan is a total urbanite, and falls prey to some
misinformation once in South America, and must survive the jungles
alongside her deputized guide, Jack Colton, who is only in it for the
money. Many other evil people want the treasure map, and inspire
several adventures.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Entertaining, adventurous, short, and somewhat dated adventure movie
that stood out from the RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (8.5/10) copycats
through the mid-eighties. Good chemistry between stars Douglas and
Turner render this film bearable through many of its predictably
romantic liaisons, while the well-spaced spurts of action give the film
enough punch to designate a fun time. I veered from the nachos on this
one occasion (forgive me father), and tossed over some bills for a
thin-crusted pizza and breadsticks, but now recognize the error of my
ways, and apologize for my misguidedness.</P>
<P>This movie also balances many funny and light moments on one hand, and
suspense and action in the other. In the same vein, ROMANCING THE STONE
can be considered an all-family movie, because it does not contain any
scenes of extreme violence, sex or sailor-like swearing. It does
contain some nasty bad guys, despite their one-dimensionality, and
manages to skewer adventure through its entire meandering plot line.
Another great thing about this movie is the smoldering sexuality and
come-hither quality of the "young" and beautiful Kathleen Turner. This
film reminded me of the many reasons behind my puppy crush on her back
in the Duran Duran eighties (see wet nipple scene), and saddened me in
regards to her more recent acting work (see her latest TV movie of the
week.)</P>
<P>The one extremely bad aspect of this movie (and perhaps of most
eighties films, now that we look back on them) is the cheezy,
uninspired and ultimately annoying soundtrack and score from this
movie. The synchronized noises through most of the film did nothing but
harass my attention while I was enjoying the suspense and action, and
did very little in the way of enhancing any actual scenes. But I
digress on my small point, since for the most part, the film did manage
to generate great entertainment, some light and romantic moments, and
many scenes sprinkled with action and adventure.  </P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Kathleen Turner spoke the uncredited voice of sexy Jessica Rabbit in
the toon-noir Zemeckis-helmed flick WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? (7/10). 
Danny DeVito stands 5 feet tall.
Michael Douglas' smaller brother Joel, was also a co-producer on this
film, as well as being the 1st assistant director.
The phrase "Romancing the Stone" is a piece of jewellers' jargon,
referring to a step in preparing a gem for use in jewellery.
Eddy Grant recorded the title song, but it was never used.
Alan Silvestri was hired to do a temporary score for the film, but
director Robert Zemeckis like his work so much that he kept him on as
composer.</P>
