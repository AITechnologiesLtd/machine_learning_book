<PRE>Dogma
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) DOGMA entertained me but it did not impress me.</P>
<P>Kevin Smith (Chasing Amy, Clerks) is both a good writer and a bad
writer. His ideas are inventive, perceptive, and honest. His material is
some of the freshest around. On the other hand, his characters speak in
wordy monologues and obvious plot-driven exposition.</P>
<P>DOGMA is a comic-book-like story of two angels bent on getting into
heaven as human souls. Their plan is to become human, walk through a
Catholic loophole to purify themselves, then die and go to straight to
heaven. Of course, once they do this all of creation will be unmade, but
what do they care? No foul, no harm, right?</P>
<P>The mythic rules of this heroic tale are those of the rich, complex
world of Catholic dogma. The hero (Bethany, played by Linda Fiorentino)
is referred to as the Last Scion. Her spirit guides are the Seraphim
Metatron (how's THAT for a comic book name? -- he's played by Alan
Rickman) and the thirteenth Apostle (Chris Rock). She's aided by two
prophets (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, reprising their roles as Jay and
Silent Bob). And the beast trying to stop her is the Demon Azrael (Jason
Lee) who abets the fallen angels and sends three skating minions and a
Shit Demon against the hero (okay, maybe the Shit Demon isn't a Catholic
symbol).</P>
<P>At first glance it seems irreverent, if not downright heretical. Among
other things, Bethany works at an abortion clinic and must perform
euthanasia to save the world. But deeper down, Smith really seems to
take it seriously. He DOES poke fun at the church, but always as an
insider, like he's making fun of himself. He never takes any cruel,
cheap shots, and he never disses it just to shock or annoy. There's
always a sense of real acceptance of and interest in the church. No
other movie in recent memory has so many characters talking seriously
about religion.</P>
<P>Unfortunately this talking is often stagey and obvious. In order to work
in everything he has to say, Smith's characters speak as if in a play.
Nobody interrupts the paragraph-length discussions on race, the
structure of the church, and on the validity of "Plenary Indulgences" –
the loophole that will allow the angels to get away with the murder of
Creation.</P>
<P>Although the discussions are interesting and relevant to the topic of
the film, a narrative film isn't the best art form for what Smith's
lengthy speeches. A comic book would be much more appropriate. (On the
other hand, feature filmmaking has a broader audience for Smith's
message. As Metatron said, "If there isn't a movie about it, it isn't
worth knowing, is it?")</P>
<P>As a non-Catholic, I found DOGMA to be entertaining, but I could tell
that about half of the jokes went over my head. I felt like I was the
third person in a conversation between two old friends. In other words,
Smith's movie did not speak to me at all.</P>
<P>To Catholics with a sense of humor about themselves, I would recommend
this movie more highly. For the rest of us, it's an entertaining, if
unimpressive matinee.</P>
