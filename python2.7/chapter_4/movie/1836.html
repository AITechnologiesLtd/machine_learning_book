<PRE>                            POINT OF NO RETURN
                       A film review by Sally Smith
                        Copyright 1993 Sally Smith</PRE>
<P>Starring Bridget Fonda, Gabriel Byrne, Dermot Mulroney, Anne Bancroft,
         Harvey Keitel, and Miguel Ferrer
Directed by John Badham
Screenplay by Robert Getchell and Alexandra Seros (based on Luc 
              Besson's NIKITA)
Director of Photography Michael Watkins, ASC
Rated R for violence and language</P>
<P>     A lengthy disclaimer is in order here.  I never saw the French
film of which this is evidently a close remake.  While I have seen
several of director John Badham's movies, I have no great feelings
about them, either positive or negative. And I have never seen Bridget
Fonda in a film, nor do I recall seeing many of the other actors before
(I've seen Anne Bancroft, okay?). Nor am I a particularly big
aficionado of the action genre.</P>
<P>     That said, I will tell you that I was eagerly awaiting the release
of this film, simply because I am a great admirer of its director of
photography. I've been watching Michael's TV work for several years and
was anxious to see what he could do with a wide screen and a decent
budget.</P>
<P>     The plot: Bridget Fonda is Maggie, a drug addict who is given a
choice; either accept training as an assassin for an unnamed government
agency, or be executed for a murder she committed. Some choice. She's
trained in dirty work by Gabriel Byrne, and in the niceties of polite
society by Anne Bancroft, then sent out to complete her missions, which
are all quite nicely slam-bang (stunt coordinator Mic Rodgers did the
"Lethal Weapon" series). Things go well for a while, until Maggie falls
in love, develops a conscience, and decides she'd really rather not
kill people for a living.</P>
<P>     Fonda is very good at showing Maggie's transition from feral
street creature to human being with feelings. Byrne manages to be
somehow both cold-blooded and increasingly sympathetic, Bancroft is a
delight as the Miss Manners of the assassin set, Keitel is perfect in a
small but important role as Victor the Cleaner (he cleans up everything
and everyone after the other assassins), and Ferrer turns in another of
his patented Jack-Webb-with-PMS performances. Mulroney, alas, is more
than a little dumb as the love interest. Sharp-eyed viewers will spot
the director as a room service waiter; *really* sharp-eyed viewers will
spot the director of photography as one of the many guys with guns in
the final big shoot-out. Refreshingly, the computers in the movie
(mostly Macs) behave like *real* computers!</P>
<P>     What sets this film apart from others of the genre is that the
woman is the one with the heavy firepower. I'm reminded of the old
saying that Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did, only
backwards and wearing heels; well, here, Bridget Fonda does everything
Arnie, Sly et al do, only in a variety of tight, short dresses and
panty hose (I must admit that impressed *me*).  There is also a greater
emphasis on character development and emotional relationships than in
the average shoot'em-up.  There's actually less gratuitous violence
than I had been led to believe -- less, for example, than LETHAL WEAPON
3.  In other words, to get stereotypical and sexist here, it's a movie
with enough action for a guy, but enough story and emotion that his
girlfriend won't get bored either (my husband agrees with me on this).</P>
<P>     As to the reason I went in the first place, I was indeed well
pleased with the cinematography. It's lovely, stylish, atmospheric,
imaginative, and inventive (much of the opening sequence was shot in
Super 8 anamorphic, for example!), and I'm going to go see the movie
again just to *look* at it now that I won't be distracted by the plot.
It was ... well ... Really Neat.</P>
<P>     In conclusion, POINT OF NO RETURN offers some great action and
nice acting, good direction, effective use of music (score by Hans
Zimmer, many songs by Nina Simone), and awesome camera work. I can
recommend it.</P>
