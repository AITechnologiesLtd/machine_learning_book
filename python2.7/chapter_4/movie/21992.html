<P>Last May I saw "The Limey" at its world premiere in Cannes. I watched 
it again locally seven months later. Now, I have always believed that 
the better understanding and the value or non-value of many a film, 
require a second screening, if possible much later. A major problem 
with most critics is that deadlines allow them to give only their 
first, quick  impressions. With some movies, even more than two 
screenings are called for. Lacking this, my evaluation of "The Limey" 
is still somewhat guarded.</P>
<P>Terence Stamp is Wilson (no first name), a Limey (slang for British) 
petty career criminal just released from his latest, 9-year prison 
stay for armed robbery. He flies from England to Los Angeles to 
investigate the suspicious death (nominally in a car accident) of his 
estranged daughter Jenny.--and to avenge her.</P>
<P>This leads to sleuthing and extreme violence, and to record 
producer/drug dealer tycoon Valentine (Peter Fonda) and his henchmen. 
Jenny was Valentine's girl.</P>
<P>On the face of it, "The Limey" falls in the most familiar sub-genre 
of revenge/retaliation movies which can be found among crime films, 
westerns, war movies and tutti quanti. However, behind this deja vu 
are the novel approach and stylistics of the movie.</P>
<P>>From the very beginning and through the finale, Wilson is a special 
character. Taciturn, unconfiding in others, he speaks economically 
with a Cockney accent and pronunciation (e.g. "I was finking about 
this") yet on at least one occasion he showers his listener (a 
puzzled DEA agent) with a long, vivacious speech in Cockney rhymes.</P>
<P>All along too, the movie bathes in an ocean of flasbacks in every 
possible direction and of every possible type. These include the 
leitmotif of Wilson playing in his head home-movies of Jenny as a 
child, visions of Wilson as a young man, visions of what was, what 
could have been, might have been, may not have been, and so on. It is 
a large puzzle plus non-puzzle of genre deconstruction which may or 
may not confuse the viewer (hence one reason for a third screening of 
the movie).</P>
<P>Throughout, and among all characters, the dialogue is terse,. The 
exceptions involve Valentine rather than Wilson.</P>
<P>Flashes as a stylistic device are the most obvious aspect of the 
film's techniques, yet other procedures are used so that what we 
learn of Wilson (and others) is based on the iceberg principle -- you 
really see or perceive only the tip.</P>
<P>The procedures have been compared to those of the French New Wave and 
to the non-French films they influenced in the 1960s. Indeed, the 
1960s and their ethos, updated  to the late 1990s, are another 
constant here. In clear terms, the two major roles of this movie are 
held by movie icons of the hippie years, with clever twists. Peter 
Fonda (Valentine) was once Wyatt (aka   Captain America), the biker 
(with his pal Dennis Hopper) in the landmark  "Easy Rider" (1969) 
where doing drugs was within a state of strange innocence. Decades 
later, Valentine's drugs then are a savage by-product of capitalism 
at all costs, including human.</P>
<P>A good touch Terence Stamp, in "Billy Budd" (1962)  was a revelation 
as the sweet-faced innocent victim in the eponymous movie. Four films 
later, he had a smallish role as a thief called Wilson in the first 
feature by Ken Loach, "Poor Cow" (1967).</P>
<P>In what may be a first in film history, the flashbacks of "The Limey" 
repeatedly go to the young Stamp-Wilson without any need of faking, 
special effects or a digitally created Stamp.</P>
<P>Both actors, born in 1939, are sexagenerians now. Stamp looks younger 
than his age. Fonda could pass for a young 40-something. He is 
fashionably garbed, is face is unlined, he is seriously preoccupied 
with his looks, checks them (and his gums) with near-obsessive 
frequency. He is also a near-Lolita fancier, but without prurience. 
Jenny has been replaced by Adhara, a young, live-in beauty. We know 
nothing about her beyond her bare minimum, in a bathtub.</P>
<P>We know very little about anyone else, including the interesting 
Avery. He is Valentine's lieutenant, middle-aged, chic and "soigné," 
has authority, delegates the dirty work and looks more like  a 
"consigliere" than a killer. It is characteristic of the movie that 
while, in principle, treading familiar ground, it avoids stereotypes. 
Clichés too but not all.</P>
<P>There is more subtlety around than meets the eye initially. In 
devious, insouciant-seeming ways, Valentine tries to hold on to the 
decorative Adhara by courting and admiring her openly. Beneath his 
sophistication there are crypto-pathetic efforts to impress a lover 
who is a fraction of his age. The girl is impressed --in  fashion 
corresponding to that of young cinephiles today discovering great 
older films-- by the mythical 60s. Yet in a debunking, anti-cliché 
Valentine tells her that the whole 60s thing happened only in 1966 
and the early 1967.</P>
<P>Where the movie does not resist clichés is in its action scenes. 
Wilson is tinged by Superman-ness a la Charles Bronson or Dirty 
Harry. He survives a horrible beating by lowlifes nearly unscathed. 
He then gets his improbably hidden revolver and kills them dead. 
Wilson disposes of a Valentine guard with ease and no witnesses 
during a reception. A car chase gets his pursuer vanquished. A major 
fusillade has the few good guys eliminate the many bad 'uns. The 
finale employs the far too familiar mano a mano between hero and 
arch-villain.</P>
<PRE>A third viewing is in order.</PRE>
