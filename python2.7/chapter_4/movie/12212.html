<PRE>Amateur ***
R,105 m,1994
Isabella Huppert </PRE>
<P>"Amateur" is filled with deadpan humor that might be missed if one isn't 
on the lookout for it. "Amateur" also shows what it is like for a man to 
see himself as others do, and not at all like what he sees.</P>
<P>It opens with a scene of a man laying face down on the street. He comes 
to having no idea of who he is. He is befriended by a woman (Isabella 
Huppert) at a dinner who acts as if she may have just landed on her head, 
as well. He quickly learns that she writes erotic fiction for a living. 
She invites this total stranger to stay at her apartment. (Her trustful-
ness may come from the fact that she has lived in a convent for the last
15 years, something she went ahead and did even after the Mother of Christ
herself appeared to her in a vision and told her not to become a nun.)</P>
<P>Thomas (Martin Donovan) did not fall from the window by accident; he was 
pushed by his wife, the lovely Sophia (Elina Lowensohn). She has had 
enough of him. He got her hooked on drugs at age 12 and used her for his 
porno films. He also tells her that he will disfigure her if she leaves 
him. </P>
<P>Sophia believes he died in the fall and contacts an associate who tells
her that Thomas was trying to blackmail the person fronting the money to 
make the XXX movies. Sophia herself becomes mixed up in this when she
contacts this person about having some floppy disks with delicate 
information on them. Some men are dispatched to find her, the disks, and 
anyone else involved. </P>
<P>One of the striking things is the casualness with which all these 
characters come across. The two men who are sent to get the disks strike 
up a conversation about cell phones right before they are about to torture
the accountant Sophia contacted with a live electrical cord. Sophia also 
manages to retain a childlike innocence, even in the face of such an 
abusive relationship. Isabella and her quest to lose her virginity has an
"it can wait another day" feel to it.</P>
<P>Thomas finds it frustrating that people are so fearful of him when he 
hasn't a clue as to why they should be. Gradually, he discovers that he 
really would rather not know the person who he was and wishes to be 
accepted for who he is now. </P>
<P>The film's eccentric characters keep things interesting as the plot is 
allowed to unfold.</P>
