<PRE>                      THE ADVENTURES OF MILO AND OTIS
                                  (CHATRAN)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     THE ADVENTURES OF MILO AND OTIS (CHATRAN) (1989) is a live action
film staring an orange tabby cat called Milo and a white pug with a
black face called Otis.  Being a person who likes all animals but has
three cats, I was pleased to see the cat get top billing and the best
lines.</P>
<P>     The way to view this picture is to think of the Discovery Channel
nature documentaries.  Now imagine that someone combines various pieces
of film stock so that a story begins to emerge.  To this a narrator is
hired, and, voila, a feature length film is born.  Actually, most of
the scenes are set up, but they seem more nature than in a lot of
animal pictures.  In the English language version, Dudley Moore is the
narrator, and he does all of the voices, but the film, which appears to
have been shot in America, was made by a Japanese crew and was first
released in Japan in 1986 as CHATRAN.</P>
<P>     So what is the plot you ask?  Wrong question.  This is a slice of
animal life picture.  There is not much plot other than the animals
play and slowly grow up.  While growing up they have many natural
adventures with other animals - hedgehogs, chickens, foxes, and even
bears.  To give you an idea of the level of the dialog (Masanori Hata
and Mark Saltzman), Milo tells the hedgehog, "Touch it and your dead
meat," when he looks at the chicken egg Milo has been charged with
guarding.</P>
<P>     The cinematography by Hideo Fujii and Shinji Tomita is lovely.
The music by Ryuichi Sakamoto is effusive.  The music helps in the
scenes that have potentially frightening aspects like the scene with
the bear because they switch to a happy melody like you might hear at a
circus.</P>
<P>     The best part about the film is its star.  Milo is a wonderfully
inquisitive kitty with large and expressive eyes.  The other animals
are also lovable.  The only problem with the show is that there is
almost nothing there.  Granted this is a film aimed at the younger set,
say ages 3-6, but still I would have hoped for more.</P>
<P>     THE ADVENTURES OF MILO AND OTIS runs 1:16 minutes and boredom set
in after about 20 minutes for me.  The film is correctly rated G and
nothing offensive occurs.  The movie would be fine for kids of any age.
Although I can not recommend it, my son Jeffrey (almost 7) said he
liked it.  I give ** for its undeniable sweetness.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
