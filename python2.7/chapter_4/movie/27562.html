<P>   Taking on the theme of "always a wedding planner but
never a bride," Adam Shankman's throwback to sentimental
romances like Taylor Hackford's 1982 adventure "An Officer
and a Gentleman" updated with elements from Mike Newell's
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" has a few things going for it
to make its relative charms at least somewhat tolerable to
viewers.  The principal couple played by Matthew
McConaughey and Jennifer Lopez are pure box office, with a
palpable chemistry and the ability to portray professional
people from different ethnic roots who must overcome
hardships before securing a happy life together.  Julio
Macat's lensing shows us a gorgeous San Francisco,
avoiding the stereotypical hills and trolleys in favor of a more
lived-in town, lived-in, at any rate, by the well-to-do.  But
blatant predictability, a tendency of supporting players to
overact, and a craving of Mervyn Warren's music to pump up
every emotion dooms what could have been as buoyant as a
just-baked wedding cake into just another elaborately nut-
filled but unsatisfying confection.</P>
<P>   From the very opening, Shankman shows us the sort of
work that is done by the titled wedding planner, an assured
hostess who, like a film director for the rich, smoothly
commands her subordinates to assure that each ceremony
runs calmly and gracefully.  Mary Fiore (Jennifer Lopez) darts
about the lavish expanse of one of San Francisco's most
exclusive parlors, even arranging to change the seat of a
guest whose elevated mane gets in the way of the video
camera in much the way movie patrons in non-stadium
theaters block the view of those seated behind them. 
Aspiring to a partnership in a firm run by the goofy Gery
(Kathy Najimy), she is to be rewarded if she can get the
account of wealthy but equally goofy high-tech executive Mr.
Donolly (Charles Kinbrough) and his ditzy, oenephile wife
(Joanna Gleason).  When Mary and a cute pediatrician meet
cute after Dr. Steve Edison (Matthew McConaughey) saves
her from an attack by a wandering dumpster, Mary enjoys a
moment that can be described only as love at first sight. But
since Pamela Falk and Michael Ellis's screenplay abide by
the leading convention of romantic comedies--keep the
principals apart until the very end--we have no trouble
believing that Steve and Mary are destined to remain just
friends as the physician is engaged to the headstrong and
horsey Fran Donolly (Bridget Wilson-Sampras).</P>
<P>   We need not wonder why Jennifer Lopez enjoys the
attention of an extensive fan club.  Emulating Julia Roberts in
the beauty arena, Ms. Lopez's career often features her
mellifluous voice.  This time around, we learn that she is an
accomplished ballroom dancer.  At one point she turns in an
impressive gambol at the tango, a performance for which
McConaughey allegedly needed to rehearse for several
weeks before being released on the ballroom floor for the
cameras.  But even here, our enjoyment of the scene is
impeded by the over-the-top demeanor of Fred Willard as
dance instructor Basil St. Mosely.</P>
<P>   While leaving the theater, an eavesdropper could hear at
least two members of the audience joking that Matthew
McConaughey is the prettiest actor in the movie.  The
versatile, thirty-two year old performer has strutted his stuff in
roles as varied as that of Richard Linklater's "Dazed and
Confused" and Joel Schumacher's adaptation of John
Grisham's "A Time to Kill."  He exudes genuine charm as
opposed to the mock enticements of Judy Greer as Penny,
an assistant to the wedding planner, and the irritating
presence of Calvin Klein model Justin Chambers in the role
of a naive immigrant, Massimo, who is pushed by Mary
Fiore's annoying dad Salvatore (Alex Rocco) to propose to
her.  (Massimo's only knowledge of Mary was in a brief stint
as childhood friends, at which time Massimo recalls "she was
ugly and had no breasts").  "The Wedding Planner" is as
excessive as the haute bourgeois members of the horsey set
and the equally irritating people into whose lives they intrude.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 102 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
