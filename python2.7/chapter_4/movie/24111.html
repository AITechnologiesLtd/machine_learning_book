<PRE>AMERICAN PSYCHO (2000) / ***</PRE>
<P>Directed by Mary Harron. Screenplay by Harron and Guinevere Turner, from
the novel by Bret Easton Ellis. Starring Christian Bale, Chloe Sevigny,
Willem Dafoe. Running time: 102 minutes. Rated R for extreme violence and
graphic sexual content (MFCB). Reviewed on April 17th, 2000.</P>
<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Few movies have engendered such controversy as "American Psycho". Not only
has there been concern over its violent and sexual content, but the 1991
Bret Easton Ellis novel upon which the film is based is notorious for
having been read by Karla Homolka, accomplice of convicted sex murderer
Paul Bernardo.</P>
<P>But those who have sought to censor "American Psycho" have done so with
little merit. This is not a movie about murder per se, and any intelligent
watching of the film should make that obvious. Does the lead character,
Patrick Bateman, kill people? Yes, and the implication is that many more
die off-screen. But this very fact -- that much of Bateman's crime spree
is referred to only in passing -- makes it clear that the movie is less
concerned about his deeds than about Bateman himself.</P>
<P>The killings themselves are alternately comical and dispassionate. There
is none of the frenzied bloodlust of "Natural Born Killers" (another
good film about murderers, but one that is very different in its approach
to the material). In one of the movie's best scenes, for instance, Bateman
is more concerned with keeping his clothes and apartment clean, and with
discussing the merits of Huey Lewis, than with the actual process of
murdering a colleague.</P>
<P>Instead, "American Psycho" works on two levels. First, and most obviously,
it is a character study of Patrick Bateman, a complex and difficult role
played splendidly by Christian Bale. And second, it serves as a scathing
indictment of the 1980s, of the shallow and materialistic values which
were the hallmark of that decade and which still play an all-too-important
role in Western society.</P>
<P>Patrick Bateman is a mid-level executive in his late twenties. His day
seems to consist mostly of "meetings" with other mid-level executives,
which essentially amount to contests of ego (we never actually see them
doing anything work-related). Bragging rights are determined by the
quality of their business cards and their ability to secure reservations
at chic restaurants. Several of them are engaged, but this seems purely
for show; they fool around on one another with only the barest of nods
toward secrecy. Certainly, Bateman's relationship with his own fiancee,
Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon), is cold and loveless. Indeed, Bateman and the
others are so similar that it almost feels as though they have been
churned out on an assembly line. Their slicked-back hairstyles, their
style of dress, their mode of speech -- all are virtually identical. A
running gag is made of the way Bateman is constantly mistaken for others
(he doesn't even bother to correct the error, and just plays along).</P>
<P>But unlike his confreres, Bateman has a secret: he is a murderer, who
has already killed as the movie opens and kills again, many times, over
the course of the picture. "American Psycho" does not concern itself with
the whys of Bateman's psychosis; it is more interested in his mentality
now that he has succumbed to his murderous impulses. Bateman, we learn,
thinks of himself as nothing but an empty, hollow shell, as conveyed
effectively by a number of visuals. Early on, Bateman removes a
transparent moisturizing face mask to reveal the same face underneath:
his flesh hides no further depths. Later, Bateman gazes into a polished
surface, but there is only the barest of reflections. "There is simply
nothing there," he says of himself. Indeed, Bateman does not have a line
of dialogue which is heartfelt or honest. When he does speak, it is simply
to maintain appearances, and it is as though he is regurgitating words
heard or read elsewhere; his favorite subject is popular music, but his
opinions feel lifted out of the latest "Rolling Stone".</P>
<P>Bateman is entirely self-absorbed, seeking to mold the world to his own
preferences without fully committing himself to that world. He instructs
his secretary, Jean (Chloe Sevigny), how to dress, and treats himself with
a litany of body-care products. Indeed, the murders he commits can be seen
as the ultimate extension of this thirst for control. In one telling
scene, Bateman engages in a three-way sex scene with two prostitutes, but
spends the whole time watching his own performance in the mirror; rather
than arousing, the proceedings are perfunctory and emotionless (making it
all the more strange that this was the scene ordered trimmed from the US
release by the MPAA; the Canadian version, fortunately, is unabridged).</P>
<P>"American Psycho" grows increasingly bizarre as the story unfolds. The
reality of the film seems to be influenced by Bateman's own grip on
sanity, and as his psychosis grows, the movie becomes more and more
surreal. Unusually, for a picture with such disturbing subject matter, 
this lends an air of comedy to the whole thing. Some viewers may find this
juxtaposition uncomfortable, but director Mary Harron reaches the right
balance, and the humor only serves to further augment Bateman's dementia.</P>
<P>Apart from Bale's standout performance, none of the other actors are
memorable, mired as they are in vacuous and superficial parts. Willem 
Dafoe occupies a particularly odd role, as a detective investigating one
of Bateman's killings. It seems fairly clear that he knows Bateman is the
murderer, and yet this particular subplot simply peters out. Indeed, some
may take issue with the way the movie as a whole just kind of stops,
rather than reaching some kind of definitive conclusion. But I find it 
hard to take issue with this technique; the movie is, above all else, a
character sketch, and once it has nothing new to say about Patrick
Bateman, it sensibly ends. What kind of ending could "American Psycho"
really have had, without it seeming superfluous?</P>
<P>"American Psycho" is an excellent character piece, marred only by a lack
of supporting material. The look it provides into the mind of a serial
killer is both chilling and sobering -- for, despite Patrick Bateman's
obvious and self-confessed insanity, how far removed is he really from the
rest of us?</P>
<P>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to return some videos.</P>
