<PRE>DEEP RISING</PRE>
<P>I can't imagine what's wrong with my fellow reviewers. Here' the most
entertaining, best put together action film of the last 12 months, and they
trash it. It may be that they were expecting to find Sir Lawrence Olivier
or that they came in yearning for a transcendental experience. Well, to the
gentle readers who go to the movies looking for solid entertainment let it
not be said that in this here newsgroup an encouraging word will not be
heard. </P>
<P>Deep Rising is everything that a full budget
action/adventure/monster/disaster movie should be: an elaborate production,
superb cinematography, flawless casting, very good acting and above all,
that sensitive element in which even Titanic failed and Speed 2 crashed and
sank: pacing. The pace and rhythm of the action is the one critical element
that most often makes or breaks a disaster movie. There is in disaster
movies a point at which "sustained hectic" starts to yield diminishing
benefits quickly followed by negative returns. Titanic transgressed the
line, but not to the egregious degree of Speed 2. Deep Rising achieves near
perfection in this respect. Hectic situations are resolved before they get
boring and the gore is briefly seen but not flaunted. The premise is
internally consistent and the monster will satisfy your expectations. </P>
<P>The characters are one dimensional, perhaps as they should be and who
cares, if the acting is good? (Not at all a contradiction.) And anyway,
Treat Williams does wander into another dimension as you might expect from
such a fine actor. Famke Johnson is a Sandra Bullock look-alike with talent
to match. Kevin O'Connor fine tunes his character with inconspicuous
virtuosity.</P>
<P>That this level of intelligent, thoughtful moviemaking should get trashed
by would-be critics is beyond forgivable. So the dialog is deliberately
simple and direct; it is not Hamlet. All in all it the most satisfactory
flick of its genre to come by in many a month and perhaps in years, the
Alien series not excluded. Don't let my praise raise your expectations to
the level of a great film; it does not try to be that. It tries to be a
satisfying action and adventure film, and it succeeds splendidly. I
recommend it highly. 3 ½ stars out of 5.</P>
