<P>     Who could fail to be awed?  What could be mightier than the coming
together of these two titanic forces of nature?  Was not the day we
heard these two would be paired in HEAT akin to the day we were told
Jack Nicholson was to play the Joker?  Pacino - the top cop; DeNiro the
chief thief.  What could we expect but a cinematic apocalypse of
galactic proportions?</P>
<PRE>     Michael Mann.</PRE>
<P>     Michael Mann must have thought the same thing.  Michael Mann is
the director of HEAT.  He is also its screenwriter.  Michael Mann is
the creator of TV's Miami Vice and the director of several action
movies, including LAST OF THE MOHICANS.  Michael Mann must have said to
himself, "This is going to be my GOODFELLAS.  No.  This is going to be
my GODFATHER.  No this is going to be my GOODFELLAS *and* GODFATHER
rolled into one!"</P>
<P>     Let me begin by saying, Michael Mann is neither Martin Scorcese
nor Francis Ford Coppola.  But I knew that going in.</P>
<P>     The movie started off *fine*.  DeNiro and his crew (which includes
Val Kilmer) knock over an armored car - literally.  It's a brilliantly
hatched and well executed plan.  Pacino arrives on the scene and
catches the scent; the chase is on.  It was what I expected from Mann.</P>
<P>     But then, instead of focusing on the hunt and the heists, he
repeatedly returns to family life scenes concerning Pacino and Kilmer's
characters and an unlikely romance for DeNiro's.  A side plot develops
in which DeNiro's gang makes deals with the guy whose bonds they stole
from the armored car.  More characters are introduced and given
scenes.  Another side plot with a serial killer opens up.  As the
minutes piled up and the footage rolled on, a metronome began ticking
in my head, softly, "dull.....dull.....dull...."</P>
<P>     Don't get me wrong.  There's nothing wrong with a rich plot or
showing a character's family life.  But the bulk of the scenes and the
characters in them were so contrived and the editing so loose and
dragging, I couldn't understand why Mann didn't just stick to the core
story.</P>
<PRE>     Slowly I realized what he was out to do.  He was going
for ... Epic.</PRE>
<P>     Eventually, we come to the bank job.  The screen that had been
quiet almost since the opening, exploded with automatic weapons and
shotguns.  Glass shattered, cars crashed, people screamed.  It's a
great, climactic scene.  A climax you could go home from and say, "That
was a good movie."</P>
<P>     But it wasn't the climax!  It wasn't the end!  HEAT dragged on for
more than an hour afterwards.  I was writhing in my seat.  At one
point, a cop says, "I'm going to get some coffee and we're going to sit
until this thing is over with." I felt like saying, "Get some for me,
too."  As the credits finally rolled, someone behind me muttered, "That
was so long, DeNiro could have gone to prison in the first scene and
finished his sentence before the movie was over."</P>
<P>     The funny thing is that even though Pacino and DeNiro were the
leads in this movie, they shared only three, maybe four scenes.  One of
those scenes was dialogue; the rest were gunplay.  And in all of those
scenes, you never once see both Pacino's and DeNiro's faces on screen
at the same time.  It is entirely conceivable that these two men never
acted together in making this movie.</P>
<P>     I mentioned Val Kilmer as one of the supporting stars in HEAT.
The rest of the supporting cast seems like a list of every performer
ever mentioned on Film Flicks & Video Pix.  There's Tom Sizemore, John
Voigt, William Fichter, Wes Studi (Magua from LAST OF THE MOHICANS and
the title character in GERONIMO), Hank Azaria (of TV's "The Simpsons"),
Ashley Judd, even Henry Rollins and the guy who played the
knife-throwing hit man in DESPERADO.</P>
<P>     HEAT is two minutes of trailer material and 2 hours and 43 minutes
of filler.  It will be left to a future generation to harness the
combined power of Pacino and DeNiro and put it to constructive use for
humanity.</P>
