<P>   Chosen by the Toronto Film Critics' organization as
Canada's best 1999 film and by the Canada Film Board as its
official foreign-language Oscar entry (beating out "Felicia's
Journey"), "Set Me Free" is a coming of age story dealing
with a teen age girl from Quebec who has a Jewish father
and a Catholic mother.  (This may explain the movie's
popularity at the 1999 Jerusalem Film Festival.)  Here is no
run-of-the-mill sample of that popular genre and is light-years
removed from hackneyed American teen comedies like last
year's obtuse and witless "Jawbreaker."  Nor is it of interest
only to the people who are contemporaries of the principal
character.  What makes "Set Me Free" an important
achievement is its universality.  Unlike a slick, but decent,
Hollywood coming-of-age drama like "Girl, Interrupted" which
brought in a targeted audience of Winona Ryder's 20-
something fans,  "Set Me Free" should enchant men and
women alike, teens and eighty-somethings as well.  While we
don't all come from unhappy families like the 13-year-old girl
who wants to be set free to live her own life, most of us have
had experiences that parallel hers.  </P>
<P>   Like the young Hanna (Karine Vanasse), we've endured
adolescent conflicts: we've loved our parents; we've hated
them.  We've enjoyed school; we've dreaded going.  We
tailored ourselves like characters in movies; we changed our
minds when we saw the ill fit.  We were attracted to the
opposite sex; we found greater comfort and warmth within
our own.  High one day; in the dumps the next.  We identified
strongly with our religion; we felt rootless and alienated from
all beliefs.  We've felt our parents' love; we've wondered
whether they knew how to express it.  We wanted to move
out and live with our more understanding grandparents; we
got homesick and moved back with those who gave birth to
us.</P>
<P>   That's a lot of stuff for adolescents to go through.  How we
all survived is testament to our grit.  Lea Pool, who directed
"Set Me Free," jogs our memories.  Yes, she appears to say,
there's no time like youth.  No, she surfaces to say, puberty
is so darn miserable that we don't ever want to repeat those
years.  But why lecture or write a book on adolescent
psychology when you can use the prodigious talents of
Karine Vanasse in the role of Hanna, the 13-year-old
Quebecois whose Jewish father, (Mike Manojlovic) and
Catholic mother (Pascale Bussieres) keep her wondering
"who am I?" and who identifies with her compassionate
teacher (Nancy Huston) and with Anna Karine, the star of
Jean-Luc Godard's 1962 movie "My Life to Live." </P>
<P>   As the film opens on Hanna enjoying a rustic season with
her grandparents, we haven't a clue to the girl's misery.  She
has a broad, contagious smile and loves to horse around with
her Down's Syndrome-affected brother.  Yet like many her
age in the repressive early 1960s, she has no idea what's
happening when she experiences her first period.  Moving
back to Montreal with her folks and a slightly older brother,
Paul (Alexandre Merineau), she runs through a stage of
experimentation with assorted life styles, mimicking the
activities of the actress playing Nana in the Godard film she
has already seen four times and identifying strongly with her
teacher, who bears a strong resemblance to that actress who
became Jean-Luc Godard's wife.</P>
<P>   Hanna lives in Montreal with her brother Paul, her self-
designated poet father who cannot or will not hold a job, and
her depressed and exhausted mother who must come home
from a grueling job as fashion designer to type her husband's
countless unpublished manuscripts.  The rent is unpaid.  Her
dad loves his wife and children but cannot show the love in a
healthy manner.  As a Jew from Poland who survived the
Holocaust, he insists that Hanna pay more attention to her
roots and is quick to slap her when she shows signs of
rebellion.  Hanna finds comfort in another lonely girl, Laura
(Charlotte Christeler), whose sensuality appeals to her, and
most of all in her sympathetic teacher.  She fears, justifiably,
that her mother will attempt suicide and in fact feels
self-destructive herself.  Her financial problems lead her to
pawn whatever she can get her hands on and to join her
brother in shoplifting.  In one instance she is groped in the
back room by a baker, and in another she is propositioned
while walking down a street patronized by hookers.  Hanna
has a way to go before she can emerge from a snarl of
disorienting experiences and to find herself.  We root for her.</P>
<P>   When Hanna is lent a movie camera for the summer by her
teacher, we see that director Pool wants us not only to feel a
kinship with the likable teen but is simultaneously paying
homage to the cinema, especially to the New Wave
movement championed by Jean Luc-Godard, with its
promotion of a more personal style of filmmaking,
independent of slick, studio-based practices.  "Set Me Free"
is just such a film, one which virtually concedes the director's
autobiographical underpinnings.  Free of easy resolutions,
this sincere, heartfelt movie leaves us to ponder Hanna's
future, given the conflicted circumstances of her
impressionable years.</P>
