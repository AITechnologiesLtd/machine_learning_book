<P>Synopsis: Bobby Garfield (Yelchin) lives in a small town with his 
mirthless widowed mother (Hope Davis). Bobby's world revolves around his 
friends, especially the spritely Carol (Boorem). Then one day, a new 
boarder arrives at Bobby's house. Ted Brautigan (Hopkins) is an enigmatic 
man to whom Bobby takes an immediate liking. As the bond between Bobby and 
Ted deepens, Bobby becomes privy to Ted's great secret, an event which 
will change both of their lives forever.</P>
<P>Review: A small but enchanting movie, "Hearts In Atlantis" easily recalls 
another King-inspired coming-of-age film, "Stand By Me", both in terms of 
its setting and the sentiment it conveys. "Hearts" is a tribute to the 
magic of childhood, to those summers when the days seem neverending, and 
nothing means more than your closest friends. Unlike "Stand By Me", there 
is a supernatural element to "Hearts", but although it is key to the plot, 
it is not prominent. Like "Stand By Me", this is a mostly character-driven 
film, and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting. Yelchin is very 
good as Bobby, finding a good mix of innocence and resignation. More 
splendid still is Boorem, whom I praised highly for her work in "Along 
Came A Spider" and who is simply radiant here as Carol. And then there is 
Hopkins, who despite playing such a quiet, introspective character as Ted, 
nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen. Less 
successful is Davis, whose strident Elizabeth comes across as overly 
cartoonish. I also found it odd that Bobby and Carol's other friend, Sully 
(whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device), is 
paid virtually no attention. But Hicks' direction is lovely without being 
cloying, and despite the movie's general lack of incident, it never ceases 
to weave its spell over the audience. </P>
