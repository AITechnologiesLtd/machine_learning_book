<P>    There's a lot of machinery at work in this multigenerational and
multiethnic drama from writer/director/everything else John Sayles
(PASSION FISH, EIGHT MEN OUT).  Set on the Texas side of the Mexican
border, LONE STAR follows Rio County Sheriff Sam Deeds (Chris Cooper,
inexplicably wincing and frowning through the entire thing) as he
attempts to solve a 40-year old murder mystery with apparent ties to
every prominent person in the county, including himself.  Mr. Sayles has
cast, oh, at least a hundred speaking parts in his 135-minute saga and
the confusion over "who's who?" begins early.  (Due, in part, to a weak
sound recording that often renders the dialogue difficult to understand.
How about handing out a program, someone?) The cast is expectedly
diverse and includes Clifton James, Kris Kristofferson, and newcomer
Matthew McConaughey, as well as regular Sayles items Joe Morton and
Elizabeth Pena.  However, as everything about this movie feels so...
over-staged, hardly anyone is given the breathing room to make a
believable impression.  We're presented with volumes of information
about these people, their lives, and their lifestyles, and we couldn't
care less.</P>
