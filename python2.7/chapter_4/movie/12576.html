<P>   Would you believe that disco is dead?  The clubs with long
lines of people who had to beg the bouncers to admit them;
the pulsating music that took the hordes of young far from
their daily troubles; the throbbing rhythms that propelled John
Travolta into stardom with his great film "Saturday Night
Fever," now a mere historical curiosity making way for his
darker, more cynical works.  It's gone the way of the cha cha. 
Or has it?  In the final scene of "The Last Days of Disco,"
writer-director Whit Stillman gets a contemporary subway car
to its feet, passenger by passenger rising to boogie, then an
entire station on the New York transit swinging to the beat.  If
the clubs are boarded up or metamorphosed into shopping
centers filled with stores like P.C. Richard and Kmart, the
music in our minds remains, a lasting tribute to the 1980s
phenomenon that captured youthful hearts and minds
throughout the west.</P>
<P>   "The Last Days of Disco" is part chronicle of the era and
part a witty, albeit all-too-precious focus on a group of
privileged kids who had recently graduated from college. 
They now feel their way in glamorous entry-level positions by
day and more gamboling positions by night.  Some are well-
off thanks to the subsidies they receive from their parents
(who make no appearance); others are struggling to pay the
rent and eager to get ahead in their careers.  But financial
worries take a back seat to their social concerns, about which
they seem ready to talk endlessly like characters in an Eric
Rohmer film when they are not bopping to the beat of such
cadences as "Got to Be Real," "I'm Coming Out" and "I Love
the Nightlife."</P>
<P>   Being liberal arts graduates, they love to talk theory, and
the hypothesis about which they speculate most is the merits
of group social life as opposed to what one post-debutante
considers a ferocious need to pair off.  The female side is
represented by Alice (Chloe Sevigny), a attractive blonde who
may have been too nice while in college and thereby seems
to have missed out on the wilder side of undergraduate life.
She is repeatedly criticized by the sophisticated Charlotte
(Kate Beckinsale), with whom she works in a publishing
house and shares a cramped Manhattan apartment. 
Charlotte, who is nothing if not painfully honest, cautions
Chloe that everyone in college hated her for being critical,
and in a purported wish to have her get ahead with young
men advises her to throw the word "sexy" into her
conversations with them.  Holly (Tara Subkoff), the third
roommate, is also quite attractive, and is used as a plot
device simply to create a more crowded atmosphere in the
railroad apartment the three divide.</P>
<P>   On the male side Des (Chris Eigeman) has the role of an
assistant manager of a disco, one who is criticized by the
bouncer for allowing his friends to sneak into the club via a
back door.  Des claims to be gay and believes that he is, but
he is kidding himself.  Jimmy (Mackenzie Astin) is an ad exec,
one of those who must be ushered into the club clandestinely
since the boss, Bernice (David Thornton), has a peculiar
antipathy toward ad people.  Tom (Robert Sean Leonard) has
been dating Alice, who likes him because he is "serious about
the environment" while Josh (Matt Keeslar), an assistant D.A.,
has a conflict of interest problem from his acquaintance with a
man he is investigating.</P>
<P>   While you need not have seen director Stillman's previous
two films to understand this one, it's helpful to know that the
director continues to pursue accounts of upper-crust young
people who, despite their wit and clever repartee are
nonetheless feeling their way through their professional and
social roles in a fog like the rest of us.  Stillman's
"Metropolitan," made eight years ago, focuses on debutantes
who haven't yet come out--they're still preppies with a way of
life others may envy; while his middle offering, "Barcelona,"
centers on a nerdy American businessman living in Spain who
is joined by his Naval officer cousin as they go off to court the
local assortment of women.  </P>
<P>   Offbeat as always, the talk in "The Last Days of Disco" will
be appreciated principally--perhaps only--by those who recall
the mixed joys of their youthful days: the bull sessions in
college, the networking, the complexities of dating and social
hijinx that result from clashes within a tight circle of friends
and associates.  We learn quite a bit about the politics of the
clubs, especially the need for junior execs and sales
consultants to get their clients into the disco clubs just as
companies make sure nowadays to find the best Broadway
seats for their lucrative accounts.  Those who recall the
sophomoric discussions of more academic times will find the
exchange which deconstructs Disney's "The Lady and the
Tramp" especially amusing.  Pseudo-philosophic one-liners
abound such as Des's query, "Shakespeare says 'To thine
own self be true,' by what if your self is not so great?"  Alice's
innocence comes across convincingly when she asks her
current beau whether she can consider herself a virgin if no
segment of her partner penetrated her, and we get collectively
disgusted when this current boy friend, Tom (Robert Sean
Leonard), tells her off for sleeping with him so quickly: "I'm
sick of everyone's having sex on her mind--it lowers the I.Q." 
(This is the very person who pontificates on the rise of the
environmental movement, which "began when Bambi's mother
was shot by hunters.")</P>
<P>   The fun cast and Stillman's clever writing make this
admittedly slow-moving and talky film a pleasure to listen to
and lovely to look at.  In this age of "Godzilla," we should
genuflect to works like this which are smart, witty and incisive,
films which combine insight into social history with humor and
linguistic grace.  What more can you say when you reminisce
about the eighties--or for that matter the seventies and sixties-
-except that those were the days my friend, we thought they'd
never end. Rated R.  Running time: 109 minutes.  (C) Harvey
