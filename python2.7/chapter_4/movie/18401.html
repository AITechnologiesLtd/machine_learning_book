<P>OCTOBER SKY
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)
Universal / 1:48 / 1999 / PG (minor langauge)
Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal; Chris Cooper; Chris Owen; William Lee Scott; Chad 
Lindberg; Natalie Canerday; Laura Dern; Scott Miles; Chris Ellis 
Director: Joe Johnston 
Screenplay: Lewis Colick<HR>A film full of treasures small but bountiful, "October Sky" proves the 
"based on a true story" title card isn't always indicative of 
TV-flicks-of-the-week and big-screen releases that should've been 
relegated to the small one. This dramatization of events that transpired 
in a West Virginia mining town during the 1950s' so-called Space Race 
miraculously avoids the corny, heavy-handed pitfalls of its 
afore-mentioned cousins. It also confirms - often simultaneously - the 
immensely favorable pre-release buzz generated by several recent 
national sneak previews and advance critical blurbs comparing it to the 
likes of "Field of Dreams."</P>
<P>Talk about a movie having its cake and eating it, too. Said hype had 
"October Sky" pegged as "inspirational" and "uplifting," and it turns 
out that neither adjective is a misnomer. This is probably because the 
tale's factual roots - taken straight from Homer Hickam's autobiography 
"Rocket Boys" - have been unexpectedly maintained in a genre fond of 
pounding narratives into predictable, cliche-littered schmaltz. That's 
not to say every story development is unexpected and every character is 
a complete original, but the magic in "October Sky" stems from how these 
seemingly straight-from-stock situations and supporting roles are 
treated: humanely. </P>
<P>The year is 1957 and high school-aged Homer (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) 
is pretty much stuck on an adamantly preordained path in the footsteps 
of his mine superintendent dad ("Lone Star"'s Chris Cooper), a 
stone-faced type with a soot-stained legacy he feels Homer must 
continue. But when Homer spies the Soviet satellite Sputnik passing 
overhead on its historical orbit, a passion for science is awakened - a 
passion that puts him at odds with his direly disappointed pop. 
Nevertheless, Homer recruits two pals (William Lee Scott and Chad 
Lindberg) and the class nerd (Chris Owen) to help him in his own 
rocket-building missions. </P>
<P>This father figure is where "October Sky" begins to depart from the 
expected route of coming-of-age stereotypes. In such films, the 
authoritative parent usually exists only to provide resistance to the 
protagonist's aspirations, but Cooper and screenwriter Lewis Colick 
essay a distinct individual whose reluctance to accept his son's chosen 
path is entirely believable. Gyllenhaal is just as vital to "Sky"'s 
success, so full of unactorly charm and candor that he makes Homer's 
wonder and eventual heartbreak immediately palpable. And as Homer's 
sweet mama, newcomer Natalie Canerday is so natural in her scenes that 
it's hard to believe she's not the real thing. </P>
<P>Speaking of authenticity, "October Sky"'s final reel gets a little 
crowded with several extraneous subplots - like the illness of Homer's 
encouraging teacher (effective Laura Dern) - but atoning for the 
quick-to-shift focus is that each actually had a hand in shaping an 
array of lives. Even furthering the impact is a concluding montage of 
grainy home movies from the '50s, providing glimpses of the cast's 
in-the-flesh counterparts and updates on where they are now. Some are 
sad and some are surprising, but none is more fitting than the road 
traveled by Homer Hickam. No fair spoiling it if you already don't know, 
but here's a hint: The sky's the limit. <HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck

"Disaster movies always have little vignettes of everyday life. The 
dumbest in ‘Armageddon' involves two Japanese tourists in a New York 
taxi. After meteors turn an entire street into a flaming wasteland, the 
woman complains, ‘I want to go shopping!' I hope in Japan that line is 
redubbed as ‘Nothing can save us but Gamera!'" -Roger Ebert on 
"Armageddon"</P>
