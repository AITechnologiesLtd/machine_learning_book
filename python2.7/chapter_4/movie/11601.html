<PRE>THE REAL BLONDE
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        In the James Bond film "Diamonds Are Forever," Tiffany Case asks
007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads.  Bond's response is that it
doesn't really matter, as long as collars and cuffs match.</P>
<P>        Well, collars and cuffs don't match in "The Real Blonde."  What
might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny, meandering
comedy on screen.</P>
<P>        The film, supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas
and the modeling business, is wafer thin.  It plays like an "Ally McBeal"
episode dragged out to the nth degree, replete with a few unnecessary
"fantasy" sequences.  Writer/director Tom DiCillo manages the material as
if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea.  It isn't.  The only
surprise here is that the talented DiCillo could make familiar terrain so
dreary.</P>
<P>        Matthew Modine plays Joe, a struggling actor waiting tables in
order to pay the rent.  He's 35 with no agent and no credits since he's too
proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas.  "That's not really
acting" he tells his girlfriend of six years, Mary (Catherine Keener), with
whom he bickers constantly about sex.  But they need the money, so Joe
finally agrees to take a part in a Madonna video.  But it's not really
Madonna starring in the video but a lookalike (played by Elizabeth Berkley,
still trying to jump-start her career after "Showgirls").  This points out
how artificial this whole business is, one supposes.</P>
<P>        DiCillo has referred to "The Real Blonde" as "off-kilter, but an
interesting combination of all sorts of stuff..."  The film, which wanders
all over the place without getting anywhere, is remarkably *on*-kilter and,
with perhaps the single exception of the always-likable Modine (who's not
afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by
hunks), the entire cast is vague and uninteresting.</P>
<P>        Catherine Keener, who's appeared in DiCillo's previous three films
(including the brilliant "Living In Oblivion"), is at her most annoying in
"The Real Blonde."  Look at her closely; she really can't act at all.  Her
reactions are all wrong, almost always out of sync with her co-stars.  She
reacts too soon, or too late, to lines and situations.  She moves her eyes,
or her mouth, far too much.  She frowns, she yells, she babbles--she blows
chunks.</P>
<P>        Maxwell Caulfield plays Joe's actor/waiter buddy Bob, the one
obsessed with dating a "natural" blonde.  Bob's personality (not to mention
Caulfield's acting ability) parallels that of the character he plays on the
soap opera "Passion Crest"--stiff and uninteresting.  Maybe that's the
point.  Daryl Hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the
title, a soap dish who beds Bob both on- and off-camera.  Hannah looks
about fifty in this movie (she's only 37).  Why is that?  Almost all the
women in the film wear tops that show their nipples.  WHY IS THAT!?  Marlo
Thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer.  Kathleen Turner plays
an uninteresting talent agent.  Buck Henry plays an uninteresting shrink.
Christopher Lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer.  And so on.</P>
<P>        The best parts of the "The Real Blonde" are the beginning and the
end, brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog.
There's more depth and sincerity in a single close-up of her expressive
face than in the entire film.  While this contrast is supposedly meant to
highlight the shallowness of the other characters' lives, the only thing
that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it's funny.</P>
<PRE>        As blondes go, Tom DiCillo's latest is a really dumb one.</PRE>
