<PRE>`Very Bad Things' is a Very Bad Movie
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>I guess that if a very wild bachelor party had gone really bad, there
would be broken furniture, traces of smack and cocaine on the floor,
and a dead prostitute in the bathroom.  I guess that if a movie had
also gone really bad, there might be the same elements present. 
Coincidence?</P>
<P>Poor Kyle (a meek looking Jon Favreau)...he is about to marry his
radiant fiancee, Laura (Cameron Diaz).  But before he exchanges his
vows, he embarks to Las Vegas with his friends for one last blowout. 
But this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly
get.   The prostitute has met a horrible, though accidental death, and
drugs are everywhere.  The five friends agree that there is enough bad
evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time.  A
surprisingly calm Robert Boyd (Christian Slater), who looks like he
was groomed to make nefarious decisions, ponders their dilemma for a
few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the
body in the desert where she'll never be found.  Although they stomach
the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body (which also disturbingly
involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it
into suitcases), when they return from their trip, guilt and paranoia
begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends.  One
is Adam (Daniel Stern)  He grows increasingly agitated.  Whenever
people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way, his blood
pressure increases.  Or that just may be because of his dysfunctional
family.  Another is Michael, who was actually responsible for her
death.  He tries to bury his feelings, but the burden of guilt begins
to affect his judgment as well.  Boyd is the ‘doer' of the group. 
Seemingly suffering from a long psychosis, when he feels as if his
secret is about to be exposed, he is apt to take extreme measures to
cover up his tracks.  Kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to
Laura's demanding expectations.  Then, there's Moore (Leland Orser)
who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face.</P>
<P>The problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a
cruel comedy, but it presents things in a manner that just aren't
funny.  Drugs, mutilation, and killing your own friends isn't
something to be laughed at.  As a straight psychological drama, I
could see how it might have worked, as each one tried to maneuver and
overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimes-sick
ways.  But this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply
discard our values for 2 hours.   If you do like this movie, I don't
think that I want to know you.  I did find Slater a convincing  leader
who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the ‘smart
play.'  And Diaz adds some brightness to this film as a
wedding-needing fiancee.  But her talents are essentially wasted here.
 It's obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone. 
But the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless.  Do not make a very
bad decision by seeing this film.</P>
