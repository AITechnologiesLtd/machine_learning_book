<P>        No mayor can ever be liked by everybody, especially the mayor of 
New York City.  No matter what services he claims to have brought to the 
city, there is always something behind him to make him corrupt.  CITY 
HALL tries to paint a portrait of the perfect mayor, but winds up falling 
short.</P>
<P>        One rainy afternoon in Brooklyn, on the corner of Broadway and 
Marcy, a detective meets up with a mob screw up that he tried to put away 
two years ago.  Something goes wrong, bullets fly, the cop and the 
mobster lie dead, and a six year old is caught in the crossfire.  Whose 
bullet hits him is a little ambiguous, but watch closely and you'll know.</P>
<P>        News in the city travels fast.  Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John 
Cusack) learns from an aid of the incident and cuts the Mayor's (Al 
Pacino) speech short.  Calhoun is down home boy from Louisiana spouting 
quotes from Huey Long and Harry S Truman, only trying to do what is right 
and find the truth.  He idolizes the Mayor, John Pappas, Time cover man, 
and one of the finest mayors ever to grace this office with his 
presence.  Together, they start a crusade to find out why these killings 
took place.</P>
<P>        Along the way, Calhoun runs into Marybeth Cogan, a lawyer 
assigned to protect the widow and her chances of receiving her husband's 
pension.  She believes that Calhoun is out to tarnish his name and expose 
him as corrupt.  They make an unlikely pair that should have no romantic 
spark.  Well, the writers couldn't resist at the end in one of the lamest 
conclusions I have seen in a while.  Can you say reshoots after poor test 
showings?  Together, these two become detectives doing police work that 
should be left to IA, but they seem to only have one moment of 
brilliance.  The rest is left up to Calhoun and Cogan, which in and of 
itself is hard to swallow.</P>
<P>        CITY HALL remains almost too ambiguous at times.  For the normal 
American audience, many people are going to be confused as to why there 
are so many twists and turns, and where are they all leads.  A central 
theme to this film is that when one doors closes, another one opens, or 
rather, the other way around.  Unfortunately, from the beginning, the 
audience knows something is wrong, but each twist could result in a dead 
end at the answer.  The film continues to plow through its own dead ends.</P>
<P>        The biggest problem with this film is the screenplay.  Cusack 
turns in a strong performance, much improved since his days as a high 
school slack in BETTER OFF DEAD and ONE CRAZY SUMMER.  His potential from 
SAY ANYTHING is coming into fruition.  Al Pacino plays Al Pacino, and one 
wonders if the audiences will ever tire of him.  Bridget Fonda smiles 
nicely, and bobs her hair, that's about it.  Upon closer examination, 
however, there is a reason why the credits do not precede this film.  
Four separate writers are credited with penning this script:  newcomer 
Ken Lipper, Bo Goldman (SCENT OF A WOMAN), Nicholas Pileggi (GOODFELLAS, 
CASINO), and Paul Schrader (TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL).  Three well known 
writers on a not-so-worthy script.  If I had to guess, I'd say that 
Lipper wrote it, and the studio saw potential, so they passed it from 
one hand to the next.  Their strategy did not pay off.  This film was 
supposed to arrive in theatres in December, but the studio pulled out, 
exposing their lack of confidence in this film among the holiday 
competition.  The plot lines do not weave a complete story, but run 
parallel instead.  One character says it best, "The sweater unravels."</P>
<P>        For Cusack's performance alone, it might be worth a look, but I 
have reservations.  This is not Pacino's best, and Bridget Fonda has 
still not found her breakout role, if it ever comes.  But, CITY HALL is a 
worthy rental, so save the $7, and spend the $3 in a few months.</P>
