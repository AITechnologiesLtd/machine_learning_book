<PRE>THREESOME (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Tastes and morals may change, but one thing remains the same
throughout history - among all works of art the most
controversial ones are those that explore how far a human
being can go before he/she reaches happiness. Since that
happiness often corresponds with active love life,
controversy often comes from the depiction of sexuality -
either unconventional display of sexuality or display of
unconventional forms of sexuality. Interestingly enough,
THREESOME, 1994 romantic drama by Andrew Fleming, hardly
caused any controversy despite satisfying both of
aforementioned criteria.</P>
<P>The plot takes place on unnamed American college where shy,
bookwormish student Eddy (played by Josh Charles) shares two
thirds of dormitory suite with Stuart (played by Stephen
Baldwin), typical jock. Two of them, despite differences in
character and views on world, become best friend, but their
relationship becomes complicated when, due to bureacratic
mistake, remaining third of their suite gets occupied by a
female student, Alex (played by Lara Flynn Boyle). Soon it
becomes apparent that Alex rejects all Stuart's advances in
favour of Eddy, who, to his utmost horror, starts realising
that he is being attracted to Stuart. However, despite
triple case of unrequited love, all three become great
friends and enjoy time with each other. But the unresolved
sexual tension is still present and threatens their unusual
relationship.</P>
<P>THREESOME didn't cause much of a controversy because it was
made during the zenith of "political correctness" when
homosexual desires as integral part of love triangle didn't
look as shocking as in previous eras. Furthermore, this film
at first glance didn't look very different from the standard
romantic comedies from Hollywood and for many the unusual
love triangle was nothing more than "high concept" for
formulaic and predictable Hollywood product. However,
writer-director Fleming approached this farcical situation
with a great deal of seriousness. There are some truly funny
moments in this film, but THREESOME is melodrama in its
nature, obviously inspired by Truffaut's classic JULES ET
JIM (which is explicitly referenced in this film), and
Fleming is not afraid to counter mostly benign humour with
some darker overtones in the plot. The actors who appeared
in this film seemed perfect for the part - Josh Charles is
very good in his role, while Stephen Baldwin plays very
convincing jock. Lara Flynn Boyle is also very good as the
only female in this triangle and plays her role with a lot
of natural ease, which wasn't such easy thing do considering
that she had to appear not only naked in front of camera,
but also to play love scene that features certain sexual
activity that used to belong only in the domain of X-rated
movies. The ending of this film, however, seems somewhat
forced and diminshes generally good impression of this film.
However, even when the novelty of its basic premise wears
off, THREESOME is still going to be interesting and
entertaining movie experience.</P>
