ROUGE (director: Stanley Kwan; cast: Anita Mui (Fleur), Alex Man (Yuen),
Emily Chu (Ah Chor), Leslie Cheung (Chan Chen-Pang), 1988-Hong Kong)</P>
<P>This is a visually appealing Hong Kong ghost story film, that is highly
stylized, told from the perspective of a courtesan, Anita Mui (Fleur),
who committed suicide with an over-dose of opium and sleeping pills,
also giving the deadly dosage to her unsuspecting male suitor, Leslie
Cheung (Chan Chen-Pang), in 1934, when his wealthy parents would not
allow him to marry her, cutting him off from the family wealth because
he refused to stop seeing her. Her plan was, that she would rather be
with her lover in hell, then to not be with him in this world. Things
didn't work out though, as she never met him in hell, having no way of
knowing that he survived. We now see her as a wraith in a modern and
thoroughly changed Hong Kong, a place that leaves her confused as she
tries to contemplate the different changes in the city 50- years later,
as she enters a newspaper ad office, hoping to place an ad in the paper
to locate master 12, as she once called him, believing that he is now
reincarnated in this world.</P>
<P>The film is evocative, its strength lying mostly in its poetical
presentation, as it masterfully weaves a visual work of great scope.The
essence of the story does not depend on whether you believe in ghosts or
not, though it would help if you could not be entirely reluctant to
accept the possiblity that there could be life-after death, as the
film's main story, is based on the knowledge that everything in life is
transitory, that even love is questionable when thought of in eternal
terms.</P>
<P>Fleur, still dressed as a 1930s courtesan would be dressed, appears out
of place in this modern capitalistic society, that has forgotten not
only its ancient roots, but its recent past. She befriends the perplexed
young head of the ad office, Alex Man (Yuen), who becomes frightened
when she follows him home after work and he realizes that she is not
human. He is, only, too human, living with his cute girlfriend Emily Chu
(Ah Chor), who is a reporter on the newspaper. When Yuen tells her he
took this strange woman back to their place, she is jealous, then her
curiosity gets the better of her when she examines her and discovers
Fleur does not have a heartbeat. She listens to her story and, thereby,
agrees to help Fleur track down her missing lover, though she has
horrible feelings about what Fleur did, not believing suicide is needed
as a proof for love.  The contrasts between old and new Hong Kong is
accomplished in a very revealing manner, as the young couple come to
look at their relationship in a deeper way than they ever had before,
and look back on a Hong Kong that no longer exists with the help of
their ghostly guide.</P>
<P>This film fascinated me on many levels, but mainly, it made me wonder
about unfulfilled expectations in this world and how the netherworld
could really exist as a domain for such things that remain unresolved.
It questioned what it is one really believes in and how easy it is to
stray away from what one believes in. It allows us the opportunity to
ask ourselves, if we can really believe in spiritual things without
being spiritual ? Can love be so enduring ? Is there something worth
dying for ?</P>
<P>This is truly one of the best films to come out of Hong Kong in the
modern era. Even its ironical ending, is handled with great dignity and
care. Even if you are not convinced by the logic of this super-natural
tale, the beauty of its characterization is enough to make up for any
shortcomings you might have thought this film had, such as the
improbability of such vivid ghosts being so openly seen by everyone,
after all, you should make allowances for the fact that these are not
the Shakespearian ones we might be more culturally receptive towards.</P>
