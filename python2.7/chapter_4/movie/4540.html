<P>     EYE FOR AN EYE, the latest from director John Schlesinger (MIDNIGHT 
COWBOY, SUNDAY, BLOODY SUNDAY), opens with a promising, if disturbing, 
premise:  a woman stuck in traffic hears the rape and murder of her 
teenage daughter over a cellular phone.  This is the kind of incident 
that can cause a complete psychological collapse, but the script isn't 
interested in real drama.  And, when the killer gets off on a contrived 
technicality, EYE FOR AN EYE doesn't ask many tough moral questions, and 
those few it does pose, it has no intention of really addressing.  This 
is a misfired attempt to create a new THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE-
type thriller, not an examination of psychological and emotional trauma.  
The result is as fundamentally distasteful as last year's THE TIE THAT 
BINDS.</P>
<P>     The McCanns are a happy, middle-class American family:  parents 
Karen (Sally Field) and Mack (Ed Harris), 15-year old daughter Julie 
(Olivia Burnette), and little girl Megan (Alexandra Kyle).  One morning, 
everything is perfect, but by nightfall, it has turned to a nightmare.  
A psycho-sicko deliveryman named Doob (Kiefer Sutherland) rapes and 
murders Julie while her mother listens helplessly on a car phone.  After 
being arrested, the killer is let go because of an improper procedure on 
the part of the DA.  Doob promptly begins stalking another woman and 
making threatening advances towards Megan.  Karen, convinced that 
justice is impotent, takes measures of her own, including obtaining a 
gun and learning how to use it.  Then, with the aid of two vigilantes, 
she plans her retribution, Old Testament style.</P>
<P>     A solid cast doesn't always equate to a good movie, as EYE FOR AN 
EYE demonstrates.  Sally Field, Ed Harris, Kiefer Sutherland, and Ed 
Harris are all accomplished actors, but their performances here are 
adequate at best.  (And who can blame them, given the low quality of the 
material?)  Sutherland is especially shortchanged by his character, a 
lunatic nasty with no redeemable or human qualities whose sole purpose 
is to be hated by the audience.  For EYE TO AN EYE to work on its own 
least-common-denominator terms, this is necessary.</P>
<P>     The longer the film runs, the more preposterous the story becomes, 
abandoning any sort of semblance of reality in favor of the ultimate 
revenge scenario.  EYE FOR AN EYE forces its way towards an inevitable 
conclusion.  It's not believable, but it is predictable, and that's 
exactly what a thoroughly manipulated audience will want at that point.  
Does it take much savvy to guess which character is going to get their 
just desserts in the movie's final reel?</P>
<P>     EYE FOR AN EYE is one of three pictures currently in theaters about 
parents coping with the deaths of children.  Both of the others, THE 
CROSSING GUARD and DEAD MEN WALKING, are vastly superior, and the 
latter, a thoughtful examination of some of the same issues that drive 
this film, makes EYE FOR AN EYE look like puerile rubbish.  Despite 
paying lip service to high ideals, Schlesinger's movie has no moral 
compass, and is only interested in delivering cheap thrills.  And, while 
there's a place for that in movies, appropriating this particular 
storyline for such a base intention feels uncomfortably like a 
defilement.</P>
