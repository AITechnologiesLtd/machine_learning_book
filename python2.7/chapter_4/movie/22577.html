<P>`Run Lola Run', a German import that gained a stellar reputation at the
Sundance Film Festival, is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with
the subjects of fate and chance. For a berserk and retroactive 81
minutes of non-stop movement, we follow a fiery-haired heroine named
Lola (Franka Potente) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the
clutches of drug dealers. Lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow
retrieve 100,000 marks in time to save Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) from
being killed by the dealer. But, in something of a pseudo- `Groundhog
Day' approach, director Tom Tykwer gives Lola three separate chances to
best navigate her way toward the goal. In these trio of episodes, we
gradually learn the unique effects of fate, for even if tiny changes are
made in Lola's journey, the future can be seriously altered.</P>
<P>`Run Lola Run' is an experience like `Fight Club' or `The Matrix', in
that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending
reality in surreal and exciting ways. In addition, all three movies have
a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack. `Lola' is
no exception, with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography
that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go. Tykwer's world
is a landscape of mood and color, with brilliant shades of red and pink
(including Lola's fiery hair) used as effective symbolism throughout.
With it's visual style and mind-blowing pace, `Run Lola Run' is one of
the more invigorating movies of the year. Even more so when considering
the fact it's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time
period.</P>
<P>As a heroine, Potente does little more than run wildly through the
streets (as the title suggests), but she has a certain flair and
charisma. Her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a
track star. Meanwhile, Bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of
bringing the dopey but passionate Manni to life. Both actors perform
beyond the call of duty. The dazzling fun comes from predicting what
each episode holds in store for Lola, and the outcome is ultimately
rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected. The
other characters Lola runs into (both purposely and inadvertently)
include her banker father (Herbert Kraup) and a friendly security guard
(Armin Rohde), but aside from the two leads, no one has more than a few
minutes of screen time. Additional stars that couldn't possibly be
ignored are cinematographer Frank Griebe and editor Mathilde Bonnefroy,
who are both responsible for the film's eye-catching visual elegance.</P>
<P>`Run Lola Run' is subtitled, so be prepared to meet the challenge of
reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are
especially fast. This is only one of the minor chores involved in
watching. The other is the sense that we never get to really recognize
who the real people are in this hyperactive situation. Most are just
chess pieces in Tykwer's elaborate game of visual presentation, and he
never really makes a significant move with any. But, the average viewer
is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack
of potency in a few elements of the screenplay. A few petty gripes
aside, this film is a wild, exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on
its wheel of originality.</P>
<P>Most people believe foreign films are mainly boring, talky character
studies. Perhaps `Run Lola Run' will recharge their batteries. Not only
does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and
destiny, it also delivers a white-knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of
overwhelming audacity. Like how the experience must have been for the
persistent title character, `Run Lola Run' is exhausting.</P>
