<PRE>SOUND AND FURY
A film review by James Brundage

<P>        While we continue to watch the Michael Crichton take on the cochlear
implant-kitsch on E.R., some people are actually dealing with the issue
rather than racking up ratings.  One of these people is director Josh
Aronson, ex-still photographer and now-documentarian whose latest, Sound
and Fury, takes on the should-they-or-shouldn't-they issue of the use of
cochlear implantation to restore hearing.</P>
<P>        For some background on the subject, a cochlear implant is, in
simplistic terminology, a cure for deafness.  If implanted into a child
with hearing loss at an early age, there is no reason that the child
cannot live a "normal" life.  So, as many people who enter into the
theatre asked themselves, what is the issue?</P>
<P>        Well, for those who do not know deaf people, there is an entire "deaf
culture."  This culture uses American Sign Language, not lip reading, as
its official language, and takes comfort in the fact that its members
are composed entirely of the minority of the deaf.  Like many minority
cultures composed of people with disabilities, a psychological
self-defense mechanism makes the disability into an improvement.  A deaf
man might say, "Because I cannot hear, I do not have to deal with the
distractions of noise."</P>
<P>        This same phenomenon is also found in the mentally ill, and, although
it sounds ridiculous in the eyes of the layperson (why not fix something
that is broken?), for people who have grown up being deaf, it is an
accusation to say that deafness is wrong… and that is at the heart of
Sound and Fury.</P>
<P>        Sound and Fury examines two Long Island families, one composed of
hearing parents who have just given birth to a deaf child, the other
(the in-laws) composed entirely of deaf people.  Both are considering
implanting their youngest child, and both have to deal with what that
means to their respective cultures.  Through countless interviews, with
doctors, with the parents, and with other deaf families, the issue is
examined objectively until each of the decisions are made, and, although
such a process might come across as long and tedious, it strikes the
viewer as an incredibly emotional ordeal that eventually tears both
families apart.</P>
<P>        Sound and Fury is informative, well edited, and absolutely
heartbreaking to watch, yet it does have a certain sensationalism around
it.  One wonders, watching the film, about the ethics of a filmmaker
seeking to document a family in trouble.  As the filmmaker tells of how
he received notice of the families and politely asked if he could
document their choices, you ask yourself if he knew the way the chips
were going to fall.  Still, his own ethics should not get in the way of
stating the simple truth: that Sound and Fury is probably the most
informative film on cochlear implants and on deaf culture that one could
ever hope to see.</P>
