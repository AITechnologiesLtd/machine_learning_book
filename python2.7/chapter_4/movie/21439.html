<P>"The future is as screwed up as the past."</P>
<P>Starring Lazar Ristovski. Not Rated (the equivalent of a strong R, for
gory violence and an explicit sex scene).</P>
<P>Goodbye, 20th Century is one of only six films produced in the Republic
of Macedonia. It's the only one of the six that I have seen and it
hasn't made me especially eager to see more. It's a frenetic,
nonsensical doo-hickey of a science fiction movie that makes no effort
to be at all coherent and, as such, is a big mess. It's utterly
pointless -- or maybe it's just me. Either way, I'm at a loss.</P>
<P>The film is composed of three vignettes. The first plays like a
pornographic Tuck Everlasting. In a post-apocalyptic society, a man is
condemned to eternal life until he frees himself of the curse by having
sex with his sister. Or something. The second is brief and is "set" at
the end of the 19th century. This one might have something to do with
someone marrying his own sister. Or something. The last one concerns a
deranged Santa Claus on New Year's Eve 1999 and ends in a bloodbath and
the words "Goodbye, 20th Century!"</P>
<P>Or something. I don't know. Maybe it would have all become clearer on
repeat viewing, but I wasn't going to go through that. The fact of the
matter is, to a one-time viewer not familiar with Macedonian cinema,
Goodbye, 20th Century makes absolutely no sense. Lines and characters
seem to come out of nowhere, without any apparent thought behind them.
The running theme of incest is at best curious and at worst repulsive;
either way, why it's there remains a mystery. The film also tries to
interweave the three stories, but the result is even more disjointed.
There may well be some ideas brimming underneath the surface here, in
which case they simply never see the light of day.</P>
<P>>From a purely technical perspective, this is a reasonably well-made
movie. Action scenes are filmed with an effectively surrealistic style
and there is enough deft camerawork to justify the filmmakers being in
the business. The sets are gorgeously bleak and they don't reek of a
low budget. I also like the way the film's finale was staged and
filmed, though I didn't really understand that either. Goodbye, 20th
Century has enough visual panache that, if coupled with a good plot,
which it is laughing, it would be a fair contender for the Best Foreign
Film Oscar this year.</P>
<P>I can't help but think that there was something profound that directors
Darko Mitrevski and Aleksandar Popovski were trying to tell us here. If
only I knew what it was. Before I can perceive understated messages I
have to at least get a jist of the main story line and with this film I
wasn't even fully successful there. In fact, nobody can be expected to
understand the theme of a movie before they figure out what it is
about. That should be the #1 piece of advice at film schools everywhere.</P>
<P>There is no way I can completely dismiss this film considering its
technical proficiency and the nagging possibility that, um, I didn't
get it. But my argument stands: to most American filmgoers, Goodbye,
20th Century will remain a mystery. The story never came together
sufficiently to work on any level other than the visual.</P>
