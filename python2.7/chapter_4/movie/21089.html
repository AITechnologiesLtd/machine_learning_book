<PRE>Three Kings</PRE>
<PRE>A Review</PRE>
<PRE>By Jeremiah Rickert</PRE>
<P>Starring: George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, Spike Jonze, and Nora
Dunn
Written and Directed by: David O. Russel w/John Ridley</P>
<P>     The advertising for this film would have you believe that you are
about to see a caper-film.  The ads portray the kind of talky disco
swagger that we have come to associate with the films of Quentin
Tarantino.  Tarantino's films, however disjointed on the surface, still
contained a linear narrative to follow.  Three Kings never finds this
straight line, and instead is a very schizoid, music-video of a film
that never really finds its own place or purpose.  At the end, the
single biggest thought that crossed my mind was, what did I just see?
Was it a drama, comedy, action adventure, caper-film, political
statement, what was it?  My only answer was that it is a film that
people praise because they don't have any idea what else to say about
it.  Now that just about every major reviewer in the country has raved
about it, those who thought the movie was so much artistic vomit, will
only bewilder and perplex.</P>
<P>     This film is basically Kelly's Heroes (1970) for the Gulf War.
While searching Iraqi prisoners after a cease-fire, a pair of American
soldiers, Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and Chief Elgin (Ice Cube)
discover a map that seems to have directions to some Iraqi Bunkers out
in the desert.  Meanwhile Special Forces Captain Archie Gates, (George
Clooney) has been fed up with his cease-fire job of escorting  Christina
Amanapour-like reporter Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn) around the battle
sites.  He is  told by his superior that "This is a Media War, and you'd
better get on board." While cavorting with a female reporter who is a
rival of his charge, he hears about some Kuwaiti gold, and of course, he
and the guys who found the map come together and come up with a plan:
let's zip out in the desert and search these bunkers, there and back in
a day, so we can quit our cruddy jobs back home.  Also along for the
ride (and the comic relief) is the adorable country bumpkin Conrad Vig,
played by Music Video director and dancer (Fatboy Slim's "Praise You")
Spike Jonze.  Vig's character is a familiar archetype in these films:  a
brainlessly cute hayseed who of course is destined to die.  Gates hires
a buddy to lose Cruz out in the desert and heads off after his booty.</P>
<P>     Once the players on in place, they grab a Hummer and head out to
make their fortune.  This would not be possible normally, but Russell's
victorious Allied Army is portrayed as an extremely unorganized bunch of
frat boys (and girls) who while away the hours drinking and dancing to
rap music.  Everyone is so distracted by enjoying all of the rich
trappings of American excess, that our heroes have no problem slipping
out to get the gold.  Russell seems to be saying that the Gulf War and
those who fought in Desert Storm lacked any kind of moral imperative.
Any notions of patriotism are quite sincerely lacking.</P>
<P>     On the way to the bunkers, the boys fire their guns in the air
skeet-shoot with nerf footballs, carefree and overconfident that
everything will go as planned.  However, the operation hits a speed bump
when they stumble into the middle of a conflict between Saddam's loyal
soldiers, and rebels who are taking up George Bush's appeal to rise up
against Saddam.  George Bush is name-dropped so often that his name soon
becomes a sort of ironic punchline.  I half expected someone to mention
his 90% approval rating with a nod and a wink to the audience.  Bush is
portrayed as a great betrayer when Clooney and gang, limited by a
cease-fire agreement with Saddam, refuse to become involved in the
civil-war.  They are only interested in the Gold and nothing else.  The
steely reserve begins to soften and soon they find themselves duking it
out with The Republican Guard, and getting rescued themselves by Iraqi
rebels.  Once here they have no choice but to help.  It isn't because of
morals, it is because they have painted themselves into a corner and
cannot finish the job on their own. It's up to them to get the rebels
safely into Iran before the hammer is dropped on them, and in return the
rebels will help them carry the gold.  After that, it's a race to the
border.</P>
<P>     Politics show up in a less-than-subtle way after Barlow is
captured.  He is subjected to shock-torture and we get to listen to an
Iraqi talk about how his child was murdered by an American bomb.  The
interrogator also pours oil down Barlow's throat, asserting the cliche
notion that the war was only about oil. This is just short of the
director showing up and saying "Man, we Americans are sure bullies."
Luckily after being locked in a closet with all sorts of big-money items
such as Levis and Electronic Appliances, Barlow finds a cellphone and
after failing to directly contact the Allied Forces, decides to call
home.  My main problem with this scene is the fact that a cellphone will
lose a connection going under an overpass or a tunnel, yet Barlow has no
problem calling out of a closet in an underground bunker.  Go figure.
Wahlberg, however, gives his best performance, and his character was the
only really sympathetic of the bunch.</P>
<P>     Three Kings is filmed with a dizzying combination of slow-motion,
quick pans, and jump cuts.  At times the contrast is cranked, giving the
film a washed out "documentary" quality that we saw in Saving Private
Ryan too recently for it to be used here.  Russell also generously shows
what actually happens to a body when it is shot, complete with rupturing
gall bladders and organ-piercing slugs from an "inside" view of the
body.  Some of the bloodletting is portrayed with comic undertones, and
some is portrayed with an urgent kind of heavy-melodrama.</P>
<P>     By the time the real army comes looking for these guys, they have
pretty much broken every major military rule in the book,  Luckily,
however, the reporter they tried to ditch is around to film everything,
thus Gates seems to have learned all about the "media war" and how to
use it to his advantage.  The final images of the film are the "What
ever happened to..." blurbs that used to show up at the end of several
of the teensploitation films of the 80s.</P>
<P>     Overall the film was all over the map, never once deciding on
whether it was a comedy or a drama, or whatever.  Perhaps Russell wanted
it this way, but it doesn't make it a great artistic achievement.  The
characters really never change.  Afterwards they may have been a little
shaken up by what they saw, but they still were just out to steal some
gold, and everything they did was supposed to lead to pulling off their
caper, no matter how they tried to dress it up as "just helping out."
They are portrayed as a microcosm of the rest of the Allied efforts in
the Gulf.  Only $$$$ matters, nothing else.  Unlike films like M.A.S.H.
and Saving Private Ryan, we aren't given ordinary humans trying to cope
with inhumane circumstances, we are given greedy pirates who try to take
advantage of the power and position that their victorious Army has given
them.  I really cared if Hawkeye Pierce managed to keep his humanity
intact, and I really cared if Capt. John Miller survived the war.  I
didn't care about the leads in Three Kings.  Again, perhaps that is what
Russell intended, but that doesn't make it great cinema.  It plays more
like a really long tantrum.</P>
<P>Of the $7.50 I paid for this film, it was worth $0.00 (Nada)</P>
