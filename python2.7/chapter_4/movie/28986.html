<P>When it comes to poking fun at a country, France is an easy target. Sure,
they eat snails and don't wipe themselves after they shit, but we'll let
that slide.  The funniest thing about the French might be their sense of
humor...or complete lack thereof.  Bad Jerry Lewis films aside, two of the
country's most popular comedies (The Visitors and Little Indian, Big City)
are moronic, fish-out-of-water stories that failed in the U.S. and were
remade as even worse American films (Just Visiting and Jungle2Jungle,
respectively).</P>
<P>Why these two films?  One could contend the French enjoy the
fish-out-of-water genre because they all smell like fish out of water
themselves.  These are the kind of tired films that usually star Brendan
Fraser (Encino Man, The Scout, Blast From the Past, Monkeybone) and tank
domestically at the box office.  I'm not sure which is more of a shock -
that these films are so popular in France, or that they keep being remade
into unwatchable American movies.</P>
<P>The original Visitors, which was nominated for eight César Awards in 1994,
starred Jean Reno (before The Professional put him on U.S. radar) and
Christian Clavier, who also co-wrote the film's script.  Both stars and
co-writer/director Jean-Marie Poiré are back for this remake, which will
probably be one of the most unfunny films of 2001.  Visiting begins in 12th
century Sussex, where the French Count Thibault (Reno) is about to marry a
beautiful Englishwoman (Christina Applegate...can you believe Married With
Children debuted 14 years ago?).  Through some bunk involving a jealous man
and a witch, Thibault is given a potion that makes him hallucinate and kill
his new bride at their reception.</P>
<P>They sure knew how to do things right in the 12th century, as witnessed by
Thibault's immediate incarceration and scheduled beheading.  As he waits for
his date with the guillotine, Thibault and his faithful servant André
(Clavier) are visited by a wizard (Malcolm McDowell) who plans to rescue
them via time travel.  But he forgets to put an important ingredient in his
potion, and Thibault and André get trapped in the bowels of time...meaning
they end up in present-day Chicago.</P>
<P>Most of the film's comedy is supposed to come from Thibault and André being
amazed and frightened by every modern convenience, from cars to urinal
cakes.  None of it works.  Equally as weak is the story, which involves a
bookish museum curator (Applegate again) who thinks Thibault is her
long-lost cousin, but turns out to be his 30th generation descendant.  The
fact that Julia looks like Thibault's beloved makes absolutely no sense, and
the fact that they're related means they can't do it, which rules out any
typical screen romance.  Instead, the filmmakers throw us a romance bone in
the form of Tara Reid (American Pie), who both falls in love with the idiot
André and proves she's just as untalented as her own idiot fiancé, Carson
Daly.</P>
<P>Visiting is just plain awful, from the unoriginal script to the ridiculously
fake backgrounds used in the 12th century scenes.  The acting is bad, and
the direction is even worse.  The film offers a couple of laughs
(literally), and both come at the expense of the script's absurdity.</P>
<P>1:28 - PG-13 for violence and crude humor</P>
