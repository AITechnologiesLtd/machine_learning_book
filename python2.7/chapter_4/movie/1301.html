<PRE>                            CAPE FEAR
                  A film review by Ken Johnson
                   Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>135 min., R, Horror/Suspense, 1991
Director: Martin Scorsese
Cast: Robert DeNiro, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, Juliette Lewis,
      Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, Martin Balsam, Joe Don Baker,
      Fred Dalton Thompson</P>
<P>     Years ago Nolte was the lawyer for illiterate DeNiro who brutally
raped a sixteen-year-old girl.  DeNiro went to prison on a lesser charge
of battery.  Now DeNiro has gotten out of prison and has moved into the
town where Nolte lives with his wife Lange and their fifteen-year-old
daughter Lewis.  DeNiro starts terrorizing Nolte and his family but in
such a way that the law can't touch him.</P>
<P>     CAPE FEAR, like the film DEAD CALM, is more of a suspense film
than a horror film.  I found CAPE FEAR to be a very good, suspenseful,
film.  Part of the impact of this film is seeing it on a large screen.
For instance in the film there is a storm scene which will not be nearly
as spectacular on a television set.  For this reason I highly suggest if
you are one of the few people who hasn't seen this film that you go to
see it at a theater, if any theaters in your area are still playing it.
On a scale of zero to five, I rate CAPE FEAR a four.  CAPE FEAR is rated
R for graphic violence, explicit language, and adult situations.</P>
<P>     CAPE FEAR was in most of the large theaters near the end of 1991
and it had a long theatrical run before leaving most of the theaters in
early 1992.  Small theaters, like the one I saw it in, are now getting
CAPE FEAR, and it will be coming out on video soon.  </P>
<P>     The photography, using reverse (negative) images in the beginning
and at the very end of the film is well done.  It added an arty aspect
to the film, although in the middle of the film they used the reverse
image in a scene and that didn't fit in as well.  The opening credits
for the film were also well done with the water rippling and the
pictures superimposed.</P>
<P>     For the most part the script for the film was well done.  The one
part that I really didn't like about the script was how indestructable
Robert DeNiro's character was.  I don't think that prison could really
have toughened him up enough to just come walking back after some of the
things that happen to him in the film.  I don't want to mention the
things here so that I don't give away parts of the film for those of you
who haven't seen CAPE FEAR.  Juliette Lewis's character was especially
well written, and well acted.  I found that she did a very convincing
job.  Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange did a very spectacular job of the
sometimes fighting husband and wife.</P>
<P>     CAPE FEAR is based on a 1962 black-and-white drama also called CAPE
FEAR by J.  Lee Thompson.  It starred Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, and
Martin Balsam, all of whom have cameos in this film.  I haven't seen
the earlier version of CAPE FEAR so I can't comment on how closely
related they are.  Both versions are based on a novel by John
D. MacDonald [titled THE EXECUTIONERS  -Moderator].</P>
