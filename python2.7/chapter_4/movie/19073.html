<PRE>Grade: 67</PRE>
<P>The 1974 heavyweight championship fight between
George Foreman and Muhammad Ali is the subject of
this film, which won an Academy Award for Best
Documentary Feature.  A pair of famous journalists
who attended the fight, George Plimpton and Norman
Mailer, provide reminiscenses.  Their commentary
is fronted with archival footage of Ali, Foreman,
fight promoter Don King, performers at a concert
organized by King, dictator Mobuto, and Zaire
itself, where the fight was held.  There is also
narration by Spike Lee and Thomas Hauser.</P>
<P>Ali's brash, charismatic personality comes across
in numerous press conferences and interviews.
He was not only a great champion, but highly
entertaining as well.  Africans were quick to
embrace him over the menacing, sullen Foreman,
the reigning champion who had seemed invincible
after quick knockouts of Joe Frazier and Ken
Norton.  The press loved and respected Ali as well,
not only for his good-natured banter and boasting,
but for the values he represented and his
apt observations.  In those days, Foreman had
no resemblance to the amiable, loquacious
person that he would later become.</P>
<P>Promoter Don King is described as brilliant and
hard-working but 'completely amoral'.  Mobuto is
labelled as a murderous dictator, and is compared
to Joseph Stalin for his cult of personality.
Norman Mailer makes the from-left-field observation
that all dictators are ugly.</P>
<P>Before the fight, there was a major concert
in Zaire.  James Brown, B. B. King and The
Spinners were among the performers.  Footage from
this concert also makes it into the documentary.</P>
<P>The documentary succeeds in recreating the atmosphere
of the Ali-Foreman fighter.  It does seem padded,
however, and the series of film clips sometimes
lack a cohesion which is only partly provided by
the Plimpton-Mailer narration.</P>
