<PRE>                        10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Boy meets girl.  Another boy bets boy he can't score with girl. 
Boy pays third boy to try to loosen up girl's sister so he can get
girl.  Serious themes that haven't been explored since... well... since
SHE'S ALL THAT.</P>
<P>     At least 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU has one hell of a good title. 
I give it points for that alone.  And while this updating of
Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew" is clever and funny at times,
much of the film is just not entertaining due to bad directing by
way-out-of-his-element first-timer Gil Junger.</P>
<P>     In this retelling, we find Cameron (Gordon-Levitt) falling for
Bianca (Oleynik), the prettiest girl in all the land.  But dad (Miller)
won't let Bianca date until her older sister does!  Too bad sister Kat
(Stiles) is a, ahem, a shrew.  Whereupon Cameron launches a plan to
manipulate a half-dozen or so people such that Kat and brooding outcast
Patrick (Ledger) are a cozy couple.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, much of this potentially good material is paced like
a bad sitcom.  And never have I seen a movie so desperate for a laugh
track.  Turns out Junger directed the "coming out" episode of "Ellen,"
and even worked on the series "Blossom."  Well, you can draw your own
conclusions from *that*.</P>
<P>     There's fortunately some good comic relief in this flick, mostly
from the adults.  Larry Miller, in particular, deserves some kind of
award for having me crack up repeatedly.  And Mitchell's English teacher
proves that, yes, there is life beyond "Veronica's Closet."  Also of
note is a good pop score punctuated by personal faves Letters to Cleo
and Save Ferris.</P>
<P>     Too bad a generally good cast is largely wasted otherwise.  And
parents: PG-13 is a very generous rating.  You've been warned.</P>
<P>     And a final word: stay for the blooper reel during the credits. 
It's the best part of the film.</P>
