<P>So far in the year 2000, we have not had a great movie. So far in the year 2000
only 7 films have gotten *** or more, two films have gotten Zero Stars. I was
starting to give up on movies so far, when I came along this gem, which has
become a huge hit. Julia Roberts is probably my favorite actress in the world,
and starred last year in one of my top 10 favorites "Notting Hill". Roberts was
mostly known for her roles in romantic comedies such as "Pretty Woman" and
"Runaway Bride", now in the year 2000 Roberts comes back in a role much
different from her past, this time she is a tight skirt wearing, foul-mouthed,
sexy paralegal in the first great movie of 2000.</P>
<P>"Erin Brokovich" is the incredibly true story of a young woman (brilliant
played by Julia Roberts) who is the single mother of three, married twice and
divorced twice, living in a run down house with roaches, battling a lawyers
office which happens to be her job, and her love life is on the rocks. This is
the everyday of Erin's life. The film starts out with Erin getting into a nasty
accident, and sueing the guy responsible for hitting her. She ends up working
for this lawyer's office led by Ed Massery (played greatly by Albert Finney).
Erin is hired reluctencly as a paralegal, and ends up investigating a very
serious case in her real estate files, which has to deal with people on this
once piece of land, whose water comes from PG&E, ends up developing cancer
after living on this land, and drinking this water. Erin meets a young woman
played fantastically by Marg Helenberger who is being attacked with a handful
of diseases, and Erin gathers up enough people who in the past have lived on
this land to file a lawsuit. What insues is a uplifting story, and an
incredibly showcase of acting. </P>
<P>Julia Roberts who starred last summer in one of my favorite movies of all time,
1999's "Notting Hill", has again come through and made another movie that is
howlingly funny, devistatingly sad, and in the end uplifting and powerful that
a tear came to my eye because I felt so good. Julia gives yet another
Oscar-calibur performance, and her portrayal of a single mother here is
priceless. Roberts being not a mother in real life, is so believable that you'd
think she has kids secretly. Her on screen chemistry with the camera is beyond
descriptive words, and only the mind can imagine how good Julia is. Her snappy
dialogue written by Susannah Grant has some brilliantly funny lines, and very
smart words come out of this woman's mouth. Julia and her tightfitting clothes
are another character trait in this film, she is always in cleavage showing,
short tight-fitting skirts that always show off not even enough. She in the end
is powerful, yet subtle, foul-mouthed, yet gentle woman whom we fall in love
with by the time the credits role.</P>
<P>Her supporting actors notably Albert Finney are fantastic, and back up the lead
actress with charisma and charm. Albert Finney plays Erin's boss, and is
incredibly effective in his role. He gives us a believable man, who owns a
business and is having this young woman work for him, which we all know could
not be that easily done. In the end again we fall in love with him as well.
Aaron Eckhart most notable from "In The Company of Men" and "Your Friends &
Neighbors" is an on screen gem playing Erin's gruff, biker boyfriend Robert,
who behind all the facial hair, and ruff and tuff image, is a sweet natured
guy, who falls in love with both her and her kids. </P>
<P>Directed by Steven Soderbergh who gave us 1998's fantastic "Out of Sight"
strikes gold once again, with this realistic, breathtakingly fresh view into
Erin's world, and the effects it has on Erin's family. Not only does he do such
a good job at being a director, as he does making good movies. If Soderbergh
continues to make movies like this, I will continue to praise movies like this.
When you walk into a movie, and expect the best, and get even more it is a rare
feeling to know that movies like this can come out. Even though only being
March of 2000, I can already tell right now, "Erin Brokovich" is already one of
the best films of 2000, and so far the best movie I have seen of 2000. </P>
