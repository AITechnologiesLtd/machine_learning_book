<P>Painted in the colors of rust, Alejandro González Iñarritu's Amores
Perros is a hard-edged epic of interconnected lives in the mean streets
of Mexico City.  This has become a popular trend in independent films
such as Wonderland and The Five Senses, not to mention big-budget
blockbusters like Traffic.  By blending different scenarios, there's the
hope of creating a mass collage.  It's not as easy to pull off as you
might think -- consider the rhythm of your standard daytime soap opera.</P>
<P>The concept of three juxtaposed narratives, at least in the "flavor of
the month" sense, can be traced to Quentin Tarantino, as can the
gunslinging desperados and pop music that have become the humdrum
trademark of Pulp Fiction imitators.  Iñarritu is content to simply
rehash those familiar elements.  Perhaps that's why so much of this
Academy Award nominated foreign film comes off like a movie you've seen
more than once, translated a Espanol.</P>
<P>Despite the cinematic and structural predictability and an exhausting
three hour running time, Amores Perros finds surprising flickers of
humanity within the dead-end lives of ex-convicts, losers, young lovers
on the lam, and hired gunmen.  These almost-heroes are driven by an
unfinished business of the heart, most notably the mysterious phantom
hobo, El Chivo (Emilio Echevarría).  He's a contract killer (yes, a
homeless contract killer -- it's not played for laughs) for some elusive
businessmen, but his attention is drawn away by an unexpected obituary
notice that triggers memories of his long shrouded past.  This sort of
thing only happens in the movies, but let's cut Iñarritu some slack
here.</P>
<P>El Chivo lurks throughout the other two stories, but only in his
exclusive section (the final third of the film) does the heart and soul
of Amores Perros emerge.  Retribution is not seen as an easy mark, and
Iñarritu puts to one side the cheap violence and sadistic humor of his
previous tales, replacing it with the empathetic sorrow of a distant
love ballad.  Poetic and slighty cheeseball, but oh so sweet.</P>
<P>It's almost too little too late.  Example: one of the parallel stories
follows a young buck (Gael García Bernal) attempting to raise money to
run away from home with his beloved sister-in-law (Vanessa Bauche).  He
finds a financially lucrative solution in pitting the family pet in a
series of blood soaked dogfights.  For all its combustive energy, it's a
one-note tragedy as he makes enemies of his brother and the local goon
squad.  Things fall apart in a predictable hail of tears and bloodshed.</P>
<P>The other subplot steals images wholesale from Krzysztof Kieslowski,
presenting the arid relationship of a frivolous supermodel, Valeria
(Goya Toledo) and her boyfriend, a successful businessman (Alvaro
Guerrero).  The building block poster of Valeria across the street from
her dream home is a direct lift from Red (in which Irene Jacob played a
petulant model, natch).  When she is hospitalized in a terrible car
accident, the event that brings all of Amores Perros' characters
together, it forces her to reevaluate her empty life.  It'd be sad if
she weren't such an annoying phony.</P>
<P>The title, Amores Perros, directly translates as "Love's a Bitch." 
Meaning, life stinks.  It also means, literally, that love is a female
dog.  That explains the constant presence of mutts throughout.  El Chivo
is surrounded by runaway scamps, the supermodel has a pampered pooch,
and the young buck has his attack dog.  It sounds a little too neat -
and it is, really -- but the canines provide our nasty heroes someone
who they can relate to with unconditional affection.</P>
<P>That unabashed sentiment bridges Amores Perros through the hyperkinetic
overdrive of whiplash images, smash cuts, and the pulsating cacophony of
street noises on the audio track.  It's too much.  In his eager passion
to fill Amores Perros with explosive imagery, Iñarritu nearly drowns his
audience in visual excess.  If he doesn't watch out, he'll turn into
Ridley Scott.</P>
<P>Let's hope not.  This fresh new filmmaker does make the most of his
locations, finding the epitome of downbeat urban squalor (you can almost
taste the mined-in dirt), but he should have listened to Dennis Hopper's
advice in Tarantino's True Romance: "Slooooooow it down, man!"  He's got
an eye for the strong visuals representative of the overcrowded, noisy,
polluted excess of Mexico City.  Now all he needs is a steady gaze.</P>
