<PRE>                                  THE PIANO
                       A film review by Roger A. Rubio
                        Copyright 1994 Roger A. Rubio</PRE>
<P>Starring Holly Hunter, Sam Neill, Harvey Keitel, and Anna Paquin
Written and Directed by Jane Campion</P>
<P>     I wanted to wait until after the Oscars to review this film, and I
am glad that I did.  I distinguish between the labels film and movie
here with great caution, as this "piece" or "text," if you will, was a
film, and *not* a movie.  JURASSIC PARK was a movie; THE PIANO is a
film.</P>
<P>     Allow me to digress so that I may describe what I believe a film
to be and a movie to be (before I get any flames from die-hard JURASSIC
fans).  A movie is what I would consider to be pure entertainment with
little or no artistic content (a la DIE HARD I & II, BACKDRAFT, E. T.,
etc.).  A film is an artistic venture with little or no entertainment
content (a la 8-1/2, L'ATALANTE, PERSONA, etc.).  These are the two
extremes, and as always with film in general, there are gray areas.
THE PIANO is what I would consider to be, without a doubt, an attempt
to make a film, and not a movie.</P>
<P>     Now that that's out of the way, on with the review.  I mentioned
that THE PIANO was an attempt to make a film, and not necessarily a
film in itself.  These may be just semantics, but I truly believe this
film to be an attempt, and nothing more.  THE PIANO is a very
image-oriented film, filled with symbolism but lacking in overt
substance.  I found this movie to be a very good-looking movie, but
found little else in the story or the characters.  I found myself
influenced by AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE, a previous Jane Campion film,
which, while not making me do cartwheels, was an altogether good film.
THE PIANO made me feel like I was being pulled this way and that.  I
felt like Campion was saying all throughout the writing and making of
this film "Let's try this" or "This might be good."  It felt haphazard
to me, in that the story didn't seem to go anywhere.</P>
<P>     It had a beginning, middle, and end.  A first, second, and third
act.  It had a setup, a number of confrontations, and a resolution.
Everything a typical Hollywood screenplay would require.  But what was
the point?  The cinematography was breathtaking, the acting was
satisfactory, and the images were highly symbolic.  But why?  Most
artistic films don't follow the established "norm" of the Hollywood
screenplay, mostly because artistic films usually don't have much of a
script.  This is not to belittle art films.  On the contrary, this
absence of established norms is what provides for the freedom of
expression and individuality; the means by which to make us think in a
different perspective.  THE PIANO gave me little to think about.  Why
did a film like this, which leans so heavily towards the artistic side
of the medium, choose such a common Hollywood cliche format in which
to tell its story?</P>
<P>     AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE had no big-name Hollywood stars in it, yet
carried itself very well.  THE PIANO has some relatively strong
Hollywood heavyweights (Harvey Keitel and Holly Hunter).  Why the
change?  I personally got nothing from Holly Hunter's performance.  I
thought she was good, but not deserving of an Oscar.  Anna Paquin was
very cute, but I didn't think she should have gotten the Oscar either
(based on merit; I liked that she got to upstage all the other
actresses).  Harvey Keitel, again, plays a weird individual (the only
really ordinary part I have seen him play was in THELMA & LOUISE), and,
as always, pulls it off convincingly.  Sam Neill is the only
"foreigner" in this group (to Hollywood, that is, barring Anna Paquin),
and was satisfactory at best.  But I hate to speak of such good actors
in this way, because I don't believe they were given really challenging
parts to play.  One may argue with me on this point, citing a "brave
performance" by Holly Hunter, but I believe Campion made a grave
mistake in creating this character:  she let us into her head.  We had
a piece of her real character with us throughout the rest of the
picture.  No amount of acting on any actress's part (including
Hunter's) would convince me that I am learning anything new about this
person through her sign language; I know she can speak; she doesn't
have to use it.  I know her real character; everything else becomes a
facade.  I would have liked it if she expressed herself through facial
or more subtle physical expressions (when she is injured [no spoiler
attempt intended], the only way I know that she is in great pain is
through Anna Paquin and through Harvey Keitel, and through other
unmentionable things (if I'm not to spoil the film); Hunter showed me
nothing, which led me to think that anyone could have played that
part).  I believe I can recognize good use of subtlety to make a point,
a la HOWARD'S END, but even that fine film made me wonder what the
point of all this was.</P>
<P>     Symbolism abounds in this film, which threw me from the telling of
the story.  Then the story kicked in, which threw me from the
appreciation of the images.  Torn between two places.  What exactly was
going on here?  Images of death and rebirth in this film are well-known
to the artistically inclined; maybe they were "neato" things to the
Academy and they awarded THE PIANO its share of Oscars based on that.
Unfortunately, the Academy always awards based on politics, popularity,
and career longevity.  Never, if ever, on merit.  Anna Paquin is cute,
Holly Hunter was due again, and everybody in the Academy seemed to be
taken aback by the screenplay to THE PIANO.  These are the only reasons
I can think of to award Oscars to the categories they did.  If they
awarded on pure merit, I think the Academy would have been confused
with this film.  I unfortunately did not have the opportunity to know
the artist's intentions beforehand (it's usually easier to review a
film based on the intentions of its creator), so all I can do is raise
questions.  "What was the point" is not meant as a harsh indictment of
THE PIANO; it is simply a question.  Even artistic films have a point!</P>
