<P>This film was the second installment of Neil Simon's trilogy of plays
based on his own youth. In 1986, BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS debuted as part
one, with Jonathan Silverman embracing the lead role of Eugene Morris
Jerome. BILOXI BLUES came out in 1988, with Matthew Broderick as the
lead, and three years later, the TV movie BROADWAY BOUND closed off the
triad, with Corey Parker as the protagonist. </P>
<P>PLOT:
Story follows one Eugene Morris Jerome, an insecure, highly-observant
wannabee writer, and virgin, from New York, over his ten-week World War
II boot camp trial in Biloxi, Mississippi . Several divergent young
recruits highlight his group of trainees, as well as an abusive drill
sergeant who will stop at nothing to discipline this naïve set of
youths. Many rites of passages and lessons of life are entertained
during this unsure time of their lives. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Interesting, playful comedy covers most bases of youthful exuberance
and insecurity, offers a terrific performance by Christopher Walken as
the highly unstable drill sergeant, but ultimately does nothing to
reinvent the boot camp Army flic genre. This movie's strongest points
of consideration are its witty and well-skewered lines delivered via
the pen of writer extraordinaire, Neil Simon, and the fascinating
exhibition delivered by Christopher Walken, in one of his best roles of
his career.</P>
<P>Most of the characters in this film play caricatures of this period,
but as a whole, the gang worked on the platform on which they were
asked to perform, and many of their presentations were top-notch. Corey
Parker was particularly outstanding as the arrogant, outspoken, Jewish
recruit who delivered one of the most poignant and relevant lines for
me as a writer, "Once you start compromising your thoughts, you're a
candidate for mediocrity." Great line! </P>
<P>The style of the film does not offer us much more than any other film
of its genre, and the soundtrack could also have used a giant boost,
but overall, the film does deliver many laughs, some decent
performances, and a pretty intense scene between Walken and Broderick
nearing its finish. Also, I have always been a fan of epilogues, so I
did enjoy this one as well, but will admit that it did turn out to be a
little too schmaltzy if you really think about it. But most of all, it
is the idiosyncratic and genuine performance by Christopher Walken that
solidified this movie for me. He delivered all of his lines with
extreme coolness and pinache, and drew out a perfect scene as the drunk
sergeant on the brink of sanity. If you liked him in TRUE ROMANCE
(9/10) and AT CLOSE RANGE (7.5/10), you'll love him in this wonderfully
unhinged achievement.</P>
