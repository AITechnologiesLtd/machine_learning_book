<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>I'm not an admirer of Philip Kaufman's (The Unbearable Lightness of
Being) previous films. In Quills he has adapted Doug Wright's play to
create a drab period piece of the Marquis de Sade story. It lacks an
edginess, as the shocks against civilization's sensibility are not
geared to move the intellect. Its theme embellished the belief that
freedom is in writing without censorship. The film's rallying cry could
be, 'Bring me a quill!'</P>
<P>The story is set after the days of the French Revolution, when the
Napoleonic empire was in place. It was a time of mixed messages in the
areas of social reform and repression. The story takes place in the
Charenton Asylum, where the Marquis de Sade (Rush) has been spared his
life and has become the most famous inmate of the asylum. He occupies
luxurious accommodations in a private cell, and is given the privilege
to write for the hospital's theater, has his own library, a feathered
bed, and is served special gourmet meals. These are all paid for by his
wealthy wife. He doesn't have the privilege to publish, but does so by
smuggling his manuscripts out with the virgin laundress, Madeleine
(Winslet). The asylum is run by the benevolent Abbe Coulmier (Joaquin
Phoenix), who believes in progressive methods to help his 200 patients
and that kindness is the medicine to cure them.</P>
<P>The story picks up when the Marquis' sadistic-erotic book "Justine" is
published in Paris and achieves popularity with the public. Napoleon
decides to burn the book and take action against the author. He calls in
a man of science Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) to go to the asylum
and be the overseer of the asylum. He allows him to use torture, if
necessary, to get the Marquis to conform. The elderly Royer takes a
lovely virgin teenage bride, Simone (Warner), from the nunnery and goes
to live in Charenton. Their marriage becomes the target of a new vulgar
play the Marquis puts on about them while they are in attendance, which
gives Royer the ammunition needed to shut down the theater and for
Coulmier to take away his quills.</P>
<P>Since the Marquis must write in order to live, he finds various unique
ways to write his manuscripts and get them out. But when the Marquis is
caught in the act of smuggling, his privileges are removed; eventually,
he is left naked in his bare cell after being tortured. His liberal care
under Coulmier now changes completely to Royer-Collard's harsher
treatment of him.</P>
<P>Kaufman shot this dreary tale at Pinewood Studios and used mostly an
English cast, though some cast members were Australian and American. In
this version, the Marquis de Sade is made out to be more of a misguided
writer and a witty aristocrat than truly a murderous villain. There are
many quotes from his writings, but not those that show him in his more
beastly nature. The best quote is when looking at the figure of the
Virgin he says: "An entire religion built on an oxymoron." Royer-Collard
is reduced to be more the villain than the Marquis is. Phoenix is the
idealistic priest, who is mentally tortured by what he sees and what he
has become. He has the most solid role in the film and makes the best of
it. Kate Winslet didn't convince me she was a peasant laundress, but she
still came off with a feisty although a forgettable performance.</P>
<P>The film failed because it was too dull to be entertaining and it didn't
have anything startling to say about a startling subject to be
intellectual. Its shrill moments outweighed its moments of irony, when
it was able to show how insane the men of reason were in their treatment
of the mentally ill. This was a middlebrow work, that made light of the
innovative Marquis as a man who was merely politically incorrect rather
than completely debased. He was glorified for his wit only because he
was up against a heavy-handed man of science in Michael Caine and a
hypocritical man of the cloth in Joaquin Phoenix. Aiming at those
targets is like shooting at ducks in a pond.</P>
