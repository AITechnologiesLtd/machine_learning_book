<PRE>LA. CONFIDENTIAL
**** of ****</PRE>
<P>This is the best film of the year. If TITANIC (****) wins Best Picture
at the Oscars it will be a tragedy the size of FORREST GUMP (***) over
PULP FICTION (****). The sad fact is that TITANIC will win. Nothing
against TITANIC which is one of the best films of the year, LA.
CONFIDENTIAL is just soo much better.</P>
<P>LA. CONFIDENTIAL is a masterpiece of a film set in the 1940's and
dealing with three cops, one a "celebrity" cop, one a pit bull, and the
other a kid raising through the ranks by screwing over other cops. They
are thrown into a massacre that turns out to be a very complex puzzle of
twists and turns. </P>
<P>Every aspect of this film is beautifully composed, the look, dialog and
acting is key. Who would expected a film this wonderful from Curtis
Hanson (co-writer/director) after he inflicted us with THE RIVER WILD
(**1/2) and HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE (**)? Who would have expected a
film this complex and intricate?</P>
<P>The cast is fantastic, consisting of 4 red hot actors. Guy Pearce is
quite a discovery as the department hated cop, his last film was
ADVENTURES OF PRICELLA QUEEN OF THE DESERT(!). Kevin Spacey delivers a
knockout performance that out does that of THE USUAL SUSPECTS (****).
Russel Crowe hasn't been this good since his Aussie film ROMPER STOMPER
(***1/2). James Cromwell continues his critical waves, created with BABE
(***).</P>
<P>All hope of a Best Picture oscar is not completly lost. TITANIC didn't
recieve a nomination for screenplay or lead actor. The distinction that
made it so much higher than other films were action awards (sound,
visual effects,...). If CONFIDENTIAL comes up unvictorious to the boat
don't be suprised. Remember Fargo, Pulp, .........</P>
