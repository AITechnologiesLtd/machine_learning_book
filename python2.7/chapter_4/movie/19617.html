<P>"When the Wind and Cloud combine, the fish with Golden Scales will become a
Dragon."
Intrigue, magic, spectacle, and mystery are spelled out by that tantalizing
prophecy which opens "THE STORM RIDERS" one of the recent arrivals from Hong
Kong. A marvelously inventive, visually stunning, and perplexing tale of
conquest and revenge.</P>
<P>The film opens with the arrival of the prophet Mud Buddha (Lai Yu-hung) to the
mountaintop palace of the Tin Ha Sect. It is there that Lord Conquer Hung Ba
(Sonny Chiba) receives the prophecy and the means with which to ensure his
mastery of the martial world. Using birth charts, Lord Conquer raids the
villages in an effort to locate the two children whose names are Wind and Cloud.
After killing their families, Lord Conquer makes apostles of the children making
them part of his inner circle along with his own son Frost.</P>
<P>As the children grow up into men, the Tin Ha Sect has decimated most of China,
plundering its riches and people. Lord Conquer proves to be an unholy and evil
man, interested only in his fame and wealth. Having collected the swords from
all of his enemies except for the famed Ultimate Sword created by master
swordmaker, Nip Yan-wong (Yu Wong-Guang), Cloud's father. Now conflict comes as
the two adopted boys both fall in love with Lord Conquer's Daughter, Charity.</P>
<P>After ten years of success, Lord Conquer grows anxious. Wanting to know what his
future holds, he orders his three warriors to find Mud Buddha, to force the seer
to reveal the final part of his prophecy. When he learns that Wind and Cloud
will bring about the downfall his empire, the evil Lord conspires to turn the
two men against one another, by forcing his daughter, Charity to marry one of
them.</P>
<P>Director Andrew Lau has constructed a marvelously striking fantasy  in 'THE
STORM RIDERS' (Cantonese Title: 'Feng yun' ). What makes the film perplexing is
simple that some of the Chinese inter-titles are not translated, making the
relationship between some of the characters difficult to identify. This problem
aside, the film is remarkably entertaining and engrossing. Lau, serving as his
own Cinematographer, frames every scene for maximum emotional impact. There are
scenes here of extraordinary composition and beauty. Add to that the
spectacularly vivid computer generated effects, and the film takes on the epic
quality of a biblical drama.</P>
<P>The framing of the scenes are based on the panels of a comic or graphic novel.
Camera angles are rarely straight ahead. The film, while violent and action
packed is never grotesque. Scenes of violence have a joyous roller coaster ride
vitality to them, incorporating some marvelously inventive effects, both visual
and physical. There are scenes here of jaw dropping inventiveness and beauty.
The Wow! Factor is in great abundance. While the choreography of the martial
arts on display are in the traditional method of Hong Kong filmmaking, the
addition of the fantasy element and the visual effects, display a marvelous joy
and verve. The only western comparison that comes to mind is Director John
Carpenter's unfairly maligned "Big Trouble in little China"(1986).</P>
<P>The plotting of the film is troublesome. The story, being base on a series of
popular comics in Hong Kong is understandably episodic. While it is certain that
most Hong Kong viewers will understand and recognize all of these characters,
Westerners may have a hard time pulling all of these intricacies together.
Nevertheless, "The Storm Riders"  still entertains simple on it's own verve and
sense of wonder.</P>
<P>The performances are all two dimensional, which is to be expected in such a
fairy tale. The sole false note comes from lead Arron Kwok as Cloud is much too
brooding, coming off as a petulant child rather than a man bent on revenge.
Nevertheless, the performance does give the film a needed center and focus, as
it is Cloud's determination to one day take revenge against his master for the
death of his father.</P>
<P>The standout performance of the film is without a doubt the re-doubtable Sonny
Chiba. His turn as Lord Conquer is a fine, scene-stealing tip of the hat to
Toshiro Mufune. His performance is full of mad posturing and grand gestures,
truly fitting a whu-shu performance. Best known for his 'Streetfighter' series
of films (when released in the U.S. in 1974, the film was summarily given an X
rating by the Motion Picture Ratings Board). Mr. Chiba pulls out all of the
classic stops in giving Lord Conquer a full degree of madness and ego.</P>
<P>The sound design of the film is equally stunning. Recorded in sync sound
(recorded live) in the native Hong Kong dialect of Cantonese, 'The Storm Riders'
has one of the most luscious soundtracks recorded. The sound effects are
stunning and deafening. If you get a chance to see this film on the big screen,
do so. The second best option is the vibrant DVD released earlier this year by
Universe Laser & Video (a Hong Kong video company).</P>
<P>In closing, with Hong Kong's film industry in danger of being devoured by the
video pirates, it's a shame that films such as 'The Storm Riders' may never be
made again. I can only hope that this does not happen. Made on a meager budget
of $10 million dollars (U.S. equivalent), the film looks and feels like it cost
six times that much.</P>
<P>On a scale of 1 to 5, "THE STORM RIDERS" rates a raging 4. Grand entertainment
for those adventurous enough to seek it out. The film has no MPAA rating, but
should be considered a PG-13. Cantonese language with English subtitles. 128
minutes running time. Panavision (scope-wide screen).</P>
