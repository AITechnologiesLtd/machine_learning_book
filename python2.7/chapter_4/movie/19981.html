<PRE>Mystery Men
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Frustrations. I don't know about you, but they're some of my least favorite
things. And there's so many of them. Lives that might have been. Opportunities
lost. Delayed gratification.</P>
<P>In the context of this column, the most common frustration, and the most
dreaded one, is a movie that almost makes it. Every element seems right, but
they don't fit together. The whole is less than the sum of the parts.
Filmmaking is an art, not a science, and sometimes the best laid plans just
don't quite work.</P>
<PRE>Thus we have <I>Mystery Men<I>.</PRE>
<P>Based on a little known cult-favorite comic book by Bob Burden (also
responsible for the equally cultish "Flaming Carrot"), the film is a spoof of
super-hero antics. The mystery men are an unnamed group of farm league
characters who don't quite get the idea.</P>
<P>Some of them have super powers -- The Spleen (Paul Reubens aka PeeWee Herman)
can disable a foe from a distance with his deadly, err...gases -- and others
merely think they do. The Invisible Boy's (Kel Mitchell) power is inspired. He
is invisible only as long as no one is looking at him.</P>
<P>The team operates in Champion City, a cross between Gotham City  and
"Bladerunner", but no one takes them seriously. After all, the city already
has a resident hero, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear).</P>
<P>The good Captain has done such a good job of cleaning up crime that he has no
foes left to fight. Since this has resulted in a decline in commercial
endorsements, he arranges the release of his arch-enemy Casanova Frankenstein
(Geoffrey Rush). When Frankenstein captures Amazing in a nefarious scheme, the
second-raters must come to the rescue.</P>
<P>The casting is wonderful. Hank Azaria is The Blue Raja who, clad in green, is
an expert at throwing forks and scratching cars. Janeane Garofalo as The
Bowler throws a mean strike with her transparent ball encasing her father's
skull. Ben Stiller's power as The Furious is that he is uncontrollable when he
gets angry. At least that's what he keeps saying. The list goes on.</P>
<P>The real stand-out is William H. Macy as The Shoveler. Using only a shovel as
a weapon, he is the perfect gimmick super-hero. He's committed to his work and
takes it seriously: Batman with a digging tool. Macy is perfect in the role.
He completely captures the dedication of a crime fighter and is hilarious only
because the concept is ludicrous.</P>
<P>This isn't so true with some of the others. Vastly talented Reubens is stuck
in a goofy role and is unable to transcend it. Rush is more tedious than
menacing. Tom Waits as a weapons designer could have been outrageous.</P>
<P>So many of the scenes are hilarious, it's difficult to understand why the film
doesn't deliver more than it does. When the guys realize they need more
firepower, they hold a barbecue tryout for more members. It's a wonderfully
wacky bit.</P>
<P>The heroes refuse to believe that Captain Amazing's secret identity is
millionaire Lance Hunt because Hunt wears glasses. How could he see without
them? When confronted with a super-villain, they dent and scrape his limo.
Their rescue of Amazing doesn't go exactly as planned with an appropriately
ridiculous result.</P>
<P>But overall, the movie feels flat. There's too much of the same scene over and
over. The Bowler's animated ball is entertaining the first time, but after
that, it's repetition. The Spleen's farting is less amusing the more he does it.</P>
<P>In his first feature film, director Kinka Usher exhibits his commercial-making
("Got Milk?", Taco Bell) background as he introduces sub-plots and leaves
them unexplored.</P>
<P>Some of the timing is off. The Furious' attempt at romancing a coffee shop
waitress is so much wasted time. For such an over-the-top movie, some it is
oddly subdued and could do with a bit more flamboyance. As the film draws to
an end, it becomes too much like the movies it makes fun of.</P>
<P>"Mystery Men" is not a bad film. Some portions are marvelous and it's worth
seeing just for those.</P>
<P>Like some frustrations in real life, this movie comes close. So close.</P>

somewhat of a mystery to himself. Email your tales of frustration to
