<P>     What is it exactly about Jean-Claude Van Damme that is so appealing
to Hong Kong directors?  His familiarity with the action genre in which
they made their names?  A common struggle with the English language?  His
refusal to let plot interfere in a stunt?  Whatever the reason, two of the
great action directors of the last decade have chosen Van Damme vehicles
for their English language debuts, John Woo in 1993's HARD TARGET and now
Ringo Lam (CITY ON FIRE) in MAXIMUM RISK.  And what else do the two films
have in common?  Uninspired situations and action which is unlikely to
make anyone forget the director's Hong Kong efforts.</P>
<P>     Van Damme plays Alain Moreau, a Nice police officer who discovers,
much to his amazement, that he had a twin brother who was given up at
birth and raised in New York.  That brother, Mikhail Suverov, turns out to
have been involved with the Russian mafia, and is killed in Nice by
unknown assailants for an unknown reason.  Alain is determined to find out
about the brother he never knew, and sets off for New York to investigate.
There he discovers plenty of people who mistake him for Mikhail, most of
whom are none too pleased to see him, like mid-level mafia boss Ivan (Zach
Grenier) and federal agents who have their own reasons for wanting Mikhail
dead.  The only person Alain can trust is Mikhail's girlfriend Alex
(Natasha Henstridge) as he tries to stay alive long enough to find out
about the mysterious contents of a safe deposit box which everyone wants
to get their hands on.</P>
<P>     I find myself at something of a loss as I try to come up with
something worth saying about MAXIMUM RISK, because it is such a resolutely
mediocre film.  From the screams-of-generic title (fill in your favorite
dangerous-sounding adjective and noun here) to the screams-of-generic plot
(they killed his brother...now he's going to make them pay) to the
screams-of-circa-1986-generic villain (he may not be a Russian spy, but
he's still Russian), MAXIMUM RISK is a film that takes absolutely _no_
risk.  It even wastes the presence of Natasha Henstridge, who may not have
proven herself to be a gifted thespian yet but still has nearly as much
impressive physicality at her disposal as Van Damme, and the only use to
which it is put is in a nude scene which may re-define gratuitous.  The
one possible interesting twist -- Alain is a military-trained crack shot
-- is mysteriously kept under wraps until only ten minutes remain in the
film, when suddenly he can shoot an eye out at 200 yards.</P>
<P>     Van Damme himself is making gradual strides as an actor, something
genre cohorts like Steven Seagal may never do.  It may be a sign of his
desire to be taken seriously that the obligatory shot of his bare backside
does not appear in MAXIMUM RISK, although he does participate in a
fist-fight in a sauna where towels remain strategically placed in a manner
defying all known laws of physics.  The problem is that, through his own
decisions or those imposed on him by the Hollywood hierarchy, Van Damme
performs in the kind of films where serious acting usually looks just
plain silly.  Alain may be deeply affected by learning of the existence of
his twin, but when he is forced to react to that knowledge by throwing yet
another roundhouse kick or, worse yet, staring into a metaphorically
convenient fractured mirror, it is like Van Damme is playing at acting
rather than really acting.</P>
<P>     Still, there is a certain atmosphere to MAXIMUM RISK which shows
Ringo Lam struggling to assert himself over his soggy material.  It has a
dirty feel which is atypical of glossy Hollywood adventures, and a few
action sequences have real crackle, particularly the opening chase through
the streets of Nice.  Lam clearly has the chops to put the action in an
action film, a knack for pacing and an awareness of where a camera should
go.  What he can't do is turn lead into gold, and in MAXIMUM RISK he is
working with a script that is about as leaden as they come.  John Woo made
the big time when he moved from Van Damme to Travolta in BROKEN ARROW;
here's hoping Lam gets the same shot some time soon.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Lam chops:  5.</PRE>
