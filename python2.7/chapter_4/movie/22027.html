<P>For sheer audacity and outrageous invention, you can do no better than the 
truly extraordinary "Being John Malkovich," a bizarre, involving, strangely 
moving film experience. Putting it plainly, it is unlike anything I have ever 
seen before. </P>
<P>John Cusack stars as a long-haired puppeteer named Craig Schwartz, an 
expressive, magical talent who performs his act on the streets. Most of his 
puppet shows contain sexual connotations, and thus are not always embraced by 
passerby. He lives at home with his animal-loving wife, Lotte (an 
unrecognizable Cameron Diaz), but the marriage is unexciting and their 
conversations do not merit much communication. When Craig is not performing, 
he sleeps most of the day until he gets the energy to look for a job. This 
leads him to an office vicinity located in the 7 1/2th floor of a Manhattan 
building (one has to crawl in between floors to get in) where he works as a 
fast file clerk. It is here where he discovers a mysterious portal that leads 
into the mind of John Malkovich! </P>
<P>The portal changes Craig's life, as well as Lotte's (who forms a sexual 
awakening). Along for the ride is Craig's co-worker. a sexpot vixen 
(cunningly played by Catherine Keener) whom Craig is attracted to. To say 
much more is to ruin the fun of "Being John Malkovich," which takes its 
central idea through all kinds of delirious heights and lengths with one 
inventive twist after another. We are talking sexual connotations galore, 
celebrities, parentage, a one-hundred-year-old office manager, chimps, wooden 
puppets, a bald-headed Charlie Sheen and, of course, John Malkovich. </P>
<P>Cusack's Craig is the perfect foible for this type of bizarre fantasy - the 
Everyman as the malcontent artist trying to make a name for himself any which 
way he can. We are led every step of the way of his unusual circumstance, and 
slowly the subjective stance of his character shifts to Lotte, back to Cusack 
and Keener, and Malkovich. This leads to an interesting question: whose life 
is it anyway? Anyone can live inside Malkovich's mind briefly before being 
deported hilariously into the New Jersey Turnpike, but when can a mind not be 
your own? Craig uses this portal as a portal into his own alternate 
existence, and the film grows more complex and darkly comic as Craig's 
ambitions grow.</P>
<P>Cameron Diaz is astoundingly good, and proves she is a fine character actress 
- look how well she disappears into the role of the sexually carnivirous 
Lotte. This is clearly her finest work since the comic powerhouse of "There's 
Something About Mary." Catherine Keener gives an acutely observant 
performance - her best scenes are when she tries to woo Malkovich (in and out 
of his brain) or when she seduces Charles and Lotte in their apartment. 
Malkovich is as always Malkovich, an elegantly stylish actor - he seems like 
the right actor for this kind of mind trip, though the running joke in the 
film is that most of the characters can't recall what films he has appeared 
in.</P>
<P>"Being John Malkovich" is directed by music-video director Spike Jonze, who 
often relies a bit too much on hand-held camerawork, but nevertheless has an 
efficient, straightforward style. Writer Charlie Kaufman must have had a 
wonderful time concocting all the different paradoxes and twists with such a 
novel idea - he runs with it and takes it from one extreme to another. It is 
not so much about being someone else as it is about losing your soul in the 
process. This is the first film I would literally call a mind trip of the 
first order. </P>
