<PRE>MOONRAKER (1979) ***</PRE>
<P>        They were going to pit James Bond against an evil 
groundskeeper and call the movie LEAFRAKER, but then they 
realized if they put Bond on a space shuttle they could call it 
MOONRAKER instead. It's silly at times, but it is entertaining, and 
how could I give a bad review to the only movie in the series in which 
Bond has zero-gravity sex? Interestingly enough, the escapade is 
broadcast to the leaders of the free world (pay-per-view, of course). 
"What is he doing?!" The head of NASA shrieks, to Q's quick reply, "I 
believe he's attempting re-entry."</P>
<P>        Bond gets not three but four women in the sack here, 
including a scientist from NASA he teams up with to investigate the 
disappearance of a space shuttle. He goes from Venice to Rio De 
Janeiro, with 7-foot-tall, indestructible metal-mouth villain Jaws (who 
also popped up in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME) following. They find 
in Rio that an evil businessman has been sending the shuttles into 
space to form a master race space colony (Adolf enters the space age). 
Satellites containing nerve gas are sent to destroy the earth's 
population. Not a bad idea, but I'd personally extinguish the human 
race by showing them life-sized nude pictures of Bea Arthur.</P>
<P>        The planets are all aligned here, so to speak. The chases are 
edge-of-your-seat entertainment (pure movie magic!), including two 
boat chases, and the death traps are clever, with Jaws being at the 
helm of most of those. The climax on the space station is also good 
stuff. MOONRAKER is an all-around entertaining movie, with that 
zero-gravity sex thrown in to boot.</P>
