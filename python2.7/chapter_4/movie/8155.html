<PRE>                               FACE/OFF
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Nicholas Cage and John Travolta have
          to exchange personalities as well as bodies while
          trying to kill each other.  Two tired plot elements
          show surprising new life in a thriller that
          combines the hunt for a brilliant sociopath with a
          body switch.  The result is a thriller with at
          least a little intelligence behind it.  Director
          John Woo could improve the film by toning down the
          action scenes, and he does not always show the best
          of taste in his stylistic choices.  But for once
          his film has more going for it than action.
          Certainly FACE/OFF is a step in the right direction
          for Woo.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4), 7 (0 to 10)</PRE>
<P>     When I grew up noodle soup was a lot of broth and only a little
bit of noodles.  Then on the market from East Asia came ramen which was
mostly noodles.  The marketers of this product acknowledged that many
people bought noodle soup for the noodles so they made that most of the
soup.  When I grew up an action film was something like THE GUNS OF
NAVARONE.  It had a good story and some action sequences.  Unhappily
much of the audience really was watching the film for the action
sequences and the plot just bound them together, but at least it was
there for those who wanted it.  The Hong Kong action film formula
delivers action the way ramen delivers noodles.  It gives you more
action than plot.  Part of the formula is to turn the drama to
melodrama.  Melodrama allows for more dramatic moments in a shorter
space of time, leaving more time to devote to action sequences.  Then
the action sequences go off like a strings of firecrackers on Chinese
New Year.  Turning the story to melodrama and increasing the pace of
the fireworks destroys much of the credibility of a film, but it gives
the audience what it wants.  That is the Hong Kong action film formula
and one of its leading proponents is John Woo.  But Woo has been lured
to Hollywood and he has had to compromise his style a bit.  He has
toned down the melodrama making for a longer story to tell.  He has cut
down the proportion of action scenes while lengthening the film.
FACE/OFF is a long film at 138 minutes, it spends less time with action
sequences than his earlier films, but he uses the extra time to tell a
more dramatically satisfying story with a more engaging premise.</P>
<P>     In action films we have had more than our share of films of law
agents stalking psychopathic killers.  And a few seasons back we also
had in a short time a lot of films with people switching bodies and
having to live as the other person.  Combining the two ideas does not
sound like a promising idea, but it makes for a much more interesting
piece dramatically than most of Woo's films.  Castor and Pollux Troy
(played respectively by Nicholas Cage and Alessandro Nivola) are
brother sociopaths who have little in common with their namesakes, the
Dioscuri who accompanied Jason on his quest for the Golden Fleece.
Castor is a super- extrovert (and obnoxious) criminal genius.  Six
years earlier he nearly killed FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta)
and did kill Archer's young son.  The ruthless and narcissistic killer
has been pitted against stiff and introverted FBI agent for several
years, and finally Archer manages to kill Castor Troy.  However, the
government knows that Castor and Pollux have set a bomb to destroy Los
Angeles and Pollux refuses to talk.  Then Archer finds out that Castor
is still alive, albeit comatose, and that a new process can transform
Archer to look like Castor.  It is suggested that Archer become Castor
and perhaps trick information from Pollux Troy.  Of course Castor wakes
from his coma, finds out what has happened and forces the doctors to
transform him to look like Archer.  The logic (or lack of logic) in
this scene is one of the low-points of the film.  But to fool people
Castor and Archer each has to take on the other's mannerisms.  The
introvert must force himself to be an extrovert, the extrovert ... well
that would be telling.  Each must get involved with the family or
friends of the other, and gets a better understanding of the enemy.
Loyalties become confused.  Many things are happening at different
levels in this film and Woo manages to keep things together.</P>
<P>     John Woo's anything goes Hong Kong style just does not really work
all the time.  There is a somewhat questionable sequence in with a
child's home is shot up and a child is very nearly killed all done to
the tune of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow."  The scene may well have been
inspired by the brilliant "Danny Boy" sequence in MILLER'S CROSSING,
but here it is too easy to construe it as making light of child
endangerment.  It indicates that Woo, like some of his characters, is
not always in full control of his talents.  And in this scene, like
most of Woo's action scenes, the violence is turned up to a degree far
beyond any realism and all subtlety is lost.  When Woo is finished with
a set for one of his action scenes it is pretty well shredded.  Other
places he has more control such as well-choreographed sequence in which
FBI agents try to stop a plane from taking off.  The opening sequence
is a nightmarish flashback showing a good deal of atmosphere.</P>
<P>     Woo goes neither for drama nor his usual melodrama, but something
somewhere in between.  He has good actors in Travolta and Cage and more
than his other films he needs them as each goes through layers of the
others personality.  Nancy Allen plays Archer's wife, for once an
intelligently drawn character.  Allen is a two-time Oscar nominee for
her roles in THE CRUCIBLE and as Pat Nixon in NIXON.  In a role that
other filmmakers might have minimized, she holds her own.  Gina Gershon
also plays well in a sympathetic role as a close friend of Castor.</P>
<P>     John Woo is showing signs of maturing as a filmmaker.  While he
still is a fan a large scale destruction scenes, he has shown he can
make a film with a little more to it.  I rate this film a +2 on the -4
to +4 scale.</P>
