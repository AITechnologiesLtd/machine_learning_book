"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>I've never seen any of the three Highlander films, or one episode of the
syndicated television series, so I don't know Highlander from Hi-C.  But
I do know a good action film when I see it, and Highlander: Endgame
doesn't fit the bill.  It's a slow-moving piece of garbage with choppy
fight sequences and bad acting.</P>
<P>The story merges the paths of Connor (Christopher Lambert, from the
first three films) and Duncan Macleod (Adrian Paul, from the television
series) – two brothers that are members of an exclusive club of
immortals.  Supposedly, each of the immortals battle each other, gaining
the power of each person they slay.  At the end, only one immortal can
exist, which makes no sense because immortal people shouldn't be able to
die!</P>
<P>In Endgame, a diabolical character named Kell (Bruce Payne, Howling 6),
who, according to the film's press notes, has become `the most
invincible immortal ever.'  Say what?  That would be like saying that
Mickey Mantle was the most Yankeeist Yankee of all time.  Anyway, Kell
has killed over 600 immortals and assumed the power of all of his
victims.  Only 5,000-year-old brothers Connor and Duncan can stop the
power-hungry madman.</P>
<P>Endgame's press notes also speak of `dizzying time shifts across the
eons,' and, boy, they aren't kidding.  In the film's first five minutes,
the setting switches from 1990 to 2000 to the 1500s.  Don't look down to
find your popcorn or, God forbid, leave to use the bathroom because
you'll be completely lost once you shift your attention back to the
film.</P>
<P>Endgame is the directorial debut of Douglas Aarniokoski, who cut his
teeth working as an assistant on the last three Robert Rodriguez films.
The screenplay was written by the sequel-happy Joel Soisson, who also
penned Maniac Cop 3, The Prophecy 3 and the upcoming Mimic 2.  It's
supposed to be the final film in the series, and to that, I can only
say, `Thank God.'</P>
<P>1:25 - R for violence and some strong sexuality</P>
