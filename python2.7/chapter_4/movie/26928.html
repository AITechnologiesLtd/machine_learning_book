"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Remember when Johnny Depp used to make good films and Michael Stipe used
to make good music?  At some point over the last couple of years, the
two seemed to undergo some sort of swap.  Depp has struck out with roles
in awful films like The Astronaut's Wife and The Ninth Gate, while
playing guitar for a band called P (which, ironically, has a song about
Stipe).  Meanwhile, Stipe produced three of 1999's best films (Being
John Malkovich, American Movie and The Limey), but R.E.M.'s sales
figures have plummeted.</P>
<P>Stipe has also produced Spring Forward – an action fan's worst
nightmare. There's nothing a knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathing Van Damme
fan hates more than a character study, and that's just what they'll get
here.  But Forward is so much more than a film heavy in dialogue and
deficient in superfluous action.  In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find
a picture that bests Forward in the arenas of acting, directing and
writing.  It is clearly one of the year's best films, but, sadly, the
lack of a major distributor will likely hamper any shot at well-deserved
year-end accolades.</P>
<P>Already the winner of numerous film festival awards, Forward is set over
the course of one year in a small Connecticut town.  The film is
comprised of seven sections that focus on two Parks & Recreation
Department workers.  Murph (Ned Beatty, Cookie's Fortune) has been
married for nearly half a century and is less than a year away from
retirement.  Paul (Liev Schreiber, Scream 3) is a young high school
dropout who has just been released from prison.</P>
<P>As you would expect, their relationship doesn't start off on the right
foot, but as the film progresses, the two men begin to open up to each
other despite the differences in their age and backgrounds.  Surprising
parts of their lives surface, and Murph and Paul begin to bond as New
England's seasons change around them.  By the time the closing credits
roll, the seasons have made a complete arc, as has the relationship
between Murph and Paul.</P>
<P>Although it sounds like it, Forward isn't an Odd Couple ripoff.  Murph
and Paul are two real, down-to-Earth blue-collar guys, and the film
doesn't shove heavy-handed moral lessons or bonding crap down your
throat either (otherwise it would be like another Forward – as in Pay
It).  In a film this finely written, cinematography hardly matters, but
Forward is handsomely photographed by Terry Stacey, from television's
hastily cancelled medical drama Wonderland.</P>
<P>Forward is an astonishing debut from writer/director Tom Gilroy, who
previously played bit parts in a bunch of independent films.  Some
people may have big problems with Gilroy's style, which leaves a lot of
unanswered questions instead of neatly wrapping up every loose end.
Murph and Paul meet various people while painting fences and fixing
gazebos, but once the scenes end, those characters disappear from the
film.  It's a bold move, especially when you consider that some of those
roles are played by some pretty established actors – like Ian Hart
(Wonderland), Campbell Scott (The Impostors) and Peri Gilpin (Frasier).
But this technique allows viewers to concentrate on the fantastically
realistic performances given by Beatty and Schreiber.</P>
