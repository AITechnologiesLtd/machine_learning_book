<PRE>                               MEDITERRANEO
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>90 min., not rated, Drama, 1992, In Italian with English subtitles
Director: Gabriele Salvatores
Cast: Diego Abatantuono, Claudio Bigaglili, Guiseppe Cederna,
      Claudio Bilso, Luigi Alberti, Ugo Conti, Memo Dini,
      Vasco Mirandola, Luigi Montini, Irene Grazioli, Antonio Catania,
      Vanna Barba</P>
<P>     Several Italian soldiers are sent to a Greek island for four
months.  After they arrive, their ship gets blown up.  At first the
island appears to be empty, but the soldiers who are cut off from the
world soon, find the villagers.  The soldiers have to start new lives on
the island because they can't get off of it.</P>
<P>     MEDITERRANEO is a wonderful film, and I strongly urge you to go see
it.  The film completely entertained me for the full hour and a half,
but I wished that it was longer because I found myself wanting to know
more about the soldiers.  I am really glad that I got to go see this
film and I feel that it is worth full ticket price, whatever it is.  On
a scale of zero to five, I give MEDITERRANEO a five.  MEDITERRANEO is
not rated but contains female nudity, adult situations, and explicit
language.</P>
<P>     The locations used for the film were great; the island is
beautiful, especially in the mountain country and in the bay area.  The
shots overlooking the ocean are fascinating and really made me want to
go visit this island.  The people on the island were well portrayed,
which added to the film.</P>
<P>     The film has comedy sprinkled through it, which I found made the
film more enjoyable.  I tend to like a film better when it makes me
laugh a few times.  The plot is not overpowering and is one that I don't
think I have seen before.  The soldiers were interesting people, they
were given personalities, traits, hobbies, etc.  The actors who
portrayed the soldiers did a great job.  I am glad that this film won an
Oscar for the best foreign language film in the 1992 Oscars because I
feel that it really deserved it.</P>
<P>     MEDITERRANEO I think is the best film that I have seen this year
and ranks as one of my favorite films out of all the films that I have
seen.  It is just a great film in its cinematography, directing, acting,
and story line.  If you tend to like foreign films, definitely go see
this one even if you have to travel to do so.</P>
