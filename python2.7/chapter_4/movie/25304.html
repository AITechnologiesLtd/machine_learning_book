<PRE>                          DISNEY'S THE KID
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A successful image consultant who
          is rude to just about everybody gets a look at
          how he turned out the way he did by meeting an
          eight-year-old version of himself.  Even
          attributing much of what is going on in this
          film to magic, there is a lot that does not make
          sense.  This is a mildly entertaining comedy for
          those who do not think too deeply about the
          logic of their films.  Rating: 5 (0 to 10), low
          +1 (-4 to +4)  A minor spoiler follows the
          review asking where we have seen this plot
          before.</PRE>
<P>     Russell Morely Duritz (played by Bruce Willis) is an image
consultant.  He is very successful at this.  Unconcerned, he uses
his talents to make society's slimeballs acceptable to the public.
His assistant Amy (Emily Mortimer) tries to get him to reform him,
but he ignores her efforts.  Lately however, Russell's life does
seem to be unraveling.  He is seeing a red bi-plane flying overhead
and occasionally buzzing his convertible.  Nobody else seems to see
it.  There is a young child who seems to be breaking into Russell's
property.  But proof that what is happening is not in the realm of
the natural is that this Rusty (Spenser Breslin) turns out to be
Russell at age eight.  This is an opportunity for Russell to see
himself at age eight and come to understand better where he came
from.  Rusty gets a chance to see what he will really become: no
wife, no dog, in short a loser.</P>
<P>     Questions about what is going on in this film come in two
types.  One type is things that we can gloss over with the
explanation it is all magic, the other flavor is real logic flaws.
We can say that the fact Russell has very little memory of this
strange interlude is magical.  Part of the process is wiping the
memories clear.  It is a lot harder to explain why Russell remembers
so little of his life at age eight.  It is almost like he is delving
into the life of a stranger.</P>
<P>     DISNEY'S THE KID is light fantasy of the sort that when it
works, you get a magical film like a BEING JOHN MALKOVICH or even a
JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO.  Here the magic makes the story run, but the
magical never takes hold of the viewer.  It seems like a strange
complaint but this film has a serious lack of Wonder and the
Wonderful.</P>
<P>     Bruce Willis and Spencer Breslin do act well together.  There
is a certain chemistry between them.  They do play off each other
well.  Lily Tomlin is present to be a voice of reason, Janet,
Russell's righteous secretary.  Similarly principled is Russell's
assistant Amy played by Emily Mortimer of THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS
and currently of LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST.</P>
<PRE>     The problem is not that THE KID is lacking in magic, but that
too much of the magic does not really work.  I rate it a 5 on the 0
to 10 scale and a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
<P>     Spoiler...Spoiler...Spoiler...Spoiler.. .</P>
<P>     I think the breezy summertime look of this film belies its
actual origins.  We have the story of a man nasty to people in and
out of his profession.  He is happy to go through life with no human
ties except to his employees whom he abuses.  He has little thought
about the future he is making.  Then through supernatural agencies
he is confronted with his past, his present, and his future.
Suddenly he knows what he wants in life and it transforms him into a
loving and generous man.  He will be good to his employees and will
have human ties.  Isn't this a plot we have seen someplace before?
Maybe it might be connected to some December holiday?</P>
