<PRE>                            THE WEDDING BANQUET
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Winston Chao, Mitchell Lichtenstein, May Lin, Sihung Lung
           and Ah-Leh Gua.
Screenwriters:  Ang Lee, Neil Peng and James Schamus.
Director:  Ang Lee.</P>
<P>     While watching THE WEDDING BANQUET (currently in limited release),
I found myself thinking that it would have a very good short.  This
Taiwanese-American comedy about generational and cultural conflict has
fifty minutes of genuine energy stretched into an hour and fifty minute
film.  There are moments of real charm and insight, but ultimately the
sluggish pace doesn't hold them together.</P>
<P>     Wei-Tung (Winston Chao) and Simon (Mitchell Lichtenstein) are a
gay couple living together in Manhattan.  Taiwanese immigrant Wei-Tung
is constantly being badgered by his parents, still in Taiwan, to get
married and produce a grandchild.  Wei-Tung responds by listing
"impossibly high specifications" for his ideal woman, but when Ma Gao
finds a woman who fits the bill, Simon proposes a plan.  Wei-Tung will
marry Wei-Wei (May Lin), a tenant in a building owned by Wei-Tung and
an immigrant without a green card.  Ma and Pa Gao get a wedding,
Wei-Wei gets a green card, and Wei-Tung gets a welcome tax write-off.
However, Ma and Pa (Ah-Leh Gua and Sihung Lung) insist on coming to
America for the wedding.  Shamed by the simple civil ceremony preferred
by their son, Wei-Tung's parents accept an offer by a family friend to
throw a lavish wedding banquet for friends and well-wishers.  The
banquet then leads to ... complications.</P>
<P>     There are several thematic threads in THE WEDDING BANQUET, all
with interesting possibilities.  There is the intriguing romantic
triangle of Simon, Wei-Tung and Wei-Wei (who confesses a weakness for
attractive gay men); there is the issue of values conflict between
non-Americans and their Americanized offspring.  Foremost, there is the
issue of living up to parental expectations which have nothing to do
with who you are as a person.  This latter area receives the most
attention, but like the others it is given somewhat short shrift.
Director and co-scripter Ang Lee seems to want his film to be about too
many different things, without giving sufficient attention to any of
them.  Consequently, the pacing is fitful, and THE WEDDING BANQUET
wanders.</P>
<P>     There are, as I've noted, some very clever set pieces.  In one
scene, Simon and Wei-Tung prepare for the parents' arrival by racing
around their apartment removing all evidence of their gay lifestyle.
The civil ceremony, with Wei-Wei malapropping her vows in broken
English, is also a hoot.  The centerpiece, however, is the lavish
banquet.  It's a whimsical sequence, as Wei-Tung tries to carry off his
charade in front of hundreds of friends, including some raucous college
buddies.  These individual moments almost add up, but they don't
quite.</P>
<P>     Much of the responsibility for this lack of engagement falls on
the shoulders of the two male leads.  Chao, a first time actor, never
invests Wei-Tung with any real depth.  He seems capable of only one
expression:  eyes downcast, jaw clenched in dismay.  While his
situation is certainly a difficult one, at times he seems such a drudge
we wonder why Simon loves him, let alone why Wei-Wei might want to
"convert" him.  Lichtenstein too is far too wooden, making Simon's
genuine frustration over having to hide himself come off as simple
petulance.  He also has a scene with Lung as Wei-Tung's father which
could have been truly touching were he capable of showing any emotion
with his face.  Fortunately, there are good performances to somewhat
balance theirs, most notably Lung, who does some wonderful physical
acting, and May Lin, who sparkles as Wei-Wei.  Unfortunately, her
character is sadly underwritten, as are most of the roles.  The lulls
in the pace would have been acceptable had strong characters been
present to pull me along, but I was simply never caught up enough in
their lives.</P>
<P>     It's difficult not to recommend THE WEDDING BANQUET, since it's
heart seems so firmly in the right place.  It has its moments, and the
themes of familial conflict may strike a chord with many viewers.
However, I just never found myself caring quite enough, and I found
myself looking at my watch too frequently.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 wedding gifts:  5.</PRE>
