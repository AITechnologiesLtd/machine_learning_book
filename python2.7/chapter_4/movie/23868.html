<P>   The troubles in Northern Ireland--the conflict between the
British troops who are stationed in two Irish counties and the
IRA forces which long to drive them out--are an obvious
source of high drama for film makers.  Consider Terry
George's 1996 emotion-charged "Some Mother's Son," a
true-life story of a hunger strike staged by a jailed IRA
member in the early 1980s, starring Helen Mirren as a
prisoner's mother who is forced to become involved.  Think
also of the more passionate "In the Name of the Father," Jim
Sheridan's 1993 release about a young and innocent ne'er-
do-well in Belfast accused by British police of a terrorist
bombing.</P>
<P>   If we judge movies about the 20th Century conflict between
British and Irish according to the directors' passion, "The Last
September" wouldn't have a chance.  But veteran theater
chief Deborah Warner has other things going for her in her
debut at the helm of a film.  The first is that she has adopted
Elizabeth Bowen's novel to the screen, a work of fiction
dealing with an episode that has received surprisingly little
attention given the interest in the centuries' old conflict.  The
second is that she has utilized Slawomir Idziak's camera in a
creative way to stylize quite a number of shots to show the
historical continuity of the family she portrays.  To her credit,
Warner has effectively translated an essentially literary work
into a cinematic vision--but one which is not without
drawbacks.</P>
<P>   "The Last September" is a 1920's Chekhovian tale of an
aristocratic Anglo-Irish family headed by Sir Richard Naylor
(Michael Gambon) and his wife Lady Myra (Maggie Smith). =</P>
<P>They own a lavish estate known as Danielstown in County
Cork in an area surrounded by relatively poor merchants and
are protected by elements of the British army led by Captain
Gerald Colthurst (David Tennant).  Though the Naylors
consider themselves Irish for having lived in that country for
most of their lives, to outward appearances they are
absolutely British.  Among their guests are a 19-year-old
orphaned niece, Lois Farquar (Keeley Hawes) and the
mischievous 30-year-old Marda Norton (Fiona Shaw) who has
had various affairs and is debating whether to marry an
English stockbroker whom she does not love.  =</P>
<P>   While the story ostensibly centers on Sir Richard and Lady
Myra, Warner's principal concern is the youthful Lois, a high-
spirited woman who is eager to see what love is all about and
is attracted to a roguish Irish terrorist, Peter Connolly (Gary
Lydon)--who is hiding out in an unused barn of the estate. =</P>
<P>Warner allows us to observe the idiosyncratic owners of the
estate who are given to alternately cryptic and witty
statements about love and politics.  In one quietly humorous
exchange, Sir Richard gives instructions to the clueless
captain--who is in love with a not-too-interested Lois--the
captain hanging on every utterance but not understanding a
word.  In a similar exchange between the captain and Lady
Myra, the woman of the estate advises the soldier in no
uncertain terms that Lois would never marry a man so
obviously beneath her station.  (Maggie Smith is, as she was
in "Tea With Mussolini," a lady who is above it all, one who
has seen everything and would insist on her afternoon tea
even if she were in the midst of a battlefield.) The real
surprise of the picture is Keeley Hawes, who had complained
that she is always cast as an older woman but now gets her
chance to portray an adolescent who acts as a 19-year-old
woman would act in just about any country in the West.</P>
<P>   The political situation is never too far from the polite, if
acerbic, discussions.  We become privy to the execution of a
black-and-tan (British soldier) by a terrorist and the
subsequent liquidation of yet another British soldier by a
fighter determined to drive the English out of their country. =</P>
<P>We cannot help feeling sad for the Naylors and their entire
household, who are aware--like the characters in Chekhov's
"The Cherry Orchard"--that a lacy era is ending and a way of
life is to be forsaken.  The pace is awfully slow but to keep
an audience involved, the camera plays tricks that often
seem employed for the sake of copying the Merchant-Ivory
genre.  As Lois looks through her telescope, the audience
gets a closeup of her eye and catches what she observes as
she slowly focuses and spins her instrument about the
landscape.  In another scene we witness the going-on in a
room of the estate through the keyhole.  "The Last
September" is so ethereal that Warner appears at times to
challenge her viewers to sit without fidgeting with the promise
of coming away with a better understanding of a fading
epoch.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 103 minutes.  (C) 2000
