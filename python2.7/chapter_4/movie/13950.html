A Movie Review by David Sunga </PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Joseph Ruben</PRE>
<P>Written by: Bruce Robinson, Wesley Strick</P>
<P>Starring: Anne Heche, Joaquin Phoenix, Vince Vaughn, David Conrad</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
The setting of RETURN TO PARADISE is the real-life Muslim nation of
Malaysia, where all prostitution is illegal, and drug dealing and
sufficient possession are met with capital punishment. People bow in
Islamic prayer at prescribed times of the day. Crime in general is
harshly dealt with.</P>
<P>Enter Lewis McBride (Joaquin Phoenix), and his buddies Sheriff (Vince
Vaughn) and Tony (David Conrad). They are three culturally disrespectful
young guys, who treat women like objects and indulge themselves with
copious amounts of marijuana. Sheriff and Tony escape to the United
States to become 'respectable,' but unknown to them Lewis gets caught
and predictably sentenced to death for drugs. </P>
<P>Lawyer Beth Eastern (Anne Heche) informs Sheriff and Tony that Lewis has
received the death penalty, but mentions there's a possibility of Lewis
avoiding death if the two partners return to Malaysia to stand trial.
Can she pay or otherwise convince the cowardly and irresponsible men to
return to Malaysia to rightfully serve time for their offenses?</P>
<P>Opinion: 
Back in the old days, if you broke a neighbor's window, you paid for it.
In the post-Watergate era the mentality shifted to "Everybody does it.
It's only a crime if you get caught." Now, as prosecutor Kenneth Starr
might observe, we have whiny, apparently guilty offenders with one foot
in prison and the other foot in the grave, insisting, "I didn't even do
anything! Why am I being persecuted?" </P>
<P>I'm a proponent of the concept of "audience justice" in movies. When I
see some B-movie RAMBO wannabe arrogantly announce, "I know this JUNGLE
like the back of my hand," I know in my gut that Mr. Know-it-all is
going to bite the big one sometime during the movie. RETURN TO PARADISE
seems to have forgotten the notion of good old fashioned justice because
the film tries to pedastalize its Ivy League heroes - - make them seem
noble and glamorous when in fact, there's nothing particularly
enlightening about pampered whiners who cry out for preferential prison
treatment on the basis of class, when in fact they are guilty as sin.
"Hey, man, we didn't do anything wrong because we were on vacation, so
we deserve better treatment than the locals." </P>
<P>Speaking of bad old days, back in ancient cowboy and Indian movies it
was considered okay to portray Native Americans as "the only good Indian
is a dead Indian" if the cowboys were the main characters and
sufficiently handsome. As a modern American I had thought the days of
tap dancing kewpie doll servants and Frito Banditos were over, but
apparently the emphasis has merely shifted to Asia. RETURN TO PARADISE
is, unfortunately, a film that proliferates the unwelcome stereotype of
Asian women as gold-digging island sluts and prostitutes while the
film's Asian men are portrayed as ugly, bantering drug dealers or
sadistic faceless prison guards who bark incredibly ferociously, just to
say "enter" in Malay. In RETURN TO PARADISE, Muslims/Asians in this film
constitute a faceless race -- a barbaric, dehumanized, anti-white
"other." This is an unconscionable example of modern cinematic race
baiting.</P>
<P>I don't REALLY mind movies about moral yutzes. Nor do I mind in general
when a fictional movie portrays fictional characters on a fictional
island having sensationalistic adventures. As long as they're not naming
names and singling folks out for racist caricatures. </P>
<P>But in RETURN TO PARADISE some good, kind, decent, technologically
advanced folks - - are referenced specifically by location ("Penang,
Malaysia") and singled out for overwhelming negativity. I have visited
Penang and found it not too much different than Honolulu in terms of
commercial trade, high technology, education, malls, theaters, and
general friendliness. RETURN TO PARADISE singles out these same highly
educated businessmen and women and their high tech Islamic society - -
for portrayal as ruthless overlords, pimps, degraded prostitutes and
sluts in a shantytown hell. Basically they took some GI's Subic Bay
fantasy and said, "Hey, let's call it Penang. Nobody'll notice. You know
how them Asian islands are all alike (wink nod)." This attitude is an
unpalatable throwback to shameful, feathers-and-shoe-polish, supremacist
notions in Hollywood.</P>
<P>In other respects, the cinematography and dramatic tension in RETURN TO
PARADISE are good, as is the acting. Anne Heche is skillful as the
lawyer under duress, but her chemistry with romantic lead Vince Vaughn
seems strained.</P>
