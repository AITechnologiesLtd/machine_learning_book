<PRE>You've Got Mail (1998)
**1/2 out of *****</PRE>
<PRE>Cast: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton, Dave Chappelle,
Steve Zahn, Dabney Coleman, Greg
Kinnear
Written by: Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron
Directed by: Nora Ephron
Running Time: 120 minutes</PRE>
<P>By this time, everyone knows that in these kinds of movies (romantic
comedies) the two main characters will be together by the film's end.
The question though is: Will the journey to that point in the film be
interesting enough?  In the case of You've Got Mail, the answer to
that is sadly "not really".</P>
<P>You've Got Mail reteams Sleepless in Seattle co-stars Tom Hanks and
Meg Ryan with director Nora Ephron for a remake of the 1940 James
Stewart classic The Shop Around the Corner.  In this modern retelling,
Ryan is a small book store owner in New York City who faces
competition from a multi-millionaire's (Tom Hanks) new book megastore
which opens up down the street from her.  The two square off in real
life, but little do they know that they are actually in love with each
other thanks to their anonymous communications via email.</P>
<P>As far as the film goes, everything seems rather distant and
uninvolved.  The original seemed to have much more emotion and depth
to it, and you would think a remake would only take things further.
Instead, everything seems slightly contrived and lacking real emotion.</P>
<P>I enjoyed Tom Hanks performance, as it seems I always do, but I'm
getting tired of seeing Meg Ryan play the exact same person in every
single movie she's in, that character being "the sweet girl involved
with the wrong guy".  You'll wish there was more time to devote to the
supporting cast, particularly Greg Kinnear who vanishes mid-way
through the film without any explanation whatsoever.  He's the "wrong
guy" dating Meg Ryan's character... who by the way is never really
made to look like the "wrong guy".  He's a little odd, but definately
not a bad guy in any way, shape, or form.  And independent film queen
Parker Posey... what on earth is she doing in an actual studio film
that people will see?</P>
<P>A quick note about the score for the film.  It sounds exactly like the
music in our local Winn-Dixie grocery store commercials that everytime
the main theme would play, I'd recite the words for the store's jingle
in my head.  It was a minor annoyance to me, but I'm positive no one
else in the country picked up on it.</P>
<P>You've Got Mail is available on DVD from Warner Home Video.  It
contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  Special
features on the DVD include the HBO First Look:A Conversation with
Nora Ephron documentary, a video tour of various locations in New York
City's upper west side, a feature length audio commentary with
writer-director Nora Ephron and producer Lauren Shuler Donner, an
alternate music only audio track, the usual cast and crew info and
production notes, and TWELVE theatrical trailers (two for this film,
one for the 1940 original The Shop Around The Corner, one for it's
remake In the Good Old Summertime, and eight for other films you might
enjoy, like Joe vs. the Volcano, Tin Cup and Message in a Bottle).</P>
<P>The DVD also contains a plethora of DVD-ROM features, but since I do
not have DVD-ROM access (and am pretty much against the concept
anyway) I'm not really going to go into any of them here.</P>
<P>The audio commentary for the film is pretty bland in my opinion, since
Nora Ephron just doesn't exactly ooze enthusiasm.  Producer Donner
does seem fairly excited to talk about the film, but 1) she sounds
like she's not wearing a microphone and is hovering behind Ephron in
the recording studio, and 2) Ephron cuts her off and talks over her on
numerous occasions.  Add all that to the fact that they're talking
about a movie that just didn't do a whole lot for me and you've got
one mediocre commentary.  The HBO documentary is equally blah, as it's
mainly just a sit down interview with Nora Ephron.  Although, the
documentary does have one highlight: there's a quick scene in it
that's not in the film itself with Meg Ryan and Greg Kinnear sitting
in a movie theater.  Had it been kept in the final cut I would call it
my favorite moment in the film.  [PG]</P>
