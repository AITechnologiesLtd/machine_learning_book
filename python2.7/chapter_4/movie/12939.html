<P>Who would have thought that Fox would have chosen a subject as
controversial as the dead Romanovs, to be the topic of their first
animated musical. But I guess if Disney got away with cashing in on a
little Indian Princess who dies of small pox in reality, then the issues
surrounding Anastasia Romanov, the surviving heiress of the great Czars
of Russia, is as much up for grabs as any other little princess.</P>
<P>I wasn't expecting much, but look it's got Meg Ryans voice and
mannerisms tied into the character of Anya – and anything with Meg Ryan
can't be bad. Importantly, the music is lively - if not as memorable as
the Disney greats, certainly much better than the recent Herculean Epic
of recent past year. Engaging us with the mysteries of whether this girl
is truly the last surviving Russian princess, we are swept off our feet
with Anastasia in her discovery of not only her heritage but also of
herself. Making a viable romantic interest and bantering partner is John
Cusack, as Dimitri, the kitchen-boy-turned-con-man. Other notable notes
are Rasputin (John Lloyd), a Russian mystical figure who places a curse
on the Romanov's. In reality very little is known about him, as much so
as the missing grand duchess.</P>
<P>So don't expect a historical lesson from this version of Anastasia, but
expect instead to be moderately entertained by flighty tunes that linger
in your mind as you stroll through the park on a winter's morn. The kids
will enjoy much of the commotion, the girls because the heroine is a
girl, and the boys may even take a liking to the evil Rasputin – but to
tell you frankly, the scenes in Hell, scarred the hell out of me.
Overall, good family entertainment.</P>
