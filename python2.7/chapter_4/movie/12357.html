<P>     Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the star of the most popular show in 
the history of television.  For 10,909 days, it has been on the air, 
using 5000 cameras to show every moment in every day of the life of one 
man.  The public loves it -- there are Truman addicts who go to sleep 
with the TV on and who have sets installed in the bathroom so they don't 
miss anything when they're taking a bath.  Every individual in "The 
Truman Show" is an actor with one important exception:  the lead 
character himself.  For, while everyone around Truman is playing a part, 
he is cheerfully ignorant about the truth.  He thinks this is all real, 
and his obliviousness to the situation gives the program its core appeal 
-- that there's nothing counterfeit about Truman.  One day, however, 
when a former member of the cast sneaks back onto the set with a warning 
for the star, Truman begins to suspect that appearances can be 
deceiving.</P>
<P>     For those who bemoan Hollywood's consistent lack of originality (as 
I frequently do), THE TRUMAN SHOW is a welcome surprise.  Over the 
years, there have been many satires about the power of television, but 
none has taken this route.  Director Peter Weir, whose past credits 
include WITNESS, DEAD POETS SOCIETY, and FEARLESS, has wed this 
cautionary tale about media strength with a surprisingly affecting (if 
somewhat uneven) drama about one man's search for the meaning of life.  
The only thing I wonder is whether something this quirky will be able to 
find a large enough audience to justify the budget.</P>
<P>     Paramount Pictures is clearly using THE TRUMAN SHOW as an example 
of summer counterprogramming.  The movie opens up a scant two weeks 
after GODZILLA and announces its intentions with the first line:  "We're 
tired of pyrotechnics and special effects…"  But are we?  More 
importantly, is Jim Carrey's draw strong enough to pack theaters showing 
this movie, especially when his role here is light years away from the 
zany character he usually plays?  And how badly will marketing THE 
TRUMAN SHOW as a comedy hurt the movie when viewers realize that's not 
what it is?  These questions, which lie at the heart of the picture's 
hope for success, will be answered fairly quickly once it is released.</P>
<P>     For Carrey detractors who are easily turned off by the comic's 
rubber-faced antics, THE TRUMAN SHOW proves to be an eye-opener.  Not 
only does Carrey remain rigidly-controlled and reigned in, but it would 
be fair to call his performance both understated and effective.  
Exhibiting the charm and charisma of a Tom Hanks or even a young Jimmy 
Stewart, Carrey develops the sort of likable personae that a movie of 
this sort needs to succeed.  He is ably supported by a cast that 
includes Laura Linney as Truman's TV wife, Natascha McElhone as his one 
true love, Noah Emmerich as his best friend, and Ed Harris as "God," the 
TV program's creator and director.  </P>
<P>     Most movies today run far too long, but THE TRUMAN SHOW is actually 
too short.  A considerable amount of worthwhile material goes 
unexplored.  (For example, one question that is never answered is 
whether Truman actually has sex with his actress-wife.)  I would have 
liked to know something about the personal pressures faced by the actors 
in "The Truman Show" and more about the incredibly complex logistics of 
controlling and filming the entire life of one man.  Narratively, the 
film is a little rough around the edges, as if a lot more was filmed 
than what shows up on-screen, but, although the flow may be off a 
little, it's not difficult to follow what's going on.</P>
<P>     Stylistically, THE TRUMAN SHOW uses an interesting approach, 
intercutting documentary-like interviews and lengthy excerpts from the 
program (these can be identified by the elliptical matte around the 
frame) with "real life" footage of the director and behind-the-scenes 
people.  Weir isn't the first film maker to apply this technique (it's a 
"mockumentary" staple), but he uses it to good effect, and it works well 
in the context of this movie.  As far as overt satire and comedy go, the 
obvious use of product placements gets some of the biggest laughs and 
several of the "fear of travel" posters (designed to keep Truman from 
venturing outside of his created hometown of Seahaven) are hilarious.</P>
<P>     As an intriguing, well-written piece of entertainment and a mild 
social commentary, THE TRUMAN SHOW deserves high marks.  Not everything 
in the film works, and the script isn't perhaps as deep or incisive as 
it would like us to believe, but there's enough here to mark THE TRUMAN 
SHOW as a worthwhile motion picture -- an appealing, offbeat, one-
hundred minute diversion for those who really are tired of monsters 
tearing down buildings and action heroes saving the world.  </P>
