<PRE>TOO MUCH SLEEP
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2001 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The most striking revelation about the indie comedy-drama "Too Much Sleep"
is just how much it highlights the schizophrenic tendencies of its
fledgling director, David Maquiling.</P>
<P>Now Maquiling, a graduate of NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, can set up a
shot well enough, from the sleepy suburban opener of a young boy playing
with his Tonka trucks in the grass, to a Deli-ful of old duffers who sit
around waxing idiotic.  But often the scenarios that play out within
Maquiling's excellent frame are scattershot and self-consciously told.</P>
<P>Likewise Maquiling has a perceptive eye for character; his film is
populated with colorful brethren indeed.  There's our hero, Jack Crawford
(Marc Palmieri), the security guard who's distracted by a beautiful woman
on a bus, loses his gun, and spends the rest of the movie trying to find it
in the heat and the hostility of northern New Jersey.  There's the
beautiful woman herself (Nicol Zanzarella), a slight, diaphanous creature
who appears as if from out of nowhere, haloed by the blazing midday sun.
There's a funny guy with "connections" who helps Jack retrieve his missing
piece (as played by Pasquale Gaeta, Eddie's a character with a capital C).
And then there's Jack's mother, just a voice off-screen.</P>
<P>These are all finely written roles, all shapely individuals in one way or
another.</P>
<P>But the director's ability to create unique characterizations is undone by
his failure to cast competent performers in the roles; there's amateurism
run rampant here I'm afraid.  A lot is asked of Palmieri and frankly he
doesn't have the presence to be on-screen as long as he is (and this is a
short movie, relatively speaking: 86 minute's worth).  Kate (Zanzarella) is
really only asked to look good and with that she complies.  Gaeta is
amusing though.  He's no De Niro (although a lot of the time he sounds like
him) and his constant profanity--"if you pardon my profanity"--soon
develops a comforting, lyrical quality.  He's clearly the best of the bunch
and well utilized by the director.  Think Joe Pesci's funny uncle.</P>
<P>Maquiling, too, has an ear for dialogue.  Unfortunately it's a tone-deaf
one for the most part.  He can create manic, "After Hours"-styled
pandemoniums populated by complex and witty individuals but he has the
hardest time coming up with a line of dialogue that doesn't sound forced or
just plain awkward.  At times he seems to be trying too hard.  Some
improvisation might have helped the film considerably rather than having
the actors constantly forced to reel off the director's stilted conversations.</P>
<P>You would think that this schizophrenic style--everything coming together
at one point, everything falling apart the next--would tend to even itself
out after a while but it doesn't.  Both scenarios are frustrating because
they speak to what might have been.  "Too Much Sleep" has potential written
all over it; Maquiling knows what he's about and, with a little maturation
in the writing and casting departments, he's going to impress soon enough.</P>
<P>Not this time though.  "Too Much Sleep" is an unsatisfying mix that just
leaves one feeling overtired.</P>
