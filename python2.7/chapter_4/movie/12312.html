<PRE> Two Girls and a Guy (1997)</PRE>
<P>  Seen on 26 April 1998 for $8.50 with Laura at Angelika.</P>
<P>   Not knowing much about *2 Girls and a Guy*, I went into it
   without any preconceived notions or expectations. It started out
   interestingly enough, as two women standing on the steps of a Sohoi
   loft slowly discover the boyfriend they hoping to surprise upon his
   return from London is in fact the same boyfriend, Blake (Robert Downey
   Jr.). Carla (Heather Graham, most recently seen as Boogie Night's
   "Rollergirl") is tall, blonde, refined, and innocent looking. Lou
   (Natasha Wagner) is short, dark-haired, speaks in streetsmart tones,
   and has no problem scaling a fire escape and breaking into Blake's
   window so the two can really surprise him upon his return.</P>
<P>   The first 45 minutes to an hour of this movie work very well, as the
   two cuckolded women bond as they rehash all of Blake's lines and
   realize he's been seeing both of them for almost the same length of
   time--ten months. As Carla, wide-eyed, recites Blake's romantic
   mantras, Lou is able to finish them, word for word. The fun,
   therefore, is really supposed to begin when Blake returns and the
   women confront him and turn tables on him.</P>
<P>   Blake does return and immediately calls his mother. We learn from
   Carla and Lou that he is fixated on his mother. This plays prominently
   into the film, and it is interesting to see Downey tune the women out
   to call his mother, and then her doctor, and completely focus on
   everything but them.</P>
<P>   This movie takes place completely in Blake's loft, so it is
   interesting to see how director James Toback is able to keep it from
   getting too claustrophobic, and too talky, like My Dinner with Andre.</P>
<P>   However, the move takes a sharp left turn halfway through and never
   quite recovers. The things you might expect and look forward to do not
   happen, and instead, the films ends unsatisfactorily. Considering the
   sharp emotions and strong start the movie made, it is
   disappointing--to say the least--to see the characters do things no
   one would ever do, and basically wimp out.</P>
<P>   Despite the script, Downey and Graham sustain a level of energy that
   still keeps you wondering what is going to happen, way after that bad
   turn is made. Wagner's performance, however, despite promising
   delivery in the first half, peters out and leaves you unimpressed.
   Watching three characters that are eventually revealed to be
   emotionally confused is not for everyone. It's hard to figure out
   whether the conclusions we can draw are that a) the director is
   misogynist, or b) "Why try being honest with people? Life is so
   futile?"</P>
<P>   CINEMA FAN NOTE: In the loft you will notice a poster for Truffaut's
   film Jules et Jim, a movie about 2 Guys and a Girl.</P>
