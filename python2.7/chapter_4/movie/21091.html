<P>   A colleague of mine loved the Walt Disney production of
"The Straight Story" because, he said, this was the first
movie he ever saw about Midwesterners that showed them a
proper respect. Of course a film needs more than a respectful
consideration of its subjects, however stereotyped they may
be in real life, but that deference to the Ralph Farnsworth
character and everyone he meets on the road from Iowa to
Wisconsin did it for him.</P>
<P>   If the converse is true, than this associate of mine would
turn thumbs down on "Boys Don't Cry," based on a real story
of horror which took place during the early 1990s in the state
of Nebraska.  The beer-swilling, chain-smoking, white-trash
personalities who dominate the tale are enough to drive
anyone insane and leave no one immune to their
psychological and physical abuse.  "Boys Don't Cry," which
opened to rave reviews at the '99 New York Film Festival, is
an unusual film, one with the qualities of fine acting and a
sincere, realistic approach to the its morbid subject matter,
but somehow the pieces do not coalesce into an engaging
film.  Overlong at almost two hours, this story deals with a
woman pretending to be a man, and if it were comic to the
slightest degree we could say it had Shakespearean
undertones.  "Boys Don't Cry" is largely melodramatic, its
director averse to slipping in a moment of comic relief.  At the
helm, Kimberly Peirce does a swell job highlighting the
troubles of a person seeking inner peace and freedom who
does knows the popular movie expression "Let's get out of
here," but seems unable to follow the advice.  But the central
character does not evoke the pity she should from the
audience despite the Oscar-caliber performance that Hilary
Swank puts into her.  Somehow, her murder leaves us cold,
not so much because she is too naive, too obtuse to sense
the danger she is in, but because she comes across as a
person that only a mother (and, in this case, just two other
characters) could love.</P>
<P>   Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), who appears in virtually
every scene, is a young woman who is physically attracted to
other women, yet insists that she is not a lesbian.  This
insight could be a valid one: she does not consider herself to
be a woman at all.  While paying lip service to the
psychological label "sexual identity crisis," she is simply a
man in a woman's body, and one day, leaving the young man
who cares for her and has allowed her to sleep in his home,
she cut her hair short leaving a cute cowlick over her
forehead, tapes her breasts tightly and inserts a sock into her
undergarments.  Changing her name minimally from Teena
Brandon to Brandon Teena, she leaves Lincoln, Nebraska
and in one instance in a speeding car almost literally flies in
the face of her newfound freedom.  Meeting up with some
white trash in the backwoods of Nebraska, she is attracted to
the delicate teen, Lana (Chloe Sevigny) who reciprocates
Brandon's love, and in one erotic scene Brandon seems to
convince the young woman that she is having sex with a
man.</P>
<P>   Ultimately, the confused Brandon is raped and murdered by
a pair of sociopathic backwoodsmen, John (Peter Sarsgaard)
and Tom (Brendan Sexton III)--who play their roles to the
villainous hilt as men who are incensed that Brandon had lied
to them daily.  Still, the script--written by director Peirce
together with Andy Bienen--does not clarify the motives for
the murder.  Are they repelled by Brandon's seduction of
Lana?  Are they furious that they were themselves
compatriots of a lesbian and felt dishonored by the
prevarication?</P>
<P>   "Boys Don't Cry," then, is one of those movies in which all
the qualities of fine cinema are present.  The ensemble
acting is splendid, the murder gruesomely portrayed, the
lovemaking unaffected.  What nullifies these attributes is our
inability to feel much for a pitiful victim who, if properly
moneyed with a supportive family could have easily solved
her sexual identity problem with plastic surgery.  </P>
<PRE>Rated R.  Running Time: 116 minutes.  (C) 1999
