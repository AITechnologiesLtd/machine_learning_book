<P>Once upon a time, not too long ago, it used to be that one film company
held a vertiable monopoly on the animated feature film market. Disney,
and moreover their distributing company Buena Vista Pictures, has long
since lost the monopoly, but their success there hasn't quite been
overcome. QUEST FOR CAMELOT, Warner Brothers' entry, and 1997's
ANASTASIA, Twentieth Century Fox's product, still do not compare to
Disney's films. Although Fox's parlay was excusable because of their
lack of animation history, this WB attempt should've had the feel of a
finely-tuned machine. After all, it's the same company that turned out
timeless characters like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Wile E. Coyote.
Unfortunately, it falls well short of benchmark. </P>
<P>There's a lot of formula and a lot of "girl power" in this movie,
although the target audience - loveable little scamps in the coveted
ten-and-under bracket - won't be quick to realize either. Of course, the
little ones in pink will be more attached to the lead character of
Kayley (Jessalyn Gilsig) than will the little ones in blue, but there's
enough comedy and action to go around. As for formula, the typical crowd
is about: there's your generic, chivalrous good guys (in this case, King
Arthur, voiced by Pierce Brosnan) who are generally helpful but stand to
encounter a setback early on. This starts the plot in motion. Then you
have your over-the-top cartoon villain, who is the inspiration of said
setback (in this case the disgruntled knight Ruber, voiced by Gary
Oldman). Finally you have your unlikely hero(es), who will take the
place of aforementioned good guys in the face of adversity - in this
case, Kayley, the tomboyish daughter of a knight, and Garrett (Cary
Elwes), a blind hermit. </P>
<P>The movie begins with some enjoyable scenes that get to the action right
away. Ruber sends a giant griffin (Bronson Pinchot) to Camelot to steal
Arthur's magical sword Excalibur, but the beast loses the weapon while
returning it back to his boss and it's lost in the Forbidden Forest.
Kayley learns of this when Ruber kidnaps her mother (Jane Seymour) as
ransom for his entry into Camelot, and the girl escapes, being chased by
Ruber's henchmen into the Forbidden Forest. It's there that she meets up
with Garrett, and while being persued by Ruber and company, they come
upon Devon and Cornwall, a two-headed dragon with an appetite for
comedy. The four- er ... threesome then locates the sword and makes
their way back to Camelot just as Ruber arrives, too. </P>
<P>There is the music, which is included in homage to the extensive line of
Disney films which have employed the stuff since the inception of the
animated feature. Unfortunately, it lacks a lot of the drama and
flamboyance of typical Disney music; rather than looking like a stage
production, it appears to be what it really is - an entire township
singing in unison. It might almost be laughable, but most who watch this
movie will be caught up in the kiddish atmosphere. The characters here
are an improvement on the rather dry ones found in ANASTASIA, although
it'll be quite some time before they're up to the standards of Disney's
sketches. The star rating for this movie is all based on effort; this
surely won't compare when MULAN thunders into theaters later this year.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "QUEST FOR CAMELOT": 2.5 stars - an enjoyable movie.</P>
