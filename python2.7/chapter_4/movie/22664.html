<PRE>Sleepy Hollow  (1999)  111m</PRE>
<P>Did you ever see that short Disney cartoon when you were a kid, the one 
about the Headless Horseman?  Do you remember the wild finale, a mixture of 
scary slapstick, which had Ichabod Crane galloping for dear life towards the 
bridge that marked that essential piece of childhood myth, the Line Of 
Safety.  Tim Burton remembers, and I find it perfectly suitable that the 
former (though briefly-tenured) Disney animator should produce a live-action 
elaboration of that short piece.  Here's another gem from the Burton 
repertoire, and one which few others would have attempted in this day and 
age: a good old-fashioned horror film.</P>
<P>Set firmly in the 18th century and occupying a universe all of its own 
(although strongly derived from the Hammer films of the late 60s and early 
70s), SLEEPY HOLLOW succeeds because it refuses the self-deprecating 
concessions film-makers almost seem obliged to put in their films nowadays.  
No one-liners.  No provision for a sequel.  Its only nudge to the audience 
is a well-timed millennium reference (and, intentionally or not, a couple of 
images from THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS and PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE, the 
visages of Jack Skellington and Large Marge respectively) and 
state-of-the-art FX notwithstanding, the end result could pass muster as 
some sort of lost classic unearthed in the Hammer Studio vaults - it even 
has that distinct indigo hue and those washed-out faces.  This movie is so 
out-of-era that it's simply wonderful: not exactly a homage, not even a 
revision - it's just a crackling good Gothic Yarn.  New York constable 
Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), is sent to the small agrarian township of 
Sleepy Hollow to investigate a recent spate of decapitation murders.  The 
townsfolk blame a local legend, which Depp airily dismisses - at first.  A 
first-hand encounter with the Horseman quickly turns him into a believer.  
Depp's transition from rational scientific enquiry to supernatural and 
arcane lore works seamlessly into the story: it doesn't seem wrong to us 
that he should 'switch sides' so easily, integrating a little of both into 
his investigation.  The seeds have already been planted, after all, in the 
skewed flashbacks to his childhood (although that haunted child reminded me 
more of a young Burton than a young Depp), so the appearance of Crane as a 
well-attired adult investigator poking around crime scenes in gloomy forests 
is no more peculiar to us than it would be if we were watching an episode of 
a protean X-FILES.</P>
<P>The concerns of the plot are duly interspersed with Horror intrusions (and 
how Burton loves to see those severed heads roll!) but by its finale SLEEPY 
HOLLOW has let slip its full melodramatic glory.  The usual lightning 
flashes and explosions of shattering glass easily become the type of genre 
standards that are included only because they're expected, but by the time 
you have sat through ninety minutes of SLEEPY HOLLOW, the clichés are no 
longer clichés.  Every swirling mass of leaves and gout of blood conspires 
to produce a cinematic, gothic opera: the Headless Horseman is brutal and 
frightening; the sky is perpetually grey or stormy; the trees are black and 
twisted; everything outside is muted with dampness; the scenes of the 
countryside, the feasts, the cornshocks, the windmills and the kitchens are 
reminiscent of Dutch and Flemish masters; similarly the striking faces of 
the cast could also have been lifted from portraits (although I wish 
Christina Ricci had been left with her raven tresses instead of those blonde 
curls), indicating that Burton's visual sense of the film was inspired by 
paintings.  Irrespective of its reference points, SLEEPY HOLLOW is its own 
entity.  But if it's "supposed" to be a Hammer film, a recreation of 
17th-century art, or post-Disney trauma, then I'll vote for the last on that 
list - if only to tantalize myself with the possibility that Burton might 
have something to say about the shooting of Old Yeller or the death of 
Bambi's mom in his future projects.</P>
