<P>Oliver Stone's "U-Turn" is his best film since "J.F.K": a jagged, furious,
interminable assault on the senses with enough bloody violence, expletives and
adulterous affairs to send any sensitive Christian out the door. It is a solid
piece of unpredictable entertainment: wickedly funny and darkly comic at every
turn. </P>
<P>Based on the book "Stray Dogs" by John Ridley (who also wrote the script),
"U-Turn" stars Sean Penn as Booby Cooper, a gambler with a bag full of money
who inadvertently breaks down in the strange town of Superior, Arizona. His
troubles are just beginning: he brings his 1964 Mustang convertible with a
broken radiator hose to a sully mechanic named Darrell (Billy Bob Thornton);
his bag of money (an overdue gambling debt) is blown to bits during an
unexpected convenience store robbery; he has a fling with the sexy Grace
(Jennifer Lopez) before his nose is broken by her husband Jake (Nick Nolte) who
in turn asks him to kill his wife; he has a diner encounter with a ditsy blonde
teenager (Claire Danes) before he's repeatedly challenged to a fight by her
tough boyfriend (Joaquim Phoenix); and then there's the old, blind Indian (Jon
Voight) who teaches him moral lessons about life such as 'Nothing is nothing.
Everything is everything.' </P>
<P>"U-Turn" engages us and pushes our buttons right from the opening sequence with
a spectacular sight of the Arizona desert where a red Mustang is headed for
unwanted trouble. Bobby is not a hero, though: he's flawed, has murderous
impulses and not much of a conscience. This is the world of film noir, and we
know there are no heroes in such a world. Bobby has no qualms about killing
Jake's wife, Grace, as long as he gets the dough. But when Grace asks him to
kill Jake, split with the money and head for Hawaii, what can Bobby do? He's
confused, pathetic and headed for disaster considering a loan shark is after
him. At one point, since he lost his gambling money, he opts for just
two-hundred dollars to pay the mechanic for the damage to the car. Nobody,
however, will lend him the money. He has a little over twenty bucks left yet it
is not enough for the train ticket to Juarez, Mexico. He pleads and pleads for
it and finally convinces the ticket agent (Laurie Metcalf) to give him a break
- the guy definitely needs it but his day isn't over yet. Before you can say
existentialism, Bobby endures several beatings, tortures, backstabbing, and
double-crosses to make Franz Kafka blush. This is a world he can't escape from,
and his illicit affair with Grace could lead to more than he bargained for. Who
can he trust?</P>
<P>Oliver Stone is the perfect director for this neo-noirish, blood-soaked Western
that is reminiscent of the cult film "Red Rock West." He bludgeons the screen,
courtesy of the deft cinematographer Robert Richardson, with grainy colors,
strobe cuts, and black-and-white images. The bright colors (bright reds,
greens, and dark blacks) lend the film a baroque, cartoonish look atypical of
Stone's ouevre, but his style is more evocative of the chaos and unpredictable
surprises in Bobby's world than in "Nixon" or "Natural Born Killers." The
rapid-fire montage cutting and editing is not as wild as you might expect -
this is the first Stone film I can think of since "The Doors" where you can
actually breathe while all the sound and fury is exploding on screen. </P>
<P>As in Stone's other work, the performances are extraordinary. Sean Penn turns
in one of his finest roles as the confounded, bruised Bobby with black hair, a
bandaged hand, and slick clothes, and is more distraught than anyone else in
the movie. Nick Nolte is all fire and brimstone as the vicious, crazed
real-estate mogul Jake who has a certain obsession with Grace - his overbite
and white orange crewcut reveals a strong yet weak, disturbed man who weeps
during sex. Jennifer Lopez ("Selena") is quite captivating as the femme fatale
Grace, an Apache woman who has an incestual past revealed in quick montages -
she keeps the character cryptic to the point where we don't know if she can be
trusted anymore than if Bobby can. Billy Bob Thornton is the welcome comic
relief in this bizarre odyssey as he spews and spits with relish resembling a
revolting court jester. Claire Danes ("Romeo and Juliet") is engagingly
delirious as the girl who is attracted to Bobby - her scene in the diner where
she questions him on the disappearance of Patsy Cline is a classic. Joaquim
Phoenix is bitingly hilarious as her jealous boyfriend. Also worth mentioning
is Powers Boothe as the sheriff of Superior who may have some ties to Grace's
past, and there's also a strange cameo by Liv Tyler as a passenger at a train
station. She doesn't utter a word but most film buffs will love to see her
brief appearance anyway. </P>
<P>"U-Turn" is not a great film - there's too much time devoted to the mysterious
Grace and her predictably angry husband Jake - but it is a nice change-of-pace
for Stone. It's joltingly alive and incredibly funny. Other major pluses are
the superb performances by all, brilliant cinematography and a terrific
soundtrack full of Peggy Lee songs. "U-Turn" deserves a place in the Western
noir tablets along with "Blood Simple," "Wild at Heart" and the aforementioned
"Red Rock West." </P>
