<PRE>                          THE BONE COLLECTOR
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A surprisingly uninteresting
          psychotic killer film with a very predictable yet
          absurd solution.  Philip Noyce knows how to give
          the film a lot of style, but the story is an utter
          waste of time.  People who enjoy seeing blood and
          pain on the screen will have a good time.  For the
          rest is it a festival of cliches.  Rating: 4 (0 to
          10), 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Thomas Harris did a lot that was original with the novel RED
DRAGON, later made into the film MANHUNTER.  He established or at least
revitalized the entire sub-genre of stories of police and psychotic
serial killers.  This sort of story had been made before but he upped
the ante by making the killers more interesting and dangerous.  Today
the novel would not be as good because so much has been plundered for
use elsewhere.  Had THE BONE COLLECTOR come out at that time, it would
have been a much more intriguing film.  But by now most of what it
offers is familiar.  Phillip Noyce is not new to psychotic killer
films.  His DEAD CALM is one of the best because it is as much a sea
adventure as a murder plot.  Now he demonstrates just how important it
is to do something creative with the genre by giving us a thriller does
just about everything else right and still makes for a very mundane
film.  THE BONE COLLECTOR gives the ready-made audience who want to see
another violent psychotic thriller film a film to see, but does no
interesting playing with the genre.  The attraction of dealing with a
killer who thinks differently than a sane person should be that he is
unpredictable.  But just about everything about THE BONE COLLECTOR is
mechanical and done by the numbers.   The killer always leaves a clue
to his next crime and the heroes always figure out what the clue means
and exactly where the crime will occur down to a street address.</P>
<P>     The team of investigators seems to have been pulled from a
checklist of ethnic types.  We have a beautiful white patrol officer
unsure she wants to do forensics.  Then there is a black forensic
genius confined to a bed and suffering from seizures that he hopes will
soon kill him rather than become a vegetable.  And finally there is a
Latino forensic science researcher.  Of course the team of
investigators have to contend with a police department dominated by the
stupid and incompetent white males.  This gutsy team races the clock
and bucks the power structure finding clues that nobody else in the
police department can see.  This could almost be a TV pilot it is so
formulaic.</P>
<P>     Lincoln Rhyme (played by Denzel Washington) is the forensic expert
who literally wrote the book that defines police detective work.  Now
he is bed-ridden and subject to seizures that any time may leave him a
human vegetable.  Before that happens he wants to arrange his own
death.  Emily Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is a plucky young patrol
officer.  When she answers a report about a dead body found she has to
stop a train in order to prevent it from rolling over a clue.  This
brings her censure from her superiors, but earns her the respect of
Lincoln Rhyme.  Over her own objections she is drafted to help do the
detective work to track the killer.  The two quickly discover that they
are dealing with a psychotic killer who in the best traditions of
Batman villains always leaves a puzzle clue to what his next crime will
be.  The team is rounded out by Eddie Ortez (Luis Guzman), a genius at
materials analysis.  There is something wrong with the script when with
no additional clues the audience gets way ahead of the experts in
guessing the killer.  About a third of the way through I had a very
short list of suspects.  But then there were no clues whatsoever until
it is revealed who the killer is.  When at the end one does know the
killer and the motivation it too seems more out of Batman than reality.</P>
<P>     Cinematographer Dean Semler does a lot of obvious things to create
the feel of the film.  Scenes are kept dark and oppressive.  When the
plot shifts a setting into the sunlight the lens is heavily filtered to
give an unwholesome look to the street and sky.  Outdoor distance shots
try repeatedly and without subtlety to establish that this is Manhattan
while close-ups, those that do not take place in the basements and
bowels of the city, do not look a lot like New York and in fact are
filmed in Montreal.</P>
<P>     Denzel Washington plays his role with entirely too much vitality
for the man on the brink of death.  I am told in the book Rhyme is
middle-aged, which would have seemed more believable.  Here he happily
pokes fun at his own seizures, which seems entirely a wrong gesture for
a man in his supposedly depressed state.  Angelina Jolie, daughter of
Jon Voigt, does little to make the character of Emily Donaghy her own
and dozens of young actresses could have been snapped into the same
role like interchangeable parts.  Luis Guzman, recently of THE LIMEY,
is certainly watchable.  And Queen Latifah as Rhyme's caregiver matches
Washington's amiability.</P>
<P>     THE BONE COLLECTOR is an extremely forgettable TV-pilot level
serial killer film.  Only real fans of the sub-genre will enjoy it.  I
give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
