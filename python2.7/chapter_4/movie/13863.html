<PRE>                             DARK CITY 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
               2 :-) :-) for the lingering stuff of dreams</PRE>
<P>Cast: Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly, Richard
O'Brien, Ian Richardson, William Hurt Director: Alex Proyas Producers:
Andrew Mason and Alex Proyas
Screenplay: Alex Proyas and Lem Dobbs and David S. Goyer
Cinematography:  Dariusz Wolski</P>
<P>There's something surreal about the world of DARK CITY. It has a deja vu
feel of a distant memory or a vivid dream. It is always night and at the
stroke of twelve, everything stops. Lives are rearranged, memories
stolen, as if everything here runs under the influence of some alien
clockwork. The imagery is strangely beautiful, mysteriously haunting,
and intricately woven into the strangeness of the flow. You continually
ask yourself, where is this place? Who are these players? There is no
simple answer.</P>
<P>Made in Australia, this is a remarkable achievement in STYLE and should
be commended for this, if for anything. Alex Proyas - known for his
gothic imagery in THE CROW, has infused this movie with visual images
that speak louder than the script. Unfortunately, not many people may
take to this kind of story telling. Tastes vary, but this movie may be
too imaginative, creative, progressive for some, and unfortunately
labelled weird or alternative. This movie is undoubtedly one of the
better Australian-made movies this year, (compared to crap, like JOEY
and CRACKERS) and is a milestone in visual cinema in itself.</P>
<P>With a budget of only 27 million, the money is well spent and stretched
to the limit. Good value has been spent on employing a cast worth their
weight in fees. William Hurt gives the movie credibility, Kiefer
Sutherland is in one of his better roles, Jennifer Connely has put on
weight since THE ROCKETEER and Rufus Sewell has eyes as haunting as the
city itself. This movie looks like it had a budget of 50-70 million and
it shows that good movies can still be made with only a limited budget.</P>
