<PRE>                             LOST IN SPACE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A dysfunctional family learns to get
          along with each other when they are marooned in
          space in another part of the galaxy.  The 1960s TV
          series comes to the screen with a spectacular
          visual style but also with a family if anything
          more obnoxious than they were on TV--not an easy
          task.  Just when the science fiction ideas get
          somewhat sophisticated, the telling lapses into
          incoherence.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (- 4 to
          +4)</PRE>
<P>     Back in the 1965 Irwin Allen created a TV series, LOST IN SPACE,
based on the comic book SPACE FAMILY ROBINSON, itself a science fiction
adaptation of Johann David Wyss's SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON.  The series
lasted until 1968.  In the series seven people are present on an
experimental ship on a space mission when something went terribly wrong
and the whole group became, well ... lost in space. The characters were
the five-person Robinson Family, the pilot, and a stowaway enemy agent,
one Dr. Smith, whose initial goal was to destroy the mission.  The
family was unrealistic, even for the 1960s in that everybody seemed to
get along with everybody.  But Dr. Smith was adept at playing everybody
off against everybody else.  Smith was the embodiment of every negative
and dangerous human impulse but subtlety, yet the Robinson family never
seemed to catch on.  The special effects were bargain basement quality
for the most part.  When the LOST IN SPACE premiered, no less an expert
than Isaac Asimov wrote a letter reprinted in "TV Guide" about how
absurd the concept was.  It was a physical impossibility to travel so
fast and far in a few seconds that you could not even find familiar
stars in the sky.  I believe he claimed it was comparable to saying a
child on a tricycle took a wrong turn and found himself in another
country.</P>
<P>     There are at least two advantages to making a film of the story in
the late 1990s.  The story can be presented with superb special
effects.  I would rank the visual effects of this film just a few
microns below the quality one would expect from a STAR WARS film.  The
other advantage is that in these days of all kinds of theoretical holes
in physics--black, white, and worm--you would never get a reputable
scientist willing to commit to the impossibility of finding a few-
second shortcut to some other arm of the galaxy.</P>
<P>     In the new film version the Earth has finally conquered war and is
ready to move on to conquering the universe.  People live together in
peace--all but some nasty holdouts called the Sedition.  John Robinson
(played by William Hurt) has devoted his life to science at the cost of
neglecting his loved ones.  As a result he has one deuce of a
dysfunctional family.  Wife Maureen and children Judy, Penny, and
Will--nobody gets along.  The world is just not as peaceful as it
initially would seem.  The Robinsons might almost be better called the
Bickersons.  But John has a plan for bringing his family together and
at the same time further his work.  The whole family is going to take a
little trip together to the Alpha star system to set up a jump gate for
instantaneous travel to that system.  After ten years of being cooped
up together in space, of course the Robinsons will get along.  Everyone
in the family recognizes this as one of Dad's less stellar ideas, but
he thinks it will bring the family.  Little does John know that the
forces of the Sedition have an agent, Dr. Smith (Gary Oldman) who is
trying to stop their little mission and kill the family.  Except for
the maladjusted family this is really the plot of the TV series, but
remarkably when watching the film, one does not think of it as being a
retread.  It feels freshly re-imagined as if we are seeing it for the
first time.</P>
<P>     I cannot say I am very fond of William Hurt's acting in general.
Like Harrison Ford he usually has this distant quality, as if he is
just a little bit high all the time.  Mimi Rogers plays a slightly
authoritarian Maureen Robinson.  As Will Robinson Jack Johnson is
considerably more natural than was TV's Billy Mumy.  Heather Graham
makes an okay Judy Robinson, but Lacey Chabert's Penny is annoying and
just about the last person I would want to be cooped up with for ten
years.  Matt LeBlanc as the pilot on the make with Judy is nearly as
bad.  Gary Oldman, however, is a big improvement over the TV series.
His TV equivalent Jonathan Harris was a comedy actor who was miscast
and never convincing as the sinister agent. Oldman adopts many of the
same gestures, but makes them sinister and mysterious.  And he does get
some good lines like a playful allusion to the original STAR TREK as he
complains "I'm a doctor, not a space explorer."</P>
<P>     It has been a while since the look of a science fiction film has
done much to excite me, but if this film has a hero, it is production
designer Norman Garwood.  Visually, LOST IN SPACE is very evocative of
1960s science fiction, but not of TV science fiction of the time.  What
I saw on the screen was what was on the covers of magazines and books
at the time of the TV series.  It was like the film was the result of
someone watching the TV series in 1965 and then visualizing it the way
cutting edge artists of the time would have.  I kept finding myself
enjoying just looking at the screen and thinking what a good cover for
ANALOG science fiction magazine this or that scene would make.  Under
Garwood's design, space is a sinister place, much more so than it was
in the TV series.  The one false move is a cartoon-like monkey that
seems like a fugitive from some other film.  Garwood does a little
playing around with the design of the robot, which changes over the
course of the film, finally getting the crystal crown that was its most
memorable feature of the design from the series.  The credits list
cameos from the original TV series.  I must not have noticed Angela
Cartwright, but it is much harder to miss June Lockhart and, of course,
the voice of the robot is the same.  The language is a little salacious
for what is predominantly a children's film, but perhaps that is a sign
of changing times.</P>
<P>     With the exception of Oldman's performance, this is a film I would
rather look at than listen to.  But it does manage to take old material
and breathe new life into it.  I rate it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a
high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
