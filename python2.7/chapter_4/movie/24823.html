<P>Starring Kirsten Dunst, James Woods, Kathleen Turner, Josh Hartnett,
Hanna Hall, Chelse Swain, A.J. Cook, Leslie Hayman and the voice of
Giovanni Ribisi. Directed by Sofia Coppola. Rated R.</P>
<P>The Lisbon sisters enchanted the boys in the neighborhood. They toyed
with them, taunted them, tempted them and then just as the boys thought
that they were going to score, the girls committed suicide. Was this
all a cruel game they played, a last hurrah against the culture that
restricted them? Or was it a subconscious, desperate cry for help and
finally a release from a life they hated? Such is the difficult subject
matter of Sophia Coppola's powerful, confident directing debut entitled
The Virgin Suicides, a visually stunning, emotionally wrenching trip
through the dark side of 70's suburbia.</P>
<P>There were five of them: Lux (Kirsten Dunst), Cecilia (Hanna Hall),
Bonnie (Chelse Swain), Mary (A.J. Cook), Therese (Leslie Hayman).
Cecilia, the youngest, was the first to go. She tried to kill herself
by slitting her wrists in a bathtub; when that didn't work, she jumped
out of a window and landed directly on a spiked fence. Why she did what
she did is ambiguous. The mother (Kathleen Turner), a devoutly Catholic
woman who was paranoidly protective as it was, becomes even more
cautious. The dad (James Woods), a calm, reserved schoolteacher seems
to care less. In any event, the rest of the girls' lives are never the
same again.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the boys gather at a house across the street and spy on the
Lisbon sisters through a telescope. They begin a collection of Lisbon
souvenirs -- diaries, clothes, hairpins, etc. When, on prom night, Lux
sleeps with the school rebel Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett) on the
football field, mommy goes mad and shuts the girls off from the world
completely. After hearing a church sermon, she makes Lux burn her rock
records. The sisters' only contact with other people is through cryptic
messages they and the boys send to each other until one night they
finally build up the courage to end it all.</P>
<P>The Virgin Suicides brings a new meaning to the age-old
complaint "Parents just don't understand." This is the '70's, after
all -- the "ME" decade -- where, thanks to the "hippie" counterculture,
teens began to be looked upon as something resembling the spawn of
Satan. It's understandable, then, why Mrs. Lisbon got the idea that the
best way to protect her daughters from the evils of the other teenagers
was to shut them off completely. This film has been attacked by the
Catholic League, who charge that the girls commit suicide because they
couldn't stand their Catholic upbringing. These are misguided
complaints -- Catholicism had little to do with it.</P>
<P>The story is told from the point of view of the boys by a sort of
collective narrator (Giovanni Ribisi, who never actually appears). We
see much of the events from the outside looking in. Watching the film
is a little bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. We're told very
little outright -- the boys concede that they could not even begin to
understand the complexity of the Lisbon sisters -- and are expected to
figure it out on our own. The film's ending, surprising despite its
inevitability, leaves a lot of room for debate.</P>
<P>Sofia Coppola, never quite able to hit it big as an actress despite the
prominence of her director father Francis Ford Coppola, shows great
promise behind the camera. She has a surprising visual flair: the
repeating shot of Lux's sad face translucently superimposed over a
picturesque grass field with beautiful sunny skies above is hypnotic
and strangely ominous. Her sparing use of camera tricks like split-
screen and slow motion turn out to have a haunting effect and the
film's bleak, cold color palette gives it an appropriately unrealistic,
isolated, out-of-touch look, perhaps mimicking the girls' feelings.</P>
<P>The Virgin Suicides is a spellbinding tale of pubescent discovery,
parental indifference the fundamental unfairness of the 1970's and the
power that childhood memories can hold. It's rich, poignant, rewarding
and ultimately unforgettable.</P>
