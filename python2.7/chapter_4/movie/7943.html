                       A film review by Tim Voon

<P>It's about a big wave which capsizes a boat killing a wife and some
school boys, AND it's a real story.</P>
<PRE>Not very uplifting, but wait--..</PRE>
<P>The name of the ship is 'The Albatross', its a solid beautiful vessel,
but I kind of thought it looked old and probably would not have allowed
my child to go sailing half way around the world in it; but hey some
parents are real crazy right.</P>
<P>The idea of studying as you travel is any school boys dream of having a
great bludge, but these boys do actually learn some important lessons
about life, survival and working as a team.</P>
<P>So getting back to this big wave, a meteorological phenomenon known as
the 'White Squall' which has the propensity to capsize ships. It strikes
swiftly and unsuspectingly like the 'Hand of God', and it does so with
such awesome majesty that you almost forget about the people who are
drowning. The most touching and memorable scene involves the captain.
When unable to rescue his wife, he mouths the words 'I Love You' through
the sky light of their cabin as the ship sinks. She can only look up to
see her husband float away as she sinks to a watery grave.</P>
<P>I wander whether such educational cruises are still available for school
boys today? The responsibility to carry out such a venture must be
overwhelming, and I can only imagine the legal nightmares that would
eventuate if anybody drowns. After this unusual, tragic occurrence, I'm
sure the contracts signed by parents must include a clause which exempts
the crew responsibility for their child's life if struck by a "White
Squall".</P>
<P>However, this is not were the story ends. The captain never remarries
and becomes the leader of a peace movement in South America, whilst the
surviving boys are shipped of to Vietnam three years after this tragedy.
Amazingly they all return safely. One cannot help but wonder whether the
'Squall' which on one hand claimed the lives of their friends, in the
other instilled in them the courage and determination to survive no
matter what the circumstance.</P>
