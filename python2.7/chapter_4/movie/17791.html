<P>Hmmm...okay, let's take a classic tale from William Shakespeare, since he's
"hot" right now: "The Taming of the Shrew" (Note: When said real fast, the
title of this film may actually sound like it too!). Toss it the kids' way
by involving a couple of good-looking leads, some hipper than thou music, a
high school setting, and one of the worst movie titles of the year, and
you've got the tale of girl who nobody desired, and who in turn, desired no
one. Better all-around movie than SHE'S ALL THAT (6.5/10) and NEVER BEEN
KISSED (6/10).</P>
<P>PLOT:
Two diametrically opposed sisters, the younger being cute and outgoing, the
older reserved and independent, live under the rule of their strict father
who will not let the young one go out on a date until the older one gets a
date herself, which she is adamantly against. But halt, alas, here is a
mighty prince being paid a hefty compensation to attempt to date the
"unapproachable" girl by a weasel who wants to "nail" the younger one. And
what about the sweet kid who really does love the younger sibling? Find out!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Light, safe, enjoyable little tale of the teenage world, boasts a couple of
charming and utterly convincing performances from its two stars, quite a few
chuckle-as-you-go-along jokes, and a surprisingly believable component of
depth within a few well-developed movie characters. Okay, so it's not
perfect, I mean it still has a couple of the one-dimensional players that we
find in all teenage flicks, along with the proverbially boring ritual of one
guy introducing another to the various cliques in a high school (Wow, what a
concept!), but overall, it plays well because of its non-stop pace, the
interesting relationship between the sisters, and most of all, the enjoyable
and engaging performances by stars-to-be Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles.</P>
<P>Little sister, Larisa Oleynik, also played her cutesy role to a tee, even
managing to add some credibility to her first-thought-of-as-one-dimensional
role. There were also plenty of romantic scenes in this movie, which are
sure to set any girl's eyes a-flutter (Mrs. JoBlo almost fluttered her way
out of her seat during the touching serenade in the soccer field scene).
Having said that, I think that I could have done without another "prom
scene" or some of the out-of-place eighties tunes playing during a party of
sixteen year olds (Do any of them even know who the Thompson Twins are??),
but all in all, this film managed to hook me into its net of romance, fluff,
comedy and teenage shenanigans. Mix that in with an utterly entertaining
presentation by the way of the overly cautious father, Larry Miller, and the
funniest teacher to hit the big screen in a long while, Daryl "Chill"
Mitchell, and you've got yourself a pleasant time at the movie garage, or a
decent nite of home video. Either way, don't forget the nachos and your
better half.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:  (Some facts gathered from
the IMDb)
Several names reflect the Shakespearean origin of this movie. Bianca's and
Katerina's last name is Stratford (Shakespeare was born in
Stratford-upon-Avon). Patrick's last name is Verona (birthplace of
Petruchio, the corresponding character from the play). The high school is
called Padua, which is the city in which the play is set. Groovy, eh?
Actress Julia Stiles was born in New York City on March 28, 1981.
Actor Heath Ledger was born in Perth, Australia on the 4th of April, 1979.
He starred in a film called BLACK ROCK, which was nominated for Best
Australian picture in 1997.
This is director Gil Junger's first feature film. He has directed many TV
shows before, including "Dharma & Greg", "Living Single" and "Ellen".  He
was nominated for an Emmy for directing the infamous episode of "Ellen" in
which she revealed herself to be Lebanese...I mean, a lesbian! :)
The man who played the funny teacher, Daryl "Chill" Mitchell was part of a
Hip-Hop group from the 80's known as Groove B. Chill. He played the
character of "Chill" in both HOUSE PARTY movies.
Larisa Oleynik considers actress Claire Danes and Winona Ryder as her role
models. She and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are both on TV's "3rd Rock from the
Sun".</P>
