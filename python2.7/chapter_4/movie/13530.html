<P>Of all the films that came out that week, this was one I wanted to see, just
for the fun of it. This is what I call REAL entertainment, if not a
"pointed" style of entertainment. And though it has well known actors for
its parts, they really are not necessary, because the film floats along
rather well, specially when it comes to the special effects and the nifty
little  stuff that we get to see.</P>
<P>Well, the kiddies might like it better than we do... we are supposed to be
adults and as adults we do not believe in faury tales and bs stories. This
is a bs story, but who cares, when it is fun to sit through anyway.</P>
<P>And it takes a dragon with an attitude to make it happen.  Well, the rest of
the film, I don't know.</P>
<P>But it is fun to sit through with all the flying and the friendship that a
dragonslayer develops with a beast, who know is able to get what it wants in
food and drink and have a knight to protect it as well. But it takes a few
battles between them for the slayer to realise that the real threat is not
the dragon, but the fear that people have developed which is taken to
political heights.</P>
<P>Is the story meaningful in this film... I don't know. If I find one, I will
rewrite this review. But in the meantime, it is fun just to watch a dragon
with an attitude and some rather nifty special effects to make things look
much better than they really are. Well, the acting is alright, nothing
fancy, and the slayer has an attitude as well. But without the dragon's
funny disposition, this film might not have been as much fun to sit through.</P>
