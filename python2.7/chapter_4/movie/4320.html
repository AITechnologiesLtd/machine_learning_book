<PRE>                                  TOY STORY
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The wizards at Pixar and Disney have created a film that is unlikely
to be forgotten in the next few years.  TOY STORY, the first completely
computer-animated movie ever, is fresh and funny, and it takes the state
of animation to a heretofore undreamed-of level.</P>
<P>     Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) is the leader of a group of toys who come
alive when no one is watching.  Owned by young Andy (John Morris), they
find new toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) thrown into the mix, and when
Woody's insecurity causes him to try almost anything to get Buzz out of
the picture, he almost succeeds with catastrophic effects.  Soon, both
Woody and Buzz find themselves captives in the next-door home of toy
molester Sid (Erik von Detten).  Not only must they get out of Sid's
place, but the family's moving day is nigh, and no one wants to be left
behind.</P>
<P>     Hanks brings the apprehensive Woody alive better than most live
characters are done.  And a gaggle of supporting toys round out the cast,
including Don Rickles as a sarcastic Mr. Potato Head, Wallace Shawn as a
pacifist Tyrannosaurus Rex, and Annie Potts as Woody's love interest Bo
Peep, all of whom add another twist to comic happenings.  Even questions
of identity are brought up without being too silly, as Buzz doesn't
understand he's not a real spaceman.  Not only is TOY STORY visually
spectacular, but it's downright hilarious.</P>
<P>     Nice touches make the film a true delight to watch, with details like
water droplets on windows, the detailed underbelly of the moving van, and
reflections of the family in Christmas tree ornaments.  I'd wager
something new could be found every time the movie is seen.</P>
<P>     The only problems I had were the corny songs and the fact that the
animation, while it works spectacularly well for the stiffly mechanical
toys, doesn't translate so easily to human movement.  While people aren't
the ultimate subject of the piece, it is a bit of a distraction when
they're in the focus.</P>
<P>     Nonetheless, TOY STORY is a visual feast, perfect for the holidays. 
Director John Lasseter ups the stakes with every scene, the best of which
is a nightmarish sequence in Sid's room, whose toy experimentations look
straight out of Tim Burton's brain.  Highly recommended "for kids of all
ages."</P>
