<P>     When Ruby Lee Gissing (Ashley Judd, the daughter of country singer
Naomi Judd, and younger sister to Wynonna) makes it out of her
Tennessee home town "without getting pregnant or beat up," she
considers it quite a feat.  With all her belongings in her car, she
arrives in Panama City, Florida with hardly a dime to her name and
little more than childhood memories to go on.  Nevertheless, her pluck
and determination land her a job in the off-season because Mildred
Chambers (Dorothy Lyman), the owner of a souvenir shop, sees something
in her.  Ms. Chambers has only one rule for her employees:  the don't
date her son Ricky (Bentley Mitchum).  So when Ruby not only goes out
with him, but ends up in his bed, her troubles are about to begin.</P>
<P>     Male coming-of-age stories are a dime-a-dozen, but the same cannot
be said for the female equivalent, especially when the story is told
with intelligence and sensitivity.  This makes RUBY IN PARADISE a rare
and welcome change of pace.  Oddly enough, for something with this much
insight, it's a surprise to note that it was written and directed by a
man, Victor Nunez.</P>
<P>     The film gives Ruby two men to choose from:  the scheming,
cheating Ricky,who offers her sex, gifts, and a good time; and the
deep-thinking Mike (Todd Field), who offers her companionship and
security.  Ruby, however, is less concerned about finding herself a man
than finding out who she really is.  She came to Panama City to get
something that she couldn't get back home.</P>
<P>     By Nunez' own admission, most movies present women as either
objects to be "bought or [those that] get to be worshipped as perfect
things that a man must work to become worthy of."  Such typical
Hollywood treatment was not for the director of 1979's GAL YOUNG 'UN
and 1985's adaptation of John D. MacDonald's A FLASH OF GREEN.  He
wanted Ruby to be something different and more substantial in a movie
about "soul work."</P>
<P>     Nothing of a monumental nature happens in RUBY IN PARADISE, but
the depth of the character study, coupled with Nunez's talent for
recognizing small details, makes for a surprisingly compelling motion
picture.  This story is so real that it's like watching the life of
someone you lost touch with after high school.</P>
<P>     Ashley Judd's performance is worth more words than I have space
for.  Her grasp of Ruby is such that every nuance of the character is
brought out, and the subtlety with which certain emotions are brought
to the fore demands appreciation from a viewer.  (It caught Oliver
Stone's attention; he cast her in NATURAL BORN KILLERS after seeing
this and being "bulldozed" by her at an audition.)  Ms. Judd repeatedly
outacts and outshines her co-stars.  There isn't a moment in this movie
when Judd's Ruby is upstaged, and she's in every scene.</P>
<P>     Interestingly enough, having also seen THE PIANO, I've been
privileged to see two strong female leads in one day, which is
something of a rarity.  While Holly Hunter will likely receive an
Academy Award nomination for her performance, the same will not be true
for Ashley Judd.  It's a shame, but that's the way Hollywood works.</P>
<P>     Ruby Lee Gissing is so much like the heroines of the Jane Austin
books she reads that even she recognizes the similarities.  The
toughness, intelligence, and resiliency are all there, and with the
deft hand of Nunez replacing that of Austin, this makes RUBY IN
PARADISE a surprisingly fresh and engrossing little film.</P>
