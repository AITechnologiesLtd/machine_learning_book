Re: Ten movies that helped shape my life: #2</P>
<P>"Rashomon." (1950) There are several foreign films I saw as a 
boy that made me think of how different people were in other 
parts of the world. Rashomon, from the Japanese director Akira 
Kurosawa, was about the universality of human nature  --  the 
elusiveness of truth everywhere in the world. There are four 
people involved in an event that occurs in the middle of a 
forest in 16th century Japan. There is a nobleman, his beautiful
 consort, a bandit, and a bystander. There is conflict, a sexual
 episode between the woman and the bandit, and a murder. The 
heart of the film consists of the same event played out four 
different ways, according to the recollections of the four 
participants. This troubling film taught me that there is no 
such thing as objective fact or pure objectivity and built upon
 the lesson of The Ox-Bow Incident. It made it easy for me to 
see how Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill told the truth, although 
their stories were 180 degrees apart. It also enabled me to 
appreciate the conflicting stories of President Clinton and 
Kathleen Willey. People sometimes remember what was in their 
mind at the time of a stressful situation because it really was 
in their mind. </P>
