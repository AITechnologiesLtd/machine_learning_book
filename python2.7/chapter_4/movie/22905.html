<P>The phenomenon of ultra-low budget independent filmmaking has achieved
some measure of commercial success in recent years, with the best
example being 1999's ubiquitous Blair Witch Project. However, for
every film that manages to reach audiences, there are countless many
that go unnoticed. Simply being an independent production does not
mean that a film is being developed from quality source material. Even
when the fundamentals are sound and the filmmaker has a clear vision
for the project, restricted resources can present crippling obstacles
that keep the film from developing into a coherent product.</P>
<P>This film is a documentary that chronicles the struggles of Mark
Borchardt, an aspiring filmmaker, and his attempt to fulfill his
dreams. He is a young man who is unable to keep his personal life
completely stable, but who has a strong vision and an indomitable
determination to succeed in film. Fittingly, Mark does not toil in the
shadows of the studios of Hollywood, but instead pursues his craft in
a working class suburb of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mark is a rather odd
person, and thus he is a compelling character to anchor a documentary.</P>
<P>Mark does not have the luxury of being a fulltime filmmaker. He works
menial odd jobs to scrape up enough money to keep his project going,
and to occasionally have a beer with his friends. Mark's background is
fleshed out through interviews with his family members and his
friends. Hardly any character occupying significant screen time comes
across as a "normal" person, and this gives the film a surreal tone.
Particularly Mark's close friend, Mike Schank (whose original music
appears in this film), seems like an exaggerated caricature. The
surrealness gives the impression that this not an actual documentary,
but a fictional mockumentary, where all the humor was actually
scripted.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the story, Mark is working on a feature film,
Northwestern, his master work. However, production must be halted due
to a serious lack of funding. Mark's plan becomes to finish a short
film, Coven, (which is also a work in progress) and use the proceeds
from its sale to underwrite Northwestern. The problem of funding still
remains for his work at hand, but Coven is fully written, and requires
less money since it is only a short.</P>
<P>Since his minimum wage job(s) barely contribute anything, and since
his parents are unwilling to give him more money than they already
have, Mark turns to a miserly uncle, Bill, for funding. Although a
cynic might assume that Mark treats his uncle well because of his
money, it is clear from the footage of Mark's interaction with Bill
that he truly cares for him. These are the most moving parts of the
film. It is not often that one sees a deep intergenerational
relationship in modern cinema (except perhaps for the relationship
between a young child and an elder).</P>
<P>As the story progresses, Mark is able to shoot parts of his film
whenever he has the resources. The story culminates in Mark's final
composition of Coven and its first showing. Small parts of the film
are shown, and it is striking to see how parts that were haphazardly
filmed ended up being so vividly striking.</P>
<P>Ironically, the making of this film was an effort not unlike Mark's
struggles. The budget was always an impediment, equipment broke,
footage was lost, and many other obstacles were faced that were
typical to an independent feature. The result here, unlike many
projects that become overwhelmed by obstacles, is a coherent and
successful film.</P>
<P>Recommended. Fans of independent film will enjoy this portrait of a
quirky filmmaker. Non-fans of the genre will be entertained by this
look at an odd individual. Although the narrative of the documentary
lacks some smoothness, it is still a compelling story with highly
interesting characters, and even some suspense in seeing whether the
filmmaker achieves his goals.</P>
