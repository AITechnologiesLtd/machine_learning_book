<P>Over the past few years, there have been only a few notable Australian
imports (Shine, Kiss or Kill), but after watching Rob Stich's The
Castle, which was the highest-grossing Australian film of last year,
their future is looking brighter. At the screening of The Castle which
I attended, two of the film's stars (both very nice) were in
attendance, surely trying to help spread word-of-mouth and make the
film a Full Monty-sized hit. And while The Castle is a funny,
heartwarming movie, it is not as poignant as The Full Monty, the film
to which The Castle has been often compared.</P>
<P>At the beginning of The Castle, Dale Kerrigan (Stephen Curry), a
scraggly teenager, introduces us to the members of his oddball
family. Darryl (Michael Caton), the father, is the backbone of the
family. He is a constantly cheerful man; always trying to keep the
family happy. If Darryl is the backbone, then Sal (Anne Tenney), the
mother, is the other bones. She does the cooking and errands around
the house.</P>
<P>Steve (Anthony Simcoe), Dale's older brother, is what Darryl calls an
"ideas man". He also spends most of his time looking through the
classifieds for useless things to buy and sell. Then there is
Tracy (Sophie Lee), a hairdresser who has just gotten married. And
lastly, there is Wayne (Wayne Hope), the son whom Darryl says "got
stuck with the wrong crowd", and commited a robbery.  He is locked up
in prison, but Dale visits him weekly.</P>
<P>What keeps the family together is their home, which Darryl calls his
"castle". It is situated right next to the airport runway, and
sometimes, says Darryl, you think the planes are going to land right
on top of you. The conflict of the film comes when a man informs them
that the goverment is planning an airport expansion, and their house
will be taken over by a compulsory acquisition.  Darryl then hires
small-time lawyer Dennis Denuto (Tiriel Mora), to try anything he can
to fight the government.</P>
<P>The Castle used four writers, was shot on a shoestring budget over an
11-day period, and for the most part, works very well. The film is a
light, British-style comedy, and is very funny at times. It is
essentially a feel-good movie, and I can't think of a single character
that was unlikable (although I hear that all Aussies are nicer than any
American). Many films need to take a lesson from movies like The
Castle, that prove that nice guys finish first.</P>
<P>Michael Caton gives a fine comic performance, reminiscent of early
John Cleese, and the film, while somewhat short, is very entertaining
the whole way through. The Castle sometimes borderlines on being too
cheerful, but too much of a good thing isn't all that bad.</P>
