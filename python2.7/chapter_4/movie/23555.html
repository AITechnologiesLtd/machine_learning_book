<P>Television. What is it good for? Beats me. Movies have always been my game,
especially over the past few years. Once "Cheers" and "The Larry Sanders
Show" left the airwaves, I was left tinkering around with "Seinfeld" and
"The Simpsons" for a while, but all's I got left nowadays is my weekly
ritual of Mulder & Scully...also known as "The X-Files". Which brings us to
this film, which features the directing and producing debut of two writers
from some of the X-Files' most memorable shows, James Wong and Glen Morgan
respectively, and hopefully a good dose of dark, supernatural, creepy
shtuff!</P>
<P>PLOT:
A high school kid aboard an airplane to France freaks out when he has a
premonition about the plane's deadly fate once airborne, and gets himself
and a few friends kicked off the airlines. It is only when his prophecy
becomes reality a few minutes later, that the handful of survivors suddenly
find themselves in an adversarial position against death, who apparently
doesn't take too kindly to folks bailing out on his cataclysmic plans.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Creepy, dark and unlike many of your standard teen slasher flicks that have
been tossed our way over the past few years, this movie combines an original
and realistic premise, a quick pace, many gruesome and creative death scenes
and a pretty cool ending, if I don't say so myself. Were there many "stock"
characters ready to die like in many of these other thrillers? Well, not
really, but I will admit that there was one dude who was pretty badly
written and did piss me off with his unrealistic attitude throughout most of
the film (without naming any names...Carter), but on the whole, the rest of
the kids were decent with the highest kudos going out to Devon Sawa in
another solid leading role. He truly bit into this character and delivers an
effective portrayal of a kid who finds himself fighting the battle of his
life...against death! This film's first 15 minutes are probably its
creepiest, with quick cuts, tense moments and a dark, rainy night adding a
real authenticity to the proceedings, and having me think twice about ever
flying again. This got me hooked.</P>
<P>After that, the film does wind into a pretty basic routine of a "killer" on
the loose with only the order of the victims to be determined, and yet, this
film didn't allow itself to be trite or boring at any point. In fact, the
killing scenes are probably some of the most original that I've seen in
years, and plenty of back-end intrigue via the FBI agents following the
case, the twists and turns discovered by Sawa's character and the general
intelligence of the script take this film above and beyond most of the teen
hokum out there. Granted, I thought they could have spiced up the FBI agents
a bit, and certainly removed an entire scene featuring Tony Todd from
CANDYMAN fame essentially reliving his role from that film, but all in all,
the film's originality, dark undertones and solid performance by Sawa won me
over. Also, it was nice to be scared by something that you couldn't really
"see" for once in a horror film (I guess that's how most people felt about
BLAIR WITCH...an overrated movie in my opinion), and be spared the two-bit
special effects gallery. And if you thought the last shot from BLAIR WITCH
was a keeper, well, let's just say that this one goes out with a bang! A
real scream... :)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Devon Sawa was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
Actress Valerie Cloke, who plays the teacher character named Valerie Lewton
in this film, is married to producer/writer Glen Morgan in real life.
Devon Sawa's main co-star in this movie, Ali Larter, is probably best
remembered for her awesome debut role as the "whipped cream naked girl" from
VARSITY BLUES (7/10).
The characters' names in this film were apparently written as homages to
some of the greats of the genre. Alex's surname is Browning, as in Todd
Browning who directed FREAKS and the original DRACULA. Billy's surname is
Hitchcock, and Valeri is a moniker for Val Luten, whose credits include CAT
PEOPLE and WALK OF THE ZOMBIE.
Earlier drafts of this film's script featured no connection between any of
the characters who leave the plane early on in the movie, having them seek
one another out instead.
This film was originally titled FLIGHT 180, which is the number of the
flight the kids were to have taken early on in the film.</P>
