<PRE>                              DONNIE BRASCO
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>If you are going to make still another film about the mafia, there had
better be another angle.   DONNIE BRASCO, fortunately, has just that in
the relationship between an undercover FBI agent, Joe Pistone, alias
Donnie Brasco, and a mafia loser, "Lefty" Ruggiero.</P>
<P>Based on the true story of Joe Pistone who was responsible for some 200
mafia members being charged with criminal activity, the film shows us
what is necessary to be able to accomplish that. . .  total
dedication.   Wife, children, friends have to play second fiddle to the
dangerous work to which the agent has pledged himself.   Thus,
Pistone's wife, Maggie (Anne Heche) is torn between having to see him
infrequently and worried about his undercover life. Likewise, his
children are shortchanged because he cannot be a real father to them.</P>
<P>There we have one facet of Donnie's life.  The other is his
infiltration into the mafia by befriending Lefty.   Lefty has been a
mafia man ever since his teens but despite having taken part in some
killings, robberies, and assorted mafia doings he never gets the
recognition he feels he deserves; others get promoted but Lefty is
always overlooked. . . . and it rankles him.   When he meets Donnie he
feels this is his chance to show the mob that he can bring young,
bright, blood into the mafia . . . and he stakes whatever reputation he
has on Donnie coming through for him.   He vouches for Donnie to the
mafia chief.   This causes the great dilemma facing Donnie.</P>
<P>Having associated with Lefty for so long, having Lefty  depend on him
and befriending him, Pistone is torn about how he can turn in his
friend to the FBI. Not an easy decision, he finds.</P>
<P>The acting by Depp is a departure from most of his films and he is very
good. Pacino, who usually tears through a film with both guns
(figuratively) blazing, here has a subdued tone, the demeanor of a
loser trying to get out of the hole he has made for himself years ago
when he joined the mob.  Dressed in an adorably crazy (pork pie?) hat,
he is a delight to watch.</P>
<P>While Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby and James Russo lend their talents as
various mafia members, the film suffers from a gratuitous scene of legs
being sawed and hacked, blood running, legs with skin torn off.   When
I see that, I have to knock off Bytes.  There was no need for the
graphic violence we are shown, however small a part it played in the
entire film.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Mike Newell</PRE>
<PRE>2.5 Bytes</PRE>
<PRE>4 Bytes = Superb
3 Bytes = Too good to miss
2 Bytes = Average
1 Byte  = Save your money</PRE>
