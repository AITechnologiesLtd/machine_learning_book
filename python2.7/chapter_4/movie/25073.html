<P>Review by Lars Lindahl (<A HREF="mailto:larsattacks@mail.com">larsattacks@mail.com</A>)</P>
<P>"Eye of the Beholder" (2000) ** (out of four)</P>
<P>Written and Directed by Stephan Elliot</P>
<P>Starring Ewan McGregor, Ashley Judd, k.d. Lang,
Patrick Bergin, Genevieve Bujold, and Jason Priestley.</P>
<P>With a better ending it might have worked. Eye of the
Beholder grabbed me with its perfectly unattractive
images and held me tightly for quite a long time but
ultimately took no advantage of its overpowering
control. About three quarters of the way through I
suddenly lost all interest. I can even pinpoint the
exact moment this voyeuristic cat-and-mouse obsession
film self-destructed: the unfashionably late entrance
by Jason Priestley. In possibly the worst acting
performance of the year, Priestley ruins this movie.
His overacting is intolerable, his physical appearance
is repulsive, his portrayal of a drug- addicted abuser
is inexcusable. Thankfully, he only has a brief cameo
role or else Eye of the Beholder would have been
torture to watch. Priestley doesn't deserve all of the
blame though. Writer/Director Stephan Elliot never
takes his story to the next level. He skillfully
throws you into the movie as quickly as possible, but
he does little after that. </P>
<P>Elliot stretches the simple outline of the plot (man
chases woman) farther than it should be stretched and
because of this, the movie really goes nowhere during
its one hour and forty minute running time. After a
while I stopped caring about the characters in the
movie because Elliot gave me no reason to. Every
person in this movie is bland and one- dimensional --
the dreaded combination that makes a movie almost
impossible to enjoy. </P>
<P>Should I have cheered for Ashley Judd's Joanna or
booed her? This woman is a cold-blooded serial killer
but to me Elliot wants us to root for her anyway.
There are zero moments where I could have related to
her, zero moments where she did something humane. </P>
<P>Then there is Ewan McGregor's spy character known as
"The Eye." Is he the guy I should have admired?
Following Joanna around, "The Eye" becomes obsessed
with her and her killing habits. There are three
reasons why I despised "The Eye." First off, he
predictably falls in love with Joanna, a horrible
person who only attracts him because of her beautiful
looks. Second, he's not the brightest "hero" around.
Customarily, you'd think that a spy would wear all
black or disguises to hide their presence, but our
friend "The Eye" walks around with a brightest red
jacket you'll ever see. This seemingly minor annoyance
is actually incredibly irritating. The third problem
with the miserable "The Eye" is that we learn
throughout the movie that his wife and child left him
because he spends so much time on his computer. So
you'd think the solution to that problem would be to
stay away from the computer. Does "The Eye" do this?
Of course not. In fact, he spends even more time on
the computer and whines even more about his loss.
Arrggh. </P>
<P>An appropriate ending could have made these characters
more interesting. Perhaps if we learned more about why
they did what they did, they would be more realistic
and believable. But Eye of the Beholder abruptly
finished as if the camera ran out of film. </P>
<P>What I did like was the constant eye/blind/sight
imagery Elliot uses. The Australian filmmaker who
brought you the colorful Prescilla: Queen of the
Desert seems to be a more talented director than
writer. The visuals prevent Eye of the Beholder from
getting the lowest grade possible, but little else is
recommended. This possible cult film should have gone
straight to cable or video. </P>
