<P>It's hard to imagine that a movie with a cast so powerful and a theme so
poignant could fall so short of the mark. It's interesting to note that
the A-list cast may be all that keeps this political drama from sinking
into the murky waters of near-obscurity. There's a scene in PRIMARY
COLORS where five or six grown men and women all hug each other around a
plate of barbecued ribs and sing "You Are My Sunshine," and although the
scene is laughable in context, nobody ever stops to think that the
situation is horribly outrageous. Why? Because among the makeshift
chorus are John Travolta, Emma Thompson, and Billy Bob Thornton. Those
three alone have the power and tenacity on screen to turn a silly
sing-along into a fantastic character-building sequence. And perhaps
that's the film's best quality: the character of the cast, from the
leads to the supports. </P>
<P>There's a somewhat-definite line drawn between the two or three lead
roles and the dozens of supporting actors and actresses. The leads,
Governor Jack Stanton (Travolta) and his wife Susan (Thompson), are
clearly the most serious of the lot. Other main characters, like Henry
Burton (Adrian Lester), Daisy Green (Maura Tierney), and Richard Jemmons
(Thornton) are the buffer between the seriousness of the Stantons and
the hazy stereotypes of the rest of the cast. Finally, on the opposite
end of the spectrum, are the numerous two-bit roles that are written off
as hilariously abnormal parts. The range of the cast knows no bounds:
they are the butt of countless racist, sexist, anti-Semetic, and
homophobic jokes, and they are the funniest butt you will ever see.
There is no word in the English language to describe them. </P>
<P>But the story that all of these characters have to follow is based on a
novel that is not well written. PRIMARY COLORS, the novel by Anonymous,
was good as an infomercial on the business of running a Presidential
campaign, but as a story its entertainment value was nil. The movie,
which stays very faithful to its in-print basis, is simply the story of
a virtually unknown governor from an small, unnamed Southern state who
runs for President. Of course, everything the story resembles Bill
Clinton's 1990-91 campaign, but that's quietly brushed off to the side
as mere happenstance. While that may be the media's official line, it's
hard to dismiss John Travolta's salt-and-pepper hair color or his
sweet-as-molasses Southern lilt as happenstance. Emma Thompson, too,
lives up to the fierce political advocate of the current First Lady,
although she doesn't come as close as the book's version.</P>
<P>This movie is not the most powerful motion picture you will see this
year. Its running time of 140 minutes is on the long end of watchable,
especially when the story isn't that interesting and Director Mike
Nichols does not do anything to spice it up. There is no powerful music,
no skillful photography, and no well-written script. This may be a
textbook example of a book's transition into film, but it is not a
thoroughly entertaining film. When the only recent comparison is WAG THE
DOG, which was a better product, I hesitate to say that this is a good
movie. Nevertheless, it may be worth watching for curiosity alone. The
bottom line is that this film's value will be based on viewer merit.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "PRIMARY COLORS": 2.0 stars - a fair movie.</P>
