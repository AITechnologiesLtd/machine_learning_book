<P>In his previous films, writer/director Jim Jarmusch (Dead Man) seemed to
take great pride in fusing different cultures together, and Ghost Dog:
The Way of the Samurai is certainly no different.  The picture stars
Forest Whitaker (Light it Up) as the titular Ghost Dog, a stealthy
hit-man that follows an ancient Samurai code while working for New
Jersey mobsters.  Ghost Dog gives its protagonist a best friend that
can't speak English and features a blistering hip-hop score from Wu-Tang
Clan's RZA.</P>
<P>While that description may make Ghost Dog sound like a mess of a film,
it remains pleasantly simple.  Ghost Dog is a withdrawn, ninja-like
loner that lives in a shack on the roof of a Jersey apartment building
with his pigeons.  He makes homemade weapons and burglary devices, and
follows a strict ethical code that he follows to the letter.  Constantly
reading and referring to `Hagakure: The Way of the Samurai,' an 18th
century Japanese code for warrior discipline, Ghost Dog insists on
communicating with his bosses solely through carrier pigeons and is paid
annually on the first day of autumn for the previous year's work.</P>
<P>How does a guy this quirky get hooked up with the mob, you ask?  Years
ago, a young Ghost Dog was saved during a beat-down by a gangster named
Louie (John Tormey, Kiss Me Guido), who took the pup under his wing (in
this scene, Ghost Dog is played by Damon Whitaker, Forest's younger
brother) and slowly entrusts him with bigger and bigger tasks.</P>
<P>On one particular job, Ghost Dog is told to `take care of' a mobster
named Handsome Frank (Richard Portnow, Howard Stern's dad in Private
Parts), who is boffing Louise (Tricia Vessey, The Alarmist), the red-hot
daughter of Vargo (Henry Silva, The End of Violence), the family's Don.
Ghost Dog follows through on the hit, but is caught off-guard by
Louise's presence at the scene.  Louise's cool demeanor and the fact
that she's reading `Rashomon' momentarily unnerves Ghost Dog and he
quickly splits, becoming a target of the Mafia's wrath for leaving a
witness to the hit.</P>
<P>Throw in Ghost Dog's odd relationships with a French-speaking ice cream
hawker and a young girl from the projects that shares his fondness for a
good read, and you've got…well, you've got a Jarmusch film.  His work is
generally geared much more toward character development than they are
plot-driven, and Ghost Dog is no exception.  His Mafia characters are
almost cartoonish in nature, a point that the director emphasizes by
having the Don watch Felix the Cat, Woody Woodpecker, Itchy & Scratchy
and Betty Boop.</P>
<P>Jarmusch also uses quotes from `The Hagakure' as title card bumpers
between scenes.  The idea seems okay, but some of them are particularly
absurd .  Imagine you're enjoying a film and are hit with something like
`There is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a
sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road.
But doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still
get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be
perplexed, though you still get the same soaking.'  Dude, if I wanted to
use my brain, I would have stayed home and read a book.</P>
<P>Still, Jarmusch does wonders with the culture clash between gangster,
samurai and hip-hop.  One of the goons admits that Flava Flav is his
favorite rap star, quoting the Public Enemy second-fiddle with his tough
Jersey accent.  Cinematography wiz Robby Müller, who also worked on Dead
Man, gives Ghost Dog a dark, seedy look, and RZA's score is likely to be
one of the year's best.</P>
<P>1:55 - R for strong violence and language</P>
