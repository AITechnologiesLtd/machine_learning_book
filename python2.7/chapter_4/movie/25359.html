<PRE>"X-Men" – Not Enough to Marvel
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Rogue (Anna Paquin) has the power to absorb a person's
living energy merely by touch.  She can't control this
power or its intensity.  Cyclops (James Marsden) must
wear a special visor; otherwise, opening his eyes will
create an explosive burst of deadly energy.  Thus, he
can never look upon the one that he loves with his own
eyes.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is an embittered and
belligerent soul.  He can't remember his past, and
worst of all, he has no idea how his body was
transformed into some kind of walking Ginsu knife.  </P>
<P>These are the X-Men, specially gifted people who are
psychologically conflicted.  "X-Men" the movie also
seems somewhat conflicted and unbalanced.  Yes, it has
some style and it's very cool to watch these wild
powers being unleashed.  And it's impossible not to
like Patrick Stewart as the benevolent Charles Xavier
and Ian McKellen as the bent-on-world-domination
Magneto.  But beyond this, there is little to marvel. 
It is conspicuously devoid of action sequences, though
the finale is impressive.  It lacks the color and the
energy that has propelled this comic book series into
the stratospheric best seller that it is.  And, there
are just so many characters that many of them speak no
more than two or three lines (though to be fair, this
series has introduced more than 300 since it first
appeared in 1963, and in this film, there are only
eight.)</P>
<P>Unfortunately, this movie is more about background
than anything else.  It's a 100-minute introduction
into the world of the X-Men, and this is exposition
that fans would probably rather do without.  "Every
few millennia," the narrator says, "evolution leaps
forward."  The result can be both wondrous and a
curse.  For example, some may develop telekinesis,
telepathic ability, or even the ability to control
weather.  Despite these amazing powers, because you're
a "freak of nature", you are feared and hated by
humanity.  At this moment in time, a zealous Senator
(Bruce Davison) is proposing a mutant registration
program.  He pleads to the people, "they are among us.
 We must know who they are and what they can do."</P>
<P>Although this worries the sagacious Xavier, he
believes that mutants and humans can peacefully
co-exist.  Magneto thinks otherwise.  From personal
experience, he knows what it's like to be an outsider
and the destructive rage of a bigoted society.  So, he
decides to show the human race firsthand what it's
truly like to be a mutant even if its consequences
might mean large-scale death of Holy War proportions. 
Supporting his efforts are Sabretooth (Tyler Mane),
who has the strength of 20 men and the speed of a
gazelle; The Toad (Ray Park), who creatively uses his
12-foot projectile-like tongue; and the colorful
Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), who can assume the
likeness of just about anyone and does so with
reckless abandon.  But Xavier and his X-Men are well
trained in the use of their powers and are prepared to
do battle on behalf of mankind.  </P>
<P>The problem with "X-Men" is that it doesn't provide
sufficient power and pathos.  The average moviegoer
and especially the fans will be somewhat disappointed
with the generic plot line.  Many characters,
especially Storm (Halle Berry), are fairly flat and
only look cool when they summon up their powers.  The
one exception was Wolverine.  This walking switchblade
is probably the most popular character among fans. 
Newcomer Hugh Jackman understands the fan's
appreciation for Wolverine's testy nature.  To
properly motivate himself, he took a cold shower prior
to shooting.  He even gets the best line of the movie
when he turns to Cyclops and warns him to "keep your
eye open."  The film has its visual pleasures and some
amusing moments.  However, this limp adaptation does
this comic book sensation very little justice.</P>
