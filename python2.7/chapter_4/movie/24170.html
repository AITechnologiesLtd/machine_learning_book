Bring a friend.)</PRE>
<P>It is the late 1980s, and creature-of-habit Patrick Bateman (Christian
Bale, in a perversely mesmerizing performance), a Master of the
Universe, has it all. He works at the prestigious Manhattan firm of
Pierce and Pierce, smokes expensive cigars, and inhabits a bleach-white
apartment, which used to signify wealth. What's a man who has everything
to do?</P>
<P>Murder, he wrote. Of course we knew that Bret Easton Ellis' sanguinary
satire American Psycho, a novel I devoured many years ago, would be
toned down in its translation to the silver screen. Unfortunately,
director Mary Harron and screenwriter Guinevere Turner have also
de-fanged the non-violent remainder of Ellis' free-floating narrative
and given it a Hollywood horseshit ending.</P>
<P>Such neutering was partially uncontrollable: on the page, first person
descriptions of title character Patrick Bateman's obsessively regimented
life read like a series of product placements, and everything down to
shampoo became a status symbol; Harron could not obtain permission to
mention various brands, and thus Patrick's materialism is no longer so
relentless.</P>
<P>But other changes are less reasonable, such as the by now prerequisite
twist ending, which castrates the film by reducing the Ted Bundy-ish
Bateman to a live-action Milton, the subservient office drone who would
wait until a co-worker was just out of earshot before making ridiculous
threats on his life in a series of Mike Judge cartoons.</P>
<P>The script's new, Fight Club-esque climactic scenario is an empty
gesture of atonement--Harron and Turner have glibly apologized for the
concept itself, literalising a snippet of Patrick's voice-over: "There
is no real me." They've also homogenized Wall Street; while the film
nicely plays up the interchangeable identities of its power-brokers
(they're distinguishable only by their business cards), it doesn't
emphasize their rock star existence. (I recall only one instance of
heavy drug use among the inner circle, whereas Ellis has Patrick
pill-popping every third line to tune his behaviour like a radio.)</P>
<P>I normally don't harp on the differences between a book and its
cinematic adaptation, but we're not dealing with a mass-market
bestseller here. The only reason to shoot American Psycho is to say you
did, not to start a franchise or mount a star vehicle. Harron's American
Psycho is more interested in toying with our desire to see it (witness
the clichéd opening sequence in which we are misled to believe that
raspberry sauce is actually dripping blood) than shedding some light on
the era of conspicuous consumption. (Or, at least, Ellis' take on it.)</P>
<P>The one great, arguably feminist aspect that Harron and Turner have
brought to the project is a sense of paranoid fantasy: the movie
occasionally steps outside of Patrick's P.O.V., which Ellis never did,
to illuminate the fear of his victims.

BY THE WAY...
Because I live in Ontario, Canada, I viewed the uncut version of
American Psycho. Harron was forced to trim about one minute of rather
tame kink from a three-way sex scene in order to avoid the stigmatic
NC-17 rating, just another demonstration of the Motion Picture
Association of America's bass ackwards agenda: Patrick butchering a
homeless man and chasing a woman with chainsaw were deemed fit for mass
consumption without any alterations.</P>
