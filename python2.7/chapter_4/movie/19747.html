<PRE>`Deep Blue Sea' – Sharkfest Provides Moderate Bite
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>DBS is a film that follows a formulaic storytelling mechanism that is
as familiar to us as the smell of buttered popcorn.  And if you've ever
seen any of the `Alien' movies, then in many ways, you've already seen
this film.  The similarities between these films are as abundant as the
gory shark attacks that are peppered throughout this film.  In `Alien',
the setting is a remote research station somewhere in space.  Here, the
setting is a research station somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.  In
`Alien' a band of humans must survive to escape an infestation of
oozing, flesh-eating creatures.  Here, a band of humans must survive to
escape several very, very large sharks on the loose.  But these are no
ordinary sharks.  These predators are 25 feet long, and their brains
have been altered in a way as to make them amazingly intelligent,
agile, and menacing.</P>
<P>The research station is headed by Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron
Burrows), a passionate scientist on the verge of a discovery that could
change the face of medicine.  As humans age, brain activity slows down
considerably.  As a result many suffer greatly from degenerative
diseases, such as Alzheimer's.  Yet sharks, for some reason, never
suffer from these effects.  Their brains remain fully functional
throughout their life span.  Her project is to find a way to extract
the protein within the shark's brain responsible for this effect so
that humans can take advantage of these benefits too – sort of a super
gingko biloba.  But she faces some overwhelming obstacles.  Funding has
been cut which forces her to take shortcuts and to overlook safety
precautions.  Meanwhile, to extract enough protein, the sharks' brains
have been genetically altered.  The side effect is that it makes them
more ferocious and smarter.  And did I mention that these beasts are 25
feet long?  It's a recipe for disaster, and when the sharks eventually
grow smart enough to fight back, the woeful few crew members on this
isolated research station will become nothing more than feeder fish. </P>
<P>I think that when looking at a movie such as this, there are two
components that will determine whether something like this can be
recommended or not.  One is whether we like the hapless souls fighting
to stay alive.  And for the most part, I liked the quirky cast of
characters, especially the macho shark wrangler (Thomas Jane) and a
delightful bible-quoting cook (LL Cool J).  The shark wrangler is
well-suited to stay alive, but his crazy heroics may get him killed. 
Meanwhile, when a shark enters the cook's partially flooded kitchen, he
tries to hide in his own oven.  But the shark is smart enough to set
the oven to 400 degrees.  Perhaps, this shark prefers his dinner
cooked.  To be sure, many will meet an untimely and unexpected horrible
end.  But these are two characters that I cared for and wanted to see
survive.  The other component, of course, is the action sequences. 
And, for the most part, they are all well done.  They involve the
familiar scenes where fierce creatures are chasing after humans through
narrow passageways while the whole compound around them is slowly about
to self-destruct.  Meanwhile, the characters all do their best to
escape from the jaws of death, do what they can to improvise their way
out of seemingly hopeless situations, and work together to make it to
freedom.</P>
