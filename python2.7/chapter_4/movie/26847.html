Susan Granger's review of "RUGRATS IN PARIS: THE MOVIE: (Paramount Pictures)</P>
<P>   In this animated sequel to the highly successful "Rugrats
Movie" which sprang from the Nickelodeon TV series, the focus is on
Chuckie (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh), rather than baby Tommy
(voiced by E.G. Daily). It seems Chuckie's mommy has gone to heaven
and he really, really, really wants a new mommy, which puts pressure
on his dad Chas (voiced by Michael Bell). The theme of wanting to have
a complete family is particularly resonant today - what with death,
divorce and remarriage so prevalent. Somehow, a trip to Paris is tied
into opening your heart and moving on. But it's not the touristy Paris
of the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower or the Seine. Most of the action takes
place in an amusement park, EuroReptarland, which is an obvious poke
at EuroDisneyland. The main Reptar attraction has broken and only Stu
Pickles (voiced by Jack Riley) can repair it - hence, the family trip
which includes Chas and Chuckie. Sparks fly from the nasty, Cruella
DeVil-like park manager, Coco La Bouche (voiced by Susan Sarandon),
who realizes that she must marry in order to get a promotion. Spurred
on by meddling matchmaker Angelica (voiced by Cheryl Chase), with the
aid of her pretentious assistant, Jean-Claude (voiced by John
Lithgow), Coco plots to wed Chas, even though she loathes
children. There's potty humor and a kid-pleasing climactic chase
involving the Rugrats on the repaired dinosaur and Jean-Claude in his
huge, mechanical Escargot, plus cameos from Debbie Reynolds, Tim Curry
and Casey Kasem. Musically, there's Sinead O'Connor's rendition of
"When You Love" and the BahaMen's catchy "Who Let the Dogs Out." On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Rugrats in Paris" is a
fast-paced, amusing 6 for tiny tykes - and it's quite tolerable for
adults.</P>
