<PRE>CAN'T HARDLY WAIT
a review by Josh Schirmer
===</PRE>
<PRE>* * * * out of * * * * *</PRE>
<P>Maybe my review is unfair, me being a teenager and this being a teen
movie. It's a well known fact that every teen movie that comes down the
pike is hailed by our generation as, "Like, the most kick-a** movie
ever!" (For those of you unfamiliar with the way teenagers talk, that's
like giving it 'a very enthusiastic thumbs up' -- eat your out, Gene and
Roger.) And that review holds it's ground until the next one comes
along. We started with Empire Records, then Scream, I Know What You Did
Last Summer, Scream 2, Titanic and so on. And now that summer is in full
swing and reruns have set it, we need something new to keep us
entertained. How about another "most kick-a**" teen movie?</P>
<P>Now, I'll be honest. Out of the movies listed above, the only one I
REALLY enjoyed was Titanic. Parents and teachers always tell me I'm
mature for my age, and that makes me proud. They have their reasons, too
-- I'm the kind of kid that actually focuses during class, keeps myself
busy with sports and other extra-curricular activities, and lists my
favorite movie as "As Good As It Gets". And teen movies rarely excite
me. Nevertheless, I joined a group of my friends and headed off to see
"Can't Hardly Wait".</P>
<P>And to tell the truth, I actually had fun.</P>
<P>At first glance, Can't Hardly Wait is a simple pageant of "boy is in
love with girl that doesn't know he exists". But a viewing proves that
the movie is more than that -- rather, it's a simple pageant of growing
up and reaching your peak. And it approaches it humorously, barraged
with heaping honesty.</P>
<P>Many critics have pointed out that the characters have no depth -- if
you ask me, this was the story's intention. I think to truly enjoy the
movie, you have to look at the characters for who they most resemble in
your own little group of high-school friends. From there, you yourself
can determine their back stories and what they're feeling.</P>
<P>And (coming as a REAL shocker in a teen movie), there is a lesson in
diguise. The movie simply states live for the moment, because the moment
is all that should matter. That, and (to borrow a line from the film),
"Fate works in some f---ed up ways."</P>
<P>There have been better movies this summer (Truman Show comes to mind),
but there have been worse -- like Godzilla. Give this one a shot. Your
kids are guarateed to think that it's the "most kick-a**" film ever (or
until the next one), but you might actually find something in it you
enjoy.</P>
