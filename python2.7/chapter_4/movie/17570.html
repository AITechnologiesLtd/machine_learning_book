<PRE>_EDtv_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Much like how his character, Ed Pekurny, finds fame as the subject of a
24-hour "reality" cable network, Matthew McConaughey should find his
falling star back on the rise as the lead in _EDtv_, Ron Howard's amiable
goof of a comedy.  McConaughey is a charismatic charmer as Ed, a
Texas-to-San Francisco transplant whose life becomes fodder for the
TV-viewing masses, but unlike Truman Burbank in Peter Weir's
similarly-themed (and far superior) _The_Truman_Show_, Ed is fully aware
of the cameras.  But as with Truman, Ed, while initially intrigued with
the notion of having all eyes on him, comes to yearn for freedom,
especially after it creates strain between and his girlfriend Shari
(Jenna Elfman)--who, as it happens, is the ex of Ed's wilder older
brother Ray (Woody Harrelson).</P>
<P>Howard and screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel don't have the
high satirical aims of _Truman's_ Weir and writer Andrew Niccol; they
simply aim to entertain.  And after a tentative start, _EDtv_ picks up
comedic steam and does just that, amusingly exploring the ramifications
of Ed's sudden, if largely unmerited, celebrity, from opportunistic
groupies (Elizabeth Hurley's sizzling model/aspiring actress) to the
diminished privacy of his colorful family.  Harrelson is predictably
effective as a blowhard, and Elfman (Golden Globe winner for TV's
_Dharma_and_Greg_) shows major promise as a screen star, but the
McConaughey magnetism is so overwheming that the film could easily have
been called _MATTtv_.</P>
