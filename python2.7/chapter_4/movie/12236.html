<P>REVIEW:  Scream 2 (1997 - USA, 1998 - Australia)</P>
<PRE>by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<PRE>3 and a half stars out of 5</PRE>
<P>As the horror movie expert Randy (Jamie Kennedy) states: There are certain
rules one must abide by in order to create a successful sequel.  Scream 2; just
like its predecessor, structures itself as a parody to all those predictable
horror films that have filtered through Hollywood for decades.  But as the wise
Randy also remarks  No sequels are good as the first.</P>
<P>Set two years after the original killings in Scream, Sidney (Neve Campbell) and
Randy are now in university and have put the tormenting memories of their past
behind them.  TV Reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) has written a book based
around the killings two years ago, and its just recently been made into a
popular film named Stab.</P>
<P>Just as we witnessed Drew Barrymore killed off in the opening scenes of Scream,
another celebrity (if you can call Jada Pinkett one) is iced early on in the
sequel whilst attending Stab.  So begins a spree of copycat killings on campus.</P>
<P>Goofy small town cop Dewey (David Arquette) also returns, and along with Gale
and Randy attempts to figure out who the killer is.  One particularly engaging
conversation with himself and Randy occurs, where the rules of sequels are
observed.</P>
<P>Number one, the body count is always bigger.  Number two, the death scenes are
always much more elaborate.  Number three, never ever, under any circumstances
assume that the killer is dead.  Although the more attentive viewer of Scream
would have noticed that some of the rules were obviously broken, this is not
the case for Scream 2, as everything mentioned is carried out to the fullest
degree.</P>
<P>The nine killings in Scream compared to fourteen in the sequel speaks for
itself, but statistics are unfortunately limited to what happens rather than how
it happens.  Scream 2 is considerably less scarier than the first, and although
director Wes Craven (infamous for the Nightmare on Elm Street series and Scream)
follows the same shock-commotion formula, much of the seductiveness and charm
that its predecessor has seems to have been lost.  That is, as much charm as a
gruesome horror film can have.</P>
<P>If youre put off by the promise of good looking teens acting irrationally and
predictably, rest assured  the characters slip up but the film rarely does.
The only major stab-in-the-foot that Scream 2 gives itself is the huge amount of
gore yet marginally small amount of fear that is bestowed to the audience.</P>
<P>Also, as many horror films tend to do, Scream 2 kills off its most interesting
character long before credits fill the screen.  As to whom this character is I
will leave you guessing  but allow me also add that he gave both films a sense
of structuring and originality  so it would be incredibly hard to make a
successful third installment (which is currently in consideration) without him.</P>
<P>Although not as thrilling or classy as the original, Scream 2s Scooby Doo
who-done-it style proves to be a cut above the rest, and Wes Craven has once
again given a much-needed refreshment to the horror genre of which he has
successfully mastered.</P>
