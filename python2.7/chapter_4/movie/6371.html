<P>     Early in Lars von Trier's shattering new drama BREAKING THE WAVES,
there is a scene in which Bess MacNeill (Emily Watson), an innocent young
woman living in a coastal Scottish town, is deflowered by her husband Jan
(Stellan Skarsgaard) in a bathroom at their wedding reception.  It is the
kind of situation you might have seen before played for laughs in low-brow
comedies, usually because one of the parties in the bathroom is not the
bride or the groom.  In one astonishing moment, however, von Trier shows
that he is not going to take you anywhere you have been before, allowing
his hand-held camera to linger on the face of a woman whose reaction is
nothing as simple as lust or anxiety.  It is nothing less than awe at the
overpowering emotions of making love for the first time which plays out
before us, and introduces us to one of the most utterly fascinating film
characters I have ever seen, played by an actor of unbelievable range.</P>
<P>     Ladies and gentlemen, please meet Emily Watson, and do yourselves the
favor of remembering that name.  It is true that she has been given the
kind of role which most actors (particularly women) would commit several
felonies for -- a fragile, unstable woman who risks the censure of her
strict Calvinist community in pursuing her love for lusty outsider Jan --
but Watson brings to it the kind of performance which doesn't so much
impress you as transport you.  When we first see Bess kneel in prayer to
God, only to hear her play both roles in a dialogue, it is startling and
disturbing, and makes her somewhat pitiable; later, when Bess finds
herself unable to summon God's voice, it is somehow just as terrible.
Watson is as gloriously innocent touching male genitalia for the first
time as she is anguished when Jan leaves to return to the offshore oil rig
on which he works.  There is not an emotion she does not touch, or which
does not leave you fumbling for superlatives.</P>
<P>     Watson is so good that her performance might overwhelm a lesser story
made by a lesser film-maker, but BREAKING THE WAVES is no simple love
story.  Much of the action takes place after an accident on the oil rig
renders Jan paralyzed, a tragedy to which he responds by asking Bess to
have sex with other men and describe the encounters to him.  That
storyline alone would make BREAKING THE WAVES a risky venture, but von
Trier takes it to another level of audacity by making it an exploration of
love and religious faith at its most extreme.  As Bess gradually descends
into a world of degraded sexuality she can't possibly understand, von
Trier begins to build up imagery which suggests Bess as a Christ figure.
She experiences her own agony in the garden as she pleads to have her
burden taken away; she is condemned by the religious elders of her
community; she is first betrayed, then shunned, by those closest to her;
she even undergoes her own Way of the Cross, pelted with stones by a group
of kids.  It is powerful, resonant, and not a little bit sacrilegious.</P>
<P>     And BREAKING THE WAVES is nearly as likely to offend those of a
liberal sensibility as those more conservatively inclined.  It would be
easy to recoil against the idea of a woman with a history of mental
illness subjected to violence and indignity by her own husband and,
perhaps, even God.  Those whose knees would jerk at the mere notion of a
woman who would sacrifice anything for her man are going to have major
problems with BREAKING THE WAVES, yet the film's indescribable final shot
may address outrage on both sides with wordless daring:  our earthly
notions of good and evil, of right and wrong, may be burdens that only a
simple mind motivated only by love can overcome in order to know the will
of God.</P>
<P>     BREAKING THE WAVES, at once intellectually challenging and
emotionally draining, is presented by Lars von Trier in a visual style he
also used in THE KINGDOM, a film-to-video-to-film trick which renders
everything a dirty brown.  The day-to-day world is a bleak thing in
BREAKING THE WAVES, but between the chapters in the film are hypnotic
motion-postcards (computer manipulated by artist Per Kirkeby) which
provide surges of hope.  That structure, along with the jittery
photography, are as much a key to the title of BREAKING THE WAVES as
anything which occurs in the film.  Lars von Trier takes his audience for
a ride on a sea of emotions which cannot leave it unmoved.  Love it or
loathe it, you will not be able to ignore BREAKING THE WAVES, or the work
of Emily Watson as a woman who proves that love is a mighty power.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 permanent waves:  10.</PRE>
