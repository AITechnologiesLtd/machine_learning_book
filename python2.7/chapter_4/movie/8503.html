<P>North By Northwest (1959) 136m. *****  D: Alfred Hitchcock.  Hitchcock
matched, but never topped this grand tale of mistaken identity and
political intrigue.  Cary Grant stars as Roger Thornhill, a Madison
Avenue ad executive who is mistaken for a spy by the spies' rivals.
After escaping an attempt at his life, Thornhill begins a cross-country
chase in search of his alter-ego.  Along the way he meets the mysterious
Eve, who may be more invovled than she appears.
While the film's final half hour can't match the frenetic pace of the
beginning (what could?), the total package is extraordinary.  Hitchcock
utilizes familiar themes (mistaken identity, domineering mother, the icy
blond woman), and crafts them into a film possibly equaled, but
unsurpassed before or after in sheer entertainment value.  Cary Grant is
at his deadpan best as Thornhill, the harrowed yet poised everyman.  He
gets to deliver some of the bestlines in cinema: "These men , they
poured a bottle of bourbon down my throat - no mother they didn't give me
a chaser."  Eve St. Marie  is equally adept as the cold, sexy Eve. The
rest of the cast, including Martin Landau and James Mason all do fine
work in small roles.
North By Northwest is a timeless film from a lost era of filmmaking.
Time is taken to develop character, to give motivation and give the
audience reason to care for or dislike them.  Today's filmmakers would
do well to study NBNW.  The plot never drags, but time is taken to let
Grant woo St. Marie on a train, or to let Grant ham it up while playing
drunk.  While not the  deepest, or most disturbing of Hitchcock, NBNW
might be the most fun.</P>
