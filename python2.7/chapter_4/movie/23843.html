<PRE>A BUG'S LIFE
A film review by David N. Butterworth

<P>        From its opening frames of a fallen leaf settling on a pool of
water, it's clear that "A Bug's Life" is no ordinary kiddie cartoon.  The
attention to detail in this scene is extraordinary and, fortunately for the
viewer, that level of detail is maintained throughout the entire
production.  Not just in terms of the animation which--from Pixar, the
studio that previously brought us "Toy Story"--is nothing less than
amazing, but in terms of the writing, the characterizations, the music--in
fact, the whole kit and caboodle.  "A Bug's Life," no more a kid's film
than "Toy Story" was a kid's film, has it all: a clever story (a misfit ant
tries to save his colony from despotic grasshoppers by rounding up some
"bad bugs" but accidentally recruits a bunch of inept circus performers
instead); strong characters voiced by skilled performers (Kevin Spacey is
perfect as Hopper, the evil grasshopper leader, Julia Louis-Dreyfus is
Princess Atta, and Dave Foley (TV's "NewsRadio") plays the hapless Flik); a
rousing musical score by Randy Newman; a wry, irreverent, and often-times
hilarious script by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton that caters to
grown-ups as much as it does children; and unsurpassed computer animation.
In fact, there is so much to take in on a first viewing that "A Bug's Life"
is the kind of film that benefits from its home video release, with the
opportunity to rewind and replay favorite bits (no doubt including the
end-credit "bloopers").  "A Bug's Life" also features the vocal talents of
Phyllis Diller, Denis Leary, Bonnie Hunt, Roddy McDowall, John Ratzenberger
("Cheers"), "Fraser"'s David Hyde Pierce, and the late, great Madeline
Kahn, to name a few.  Highly recommended.</P>
