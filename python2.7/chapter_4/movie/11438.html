<PRE>AS GOOD AS IT GETS
A Film Review By Daniel Chodos
Copyright Dan Chodos 1998</PRE>
<P>    "What if this is as good as it gets?", bellows Melvin Udall (Jack
Nicholson) midway through the film in a psychiatrist's waiting room. James
Brook's delightful new comedy answers that question with a firm "no, it gets
better Jack," and then takes us on a journey to prove it. There are three
central characters to "As Good As It Gets": Melvin the obsessive compulsive
but successful writer, Carol (Helen Hunt), the warm hearted, single mothered
waitress, and Simon (Greg Kinnear), the gay artist who lives next door. Each
have something to gain from one another and although their stories knock on
the door of clichesville it is entertaining none the less to watch.</P>
<P>    The film relies on Nicholson's natural screen charm to get us to
overlook his homophobia and racist reactions to the full illustrious city of
New York.. We're supposed to juicily bite into the fact that his bigotry
should be excused because he has obsessive compulsive disorder. In that
aspect "As Good As It Gets" insults its audience floundering in between a
serious character study of people OCD and a light hearted comedy. Take one
scene where Melvin obsessively washes his germs away using 3 bars of soap.
It's a painful scene to watch, sloppily giving the audience an excuse to
pity poor Melvin. It doesn't belong in this movie because there is no
justification for it. It's obvious from the get go that Brook's has trouble
layering the comedy he's aiming for with a character study the we deserve.</P>
<P>    The plot unfolds like a pyramid as Melvin attempts to reach for a higher
level of happiness in his life. Carol, the waitress at a local restaurant he
routinely eats in has a sick son with a very serious case of asthma. In an
almost desperate attempt to cling to the only person who will give him the
time of day, Melvin essentially buys Carol's affection in somewhat awkward
and seedy circumstances. We know from their first encounter on screen that
it's only a matter of time (in fact, too long) before Melvin and Carol get
romantically linked.</P>
<P>    But what stands out is the terrific performance by Kinnear as the
understated Simon. It seems as if Brooks doesn't even try to reach for
something and as a result comes a magnificent character developed from
simple storytelling. If he had only applied that same style to Melvin and
Carol, leaving out the unnecessary footnotes and relationship filler, we
would have fluency on the same level (although more serious) as Woody
Allen's "Annie Hall".</P>
<P>    While Nicholson's charm temporarily sways us from thinking about the
awkward moments, there are much deeper questions we want answered. Why after
so long does Melvin want to change? We want to believe that Melvin is a more
complex character than nasal-yet-funny phrases like "do you get me
sweetheart?" Unfortunately, Melvin and the film are funny, but laughter here
is only skin deep.</P>
