<P>Summary
    Mistaken identity spells disaster for The Dude (Jeff Bridges), the laziest
man in L.A. County. Two thugs invade his home and assault him, looking for
money
to pay off his wife's debt. The only problem is The Dude is not married and we
learn that although his real name is Jeff Lebowski, it is not the same wealthy
Jeff Lebowski who has a wife that owes money to the wrong people. The thugs
leave, but not before one of them urinates on The Dude's prized rug.
    The Dude wants reparations for the loss of his rug. After conferring with
his two bowling buddies Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi), he
decides that since his rug was ruined due to the negligence of Jeff Lebowski's
wife Bunny (Tara Reid), he should seek out the Big Lebowski himself (David
Huddleston) for restitution. It does not go well, as Mr. Lebowski scolds and
berates The Dude as if he were a child caught stealing money from his mother's
purse.
    The Dude's dealings with Lebowski are not finished however as The Dude is
hired to be a courier for him. It appears that Bunny Lebowski has been
kidnapped
and Lebowski needs someone to deliver the ransom to her captors. The Dude
accepts and with the help of Walter promptly botches the delivery. Nothing
worse
could have happened to The Dude as he becomes fully involved in the bizarre
situation surrounding Bunny Lebowski including involvement in pornography
industry and association with German nihilists.
    Could the scenario possibly get worse for The Dude? His love interest is
the
Big Lebowski's daughter Maude (Julianne Moore), who initially assaults him also
(she didn't care for his solution for his rug replacement). She is quite a
character, as flying around in a harness while naked, spraying paint appears to
be her favorite pastime, and her acquaintances would make Marilyn Manson seem
like a Boy Scout. The Dude must deal with all of these strange people (his
friends included), unusual circumstances and survive countless assaults (some
self-inflicted) to uncover the truth to the wacky Lebowski family.</P>
<P>Commentary
    After the credits rolled for this film I sat in the theater trying to
decide
whether I actually liked it or not. Two hours later I still could not make up
my
mind. To call this film "offbeat" would be a tremendous understatement. There
are some truly bizarre films that work well (Matthew Bright's 'Freeway' comes
to
mind), and some films that have some bizarre moments (the Gimp scene in 'Pulp
Fiction') that have the same effect. The Big Lebowski falls under the former
category and some elements work, some do not.
    The Coen's definitely have a style all their own. If you were to walk in on
this movie and not know what it was, you could pick out it was 'a Coen' in
minutes, much like Stanley Kubrick films. The Big Lebowski's high points are
definitely vintage Coen: colorful characters, a great ear for dialogue,
seemingly unnecessary extra characters (like Marge Gunderson's lunch date in
'Fargo') and funny self-parodies. All of these elements are well done. Jeff
Bridges does a wonderful job playing the spaced out Dude, and John Goodman gets
the great role of the psychopathic Vietnam war veteran on the verge of a
killing
spree. This film is funny and has some nice comic subtleties, like when the
Dude
goes to the Supermarket just to buy cream and pays for it with a check.
    What I did not like was the fact that this movie is far too strange. I
enjoy
offbeat films more than the average movie fan, but this was ridiculous. It
tries
too hard. What was the point in having the Maude character introduced with that
silly harness? What was with those strange dream sequences? I usually dislike
dream sequences because it gives the director free reign to do whatever they
please without explanation. The only normal character may be Donny, if only
Walter would actually let him speak.
    It would have been nearly impossible for the Coens' to duplicate the
success
of 'Fargo', but this film is a slight disappointment nevertheless. However, I
will still marginally recommend the film because it does have its' moments, and
it is unfair to hold it up to 'Fargo' standards.</P>
