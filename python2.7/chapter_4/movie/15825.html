<P>"A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries," is the first James Ivory-directed 
film I can recall that is set after the 1930's. Granted, this bit of 
information doesn't really hold very much importance, but I am glad that 
Ivory has made something a little bit away from his norm, and it paid 
off.</P>
<P>The film starts off during the 1960's, where the Willis', an American 
family living in France, adopt Benoit (Samuel Gruen), a young boy whose 
real mother was only fifteen when she gave birth to him. Bill Willis 
(Kris Kristofferson), a writer, and his wife, Marcella (Barbara 
Hershey), are just about the best parents he could hope for. They are 
caring, considerate, and generally good people. Their daughter, Channe 
(Luisa Conlon), is just about Benoit's age, and although she is, at 
first, put off by a new member in the family, she quickly becomes 
attached to her new brother. In these opening sections, not much occurs 
in the way of a clear-cut story, but it is deceptive. By choice, 
Benoit's name is changed to Billy, to sound more American. Channe gets 
into trouble at school when she forges her father's signature. She also 
has a peculiar run-in with a boy around her tender age of eight who 
makes sexual advances towards her. Life goes on.</P>
<P>It is in the last ninety minutes when, "A Soldier's Daughter Never 
Cries," grows the most momentum and becomes especially heartfelt and 
truthful. About seven years pass, leaving Channe and Billy to now be 
young teenagers (now played by Leelee Sobieski and Jesse Bradford). When 
signs that Bill may be forming a heart disease, the family moves back to 
the United States, and as he desperately tries to finish a book he has 
been writing before he dies, Billy grows distant from everyone, and, not 
knowing how to act as a young adult, Channe becomes highly promiscuous 
at school. </P>
<P>Through everything that occurs during the film, the element that most 
stands out is the warm, unconventional relationship between Channe and 
her father, who does not look down on Channe when he discovers she has 
been having sex, but instead, sympathizes and understands what she is 
going through. In one particularly startling, perfectly realized moment, 
Bill tells Channe and her boyfriend to stay at their house for the 
night. "I'd rather you be under my roof and doing it properly, rather 
than being in the backseat of a car," he says. Bill is the type of 
father who cares so much for his children, that he would risk anything 
for them, and we really get a sense of the love that he feels for 
Channe, and vice versa. In another touching scene, after Channe has gone 
to a party for New Year's Eve, leaving her family at home, she calls her 
father right after it turns midnight to wish him a happy new year, 
knowing that he very well may not be around the following year.</P>
<P>It is in the individual moments and particular performances that make, 
"A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries," a much better film than it might 
have been if, say, a Hollywood studio had made it. The film deals with 
many serious subjects, but never grows heavy-handed, nor predictable, in 
its telling of the story. It is easy to throw in a lot of sappy 
melodrama into a drama, but it is far more effective to stay true to the 
film and always remain realistic, and that it what this picture does. </P>
<P>The film is broken into three chapters, which is a nice, but 
unnecessary, touch. The first chapter, "Billy," tells of when Channe and 
Billy are young children; the chapter, entitled "Francis," focuses on 
Channe, now a teen, and her strong friendship with Francis (Anthony Roth 
Costanzo), a boy who remains faithful to Channe, even though he knows 
they will never be more than buddies; and the final chapter, called, 
"Daddy," centers on the family after they return to the United States. 
It is the second two chapters that are the most successul, as the 
opening section is more about the set-up of the characters. "Francis," 
is strenthened a great deal by its gentle relationship between Channe 
and Francis, as well as Costanzos memorable and accurate performance. In 
one particular scene that stands out, Channe gets her period while in 
class, and Francis works her through the problem so that she will get 
out of the class without anyone else knowing what has happened.
The performances in the film are all natural and beautiful to watch. I 
cannot recall Kris Kristofferson having such a humanistic role before, 
and he couldn't have been better. Barbara Hershey, at first, seems to be 
playing one-note until the climax, in which we learn much more about 
her, and she is given some well-written scenes with her two children. 
But as good as all of the performances are, it is Leelee Sobieski ("Deep 
Impact") who is a standout. In her portrayal of Channe, Sobieski is so 
honest and unaffected that, for me, it stopped being a performance and 
became a real character, as if she were in a documentary. It is one of 
the most effortless performances I have seen from a youth, and she 
deserves an Oscar nod for her work here.</P>
<P>"A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries," although occasionally uneven, is one 
of the best films I have seen in a while that has to do with family, and 
gets most of the details right. The things that are dealt with, in 
lesser hands, may have turned into a television "Movie of the Week," but 
director James Ivory obviously knew what he was doing when he made this 
film. It is also evident that Ivory felt a deep connection with the 
material, as if it were somewhat autobiographical. The movie rarely 
feels written. Although, perhaps, there could have been more of a 
driving force behind everything that happens throughout, it in no way 
dampered my feelings for the film. "A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries," 
is a powerful film about families, in general, and the many problems 
they face each day.</P>
