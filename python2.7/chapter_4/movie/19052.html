A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Dennis Dugan</PRE>
<P>Written by: by Steve Franks, Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler</P>
<P>Starring: Adam Sandler, Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) is a rich, childish, angry man who has just
been dumped by his girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson). In a bid to impress
Vanessa Sonny impersonates his friend Kevin (Jon Stewart) and adopts a 5
year old boy named Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse) while Kevin is on an
overseas trip. Under Sonny's supervision Julian soon learns to lie to
women, tell people how he "wipes his ass," throw tantrums, and scream for
his "God damned" treats. Self centered, Julian breaks a school classmate's
arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong.
Meanwhile Sonny bribes Julian with sugary talk, food, toys, and flashy
promises in order to get the kid to perform. Not surprisingly the
government takes Julian away from Sonny's incompetent supervision, and this
leads to a custody battle. </P>
<P>Opinion:
It's a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk,
and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent
kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy
behavior. That's the essence of BIG DADDY. </P>
<P>But there's a bigger issue involved: marketing. Movies that are rated PG
and PG-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below.
On TV, film clips advertise these movies as family-friendly hit comedies.
Then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like
Austin Powers with characters named Fat Bastard - - or BIG DADDY where
adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds
and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment. </P>
<P>Folks in Hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy
stuff, but I think most American parents would agree that early childhood
is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media
market exploitation. To many American mothers there's probably nothing more
pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised
little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father Adam
Sandler jokes about a woman's "ice cold tits."</P>
