A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: If MORTAL KOMBAT is at the high end of the video-games-to-movies
spectrum....</P>
<P>Well, at least they tried. Alas, STREET FIGHTER is still a lousy movie,
period. They were trying to make at least an enjoyably lousy movie, but they
haven't even managed to do that. Video games often make bad movies, but at
their best they can make enjoyably pulpy ones like MORTAL KOMBAT. At their
worst, you get SUPER MARIO BROTHERS. Or this.</P>
<P>Capcom's video game, which revitalized a sagging coin-op video game market
and created a trend for many other games to follow, had a few firsts: it
featured a diverse and intriguing cast of characters to choose from, and it
also featured a number of strong and visually arresting female characters
(Chun Li and Cammy), who did more than hang around and wait to get saved. I
agree: It all sounds like the recipe for an engaging movie. This isn't it.
It has the heart of a made-for-TV film and the mind of one of those
thimble-deep comic-book tie-ins that got packaged with video game cartridges
when I was younger.</P>
<P>The movie takes the basic character templates from the game and casts them
in a thin plot that takes heavy cues from the Gulf War. General Bison (Raul
Julia, excellent) is your usual power-mad dictator who's kidnapped a bunch
of Allied Nations soldiers and is holding them hostage for a cool twenty
billion. Leading the AN attack to recover them is Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude
Van Damme), who also has a personal score to settle with the self-styled
General.</P>
<P>There are other folks who are equally set on revenge: journalist Chun-li
Zhang (Ming-Na Wen, the next-best thing in the movie) and her crew (E. Honda
[Peter Navy Tuiasosopo] and Balrog [Grand L. Bush]). What up, guys? I
thought Chun-li was with INTERPOL -- but never mind. The movie plays fast
and loose with the Street Fighter "mythology", which is OK, I guess, as long
as the results are at least passably entertaining. And they are.
Occasionally, there are some great moments -- watch what happens when
Chun-li first does her thing -- but they don't add up to a great movie.</P>
<P>The actors do what they can with the material, which is sometimes witty and
sometimes labored. Jean-Claude Van Damme isn't bad (how good can he be?),
just tacky, and Raul Julia is a lot of fun -- but costumes and makeup cannot
hide his obvious gauntness. This was his last theatrical movie --
depressing, especially since the movie was dedicated to him. I liked Wen's
Chun-li -- she looks and moves like the real article, and provides a hint of
where this movie really could have gone.</P>
<P>What went wrong here? There's a lot to look at. The set and costume
designers went out of their way to make the movie look interesting. The
fights -- some of them clearly modeled on the game's own action, of course
-- are acceptably put together. But there's nothing to push the movie over
the top and make it really special, instead of just something you knew they
were gonna try eventually. It has all the hallmarks of a road already
traveled, instead of something where they took risks with the goofy material
and made it into something wild and unique. It's too routine, too
predictable, too careful, and too safe.</P>
<P>POSTSCRIPT: There is a 1993 Hong Kong movie version of Street Fighter that's
worth tracking down. It stars Jacky Cheung as Guile, Chingmy Yau as Chun-li
and Simon Yam and Andy Lau. It's nowhere nearly as well-produced, but it is
ten thousand times more anarchic and entertaining than this one could ever
be.</P>
<P>POSTSCRIPT II: An animated feature-length version of the game also exists,
as well as a TV series. The series is nicely done; the feature-length anime
is not.</P>
