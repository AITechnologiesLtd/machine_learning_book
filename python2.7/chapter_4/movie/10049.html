<P>Beauty & the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas</P>

<P>Our rating: Three lava lamps (out of five).</P>
<P>By now, we've all gotten used to the Disney Plan for Animation: Release an
animated movie with as many possible elements in common with previously
successful films, and if it takes off, release sequels to video. With
really successful movies, like Aladdin, those sequels may even spawn a
television cartoon series.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the direct-to-video sequels thus far have been
disappointing. The Return of Jafar and Aladdin and the King of Thieves,
while commercially successful, were rather pale knockoffs of the original,
in story, song, and animation. By the time King of Thieves came out, we
were ready to give up on Disney's OAV (original animated video) efforts for
good.</P>
<P>This winter, however, Disney has released Beauty and the Beast: The
Enchanted Christmas. While it's still not in the same league as the
original film, it is a much better effort than either of the two Aladdin
videos.</P>
<P>When we heard about this sequel to Beauty and the Beast, we were concerned
that any film taking place after the original would not feature the Beast,
who was a large part of the appeal of the first movie. Fortunately, this
movie takes place during the winter montage of the original film; it is
presented as an "untold chapter." Thus all of the original characters are
present, and with their original voices (including Jerry Orbach, Angela
Lansbury, & David Ogden-Stiers). Also present are several new characters,
with equally impressive voice actors. And let us not forget the inimitable
Frank Welker, man of a thousand voices, most of them attributed to animals.</P>
<P>As Christmas approaches during Belle's first few months in the Beast's
castle, the enchanted servants inform her that the Beast has forbidden the
celebration of Christmas in the castle. It was on Christmas Day that the
self-serving prince turned away the enchantress in disguise and was placed
under a spell, transorming him into the Beast. Not wanting to celebrate the
day of his own downfall, he calls a halt to Christmas.</P>
<P>Belle, of course, plans a Christmas celebration without him, enlisting the
help of the various servants-turned-household-objects. This leads to the
introduction of Angelique (Bernadette Peters), the castle's former
decorator, now transformed into an Angel tree-topper. Excited at the
prospect of celebrating Christmas once again, an initially-reluctant
Angelique and the other servants begin to decorate the castle and make
preparations. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, some of the castle's residents are conspiring to ruin
Belle's Christmas. These residents are Maestro Forte and Fife, a pipe organ
and piccolo who don't quite fit in with the rest of castle life. Maestro
Forte (voiced by Tim Curry) was once the court composer with a penchant for
gloomy compositions. Fife (Paul Reubens) is Forte's crony, doing Forte's
dirty work at the promise of a solo written expressly for the piccolo.
Because the Beast's depression has turned him on to Forte's dark music,
Forte feels the need to defend his newfound territory -- even if it means
killing Belle. In the end, of course, there will be a happy ending, because
this is not only a Disney film, it's a Disney film about Christmas.</P>
<P>As we mentioned before, the first thing to suffer in previous Disney OAV
sequels was the animation. Characters became distorted, the frame rate
dropped tremendously, and the backgrounds were just plain shoddy.
Fortunately, Enchanted Christmas doesn't suffer as much. Most of the
character animation, while not theater-quality, is well above average, and
the character design has barely changed. We think we can detect a slight
change in Belle, but the other characters are flawless. The specialty
animation, including the entirely computer-animated Maestro Forte, is
dazzling. Several musical sequences feature uniquely-animated segments that
are distinct from the rest of the film, and quite memorable. Watch for
Belle's storybook sequence and the ectoplasmic Cupids in Forte's big song.</P>
<P>The music, too, is above par. The tunes in the Aladdin sequels were either
forgettable or based on tunes from the original film, but these songs are
both original and memorable. We would have liked to have heard more from
Bernadette Peters, one of the most accomplished singers in voice acting,
but she was given at least one big number, so we did get something. </P>
<P>Like all Disney movies, Enchanted Christmas has a message, and it hammers
away at that message until all viewers are guaranteed to remember it.
Fortunately, this film's message is the same on multiple levels: just as
Belle reminds us that Christmas represents hope, so too does Enchanted
Christmas represent hope for quality OAVs from Disney. Okay Mickey, don't
drop the ball now.</P>
