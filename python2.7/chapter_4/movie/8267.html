<PRE>BABY SNAKES
---------------------
Starring: Frank Zappa, Terry Bozzio, Adrian Belew, Patrick O'Hearn,
and New York's Finest Crazy Persons
MPAA Rating:  R for Language
RUNNING TIME:  183 minutes</PRE>
<P>This three hour movie opens up with a view of singer/guitar
player/musician/composer Frank Zappa rehearsing with his fellow band
members.  All the rest displays a compilation of footage, mostly from
the concert at the Palladium in New York City, Halloween 1979.  Other
footage shows backstage foolishness, and AMAZING clay animation by
Bruce Bickford.</P>
<P>The performance of "Titties and Beer" played in this movie is very
entertaining, with drummer Terry Bozzio supplying the voice of the
devil.  Frank's guitar solos outdo any Van Halen or Hendrix I've ever
heard.</P>
<P>Bruce Bickford's outlandish clay animation is that beyond belief with
zooms, morphings, etc.  And actually, it doesn't even look like clay,
it looks like meat.</P>
