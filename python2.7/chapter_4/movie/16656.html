<P>_Blast_from_the_Past_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>It's a terrible premise: believing that America would be bombed by the
Russians in 1962, an eccentric but brilliant scientist (Christopher Walken)
and his pregnant wife (Sissy Spacek) lock themselves in a homey underground
fallout shelter.  After the timed locks open after 35 years, their son,
Adam (Brendan Fraser) is ready to go up to the surface to get more
supplies.  There he meets the oh-so-conveniently named Eve (Alicia
Silverstone), who schools the '60s-era-bred Adam in the ways of the '90s
L.A....and, of course, in love.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, however, _Blast_from_the_Past_ does have its charms, chief
among them being some good comic character work from Walken and Dave Foley,
who plays Eve's gay brother.  Fraser and Silverstone also have a sweet,
unforced romantic rapport.  But it's not enough to overcome the thudding
weight of the premise, which serves as the springboard for too many lame
gags, the lamest of all being a bar owner (Joey Slotnick) who thinks Adam
is God (don't ask).  In the end, the charm of _Blast_from_the_Past_ cannot
overpower the cheese.</P>
