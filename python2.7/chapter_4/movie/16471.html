<PRE>Stepmom</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Chris Columbus</PRE>
<P>Starring Julia Roberts, Susan Surrandon, Ed Harris</P>
<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P> Well, I just saw Shakespeare in Love.  That was filed under "S" for superb.
Three guesses what the "S" in Stepmom stood for.</P>
<P> If you guessed correctly, you have a very good adjective to describe the
utterly boring and idiotic movie by Chris Columbus.  If you haven't guessed
it, you will by the end of the review.</P>
<P> Stepmom follows Isabel (Roberts), fashion-photographer, stepmom TO BE, and
bitch extrodinaire.  It also follows Tammy (Surrandon): divorced mother,
terminally ill, and, again, bitch extrodinaire.  Both of these characters
are equally worthy of your hate, and both of these characters are supposed
to evoke some sort of sympathy from the viewers.</P>
<P> Needless to say, they don't.  The rest of the plot is that Tammy, Luke's
(Harris) ex-wife, is dying from cancer and still has the energy to bite the
head off of Isabel, Luke's unlikable girlfriend and later fiancée BUT NEVER
WIFE.  The entire movie takes all the substance of a very badly written poem
or short story and spreads it out like gum onto your shoe into a two hour
long modern version of the rack.</P>
<P> You don't laugh, you don't cry, you don't feel a thing.  The movie was
written by five writers, all of whom I am sure are nom de plums for monkeys
learning to type, and has nothing to show for the collaborative effort.
That, friends, is Hollywood at its best.  These people are being paid $1000
per screen minute or so and still are unable to turn out a product that
anyone in their right mind would think is anything other than crap.</P>
<P> Chris Columbus decided to make this film either as a victim of binge
drinking or a bet, either one of them ending in obvious disaster.  Susan
Surrandon, Julia Roberts, Ed Harris, and the two poor children who will be
forced to place Stepmom on their earlier filmographies, all get experience
with fake tears.</P>
<P> This was a film where my diatribe of picking on the film is more fun that
the film itself, and it is also a film to practice your aim of popcorn
kernels with.  Watching the film, I now understand the mind behind The Mad
Bomber, who placed pipe bombs in movie theatres in New York City during the
1950s.  Believe me, after seeing Stepmom, you will too.</P>
<P> Of the other unforgivable aspects of the film, besides exploiting cancer as
a sympathy-getter for a badly written role without any hope of sympathy, you
have the simple fact of the title: Stepmom.  Think about this.  Julia
Roberts is the girlfriend, and the fiancée, but never is she the stepmom.</P>
<P> Also you have the unforgivable mistake, and here comes a spoiler, that you
never actually see Susan Surrandon die.  As with Brandy in I Still Know What
You Did Last Summer, you keep waiting and waiting for the bitch to bite the
dust, but it never happens.  Instead, she tortures you with ten minute long
speeches and a film that feels like the ending of the story at the
beginning.</P>
<P> I thought I wouldn't find a film with more pseudo-drama than Varsity Blues,
but, on a melodramatic scale of one to ten, Stepmom is a ten.  Yes, if it
happened to me, I would care if it were happening, but as it happens to
them, I just try to stay awake.</P>
<P> For those who think they know what "S" stands for, it isn't sleepy and it
isn't stupid, but both of these apply.  Neither is it silly or sad or smart
or sassy or savvy.  None of those adjectives apply at all.  It would be
stuck in the middle of bad movies if it didn't try so damn much to be great.
But, aim hi, fall far...</P>
