RATCATCHER</PRE>
<PRE>Written and Directed by  Lynne Ramsay</PRE>
<PRE>Plan B     NR     94 min.   subtitles</PRE>
<P>     Lynne Ramsay's first feature is set in the grim and grimy world of 
Glasgow's public housing projects, during a garbage strike that has left 
the already bleak cityscape strewn with mountains of black plastic bags 
where rats swarm and children play.  And yet it's not exactly about 
poverty.  Ramsay's characters have food and shelter, decent clothing,  
telly, and dance records.  They have a subsistence level of comfort.  
What they don't have is hope.</P>
<P>     Ramsay, a former still photographer, begins her film with the 
almost still image of a little boy twisting inside a plastic shower 
curtain.  It suggests a caul, or a shroud, or a ghost.  The sound is 
muted, the action is in extreme slow motion, until the boy's mother 
cuffs him and tells him to stop messing with her shower curtain, and 
sends him outside to play.  He meets a friend, James, they horse around 
in the shallow canal that runs by the projects, and a moment later he's 
drowned. </P>
<P>     "That wasn't your main character," Ramsay is telling us, "this is 
your main character," and the next hour and a half deals with the 
forlorn, guilt-heavy existence of skinny, pinch-faced, jug-eared James 
(William Eadie).  Or perhaps she's offering the thought that they're 
interchangeable, these children trapped in an environment from which 
there seems to be no escape.</P>
<P>     But of course they're not interchangeable.  James has little in 
common with the gang of thuggish older boys who pick on him and 
gang-bang the resigned, compliant 14-year-old Margaret Anne (Leanne 
Mullen).  But then James is still pre-adolescent; there's no telling 
what changes a few more years in the projects might bring.</P>
<P>     His parents (Tommy Flanagan and Mandy Matthews) have had a few more 
years in the projects, though they're still young.  Their dream is to 
get out of the projects - into new projects which are being built in a 
wheat field on the edge of town.  James finds his way there on a bus, 
and spends a rapturous afternoon exploring the half-finished apartments 
and imagining, a scene reminiscent of the Joad children at the model 
camp in The Grapes of Wrath.  But eventually, of course, urban sprawl 
will encompass the new buildings and drag them down, and future 
generations will plot and dream to escape them.</P>
<P>     Ramsay has a wonderful eye and ear for her characters, and a gift 
for imagery.  Unfortunately much of the movie is dark, murky, groping 
its hand-held way through impenetrable shadows.  But she sketches her 
story without pathos, and without heavy-handed symbolism.  Water serves 
as a vehicle for casual death.  It's also the setting for a lovely scene 
where James and Margaret Anne take a bath together, as comfortable and 
unerotic as an old married couple.  And it provides a moment of heroism 
for James's Da, who rescues a boy from drowning, gets a medal, and 
probably messes up his family's chances for the new housing project.  
The boy he saves is a simpleminded friend of James's who, amidst the 
swarming vermin of the garbage strike, gets a pet white mouse for his 
birthday, and sends it on a strange trip.</P>
<P>     Ratcatcher is spoken in an urban Scots brogue so thick that the 
filmmakers have wisely subtitled it in English, reminiscent of an early 
Ken Loach film like Kes. </P>
