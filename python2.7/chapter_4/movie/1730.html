<PRE>                                  SNIPER
                       A film review by Greg Bole
                        Copyright 1993 Greg Bole</PRE>
<P>     Saw an advanced screening of the movie SNIPER last night, and I
have to say I wasn't too impressed.</P>
<P>     This film is about an expert marine sniper, played by Tom Berenger,
who is teamed with a hot-shot-young-no-experience-never-killed-a-man new
partner to take out some drug-kingpins and military strong men in
Panama.  Sound cliche?  That's only the beginning.</P>
<P>     Billy Zane (MEMPHIS BELLE) played the rookie, and never seemed to
get a handle on his character.  He was so contrary and pig-headed in
the beginning, you just wanted to smack him.  Then he goes "crazy" from
the pressure, but seems to immediately snap out of it.  I'm not sure if
the blame should lie with the directing, editing, scriptwriting, or
acting ... but it didn't all come together.</P>
<P>     I think Berenger is a pretty good actor, and he looked great in the
part, covered in camo, face painted, stalking through the jungle with
his high-power rifle ... but once again, his character was given some
pretty bad dialogue, and didn't react too logically to many of the
situations.  There was very little logical development in these
characters.</P>
<P>     My biggest problem with this film was it's tendency to put these
two snipers in as *many* inches-from-death situations as possible.  They
began to resemble G. I. Joes, the Greatest American Hero.  And of course
their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to
get them out of far too many close calls.  Now a lot of movies are
stamped out of this mold, in fact that's what made DIE HARD so much
fun: the super-hero avenger type.  So some will enjoy the action hero
heroics, but I didn't think it fit with the nice tension that was built
up in the earlier scenes, and the "real life" feel of covert operations
in Panama.</P>
<P>     A word must be said on the camera work, much of it was very nice.
The jungles of Panama (or their stand-ins in this case) formed a very
picturesque background ... and the drama of speeding bullets was captured
using some nice trick photography.  Many have seen the slowed down
"bullet-cam" following the projectile to its target.  This was used well
in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares Berenger gets when
remembering the moment of the kill.  It was dramatic when used in
flashback...but it seems the director liked the technique so much he
started inserting these shots (pardon the pun) into the real time
action...then it just seemed silly.</P>
<P>     All in all, not a real dog: there is some nice action, good
atmosphere, and pretty photography.  But the plot is pretty lame, the
acting didn't form a cohesive whole, and far too much
thisclosefromdeath heroics.</P>
<PRE>     I'll give Sniper ** stars out of 5.</PRE>
