<P>PLOT:
Interlocking stories of two married couples as they go through some tough
times during their long-term marriages. This film combines a
faux-documentary to its narrative seamlessly, offering us a further glimpse
into the thoughts and feelings of the parties involved.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Thinking of getting married? Think again, and watch this movie with your
loved one. It's sure to get you talking for days. This film isn't only for
those getting married either, the feelings, situations and conclusions
brought up in this film, can be appreciated by anyone who's ever been in a
relationship. They are the questions and thoughts that cross all of our
minds. And despite Woody Allen's blatant cynicism towards the subject (See
Little Known Facts below for all the dirty details), this film does offer
many varying opinions on the subjects of love, fidelity, trust,
companionship, lust, and ultimately, marriage.</P>
<P>The performances in this film are top-notch with Judy Davis and Sydney
Pollack tearing up the screen with reality, and Woody and Mia eerily
wandering through, what probably was, real conversations which they were
having in their own relationship together at that time. Liam Neeson was
another knockout performer, and the writing by Allen was simply inspired. I
could watch this film over and over again, and always laugh or notice
something new that I missed the times before. I also loved the documentary
style of this movie (Some people were really annoyed by the handheld camera,
but not me), but certainly could've done without Juliette Lewis' presence
(Her scenes seemed to go on a little too long, if you ask me, but hey,
Woody's a genius, so what the hell do I know? :)).</P>
<P>All in all, this film is geared towards anyone who's had a loving
relationship and thought about whether or not that person is the right
person with whom they would like to spend the rest of their lives. It's fun
to watch, interesting to hear, and revelatory to discuss.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actress Mia Farrow and Woody Allen lived together for a lot of years, and
had three children, two of whom were adopted. In 1992, Mia found nude
pictures of her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, a College student at the time, in
Woody's things. It was revealed later that Woody and Soon-Yi had been having
an affair together. Mia broke up with the perv, and filed sexual abuse
charges against him and their other kids. The charges were never proven to
be true, and Woody eventually married his "stepdaughter", Soon-Yi Previn, in
1997. NOW watch the movie again, and see if you can pick out the umpteen
references that you could make in regards to "art imitating life, or life
imitating art". Scary, eh?
Emily Lloyd was originally cast as Rain, and had actually filmed some scenes
when she was replaced with Juliette Lewis.
Director/writer Nora Ephron shows up as a "dinner party guest" in this film.
She was also a "wedding guest" in Allen's 1989 pic, CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS.
This film garnered two Oscar nominations in 1993. One for Supporting
Actress, in the way of Judy Davis, and another for Best Original Screenplay
presented to Woody Allen. Neither of them won.
Woody Allen's full name is Allan Stewart Konigsberg. Mia Farrow's full name
is Maria de Lourdes Villiers Farrow. By 1994, she had 13 children, 9 of whom
were adopted. Six came from her previous marriage to Andre Previn, 3 of whom
were adopted, and 3 from her time with Woody Allen, 2 of whom were adopted.
She was also married to ol' blue eyes himself, Frank Sinatra, for about two
years back in the late 1960's.</P>
