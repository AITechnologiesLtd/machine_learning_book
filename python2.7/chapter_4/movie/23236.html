<PRE>THE WHOLE NINE YARDS</PRE>
<P>STARRING:  Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Rosanna Arquette, Michael Clarke
Duncan, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet, Kevin Pollak
DIRECTOR:  Jonathan Lynn
WRITTEN BY:  Mitchell Kapner</P>
<P>As creator of the British TV series "Yes, Minister" and the
writer/director of movie comedies like Clue, Nuns on the Run, and My
Cousin Vinny, Jonathan Lynn isn't lacking in the offbeat humor
department.  With The Whole Nine Yards, he shows a considerably darker
side to his sense of what's funny; this time there are contract killers,
murder plots and double-crosses to go with the pratfalls and silly
accents that characterized earlier Lynn films.  Picture an Elmore
Leonard novel filtered through a Brit-com sensibility, and you get the
idea.  While the film begins unpromisingly, it kicks into an entirely
more satisfying gear in its second half, giving Matthew Perry the
distinction of having the best Friends cast member movie thus far.</P>
<P>Perry stars as Nick "Oz" Oseransky, a dentist who's distinctly unhappy
with his mooching French-Canadian wife (played with a silly accent by
Arquette) and unfulfilled life.  After recognizing his new next-door
neighbor Jimmy Jones (Willis) as notorious hit man Jimmy "The Tulip"
Tudeski, Oz is forced by his wife to go to Chicago in hopes of
collecting a reward for revealing Tudeski's whereabouts to Yanni
Gogolack (Pollak), the crime boss Tudeski sold out for a reduced
sentence.  Naturally, assorted hijinks ensue, including but not limited
to Oz's getting worked over by Gogolack's enforcer Frankie Figs (The
Green Mile's Duncan), sleeping with Tudeski's wife (Henstridge), and
finding out about a particularly large sum of money that everyone wants
to "off" everyone else for.  Oz learns that Tudeski doesn't believe in
divorce (it's a sin), but would happily kill his wife to get at the
money.  As he becomes a pawn in the schemes of everyone around him, Oz
has to figure out a way to keep the people he cares about from getting
whacked-- especially himself.</P>
<P>At first, laughs don't come easily.  Perry seems unsure whether to go
with his sarcastic wiseacre character on Friends or the bumbling,
in-over-his-head naïf Lynn seems to want.  Worse, he looks embarrassed
at having to perform the too-numerous pratfalls that mar the entire
movie.  Pollak, doing an even more silly accent than Arquette's, tries
to make his pronunciation of "vermin" this year's version of Joe Pesci's
"yoots" in Vinny but fails horribly.  By the second half, though, after
a few more characters have been established (particularly Jill, Oz's
dental secretary and contract killer wannabe, played with fervid
enthusiasm by Peet), the humor starts to click.  Willis' friendship with
Duncan is so patently obvious that it shines right through their line
readings, and Perry seems to relax into a much better mix of peevish
tightass and nice-guy hero.  Even the sight gags are funnier.  In the
end, everything works out in a twisted yet moralistic way that Jimmy the
Tulip would appreciate.</P>
