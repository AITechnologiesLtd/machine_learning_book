<P>     Since Brian DePalma first dumped a bucket of blood on Sissy Spacek
almost twenty years ago, filmmakers have been scrambling to adapt
Stephen King.  Thirty-five times they've tried, and thirty-five times
(by my count) they come up with only four words to describe their
results:  "very good" or "very bad."</P>
<P>     No middle ground has ever existed for the bestselling author, who,
in some circles, remains misunderstood because of those "very bad"
ones.  (He even directed one of them.  MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE.  Shudder.)</P>
<P>     DOLORES CLAIBORNE, thank goodness, is one of the "good" Stephen
King films.  The murder mystery--about a feisty New England woman
(Kathy Bates) facing her second accusation of murder--is also a fitting
companion piece to last year's THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  There's even
a script reference to the fictional prison.</P>
<P>     Director Taylor Hackford and writer Tony Gilroy have expanded the
bestseller.  They've both jettisoned the first-person narrative, and
introduced an adult daughter (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who doesn't appear
in the novel.  Purists may scoff, but the changes work.  The result is
a dark feminist fantasy--one that works better as a showcase for the
actors than as a statement of its politics.</P>
<P>     Kathy Bates is no stranger to misery.  She's a delight as the
harried heroine who may have just pushed her employer--that wealthy
invalid witch--right down the stairs.  Dolores is just as colorful as
described in the novel, even if the script omits some of her better
confrontations.</P>
<P>     Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is less fun, spends the entire movie
moping as Dolores' estranged daughter Selena.  The young actress broods
better than any actress her age, though she could stand to lay off the
cigarettes for a film or two.  Who would've thought she'd still have
her lungs after MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE?</P>
<P>     The role of Dolores' late, abusive husband goes to David
Strathairn.  He plays it pretty broad.  More appealing is Christopher
Plummer who hams it up as the local detective.  Watch for bit parts
from Eric Bogosian (!) and Bob Gunton.  The latter starred in
SHAWSHANK.</P>
<P>     Told with a number of flashbacks, the narrative of DOLORES
CLAIBORNE is very easy to follow.  The photography (by Gabriel
Beristain) is great, the direction is smart, and the dialogue is
crisp.  If the ending's too tidy, it's no big deal.  The source
material still shines through.</P>
<P>BOTTOM LINE:  One of the "good" Stephen King films, Mr.  Man!</P>
