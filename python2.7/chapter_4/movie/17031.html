<PRE>THREE SEASONS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Somewhere along the way in THREE SEASONS, writer and director Tony Bui's
cinematic poem, viewers finally realize that the movie isn't about
anything per se.  Without the heavy pretensions and somnolent length of
this year's Oscar nominee THE THIN RED LINE, it shares its lyric beauty
and its gorgeous cinematography.  THE THIN RED LINE is ostensibly about
war, although the flora and fauna seem to get the most screen time, but
THREE SEASONS has much simpler ambitions.  It wants to embrace the
audience with a motion picture tone poem about current day Vietnam.
Watching it is like lying on a white sand beach as gentle waves lap at
your side.</P>
<P>Bui, who lives in Sunnyvale, California and left Vietnam at the age of
2, understands how to craft memorable images of the country he has
visited many times.  His first film, THREE SEASONS, which was an
astonishing triple award winner (Grand Jury, Audience and
Cinematography) at this year's Sundance film festival, is more a movie
for the heart than the mind.  Full of breathtaking imagery and melodious
folk tunes, it casts a magical spell on its audience through the simple
milieu of the people's daily routines.</P>
<P>In the midst of the lush visuals, three small stories grace the screen.
One concerns the relationship between a relatively expensive prostitute
(Zoe Bui) and a driver of a cyclo (a bicycle with a seat), played by Don
Duong in the film's most memorable performance.  Another is about a
flower picker and seller (Ngoc Hiep Nguyen) and her fascination with a
sick, fingerless poet (Manh Cuong Tran).  The third concerns a
mysterious ex-GI (Harvey Keitel), who is there on a visit, and a young
street vendor (Huu Duoc Nguyen), who is selling an old cigarette
lighter.  Although each story is told with great delicacy and finesse.</P>
<P>In the best of the three, there is a particularly sweet scene in which a
group of waiting cyclo drivers reflects on their modest income.  One of
them remarks that they do not earn enough money in a month to pay for
even the cheapest room at the hotel outside of which they wait for their
passengers.  Another one, with a contented smile, says that he wouldn't
want to stay at a 4 or even a 5 star hotel, since he sleeps in a 1,000
star place every night -- without a roof, he has the glorious, starry
sky above to lull him to sleep.</P>
<P>Lisa Rinzler's radiant cinematography and the beautiful sets are likely
to provide viewers' most vivid memories of THREE SEASONS.  The film
opens strikingly with dark, thin boats cutting through waters filled
with lily pads and lotus blossoms.  The women who sing melodious folk
songs ("Can anyone tell how many stalks are in a rice field?  How many
bends are in a river?  How many layers in a cloud?") are there to pick
the flowers that they will sell on the city streets.  Another remarkable
image occurs later as one of these boats cuts through the dark fog with
only a small lamp to guide it.  The light casts a golden glow on the
placid waters, creating a scene that Monet would have loved to capture
on canvas.</P>
<P>The director, who is a master at staging, pays careful attention to the
small details.  Listen and watch the old electric fan as it slices
through the heavy moist air of one of Vietnam's stifling heat waves.
And listen to the soothing rain falling during the torrential downpours.</P>
<P>THREE SEASONS floats like a lotus blossom on still waters and is an
exquisite treat for those willing to venture just a little outside of
the traditional motion picture format.</P>
<P>THREE SEASONS runs 1:53.  The film's sparse dialog is in Vietnamese with
English subtitles.  It is rated PG-13 for brief sexuality and mature
themes and would be fine for kids around 12 and up.</P>
