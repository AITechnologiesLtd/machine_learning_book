Review: "The Faculty" (1998)
A Postview, copyright p-m agapow 1999</PRE>
<P>A group of misfit high school students grow suspicious of their teachers.
Have they been replaced by sinister alien doubles?  What are their plans
for Earth?  Have aliens infiltrated the rebels?  Is this just a crap SF
film?</P>
<P>Kevin Williamson is chiefly (in fact only) for his self referential and
ironic horror films "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer".
Neither were exactly post-modern classics.  A bad horror film where the
characters know that they are in a bad horror film is - in-jokes, knowing
winks to the audience, homage to genre aside - still a bad horror film.
His screenplay for "The Faculty" does nothing to change this track record.</P>
<P>Although endless comparisons have been made to the cult SF flick "Invasion
of the Body Snatchers", "The Faculty" bears a greater resemblance to a more
recent film, John Carpenter's "The Thing".  (Actually two scenes are stolen
outright: a walking autonomous head, and a "loyalty test" to ascertain who
can be trusted.)  The strange behaviour of their teachers leads a diverse
group of students to conclude their school has been taken over.  But their
own ranks have been infiltrated and as their numbers drop, suspicion
blossoms within the group.  In the hands of Carpenter, this created a
claustrophobic atmosphere, with a team that needed to trust each other
being unable to.  "The Faculty" is by contrast a sloppily constructed film.
Starting with a group of uniquely unlikable characters (the bitchy
cheerleader, the drug dealer, the professional victim nerd, the dumb jock),
they are brought together implausibly and just as implausibly start to
fight.  The only reason for the timing of their squabble seems to be that
this was around when it happens in other films of this type.  It may be
interesting to see who gets taken over next, but the director doesn't play
fair here.  Several party members turn when there has been no opportunity
for them to have been converted.  In a flashback late in the film we are
reshown a previous scene, including something that clearly didn't happen in
it.  Rather than redirect our attention or be clever with our sympathies
the film just lies to get out of plot cul-de-sacs.</P>
<P>The acting is passable, with creditable performances by Famke Janssen, Bebe
Neuwirth and Piper Laurie in small roles.  . Salma Hayek however shows
herself to be a talent-free zone by failing to carry a three-minute
appearance as a school nurse.  Clea DuVall does a nice turn as as a gloomy
outsider, shining against the rest of the glossy teenage leads.  I'd like
to say something positive about director Robert Rodriguez, who looked so
promising when he made the shoestring budget "El Mariachi".  However any
number of dull Hollywood hacks could have made "The Faculty", with its
off-the-shelf direction.  Regrettably, another talent bites the dust.</P>
<P>So the central characters are the geek, the jock, the prom queen ...  no,
hang about, that was "The Breakfast Club".  One thing about Kevin
Williamson scripts is that they're like so many other films you've seen
before.  Like one of those composite photos made by averaging hundreds of
faces, there's something elusively familiar about it all.  (Or, to pick a
genre example, the shimmer suits from Philip K Dick's "A Scanner Darkly".)
In fact, this cut-and-paste passes as narrative.  When considering how to
defeat the aliens, the characters decide apropos no evidence whatsoever
that it must be the same way as in Heinlein's "The Puppet Masters".  Of
course they turn out to be right.  When the heroes do so little to deserve
victory, can you really be interested in the outcome?</P>
<P>In his book of essays "A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again", Mark
Foster Wallace ponders why there is so much bad television and why people
still watch so much.  The reason, he decides, is that television is
fundamentally ironic.  On one hand it parades its importance ("don't miss",
"don't go away", "hear it first") while on the other hand giving a sly
wink.  You and I know, it says, this is all a joke.  What's the harm?  So
programs can simultaneously portray themselves as vital and garbage, as
original and derivative, as unmissable and disposable.  Wallace may not
have Williamson's number, but he is in the right area code.  "The Faculty"
tries to be tense by being predictable, to tell a scary story by copying
other scary stories, to cover up plot holes by hiding in genre.  It's not a
poorly made film - it's just not even trying to be a good film.</P>
<P>And this isn't going to do.  How long has it been since the last really
scary film you saw.  (For me it was the launch sequence in "Contact".)  Why
has SF, in fact big box office film, become action-comedy SFX by default?
Does anyone make serious and sincere films anymore?  It's very easy to
produce ironic, self-referential work, escaping any responsibility for
being derivative or illogical with a plea that it's a parody.  It's a lot
harder to actually produce something new and be prepared to face criticism
head-on.</P>
<P>"The Faculty" isn't a terrible film, but it's a terribly lazy one and a bad
sign for the future.  [*/misfire] and "Death to the archdemon
 Williamson!" on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
