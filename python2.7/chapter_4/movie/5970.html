<PRE>                                  BLIND DATE
                       A film review by Peter Schouten
                        Copyright 1996 Peter Schouten</PRE>
<PRE>Netherlands 1996
Directed by Theo van Gogh
>From an idea by Theo van Gogh, dialogues by Kim van Kooten
With: Peer Mascini, , Roeland Fernhout
Produced: BERGEN/THEO VAN GOGH</PRE>
<P>Director Theo van Gogh is a character by himself. He presents a strange
talkshow on a local tv-network in Amsterdam en makes movies only he wants
to put money in. Although his last movie, 06, was distributed overseas,
in the Netherlands the public and critics alike had a field trip with it.
The movie was thrashed and ridiculed, and not without reason. In 06 Van Gogh
had his actors think up their own scenes, based on one idea: two individuals
have a phone sex relation.</P>
<P>This time around he has learned, but not much. Again he had only one idea:
two divorced individuals arrange blind dates, pretend they don't know each
other and try to get in touch with their feelings, since their daughter died
in a car crash they survived.</P>
<P>Instead of improvising everything there was actually a screenplay this time,
but the dialogues were written by a child actress with one movie to her credit.
Over and over we see the same 'blind' date. Character backgrounds are clear
within 5 minutes, and half-way through you'll know the ending.</P>
<P>The best part in the movie is the voice of the dead child. She has wonderful
lines, but as a whole, this could have been a nice 25 minute short, instead
of a feature length movie. On the positive side, the movie doesn't drag, for
there are many comic elements to lighten the drama.</P>
<P>After "Vals Licht" and "06", Van Goghs movies are definitely improving. Maybe,
just maybe, he'll make a good movie someday.</P>
