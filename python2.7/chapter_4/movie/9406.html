<P>When Mario Puzo first wrote The Godfather it was a piece of pop culture -
treated well because of his reputation as a good writer, but unmistakably
mediocre -  a tale of family life in the mafia from the inside. The
characters were one-dimensional, the story gripping but silly. However it
was a best-seller and several major studios grappled for the rights.
Paramount won out and the film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who
turned it into more then what it had been. It became a tale of family and
honor, loyalty and trust, death and fortune, innocent men and ruthless men,
passing rulers and heirs. The film was a huge hit. It was also one of the
greatest films of all time - the only adult blockbuster ever made. It one
three academy awards including best picture, and executives decided that
the story was deserving of a continuation. Coppola was brought back on, and
in an utterly astonishing act, lived up to the high standards. The sequel
was an astonishing act of virtuoso filmmaking that never spared your
feelings. It showed us a man and his gradual descension into evil. The
violence was always needed,
never gratuitous. Complete control was spread throughout in a study of
power, a tale of a family and of Michael Corleone - once a young man who
wanted nothing to do with the family buisness and now a greedy ruler who
ruins both his life and those of the people around him. It is truly epic -
the magnificent clean strokes that paint out a tale of life in the mafia.
By the end Michael has been abandoned by all except those who work for and
fear him. His empire expands and he becomes a powerful man but not a good
one. Every minute is utterly engrossing and completely amazing. Rarely has
a film been so punishing to watch. </P>
<P>Something happens other then that, something amazing. We are shown the
early life of Don Vito Corleone and it is every bit as good. The sky is
ablaze with a red that springs from some unseen source. The violence here
is shocking and upsetting but completely indespensable. This is the
 rising and near falling of a band of unofficial rulers; but to us,
especially if we have seen the prequel,
 it means so much more. And, when at the end, we see Michael alone in his
garden our heart breaks. He has killed his brother and alienated himself
from all those who - did - love him. He has locked out his wife and he has
no regret. He is a lonely man but not a sad one. Breathtaking. </P>
<P>Both stories come together perfectly and affect us equally. Coupled with
Nina Rota's mournful score we are told a story of one man's self
destruction. To me the first film is a better one. But they are both
examples of near cinematic perfection, and they are both hard hitting tales
that live in your mind.</P>
