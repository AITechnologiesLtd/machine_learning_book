<P>   Since fifty percent of marriages end up in divorce, we can
no longer assume that the institution is a guaranteed lifetime
contract. Still, matrimony is taken with some seriousness,
enough to give people of both sexes the jitters as the big day
approaches.  A short time ago some guy left for Tahiti on his
wedding day, a detail which received vast publicity by the
media.  Apparently he checked into his little dot on he map
without his bride and without bothering to take his vows. 
When the crunch comes, feet can get awfully cold.</P>
<P>   In "The Wedding Singer" director Frank Coraci aims to mine
both the comedy and the pathos of such a situation in Judd
Apatow, Carrie Fisher and Tim Herlihy's screenplay.  He
succeeds to a degree, unfolding a story of a guy who is a
male variation of the adage "Always a bridesmaid, never a
bride."  Robby Hart (Adam Sandler) sings at other people's
weddings but cries at his own: his childhood sweetheart,
Linda (Angela Featherstone), simply did not show up, did not
tell any of the guests of her belated decision, but days later
volunteered the information that she was just not the same
person she was when she was a kid.  She no longer wanted
to hitch up with poor Robby.</P>
<P>   This movie is a vehicle for Adam Sandler, a veteran of
"Saturday Night Live, and the cheerful golfer in the
sporadically funny "Happy Gilmore."  Targeting his shtick to
an audience of twenty-somethings, Sandler knows how to turn
on the emotions, turning his plight into material that draws
laughter from his audience as he proceeds from sheer
exuberance while performing on stage to utter depression
when he is rebuffed so humiliatingly at his own wedding. 
Fortunately he runs into the lovely, sweet, and virtuous Julia
(Drew Barrymore), who is waiting tables for the caterer at one
of his gigs, and as the two meet informally from time to time,
their friendship grows and so does their mutual, physical
attraction.</P>
<P>   Director Coraci has done a fine job re-creating and spoofing
some of the cultural trends of the 1980s, a time in which
yuppie-worship replaced hippie-adulation. The decade's motifs
do not bode well for Robby since the gals tend to seek guys
who can offer them the security of the picket fence, the De
Lorean car, and the array of gold cards.  Scraping up money
whenever he can land a job at non-union rates for Bar
Mitzvahs and weddings, Robby is forced to live in the
basement of his grandmother's home and, after his rejection
by his long-term lover, is reduced to both poverty and
emotional misery.  What's more, he thinks he has little chance
to match up with Julia, who has for several years been the girl
friend of Glenn (Matthew Glave) the rich and handsome bond-
trader who has finally agreed to setting the date.</P>
<P>   In a predictable story laced with the shopworn spoofs of
eras inferior to our own (pastel wedding gowns, chintzy-
looking women with teased hair, octogenarians who still have
an eye for the provocative wiggle and who say things you'd
expect from the mouth of nineteen-year-olds), "The Wedding
Singer" depends on the chemistry between Robby and Julia. 
The growing excitement they feel for each other is there, all
right, but Adam Sandler is not exceptionally appealing as a
whining anti-hero, a role best left to Woody Allen.  Too often,
the dialogue calls for stereotyping the elderly.  In one quick
scene, grandma Rosie (Ellen Albertini Dow) delivers a rap
song in front of a microphone after previous confessing to her
grandson that she had "intercourse with eight men before her
marriage" and an old man in a bar (Carmen Filpi) announces
to Robbie apropos of nothing, "You need a prostitute." 
Christine Taylor fares better as Holly, a sexually liberated
woman who knows what she wants and uses no euphemisms
to proclaim it, and Matthew Glave excels as the wealthy
fiance who makes the mistake of describing his adulterous
intentions with Robbie.</P>
<P>   "The Wedding Singer" is a sentimental, romantic comedy
that affirms what we all know, deep down--that friendship
should precede love.  The motif is furthered by a Drew
Barrymore's charming performance as a sweet young thing
but marred by Sandler's lack of appeal and stereotyped
characters like George (Alexis Arquette), a musician who
comes across as a transvestite, and Rosie, whose adolescent
dialogue is more embarrassing than cute.  Rated R.  Running
time: 95 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
