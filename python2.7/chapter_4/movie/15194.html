<P>For most people, adolescence is a lonely, often humiliating time and,
writer-director Tamara Jenkins argues in the perceptive "Slums of Beverly
Hills," it's a lot lonelier and more humiliating if you have the misfortune
to be the only female in a family that's more worried about staying a step
ahead of creditors than it is concerned making about your adjustment to
womanhood easier.
 Such is the plight of 14-year-old Vivian Abramovitz (Natasha Lyonne, who
played Woody Allen's scheming daughter in "Everyone Says I Love You") in
1976 Los Angeles. She thinks her recently developed breasts are a curse,
since they make her the butt of coarse jokes. Even worse, her father Murray
(Alan Arkin) doesn't see anything wrong with dragging Vivian and her
brothers Ben (David Krumholtz) and Rickey (Eli Marienthal) all over the city
in a series of impromptu moves, most of which happen shortly before the rent
is due on whatever "dingbat" apartment they're in.
 Vivian complains but her words fail to sway Murray. So the Abramovitzs
drift from one semi-seedy home to another, finally landing on the very brink
of Beverly Hills because Murray wants to take advantage of the good school
system. "Is this it?" Vivian asks as the quartet settles in at their
so-called "luxury" digs at the Camelot, decorated in ghastly shades of
harvest gold. "Are we bourgeoise yet?"
 Reminiscent of Patty Dann's charming novel "Mermaids" and the delightful
1990 film based on it, Jenkins' semi-autobiographical screenplay is a
haunting reminder of what it feels like to be the kind of unfortunate teen
who gets caught almost everytime she tries something a little adventurous.
When he sees his daughter all but spilling out of a halter, Murray insists
Vivian wear an over-the-shoulder bra underneath the top. And luckless Vivian
is later discovered by her dad dancing (which is bad enough) while clutching
a certain item (which makes it much, much worse).
 Although she's the center of attention in almost every scene, Lyonne proves
she's more than up to the challenge of carrying "Slums." She never overplays
Vivian's gawkiness nor her petulance, finding a charming middle ground.
Though it's a sad fact of Hollywood life that "unusual-looking" young women
like Lyonne rarely go on to major stardom, here's hoping this offbeat beauty
can beat the odds; she's genuinely funny and easy to identify with.
 Arkin, who too often underplays to the point of becoming wallpaper, offers
a surprisingly fine interpretation of Murray's silent desperation. Once a
successful restaurant owner, this sixtysomething man is now reduced to
flirting with a widowed sugar mama (Jessica Walter) to scrounge up some
extra cash.
 When cousin Rita (a delightfully zonked Marisa Tomei, in her first good
role in ages) shows up at their doorstep after escaping from a detox clinic,
"Slums" truly shifts into high gear, as the Abromovitzs go to great lengths
to try to keep Rita clean and sober, the better to use her to squeeze a
generous allowance out of rich Uncle Mickey (Carl Reiner) and Aunt Belle
(Rita Moreno). Meanwhile, Vivian has her hands full trying to resolve her
relationship with Eliot (Kevin Corrigan), a pot-dealing Charles Manson
admirer who nevertheless wins her heart.
 Not all of "Slums" works: Jenkins overplays her hand with an ill-advised
scene between Murray and Rita, and some of the scenes depicting Vivian's
sexual awakening would seem crass were it not for Lyonne's presence. But
it's rare to find a comedy with so many memorably etched characters and
rarer still to come across a movie set in the 1970s that doesn't continually
beat you over the head with goofy period relics. By the end of "Slums,"
you'll want to know more about the Abromovitzs, and any film that makes you
actually hope for a sequel must be pretty good.
