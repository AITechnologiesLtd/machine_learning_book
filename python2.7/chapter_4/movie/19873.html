<P>As South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut opens, the citizens of the
famous mountainside town are celebrating life's good fortune. The birds
are chirping, the sun is shining, and the friendly inhabitants are
smiling gleefully as they skip down the street to an upbeat tune. Enter
the foursome of Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny, the infamous group of
elementary school children that the TV show is based upon. They see an
ad bearing the names of their favorite fart-lighting duo of Terrance and
Phillip, who are appearing in their very first feature length movie (a
Canadian production). And so they venture forth to the local cineplex,
where they are shamefully turned down from seeing this graphic, R-rated
feature. After bribing a homeless man to accompany them as their
`parental guardian', the boys make it in to watch the movie, unaware
that the profane language they learn will soon thereafter destroy their
quiet and peaceful town.</P>
<P>South Park is a TV show that grew immensely popular on Comedy Central.
Mostly, of course, with the less demanding younger viewers, who found
the idea of swearing and offensive cardboard children to be just their
cup of tea. Now that co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are free of
their television rating confines, they have pushed the envelope as far
as it can possibly go. The South Park movie is more raunchy, vulgar and
repeatedly crude than anything you have probably ever seen. The
obscenities flow so consistently that unwilling viewers may be scarred
for life, left to babble on in profane gibberish. The reason the film
exists is that Parker and Stone can take revenge on the MPAA (that's the
Motion Picture Association of America), with whom they've experienced a
complicated past. But, they won't stop there.</P>
<P>How many groups, minorities and individuals does the South Park movie
stab in the back? With the exception of the MPAA, there is (*ahem*)
black people, Jewish people, gay people, Anne Murray, Celine Dion, Jar
Jar Binks, the Baldwin brothers, Saddam Hussein, Brian Boitano, Bill
Gates, Barbara Streisand, and most blatantly of all: Canada! Parker and
Stone have cross-referenced all the inventive ways to make fun of we
Canadians, from speech patterns to flag-wearing and beyond. It would be
advisable for anyone who is easily offended to avoid this film, at ALL
costs.</P>
<P>But back to the plot. After the South Park children begin to utter
shocking four-letter words as part of their regular vocabulary, the
mothers take action. Forming MAC (Mothers Against Canada), they take
their case to President Clinton, forcing him to proclaim war on the
neighboring country for polluting the American children's minds with
their obscene movie productions. Terrance and Phillip are thereby
scheduled to be executed, with a pre-celebrity bash including Winona
Ryder and Big Gay Al. The South Park children decide to band together,
stop the bloodbath, and save the lives of their acting icons before all
is lost.</P>
<P>Let me first say that I laughed. Lord help me, I nearly busted a gut
during some uproarious musical numbers. Yes, in case you didn't know
already, the South Park movie is basically a feature-length animated
musical. The lyrics are often side-splitting and many of the songs have
an enjoyable beat, especially the re-enactment of the widely cherished
`Kyle's Mom's a B--ch', performed with eager enthusiasm by Cartman
himself. As a sub-plot, Kenny sets himself on fire while attempting to
light his own fart, and descends to hell. There he meets Satan, who is
having a heated affair with none other than Saddam Hussein. For such
(intentionally) crummy animation, there are some impressive
computer-generated visuals down below. Unfortunately, this and many
other offensive scenarios are almost too eager to cross the line into
disgusting vulgarity. South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut nearly
received an NC-17 from the MPAA, and for good reason; this film is not
for young audiences.</P>
<P>While a half-hour episode is nicely filling, the 90-minute movie begins
to lose fuel as it nears the conclusion. But some sequences are so
hilarious, and some pop culture references so cleverly placed, you just
have to appreciate the effort. South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut
breaks every rule in the book, and if you have the courage, you just
might find it entertaining.</P>
