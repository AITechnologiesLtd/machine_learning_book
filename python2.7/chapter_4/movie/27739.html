<PRE>"Monkeybone"</PRE>
<P>Stu Miley (Brendan Fraser) is on top of the world. He's madly in love with
beautiful Dr. Julia McElroy (Bridget Fonda) and has a hit animated TV show
based on his main character, a mischievous monkey named Monkeybone. A freak
accident puts Stu into a deep coma where his nightmare world comes alive
and he must fight his way back to the land of the living in "Monkeybone."</P>
<P>The film opens with a short animation, Monkeybone, conceived and created by
the reclusive Stu. He hates the attention, especially the merchandise
marketing, that the fame his creation has spawned. An unfortunate car
accident involving a giant, inflatable Monkeybone doll knocks Stu
unconscious with little chance for revival. While his doctor girlfriend,
Julie (Bridget Fonda), fights to bring him back before his selfish sister,
Kimmy (Megan Mullalley), can pull the plug, the animator finds himself cast
into the land of his nightmares. To his surprise, Stu learns that the bad
dreams that have plagued him his whole life are a big hit in Downtown, the
purgatory-like limbo between life and death. His celebrity status has come
to the attention of Hypnos (Giancarlo Esposito), the god of sleep, and poor
Stu soon learns that he can never leave his underworld prison.</P>
<P>Adding insult to injury, his creation, Monkeybone, comes to life in the
nightmare world and the malicious monkey escapes to take over Stu's body on
earth and garner all the perks of the cartoonist's fame - including Julie.
It becomes a battle of wills as Stu fights to escape the nightmare world
and get his body back from the willful, troublemaking Monkeybone.</P>
<P>This is the kind of movie that must have looked good on paper - the popular
Brendan Fraser starring in a Tim Burtonesque film about the land of
nightmares and all the creatures that reside there. Admittedly, the art
direction and imagination that went into the creation of Downtown and its
bizarre inhabitants is second to none, and is reminiscent, at times, of
Burton's "Beetlejuice." The effort is laudable in its visual achievements
in creating the frightening demons of Stu's dreams. But, this creative
artwork does not have a story to hold it together. There is no real tale,
at least not one I care about, to involve the earthbound characters. It's
visual eye candy in the nether world and not much more.</P>
<P>Helmer Henry Sellick has ample experience with the creating a fantasy wolds
as is very evident in "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "James and the
Giant Peach." The demon world of the land of nightmares in "Monkeybone" is
further proof that he and his team of filmmakers know how to create a dark
fantasyland. The same cannot be said for his direction of the live actors
in their world. This is where "Monkeybone" falls flat, leaving the actors
to mouth their lines while the possessed Stu revels in the havoc he causes
amongst the living.</P>
<P>Brendan Fraser has been used to better effect, especially in his last film,
"Bedazzled," where he got to do a multitude of characters and some good
comedy. In "Monkeybone," he, like the rest of the "human" cast, is left out
in the cold, playing second banana to the terrific F/X, stop motion camera
work and computer-generated animation. The rest of the cast, a pretty good
collection of comedic actors, is wasted in their various character roles.</P>
<P>Bridget Fonda has the unenviable task of being the loyal girlfriend, Julie,
and has little to do but look pensive or startled. Whoopi Goldberg, a
veteran of this kind of comedy, doesn't do anything with the great
potential of her character, Death. Giancarlo Esposito does his best to give
some evil mirth to his half-man, half-goat, Hypnos, but, falls to the power
of F/X. Chris Kattan gets some mileage as the dead gymnast/organ donor that
Stu possesses when he returns to earth to get his own body back. Plan on
watching a stomach or a kidney fall out of Stu's temporary bod, only to be
snatched up by a greedy gang of organ harvesting doctors. Rose McGowan is
cute as the aptly named Kitty, while a blond, goateed Dave Foley could have
phoned in his slimy agent character, Herb.</P>
<P>Special F/X, alone, do not make a movie. There has to be a good story to
hang terrific techs on and that does not happen with "Monkeybone." I give
it a disappointed C+.</P>
