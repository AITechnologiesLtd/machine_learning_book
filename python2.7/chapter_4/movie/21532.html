<PRE>The Insider: 160 minutes</PRE>
<P>The first question to ask of a two and a half-plus hour movie is could it
have been shorter and still achieved the same effect? With a Heat, yes; with
The Insider, no. The next question then is was that effect worth two and a
half-plus hours, which is a little trickier to answer, as you have to first
establish what the movie was trying to do. The Insider pretends to make that
part easy for us, though: just as the TV magazine newshow 60 Minutes
exposes, say, the tobacco industry, so does director Michael Mann's The
Insider pull the curtain back on 60 minutes. Which is to say if your
infortainment fetish didn't get satiated during prime time, check out the
local theatre. It's all on the big screen now, dramatized. With big name
actors: Al Pacino as a convincing Lowell Bergman, 60 Minutes
segment-producer; Christopher Plummer as an austere, unredoubtable Mike
Wallace; Russell Crowe as "insider" Jeffrey Wigand, constantly breathing in
big just to blow the whistle on the tobacco industry.</P>
<P>Too, though, The Insider's something of a fairy tale--the ultimate insider
pairing up with the ultimate investigative journalist to fight tobacco, the
ultimate big industry heavy. Rain Maker-Civil Action type stuff, just
without the Grisham underdog element. 60 Minutes is 60 Minutes, after all.
Their calls get returned. As for Bergman and Wigand, too, they're
practically the same character: one clings to journalistic ethics in the
face of everything, and the other is a steadfast scientific method man. And
both want to right all the wrongs so obviously going on, no matter the havoc
it wreaks on their personal lives. The first part of being a hero, after
all, is cutting all your ties or having them cut for you. Watch all the
Deathwishes for more like this.</P>
<P>Of course there are various obstacles in Wigand and Bergman's way, though,
which gives us the dramatic structure of The Insider: first Wigand goes to
bat for Bergman, then Bergman goes to bat for Wigand. The problem with all
this, though, is that the in-house resistance Bergman has to eventually
hurdle (CBS translated as 'Corporate BS,' as personified in Gina Gershon) is
much more believable than the resistance Wigand has to deal with. Not that
we don't all already 'know' that big tobacco wouldn't hesitate to threaten
the life of a whistle blower. That can be assumed. It's the threats
themselves which don't ring true, or, feel suspiciously as if they've been
edited for TV, so to speak. Which is to say the names have been left
intentionally vague in order to avoid any potential legal ramifications.
Which is to say that The Insider feels as if it's falling prey to the same
pressures that--in the movie--are trying to keep Wigand off-camera.</P>
<P>Yes, though, one objection to that would be that the parties intimidating
Wigand and family were never formally revealed, indicted, whatever, meaning
The Insider, like 60 Minutes, is being true to the facts. Which is fine,
except that The Insider claims to be a 'dramatization.' And dramatizations
are pretty much licensed to do whatever's necessary to make the facts
narratively compelling. And there are times in The Insider when things
simply aren't that compelling, when bladder issues become more important
than what's going on on-screen. But so be it. Russell Crowe is excellent; Al
Pacino is doing a lighter version of his Glengarry Glen Ross role. And
nevermind that the big 'secret' the trailer uses to draw us into the theater
is anticlimactic enough that Mann had to spill it early rather than string
us along (which is some good foresight on his part). Is The Insider worth
the two and half-plus hours it takes to get through it without a pause
button, though? Yes, but only for that one "How about Mr. Wallace?" line,
which we've already heard.</P>
