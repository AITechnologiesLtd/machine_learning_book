"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>The legend of Max Schreck is ... well, legendary.  The unknown actor
virtually came from nowhere to land the role of the vampire in the
classic 1922 film Nosferatu.  According to myth, Schreck wasn't just
pretending to be a bloodsucker – he actually was one of the undead.  The
new film Shadow of the Vampire brings the legend of Schreck to the big
screen over 70 years after the creepy actor put his unique stamp on what
many consider to be the greatest portrayal of a vampire ever.</P>
<P>But how successful can a film be with no A-list stars, a mediocre
actor-turned-producer (Nicolas Cage), a no-name director, a first-time
screenwriter, a miniscule running time (most of which seem to be burned
during the opening credits) and the presence of Udo Kier?  The answer is
`moderately."  Vampire is a sloppy mess of a film, really corny, and a
lot of fun to watch.  It also boasts what should be a lock for a Best
Supporting Actor nomination at next year's Academy Awards in Willem
Dafoe, who plays the spindly Schreck to eerie perfection.  Kudos should
also be given to the people responsible for transforming Dafoe into
Schreck.</P>
<P>John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) plays Nosferatu director F.W.
Murnau, who wanted to make a film based on Bram Stoker's `Dracula,' but
Stoker's wife Florence refused to give him permission.  Murnau created
his own vampire character in Nosferatu, swapping Count Dracula for Count
Orlock.  His film, which was silent, followed a simple story involving a
German real estate agent (played here by Eddie Izzard, Velvet Goldmine)
and his fiancée (Catherine McCormack, Dangerous Beauty) who meet up with
a potential client in Orlock (Dafoe, American Psycho).</P>
<P>In Vampire, Schreck is presented to the cast and crew of Nosferatu as
one of the craft's first method actors.  Murnau explains that Schreck
will only appear in full costume and makeup, and, because of his kooky
requirements, insists they only shoot at night.  You don't see
Shreck/Orlock until nearly 30 minutes into the film, which, given the
running time here, is a significant portion of the movie.  But when he
finally emerges from the shadows, it's quite startling.  Where most
screen portrayals of vampires have opted for creating a brooding
lady-killer character, Vampire instead shows Schreck/Orlock as a bald,
overgrown rat with impossibly long fingernails and gimpy little arms
that hang above his chest like a bat.</P>
<P>Vampire mainly shows the trouble Murnau had keeping the bloodthirsty
Schreck in line during the filming of Nosferatu.  When the
cinematographer dies of a mysterious ailment (and two tiny puncture
wounds in his neck), Murnau is forced to depart the set to find another
cameraman, which leaves Schreck unsupervised with the rest of the film
crew.  In order to keep Schreck from wreaking total havoc on the set,
Murnau promises to `give' the morphine-addicted female lead to Schreck
once the filming is completed, provided he behaves himself.  The finale
is as madcap as you would expect from a success-hungry director, a
hophead and a vampire pretending to be an actor pretending to be a
vampire.</P>
<P>While most of the Vampire seems haphazardly slapped onto film, it does
do a great job recreating the look and feel of a silent film with the
use of title cards and the shift from black-and-white to color stock.
The story, which was written by debut screenwriter Steven Katz (he
penned part one of HBO's From the Earth to the Moon), is unnecessarily
messy for a film this length.  Vampire was directed by E. Elias Merhige,
whose only previous film credit was the 1991 horror flick, Begotten.  An
interesting note – Max Schreck is the name of the villain in Batman
Returns (played by Christopher Walken).</P>
<P>1:31 – R for adult language, nudity, violence</P>
