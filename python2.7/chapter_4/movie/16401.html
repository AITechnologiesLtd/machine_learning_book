<P>   In a recent op ed column, New York Times columnist Abe
Rosenthal writes of "The Last Days" that "we do not go see
the picture to see 'new' things.  Go to see again what you
know--the living skeletons with nothing but skin and bones on
their buttocks and thighs, the dead skeletons filling scores of
boxcars because the Nazis wanted them dead before U.S.
troops give them life."  The most vivid images shown by this
Holocaust film, which is executive produced by Steven
Spielberg and sponsored by the Shoah Foundation is that of
scores of victims of the camps just after their liberation.  They
are indeed as close as you'll get to the walking dead, ribs
protruding on bodies that are virtually devoid of skin.  There
is nothing that this current release shows that has not been
exhibited before in the vast array of such documentaries, but
as the philosopher Santayana once said, "Those who forget
the past are condemned to repeat it."  If so, "The Last Days"
serves as yet another reminder of the most vicious and
senseless crime ever perpetuated by human beings against
others.  Ultimately the Shoah Visual History Foundation will
have at its disposal video clips of 50,000 interviews with
survivors in 57 countries in 31 languages, doubtless the most
recorded sequence of taped historical data of any of history's
great tragedies.  This is documentation that makes an
absolute mockery of the claims of a relative handful of
wackos who have the unmitigated malignity to claim that the
Holocaust never took place.  </P>
<P>   Directed and edited by James Moll with Harris Done behind
the camera, the picture profiles five survivors living in
America who have a common Hungarian background.  They
have lived in this country for decades.  All are fluent in
English, are articulate (no uhs, ahs, ya knows), and expound
on their memories eloquently with only an occasional pause
by one of their number for tears. Director Moll follows the
standard pattern of documentaries of this nature, varying the
talking heads with both still clips from the past and, in this
case, the use of archived films taken at the time--some in full
color.  </P>
<P>   The  best-spoken of the interviewees is 9-term California
Congressman Tom Lantos, whose district covers parts of San
Francisco.  Toward the end of the film we are shown the one
gratifying scene of the story, the 17 grandsons and
granddaughters that have brought so much inspiration and
joy to the legislator, the ultimate vindication of the will of the
Jewish people to survive as they have done for millennia
despite the pogroms of their demented enemies.  </P>
<P>   Congressman Lantos, a seventy-year-old, Budapest-born
legislator, came from a family of intellectuals including an
uncle who was a professor at the Budapest University who,
like most of his fellows, considered himself a patriotic
Hungarian.   Lantos describes the growing fear among the
Jews of his country after Hitler had annexed Austria, and
although the Germans were right on the Hungarian border, he
felt that nothing would happen since the Jewish community
would be protected by their own countrymen.  How wrong he
was.  As director Moll shows clips of the Arrow Cross, a pro-
Nazi group of Hungarians, we see how it was possible for a
typical village in Hungary to be "occupied" by only two
German soldiers as so many Hungarian people themselves
supported the Nazi movement fiercely.  </P>
<P>   With expert editing by the director, "The Last Days" cross-
cuts among interviews with the four other principals with
cameo appearances by an African-American doctor who
helped liberate one of the camps (and who killed a German
officer who had spit in his face); and a remarkable
conference with a Dr. Munch, one of the German physicians
who experimented on the Jewish prisoners, but who was
acquitted of any crime because (as he puts it) he delayed the
execution of many inmates by performing harmless medical
experiments on them.  (We draw our own conclusions about
whether he is indeed another Oskar Schindler since, after all,
how innocent could a German doctor be if he chose to
participate in this evil research?)</P>
<P>   Some of the more dramatic testimony of the lucid survivors 
interviewed for the film includes a story of three teens who
had taken an oath that they would die for one another but,
when a guard insisted on killing one of them who was walking
with a limp, the two buddies who had stood in front to protect
their friend moved away.  Renee Firestone, now a white-
haired, calm woman who occasionally breaks into tears,
describes how she hunched over to hide from her father,
wanting to conceal her shaved head and ragged clothes.  As
her father marched to the ovens, however, their eyes locked
for the last time.</P>
<P>   The giant of Holocaust documentaries remains Claude
Lanzmann's mammoth 1985 work. "Shoah," a nine-year labor
chronicling the memories of those who lived through the
Holocaust.  Lanzmann was able to trick the ex-Nazis he
interviewed into admitting vile deeds under the pretense that
he was thoroughly neutral. "The Last Days" is a solid effort
but by contrast a relatively sober film, one which fills a niche
by focusing exclusively on what the Nazis did to the Jews of
Hungary.  </P>
