<P>Copyright 1998 Nathaniel R. Atcheson</P>
<P>Roberto Benigni won big this year at the Oscars, snagging up both Best
Foreign Film and Best Actor for Life is Beautiful.  The film is actually
two pictures in one:  the first is about Guido Orefice (Benigni), and
his efforts to woo a young woman (played by Benigni's real-life wife,
Nicoletta Braschi).  This portion of the film is wonderfully funny and
unrelenting slapstick comedy.  But the slapstick tone is not even
marginally appropriate for a Holocaust setting, and so any attempt at
humor ends up failing (except for one superb moment in which Guido
intentionally screws up in translating orders from a German soldier). 
Overall, Life is Beautiful is an ambitious and heartfelt artistic
failure.</P>
<PRE>Psychosis Rating:  6/10</PRE>
