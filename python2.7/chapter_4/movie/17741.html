<P>If there was ever a film that lived up to its title, then Go is that
film.  For one hour and forty minutes, the audience is subjected to a
story that never stops, a movie that never even comes close to slowing
down.  It's not that the film is relentless or action-packed; it's just
a perpetual motion machine, fuelled by skillful direction from Doug
Liman (Swingers) and by a poundingly-appropriate soundtrack.  I didn't
find myself emotionally involved in anything that happens in Go, but I
became curiously entranced with the picture by the end.  It works on a
visceral level, but not on many others.</P>
<P>It also has no obvious narrative, though there are several small
stories that Liman and screenwriter John August skillfully intertwine. 
The first revolves around Ronna (Sarah Polley), a grocery store clerk by
day.  At work, she's approached by Adam and Zack (Scott Wolf and Jay
Mohr), a couple of guys looking for Ecstasy.  She goes out with her two
friends, Claire (Katie Holmes) and Mannie (Nathan Bexton) to find some
drugs, thinking that on the way she can make a few bucks to pay for her
rent.  Another plot involves Simon (Desmond Askew), a Brit who works
with Ronna at the store.  He goes off to Vegas with his friends (Taye
Diggs, Breckin Meyer, and James Duval), and they end up getting into
trouble with a strip-joint owner (Jimmy Schubert) and is father (J.E.
Freeman).  There is also a segment dedicated to Adam and Zack, but that
one has the most surprises and shouldn't be described here.</P>
<P>Go is a film propelled entirely by style and acting, and that's not
necessarily a bad thing.  Liman, as I said, is very good at what he does
(I liked this picture more than the overrated Swingers).  There's a
certain eclectic quality about the scenes in Go, one of unpredictability
mixed with an acute sense of adventure.  August's smartly-crafted
(Tarantino-style) script helps underline this tone; the story overflows
with pop-culture references and ultracool dialogue, and so most viewers
under the age of thirty-five are likely to find Go a fast-paced blast. 
It also helps that most of the performances are so strong and memorable;
Sarah Polley (The Sweet Hereafter) stands out among the crowd, never
failing to give her lines a punch of pointed cynicism.  William Fichtner
(Armageddon, Contact) is brilliant as a cop of a peculiar temperament,
one who is "open to new things."  Breckin Meyer has an incredibly funny
role as a white guy who wishes he were black.  I was impressed with both
Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf for their subtlety.  And Desmond Askew is a
likable kind of flawed hero, and constantly finds himself in
unexplainable situations (one of which involves two naked women and a
conflagration in a hotel room).</P>
<P>There are numerous scenes that don't work at all.  I didn't like the
one that involves a certain young woman getting nailed by a yellow
Miata; it's played for laughs, though it's not the slightest bit funny. 
This is later followed up by a scene in which the drivers of the Miata
attempt to dispose of the body, and it's generally unpleasant.  There
are also some points during which the characters are forced to be
incredibly stupid; when Simon and Marcus steal a Ferrari, I was rolling
my eyes and wondering what possessed them to do such a thing.  The real
problem is that Liman presents the material with such hip sarcasm that I
found it impossible to invest any kind of true feeling for the
characters.  But these aren't fatal flaws; Go is still an amazingly
entertaining film, one that is clearly in tune to the way people like
this think and talk.  And there's certainly no way it can bore you; one
thing you can count on is a whole lot of going.</P>
