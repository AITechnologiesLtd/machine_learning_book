A Film Review by James Kendrick</PRE>
<P>Director: Richard T. Heffron /
Screenplay: Larry Cohen (based on the novel by Mickey Spillane) /</P>
<P>Stars: Armand Assante (Mike Hammer), Barbara Carrera (Dr.
Charlotte Bennett), Laurene Landon (Velda), Alan King (Charles
Kalecki), Geoffrey Lewis (Joe Butler), Paul Sorvino (Detective
Pat Chambers), Judson Scott (Charles Hendricks), Barry Snider
(Romero), Julia Barr (Norma Childs) /
MPAA Rating: R /
Review: *1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>In the 1982 updating of Mickey Spillane's 1947 novel "I, The
Jury," hard-boiled detective Mike Hammer is a Vietnam vet who
drives a shiny bronze Trans Am, dresses like Don Johnson in
"Miami Vice" with less pastels, and has sworn off alcohol.
However, he still smokes his Lucky Strikes, detests all forms of
authority, and kills at a whim. Beyond that, the updated film
retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy
page-turner by Spillane, probably the most infamous and often
reviled of all mystery writers.</P>
<P>The movie starts off with a bang: a howler of an opening credits
sequence that is a cheap steal from the James Bond series,
complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by
Bill Conti ("Rocky"). After that, the movie and the book begin
the same, with the murder of Jack Williams (Frederick Downs), a
one-armed detective and Hammer's best friend. Hammer declares
that he will seek vengeance for Jack's death, and with the help
of his devoted secretary, the blond and shapely Velda (Laurene
Landon), and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief
Pat Chambers (Paul Sorvino), he is immediately on the killer's
trail.</P>
<P>Here the movie splits completely from the book, and dives into a
convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind
control tactics involving the Mafia, the CIA, one of Hammer's
Vietnam vet buddies, and a kinky sex clinic. Many of the same
characters from the book appear in the movie, but they take on
slightly different roles. For instance, Charles Kalecki (Alan
King), a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book, turns
into a suave mob boss. And, more importantly, Hammer's suspicious
love interest, Charlotte Bennett (Barbara Carrera), morphs from a
run-of-the-mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of
the sex clinic.</P>
<P>"I, The Jury" is one of several cinematic renditions of
Spillane's books (including a 1953 version which was made in
3-D), but this film differs from those earlier versions in one
major way: it includes all of the sex and violence Spillane wrote
about that could never be given screen treatment due to
Hollywood's production code. Although this takes the 1982 version
of "I, The Jury" closer to the core of the original subject
matter, it is in this aspect that the film received the most
criticism, because it took this new license to extremes that many
argued surpassed what was in the book.</P>
<P>Rest assured, the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity,
but it is thoroughly violent, especially toward women. It
features one woman having her neck slashed, a set of twins forced
to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual
deviant programmed by the CIA (Judson Scott), and another woman
shot point-blank in the belly by Hammer himself. No one would
deny that Spillane's writing has a definite misogynistic nature,
but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such
glorious screen treatment; its constant equation of sex and
violence, much of which is played with the intention of being
erotic, is quite unsettling. It's no surprise that the movie,
like the book, fades to black with a dead woman on the floor.</P>
<P>"I, The Jury" had a troubled production and was not
well-supported by the studio that made it, which is one
explanation why it didn't do well in theaters and many people
have forgotten that it was ever made. The script was written by
Larry Cohen, who is best known for his creatively cheesy but
nonetheless effective monster movies, like "It's Alive" (1974)
and its two sequels, "Q" (1981), and "The Stuff" (1985). Cohen
wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as
well, but he was yanked from the director's chair after only a
week's worth of shooting because he was already $100,000 over
budget.</P>
<P>He was quickly replaced by Richard T. Heffron, who has worked for
the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and
dozens of television projects. Heffron was obviously brought in
not for his talent, but because he could make the movie rapidly
and efficiently. It shows in the final product. Cohen had
personal interest in the updated version of Hammer, but Heffron
has none. He shot the movie quickly and clumsily, and although
some scenes ring true, most of them are flat, trite, and
invariably dull. The movie features numerous car chases,
shoot-outs, and stunts, but Heffron's background in television is
the dominant tone; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal
nudity, "I, The Jury," takes on the air of a made-for-TV quickie,
with no real punch or depth.</P>
<P>But the problems in "I, The Jury" run deeper than the technical.
The central fault in this updating is Mike Hammer, whose
character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties
to the eighties. Because Spillane wrote all his Hammer mysteries
in the first person, Hammer's character is central to the tale
because all the events are filtered through his persona. We never
really get that impression in the movie -- there is no
first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don't have
Hammer in them at all. Consequently, a great deal of the texture
of Spillane's storytelling is lost.</P>
<P>The period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea
because much of Hammer's moral code is thrown to the wind.
Despite his characterization as a hard-nosed, violent,
misogynistic killer, Hammer always stuck fervently to his own
moral code. The title itself, "I, The Jury," refers to his
anti-establishment notion of being his own law. Unlike private
eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the
police, Hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the
punishment.</P>
<P>In this way, he can be seen as "above the law," but he still
adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct, his own
morality. The movie forgoes that aspect of his character, and
Hammer comes off not only as amoral in society's terms, but in
any terms, especially his own. If anything, Hammer always had his
professionalism, but the movie does away with that in the first
three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of
a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being
unfaithful. Maybe the scene was intended for laughs, but it only
cheapens Hammer's character and is, by all accounts, a lousy way
to start the movie.</P>
<P>The blame for Hammer's character can't be laid on Assante's
shoulders, because despite some unnecessary Marlon Brandon-like
mumbling, he delivers a fine performance. Spillane never once
described Hammer's physical attributes in any of the dozen books
in which he appeared, so any actor could conceivably portray him.
Of course, because of the lack of written description, those who
have read Spillane's books will have a strong personal notion of
what Hammer looks like, and therefore almost any screen
incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations (Spillane,
who played the character himself in 1963's "The Girl Hunters," is
generally considered the best of the film Hammers).</P>
<P>The rest of actors are most un-noteworthy. With the exceptions of
Alan King and Paul Sorvino, everyone who appeared in "I, The
Jury" were up-and-comers who basically went nowhere. Many of them
ended up working in television (like Carrera, who had a short
stint on "Dallas" in the mid-eighties), which only adds to the
made-for-TV atmosphere of the film. Maybe someday, someone will
manage to get the right elements together and make an effective
film rendition of a Spillane book, but this is certainly not it.</P>
