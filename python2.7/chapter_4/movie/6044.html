<PRE>                           THE FIRST WIVES CLUB
                       A film review by Joe Blenkle
                        Copyright 1996 Joe Blenkle</PRE>
<PRE>(***1/2 out of ****) Rated PG</PRE>
<P>Funny, funny, funny! Paramount's new comedy "The First Wives  Club" is
a well-rounded outing that has a little bit of everything.</P>
<P>Not only is it a very funny movie, it has its touching moments, a
little bit of drama, and lots of hijinx that will keep you in stitches
for the entire length of the film.</P>
<P>"The First Wives Club" stars Bette Midler as Brenda, Goldie Hawn as
Elsie, and Diane Keaton as Annie, three life-long friends that have
drifted apart in their years since college.</P>
<P>The trio is brought back together by the tragic suicide of another
friend, who despite her great wealth suffered from a failed marriage
and an unhappy, lonely life.</P>
<P>The "girls" find they have more in common with their departed friend
than they'd like to admit. Despite Brenda's loving son, Elsie's career
as an actress, and Annie's seemingly happy marriage and life as a
housewife, all three discover after a night of drinking that they are
all miserable.</P>
<P>Brenda and Elsie's husbands have dumped them for younger women and
Annie is soon to discover that husband Aaron's (Stephen Collins) night
on the town is only a gentle way of breaking the news to her that he
wants a divorce.</P>
<P>The girls ban together to form  "The First Wives Club" to hand a
little bit of misery back to their ex-husbands.</P>
<P>Brenda schemes to get the "goods" on ex-husband Morty's (Dan Hedaya)
selling stolen goods in his electronics store; Elsie is ordered to
liquidate all her and Bill's (Victor Garber) possessions and split the
money. She sells them to Annie for a dollar. Annie auctions them off
to raise enough money to buy her husband's advertising firm out from
underneath him.</P>
<P>The girls definitely get the goods on the guys with hilarious results.</P>
<P>The film also stars Sarah Jessica Parker as Shelly, a dim-wit blonde
who has taken up with Morty; Bronson Pinchot plays Duarto, an interior
decorator friend of Brenda; and Elizabeth Berkley (Phoebe) stars as
Bill's new (and not known to him - underage) love interest.</P>
<P>"The First Wives Club" is a Paramount Pictures presentation produced
by Scott Rudin and Directed by Hugh Wilson. Screenplay by Robert
Harling.</P>
