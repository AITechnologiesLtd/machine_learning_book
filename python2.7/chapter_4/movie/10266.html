<PRE>OPERATION CONDOR</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  *1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>The first scene of OPERATION CONDOR has Jackie Chan preparing for a
secret mission.  He attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum
into his mouth, but misses.  After they ricochet off his face, he
says, "Not a good start."  As it turns out, this line not only gives
foreshadowing to the opening sequence, but to the rest of the movie as
well.</P>
<P>In this, the latest of the Jackie Chan movies to be released in
America after first runs in Hong Kong, Chan plays an international
operative codenamed "Condor", and is tasked by the United Nations with
finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the Nazi's during
their retreat across the Saharan desert during the Second World War.</P>
<P>For some reason, Condor is given his mission at the U.S. embassy in
Spain.  I think this may have been done so that in a chase scene, they
could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart.
Watch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country, most notably
in Europe.  The chase will take itself through a marketplace, and a
fruit cart will be overturned.  It's almost a guarantee.  Anyway....</P>
<P>Condor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in
which the gold is hidden; the problem is that the key has insulators
integrated into it, which may mean a booby trap might be
electronically triggered if the key is used improperly.  To help him
figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly,
Condor is accompanied by a desert expert (Carol Cheng) and the
granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold (Eva
Cobo).  There aren't supposed to be any relatives of the Nazi captain
living in Spain, but Condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up
in the phone book or something.  Although these two women are supposed
to be integral parts of the mission, they prove no help at all except
to get in trouble and provide an excuse for Chan to jump into his
martial arts.  In fact, most of the scenes are so ridiculously
contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight.</P>
<P>I suppose this isn't so bad, since Chan's action is really the best
part of the movie, and the only reason you go to see one of his films
anyway.  If you've never seen a Jackie Chan movie, don't expect a
great plot, but do expect to be entertained by his moves.  They are so
well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is
human.  Knowing that he does his own stunts, and knowing that this is
the real stuff (no computer-masked bungee cords here) makes the action
sequences all the more exciting.  You've got to hand it to a guy who's
probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art.</P>
<P>Also of note in this, as in any Jackie Chan movie, is the humor.  As
far as I know, none of his films take themselves too seriously, and
even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue-in-cheek quality about
them.  What is almost masterful is the way that humor is even
integrated into the fight scenes.  Unlike a martial arts film such as
anything with Jean Claude Van Damme, where the fights get you on the
visceral level, fight scenes in Chan's movies are simply entertaining.
You marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a
way to make you laugh.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, even Chan's mastery can't save this film.  The plot and
characters are so weak that they don't hold the movie together at all,
and the acting is terrible.  Carol Cheng has apparently won best
actress honors at the Hong Kong Movie Awards in the past, but since
OPERATION CONDOR is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off.
This, combined with an obviously low production value made we want to
turn away from the screen until I heard those kicks start flying.</P>
