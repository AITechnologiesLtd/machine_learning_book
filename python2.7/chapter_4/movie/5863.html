<PRE>                                 GIRL 6
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Ten years ago with SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT, his first 
film, Spike Lee made a critically-acclaimed movie about a woman 
who wanted sex without commitment. Now, with GIRL 6, he tells 
the story of a woman who wants sex without physical contact. 
Played by Theresa Randle, the main character is a struggling 
actress who is trying to break into film but finds it impossible 
to get a decent role she doesn't have to take her clothes off 
for.</P>
<P>        Apparently, Randle herself didn't have this conviction, 
for even in the scene in which Lee is trying to show the corruption 
of the movie business in taking tits over talent by having guest star 
Quentin Tarantino (as "QT," the hottest director in Hollywood) 
force Randle to expose her breasts in an audition, Lee has her 
appear topless. If this isn't the irony of ironies, I don't know what 
is.</P>
<P>        Randle can't find a decent acting job, so she decides to 
settle for another type of acting -- phone sex. She makes her 
rounds of the New York phone entertainment scene, including a 
Bell brothel headed up by Madonna, who tells Randle a typical 
phone sex conversation may include "toilet training, bestiality, 
foot fetishes, butt plugs, three ways, five ways, six ways..." 
Coincidentally, those seven things are all on Madonna's "To 
Do" list most days.</P>
<P>        Randle eventually becomes Girl 6 at an upscale phone 
sex operation, where the operators are model-gorgeous women 
worth paying five bucks a minute for. Naomi Campbell is even 
one of the phone operators, seen wearing a t-shirt inscribed 
"Models Suck" (but let's leave what they have to do to get 
their contracts out of this). I'm pretty sure Lee's view of the 
women behind the phones isn't quite as accurate as the Aerosmith 
"Sweet Emotion" video, where the obese housewife with a crying 
baby on her shoulder did the chores while seducing horny guys 
on the phone.</P>
<P>        Girl 6 finds she does a pretty good job of getting men 
off, from her dominatrix character April to girl-next-door Lovely. 
Soon she finds herself enjoying the power she has over men and 
the no-strings-attached thrill of it all. She slowly begins to withdraw 
from the real world and into the phone sex one, while her close 
friend Spike Lee and ex-husband-but-still-in-love-with-her Isaiah 
Washington grow more and more concerned about her.</P>
<P>        Even though almost all the beautiful women working 
there are black (with the exception of the absolutely sexy Kristen 
Wilson), they're instructed to identify themselves as white unless 
someone requests another slice of the racial pie. But we're constantly 
reminded of Girl 6's race by her intrusive fantasies, where she 
pictures herself in the role of great black women through 
entertainment history, from Foxy Brown to Thelma on "The 
Jeffersons." (Seeing Spike Lee play George Jefferson is well 
worth the price of the video rental.)</P>
<P>        Those scenes, and many others in this 108-minute movie, 
are needless padding that bring the movie down. GIRL 6 starts out 
a decent movie, and some of the early phone sex scenes are 
simultaneously hilarious and fascinating, but the movie crashes 
and burns fast, leaving a surreal climax and about fifteen boring 
minutes after that. The entire time, old and new Prince songs play 
constantly in the background, from opening credits to end credits. 
The last lyric before the fade-to-credits is something like, "Nothing 
good lasts forever," which describes GIRL 6 all too well.</P>
