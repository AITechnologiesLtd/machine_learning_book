<P>Andy Tennant's Anna and the King is so full of ideas that it doesn't need 
all of the gripping action.  But the action doesn't hurt.</P>
<P>In 1862 a widowed Englishwoman named Anna Leonowens brings her son Louis 
from India to Siam (now Thailand).  Already we have a white woman fending 
for herself in a culture in which men are all-powerful, and the king is a 
god.  Mrs. Leonowens (Jody Foster) is charged with educating the fifty-odd 
children of the King of Siam (Chow Yun-Fat);  she is a Bible-reading 
Christian bent on preserving the Western traditions that shape her life.  
Although the king is open-minded enough to know his children need to know 
about Western ways in order to carry Siam into the modern world, he is 
firmly grounded in his world:  Buddhism, polygamy, slave-owning, monarchy.  
Nothing but conflict could result from his meeting a strong-minded woman who 
refuses to touch her forehead to the ground before his feet.</P>
<P>Heard this story before?  Yes, it's the same source material used in the 
Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I, the king's role made famous 
by Yul Brynner, and played recently by Lou Diamond Phillips.  This film is 
no musical, though its score is indeed well done (save for the forgettable 
pop song that runs over the early closing credits).  The king's large family 
and the clash between cultures remain central here, and even the motif of 
dancing has survived, a metaphorical substitution for passion, perhaps.  But 
what helps this modern adaptation of Anna Leonowens' memoirs is the 
political and military intrigue.</P>
<P>Like a terrible news item from a contemporary Third World country, death 
squads are killing innocent Siamese women and children, and hanging their 
bodies as warnings to peasants.  These Burmese squads appear to be under the 
distant protection of English interests, as trading and other commercial 
ventures have resulted in British presence around the globe.  So King 
Mongkut of Siam is forced to dispatch a regiment to deal with these 
black-clothed marauders.  Deceit and betrayal quickly enter the picture, and 
the very existence of the dynasty is threatened.  Thus the stage is set for 
war, the ultimate backdrop to highlight the personal stories that make up 
the subplots.</P>
<P>As Anna Leonowens, Jody Foster would seem to be the wrong pick.  An American 
to play such a British character?  But Foster pulls it off admirably, with 
the understated acting that only a veteran could deliver.  At times her 
voice is almost too quiet, even raspy, as she converses with her son, 
reinforcing lessons the boy's father would have liked.  It's rather a 
pleasure to see such a human portrayal, instead of the bucking-up, 
bearing-down façade that has become a stereotype for any Englishman faced 
with oppression.  And her dialect works as well - I did not detect one 
slippage, one American pronunciation.</P>
<P>Foster's performance is outshone only by the performance of Chow Yun-Fat as 
the King.  His acting is understated as well, buttressed by a smooth 
confidence that convinces us in every scene we watch.  Clearly Chow is 
expert in mixing the conflicting elements of real characters, in this case a 
domineering mien blended with bemused tolerance.  Look for him to be 
nominated for several awards for this solid portrayal.</P>
<P>The other cast members turn in strong support.  As the young heir to the 
throne, Prince Chulalongkorn, Keith Chin is very convincing.  Director Andy 
Tennant makes full use of the Prince's position, as a short voice-over tells 
us how the future ruler was influenced by his father and the foreign woman 
who touched their lives.  Randall Duk Kim is perfectly cast as General Alak, 
a soldier and indefatigable politician, his grimaces and pronouncements 
memorable.</P>
<P>Another star of this film is the costumes.  Remarkable Victorian dresses 
adorn Anna and the Siamese women during the banquet staged to impress 
English visitors.  Further, the colorful native garb is wonderfully 
designed.  The word "sumptuous" comes to mind, almost too much so, 
considering that the 1860's setting.  Similar applause goes to the set 
decoration, such an important aspect in a period drama.</P>
<P>The main message of the film can be interpreted as a simple statement:  
personal freedom is paramount.  In this film we can trace the ideas upon 
which much of Western civilization was founded - especially the emergence of 
the importance of the individual, and the realization that love is the food 
without which the human soul starves.  It's ironic that the king of the 
Siamese Empire, whose most trusted general hates imperialistic influences, 
ends up admitting that he can understand how a man could love just one 
woman, a way of life widespread in the West.  Of course this theme is very 
bankable, and happens here to tie in perfectly with the film's sources of 
conflict:  a society dominated by males, predicated on slavery, and steeped 
in the methods of a feudal past.</P>
<P>So the reason Anna and the King succeeds is clear:  its director uses an 
epic frame but highlights a very intimate story.  It's the same with any 
good story - within the span of history we are fascinated by well-drawn 
characters.  It's also clear that the tendencies of Hollywood resemble those 
of human nature:  a short memory never learns a lesson.</P>
<P>This film needs to be as long as it is, 140 minutes, occupying its length 
with meaningful scenes and a climax reminiscent of mid-century war films.  
The few scenes of violence remind us of the differences inherent in cultures 
distant in both miles and time.  There is no nudity or vulgar language, 
although the word "concubine" surfaces now and again.  Viewers 10 and over 
will enjoy the action and learn from the history.</P>
