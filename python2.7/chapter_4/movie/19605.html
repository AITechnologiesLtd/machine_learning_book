<PRE>INSPECTOR GADGET
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>A thumb that turns into a cigarette lighter. That's about as funny as
INSPECTOR GADGET ever gets. Disney's new live-action movie pins all of
its hopes for laughter on such sight gags.</P>
<P>As the gadget-laden hero, Inspector Gadget, poor Matthew Broderick is
stuck yet again in a movie in which he delivers an awkward performance
in an underwritten role. Broderick invests little emotional energy in
the part of a guy whose reconstructed body is a collection of gadgets
and gizmos.</P>
<P>The writing credits go to a committee of four (Dana Olsen, Kerry Ehrin,
Zak Penn and Audrey Wells). The quality of a script is usually inversely
proportional to the number of writers, and this screenplay is no
exception. The dialog packs no punch whatsoever, leaving the physical
comedy alone to carry the picture.</P>
<P>The one-joke movie consists of having Inspector Gadget, a kid's version
of RoboCop, demonstrating all of his hardware. The comedy comes from the
way the mechanisms frequently go awry, causing such "hilarious" mistakes
as various parts of his body crashing through ceilings and walls. The
result is a movie with a laugh count of maybe one or two small chuckles.</P>
<P>As written, was the project doomed? Perhaps not. Consider, for a minute,
what it might have become with Brendan Fraser. He throws himself heart
and soul into his every part. Willing to risk looking completely
ridiculous, Fraser usually dazzles us with his comedic bravado.
Broderick, on the other hand, never convinces us he even wants to be on
the set.</P>
<P>Still, even the usually reliable Rupert Everett, who plays the movie's
villain, Claw, doesn't show much spark in his acting.</P>
<P>There is one undeniably enjoyable part of the production. It doesn't
last long.</P>
<P>INSPECTOR GADGET runs 1:20. It is rated PG for wacky violence/action,
language and innuendo and would be fine for kids of all ages.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 10, gave the movie ** 1/2, complaining that it
didn't have enough action, comedy or mystery. His buddy Nickolas, age
10, gave the film ***. He thought the movie needed more action, but he
really liked the talking car in it.</P>
