<P>     Life in post-Communist Ukraine has not been kind to Anatoly
(Alexandre Lazarev).  A respected academic and linguist before the
collapse of the Soviet Union, Anatoly now finds his skills useful only for
translating business deals at a few dollars a shot.  Even his wife Katia
(Angelika Nevolina) is finding a better deal in an affair with a
co-worker.  Feeling depressed and obsolete, Anatoly decides on a
thoroughly market-economy solution to his woes:  through a friend (Eugen
Pachin), he hires someone to kill him.  The problems ensue when Anatoly
changes his mind, and the only way to end the contract on his life is to
hire another killer to eliminate the first.</P>
<P>     This might seem like the premise for a slapstick farce; in fact, it
might sound strangely similar to the premise for Warren Beatty's current
BULWORTH.  But like BULWORTH, A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED takes that premise
and steers it into some astute social commentary.  Director Vyacheslav
Krishtofovich and screenwriter Andrei Kourkov may romanticize the
Communist past, but they also paint an intriguing picture of people
adapting to the capitalist present.  Many dive into the world of crime
without any understanding of the potential consequences -- a bright-eyed
young prostitute (Tatiana Kravitska) believes she can marry a violent man
and still carry on with her work as though nothing had changed, while a
hired killer leaves behind a wife and baby when his profession finally
catches up with him.  It is left to Anatoly to grasp the dangerous course
his country is on, and to take a step which will turn compassion into a
marketable commodity.</P>
<P>     A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED might have been an even more compelling film
if it had been more consistent, both in tone and pacing.  At times it
takes on the tense atmosphere of an espionage thriller; at other times, it
has the loping pace of deadpan comedy; at still other times, there is the
stark sincerity of domestic drama.  Each is effective in its own way, but
in combination they can leave you wondering how you're supposed to feel
about the strange events in Anatoly's life.  Fortunately, that confusion
plays a significant role in this story of complex social change where the
rules are still being determined.  It is also fortunate that Alexandre
Lazarev, with his soulful eyes and weary decency, makes for such a
sympathetic tour guide through this world.  A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED is a
slightly blurry window onto a morally-blurry world and the people trying
to survive while they try to make it all a bit more clear.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 shaken Kievs:  7.</PRE>
