<PRE>Go </PRE>
<P>Chad'z rating: **** (out of 4 = excellent)</P>
<P>1999, R, 103 minutes [1 hour, 43 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[adventure/comedy]</PRE>
<P>Starring: Sarah Polley (Ronna), Desmond Askew (Simon), Jay Mohr (Zack), Scott 
Wolf (Adam); written by John August; produced by Matt Freeman, Mickey 
Liddell, Paul Rosenberg; directed by Doug Liman.</P>
<P>Seen April 16, 1999 at 10 p.m. at Crossgates Cinema 18 (Guilderland, N.Y.), 
theater #15, by myself for free using my Hoyts' critic's pass. [Theater 
rating: ***1/2: very good seats, sound and picture]</P>
<P>        Do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just 
become part of a story? Everyone has their own life story, both past and 
present, and every time two or more interact, they become part of each 
others' story (not necessarily an important or even significant part, but a 
part nevertheless). That seems to be the basic theory behind `Go,' where 
several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways.</P>
<P>        In order to test this theory screenwriter John August and director 
Doug Liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types 
to have an entire film revolve around them, such as a teenage supermarket 
cashier, a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera 
actors. These types of characters might not sound all that original, but 
consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and 
his psychotic father, a mid-level drug dealer, a narc obsessed with 
multi-level-marketing, horny wedding guests, a Zen lovemaker, two 
shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out.</P>
<P>        How they will all come together is the process the film deals with. 
I'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing 
themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a 
terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general.</P>
<P>        The film starts out as anything else, with little indication of 
what's to come. We meet Ronna (Polley), a depressed Los Angeles checkout girl 
who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay 
her rent. She's not very charming, especially to her customers, but this is 
played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works. Maybe 
this is because she's not a very afeminite character, but she's far from 
masculine - a creative character indeed.</P>
<P>        Things start to progress when Ronna reluctantly agrees to take the 
hours of the goofy, hyperactive, yet likable Simon (Askew), an English teen 
into vices for the sake of the experiences. This agreement starts a 
three-pronged storyline as it allows Simon to go to Las Vegas for the weekend 
with his friends and in turn drags Ronna and her friends into buying and 
selling an experimental drug. The process of which will not only bring Ronna 
close to being arrested but also to death.</P>
<P>        Nearly the same can be said for two other characters, Zack (Mohr) and 
Adam (Wolf), who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting 
characters, but later will become major players to the film's makeup - 
another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how 
significant insignificant interaction might be.</P>
<P>        Once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle. 
When the title screen `Ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned 
turning point scene, it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard 
linear method of storytelling. Considering how good it is up until that 
point, it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today.</P>
<P>        And so the film begins to take shape, first by following Ronna and 
her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated 
by Zack and Adam (who were actually looking for Simon), which doesn't exactly 
go as planned, but that's what keeps it all so interesting.</P>
<P>        The second storyline starts at the same moment as Ronna's story, but 
this time the camera chooses to follow Simon instead. Simon and his three 
friends head to ‘Vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience 
things they never would have imagined. </P>
<P>        The third arc, about Zack and Adam, again overlaps with Ronna's story 
telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle. We're 
shown things we never would have expected were going on while following 
Ronna. And many of the events that do happen to Ronna because of Zack and 
Adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when 
they were.</P>
<P>        I'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and 
especially how the film wraps up in the end, but that would take up too much 
time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film. 
Perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and 
unpredictability, and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay, just 
through great filmmaking.</P>
<PRE>        Still, I can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well:</PRE>
<P>• Direction: Trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task 
and for a rookie filmmaker such as Liman, it's a great accomplishment. He 
doesn't just depict a story, he wraps us up in it all, pulling us into the 
fray so that we experience every high and low.</P>
<P>• Screenplay: Besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general, 
it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources, with both obvious 
and subtle references, yet it never screams `rip-off.' </P>
<P>• Tone/mood: Where other Hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of 
the independents to the mainstream, this one is able to create its own sense 
of the macabre. It's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so 
satirical for it to be considered a black comedy, more like `macabre light.'</P>
<P>• Cinematography/art direction: Able to photograph both the intense and the 
lighthearted in the same manner.  </P>
<P>• Characterization: For nearly every character introduced, no matter what 
role they play in the big picture, we're able to get a sense of who they are, 
what they're thinking and how they came to be in their situations. Even when 
their actions are surprising, it never seems very out of synch.</P>
<P>• Performances: Every actor nails their role (see above).</P>
<P>• Theme/theory: The film doesn't seem to be concerned with conveying any kind 
of political or social messages, instead, it's more of a philosophical 
experiment. In fact, it might not have meant to do that intentionally, but 
there definitely is something existential to it all.</P>
<P>...And to think that `Go' is just a big comedy and adventure! </P>
