<PRE>Talk Radio (1989)
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Unforgiving and bleak, but exacting portrait of a man drunk on the
power of his own words.</P>
<P>The biggest mistake would be to compare Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosian), the
non-hero of Oliver Stone's black-as-volcanic-glass TALK RADIO, to a specific
real-life radio personality such as Rush Limbaugh or Howard Stern. He has
the worst tendencies of *both* of them, to the point where politics and even
audience are irrelevant. He will do anything to get people to listen to him,
even though they're already his captive audience. And what do you think that
does to him, in the dark?</P>
<P>Expanded slightly from a stage play that Bogosian himself wrote, TALK RADIO
is not so much an analysis of the title subject but a character portrait.
Bogosian plays Champlain with machine-gun nastiness, getting mileage from
his cruel eagerness to rip up callers to his late-night talkfest. He is not
interested in actually *communicating* with anyone; he's like a verbal slam
dancer, abusing his audience to see if they really will come back for more.
He's convinced that 9/10ths of the world is stupider and crueler than he
could ever be, so he's obviously not going to be anywhere nearly as bad as
the jerk-offs who call him now, is he? Even if he tries to pander to their
worst instincts, how's he any worse off than the guy who beats his kids and
brags about it on-air?</P>
<P>We learn a bit more about Champlain outside of the studio -- his marriage,
his younger years, etc. They aren't dwelled on excessively; there's just
enough for us to get the picture. Champlain is smart, but has absolutely no
idea what to do with his smarts, other than test other people's limits and
see if they'll indulge him because he constantly astonishes them with his
verbal excesses. And how far does he go? At one point someone mails him
something that might be a bomb, and Champlain, smirking, rattles it next to
the microphone. This is not a man with his feet on the ground.</P>
<P>There are other things he does that are not as explicitly disturbing, but
that give unsettling clues to his personality. A foaming anti-Semite calls
in, and Champlain tries a bizarre psychological tactic on him -- trying to
play on his sympathy. But the guy doesn't have any, and there's a strong
hint that Champlain may be one of those people who will literally say
*anything* to get someone to stop hassling him. Which one's worse? Maybe
they're both examples of the same kind of scum -- people who live to goad
others and get intemperate reactions?</P>
<P>TALK RADIO is as intense and claustrophobic a movie as there might
conceivably be. It is also excellently written and directed, and for that
reason alone is worth seeing. The camera lives inside the studio, and the
movie operates more like the stage play than we might expect -- we have to
imagine the guy at the other end of the wire, and in Champlain's fetid,
vicious universe, that's something that makes us cringe. We already know
what Champlain himself his like -- what about his callers? And then the
movie decides to settle *that* question, once and for all.</P>
