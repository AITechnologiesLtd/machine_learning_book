<P>Species was one of the films I was most looking forward to in the
summer of 1995. The summer of 1995 turned out to be very
disappointing.</P>
<P>Species is one of the most intriguing, yet poorly written sci-fi idea
movies I've ever seen. An advanced alien race contacts Earth. In their
first message they send us the formula for a new fuel that will solve
many of our energy problems. This lets us know that their intentions
are friendly. In the second message, they send the code for a new
strand of DNA that will allow us to cross-breed our two species.</P>
<P>Now, my first question would be, why would we want that? Our pesky
scientists apparently do want this, and proceed to make a hybrid of
the two different species. After deciding to terminate the project
based on the alien's nature to want to destroy things, the alien (who
is a young girl at this point) decides that it doesn't want to die so
it promptly escapes (unseen and untouched from a maximum security
compound, mind you). It soon cocoons and evolves into Natasha
Henstridge. Now being in the form of a beautiful young woman, it's
hormones go crazy and it has the primal instinct to mate. Problem is,
it's offspring will evolve quickly, producing more offspring and soon
overtaking the human race.</P>
<P>Who would you send on a mission to destroy an alien that, if
unstopped, could lead to the destruction of everyone on earth?  The
army? The air force? No no, you send a government hitman (Madsen), two
scientists (Helgenberger, Molina), and a "psychic" (Forest
Whitaker). Now Madsen is useful, except for the fact that he uses a
handgun to battle the alien (and while his performance is
entertaining, never once does he seem to take anything seriously). The
other three characters are absolutely worthless. Molina has absolutely
NO reason to be there, except to identify the cocoon early in the
film. The rest of the time he just tries to get chicks. Helgenberger
is just there to provide a love interest for Madsen, and
Whitaker... well he plays one of the worst characters of them
all. We're told he's a psychic, but he's the lamest psychic I've ever
seen. For example, when they discover the cocoon and a bloody mess of
goo, he tells them that he feels that something bad happened. Really?
Later, they've tracked Henstridge's car which has run out of gas. He
examines the car, then informs everyone that "she walked". Really?!
You think so?!?! This happens repeatedly.</P>
<P>Also, just as a little aside here, Species starts out with just about
the most dull, drab, and ridiculously boring credit sequence I've ever
seen. Boy, nothing gets me in the mood for a sci-fi action flick more
than five minutes of slow boring credits with absolutely nothing going
on behind them.</P>
<P>Most folks who enjoyed Species admit that it's retarded, but they just
like the fact that Natasha Henstridge is running around naked for the
entire film. And sure, that's good stuff. But you can have an
attractive naked girl running around and still have a good script to
back it up. And unfortunately, all Species has is the naked girl. [R]</P>
