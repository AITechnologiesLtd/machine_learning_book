<P>It might sound like a very special episode of Barney Miller, but The
Annihilation of Fish is actually one of those romantic comedies that
features senior citizens doing the Metamucil mambo.  Ordinarily, the
idea of two old people in love is as nauseating as the prospect of a
Bush presidency, but Fish makes both its leads nuttier than a Snickers
bar, and, as a result, the film is entertaining rather than sickening
and sappy.</P>
<P>Fish takes place in a Los Angeles boarding house, where two elderly
crackpots rent upstairs apartments.  Obidiah "Fish" Johnson (James Earl
Jones) is a retired Jamaican janitor who has recently been released from
an institution.  He seems like a normal guy, except when a demon named
Hank appears from time to time to stir up trouble.  The flesh-and-bone
Fish and the invisible Hank go toe-to-toe in numerous unannounced
wrestling matches, which, of course, make everybody else think Fish is
off his nut.</P>
<P>Poinsettia Cummings (Lynn Redgrave) lives across the hall from Fish, and
her quirk (other than being a fall-down drunk) is that she thinks she's
in a relationship with deceased opera legend Puccini.  Fish and
Poinsettia don't have much to do with each other as the film opens, but
he begins to help her stumble into her apartment after a night of
drinking with Puccini.  They start drinking tea and playing rummy
together, and Poinsettia even begins to referee the wrestling matches
between Fish and Hank.  Before long, they're doing the Unthinkable Act.</P>
<P>But as they grow closer, Hank becomes upset that Fish is banging the
referee, and Fish is forced to choose between the invisible demon who
kicks him in the crotch or the daffy woman that puts out.  And if that
doesn't sound wacky enough, the lady who owns the boarding house (played
by real-life kook Margot Kidder) spends her days adding letters to her
last name and growing a giant weed in her garden to piss off her dead
husband.</P>
<P>Directed by Charles Burnett (The Glass Shield), Fish is a guaranteed
crowd-pleaser, no doubt due to the fine performances from Jones (other
than his poor accent) and Redgrave.  The film is oddly heartwarming,
while similar films about unlikely lovers that aren't young and
beautiful and perfect (like the deplorable The Other Sister) are nothing
but crap. Fish has been bouncing around film festivals for nearly two
years, but, based on the crowd reaction it's received, deserves a nice
distribution deal so it can be seen by a wider audience.</P>
