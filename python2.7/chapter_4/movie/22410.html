<P>[Author's note: Just as I noted in my review/analysis of  "The Best 
Man", I offer the following disclaimer: the text below is something more 
than a "standard" review.  Purposefully, I wanted to do more than just 
say "I liked this movie" or "I didn't like this movie", as "Any Given 
Sunday" struck me on a different level than "just another movie".  To 
that end, the following is much more detailed, story-wise, than those 
who have not yet seen the movie, may want to read; it is more a film 
analysis, I suppose, than a straight review.  The reader is referred to 
read small snippets of both my and The Diva's opinion on this flick on  
"Movie Bytes", as well as reading her separate  "Any Given Sunday" 
review (and even if you don't mind my spoilage, read it anyway, on its 
own merits).</P>

<P>Professional Football: a game--a game, I say!--where grown men get paid 
obscene amounts of loot and booty to chase a weirdly-shaped ball up and 
down a field.  Which is to say, I can't stand pro football (or, for that 
matter, most other pro sports).</P>
<P>So why am I reviewing the football flick "Any Given Sunday", hmmm?  
Hmmm...</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
"On any given Sunday, any team can win or lose".  Such is the type of 
platitude spouted by Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), the tired, worn-out coach 
of the Miami Sharks pro football team.  A so-so team that's seen its 
glory days behind it and is fading fast, the Sharks chances of making it 
to the playoffs are threatened by the injury of aging veteran 
quarterback Jack "Cap" Rooney (Dennis Quaid)--who, along with Luther 
"Shark" Lavay (former real-life football player Lawrence Taylor) was 
already considered to be expendable by owner Christina Pagniacci 
(Cameron Diaz in a tour-de-force role), a no-nonsense hard-hitter who 
inherited the team from her late father, who was also Tony's old 
compatriot.  But Pagniacci is not the least of D'Amato's worries: he 
also has to contend with idiot sports reporter Jack Rose (John 
McGinley); hungry assistant coach Nick Crozier (Aaron Eckhart); slimy 
team doctor Harvey Mandrake (James Woods); showboat running back Julian 
Washington (LL Cool J); and third-string young gun quarterback Willie 
Beamon (the outstanding Jamie Foxx), a wild player (on and off the 
field) who has a strange projectile ritual.</P>
<P>The Upshot (WARNING: **more-than-usual spoilers contained below**):
This flick opens with a quote by legendary football coach Vince 
Lombardi, who compares football players to warriors--and this theme is 
advanced throughout the movie by D'Amato and others.  "Not an auspicious 
start to this flick," thought I; "these overpaid boys (and girls, as in 
the case of owner Pagniacci) owe an apology to the real warriors of the 
world for being so full of themselves to make such ridiculous 
comparisons."  But that's another rant for another time...</P>
<P>Fortunately, I was distracted from that rant by the opening images of 
the Sharks and their opponents; director Oliver Stone (who, casting 
himself as a football announcer, might have found a new calling) and his 
cinematographer grabs the viewer right off the bat with the MTV-like 
cuts from the field to the stands to overhead shots of the stadium and 
back; similar photography is shot throughout a great deal of the movie.  
In the hands of a lesser (younger?) cast and director, this camerawork 
might've shown the emptiness under the window dressing; but here, it 
emphasizes the storyline--to the deficit of the traditionally-shot, 
slower parts of the story.  Those bits dragged the flick down more than 
they would have in "normal" situations, and made the time more 
noticeable.</P>
<P>But again fortunately, the "drag" times were few and far between.  The 
story was a standard one, pitting Old School (D'Amato, Cap, and 
Julian--yes, Julian; a flashy showboater, to be sure, but still 
respectful of the old ways) versus New Jack (Pagniacci, Nick, and 
Beamon) in a "duh, we knew that" parable (Owners are greedy fat cats who 
only care about the bottom line: "Mo' Money"; older Players are grizzled 
rich men who Do It For The Gipper; younger Players are spoiled rich boys 
who Do It For The Benjamins--and the adoring fans, who keep giving them 
The Benjamins; team doctors just wanna Pump You Up).  But the story is 
told in a fresh, non-straightforward way that keeps the audience's 
attention for the most part; and though most of the characters lines are 
drawn early on, with the exception of Matthew Modine's Dr. Oliver 
Powers--a "goody two-shoes" doctor who fronts Dr. Mandrake about his 
ethics--few, if any of the characters have a surplus of redeeming 
qualities (and even Powers' "goodness" is called to question late in the 
movie).</P>
<P>Indeed, the best part of the telling of "Sunday" lies in the "Badness" 
of the characters: D'Amato is a frightened has-been with narrow vision; 
Pagniacci Has No Heart; Washington can't hold on to the ball in his 
anxiousness to get to the next page in the record books; Shark has more 
brawn than brains when it comes to his health; Beamon gets the big head 
and disses his teammates and his girlfriend, Vanessa Struthers (Lela 
Rochon, a long way from her Siren of "Waiting To Exhale"--but, though a 
bit more chunky, still pretty); Mayor Tyrone Smalls (Clifton Davis), a 
Black man, is shown as questionably dirty as any White politician might 
be (more on the importance of that in "The Black Factor"); assistant 
coach Montezuma Monroe (Jim Brown, in another standout role) doesn't 
pamper his players one iota, calling their manhood into question at the 
drop of a hat; in a small, but noticeable bit, Cap's wife Cindy (Lauren 
Holly) shocks us with her bitchitude; and so on.  Not many totally 
redeeming qualities in this bunch.  And up to the point where Pagniacci 
and Beamon See The Light, I grooved on their Badness.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Logan almost blew the lead the story had in the first 
three quarters, in a "delay of game" snoozer of a last quarter.  Having 
told more here than I'd intended to, I won't fumble the ending except to 
say that, considering what happened in the steam room scene, I came to 
expect the ending that played itself out.  And, I find I need to qualify 
the above sentiment: though the last quarter of the flick was 
disappointing, D'Amato's action in the last scene was excellent, showing 
glimpses of the heat that Al Pacino once had oozing through his acting 
pores but now seems to have lost as he's grown older (I preface this 
with the admittance that, not having seen "The Insider" yet, I don't 
know whether Pacino's tiredness throughout in this movie was indicative 
of his acting chops as of late, or just being intentionally 
in-character).</P>
<P>Though the photography and direction were great, the members of this 
large cast were just as important to this flick.  As noted above, Foxx, 
Diaz, and Brown were superb; Pacino and Quaid, though solid, played as 
"old" as they looked, Quaid almost to the point of being there to just 
pass Go, collect $200 (plus a percentage of the receipts).  If I hadn't 
seen the execrable "True Crime", I might've given Woods some play here; 
but since he's playing the same one-note character here that he did in 
that movie, his just-short-of "over the top" acting gets no love from 
this reviewer; Bill Bellamy (as wide receiver Jimmy Sanderson) made me 
smile with his pep talk to himself, though he was far overshadowed by 
Foxx and LL Cool J (who, himself, I saw as being excess luggage here).  
But on a sour note, as the constantly-soused Margaret Pagniacci 
(Christina's wacky mother), Ann-Margaret was just irritating; I was too 
oft reminded of whazhername's character on "Overboard" (a wholly 
forgettable Goldie Hawn/Kurt Russell flick that I can't be arsed to look 
up on the IMDB; trust me, it ain't worth the effort).  And is it just 
me, or did the appearance of a movie clip actor Charlton Heston was 
featured in, blow any currency his Commissioner character, could've had? </P>
<P>If you're like me, the players (on and off the field) in "Any Given 
Sunday" won't elicit any sympathy--and neither will their counterparts 
in real life: oh, he didn't make a kabillion dollar bonus for kicking 
the most punts in a season? boofrigginhoo; what, she was made to jump 
off a short pier after her lame team didn't clear .500? good; serves her 
right.  But the story here was told well enough to let me leave my 
cynicism about the Games grown folk play, on the sidelines for three 
hours (and by the way, it is a coincidence that this movie lasted damn 
near as long as a real pro game would?  Hmmm...)</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
I can't speak highly enough of Jamie Foxx in his role in this flick; 
though I knew he was funny and talented from his "In Living Color" days 
[nota bene, Hollywood: Jim Carrey wasn't the only one in that cast.  But 
they don' hear me doe...], and I've thus far managed to miss him in that 
show of his on the WB (aka, The Ghetto Network), the depth of his acting 
here really made me sit up and take notice.  Funny in the right spots 
("My Name Is Willie" had me rollin') but serious in others, he smoked 
Pacino in their breakfast scene together, and had some good stuff to say 
about the role of Black athletes--something that's been a long time in 
coming to be voiced on-screen.  But is anyone listening? </P>
<P>Another BF moment that stood out in a movie full of them, had to do with 
the characterization of the Mayor by Clifton Davis.  It is the stigma of 
the dearth of Black roles in movies, that when a Black person is shown, 
it's generally in either a comedic role, or as the Bad Guy.  That the 
Mayor could be played as a (questionably) Bad Guy here, was a bold move 
on the movie makers parts, I think; though there might be an outcry of 
"stereotyping!" by some Blacks, the sad reality is that there are some 
slimy Black politicians out there, just like their slimy White 
counterparts.  Forget spending all this energy on getting rid of the 
movie bad guys, dump the ones in real life, eh? </P>
<P>And I'm surprised that I've made it this far without mentioning that 
remarkable young man in the locker room, who didn't say much but whose 
mere presence said a mouthful.  I'll try to be good, but I don't know 
how much longer I'll be able to keep it up. </P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
It appears that long movies are becoming the norm these days: in the 
past few weeks, I've watched 10 hours between only four movies ("The 
Green Mile": 3 hrs. 15 min.; "Bicentennial Man": 2 hrs. 25 min.; "Stuart 
Little": 1 hr. 34 min.; and "Any Given Sunday": 2 hrs. 45 min.), with 
mixed results (my time in "Green" felt like a picnic compared to the 
torturous "Stuart").  Which goes to show that shorter is not necessarily 
better--but longer daggone bet' have a good reason for being so long.</P>
<P>For the most part, "Any Given Sunday" used its time well.  It could've 
stood a more careful snip or two in the editing box (and a little less 
ham-handedness during Beaman's and Christina's Obligatory Awakenings), 
but the excellent cinematography, tight cast, good soundtrack with more 
than just the usual Urban Contemporary song stylings offered (and yet, I 
must take issue with one of the "songs" featured during the game with 
the Rhinos, a rap number that prominently featured the phrase "my 
nigga".  When, My People? When?  sigh), and the great ending scene, made 
the time watching grown folk play their Games, time well-spent.  And did 
I mention bru-man in the locker room?  woo lawd.</P>
<P>"Any Given Sunday": (rating: greenlight)  
We have most def entered the MTV Generation of moviemaking (though 
including Oliver Stone in that description is a tenuous connection at 
best), where quick cuts and "special effects" rule the day in the movie 
theater.  What "Any Given Sunday" has that most MTV-esque flicks lack, 
though, is a mostly compelling story line (throughout the first 3/4, 
anyway), good acting (specifically from Jamie Foxx, Cameron Diaz, and 
surprisingly, Jim Brown) and an uncredited three-legged fella who has to 
be seen to be believed.</P>
