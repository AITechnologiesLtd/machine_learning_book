<P>Carl Franklin's breakthrough directorial film, joined Billy Bob
Thornton and his then-roommate Tom Epperson's critically-acclaimed
script, to become one of the best rated movies of 1992.
Thumb-rater-critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel respectively
acknowledged this film as the number one and number two rated film on
their annual top 10 best movies of the year list.</P>
<P>PLOT:
One white-trash huckster, his girlfriend Fantasia, and a cold, black
College grad are on the run from the police after they dispense of some
folks in a drug-related robbery. Headed towards her childhood town,
Fantasia and the quibbling duo, take every precaution to avoid
detection, but their respective weaknesses soon draw the L.A. police
and a local small town Sheriff, right onto their butts. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Gritty, engaging, enjoyable and laced with spurts of graphic violence,
this film presents us with several well-drawn out characters from
different backgrounds, and recounts a tale of greed, drugs and
accountability. The star of this film is definitely the script and the
characters so well portrayed by the respective actors in this film. The
story is evenly-paced and easy to handle, with the plot leading you
down several paths at once, twisting and turning when need be, and
adding several elements of the ol' small town humour. I really enjoyed
this movie because it was an original plot that had me extremely
interested in the characters and their eventual outcomes. </P>
<P>Bill Paxton was the standout in my mind as the perfectly naïve, but
enthusiastic small-town hick cop who reveled in the mere presence of a
couple of more seasoned L.A. cops. There is one particular scene in
which the out-of-town cops are speaking about him, without their
knowledge of his presence nearby, which will always be stapled in my
mind as an uncomfortable classic. Paxton's reaction after that scene
was superb, and left you feeling deeply for the man by the end of the
movie. Billy Bob was also excellent as the "good ol' boy" without the
deepest of consciences, and Michael Beach as the coldest, most ruthful
character that I have seen drawn to screen in a while. All in all, this
movie was an amazing achievement in the genre, and matches the Coen
brothers' classic BLOOD SIMPLE (8/10) and even John Dahl's RED ROCK
WEST (8/10). Even the ending was semi-ambiguous as to leave us with our
own conclusion. The characters are rich and lively, the script highly
involved, and the movie a solid piece of entertaining cinema.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Billy Bob Thornton and Cynda Williams (who plays Fantasia in this film)
were a married couple during the filming of this movie, but divorced
soon therafter. As of 1998, Billy Bob has been married and divorced
four times.
Bill Paxton does not particularly like being recognized as "Chet" from
1985's WEIRD SCIENCE (7.5/10). I wonder if it has anything to do with
the fact that he's transformed into a piece of turd by the end of film?</P>
<P>Director Carl Franklin was an actor by profession, before taking his
shot at directing. He had bit parts in various movies, and a handful of
TV shows including "The A-Team", "MacGyver", "Roseanne" and "The
Streets of San Francisco".
Michael Beach (who plays Pluto in this film) also played a cop named
Wurlitzer in 1993's TRUE ROMANCE (9/10).
Billy Bob Thornton and Bill Paxton re-teamed as costars in yet another
great small-town thriller, in 1998's A SIMPLE PLAN (8/10), as directed
by Mr. Sam Raimi.
Among the formative events of Billy Bob Thornton's childhood was the
forging of a friendship with Tom Epperson, with whom he would later
collaborate on several movie scripts, including this one. In 1977,
after quitting College after two semesters, and convinced that he had a
future in rock music, Thornton hooked up with his pal Epperson, who'd
become an aspiring novelist, and the two of them went seeking fame and
fortune in the Big Apple, where they managed to stick around almost
long enough to unpack before fleeing back to Arkansas in terror. By
1981, Thornton and Epperson had nerved themselves up for a second shot
at the big time, and, mindful of their lately discovered aversion to
East Coast living, headed for Los Angeles. Thornton scraped together
$200 to make the trip by driving a truck to Slidell, La., after his
supernaturally insightful mother helpfully prophesied that he would
"have some business" in a town of the same name. The pair worked odd
jobs and wrote scripts, and, two years after their arrival, Thornton
turned a serious eye to performing for the first time since high school
and began taking acting classes (He had a part in 1989's CHOPPER CHICKS
IN ZOMBIETOWN). A long dry spell ensued, and by 1984, the aspiring
actor was living so lean he suffered a near-fatal malnutrition-induced
heart failure brought on by weeks of eating nothing but potatoes. After
receiving high kudos for the script of this movie, Billy Bob finally
broke through in 1996, with his directorial debut of SLING BLADE
(6.5/10), which he also wrote and starred in.</P>
