<PRE>BREAKAWAY (1996)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Salaries of Hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large
these days and many find this to be the main reason for
skyrocketing movie budgets. Actors who demand such salaries
might be greedy, but in some instances they are quite
justified, because many films would never be watched or even
made without their participation. Proof for that can be
found even in the realm of low-budget movies, and one fine
example is BREAKAWAY, 1995 thriller directed by Sean Dash
and starring (in)famous figure skater Tonya Harding.</P>
<P>Face of Tonya Harding is most prominently featured on
movie's poster, but the main star of the film is Terri
Thompson who plays Myra, attractive woman who works as a
courier for gangster. One day she decides to retire, but her
employers are anything but enthusiastic about that.
Realising that her life suddenly became worthless, Myra
starts running for her life, followed by professional
assassins.</P>
<P>Terri Thompson being the actual star of the film instead of
Tonya Harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes
that feature former figure skater. Although Tonya Harding
displays convincing martial arts abilities, her acting
leaves much to be desired. On the other hand, her
disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film
that lacks originality, believable characters and situations
and actually represents anything that gave B-films a bad
name. Martin Sheen's brother Joe Estevez, whose character
looks like he had entered from another movies' set, is the
only bright spot of BREAKAWAY. Unfortunately, he appears in
this film too little too late to prevent viewers from
realising why Tonya Harding's silver screen debut proved to
be her last film.</P>
