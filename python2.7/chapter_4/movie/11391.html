<P>    A movie, play or novel that takes place in the distant past
gains resonance when we in the present can see its universal
truths. Thus the conflict between Montagues and Capulets in
Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" becomes the rivalry
between the Latinos and mostly Polish Americans in Arthur
Laurents' "West Side Story" and Julius Caesar turns into
Mussolini in contemporary versions of that slice of political
theater.  As you watch "Dangerous Beauty," which is set in
the Venice of the late 16th century, your mind may well
wander to today's news-monopolizing headlines about the
Monica Lewinsky affair, which has taken the shape of a story
about a young woman who has allegedly used her feminine
wiles in part to get herself employment in the glamour field of
women's cosmetics.  There are differences, as expected,
since in Jeannine Dominy's screenplay, based on a bio by
another woman, Margaret Rosenthal, the principal character--
who insists on a life of independence from the constrictions of
society--has little choice.  But similarities abound, in no small
part because in both the Lewinsky situation and that of the
person of Veronica Franco four centuries earlier, the mothers
are mentoring their daughters in their chosen, ill-reputed
avocations.</P>
<P>   "Dangerous Beauty" is the story of the lovely Veronica
Franco (Catherine McCormack), seemingly in her early
twenties, who is madly in love with the curly-haired Marco
Vernier (Rufus Sewell).  Marco has tasted the pleasures of
quite a number of the Venice aristocracy and loves Veronica
in return, but is culturally constricted.  Because of his high
position in the Venetian nobility, he is constrained by his
father (Jerome Krabbe) to marry someone of equal stature. 
Though Veronica's family has had a coat of arms for the past
seven hundred years, she has no dowry.  She is neither here
nor there.  Too blue-blooded to consider wedlock with
someone in the more proletarian orders and not sufficiently
wellborn to mate up with Marco, she is directed by her mother
Paola (Jacqueline Bisset) to become a courtesan, i.e. a high-
class prostitute, revealing that both Paola and Paola mother
were courtesans in their own youth.  </P>
<P>   Now, a courtesan in the Venice of the time is no
streetwalker but is, rather, quite the opposite.  She is a
woman sought out by the betters of the city-state because
she is intelligent, has an education far surpassing that of the
typical noble lady, and is as well-versed in protocol as the
graduate of any top American finishing school today.  She is
sought after for her cerebral charms as much as for her
carnal bent, principally by high-born fellows bored with their
vapid wives and bimbo girl friends.  The picture, directed with
only a portion of tongue in cheek by Marshall Herskovitz, is at
once a romance, an education in European politics, a feminist
tract, and an outright hoot.  The scene which best exemplifies
these missions is one in which Veronica is playing host to the
king of France, a man whose influence is badly needed by
Venice's ruler, since he has the power to lend the Italian city-
state the ships it needs to fight the invading Turks.  A night
with Veronica pursuing activities so strenuous that the king
can barely sit on the royal cushion in the morning leads to the
king's granting this favor to the doge.  Veronica becomes,
then, the face that launched a hundred ships.</P>
<P>   Perhaps no picture has done more to elevate the hooker's
status in the world than "Dangerous Beauty," formerly "The
Honest Courtesan," a title that was scrapped allegedly
because the producers feared that the public would think it
was a movie about cortisone.  Veronica is transformed by her
mother from a lovesick virgin to a courtly companion almost
overnight, acquiring an instant education at about the time
she learns to walk on shoes that could keep podiatrists in
business for several lifetimes.  She charms the nobility during
the day by matching her skill at inventing verse with Maffio
(Oliver Platt), a courtier and poet who grows to hate his rival
because he cannot afford a night in her boudoir.</P>
<P>   Of the performers, only Mr. Platt is miscast.  His ideal role
would have been that of a fool, a Sancho Panza to a story's
Quixote as in the forthcoming movie, "Bulworth."  The bulgy-
eyed Rufus Sewell, quickly becoming a hot property with a
role in the critically acclaimed "Dark City" which was released
at about the time of this film, is sexy enough.  But in shaping
his character, we wonder whether scripter Dominy is indulging
a male fantasy, that of a man who is eagerly sought in
marriage because of his repetitive conquests of other women
rather than in spite of this trait.  Jacqueline Bisset is the
woman most pleasant to look at, a mother more alluring than
Catherine McCormack, and in fact the whole picture is a
pretty spectacle filmed by Bojan Bazelli with post-card
splendor.  If producers Herskovitz, Ed Zwick, Arnon Mitchan
and Sarah Caplan were willing to write off some of their
audience by taking the story more seriously, the English
language would have to be scrapped in favor of Italian with
subtitles.  In any event, the story is involving throughout and
effectively carries the message that a smart woman will do
what she has to do to make it in a society which is still run by
men.  Rated R.  Running Time: 115 minutes.  (C) 1998
