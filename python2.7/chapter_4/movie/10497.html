<P>     THE POSTMAN is pretty bad.  Kevin Costner produces, directs, and
stars in this ponderous, preposterous post-apocalyptic epic about an
actor who dons a blue uniform as a trick to get food.  He spins a yarn
about a restored U.S. government, which inspires others to hit the sack,
which, in turn, unites several previously disconnected Pacific Northwest
communities.  The core story, here, is a good one, but the narrative too
often zigs when it should zag.  Costner indulges himself in such dopey
detours as an extended love scene, when the screen time could be better-
used elsewhere.  (Perhaps to explain the relationship between the bad
guys-- an organized army of bandits-- and the various barricaded towns
that they terrorize?) The grand vistas and hundreds of extras are some-
thing to see, I guess, even if the tone is too thick and the story makes
increasingly less sense as it goes.  (In particular, the time frame is a
tough sell.  Less than nine months for all this sweeping stuff to occur?
And did you catch the hero's pregnant girlfriend lamenting her late hus-
band as the "best man she'd ever known" and only an hour earlier
describing how he beat her?  Good grief.)  Maybe if Mr. Costner paid
more attention to the trees, he'd have a forest worth seeing.  Maybe.
