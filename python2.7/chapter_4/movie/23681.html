<PRE>Bravo "Brokovich"</PRE>
<P>"Erin Brokovich" is the kind of terrific storytelling
that does two things.  First, it renews my faith in
the good neighbor.  These are the unsung heroes that
toil endlessly on behalf of others.  Their payment
comes from the personal satisfaction of righting a
previous wrong.  They buck the system, overcome
daunting obstacles, and move forward with unbridled
determination in order to see that justice is served. 
But "Erin Brokovich" also renews my faith in
Hollywood's ability to make a nice old-fashioned film.
 Its subject is grounded in the real world and
presents a feel-good story that anyone can appreciate.
 I salute people like Erin Brokovich, and I salute the
filmmakers for having the wherewithal to bring her
story to the big screen.  Based on the real life story
of Erin Brokovich, this movie focuses on her
tribulations as a struggling single mom, and later,
her personal crusade in which she takes on a large
utilities company that she suspects of releasing toxic
pollutants.  </P>
<P>Life has truly dealt Erin, a former beauty queen, an
endless series of disappointments.  She has almost as
many ex-husbands as she does children.  With only a
high school diploma, she lacks the professional
business and communications skills to get a job.  She
can't even win an accident claim in which she was
clearly not at fault.  With the bills starting to pile
up, she convinces Ed Masry (Albert Finney), the lawyer
that bungled her aforementioned accident claim, to let
her take on a low-paying filing position.</P>
<P>Her reserved office mates, however, don't appreciate
her saucy and straight shooting personality.  She
dresses in an equally saucy manner, and as a result,
her relationship with the others is charged.  Never
afraid to speak her mind, her audacity presents a
serious challenge to the stodgy Masry.  "Maybe you
should rethink your manner of dress," he offers.  Erin
shoots back, "Maybe you should rethink your ties." 
However, the one great asset that she possesses is her
empathy towards their clients.  She feels their pain,
understands their needs, and embodies a rare
compassion.  "I hate lawyers; I just work for them,"
she says to those who are wary of her intentions. 
Additionally, she's smart, resourceful, and isn't
afraid to get her hands dirty.  </P>
<P>When she does a little extra research into a land
deal, she discovers that the activities of a nearby
utilities plant may be responsible for the failing
health of hundreds of local residents.  Erin is
devastated to learn that the long-term effects have
had horrific results, from nosebleeds to cancer.  She
is convinced that they should sue the utilities giant
on behalf of all of those who have suffered.  But
Masry, now in his 60s and comfortable with his small
practice, is naturally concerned about engaging in
such a case.  "We're not just David going against
Goliath, says the flustered lawyer.  "We're going
against Goliath and his whole family."  </P>
<P>Through Erin's hard work and devotion, there is
significant emotional payoff.  It's quite an
accomplishment for Erin to achieve what she does given
her situation and limited resources.  It's also quite
an accomplishment for Julia Roberts to capture the
heart, courage, and fears of Erin's crusade. 
Showcasing her dramatic talent and her wonderful sense
of comic timing, this is Roberts' richest role to date
and perhaps the richest female performance since
Hillary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry".  Finney is also
terrifically likable as a lawyer that tries to counter
Erin's zeal with conventionality and wisdom.  I also
credit the filmmakers for not succumbing to
Hollywood-esque plots.  In a dumber version, there
probably would have been a contrived, life-threatening
situation as Erin uncovered more damaging evidence
against the utilities.  And, I'm glad that the film
doesn't go the route of an extended courtroom
sequence.  The movie smartly stays focused on Erin's
pain, passion and personal ascension.  </P>
