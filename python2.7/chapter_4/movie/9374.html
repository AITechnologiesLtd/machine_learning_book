<PRE>WELCOME TO SARAJEVO</PRE>
<P> By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Miramax Films/Channel Four Films
 Director:  Michael Winterbottom
 Writer:  Frank Cottrell Boyce, based on "Natasha's Story" by
Michael Nicholson
 Cast: Stephen Dillane, Woody Harrelson, Marisa Tomei,
Kerry Fox, Emily Lloyd</P>
<P>   There are many ways for a film maker to deal with political
events on the international scene.  In "The Long Way
Home," Mark Jonathan Harris contributed quite a revealing
job using the documentary style to portray the plight of Jewish
refugees following World War II.  In "Peacemakers," Mimi
Leder exploits Hollywood technology to fashion a story of a
violent struggle between terrorists (the bad guys) and U.S.
authorities (good guys).  Costa-Gavras, himself an ideologue,
treats revolutionaries as freedom fighters and right-wing
governments as terrorists, as he does so forcefully in his most
celebrated film, "Z."  And in the January 1998 Miramax
release "Four Days in September," Bruno Barreto involves us
without taking sides in a fictionalized drama of the kidnapping
of the U.S. Ambassador to Brazil by anti-government
revolutionaries.</P>
<P>   Michael Winterbottom, whose directorial credits include
films as diverse as "Butterfly Kiss" (about serial killers) and
"Jude," (based on the Thomas Hardy novel), takes still
another tack with "Welcome to Sarajevo."  Basing his film on
real events much like Costa-Gavras and Harris, Winterbottom
employs Frank Cottrell Boyce's screenplay about the fighting
in Sarajevo during the early 1990s, highlighting the tragedy of
war by focusing on the plight of children orphaned by the
combat.  Training his camera principally on British journalist
Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane) who covering the war,
he uses a semi-documentary style to unfold a fictionalized
drama as seen through Henderson's eyes.  </P>
<P>   Henderson is seen interacting with his colleagues,
particularly the cynical American reporter Flynn (Woody
Harrelson), who expresses his misanthropy with rhetorical
questions to Henderson such as, "Your queen...I know she's
the richest woman in the world, but enlighten me: what does
she do?"   He shares with his English buddy a disgust for the
scant attention which the media afford to Bosnia, particularly
when he notes that the lead story in one evening's papers
deals with the separation or divorce problems of Andrew and
Fergie, the Duke and Duchess of York.</P>
<P>   Filmed on location by cinematographer Daf Hobson,
Winterbottom shows us the bombed-out buildings of a city
once considered among the world's prettiest, a place of parks
and outdoor cafes, now reduced in many areas to rubble by
fighting among ethnic factions--the Croats, the Serbs and the
Muslims.  "Welcome to Sarajevo" opens with black-and-white
scenes of hit-and-run warfare, the rooftop snipers acting as
though they were rehearsing from Jules Feiffer's prescient
play "Little Murders"--at one time considered an absurdist
comedy of people firing on the neighbors for no apparent
reason.  Though "Little Murders" gains irony by taking place in
the politically stable U.S., the subtext of "Welcome to
Sarajevo" is that the bloodletting is occurring in a "civilized"
European city, its fighters seemingly bent on self-destruction
in the name of ethnic cleansing.  The human drama of the
movie comes from an act of compassion: Henderson, a tough,
hard-drinking Pete Hamill type who loves to banter with his
American buddy about the relative merits of the UK and the
U.S., is moved to an act of compassion.  When the city's
unhappy orphans are being evacuated to other areas of
Europe such as Italy and England, he takes steps to adopt an
orphanage favorite, Emira (Emira Nusevic), though such a
step is illegal because Emira is already about eleven years
old.</P>
<P>   Winterbottom cleverly shows the mixture of altruism and
vanity in the deeds of these two journalists.  Flynn does risk
his life to save a civilian who is shot by a sniper, but he is
also propelled by his interest in getting recognition among his
readers.  As he tells Henderson, "Back home nobody's heard
of Sarajevo, but they've all heard of me."  For his part
Henderson hopes his country will afford him a solid chunk of
TV time since he is focusing sentimental stories culled from
one of the city's orphanages.  When social worker Nina
(Marisa Tomei) sets up a busload of infants to be evacuated
from Sarajevo, Henderson put into motion his plan to take
Emira with him to his family in England.</P>
<P>   Given the relative lack of interest by Americans in the
Bosnian war--which ended at least temporarily in December
1995--"Welcome to Sarajevo" makes an important addition to
the year's motion picture output.  Dramatizations can capture
the attention of millions of people far better than newsreels
and talking heads programs.  But somehow Winterbottom has
distanced us from his material.  We do not really get to know
Emira, nor do we learn much about Henderson to explain his
motivations.  Too much of the early part of the film is taken up
with a loosely structured series of scenes created to provide
us with the texture of this strange confrontation.  The idle chit-
chat and serious drinking and smoking of the journalists is by
now prosaic: we are all familiar with this stereotypical
perception of the grizzled people in the profession of war
correspondent.  </P>
<P>   Since we do not get to know much about the child, her
mother's eventual and all-too-sudden willingness to allow the
girl to stay with her new guardians in the UK does not have
the impact it should.</P>
<P>  Still, "Welcome to Sarajevo" does provide us with the feel of
the place, with the strange impulses of its combat units,
particular the Serbian officers who pull infants of their ethnic
group off the bus which is carrying them to safety: they insist
that these kids be allowed to grow up in the "Greater Serbia"
which they are creating by driving out the Muslim population.
Rated R.  Running Time: 100 minutes.  (C) 1997
