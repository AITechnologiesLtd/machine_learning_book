                               MOTHER 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                     1 :-)  for the maternal spirit</PRE>
<P>Cast: Albert Brooks, Debbie Reynolds, Rob Morrow Director: Albert Brooks
Producer: Scott Rudin and Herb Nanas Screenplay: Albert Brooks and
Monica Johnson</P>
<P>Forty, single and several failed relationships marks a mid life crisis.
The "male menopause" is no longer a myth. The years begin to show as
pockets of cellulite begin to emerge in the most unusual places; the
receding hair line and bald patch now crowns the once manly follicle
endowed head; the once energetic body slows metabolically until it is
comparably slower than the younger sex. What is there to look forward
to, when the trail left behind is littered with a long succession of
missed opportunities, and the path ahead looks like a much needed face
lift. Moody and slightly depressed, you begin to wander whether you have
achieved anything significant with your life, or will your tombstone
merely say "Here lies Jo Bloggs. He ate, He slept, then He died".</P>
<P>If feeling this way, there are several options. A friend of mine decided
he needed to discover his ancestral roots before he could reclaim his
identity. He travelled to Canada and met up with some distant relatives;
traced his heritage back to England; and discovered a war monument of an
ancestor somewhere in Australia - ironically it was a soldier who got
run down by a car before reaching battle. Anyway, somewhere along this
journey of self-discovery, he found himself again and is now happily
married with 2 children.</P>
<P>The other option, is to follow the context of this movie. Albert Brook's
thoughtful screenplay, suggests that one's problems with sex, life and
relationships are somehow related to your relationship with mother. So
his character, a divorced middle-aged man with writer's block, journeys
home in search of answers. This is an intriguing concept, but too simple
with it's solution. We are forgetting about the paternal part of the
picture, and the important role of sibling rivalry. Otherwise, Debby
Reynold's radiant portrayal as mother is a milestone in her "Golden
Years". She shows strength of character behind a fragile, docile
exterior. Rob Morrow gets to whine again post "Northern Exposure", but
this story belongs to Albert. This movie is a journey of self-discovery
for him in mid-life crisis. Here he finds reasons for why he is, and
after clearing the air with the first woman in his life, moves forward
into a brighter looking future.</P>
