<P>When a whopping five films went into wide release on August 6, industry 
pundits were unsure which ones the public would embrace. "The Iron Giant" 
was the best reviewed film of the year, but, sadly, most adults still 
consider animated movies "kid's stuff" and children rarely get juiced up 
for a flick unless they see its name plastered on a Happy Meal. "The 
Thomas Crown Affair" was glossy, sexy fun, but with the huge success of 
"Runaway Bride," it seemed a little soon for another romance to hit big. 
The political farce "Dick" and the superhero spoof "Mystery Men" both 
appeared too quirky for mainstream audiences and, in the wake of "The 
Blair Witch Project" phenomenon, little attention was paid to "The Sixth 
Sense," the "other" horror film. </P>
<P>Less than two weeks later, "The Sixth Sense" has become the first release 
since "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace" to hold the number one spot at the 
box office for more than a week, raking in $70 million in just 10 days. 
For a quiet little ghost story starring an actor best known for smirking 
between explosions in action films, this is extraordinary. So what 
exactly is the deal with "The Sixth Sense?"</P>
<P>A few minutes into the press screening of the movie, I jotted the words 
"deliberately paced" in my notebook. Mid-way through, I crossed out 
"deliberate" and replaced it with "dull." But after the striking 
conclusion of the story, I spent a long time in the lobby with a fellow 
critic, enthusiastically discussing the film. The following Saturday, at 
a nationwide sneak preview, we both went to see it again. </P>
<P>In its own way, "The Sixth Sense" is as innovative as "The Blair Witch 
Project." Writer and director M. Night Shyamalan carefully establishes a 
moody, extremely low-key tone, only to smack you upside the head when you 
least expect it. You feel compelled to watch the movie another time, to 
see how it holds up in light of the things you learned along the way. 
This is one of those rare productions that actually plays better the 
second time around.</P>
<P>It begins when a former patient (Donnie Wahlberg) breaks into the 
Philadelphia home of child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) 
and his wife, Anna (Olivia Williams). The frantic young man accuses the 
doctor of failing him, then abruptly shoots Malcolm, just before turning 
the gun on himself.</P>
<P>Cut to the following autumn. Malcolm and Anna's marriage has taken a 
drastic turn since the tragedy. Both are sullen and non-communicative, 
with Anna focusing most of her attention on her work at an antique shop 
and Malcolm focusing most of his on a new case. Eight-year-old Cole Sear 
(Haley Joel Osment) is an extremely troubled boy. His single mother Lynn 
(Toni Collette) is at a loss to understand the behavior of her son, a 
bright kid who hoards religious figurines, creates alarming drawings and 
constantly surveys his surroundings in fear. The doctor works cautiously 
with the wary child, hoping trying to establish a bond of trust. After 
many meetings, Cole finally turns to Malcolm and reveals his secret. "I 
see dead people," he whispers, desperately looking to the doctor for help.</P>
<P>That's all you need to know. If, like me, you find the proceedings overly 
slow and ponderous, hang in there, because your patience will be rewarded 
with a whale of a payoff. "The Sixth Sense" is one of the better ghost 
stories to come along in quite some time, for those willing to cooperate 
with Shyamalan's methodical presentation. </P>
<P>The director uses the Philadelphia settings well, creating a stately, 
ominous feel accented by James Newton Howard's creepy, but unobtrusive 
score. Shyamalan ends many scenes by fading to black, a stylistic move 
that seems like a slightly overdone affectation at first, but in fact 
proves essential to the story. His visualizations of the dead are less 
successful. The natural lighting is too matter-of-fact for the ghosts to 
appear authentic; instead of seeming otherworldly, they just look like 
actors in makeup.</P>
<P>His key players compensate for the unconvincing spooks. While 
"Rushmore's" Olivia Williams is given little to do and Toni Collette only 
gets a couple of scenes to display her formidable talents, Bruce Willis 
offers an appropriately restrained performance and Haley Joel Osment is 
exceptional. The young actor does fine work, nimbly projecting 
intelligence, fear and desperation without ever overdoing it.  </P>
<P>Congratulations to those who have made "The Sixth Sense" a box office 
smash. You have shown that mass audiences sometimes do choose a small, 
well-told story over standard, mega-hyped summer dreck. Now, while you're 
making such good decisions, how about giving "The Iron Giant" a chance as 
well?  </P>
