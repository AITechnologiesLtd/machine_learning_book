<P>Anaconda (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)</P>
<P>"When you can't breathe, you can't scream."  That may be true, but
when speaking in terms of the new thriller Anaconda, a more fitting tagline
would be "When you're laughing your ass off, you can't scream," for this
inane jungle adventure is nothing less than Congo '97.</P>
<P>This adventure, directed by Luis Llosa of The Specialist and Sniper
fame (or infamy, depending on how you look at it), follows a film crew
traveling down the Amazon to make a documentary on a mysterious tribe.  The
crew is a bunch of flat characters, each with only one discernible
personality trait: there's the earnest young director (Jennifer Lopez, the
only actor on board who emerges with her dignity intact); the cameraman from
the 'hood (Ice Cube); the horny sound guy (Owen Wilson); the bimbo
production manager (Kari Wuhrer); the stuffy British host (Jonathan Hyde);
the professor/love interest to the director (Eric Stoltz, wasted); and the
foreign-accented captain of the boat (Vincent Castellanos).  When they
stumble upon a mysterious stranger (Jon Voight) in a broken down boat, the
crew decides to take him on board.  Big mistake.  He's --no lie--a psychotic
former-priest-turned-snake-hunter from Paraguay, dangerously obsessed with
capturing the 40-foot anaconda snake alive--even if it means sacrificing the
film crew.</P>
<P>Now, if one is making a movie about snakes--giant, man-eating
snakes, no less--one would think that the first order of business would be
to come up with convincing snake effects.  Apparently, no one involved in
Anaconda thought hard enough.  The animatronic snakes look like giant rubber
hoses with tire treads.  Llosa also uses some "state-of-the-art" computer
animation for some shots of the snake striking and wrapping around its prey,
but the effects are obviously computer generated; the seams are quite visible.</P>
<P>The phony snakes are more than enough to ruin the film, but the true
awfulness of Anaconda doesn't stop there.  Two words--Jon Voight.  As the
nominal human villain of the piece, he is a complete embarrassment.  If his
unconvincing accent (alternately overdone and underdone) isn't bad enough,
there are his hilarious leering gazes at Lopez.  If that isn't enough, there
are his "villainous" looks, clenched teeth and eyes in full bulge, during
the physical scenes.  The rest of the cast isn't all that great, either, but
their work is downright Oscar-caliber compared to Voight's laughably
overwrought turn.</P>
<P>Anaconda can best be summed up by a line delivered midway by Lopez
without the slightest bit of irony: "This film was supposed to be my big
break, and now it's turned into a disaster."  You said it.<HR></P>
