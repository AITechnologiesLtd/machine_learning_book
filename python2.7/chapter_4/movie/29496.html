<P>   There are many reasons that a man will gamble compulsively. 
The most obvious one is that he wants to make money more
quickly than he can in the stock market.  A second possibility is
that placing high-stake bets whether in a card game or on a
sporting event gives him a rush that he simply cannot get on his
job or at home.  Psychologists, however, point out that given the
losses suffered by the large majority of such speculators, they
must have an unconscious desire to lose--because they dislike
their very reflections in the mirror and regularly fight their own
rational nature in order to inflict punishment on themselves.  This
third and most intriguing judgment forms the basis of Brian
Robbins's "Hardball," a film based on Daniel Coyle's novel with
the more pretentious name, "A Season in the Projects," adapted
for the screen by John Gatins.  "Hardball," which highlights the
acting talents of Keanu Reeves as the sort of character he was
born to play, deals with a loser, Conor O'Neill, who becomes a
winner not by going through a 12-step religious program or by
lying on the couch while a bored professional collects $125 an
hour.  He gets to like himself by losing himself in the service of
others, specifically by coaching an urban Little League team of
black kids living in a tough Chicago housing project.</P>
<P>   The most obvious statement the reasonably perceptive
moviegoer can make about the film is that it is cranked out by a
Hollywood formula team, taking no chances but rather giving the
audience what it wants--a guy who is suffering, goes through an
unorthodox rehab program, becoming a winner by converting a
group of mildly motivated kids into a victorious ball team.  You
don't have to ask whether these pre-teens will win the state
championship or whether they will receive spanking new
uniforms, courtesy of a community that takes an interest in the
underdog.  To make this sort of movie without following the
guidelines of, say, Adam Sandler's winning albeit more comedic
ways in "Waterboy," could cut into studio profits.  But darn it:
these youngsters do get to draw a tear or two from even a
cynical spectator in the movie seats even if they do not get to use
a word naughtier than "bitch" or take any action that would lose
for them the sympathy of their viewers.  Formulaic this may be,
but at least Brian Robbins is directing a work that is devoid of
misanthropy and, given recent events in New York and
Washington, this may be just what the doctor ordered.</P>
<P>   Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is down on his luck.  Owing
gambling debts to a bartender and others, he makes the usual
mistake of playing double-or-nothing, seeking to erase the
arrears in one fell swoop but succeeding only in getting himself
into deeper hot water. Seeking a loan from a friend, a broker in
an investment house, he instead gets an offer: $500 a week if he
would perform an important community service.  Though he
seems to lack a knowledge of sports given his record on the
courts, he is to coach a team of inner-city kids who regularly
fumble the ball, strike out at bat, and have little self-esteem other
than that which rubs off when taught by the attractive Elizabeth
Wilkes (Diane Lane) in a Catholic school.  The kids are
individuals, even if Conor appears to treat them for the most part
as a group: one has asthma, another is tries to play illegally with
a forged birth certificate.  They're all cute, they all listen to what
the coach says even if they more than occasionally get into fights
with one another.  Strangely enough, we never get to see any
specifics that the adult imparts to the minors short of giving them
pep talks. There's nothing about signals that the catcher should
make for the pitcher or clues about how a shortstop can better
field a line drive.</P>
<P>   The story shifts regularly from the ball field to the classroom,
spending a considerable amount of time on O'Neill's troubles as
he is harassed and beaten by his creditors, hectored by at least
one of the mothers of the kids, and taken down a peg by teacher
Elizabeth--who plays hard-to-get when Conor asks her for a date
though she obviously likes him and approves of the way he has
with the youngsters.  "Hardball," then. has balance and variety. 
One must question why the movie got an "R" rating, given the
almost schoolmarmish language of the kids and the fights which
look staged as though carried on in a live production which has
the director worrying about injuries to the performers.  In no way
does the film really play hardball, but it is at base an entertaining
and uplifting drama with adorable performances by the little-
leaguers and a surprisingly effective show by the often criticized
Keanu Reeves.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 105 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
