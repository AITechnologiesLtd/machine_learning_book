<P>Retrospective: Cleopatra's Second Husband (1998)<HR></P>
<PRE>[3.0/4.0]</PRE>
<P>In any abusive relationship, the two involved parties usually fall
into the clearly defined roles of abuser and victim. These are most
commonly associated with the abusive husband/abused wife scenario, but
aspects of these archetypes can be found in any human relationship
where one person exerts control over the other. This film is a study
of the dynamics of such a relationship.</P>
<P>The story begins with Robert Marrs (Paul Hipp) and his wife, Hallie
(Bitty Schram), leaving for a vacation. Needing someone to look after
their house while they are away, they decide to let friend-of-a-friend
Zack (Boyd Kestner) housesit, along with his girlfriend, Sophie (Radha
Mitchell). The Marrs' relationship is not outwardly fragile, but it
has grown strained, exacerbated by the couple's inability to conceive
a child.</P>
<P>Upon returning early from the vacation, Robert and Hallie discover
that although the house has been adequately taken care of, their
guests have not been completely conscientious. For example, the
tropical fish have died from lack of care. Although Robert wants to
get rid of Zack and Sophie, Hallie is more forgiving, and she is
sympathetic to their inability to find a place to live (they have just
moved to the area), so she invites them to stay with them temporarily.
She quickly regrets the decision as their intrusions provide the
catalyst that deteriorates her relationship with Robert. When Hallie
leaves, Robert allows Zack and Sophie to remain. Eventually, the
relationship between Robert and Zack slowly evolves into victim and
abuser, respectively. The decay is slow, and by the time that Zack
realizes what has happened, he has no power to change the
relationship.</P>
<P>The story is necessarily disturbing, as the viewer helplessly watches
Robert slowly sink into the morass of Zach's manipulative personality.
By intentionally adopting a pace that is slow and a mood that is dark,
the film incarcerates the viewer in Robert's shrinking world. Robert
would not have chosen to enter the psychological prison that his
relationship with Zach becomes, but he is oblivious to the slow
progression.</P>
<P>The acting performances must be noted for their skillful execution.
The role of Zach required Kestner to expose the personality of the
character over time, and he adeptly executes this without allowing
Zach to balloon into a caricature. The role of Robert entails very
subtle challenges. Hipp needed to communicate the laconic Robert's
reasons for entering the relationship with Zach. With the exception of
the garrulous Hallie, the characters are expressed in an atmosphere of
minimal dialog. Without the benefit of having the characters verbally
express their inner thoughts, the actors need to have them
communicated through physical expression. This also indicates that
writer and director Jon Reiss was willing to work hard to express the
story without taking convenient shortcuts. Add in the fact that Reiss
needed to have the audience relate to characters that are not
particularly likeable, and it is clear that the film was carefully
constructed and proficiently executed.</P>
<P>The meaning of the title is not apparent in the film's story, and one
must credit the director for not spoonfeeding it to the viewers. It is
a reference to the relationship between Cleopatra and Marc Anthony in
the 1963 Hollywood film production Cleopatra.</P>
<P>Recommended. The film is a noir psychological thriller. It is engaging
enough to keep viewers involved in the slow progression of the story.
The depiction of degradation in the abusive relationship is
disturbing, but because of director Jon Reiss' focus, they do not feel
licentious.</P>
