<PRE>                                  TURN IT UP
                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp

<P>How would you like to be elected king for a day?  The enormously
talented Ice Cube paved the way for chart-topping rap stars to become
media moguls, running his own music and film production company.  His
explosive talent and shrewd business sense made his success look easy. 
Wow!  Anyone can do this!  The market soon became flooded with rap
artists vying for movie stardom, not to mention creative control.  Most
of the stories revolve around familiar "urban gangsta" elements such as
tough-talking badasses with flashy threads, fast cars, nickel-plated
revolvers and beautiful hoochie-mamas.  In sum, well-photographed vanity
projects that make the stars feel cool.</P>
<P>Case in point: international sensation Pras co-produced and stars in
Turn It Up.  It's about, what else, a young man's struggle to escape his
life of crime.  Redemption is the order of the day.  Diamond (Pras) is a
talented hip-hop performer who harbors big dreams of cutting his own
record, but can't afford the inflated costs of studio time.  His
mercurial loose cannon of a best friend, Gage (Billboard chart-topper Ja
Rule), wants to lend a helping hand, stealing $10,000 from an ill-fated
drug runner.  Unfortunately, the money financing Diamond's career
belongs to a vicious British gangster (Jason Stratham, Snatch, good even
when he's coasting) who suddenly takes an interest in stealing the
rights to Diamond's record.  Things sure are heating up around here.</P>
<P>Just in case we get bored with itemized record deal negotiations, there
are a few back alley drug deals that go sour.  Ha!  Are there any other
kind?  Messrs. Pras and Rule are given ample opportunity to pop off
several rounds of ammo in dramatic slow motion.  John Woo's
"two-guns-at-once" are combined with Quentin Tarantino's
"point-the-gun-diagonally," since those techniques seemed to work well
in other, better films.  There's plenty of shattering glass -- can't
have a shootout without some shattering glass!  The rhythm and pacing
resemble a lazy and inconsiderate lover, unimaginatively going through
the motions.</P>
<P>Lest all this gunplay reinforce a negative image of the black community,
there's an after-school special subplot involving Diamond's girlfriend
(Tamala Jones).  She's pregnant.  Will Diamond accept the responsibility
of being a father, or choose to pursue his music career?  On cue, his
long-lost pop (Vondie Curtis-Hall, Eve's Bayou) shows up with sage
advice: Do the right thing, son.</P>
<P>During the dramatic "brother's keeper" scenes between Pras and Ja Rule,
Manhattan's skyline looms in the distance.  It's all about having a
spectacular background, no?  The two leads carry on with self-conscious
intensity, performing as expected.  They can't act, but they have
charisma to burn with obligatory thousand yard stares and solemn
affirmations of loyalty and respect.  These rap sensations only come
alive during their one live performance midway through Turn It Up,
finally living up to the title as they bust their moves in a club (or is
it an abandoned aircraft hangar -- all the better for a tie-in music
video).</P>
<P>Turn It Up isn't a bad film, content to be merely sluggish and generic. 
Projects like this don't feel scripted -- they're packaged, complete
with a hot soundtrack.  I'll bet it made for a swell looking deal memo. 
If anything is to be learned from Ice Cube's success, it is not that rap
stars make bankable pictures.  Cube brought his own distinct, original
voice to Friday and The Player's Club, stories only indirectly related
to the hood.  He has an ear for vivid dialogue and seems carefully
selective of his cast and crew.  To date, he's been the only filmmaker
smart enough to place the explosive comic Bernie Mac (The Original Kings
of Comedy) in a lead role.</P>
<P>Audiences have responded to Ice Cube's material over his contemporaries
because he takes calculated risks.  The result is something fresh and
new, and the masses thrive on fresh and new when the studios quake in
fear at the thought of pushing the envelope.  (Even when those films
make tons of money -- I cite The Matrix and The Silence of the Lambs as
world heavyweight champions of this theory.)  Turn It Up never aspires
to be more than an excuse for Pras and Ja Rule to flash their
ultra-sleek MTV fashions for 90 minutes.  With trends seemingly changing
every week, the public is fickle.  It's a safe bet there's another urban
hip-hop drama being hustled through production even as you read this
review.  Watch out, Pras - your 15 minutes are almost up.</P>
