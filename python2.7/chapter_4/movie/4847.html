PG-13.</P>
<P>Hereafter this uncatchily titled movie will be referred to as 
UCAP, which sounds like another University of California 
campus yet. There is nothing academic about the movie though, 
except for the academic response by those who persist in 
connecting the film to "A Star Is Born" or ASIB. In this, they 
have been influenced by the fact that Joan Didion  and husband 
John Gregory Dunne (novelists, non-fiction writers, 
screenwriters), had also penned the third version  (1976, with 
Barbra Streisand) of ASIB -- the fourth, if you include  "What 
Price Hollywood" (1932), the root-film. (Be it said in passing 
that the 1976 film was far inferior to all its predecessors).</P>
<P>In the earlier movies, a male celebrity brings fame and 
fortune to an aspiring younger woman. As her star rises, his 
falls. In ASIB 1 and 2, the man is a Hollywood star named 
Norman Maine. He sinks into alcoholism and commits suicide, 
upon which, his widow Vicki Lester (nee Esther Blodgett) 
addressing the public, starts with the famous: "This is Mrs. 
Norman Maine." </P>
<P>There is really very little of ASIB in UCAP. Here,Sallyanne 
Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) is an untutored nobody from 
Nevada. Determined to make her way into TV, she fakes her 
credentials,does not fool Warren Justice (Robert Redford),the 
news director of a Miami station, yet still gets hired as an 
assistant.</P>
<P>The movie opens like a sitcom, with Sally's silly string of 
little accidents. It also telegraphs immediately the 
inevitable love affair.Indeed, the very names Pfeiffer and 
Redford do this, even if you haven't seen the film or heard of 
it. To its credit, unlike the zillion flicks that set up 
antagonism-that-will-turn-to-amore, the relationship of the 
couple is cool, un-strident and quite harmonious.</P>
<P>To make a long story short (TMLSS), ambitious Sally gets her 
chance, muffs it, but Warren dismisses this, hyperbolically 
declaring that "she eats the lens" (don't try this at home). 
He grooms, protects, molds Sally, rebaptized Tally. She 
becomes, with peculiar swiftness and no obvious reason (except 
her looks), a star. </P>
<P>The other side of the coin is that Warren, a bastion of 
journalistic integrity, won't play footsie with 
TV-exploitation and will find his star waning. (It had 
happened to him before, but never mind). </P>
<P>There's a bunch of colorful happenings in the depiction of TV 
station life: professional rivalries, banter, competitiveness. 
These may not be authentic, but, as Hitchcock used to say, 
it's only a movie. Most of the shenanigans are interesting, 
some of the gags and the like fall a bit flat. You can tell 
which  those are by listening the the audience: it laughs 
louder. </P>
<P>By minute 40 there is a loss of momentum, especially with an 
interlude where Tally goes to Reno to rescue her sister and  
Warren  surprisingly shows up and lends a hand. Unconvincing.</P>
<P>Sex comes in at minute 54, right after Tally gets an offer to 
move to another, bigger affiliate, in  Philadelphia. Pleasant 
romantic stuff, but did writers Didion and Dunne have to 
include the inevitable cliche of the couple having fun on the 
beach to the off-screen sounds and soupy lyrics of a love 
song?  Mercifully,this second interlude is brief.</P>
<P>Tally goes to Philly, has to put up with the barbs of older 
anchorwoman Stockard Channing (as always, very good) who sees 
the handwriting on the wall, meaning that Tally will probably 
replace her. Tally does well, but has some troubles. Warren to 
the rescue. They also marry. </P>
<P>Warren is out of a job but manages to remote-control Tally, 
stuck inside a rioting prison, into doing a great telecast. (I 
don't see what's great about it, but never mind). Her star 
skyrockets and she's offered to anchor (for weekends only) at 
the network. Oh, bliss. Further developments will not be 
disclosed.</P>
<P>The film, genuinely or not, is well fleshed out with the 
hectic, frantic atmosphere of big-time TV. Above all, there's 
that couple that drips charisma. That Pfeiffer is almost 40 
and Redford almost 60 makes no difference. Her beauty, in the 
small group of a Loretta Young or a Pamela Kohn, is buttressed 
by charm. His oxymoronic laid-back intensity is a joy. The 
electricity is good. And it is not Redford's fault that 
Didion-Dunne dreamed up the silly, in-joke name of Warren 
Justice (Chief Justice Earl Warren, get it?). </P>
<P>Director Avnet directs well, but, keen as he reportedly is for 
every shot to be perfect, he sometimes neglects the cartilage 
between shots,the editing. </P>
<P>The movie, at some point, was to be based on the short unhappy 
life of the late TV news-star Jessica Savitch. Happily, 
there's nothing of that left in the final script, which is a 
hybrid of older movies.  </P>
<P>It's no "Network," no "Broadcast News" in depth or intensity, 
no "China Syndrome" in suspense. It is no "Switching Channels" 
(the undervalued remake of "The Front Page" and "His Girl 
Friday" shifted from press to TV) in comedy. UCAP is more skin 
than nerves, yet a good pastime and no rip-off of your time 
and money. </P>
