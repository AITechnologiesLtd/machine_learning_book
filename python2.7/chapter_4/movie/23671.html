<P>`Drowning Mona', an oddball black comedy cocooned inside of a murder
mystery, is the second star-laden comedy feature to be released this
week. The first was `What Planet Are You From?', a ribald alien sex
farce with Garry Shandling and a barrel of humming genitalia jokes. Both
movies fail to reach the initial promise indicated by their hilarious
cast and premise, but one of those two components still buoys the bubbly
`Drowning Mona' to a docile altitude that makes it difficult to dislike.</P>
<P>First off, let's discuss the premise. A `horrible tragedy' has
blindsided the denizens of Verplanck, New York - a small town labeled as
the `Yugo capital of the world'. Mona Dearly (Bette Midler), possibly
the most reprehensible woman to ever live, has driven her Yugo off a
cliffside and drowned in the Hudson River. Upon closer inspection, it
appears that Mona's brake-line was tampered with and her fateful plunge
into the water was no accidental incident. But everyone in town is a
suspect, because even Mona's closest relatives thought she was a
miserable wench.</P>
<P>I know. It sounds pretty grim. But then there's the real fundamental
element of `Drowning Mona': the cast, which foams relentlessly with
comic talent and adds a cheery loft of innocent gullibility to the shady
proceedings. Police Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito) and daughter Ellen
(Neve Campbell) are among the only mentally competent residents in town
- save for Ellen's sweety-pie fiancee Bobby Calzone (Casey Affleck).
William Fichtner (`Go') is Mona's careless husband Phil, who is having a
secretive affair with Rona the waitress (Jamie Lee Curtis), while
one-handed son Jeff (newcomer Marcus Thomas) ceaselessly pesters Bobby
about their mutual landscaping business. Rounding out the cast of
blithering idiots are Deputy Feege (Peter Dobson) and Cubby (Will
Ferrell), the sex-crazed funeral director. While you may believe the
film has its bearings set on a scathing black comedy, the strangely
innocent appeal of the multi-talented cast dilutes the darkened formula
while emitting a sunny charm. Resistance of succumbing to the saccharine
sweetness of `Drowning Mona' is futile.</P>
<P>There is plenty of frustration and lost chances afoot as well. As
written by Peter Steinfeld, `Drowning Mona' has its share of lame,
unfunny comic tedium. There's even a scene in which we are intended to
feel sympathy for the Mona, which generates an awkward and cumbersome
sensation of guilt for the viewer. Steinfeld's script could have
certainly used some `There's Something About Mary'-esque edge and a dash
more of maniacal energy, but the film still has its moments. Like air
pockets of hilarity across a deserted terrain, these wry little
instances of clever humor maintain the giddy playfulness of `Drowning
Mona'. It wasn't funny half the time, but I was still chuckling
throughout. Just pin this guilty pleasure on the diverse cast, who -
from the outrageously brash Midler to the jubilantly nonchalant Fichtner
- are white trash in top-form.</P>
<P>Director Nick Gomez shoots the film much like a smaller, independent
feature - not surprising, given that is his regular field. This approach
is effective, although it lacks the pizzazz to carry a comic ensemble
piece of this caliber overall. Another saving grace is Steinfeld's use
of well-distributed punchlines. For instance, when the police have just
informed Jeff that his mother has driven off a cliff while driving his
car, his immediate response is `What was she doing with my car?' In a
zany, off-kilter sort of way, this type of subtle lunacy is what keeps
the leaky foundation of `Drowning Mona' afloat. It's not the intriguing
murder-mystery portion or the zestful tidbits of black comedy... the
charming little touches help thread this film together. It's interesting
that, in the midst of a puzzling homicide and other gruesome
developments, all you can remember is that a character uses `Wheel of
Fortune' as foreplay, and another puts ketchup on pickles. That's
`Drowning Mona' for you.</P>
