Susan Granger's review of "HIGH ART" (October Films)</PRE>
<P>Writer/director Lisa Cholodenko gives far more emphasis to getting
 high than to expressing art with this pretentious, downbeat dirge
about lesbian love. Flimsily cloaked in an "All About Eve"-like
scenario, the story revolves around a lowly, but ambitious young New
York art magazine editor (Australian actress Radha Mitchell) who
"discovers" a rebellious but talented photographer living in the
apartment upstairs. A heroin-snorting, Jewish Bohemian, she "dropped
out" of the art scene several years earlier to live in
disillusioned, drug-addled decadence with her groggy German
actress/lover (Patricia Clarkson) when the pressures of "fame" got
tooheavy. In this pivotal leading role, Ally Sheedy - once an
ingenue "Breakfast Club" member of Hollywood's Brat Pack - is
ghastly thin and neurotically intense, even ferocious. Predictably,
the relationship between the self-destructive artist and the naive
opportunist sparks, ignites, and eventually fizzles but, since all
the women involved are so spaced-out, it's hard for the audience to
connect with any of them. Nevertheless, for a first-time film-maker,
Lisa Chodolenko shows promise, particularly in herhip, witty jibes
about the "business" of producing art. If she could leave the murky,
rotten drug scene behind, she'd show her story-telling skills more
admirably. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "High Art" is a
tiresome 3. Watching lethargic, unhappy women take drugs and
incoherently talk nonsense is hardly classified as entertainment.</P>
