<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>There's always a certain appeal to a movie which brings together a group
of favorite actors. Regardless of the quality of the plot, the direction,
or whatever, there's an undeniable charm to watching stars of the screen
interact -- and the more, the merrier. A lot of it, I suppose, stems from
sheer fanboyishness (or fangirlishness, as appropriate). It's the same
spirit that makes us laugh with glee at, say, the "Stalag 17" references
in "Chicken Run". But it's also an acknowledgment of the class and skill
these actors bring to their profession, and of the enormous potential that
their banding together seems to promise.</P>
<P>"Space Cowboys" is this kind of movie, its big gimmick being the union of
several of Hollywood's top retirement-age actors. Headlining the film are
Clint Eastwood (70 years old), James Garner (72), Donald Sutherland (65)
and Tommy Lee Jones (still practically a baby at 53), joined by James
Cromwell (60) and William Devane (59). Eastwood plays Frank Corvin, former
member of Team Daedalus, a group of Air Force pilots who, in the 1950s,
were designated as the first men to fly into space. Then NASA was formed
and claimed the space program for itself, and Team Daedalus was
permanently grounded. Forty years later, a Russian satellite malfunctions
and slowly begins to plunge Earthward. The guidance system on board is so
old that none of NASA's current crop of engineers can understand it, let
alone construct software to interact with it, so project engineer Sarah
Holland (Marcia Gay Harden) turns to its designer -- Frank -- for
assistance.</P>
<P>Frank will help NASA on one condition: that he and the rest of Team
Daedalus be on board the space shuttle sent into orbit to repair the
ailing satellite. Grudgingly, Sarah's boss Bob Gerson (Cromwell) -- an old
nemesis of Frank's -- agrees to the scheme ("You sent up Glenn!" argues
Corvin). So Frank begins tracking down his former mates, including "Tank"
Sullivan (Garner), now a fumbling Baptist minister; Jerry O'Nell 
(Sutherland), a roller coaster designer with inch-thick glasses; and
"Hawk" Hawkins (Jones), whom Frank blames for the dissolution of Team
Daedalus. But in order to succeed at their mission, the oldtimers must
confront ageism on the ground and, worse, a deadly Russian secret awaiting
them in space.</P>
<P>What "Space Cowboys" does right, most of all, is that it collects together
a group of actors who know what they're doing. Eastwood, Jones, Garner and
Sutherland have starred in their share of classics, and they have more
than a few duds between them as well. But they're all classy veterans, 
entertaining to watch regardless of the situation. There is a nice
chemistry between them which overcomes the relative paucity of their
actual characters. Indeed, more thought seems to have been given to Team
Daedalus as a group than to each of the individual members, who are 
painted only in broad strokes. Sutherland is the ladies' man. Jones is
the wise guy. Eastwood is... well, Clint Eastwood, basically. They are fun
to watch, certainly, but there's not a lot of meat on their old bones,
metaphorically speaking.</P>
<P>This lack of characterisation extends to the supporting cast as well.
Particularly poor is Loren Dean, who plays astronaut Ethan Vance as though
he's a high school jock rather than a professional scientist ("I have two
Masters degrees!" he squeals at one point). Vance and Cromwell's Gerson
exist purely as opponents for the Daedalus crew; they are defined only in
relation to how they complicate the heroes' lives. There is little 
motivation to their actions, and as a result -- when the rather 
predictable truth about the Russian satellite is revealed -- they come off
looking pretty inept. Harden, meanwhile, is strong in her early scenes,
but is mostly pushed toward the background in the second half. Her romance
with Jones' character feels contrived and lacks chemistry, seemingly
inserted only because the movie would otherwise lack a romantic subplot.</P>
<P>The screenplay, by Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner, starts off well enough
while the astronauts are still on the ground. Certainly, there are plenty
of laughs -- witness Jones taking a dim-witted teenager for a wild
airplane ride, for example. But the going is slow, and the whole thing 
plays out all too convenient. For instance, the oldtimers overcome a plot
by Gerson to keep them on the ground not through any action of their own,
but instead thanks to the fortuitous presence of a press photographer.</P>
<P>Things get both better and worse once the action finally moves into space.
Better, because we get to witness some beautiful special effects shots of
the astronauts in space. Perhaps inspired in part by "2001", these are
quiet and majestic; the scene where Frank spins around to watch the Earth
revolving beneath him is simply gorgeous. This is one case where the
movie's lackadaisical pacing is to its advantage. There is a real
sensation of the weightlessness and absolute silence of deep space.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the plot also becomes even more of a routine,
by-the-numbers exercise, coming across like a sort of dumbed-down "Apollo
13" (I was tempted to say "Armageddon", but nothing could be that dumb).
The ending is dull and cliched. There is no effort to provide a clever or
insightful conclusion to the character arc of the Daedalus teammembers;
instead, we just get another climax where it's up to the underdogs to save
the day.</P>
<P>Ultimately, "Space Cowboys" relies too much on the hook of seeing all 
these venerable actors together, as opposed to good old-fashioned 
storytelling and characterisation. Matters are not helped by director
Eastwood's pacing, which is more geriatric than the picture's stars. It
has its moments -- the middle third of the film is particularly delightful
-- and certainly exudes more charm in its first twenty minutes than in the
entire running time of most of today's teen flicks. But, like those early
efforts to reach Earth's orbit, "Space Cowboys" just never builds enough
momentum to work.</P>
