<P>     By the 1990s, the movie musical has become a dead art form.  The 
three recent revival attempts have been failures.  The first two, 
NEWSIES and SARAFINA, went to video after approximately one-week 
theatrical runs (even the Disney name couldn't save the former).  The 
third, I'LL DO ANYTHING, was transformed into a songless dramatic comedy 
following disastrous test screenings.  Since then, no one has attempted 
a non-animated, big screen musical (EVITA is coming, but I'll reserve 
judgment until I see Madonna in the title role).  So, for those of us 
who appreciate the genre, the best place to look is the past.</P>
<P>     THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG was initially released in 1964, and, 
amongst other things, helped catapult Catherine Deneuve to stardom.  In 
filming THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG, director Jacques Demy opted to 
sacrifice print longevity for vibrant color.  The stock he used yielded 
brilliant hues, but degraded quickly.  By the mid-seventies, the only 
remaining copies of the film were in terrible condition.  But Demy, 
anticipating this problem from the outset, had archived multiple 
monochromatic negatives that, when properly combined with each other, 
allowed re-creation of the original color.  With Demy's widow, Agnes 
Varda, supervising the re-mastering, THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG was 
recently brought back to life, and is now available in its previous 
splendor.</P>
<P>     As a musical, THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG is unusual in several 
ways.  First, unlike most big American productions of the time, there 
are no show-stopping production numbers.  There's no dancing, no chorus, 
and no duets.  Secondly, there are no spoken lines of dialogue -- 
everything, from the mundane to the important, is sung.  Finally, THE 
UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG isn't a lightweight bon-bon with a happily-ever-
after ending.  While the film has its share of effervescent moments, 
there's also an element of undeniable poignancy.</P>
<P>     The two main characters, 17-year old Genevieve (Deneuve) and 20-
year old Guy (Nino Castelnuovo), are star-crossed lovers.  Despite the 
stringent objections of Genevieve's mother (Anne Vernon), who thinks a 
gas station mechanic is beneath her daughter, the two continue their 
clandestine meetings, and eventually consummate their relationship.  
Soon after, Guy has to serve a stint away from France in the army.  
Following his departure, Genevieve learns that she is pregnant, and must 
decided whether to wait for Guy's uncertain return or marry the rich, 
cultured Roland Cassard (Marc Michel), who offers stability, undying 
love, and the promise of raising her child as his own.  Genevieve's 
choice irrevocably alters the lives of at least four people.</P>
<P>     Watching THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG, it's not hard to understand 
why Deneuve became such an icon.  Not only is she beautiful, but she 
possesses that elusive characteristic known simply as "star quality".  
She's the perfect lead for this film, which demands an actress 
possessing legitimate range.  Demy has used the musical to explore 
several universal themes, particularly the meaning and nature of 
different kinds of love.  Although most movies favor passion and true 
love, THE UMBRELLAS shows that another less demanding, more subtle kind 
of love has its own appeal.  </P>
<P>     Agnes Varda's reconstruction has done the film justice.  The 
colors, which include bright pinks, reds, purples, and oranges, look 
great, and the cleaned-up soundtrack is better than ever.  Although, as 
I said before, THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG lacks song-and-dance numbers, 
there is one tune that recurs throughout.  This song, beautifully 
composed by Michel Legrand, radiates longing and loss, and forms the 
movie's core.  It, like the film, is far more powerful than one would 
initially suppose.</P>
