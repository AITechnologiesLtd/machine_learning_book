<PRE>HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH
A film review by Rachel Gordon
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Following the success of Hedwig and the Angry Inch Off-Broadway and in
other major cities comes this colorfully energetic filmed adaptation. 
Written, directed by, and starring the original, ever-talented John
Cameron Mitchell, Hedwig delivers the guilty pleasure of entertainment
through another's pain.</P>
<P>The brassy title derives from the fact that Hedwig, born Hansel,
underwent an unsuccessful sex change operation when marrying an officer
to flee an oppressive, still-halved Berlin.  His childhood isn't a
pretty picture, so it's easy enough to imagine the desperation strong
enough to drive him towards accepting the drastic change.  Hansel
wouldn't have had a problem adapting to womanhood as he considered
himself a "girly boy" anyway, but with a one-inch penis and no breasts,
his difficulties increase.</P>
<P>Once in America, Hedwig's husband leaves him for another boy.  Hedwig
gets by with odd jobs and finds solace in American music.  Inspired by
artists like David Bowie, heard over American Forces Radio while in
Germany, Hedwig joins up with a band and writes songs based on his life.</P>
<P>Now it's arguable that someone bitching about their dysfunctional life
for an hour and a half could be depressing, boring, or otherwise not
worth the bother.  But Hedwig is such a charismatic protagonist that
this is never an issue.  He's high maintenance for anyone in his circle,
and even cruel to those most patient with him.  On the flipside, he's
full of contagious humor and self-sacrifice for his passion, be it
people or music.  He has an admirable presence whenever he walks in a
room, and it's not just because he's in drag.</P>
<P>Sadly, the film lacks some of the emotional intimacy that occurs when
watching a live performance.  Instead of all the musical numbers
occurring over one evening's performance, Hedwig's gigs are spread out
through different dives.  Each stop is carefully planned to follow the
more popular Tommy Gnossis, Hedwig's ex-lover/now-enemy.  This only gets
monotonous when each audience, excepting the last, have the same drawn,
scared look on their faces as Hedwig belts out his unfortunate life
story.</P>
<P>The story takes great advantage of the film medium by using animated
fantasy images to convey Hedwig's ultimate purpose to find his other
half.  Flashbacks, normally used in films as easy exposition, give the
circumstances of Hedwig's life more weight.  It is far more spellbinding
to actually see Hansel fall for the officer, and Hedwig's early
connection with Tommy, than it is to simply hear about it from painted
lips.</P>
<P>Another accomplishment is the film's ability to combine music and a
dramatic story on screen.  Usually when someone bursts into song in a
film, an audience will cower in a corner to cover their ears and watch
for facial muscles to relax.  But because music is Hedwig's life, and
therapy, it is just as pertinent to the story as his daily life and
flashbacks.  And because the music varies in tempo and lyrical style, it
compliments Hedwig's rocky journey.</P>
<P>For a hard knocks story, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is an enjoyable
ride.  You'll either sit back and say "At least my life is better than
that," or simply be amazed at how good a musical movie about a
half-woman, half-man can be.</P>
