<PRE>WHAT WOMEN WANT
A film review by Norm Schrager

<P>If you looked like Mel Gibson, being able to read women's minds wouldn't
be too imperative.  Just give 'em those baby blues and flash those
pearly whites, and you're in, baby.  Or so you'd think.  In What Women
Want, directed by relationship comedy veteran Nancy Meyers, Gibson's
character gets the real scoop on what the fairer sex thinks about him,
and boy, is he in trouble.  But his problems are the viewer's fortune.</P>
<P>As all-star Chicago ad man Nick Marshall, Gibson is awash in the
stereotypical world of a man's man.  Ogling chicks, living high on the
hog, and being a major player is his life.  He has unending
self-confidence just because he can bed babes, but ho, what he doesn't
know....</P>
<P>See, Nick's not too receptive to women when they, well, speak, and he's
not beneath ordering them around either.  Enter Darcy Maguire (Helen
Hunt), a young hottie hired as Nick's boss, who gets the job that he's
been eyeing.  Fifteen years ago, that alone would've been good movie
fodder (as in Nine to Five and Working Girl), but here the idea's been
amped up.</P>
<P>While drunk and stupid, Nick tries on various women's products in order
to get into ladies' minds and maybe impress the boss with a new idea. 
One freaky electrical accident later, and Nick discovers he can actually
steal the boss' ideas -- straight from her own thoughts.  If women think
it, Nick hears it.</P>
<P>It's about as high concept as today's comedies get, and guided by
Meyers' fine-tuned hand, it really works (she wrote Protocol and Baby
Boom, and wrote/directed the satisfying update of The Parent Trap). 
Meyers, working from an impressive debut script by King of Queens
writers Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, showcases the obvious advantages
and pitfalls of such an insane power, and lets Gibson show off the
superstar gloss that nearly defines him.  But the major plus is the
film's big-time, old-school Hollywood feel, from the directing to the
costumes to the set design. </P>
<P>In throwback style, Nick's not just a sexist -- he's a stinkin' male
chauvinist pig.  And he's not wealthy -- he's filthy rich.  He moves
like a movie star, thinks on his feet, and calls women "babe."  With his
swagger and good looks, and Alan Silvestri's big-band-baby music behind
him, Gibson's Nick recalls a big businessman that may have been played
by Clark Gable.  And his goofy way with women once he obtains his powers
feels like an old Preston Sturges or Frank Capra movie.  (I'm guessing
Meyers was going for that; You Can't Take It With You is the play at
Nick's daughter's school.)</P>
<P>There are some scenes that Meyers really should've chopped -- such as an
inexcusable MTVesque montage of Nick helping his kid (Ashley Johnson)
pick out a prom dress -- but in all, the scenes stay funny and even pack
a few surprises.</P>
<P>Gibson hams it up a little too much for my taste, but the fun he has as
Nick is infectious.  Helen Hunt is, well, The Helen Hunt Character, but
she remains a competent actor that can make good things happen on
screen.  Alan Alda is a solid co-star as Nick and Darcy's boss, and
Marisa Tomei is excellent as a neurotic coffee slinger pining for
companionship.  With her range and abilities, I wish she had been given
the role of Darcy.</P>
<P>But when Darcy and Nick do connect (c'mon, of course they do!), Meyers
successfully holds on to that old-style feel.  One simple rendezvous
carries a sweet, romantic wistfulness within the perfect backdrop of a
small booth at an elegant jazz club.  Bogey would've loved it.  Meyers
has done more than just pay homage to the old Hollywood romantic comedy
-- it would appear that she has actually made one.</P>
