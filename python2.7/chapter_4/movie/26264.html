<P>Some people, no matter what they look like or who they are, have the 
incessant urge to always succeed, whatever the cost. Such is the case with 
26-year-old Mona Hibbard (Minnie Driver), who has been practicing for the 
Miss American Miss pageant ever since she was 8. With her pretty, but 
unconventional looks, she has rarely won any of the contests she has entered, 
even going as far as sabotaging other contestants' routines simply to give 
her a better chance at winning. Growing up in a lower-class household with a 
white-trash mother and no-good stepfather, Mona hasn't exactly gotten the 
love that she has wanted, but who could blame the people around her when she 
is such a self-centered person herself?</P>
<P>At 19, Mona had a child out of wedlock, and instead of caring for her 
daughter, Vanessa (played at age 7 by Hallie Kate Eisenberg), her best friend 
Ruby (Joey Lauren Adams) has taken over as surrogate mother, unbeknownst to 
most people. The resemblance between Mona and Vanessa is uncanny to many, but 
they manage to brush such things off, as Mona remains to her daughter simply 
her "mother's" obnoxious best friend.</P>
<P>After winning Miss Illinois at the state competition, Mona finally has come 
thisclose to fulfilling her dream, being eligible for the Miss American Miss 
pageant. But then an unforeseen event strikes, and Mona, somewhat of a child 
herself, finds herself having to take care of Vanessa by herself, including 
taking her to the competition, despite mothers not being allowed to be 
runners in the contest.</P>
<P>"Beautiful," the feature film directorial debut of Sally Field, is, like Mona 
Hibbard, an unconventional comedy-drama that is surprisingly biting in its 
treatment of the central character, who is often distasteful and conceited. 
In an average film on the same subject, Mona would be presented as far more 
sympathetic just so she could be more likable for mainstream audiences, but 
director Field and screenwriter Jon Bernstein hold nothing back in showing 
how reprehensible someone can be simply to achieve a decidedly petty goal. </P>
<P>As Mona, the talented Minnie Driver (2000's "Return to Me") perfectly creates 
this person who is unknowingly a monster on the outside, a side effect of 
never experiencing love and compassion before in her own family. Mona is not 
always likable, but there are very few actresses who could aid as a bridge 
between such a difficult character and the viewer, and Driver is luckily one 
of them. Moreover, as the film progresses and she begins to experience what 
she has missed by having her sights set on only one thing, Mona gradually 
does become more compassionate, and the catharsis she finally has is 
effectively done in the climax.</P>
<P>Best known as the Pepsi girl who imitates the likes of Aretha Franklin and 
Ray Charles, young Hallie Kate Eisenberg (1999's "Bicentennial Man") is very 
good and thankfully not unctuous as the strong-willed, confused Vanessa, who 
Mona discovers possesses many of the same traits she did as a child. 
Eisenberg and Driver work well together, and the familial relation between 
the two is believable. Meanwhile, Joey Lauren Adams (1997's "Chasing Amy") is 
her usual impressive self, even when her character's motivations are a little 
fuzzy and you unavoidably question why she would stay friends with someone 
like Mona for all these years.</P>
<P>In supporting roles, Leslie Stefanson (1999's "The General's Daughter"), 
while doing a professional job, is more of an annoyance than an interesting 
character, as a news reporter out to expose the many unwholesome things Mona 
has done over the years. Kathleen Turner is even more wasted as beauty 
pageant expert Verna Chickles, and it is unfortunate to see her return to 
such a throwaway role after her wonderful work in this year's best film (so 
far), "The Virgin Suicides." As fellow Miss American Miss contestants, both 
Bridgette L. Wilson (1999's "House on Haunted Hill," but when did she start 
getting credited with the middle initial?) and Kathleen Robertson (1999's 
"Splendor") are surprisingly memorable, as a poignant twist in the story's 
conclusion exposes both of them as being exactly like Mona, something she 
herself fears.</P>
<P>Along with some extremely funny moments and the occasional insightful 
character moments, "Beautiful" is an entertaining, if flawed, motion picture 
all the way up until the disastrous final five minutes, which turn up the 
self-appreciation and cheeseball meters so high that it becomes sickening. 
The sudden shift in tones in that last stretch of running time is both 
jarringly and seemingly out of another movie altogether, and it largely 
undermines the integrity of the film as a whole. "Beautiful" is the type of 
movie whose basics have been traveled many times before, but it is done well 
for the most part. Its successfulness in the first 105 minutes only makes its 
stay of execution in the finale all the more depressing.</P>
