<P>Filled with the worst kind of popular tripe, 'Never Been Kissed' is the
ultimate focus group movie.  Every detail of the film's script, and other
(for lack of a better term) academics have been scrutinized and marketed to
an audience where only one core group, high school senior girls, will
appreciate it.  The film's wardrobe, high school atmosphere, teenage and
teacher stereotypes as well as a totally unbelievable story make this movie
more than a waste of time and that is an understatement.  It runs 110
minutes but feels more like two and a half hours.</P>
<P>Drew Barrymore plays Josie Geller, a 25 year old copy editor at the Chicago
Sun Times (I wonder what Roger Ebert will think of this movie), who goes
undercover as a 17 year old to do a story of high school life in 1999.  But
there is much more to the plot than that.  Josie is a virgin and has never
been kissed.  She was ridiculed throughout her time in high school by class
mates who played cruel and unusual jokes on her.  In those days, she wore
her hair like a cave woman, had braces on her teeth and wore baggy overall
dresses.  Even her supposed date for the high school prom showed up at her
front door by passing by in a fully equipped limo and stuck his head through
the sun roof, producing a stunning female companion next to him and they
hurled eggs at Josie in her prom dress and laughed as they continued to
drive by.  This assignment by the paper sort of gives Josie a second chance
to "fit in".</P>
<P>The pranks come fast and furiously upon her return to school as three
conceited Barbie doll wannabes (Jessica Alba, Marley Shelton, Jordan Ladd)
make fun of her using guys at the school that they have trained to obey them
and they accuse Josie of wearing an outfit that became extinct in 1983.
Josie falls for her English teacher (Michael Vartan) who is one of only
three appealing characters in the film.  The other two are Josie's brother
(David Arquette) and a girl who befriends her at school (Leelee Sobieski).
The other characters in the film are a complete throwaway.  They are Josie's
head boss (Garry Marshall?), her other superior (John C. Reilly) and the
office tramp (Molly Shannon).</P>
<P>'Never Been Kissed', for those who will like it, will probably find it
comparable later in life to a record you bought when you were in high school
but hated it when you were well into your adult years.  The film is also
extremely tasteless in many scenes.  It makes fun of high school metal
detectors, getting high, alleged safe sex involving bananas as a demo, and
drug use among some minority groups.  Drew Barrymore, who served as
executive producer, also looked very confusing in this film.  Her weight
seemed to shift from scene to scene.  In one scene she had a double chin and
her clothes made her look plump.  At other times she looked fine but these
factors kept switching back and fourth throughout the run of the movie.</P>
<P>Director Raja Gosnell ('Home Alone 3'), photographs the film in an extremely
ordinary way.  The pace Gosnell gives the film is like wading through heavy
snow.  There is no real focus to the story.  This mess looks and feels like
a series of out takes from a bad movie.</P>
<P>There is a movie from 1985 entitled 'Just One of the Guys' where an
extremely attractive female high school reporter proves she can be taken
seriously when she assumes the disguise of a boy, transfers to another
school and does her job.  That film knew how to enter the appealing side of
your mind and having seen it when I was 19, I still enjoy it at 33.  'Never
Been Kissed' is de facto entertainment.  And a couple of guys in the back
row of the theatre where I saw it were actually hurling humourous insults at
the screen which was the best part of the film.  The film is like many other
recent teenage rumblings getting more and more popular in film and making a
mockery of the greatest medium in the world and infecting it like a cancer.</P>
<P>Unlike promotional materials for 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer' and
'Cruel Intentions', where Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar's
breasts were used as shameful marketing tools, 'Never Been Kissed' at least
looked appealing going in.  Too bad its execution was a total failure.</P>
<PRE>OUT OF 5 > zero</PRE>
