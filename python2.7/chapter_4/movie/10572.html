<P>The Near Room (1996)
Oh Dear ! A Scottish attempt at film noir, dreech pictures perhaps.</P>
<P>This film fails on a number of counts. While it is competently filmed
and the acting is reasonable it never manages to shake off the "made for
TV" feel nor hide the formulaic construction. The sets are dark and
industrial, so much so that they never feel real, the characters are
underdeveloped rather than mysterious and the dark underside is so
contrived that one never has any feeling of true threat or menace.</P>
<P>The script writer should never have given the dialogue describing the
"near room" to any character let alone have them describe it twice. It
wasn't difficult to get at what the author meant - it was simply
unbelievable that any character would utter such pretentious prose.</P>
<P>This is clearly one to avoid, even aficionados of sex and violence will
find this as exciting as a chocolate malt drink - dark, distasteful and
useful if you have difficulty in getting off to sleep</P>
