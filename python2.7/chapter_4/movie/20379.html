<PRE>Unilateral Failure
Universal Soldier: The Return</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"We'll have to blow them up and hope the pieces don't fight us."</P>
<P>Hi-tech military department resurrects soldiers killed in battle and
monitors them with brain implanted micro-chips. The soldiers are fierce,
hard to kill, and relatively emotionless. Nonetheless, the program's budget
gets cut which prompts the main computer to take over the Universal Soldier
squad and threaten anything biological that gets in its way. Jean Claude
plays an earlier model minus the chip. He's the only one who has the code
the computer needs to stay alive.</P>
<P>Like a theme park action show in which stunt-people run through a set of
pops and propane blasts into safety nets barely hidden behind facade walls,
"Universal Soldier: The Return" is mildly flashy to look at, but there is no
sense of real danger. The Soldiers themselves are like the little green
plastic guys I used to play with at age five. We expect a bit more from a
Hollywood action movie. In one scene four U-soldiers are shot up by what
seemed like a hundred SWAT guys. Somehow, not one of the four was hit in the
face. That's way too hokey for a Van Damme movie.</P>
<P>The script fails to take any real risks as well. Formula action flick, with
standard dialogue: "What's going on?" "They'll stop at nothing!" ... add
gratuitous expletives. The acting is right on par with my plastic green army
guys. Even Jean (whom I normally enjoy) was plastic.</P>
<P>I'm sorry to say, "Universal Soldier" seems to be a quickly made film, with
uninspired direction, no unique purpose, populated with safe stunts and lots
of shooting.</P>
<P>Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, Michael Jai White, Kiana Tom, Bill Goldberg.
Directed by Mic Rogers. Written by William Malone, John Fasano.
Produced by Craig Baumgarten, Allen Shaprio and Van Damme at
Tri-Star/Baumgarten-Prophet/Indi-Prod/Long Road.
Rated R.</P>
<P>Grade..........................C</P>
