<PRE>FILM TITLE:            AY, CARMELA
DIRECTOR:            CARLOS SAURA
COUNTRY:             SPAIN ( 1991 )
SUPER FEATURES:    Political Farce.  Has odd funny moments. Twists of fate.</PRE>
<PRE>           !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>Carlos Saura has always been interested in dance, film, theatre, and many of
the artistic forms which people have related to.  He has depicted them in
his films as a part of life, a very important part of life, that provides
not only a spark, but also the means without which we are not capable of
surviving.</P>
<P>It is no surprise, then, when this film deals with such a theme, and in a
manner which is not pleasing, but this time, it is a compromise one has to
make between life and death.</P>
<P>A pair of down on their luck actors, take up a small living, in exchange for
food by providing entertainment for the troops  ( the republicans ) that are
fighting the forces supported by Mussolini, Hitler and Generalissimo Franco
( the nationalists ).  When they are tired of a small town, and decide to go
on to a larger place, life changes.  While resting close to Valencia ( their
destination ), they are approached by the advancing nationalists.  They are
arrested, and thrown in with all the others, only to be saved by an Italian
commander who used to be a theatre director, and stage manager.  He insists
on the creation of material for his own troops, and all of a sudden the
entertainers are forced to become real 'actors'.  It's the only alternative
to death.  However, Carmella ( the wife ) has a bit of a big mouth and often
speaks out, and this has a potential of getting them all in trouble.
Needless to say, they don't win, or get very far, although the nationalists
won all the battles and ruled until Franco's death in the seventies.</P>
<P>A bit of an oddity, for a Saura script, it is acted, in the spirit of a fun
farce, and play, but it is deadly serious, and the characters are in danger
at all times.  All in all, it is a slow film, that requires the viewer's
attention, because much of the dialogue is intended to create 'slips of the
tongue' which is a
very good, and strong acting tool.  However, this attitude, often gets all
of them in trouble, though the Italian commander, has a good enough sense of
humor and understanding of things, to be able to disagree, and defend their
position cleverly.  And without, meaning to, both the audience, and the
actors, are eventually forced, or resigned, to accept the inevitable
solution.  The life of the artists goes on.  The art lives on.  And a new
government is now in power, though it got there by the gun.</P>
<P>A politically minded film, it really shows the sensitive side of an
extremely volatile situation, and how one can deal with it, even if one
disagrees with it.  People do tend to stand up for life, given the choice.
And the ensuing  results are not always pleasant.</P>
<P>The acting is fun, and good.  The film does not have much music in it, but
it does have the political songs of the day, which at times are sung, and
their lyrics keep the film moving.  The subtitles, unfortunately do not do
the original dialect any justice at all, so one really misses out on the
actual
flavor, and style of insulting an invading force, which renders the actors
forced choice even more repugnant and disappointing.  Taken out of the
subtitles are the swearing, and the fowl language which these songs have.</P>
<P>The actors' original opinion on the nationalists is not very far from a pile
of excrement. The subtitle, doesn't even come close to telling us what was
really said.You may like to see this film, if you are a history buff, and
have an interest in Spain, or if you want to practice your vernacular
Castillian.</P>
<PRE>Enjoy it.</PRE>
