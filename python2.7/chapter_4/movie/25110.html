<PRE>CHUTNEY POPCORN
---------------</PRE>
<P>Reena (Nisha Ganatra) arrives too late on her motorcycle with her lover 
Lisa (Jillian Hennessy, "I Shot Andy Warhol") perched behind her for her sister 
Sarita's (Sakina Jaffrey, "Cotton Mary") wedding reception.  Reena's mother 
(Madhur Jaffrey, "Cotton Mary") is angry, not only at her lateness, but also 
because she can't accept Lisa as anything other than Reena's roommate.  Sarita 
and her mother think Reena is irresponsible.  Then Lisa lets slip that she 
thinks Reena's a bit selfish.</P>
<P>Troubled, Reena sees an opportunity to redeem herself in everyone's eyes
when it becomes apparent that Sarita is unable to sustain a pregnancy and
offers herself as a surrogate mother.  Lisa's against the idea and Sarita 
dismisses it until her husband Mitch (Nick Chinlund, "Mr. Magoo") convinces 
her that it's not such a bad idea.  But Reena's attempts to bear her sister's 
child put a severe strain in all these relationships in star/cowriter/director
Nisha Ganatra's "Chutney Popcorn."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>"Chutney Popcorn" is a 'gentle' comedy in that it offers few big laughs
(although the turkey baster scene would qualify) yet evokes smiles with 
its observations of human nature.</P>
<P>Veteran actress Madhur Jaffrey provides most of the comedy, constanty
calling upon her younger daughter to program her sprinklers ('Why doesn't
she call the perfect one?' mutters Reena) and dissolving into good humored
hysterics when Reena suggests that her mother's mother could have been a
lesbian.  She also performs traditional ceremonies for everything, beginning
with fertility.  Jillian Hennessy is a fresh-faced, down to earth Lisa, who
understandably panics when a pregnancy is thrust into her comfy lifestyle.
She reluctantly takes part in the project by wielding the aforementioned
turkey baster ('That stuff really smells - I don't know how
hets do it.').  Madhur's daughter Sakina is elegant and refined as Sarita,
which just that touch of entitlement that would get under Reena's skin.
Nick Chinlund's characterization of Mitch is a little odd.  At first he
seems like a nice, supportive husband, but he begins to get a little 
creepy when the mother of his child turns from being Sarita to being Reena.</P>
<P>Chubby-cheeked Nisha Ganatra displays a lot of talent juggling three major
roles in her film.  She's very convincing as the put upon rebel - the
'artistic' one whose lifestyle isn't understood by a demanding mother who
obviously adores her older, more traditional daughter.  Her screenplay
(coauthored with Susan Carnival) displays an ear for natural dialogue in
addition to its unique central concept.  However, the film as a whole 
has a few rough spots, with sound that is sometimes muffled, supporting
characters that are interchangeable and a couple of clumsily staged shots.
The cinematography by Erin King is nicely done, with the colorful accoutrements
of Indian culture providing some nice visual flair.</P>
<P>"Chutney Popcorn" is a sweet tale about familial and romantic love that
comes together well for a satisfying conclusion.</P>
