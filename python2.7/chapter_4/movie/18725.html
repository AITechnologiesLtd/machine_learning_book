<P>"Not far from here there's a fence. On the other side of the fence is
freedom. That gorilla will never try to get to it."
Starring Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding Jr., Donald Sutherland, Maura
Tierney. Rated R.</P>
<P>Instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will
undoubtedly label as "powerful" or "touching". I have a name for it
myself: "gross". This is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a
bully, the bully looks at the "rebel" threateningly, about to hurt him,
and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands
up too. How that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls
me: aren't present day moviegoers beyond being "inspired" by something
like that? This is one example (there are actually some more in
Instinct alone) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence.</P>
<P>Instinct's plot is brimming with potential: World-renowned
anthropologist Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) disappeared for two years
whilst doing research in the jungles of Africa. He was found and is
coming back to the United States a convicted killer; he murdered to
African policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him. After
committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport, the
authorities stick him in a prison's "psychotics ward". Assigned to do
an evaluation on Powell is a bright (or so we are told) young
psychiatrist Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.).</P>
<P>Caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of
furthering his career. Of course (and no mainstream filmmaker would
ever have it any other way) he starts really caring for Powell and he
becomes fixed on helping Powell prove that he is not a psychotic and
that he should not be in prison. And then there's the inevitable
"heartless meanie" character, in the form of Donald Sutherland who
plays Caulder's mentor. He cares for Caulder but does everything he can
to discourage him from helping Powell.</P>
<P>Let's get one thing straight: Dr. Theo Caulder is the most blatantly
incompetent psychiatrist I have ever seen, on screen or off. Any good
shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject
because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that
way. Not good old Theo. No, he asks purposefully pointed questions and
when Powell dares to venture to another subject Caulder says "We need
to talk about this right now." This is a flaw only in the sense that it
detracts from Instinct's already dubious credibility; unfortunately
it's also the least of its problems.</P>
<P>Director Jon Turteltaub, who made the delightful John Travolta vehicle
Phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par Cool Runnings decided
to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that, contrary to what
this movie's promotion would have you believe, it has much more in
common with Patch Adams than with The Silence of the Lambs. It's not
the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes
(What Dreams May Come aptly demonstrated that) but the kind that brings
vomit up your esophagus (excuse the graphic depiction). It aims to
"inspire" rather than to touch hearts. As Yoda would say, inspire it
does not.</P>
<P>It is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter (the very
experienced Gerald Di Pego) has to resort to literally telling the
audience a movie's story. Indeed, somewhere in the beginning of
Instinct, one of the characters actually reads aloud the film's plot to
another character. This, like the instance I mentioned in the first
paragraph of this review, is a horrid insult to our intelligence. I am
forced to wonder whether Turteltaub and Di Pego did not think that we
could figure out what Instinct is about simply from regular
conversation.</P>
<P>I think that Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors, and
he chews the scenery in this movie, brilliant as ever. Oscar winner
Cuba Gooding Jr. on the other hand is dreadful. His performance is at
least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a
shrink. I liked the guy in Jerry Maguire as well as in As Good as it
Gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real
feeling.</P>
<P>I love animals, and Instinct's prominent Save The Gorillas/Live in
Harmony With Nature theme is certainly something I could sympathize
with. However this movie's execution is completely unacceptable. Tone
down the violence and this will be a chick flick.
