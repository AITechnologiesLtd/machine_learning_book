<PRE>e                              THE DOORS
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>I figure most of us thought The Doors was plenty of movie at 138
minutes.  Little did we realize that one of Oliver Stone's least
favorably received movies would call for a two-disc DVD set with 43
minutes of deleted scenes, numerous documentary extras, and a feature
length commentary track from Stone.</P>
<PRE>And yet here it is.</PRE>
<P>Ten years after its initial release, I found The Doors a lot like I
remembered: a long and meandering -- yet dutiful -- retelling of Jim
Morrison's life (and which ultimately had far more to do with him than
the band he fronted).  Stone traces all the high points -- from
Morrison's struggle to achieve fame in Venice, California during the
height of the surf music craze, to his run-ins with Ed Sullivan and Andy
Warhol.  But it's mainly Jim's self destruction via drugs, alcohol, and
scandalous behavior (antics that ultimately forced him to flee to Paris
to escape an obscenity conviction) that is the focus of the film, and
that relatively shallow effort is hard to sustain over nearly 2 1/2
hours.</P>
<P>Shot with Stone's characteristic, psychedelic style, the film is a
memorable one thanks to Val Kilmer's inspired portrayal of Morrison, not
to mention nude scenes of hundreds of Hollywood actresses -- notably the
prudish Meg Ryan and Kathleen Quinlan.  There's also a prodigious volume
of music to contend with -- as virtually ever Doors song worth hearing
is at least sampled on the movie.  And ultimately, it's the music that
tells you more about the nihilism of Jim Morrison than Oliver Stone ever
could.</P>
<PRE>Far out, man.</PRE>
