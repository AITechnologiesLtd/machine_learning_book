<PRE>                              MOUTH TO MOUTH
                              [BOCA A BOCA]
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>This is a farce about sex.  The farce genre calls for frantic running
around,  mistaken identities and unexpected confusion at every turn,
the setting aside of reality; most of all, by definition farce must
have comedy.  Given those criteria, MOUTH TO MOUTH does quite well.</P>
<P>It is frantic.  People seem to be running all the time.  No one is whoM
he appears to be.  And it is funny.  It also is about sex . . . and
that never hurt a farce.  This sex is about those who work for the "900
Hot Lines," pretending to be enjoying the sexual conversations with
those who phone in.</P>
<P>And of those who call and pay for their chatting, there are no doubt
many who are lonely and confused.  One such is Ricardo (Joep Maria
Flotats) who is in the midst of an unhappy marriage.  On top of that,
he is unnerved by thoughts he may be gay . . . which he is not.
Calling the Hot Line is a safe way for him to get his jollies.</P>
<P>Among those manning the phones is an aspiring but unemployed actor,
Victor (the handsome, sexy Javier Bardem).   The Hot Line is his means
of support.  In a short while, Victor is doing great on the phones
turning people on.   As one would imagine, we are treated to some
hilarious scenes between Victor and Ricardo.</P>
<P>Underlying the film is the message that there is more to life than
casual sex.  Victor undergoes a metamorphosis when he gives up his
dreams of being a famous movie star, getting rich; instead he decides
to be a decent human being.  In fact, there are lots of people whose
lives are changed before the film concludes . . . on a happy note, of
course, as befits farce.</P>
<P>Also in the cast are the beautiful Altana Sanchez- Gijon, Maria
Barranco, and Myriam Mezieres.</P>
