<PRE>STUART BLISS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>     The Apocalypse is at hand.  Or maybe not.</PRE>
<P>     Stuart Bliss has noticed that the birds are flying in the wrong
direction, which is just one of many signs he has been picking up
lately.  There have been increased sunspot activities, high Geiger
counter readings and a televangelist preaching directly to him.  Or so
he thinks.  Is this all a paranoid delusion, or is he onto something
big?</P>
<P>     STUART BLISS, by first-time director Neil Grieve, is a black
comedy with the emphasis on the darkness.  Although it has sporadic
touches of humor to temper the descent into madness, the monotonic
story written by the director and the movie's star, Michael Zelniker,
takes a relentless approach.  Never sympathetic or complex, the story's
protagonist, Stuart Bliss (Zelniker), is a played as a cipher.  With
the vacant stare of a zombie, Stuart movies through the picture like an
automaton.  The story itself holds so much promise that audiences will
likely stay with it even though its slow pacing takes what would have
been a fascinating short film and transforms it into a full-length, but
soporific, movie.</P>
<P>     The story opens well with some good, subtle humor.  Stuart is a
marketing wiz at a small company that buys up surplus goods.  This week
they landed a thousand handheld Geiger counters from a defense firm
that has gone belly up.  Stuart reckons that, with the right sales
campaign, he can convince consumers that they are must-have items.</P>
<P>     Stuart starts flipping out when his wife leaves him.  Soon
everyone seems out to get him.  When they install a surveillance camera
in the coffee room at work, his coworker nonchalantly tells him that,
"businesses like ours lose a lot of money because of inefficiency."
(Stuart's boss made this exact same admonition earlier in a different
context.)</P>
<P>     With actors playing multiple roles, the movie tries to confuse the
audience in much the same way that Stuart is befuddled.  The problem is
that after a while the audience simply doesn't care any more.  Why the
director created a stick figure lead is the movie's real mystery.  A
little variety in the acting, some real emotion, and a few laughs would
have helped enormously.</P>
<P>     STUART BLISS runs 1:28.  It is not rated but might be PG-13 for
adult themes and would be fine for any teenager.</P>
<PRE><HR></PRE>
<P>     The movie is in the process of getting a distributor and thus does
not yet have a release schedule.</P>
