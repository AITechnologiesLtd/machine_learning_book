<PRE>Review: Henry Fool (1997, R)</PRE>
<PRE>Rated:  *** of ***** stars.</PRE>
<PRE>Written and directed by:  Hal Hartley</PRE>
<P>Reviewed by:  Mike Summers (<A HREF="mailto:michael@smart.net">michael@smart.net</A>)</P>
<P>I found this film in the new release section of my local video chain.  I 
selected it largely on the strength of its description as a "biting 
black-comedy".  Well, this film falls short as a comedy, but that complaint is 
really more of an indictment of the video marketers inability to pigeon-hole 
this strange little film than as a slam against HENRY FOOL itself. There are 
many parts of HENRY FOOL which are quite funny, the most memorable being when 
the title character Henry Fool's (Thomas Jay Ryan) replies "His throat was 
sore from the cigarettes" when confronted by his wife (Parker Posey) about the 
alcohol she smells on their 10-year old son. But the film is really an 
allegory about artistic expression and the catalytic effect that people have 
on each others lives.</P>
<P>The story relates the impact that stranger Henry Fool  has on the quiet, 
backward garbage-man Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) and Simon's dysfunctional 
family and friends. Henry's passion for writing prompts Simon to begin writing 
on his own. Although it could use a little tighter editing, for the most part 
the film is well directed. The opening sequence cleverly  introduced Simon's 
name, not in dialog, but through the visually prominent name-tag on his work 
clothes. This little trick was then capitalized on in the scene in which Simon 
and Martin Fool first meet. However, while the direction was strong, the 
writing was weak. The title character is highly unsympathetic, which made it 
difficult to care about what happened to him.  Parker Posey's character Fay, 
although pivital to the story development,  was  shallow and one-dimensional. 
The other characters were even more cartoonish, a fact which ultimately sapped 
much of the dramatic strength from the final conflict leading to Martin Fool's 
downfall. Finally, a subplot dealing with the election of a right-winged 
Congressman was developed and seemed to be having an interesting impact on the 
minor characters when it was suddenly dropped in the last 30 minutes of the 
film. In short, I would classify HENREY FOOL as an interesting failure. 
However, even as a failure, the film had enough promise that I am looking 
forward to the next Hal Hartley directed film with a just a small bit of 
enthusiasm.  I give this film three out of five stars.</P>
