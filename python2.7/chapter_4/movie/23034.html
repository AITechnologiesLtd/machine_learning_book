<PRE>THE BIG LEBOWSKI</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Joel Cohen
Written by: Joel and Ethan Cohen</PRE>
<P>Imagine if someone came into your house demanding money, and when you didn't
come up with it right away, they urinated all over your rug. Not just any rug
either, it was the rug that really tied the room together. What would you do?
While this may not sound like anything which even resembles a setup for a film,
it's exactly how "The Big Lebowski" starts. Like the television show,
"Seinfeld", "The Big Lebowski" is basically a movie about nothing. It doesn't
have much of a plot, it's about characters who wander aimlessly through
pointless lives, and this big, shambling movie borders on being a comic
masterpiece.</P>
<P>Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), better known as "The Dude", has just had his rug
defiled by a couple of thugs. You see, these thugs mistook The Dude for another
Lebowski (David Huddleston), who just happens to be a millionaire. It would
seem that The Big Lebowski's trophy wife, Bunny (Tara Reid), owes money all
over town. So, after consulting his best friend, a shell shocked Vietnam vet
named Walter (the hysterical John Goodman), The Dude decides to get a
replacement rug from The Big Lebowski. This soon leads to the discovery that
Bunny has been kidnapped, and The Dude is hired by Lebowski to deliver the
money for her safe return. What follows is a hilarious series of mistakes and
misunderstandings, as the dude finds his peaceful, laidback, alcohol filled
life completely rearranged. If this so called plot sounds a tad confused,
that's because it is. Even the film's narrator (Sam Elliot) confesses to having
lost his train of thought at one point.</P>
<P>Let me say that this isn't an easy film to review. There isn't much of a plot
for me to discuss, and there's nothing even remotely serious about what plot
there is. Perhaps the best way to proceed would be to discuss each of the
multitude of colorful characters at work here. To start with, we have The Dude
himself, played by the perfectly cast Jeff Bridges ("Arlington Road",
"Starman"). The dude is a comical looking hippie, stuck in the '90s when he
belongs in the '60s. This shaggy looking pacifist has only two important things
in his life: drinking and bowling. Next up, we have Walter Sobchak, as depicted
by the brilliant, hilarious, and always underrated John Goodman ("Bringing out
the Dead", "Fallen"). Walter is a Vietnam veteran who is utterly convinced that
everything in life relates in some way to the Vietnam war; whether it be
bowling, kidnapping, or peeing on someone's rug.</P>
<P>While The Dude and Walter are the focal points of the film, they are surrounded
by hilarious characters. Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) is the daughter of The
Big Lebowski, and she paints in the nude while hanging from the ceiling on a
cable. Donny (Steve Buscemi) is a brain dead surfer who hangs out with Walter
and The Dude. Of course, we can only assume he's brain dead since Walter never
allows him to complete a sentence. Jesus, the bowler (John Turturro), is a
paedopheliac who dances to salsa music whenever he makes a strike, and who we
see going from door to door telling people that he's a paedopheliac in
accordance with the law; but it's still something you can't picture someone
really doing. Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is The Big Lebowski's butler, who
laughes inanely at anything anyone says and is the only person The Dude meets
up with who actually calls him The Dude (he hates being called Lebowski). There
are dozens more, but I don't have room to list them all in this review.</P>
<P>The film's main strength is in its bizzare characters and equally unusual
situations. For example, there is a scene in which The Dude drinks a drugged
White Russian (his favorite drink) and goes through a hysterical dream sequence
called "Gutter Balls". The movie's only weakness is that it's difficult to keep
a film going for more than two hours when there is no plot to speak of. As a
result of this, the film does falter at times, particularaly towards the end
where things get a bit too sentimental. All that aside, "The Big Lebowski" is a
brilliant, crazy comedy which could only have come from the Cohen brothers. The
film does run a bit too long at  minutes, but it manages to keep the laughs
coming for nearly the entire length. While the rather unusual humor might not
be for everyone, I strongly recommend it to those of you who like off the wall
stories about off the wall characters, and I give it a well earned four and a
half out of five stars.</P>
