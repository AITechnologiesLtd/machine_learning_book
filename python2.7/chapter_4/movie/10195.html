<PRE>                        AS GOOD AS IT GETS</PRE>
<P>Coincidentally, the film's title befits this reviewer's opinion of the
movie.   For sheer entertainment, for witty dialog, for fine acting,
it will be hard for any 1997 film to beat. Nicholson, in particular,
gives the performance of a lifetime as the mean-spirited romance
novelist, Melvin,  who would rather insult you than ignore you.   Not
giving the slightest relationship to whom you are, he enjoys
indiscriminately lashing out.</P>
<P>The first big laugh is when he tosses his next door neighbor's dog
into the trash chute found on each floor of the apartment house.   The
neighbor, Simon Nye (Greg Kinnear) happens to be an artist enjoying
much praise, which is reason number one (though no reason is needed)
for Melvin to attack.   Reason number two is that Simon is gay and
Melvin uses that as an excuse (again, not needed) to vent his spleen
on Simon.</P>
<P>The last of the film's triumvirate is Carol, (Helen Hunt) a single
mother with  an asthmatic child.    She is the waitress in the local
cafe where Melvin has his daily cholesterol-filled breakfast.   Her
small claim to fame is that she is the only one who fights back
against Melvin's sarcasm.</P>
<P>Melvin, as it happens, is not merely just mean; he actually suffers
from the medical problem of uncontrolled compulsive obsession.
Everything and everything is magnified by this illness.   Oddly
enough, the more Melvin lashes out at her and the more she retaliates,
a special relationship develops, each recognizing something good in
the other.    And so, while Melvin, Carol and Simon seem to share
nothing in common, their lives intertwine in this very funny and
touching not-to-be-missed film.</P>
<P>Smaller parts are handled nicely by Skeet Ulrich, Cuba Gooding, Jr.,
and Shirley Knight.</P>
<P>None of this, of course,  would have been possible without Mark
Andrus' excellent story and script, the latter in collaboration with
James  L.  Brooks.   Making intelligent, poignant adult dialog is not
easy but Andrus and Brooks have really poured it on in large
quantities so that it is a delight to listen to the actors say their
lines.</P>
<PRE>One of this year's best films.</PRE>
