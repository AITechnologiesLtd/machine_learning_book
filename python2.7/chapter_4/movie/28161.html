ALONG CAME A SPIDER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In ALONG CAME A SPIDER, directed with fast-paced precision by Lee 
Tamahori (ONCE WERE WARRIORS), a senator's daughter, Megan Rose (Mika 
Boorem), is kidnapped from a prep school that is kept under tight Secret 
Service protection.  Megan is one of many children of Washington's 
political class who attend the school.  Among the many questions that 
the story poses is, why her?  Another is why the kidnapper (Michael 
Wincott), who likes to leave clues, admits that he wants to prolong the 
hunt.</P>
<P>Morgan Freeman, repeating the role he played in the popular 1997 film 
KISS THE GIRLS, plays  Washington, D.C. police detective and 
psychologist, Dr. Alex Cross.  This time Alex reluctantly accepts 
Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan as his partner since she feels guilty 
after having been in charge of the Secret Service detachment at the 
school.  Flannigan is rather well played by Monica Potter (PATCH ADAMS 
and HEAD OVER HEELS), an attractive and likable actress with very blonde 
hair, large eyes and lips, who up until now has delivered one bland 
performance after another.  Under Tamahori's direction, she shows a more 
vulnerable and intelligent side that hasn't been seen much up until now.  
Maybe she's a late bloomer.</P>
<P>As the kidnapper plays Alex like a fiddle, Alex tries his best to keep 
up with the kidnapper's strategy, trying to find some way to get one 
step ahead of him.  Freeman is nothing short of terrific again and is a 
real treat to watch.  Unfortunately, many of the supporting cast aren't 
used as effectively.  Dylan Baker is wasted as the briefly arrogant 
federal agent in charge of investigating the kidnapping.  And Michael 
Moriarty ("Law and Order"), as Senator Rose, doesn't do much other than 
look anguished.</P>
<P>>From the gripping action sequence that opens the movie until the last 
twist, director Tamahori keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.  
Marc Moss's script, based on James Patterson's novel, provides some nice 
surprises but not so many that it gets ridiculous.  Yes, there are 
probably plenty of logical problems with the story, but the film, to its 
credit, never goes into neutral, allowing the audience to begin thinking 
about any possible holes or implausibilities.  The result is an 
entertaining film that makes you crave for the next time Morgan Freeman 
recreates his Detective Alex Cross character.  I'm certainly ready.</P>
<P>ALONG CAME A SPIDER runs a brisk 1:44.  It is rated R for violence and 
language and would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
