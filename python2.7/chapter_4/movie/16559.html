At First Sight (Reviewed on Feb. 5/99)</PRE>
<P>Starring Val Kilmer, Mira Sorvino, Nathan Lane</P>
<P>What must it be like to be blind?  Never being able to physically see
anything, always touching for some semblance of that sensation.  I respect
blind people just because they're able to get through every single day
despite such a huge hurdle to overcome.</P>
<P>In "At First Sight", Val Kilmer plays such a person.  Blind since the age
of three, he's just as competent as anyone else, provided he's familiar
with his surroundings.  He's employed as a masseuse at the local spa, he
has lots of friends, and a sister who loves him and cares for him.  All
this changes, though, when he meets a vacationing architect, played by
Mira Sorvino.  They fall in love, and she changes his life.  She moves him
to New York and introduces him to a doctor who promises him his sight
through a radical new operation.  He accepts, and finds himself thrust
into the world of the seeing.  Nathan Lane enters the picture as a "sight
therapist" who helps Kilmer understand what he's seeing.</P>
<P>"At First Sight" contains the restoration of sight to a blind man, but is
more interested in the romance between Kilmer and Sorvino.  And that's the
major flaw of the movie.  Not that Kilmer and Sorvino don't make an
enjoyable and engaging couple; in fact, their chemistry is instantly
believable.  </P>
<P>No, the problem with "At First Sight" is that the filmmakers seem to think
that we would prefer to witness endless scenes of Kilmer and Sorvino
frolicking in parks, ice rinks, etc.  I found the concept of restoring
vision to a blind man to be fascinating, and was quite disappointed to
come to the realization, around an hour into the movie, that Kilmer and
Sorvino's romance was going to dominate the film.</P>
<P>Not nearly enough time is spent on Kilmer's adjustment to sight.  I'd say
it takes him about 15 minutes of screen time to get acclimitized to the
world of the seeing.  I would have liked to have seen a lot more of this
process, and I especially would have liked to have seen more Nathan Lane. 
He's the stand-out here, and it's too bad that his part is such a minor
element of the movie.</P>
<P>"At First Sight" isn't a bad movie by any means.  It's just a
disappointing one.</P>
