                                 (THE BOAT)
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>Ever wondered what it is like to be in a submarine during wartime?
This film brings it home like none other.</P>
<P>During World War II, only one out of 10 of the 40,000 German
submariners survived. The film shows the terror, the claustrophobia of
those in the submarines as the depth charges drop all around them.  It
also shows the sailors as young human beings, not as Nazis Storm
Troopers; young kids in a most miserable situation.</P>
<P>A tense, magnificent film, ranking with some of the best movies ever
made.</P>
<P>Available in dubbed English but try to get the German version with
English subtitles.</P>
