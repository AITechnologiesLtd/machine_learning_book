"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Ever hate somebody for being too well liked?  Too beautiful?  Too
respected?  Too perfect?  That's the basic gist of Beau Travail, Claire
Denis' strikingly beautiful film loosely based on Herman Melville's
`Billy Budd.'  I liken the film to fighting world featherweight champion
Prince Naseem – you laugh off Travail's near lack of dialogue,
indistinguishable characters, puny running time and paper-thin plot, but
before you know it, you're lying on your back with little birds floating
around your head.</P>
<P>Denis Lavant (Lovers On the Bridge) plays a French Foreign Legion
Sergeant named Galoup.  His men, an interesting blend of black Africans
and white Europeans, inhabit a post in Djibouti on Africa's east coast.
Travail goes out of its way to documents the grueling physical tasks
that the soldiers must routinely participate in while baking under the
blistering hot sun.  Their chores and maneuvers seem incredibly
pointless, often drawing smirks from the villagers that watch in
amazement.</P>
<P>Short, ugly and scarred (think of a French version of Tommy Lee Jones),
Galoup is respected by his men, but he develops an irrational hatred
toward one particular soldier named Sentain (Grégoire Colin, The
Dreamlife of Angels).  Galoup can't stand Sentain's popularity with his
fellow soldiers and, especially, the Legion's commanding officer (Michel
Subor).  His sweeping jealousy begins to affect everything in his life,
turning Galoup into an entirely different person.</P>
<P>With Galoup's sparse narration, and the presence of soldiers and
beautiful poetic images, Travail reminded me of The Thin Red Line (and
it's about half that Oscar nominee).  What I found strange was Denis'
(Nénette et Boni) need to let her camera linger on the soldier's
well-chiseled bodies.  The troops were almost always shirtless, and the
robotic manner at which they approached their tasks made parts of the
film seem like a commercial for The Gap.  This, along with Galoup's
inexplicable envy of Sentain, provided some very strong homoerotic
undertones to Travail.</P>
<P>If anything, Travail is worth a viewing just for its visuals.  The
pristine blue water of the Indian Ocean offsets the drab, rocky
surroundings of Djibouti.  Cinematographer Agnès Godard (Nénette) does a
fantastic job of capturing the beauty of this particular area of Africa,
as well as the dark brutality of man.</P>
<P>1:28 – Not Rated but contains some violent images and implied sexual
content</P>
