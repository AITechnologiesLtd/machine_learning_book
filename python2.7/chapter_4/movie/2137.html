<P>TV-Guide(tm)-Review
-------------------
     The Son of Satan, reborn every millennium (or thereabouts), tries
to unleash his Father on the unsuspecting Earth via a collection of
magical runestones while a pack of elderly Druids and their two newest
Warrior/Druid inductees fight to contain The Evil One for another
millennium.</P>
<P>Tak Summary
------------
     Well this screening was sponsored by KUBE 93 in the Seattle area,
and I didn't get a chance to obtain any publicity packages from them,
so you'll have make due with what I recall from the movie.  The actor &
other data is from my photocopy of the admission ticket.  But it's only
been two hours since I left the theatre and when I started typing this,
so it should still be pretty fresh.</P>
<P>     ...In some dark past, the stones that are used to contain or
release Satan are lost and scattered when invading hoards burst in on a
Druidic ceremony where they have just successfully used the stones to
contain the latest incarnation of Satan's son.</P>
<P>     Cut to the present, where a beautiful young New York woman becomes
instantly pregnant when exposed to a lunar eclipse, promptly gives
birth to a blackish glob which scoots across the floor and devours the
lady's fluffy white yappy dog (Yea!), and then metamorphs into a fully
grown Julian Sands.  In one of the only similarities to the first
movie, the Warlock channels Satan through the fresh corpse and receives
his mission (gather the stones & break Dad out of Hell) and a gruesome
map to their current whereabouts.</P>
<P>     The rest of the movie flashes back and forth from the Warlock's
gradual acquisition of the stones, to the two young warrior/druids'
training sessions as they prepare to defend their two stones from the
Warlock.</P>
<P>     In the final showdown, the elderly druids provide only a monetary
pause for the warlock, who chases the two yung'uns to a stonehenge
forest clearing, where we are treated to psychic knife-fu, tree-fu,
pickup-truck-fu, motorcycle-fu, and lots of spiffy computer graphics.
Is the ending ever in doubt?  Nope.  But I expected I knew how it would
end going in and I wasn't disappointed.</P>
<P>Technical Comments
------------------
     I don't usually bother with this, because I don't feel qualified
to judge that kind of stuff.  And I'd rather NOT notice such things.
Most of the time, I go to a movie to be entertained in one form or
another, not to admire someone's craft. But that's because it's usually
done with enough skill that I don't notice such things like sound,
editing, composite shots, photography, and whatnot.  Well, not this
time.</P>
<P>     At times, the voices seemed oddly "wrong," almost as if they had
been dubbed in afterwards, and in a bathroom chock full of echos.
There were multiple instances of "orbiting cameras," as well as several
appearances of the "midget cam."  It also looked like they were playing
with a dual-focus technique ...  often one person's face would take up
half the screen in profile, with the other person shown on the other
half of the screen in the distance. Fine -- except for the monstrously
fuzzy area where they fused the two images together.</P>
<P>     It also looked like they got a good deal on by-now generic
computer effects.  A psychic knife-fight with an obviously computer
generated dagger, a morph melt-through, digitally erased footage, and
plenty of others.  Actually, I may be attributing too much to the
computers.  I'm sure it's more cost effective to use the more classic
techniques in some cases.</P>
<P>     And of course lots of traditional buckets of blood (the Warlock
has *black* blood -- oooh), squishy gore stuff, and melting wax heads.
Oh, I almost forgot the "bury-the-guy-in-the-ground-with-a-fake-body"
trick like they used for Bishop at the end of Aliens.  Lots of fun.
Plus I'm sure they used lots of good old fashioned slasher-flick
tricks.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts
------------
     I went to this movie cause I love bad B movies.  (and Whup-ass
movies -- which I define as any movie with an invincible hero(ine) with
lots of foot-fu, stick-fu, bullet-fu and anything-else-fu.  Current
examples include Striking Distance, Hard Target, and Demolition Man.)
So I wasn't looking for quality, just a bit of class.  I was sorta
disappointed.</P>
<P>     The first movie had some intriguing ideas (nails in the
footprints, old-wives tales that were true, etc) as the witch-hunter
from the past tracked down the slowly strengthening Warlock, who had to
FIND his powers.  In one scene, the Warlock had to stew up a little boy
to make a flight potion.  But in WARLOCK: THE ARMAGEDDON, watch out --
he's ready to whup-ass from the git-go.  To be fair, there's some neat
satan-detection gear (slug-o-meter), as well as some voodoo-esque
son-of-satan damaging gear (I bet there's no leaves in hell). But I
guess I wanted more and better.</P>
<P>     Perhaps it's just that time pleasantly obscures my memory, but
there didn't seem to be that many sheer buckets of blood and gross-out
effects in the first WARLOCK.  Well, exception for that one scene with
a fried tongue sandwich... blah!</P>
<P>     There was a bit of blatant good-guy-stupidity here and there -- if
you've got the Son of Satan impaled by your friendly animated tree, you
don't just *assume* he's dead, especially if you've just gone a few
rounds with him.  The whole theatre groaned loudly at this one.</P>
<P>    Lots of good/bad/stupid one-liners like the following:</P>
<PRE>son: "But Dad! why'd you have to kill me!"
dad: "You're not dead now..."</PRE>
<PRE>    Harhar.</PRE>
<P>     Julian Sands *can* act. He can.  Really.  I've seen him.  But he
doesn't get much of a chance in this movie.  He has one stoic
expression pasted on his face through the whole movie (could he be a
computer model with a Julian Sands texture map?) except when he gets to
thrash around if someone gets in a good shot.  Then he gets to grimace
and chomp down on those special *black*-foaming-blood capsules.  Cool.</P>
<P>     There were no attempts to scare the audience either. Thinking back
to the first one, I shouldn't have expected any of that, though some
flicks of this caliber (the later Freddy Krugers for one) still
attempted to throw in the occasional Spring Loaded Cat.  (Apologies to
"the phantom."  I stole his SpringLoadedCatQuotient -- I love it --
it's so *true* -- watch yer typical horror flick and see.)  The only
anxiety produced is deciding whether you really WANT to view the latest
incoming gore, or if you'd rather examine your hands for stray
particles of dirt.</P>
<P>     I wish they had a bit *less* of a budget, or paid the script and
story writers better, instead of buying lots of blood and so-so special
effects.  As one of my companions remarked when we were leaving the
free screening... "I woulda been mad if I had paid any money for that
film."  My feelings exactly, and we were both fans of the first one.</P>
<P>     Oh, well, it'll be great to see it on late night cable soon.  I'd
love to see what MST or Double Take (the ppl who did Hercules Returns)
or even a few friends with attitudes can do for WarLock:The
Armageddon.</P>
