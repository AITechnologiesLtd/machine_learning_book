<PRE>REVIEW: The Killer (1989)
(Die xue shuang xiong)
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</PRE>
<P>Cast: Yun-Fat Chow (known in Hollywood as Chow Yun-Fat), Jeffery Chow,
Danny Lee, Sally Yeh, Chu Kong, Kenneth Tsang
Director: John Woo
Screenplay: John Woo
-- available in the cult/nostalgia section of your local video store --</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 and a half stars</PRE>
<P>After viewing The Killer, it's hard to think about anything else.  John
Woo, now one of the worlds most revered action directors, reaches the
audience on so many different levels that it's easy to be overwhelmed in
the process.  He wrote and directed the film with the precision and
craftsmanship of a true mastermind, and uses a remarkable way of
filmmaking to convey his story and stimulate the senses.  It's an action
film, really, but it's not centered around the action scenes themselves.
It has a romantic subplot, without being about a love-struck romance.
It gives lessons on revenge, without making clear whether vengeance is
right or wrong.  Finally, and most impressively, it tells a story of
humanity - of honoring friends in the worst of all scenarios - and
generates pure-bred emotion amongst blazing guns and dripping blood.</P>
<P>The Killer is similar in story to Woo's 1997 masterpiece Face/Off.
Certainly the same amount of dynamic chemistry between the two main
protagonists is evident, perhaps even a little more so.  Jeffery (Chow
Yun-Fat) is a slick professional killer who, during a mission,
accidentally partially blinds a young woman singer, Jennie (Sally Yeh).
Six months later, Jennie is almost totally blind, and needs an expensive
operation to correct her eyesight.  Jeffery takes on a last job for $1.5
million, planning to retire from his hard-hearted profession after the
mission is completed.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, ace cop Inspector Li (Danny Lee) learns about Jeff's expert
ways and tracks him down - his only connection being the obvious Jennie.
The assured showdowns between these two characters results in a unlikely
friendship; at one of the many unprecedented moments, they dub each
other as "Mickey Mouse" and "Dumbo."</P>
<P>The Killer oozes class and imperative timing, as Woo brings traditional
action scenes onto the screen with an originality and flair that few
directors can match.  Brilliant scene maker Brian De Palma pieces
together action scenes with the smart sort of skills; both giving a
striking visual sincerity to their material.  De Palma's best moments
include the infamous train station stairs scene in The Untouchables, and
the intense minutes of Tom Cruise descending into a high security room
in Mission: Impossible.  Woo completed The Killer before his entrance
into Hollywood, and The Killer's thrilling climax in a church ties with
John Travolta and Nicholas Cage's "mirror" showdown in Face/Off as some
of the best this director has to offer.  The difference between Woo and
De Palma, though, is that Woo generally maintains the level of quality
all throughout; consequently making terrific films, not just terrific
scenes.</P>
<P>Most people will be pleased to know that the film - which was originally
in Chinese (it's real name being Die xue shuang xiong) - does not have
subtitles, but rather has been dubbed into less than convincing English.
Disappointingly, much of the dialogue is ridiculously simplistic, and it
seems a little silly that all characters are speaking with healthy
American accents in Hong Kong (whilst listening to Chinese music, I
might add).  This is the most obvious flaw in the film, and will
frustrate viewers who want rich, illustrious dialogue to suit the rich,
illustrious film.  Still, it must be said that no-one goes to see a John
Woo film for the dialogue (although Face/Off's dialogue plays a large
part of what makes it so great to watch).</P>
<P>Chow Yun-Fat, who made his Hollywood debut in 1997 with The Replacement
Killers, is on cue every time in the film's most likeable part.
However, someone's character seems a little too inexperienced and
erratic to be completely convincible as an ace cop.  But somehow the
chemistry between these two works beautifully - emotionally and
physically.</P>
<P>>From the mind of a truly dynamic director comes this wonderfully thought
out and executed film.  Woo has made sure that The Killer is as
attractive emotionally as it is visually; combining all elements of what
makes a great film great.  But more than that, he invents scenarios that
reassure viewers of what a true cinematic experience should be like.</P>
