<PRE>American History X (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>        Directed by Tony Kaye
        Starring Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Beverly
        D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, Stacy Keach, Fairuza Balk,
        Jennifer Lien, Elliott Gould, Guy Torry, Ethan Suplee</PRE>
<P>This harsh, beautifully crafted film is actually upsetting to watch,
it is so intense.  Edward Norton is at his finest, in a performance
that earned him an Oscar nomination.  It's quite simply the best
movie I've seen in years.</P>
<P>Though it is the story of one man's redemption, it is hardly
optimistic.  Derek Vinyard (Norton) is just released from prison;
a reformed neo-Nazi skinhead, he tries to stop his high school
age brother Danny (Furlong) from following in his footsteps. To
try to undo some of the damage he has done.</P>
<P>Derek's story is told in extensive flashbacks, his transformation
from a studious middle class ‘good kid' to a racist ringleader. 
Traumatized by the shooting death of his firefighter father,
which Derek is convinced was racially motivated, he turns his
rage into ideology.  What's truly frightening about Derek is that
he's bright and articulate.  He's not just another thug.  The goons
and losers in the Venice Beach fascist cell idolize him.</P>
<P>Neo-Nazi scum is made, not born.  Poisoned by the killing of the
father he idolized (who, it turns out, was prejudiced and not far
from being a racist himself), pressured by the family's reduced
circumstances in a deteriorating, crime-ridden neighborhood, 
Derek embraces an ideology of hate. He's helped down that road
by the local mini-Hitler (played with slimy abandon by Stacy
Keach).  But people are not merely products of their
environment.  Derek's sister Davina (Jennifer Lien) lives in the
same pressure-cooker household and has inherited the same
violent temper; the difference is she refuses to transform her rage
into an ideology.</P>
<P>As for young Danny, he's a kid who'd follow his big brother over
a cliff.  His essential sweetness and innocence stand in shocking
contrast to his shaved head and white-supremacist tattooing.  </P>
<P>The performances in this film are outstanding.  Ethan Suplee, as
a white supremacist hanger-on, is a crude and disgusting
presence who contaminates the Vinyard's cramped apartment
with his mere presence.  Avery Brooks, as mentor to the
reformed Derek, projects an unshakable dignity and
uncompromising morality.  Beverly D'Angelo is the sickly and
exhausted mother who should have given up but cannot.</P>
<P>In a movie that includes brutal murders and prison rape, the most
harrowing scene is a flashback to a dinner table discussion. The
conversation turns to the case of Rodney King; included are
Danny (still a skinhead) and his mother's boyfriend, a liberal
Jewish teacher (Gould). Civilized discussion inevitably
degenerates into argument and epithets.  When Davina does not
knuckle under to his chauvinistic verbal bullying, Derek resorts
to physical bullying. Worked up into a fury, he throws the guest
out of the house, shouting anti-Semitic insults; Davina returns
and goes at him with a baseball bat.  It's an ugly, horrible scene,
acted with great  intensity and conviction.  These people are
losing their humanity.</P>
<P>Shot largely in luminous, silvery black and white, the film's
aesthetic beauty almost seems to mock the pain of its characters. 
As do the sunny Southern California locations.  A city park
basketball game, whites versus blacks, is presented as high irony;
an epic battle fought for the basest of motives.  Director Tony
Kaye had his troubles on this project (he was eventually removed
by the studio in the editing stage) but he sure knows his way
around a camera.</P>
