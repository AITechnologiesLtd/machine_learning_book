<PRE>                             FANTASIA/2000
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Little known fact: When Walt Disney released FANTASIA in 1940, it
was intended to be a permanent work in progress.  Each time you saw it,
you would see something new combined with something old and familiar.</P>
<P>     It didn't quite happen that way.  The original FANTASIA became a
classic, although a static one.  60 years later, that's about to
change.  With the release of FANTASIA/2000 we get eight animations set
to music: seven new pieces and one classic.  Oh, and this time it's
presented on IMAX -- the first ever animated feature for the large
format.</P>
<P>     Already the chatter of parties, people want to know, "How does it
stack up against the original?"  Comparison is difficult, but on the
whole, I prefer the new version, mainly because the overall animation is
better fit to the music.</P>
<P>     FANTASIA/2000 is good, but it isn't uniformly great.  The segments
range from the abstract (Butterflies dancing to Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony) to the modern (A NYC-themed "Rhapsody in Blue") to the bizarre
("Pines of Rome" can be described in only two words: Flying whales) to
the stupid ("Carnival of the Animals" and its flamingos-with-yo-yos
animation).</P>
<P>     Then there's something old, the classic "Sorcerer's Apprentice"
story with Mickey Mouse and the magic brooms, plus at least two new
classics: Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2 playing for a recreation
of "The Steadfast Tin Soldier" fairy tale, and the grand finale, a
gorgeous Mother Earth vs. volcano story set to "The Firebird Suite."</P>
<P>     FANTASIA/2000 also features interstitial narration from the likes
of James Earl Jones, Steve Martin, and Bette Midler.  This is amusing,
but in decades of moviegoing, I can say I've never seen anything so
frightening as the image of Angela Lansbury projected to a height of 80
feet.</P>
<P>     Like all IMAX films, FANTASIA/2000 is never short of fascinating
while making you mildly nauseous.  Like the original, it's really not a
kid's film, but it is another Disney classic for the vaults.</P>
