<PRE> "Hello, I'm your husband's idiot."</PRE>
<P>Starring Jacques Villeret, Thierry Lhermitte, Brochant Francis Huster,
Daniel Prévost. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>The Dinner Game, a good-natured, old-fashioned French farce by Francis
Veber (La Cage aux Folles) isn't particularly good, but to the
filmmakers' credit it could not have been much better. It's the kind of
movie in which the plot itself is a restriction, preventing it from
being more than a disappointingly broad, mildly entertaining situation
comedy. One of cinema's biggest problems is movies that fail to realize
the potential of their respective storylines; here's one that milks the
most out of its storyline but still turns out to be merely serviceable.</P>
<P>The cockeyed premise behind this fairly futile attempt is this: a group
of rich, snobby Frenchmen get together every week for a very special
dinner. To this dinner each must bring a very special guest. This guest
must be the biggest, most boring idiot they can find. They make the poor
saps humiliate themselves by simply talking, and whoever brings the
biggest idiot is the winner.</P>
<P>Publisher Pierre Bronchant (Thierry Lhermitte) is lacking an idiot just
a couple of days before the dinner. One of his pals, however, pulls him
out of potential hot water and finds him a dilly of a buffoon: François
Pignon, a lowly accountant who makes miniature models of famous
structures out of matchsticks. Bronchant is sure he has a winner on his
hands so he invites Pignon to his house for a drink and then to his
dinner under the guise that his publisher friends are interested in
doing a book on his models.</P>
<P>Unexpectedly, Bronchant hurts his back and can't go to the dinner. He is
unable to prevent Pignon from coming over to his house anyway. So it is
that Bronchant winds up at his idiot's mercy: nearly immobilized and
with his wife leaving him (oh, I'm sorry, did I forget to mention
that?), he has nothing to do but reluctantly accept Pignon's help. The
results are not pretty.</P>
<P>The Dinner Game plays out with all the wacky spontaneity of a Seinfeld
episode; unfortunately it also has the same sitcom humor and feel. Much
of the film is undeniably funny, but unfortunately Veber has yet to
learn the meaning of the word "subtlety". The movie may be amusing but
it's also fairly dumb and frivolously hollow; the jokes fly at you but
as they register in your head you can think of only the fact that you
could turn on the tv and see undeniably funnier stuff.</P>
<P>The performances are certainly good: veteran actor Jacques Villeret is
delightful as the oddly charming buffoon and Thierry Lhermitte's
Bronchant is duly contemptable. Indeed, the actors often make The Dinner
Game funnier than it perhaps should be; a classic example of performers
not only rising above their material but bringing it up a notch too.</P>
<P>The Dinner Game is a well-intentioned movie, making sure that it gets
across its message: don't judge a book by its cover. Unfortunately by
the end of the movie Veber still hasn't learned the meaning of the word
"subtlety" and the movie's theme winds up being conveyed in an
annoyingly outright manner. Instead of making it a constant
undercurrent, he just comes out and tells us what he wants us to
perceive from his movie.</P>
<P>If nothing else, The Dinner Game is a good try; an engaging and amusing
-- although not intelligent or subtle -- farce that entertains even as
its flaws are clear as day. I can't come right out and recommend this
movie but it isn't a bad way to spend an evening, especially if the
alternative selections don't appeal to you.
