<P>"Bitter Sugar" was made by Havana-born Leon Ichaso  ("El Super" and others)
who left Cuba and came to the US at age 14. It is such a bitterly
anti-Castro movie that it is bound to be execrated by Fidelistas, loved by
anti-Castrists, and disliked by sympathizers of the Cuban Revolution. But
the latter should note that the Revolution is not in question.What its
idealism eventually became is.  True, the film never mentions the
continuing Cuban policy of the US Government, but then, this is a movie
limited to internal affairs.</P>
<P>Those points  are moot however, since the film seems to have had a low
distribution profile. This is sad as "qua" film, "Bitter Sugar" is
excellently made and, for me, fascinating.</P>
<P>The setting is Havana, in fairly recent times not specified except for the
fact that the Soviet Union had not yet dissolved. Economically, Cuba's
living standards are awful. Gustavo, a good-looking, bright University
student is the son of psychiatrist Dr.Valdez and the brother of hirsute
rock musician Bobby. The boys' beautiful mother had died in accident some
years back.</P>
<P>Gustavo, an idealistic product of Castroism, is the "Hombre Nuevo" (the New
Man) of the Revolution, though, with his sense of humor he is no rabid
fanatic. He wins a scholarship to study aeronautics in Prague -- which, as
someone later tells him mockingly, is a useless skill in Cuba.</P>
<P>Gustavo meets Yolanda, a pretty dancer with a great figure. They fall in
love. But their affair is enormously complicated and affected by most
apects of life in Cuba: the lack of many basic necessities, censorship,
taboos, repression. The government is desperately trying to bring in
tourists whose dollars-only beaches and hotels are closed to Cubans other
than personnel. It is also on a frantic search for foreign investors,
while, ironically, Castro harangues the crowds about the Revolution
sweeping out capitalism. There are additional, personal complications, like
the "rockero" brother getting into trouble with the authorities, or
Yolanda's mother disapproving of "Communist" Gustavo.</P>
<P>The young people's relationship is touching though never saccharine. Both
are charming and intelligent. Rene Lavan and Mayte Vilan portray them to
perfection, subtly convey sensitivity with none of the expected (especially
from Latins) soap opera theatrics. Affectionate and friendly too is the
rapport between Gustavo and his humorously cynical, politically
disillusioned father.</P>
<P>I noticed that Cubans address their parents as "viejo" or "vieja" (old man,
old woman) which makes the father and son banter all the nicer. At a party
to celebrate the scholarship, Dr. Valdez unveils a cake, a rarity in this
land of tremendous shortages. He describes humorously how the "Socialist"
ingredients were obtained. Miguel Gutierrez, who plays him, is marvelous, a
major screen and stage actor in Cuba which he left in 1991. He could teach
others more than a thing or two in nuances, conveying a lot with a little,
and more...</P>
<P>I will not detail the plot which is quite complex yet never confusing.  The
film achieves a difficult multiple blend of excellent character portrayals,
a moving love story and the discussing, unveiling and criticizing Cuba,
especially how its politics stifle aspirations and limit  the lives of
younger people.</P>
<P>The story involves several people : the defiant musician Bobby (in a
devastating development which comes from a real event); Dr. Valdez who has
no clients, even though
"in Cuba everybody is crazy," and who starts a new career; Yolanda's
family; the scholarship kept dangling before Gustavo with advice "to play
the game"; an Italian investor woven in both as an individual and as
emblematic of the "new colonialists" of Cuba. Even minor characters have
impact.</P>
<P>You could swear that the whole thing was filmed in Havana. Yet, except for
some establishing and other shots, the filming took place in Santo Domingo.
I've seldom seen a more convincing job of substitution -- I can't even
bring myself to call it faking. On top of some undoubtedly genuine street
scenes of Havana, the recreation is exemplary. Black and white also adds
authenticity to the documentary feeling, and melds seamlessly with what
must be older black-and-white footage of the city's life. Within the film
there is also footage of older home movies and of current videotapes made
by the characters.</P>
<P>(The black-and-white print reminds me that some years ago, a university
student taking an Introduction to Film course, loudly protested that he
hated, and would refuse to watch, any black-and-white movies. I hope no one
will miss this film for this reason!)</P>
<P>The editing is masterful in its blend and variety. Lavishy and
intelligently incorporated music is well played,  from  good rock to nice
old tunes. The subtitles are of high quality and the recording catches
clearly the characteristic Cuban accents that tend to eat consonants.</P>
<P>A final thought on film and politics. Many classics, such as Eisenstein's,
were partisan and could even lie blatantly -- which "Bitter Sugar" does not
-- yet these are still great films.</P>
