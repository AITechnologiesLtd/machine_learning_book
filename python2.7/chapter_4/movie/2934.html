<PRE>                              THE RIVER WILD
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     If there currently is a more talented, more versatile actress than
Meryl Streep, I have no idea who that might be.  Be it SOPHIE'S CHOICE,
DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMAN, KRAMER VS KRAMER,
SILKWOOD, MANHATTAN, or any of her other films, she is magnificent.  It
comes as no surprise then that in this film she is right on the
believability target as the desperate mother and wife who steers a raft
through the white-water rapids to save her family.</P>
<P>     Gail (Streep), her husband, Tom (David Strathairn), and their son,
Roarke (Joseph Mazzelllo), are white-water rafting on their vacation as
David and Gail try to put the lost zest back into their marriage.  Gail
has spent her childhood on the river and knows every inch of it.  She
has even gone over the falls where the three rivers meet in a wicked,
turbulent and very dangerous confluence ... but she was 18 then.  Now,
so many years later, she is called upon to save her family as she and
her son race down the river in a raft with two robbers who are making
an escape with a bagful of money and forcing Gail to get them to the
border.</P>
<P>     Kevin Bacon is properly mean as one of the robbers who befriends
and charms young Roarke but who turns vicious when he kidnaps the
family to aid in his escape.</P>
<P>     The beautiful scenery, the rushing water with its churning waves,
the raft going over several falls, and everyone hanging on for dear
life as Gail maneuvers the raft around waves and boulders makes for an
exceptionally fine thriller while all the time, Jerry Goldsmith's
stirring music pumps up the action, keeping you glued to the edge of
your seat.  This is what action movies are all about.</P>
<P>     Directed by Curtis Hanson who scared you with THE HAND THAT ROCKS
THE CRADLE. The script is by Denis O'Neill.</P>
