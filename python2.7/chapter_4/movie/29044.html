<P>I didn't know too much about Jackson Pollock before seeing Ed Harris'
impressive biopic.  I knew he was an artist.  I had heard of his wife, but I
didn't know she was an artist as well.  And I remember Patti Smith referring
to him as a "nigger" in one of her songs.</P>
<P>After seeing Pollock, I'm still not that familiar with the celebrated
American artist, but I do know that Harris and screen wife Marcia Gay Harden
act their asses off in the film and were justifiably honored with Academy
Award nominations for their performances.  Pollock is almost good enough to
transcend the typical tale of a tortured artist, only occasionally slipping
into clichéd scenes showing the artist sitting alone with his head buried in
his hands or curled up in the fetal position.</P>
<P>For those of you as uneducated about art as myself, Pollock (played by The
Third Miracle's Harris) was a true original, blurring the line between
Surrealism and Expressionism in post-war America.  He married a fellow
artist named Lee Krasner (Harden, Space Cowboys), and the couple struggled
with both finances and Pollock's manic-depression until he went down in a
blaze of drunken glory.  Don't get pissy about me spoiling the ending - when
is the last time you saw a movie about an artist that didn't die?</P>
<P>The film opens in 1942, where Pollock and Krasner are both up-and-comers in
New York's growing art world.  They're a couple of WPA kids, getting monthly
stipends from the government to sink into their paintings.  Neither is
particularly well-known outside New York, especially in Europe, which, at
the time, was still the center of the art world.  One day Krasner drops by
Pollock's apartment to look at his work.  She's assertive and almost
robotically emotionless, giving him unsolicited advice about his work.  They
fall in love and move in together, where Krasner blindly supports her man,
even if it means his career will overshadow her own.</P>
<P>Things start happening when Pollock's work is seen by the influential Peggy
Guggenheim (Harris' real-life wife, Amy Madigan).  As his career begins to
pick up steam, however, Krasner watches Pollock become unhinged by mental
illness and alcoholism.  A move to East Hampton (filmed on Pollock's actual
property) temporarily helps, but before long, Pollock ditches gardening for
binge drinking.</P>
<P>The Hamptons was where Pollock abandoned traditional painting style and
accidentally discovered a technique that involved drizzling and splattering
paint onto a canvas from above - a move that landed the artist in Life
magazine and established him as one of the country's premiere modern
artists. Typically, the success only leads to more problems in his life.</P>
<P>The story of Pollock's rise and self-destruction barely matters in the long
run.  It's much more gratifying to watch Harris wield his paintbrush like a
weapon while he creates startling images identical to those of the real
artist.  But the bizarre relationship between Pollock and Krasner is the
real highlight here.  Harris, who also directs and produces, has probably
never been better, but even his performance takes a backseat to Harden's
stellar turn as Krasner.  Admittedly, this role is probably the biggest
she's had to tackle, but Harden is head and shoulders better here than in
anything else I've ever seen her in.  She barely sounds like or resembles
herself physically.  It's like they spliced her DNA with Jeanne
Tripplehorn's looks and Rebecca Pidgeon's vocal mannerisms.</P>
<P>Technically, Pollock is a real treat to watch, thanks to Harris' careful
direction and some snazzy photography from Buena Vista Social Club
cinematographer Lisa Rinzler.  The film is based on a novel called "Jackson
Pollock: An American Saga," written by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith
and adapted for the screen by Barbara Turner and Susan J. Emshwiller.</P>
