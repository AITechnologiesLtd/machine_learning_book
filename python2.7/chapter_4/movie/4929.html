<PRE>                              A FAMILY THING
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: An Arkansas man discovers that his
          real mother was black and goes to Chicago to find
          his black half-brother.  This is a deliberately
          paced and well-textured look at one black family
          and life in a black neighborhood, but it touches on
          a much wider black experience.  Three excellent
          performances keep the viewer's attention.  Rating:
          low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Earl Pilcher, Jr. (played by Robert Duvall), is an Arkansas good
ol' boy, complete with a pick-up truck that works a lot better than his
family does.  When his mother dies she leaves him a letter explaining
that she really is not his biological mother.  His real mother was a
black servant whom his father had raped and who died giving birth to
him.  The final wish of the only mother Earl has known is that he find
and get to know his black half-brother, Ray, in the Chicago police
department.  Earl takes his blue pick-up truck to navigate the
Interstate and find his brother.  What he finds is that Ray (James Earl
Jones) has buried just beneath the surface the hate he still feels for
Earl Sr. and Earl Jr.  Having discharged an unpleasant responsibility,
Earl starts for home only to be mugged and have his precious pick-up
stolen.  Ray finds he must care for Earl while Earl recovers and tries
to get back his pick-up.  Earl stays with Ray and gets to know Aunt T,
their mother's sister (played by Irma P. Hall).</P>
<P>     Earl describes his football days by saying he was small but made
up for it by being slow.  Much the same could be said of the plot of A
FAMILY THING, but the texture of life in the black neighborhood of
Chicago is more the point of the film than the pacing.  The plot is
just a bit contrived to give Earl a grand tour of the black experience
in America.  It does more than just show it to him; he also experiences
the feel of being an outcast and a minority.  All this happens while he
is thinking over the implications of his being black, all the while
still looking and thinking white.  Charles Gross's jazz score matches
in style the low- energy story-telling.  It pushes the right buttons,
but is not very creative.  Special credit should be given to Fred
Murphy's photography which is constantly engaging in both the Arkansas
town and especially in the Chicago black neighborhood with its El track
supports.</P>
<P>     If I were to choose whom I thought was the best American actor,
there is no doubt in my mind that Robert Duvall would be my first
choice.  Here he gives a quiet but rich performance.  The scene in
which he reads his white mother's letter to his father is a beautiful
piece of acting.  Reportedly his approach is to get someone with the
same background as his character and record him reading the lines, then
to mimic it.  Whatever he does, he is clearly sweating the details and
turning in a totally authentic performance.  James Earl Jones has a
much narrower acting range, but within that range he is a joy to watch.
However, Duvall's and Jones's acting styles do not quite mesh since
while Duvall slightly understates his acting, Jones overstates.  And
both are often upstaged by Irma P. Hall whose Aunt T seems to have more
personality than the two main characters combined.</P>
<PRE>     Acting and visual texture carry the film even if the pacing is
slow.  I rate it a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
