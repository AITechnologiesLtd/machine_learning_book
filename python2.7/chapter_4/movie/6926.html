<PRE>                         WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE
                       A film review by Mike Joyce
                        Copyright 1997 Mike Joyce</PRE>
<PRE>2.5 out of 5</PRE>
<P>An "offbeat" film about a young girl who has just entered junior high
school and is taunted by her peers. Dawn Wiener (played by Heather
Matarazzo in her first feature film) is the most unpopular and disliked
girl in her year level. Her locker is covered in graffiti of harsh insults,
and she is taunted by many of the students. This film brings back, with
haunting reality, the horrors of high school, and reminds one of just how
cruel kids can be. Is it any coincidence that her surname (Wiener) is
"nerdy"? I think not. The film revolves around Dawn, with her poor dress
sense, and looks at her life at school and at home. Both of which are sad
and unhappy. Dawn's older brother has a band, and Dawn falls in love (or
thinks she does) with the 'cool' lead singer. She is oblivious to the
reality that she has no chance with him (and because of her obsession
rejects offers from a boy in her class who really likes her). Meanwhile her
younger sister, who constantly wears a tu-tu and dances around the house,
is the obvious favourite of Dawn's parents. This means that Dawn is often
ignored and given second preference to by her parents. This adds to her
unhappiness.</P>
<P>Welcome to the Dollhouse is a black comedy, and one often feels guilty for
laughing at Dawn's predicaments. All in all, it is a sad (yet somehow
funny), look at poor Dawn's life. One can't help but think that she could
get somewhere if she would just get a new wardrobe, new glasses, and a new
hairdo. However, if she did that, it would effectively be another
unrealistic, Hollywood-style film with a happy ending. I recommend this
film to anyone who enjoys black comedies, or who wants to be taken back to
the terrors of high school.</P>
