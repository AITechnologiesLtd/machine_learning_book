<P>Girl, Interrupted is, on the surface, every man's dream: a bunch of 
crazy 20-something girls in a never-ending pajama party. Susanna, the 
film's protagonist and narrator, questions early on "Have you ever 
confused a dream with life?" Don't make the error. Despite having an 
uplifting trailer that seems to hit on every joke that is scattered 
about the film, Girl, Interrupted is a real downer of a drama that will 
do little more than confuse any horny male-chauvinists who mistakenly 
wander into the production.</P>
<P>The establishing shot of the movie is one of prison-like bars that 
slowly pans to some girls. This sets the tone for a film that takes 
place in a mental institution where the key character isn't a patient, 
nurse or doctor but rather the building itself. Susanna (Winona Ryder in 
a decent but not standout performance) is pressured into checking 
herself into Claymoore for what she is told will be a short rest. Before 
long, she is diagnosed as having Borderline Personality Disorder in the 
pre-Prozac setting and finds herself staying a lot longer than she 
wishes.</P>
<P>Susanna's roommate is Georgina (Clea Duvall), a sweet, Wizard Of Oz 
obsessed pathological liar. Although the film doesn't explore her in 
depth, something that would be well worth the added time, Georgina is 
one of the most fascinating girls in the female-dominated movie. She is 
attractive, apparently friendly and seems to be totally innocuous. Yet 
she is in a mental institution and you find yourself questioning 
everything she says and, ultimately, wondering of her the same thing you 
wonder of many characters: is she really nuts?</P>
<P>Lisa (Angelina Jolie, who gives one of the finest female performances of 
1999 in her supporting role) has an in-your-face persona dominated by 
her escapes from the mental institution that one nurse (Whoopi Goldberg, 
who reprises her standard role as the caring mother figure) describes as 
"a five star hotel." It is apparent that Lisa is single-dimensionally 
psychotic, but you get a feeling that there might just be something more 
to her.</P>
<P>The other patients include a pampered girl who has sex with her father 
in exchange for rotisserie chicken, a burn victim with a profile ala Mel 
Gibson in The Man Without a Face and a bunch of overly nice nurses that 
subsequently lack credibility in fortunately limited roles.  </P>
<P>The story, based on Susanna Kaysen's best selling book of the same 
title, is more similar to The Graduate than other loony-bin films like 
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Susanna is like Benjamin Braddock in 
that she has no direction as she comes out of school and even has a 
sexual relationship (off screen) with one of her parents' friends. But 
unlike Benjamin, Susanna's parents give up on her almost altogether and 
she isn't nearly as naturally rebellious as Dustin Hoffman's landmark 
character.</P>
<P>The movie does venture slightly astray from Kaysen's book. For clearly 
dramatic purposes, Susanna finds herself in a creepy situation that she 
is only told about in the book. A pet cat that helps to define and 
humanize some characters is also added. And Susanna's life is only 
interrupted for one year here, compared to two in the book.</P>
<P>The film takes place in an era of Vietnam drafts, VW busses, RFK, MLK 
and Woodstock. A grade-A soundtrack is highlighted by pieces 
representative of the time including Bookends, Downtown, Time Has Come 
Today and The Weight. </P>
<P>Girl, Interrupted is definitely a film that holds its own. A solid 
setting, intriguing characters and the aforementioned tunes make the 
movie well worth while- as long as you can take a PJ party seriously.</P>
