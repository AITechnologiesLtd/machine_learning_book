<PRE>                                 STRIPTEASE
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>STRIPTEASE ** 1/4  Written and directed by Andrew Bergman from the 
novel by Carl Hiaasen. Photography, Stephen Goldblatt. Editing, Anne 
V.Coates. Production design, Mel Bourne. Costumes, Albert Wolsky.

Guilfoyle, Jerry Grayson, Rumer Willis, et al.  A Castle Rock release. 
115 minutes.  Rated R (stripping, language)</P>
<P>Occasionally, ignorance can be bliss. I have not read any books by 
Carl Hiaasen, so that I cannot join those who find "Striptease" vastly 
inferior to its course novel. I did find the early parts of the film 
fairly dull, but things picked up rather nicely and while the plotting 
and continuity were pretty incoherent, the movie was overall 
entertaining.</P>
<P>In  a Florida Court, divorcee Erin Grant (Demi Moore) is desperate.  
The judge gives custody of her little girl Angela (Rummer Willis, 
Demi's real life daughter) to husband Darrell who is scum and jobless. 
But the judge remembers Darrell's football-playing days. To appeal 
this decision, Erin needs money, so this ex-secretary at the FBI 
resorts to stripping at the Fort Lauderdale Eager Beaver topless bar.  </P>
<P>When outrageously dumb, horny and soused  Republican Congressman 
Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) watches Erin's convolutions on the stage, he 
wants her badly. He also gets into a fracas. Though incognito with wig 
and dark glasses, he is recognized by Jerry Killian, a regular who 
worships Erin. Killian plans to blackmail Dilbeck so as to have the 
Congressman help Erin's case. But Killian is found floating in the 
lake adjoining Detective Garcia's vacation cabin. From here on out the 
story involves the strippers, Darrell who is a dismissed FBI informer 
and wheels his daughter, all bandaged up, in wheelchairs to steal  
them  from hospitals and rest homes. Erin's efforts to get (by hook or 
crook) her daughter result in kidnapping. The venal Congressman who 
must be reelected to continue doing dirty work for a sugar company, 
keeps pursuing Erin, offering her two $2,000 for one hour's private 
striptease in the huge yacht of sugar barons (he ups the ante to 
$5,000 for Session Two). There is also the imposing, dignified 
African-American bar bouncer Shad (Ving Rhames),who is Erin's friend 
and self-appointed protector. (He has his own scheme of a fraudulent 
lawsuit that involves cockroaches in yogurt). </P>
<P>The gallery of characters includes the sugar people who run the 
Congressman,  watch him warily, provide thuggish bodyguards; Darrell's 
lowlife sister and her cop husband; and of course, the owner of The 
Eager Beaver, the strippers, a cute monkey, a predictable python, its 
unpredictable replacement, and so on. </P>
<P>Years ago, male audiences would  have flocked to see someone of  Demi 
Moore's stature "au naturel," and in general many people would have 
been shocked by the idea. Not today. Even so, those  patrons who do go 
for Moore voyeurism may be disappointed. Not because her callipygous, 
tirelessly exercised (and siliconed?) figure is not excellent, but 
because you only get few glimpses of it.  Furthermore, Moore's 
gyrations are athletic rather than erotic. As for the other strippers, 
they have a kind of inoffensive nudity, all in the line of duty.  </P>
<P>I don't know whether the book, reputedly quite funny, explored the 
issues of stiptease or viewed them from a pro-feminist point of view. 
The film does not. It merely goes its merry and outrageous way. Demi 
Moore, the central character, is a nice person whose main flaw is to 
have married so incongruously. She is sweet, educated and civilized. 
Why she took as a husband the  trashy, gross, illiterate hick Darrell 
is a mystery that nagged this viewer all through the film. </P>
<P>What, on the other hand, gives appeal to the movie, is that so many 
people in it are nice. Killian is nice. The strippers are nice. The 
club owner is nice. The big, muscular bouncer is very nice--to all 
those who are nice. Assante, who in some films can be overbearing or 
irritating, is also nice. What's more, no one is nice in a pointed, 
saccharine way.</P>
<P>The funny bits come mostly from the contrasts between the Nice and the 
Bad, the latter, of course being  Darrell and the Senator's entourage 
and patrons. Moore, rightly avoiding to do comedy, becomes, in a sense 
, the straightwoman  for Reynolds, who is making a real and comic 
comeback on the big screen. His exaggerated part goes beyond political 
satire and into outrageous lines, clownish appearance and behavior. 
It's hard to resist his absurdism, as when he goes from his room, 
where he is ridiculously undressed, vaselined and sniffing lint from 
the laundromat machine that  Moore had used,  to outside the room. He 
is correctly suited as he steps out among a banquet crowd of  Young 
Christians whom he addresses on family values. </P>
<P>Reviews of this film have been negative, partly, I think, because the 
movie doesn't warrant Moore's 12.5 million dollars paycheck. True 
enough, but if you ignore this outrage, the movie can be quite 
entertaining.</P>
