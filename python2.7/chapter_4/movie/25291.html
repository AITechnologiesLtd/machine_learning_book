<PRE>WINTER SLEEPERS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Look out Academy!  If writer/director Tom Tykwer ever comes out with a
film entitled THE GREATEST, it's a shoo-in to win the Oscar.</P>
<P>Last year, Tykwer burst onto the American scene to much acclaim with his
perfectly named RUN LOLA RUN, a movie which almost made my number one
choice for best movie of the year.  Exhilarating and exhausting,
watching it is like running a marathon and winning.  Three marathons to
be precise.</P>
<P>WINTER SLEEPERS, I am extremely sorry to report, is aptly named.
Viewing it is a perfect remedy for insomnia in winter or any other
season.  In RUN LOLA RUN, the dialog was fine but not particularly
important since it was the intensity of the action that carried the
movie.  WINTER SLEEPERS, on the other hand, has the actors babbling so
much drivel that it sometimes reminded me of the episodes of RBTV
(Really Bad TV) in the new picture, THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND
BULLWINKLE.</P>
<P>The story is set in a snowy Bavarian landscape that is made palpably
cold and stunningly beautiful by Frank Griebe's cinematography.  The
interior sequences, however, are as dull and uninteresting as the
exterior ones are magnificent.</P>
<P>One day, a ski instructor, Marco (Heino Ferch), comes racing up in his
new car to see his girlfriend, Rebecca (Floriane Daniel).  He's so in
the grips of love that he leaves the keys in his car and the door wide
open.  After having sex, he falls asleep.  When he wakes up, he finds
that his car has been stolen.  This sets off a small chain of events
that establishes the miniscule structure of the story.</P>
<P>Staying awake is hard during WINTER SLEEPERS and, in retrospect, not
especially necessary.  It is now clear why this earlier work of Tykwer's
did not find a United States distributor when it was initially released.
If the movie has an audience it is probably among film students looking
to see how successful directors develop their craft.  Certainly there
are a few undeniably effective touches in WINTER SLEEPERS that later
show up spectacularly in RUN LOLA RUN.  But, if you're not a film
student, there are many better movies more worth your time.</P>
<P>WINTER SLEEPERS runs a long 2:02.  The film is in German with English
subtitles.  It is not rated but would be R for sex, accident violence
and language and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
