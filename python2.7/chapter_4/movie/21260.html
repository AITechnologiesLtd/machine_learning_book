<P>Antonio Banderas' directorial debut is surprisingly solid as he
assembles an eclectic cast in an adaptation of Mark Childress' novel of
the same name.  Banderas has wisely chosen material that isn't
autobiographical for his first feature, eliminating concern that Crazy
in Alabama would be like the work of other actor-turned-directors, most
recently Frank Whaley's Joe the King. Alabama features two odd plots
that are tied together with a big courtroom finale and one central
character.</P>
<P>Set in the summer of 1965, Alabama is narrated by Peejoe (Lucas Black,
Slingblade) – short for Peter Joseph – a young boy in a small town that
still hasn't been notified of the Emancipation Proclamation.  As the
film opens, his oddball Aunt Lucille (Melanie Griffith, Another Day in
Paradise) tells Peejoe that she has killed her husband of thirteen years
and father of her seven children.  Lucille used rat poison to kill her
victim – because `that's what you use when you want to kill a rat' –
before decapitating him with an electric knife and leaving his remains
in a basement freezer as she squeals out of town to the strains of
`These Boots are Made for Walking.'  She is an aspiring actress who
dreams of landing a gig on Bewitched and heads for Los Angeles to pursue
her unlikely goal.</P>
<P>Peejoe, who had previously lived with his Aunt Lucille, is shipped off
to live with his Uncle Dove (David Morse, The Negotiator), a soft-spoken
funeral director.  As summer heats up, so does the tension in the still
racially segregated small town.  Peejoe witnesses the murder of a black
youth that had merely used the white-only pool facilities.  The fact
that the murder was committed by Sheriff John Doggett (Meat Loaf, Fight
Club) inspires Peejoe to speak out publicly about racial injustice.
Black couldn't look more like a hillbilly, but Peejoe has a perpetual
look of surprise when he watches the actions of his community.</P>
<P>Although the film seems a little choppy at first because of the
transition between the racism and Lucille plots, the picture is very
well paced.  One storyline takes a depressing look at an ugly portion of
American history and the other is almost like a fable, with Lucille
stealing a car in New Orleans, busting out of jail in Texas, breaking
the bank in Las Vegas and eventually hitting it big in Hollywood.  The
big courtroom finale that ties the two together is pretty well done,
with only Griffith's weepy monologue seeming a bit too much.  The judge
is played by Rod Steiger, who was either drunk or had never seen his
lines before.  Another possibility for his odd acting was that Banderas
filmed a rehearsal without Stieger's knowledge.</P>
<P>Griffiths does quite a decent job tackling the role of Lucille.  With
her long legs, black hair, big red lips and blue eyes she looks like she
could be the mother of Angelina Jolie and Charlize Theron, if they were
sisters (and wouldn't you have loved to live next door to that family).
Her Lucille is plagued by the voice of her decapitated husband
throughout the film, most likely on account of carrying his head around
in a hat box the entire time. Cathy Moriarty (Gloria), Richard Schiff
(The West Wing), John Beasley (The General's Daughter), Robert Wagner
(Austin Powers) and Noah Emmerich (The Truman Show) round out this
bizarre cast.</P>
<P>1:55 - PG-13 for violence, thematic material, language and adult
situations</P>
