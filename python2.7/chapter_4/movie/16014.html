<P>The only historical figure that has been written about more than William
Shakespeare is Jesus Christ, which explains why the Bard's materials are
such a popular source for remakes, revisions, rewrites, inspiration,
subtlety, credit, and dispute. Indeed, in recent years, American
contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of Shakespearean
products. Including this year's upcoming A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
Shakespeare's material has been the cause for twenty-six big screen
productions since 1990. But for a change of pace, MRS. BROWN director
John Madden gives us a story of the Bard himself in the wonderfully
vibrant SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. </P>
<P>Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard's story is largely fantasy, although as the
viewer soon learns, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is not a movie that takes itself
seriously. (Will Shakespeare of the 1590's would've been married to Anne
Hathaway, and he would've had a teenage daughter and two young sons;
here he is a bachelor played by Joseph Fiennes.) Will is a writer
struggling to come up with a great play, and his current comedy in the
works -- "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter" -- just doesn't quite
seem right. With the help of the great writer Christopher Marlowe
(Rupert Everett), and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman Viola
De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), he changes things around and writes one of
his greatest tragedies, "Romeo and Juliet."</P>
<P>The love story between Will and Viola loosely parallels the story of
Romeo and Juliet, to great effect. Fiennes and Paltrow develop a sexy
chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum; this
momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely
unsuccessful comedy. The supporting roles are well filled out, from
Geoffrey Rush as Will's worrisome agent, Philip, to Tom Wilkinson as the
producer Hugh Fennyman. Even Ben Affleck, leading the troupe of actors,
manages to make a favorable impression; and Judi Dench lends some brief
moments of screen time as Queen Elizabeth I. Gwyneth Paltrow is by far,
however, the standout of the lot, creating a large percentage of the
forementioned vibrance. </P>
<P>The story is well-crafted if nothing else, although it has dangerous
moments where it flirts with the "let's make a movie"-genre. The
dialogue is breezy and lighthearted, and certainly accessible by the
audience's lowest common denominator. There's something for everyone in
this romantic comedy, making it prime date flick material. Although
certainly not inspiring in any regard, it revels in a wholesome,
well-rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998's pictures;
the true-love story is one of the best around. Certainly recommendable
when the traditional slew of indifferent year's-open releases is just
around the corner.</P>
