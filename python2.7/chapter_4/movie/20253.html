<PRE>Here is a new review</PRE>
<PRE>As Long As They're Happy  (1955)</PRE>
<P>When American singing sensation Bobby Denver 'the crying crooner' (whose
tearful singing technique  has a traumatic effect on females, schoolgirls
and old ladies alike) arrives on the Queen Elizabeth to sing in London for
the first time, he stays at the home of stockbroker John Bentley at 35
Acacia Avenue, Wimbledon London SW19. His arrival has an amazing effect on
all females in the household, including his wife Stella (a former actress),
the maid Linda (who has the habit of fainting at the sight of Bobby), and
especially his three daughters:Patricia (a vivacious redhead, who with her
husband Peter, has adopted a bohemian lifestyle in Paris before she returned
to London, and frequently adopts yoga type postures), Corinne (an English
rose
type who returns to London from Texas with cowboy husband Barnaby, complete
with horse and full cowboy gear), and sixteen year old Gwen, who is
infatuated with Bobby, and declares that she is is in love with him. The
house is thrown into chaos, and John, who likes an orderly existence, seeks
the help of a crazy psychiatrist, Dr. Schneider, who labels crooners as
'cardboard lovers for frustrated wives' As a cure he invents a water cistern
which
he calls 'The Bobby Denver' to cure the girls of their obsession. By the end
of the film , Bobby Denver manages to reunite John and Stella and he also
causes Patricia and Peter to give up their bohemian lifestyle. Bobby also
reveals to Gwen the secret of his crying crooner technique (a hidden onion!)
together with the fact that he is married. Gwen, tearful,  exposes this to
the newpsapers,but it does Bobby no harm at all, for there is no such thing
as BAD publicity........</P>
<P>In hindsight, the British cinema of the 1950's can be seen as the golden age
of the formula film. The high spending (as well as the originality and
artistic experiment) of the 1940s, and later the 1960s,  were out of favour,
and the aim of Rank films of the 1950s was simply to produce quality popular
entertainment. This film, made in the middle of the decade, is a fine
example of a Rank Organisation Pinewood comedy, and it displays all the
confidence of the Rank Organisation in its fifties prime, the era of middle
class/middlebrow comedy, Rank starlets, fan magazines, glamour photographs,
Pinewood Garden parties, and a continuous output of films from the studio.
'As Long As They're Happy'  is even confident enough to have several
references to 'Mr Rank' in the script, at a time when JAR was still head of
production.....Even that leading member of the Rank 'family'of the 1950s
Norman Wisdom, appears at the door of the Bentley household at the end of
the film, and just has time to sing his signature number 'Don't Laugh at me,
Cause I'm a Fool'. and the film ends with Gwen switching her devotion from
Bobby Denver to Norman, who she calls 'Darling'..............</P>
<P>Bobby Denver is played by Jerry Wayne (a star of the 1950's West End
production of Guys and Dolls (from which, incidentally, he recorded four
songs, on two Philips 78s) who has a strong attractive vioce. The Bobby
Denver character is, of course is a direct satire on the early 1950s cult of
real life American sobbing crooner Johnny Ray, and the film even features
one of his greatest hits 'Cry'. It is also full of many other 1950's
references: Marlon Brando, Gene Kelly, 1950's existentialists/bohemians in
Paris  (See Funny Face (1956) for more satire on this topic), Abbott and
Costello, Frankie Laine, Billy Daniels The Embassy Club, Val Parnell
presents at the London Hippodrome, aa well as several references to 'Mr
Rank'.
It has a witty screenplay by Alan Melville, adapted from the hit West End
comedy of the same name by Vernon Sylvaine, with jokes about popular/
highbrow culture (a symphony by Picasso etc.).
It has a nice satire on Americans in England. At his London press
conference, Bobby says: 'I want to see something of your wonderful country:
London, Stratford, Scotland - towns like that'.........
The three daughters are played by Jeannie Carson,(Patricia) a vivacious
redhead, who is slightly older, more cool towardas Bobby Denver. She has
intellectual petensions, but is persuaded to give them up, and we last see
her husband Peter wearing a city suit, and seeking a respectable career in
'insurance'- something about the triumph of 1950s values here, I think.....
Susan Stephen (as Corin) is cast again as the perfect 'English Rose' type,
and Janette Scott plays Gwen, sixteen years old, impressionable and most
infatuated with Bobby Denver.  She has a
lovely scene with Bobby where she keeps calling him 'darling'.
The supporting cast of this film is also wonderful. Many fondly remembered
1950s faces make brief appearances in cameo roles: Richard Wattis (backstage
at the theatre), Dora Bryan (as the girl in a lift who wants to swap Billy
Daniels bow tie for Frankie Laine's trouser buttons), Joan Hickson (as a
barmaid), Athene Syler (as the neighbour), Nigel Green (nicely playing
Peter- a very 1950s bearded bohemian type who arrives at the Bentley house
demanding 'Where's my Woman?'),Diana Dors as 'actress' (or'brazen huzzy' as
Stella calls her) Pearl Delaney, is at her most voluptuous, as she performs
'Come Do the Hokey-Pokey Polka', and  1950s BBC television personality
Gilbert Harding also appears. There is a 1950's in joke here (which may be
lost on today's audiences): Gilbert Harding, against his better judgement,
cannot hold back the tears during Bobby's singing at the London Hippodrome.
A  little old lady sitting next to him (played by Edie Martin from "The
Ladykillers") says to Gilbert:
'Do you dig him?'
Gilbert tartly replies :
'I'd bury him'
Little Old Lady:
'You rude man'.
Other members of the audience include Ronnie Stevens (From the 'Dentist'
films, George Minter's response to the successful Doctor comedies) as an
fanatical Bobby Denver fan with a nasty cold, and a super cameo by besotted
fan Charles Hawtrey, who says of Bobby Denver:
'He's wonderful, man- I DIG him!'
Other future 'Carry On' stars appearing include Joan Sims (as Linda, the
fainting maid) and Hattie Jacques (in the party scene).</P>
<P>The songs (by Sam Coslow, except the final one) are all attractive, mainly
in the style of 1950s ballads.They are: You Started Something (Jerry Wayne)
(JW); Quiet Little Rendevous (Jeannie Carson) (JC); I Love the Morning (Jack
Buchanan); I Don't Know whether to Laugh or to Cry Over You (JW); The light
that Lies in Liza's Eyes(JW); Crazy Little Mixed Up Heart (JC); Cry(JW); Be
My Guest(JW); Come Do The Hokey-Pokey Polka (Diana Dors); Cry (Reprised by
Jack Buchanan at the party  in a very low vocal register); I Hate the
Morning (Reprise)(JB); I Don't Know whether to Laugh or to Cry Over You
(JB), and 'Don't Laugh at Me 'cause I'm a Fool' (Norman Wisdom)
The choreography for two staged numbers is by Paddy Stone and Irving Davies.
'Crazy Little Mixed Up Heart' is performed by Jeannie Carson and relates to
her relationship with Peter. It commences with Jeannie leaning on a tree and
moves into a fantasy dance sequence which starts on a park ride with Paddy
Stone (with beard) and Irving Davies, with all dressed in white.  They also
staged 'I Don't Know whether to Laugh or to Cry Over You' (as it is
performed by Jack Buchanan at the end of the film, with a brief solo dance
by Jack, who is then joined in an up tempo jazzy routine by the maid, Joan
Sims). In this sequence, there is a wonderful moment when JB picks the
telephone and says, 'Gene Kelly Speaking'.......JB displays masterful comic
timing throughout. He ia most ably partnered by Brenda de Banzie, as Stella,
an ex-actress, who 'longs to return to the theatre' She is the perfect foil
for Jack Buchanan, as she overdramatises, quoting lines fron Hedda Gabler on
her return to the house, as Jack's 'party' is in full swing. Her tone of
voice perfactly matches his and their scenes together are a delight,
especially the scene at the end, where timing an delivery are perfect.
This is an exceptionally good natured entertaining comedy, finely played by
an excellent cast. It ia also attractively mounted, although the television
copy (from Eastman Colour) was not in particularly good shape, being a
little faded in parts.
Interestingly, Bobby's TV show in the film is in colour (in 1955 ! in
England !).     Filmed at Pinewood.</P>
