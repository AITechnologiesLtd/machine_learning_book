<PRE>                                 HOT SHOTS
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1991 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>[The names on the From:- and by-lines are correct; this is by a family
member of the account owner.  -Moderator]</P>
<P>90 min, PG-13, Comedy, 1991
Director: Jim Abrahams
Cast: Charlie Sheen, Cary Elwes, Valeria Golino, Jon Cryer,
      Lloyd Bridges, Kristy Swanson, Bruce A. Young</P>
<P>Synopsis: Hot-shot Sheen was kicked out of the Air Force when he
endangered another recruit.  The Air Force goes to the Indian
reservation he is now living at to ask him to come back.  On his way
back to the Air Force base he sees Golino.  He falls in love with her
but she is currently seeing another man in the Air Force.  Sheen makes
it to the Air Force base where personnel are being briefed on the next
assignment.  Some of the men want Sheen taken off the mission because he
is a hot shot.  An evil organization wants to keep Sheen on the mission
to make the Air Force look bad.  Sheen tries to win over Golino in his
spare time.</P>
<P>      The film is rated PG-13 for explicit language, adult situations,
violence, and adult humor.</P>
<P>      Sorry it took so long to get this film review out.  I saw HOT
SHOTS on its opening night and I have not had time since then to do the
review on it.   I recommend running out to the theater to see it, while
it is still there, if you liked THE NAKED GUN 2-1/2 as it is much in the
same style.  This was written by Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft (who wrote
for the "Police Squad!" television series).  The director, Abrahams, has
also done the slapstick films AIRPLANE! and TOP SECRET!.  If you liked
either of these films I recommend seeing this film.  This is unlike
Abrahams' more recent comedies like WELCOME HOME ROXY CARMICHAEL and BIG
BUSINESS.  I give this film a four on a zero to five scale.</P>
<PRE>      In short, go see the film in the theater, or if you miss it in the
theater be sure not to miss it on video.</PRE>
<P>      Most of the scenes shown in the advertisements for the movie
happen during the credits (e.g., the man roasting his hot dog in the
jet's after-burner).  In the next ninety minutes the jokes come one
after another.   Lloyd Bridges (who was also in AIRPLANE! and the not
as good sequel AIRPLANE 2: THE SEQUEL) plays the commander of the
mission.  As we find out by the end of the film (and had probably
guessed earlier) Bridges has had most of his body replaced with metal,
from accidents in the war, which leads to 1/3 of the jokes.  Some of
these may start to wear on you though.  Half of the comedy in the film
is based on Charlie Sheen and Cary Elwes both fighting over Valeria
Golino.  Sheen and Golino have what may be the most interesting sex
scene in movie history, the two of them and an array of vegetables.</P>
