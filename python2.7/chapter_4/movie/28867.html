"You might try to kill me."
"I'm not gonna kill you!"
"I said you'd try."</PRE>
<P>Starring Angelina Jolie, Noah Taylor, Iain Glen,
Daniel Craig, Chris Barrie, John Voight. Directed by
Simon West. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>The official title of this long-awaited video game
adaptation is Lara Croft Tomb Raider. Just like that.
No punctuation, not even a comma or a colon. It's a
bad omen; fortunately, it's just about the only
sloppiness you'll see in this sleek, almost
embarassingly entertaining summer blockbuster. The
critics ripped the movie apart, but it's a great
time-waster, perfect for taking in casually on a
Saturday afternoon and forgetting an hour later. And
I'm a sucker for completely gratuitous shower scenes,
especially if the showeree is the likes of Angelina
Jolie. Sue me.</P>
<P>The plot is nonsense about a fight for 2 pieces of
some mysterious talisman that, at the appropriate
planetary alignment that only occurs every 5000 years
or so, will give its possessor the power to change the
fabric of space and time. Or something like that. Lara
Croft, a famous Tomb Raider (the movie never defines
exactly what a "Tomb Raider" is), is saddled with the
task of stopping the Illuminati, a secret organization
of shady old men, from obtaining the parts of the
triangle. Her opponent: the suave, evil, Manfred
Powell (Iain Glenn), who is committed to giving the
Illuminati what they want. Working with Powell is Alex
West (Daniel Craig), also a Tomb Raider and,
apparently, Lara's former love interest.</P>
<P>This is silly, of course, but you can follow it --
which is much more than can be said for the
inexplicably better-reviewed Swordfish -- and all
that's left to do after that is watch Jolie fire
multiple guns at a time at weird robot-like creatures.
The subject matter here is mythical mumbo-jumbo, but
director Simon West (Con Air) makes an interesting
decision: instead of approaching it with the childlike
awe of The Mummy, he treats it with a sort of
ultra-hip indifference. Jolie has a constant smirk on
her face and so, it seems, does the director; the
movie doesn't make fun of the plot or acknowledge its
prepostrousness, but it sort of dismisses its own
story as just another day in the life of Lara Croft.</P>
<P>The action sequences are fluid and exciting, and the
special effects don't call attention to themselves.
I'm not a big fan of the climax, which is a bit too
goofy even for my tastes, but everything that precedes
it is good fun. To risk overreaching, Jolie may be the
best action heroine I've ever seen; she's confident
and comfortable with the material, either overcoming
or just plain ignoring the bombshell status placed on
her. She doesn't have much dialogue and she doesn't
need any; the movie avoids making an embarassment of
itself by keeping it to a minimum.</P>
<P>There's a subplot involving Lara Croft's father
(played by Jolie's real father, Jon Voight) that works
to provide motivation for a crucial decision Croft
makes in the climax. None of it is meant to be taken
seriously, of course, and there's no pathos to speak
of, but it's good to see the history of the character
mentioned (Mummy's Rick O'Connell seems to have popped
out of nowhere).</P>
<P>In a summer when a surprising amount of big-budget
movies are just plain clunky, Tomb Raider is
well-made, confident and entertaining
through-and-through. People have harangued it for
being pointless, but what's the point of such an
argument against a movie like this? </P>
