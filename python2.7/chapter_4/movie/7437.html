<PRE>                       CHILDREN OF THE REVOLUTION
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>While it is being billed as a "black Red" comedy, it is, despite some
funny moments, more of a black Red satire than comedy.  For those like
writer-director Peter Duncan's father, a card-carrying Communist who
never was able to believe the horror stories about Stalin, this film
will be most difficult.  But for the rest of the world, the film's
story is indeed way out, as satire should be, and fiercely
entertaining at the same time.  This, in large part, is due to the
fabulous actors who bring the movie to life.</P>
<P>Heading the cast is Joan Fraser (Judy Davis) as the Australian Red
revolutionary whose whole life in 1949 is the Party.  She is an
activist who brooks no diversion from her party line as she sees it and
"knows" one day her communists will take over Australia.  She is
enthralled with her leader and writes to Stalin (F Murray Abraham) to
tell him she is his Australian right arm.  One day she is surprised to
receive an invitation to visit him in the Kremlin..</P>
<P>Things really take off when she spends the night with Stalin and he
suffers a fatal heart attack but not before Joan has become
pregnant.  Back home again, she induces her husband (Geoffrey Rush)
to never reveal he is not the father.  Little Joe (Richard Roxburgh)
will grow up.  A mother's dream come true . . . a little
revolutionist . . . or so you would think. . . while the film takes a
new and exciting turn.  You have never seen anything like it.</P>
<P>Also supporting the cast is Sam Neill who despite a wealth of roles is
probably best remembered as the paleontologist in Jurassic Park.</P>
<P>Written and Directed by Peter Duncan.</P>
