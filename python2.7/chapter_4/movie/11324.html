<PRE>                             THE APOSTLE
                    A film review by Frank Ochieng</PRE>
<P>starring: Robert Duvall, John Beasley, Farrah Fawcett, June Carter,
Billy Bob Thornton, Miranda Richardson
Director: Robert Duvall</P>
<P>   Oscar-winning actor Robert Duvall has directed, produced, and wrote
what very well may be the most intensifying, gut-wrenching, powerful
and complexed movies that has hit the big screen in ages in that of
THE APOSTLE, a poignant and perplexing portrayal of a man who finds
solace with God despite his own questionable weakness and peace of
mind. This riveting examination of an evangelical preacher Euliss
"Sonny" Dewey asks some bold questions about this tremendously flawed
human being: can a man who is supposed to represent the Almighty also
tackle his own demons?</P>
<P>     Duvall does an incredible job at introducing us to this paradoxical
preacher--a man who consistently battles his instincts, sexual urges,
convictions, and anger. Preacher Dewey is a problematic yet passionate
pariah who needs guidance but is willing to smother this feeling and
become a representative of God, therefore avoiding a cataclysmic
conflict within his own personal pain. A brilliant turn that has
landed Duvall his 1997 best actor National Society of Film Critics
credentials. And thank goodness Duvall and his movie can qualify for
Academy Award consideration for this year because this film definitely
deserves the recognition of being considered one of the best offerings
to potentially be honored.</P>
<P>     Duvall's Preacher Dewey is a lovable soul but his human heart
becomes congested when rage takes over after he discovers his wife
(Farrah Fawcett) and her young lover "in cahoots" with one another.
Disgruntled by the whole affair, Dewey--with the help of a baseball
bat and blatant jealousy, lands his wife's boy-toy in a serious coma.
With this act, Preacher Dewey has no choice but to move on and
discover an odyssey of peace and serenity that will compensate his
desirous and disastrous demons. Coming across a new path of sorts,
Sonny Dewey deems himself "The Apostle" and eventually teams up with a
black preacher (John Beasley) to help collaborate on building a new
church called "The One Way Road To Heaven". Now, The Apostle has
mostly black churchgoers who follow him and is eventually caught up in
the gospel high-spirited soul of these folks' religious rituals. He
actually cares and relishes his black congregation to the point that
he even challenges the racist antics of a passerby (Billy Bob
Thornton). The Apostle even has moments of wooing a separated married
woman (Miranda Richardson) and has no moral qualms about satisfying
that pleasure either.</P>
<P>      This film doesn't ask for sympathy for its complicated
protagonist in that of Sonny Dewey, a.k.a The Apostle, because it's a
much better movie than that. Instead, this film reinforces the notion
that man's consciousness is his own guidance and that he has the power
to choose what to do with it. Whether his intentions are disguised to
suit his soul or give credence to his ambiguous actions, the courage
for man to live and confront his moral code and human decency is
extensively demonstrated in this magnificent movie. What Robert Duvall
accomplished with THE APOSTLE is a brimstone of bravura that will
certainly show just how significant a breakthrough this film really
is! THE APOSTLE is an opulent, natural high!</P>
<PRE>Frank rates this film: ****stars
