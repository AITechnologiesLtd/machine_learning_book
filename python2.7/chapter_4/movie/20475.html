<PRE>Love Stinks
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) LOVE STINKS is the Antichrist of romantic comedies.
It's a "guy" movie, but it follows some of the rules of chick flicks.
What it does with them, though, is push them through a bitter, black
filter. The result is either an incomprehensible mess, or revenge for
FIRST WIVES' CLUB, depending on your point of view.</P>
<P>I am ashamed to admit that I thought this movie was funny. Immediately
after it was over, my wife said she thought it deserved the lowest
rating possible, and I overheard another woman on the phone tell a
friend that it was "not very good." On the other hand, several men in
the theater hooted at all the right moments, and I found myself laughing
along with them.</P>
<P>Why be ashamed to laugh at a comedy? Why do men and women react
differently? Because the "villain" (Chelsea, played by Bridgette Wilson)
is the embodiment of a stereotype: a matrimony-obsessed, man-trapping
woman. I feel guilty because I'm a sensitive man who should be above
such an immature view of women. (But then I also like Beavis and
Butt-Head, so I guess I'm not as sensitive or mature as I thought.)</P>
<P>Chelsea is a neurotic FEMME FATALE who aims to either marry Seth (French
Stewart) or kill him trying. Think of Glenn Close in BASIC INSTINCT, but
less psychotic and more comedic, and you'll start to get an idea of who
she is. Admittedly, she's not a very well-rounded character. She's more
a situation than a person.</P>
<P>Seth is a sitcom writer living in a bachelor-pad wasteland. He's not
looking for a new girlfriend, but when he sees Chelsea, he becomes
infatuated. He dumps his current girlfriend to go out with the new one.</P>
<P>Chelsea is a decorator and "professional bridesmaid," as she likes to
say (they met at a friend's wedding). But as soon as she's in Seth's
life, she gives it all up to be his personal decorator and stay-at-home
girlfriend.</P>
<P>The movie follows their progress as a couple, through the tumultuous
saying of "I love you" to talking about children. Through bickering and
fighting to serious discussions about marriage. Through it all (and with
the help of the narrator), you can see the subtle manipulative
implementation of Chelsea's scheme to win Seth's hand.</P>
<P>Eventually, Seth decides he'd rather not be with Chelsea. But somehow,
she manages to keep him living under the same roof. Pretty soon they are
engaged - in an all-out War of the Roses. (God help me for saying it,
but this movie actually has a funny fart joke.)</P>
<P>But in spite of my amusement, I will not recommend it. Some of the
bigger problems are that Seth and Chelsea's friends (Tyra Banks, Bill
Bellamy) are too similar and badly developed. They could have provided
some sort of grounded contrast to the exaggerated love/hate. Instead,
they are almost exact duplicates of the main couple. Also, some of the
jokes are uninspired and cheap, like Seth's fascination with Elvis, or
Chelsea's devotion to her cat. Worst of all is the utter
two-dimensionality of most of the characters, including all of the
women.</P>
<P>LOVE STINKS fills a niche that is so far pretty empty. It's an inverted
chick-flick. It's a romantic comedy for cynical men. That probably makes
it dumber and meaner than a lot of other movies. If you go, don't laugh.
And if you laugh, don't say I sent you.</P>
