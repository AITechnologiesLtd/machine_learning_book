PHILADELPHIA
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>There are many movies that are remembered for the wrong
reasons, and PHILADELPHIA, 1993 courtroom drama directed by
Jonathan Demme, is one of them. Instead being remembered by
its own merit, it is only a footnote in a tale about moving
1994 Oscar acceptance speech by Tom Hanks - occasion that
inspired a movie by itself (IN & OUT by Frank Oz). And it is
really sad, since PHILADELPHIA happened to be the very first
big budget Hollywood movie dealing with the AIDS phenomenon.
It was also an opportunity for Demme to defend himself from
homophobia charges, inspired by the fact that some gay
groups didn't like the sexual orientation of the villain in
his Oscar-winning masterpiece SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.</P>
<P>This courtroom drama has a plot which is based on the real
life event (the fact which the filmmakers at first denied,
which, ironically, caused a lawsuit later on). Andrew
Beckett (played by Tom Hanks) is a young and brilliant
attorney who had just received a promotion in a prestigious
Philadelphia law firm, led by his bigoted mentor Charles
Wheeler (played by Jason Robards). In the same day, Beckett,
who was hiding his homosexuality from co-workers and
supervisors, finds out that he had contracted AIDS. Soon,
important legal brief vanishes from his possession and he is
fired from the law firm because of alleged incompetence.
Beckett knows that the real reason is homophobia, so he is
ready to start discrimination lawsuit. Unfortunately, few
lawyers are ready to take his case. The only exception is
Joe Miller (played by Denzel Washington), black ambulance
chaser who must overcome his own homophobic prejudices
before he begins long legal battle.</P>
<P>Made during the zenith of Political Correctness, in the
first year of Clinton presidency, PHILADELPHIA, like many
similar "socially conscious" movies, walks on the very fine
line between art and propaganda. The screenplay by Ron
Nyswaner almost pushes movie across that line, with
sometimes annoyingly clear contrast between Good Guys
(young, beautiful, talented and heroic gay character plus
his slowly evolving attorney) and Bad Guys (old, ugly and
bigoted establishment). The attempts to paint some shades of
gray (like the scene with the young black gay man and
Miller) look somewhat artificial and sometimes it provide
unnecessary plot holes. However, this movie is saved by
great directorial skill by Demme and great acting
performances. Demme, with his superb techniques, small
gestures and great use of close-ups allows us to see the
plot and characters through banal but all-revealing scenes,
like the accidental encounter between Beckett and Miller in
the library. The actors, on the other hand, are stealing the
show - Tom Hanks won his first "Oscar", and his portrayal of
AIDS-stricken man with the passion for life and justice is
touching and magnificent in the same time (although some
would see his opera singing scene as an emotional overkill).
Hanks should also be praised for the great physical effort,
because he went on a diet and lost 12 kilograms in order to
physically resemble terminally ill AIDS patient as much as
possible. His partner Denzel Washington is great too,
although his role didn't require such demanding physical
requirements. Instead, his character transformation from the
bigot into the compassionate human being is portrayed with
subtle but very effective actions (like, for example,
different levels of physical distance between Beckett and
Miller). Other actors are, on the other hand, underused -
Jason Robards' character is caricature, Mary Steenburgen as
his attorney is capable, and Antonio Banderas is totally
wasted as Beckett's lover.</P>
<P>Although Demme's good intentions and his talent should be
praised, they aren't enough to make PHILADELPHIA truly
exceptional piece of cinema. For the movie that was supposed
to be the groundbreaking Hollywood project about AIDS,
bigotry and alternative lifestyles, this film is too
mainstream and constrained by the content regulations - both
the old (which bar kissing between males in mainstream
films) and new (which prohibits portrayal of gay characters
as nothing less of saintly). Being exposed to the multitude
of independent, cable or even TV-movies that, one way or the
other, broke such rules, we must conclude that PHILADELPHIA
didn't pass the test of time, necessary to achieve the true
greatness. But, although overrated, PHILADELPHIA is still a
good film.</P>
