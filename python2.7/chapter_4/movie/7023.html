<P>Last year's winner of the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay went to THE
USUAL SUSPECTS (an award I was hoping would go to SMOKE, but that wasn't
even nominated). This film has an impressive run of dialogue and is
well-acted, but in my opinion the story suffers from a serious defect. It
seems the story exists only to set up the audience for the twist at the
film's end, which by now I'm sure many of you have seen. The sequence is
certainly exciting and it is interesting to watch it unfold, but when it
is finished, what do you have? Nothing, which can only mean that the story
was a perfunctory step on the way to the 'cool idea' that McQuarrie had
for an ending. A true use of a twist (or twists) that exist in service the
story is CHINATOWN.  "...my sister, my daughter, my sister and my
daughter!"  Each surprising turn moves you closer to opening up the heart
of the story, instead of devoiding it of worth. And that is what THE USUAL
SUSPECTS did. It essentially said, "most of what you have just seen was a
lie."  In my opinion, that is nearly as bad as the "it was all a dream"
bit used most notably in NORTH. This is something I refer to as cinematic
suicide. However, this in no way compares to my disdain over the fact that
the story existed only for the sake of the twist/ending.</P>
<P>This film was directed much in the same manner by which it was written. 
Bryan Singer is the type of director that would be described as
stylistic.  I put him in the same league as someone like Michael Bay who
has brought us the likes of BAD BOYS and THE ROCK. Both of these directors
are out to prove that they can do 'cool shots', plain and simple. It's the
Tony Scott brand of filmmaking. An example of Bryan Singers work in THE
USUAL SUSPECTS would be the matching dissolve he performs from the
circular cave scene at the beach to a coffee mug. What was the reasoning
for this, you ask?  What motivated the apparent relationship between that
scene and the coffee mug? Nothing. There is no relationship. Perhaps if
the scene at the cave had a strong relation to the man, Kobayashi, which
we eventually learn is actually written on the bottom of the coffee mug,
there would have been a valid reason for the dissolve.  However, the only
motivating factors were that they were both round and that Singer thought
the dissolve would look neat. Bryan Singer's stylistic approach to
filmmaking is about the most superficial I've ever scene--second only to
Michael Bay's.</P>
<P>Now, the actor's performances are something to behold. Kevin Spacey
(GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS) won an Academy Award for this role and he is a very
good character actor. Although, I think he's done a few other films in
which he was even more deserving of the award. Gabriel Byrne (MILLER'S
CROSSING) perfectly underplays his character as a thoughtful man who seems
uninterested by what happens around him until it directly affects him. The
rest of the cast performs together well with one exception. Kevin Pollak
(A FEW GOOD MEN) does not have a hold on his character at all. He seems to
be trying to do a tough guy, but he comes across as, in all honesty, like
he's acting like a tough guy. He's done better work before and this hit me
as a surprise.</P>
<P>Anyway, you'll either love or hate this film--there's no middle ground
because there is very little depth here. I'd say it has about as much
depth as PULP FICTION, which I liked because it was about its characters,
not the technique. This is also the only film that a certain friend of
mine and I disagree on. He called it 'refreshing'. I call it a gimmick. </P>
