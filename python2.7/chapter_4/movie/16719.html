<PRE>REVIEW 'Antz' </PRE>
<PRE>Rated PG, 1998
zero star
by Matthew (<A HREF="mailto:Sidney785@aol.com">Sidney785@aol.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>I walked into the theater knowing what I was getting into.  A cartoon about
talking ants.  But, I was forced into it.  What else were you suppost to take
an 8-year old to?  I am sorry to say I ever joined forces with that 8-year old
on that unfaithful day.</P>
<P>I was right.  I hated every minute of Antz, a film from the animation
department of DreamWorks, a newly developed studio headed by Steven Spielberg, 
who have put out such wonderful films as Saving Private Ryan and Deep Impact. 
But, you can't win 'em all, right?</P>
<P>With the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Sly Stallon and Gene Hackman
completely wasted, a film like Antz must pay.</P>
<P>The story is a yawner, the voices, especially Stone, are dead, and the
production values (i.e. the drawings, whatever) are poorly executed.  Toy Story
(1996), a Disney film, did it much better.</P>
<P>Jaw-droppingly bad, Antz is now the No. 1 film, in my book, to be awarded zero
stars (on a scale of 1 to 5).  Its runner's up include the awful Tetsuo: The
Iron Man and Crater Lake Monster.</P>
<P>Please, spare humanity Antz II, for the love of God!</P>
<PRE>***** a classic  **** excellent  *** good  ** fair  * poor</PRE>
