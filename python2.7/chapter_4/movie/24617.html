<PRE>                             GLADIATOR
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The sand-and-sandal epic film
          returns to the screen with a tale of one of the
          less familiar Caesars, the Emperor Commodus.
          Ridley Scott plays with the genre by adding
          surrealistic images and annoyingly tampers with
          the visuals digitally to throw the viewer off
          balance.  It is original, but the film works in
          spite of his enhancements rather than because of
          them.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to +4)
          Note: some discussion of the historical accuracy
          follows the main review.  It has spoilers.</PRE>
<P>     It has been many years since we have had a film about ancient
Rome of the sort we have gotten from Ridley Scott, and in some ways
we have never had a film like this.  This is a sort of post-modern
ancient Rome.  I expected to love the giant battle scenes.  But they
start early in the film and my eye kept rebelling at what it was
seeing.  Something was wrong with the images I was seeing.  Scott
has always played with his visual images.  He used to shoot through
incense to create an odd filtered effect.  In GLADIATOR he was doing
a lot more.  I cannot authoritatively say what Scott was doing but
it looked like images in the background were filmed normally, images
in the foreground were moving more jerkily.  I could be wrong, but
it seemed that instead of the foreground images being different each
frame, they were kept on the screen for a count of two or perhaps
even three frames each.  This is impossible to do with normal
filming but it is quite possible with digital processing of images.
For me the irritation is about the same as if there was a buzz on
the soundtrack.  I suppose Scott may have felt that it enhanced the
mythic effect.  Time and again images in the film felt like they had
been tampered with and were somehow off-kilter.  Perhaps I was
over-sensitive, but it was an annoyance that just had to be ignored.</P>
<P>     Of course, Ridley Scott does odd experiments with the visuals.
In this film he frequently plays with fog or smoke.  Other times he
uses backgrounds that look more like postcards than reality.  The
film is heavy on sunrises and sunsets.  Other scenes play with
color.</P>
<P>     The film covers the same historic interval and figures as THE
FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE (1964) and some of the incidents of this
film are borrowed from that rather than history.  Even the fictional
character Livius in the 1964 was carried over as the hero Maximus.
The emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) is off in snowy
Germania where he is in the last stages of victory over the
barbarians.  His general Maximus (Russell Crowe) is "unleashing
hell" against the last stronghold of resistance.  Unleashing hell is
releasing the kind of power one probably would have thought required
modern weapons.  The scene fully justifies the fear that most of the
world at that time had of the Romans.  But the most powerful
position in the known world is about to change hands.</P>
<P>     Philosopher and gentle soul Marcus Aurelius wants to restore
the Republic that Julius Caesar abolished.  He knows his son
Commodus is too anxious for power to restore the republic so Marcus
plans to name Maximus as his successor, entrusting him to return the
republic.  But when Marcus breaks this news to Commodus, Commodus
murders his father.  To complete the task he also has a contingent
of men take Maximus to be murdered and another to kill his family.
The general does not die so easily, however.  The attempt to kill
Maximus only leaves him wounded and wandering, then collected as a
slave.  The slave is purchased by a wise old gladiator-turned-
freeman and gladiator-dealer Proximo (Oliver Reed in his last and
probably best role).  The gladiator, now called "the Spaniard" is
sent to Rome to fight before Emperor Commodus, where he hopes he may
work his revenge.  Tired of the war, tired of seeing death, and
disillusioned about the causes he has fought for, the gladiator is
sent to Rome to fight and die in front of audiences anxious to see
death.</P>
<P>     The plot borrows from THE TEN COMMANDMENTS the ruler who
creates jealousy in his son by choosing another as an heir.  It
borrows from BEN HUR the blood feud of old close friends.  There is
even a line borrowed from THE UNTOUCHABLES.  Of course, there is a
lot of SPARTACUS and THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.  The major plot
elements are not new.  But most of what is borrowed is from films of
the last generation.  And some of what is new, like the Ken-
Russell-style surrealistic scenes, seems far more out of place than
they would seem in a film of modern setting.</P>
<P>     Ridley Scott is a reasonable action director with a good feel
for integrating actors with special visual effects.  Somehow Russell
Crowe seems out of place in an ancient setting.  It took a while to
get used to him.  Joaquin Phoenix is actually a little too dignified
and reserved the psychotic Commodus.  For once an actor could have
chewed the scenery and been more faithful to the history books.  It
seems almost cliche to say that an actor who died in the production
gave one of his best performances, but it is true of Oliver Reed who
finally has overcome the stiffness of his earlier acting.  Connie
Nielsen as Lucilla is appealing, though it is a little strange to
see the demure actress cast in the role that in 1964 went to Sophia
Loren.  Derek Jacobi plays a Senator trying to preserve the Senate.
The score by Hans Zimmer is not one of his most memorable.  He is
quick to capitalize on a minor location in Africa, probably because
the LION KING composer is not known for his German or Latin musical
themes.</P>
<P>     With a few reservations for Scott's visual style this is
pleasant return of a type of film we have not seen made since the
60s.  I rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
<PRE>     Note on historical accuracy:</PRE>
<P>     This film grossly misrepresents the Emperor Commodus whose
actual wacko quotient rivaled Caligula's and Nero's.  The real
Commodus renamed the months of the year to be his twelve titles so
that he might be worshipped each month.  He renamed Rome "The Colony
of Commodus."  He identified himself with Hercules and he would
dress for the role in lion skins and would beat prisoners to death
with a large wooden club.  He would fight in amphitheater as a
gladiator, but would give his opponent a nearly useless lead sword.
Commodus would slaughter animals in the ring, including elephants
and giraffes.  He would behead ostriches with arrows headed with
crescent razors.  All this could have been shown in GLADIATOR and
would have been quite cinematic.  Instead he is reserved and almost
dignified.  As Roman Emperors go, Commodus as portrayed in GLADIATOR
might almost have been respectable.</P>
<P>     It should be noted Commodus showed far more tolerance of
Christians than his father Marcus Aurelius had.  His motives are
open to speculation.</P>
<P>     Eventually those closest to him grew tired of living in the
fear of his capricious displeasure and the immediate death that
might follow.  A conspiracy, likely headed by his mistress Marcia,
poisoned his drink one day on his return from hunting.  When he fell
asleep rather than dying a young wrestler, Narcissus, strangled him
without him resisting.</P>
<P>     Both GLADIATOR and THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, however, have
him die in a dramatic sword fight with the former general of the
German campaign.  In both that general was also a former friend of
Commodus favored for emperor by Marcus Aurelius over Commodus.
Actually Marcus Aurelius had publicly named Commodus his heir and
there is not likely to be any historic record that Marcus favored
anyone else.</P>
<P>     As has been pointed out in the arena the signals were not
thumbs up or thumbs down, it was thumb hidden in fist for life,
thumb sticking out for death.  But the first responsibility of the
director is to communicate hat is going on.  The actors are speaking
English, but they have to speak the audience's language.  The
audience knows thumbs up and thumbs down.</P>
<P>     So there are inaccuracies, but if one waits to the end of the
credits the film clearly says that some of the characters are real
but that the story is fiction.  With that in mind the accuracy of
this film is not at all bad.</P>
