                              AMADEUS 1984
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
              2 :- ) :-)  for creating musical masterpieces</PRE>
<P>Cast: Tom Hulce, F. Murray Abraham, Elizabeth Berridge, Jeffrey Jones,
written by Peter Shaffer, directed by Milos Forman.</P>
<P>'ha Ha HA HA Ha ha' What a laugh. Who would have guessed that Mozart
alias 'Wolfy' would be as jovial, irreverent and light hearted as this
movie has made him out to be. I mean being German and a composer, and
creating such operatic masterpieces as 'Don Giavanni' and 'Le  nozze di
Figaro' one would have thought perhaps a more serious and conservative
man was behind the work; but if you listen carefully to Mozart's lighter
and more playful compositions ie 'Der Holle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen
from Act II Die Zauberflote' one can perhaps hear the laughter and joy
that must have filled this musician's heart as he composed.</P>
<P>It must be a wonderful gift to be able to hear the structures of melody
and harmony, chords and progressions swimming with the same fluidity as
daily thought, and greater talent to be able to string together the
chorus of sounds without having to place a single note down on paper.
When the sound of music comes as easily as eating, sleeping and
breathing we have arguably the greatest composer that mankind has known.</P>
<P>Tom Hulce is wonderfully petulant as the rude, arrogant talented
Amadeus. His unique interpretation of the man is commendable, with the
added signature of that laugh making this particular characterisation
distinctive to say the least. F. Murray Abraham, is Antonio Salieri a
rival composer of the time. He excels at giving scathing looks of
jealousy; whose own tepid mediocrity pits him to blame God for bestowing
the greater gift of music on another man. His resulting actions brings
both raging revenge and regretful remorse. Also of note are the creative
white wigs of that period, unfashionable now, but perhaps a foreseeable
revival in the 21st century?</P>
<P>So perhaps we will never know the true 'Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart', but we
still have his music to remind us of the man. Although he was
extraordinary in terms of musical talent, it is evident in the movie,
that he also carries the yearnings of a common man; and it is the
miraculous transformation of these ordinary feelings of joy and despair,
sorrow and laughter into the heartbeat of thoughtful notes, which sets
him far above the rest.</P>
