<P>Sometimes I wonder about writing movie reviews. There are movies that
really want me to ram-ble on and on, pontificating,
pseudo-intellectualising, and overanalysing it (which is when I really
want to do it). Then there are movies that are so bereft of any solid
content that I have nothing to say except empty words. /Loser/ happens
to fall among the latter category.</P>
<P>The film is a typical "underdog boy meets girl / boy loses girl / boy
gets girl" film. In this case, Paul (Jason Biggs) is the boy (a
"loser" from a small-town who isn't hip to the New York scene) and
Dora (Mena Suvari) is the (goth) girl in love with her Literature
professor.</P>
<P>Paul is the first in his family to go to college. He correctly worries
about fitting in. We watch him deal with the culture shock, his
use-and-abuse roommates, and his heartbreak.  The thing is, anyone who
acts like Paul in an academic institution today is far from being a
loser and is probably the kind of a person who is likely to go off and
form a startup and become wildly successful (at least by certain
measures of success, but ones I'm sure Paul's nasty roommates would
agree to).</P>
<P>Biggs and Suvari are decent actors, but this material doesn't
challenge them in any way. The chemistry between them is minimal. The
issues are unambiguously black and white (Paul is the perfect boy and
his roommates and the professor are perfect assholes), which is highly
unlikely in any real relationship scenario. The sound track is decent.</P>
<P>There's some commentary to be made about the use of the "date-rape"
drug Rohypnol, but director Amy Heckerling (of /Clueless/ fame)
doesn't make it. In the end, it becomes only a means by which Paul
gets revenge on his roommates.  The nature of the abusive relationship
between Dora and her professor is thought-provoking, especially from a
Freudian (lack of father figure) perspective, but the movie doesn't
explore that either.  /Loser/ is a rental for a romantic evening, but
only if the video store clerk can't "aide" you in finding something
better.</P>
