<PRE>                                THREE COLORS: RED
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Dir: Krysztof Kieslowski
Photography: Piotr Sobocinski
Starring: Irene Jacob, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Frederique Feder,
          Jean-Pierre Lorit</P>
<P>     The third of the "Three Colors" trilogy, and according to the
director his final film, is a bleak and downbeat loosely structured
love story. In contrast to the complex revenge plot of WHITE , RED
relies heavily on parallel incidents, coincidences, premonition dreams,
doppelgangers, and superstitious fate to flesh out themes of love,
chance, and privacy. Irene Jacob (DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE) plays a
Swiss fashion model who by chance encounters retired judge Jean-Louis
Trintignant. Trintignant  is a cold and bitter old man who, like the
protagonist in the much inferior SLIVER, cynically eavesdrops on his
neighbors and expounds on the sorry plight of the human condition. The
talky encounters between them make up the main body of the film, and
their conversations impact on the lives of a small group of minor
characters.</P>
<P>     Following the plan of the trilogy, this film should have been
about fraternity. That theme seems to be interpreted in how people's
lives are intertwined through minor events. A minor mistake that one
character makes, for example, leads to somebody having grandchildren
thirty-five years later. Another character adjusting a car radio sets
much of the story in motion, changing the lives of several characters
permanently.</P>
<P>     Irene Jacob takes a blank sincerity to her role. Her motivation in
the film is called into question by Trintignant's judge character, and
her blankness leaves the answers up to the audience. She, like the
audience, is repulsed and fascinated by Trintignant's callousness and
voyeurism. Trintignant, one of France's leading actors, projects an
almost palpable air of bitter dejection and moral decay.</P>
<P>     What helps to unify this film is the use of red. Cinematographer
Piotr Sobocinski includes it in almost every scene. It is in banners
and photographs, costumes, slot machines, cars; any conceivable place.
A special lighting design that required more than twice the lights of
BLUE and WHITE combined also brings unity to the film.</P>
<P>     RED provides some interesting insight on the nature of everyday
encounters and chance meetings, but not without some heavy handed
foreshadowing and polemic speeches. It is a challenging film that may
not satisfy the fans of Kieslowski's more mainstream and humorous
WHITE. It does fall well within the tradition of European post new-wave
cinema, and is in some ways reminiscent of Godard's early color work.</P>
<P>     After the screening at the New York Film Festival, director
Kieslowski, through the aid of an interpreter, answered questions.
Typical of European directors, he did not say much. When asked about
the unifying  theme of the trilogy, he said that if you find a theme
there is a theme, if you don't there isn't. When asked about the three
films of the trilogy being so different, he said that it was the
distributor's idea to call the films a trilogy. When asked about being
an artist, he said that he was merely  a technician. When asked about
the film's stylistics, he said that it was due to the cinematographer.
When asked about cinematic influences, he said he never went to the
movies anymore. He also dodged questions about the meaning of the end
of the film. He did say that he was retiring from film making, and did
not know what he was going to do next. Kieslowski seems full of energy
for an aging man, and hopefully a few months of retirement will make
him want to return to work.</P>
