<PRE>                              ROMEO AND JULIET
                      A film review by Shane R. Burridge

<PRE>Romeo and Juliet (1968) 138m. </PRE>
<P>A beautiful adaptation of Shakespeare that has a place in many
moviegoers' hearts.  While I love Bernstein's musical version WEST
SIDE STORY, and enoy the flippant, shrieking, MTV-style 1996 update,
there is still no substitute for this Franco Zeffirelli gem. 
Shakespeare's classic love story doesn't fit the modern-dress scenario
as well as his tragedies or history lessons, no matter how timeless or
relevant his themes may be: the notion of romance is too strongly
intertwined with sentiment, innocence and longing - qualities we
associate with an irretrievable past - to make the transition
successfully.  So while the contemporary setting of 1996's ROMEO +
JULIET makes for great cinema, its own flashiness ultimately denies it
emotional resonance: it presents Romeo and Juliet's world as so
superficial, violent, and cheerless that you can't blame them for
wanting to leave it.  Their death scene is no tragedy, merely an exit.
Zeffirelli's renaissance Italy, on the other hand, is a place any of
us could be perfectly happy to spend our lives in.</P>
<P>It's hard to imagine a more definitive version of the play - this film
is how Shakespeare himself would have envisaged it, a world of
sundrenched piazzas, masked balls, rowdy swordsmanship, bustling
marketplaces, moonlight, meadows, and passion.  But most importantly,
teenagers were finally trusted with the roles of the two lovers - I
cringe at those adult `Hollywood' actors strutting across the stage
and going through all the motions in earlier film versions, because
more than anything Romeo and Juliet are two hormonally-charged
*adolescents* who are swept away not only by each other, but by the
mere idea of being in love.  Leonard Whiting is a naive, impulsive
Romeo; Olivia Hussey is the girlfriend of every boy's dreams -
voluptuous, spirited, and stunningly beautiful.  Together they
represent everyone who ever wanted to rebel against the dogmatism of
their parents and improve the way of the world.  This was surely a
message that the Woodstock generation took personally - these two
youthful, optimistic heroes were seen to endorse their views on peace,
freedom, sex, and love.  Subsequently Whiting and Hussey became minor
icons of the late sixties.</P>
<P>Zeffirelli's eye for detail presents us with an entirely believable
milieu - all his characters seem so real and natural it's easy to
forget they're speaking Shakespeare.  Every moment Whiting and Hussey
are together on screen they are completely alive - you'll know what
all-consuming love is, just as you'll sympathise with them every
moment they are apart.  Final scenes are among the cinema's most
heartbreaking - even after three cinema screenings they still make me
choke up.  Nino Rota's well-known and popular score contributes
enormously.  Film won Oscars for cinematography and costumes.  Also
with: Pat Heywood as a robust nurse and Michael York as a cocky,
pugnacious Tybalt - one of the reasons I couldn't take the 1996
version seriously was because Tybalt reminded me of a kind of Ferris
Bueller from Hell. </P>
