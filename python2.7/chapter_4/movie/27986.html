<PRE>"15 Minutes" -- A Waste of Time
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>"15 Minutes" was probably a good idea when it was just
an idea and not the laborious 130-minute movie that it
ultimately became.  Probably envisioned as an
issue-driven film about the public's increasing
fascination with bizarre social behavior, this film
seemed to want to make a statement about how askew
society's moral compass has become.  </P>
<P>Our appetite for the obscene has mutated and swelled. 
It has helped to buoy shock programs like Roseanne and
Jerry Springer, spawn circus-like programs like Who
Wants to Marry a Millionaire and the XFL, and has even
reinvented the familiar-but-staid news reporting
format with efforts such as NakedNews.com.</P>
<P>Our standards of decency have considerably decreased,
especially in a metropolitan area such as New York
City in which the film is set.  With its diversity and
anything-goes atmosphere, it has degenerated into a
freakish arena of opportunism where the most bizarre
and frightful are often (and unjustly) rewarded.  </P>
<P>You can blame their undeserving fame on people like
Richard Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer), a tabloid TV
reporter whose personal mantra is "if it bleeds, it
leads" (referring to the kinds of pieces he wants to
show).  Ratings are all that he cares about, and to
that end, he'll risk his life to reveal the identity
of a psychotic killer or air the cold-blooded murder
of a celebrated public official.  Richard is a
double-edged sword, representing the aid and
hindrances that arise from selfishness and neutrality.
 He's an interesting character, but everything else is
extraordinarily dull. </P>
<P>"15 Minutes" ultimately becomes nothing more than a
flat police thriller in which two psychopaths use
their infamy to become rich.  This duo realizes that
publishers and movie studios will pay for an absurd
story, the double jeopardy rule is a huge legal
loophole, and you can always plead insanity and never
have to go to jail.  "No one is responsible for what
they do," comments one of them.  So, off they go on a
killing spree where each additional victim means more
dollars for them.</P>
<P>On the case are Police Detective Eddie (Robert DeNiro)
and Arson Inspector Jordy (Edward Burns). 
Individually, these two are likeable characters. 
Eddie is a straight shooter while Jordy is earnest. 
But together, the two never develop any chemistry. 
There's a noticeable lack of character development. 
The characters (in fact, every character) just seem to
be doing their own thing as if they were different
planets following different orbits.</P>
<P>Actually, to give them some added dimension, there is
a romantic subplot involving both Eddie and his
girlfriend and Jordy and a pretty witness.  Jordy's
relationship is more pertinent to the story, but the
DeNiro romance could have been eliminated.  This
element seemed needlessly distracting.</P>
<P>While "15 Minutes" is marginal at best, we can sense
the passion that the filmmakers have for this topic
and the ideas that they wanted to get across.   The
message is admirable, but the film lacks polish and
wit and feels very rough around the edges.  In the
end, the good guys get their justice and the bad guys
get theirs, but we will never get ours.</P>
