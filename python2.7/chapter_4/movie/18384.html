<PRE>            WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The eagerly awaited summer release of
          Shakespeare's light fantasy tale of fairies and
          dukes is surprisingly mundane.  In spite of some
          good acting by Stanley Tucci and Kevin Kline,
          director Michael Hoffman brings little innovative
          or interesting to the telling besides star power.
          But the contribution of having familiar actors
          instead of good unknowns in a Shakespeare play is
          minimal.  Rating: 5 (0 to 10), low +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     There was a time when seeing a particular Shakespeare play might
be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  People would rarely have a
chance to see two different companies performing the same play.  Then
it was sufficient to be simply providing Shakespeare.  That is not so
any more.  Turner Classic Movies frequently plays the 1935 film
version.  It is not so long since PBS broadcast a BBC version.  In
fact, the Internet Movie Database lists nine TV versions and it does
not list the comic version featuring the Flying Karamazov Brothers.  If
a filmmaker wants to do a new version of a Shakespeare play, it should
be at least in some way very original.  It should have something that
the previous versions do not offer.  Certainly two films that I thought
did that were Kenneth Branagh's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and Ian
McKellan's RICHARD III.  The former managed to use diction that made
following the dialog easy and a pleasure to follow.  That and its
pleasant Tuscan setting made the film a real joy.  And McKellan's
reframing of RICHARD III as an alternate history with a Fascist
takeover of Britain in the 1930s stands as the single most exciting and
inventive performance of Shakespeare I have ever seen.  The new WILLIAM
SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM was presenting a very familiar
story, so with a fixed plot it should have been greatly creative in
some other way.  It should have been as innovative as those films.  It
was not.</P>
<P>     Michael Hoffman adapted the Shakespeare play and directed.
Hoffman did a beautiful job creating a sumptuous look and feel for the
1995 film RESTORATION, but his ideas were far less rich or original for
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.  As the film starts we
are immediately plunged into cliche with Felix Mendelssohn's "Midsummer
Night's Dream."  It is a rather obvious choice and hardly one that is
inspiring.  The first original touch is to move the setting from
ancient Athens to late 19th Century Monte Athene in Tuscany.  But there
is something of a problem there almost immediately.  The play has many
references to its setting, and there is an immediate dissonance to see
Italy and hear it called Athens.  It is also jarring to have characters
whose names are Theseus, Demetrius, Lysander, Helena, and Hermia.  The
move of location is probably an attempt to repeat the effect that
Branagh achieved with his Tuscan setting, but it really does not work
the same sort of magic.</P>
<P>     For those who do not know the story, I will say just briefly that
Duke Theseus (David Strathairn) is preparing to wed Hippolyta (Sophie
Marceau) when he is asked to settle a dispute between a father and
daughter.  Egeus (Bernard Hill, recently seen as the captain going down
with the ship in TITANIC) has arranged a marriage for his daughter
Hermia (Anna Friel) to Demetrius (Christian Bale). But the rebellious
daughter instead loves Lysander (Dominic West).  Another woman, Helena
(Calista Flockhart), loves Demetrius.  Getting involved into the action
is also a traveling theater company preparing to put on a bad play
about Pyramus (Bottom (Kevin Kline)).  And as if that were not enough
in another part of the forest is Oberon, King of Fairies (Rupert
Everett) is having his problems with his queen Titania (Michelle
Pfeiffer).</P>
<P>     The stars of the film are really Stanley Tucci and Kevin Kline.
Kline has a somewhat expanded role from the Shakespeare involving
Bottom's wife who never appeared in the original play.  These sequences
have to be done without dialog since it is easier to do it that way
than to get Shakespeare back to write lines for their interaction.
Stanley Tucci is almost always a pleasure to watch on the screen.  Here
he does his rubber-faced thing a little too much and amazingly he
overstays his welcome.  But Calista Flockhart (TV's Ally McBeal)
manages to out-rubber-face even Tucci and to almost achieve the level
of a Macaulay Culkin (not appearing in this film, thankfully).</P>
<P>Sadly, the film is never as enchanting as it is supposed to be or even
as it needs to be.  Many of the intended magical elements turn leaden.
Having Puck ride a bicycle again and again is just not all that
whimsical.  Having him ride a silly-looking plastic turtle intended to
be real is even less so.  Hoffman even has a mud-wrestling scene with
Helena and Hermia.  Really.  The sequence of the play of "Pyramus and
Thisbe" may be where some of the humor works the best in a sort of
imitation Monty Python way.  Still, this sequence comes off as
gratuitous filler, but then it always did in the original play also, so
that is not Hoffman's fault.  Once one accepts the Italian setting, the
use of Italian opera melodies is pleasant and does add to the mood,
though when the same melodies are repeated one starts to wonder if
there were not more to choose from.</P>
<P>     In spite of the cast, this is a competent but unexceptional
version of one of Shakespeare's more popular plays.  I rate it 5 on the
0 to 10 scale and a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
