<P>     You have to give a film maker credit for exhibiting the necessary 
chutzpah to take one of the most beloved classics in the English 
language, Charles Dickens' GREAT EXPECTATIONS, and transform it into a 
modern-day morality play/romance.  Viewers who approach this motion 
picture with the mistaken expectation that it's going to be the kind of 
rigorously faithful adaptation that David Lean produced in 1946 are 
likely to be disappointed.  Nevertheless, while Alfonso Cuaron's GREAT 
EXPECTATIONS falls considerably short of being a definitive 
interpretation of the novel, it still offers an entertaining two hours.</P>
<P>     GREAT EXPECTATIONS is considered by many to be Dickens' finest 
novel.  It is certainly among his darkest, even with the less-downbeat 
ending that the author's friends prompted him to include.  Like OLIVER 
TWIST before it, GREAT EXPECTATIONS draws heavily from events in the 
writer's own life, which in part explains its believability and strength 
of character.  One of the book's chief themes – that of a poor boy 
crossing class barriers to pursue the girl of his dreams – offered Cuaron 
(A LITTLE PRINCESS) and writer Mitch Glazer their biggest challenge.  
With the setting changed from 19th century England to contemporary 
Florida and New York, the social scale of Victorian England lost its 
validity.  Surprisingly, however, the story survived the transition 
relatively unscathed.</P>
<P>     Even as the setting has changed, so have the names and occupations 
of many of the characters.  The lead is no longer Pip; he's now called 
Finn, and is played by Ethan Hawke (with an assist from Jeremy Kissner as 
a ten-year old).  Estella, the love of Finn's life, is still Estella, and 
she is portrayed by a radiant-yet-restrained Gwyneth Paltrow (and Raquel 
Beaudene at a younger age).  Mad Miss Havisham has become the equally 
deranged Miss Dinsmore, who spends her days in a ruined house mourning a 
wedding that never took place.  With Anne Bancroft in this part, it's 
easy to imagine that Nora Dinsmore could be Mrs. Robinson gone bonkers, 
thirty years later.  The criminal Magwich has become Lustig, an escaped 
death row inmate, and is essayed by Robert DeNiro, who leaves a stronger 
impression here than in the recent JACKIE BROWN.  Finally, Chris Cooper 
(LONE STAR) plays Finn's "uncle", Joe Gargery (no name change), and Hank 
Azaria is Walter Plane, Finn's rival for Estella.</P>
<P>     The story has Finn meeting Estella in the late 1970s, when both are 
ten years old.  Neither has any parents.  Finn lives with his sister and 
her boyfriend; Estella has been adopted by Miss Dinsmore, who, despite 
being insane, is one of the richest women in Florida.  Despite a warning 
from the old lady that Estella will break his heart, Finn falls for the 
golden-haired girl, but their relationship never progresses beyond wet 
kisses at a water fountain.  Finn is in earnest, but Estella likes to 
tease.  More than a decade later, they meet in New York City.  He's there 
to break into the Manhattan art scene (and earn enough money to impress 
her), while she's contemplating marriage to a man named Walter Plane, who 
has commitment problems.  And, hidden beneath the love story, there's a 
mystery. Someone is bankrolling Finn's success.  He assumes it's Miss 
Dinsmore, but is the truth perhaps less obvious?</P>
<P>     I have heard this version of GREAT EXPECTATIONS mentioned in the 
same breath as 1996's ROMEO + JULIET.  And, while there are some 
similarities, it doesn't seem like the most appropriate comparison to 
make.  ROMEO + JULIET used Shakespeare's original text and pumped up the 
visual elements, using riotous colors and camera tricks.  Although 
director Cuaron has a distinctive visual style, it's much more sedate 
than that of Baz Luhrmann, and the only color to have any prominence is 
green.  The dialogue is definitely not Dickens.  On the other hand, GREAT 
EXPECTATIONS bears a strong resemblance to CLUELESS, a re-working of Jane 
Austen's EMMA, in both intent and execution.  The story and themes are 
still there, mostly intact, yet those unfamiliar with the original text 
might not realize that the essential elements have been lifted from a 
classic novel.  </P>
<P>     The actors do admirable jobs.  Hawke is earnest and likable; Paltrow 
is erotic but icy; Bancroft is off-the-wall; and DeNiro is suitably 
sinister.  There's no real heat between Hawke and Paltrow, but there is a 
connection, and the manner in which these two play their scenes has the 
perfect pitch for such an ambiguous, and possibly one-sided, 
relationship.  All of the performances feed into the essence of GREAT 
EXPECTATIONS, with its elements of unrequited love, broken class 
barriers, and unexpected revelations.  </P>
<P>     The script, written by Mitch Glazer (who previously updated another 
Dickens tale, A CHRISTMAS CAROL, as the almost-unwatchable SCROOGED), is 
straightforward, and sticks to the spirit of the original (the ending is 
not embellished, Hollywood-style).  For the most part, this motion 
picture feels like a contemporary fable.  (After all, where else but in a 
fairy tale could you find an empty New York City subway train at six 
o'clock in the morning?)  The majority of the film's missteps are not so 
much the result of shifting the novel in time and place, but of 
condensing it to fit into a two-hour time slot.  GREAT EXPECTATIONS may 
not be an absolute triumph, but it's significantly better than just a 
good effort.</P>
