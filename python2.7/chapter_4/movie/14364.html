<P>"If you can't spot the sucker at the table in the first half hour, 
then you are the sucker," intones Mike McDermott (Matt Damon), the 
tough-yet-sensitive card shark who narrates his own tale of greed and 
gambling in John Dahl's ROUNDERS. Good advice, considering I've 
never spotted the sucker in a poker game myself, and typical of the 
nuggets of wisdom the screenplay sprinkles along the way. ROUNDERS tries 
hard to draw you into its world of illicit big-money poker games held in 
the back alleys and dank basements of New York City. It tries to dazzle 
you with the torrent of poker slang flowing from the lips of sweaty card 
players who study one another's facial ticks through a haze of murky 
cigar smoke. It wants you to succumb to the allure of high-stakes poker, 
to feel the naked adrenaline rush of letting your bankroll ride on the 
promise of a full boat. The film tries so hard that you can't help but 
root for it. But I'm here to tell you that it just didn't happen for 
me. For all its finely honed performances and the dizzying energy of its 
dialogue, ROUNDERS is ultimately a con job- smoke and mirrors hiding 
weak characters and a derivative, predictable story.</P>
<P>Mike is a law student working his way through school as a truck driver 
after losing a giant wad of cash in a single hand to a seedy Russian 
gangster named Teddy KGB (John Malkovich). As the story opens, He seems 
to have life well in hand- he has a kindly judge for a mentor (Martin 
Landau), and a live-in girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) who is so beautiful and 
intelligent that she's not only out of your league, she's also out 
of the leagues of everyone you know.</P>
<P>But the good times never last. Out of prison steps Worm (Edward Norton), 
Mike's best friend from his rounding days. Worm, the proverbial loose 
cannon, leaves lockup under a mountain of gambling debt and is eager to 
get back to the business of playing cards. Mike makes the mistake of 
vouching for Worm at the local tables. Before he knows what hits him, he 
learns that Worm has racked up 25 G's in debt to Teddy KGB- and the 
juice is running every day. There is nothing for it but for Mike to 
assume Worm's debt and re-enter the life. He must win large, win 
clean, and try to forget the fatal hand against Teddy KGB that sent him 
skulking home with his tail between his legs.</P>
<P>Much is made of the core relationship between Mike and Worm. To Mike, 
gambling is an art. He has spent a lifetime honing his craft, and dreams 
of one day facing off against the best in the World Series of Poker in 
Las Vegas. Worm, on the other hand, is a grifter who never passes on a 
chance to fleece a sucker, and takes chances that could get him killed. 
Will Mike's blind loyalty to his reckless friend finally put his own 
life at risk? You betcha. Damon and Norton, gifted actors both, sell 
this relationship for all it's worth. The problem is that we've seen 
these two guys before, in other films. There's Denzel Washington and 
Spike Lee in MO' BETTER BLUES; Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci in GOODFELLAS; 
Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman in MIDNIGHT COWBOY. The good-hearted 
anti-hero and his self-destructive alter-ego are classic cinema 
archetypes, and any film that dares trot them out had better dress them 
up in some new clothes. Gritty realism and gambling nomenclature 
notwithstanding, Mike and Worm tell a well-worn tale.</P>
<P>The rest of the film is a hit-or-miss affair. Gretchen Mol is saddled 
with playing a cardboard girlfriend who suffers from the laughable 
delusion that the Law is somehow a more noble pursuit than professional 
gambling. John Turturro has a memorable cameo as a "grinder", poker 
slang for a player who ekes out a living by folding repeatedly until a 
winning hand turns up. And what can I say about Jon Malkovich? His 
performance is either brilliant or astoundingly bad- I can't decide 
which. He affects a nearly incomprehensible Russian accent which makes 
him sound like Boris Badinoff on Nitrous Oxide. Toning it down a bit 
would have been a wise move, but Dahl lets him roll. I did, however, 
enjoy Teddy's Oreo Cookie habit. Before placing his bet, he holds an 
Oreo up to his ear and twists it apart- because he likes the sound it 
makes. Everybody has a secret quirk like that, and it was nice to see 
one on screen.</P>
<P>ROUNDERS is worth a look if you're a fan of Damon or Norton- in the 
Damon-Norton-Affleck-DiCaprio career longevity race, my money is on 
them. But there is simply not enough original material here to warrant 
devoting much of your time to it. High stakes poker would seem to offer 
choice suspense- but there was never any moment when I really felt the 
outcome was in doubt. Part of the problem is in the script and its 
reliance on mossy cliches. But the direction, too, is a little flat. 
Dahl has a good resume; both RED ROCK WEST and THE LAST SEDUCTION were 
tantalizing noir puzzles that kept you guessing until the end. While 
those films were mostly intellectual challenges, in ROUNDERS Dahl was 
asked to create real characters who inhabit a real world, and he 
wasn't quite equal to the task. It doesn't help that he resorts to 
stream-shrouded street shots and other techniques that Scorsese 
discarded twenty years ago. If you really want to experience the 
atmosphere for which this film strives, hit the video store, rent THE 
HUSTLER, and watch Paul Newman square off once more against Jackie 
Gleason's Minnesota Fats. Why settle for a couple of Jacks when a pair 
of Kings is well within reach?</P>
