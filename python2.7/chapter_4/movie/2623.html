<P>     Penny Marshall films (BIG, AWAKENINGS, A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN) are
like cotton candy--pure sugar spun into a semblance of form that
collapses and dissolves after consumption.  That's generally not a bad
thing and, as far as motion pictures are concerned, it has its place.
Unfortunately, RENAISSANCE MAN is far from the director's best effort.
In fact, it's like someone injected a dash of bitter lemon to the
confection.</P>
<P>     Danny DeVito plays Bill Rago, a big-time ad man who loses his job
when his tardiness at a meeting costs his firm a $6 million contract.
After enduring the rigors of the unemployment line, Bill lands a job as
a teacher at an army base.  His function at Fort McClane is to take the
eight most educationally-challenged recruits and "teach them to
comprehend" so that they can graduate.  There are problems, however
(there have to be, otherwise there wouldn't be a movie).  First, Bill
has never taught before.  Second, he doesn't want to teach now--his
desire is to return to advertising.  And third, his students don't
respect him because he's a civilian.</P>
<P>     Taken as a whole, RENAISSANCE MAN is a typical offering from the
director.  It's about earning mutual respect, righting wrongs, and
enjoying a too-sappy happy ending.  However, along the way, this movie
wanders, never offering much insight into any of the characters,
relying on poorly-concealed plot devices, and manipulating with a
surprising heavy-handedness.  The feel is not right, and it has as much
to do with the movie's failed attempt to deal with too many individuals
as with its overlong running time.</P>
<P>     One of the first rules of storytelling, whether it's through
cinema or another medium, is "show, don't tell."  RENAISSANCE MAN
violates this from the start, having each of the eight students recite
a brief history.  As if hearing a poignant snippet is going to create
an immediate emotional attachment....</P>
<P>     HAMLET and HENRY V are Bill's principal teaching materials.  While
the circumstances of Shakespeare's introduction into the classroom are
forced, once the students get into the Bard's work, there are some
worthwhile moments (including a lively rap synopsis of HAMLET).
There's not enough content for RENAISSANCE MAN to function as a
Cliffnotes, but those familiar with the plays shouldn't have any
problem following along.</P>
<P>     What saves RENAISSANCE MAN is its cast.  From Danny DeVito and
Gregory Hines on down, everyone turns in a fine performance.  While all
of the actors portraying students are convincing, a couple are worth
singling out.  Stacey Dash, who plays Miranda Myers, the only female
member of Bill's group, is tremendous, combining energy, sex appeal,
and intelligence in a lively mix.  Marky Mark, hitherto known only as a
"personality", proves that he can actually do some acting.  His low-key
style is oddly reminiscent of that of a young Tommy Lee Jones.</P>
<P>     RENAISSANCE MAN is a movie of moments, too many of which are
mediocre or unfulfilling.  Feel-good movies are a staple of summer
viewing, and in order to succeed with one, there has to be enough
originality to transcend the run-of-the-mill product.  This film, with
its total predictability, misses the bullseye.  A bad Penny Marshall
picture still has appeal, but RENAISSANCE MAN is a disappointment, and
far from the best that's available.</P>
