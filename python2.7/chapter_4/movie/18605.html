<PRE>Review of A SIMPLE PLAN</PRE>
<PRE>By Jerry Saravia</PRE>
<P>Once in a blue moon, a film will come along and will grab you by the throat and
never let go - it will also make you identify with actions committed by human
behavior under certain circumstances. "A Simple Plan" is that kind of film - a
rip-snorting, understated morality tale told with finesse and acute observation
by a director who's not known for restraint, Sam Raimi ("Darkman," "The Evil
Dead"). </P>
<P>Bill Paxton stars as Hank Mitchell, an accountant for a small feed store in
the frozen tundra of Minnesota. Only this town is not populated by the
stereotypical denizens of "Fargo" - these are ordinary people about to be
overcome by extraordinary circumstances. Hank is an average, righteous Joe,
living a complacent, innocent existence with his wife, Sarah (Bridget Fonda).
Hank's fate lies in the woods when he's accompanied by his inarticulate
brother, Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton), and his alcoholic friend, Lou (Brent
Briscoe). The threesome inadvertently discover a small plane lodged in the
snow, and there appears a miracle in the form of a duffel bag: millions of
dollars in cash. Naturally, the three men are at odds of what to do with the
money - Hank decides he'll keep it since he's an accountant and can manage it.
The truth is that neither one knows how to deal with such a sticky situation.
Hank tells the boys to keep their secret quiet while he does just the opposite
- he tells his gleamy, smiling wife when he throws the cash on the table. Lou
is no better when he spills the beans to his shouting wife. The only one who
seems capable of maintaining secrecy is Jacob because he has no one to turn to
anyway, except his brother. </P>
<P>"A Simple Plan" shows how men and women act when money enters their path, and
how their behavior changes drastically. This is not fresh cinematic territory -
it's Treasure of Sierra Madre in a frozen hell - but what's new is how
compellingly the story is told. Hank appears to be the hero of the story but
slowly he's consumed by random acts of violence, and we see that the money
means more to him than anybody else. Jacob also shows that he's not a complete
idiot, and we're never sure what his true agenda is outside of wanting to stay
in an old, decrepit house where their father used to live. Lou is a drunk who
teases Hank's manhood, and all he wants is some money to pay for late bills.
Only Hank's wife remains the solely sensible one of the lot - she makes the
decisions and tells Hank what course he (and the story) should take, and it
always, ironically, results in calamity. </P>
<P>"A Simple Plan" is adapted from a 1993 novel by Scott B. Smith, who penned the
script as well, but this story does not unfold under expected pretenses, namely
countless twists and turns. Actually, the movie is not quite noir - you might
call it a bleak drama that transcends noirish expectations with its full-blown
character portrayals. There are still no heroes, but that's besides the point -
these people are undone by the money that slowly reveals layers in their
personalities. Amazingly, the money becomes less and less important to them as
the film rolls along to a horrific finale in the woods, unveiled with
unexpected, sudden shocks and a twist of fate unheard of in the movies in quite
some time.</P>
<P>Bill Paxton is sheer perfection as Hank, flawlessly wavering between
nervousness and anxiety. Is he as righteous as he thinks he is, or does he
possess a creepily violent side? Billy Bob Thornton cuts another rich
characterization with his dim-witted, stringy-haired, vague Jacob, who holds a
grudge against his brother, Hank, and who dreams of going on a date with a
simple gal. Bridget Fonda gives one of her finest acting jobs to date as the
intelligent Sarah who wants more out of her bland existence. She expresses her
rage in a touching, heartfelt speech where she expounds on unaffordable dinners
and coupons acquired to save money. </P>
<P>"A Simple Plan" moves along at a controlled pace, involving us at every turn
and allowing us to empathize with each of the characters and their motives. The
script doesn't satirize nor condescend the characters. Instead, writer Smith
makes them believable and congruent to their actions. This is not just the
result of a stirring screenplay and weighty performances, but it is also due to
Raimi's simple, unpretentious direction. And the snowy landscape and muffled
sounds contribute greatly to the atmosphere - we really feel the literal
coldness of the surroundings, as in "Fargo." </P>
<P>"A Simple Plan" may have an unsatisfying ending thematically whereas ambiguity
could have resulted in richer, deeper parallels. That is surely a minor carp
for a film that makes us realize the severe consequences that come with
criminal actions - we must always pay a price no matter how strong we are. </P>
