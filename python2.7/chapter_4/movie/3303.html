<PRE>                             THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1995 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     How would the ideal Seventies family, the Bradys, handle life in a
world filled with carjackings, conniving neighbors and date-raping
boyfriends?  This is the premise behind THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE, an
entertaining parody of the famous television show that ran  from 1969
to 1974.</P>
<P>     While the rest of the world has changed,  the Bradys have remained
exactly the same.  The loud clothes, out-of-control hairstyles, and
potato sack races are still the norm in their household.</P>
<P>     The screenwriters and director Betty Thomas have remained faithful
to the feel of the show while poking fun at it and the result is part
spoof, part tribute.  There is a plethora of inside jokes that the
Brady Bunch cultists (those people who know every line from every
episode) will get a tremendous kick out of.</P>
<P>     A perfect cast of unknowns (plus the talent of Shelly Long who
plays Carol) and plenty of cameos from the original cast are the keys
to this film's success.  Particularly good is Jan (Jennifer Elise
Cox).  Her obsessive anger towards her older sister Marsha (Christine
Taylor) is the movie's highlight.</P>
<P>     The film's look is true to the show.  Cinematographer Mac Ahlberg
matches the high-key, flat lighting and production designer Steve
Jordan remembered all of the details when recreating the sets, right
down to the avocado-green phone.</P>
<P>     While there are some squandered opportunities to go further with
the implicit conflicts and quirks of the characters, THE BRADY BUNCH
MOVIE delivers many laughs, especially for those who grew up watching
the series.</P>
