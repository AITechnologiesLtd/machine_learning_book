<PRE>                                BRASSED OFF
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>In Yorkshire, the town's livelihood depended on the pit mines.  This
was true of many towns in England; this film then  applies to the other
towns in England, South Wales and Southern Scotland that were
devastated when in 1992 many pit mines were being closed, leaving the
people, the miners, the storekeepers without any income.   For hundreds
of years these coal mines were the life's blood of the country and its
people. Suddenly, they were being shut, one after the other.</P>
<P>This film is about the plight of one representative town and how it
fought the authorities and the independent mine owners to keep the
mines open.  The title, BRASSED OFF, I assume is a pun meaning "pissed
off"  as indeed the townspeople were but also refers to the brass band
which they loved and gave them inspiration in a time of depression.
Leader and conductor of the band was Danny (Pete Postlethwaite) who had
worked in the mines all his life and was now slowly feeling the
debilitating effects of the lung disease to which miners are prone.</P>
<P>Danny's spirit kept the town from complete despair but was not enough
to keep the amateur musicians happy in the face of the mine's imminent
closing. Luckily, along came Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald) a lovely young
woman who used to live in the town but had left some years ago. . . and
she could play music beautifully, giving a lift to the unhappy people
at a time when they needed it badly..</P>
<P>Intermingling the story of the mine's closing  with the music of the
brass band gives the film a unique feeling.    They play beautifully
and spiritedly but when Danny becomes suddenly ill, the spirit of the
band falls to earth like so much coal being dumped.    Add to this that
Gloria is in love with a young miner, her teenage boyfriend Andy (Ewan
McGregor) when the miners find out she is employed by the Coal Board.
Despite her protests that she is on the side of the union, of the
miners, she is scorned.</P>
<P>This, then, is the very well told story of the mines, of the people and
their band. It also is the revealing story of the Coal Board.  When
Gloria accuses the head of the Board of having made up his mind to
close the mines two weeks ago before she could get statistics to
suggest they keep the mine open, he replies "That is not true.  We made
the decision to close the mines two years ago.".</P>
<P>Fine acting, uplifting music and a slam-bang ending make this a most
worthwhile film to attend.</P>
<P>Tautly Directed by Stephen Tompkinson.</P>
