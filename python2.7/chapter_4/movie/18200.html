<P>   Only right-wing extremists would refer to government
workers as jack-booted thugs.  In the U.S. such people
usually stand up for the "right" to maintain an arsenal of AK-
47s in their homes and their "right" to keep all their income
rather than re-distribute a portion to those not as well-off as
they.  For the government to take away your assault rifles is
one story: to confiscate your home is yet another.  While a
man's place is his castle, governments do generally have the
right to appropriate it (with just compensation) for a
legitimate, substantial public purpose, such as the
construction of a highway.  But who cares about just
compensation?  A house is not a home.  A home is a place
that hopefully embodies an investment of love and gives its
occupants a sense of identity and stability in a fast-changing
world.  To allow the authorities to commandeer such a prize
without a fight is dishonorable.  We may not feel sympathy
for a guy who stashes grenades and artillery in his attic
beyond the pale of the authorities.  We do feel compassion
for the little fella who wants only to maintain
his anchor to a specific place in a world that seems to fall
increasingly adrift.  In "The Castle," writers Santo Cilauro,
Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy and Rob Sitch together with
director Sitch enter Simon Beaufoy ("The Fully Monty")
territory with a feel-good comedy that champions a
hardy Australian scrapper while lightly satirizing and
patronizing him at the same time.</P>
<P>   "The Castle," which has been the subject of some curious
marketing by Miramax, was a popular favorite at the 1998
Sundance Festival, was picked up by the Weinsteins for $6
million, then put on the shelf for months only to receive a
modest marketing effort when finally released in a limited
number of theaters.  Only some impressive box office figures
may save the movie from going straight to the videotape: a
shame, because "The Castle" makes good use of the popular
David vs. Goliath theme--providing lots of broad smiles if not
belly-laughs while elevating sit-comish themes (such as those
practiced by "Married With Children") to more literary levels.</P>
<P>   Director Rob Sitch focuses most of his attention on Darryl
Kerrigan (Michael Caton), a lower-middle class occupant of a
modest but love-filled home located just a block or so from an
airport on one side and a high-voltage tower on the other. 
He's obviously a bargain hunter, as the story illustrates time
and again, as Darryl pooh-poohs attempts to sell him useless
gadgets at inflated prices.  Unfamiliar with life on the fast
track, he is unimpressed by western society's rampant
materialism and humankind's desire to show off its
appreciation of the (materially) finer things in life like fancy
food, vintage wine, and high-tech wizardry.  To him, a cheese
sandwich would probably be far-out. Each night he praises
the cooking of his loving wife Sal (Anne Tenney), scarcely
believing the joys of eating broiled chicken, meat loaf,
and ice cream scooped right from the tub.  His warmth
carries over to his dense children Steve (Anthony Simcoe),
Tracy (Sophie Lee), and the movie's narrator Dale (Stephen
Curry), and even though the eldest son Wayne (Wayne
Hope) is in jail for armed robbery, he keeps his family picture
proudly on the stone wall above his cot.</P>
<P>   When the government demands that Darryl vacate his
home in order to expand the airport, Darryl files a class-
action suit with his bumbling local lawyer, Dennis Denuto
(Tiriel Mola), is inevitably trounced in court by the defendant's
high-priced attorneys, and fulfills the dream of people
throughout the democratic world by taking his case "all the
way to the Supreme Court."</P>
<P>   While the victory of the little guy has been exploited by
movies like "Waterboy" and while Rob Sith's characters
sometimes seem not much brighter than Bobby Boucher and
his mom, these characters inspire genuine warmth in the
audience despite the insistence of the filmmakers on
satirizing their provincial ways.  Dan Quayle would have no
problem pointing the Kerrigans' robust family values. There's
not a person on the right side of justice who can be
unsympathetic. Darryl's neighbors, especially the clueless
Lebanese immigrant Faroud, put their trust in him to save
their homes.  Despite Darryl's naivete (in court he cannot
decide whether he is an appellant or a respondent), he is
persistent, yet has none of the obsessive qualities of
"Election"'s Tracy Flick. </P>
<P>   Not even his opponents can hate him, even when he calls
their lawyer a dickhead, and what woman with a heart can fail
to be taken in by her husband's glorification of her ability with
an ice-cream scoop?  Sure: people of his social class will fill
their basements with kitschy objects like oversized beer mugs
while the rich load their studies with Picassos.  Heaven
knows, the working class are as ecstatic with their objets d'art
as the affluent are with their investments.  This is what
makes this satire loving, not caustic, and its humor irrefutably
pleasing.</P>
