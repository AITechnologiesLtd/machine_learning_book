<P>"True Crime" is about two lady-killers. Frank Beachum, a black man, 
was found guilty of murdering a pregnant convenience-store employee. 
to rob the place of less than one-hundred dollars. He is in San 
Quentin's death row.</P>
<P>The other lady-killer is Steve Everett ( 69-year old Eastwood), a hot 
shot  NYC reporter. His exposes of corruption in high places had made 
him enemies. Worse yet was his compulsive womanizing. This crested 
when he had sex with a minor ("I thought she was 18") who was the 
daughter of his newspaper's owner. Expulsion followed, and a period 
of heavy drinking. Now on the wagon, he is working for the Oakland 
Tribune.</P>
<P>We meet him in a bar where he consumes non-alcoholic beverages. Why 
does he go to a watering spot for those?. One rationale might be that 
he has separated from his wife and does not like drinking alone, even 
Dr. Pepper. On the other hand, the now sober Steve has not sworn off 
sex. At the bar he chats up a colleague, Michelle, a cub reporter at 
the Tribune. She cooperates in the flirtation even though she is 
young enough to be his granddaughter.</P>
<P>After a few drinks Michelle leaves the bar. "Drive safe" says Steve 
in one of those phrases that substitute adjectives for adverbs. It's 
night, it's pouring felines and canines, the windshield wipers are 
working overtime, Michelle drives at over 60 mph in the driving rain. 
Is an accident being telegraphed to the audience? You bet. Michelle 
perishes on the unimaginatively named Dead Man's Curve.</P>
<P>The next day, or rather night, on the stroke of 12 Beachum. will be 
executed. The Tribune had assigned Michelle to interview the man in 
his last hours. What bad taste!  How cynical! Now, with the girl 
gone, Steve gets that job. Right away he senses a miscarriage of 
justice. He has special doubts about the reliability of sole witness 
who claimed to have seen Beachum, smoking gun in hand. Steve 
investigates...</P>
<P>Clint Eastwood as justice-maker, righter of wrongs or crusader is 
nothing new. Nor is the film genre of trying to save an innocent man 
from execution. Almost certainly the first example of this was in 
D.W.Griffith's classic, 4-stories epic "Intolerance" (1916).</P>
<P>The death penalty has been, and still is, a major, controversial 
issue, in great part because some people on death row might be 
innocent.
In his twenty-first film as a director, Eastwood tackles as heavy and 
upsetting subject as can be. But what also upsets me is the number of 
persons saying or writing  that "True Crime," is "entertaining," 
"enjoyable," or "fun." Are we so desensitized?</P>
<P>At the paper, Steve gets strict orders from above to stick to the 
formula and try no tricks. The regulations are set by city editor Bob 
Findley (Denis Leary) and editor-in-chief Alan Mann (James Woods).</P>
<P>Bob is dull fellow who is not exactly enamored of Steve. He just 
found out that Steve had been sleeping with Madame Findley. (She had 
perversely  cued her husband by leaving traces of Steve's passage. 
And Steven had been with her earlier, before going to the newspaper).</P>
<P>Alan is by very far the most attention-holding, lively and 
interesting person in the movie. His behavior, lines and actions are 
pure over-the-top James Woods, one of the most fascinating performers 
in Hollywood, even if his presumed politics are wrong.</P>
<P>Undaunted (as Clint is, perpetually), Steve sets to prove the 
innocence of Beacham. What? Can he do this in just, merely, hardly, 
only a dozen hours  (if that many) before the execution?</P>
<P>That's a bit thick. This thins the plot. What a pity that the 
ludicrousness of it all detracts from the seriousness of a situation 
replete with human pain, anti-capital punishment messages, 
anti-racism, and the injustice of justice gone wrong.</P>
<P>Conveniently and artificially stressing the suspense is the fact that 
with  every minute counting Steve's estranged wife practically 
bullies him to take, on that very day, their 5 1/2 year-old girl to 
the zoo, as previously arranged.  Absurdly, the strong Eastwoodian 
character obliges. (The girl is Eastwood's daughter with Frances 
Fisher. This and other aspects shown seem to be self-references to 
Clint's own womanizing)</P>
<P>Artificially, far too neatly, there's a stress on parallels between 
Steve's failed family and the strong bonds in Beacham's. The latter's 
desperate wife and their little girl visit him for the last time ever.</P>
<P>In artificially and most inappropriately tacked on black humor, the 
San Quentin. prison's chaplain is a smug, unfeeling prig who brings 
phony and wrong "consolations" to Beacham, irritates him as well as 
all others.. It's in terribly bad taste, yet the clergyman is very 
well played by another actor who is on my list of favorites:.the 
superbly versatile, chameleon-like  Michael McKean who, like that 
most hyper of thespians, James Woods, has enhanced many a movie and 
TV series (e.g. "Dream On")</P>
<P>The rest of the cast is good and performs soberly. Fine too are the 
production values, cinematography, and especially the depressing 
sounds of clanking prison doors and gates.</P>
<P>But the film is one of those time-watching affairs where clocks (as 
here) or other types of countdown timers keep approaching inexorably 
the fatal H-hour. It's been used, misused and overused in  movies 
about executions, war, terrorism, heists and practically all other 
genres, comedies included (e.g. Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove") The best 
application of this, one that transcends gimmickry, is in "High Noon."</P>
<P>Given the impossible time-frame, Steve's instincts are more like 
powers of divination than detection.. His laser-sharp eyes that zoom 
on  crucial clues add to the unrealism,. Steve's movie-traditional 
(i.e. deja vu cliche) last minute mad drive to get to the Governor on 
time to save Beacham is ridiculous.</P>
<P>I do appreciate the portrait of Steve as a superanuated Don Juan for 
not trying to redeem him. However, the under-12-hours cliffhanger 
gets more unlikely by the minute. While the subject is strong,  its 
treatment is wrong. It's patchworky, as if the three scriptwriters, 
rather than collaborate, made  separate contributions which were 
cobbled together in an unreal and unsubtle manner.</P>
<P>The "de rigueur" song that goes with the end-credits is, as usual, 
bad, irrelevant and dumb.</P>
<P>"Le mauvais gout mene au crime"(Stendhal)</P>
