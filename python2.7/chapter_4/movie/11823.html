<PRE>IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU (1994)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson

<P>It Could Happen To You is a movie with the wrong title.  It's working title
was Cop Gives Waitress $2 Million Tip, which works a lot better.  It Could
Happen To You is a feel good, funny, and enchanting film.  </P>
<P>Nicolas Cage (The Rock, Face/Off) is Charlie Lang, a genuinely nice and
honest cop.  He is content with his job.  He is married to a loud obnoxious
woman, Muriel (Rosie Perez).  Then there's the waitress, Yvonne Biasi
(Bridgette Fonda) who is down on her luck and in bankruptcy.  One day
Charlie and his partner stop to get some coffee from a rundown café where
Yvonne works.  Charlie has enough to pay for the coffee but not the tip, so
tells Yvonne that he'll give her half of the winnings of the lottery ticket
in his wallet if he wins.  Yvonne brushes this offer off.</P>
<P>That night Charlie finds out that his ticket is a 4 million-dollar winner.
He tries to break the news of the $2 million "tip" to his wife Muriel.  And
as you might guess, she's not too happy about it.  Rosie Perez is hilarious
in this series of scenes.</P>
<P>Cage and Fonda are charming onscreen together.  They have a definite screen
chemistry and that carries the film well.  On the other side of the scale,
though, is Rosie Perez.  In some scenes she is hilarious, but in others she
is the epitome of annoyance.</P>
<P>Though not very creative, the film doesn't feel recycled so much as
familiar.  This could happen and it could happen to me.  Heck, it might
have happened to someone already.  And it is this feeling of familiarity
that makes It Could Happen To You so easy to love.  Kudos to Jane Anderson
for writing such a loveable film.</P>
<P>It Could Happen To You is a wonderful movie that in the end will leave you
feeling warm and fuzzy inside with a big grin on you face.  Don't Miss It
Could Happen To You.</P>
