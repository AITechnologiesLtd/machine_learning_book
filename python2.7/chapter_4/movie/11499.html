<P>KISSING A FOOL
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *** (out of ****) 
Universal / 1:32 / 1998 / R (language, sexual innuendo)
Cast: David Schwimmer; Jason Lee; Mili Avital; Bonnie Hunt; Vanessa Angel; Kari 
Wuhrer; Frank Medrano; Bitty Schram; Judy Greer 
Director: Doug Ellin; James Frey 
Screenplay: Doug Ellin <HR>Matt LeBlanc and his "Ed" fiasco aside, the "Friends" cast generally makes 
reliable choices when it comes to selecting film vehicles for their respective 
talents, typically cast in parts that aren't too far from their sitcom personas. 
In "Kissing a Fool," however, David Schwimmer tackles a role that couldn't be 
more different from his affable, sensitive television alter-ego, and has a 
surprisingly good time doing it. True, "Kissing a Fool" is nothing we haven't 
seen before with our other Friends -- Matthew Perry's "Fools Rush In" and 
Jennifer Aniston's "Picture Perfect" explored similar territory -- but it still 
works. Derivative though the film may be, a nice cast and some pretty sharp 
exchanges bring it to light, vivacious life. </P>
<P>"Kissing a Fool" opens with a mystery wedding at a mansion in Chicago's North 
Shore. The estate belongs to a publishing mogul named Linda (Bonnie Hunt), and 
the bride is pretty, witty Sam Andrews (Mili Avital), an editor who works for 
her. The groom's identity remains an enigma until the film's final segment, but 
we know from the get-go it's one of two best friends -- cynical, womanizing 
sportscaster Max Abbitt (Schwimmer) or on-the-rebound, touchy novelist Jay 
Murphy (Jason Lee). The story unfolds in flashback, beginning with a whirlwind 
courtship between Max and Sam that leads to their ultra-fast engagement. Max 
loves Sam, but grows hesitant upon realizing that marriage is, or is supposed to 
be, a life-long commitment. (Duh.) Acting impulsively, he enlists Jay's help to 
test Sam's loyalty, but doesn't expect Jay to fall for her in the process. </P>
<P>Romantic comedies are hard to do because each one is basically rehashing the 
same premise over and over again, and that rule holds true for "Kissing a Fool" 
-- very little of what goes on is remarkably new or challenging. But it's the 
way the material is handled that makes the film so appealing; the screenplay 
flows like various components of "Seinfeld," "Ally McBeal" and, yes, "Friends" 
rolled up into a comfortable comedic crisis. Occasionally, the dialogue and 
situations resemble something from the pens of Kevin Smith or Quentin Tarantino. 
One segment in particular finds Max and Sam telling Jay two wildly different 
versions of what happened on a date the previous evening, and we get to see both 
sides acted out; the capper to this is probably worth the admission price alone. </P>
<P>Sore spots include a climax that's a little heavier than it should have been, 
plus a framing device that would be downright irritating if not for the 
gleefully acerbic presence of Bonnie Hunt. The only purpose for that latter 
glitch is to keep you guessing as to who really is going to end up with Sam, but 
look and listen closely to the movie's prologue and that mystery is solved. 
Flaws aside, "Kissing a Fool" is still a nice showcase for its performers. 
Israeli actress Avital ("StarGate") is effervescently charming, while Lee 
("Chasing Amy") does the whiny friend thing with earnest conviction despite a 
hairdo that never looks right on his head. But it's Schwimmer who turns doubt on 
its ear by acing a character that's the polar opposite of what he's known for. 
With projects like these, who needs "Friends"? <HR>© 1997 Jamie Peck
