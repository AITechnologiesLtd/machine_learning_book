<P>MAN ON THE MOON (1999) - A Film Review By Jerry Saravia</P>
<P>Andy Kaufman remains as the old saying goes, "a mystery wrapped inside of an 
enigma." He was the most unconventional comic to ever grace a stage or an 
open mike because he purely challenged the whole notion of what comedy was. 
Comedians are known for one-liners, such as the famous Milton Berle, and 
punchlines - a plethora of jokes are expected to make the audience laugh. 
Kaufman is not someone you would accuse of taking the easy road to make 
people laugh - his intentions were based on showing up as the showman and 
nothing more. He did not tell jokes nor did he know how to tell them, and he 
was not a political or angry comedian like Lenny Bruce was. No, this man 
played the theme to "Mighty Mouse" and wrestled with women to get laughs. </P>
<P>"Man on the Moon" stars Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman, showing us his early 
stage routines of mimicking Elvis Presley leading to his famous Latka Gravas 
character on the popular TV show "Taxi." His agent (played by Danny De Vito, 
who does not do a reprise of his "Taxi" character) is amazed by Kaufman, but 
has no idea how to promote such a talent, so he lends him the coveted "Taxi" 
role promising a "Fonzie-type" breakout character. It is no secret that Andy 
despised "Taxi" and caused a ruckus, often using his hateful alter-ego 
character, Tony Clifton, a lounge singer, to cause chaos on the set. It is 
also no secret that Tony become a bigger star than Andy, especially in the 
days of Andy wrestling with Memphis wrestler Jerr Lawler (amusingly playing 
himself). </P>
<P>The moments where Tony Clifton appears ,silencing the crowd before singing or 
insulting audience members, are the most outrageous and the funniest. Clifton 
was Andy, and sometimes Andy's best friend and writing partner, Bob Zmuda 
(Paul Giamatti), was also Tony, and so this caused more confusion among 
audiences. How could anyone respond with a straight face to anything Clifton 
or Andy did on stage or on TV? </P>
<P>In fact, that is largely the appeal of "Man on the Moon." The film distorts 
reality on screen just as Andy did - we never knew what to expect from him or 
when he was staging fights or insults or actually doing them. The truth is 
that it was all staged, including the punishingly slow, one year debacle of 
Lawler fighting Andy on the ring or on David Letterman. That distortion or 
the fact that Andy was always in on the joke himself is what makes his life 
so speculative. Who was Andy? What kind of man was he? When was he not 
fooling around, and when was he being serious? There came a point when his 
sister did not believe that Andy had lung cancer, which he tearfully admits 
on stage while the audience bawls with laughter. </P>
<P>Carrey is so good as Andy that he disappears into the role, and it is more 
than just a recreation of the man or his acts - it is spookily eerie in that 
it really feels like Andy Kaufman is alive and well on screen. Carrey also 
carries scenes of tenderness beautifully such as the movie's key line where 
he tearfully replies to his girlfriend's remark "There is no real you" with 
"Oh, yeah, I forgot." I also like the moment where Andy is tricked by a 
psychic surgeon, who is actually a charlatan, into believing that his 
cancerous condition will be taken away - Carrey's face shows a mixture of 
elation and sadness. Jim has so many good moments that an Oscar nomination 
should be guaranteed - we have not seen such an authentic recreation of a key 
figure in show business since Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison in "The Doors." </P>
<P>If only the film dealt with his childhood past in more detail, especially in 
the days when he thought there were cameras in his bedroom walls watching his 
act (a reminder of Carrey's performance in "Truman Show"). And what did his 
parents think of Andy's act? Or his sister and friends, especially his 
girlfriend (thanklessly played by Courtney Love)? There must have been some 
thoughts on Andy - was he just a showman out for thrills or a genius of 
comedy? </P>
<P>"Man on the Moon" does not try to understand Andy Kaufman nor is there any 
attempt to. The mystique is still there, including the possibility that his 
lung cancer was a joke and that he will return in the year 2000 (the film 
makes no attempt to disprove the hoax). It is not a complete or fulfilling 
biography as was director Milos Forman's last film, "The People vs. Larry 
Flynt," but it is a strange and entertaining experience. I have a feeling 
Andy would have wanted it that way. </P>
