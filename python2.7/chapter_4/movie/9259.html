<PRE>"Men In Black"
A Postview, copyright 1997 p-m agapow</PRE>
<P>This year's "Independence Day", hyped to all hell and back
release: the Men in Black are shadowy agents who monitor alien
activity on Earth, suppressing evidence that would alert the
general public.  The laconic Kay (Jones) initiates a new agent
(Smith) while they chase a rouge alien, all three being in
pursuit of a plot macguffin.</P>
<P>Reviewing the latest Big Movie Event is a fraught task.  After
a deluge of publicity (so omnipresent that even hitherto
undiscovered tribes in the highlands of Myanmar can comment
fluently on Will Smith's witticisms), anyone with even the
slightest amount of cynicism would feel disappointment with the
actual product.  "Men in Black" doesn't measure up to its
pre-publicity, what movie could?  Like fashion, the movie
business has become disconnected with its end product and in now
largely about marketing the peripherals: the paraphernalia, the
licensing, the toys, the image.  More's the pity, because there
is actually a quirky and very sly picture hiding under the
curtain of hype.</P>
<P>The first clue that this is not the ultra-slick blockbuster
that is being marketed, is the spidery lettering of the opening
credit sequence.  A camera dizzily follows a mosquito bumbling
through a landscape of distorted, towering figures.  Director
Sonnenfeld is shooting from a point of view somewhere near Tim
"Edward Scissorhands" Burton, seeing a world turned at 90 degrees
to reality. (A comparison that is heightened by the Danny
Elfman score.)  In this way "Men in Black" is also reminiscent of
Sonnenfeld's previous "Addams Family" or "Get Shorty", in that we
see this weird world - blandly accepted by its inhabitants - and
its collision with the "real" world.</P>
<P>As Agent Kay, Tommy Lee Jones is thus this film's Gomez
Addams, completely unquestioning of his worldview.  Jones is
wonderfully hangdog, deadpanning throwaway lines as he shrugs off
body stealing, alien invasion and world destruction.  ("We're
self-funding through holding the patents on several bits of alien
technology we've acquired: microwave ovens, velcro,
liposuction.")  Will Smith, seemingly getting his acting
inspiration from "Shaft", is less interesting but at least does
not damage the picture.  Linda Fiorentino, as a curious medical
examiner, has some fun and is not wasted here as she was in
"Unforgettable".  Rip Torn contributes a minor but effective part
as the leader of the Men in Black.</P>
<P>Entertainment-wise, the first half of the film is rich on
laughs although of the surreal, dry type: Kay wrestles with a
foot-high alien as onlookers stare.  A group of agency initiates
struggle with a test while trapped in a room full of
dysfunctional 60s furniture.  There are no punchlines are per se,
it is the scenes that are funny.  Regrettably this attitude takes
a backseat as a conventional "find the magic widget" plot takes
over at about the halfway point.  This and some discrepancies
between the trailer and the film make me suspect that there was
some interference in the production.  Fortunately, "Men in Black"
does not outstay its welcome, tipping the scales at just over 1
and a half hours.</P>
<P>Not the blockbuster the studio might have wanted (and
perhaps that's best), "Men in Black" is cute, quirky and
recommended.  Knock down the rating some if you're become sick of
all the marketing.  [***/interesting] and Steve Reich on the TV
on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
