<P>South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut</P>
<P>This movie is based on the television show _South Park_ and some knowledge
of the show would enhance one's viewing enjoyment of the movie. Rarely have
I seen a movie so single-mindedly obscene. If you cannot find anything in
this movie that offends you, I suggest a career in proctology. As long as
you have a strong stomach, don't let the obscenity scare you away. It is the
way this movie revels in filth that makes it entertaining. The story is as
follows: the boys see a movie by the Canadian duo Terrance and Phillip,
which warps their fragile little minds, which leads to America going to war
with Canada and a bunch of other stuff. _South Park BL&U_ sets out to be a
parody of a Disney movie, including the irrelevant music numbers. These
songs are probably the movie's best feature. The song from the Terrance and
Phillip movie is the best, but don't go singing it in public. Also, Cartman
sings his famous song, "Kyle's Mom is a Bitch." Despite being highly
enjoyable and quite quotable, this movie has two major flaws. First, Chef
does not sing. Chef's songs are always the highlight of the _South Park_ tv
show episodes. Second, and more importantly, the movie needed more of a
plot. Basically, the story served as a vehicle to lampoon popular culture,
especially Disney movies and censorship. While that would have been fine for
a 30 minute tv episode, it wears thin over the course of 90 minutes.
However, the movie has the grace to end on a strong note. The Cartman vs.
Saddam Hussien fight is both hysterical in its own right and an excellent
parody of an anime battle.</P>
<PRE>Rating: Good</PRE>
<P>Ratings go like this: Abominable, Bad, Fair, Good, Very Good, Great, and
Perfect. As you might guess, most movies are Fair to Good. Very few movies
are either Abominable or Perfect.
