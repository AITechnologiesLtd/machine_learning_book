<P>The buzz surrounding SMOKE SIGNALS has largely focused on the fact that it
is the first film to have been written, produced, directed, and acted
entirely by Native Americans. While it is notable for its avoidance of
pop-culture stereotypes of all Native Americans as either shamans or
drunkards, the roots of its success are the same as those of most
successful films: realistic, three-dimensional characters who have an
interesting story.</P>
<P>Victor Joseph (Adam Beach), the lead character, is a young man living on a
reservation in Idaho whose alcoholic father Arnold (Gary Farmer) abandoned
his family years ago. It's a small, isolated community, which means that he
sometimes sees more than he would like of Thomas Builds-The-Fire (Evan
Adams), whom Arnold rescued from a fire when he was only an infant. Thomas
is the kind of guy who's settled into a routine, which in his case is his
enthusiasm for just about everything and his tendency to tell odd little
stories all the time, and is completely oblivious to the fact that he can
get on people's nerves once in a while. Victor's father, who's been in
Arizona since he left his family, has now died, and Victor doesn't have
enough money to go collect his ashes by himself. Along comes Thomas, who
agrees to supply the rest of the cash if he can go along for the ride.</P>
<P>>From there, SMOKE SIGNALS follows the basic formula for a buddy/road movie,
in which the characters discover certain things about themselves and about
each other along the way. Victor discovers that his father wasn't just a
simple drunk who ran out on the family and that he has harbored a lot more
anger and bitterness over his family's breakup than he would like to admit.
Thomas, who sometimes unintentionally mimics the stereotype of Native
Americans as mystics and who "has seen DANCES WITH WOLVES a hundred times"
according to Victor, turns out to be a little wiser than one might
initially think.</P>
<P>While there are some traces of resentment over their social
marginalization, the Native Americans in SMOKE SIGNALS seem just as likely
to joke about their situation as they are to complain about it. "The only
thing worse than Indians on TV is Indians watching Indians on TV," Thomas
comments when he, Victor, and Arnold's friend Suzie (Irene Bedard) find
themselves watching a cowboys-and-Indians movie. Some of the funniest
moments belong to a radio broadcaster on the reservation who makes daily
traffic and weather reports such as, "A car went by about ten minutes ago,
and there's a cloud up in the sky that looks kind of like a horse." The
humorous touches serve to undermine the stereotypes through the characters'
mockery of them.</P>
<P>The acting in SMOKE SIGNALS and the evocation of the rural West by director
Chris Eyre are probably a little more polished than Sherman Alexie's
screenplay, which includes a few long, drawn-out scenes of only minimal
importance and comes dangerously close to making a caricature of Thomas as
storyteller wannabe. Still, the mix of character study and humor is
engaging enough to keep Victor's and Thomas's road trip moving past any
bumps along the way.</P>
