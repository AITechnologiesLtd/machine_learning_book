<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A black comedy set in the near future in a boarding house run by a
depraved butcher. The comedy is played more in comic strip style for
entertaining value than for deeper satire, as it features mostly zany
sophomoric sight gags and relies heavily on special effects. The world
has fallen on hard times and there are food shortages which include no
meat, so the butcher serves up meat from human flesh to customers who
pay with grain, almost as valued a commodity. That's the big joke in the
film and the novelty of that cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast, as
the characters are too absurd and sketched too thinly for us to care
about them. This tasteless postapocalyptic French comedy is a first
feature for the co-directors Marc Caro/Jean-Pierre Jeunet. It failed to
reach my funny bone and instead left me mostly annoyed at its slight
story and its dark projections for the future.</P>
<P>An ex-circus clown named Louison (Dominique Pinon), the film's
too-good-to-be-true hero, answers an ad for work as a handyman for
Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus ), and the butcher and landlord, offers him
room and board in his house. The butcher's clumsy and near-sighted
daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac) falls in love with the skinny,
weird looking clown, and the two make some music together, with her
playing the cello and him a saw. They are the innocents, surrounded by a
boarding house of misfits suffering from fear and watched over by her
overbearing father, who has lured into his tenement the clown, as he has
his past innocent victims, so that he can put his cleaver to him and
then sell him as meat, which he intends to do as soon as the clown fixes
up the tenement.</P>
<P>The entire film takes place in the shabby tenement, and the tenants are
an odd lot of bizarre malcontents, who do not trust each other. There
are two youngsters (Boban Janevski & Mikael Todde) who do any kind of
mischief they can. A frog man (Howard Vernon) who lives with water on
the floor so he can raise his frogs and snails that he eats. Two
brothers (Mathou & Kube) who create little cow-moo novelty toys. A man
(Holgado) who sells a bullshit detector to the butcher for his piece of
meat. A slutty woman (Karin Viard), who lives with the butcher and only
wants his meat. The aristocratic woman (Silvie Laguna) who tries
numerous times to commit suicide but is too inept to do it right.</P>
<P>The tenants are too afraid to come out at night because they know what
the butcher is up to, so they are forced to communicate with each other
through a pipe that runs through the building (in one scene they are all
in musical harmony to the lovemaking of the butcher and his gal, as
their bedsprings squeak).</P>
<P>There is also a sex-crazed postman (Chick Ortega), who lusts for the
butcher's daughter and carries a gun while delivering the mail.</P>
<P>There is also an underdeveloped subplot about a band of incompetent
underground veggie fanatics, called Trogolodistes, who have been
summoned to rescue the clown and steal some grain. The directors
overloaded the film with too many eccentrics, as the comedy seemed
forced while the surreal look of the film added no dramatic intensity.</P>
<P>Delicatessen could have some appeal to the cult film crowd who like
their meat sliced thin, Monty Python fans, and those who liked Terry
Gilliam's Brazil, a film similar in spirit.</P>
