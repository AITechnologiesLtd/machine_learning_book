<PRE>OUT OF SIGHT</PRE>
<P>Do you have memories of when a recognizable presence in the movies
suddenly finds the right script, and becomes a fully-developed star
right before your eyes?  Looking back, I will have pleasant memories of
"discovering" Bruce Willis in _Die Hard_, Julia Roberts in _Pretty
Woman_, and "rediscovering" John Travolta in _Pulp Fiction_.</P>
<P>Well, fasten your seatbelts, folks.  George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez
have done it.  After a couple of false starts, Clooney (who had a
smaller role as _Batman_ than Alfred the butler) and Lopez (a.k.a.
_Selena_), have broken out of their schlock and become cinema's latest
smart, hot, sassiest couple.  It also makes a strong comeback for
Stephen Soderbergh, who broke new ground with _sex, lies, and videotape_
nine years ago.</P>
<P>The film starts intriguingly as a disgruntled Jack Foley (Clooney) walks
out of an office building, furiously throwing his tie onto the ground.
The film pauses at that moment; this is Soderbergh saying, "Did you
catch that?"  Over the course of the two hours, you will know the reason
for his anger, and his impromptu decision afterwards:  to rob a bank.</P>
<P>Foley pulls off one of the most suave, gunless bank robberies in movie
memory.  But after he does so, the film double-crosses itself, and he is
easily caught after his car won't start.  Such great twists are
reminiscent of the film--smart people doing crazy things, and being done
in by life's unpredictabilities.  It's a great theme, and plays real
well here.</P>
<P>Foley lands in prison.  Only a matter of time will come where he will
escape, and inadvertantly run into Federal Marshall Karen Sisco (Lopez),
who wastes no time in using her birthday present-a flashy pistol.  The
two are subsequently locked in the trunk of the getaway car, where the
sparks of an unexpected romance begin to brew.  Days later, she's still
thinking about him.</P>
<P>This all serves as the opening premise of a wildly imaginative ride that
uses the talents of Ving Rhames, Don Cheadle, Steve Zahn, Dennis Farina,
and a couple of pleasant unbilled cameos.  Returning from the dead of
movieland hell is Nancy Allen, aging gracefully.  And stealing the show
is Albert Brooks, even if his bald-wig is a little too obvious in some
scenes.</P>
<P>_Out of Sight_ isn't perfect.  Some of the scenes are a little too talky
and Soderbergh's expiremental film style sometimes backlashes against
him.  I also found a few of the action scenes to be too easy;
screenwriter Scott Frank (who also wrote _Get Shorty_, both of which
originated from Elmore Leonard pulp) was not too concerned with great
action sequences as he is with great dialogue.  A good call, but it made
me wanting more.</P>
<P>As for Clooney and Lopez, genuine star-power has come with a mighty gust
of class and sass.  Take a breath of the new wind.  Get thee to a
multiplex now.</P>
