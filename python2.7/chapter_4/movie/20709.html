<P>Movie-wise, today was a day of Color for me--in more ways than one: first,
"Blue Streak" with Martin Lawrence, and now "The Red Violin", featuring
Samuel L. Jackson. I might just get used to having so much Color on the
screen. The question is, were these Colors just eye candy, or something
more?</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below):
First things first: if you're not the type that likes Films (as Steve
Martin said so well in "Bowfinger", "I don't make films, I make movies!"),
ya might want to Exit, Stage Right. Do so quietly, please, so as not to
disturb the other patrons[1]. Ok, now that that business is done... </P>
<P>The excellently-executed website for this Film says it much better than I
ever could (do yourself a favor: if you don't plan on seeing this
movie--heck, even if you do--read through the Storyline on that page; it
helped to clarify a lot of things that I saw but didn't quite Get at
first; plus, it's extremely well-done. Kudos to all involved with this
website):</P>
<P>  "THE RED VIOLIN is a stirring and sumptuous epic about a fabled musical  
   instrument that changes hands - and lives - over the course of three 
   centuries. Depicting signature chapters in the violin's history, from its
   creation in seventeenth-century Italy, to the court of Imperial Vienna in
   1790, to Victorian England in the late 1800s, to the People's Republic of
   China in the mid-1960s, and, finally, to an auction house in modern-day
   Montreal, THE RED VIOLIN is a grand tale that spans five countries, four
   languages, and more than three hundred years of history and cultural change.
   These successive movements, each evoking a different musical style, from
   Baroque to modern, combine to tell a tale filled with poetry, pageantry,
   tragedy, romance, adventure, and intrigue."</P>
<PRE>The Upshot:
And that it did, in marvelous ways.</PRE>
<P>I need to admit my bias: as a writer of primarily short stories and
poetry, I'm a sucker for a well-told story; given one, I could sit through
almost anything. I went in knowing that this film was somehow Different,
but I didn't quite expect what I saw (including the subtitles, which I
very much appreciated). And since I stayed up all night working on various
3BC projects, I was incredibly sleepy before the film started (having just
finished watching "Blue Streak" less than an hour before this one, my
weariness was all the more pronounced). That "The Red Violin" could cut
through all of that and hold me enthralled for two hours, is a tribute to
the quality of this film.</P>
<P>As much as I loved this movie, I find it hard to describe it adequately.
It had action, passionate sex/romance, intrigue (if only in how the violin
changes hands over centuries), humor, pathos--but not like your
standard-fare mainstream flick.  Neither, though, is it dry and lifeless
as Films tend to be. It took a couple minutes to get into the
story--during the Italian segment, I was distracted[1] for a few minutes
and didn't quite follow what was happening there--but by the time the
violin, and the viewer with it, moved on to Vienna, I was hooked. </P>
<P>The storytelling was done beautifully both in the narration and in the
filming itself; the flashbacks necessary for this movie were done well and
made perfect sense, leaving the viewer wanting to know more and more about
what happens next. As it went back (forward?) to present-day Montreal, the
camera angles revealed repeated scenes from viewpoints that we didn't see
before as it advanced the tale; the shifts in focus were done subtly
enough so as not to confuse the viewer, but didn't insult the viewer's
intelligence (as, unfortunately, far too many flicks I've seen this
summer, did). The events that took place in each vignette tore at my heart
(especially the one in Vienna, with Christoph Koncz as Kaspar Weiss; I
just wanted to take that poor boy home with me!), made me laugh, made me
angry in turn--but not in a manipulative way. Each one was like a puzzle
that fit almost perfectly near the end. I had Issues that I'll address in
a minute, but most of them were resolved by reading carefully through the
story (and The Story Behind The Story) on the Official Website. I can't
recommend a read-through of that page, highly enough.</P>
<P>The actors were equally outstanding, each in his or her own right; having
the overall story told in small vignettes helped to make each segment's
featured players get the highlight they need. Standouts include the
aforementioned Koncz, Jason Flemyng as Fredrick Pope (the passionate
"devil"), Sylvia Chang as Xiang Pei and her own mother, and Ireneusz
Bogajewicz (Cesca the tarot reader). The violin itself didn't impress me
(and the supposed "secret" about it was pretty transparent from the
start), but I suppose I could see the obsession in, say, a rare Mac clone
being passed down through the ages and...uh, never mind. I liked most of
all that it wasn't until nearly the end that everything came together; and
did so logically, not clumsily so-we-can-END-this-thing! like most of
today's flicks [can you say "The Muse"? I knew you could!] </P>
<P>Do you get the vibe that I liked this film? "Liked" isn't strong enough.
It now holds a rare spot alongside "The Matrix", "Mystery Men" and last
year's "What Dreams May Come", as the only movies I cared to spend my
hard-earned dough on to see again before they went to video. I am
surprised at myself, though, for liking it as much as I did; not that I'm
not Cultured--I have Kulcha oozing from my sweet lil' pores--but because
violins normally don't Do it for me (unlike the film's producer, I think
the saxaphone is the most romantic instrument). Maybe I'm getting more
conservative (Blacktionary time: bougie) in my Old Age, but give me more
Red Violins over "Chill Factor" and its bretheren, any day.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]
    As a Black woman, I see the "Black Factor"--things that affect me as a 
    "consumer of color"--in many aspects of life; movies included. Whether 
    from the standpoint of noting Black (and other "minority") cast and crew
    members (if any), to the (lack of) focus toward "people of color" (dag, I
    hate that term), to the out-and-out antagonistic attitude toward Us 
    (Jar-Jar, anyone?), the "Black Factor" (BF) is something that plays as 
    much a role in my film enjoyment as any other aspect of the movie itself.</P>
<P>As promised, my Issues: Samuel L. Jackson; more specifically, his
character's actions in this film.</P>
<P>(WARNING: some spoilers contained below.) Of all the actors in this film,
Jackson sticks out like a sore thumb at first viewing. Point blank, it
felt like he did not belong there. Don't get me wrong: I'd pay to listen
to The Man read a telephone book, but his was the only role that didn't
synch for me. And don't go assuming that it's because he's Black; that
wasn't it. It's because he's so GOTdam intense--which, ironically enough,
seems to be exactly why he was cast in the role.</P>
<P>For me (until I read the story on the site, anyway), both his
unreasonable, Jules-like anger, and his out-and-out thievery in the end,
were misplaced. After reading the story, though, both are explained;
still, it changed the timbre of the movie as a movie for me. Having gone
to see the movie primarily because he's in it, I left the theater bothered
by his actions within it, and feeling that something just wasn't right.
Maybe if it wasn't for the situation I'm about to Dish about, I would've
been able to Feel him more immediately; who knows...</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line    
[1]A Bammer Rant, if I may...I finally found something more irritating than 
Black Folks bein' Loud in the theater (oh, don't look at me like that; y'all
know it's true): a big fat greasy nasty IRRITATINGLY LOUD man--who
happened to be of the Caucasian Persuasian--suckin' down a HUGE vat of
popcorn as if he hadn't eaten in days. That fool was smackin' his lips
like he was eating filet mignon or something, like his mama didn't teach
him better than that. Next time I go to an art flick, I'm takin' my belt,
daggonit.</P>
<P>That, and other issues with Jackson aside, I encourage my readers to spend
a few bucks on something they might not normally go to see; it's worth it
(and if you're one of my cherished Ghetto Readers, just wait'll you see
this pasty paleface do it with a violin! He so nastee!)</P>
<P>"The Red Violin"--high marks for both the film and its accompanying
website.  I may have finally found my movie review niche: foreign
artsy-fartsy films. Who'da Thunkit?</P>
