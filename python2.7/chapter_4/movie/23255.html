<PRE>`The Whole Nine Yards' – Comedy about Hitman Sometimes
Hits and Sometimes Misses
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Before plunking down your hard-earned money to see
this film, ask yourself this one question.  Can you
visualize a movie that stars tough-guy Bruce Willis
alongside Friends funny-guy Matthew Perry?  Willis has
played countless tough guys before.  So, this isn't
new territory for him.  Perry, however, usually is the
equivalent of the touch of death when he is part of
any movie project.  His deer-in-the-headlights comedic
style, works well on his TV show but doesn't seem to
translate well onto the big screen.</P>
<P>In `The Whole Nine Yards,' the running theme is about
people that want to kill other people.  Matthew Perry
plays Oz, a nicer-than-nice Dentist who is openly
despised by his wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette).  She
wishes that Oz would die, and is secretly in the
process of trying to hire a hitman for the job.   Oz
tells of his marital woes to his dental assistant,
Jill (Amanda Peet).  She is appalled by his current
situation and tells him that he'd `be doing the world
a favor if he had her whacked.'  To make Oz's life
even more complicated, the new neighbor next door
turns out to be famed hitman-in-hiding, Jimmy `The
Tulip' Tudeski (Willis).  Though Oz is terrified with
this fact, it's hard to turn down an invitation from
him to go for a drive.  `Relax, it won't kill you,'
says Tudeski with his tongue firmly in cheek.   `The
Tulip' imparts his philosophies about life, making Oz
completely uneasy.   `We'll all die sometime' and
`what's important is how I get along with the people
who are still alive.' </P>
<P>Oddly, Jimmy is only the first hitman that he'll meet
over the course of the week.  Oz eventually runs into
Frank Figs (Michael Duncan Clarke), a really large
enforcer for Hungarian crime boss Janni Gogolak (Kevin
Pollak).  Gogolak has put a price on Tudeski's head.</P>
<P>Poor Oz.  He has to find a way to keep all of the ones
that he cares for alive while saving himself.  And
this can become quite difficult because one of the
women that he meets along the way and falls in love
with happens to be Jimmy's wife (Natasha Henstridge). 
When Oz confesses to Jimmy that he's fallen in love
with her, he laments `Oh my God, I've upset a mass
murderer.'</P>
<P>Happily, there's a hint of general glee among the cast
members, who seem to be enjoying what they are doing. 
This would explain the purposefully over-the-top
acting in some sequences and the incomprehensible
accents in others.  Actors get at least one scene to
ham it up, and when the spotlight is on them, they
take full advantage of their opportunity.  Kevin
Pollak gets his moment as the Hungarian crime boss who
doesn't quite have a good enough command of the
English language.  Rosanna Arquette gets her moment
when she seduces hitmen as part of her contract
negotiation strategy.  But the real bright spot for
me, however, was Amanda Peet who played Jill the
dental assistant.  She turns out to be a Tudeski
groupie who aspires to become a bona fide contract
killer.  She brings a natural vibrancy to her role
that makes her infectiously funny and a delight to
watch.  Enjoying this film really depends on two
things: having the patience to allow some of the
movie's momentum to generate and accepting its
tongue-in-cheek spirit.  Some of it worked for me. 
Some didn't.</P>
