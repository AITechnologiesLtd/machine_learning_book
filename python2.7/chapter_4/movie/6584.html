<PRE>                            THE ENGLISH PATIENT
                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1996 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<P>THE ENGLISH PATIENT opens with one of the film's many
touchstone images -- somebody is touching brush to paper,
drawing seemingly inscrutable lines with some precision. We
wonder whether this is some unfamiliar language, but as the
credits progress, the image takes on the shape of a human
figure, swimming. The image, we will later learn, has been
copied from the ancient paintings on the wall of a desert
cave.</P>
<P>The cave of swimmers, as it is known, is discovered by a
geographic expedition engaged in mapping out the Sahara
Desert for the British government. The next day, those
explorers will be taking refuge against a huge windstorm that
fills the air with sand. Two lovers-to-be are holed up in a
truck that strains against the ferocious clamor outside. One
of them, inspired by the danger, begins to tell the other
stories about the wind -- the Aajej, the Ghibli, and the
Simoon, a wind so terrible that a nation declared war on it.
The winds are harbingers for these characters, like the
waters that sweep a swimming man downstream no matter how he
struggles against the current. Nations at war conjure up a
ferocious storm, tearing lovers apart and bringing others
caroming together at odd angles. THE ENGLISH PATIENT is the
kind of movie that makes you want to interpret everything you
see, that makes you keenly aware that everything can have
meaning.</P>
<P>Director Anthony Minghella (TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY) has freely
adapted Michael Ondaatje's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel into
a flavorful melange, weaving through time from 1944 Italy to
late 1930s Egypt and back again before tracing careful steps
tying the two stories together. In the one tale,
French-Canadian nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche, radiant as
ever) deserts her Red Cross convoy to care for a badly burned
man identified only as "English patient" -- he was rescued by
Bedouin tribesmen after Nazi gunners shot his plane out of
the air over the Sahara. This patient is essentially a corpse
waiting to lose consciousness, but he retains some shred of
good humor; under interrogation over his nationality, he
cracks, "I'm a bit of toast, my friend -- butter me and slip
a poached egg on top."</P>
<P>Nationality matters a great deal as World War II winds down,
and being revealed as a German would be the worst fate to
befall a patient in an Italian hospital circa 1944, even one
so badly scarred as this. We soon learn that he's not English
at all; he's the Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph
Fiennes), and he was a cartographer in the employ of the
British government. It's the tale leading up to that
beautifully rendered but ill-fated flight over the Sahara
which constitutes the second, arguably more compelling, story
of THE ENGLISH PATIENT.</P>
<P>It's an absolute pleasure to follow these characters through
the film's 160-minute length. Minghella is a confident
director surrounded by expert performers, and he's created a
swooning, full-tilt epic of desire, betrayal, war-tattered
lives, and landscapes shaped like a woman's body. Navigating
a world littered with bombs and mines, these characters
nurture passions that will reverberate across borders and
echo through time. Chief among these is the wickedly
intellectual affair between Almasy and Katherine Clifton
(Kristin Scott Thomas), the wife of another member of his
expedition.</P>
<P>Meanwhile (at least in terms of screen time), Hana is falling
in love, not with her patient, but with Kip (Naveen Andrews)
a Sikh bomb disposal expert who enters her life by shooing
her away from the monastery's piano -- he fears the Germans
have mined it, and he's right. Kip sets up camp nearby, and
helps Hana care for her patient. He tries to read Rudyard
Kipling aloud to the patient, and the two of them get into an
argument over the prose. "Your eye is too impatient," the
patient scolds him. "Think about the speed of his pen."
Later, Kip will lure Hana to his bedroom with a trail of
snail-shell lamps, and will send her on a rope-and-pulleys
tour of a frescoed church. Such shamelessly romantic conceits
are the stuff that makes this film go, and mostly it just
goes beautifully.</P>
<P>Scott Thomas's performance has been singled out for special
praise, but in truth they are all remarkable, from Fiennes'
handsomely tormented lead to Willem Dafoe's mysterious,
thumbless Caravaggio. John Seale's cinematography is mostly
stunning, although the sameness of the orange tones gets to
be a little much in such a lengthy outing. Film editor Walter
Murch (instrumental in the editing and sound design of
APOCALYPSE NOW) doubtless deserves special praise for his
world-class technique -- Minghella acknowledges that the
film's mostly seamless feat of flitting over and over again
from setting to setting was largely conceived and achieved in
the cutting room. Murch's instinctive cutting style is a big
part of what makes THE ENGLISH PATIENT so convincing. In the
final scenes, as Binoche hitches a ride to Florence on the
back of a truck, we cross-cut from a shot of that biplane,
once again in the sky over the Sahara, to a shot of Binoche's
face, reaching some kind of resolution at last, to a shot of
trees on the roadside, filtering and flickering the sunlight
as we ride past, and finally to the sun itself, blazing pure
white on the cinema screen (the credits roll over this in
black). I can't explain exactly what such a sequence means --
but if I could, it wouldn't be pure cinema. It is.</P>
<P>The big-screen tricks Minghella brings to bear on this story
aren't exactly high-concept, but they work like a charm --
the biplane flight that opens and closes the film is
impossibly romantic and surreal (to ironic effect), Fred
Astaire sings "Cheek to Cheek" on the soundtrack (to
devastating effect), and a crucial plane crash in the latter
reels is almost frighteningly effective -- you feel like the
audience at one of the first demonstrations of moving
pictures, who reportedly leapt out of their seats with fear
as a locomotive apparently bore down upon them. If anything,
THE ENGLISH PATIENT has too many ideas and too much
portentous symbology for its own good -- a common affliction
of movies that try to pack too many signs and metaphors from
source novels into their own text. For its flaws, and despite
a patch during the third act where it seems to lose its way,
THE ENGLISH PATIENT is one bold melodrama. From beginning to
end, it's gasping for air and striving for greatness. It
never quite reaches that summit, but it's an intoxicating
view all the same.<HR>Written and Directed by Anthony Minghella
