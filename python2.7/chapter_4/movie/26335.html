EYE OF THE STORM (1991)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>According to Hitchcock and various other filmmakers,
isolated motels, diners, gas stations and similar
establishments in American Southwest can be rather dangerous
place for weary travellers. At the beginning of EYE OF THE
STORM, 1991 German- American thriller directed by Yuri
Zeltser, one of such places becomes deadly for their owners
who get murdered during the stick up. Ten years later their
son Steven (played by Bradley Gregg), who was blinded during
the incident, still runs motel together with his older
brother Ray (played by Craig Sheffer). Hardly anything
happens there until alcoholic and abusive William Gladstone
(played by Dennis Hopper) gets stranded there with his
attractive wife Sandra (played by Lara Flynn Boyle). Their
unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that
would end in bloodshed.</P>
<P>Yuri Zeltser, author of this film, was obviously inspired by
Hitchcock's PSYCHO, but he chose to add some new and
potentially interesting elements to the original plot.
Instead of Norman Bates we have two brothers - one of them
traumatised physically, another mentally. Sexual tension
between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is
heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband. EYE OF
THE STORM is impressive in visual sense, with photography by
Karl Walter Lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic
atmosphere. The acting is fine - Hopper, Gregg and Boyle are
comfortable with their roles, but Sheffer at times overacts
his psycho routine. Unfortunately, EYE OF THE STORM, which
was supposed to be intense psychological drama, deteriorates
into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic
finale. In the end, this film reminds us that original
approach can't prevent filmmakers from wasting too many
opportunities.</P>
<P>(Special note to the PROFILER fans: Ally Walker appears in
the beginning of the film in the small role of killer's
girlfriend.)</P>
