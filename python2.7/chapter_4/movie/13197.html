<P>   An ingenious mixture of (so to speak) broad comedy and
poignance, "Slums of Beverly Hills" works as both a
heartwarming ode to the joy of family living and screwball
comedy; not untypical ingredients in a teenager's coming-of-
age tale.  With an old pro like Alan Arkin anchoring the story
as the down-on-his-luck father of three kids who love him just
the way he he is, "Slums of Beverly Hills" avoids the laugh-a-
second genre of TV sitcom.  Instead it provides a deeper, more solid
account of a month or so in the life of a 14-year-old whose
dad will try anything to secure for her a good education and
favorable role models.  The movie is well cast with Marisa
Tomei in one of her usual madcap role with Natasha Lyonne
ably matching Ms. Tomei's considerable talent.</P>
<P>   The story is told from the point of view of the 14-year-old
Vivian (Natasha Lyonne), a perspective that might both
amuse and surprise people who haven't a clue what it's like to
be a 14-year-old undergoing physical and emotional changes. 
Vivian is obsessed with her breasts, which--as her 65-year-old
dad, Murray (Alan Arkin) comfortably points out--seem to have
sprouted overnight.  The revelation is that she considers her
bosom too large, despite the advice of the matronly
saleswoman in the bra store who assures her, "Breasts are
wonderful; you'll see."  Vivian's family--which includes her
older brother Ben (David Krumholtz) and her kid brother
Rickey (Eli Marienthal), are always on the move.  Since their
dad's auto dealership has never been really successful, they
are forced to move out regularly in the middle of the night to
stay a step ahead of the landlord.  To allow Vivian to take
advantage of the excellent school system of Beverly Hills,
Murray makes sure to reside in the town--but in shabby, one-
bedroom quarters with fancy names in rooms that seem held
together by Scotch tape.  </P>
<P>   Murray's big chance comes when his rich brother Mickey
(Carl Reiner) asks him to board Mickey's drug-addicted and
wild daughter, Rita (Marisa Tomei).  The 28-year-old, secretly
pregnant woman is destined to introduce her innocent 
cousin Vivian to the meaning of womanhood, their connection
best brought out by the movie's most hilarious scene, a
Dionysian dance which the two take part in while tossing a
running vibrator between them.  Also doing his part to
introduce Vivian to sex is her neighbor Eliot (Kevin Corrigan),
a nice chap who happens to sell pot for a living (not
uncommon in California in 1976).  </P>
<P>   Tamara Jenkins, who wrote and directed the movie, does
well in showing the parallel needs of Vivian's 65-year-old dad,
a divorced man who is also concerned about his sexuality and
seeks to form a liaison with a prim and proper friend, Doris
(Jessica Walter).  Their alliance is unlikely to be a happy one,
as shown in one scene, a dinner party, in which Doris shrieks
when she discovers that Vivian has ruined the needlepoint
cover on her chair when Vivian's period begins without
warning.</P>
<P>   Nothing is particularly new about "Slums of Beverly Hills,"
but splended performances particularly by Alan Arkin,
Natasha Lyonne and Kevin Corrigan make the picture a
welcome addition along with "Home Before Dark" to your
repertory of coming-of-age entertainments.</P>
