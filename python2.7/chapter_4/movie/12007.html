<P>Capsule Review:
A Memo to Hollywood; if you must persist in cranking out big-budget retreads
of classic foreign films, then this is the way to do it - as a subtle and
intelligent reimagining of the source material (in this case Wim Wenders'
ethereally lovely 1987 Wings of Desire) rather than a slavish frame-by-frame
duplication. It's hard to believe that Nicolas Cage hasn't used up all of
his different facets as an actor by now, but he delivers another inspired
performance here, comparable in its fumbling otherness to Jeff Bridges'
sublime work in Starman, as an Angel who falls in love with Meg Ryan. The
plot does come awfully close at times to shifting into Touched by an Angel
style hokum (the spirits interact with humanity much more here than in the
original film), but director Brad Silberling, displaying a talent that was
difficult to spot amid all the ILM effects of his debut Casper, does a
superb job of keeping the narrative grounded. (He also makes his L.A.
locations look almost as gorgeously fresh and new as Wenders' Berlin.) On
its own terms, City of Angels is an unusually resonant romantic drama; as a
remake that doesn't insult the original, it's borderline miraculous.</P>
