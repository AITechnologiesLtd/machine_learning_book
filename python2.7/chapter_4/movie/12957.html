<P>Basically, "Last Days of Disco" sold out minutes before I got to the
movie theater.  The people right in front of me were the first ones
turned away, one of those if-I-hadn't-sat-on-my-ass-those-five-minutes
moments.  But I did want to see "The Spanish Prisoner", having liked
"House of Games" a lot when I saw it a few years ago.</P>
<P>"The Spanish Prisoner" is the story of a man caught in an elaborate
con, to separate him from the industrial secrets he holds.  He's the
inventor of "the Process", which will apparently allow his company to
corner the market, or something like that.  Perhaps he works for
Gilette, and what they're talking about is the new Mach 3 razor, with
three (!) blades instead of two.  Perhaps not.  It's immaterial: the
book he has, with the Process scribbled down as a jumble of nonsense
mathematics (clearly taking place in the age before computers) is the
object of this game.</P>
<P>David Mamet is supposed to be a master of dialog.  I thought the dialog
was remarkably annoying in this film.  He feels compelled to make his
actors repeat things, over and over again.  In "House of Games", this
trick conveys a sense of menace, of deliberate probing.  It works.  In
"Spanish Prisoner", it reminded me of a scene from "The Simpsons", in
which Bart (or Homer) approaches a moment of epiphany.  Random words
and noises sound like the thing he's trying to think of (though,
probably, if it was Homer, he got it wrong).  "Spanish Prisoner" was
like this, with the repetitions pointing to something obvious, which
the audience should have seen many, many minutes before the folks on
screen.</P>
<P>The ending also feels patched together.  There was another con
working.  When it started is unclear: there were no moments when,
thinking back on the film, you could have said, ah ha!  It comes out of
thin air, a deus ex machina, thorougly unexplained and unjustified.
The cons fall into two classes, then: those that are telegraphed well
in advanced, and those that come out of the blue.  Neither is
particularly satisfying.</P>
<P>The comparison with "House of Games" is inevitable.  There are a series
of cons throughout "House", but they all have these retrospective ah-ha
moments.  They make sense.  Cons are also seen to fail because of
contingency: someone in the wrong spot at the wrong time, etc.  The con
men are not omniscient, not omnipotent.  We seem them improvise when
things go wrong.  And they sometimes fail because of accidents.</P>
<P>As a bonus in "House of Games", we see some secondary cons: ways to
lift money out of an envelope, tricks you can play in a Western Union
office, the idea of a tell.  In that film, you have a feeling that
you're being let into the con man's world, a gritty place of
smoke-shrouded poker games and greasy spoon diners.  This impression
that you're seeing things you're not supposed to see is missing from
"Spanish Prisoner".  "Prisoner" plays out as a caper film of high money
and elaborate contrivances.  It's nothing in particular.</P>
<P>One minor plus with "Prisoner", though, is that it was apparently
filmed in my neighborhood.  They use the 79th Street IRT, and shoot a
few scenes outside the Althrop, this hulking building at 79th and
Broadway (It's apparently hollow on the inside, with a court yard.
Rich people live there.)</P>
<P>"The court determined that Fox TV does not impede free and fair
competition in the teen-angst soap-com genre, therefore Party of Five
need not be broken into five 'Parties of One,' one being distributed to
each of the other networks."</P>
