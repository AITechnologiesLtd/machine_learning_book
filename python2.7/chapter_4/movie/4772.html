<PRE>                                UNFORGETTABLE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Winner of this year's "Most Ironic Title" award, UNFORGETTABLE is
anything but, taking a subject with some promise--memory transfer--and
managing to butcher it into a hackneyed thriller.</P>
<P>     UNFORGETTABLE reteams star Linda Fiorentino with director John Dahl,
who worked so well together in 1994's THE LAST SEDUCTION.  Unfortunately,
Fiorentino, who was mentioned more than once as that year's best actress,
has been in free-fall ever since, starting with JADE and now turning to
this.  In UNFORGETTABLE, Ray Liotta plays David Krane, a Seattle medical
examiner whose wife was murdered years earlier.  Krane was the prime
suspect, but a technicality got him off, all the while with him protesting
his innocence (yes, it's O.J. *again*).</P>
<P>     When a similar crime takes place, Krane goes on he prowl for the
killer, eventually hooking up with Martha Briggs (Fiorentino), a ditzy
neurobiologist who has invented a serum which, when combined with
someone's cerebro-spinal fluid, can transfer memories.  Krane steals some
of the serum and experiences the lives (and gruesome deaths) of the murder
victims, including his wife.  All the while, the side effects begin to
take their toll on Krane's body, as he tries to solve the case before they
become fatal.</P>
<P>     Sadly, UNFORGETTABLE is somehow able to be confusing and predictable
at the same time, relying on mild shock value and graphic violence to keep
the viewer interested.  It doesn't really work, and the picture drags on
until the silly ending and the requisite playing of Nat King Cole's title
song.  Dahl's direction is otherwise good, but it's wasted on Bill
Geddie's dull script.  The supporting cast (including Peter Coyote,
Christopher McDonald, Kim Cattrall, and David Paymer) perform with
workmanlike effort--there's really not a lot here for them to do, as the
story just gets in the way.</P>
<P>     All said and done, do like the moviegoing public will do when
UNFORGETTABLE is screened:  forget it.</P>
