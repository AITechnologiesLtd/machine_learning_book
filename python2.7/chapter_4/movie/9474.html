A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:
Taylor Hackford</PRE>
<PRE>Written by:
Jonathan Lemkin and Tony Gilroy</PRE>
<P>Starring: Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Satan, yuppie lawyer and wife, moral decisions, hallucinations</P>
<P>Synopsis:
Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves ) is an upcoming ambitious yuppie lawyer with
a beautiful wife and a religious mother. When small town guy Lomax gets
hand picked to join a prestigious New York law firm, he brings his
family to New York. But he doesnt realize its part of an even larger
picture concerning God, the Devil, and the world. The film Devils
Advocate is a cross between a back-in-time-loop flick and a morality
play. Lomax, a man of average morality and resistance to temptation,
eventually discovers he is not who he thinks he is; he is actually part
of a divine comedy where the price of making an immoral decision is the
end of the world.</P>
<P>Opinion:
This is one of those films that seemed long and not particularly
exciting when I watched it. Typically, we get to watch Mary Ann Lomax
(Charlize Theron) spend many minutes selecting wallpaper, followed by a
partial face morph of one of her neighbors into a demon and back to
normal again, followed by another long period of selecting wallpaper and
so on and so forth - - which makes the movie seem unexciting.</P>
<P>I felt better a few days after the movie was over and I had time to
think about the story, and the infinite time loop Lomax is stuck in, and
how - - if he ever makes a mistake - - it means the end of the world. </P>
<P>This film boasts a talented cast and interesting cinematography. For
example, in terms of cinematography, the standard fades and wipes
between scenes are replaced in Devils Advocate by scenic time lapse
photography of clouds and lightning or by pans of medieval ceiling
paintings. Pacinos monologues as Satan can be mesmerizing, and Charlize
Theron displays great acting range in portraying a wife slowly losing
her sanity.</P>
<P>Trivia:
In the story, Lomaxs boss goes by the name of John Milton. This is a
play on words and an insight into what Devils Advocate is supposed to
be about. In real life John Milton was the moralistic 17th century
English author (1608-1674) who wrote the classic poem Paradise Lost
(published first in 1667). Milton believed he had been called upon to
serve as a poet/priest of Gods will. Typical of Miltons main works
('Paradise Lost,' Samson Agonistes,' 'Paradise Regained') is the
underlying theme of a messianic hero in a fallen world who is eventually
led to a clearer understanding of his own divine role.</P>
