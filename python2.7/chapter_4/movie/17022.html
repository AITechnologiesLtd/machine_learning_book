<PRE>8MM
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>So ask yourself what "8MM" ("Eight Millimeter") is really all about.</P>
<P>Is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values 
after becoming enmeshed in the seedy, sleazy underworld of hardcore 
pornography?</P>
<P>Is it about the business itself, how, bubbling just beneath the surface 
of big-town Americana, there's a sordid world of sick and depraved 
people who won't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy 
their sick and twisted desires?</P>
<P>Or is it about those who can, those who are in a position to influence 
the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see?  
I'm not talking about snuff films, supposed "documentaries" of victims 
being brutalized and killed on camera.  I'm talking about films like 
"8MM" and its director, Joel Schumacher.  With a recent run of big 
budget movies to his credit--"Batman & Robin," "A Time to Kill," "Batman 
Forever," "The Client"--Schumacher certainly has that kind of influence.</P>
<P>Is "8MM" something you really want to see?  Probably not.</P>
<P>The first two-thirds of "8MM" unwind as a fairly conventional missing 
persons drama, albeit with a particularly unsavory core.  Then, as it's 
been threatening all along, the film explodes into violence.  And just 
when you think it's finally over, Schumacher tags on a ridiculous 
self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down 
even further.</P>
<P>Trust me.  There are better ways to waste two hours of your life.</P>
<P>Nicolas '"Snake Eyes"' Cage plays private investigator Tom Welles who 
is hired by a wealthy Philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of 
film found in her late husband's safe documents a young girl's murder.  
Welles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly, and the pieces 
of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly, almost as if you don't need 
any specialized skills or training to do this.  Welles certainly makes 
it look easy.  And cops, obviously, never look in toilet tanks for 
clues.</P>
<P>The deeper Welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he 
becomes, like George C. Scott in Paul Schrader's "Hardcore."  
Occasionally, a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets 
winding through a film projector, reminding him of his unpleasant task.</P>
<P>There are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife, played 
by Catherine Keener, who is frustrated by her husband spending all of 
his time in Cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in 
Harrisburg, PA.</P>
<P>"8MM" doesn't condemn or condone its subject matter, it just exploits 
it.  The irony, of course, is that Schumacher and "Seven" scribe Andrew 
Kevin Walker's vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they 
can show in an R-rated, first-run Hollywood product.  So we only see 
snippets of snuff, and a lot more footage of Nicolas Cage covering his 
face in horror.  Later it's the turn of Joaquin Phoenix (who's quite 
good and by far the film's most interesting character as adult bookstore 
flunky Max California ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is 
screened over and over again.</P>
<P>All this to get to the familiar yet offensive "revelation" that sexual 
deviants are not, indeed, monsters but everyday people like you and me.  
Neither Super nor Standard, "8MM" is shocking only in its banality.</P>
