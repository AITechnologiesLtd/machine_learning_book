<P>"I seem to have glued myself... to myself."</P>
<P>Starring Jason Biggs, Seann William Scott, Chris
Klein, Thomas Ian Nichols, Allyson Hannigan, Shannon
Elizabeth, Natasha Lyonne, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari,
Eugene Levy, Jennifer Coolidge. Directed by J.B.
Rogers. Rated R.</P>
<P>American Pie 2 reunites the cast members from American
Pie in a different setting; instead of being high
school seniors looking to score before they graduate,
they are now past their first year of college and have
gathered in a beach house to enjoy the summer of their
lives. Jim (Jason Biggs) is still an insecure geek
looking to improve his performance, Oz (Chris Klein)
is still the sweetest guy on the block, having
sickeningly saccharine phone conversations with his
studying-abroad girlfriend, Stifler (Seann William
Scott) is still a horny stoner, Kevin (Thomas Ian
Nichols) still has no personality and Finch (Eddie
Kaye Thomas) still longs for Stifler's Mom. Have I
missed anyone?</P>
<P>So, obviously, not much has changed. This is not a
problem, provided that the movie boasts the rapid-fire
hilarity and unexpectedly true sentiment of the
original. But American Pie 2 is the very definition of
"sequelitis." It's coarser, yes, and it pushes the
envelope even more, but its heart isn't in it. It's
easy cash to capitalize off the first film's success,
but it would have been a worthier investment to
prolong the franchise by coming up with something
original.</P>
<P>Part of the reason why the film doesn't work, I think,
is that while in the original the kids' quest for sex
was a coming-of-age stepping stone as much as an
outlet for their horniness. Here, everything has been
cheapened. They behave like those idiot frat boys who
kill themselves drinking; they have no motivation
except for sex, sex, beer and sex. That's not to say
that you can't make a decent comedy from that premise,
but it is one of American Pie 2's undoings.</P>
<P>Missing, too, is the sweetness that permeated American
Pie, the this-could-be-you quality of the main
players. Here, the characters are too aware of
themselves as pop-culture icons, and they're even more
one-note. Stifler and Finch are now caricatures while
Jim, Oz and Kevin are forced to make awkward
self-discoveries at arbitrary moments, none of them
betraying what the writers think the audiences want to
see.</P>
<P>And then there's the soon-to-be-notorious scene where
Jim superglues "himself to himself," which perfectly
demonstrates yet another of the film's ailments, one
that also permeated Say It Isn't So, director J.B.
Rodgers' debut. There's a fine line between comedy and
abject humiliation, and American Pie 2 is on the wrong
side of it. It's hard to laugh at the characters when
you are profoundly embarrassed for them. I shielded my
eyes watching this more than I have watching any
horror movie.</P>
<P>If there's one redeeming factor to American Pie 2,
it's the inimitable Eugene Levy as Jim's dad, who pops
in on Jim as he's about to score and utters lines like
"your mother and I have been known to get frisky...
not so much anymore, but..." and then when the girl's
parents walk in, blurts out "this must be your
daughter! I didn't get her name, but hopefully my son
did."</P>
<P>If only the rest of the movie had the wit and wisdom
of Levy's performance. This is an unworthy sequel to a
gross-fest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy.
The box-office of this onw should keep the genre going
strong, which is disappointing. The genre needs a
hiatus; filmmakers are getting lazy. </P>
