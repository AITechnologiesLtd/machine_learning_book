<PRE><HR>                      TOMORROW NEVER DIES (1997)
                    A film review by Ram Samudrala<HR></PRE>
<P>As has been repeated several times, the demise of Communism in the
Soviet Union is one of the worst things to happen to Hollywood.
Dozens of plot devices were no longer available. Some writers,
however, kept going, dishing out the same plots, only realising later
that they could no longer bank on the anti-Communist tendencies that
were present in the general populace to carry the movie.  However, a
few movies in Hollywood managed to reinvent themselves.  Fortunately
for us, the James Bond series is one of them.</P>
<P>In the latest James Bond flick, /Tomorrow Never Dies/, not only do we
see cooperation between the Imperialists and the Communists, we see a
more confident Pierce Brosnan playing James Bond, and the contentment
of knowing that the more some things change, the more they stay the
same.</P>
<P>Brosnan is definitely the right person to play 007. Neither George
Lazenby nor Timothy Dalton were very charismatic, and Roger Moore and
Sean Connery are not as young (though it would be interesting to see a
Bond movie set in the future (i.e., depicting an old or retired Bond),
with Connery returning).  To his credit, Brosnan appears to have
settled into the driver's seat, making the depiction of James Bond
/Tomorrow Never Dies/ one of the best.</P>
<P>The plot in /Tomorrow Never Dies/ is essentially the same as 
other Bond movies.  The movie opens with a great action sequence, even
better than the one in /Goldeneye/, which depicts Bond preventing a
plane carrying nuclear weapons from being destroyed by a missile.  The
credits sequence is spectacular, primarily due to the presence of an
"electronic figurine". </P>
<P>Soon we switch gears and learn of an evil media tycoon, Elliot Carver
(Jonathan Pryce), who seeks to control how information is distributed
around the world.  Carver is a character who literally is symbolic of
people like Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch, but he reminded me of Bill
Gates.  Of course, the ultimate goal of this control is the epitome of
capitalism: acquisition of wealth.  How ironic then that a movie
series that relied on anti-communist tendencies now relies on
anti-capitalist tendencies to sell itself.</P>
<P>Carver's idea of information control involves being the source of
information generated, so he can be the "first" to distribute it.  To
this end, he manages to create a situation, through the use of his
technology, where China and the United Kingdom are almost at war with
each other.  Bond is assigned to stop him.</P>
<P>As Bond goes about his job, he runs into Carver's loyal henchman
Stamper (Gotz Otto), Dr. Kaufman (Vincent Schiavelli), one of the most
humourous characters in the movie, Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh), a Chinese
agent who helps Bond fight Carver, and Paris Carver (played listlessly
by Teri Hatcher) an old flame of Bond.</P>
<P>At this point, the burning questions are: how long does it take before
Bond gets to sleep with Paris and Wai Lin? How many times does Carver
try to kill Bond and Wai Lin?  Who dies first: Stamper or Carver?  And
so on. For answers to these, you have to see the movie.</P>
<P>So while it may seem like a lot has changed, but in some ways, the
Bond movie series has still remained the same.</P>
<P>Brosnan and Yeoh are well-matched.  I much prefer Yeoh, who is fairly
charismatic, to many of the other ladies Bond has been paired up with.
Pryce plays a brilliant over-the-top villain. One of the most amusing
scenes in the movie is when Carver mockingly imitates Wai Lin's kicks
and punches, ending with "pathetic!"</P>
<P>The main problem I had with the movie was the less-than-perfect
production.  Perhaps it was due to filming in a foreign country, but
there's a lot of awkwardness among the extras, which indicates that
not enough footage was collected, or  enough attention wasn't paid on
the cutting room floor.  But since I like Jackie Chan movies, this is
only a minor nitpick as far as I am concerned.</P>
<P>The other problems include a suggested conflict between M (Judi Dench)
and a British general, which is never exploited fully.  The one-liners
by Moneypenny (Samantha Bond), whose role entailed little more making
little quips, irked me.  Finally, there is little inventiveness
(unlike in Jackie Chan movies) involved in how Bond gets out of the
scrapes he gets himself from. </P>
<P>The premise of the movie isn't that far off from reality.  Given the
direction intellectual property laws are heading, nothing short of a
police state will ensure that the so-called "owners of information"
profit from every use of the information.  And who said a Bond movie
isn't thought-provoking?</P>
