<P>         When it was released in Japan in 1997, the animated epic
"Mononoke Hime" captivated audiences -- it's currently second only to
"Titanic" in the list of Japan's biggest box office hits -- and
attracted the attention of American producers. But director Hayao
Miyazaki (whose other creations include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kiki's
Delivery Service") wasn't about to let his work be reshaped to suit U.S.
tastes. That's why, even with the addition of some familiar voices on
the soundtrack, "Princess Mononoke" retains its distinctively Japanese
flavor.</P>
<P> Miyazaki's film is a far cry from the Disneyfied world of
animation. Its complex, winding plot does not pause for musical numbers
or comic relief, and the violence in the story is not bloodless. Most of
"Mononoke" is dark and unsettling, and yet it's weirdly lovely as well.
Even if you lose track of the story -- and it is sometimes a challenge
to keep up with all the developments -- the movie's steady flow of
exotic, powerful images remains riveting.</P>
<P> "Mononoke" is set in Japan's Iron Age, "the days of gods and
demons," according to the narration. While saving his village from an
attacking Curse God (which looks like a gigantic, maggot-infested boar),
the young hero Ashitaka (voice of Billy Crudup) is wounded by the animal
and is forced to head west to search for a magical cure.</P>
<P> While journeying through a world full of "angry ghosts,"
Ashitaka encounters the haughty Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), who runs
the community of Irontown and who has managed to round up a band of
warriors and lepers to help her destroy the elusive Forest Spirit. But
this magnificent semi-transparent creature is under the protection of
Eboshi's arch-enemy San (Claire Danes), a girl raised in the wild, who
bewitches Ashitaka.</P>
<P> "Mononoke" delivers a none-too-subtle message about
conservation and respect for nature, but the film is so well-crafted it
never feels preachy. Although it's slightly disconcerting at first to
hear the easily identifiable Gillian Anderson speaking for the wolf
mother Moro or Billy Bob Thornton reading the part of the scheming monk
Jigo, the voice work is generally fine and most of the performers have
been smartly cast.</P>
<P> Even without the dialogue, "Mononoke" would still be compelling
for its visuals alone. Inspired by Japanese mythology, Mizayaki and his
teams of animators have conjured up an eerie dreamscape full of monsters
both good and evil, as well as the tiny spectral "koodamas," curious
sprites with rattling, rotating heads. Whether you're a devotee of
animation or simply interested in Eastern culture, seeing "Princess
Mononoke" is a must. James Sanford</P>
