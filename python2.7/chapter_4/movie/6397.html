<P>     JINGLE ALL THE WAY represents Arnold Schwarzenegger's fourth 
attempt at a "straight" comedy (I'm not counting LAST ACTION HERO or 
TRUE LIES, which were highly action-oriented), and, like the others that 
came before it, this movie isn't all that funny.  While it's true that 
the driving idea behind putting Schwarzenegger in this kind of picture -
- the big, hulking action hero struggling to overcome "normal" problems 
-- has potential, the film makers never attempt anything really 
ambitious.  The result is a pastiche of silly, cartoonish action and 
variably amusing physical humor.</P>
<P>     Another problem with JINGLE ALL THE WAY is the premise, which lacks 
the substance and comic potential to form the basis of a feature-length 
movie.  JINGLE ALL THE WAY seems hopelessly dragged out, as if the film 
makers came up with a great pitch, then, once they got the go-ahead, 
couldn't figure out how to extend things beyond TV sit-com length.  
Consequently, the picture sags noticeably in the middle as the director 
and screenwriters fight to extend the running length.</P>
<P>     Almost everyone has memories of a birthday, Christmas, or other 
holiday when they either got or didn't get a gift they had been 
coveting.  From a parent's perspective, trying to purchase such a 
present, especially if it's the "hot" toy of the year (remember Cabbage 
Patch Dolls and Transformers?), can be an agonizing experience, 
especially if they wait until the last minute.  In JINGLE ALL THE WAY, 
it's Christmas Eve, and Howard Langston (Schwarzenegger) is desperate to 
get the TurboMan action figure for his son, Jamie (Jake Lloyd).  Howard, 
a workaholic, has been neglecting his family lately, and he sees this as 
an opportunity to redeem himself.  Unfortunately, all the stores are 
sold out.  The result is a crazy, surreal series of misadventure through 
the streets and malls of Minneapolis.  Along the way, he encounters a 
rival (Sinbad) on the same quest, a mirthless police officer (Robert 
Conrad) who likes giving out tickets, and a con-artist Santa (James 
Belushi).  Meanwhile, as Howard is scouring the city for the last 
TurboMan, his bachelor next door neighbor, Ted (Phil Hartman), is 
getting closer to his wife, Liz (Rita Wilson).</P>
<P>     Back when TWINS was released, the idea of putting Schwarzenegger in 
a comedy was both audacious and innovative.  And, for the most part, it 
worked -- at least the first time.  TWINS wasn't the funniest film of 
the year, but there was a certain appeal in watching the big man in such 
an atypical role.  Then came KINDERGARTEN COP and JUNIOR, each lessons 
in diminishing returns.  Now that we've seen this conceit repeatedly, 
the uniqueness has worn off.  Schwarzenegger is, after all, more of a 
personality than an actor, so there are limits to how much he can bring 
to this role.</P>
<P>     JINGLE ALL THE WAY has its moments, all of which are lowbrow.  
Howard's madcap dash after a runaway super ball is worth a chuckle or 
two, as is his encounter with an unfriendly reindeer.  And certain 
aspects of the climax are legitimately hilarious.  Overall, however, the 
film is filled with too many stale spots.  The few attempts at 
satirizing the toy market are unfocused and not particularly daring.  
(Which begs the question:  could it be that there are real TurboMan 
dolls on the way?)  Sinbad, portraying a postal worker who is teetering 
on the edge, brings some life and energy to the production, but not 
enough to keep it from feeling much longer than it actually is.</P>
<P>     On the positive side, JINGLE ALL THE WAY is suitable for family 
consumption.  It's a genial, inoffensive movie, and all of the violence 
is exceedingly mild (people get punched and kicked, but no one is 
seriously injured).  The real problem with JINGLE ALL THE WAY has 
nothing to do with its suitability for certain age groups, but its 
suitability in general.  Being good-natured and family-friendly has 
little to do with being consistently entertaining.  JINGLE ALL THE WAY 
is forgettable, and that, more than anything else, is why I recommend 
passing up this holiday offering.</P>
