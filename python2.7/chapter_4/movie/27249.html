Finding Forrester</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>If "Good Will Hunting" and "Scent of a Woman" were to meet some moonlit 
night, consummate and make a child, "Finding Forester" would be their 
adolescent son. </P>
<P>Though less developed, matured, and fervent than its parents, 
"Forrester" draws from the same heart to make the same points. 
It's a warm mellow film. Warm in its development of the unlikely 
friendship between Sean Connery, (a cynical Pulitzer Prize winning 
recluse) and Brown, a 16-year-old basketballer from the Bronx. Mellow in 
its progression. Unfortunately, Director Gus Van Sant kicks back a 
little too long -- never really breaking into the intense back and forth 
of "Good Will Hunting" which he also directed. </P>
<P>Additionally, the piece feels harshly edited at times. For example, a 
trip to a basketball game ends in a baseball diamond -- not even a quick 
reference shot of a basketball game is given. 
Anyway, it's a nice enough film, quaint even. And one of the few films 
where the lead actor can actually aptly play the sport he's called to 
play. </P>
<P>I particularly enjoyed the following quote from the production notes. F. 
M. Abraham who plays Crawford the skeptical prep school teacher says of 
his character, "Crawford's ... a victim of his own pride and blindness. 
His tragedy is that he's failed the one great student he ever taught, 
squandered his chance at helping someone achieve true fame." </P>
