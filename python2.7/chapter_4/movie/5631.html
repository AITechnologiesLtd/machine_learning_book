<PRE>                                MODERN TIMES
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1936) **** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Not so modern, actually, but in the more than sixty years 
that have passed since MODERN TIMES was released, it has 
remained one of the indisputably hilarious classics of the early 
Hollywood era. Charlie Chaplin, the king of the silent film, made 
his last full-blown silent feature here, playing a hard-luck working 
class hero. MODERN TIMES flows effortlessly from set-up to 
set-up, setting a standard for physical comedy that has been 
seldom approached since, Woody Allen's BANANAS and 
SLEEPER almost being exceptions.</P>
<P>        Chaplin satirizes the world of corporate bureacracy and 
economic depression, playing an assembly line employee whose 
job is to screw nuts onto the parts as they go by. This provides 
instant opportunities for humor as Chaplin tries to keep pace with 
a speeded-up conveyor belt (in a sequence that undoubtedly 
inspired the famous "I Love Lucy" chocolate factory episode) 
and later goes becomes mentally unstable and starts screwing 
everything that moves (in a sequence that undoubtedly inspired 
Ted Kennedy).</P>
<P>        The movie shifts as Chaplin is carted off to an institution, 
is released and later sent to jail after accidentally setting off a 
workers' demonstration by picking up a red flag that fell off a truck 
and waving it in the air for the owner to see, thus attracting the 
workers who thought he was praising the virtues of Marxism and 
causing the authorities to see him as a Red. This kind of mistaken 
identity humor has been retooled over and over again these past 
six decades in movies and sitcoms but has never seemed so fresh 
and funny as it does here.</P>
<P>        MODERN TIMES, besides being one of the quintessential 
film comedies and a thinly-veiled critique of capitalism, also has 
some poignant romance moments as Chaplin meets a beautiful 
orphan girl (Paulette Goddard) and the two fall quickly in love, 
longing for a house to move into. Chaplin tries to find work to 
save up for the house, first as a night watchman in a department 
store and later as a singing waiter (who forgets the lyrics and has 
to instead sing a hilarious nonsense song).</P>
<P>        The whole movie is a wonderful experience, and it's even 
more amazing that such a piece of entertainment was constructed 
with no dialogue. But that Charlie Chaplin was a comedic genius, 
even if he did have the same moustache as Hitler. Aside from 
scripting, directing and starring in MODERN TIMES, he also wrote 
the famous song "Smile" for this film, half a century before Michael 
Jackson got his gloves on it for his effeminate cover version on the 
HIStory album. So the man has inspired not only the face of modern 
comedy but a certain corner of pop music as well, although I doubt 
that moustache of his will ever come back in style.</P>
