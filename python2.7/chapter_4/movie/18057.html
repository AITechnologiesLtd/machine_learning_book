<PRE>Open Your Eyes(Abre Los Ojos) ***</PRE>
<P>rated R
in Spanish with English subtitles
an Artisan Films release
starring Eduardo Noriega, Penelope Cruz, Chete Lera, Fele Martinez,
Gerard Barray, Pepe Navarro, Najwa Nimri
written by Alejandro Amenabar and Mateo Gil
directed by Alejandro Amenabar</P>
<P>As anyone who has seen The Matrix and eXistenZ knows, this year we
have has an abundance of exceptional science-fiction films. I am not a
very big sci-fi fan, but as the year 2000 approaches, these films have
begun to fascinate me immensely.</P>
<P>The latest entry into the genre, Alejandro Amenabar's psychological
thriller Open Your Eyes, suffers from bad timing. While the film is
indeed very good, I have seen it shortly after two very similar
films(look in the first paragraph), and the originality doesn't strike
me nearly as much as it could have.</P>
<P>Open Your Eyes is the story of Cesar(Eduardo Noriega), a young,
handsome, wealthy Spanish man who finds himself accused of a murder
which he is sure he didn't commit(If you think this sounds like Dark
City, you're not the only one. Infact, the first scene of Open Your
Eyes, a dream sequence, shows Cesar waking up, going outside, and
realizing that there is no one on the streets). As he is interrogated
by a prison psychologist(Chete Lera), we, through the eyes of Cesar,
try to figure out exactly what happened.</P>
<P>Cesar decides to throw a party at his house, and his best friend
Pelayo(Fele Martinez) brings with him Sofia(Penelope Cruz), a
beautiful woman whom he met in the library.  Cesar falls instantly in
love, and he ends up taking her back to her home after the party.</P>
<P>After a night of chatting, they agree to meet again the next day. But
as Cesar walks outside, his lusty mistress, Nuria(Najwa Nimri), drives
by in her car, and begs him to join her for one last rendezvous.  He
gets in the car, and she ends up driving off the side of the road and
hitting a tree, killing herself and completely wrecking Cesar's face.</P>
<P>>From then on, the film goes through many, many twists as Cesar tries
to figure out what the hell is going on. There is a line in this
year's extraordinary The Matrix in which Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne)
asks: "Have you ever had a dream that you're so sure was real?  What
if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you tell the
difference between the dream world, and the real world?"</P>
<P>Open Your Eyes is essentially about our dreams, and the tricks that
our subconscious plays on us.  While the film is clever and
psychological, it is not as fun or stylish as The Matrix and eXistenZ.
Open Your Eyes is definitely worthy of an audience, as long as they're
not expecting the flash of the others. I'm sure I would have enjoyed
this film more had I seen it earlier, though.</P>
<P>Regardless, Alejandro Amenabar is a smashing new talent, and this film
was a hit in it's native Spain.  Penelope Cruz, who made her American
debut in last year's embarrasing The Hi-Lo Country, shows depth as
well as beauty, and hopefully her appeal will cross over to
America. Open Your Eyes is an incredible movie, and if this is not one
of the new sci/fi genre's best, then the genre's gonna thrive for a
long while. Once again, congrats to Artisan Films, quickly becoming
one of best distributors in film today.</P>
