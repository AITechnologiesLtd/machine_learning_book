<P>     NELL, Jodie Foster's return to dramatic acting following a
flirtation with MAVERICK's action-comedy, is an entirely human movie.
In this lush, green world of rolling hills and crystal pools,
technology is an unwelcome intruder; civilization, a threatening
monster.  Both are slaves to the avaricious.  NELL is about the
importance of communication and interaction, about how the events of
childhood shape a life, and about the difficulty--and rewards--of
reaching out to others.</P>
<P>     Nell (Foster) has lived her entire life alone in the woods with an
aging mother.  She is eventually discovered by a local doctor, Jerome
Lovell (Liam Neeson), who comes to her secluded, ramshackle hut on the
occasion of her mother's death.  Nell's panicked and hostile response
to strangers forces Jerome to travel to nearby Charlotte to recruit the
expert assistance of Dr. Paula Olsen (Natasha Richardson).  After
meeting the young woman, Paula's impression is that Nell should be
committed.  Jerome, horrified by this possibility, obtains a court
order to stop it.  The two opposing sides eventually argue the case
before a judge.  Deferring his verdict for three months, the judge
gives the two doctors that time to observe their subject, learn her
language, and present him with enough evidence to make an informed
decision.</P>
<P>     Jodie Foster's two Oscars are no fluke, as her simple-yet-profound
performance in NELL illustrates.  She is one of only a few actors
capable of so fully immersing herself in a character that it's possible
to forget the star behind the performance.  With Jack Nicholson or Al
Pacino, you watch a variation of the same personality; with Jodie
Foster, you see a new individual.</P>
<P>     Nell is an almost-childlike woman who speaks her own fractured
form of English, hides inside her house by day, and takes moonlight
swims in a nearby lake.  In Jerome and Paula, she finds a substitute
father and mother, and together, these three attempt to breach the
non-physical walls between them.  This, the real meat of NELL, is where
the film attains its depth and richness.</P>
<P>     At times, director Michael Apted, perhaps best known for his
documentaries (the SEVEN UP series, INCIDENT AT OGLALA), seems as
enamored with the scenery as with his actors.  The North Carolina
terrain is breathtaking, and Apted, along with cinematographer Dante
Spinotti, has created one of the most beautiful motion pictures of the
year.  It's a wonderful background for this tale.</P>
<P>     Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson are solid, but constantly in
Foster's shadow.  In a film as frequently introspective as NELL, it's
refreshing not to have the three main actors struggling to outdo each
other.  The gentle, unforced tone, once established, is
maintained--until the unfortunate climax.</P>
<P>     Sadly, SCENT-OF-A-WOMAN disease has infected NELL.  Perhaps the
writers couldn't think of a better way out of an admittedly-difficult
situation, but to pander to the "Hollywood mentality" of movie endings
is a unworthy way to wrap up what is otherwise a finely-crafted motion
picture.  Had the majority of NELL not been so impressive, the
lackluster final act wouldn't have been as disappointing.</P>
<P>     Despite this moderate tarnish, it is difficult to deny NELL's
intelligence and sensitivity.  We approach this story with the same
fascination that Nell faces each day, seeing, if only for a short time,
how different the world--and people--can be.  It is this impression
more than any other that stays with the viewer after the drama has been
played out and the final credits roll.</P>
