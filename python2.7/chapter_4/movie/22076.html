HIGH NOON
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>The more I think about classical westerns, the more I come
to the strange conclusion that classical westerns actually
weren't westerns at all. For most people, western is nothing
more than simple action/adventure story set in the Old West.
But the films that turned into classical westerns were
anything but simple; even when they fulfilled the
action/adventure criteria, they actually were multi-layered
dramas, with complex characters, subplots and raised issues
that could cause some serious head-scratching even for the
causal viewers. Such films used mythical setting of Old West
in order to ask some hard questions and discover unpleasant
answers about dark sides of American history, as well as the
state of human civilisation in general. One of such films
was HIGH NOON, 1952 film directed by Fred Zinnemann. This
film is often regarded as one of the best and most
influential films of all time.</P>
<P>The film is set in Hadleyville, small, dusty town in New
Mexico. Will Kane (played by Gary Cooper) is its
much-respected marshal, who has just retired in order to buy
store and live happily ever after with Amy (played by Grace
Kelly), beautiful Quaker girl. Two of them have just
married, when the terrible news comes from rail station.
Frank Miller (played by Ian Macdonald), convicted killer who
had been brought to justice by Kane, has just been pardoned,
is arriving on the noon train. Miller is being awaited by
three of his friends, and their intentions towards
ex-marshal are quite clear. After some hesitation, Kane, to
the great surprise of everyone, decides to stay in town and
face his enemies. But, while the clock is ticking, he finds
that good citizens of Hadleyville simply aren't prepared to
risk their lives and help Kane in the inevitable conflict.</P>
<P>When people today talk about HIGH NOON, they usually mention
it as a first, or at least, best known example of "real
time" plot technique. The events depicted in HIGH NOON are
set in a time span that corresponds with the running time of
the film. Such technique wasn't new, but other filmmakers
use it relatively rarely. Mostly it is due to some
limitations it puts on the story and characters, which often
make those films look like stage plays. But, it wasn't case
with HIGH NOON. Its director, Fred Zinnemann, knew how to
make a good and very effective movie out of this.</P>
<P>That happened mostly thanks to the great script by Carl
Foreman (whose later works would include a masterpiece like
THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI). The plot showed its universal
value by being used in many later films, including even an
interesting science fiction version in OUTLAND by Peter
Hyams. Reason for that lies in the fact that it uses the
universal theme of world's collective unconscious - a Lone
Hero that is about to defend the community/world from Evil.
Foreman's script goes further than that and brings another
motive - the conflict between idealistic Man As They Should
Be and conformist Man As They Are. And, after being exposed
to such conflicts and its consequences, viewers are
presented with heretical question: Is the community/world
really worth saving? Foreman gives an answer, symbolised in
gesture that was very controversial in its time and often
copied in the films made in later decades.</P>
<P>It was often noted that HIGH NOON could be seen as a
metaphor for the dilemmas that faced eminent figures in
Hollywood of its time. In the early 1950s, at the zenith of
anti-Communist hysteria, many actors, directors and
screenwriters were called by Senate Committee in order to
testify about alleged Communist influence in Hollywood.
Those who came in front of the Committee were often asked
questions about their own political convictions or
convictions of their colleagues and friends. If they
co-operated, they had to name names and they knew that even
the most innocent innuendo about someone's leftist leanings
could brand such person a Communist and practically end his
career in Hollywood. If they didn't, if they stood by their
friends or by the principles that personal political
convictions per se shouldn't brand anyone a criminal they
branded themselves a Communists. Such choice - between going
the easy way and betraying noble principles and the sense of
duty on one hand, and going the hard way and maintaining
this principle at all cost - could be seen in this movie
very well. Ironically, such uncompromising depiction of
conformism vs. noble ideals, and some other things, brought
a negative reputation to Foreman. He was soon blacklisted as
alleged Communist and had to write his best screenplays
under pseudonym, being rehabilitated only years after his
death.</P>
<P>This dramatic conflict, which is in the essence of HIGH
NOON, isn't just external confrontation between idealistic
marshals and his conformist and hypocritical citizens. This
conflict is also inner one; Foreman didn't portray Kane as
some kind of perfect, all-conquering hero. He has some
doubts, at first he succumbs to better judgement, being
blinded by the prospect of better future. But deep down he
knows that, even if he escapes the killers, he could never
escape his own conscience. This inner struggle is seen
through the almost always-painful expression by Gary Cooper,
playing one of the best roles of his life. The actor, who
had suffering from bleeding ulcer during the shooting, made
a splendid job by using his unfortunate health condition in
order to enhance the power of his performance.</P>
<P>The other actors are great too, especially those who play
supporting characters and provide many different and
interesting perspectives on the situation. Lon Chaney Jr.
gives short, but memorable speech as Kane's old mentor.
Thomas Mitchell is excellent as hypocritical leader of the
town. On the other hand, Grace Kelly, in one of her first
role, looks more like a plot gimmick, made in order to
embody ideals of Old West virtues than as a real and fresh
character. Katy Jurado, as no-nonsense and down-to-earth
Mexican saloon owner, compensates Grace Kelly's lack of
acting experience by providing her strong opposite.</P>
<P>The role played by Lloyd Bridges, although well played,
should have been left out of the picture. Harvey, Kane's
young and ambitious deputy, only complicated story that was
perfect in its simplicity. This is one of the major flaws in
this film that would otherwise be hailed as true
masterpiece. The other one is the title song, written by
Dimitri Tiomkin and sung by Tex Ritter, which is nice by
itself; unfortunately, it is overplayed during the whole
course of picture and gets really tedious. Luckily, those
flaws don't negate the strong impact this film would have on
the viewer, the impact that inspired many future filmmakers
and made HIGH NOON one of the most important pieces of
American film legacy.</P>
