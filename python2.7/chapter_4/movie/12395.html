<P>Given all the liberties Hollywood has taken with the classics lately -
spicing up "The Man In The Iron Mask" with scatological jokes; a "Romeo &
Juliet" boasting a disco-belting drag queen; Indian attacks and a happy
ending for Hester Prynne in the Demi Moore version of "The Scarlet Letter,"
etc. - it comes as a surprise to see director Bille August offering up a
perfectly straightforward and decidedly non-musical version of "Les
Miserables."</P>
<P>After all, the last Victor Hugo book to make it to the big screen was "The
Hunchback of Notre Dame," overhauled as a Disney animated spectacular
featuring singing gargoyles.</P>
<P>While there¹s something to be said for reverence, nobody said it had to come
at the expense of passion or imagination, and, sadly, "Miserables" comes up
short in both those departments.</P>
<P>Aside from being shot on somewhat stagy-looking sets and with sometimes
inappropriate lighting levels, there¹s nothing glaringly wrong with August¹s
film, and several of the performances are terrific. Why then does it seem
about as engaging as a well-written book report?</P>
<P>It¹s tempting to put the blame on August himself. Since his Oscar-winning
"Pelle the Conqueror," August has floundered, directing the dismal "House of
the Spirits," which somehow managed to squander the talents of Meryl Streep,
Glenn Close, Jeremy Irons and Winona Ryder, and "Smilla¹s Sense of Snow," a
silly attempt to film the complex best-seller. By the low standards set by
that pair, "Les Miserables" looks almost like a comeback.</P>
<P>In paring down Hugo¹s epic melodrama to its basics, screenwriter Rafael
Yglesias has chosen to focus on the novel¹s mid-section, beginning with the
parole of Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson) after two decades of serving hard time
in the quarries for stealing bread. In later years Valjean will end up as
mayor of the village of Vigau, where he oversees a tile factory.</P>
<P>One of his workers is Fantine (Uma Thurman), a young beauty struggling to
make ends meet. When it¹s revealed that the unmarried Fantine has had a
baby, Valjean¹s underlings fire her, sending her on a downward spiral into
prostitution and poverty.</P>
<P>Around the same time, Vigau gets a new prefect of police in the person of
Javert (Geoffrey Rush), formerly a guard in the prison where Valjean was
incarcerated. Javert eventually recognizes Valjean and does everything he
can to ruin the lives of Valjean, Fantine - who Valjean tries to help - and
later Fantine¹s child Cosette (Claire Danes), who Valjean adopts.</P>
<P>"Reform is a discredited fantasy," Javert tells his partners when they try
to suggest Valjean¹s nature has changed over the years. "People are either
law-abiders or law-breakers." The always subtle and detail-oriented Neeson
reads Valjean as a brute trying to reclaim his humanity, while Rush plays up
Javert¹s cold detachment from the same world Valjean is reaching out to.
Both actors are outstanding.</P>
<P>Thurman strains to deglamorize herself, but even when she¹s coughing up
blood at death¹s door she can¹t help looking seductive. Still, she¹s a
sympathetic Fantine, and Danes, despite a sometimes wavering accent,
sparkles as the noble, devoted Cosette.</P>
<P>If only the director had the same commitment to the material as his cast.
Unfortunately, August¹s mind seems to have been elsewhere, which accounts
for why "Les Miserables" often has a perfunctory feel, as if August was
satisfied with footage that was just good enough, instead of making the
extra effort required to achieve something truly great and memorable.</P>
