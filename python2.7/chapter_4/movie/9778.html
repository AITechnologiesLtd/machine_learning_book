<P>     Sequels have always been a popular means of cinematic 
entertainment, even back in the days of the old cliffhanger serials.  
After all, by using previously-established characters, there's a built-
in audience.  In recent years, it's almost an axiom that any film 
grossing $100 million will have a continuation, no matter how ludicrous 
the premise.  Walt Disney Pictures claims to have a policy against 
theatrical follow-ups to their "animated classics" (although this 
doesn't explain 1990's THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER), but that policy doesn't 
extend beyond the silver screen  THE LITTLE MERMAID was converted into a 
Saturday morning TV show.  ALADDIN already has two direct-to-video 
sequels (THE RETURN OF JAFAR and ALADDIN AND THE KING OF THIEVES).  Both 
THE LION KING and POCAHONTAS have new videotape adventures on the way.  
And, with the heavily-marketed release of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST: THE 
ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS, one of the family-friendly company's most-beloved 
features now has a new chapter.  </P>
<P>     The familiarity inherent in a sequel is a double-edged sword.  On 
the positive side, it allows us to visit old friends.  Less time can be 
spent establishing the characters, since we already know them, so it's 
possible to get into the heart of the story more quickly.  On the other 
hand, comparisons are inevitable, and, with a genuine classic of BEAUTY 
AND THE BEAST's stature, they're not likely to be favorable.  No matter 
how much effort was put into the production of THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS, 
there's no way it could live up to the standards established by its 
predecessor. </P>
<P>     As a direct-to-video effort, THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS is more than 
respectable.  It's far ahead of the two ALADDIN tapes, and is arguably 
better than Disney's latest animated theatrical feature, HERCULES.  It 
goes without saying that we're not getting something of comparable 
quality to the original BEAUTY AND THE BEAST -- the time, effort, and 
budget are considerably less, and it shows in many ways.  Surprisingly, 
the animation is one area that suffers only a minor degradation.  For 
the most part, it's crisp, clean, and smooth.  The computer generated 
sequences featuring the new villain, Forte the pipe organ, are 
impressive.  I was frankly impressed by how good THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS 
looks, especially considering the unevenness of the ALADDIN sequels.</P>
<P>     The biggest step down is in the writing.  THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS 
is clearly aimed at a young audience, with little consideration for the 
adults who may be watching.  The script isn't stupid or insulting, but 
it lacks the polish and maturity of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  The story, a 
"mid-quel" (as opposed to a prequel or sequel), occurs during a time 
period partway through the original film, presenting a "missing" chapter 
from the long interval when Belle (voice of Paige O'Hara) and the Beast 
(Robby Benson) are growing more fond of each other.  (Bookend THE 
ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS with the scenes from BEAUTY AND THE BEAST where the 
Beast saves Belle from the wolves and where he shows her the library.) 
The evil Forte (Tim Curry), the Beast's talking pipe organ and former 
court composer, is jealous of his master's attachment to Belle, and, 
along with his unwilling henchman, Fife (Paul Reubens), plots to destroy 
their relationship.  Meanwhile, Belle, with the aid of her friends 
Lumiere (Jerry Orbach), Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers), Mrs. Potts 
(Angela Lansbury), and the ornament Angelique (Bernadette Peters), plans 
to bring Christmas back to the gloomy castle, even though the Beast has 
strictly forbidden its celebration.  </P>
<P>     The best parts of THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS are those that 
concentrate on developing the relationship between Belle and the Beast.  
There's a scene where she tries to teach him to skate, and another where 
they reconcile after a misunderstanding.  Unfortunately, the film makers 
have added a lot of "adventure" to the mix, and, while this aspect of 
the movie may be fine for younger viewers, more sophisticated viewers 
will find it routine.  As a villain, Forte is neither sinister nor 
frightening (his inability to move is a distinct flaw), although he does 
get to utter a few delicious lines.  There are five new songs from the 
team of Rachel Portman and Don Black (who wrote the lyrics to "Diamonds 
are Forever"), all of which are more obligatory than inspired.  They're 
not bad, but they don't add a lot to the proceedings.</P>
<P>     The entire principal vocal cast is back, and they're all in fine 
form.  Joining them are Tim Curry as Forte, Paul Reubens as the flute-
like Fife, and Bernadette Peters as the angelic Angelique.  Combining 
well-known voices with familiar animated faces makes watching THE 
ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS a comfortable, genial experience.  It's not a 
classic, and the videotape won't get the same kind of play afforded to 
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, but, if only for the chance to spend 70 minutes 
with old friends, THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS is a welcome release.</P>
