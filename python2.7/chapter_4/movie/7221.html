<PRE>                             THAT OLD FEELING
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>There are very few comedians I've admired more than Carl Reiner.
Personable, obviously a sweet man, a terrific sense of humor, he was a
wit and comedian.   His contributions to the Show of Shows and The Sid
Caesar Show cannot be topped.  But that was back some 25-35 years ago.
Of late he has given us directorial mediocrities such as Fatal Instinct
and Sibling Rivalry.   What happened to the humor in Oh God!  (1977),
The Jerk (1979),  All Of Me (1984) and the hilarious, outrageous (for
1970) Where's Poppa?</P>
<P>THAT OLD FEELING is a rehash of all the old "Romantic Comedies" so that
even such natural comedians as Bette Midler, aided and abetted by
Dennis Farina (GET SHORTY), can do little to spark the film. There are
some funny lines but the situations are so absurd that it is more of a
farce than a romantic comedy which it obviously intended to be. . .
and that is a pity.</P>
<P>Lily (Midler) and Dan (Farina)  have been divorced twelve years and
they are both happily enjoying their lives.  Lily is a movie star,  Dan
is a journalist. Lily has taken a new husband, Alan, (David Rasche)
who is an author of best-selling pop psychology while it is evident
that if anyone needs psychological help, he is a prime candidate.</P>
<P>Dan, too, has re-married.  His new spouse is the lovely Rowena (Gail
O'Grady).  So everyone should be happy, right? WRONG.  Lily and Dan
have a daughter, Molly (Paula Marshall), and Molly is about to marry
Keith (Jamie Denton), as boring as they come, who insists on a big,
formal wedding.  That means Molly's parents have to be invited but
when they get together they always fight and that will  play havoc with
the wedding Molly warns Keith.  And that is the setup for THAT OLD
FEELING.</P>
