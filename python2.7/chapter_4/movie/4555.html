<PRE>                                  THE KINGDOM
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     This is what would happen if you let David Lynch loose on the set of
"ER" with nothing but a TV camera, a gaggle of Danish actors, and a bone
saw.  THE KINGDOM, an extremely ambitious effort for both the filmmakers
and the audience, is Denmark's hipper-than-thou answer to "Twin Peaks."</P>
<P>     I'm not even going to attempt to explain the plot of THE KINGDOM, as
it could fill several pages and still not make a lick of sense.  I'll
leave it at this:  "The Kingdom" is a giant Copenhagen hospital, and every
single room in it (and most of the corridors, and the driveway, and the
parking lot) contains at least one complete wacko.</P>
<P>     The dearth of information about this "film" belies its true
beginnings as a serialized TV show in Denmark.  The movie version of THE
KINGDOM is nothing more than the first 4 episodes (of a planned 13) from
this television show slapped back to back, converted to film, and played
in all its grainy glory on the big screen.  (Note!  This means it's *5
hours* long.  Really.)  In fact, watching THE KINGDOM is a very TV-like
experience.  The only things missing are the commercials and a ringing
telephone.  Of course, I'm not one to watch 5 hours of TV in one sitting. 
I left after Episode 2, as it's pretty clear where the "movie" is going
and that there's not going to be a "big finish" after Episode 4.</P>
<P>     This is not to say that THE KINGDOM isn't worth watching.  Rather,
you *have* to know what you're getting into.  Here's some of what you
get:  a child's ghost living in an elevator shaft, patients holding a
seance in their room, bizarre cults of doctors akin to the Masons, an
intern who decapitates a corpse to impress his love, a phantom
ambulance...and that's just Episode 1.  What you don't get is this:  much
background music, a discernibly strong plotline, a camera in focus,
character motivations, or just about anything else you typically expect to
find in the world of film.  In other words, THE KINGDOM is all but
destined to become a phenomenal cult hit.</P>
<P>     Occasionally, THE KINGDOM overcomes its meandering flaws and
completely shocks the audience with some truly powerful scenes.  However,
most of the time, the movie is just plain weird, and it defies description
in any other way.  If your butt can handle 5 hours in a movie theater and
this sounds like your cup of tea, don't miss it.  Otherwise, wait for
video...and get the 3-day rental.  You'll need it.</P>
<PRE>     In Danish and Swedish with subtitles.</PRE>
