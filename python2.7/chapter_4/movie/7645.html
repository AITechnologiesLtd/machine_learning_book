<PRE>                                  UNFORGETTABLE
                       A film review by Paul-Michael Agapow
                        Copyright 1997 Paul-Michael Agapow</PRE>
<P>David Krane (Liotta) is a police medical examiner, accused of the
murder of his wife.  Although acquitted, the memory continues to
haunt him as he wonders why his wife was killed.  One day at a
crime scene he uncovers signs that his wife's killer is in the
area.  Serendipitously, he later attends a talk by researcher
Briggs (Fiorentino), who has managed to transfer memories between
rats ...</P>
<P>Another John Dahl and Linda Fiorentino film? After the
masterful and assured noir of "The Last Seduction", such an
effort would have to be (to use a tired phrase) compulsory
viewing.  But "Unforgettable" crept into the cinemas and slunk
away a few weeks later to mediocre reviews.  This is less than it
deserves - while it has its problems, it has a lot of good things
to offer too.</P>
<P>The SFnal device that drives "Unforgettable" is patently
absurd, especially to anyone who has done any amount of
neurophysiology.  The memory transfer procedure involves
intravenous injection of the cerebrospinal fluid of the "donor",
coupled with a cocktail of random drugs (the names seemingly
lifted from a first-year physiology textbook).  But the manner
and implication of the process is handled with some verve and
imagination.  The transfer emphasises vivid, shocking memories
and requires exposure to a cue for the original memory - such as
the scene of a murder, the face of someone involved.  The
memories are not simple knowledge but a re-experience, complete
with the original trauma and fear.  As Krane tries to unlock his
wife's murder, he accumulates a head of memories that clash and
merge unpredictably, his body suffering from the side-effects of
the transfer procedure and the accumulated psychic shock.</P>
<P>This intriguing setup is let down to some extent by the
plotting and acting.  Although Dahl has competently used
coincidence and cliche in the past (as in the absurd but
delightful "Red Rock West"), the strain shows as "Unforgettable"
winds down every 30 minutes before being kickstarted to life by a
fresh flurry of machinations and improbabilities.  As the climax
arrives, it also begins to lose its originality and confidence.
A mark of this is when the identity of Krane's mysterious nemesis
is questioned.  Anyone who has seen a film in the last ten years
will instantly finger the two unnecessary characters as
candidates, only leaving the question of whether it is the
blatantly obvious one or the equally blatant unobvious one.  It
is no mark of quality that both seem probable.</P>
<P>Peter Coyote turns in a good if minor performance as a glum
cop friend.  Liotta, never a great actor, does a good turn as the
slowly disintegrating and obsessed Krane.  As for Linda
Fiorentino ...</P>
<PRE>   Dear Ms. Fiorentino,</PRE>
<PRE>           I realise there are problems with being typecast, 
        especially for females in the Hollywood system.  Nonetheless, 
        your portrayal of a mousy repressed scientist is abysmal.  
        Please return to playing evil-sex-bitch-queens from hell.</PRE>
<PRE>   Thanking you etcetera, hugs,</PRE>
<PRE>   PA</PRE>
<P>Despite these faults, "Unforgettable" is a good film even if
it is more a competent mystery than it is the clever treatise
that it might be.  [***/interesting] and Woody Allen films on the
Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
