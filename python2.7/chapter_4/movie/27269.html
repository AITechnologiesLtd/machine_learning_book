<P>_Dungeons_&_Dragons_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)</P>
<P>Director Courtney Solomon spent the better part of ten years trying to
make his boyhood obsession, the perennially popular role playing game
Dungeons & Dragons, into a feature film, but none of the passion that
fact would entail ends up on screen.  What does show up all too clearly
in _Dungeons_&_Dragons_ is rookie helmer Solomon's lack of experience in
film, let alone with a project of such large, effects-laden scale.  D&D
enthusiasts have been clamoring for a film adaptation since the game came
on the scene 26 years ago, and while I am not a player myself, I am
certain that this sloppy slice of schlock is hardly what the fandom had
in mind.</P>
<P>The setting is a mythical medieval empire, and the 17-year-old Empress
Savina's (Thora Birch) goal of removing the class division between the
magic-practicing Mages and everyone else runs into a snag when the evil
wizard Profion (Jeremy Irons) turns her government advisors against her. 
Exactly how, I don't know.  But it's not so much control over the kingdom
that Profion wants than a magical rod--one that will bring red dragons
under his command.  The Empress possesses a rod that gives her power over
green dragons.  If this makes any sense to you, let me know, because it's
all an incoherent jumble to me.</P>
<P>In any event, a trio of plucky young people proves to be Profion and
henchman Damodar's (Bruce Payne) biggest obstacle in locating the coveted
rod.  They are fledgling young Mage Marina (Zoe McLellan) and the
thievery team of Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans).  True
to their larcenous roots, Ridley and Snails jump into the do-good biz in
hopes of pocketing a large reward, but, of course, the heroic instincts
within ultimately purify their intentions.</P>
<P>Given that the source material is a game, a weak plot is just about
expected (what isn't is just how inscrutable it also is, but that's
another issue entirely), for the emphasis should be on action set pieces.
 As I mentioned, I was never a D&D player, but I do know that navigation
through booby-trapped mazes and dungeons is a big part of the game (one
of the more exciting elements, from what I remember from friends who
played back in junior high).  So it would only follow that _D&D_ the
movie would be packed with such set pieces.  Alas, there's only one, and
a mighty underwhelming one at that, featuring unimaginative traps and
zero tension.  Filling in the rest of the requisite action beats in the
script credited to Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright are half-hearted
swordfights often punctuated with some very chintzy magic effects.</P>
<P>Which leads me to the other half of the title, the dragons.  The final
act certainly has their fair share of them, green and red, all flying
around and battling dragon and human alike.  Never mind that their sudden
arrival in the story is barely (if even that) explained; these creatures
are CGI creations that look every bit like digital FX work.  To top it
off, all the CG work, from the dragons to various animated backdrops to
simple magic dust, is not-so-seamlessly integrated into the live action. 
The only flourish that slightly convinces is a fairly simple ripple
effect used to depict teleportation holes.</P>
<P>Not only is Solomon obviously not able to pull off the technical aspects
of this project, he's also clueless with his cast.  Whalin and McLellan
are embarrassingly amateurish, the latter especially so, with her
invariably stilted line readings.  The insulting role of the buffoonish,
wisecracking African-American sidekick (we all know what ultimately lies
in store for this type of character) brings out the worst broad instincts
in Wayans.  Birch seems embalmed, her Amidala-lite costumes apparently
constricting her throat so that she speaks in a constant monotone.  Worst
of all, however, is the Oscar winner of the lot, Irons; Solomon
apparently thought that since he's such a reputable thespian, Irons
should not simply be given free rein, but no reins at all.  What a
horrendous mistake that turns out to be, for Irons is just one small step
short of foaming at the mouth in every single scene.</P>
<P>The big mistake, however, is making _Dungeons_&_Dragons_ in the first
place.  The reason why video game movies have all failed is that the
element of interactivity that made them so special to begin with is lost.
 Of course, the same idea holds true for a role playing game movie, but
there's an even larger miscalculation at play: the sights and scenarios
imagined during the course of playing such a game will always be more
vivid and exciting than those an FX crew could cook up--especially the
type of low-rent crew that can only be afforded by a neophyte director
with no formal training working with independently-raised overseas money.</P>
