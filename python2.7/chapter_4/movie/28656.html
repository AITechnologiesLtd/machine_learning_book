Reviewed by Dustin Putman, July 6, 2001.</P>
<P>Chris Nahon's Jet Li vehicle, "Kiss of the Dragon," makes the cardinal sin of 
trying to persuade the viewer that it is more that it actually is. Setting 
aside time to attempt character development and a deep emotional core, the 
film, instead, flounders in desperately overwrought dialogue and one of the 
most incomprehensible plots since 2000's "Battlefield Earth."</P>
<P>Jet Li stars as Liu Jiuan, a Beijing cop who has traveled to Paris to aid in 
a police raid against a heroin smuggler. When the head of Paris' police 
department, Richard (Tcheky Karyo), ends up murdering the suspect, as well as 
a prostitute, in a hotel room and setting Liu up as the murderer, it is up to 
Liu to escape suspicions and seek revenge on the crooked cops behind the 
operation. Giving Liu an added reason to go after them, Liu meets Jessica 
(Bridget Fonda), a mother-turned-drug-addict/hooker whose daughter is being 
held hostage by Richard.</P>
<P>The motives behind what Richard, the archenemy, does throughout is both 
muddled and never explained. For instance, why is he trying to frame Liu for 
murder when he has just met him? And why does Richard insist that Jessica 
must remain a prostitute or have her young daughter be killed? Furthermore, 
why was Liu sought out in Paris from Beijing for a simple drug bust? Action 
movies, especially those that work as an exciting thrill-ride, do not always 
require stringent logic, but "Kiss of the Dragon" is so flawed on the story 
level that it can't be taken seriously for even one moment. </P>
<P>As for the vital action and martial arts sequences, the best that can be said 
about them is that they are well-choreographed, and often very violent and 
bloody. Their innovation level is close to nil, however, and seldom exciting. 
The thought of the very small Liu taking on a whole room full of martial arts 
students, leaving all of them pounded to the floor but without a scratch on 
himself, is ridiculous even for this genre of film.</P>
<P>Jet Li (2000's "Romeo Must Die") is adequate as the wronged Liu, but his 
English isn't very good, and this bars him from being able to express his 
character's feelings clearly. As a woman who simply wants her daughter back, 
but has found herself stuck in a grimy life of prostitution and needles 
shoved through her veins, Bridget Fonda (1999's "Lake Placid") is so much 
better than this movie. It's actually a bit disheartening seeing the usually 
very bright Fonda stuck in an unattractive role that has her saying the most 
godawful dialogue this side of a cheesy '80s slasher flick. Rounding out the 
three main players, Tcheky Karyo (2000's "The Patriot") grunts and narrows 
his eyes on cue as the incumbently vicious Richard.</P>
<P>Ineptly directed by newcomer Chris Nahon and written by the usually reliable 
Luc Besson (1994's "The Professional") and Robert Mark Kamen, "Kiss of the 
Dragon" may pass as a minor divergence for hard-core action fans, but 
everyone else should stay away. With a script that is a mess of cliches and 
bad drama, and not one scene that has the ability to get your heart racing, 
you have been officially warned.</P>
