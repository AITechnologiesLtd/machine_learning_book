<P>"Whatever It Takes" is the exact antithesis of "Here on Earth," this week's 
other teen-oriented movie. Whereas "Here on Earth" must be praised for its 
non-stereotypical view of teenage characters, "Whatever It Takes," directed 
by David Raynr, is a cliche-ridden high school comedy with few inventive 
ideas, but a fair amount of wit. Sort of a hybrid of "She's All That" and 
"Drive Me Crazy," and superior to the former, the film predictably follows 
two good-natured protagonists and their self-involved romantic counterparts, 
until the moment when...well...I think we both know how this one will end, 
folks. Because the ground rules for this genre have been so stringently laid 
out, its the "getting-there" that is more important than the actual payoff, 
and "Whatever It Takes," while certainly not one of the better teen comedies, 
is at least one of the more entertaining recent ones.</P>
<P>Ryan Woodman (Shane West) is an unpopular senior at Gilmore High School, with 
a long-time best friend and next-door neighbor in Maggie Carter (Marla 
Sokoloff), whose bedroom balconies conveniently face each other, so they can 
spend their free time talking between them. Maggie is seemingly nothing more 
than a sister to him, as he has eyes for the most popular (and superficial) 
girl in school, Ashley Grant (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), even though she doesn't know 
he even exists. When jock Chris (James Franco) decides that he would like to 
have a chance with Maggie, he devises a plan with Ryan. Since Ashley is 
Chris' cousin, he will easily be able to get her to go out with Ryan, if Ryan 
helps him to win over Maggie. Pretty soon, it becomes apparent to Ryan that 
Ashley is nothing more than a shallow individual worried only about herself, 
and he slowly comes to the realization that his true feelings lie with 
Maggie. It sounds complicated, but it's really not; just another spin on the 
same old formula.</P>
<P>"Whatever It Takes," loosely based on "Cyrano de Bergerac," is a flawed movie 
in more ways than one, and it makes you long for the '80s John Hughes era, 
when teen movies like "Sixteen Candles," "Pretty in Pink," and "Some Kind of 
Wonderful" laid the groundwork for such '90s fare as this, but were done with 
a great deal more intelligence and overall heart. So why does "Whatever It 
Takes" fundamentally work? Easy. Going into a movie theater playing this 
film, you have it set in your mind exactly what is going to happen and how 
everything will be played out, and because it satisfies those expectations 
and doesn't resort to complete brainlessness, you come out happy. If you 
don't, then you really had no excuse for walking into the theater in the 
first place.</P>
<P>Shane West (TV's "Once and Again") and Marla Sokoloff (TV's "The Practice") 
are charming and likable as Ryan and Maggie. Their roles, like everyone 
else's, is a cliche, but they do their jobs professionally, and seem to be 
having fun in the process. </P>
<P>The standout in the cast, however, turns out to be Jodi Lyn O'Keefe (1998's 
"Halloween: H20"), who is basically playing the same stuck-up character that 
she did in 1999's "She's All That," but with a fresh spin. About as 
self-absorbed as a person can possibly be, O'Keefe's Ashley is won over by 
Ryan not by flattery, but by criticisms, as any negativity directed towards 
her attracts her attention, since she is such an obviously insecure and 
pathetic creature. It might have been nice had screenwriter Mark Schwahn 
attempted to tear down Ashley's thin facade and explore her as a real human 
being (as John Hughes did spectacularly with Lea Thompson's popular sexpot 
character in 1987's "Some Kind of Wonderful"), but at least she isn't 
purposefully cruel--only highly materialistic.</P>
<P>"Whatever It Takes" is light, fluffy, fast-paced, and through the sludge of 
overdone ideas are a couple original moments, particularly in the Prom 
finale, whose theme for the year is "Titanic Dreams." With the gymnasium set 
up to look like the Titanic, complete with fake icebergs and lifesavers, a 
plot development occurs that immediately turns the dance into a basic 
reenactment of the tragic sinking of the title ship. But who are we kidding? 
The movie is little more than a remake of countless other films, done 
occasionally better but often worse. The play's the thing, however, and 
"Whatever It Takes" is entertaining throughout the duration of its brisk 92 
minutes.</P>
