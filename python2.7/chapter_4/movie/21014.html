<P>Playing By Heart is ensemble romance at it's best. The story cuts
between numerous love stories; some surprising, some touching, and all
thoroughly engaging. The entire cast is in top form, as they all submit
memorable performances that each account for a significant piece of this
irresistible puzzle.</P>
<P>It's a real surprise to see how well director Willard Carroll juggles so
many sub-plots with entertaining ease. A large portion of the screen
time is dedicated to Paul (Sean Connery) and Hannah (Gena Rowlands), a
wealthy couple who have been together for 40 years, but have recently
been experiencing problems evoked by unpleasant memories. Secondly,
there is play director Meredith (Gillian Anderson), who is hesitant to
enter a relationship because of various reasons. She bumps into a
friendly architect (Jon Stewart) after she is crushed by a falling
bookcase, and the complications ensue from there. Then, there is the
story of Joan (Angelina Jolie) a young, street-wise girl who bumps into
the seemingly shy and reserved Keenan (Ryan Phillippe) at a night club.
The final romance centers around Gracie (Madeleine Stowe) and Roger
(Anthony Edwards), two lost souls looking for some escape from their
regular spouses.</P>
<P>But, not everything in Playing By Heart revolves around a love story. We
also follow Hugh (Dennis Quaid) through various social activities which
seem to prove he's a pathological liar. There is also the story of a man
dying from AIDS complications (Jay Mohr), and his supportive mother
(Ellen Burstyn) standing by his hospital bed. It is interesting in the
end when we find out that some of these stories are linked in some way
or another. But, we're so caught up in how every relationship develops
that we just accept everything in stride.</P>
<P>While every sub-plot has a few fundamental flaws, all are worthy of
sharing equal screen time. The romance that I found the most interesting
was the one shared by Jolie and Phillippe. The two are talented young
actors, and while they are handed the most challenging subject matter in
the movie, both handle it with a capable maturity. Connery and Rowlands
have the most amusing confrontations - brought on by her regrets of the
past and his tendency to blurt out a movie's entire plot and ruin any
surprises. All of the actors are marvelous. Connery (as always) manages
to captivate the viewer with every piece of dialogue, Anderson is highly
convincing even at such a stretch from her X-Files character, and Mohr
brings a tragic dilemma to believable life.</P>
<P>If there is one stand-out in the cast, however, it's Angelina Jolie.
Father Jon Voight appears to have passed down his acting talents,
because Jolie is a gifted and highly competent performer in every
detail. It's amazing how well the actress can make us feel for her
character, and even of other actors in the same scene. But, as I say,
everyone does a respectable job - especially with the limited screen
time they're given to prove themselves.</P>
<P>Playing By Heart moves swiftly, rarely stopping to examine the
relationships from a different perspective. This is a very good thing.
Any hopeless romantics are sure to be caught up in the antics from
minute one, but everyone should appreciate the all-star cast juggling
the brisk and enjoyable material. The script and dialogue are light as a
feather, but Carroll knows how to stage a scene to the most appealing
effect.</P>
<P>This is definitely a group effort if there ever was one. I am certainly
no sucker for romance (I have been known to object to a movie in which
nothing gets blown up), but Playing By Heart is a treat. For anyone
looking for a light, fluffy little way to spend a few hours, this
charmingly entertaining comedy will hit the spot. It certainly did for
me...and nothing even got blown up.</P>
