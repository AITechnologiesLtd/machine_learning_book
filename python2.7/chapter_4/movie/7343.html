<P>Joe Pesci won the Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor in 1990 for his no
holds barred portrayal of a mobster with a sense of humour in 'Goodfellas'.
 Pesci's other film credits such as 'Home Alone' (1990), 'Home Alone 2: Lost
in New York' (1992), 'JFK' (1991), 'Lethal Weapon 2' (1989), 'Lethal Weapon
3' (1992) and as far back as 'Raging Bull' (1980) distinguish him as a unique
and inventive actor.  '8 Heads in a Duffel Bag' is a deliciously wacked-out
and ingenious dark comedy complete with all of Pesci's trademark wiseguy
antics.  </P>
<P>Pesci plays a New Jersey mobster whose job requires him to deliver the heads
of eight men murdered by the organization he works for to a crime boss in San
Diego.  Pesci transports them in a duffel bag aboard a commercial airline and
encounters a medical student (Andy Comeau in a very impressive film debut) on
his spring break who has an identical bag.  Naturally, the bags get switched
at luggage pick up in San Diego and the rest you can figure out for yourself.
 Comeau meets his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) at the airport and she
introduces him to her parents (George Hamilton and Dyan Cannon) and the four
of them leave for a vacation in Mexico.</P>
<P>Your enjoyment of '8 Heads in a Duffel Bag' will depend on how strong your
tolerance to black comedy is as the film leaves no stone unturned in its
pursuit of laughs and delivers on many levels.  There are plot holes in the
script by writer/director Tom Schulman (Oscar winner for Best Original
Screenplay in 1989 for 'Dead Poet's Society') but they are covered up by good
pacing and a frenzied climax.  The film borders on extreme silliness from
time to time but contains all the right tempo and build up to a satisfying
and hilarious conclusion.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, Pesci, as good as he is, takes a back seat in this film as
Comeau is the film's protagonist and David Spade from SNL and the two
disasters 'Tommy Boy' and 'Black Sheep' and who stars as Comeau's college
room mate who gets caught up in the insane antics of this story, provides
some great one liners.  Spade steals the show from Pesci in many scenes.  One
classic scene is worth the price of admission alone as Pesci has a nightmare
about the heads doing a little musical number.  Is '8 Heads in a Duffel Bag'
bizarre?  Of course.  Original?  Definitely.  Worth seeing?  Yes but don't
blink or this film may cause you laughing pains you won't be able to get rid
of anytime soon.  </P>
