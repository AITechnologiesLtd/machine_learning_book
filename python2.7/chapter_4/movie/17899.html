<P>   Whoever said that opposites attract should get out more
often.  Take a gander at couples and you'll see, not
surprisingly, that many look as though they could be twins. 
We tend to be attracted to mirror-images of ourselves, which
gives rise to the trendy psychological thought that affection
for others is little more than self-love, once removed.  Yet
films--like literature and theater--like to portray the dramatic
and not the mundane; conflict and its resolution rather than
flatness.  We need not wonder that writers and those who
adapt their formulations for the screen will seize upon the
unusual.  Hence, Bernard Bertolucci's interest in the allure of
people for their antipodes.  In "Besieged," the great Italian
seizes upon a story of two people who could not be more
different, a couple whose physical closeness leads almost
inevitably to an emotional bond.  Bertolucci, best known for
the opulence he handled in "The Last Emperor" and the
display of howling rebelliousness by Marlon Brando's
character in "Last Tango in Paris" does an about face with
"Besieged," as he believes that film-makers should not repeat
themselves but should regularly break new ground.</P>
<P>   Filming mostly in Rome but occasionally in a ramshackle
village in Kenya, the Parma-born Bertolucci appears in
essence to go back to the roots of cinema, to the age of the
silents when gestures were more important than words,
visuals taking precedence over utterances.  He employs the
universal abstract art of music to bring two utterly diverse
people together, using MTV techniques such as jump-cutting
and step-framing to manipulate time, now slowing down the
drama, now accelerating the action.  While James Lasdun's
story of two unusual people is presumably entrancing, two
gifted actors bring the printed page to remarkable life: David
Thewlis, best known for his off-the-wall role in "Naked," and
newcomer Thandie Newton, whose portrayal as the title figure
in last year's "Beloved" was mesmerizing.</P>
<P>   The story opens in a fictional African state.  Winston, the
husband of Shandurai (Thandie Newton), is arrested by a
team of soldiers and placed in a military prison without a trial
date.  Shandurai, disgusted with the regime, flees to Rome
(she somehow can speak and understand her African
language, Itallan and English) where she enrolls in medical
school and works as a housemaid to a English pianist and
composer, Mr. Kinsky (David Thewlis).  Kinsky lives in an
elaborate villa which he had inherited from his wealthy aunt. 
The two are opposites in both culture and temperament.  He
is reclusive and friendless, burying himself in the playing of
Grieg, Beethoven, Bach and Mozart, while Shandurai, an
intensely emotional soul with more facial expressions than a
Kathakali dancer, loses herself to the African rhythms of her
native country which she hears on her radio.  They rarely
talk, Kinski settling for stealing glances at his maid while she
casts furtive peeks at her employer.  Mutual silence makes
their few outbursts particularly melodramatic.  In one agitated
scene, Kinsky blurts out his love for Shandurai coupled with
his willingness to do anything for her (he does), while in
another Shandurai shouts, "I don't understand your music!"
as though the great composers of the West emerged from
The Twilight Zone.  Ultimately music becomes their shared
tongue as the composer visits an immigrants' church to take
in the chants of African choral music and later blends African
rhythms into his own inventions.  </P>
<P>   Avoiding the dull, straightforward narrative style, Bertolucci
exploits the hand-held camera to do apply some quirky cuts
to his movie. Given Thandie Newton's intensely photogenic
features, the creative edits convey her moods to us as readily
as if we were clairvoyants literally reading her mind.  Newton
is a stunning performer who bestows cameraman Fabio
Cianchetti with an unobstructed window to her emotions. 
Though we have to suspend disbelief to accept her character
as a medical student running through the rigors of that
training in a language not her own, we accept the bond that
has been formed between these two disparate individuals. 
This is the ultimate majesty of Bertolucci's latest creation.</P>
