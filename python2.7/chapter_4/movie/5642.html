<PRE>                       EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1996 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" is Gus Van Sant's vision of
Tom Robbins' counterculture classic. Set to a terrific score by
k.d. lang and Ben Mink, the director and some good performers
labor mightily to capture Robbins' freewheeling version of the
70s. The problem lies right there. It happens sometimes that a
writer can catch the essence of a time in a way that forbids
further tinkering. You have only to listen to Robbins' words on
the soundtrack to know that what is unfolding on the screen can't
catch what he saw. Credit Uma Thurman as Sissy Hankshaw, the
all-thumbs symbolic hitchhiker, Rain Phoenix as Bonanza
Jellybean, her lover, and John Heard for his energy as "The
Countess." And, two decades later, a salute to Robbins for
creating The Rubber Rose Ranch and peopling it with characters of
its time who defy the camera. </P>
