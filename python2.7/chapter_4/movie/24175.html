<PRE>IN SHORT: Wow. Flat out wow.</PRE>
<P>Have you ever had one of those moviegoing experiences where your eyes
were so fixated on the screen that your hand went down into the popcorn
.. . . and stayed there? That you called all of your friends afterwards
and told them "YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!" and when they asked "Why?," you
had to answer</P>
<PRE>"I can't tell you."</PRE>
<PRE>If not, you are about to.</PRE>
<P>This is not a question of not giving away the ending, like last year's
Sixth Sense. This is a story (screenplay by Toby Emmerich) that is so
well written, with details so intricately woven into the entire piece
that some idiot reviewer somewhere will feel compelled to lay out every
detail and wreck the experience for you.</P>
<P>Not me. You get the bare bones, like the skeleton found out behind an
abandoned diner in Queens, New York. Through flat out sheer luck, NYPD
Detective John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) gets a match on an old dental
record, showing that this girl was reported missing in 1968. The M.O. of
the killer makes her the first victim of the notorious Nightingale
Killer who terrorized the Big Apple and killed three nurses in 1969, the
year the Mets worked a miracle out at Shea Stadium.</P>
<P>In 1969, Firefighter Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) is loving husband to
wife Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell) and only son, 6 year old Johnny (Daniel
Henson). At night, Frank likes to ride the airwaves of the world with
his Heathkit Ham Radio. There's a lot to talk about on the night of
October 10, for an aurora borealis has lit up the night sky with
brilliant colors that had never before been seen as far south as Bayside
Queens. That night, Frank reached parts of the world he had never talked
to. That night, he stumbled upon another Ham radio operator somewhere in
Queens, named John.</P>
<P>In 24 hours, Frank Sullivan will be killed in a fire . . . unless John
can convince him that, for reasons unknown, they are not talking across
distance. They are talking across time. If John can save his father's
life, his world will be inalterably changed. He doesn't realize that
until it happens and everything he's known for thirty years goes down
the tubes.</P>
<P>Which is all I'll tell you about the first, knockdown, get on line
immediately blockbuster to be movie of the year 2000. Except that Andre
Braugher plays an integral part as a detective whose career spans the
decades and whose path crosses both Sullivans many, many times.</P>
<P>And all the while Cranky sat in the screening room with a blank piece of
paper in front of him and the cap sitting on top of his pen. Not a note
was taken. Frequency is the kind of flick where you can't, no, you won't
take your eye off the screen. It's the kind of flick that falls into the
science fantasy genre and fits so perfectly with tales of time travel
(H.G. Wells started the genre a century ago) and parallel universes (and
no one messed with continuity more than DC Comics did in its Crisis on
Infinite Earths a decade or so ago)</P>
<P>We walked into Frequency without our SF heads screwed on, and ignoring
the press notes that explain all the intricacies and theories about the
space-time continuum and all that stuff. We did have out continuity caps
on, looking for script errors and discrepancies and the story moved back
and forth over the thirty year time period -- and didn't see any. And
while the little scriptwriter in the back of our brain was contemplating
a satisfying ending, by the time it hit, it hit like the proverbial
trainwreck. Frequency is an absolute smackdown. A flat out perfect,
mesmerizing thriller, from the director of Primal Fear (and the teevee
pilot of NYPD Blue, after a run exec producing Hill Street Blues and LA
Law).</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Frequency, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$8.00</PRE>
<P>See it twice. Not because it's confusing or because it's so complicated
that you'll miss something. See it twice, 'cuz you'll want to. You will.</P>
