<PRE>                               DEATH AND THE MAIDEN
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Directed by Roman Polanski
Starring- Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, and Stuart Wilson
Based on the play by Ariel Dorfman</P>
<P>     The title immediately alerts one that they are possibly in for a
heavy handed modern allegorical polemic, with an actor standing each
for each of the title characters.  Actually there are three
characters.  The characters are a victim, a judge, and an accused
fascist; all stranded in an isolated cabin.  The setting is an Unnamed
South American Country.  The subject at hand is the aftermath of
totalitarianism.  It sounds like Sartre's "No Exit" or Jean Genet's
"The Balcony," existential dramas that were brilliant nearly half a
century ago, but old hat to anybody who has read a book recently.</P>
<P>     And it probably would be except for the fact that it is directed
by Roman Polanski.  All of Polanski's best films deal with a small
group of characters trapped together, with one character trapped even
further, trapped in their own mind.  KNIFE IN THE WATER and BITTER MOON
trap the people on boats; REPULSION,  THE TENANT and ROSEMARY'S BABY
trap people in their urban apartments.  CUL DE SAC, and his new film
DEATH AND THE MAIDEN, trap people in the false complacency of suburban
life.</P>
<P>     Nobody but Polanski could create so much tension in the throw away
opening scene.  Sigourney Weaver is preparing dinner, but in a tank top
and boxer shorts.  The audience is put in an uncomfortable voyeuristic
position, wanting to leave and wanting to watch.  We have collectively
intruded on a private moment, and continue intruding.  Something subtle
about the camera movement makes this different from other opening
scenes.  Her unawareness of our watching makes it almost as if we were
stalking her in her own home.  Just as this gets to be a little creepy,
the radio announces that hearings by the new government will look into
the death squad killings of a previous regime.  Sigourney Weaver
listens with particular interest, and a storm knocks out the
electricity and the phone.</P>
<P>     Here is where the casting is truly perfect.  One might expect the
actress in the darkened isolated house to succumb to any number of weak
female cliches, but all the audience knows that Sigourney Weaver, in
similar attire, single handedly defeated the Alien on several
occasions.  Whatever the deposed dictatorship can put up against her is
going to be in for quite a fight.</P>
<P>     What turns up in the middle of the storm is Ben Kingsley, best
known as Ghandi.  In our minds a saintly man, Kingsley denies that he
was in the country at all during the death-squad era.  Torture victim
Weaver has a different opinion.  Subconsciously one still roots for
their previous characters.  We hope Weaver destroys the Alien, and
Kingsley rises above repression.  One of the most claustrophobic and
tense ninety minutes of cinema follows.  Nobody but Polanski could use
the simple tricks that create the emotional roller-coaster ride and
have it not seem corny.  The storm knocking out the power routine was
old when movies first learned to talk.  The film is so riveting that
one forgets how much of a cliche it is.</P>
<P>     The dimly lit naturalistic set and particularly grainy film lend a
home-movie reality to the story.  It is a sense of reality that works
well.  The horror film cliche set-up gives way to the horror of
Twentieth Century life: tortures and disappearances, followed by
cover-ups and silence.</P>
<P>     The play is full of purple prose, and the inevitable 'what makes
us different from them?' speeches.  Polanski races past all of that
quickly.  Much more time is spent on dribbling out the details of what
supposedly happened fifteen years ago, and what Weaver intends to do
about it now.  As Weaver reveals details of her torture, we are again
put in the uncomfortable position of eavesdropper.  Our listening
intrudes on her innermost privacy, and forces us to identify, uneasily,
with Kingsley, the accused arch-intruder of her life.</P>
<P>     While much attention paid to details throughout the tense dimly
lit cabin scenes, the few studio made exterior scenes are very crude.
Less than sophisticated matte shots unconvincingly place the characters
outside the cabin.  While perhaps unintentional, it does frame these
more pointed scenes as staged existentialism, separate from the drama
of the cabin.  Even the scenes on the porch, with the
forced-perspective prop lighthouse blinking in the "distance," seem
distinctly removed from the real life horror of the interior
situation.  The subtle staginess diffuses the awkward unnaturalness of
some of the Ariel Dorfman's more political dialogue.</P>
<P>     A couple of years Polanski turned down Speilberg's invitation to
direct SCHINDLER'S LIST.  He felt the subject matter, which intersected
with his own life, was too personal for him to direct.  This film deals
with the same fascist themes on a microcosmic scale.  DEATH AND THE
MAIDEN is the work of a world class film maker at the peak of his
form.  With two top notch films in one year, at least according to the
US distribution dates, this marks a major comeback.</P>
