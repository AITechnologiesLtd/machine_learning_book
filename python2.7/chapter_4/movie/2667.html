<P>     Kevin Costner is fast becoming Hollywood's "three-plus hour"
actor.  This is his third film in the nineties to reach or exceed the
one-hundred eighty minute mark (the other two being DANCES WITH WOLVES
and JFK).  Not many movies these days have close to that sort of
running time, and WYATT EARP shows why.  Although epic in length and
scope, it is not epic in depth and, upon occasion, that can make this a
tedious experience.</P>
<P>     WYATT EARP has a brief opening scene in 1881 Tombstone, then
backtracks seventeen years to a midwestern cornfield where a young
Wyatt is considering running away from home to join his older brothers
in the Union army.  From there, the film follows the experiences of the
most famous member of the Earp clan through thirty-five years of his
life.  His tragic marriage to Urilla is chronicled, as are his
experiences as a lawman (and sometimes vigilante) in Dodge City and
Tombstone.  WYATT EARP ends off the coast of turn-of-the-century Alaska
with a vignette about how historical figures become legends.</P>
<P>     The historical accuracy of Lawrence Kasdan's film isn't much of an
issue, at least as far as I'm concerned.  The writer/director
intertwines fact with myth to create what is, for the most part, a
reasonably entertaining story, and freely admits a certain degree of
"fictionalization" where his characters and situations are concerned.</P>
<P>     At times, WYATT EARP seems to drag on forever.  There's a lot of
apparently unnecessary padding that might have looked good on the
scripted page, but doesn't come across nearly as well on the big
screen.  The first hour rambles, presenting disjointed scenes that fail
to add much depth to any of the characters.  Wyatt's courting of and
marriage to Urilla (Annabeth Gish) happens so quickly that it fails to
provoke much emotional reaction.</P>
<P>     For the early portions of the movie, Wyatt is not an especially
interesting person.  First, he's a noble, upstanding man who loves his
wife, can't stand the sight of death, and is as honest as they come.
Then, following the first great tragedy of his life, he turns into a
drunken lout who steals horses and beats up people.  Only after
establishing Wyatt's "good" and "evil" sides in this obvious and time-
consuming manner does Kasdan allow the two to merge into the more
complex and interesting character who arrives to clean up Dodge City.</P>
<P>     Tombstone is rightfully at the center of WYATT EARP, and it isn't
surprising that it's the most interesting segment of the film.  The
buildup to the gunfight at the OK Corral is intense and energetic, and
the execution isn't a letdown.  Subsequent events are handled with
equal flair and, although the ending is muddled, there's a wonderfully
tense and atmospheric sequence involving a nighttime shoot-out around a
stopped train.</P>
<P>     Following an impressive performance in A PERFECT WORLD, Kevin
Costner is back to merely "adequate."  Most of the time, Costner's
attempts to present Wyatt's icy demeanor make the character flat and
uninteresting.  Some of the dumb dialogue doesn't help, but he's not
the only actor saddled with occasionally-stilted lines.</P>
<P>     As Wyatt's father Nicholas, Gene Hackman doesn't have much screen
time, and he appears to be on hand mostly to pick up a paycheck - this
is easily the actor's least-inspired performance in years.  Dennis
Quaid delivers a delightful turn as Doc Holliday.  This incarnation of
the consumption-stricken dentist mixes a sly, self-deprecating wit with
a cold, calculated viciousness.</P>
<P>     Most of the other cast members are fine in their roles.  There are
certainly a number of well-known faces (Bill Pullman, Isabella
Rossellini, Mare Winningham, and Mark Harmon all make appearances), but
few standouts.</P>
<P>     WYATT EARP is visually impressive, but that's no big surprise.
Any western, and certainly any would-be epic, has to boast a good
cinematographer (in this case, it's Owen Roizman).  The musical score
is marginally less effective.  Although composer James Newton Howard
seemingly attempts to recapture the mood of DANCES WITH WOLVES, THE
LAST OF THE MOHICANS, and GETTYSBURG, his themes aren't as memorable.</P>
<P>     Because of its recent release, TOMBSTONE comparisons are
inevitable.  The biggest advantage the late-1993 film has over this one
is length (TOMBSTONE clocks in at 2:08), but that's about it.  WYATT
EARP's script is less confusing, the characters are better developed,
and the acting is a notch higher.  Despite his two-note performance,
Costner is more believable as the title character than Kurt Russell,
and Quaid's version of Doc Holliday is more chilling than Val
Kilmer's.  Joanna Going manages to bring a certain sparkle to Josie
Marcus that is missing from Dana Delaney's interpretation.</P>
<P>     In much the same way that CHAPLIN overextends itself by trying to
present a complete picture of the actor's life, WYATT EARP's attempts
to cover so many years lead to too many scenes with little emotional
power.  The film doesn't shoot blanks, and it is better than TOMBSTONE
but, considering the names involved, a little disappointment isn't out
of the question.</P>
