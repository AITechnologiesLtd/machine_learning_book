<P>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) enjoys all the outward trappings of
middle-class success in the aptly but ironically titled film "American
Beauty": a beautiful wife named Carolyn (Annette Bening) with her own
real-estate business and a teenage daughter with no obvious flaws. But
his life is joyless. His sole pleasure seems to be masturbating in the
shower each morning, an act that he keeps secret from his wife with
whom he no longer has sexual relations.</P>
<P>Their life is filled with empty rituals. They sit in a well-appointed
dining room each evening trading insults over their meal, while the
strains of schmaltzy arrangements of Rogers and Hammerstein show tunes
are heard on the stereo in utter contrast to the acrimony at the
table. Sexual tension would explain most of the bickering between
husband and wife. Their daughter Jane (Thora Burch) has no use for
either of them as well, but holds her father in greater contempt for
his remoteness. When he makes clumsy attempts to bond with her, she
recoils in disgust.</P>
<P>A series of events will soon destroy any illusions that they had in
normal family life. Lester has a meeting with a personnel manager
whose task it is to figure out what people are contributing to the
media corporation that employs them. Everybody, including Lester, is
supposed to turn in a one page summary of what their job
responsibilities consist of--presumably those whose summaries seem
superfluous to the operation of the corporation will become
superfluous themselves. A spark of rebellion prompts Lester to tell
the manager that this is just a thinly disguised downsizing plot. This
initial meeting leads to mounting confrontations with the corporate
world that sustains him and his empty lifestyle.</P>
<P>Later that week the Burnhams go to see their daughter perform in an
absurdly choreographed cheerleader dance number during half-time at a
high-school basketball game. He fixates on Angela (Mena Suvari), the
sexually precocious best friend of his daughter, who picks up on his
interest later that evening in the parking lot of the high school.
>From that point on she finds excuses to drop by the Burnham household
where she knows that Lester will leer at her. Their sexual flirtations
disgust his daughter.</P>
<P>His wife is oblivious to all this. Her only interest in life is
selling real estate. In one of the most powerful scenes in the film,
she is depicted feverishly cleaning a house early in the morning to
make it attractive to prospective buyers. Her entire day is then spent
with customers telling her that the house is unattractive. At the end
of the day, with the house unsold, she collapses in tears. Selling
houses is the only pleasure she gets out of life, an act analogous to
her husband's masturbation.</P>
<P>Into their tortured lives enters a young man, who offers Lester
liberation from boredom and oppression. Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) is a
compulsive video photographer whom daughter Carolyn regards as a
voyeur after catching him in the act of filming her late one night.
Her father sees another side of Ricky. His other avocation besides
video is smoking and selling high-powered marijuana out of the bedroom
of his house. Lester soon becomes one of his best customers. Smoking
marijuana combines with the realization that the corporate world does
not matter to him anymore. What really matters is wooing his
daughter's libidinous classmate and living the lifestyle he enjoyed as
a 21 year old. He begins listening to Jimi Hendrix in his garage as he
pumps iron after Angela has told him that he needs to work out a
little. When he is not lifting weights, he is smoking expensive pot.</P>
<P>"American Beauty" is best at describing the futility of American
middle-class life. It is understandably weak in presenting a
believable alternative, since there is none within the confines of the
capitalist system. Poor Earl and Carolyn are driven to find salvation
within the system--her on the system's own terms and he within an
"alternative" lifestyle that owes more to a Levi's commercial than
anything else. Screenwriter Alan Ball's rebels are a middle-aged man
who lapses into late adolescence and an adolescent drug dealer who
operates within the fringes of consumerist society. What is marijuana,
after all, than the ultimate commodity. When he is showing Lester his
wares, he makes a sales pitch for genetically modified weed that uses
top secret government biotechnology and sells for $2000 an ounce.</P>
<P>"American Beauty", whatever its flaws, is worth seeing as a snapshot
of American society at a peculiar juncture in its unfolding as an
empire. In the final years of the second term of the Clinton
administration, which by some standards has produced more material
success than has been enjoyed in many years, Hollywood is turning out
films that curse the system that produced it.</P>
