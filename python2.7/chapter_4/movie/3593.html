<PRE>                         DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Dylan McDermott, Nancy Travis, James LeGros, Jim Belushi,
           Quentin Tarantino.
Screenplay:  Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone.
Director:  Jack Baran.</P>
<P>     Adventurous young screenwriters and filmmakers often have to
walk a very fine line between originality and approachability.
Those seeking financing from sources like The Sundance Institute are
trying to win people over with a creative spirit, but a different
aesthetic is frequently required if the film is lucky enough to make
it into the marketplace.  DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO has already
been branded with the financially toxic label of "cult film," and it
is true that its tone bears more than a passing resemblance to films
like REPO MAN and WILD AT HEART.  But there's more than that to
DESTINY.  Although it is wild and quirky, occasionally to excess, it
is also surprisingly entertaining and grounded in real emotion by an
exceptional performance from Nancy Travis.</P>
<P>     Dylan McDermott stars as Julian Goddard, a bank robber just
escaped from prison after three years.  He is picked up along the
road by an odd fellow named Johnny Destiny (Quentin Tarantino), and
the two men head for Las Vegas.  There Julian hopes to be reunited
both with his partner-in-crime Harry Thoreau (James LeGros), who
should have his half of the bank haul, and with his girlfriend
Lucille (Nancy Travis).  Unfortunately, Lucille has since hooked up
with casino boss Tuerto (Jim Belushi), and the money was stolen from
Thoreau on the night of the robbery ... as it turns out, by Johnny
Destiny.  As Julian attempts to win back Lucille's heart and Thoreau
prepares for another meeting with Destiny, they all discover that
there are some things you just can't plan for in Las Vegas, "a town
of limitless possibilities."</P>
<P>     It would be foolish to suggest that the first thing one would
notice about DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO would be anything but it's
rather off-center characteristics.  A motel with rooms named after
Marilyn Monroe films, a shared dream which results in a pregnancy
and an electrified swimming pool which acts as a gateway to another
reality are not exactly the stuff of your average multiplex picture.
There are occasions when those elements come perilously close to
overkill, or indeed topple into overkill, but they are rare.  The
main reason screenwriters Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone and
director Jack Baran succeed is that most of the strangeness comes
from the characters, and they are well-developed and well-performed
almost to a one.  Dylan McDermott and James LeGros play off each
other well as the two thieves, each with his own ideas about the
strange events of the story, and Jim Belushi is both comic and
menacing as the big shot with a penchant for grabbing is crotch.
The smaller roles are full of winners as well:  Barry Henley and
Richard Edson as two cops in terrible sport coats; Tracey Walter as
Julian's reclusive father; Bobcat Goldthwait as an undercover cop;
especially David Cross as a hyperkinetic talent agent.  Only Quentin
Tarantino, who should be declared legally charisma-impaired, bombs
in his role.  That's a problem, because Johnny Destiny requires
_presence_, not just attitude.</P>
<P>     Though DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO could have been little more
than a loose conglomeration of strange scenes, the film is held
together by the location.  Las Vegas becomes a kind of character in
the film, a real-life mirage of false hopes.  One character (the
comically named recording executive Vinnie Vidivici) describes the
city as "smelling of formaldehyde," and that feeling is part of the
story.  Vegas is where dreams and careers go to die, where doomed
marriages are born, and where chance turns everyone into a loser
eventually.</P>
<P>     It is Nancy Travis who drives that theme home.  For all
practical purposes, DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO really revolves
around Lucille, a casino singer stuck in the place where nobody gets
"discovered."  When Julian and her one big chance at fame turn up on
the same day, Lucille faces some tough choices between her dreams of
happiness and her pragmatism.  It is an intriguing character,
wonderfully played by an actress who has been stuck too often in
minor roles in bad films like GREEDY.  And it's a shame that too
many viewers won't see her performance because of the strange story
surrounding her.  DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO is aimed at those with
a taste for the surreal, but it also has a very real heart which
makes it more than the sum of its parts.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 destinies:  7.</PRE>
