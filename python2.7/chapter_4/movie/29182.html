                            THE OTHERS 
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper 
    CAPSULE: This is a ghost story with surprises, atmosphere, 
    and authentic gooseflesh.  Nicole Kidman stars as an 
    over-protective, neurotic mother in a house that must be 
    kept dark to protect the children.  The Channel Islands 
    make for a perfect dismal setting for a suspenseful 
    well-written ghost story.  The film was written, directed, 
    and even scored by Chilean-born Alejandro Amenabar. 
    Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4).  This review written 
    with intent avoiding spoilers; in general it is recommended 
    that the viewer avoid reading too much about the film before 
    seeing it. </PRE>
<P>It is difficult to think of something new to do with a ghost 
story.  Just creating atmosphere is really not enough.  Once the 
ghosts start throwing things around and doing physical damage, as 
they did in POLTERGEIST, a ghost story no longer is a ghost story 
as much as it is a monster movie.  On the other hand just leaving 
around clues that something from beyond is around, maybe the 
sound of a woman crying or bloody footprints on the carpet, very 
quickly becomes tiresome.  Even some of the best ghost stories 
diversify.  They function as a ghost story and something else. 
Frequently it is a ghost story and a simple murder mystery as was 
done with THE UNINVITED, THE CHANGELING, and THE LADY IN WHITE. 
WHAT LIES BENEATH was a ghost story that turned into a murder 
mystery that turned into a stalker movie.  (And none of them was 
very good.)  Some of the best just mix character portraits with 
ghost story.  THE INNOCENTS and the original THE HAUNTING do 
that nicely.  Into the latter category comes THE OTHERS.  This is 
a very good ghost story with some very tricky things going on. 
Watching it I think I must have come up with about eight 
different theories to explain what I was seeing.  In the end I 
gave myself about one-third credit for having solved part of the 
puzzle. </P>
<P>It is late 1945 and Grace (played by Nicole Kidman) lives on one 
of the Channel Islands that the Germans occupied during the war 
that so recently ended.  On this island good weather is just a 
thick gray cloud cover, but sometimes the fog is so thick it 
seeps into the house and seemingly into Grace's soul.  Grace 
lives in a brooding mansion with her two children, both allergic 
to light.   The Germans cut off the electricity and, partially 
for the sake of the children, Grace never restored it. </P>
<P>To protect the children from light, Grace has very strict rules 
about keeping all but very faint light out of rooms.  This is a 
house that has befriended the darkness and shuns the light. 
These inflexible rules have to be explained in detail to the 
newly arrived hired help.  The old hired help just disappeared 
one day not long ago.  Adding to the mystery is that one of the 
children has been hearing a crying boy at night.  That is just 
the set-up for this story written as well as directed and 
musically scored by Alejandro Amenabar.  And the story he has 
created is tightly written.  Amenabar leaves a lot of details to 
be explained in this puzzle of a script and every mystery is 
explained by the denouement. </P>
<P>This is a film that in large part is built around the Kidman 
performance.  From the beginning she plays it as an authoritarian 
with many idiosyncratic rules of how to run her house.  Meanwhile 
she traumatizes her children with her matter-of-fact, hellfire- 
and-brimstone religious interpretations.  Amenabar has her made 
up to look very much the way Alfred Hitchcock would have made up 
Grace Kelly, whom she even seems to resemble in this film. </P>
<P>This is a film sculpted from darkness.  Interior shots are nearly 
almost always half-dark, obscuring part of the picture.  The 
lighting frequently gives the effect of being solely from 
candles.   Exteriors are little brighter with figures receding 
into the thick fog.  The visuals and the story line remain half- 
hidden and enigmatic to the viewer.  The characters are uniformly 
dressed in dark colors or in black. </P>
<P>THE OTHERS is a stylistically well-controlled and effective ghost 
story.  It relies on mood rather than special effects and 
succeeds admirably.  I rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 
on the -4 to +4 scale. </P>
