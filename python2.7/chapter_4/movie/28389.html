<P>   "Vengo" is a tale of death, despair, drunkenness, murder
and revenge in the province of Seville in southern Spain.  If I
had not been to the region of Andalucia--one of the many
homes of the world's gypsies for hundreds of years--four
times already, I'd have been inspired enough by this movie to
be on the next evening's Iberia flight.  Why?  Because I like to
be surrounded by death, despair, drunkenness, murder and
revenge?  Not quite.  What provides the inspiration for this
movie, even its motif, is not the plot and not even the
characters, but the music.  Yep.  Some stories are plot driven,
some character driven: this is music driven.  And my oh my
oh my, what music!  Do you like flamenco?  And have you
seen flamenco singers and dancers only in touristic spots like
the Meson Flamenco in Madrid rather than in the roadside
taverns in Andalucian towns like Moron de la frontera and
Utrera and in Daniel Pohren's famed finca espartera?  Then
you're in for a special treat because watching "Vengo" is like
seeing a story that takes place in Rio, except that instead of
worrying about the plot and characters, the filmmaker takes
you to the Carnival.</P>
<P>   But I won't get carried away.  The movie is not perfect for
the very reasons mentioned: its music is just about
everything; it's story is as melodramatic and contrived as
director Tony Gatlif's 1998 French-Romanian production
"Gadjo Dilo--about a young Frenchman hoping to track down
a folk singer who is "adopted" by a village of gypsies.  In
short, "Vengo" is not just a product placement for southern
Spain's most exciting region of Andalucia but a nationalistic
cri de coeur for the culture of the gypsies.  The tight-family
structure, however, is the cause for sadness as well, because
the people who inhabit Mr. Gatlif's film (mostly
nonprofessional actors but some quite professional-sounding
singers, dancers and instrumentalists) are committed to seek
personal, family vengeance--forget about going to the courts--
for spilled blood.  </P>
<P>    The viewer who attends a screening of "Vengo" cold,
knowing nothing about the movie, will wonder what the heck
is going on, because straight away we're in the company of
some passionate looking and fervent people from North Africa
who appear to be performing spontaneously before a crowd
of people standing by, not necessarily paying to hear a
concert.  We're eased into the story which centers on
handsome Caco (Antonio Canales) who is the leader of his
gypsy clan.  His brother has for reasons unknown killed a
member of the derisive Caravacas clan (who grow their hair
even longer than do the members of his own group), and is
hiding out somewhere in Morocco to avoid the obligatory
vengeance of the Caravacas.  Caco has more problems.  His
own daughter has died.  He visits the young woman's shrine
daily and spends the rest of his time drinking and partying in
an attempt to forget her, and what's more he displaces his
love for his daughter onto his brother's mentally challenged
son, Diego (Orestes Villasan Rodriguez).  He sure loves this
unfortunate young man, and Diego loves his uncle.  When
Caco hears from the grapevine that the scuzzy Caravacas
folks, unable to locate the murderer, will settle for killing
Diego, Caco becomes even more despondent.  Thankfully for
the audience, instead of showing his despair by crying, he
parties all the more, and we're treated to more Flamenco! 
Guitars, beautiful women singing their hearts out and dancing
up a storm, and a bevy of soldiers and citizens clapping their
hands in the required convention of palmas fill the
Cinemascope screen lensed by Thierry Pouget, who casts all
of the Andalucian scenes with an appropriate sepia tint.</P>
<P>   Take the melodrama in stride (pretend this is an opera, the
kind of thing that would be pure soap were it not for the
glorious music), and you'll dig "Vengo."</P>
<P>Not Rated.  Running time: 90 minutes.  (C)2001,
