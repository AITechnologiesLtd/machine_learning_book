<PRE>                               NIGHT ON EARTH
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Five cab rides in five major cities all
     happening at the same time and none really go anywhere.  This
     film is mostly about personality and talk, but you won't
     remember any of the cab rides any more than your last real
     cab ride.  This is Jim Jarmusch's most commercial film to
     date, but it is still not greatly recommendable.  Rating: 0
     (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Jim Jarmusch's films are an acquired taste.  In some ways they are just
too realistic to be really enthralling.  Particularly in his first film,
STRANGER THAN PARADISE, his characters always think for five or ten seconds
before speaking a single sentence.  This made listening to the conversations
just a bit frustrating, which I suppose was the point.  After his DOWN BY
LAW, his most recent film was MYSTERY TRAIN, three interconnected stories
taking place the same day and night in Memphis, Tennessee.</P>
<P>     NIGHT ON EARTH is five stories involving taxi cab rides taking place at
the same instant.  The stories are less connected than those of MYSTERY
TRAIN.  Each takes place in a different city: Los Angeles, New York, Paris,
Rome, and Helsinki.</P>
<P>     In Los Angeles, a rather butch tomboy cab driver (played by Winona
Ryder) drives a casting agent (played by Gena Rowlands).  Each is
discouraged by the way things are going on her job and the other may be able
to help.  In New York, a black man (played by Giancarlo Esposito) hails a
cab and finds his driver (played by Armin Mueller-Stahl), a recent East
German emigre', knows nothing about New York or driving a cab.  Esposito's
frustration gives way to friendship as the German is pulled into his life,
but then the German ends up worse than when he started.  In Paris, a black
cab driver (played by Isaach De Bakole') first is the butt of racist remarks
from two drunk black passengers.  He throws them out of his cab and picks up
instead a blind woman who is non-discriminatory--she has a nasty attitude
toward everyone.</P>
<P>     Rome is the site of the fourth story where a  very funny and inventive
cab driver (played by Roberto Begnini) confesses his sins hilariously to a
priest in his cab.  It may or may not be a joke, but it has serious
consequences.  The final sequence takes place in Helsinki.  This time the
driver is played by Matti Pellonpaa (who played the manager in the worth-
looking-for LENINGRAD COWBOYS GO AMERICA).  He picks up three drunk
passengers who tell him a sad story that he matches with one of his own.</P>
<P>     Any of these segments might add needed texture to somebody's film about
a cab driver but it overall is a film that had the viewer asking at the end
of each segment, "Yeah?  So?"  Perhaps the idea, like in MY DINNER WITH
ANDRE, is just to let you hear the conversation, but since the characters
are so contrived there is little feel that these are real conversations.
And lulls in the conversation tend only to stretch out a film already too
long for many audiences.</P>
<P>     NIGHT ON EARTH is a just-okay entry in Jarmusch's filmography.  I give
it a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.  It is intriguing to compare Jarmusch's films
to LENINGRAD COWBOYS GO AMERICA.  Aki Kaurismaki recognizably borrows from
Jarmusch's style, an observation I made before I had realized that Jarmusch
also acts in THE LENINGRAD COWBOYS GO AMERICA.  So the two directors have
some cross-fertilization.  Yet of the two, Kaurismaki seems the better
director.  Kaurismaki totally avoids the "so what?" response that so often
comes with Jarmusch's work.</P>
