<P>"First ten minutes, you made up in your mind who we were"</P>
<P>Starring Usher Raymond, Forest Whitaker, Rosario Dawson, Robert
Ri'chard, Fredro Starr, Vanessa L. Williams.  Rated R.</P>
<P>Oh how good it is, after being bombarded with redundant media coverage
of high school shootings and the prevailing violence in teenage
society, to see a mainstream film present a situation where teens that
resort to foul play aren't evil ciphers who go off the deep end for no
apparent reason. By no means does Light it Up glorify violence but it
doesn't jump to obvious conclusions about teens that are driven to it.
The characters here are not insane. They're not pushed off the edge by
violent TV shows. They're simply fed up and their reaction is more than
understandable.</P>
<P>The movie is set at a poor, inner-city high school and earns points
immediately by placing it in Queens, thereby offsetting the Harlem
stereotype. A full-time police officer has just been permanently placed
at Lincoln High to keep the peace. This is Officer Jackson (Forest
Whitaker), `a five dollar cop with a fifty dollar attitude.'  One day
he roughs up a kid for blocking the traffic in the hallway, which leads
to a wrestling match where the cop is shot in the leg with his own gun
and the gun goes flying to the floor. The kid grabs the gun and before
he knows it, he and a group of friends have taken the cop hostage.</P>
<P>There's Lester (R&B singer Usher Raymond), an intelligent, troubled boy
who is also the man with the gun and thus the ringleader; Stephanie,
who is really smart and has plans to become a doctor; Lynn, who has
just found out she is pregnant and Rodney, the obligatory homeboy.
They constantly fight over what to do next but whatever Lester says,
goes: he does, after all, have the gun.</P>
<P>Police surround the building. A kindly hostage negotiator (Vanessa L.
Williams) is called in. The students make a list of demands, consisting
mainly of getting their broken window fixed, their just-fired favorite
teacher rehired, textbooks for everyone, etc, etc. But the main thing
they want is respect. It can't be anything but painful to have no say
in the matter when your school is going to pieces right before your
eyes. It must be difficult to watch your future be compromised because
authority figures are performing their job inadequately. I believe
Light it Up when it says that this can get to the point where students
have no choice but to take matters into their own hands. The film
doesn't glorify this; rather, it presents it in an unbiased light.</P>
<P>This is a movie for teens, but then again it's not. It speaks to teens
intelligently, without condescending or trying to please. In that
sense, it's for them. But on the other hand, it may be a little too
intelligent: not enough action to interest those looking for excitement
and explosions and not enough romance to attract those of the female
persuasion. In that sense it's not. Be that as it may, this is not a
film that adults should be wary to see; just because it is about teens
does not mean it is exclusively for them and that is certainly not the
case here.</P>
<P>Light it Up deftly handles issues ambitious inner city kids may be
facing today, those who are actually troubled about the poor quality of
their schools. In our society, it is a contradiction when a child is
raised in a cruel, violent society and yet wants to learn. This movie
shows us how that contradiction can create an urge in teens to resort
to violence so that they can learn. It's a sad reality, but also one
that makes perfect sense given the circumstances.</P>
<P>Usher Raymond, a singer by trade, has a real screen presence. His
performance is intense and surprisingly powerful; like Ice Cube, Will
Smith, L.L. Cool J, and Vanessa Williams (who, of course, is in this as
well) here is another musician with the potential for a major crossover
into the movie industry. The amiable Williams is the only big star
here, making her a sort of backbone: even if a viewer hates everything
else in the movie, a good performance from a familiar face can go a
long way. She handles it well.</P>
<P>Though it has the tendency to rely too much on character stereotypes,
Light it Up is no formula movie. It's not a high school flick. Nor does
it exploit the recent tragedies that have occurred in the country. It
is a real film.</P>
