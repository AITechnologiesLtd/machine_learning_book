<P>"Veni, vidi, vici" said Julius Caesar, "I came, I saw, I conquered." 
Re The Wedding Planner, I came, I saw, I was monumentally bored.after 
he first reel. In the latter, Mary (Lopez) is the powerhouse top 
handler in a chic firm of wedding consultants in San Francisco. The 
early sequences are amusing. She runs a wedding with the modern, 
technological efficiently of a three-star general. Self-assured and 
fully aware of her value to the firm, she is gunning for a 
partnership. The scenes are fast-moving and fast-talking, like a 
throwback to classic screwball comedies such as Twentieth Century, 
Bringing Up Baby or His Girl Friday.</P>
<P>But her private life, while minutely organized, is empty. Then, while 
planning the highly profitable wedding of heiress Fran, in a forced 
development a street accident causes Meeting Cute with pediatrician 
Steve (McConaughey). In a mega-coincidence  of the kind that give  a 
bad name to movies, romance raises its head as soon after Steve turns 
out to be is the fiancé of client Fran.</P>
<P>An unlikely quid pro quo is reinforced by shovelfuls of artificiality 
in plot, cardboard characters, relationships, antagonisms, 
side-events ... Another thread has Mary's father Salvatore  (Alex 
Rocco), surprise her with the arrival from Italy of Massimo (Justin 
Chambers) a childhood playmate. As absurdities escalate, Massimo 
wants to marry Mary. His role is useless, gratuitous and plain 
stupid. His Italian as well as his Italian-accented English are 
atrociously false, as are daddy Salvatore's.</P>
<P>Shots, scenes and sequences pile up in a gauche, unintegrated script. 
The movie is like a cut-up cadaver that they are trying to make whole 
with stitches. There is no forward movement, no impetus, no suspense, 
no guessing in all this flab. You can see everything coming from Day 
Two as the "developments" increase to Himalayan heights of dumbness.</P>
<P>In the finale, the Lopez character and the pediatrician will be the 
new couple. Predictable. But it makes no sense that she blames 
herself for having been a control freak. She was simply doing her 
job.  All this is nap-inducing with the force of five Tylenol-Plus.</P>
<P>There's an embarrassment of choices in attributing film guilt to the 
makers. A first-time director whose trade is choreography; a novice 
writer and her inexperienced collaborator; a regiment of producers, 
executive producers and co-producers; a plethora of companies ( the 
credits read: A Sony Pictures release of a Columbia Pictures and 
Interme presentation of a Tapestry Films/Dee Gee Entertainment/IMF 
production in association with Prufrock Pictures.) Too many cooks?</P>
<P>The screening of this feature was preceded by three unpromising 
previews. The Wedding Planner confirmed that after the mostly awful 
summer 2000 movies, and after their subsequent replacement by some 
good films year-end items (the usual pre-Oscar race), bad movies are 
back to reinforce the dismal norms of Hollywood.</P>
<P>By coincidence, a couple of hours after seeing The Wedding Planner, I 
caught on cable Gregory Nava's 1997 biopic "Selena," with Jennifer 
Lopez in the title role. It is about the Tejano singer who was 
murdered in 1995, at age 23, just as she was becoming a household 
name. It is just a good movie --but it  feels even better when 
compared to The Wedding Planner.</P>
<P>A trivial note: Fran is played by the former Bridgette Wilson who 
married tennis player Sampras and now goes under the hyphenated name 
Wildon-Sampras.</P>
<P>A non-trivial note: for her role Lopez was paid 9 million dollars.</P>
