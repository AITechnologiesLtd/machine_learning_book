<P>Someone must have thought this was a good idea: Take half a dozen inner
city kidlets, have one of 'em accidentally shoot a cop and then hold
said wounded Officer hostage while they make demands for better school
conditions and bond as human beings.</P>
<P>I guess if you come from a place where your mindset is that the police
are the enemy, regardless of guilt or innocence or accident or
deliberate intention, then this thing will make sense to you. Cranky
doesn't come from that place.</P>
<P>The High School is in Queens, New York. The area holds a full run of
races and the school itself is far beyond habitable. No heat. Broken
windows in the middle of winter. No new textbooks. A veritable
educational hell on earth. When the one teacher who gives a damn (Judd
Nelson) is pushed to the limit he takes his class off campus, to a warm
diner, 'cuz every other habitable extra-curricular area in the school is
already full. This action, thanks to a plot device we won't tell, gets
the man suspended. The students stage a protest in the principal's
office (Glenn Turman as the stressed out principal, more concerned with
appearance and his forthcoming pension) and when the on campus cop is
called in to break the protest up an incomprehensible set of
circumstances leads one of the kids to shoot the cop (Forest Whitaker).</P>
<P>What makes the circumstances incomprehensible is properly explained down
the line. What makes it impossible for me to be sympathetic, even to
suspend any kind of belief system for 90 minutes, is that in a hall full
of witnesses, an accidental shooting is just that. That five of the six
kidlets can look at a wounded cop and decided that he isn't hurt so bad
is beyond me. The decision to hold the cop hostage so that the kidlets
can make demands for improvements in the school might make sense if you
can buy into the thought processes, but I can't.</P>
<P>The six kidlets: a sports star (Usher Raymond), a hustler (Clifton
Collins Jr.), a gangsta (Fredro Starr), a artist (Robert Ri'Chard), a
smart girl on the Student Council (Rosario Dawson), and a pregnant white
kid with attitude (Sara Gilbert). Vanessa L. Williams plays the
negotiator who is, ultimately, helpless and the film moves towards the
inevitable.</P>
<P>Those that survive get happy endings. Those of us who sat through a
preview of Light It Up stared at the screen wondering how the hell we
were going to write this thing up without sounding racist. From an
analytical point of view, writer/ director Craig Bolotin follows the
path it sets out for itself. Some of the dialog is awful. All of the
characters fill some sort of stereotype.</P>
<P>The idea that our society has reached a point where this kind of story
idea is possible makes me want to scream. You can argue that Light It Up
brings up issues. I'll argue back that it promotes an absolutely
despicable treatment of human beings.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Light It up, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$2.00</PRE>
<PRE>Midweek rental. See it if you must.</PRE>
