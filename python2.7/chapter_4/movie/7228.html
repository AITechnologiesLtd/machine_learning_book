<PRE>                             BROADCAST NEWS
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Politics, talent, attitude and perseverance can be crucial factors when
pursuing a career in the media.  In a business loaded with constant
restructuring, downsizing and often a push towards flash over substance, the
factors listed above along with ethics and some perky romantic escapades are
examined in James L. Brooks' 'Broadcast News'.  Brooks, the man responsible
for creating several successful television series ('Taxi' etc.) made a
successful transition to the big screen as a talented filmmaker who won three
Oscars in one night for 'Terms of Endearment' as that film's producer,
director and screenwriter based on Larry McMurtry's novel.  That was 1983 and
it would take Brooks four years to follow-up that film with 'Broadcast News'.
 I myself have worked in the media and having worked in the field himself,
Brooks was right on target in his depiction of three characters (William
Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks) and their different personalities
leading to their eventual destinies in the workplace.  Their destinies in the
field of romantic endeavour also come into play and 'Broadcast News' has a
most generous and satisfying conclusion.  </P>
<P>Set in Washington, D.C., Hunter plays a producer for a major network while
Brooks is the enormously talented but under appreciated news reporter
constantly by her side who has the film's best lines.  Enter a future
anchorman (William Hurt) who knows almost nothing about the business of news
or understanding its impact and clarity but manges to land on his feet
because of what his employers feel is his attractive face.  Enraged by the
network's choice of flash over substance, Hunter turns sour at the thought of
having to work with him. Their is a constant rivalry between Hurt and Brooks
as Brooks despises everything Hurt is about and isn't shy about showing his
true feelings.</P>
<P>At a party for station employees at the home of one of the network's
wealthier participants, a call is made informing them that a major story has
broken overseas involving an attack on a U.S. military base in Sicily by the
Libyans and everyone races to get to the station and go on-air for live
breaking news.  It's one of the film's best scenes as Hunter is given the job
of executive producer for the segment and Brooks is shunned from any coverage
of the assignment at all and from home he phones in to Hunter his knowledge
of Libya and U.S. military aircraft and she relays it through the microphone
connected to Hurt's earpiece and he immediately relays it to the viewing
audience.  While he's watching television those immortal words are spoken by
Brooks "I say it here, it comes out there."</P>
<P>Towards the film's climax, which is the downsizing and frustration of the
employees affected, 'Broadcast News' reaches into the personal lives of its
characters and contains some of Brooks' best work as a director.  'Broadcast
News' in many ways was better than 'Terms of Endearment' for its use of
personal relationships done more cleanly than the soap opera atmosphere of
'Terms of Endearment.'  On its tenth anniversary and in the aftermath of the
media circus of both O.J. Simpson trials and the current Oklahoma City trial,
'Broadcast News' shows you what the evening nightly news doesn't
always......and that's detail !</P>
