<PRE>                               MICHAEL COLLINS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Neil Jordan writes and directs a dark
          epic film with heavy parallels to the current
          Middle East. Liam Neeson stars as a terrorist and a
          founder of the IRA, who later tried to bring peace
          to his country in the late 1910s and early 1920s.
          Jordan borrows bits from LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and THE
          GODFATHER to create a magnetic epic film.  Rating:
          high +2 (-4 to +4)  Warning: there are spoilers
          present, though none that could not be found in a
          decent encyclopedia article on Collins.</PRE>
<P>     Most political struggles have their romantic heroes and with a
people as naturally poetic or as argumentative as the Irish, it is not
surprising that the fight for independence spawned a great romantic, if
controversial, hero.  The great hero of the Irish struggle in this
century was Michael Collins.  And who better to play him than Liam
Neeson, the Charleton Heston of the 1990s.  Having played larger-than-
life historical figures Oskar Schindler and Rob Roy, the Irish actor
was an obvious choice to play Michael Collins, at least if audiences
were willing to accept the forty-four-year-old Neeson playing a man who
died at thirty-one.</P>
<P>     The film--in good epic film style told in flashback just after the
main character's death--begins with Collins in the 1916 Easter Rising
of the Irish against British rule.  He escapes immediate arrest only to
be arrested later and receive a short term in prison.  Many of those
rebelling are executed, but Eamon de Valera, a major leader of the
resistance (played by Alan Rickman), is given a lighter sentence of a
term in prison. This is probably because of his multi-national
background, having a Spanish father and being born in America.  Collins
begins setting about the sort of activities that will get him back in
prison.  His public speeches for independence win him an ally in the
British police force, Ned Broy (Stephen Rea).  At least by this
account, Collins was impressed by the efficiency and efficacy of
British Intelligence and sets about the task of modeling the new Irish
Republican Army on it.  Collins manages to break de Valera from prison,
but de Valera is clearly envious of Collins's new-found power and the
relationship between the two is strained. With the intelligence Collins
is able to collect about his enemy he is able to outdo the British in
the effectiveness of his attacks.  He invents the sort of tactics that
have become the trademark of the IRA.  For two years he maintains an
urban guerrilla war against the British.  This creates a conflict with
de Valera in which the latter wants more traditional warfare, Collins
prefers his new terrorism.  His struggle ends in the Truce of 1921 and
de Valera sends Collins to England to negotiate for the Irish.  Collins
realizes that the British will make only limited concessions.  He
brings back a compromise treaty that allows for an Irish free state but
partitions Ireland and requires an oath of allegiance to the British
monarch.  The free state is declared and almost immediately breaks into
civil war with Collins defending the treaty and de Valera now on the
side of terrorist war against the British and against a treaty that is
dividing the country both politically and quite literally.</P>
<P>     There is not much in the style of MICHAEL COLLINS but the
combination of old elements.  Through the war against the British the
film draws heavily on the style of THE GODFATHER, particularly with
back- and-forth cutting between some tension-producing scene of
impending violence, to one more placid.  This gives the effect of a
much longer and more drawn-out tense scene.  Another scene at a
football match reminds one very much a similar scene in GANDHI.  Where
the film borrows, it seems to do it well in most instances.  There is
one James Bond-ish escape involving a seemingly nearly impossible
athletic feat done in complete silence.  Here Jordan, who wrote the
script as well as directing, seriously damages the credibility of his
story which elsewhere is reasonably well maintained.  Other places his
taste is considerably better.  He has a love triangle that could have
been a time-wasting plot cliche.  He leaves it in for historical
accuracy, but he wisely downplays before it can become a distraction.
MICHAEL COLLINS is photographed by Chris Menges who won Oscars for his
work on THE KILLING FIELDS (1984) and THE MISSION (1986).  He creates a
surprising amount of atmosphere with what he does not show.  He
frequently has smoke or fog in the frame.  Often part of the frame is
obscured by darkness or shadow.  At least for me some of the dialogue
was similarly obscured by the thick Irish accents.  While Menges's
images dominate the film, Elliot Goldenthal's score stays modestly in
background coloring the film subtly but rarely getting noticed.</P>
<P>     Liam Neeson is a big man and plays Collins as a big man, somewhat
larger than the people around him.  He sweeps into a scene with that
large bulk of his and commands it.  The one serious problem with the
casting is that he never seems as young as Collins needs to be, a good
fifteen years younger through much of the film.  Aiden Quinn as friend
and fellow revolutionary Harry Boland cuts a much less imposing figure.
Julia Roberts is by no means the center of the show here and her acting
appropriately is not either.  She can smile and look appealing and even
can master an Irish accent, but she makes little contribution to the
film that a lessor-known actress could not have done, and very likely
better.  Alan Rickman needs a good director to keep him from chewing
the scenery and he seems to have found a good director in Jordan.  His
acting is neat and precise.  His de Valera seems to be thinking out
each sentence and then delivering with the incisiveness of a scalpel.
One may not like what he is saying, but it seems certain that it is
precisely what de Valera means.</P>
<P>     It is hard to judge the historical accuracy of MICHAEL COLLINS,
since even the Irish are not sure of Collins's role in the fight for
Independence.  There are no obvious contradictions with anything I have
found written about Collins's role in history, though it is relatively
safe for a filmmaker to fill in some of the blanks about a man of
mystery.  It has been suggested that De Valera is shown a bit worse
than the historical figure, but much of this is within the range of
reasonable interpretation and opinion.  And speaking of opinion, mine
of this film is that it rates a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
