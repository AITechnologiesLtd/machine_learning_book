<PRE>Psycho
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) There are three reasons why Universal might have withheld
screenings of PSYCHO from critics. Either 1) they knew it was a stinker,
2) they wanted to keep secret a new shocking twist, or 3) they were
merely paying homage to Hitchcock.</P>
<P>Thankfully, it wasn't the first reason. Though some hard-core fans of
the original may scoff at anything that tries to compete, Van Sant's
version of Psycho is actually pretty good.</P>
<P>It wasn't reason two, either. There was some speculation, especially in
Roger Ebert's Answer Man column, that perhaps the secrecy was meant to
disguise a new twist on Hitchcock's original. In fact, this version is a
very close remake of the original.</P>
<P>That leaves reason three. It appears that Van Sant and Universal were
actually trying to pay tribute not only to one of the all-time great
directors, but to one of his most memorable films. When the original
PSYCHO was released in 1960, Hitchcock and Universal withheld press
screenings to keep the audiences guessing. Van Sant is merely imitating
the master.</P>
<P>For the uninitiated, PSYCHO follows the story of Marion Crane, a
secretary in a real estate office. The opportunity to walk away with
$400,000 presents itself, and she takes it. She drives for several days,
trying to get far enough away to shake her pursuers. Late one night, in
a rainstorm, she decides to stop for the night at the Bates Motel. The
rest is history.</P>
<P>If you know your history, then I don't need to repeat it for you. If you
don't know your history, then it's better you find out for yourself. I
would recommend either version to you. I won't say this version is
better; it's not. But I acknowledge that some people have no desire to
rent a black and white movie for their 15-inch monaural TV. Given a
big-screen with big sound, this version may be the better way to get up
to speed on your cultural awareness.</P>
<P>This film isn't literally a shot-by-shot remake as some have claimed,
but it is very close. In fact, this kind of near-literal remake has
never been tried before. It was a fairly big gamble, especially
considering the possible backlash from die-hard fans. </P>
<P>Nevertheless, it seems to have worked. The horrible and tense sequences
are recreated faithfully, resulting in a still-satisfying experience.</P>
<P>Trivia buffs could spend hours at the theaters comparing differences and
similarities (see "Did You Notice" on the sidebar at
<A HREF="http://net.indra.com/~mmapes/psy_ld98.htm">http://net.indra.com/~mmapes/psy_ld98.htm</A> for a handful of
examples). Yet some differences were unavoidable. Casting, set design,
costume design, and sound all had to be redone. Mostly, these decisions
were well made.</P>
<P>Vince Vaughn fills the role of Norman Bates. Others in the audience were
disappointed by this casting choice, but I was pleasantly surprised.
Vaughn had the right speech and mannerisms to fill the part. He was
meek, childish, and awkward in all the right proportions. Others faulted
him for having too much confidence for the role, and they do have a
point, but on the whole, Vaughn was great.</P>
<P>The only casting decision that I found to be a bad choice was William H.
Macy as the private investigator Arobgast. Macy's iconic face and tidy
haircut were perfect in PLEASANTVILLE, where he played a 50's sitcom
father figure. But because he is such an obvious choice for an
old-fashioned gumshoe, he stood out like a sore thumb. Everyone else
seemed modern in a world gone retro, but Macy seemed to actually come
from that era.</P>
<P>The set design and costume design were unavoidably modernized, but they
still had the look and feel of 1960. The real estate office looked
remarkably similar to the cheap set Hitchcock used in the original. The
hardware store was a far cry from today's big-box chains, and in fact it
looked a little out of place after seeing a new car dealership. Dresses
are loud and orange. Shirts are noisy and brash. Lamps are
salvation-army chic.  </P>
<P>Yet even if all this seems oddly outdated, it all contributes the
overall style of the film. Because the dialogue is reportedly unchanged,
the film was required to have a certain quaint, retro feel. (After all,
who in this day and age would say to a stranger, "if it don't gel, it
ain't Jell-O, friend".) The decision to use anachronistic elements does
a lot to support this old-fashioned dialogue and give the film a
coherent feel.</P>
<P>Bernard Herrmann's music from the original film was used to great
effect. Of all the elements, I believe the music was the least changed.
The fact that it still strikes terror in your heart speaks well to
Herrmann's talent. In addition, the soundtrack is more full and rich. At
times, you can hear inaudible whispers or buzzing flies. At one point
near the end, adept use of surround-sound technology enhances the
picture on the screen.</P>
<P>This film will invite all sorts of questions: Why do a shot-by-shot
remake? What was different from the original? Did the original need
updating? But the most important, most obvious question should be: Does
it work?</P>
<PRE>The answer is yes.</PRE>
<P>Creepiness and tension permeate this film. Even if you know the ultimate
outcome, you will still find yourself telling Marion not to stop at the
motel, not to change her clothes, and not to go into the shower. Even if
you know who lives with Norman in that big old house, you will shrivel
in anticipation as the house is searched.</P>
<P>Remakes of movies are always problematic: if you deviate too much,
you're open to criticism of changing the original. Yet if you follow too
closely, you give up any chance of improving on it. Van Sant took the
latter approach to its extreme, accepting that a close copy of the
original might still be pretty good </P>
<PRE>I would have to say that he was right.</PRE>
