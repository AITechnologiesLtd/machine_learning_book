<PRE>CORKY ROMANO
A film review by Annette Cardwell
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The one question that eats at me after seeing Corky Romano is why
Touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film.  Since
June, I haven't been able to turn on the TV or go to the movies without
getting hit by some ad depicting Chris Kattan as the spastic Corky,
shrieking out A-Ha's "Take On Me" in his yellow Miata.  Why would Disney
sink so much cash into the Corky hype machine?  Honestly, I was hoping
that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny
movie.</P>
<P>Man, was I wrong.  Corky Romano is one of those throwaway, cliché-ridden
TV-star-to-film vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots. 
Fortunately for Chris Kattan's precariously positioned career, Corky
does have some good laughs, even if most of them are of the lowest-brow
variety.</P>
<P>Kattan plays the title character, the unsinkable assistant veterinarian
Corky who has a penchant for sunshiny '80s tunes, bright ties, and banal
coffee mug slogans ("You don't have to be crazy to work here, but it
sure helps.").  When his mob boss dad (Peter Falk) is about to be put
away on murder charges, his bungling, lughead brothers (Peter Berg and
Chris Penn) rope in innocent, black sheep Corky to infiltrate the FBI as
an agent and steal the evidence.  Predictably, hijinks ensue.</P>
<P>If the basic plot sounds bad, wait until you get into the inner-workings
of this clunker.  The writers will amaze you with the depth of their
inanity.  Corky's FBI agent identity is named Corky Pissant ("That's
pronounced Pees-ahn.  It's French.").  He becomes a first-rate agent by
accidentally stumbling Mr. Magoo-style onto the proper clues and talking
his way in and out of situations, which plays like something out of a
sitcom.  And not a good sitcom, I mean.  The Romano family brothers even
insult each other by farting in each other's face.  And in a scene taken
straight from There's Something About Mary, Corky gives a dachshund
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.</P>
<P>But it's not a complete disaster.  The manic Kattan does occasionally
rescue some comic moments, including a bit featuring a cat in a fat suit
named Jesus and another involving schoolchildren, a German Shephard, and
a kilo of cocaine.  Plus, Berg -- whose career has obviously gone
downhill since The Last Seduction and Chicago Hope -- gives a great turn
as the illiterate brother Paulie.  And, it's nice to see that Richard
Roundtree of Shaft fame is getting work.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for those out there who can't truly appreciate animal or
fart jokes, Corky won't have much to offer you.  So the next time one of
those pesky ads appears on your TV, asking, "Who is Corky?" you can
simply reply, "Who cares?"</P>
