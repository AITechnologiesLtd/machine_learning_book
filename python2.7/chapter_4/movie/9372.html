<P>    There is no doubt in my mind that David Duchovny can be a movie star.
His often under-appreciated work on "The X-Files" has demonstrated both
dramatic chops and a wry sense of humor, as well as the requisite
physicality for action.  Duchovny has the looks, the smarts and the range
on the big screen to go places most fellow TV alums never go.</P>
<P>     It's also clear that he knows how to pick interesting scripts.  To a
resume which already includes unconventional fare like KALIFORNIA and THE
RAPTURE, Duchovny adds Mark Haskell Smith's PLAYING GOD.  It begins with a
solid premise, introducing us to a former surgeon named Eugene Sands
(Duchovny) one year removed from losing his license for operating on a
patient while high on amphetamines, and beginning a downward spiral into
addiction.  A chance at returning to his trade comes when Sands helps save
the life of a wounded associate of crime boss Raymond Blossom (Timothy
Hutton).  Raymond offers Sands a job as his organization's designated
"gunshot doc," an offer Sands accepts with some reservations.  Eventually
he begins to question his decision, but it may be too late to get out once
he's in, especially with an over-zealous FBI agent (Michael Massee)
breathing down his neck.</P>
<P>     Smith's script does about all you could ask a script to do,
delivering some well-developed characters and smart dialogue (okay, there
are a couple of howlers) in service of that premise.  Duchovny selected a
nice piece of material to work with, but PLAYING GOD shows that an actor
can't choose most of the things which go into the making of a good film.
It has the feel of a film which should have been much better, but turned
out inconsistent and sloppy under the first-time direction of Andy Wilson
(of the popular cable mystery series "Cracker").  There are times when
Wilson tries so hard to create his gritty thriller atmosphere -- all
distorted imagery, slow motion and awkward cross-cutting -- that the
narrative begins to get lost.  He's going for the right mood, but with the
wrong methods.</P>
<P>     Duchovny also had no control over the performances of his
cast-mates, though from all appearances, neither did the director.  While
Duchovny and Angelina Jolie (as Hutton's girlfriend) play low-key to nail
the wounded psyches of their characters, all around them fall victim to
the notion that louder acting is better acting.  Hutton goes irretrievably
bonkers as the bleached beach-bum majordomo whose actions rarely make
sense, various and sundry gangsters exchange profane threats with bug-eyed
malevolence, and Michael Massee plays his off-kilter Fed as a perfect
partner for the cross-dressing G-Man played by Duchovny himself on "Twin
Peaks."  John Hawkes does steal a few scenes as one of Hutton's edgier
hired guns, a ring-nosed psycho with a soft spot for his partners.  His
performance might have been even more effective if a dozen other
supporting players weren't making unhinged seem so unnecessary.</P>
<P>     The general tone of the performances makes Duchovny stand out like
Buster Keaton in a Three Stooges short.  His deadpan demeanor begins to
seem like a reaction to a bunch of nutcase actors let loose on the screen,
rather than the appropriate personality for his redemption-hungry
character.  In fact, Duchovny is too "together" most of the time; rock
bottom doesn't look all that bad if that's where he's supposed to be when
we meet him.  Then again, it's hard to say whether that particular
character choice was Duchovny's to make.  A thousand choices go into the
making of a movie; Duchovny's choice to accept this role was only one of
them.  You can see his star quality in PLAYING GOD, but you can also see
that picking a sharp script is no guarantee that an actor will be in a
sharply-made film.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 God complexes:  4.</PRE>
