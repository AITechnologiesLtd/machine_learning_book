<PRE>                               NICK OF TIME
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     There are very few films that are shot in "real time," the term
meaning that if the action shown on-screen is supposed to occur over a
two-hour period, the film will be a two-hour film.  NICK OF TIME was
shot with that intent.  It is unlikely that the general audience will
be aware of it.  In any case, NICK OF TIME has little else to
distinguish it from the never-ending number of films that are turned
out each day.</P>
<P>     Like so many other action films, there is a certain amount of
suspense ... but not very much.  This one is about an ordinary man,
Gene Watson (Johnny Depp) who with his daughter, Lynn (Courtney Chase)
are kidnaped by a Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) and Ms. Jones (Roma
Maffia).  Watson is told that his daughter will be held hostage in a
van until Watson shoots and murders the Governor, Eleanor Grant (Marsha
Mason) who will be appearing at a re-election rally that day.  Watson
gets the usual cautionary talk about "no tricks" or your daughter is
dead.  And that in essence is the movie's plot. We are indirectly asked
what we would do under such circumstances and with little time to come
up with a feasible plan to thwart the kidnapers.</P>
<P>     If anything saves the film from the rest of this year's action
films, all of which contain the good guys vs. the bad, it is that the
acting here is somewhat better than most films of that ilk.  Johnny
Depp and Christopher Walken are the principals involved in most of the
action.  An important role is played by Huey (Charles S. Dutton) as a
shoeshine man who aids Watson's try to thwart the villains.</P>
<P>     However, the rest of the cast, even those important to the story,
are on the screen only for very short times.  Marsha Mason, Brendan
Grant (as her husband) and even Roma Maffia are only in the film in
short takes, perhaps to keep the film in the "real time."</P>
