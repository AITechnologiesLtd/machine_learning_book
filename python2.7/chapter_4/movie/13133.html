<PRE>MULAN
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        The Disney studios has its formula for annual, full-length animated
features down so pat that it's hard to remember which one you're watching
at any given moment.</P>
<PRE>        "Mulan," their 36th animated adventure, is the latest case in point.</PRE>
<P>        Once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character
(female as usual; Disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--Ariel,
Belle, Pocahontas, and now Mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes
in recent years).  Add the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking
sidekick or two, pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically
placed show tunes (an introspective number by a pool or looking in a
mirror, a rousing anthem, a cutesy, montage-backed crowd pleaser), pose a
few threats to our engaging lead, and tie things all up neatly by the
closing credits.  Bob's your uncle!</P>
<PRE>        Better make that Walt's your uncle...</PRE>
<P>        Kids will no doubt go ga-ga over "Mulan" (or at least the fast food
tie-ins), but familiarity can, after a while, leave grown-ups--this
reviewer included--wishing for a little more.  Maybe an animated feature
without--shock! horror!--the songs, for example?  Or maybe a film in which
a cheeky Chihuahua called Pepe longs to become a matador from Trinidad??
How about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether?</P>
<PRE>        It isn't gonna happen.</PRE>
<P>        Like Disney's previous entries, "Mulan" is slow to make its mark.
The animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and
the humorous element, a madcap dragon wannabe (in the guise of a loquacious
lizard with a case of dry mouth, courtesy Eddie Murphy's animated vocal
talents), plays like an inappropriate if necessary (formula-wise)
afterthought.  However, after about an hour everything comes together and
the formula, like it or not, clicks.</P>
<P>        Highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered
pass (which, due to the sophistication of today's computer-generated
imagery, is hard to tell from the real thing), a memorable, show-stopping
musical interlude ("I'll Make a Man Out of You," penned by Matthew Wilder
and David Zippel), and last but not least, Mulan herself.</P>
<P>        Voiced by Ming-Na Wen, Mulan is Disney's strongest female character
to date.  When hordes of Huns pour over China's Great Wall and threaten to
overthrow the Imperial Palace, the emperor decrees that every family in the
land dispatch one man to serve in the Imperial army.  Since Mulan's father
is infirm, but proud, the high-spirited Mulan steals her father's armor
and, incognito, signs up to face the Mongolian menace.</P>
<P>        Attracted to, but not distracted by, her commanding officer Shang
(B.D. Wong), Mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts, wit, and
physical ability.  She's a woman of the '90s a couple of millennia ahead of
her time.</P>
<PRE>        Formulaic to a T, "Mulan" remains a classic case of "if it ain't
broke, don't fix it."</PRE>
