<PRE>                              THE FRIGHTENERS
                       A film review by David Wilcock
                        Copyright 1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING MICHAEL J. FOX
DIRECTED BY PETER JACKSON
RUNNING TIME: 2HRS 10MINS
UNIVERSAL RELEASE</PRE>
<P>After Heavenly Creatures, Peter Jackson returns to the genre that
started him off...the over the top horror comedy. Sadly, this is not as
over the top as some of his other films (Dead Alive, Meet the Feebles)
but is still very good fun. Fox plays a ghost exterminator who can
really see ghosts, thanks to an near death experience that he had. He
is running a scam by making the ghosts he knows mess up people houses a
bit, and then he comes and gets 'rid' of them. However, things start to
go weird when people really are being visited by a ghost who gives
their heart a bit of a squeeze. The suspicion falls to Fox, and he must
prove his innocence.</P>
<P>One of the main things about this film is the speacil effects. And they
really are quite speacil. The ghosts faces get ripped off, ceilings
ripple, and the Soul Taker is a very impressive piece of speacil
effects. And, even the plot if quite good. However, don't take this
film as a proper comedy. The main emphasis is on gore etc, and there is
a lot of it.</P>
<P>If there is one bad thing about this film, it will have to be Jeffrey
Combs FBI agent. He is way over the top, and is irritating after a
while. Also, he is not really needed in the picuture, and his charecter
should've been toned down if they wanted an FBI agent that much.</P>
<P>Another bad thing about the film is the gaping plot holes. For example,
when Fox dies, he can walk though the floor, while the other ghosts
can't.  Also, although ghosts can interact with anything, John Astins
character sits down in a chair! They are also many other gaps like
this. But because you're enjoying yourself so much, you never really
think about these things until after the movie.</P>
<P>So, overall, this is a good film, and if you can stand blood and guts
and intense speacil effects, then this is the film for you.</P>
