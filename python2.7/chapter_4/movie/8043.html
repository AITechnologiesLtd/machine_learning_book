                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>Chad'z rating: **** (out of 4 = excellent)
1995, R, 125 minutes [2 hours, 5 minutes]
[thriller/mystery]
starring: Brad Pitt (Detective David Mills), Morgan Freeman (Detective
William Sommerset), Gwenyth Paltrow (Tracy Mills), written by Andrew  K.
Walker, produced by Arnold Kopelson, Phyllis Carlyle, directed by David
Fincher.</P>
<P>"Seven" is one of the best mystery movies I've ever seen. It's extremely
intriguing and suspenseful, but it's also quite fun. It's a serial killer
mystery, but you don't care so much about making the killer pay as much as
hope they just catch the killer.</P>
<P>The story is a cops-on-the-trail-of-serial-killer mystery. Someone is
murdering people who are offenders of "The Seven Deadly Sins." A fat man
(gluttony) was forced to eat himself to death, a lawyer (greed) is
slaughtered by his own rich possessions... I could go on but revealing any
more would give away entirely too much.</P>
<P>What makes this film so unique is the characterization of the "good guys"
which makes the unseen villain seem so vile. Brad Pitt stars is quite
excellent as Detective David Mills, the cocky rookie. However, Morgan Freeman
is even better as Detective William Sommerset, the wise veteran on the verge
of retirement (and he doesn't get killed by the end). There is a great sense
of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief. This
is impressive because the mood is so tense, and the fact that it can be
down-played as well as it is here (let alone at all) is quite an
accomplishment.</P>
<P>The setting takes place in present day New York City but the art direction
is able to give the city a feeling of the evil, scary place many believe it
to be. The production design is superb, in the spirit of "Batman" and "The
Crow," this film embodies the Gothic mood. The way the words fade in and out,
along with the freaky Nine Inch Nails music really add a lot to the story on
a subconscious level - even the credits are scary!</P>
<P>The killer's victims have no connections at all, and thus Mills and
Sommerset don't have much to go on to solve the case. They can only wait for
the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense. We become just
as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of
the unknown. Not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing
screenplay as this. </P>
<P>The only problem I had with the film is the way in which Mills and Sommerset
are lead to a suspect. Let's just say it seems a little too "mystery movie,"
or too convenient in other words. When they are led to a suspect by the name
of  John Doe, a terrific chase scene ensues. This is a typical thrilling
element, but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story. </P>
<P>If anything, this film is the epitome of twist endings. I don't have to tell
you Mills and Sommerset finally catch the criminal, but the way in which this
happens is surprising. There is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the
killer and the detectives, and even though he's obviously insane, his
charisma makes for some good points. What's even more surprising is the last
few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the
film's resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is.</P>
<P>"Seven" is not just a film about crime, but about the evil within man. John
Doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of "scum." But as
justified as he makes himself seem, we must never be tempted by such twisted
ideals of justice.</P>
