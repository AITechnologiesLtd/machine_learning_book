<PRE>THE CIDER HOUSE RULES
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        While screen adaptations of John Irving's novels have been
disappointingly uneven, the films have all shared one particular strength:
key casting.  Who can forget John Lithgow as Roberta Muldoon, the
transsexual quarterback of "The World According to Garp," or Nastassja
Kinski as Susie the Bear in "The Hotel New Hampshire"?</P>
<P>        A lot of good casting decisions have gone into the making of "The
Cider House Rules," an adaptation of Irving's poetic 1994 novel about a
restless young man called Homer Wells.</P>
<P>        Among those sound judgments was the decision to have the splendid
Tobey Maguire assume the pivotal role; the decision to cast Michael Caine
as his mentor and father figure, Dr. Wilbur Larch, the ether-addicted head
obstetrician of the St. Cloud's orphanage, Maine; and the decision to offer
Jane Alexander and Kathy Baker supporting roles as his head nurses.</P>
<P>        Then there are the brethren who populate the apple orchard where
Homer Wells finds himself shortly after leaving St. Cloud's, including
Delroy Lindo, Oscar®-worthy as the foreman of the migrant work detail that
drifts up and down the coast as the seasons take them.  There's Kate
Nelligan as the matriarch of the cider house, and Charlize Theron as Candy,
the lovely, lonely wife of a WWII bomber pilot (Paul Rudd) sent away on a
mission overseas leaving Candy to set lobster traps with Homer Wells, a man
who's never seen the ocean before let alone a lobster.</P>
<P>        Am I forgetting anyone?  Yes.  Kieran Culkin and Paz de la Huerta
as dissolute orphanage residents who make you sit up and take notice every
time they're on the screen.</P>
<P>        But with "The Cider House Rules," the good people decisions don't
end with the cast.  Irving has written his own screenplay in order to get
it right this time (last year's "Simon Birch," loosely based on his "A
Prayer for Owen Meaney," was a big-screen example of Irving handled
sub-standardly); the author appears fleetingly as a stationmaster here.
Rachel Portman, a composer of such sweet and lyrical tenderness, provides a
score that's absolutely right for the project--sweet, lyrical, and tender.
There's impressive New England photography by Oliver Stapleton too.</P>
<P>        Last but by no means least is "My Life as a Dog" director Lasse
Hallström, who shows enormous skill in pulling this collective together and
helping bring Irving's marvelously touching story to life.  For the many
beloved who pass away in "The Cider House Rules," it's an extraordinarily
life-affirming story.  And now, thanks to these talented individuals, it's
an extraordinarily life-affirming film.</P>
