Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) 4 stars out of 4. Starring Chow
Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, Chang Chen and Cheng Peipei. Written
by James Schamus, Wang Hui Ling and Tsai Kuo Jung. Based on a novel by
Wang Du Lu. Music by Tan Dun. Directed by Ang Lee. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P> If you see one movie this year, I strongly urge that it be Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon.</P>
<P> This Ang Lee spectacle combines soaring adventure with a rousing love
story.</P>
<P> It is epic filmmaking on a grand scale. Oh, and it is in Mandarin.</P>
<P> Lee, best known for work behind the camera on Sense and Sensibility and
The Ice Storm, has returned to his roots, filming a novel by Wang Du Lu.</P>
<P> The story dealing with warrior wizards is similar to the stories Lee
grew up with.</P>
<P> The protagonists of this two-hour epic are Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat),
Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi).</P>
<P> Chowís Li is a world-weary warrior ready to give up his ways. To prove
so he asks Shu Lien to present his legendary sword, The Green Destiny,
to Sir Te as a gift and token of his respect and devotion.</P>
<P> However, shortly after carrying out her mission, the sword is stolen by
a mysterious warrior.</P>
<P> Li and Shu Lien then begin a series of adventures in which they seek
the sword and this new warrior.</P>
<P> Meanwhile, Shu Lien grows close to Jen, a young woman betrothed in
marriage who seeks an alternative life. She, of course, is the
mysterious thief and is as skilled in the ways of the warrior as Li and
Shu Lien.</P>
<P> Any description of this movie does it an injustice. It is one that must
be seen to be appreciated. Itís grandeur and craftsmanship must be
viewed first-hand..</P>
<P> Especially spectacular are the martial arts sequences, choreographed by
Woo-ping Yuen, who also staged the fights in The Matrix. Here, the
combatants fly over rooftops, confront each other on slim tree limbs
hundreds of feet of the ground and glide over water.</P>
<PRE> Itís a breathtaking experience.</PRE>
<P> But what really makes Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon so appealing is
the human element. Screenwriters James Schamus, Wang Hui Ling and Tsai
Kuo Jung present us with characters who have a history, who have weight.</P>
<P> The unrequited love between Li and Shu Lien, their warrior code, their
sacrifices, are all the more poignant because we come to care for them.</P>
<P> Jen, too, is presented as a complex, headstrong individual who wrestles
with herself before finally deciding on a path to follow.</P>
<P> What is also interesting is that for a movie of this stripe, the
bloodshed is at a minimum. Itís the beauty of the combat that Lee
emphasizes, not the outcome.</P>
<P> Lee is ably assisted by cinematographer Peter Pau, who has captured
some exquisite landscapes and vistas, as well as the music of Tan Dun ó
aided by cello solos by Yo-Yo Ma ó which sets a kind of mythic tone for
the movie.</P>
<P> Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an exuberant movie exercise. It
neatly captures the potential of the cinema to take you into a foreign
culture and get you caught up in its mythology.</P>
<P> Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a sure bet to win the best foreign
language film at the Academy Awards. I also think Lee should be
recognized in the directorís category for this splendid achievement.</P>
<P> This is a must-see experience for anyone who loves movies. It will
leave you gasping, awed and overwhelmed. Don't deny yourselves the
pleasure of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It is monumental.</P>
