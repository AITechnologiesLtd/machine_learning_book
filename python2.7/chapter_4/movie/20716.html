<P>People emigrate from the Indian subcontinent to the West for a variety
of reasons, but the most common is to just make a living, because for
many that is easier in the foreign land than it is at home. The
sacrifice that is made, often unknowingly, is a way of life, and often
the scorn of the Westerners who see the newcomers as threats. Some
people are able to retain the value system of their old culture, but
many also assimilate into the new surroundings. Some do this because
they know their existence in the foreign land is more than temporary,
so they try to be less foreign. Others do it simply because they want
to fit in more easily, and be accepted by the locals so they can live
their lives without disturbance.</P>
<P>Hanif Kureishi has written many stories centered around Pakistanis who
have settled in England. Some have been produced as films, most
notably My Beautiful Laundrette and Sammy and Rosie get Laid. My Son
the Fanatic is an adaptation of one of his short stories. Usually his
main characters are highly assimilated members of the second
generation. These people often identify themselves mainly as British,
but are still influenced by the Eastern culture of their parents. The
roles are reversed in this story, because it is the parent who has
assimilated, while his son is driven into a zealous pursuit of
religion and culture in an attempt to fill his self-realizational
needs.</P>
<P>Parvez (Om Puri) is a taxi driver in an economically depressed English
city. Although it once had a thriving textile industry, the factories
have gone and the population has faced hard times. Parvez often sees
the dark underside of the town as his job takes him through all parts
at all times. Parvez's friend Fizzy (Harish Patel) arrived in England
the same time as Parvez, twenty five years prior, but the two men's
fortunes followed different paths. The enterprising Fizzy has worked
hard and become a restaurant owner. The unambitious Parvez has been
driving a cab for a quarter century. Although Parvez barely makes a
living, he is fully content with his lot in life. However, his
self-satisfaction contrasts with the attitude of his family. His wife,
Minoo (Gopi Desai), resents the fact that Parvez has not risen to a
more respectable profession and become a better provider. Besides the
fact that driving a taxi pays minimally, it keeps Parvez occupied and
outside the house, leaving him little time with his family. Over time,
the relationship between Parvez and Minoo has become distant, but a
deeper split emerges between Parvez and his son, Farid (Akbar Kurtha).</P>
<P>Farid has grown up in England, is studying accounting, plays guitar,
and has gotten engaged to an English girl. At the start of the story,
Farid is cast as a typical second generation immigrant--he is aware of
his culture, but has apparently assimilated. However, there are
barriers to his assimilation that anger Farid. He sees that people
look down on his family because not only are they dark-skinned
"Pakis", but also because his father is a lowly taxi driver. Farid
reacts by rejecting the Western culture that rejects him. He breaks
off his engagement and joins a group of devout Muslims who decry the
immorality of Western culture. He is also angry that his father
accepts the place in society that they are forced into. Such concerns
really do not register to Parvez. His whole approach to life is mellow
and accepting. Although he does face bigotry, he is not affected by
it. He accepts it as one of the facets of his world.</P>
<P>Parvez finds a kindred spirit in Bettina (Rachel Griffiths), one of
the many prostitutes who ply their trade on the streets that Parvez
drives. In fact, they have almost become business associates because
their occupations bring them in contact so often. Over time they have
developed a friendship. Bettina is grounded and self respecting, and
Parvez is a rare man who treats her with kindness. Bettina a is caring
listener who has learned quite a lot about Parvez's feelings and
concerns from the time they have spent together. Parvez finds and
acceptance and admiration from Bettina that he does not get from
others. Although he does not care any less for his wife and son, he
has developed a tender relationship with Bettina.</P>
<P>The story takes on several serious issues and is engaging. However, it
does appear weak in one place--the character of Bettina. The character
of a sympathetic prostitute is hardly original. Although Griffiths
gives a capable performance, she is limited by the stereotype. In
contrast, Puri gives an exceptional performance as Parvez. There is
nothing extreme about Parvez, but Puri molds a character that the
viewer fully understands, appreciates, and admires by the end of the
film. Parvez's strength, his fairness and sensibility, are not
extruded at discrete moments, but rather the character builds with all
he does and says. He is written with depth, and portrayed effectively.
No one else is developed as thoroughly as Parvez. Farid is given
relatively little depth. At the beginning of the story his is on the
cusp of his rejection of Western values and his immersion into
fundamentalism. After that he is given little development, but this is
because as a character, he is not important. He represents an
antagonistic view to Parvez's general outlook. This conflict is
intelligently portrayed because Parvez does not directly represent the
values opposed by his son. The conflict is not between Parvez and
Farid, but rather it is between the many components of Parvez's world.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. It is a very ambitious film, but the story does
take shortcuts. This is easily forgivable because it also takes on
serious subjects and does not feel the need to preach.</P>
