<PRE>                          JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG

<P>        There are better three-hour epics and far-better courtroom 
dramas than this (ANATOMY OF A MURDER and 12 ANGRY 
MONKEYS for starters), but JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG is 
for the most part a compelling Nazi retrospective reenacting the 
Nuremberg Trials of 1948. The outcome is never in question, but 
the German defense attorney does a convincing job of introducing 
arguments that shed doubt on the guilt of the Nazi judges and 
lawyers put on trial. His line of argument is that they were merely 
following orders and weren't aware of the concentration camps, 
until German doctor Burt Lancaster's guilt brings on a climactic 
speech contradicting everything the defense attorney argued.</P>
<P>        There are too many climactic speeches in the 
movie -- multiple climaxes, you might say. Besides stirring 
speeches from the head judge, both lawyers and Lancaster, there 
are also a couple tense scenes with witnesses on the stand. One 
was a forced sterilization victim whom the prosecutor argues was 
neutered because he was Jewish, but it's painfully (not as painful 
as a sterilization though) obvious that he was sterilized because 
of his mental incompetence. Another is a young woman whose 
elderly Jewish lover had been executed for suspected rape, but the 
defense attorney breaks her down by yelling over and over the 
question, "DID YOU SIT ON HIS LAP?!"</P>
<P>        Nobody knows why this would break a person's defenses 
down, but it does. It's also better not to ask why everyone in 
Germany is speaking English, even though the first ten minutes in 
the courtroom have interpreters relaying the questions back and 
forth between the Americans and Germans. Then, midway through 
the defense attorney's opening remarks, he switches to English, as 
do the other Germans. Hell, even the sterilized idiot speaks perfect 
English. He can't remember Hitler's birthday but he can remember 
vocabulary words and dozens of complex verb forms.</P>
<P>        JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG is at its best when it milks 
Nazi inhumanity for emotion, particularly during the showing of a 
newsreel of atrocities, but it starts to become incredibly tedious 
after the 150-minute mark. By the three hour mark it seems longer 
than World War II itself. Part of the blame lies in the lengthy 
speeches but most of it is in the needless out-of-the-courtroom 
scenes which show the judge and his assistant (a young, pre-
hairpiece William Shatner) out on the town with old German sexpot 
(Marlene Dietrich) who wants to convince the judge that not all 
Germans are monsters. SCHINDLER'S LIST it ain't, but it still 
makes for an overwhelmingly positive viewing experience.</P>
