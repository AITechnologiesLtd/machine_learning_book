<P>Call it a horror version of a spaghetti western, with lots and lots of 
sauce. John Carpenter's "Vampires" is an incredibly bloody, gory machismo-
fest, with as much snarling, hateful, no-nonsense manly-man posturing as 
Carpenter can cram into 104 minutes. This is the kind of film that will 
prompt countless Internet postings with subject lines like "'Vampires' 
Kicks Ass!" and "Carpenter Rules!" And trust me, anyone who posts 
otherwise will quickly be deemed a "pussy" or a "queer" by those same 
zealots. </P>
<P>Based on the novel "Vampire$" by John Steakly, the story focuses on a 
crack team of vampire killers, financed by the Catholic Church, roaming 
the American Southwest looking for head bloodsucker Valek (Thomas Ian 
Griffith), the fallen priest who started the whole undead thing centuries 
ago. Team leader Jack Crow (James Woods) is a coked-up version of the 
standard Carpenter anti-hero: imagine a gaunt Snake Plissken, only way 
more surly, whupping major vampire butt while spitting out vicious one-
liners (at one point he taunts a priest, saying "When I was kicking your 
ass, Father, did you get wood?"). </P>
<P>Crow's second-in-command, Tony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), is another man's 
man. He explains the harsh realities of vampires to recently-bitten 
hooker, Katrina (Sheryl Lee), growling "It's not like they're a bunch of 
romantic Eurotrash fags dressed in formal wear." In the hours before a 
victim "turns," they have a telepathic link with the bloodsucker who 
nailed them, so Crow and Montoya coolly inform Katrina that they will use 
her as a vampire radar-detector, but the minute she turns, they'll kill 
her in a flash. In the meantime, they strap her face down on a bed, 
conveniently nude so Carpenter devotees can ogle Lee's shapely rear-end. 
While Montoya baby-sits Katrina, Crow threatens the Catholic powers-that-
be and tortures a priest for information.     </P>
<P>Am I painting a vivid enough picture? If not, here's a little more. The 
vampires are feral creatures, mean as hell and dressed like Marilyn 
Manson roadies. They're extremely violent: Valek slices one victim from 
crotch to head and we get to watch the body split in two, with guts 
spilling all over the place. They're not easy to kill either. Basically, 
you have to stake them, then drag their bodies into the sunlight where 
they burst into flames while screaming and flailing about.</P>
<P>As mentioned earlier, the whole thing plays like a souped-up spaghetti 
western and, for a while, it works. After years of enduring Anne Rice's 
effete Harlequin Romance vampires, it's fun to see the lace-cuffs ripped 
away from the genre. James Woods has a great time playing a bastard and 
it's entertaining watching him enjoy himself. There are some striking 
images: vampires striding confidently across the desert towards the 
camera, Valek lying on the ceiling waiting to strike. There's a great set 
piece at a motel, and the inevitable show-down, while awfully stupid, 
does have a strong sense of perverse style. And, for a while, it's 
amusing listening to dialogue so calculated to offend.</P>
<P>But eventually, the nihilism becomes tiresome, the gore and mayhem grows 
repetitive and you just want the damn thing to end. Carpenter did 
creepier gore in "The Thing." He did more effective fight scenes and B-
movie gags in "They Live" and better stoic macho theatrics in "Escape 
>From New York." "Vampires" is a minor guilty pleasure, but I'm tired of 
watching Carpenter rework his old tricks. It would be so terrific to see 
him try something new, like skipping feature-length pissing contests and 
creating films with actual characters and plots with some meat to them. </P>
<P>So there you have it. Ed Johnson-Ott's "Review" of John Carpenter's 
"Vampires." Zealots can reach me at <A HREF="mailto:pbbp24a@prodigy.com.">pbbp24a@prodigy.com.</A> Feel free to put 
"pussy" or "queer" in the subject line so I'll know it's from you.</P>
