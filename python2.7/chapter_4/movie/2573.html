<P>     One hardly expects a movie about logging to be this compelling.  The 
reason is that co-writer/director Jay Craven has the good sense to keep 
the actual mechanics of logging in the background while bringing the 
characters to the fore.  And no matter how much Rip Torn's Noel Lord may 
be shaped by his craft ("I'm a logger.  A man can be no more than he 
is."), WHERE THE RIVERS FLOW NORTH is ultimately defined by him and his 
housekeeper Bangor (Tantoo Cardinal). </P>
<P>     The story is an old one:  the battle of the individual against the 
forces of government-backed big money.  It's tradition against progress, 
with the latter holding the trump card.  No matter how much we hate to 
admit it, this has always been the way of this country, and Jay Craven's 
feature debut is just another example. </P>
<P>     The year is 1927; the setting is Kingdom County, Vermont.  The local 
power company is beginning construction on a huge dam that will provide 
electricity for the entire area.  The only thing that stands in their way 
is Noel Lord, who has a lifetime lease to the land on which his family 
has lived for generations.  Everyone except Noel has sold, but he remains 
steadfast in his intent to stay where he is.  Equally determined are the 
power company executives Quinn and Clayton (played by Bill Raymond and 
Michael J. Fox), who have at their disposal money, the law, and, if 
necessary, more violent methods. </P>
<P>     While the struggles of Noel against his adversaries provide WHERE 
THE RIVERS FLOW NORTH with its energy, these are actually rather routine.  
Quinn and Clayton are stereotypes, and no attempt is made to characterize 
them as more than one-dimensional villains.  They want the land, and 
that's all there is to it.   </P>
<P>     Of far greater interest is Noel's relationship with Bangor, an 
American Indian who has lived with him in near-seclusion for twenty-five 
years.  These two are comfortable with each other's odd ways, and have 
all the affection of an aging married couple.  The reality of their 
interactions easily shunts aside the shallowness with which the script 
treats the power company executives. </P>
<P>     Veteran actor Rip Torn, who played similar parts in HEARTLAND and 
CROSS CREEK, gives a gritty, gutsy performance as the long-haired, 
cigarette-smoking Noel.  Tantoo Cardinal, Kicking Bird's wife in DANCES 
WITH WOLVES (a film with a similar message), holds her own in every scene 
with Torn.  One doesn't often talk about "chemistry" with older 
characters, but it's definitely there. </P>
<P>     In addition to being beautifully photographed and establishing a 
strong sense of "place", Craven's film is thoughtful, well-paced, and 
never manipulative.  The latter is critical, because it keeps certain 
scenes from descending into melodrama.  Ultimately, this period piece 
gives us a glimpse into a part of history that many may not be familiar 
with.  Even more importantly, it presents an opportunity to spend one-
hundred odd minutes with a pair of characters the likes of which we 
rarely come across - in person or on screen. </P>
