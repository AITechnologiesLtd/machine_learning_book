 Shaft (2000) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Richard
Roundtree, Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Christian Bale, Busta
Rhymes, Dan Hedaya and Toni Collette. Music by David Arnold and Isaac
Hayes. Story by John Singleton and Shane Salerno. Screenplay by Richard
Price and Singleton and Salerno. Directed by Singleton.</P>
<P> The original "Shaft," when released in 1971, was big on attitude.</P>
<P> The movie worked because nothing like it had been seen before - and
because of the charisma of Richard Roundtree, the then-epitome of cool
as private eye John Shaft.</P>
<P> The film was helped along by a funky, driving score by Isaac Hayes as
well as his Oscar-winning Shaft theme song.</P>
<P> Jump ahead nearly 30 years and we have Samuel L. Jackson as Shaft. The
movie still has loads of attitude. But today's audiences are more
sophisticated and demanding. Unfortunately this new "Shaft" offers very
little else.</P>
<P> Jackson, like Roundtree before him, is a commanding presence. He is an
actor who can dominate the screen. He also is one of those actors who
can rise above weak material - most of the time - as he did earlier this
year in "Rules of Engagement."</P>
<P> With young John Singleton directing, as well as having a hand in the
script, you'd think this "Shaft" would be a rousing action thriller, a
gritty homage to the original.</P>
<P> Think again. Singleton's "Shaft" is flabby and disjointed.</P>
<P> The plot is a muddled mess, motivation is preposterous and some of the
characters are ridiculous, almost insulting.</P>
<P> Take Peoples, for example. He's the villainous drug dealer. As
portrayed by Jeffrey Wright, he speaks with an accent that sounds as if
he's doing a poor Desi Arnaz imitation. Any minute I expected to call
for Lucy and ask her to `esplain' what she's doing.</P>
<P> He's not the only problem. The script by Singleton and Shane Salerno,
with help from Richard Price ("The Color of Money," "Clockers") is
unfocused.</P>
<P> The movie just jumps from one scene to another without any cohesion or
thought. It's like Singleton just took what he filmed and glued it
together.</P>
<P> Luckily Jackson is in most scenes. But he appears to have problems
getting a handle on his Shaft. He can't decide if he's a tough mother
... (hey, we're talkin' about Shaft), or if he prefers to be a bit
tongue-in-cheek.</P>
<P> His persona seems to change from scene to scene, and he doesn't seem to
be getting any assistance from Singleton.</P>
<P> Unlike Roundtree's Shaft who became a P.I. because he felt the system
was corrupt and discriminated against his people, Jackson's Shaft starts
out as a police detective, and leaves the force in disgust when he feels
the justice system has failed. He doesn't necessarily become a P.I., but
more like a lone-wolf vigilante, with most of his former police partners
helping him out.</P>
<P> And while Roundtree appears in the film, he is wasted. His only scenes
involve him standing around and talking to his namesake nephew. He still
looks good, but it would have been nice to see the original Man in
action.</P>
<P> The plot deals with finding a witness to a 2-year-old murder. The
killer, a spoiled rich young bigot, played by Christian Bale, seems a
lightweight case for Shaft to handle. And some of the killer's actions
make no sense whatsoever. How he and the thick-accented drug dealer come
to work together is just too silly to believe.</P>
<P> Plus this is one of those movies in which the bad guys fire hundreds of
rounds from automatic weapons and miss everything, while Shaft makes
bulls-eyes with every shot.</P>
<P> The bad guys are so inept, they are like the gang that couldn't shoot
straight. They are most unworthy adversaries.</P>
<P> Smartly, Singleton retained Hayes' original score without any updating.
David Arnold did a fine job adapting the music and adding some touches
of his own.</P>
<P> Overall, however, "Shaft" is a disappointment considering the talent in
front of and behind the camera. This is a movie that had potential. Too
bad it was wasted.</P>
