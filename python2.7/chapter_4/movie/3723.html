<PRE>                               A LITTLE PRINCESS
                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1995 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     Towards the end of A LITTLE PRINCESS, there is a scene where
the young heroine awakes to find that something purely magical has
occurred.  The night before, she and her friend had been using their
imagination to escape from the sad realism of their world.  In the
morning, they discover that what they had imagined had become
reality.  Magic is the *only* explanation that the film offers for
this event.  The scene works completely because, by this point, the
movie has completely convinced the audience that magic is truly
possible as long as you believe in it hard enough.</P>
<P>     This is the second film adaptation of Frances Hodgson
Burnett's classic children's novel "Sara Crewe", which was previously
filmed in 1939 with Shirley Temple (in a film that was also entitled
A LITTLE PRINCESS).  Screenwriters Richard LaGravenese and Elizabeth
Chandler along with director Alfonso Cuaron have created an absolute
gem of a movie, by far the best of 1995 to date.</P>
<P>     Fantasy is frequently an important part of the movies, but
this is a special film that is *about* fantasy and the power of the
human imagination.  The story is centered around young Sara Crewe
(Liesel Matthews), the daughter of a British Army captain.  After her
mother's death, her father has raised her on his own in India.  When
the father has to go off to fight in World War I, Sara is sent to a
New York boarding school run by the cruel and strict Miss Minchin
(Eleanor Bron).</P>
<P>     Even in the oppressive environment of the boarding school,
Sara maintains an unswerving belief in the power of imagination and
the existence of magic.  Through her undying spirit, she is able to
bring new life to everyone around her with the exception Miss
Minchin.  This is largely accomplished through Sara's telling of
elaborate, fantastic stories about life in India.  Cuaron beautifully
intercuts this storytelling with colorful fantasy sequences that 
visually bring the stories to life.  These fantasy sequences really
work because they actually seem like they are being shown from the
point-of-view of Sara's own imagination.</P>
<P>     Bron plays Miss Minchin as a menacing and controlling villain,
but she isn't purely evil. It seems clear that Miss Minchin feels
*threatened* by Sara's complete acceptance of magic and fantasy. Miss
Minchin is so completely steeped in the "real" world that she is not
only unwilling, but also *unable* to recognize the power of the
imagination.  In one key scene, Sara directly confronts Miss Minchin
with her belief that it is the right of all girls to be princesses. 
After this scene, it was a bit startling to realize that the look on
Miss Minchin's face is *regret* that she is unable to see the world
the same way.</P>
<P>     As Sara, Liesel Matthews gives a very natural, convincing
performance.  She truly has the *look* of a "little princess."  Some
of this comes from her natural appearance, but even more it comes
from the way that she carries herself and by her facial expressions. 
She appears to be wise, but not in a precocious way.  At all times,
she seems like a *real* child, but one that truly understands the
wonder of childhood.</P>
<P>     Initially, the early scenes between Sara and her father (Liam
Cunningham) may seem a little overly sappy.  Their relationship is so
loving and good that it stretches believability a little bit.  After
a while, though, I found that I understood the reasons that the
relationship was portrayed in this manner.  This relationship
*needed* to seem ideal in order for some of the later events of the
film to have their proper impact.</P>
<P>     Sometimes the right music score can greatly enhance even the
finest films.  Patrick Doyle has provided some absolutely amazing
music for this one.  Ever since he burst onto the scene with his
powerful score to Kenneth Branagh's HENRY V, Doyle has been one of
the most exciting working film composers.  This score is probably his
best effort to date.  He has provided a magical, almost operatic
score that mixes soaring orchestral music with some terrific vocal
and choral pieces.</P>
<P>     After a tragedy occurs towards the middle of the film, Sara
begins to lose her spirit.  That spirit is rekindled in a powerful
and magical sequence where she awakes in the night and discovers that
it has started to snow.  We are able to literally *feel* her faith in
magic returning as she dances in the snow.  The scene simply would
not have worked without the accompaniment Doyle's hauntingly
beautiful song "Kindle My Heart."  In the liner notes for the
soundtrack CD, Cuaron explains that the scene was literally designed 
*around* that song.  What an incredible testament to the power of
Doyle's music.</P>
<P>     So much of the impact of A LITTLE PRINCESS is purely emotional
that it is a somewhat difficult film to review.  It is tough to
precisely put my finger on exactly *why* this film works so well.  In
the end, I always come back to my total acceptance of that one
magical scene that I referenced at the beginning of this review.  For
me, the best movies are the ones that tell a story so convincingly
that I am willing to completely accept anything that happens, no
matter how unlikely.  That is exactly what happened here. </P>
<P>     I actually saw the film a few weeks ago, but did not feel
ready to write my review before this.  It has surprised me a bit how
much I have found myself thinking about the film.  Even at this late
date, I feel that it is important for me to make an attempt to
capture some of my feelings about the film in writing.</P>
<P>     I also feel that this review is a worthwhile effort because
the movie really *needs* all of the support it can get. 
Unfortunately, Warner Bros has chosen to dump the film with little
support.  Here in Columbus, Ohio they released the film with
virtually no advertising and without even holding advance screenings
for local reviewers.  The critic for the largest local newspaper
didn't manage to get his rave review for the film published until 4
days after the movie opened (and after its opening weekend had
passed).  At this time, the film has already virtually disappeared
from theaters.  I urge anyone reading this *not* to let this
wonderful movie get away.  I also want to emphasize that this is not
just a movie for small children.  It is a movie for *anyone* that
appreciates good stories and magical filmmaking.
