<PRE>                       TIME REGAINED (LE TEMPS RETROUVE)
                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp

<P> A literal adaptation of the final book of Marcel Proust's Remembrances
of Things Past would be inconceivable and boring, since the tastes and
smells which reveal layers of memory cannot be captured onscreen. Raoul
Ruiz's Time Regained does the next best thing. Ruiz weaves a fragmented,
experimental narrative in the form of a tapestry. There's an uncanny
beauty achieved by telling his story in this manner, which reveals
thoughts and inactions by using the very limitations of the film medium.
He presents us with a series of photographs, or images shot into mirrors
or through doorways which open up to the past and present (and cross-cut
between the two with relative ease.)</P>
<P> Taking place within the huge estates and manor houses of the cultural
elite, with string quartets playing in their studies and tiny cakes
neatly arranged on trays in their kitchens, our main character, Marcel
(Marcelo Mazzarello) wanders through this world drinking it in. The plot
is inconsequential, it is more about observing the crowded rooms and
bitten back emotions, the sips of wine and soft handshakes. Every now
and then, Marcel is forced to confront his decadent relatives
(sneeringly funny John Malkovich and sour Pascal Greggory.)</P>
<P> Ruiz cleverly stages a prologue with the elder Proust (Andre Engel,
voiced by filmmaker Patrice Chereau) wasting away in his bedroom, the
best years of his life behind him, reciting passages from his book to
his servant girl and allowing the objects in the room to trigger
thoughts about his family, his would-be lovers (particularly Odette, the
woman who haunts him his entire life, played by the elegant Catherine
Deneuve) and loved ones, his enemies and his false friends.</P>
<P> Ruiz is a master at keeping his themes and meaning palatable and
comprehensible even when shifting from the main character's childhood to
middle age, or having the child and adult version of the protagonist
onscreen at the same time. It doesn't feel pretentious, since Ruiz
clearly has a sincere fondness for this main character. The stand-in for
Marcel Proust, Mazzarello, doesn't emote very much as he wanders
aimlessly through the elegant locations, but he has deep and friendly
eyes and a sad smile half hidden under his moustache.</P>
<P> Marcel finds himself jumping back and forth in these memories, and one
starts to wonder how much he has romanticized that past? He may be
remarkably similar to the stuffed shirts who surround him, sitting in
their circles, smoking cigars and wondering who's who in terms of
reputation and their place in the ladder of class structure. Ultimately,
those things don't matter, and fade away. In the film's best scene, we
see his half mad colleague and former nemesis, Charlus (Malkovich) lead
him through the park as they discuss their old friends. `How is this
one…? Mort. How is that one? Mort.' In the dialogue within this
exchange,. Proust's philosophy is revealed. Things fade away, and all we
have is this small, precious present moment in time – everything else
passes into dust.</P>
<P> It's a difficult film to catch hold of, and demands enormous patience
and a willingness to allow yourself the ability to drink in this film,
as though it were some very rich cake to be savored. It demands to be
eaten slowly, and to slowly fill you up. It's not for every occasion,
though, or for every audience. Those unwilling to submit to a slow
paced, metaphysical project may quickly grow frustrated with this item,
but if you allow it to be an interactive experience, you may well
consider memories of your own through the process of watching – and
that's worth more than any film could offer.</P>
