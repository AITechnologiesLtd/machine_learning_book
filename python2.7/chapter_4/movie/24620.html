<P>What causes someone to grow so tired of the world--so unhappy and weary of 
going through the paces on a day-to-day basis--that they are driven to take 
their own life? Any one person can speculate such a question all they want, 
but inevitably will fail to draw a satisfying conclusion. There are 
occurrences in life that can't be explained, and the tragic mystery that is 
suicide is something that remains unresolved for everyone except the victim, 
who seems to hold all the answers, yet, at the same time, none at all.</P>
<P>Based on the 1993 novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, Sofia Coppola's "The Virgin 
Suicides" is an elucidating masterpiece, a film of both penetrating beauty 
and baffling perplexity. It is startling and maybe even a little frightening, 
not because it is a typical horror film, but because the unforgettable themes 
and images it presents are distinct, irrefutable, and unshakably puzzling. 
More questions than answers are posed throughout the story, and that is how 
it should be--its level of not knowing puts a stirring air of uneasiness over 
the proceedings and its sorrowful characters.</P>
<P>Set in the mid-'70s in the upper-middle-class Michigan suburbs, the film is 
told largely from the points-of-view of four neighborhood boys who live right 
down the street from the home of the much-talked-about Lisbon family, headed 
by a passive father (James Woods) and a restricting, Catholic mother 
(Kathleen Turner). The fascination for the four boys is based largely on the 
five Lisbon sisters--13-year-old Cecilia (Hanna Hall), 14-year-old Lux 
(Kirsten Dunst), 15-year-old Bonnie (Chelsea Swain), 16-year-old Mary (A.J. 
Cook), and 17-year-old Therese (Leslie Hayman)--each of which signify 
unattainable beauty and innocence unchanged.</P>
<P>Narrated by one of the boys as an adult (Giovanni Ribisi), who occasionally 
still holds reunions with his childhood friends, where they theorize on the 
notable gaps missing in the lives of the late Lisbon sisters, the first words 
uttered at the film's start are, "Cecilia was the first to go," as we see her 
face-up in a bathtub of water, her wrists slit open. It is her first suicide 
attempt, and although she survives, questions of the parents' upbringing and 
what goes on behind their closed doors become headline news for television 
stations, ready to exploit the grim subject of teenage suicide. </P>
<P>Following her physical recovery, Cecilia is forced to see a psychiatrist 
(Danny DeVito), who doesn't have a clue how to help a 13-year-old girl 
fatally hurting internally. Weeks later, Cecilia attempts suicide again, and 
succeeds, impaling herself on the iron fence that surrounds their home. 
Heartbroken and confused, the father drifts into psychological seclusion, 
while the mother is bewildered to why her youngest daughter would do such a 
thing. </P>
<P>The Lisbon girls, who are only allowed to leave the house's property long 
enough to attend school, are severely sheltered, with the exception of the 
flirtatious, somewhat rebellious Lux. Soon, things return to normal in the 
Lisbon household, until Lux catches the eye of the popular, smooth, 
pot-smoking Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett). For both Trip and Lux, it is their 
first experience with teenage love, and for the first and last time, Trip 
convinces the Lisbon father, who is a math teacher at the high school, to 
allow himself and three other classmates to accompany the sisters to the 
upcoming Homecoming Dance. All does not remain happy for long, as something 
occurs between Trip and Lux that forever changes the lives of the entire 
Lisbon family, and questionably plays a part in the inexorable, 
heartbreakingly lyrical final act.</P>
<P>In her directing debut, 29-year-old Sofia Coppola (daughter of Francis Ford 
Coppola) has conceived of a motion picture filled with overwhelming intensity 
and remarkable conviction. In 1990, playing the ill-fated Mary Corleone in 
"The Godfather III," Coppola gave an embarrassing performance that, for some 
critics, nearly ruined the entire production. After seeing "The Virgin 
Suicides," it is clear that Coppola's destiny lies in her adeptness of, not 
acting, but filmmaking and screenwriting. Reportedly, Jeffrey Eugenides' 
novel is Coppola's favorite novel, and so in adapting it for the screen, she 
felt it was her responsibility to not only be faithful to the source 
material, but to do it complete justice. While the book remains unread by 
myself, the film can easily stand alone as a showcase for a rightfully 
burgeoning career for Sofia Coppola.</P>
<P>The actors--every one of them--perfectly embody their characters, and it is 
their subtle performances that give the film an added level of realism and 
unforced poignancy. Kirsten Dunst (1999's "Drop Dead Gorgeous") just keeps 
getting better with every role, and she brings the sexually charged Lux, who, 
despite her closeness with her siblings, seems to have been meant to be born 
into an entirely different family, to pulsating life. Her desperation to 
break out from the strict confines of her household are palpably felt without 
having to use dialogue to explain her longings, and it is a tribute to 
Dunst's talent that she could possibly pull off such a tricky provocation. </P>
<P>Of the rest of the Lisbon sisters, Hanna Hall (who played the young Jenny in 
1994's "Forrest Gump") makes the most lasting impression as Cecilia, the 
first to commit suicide. Although mostly absent following her suicide in the 
first half-hour, visions of her tragic soul are glimpsed throughout, and her 
sullen presence consistently hangs over all that follows.</P>
<P>As the sisters' parents, James Woods underplays to spectacular effect as the 
father, while Kathleen Turner, nabbing her first noteworthy role in years, is 
exceptional as the mother, who finally decides to take her four daughters out 
of school and keep them locked inside the house, cut off from all outside 
influences that she fears they are being brainwashed by. In one scene that 
rings mightily true, the mother forces Lux to burn all of her music records, 
all the while Lux tearfully begs her not to make her do such a thing.</P>
<P>Never even seeming like he is playing a character, Josh Hartnett (2000's 
"Here on Earth") is Trip Fontaine, the "oh-so-cool" Jim Morrison-lookalike 
who doesn't quite know how to react when, for once, he isn't the one being 
pined for, but rather becomes swept away himself by his crush on Lux. In only 
a few sequences, teenage first love is more accurately portrayed than in all 
of the previous teen movies of the last year combined. One particular scene, 
in which Lux and Trip sit next to each other in the darkened school 
auditorium and shyly flirt with the possibility of holding hands, is 
something that most anyone can relate to, yet is an almost always clumsily 
overlooked nuance about human nature that is bypassed in other similar films.</P>
<P>Aiding in capturing the '70s era is a soundtrack that is precisely on-target, 
including Heart's "Magic Man," Styx's "Come Sail Away," and Carole King's 
"Far Away," and the luminous music score by the French group Air, serves to 
strengthen the picture's already highly evocative tone.</P>
<P>The final ten minutes of "The Virgin Suicides" appear to be a collection of 
fragmented memories, told again by the neighborhood boys who still manage to 
keep in touch with the Lisbon sisters, even after they are closed in their 
home. The details are shady and purposefully disjointed, and the 
nightmarishly real action reaches a head when the boys finally are given a 
chance to come into face-to-face contact with their idealistic obsessions 
once again. </P>
<P>There are no easy answers presented in Sofia Coppola's "The Virgin Suicides." 
Twenty-five years later, following the deaths of all five of the Lisbon 
sisters, their impact in the lives of those admiring boys lives on, and the 
mystery surrounding what the driving force was in their pact to 
simultaneously end their lives is what gives the film added weight, as well 
as a lingering impression on the viewer. "The Virgin Suicides" is a 
devastating, haunting motion picture of inconceivable power.</P>
