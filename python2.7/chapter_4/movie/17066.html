<P>(author's note: this is the first review I've written since October 1998 when
I reviewed "Rush Hour." That was FIVE months ago... so if I'm a little rusty,
please bear with me.)</P>
<P>        Originality is something today's entertainment industry seems to be running
short on, so the new thinking seems to be "How many ideas can be recycled
without going overboard?" I think it's fair to say `Analyze This' is an
example of that thinking since its not exactly the most novel concept in the
world, but it still manages to be everything a good movie should be. Isn't
that the point of entertainment?</P>
<P>        The film's selling point is obviously its plot, its stars and the creative
forces behind it. We've seen a lot of crime movies starring Robert De Niro and
a lot of comedies starring Billy Crystal and of course veteran comic talent
Harold Ramis usually guarantees something good. But each's talent comes from a
different school... world even. Bringing big names together for the sake of it
is something Hollywood thrives on but doesn't necessarily succeed at (i.e.
`Heat'), so why should this movie be expected to work?</P>
<P>        Probably because everyone does what they do best, often stepping on the
other's toes just to upstage them and it works.</P>
<P>        The film tells the story of Dr. Ben Sobel (Crystal), a middle-aged
psychiatrist who lives and works in the ‘burbs of New York City, and his
forced encounter with mob boss Paul Vitti (De Niro). Vitti's your typical
Mafia guy in a typical Mafia scenario surrounded by other typical Mafia guys
in a typical conflict about typical `family' betrayal and rivalry. </P>
<P>        Ramis doesn't try too hard to disguise the obvious which is good because
otherwise the setting would immediately seem trite and cliched. He doesn't
waste our time by giving a lot of back story, instead we're just kind of
dropped in the middle of another `GoodFellas.' Within a few minutes or so
we've got an idea of a bitter war between Vitti and Primo Sindone (Chazz
Palminteri). There's some mention of some kind of big meeting coming up, which
does play a major role in the film, but Ramis and his fellow screenwriters
don't let it get too convoluted with the comedy.</P>
<P>        How Sobel and Vitti come together really isn't relevant, and it's another
obvious point the filmmakers know not to dwell on. What is relevant is the
interaction between the two characters, especially as portrayed by these two
fine actors.</P>
<P>        Both Crystal and De Niro are allowed to do their usual schticks for a while
and it's surprisingly effective. De Niro's Vitti is a bit more mature and calm
than those he's played in Martin Scorcese's films. Here, he gets to play a
`kinder, gentler' mobster with a bit of heart and soul (emphasis on `a bit').
After one of his elders is killed it actually saddens him, causing him to have
anxiety attacks, although he refuses to believe it despite medical evidence.</P>
<P>        Here's where the two come together and the initial confrontation is
interesting. Mobsters in the movies only believe what they want to hear and
people only tell them what they want to hear, so when Sobel begins telling
Vitti what his problems REALLY are, it's a breath of fresh air (or maybe I
should say nitrous oxide).</P>
<P>        The chemistry between the two is great. Both characters are secretly afraid
of each other despite their attempts to have macho facades. Vitti is afraid to
hear the truth and Sobel is just plain afraid of Vitti. The result is dozens
of funny scenes of each caricature trying to psych out the other. Imagine the
type of routine Crystal does at the Academy Awards interacting with a De Niro
character out of a Scorcese flick, except without the security of a blue
screen. Now image both men slightly possessed by Woody Allen - how funny is
that?</P>
<P>        Of course the whole film isn't just the two men freaking each other out. This
is a comedy about the mob so it definitely becomes the driving force of the
plot. In fact, the film's handling of the plot is one of its best aspects. It
plays its elements straight and realistic for the most part. If a mobster were
to suddenly become an integral part of a regular person's life, it probably
would have a huge effect of them. Since this is a comedy that effect is played
for laughs and always very well.</P>
<P>        Sobel is about to marry Laura MacNamara (Kudrow, in full `Phoebe
Buffay'-form), a Miami television journalist, but can't since Vitti and his
goons keep butting in. The goons, such as Jelly (Viterelli in a great
performance), are played strictly for laughs a la `The Simpsons.' The
atmosphere is enough to keep the satire cartoony enough for such a mainstream
film, but without going too far and becoming zany (okay, it is a little bit
zany but I liked it anyway).</P>
<P>        There's nothing genus or ground-breaking to `Analyze This,' but it never
really tries to be something it's not. Anyone can do a crime spoof or a fish-
out-of-water flick or violent crime movie, but not everyone can do all three
at once. That's what makes this film a fine investment of 103 minutes.</P>
