"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Films based on true stories are unique cinematic animals.  To begin
with, if the story is popular enough, viewers already know the ending
(like Titanic).  Even if the tale isn't particularly well-known, studios
can ruin a film's finale by having the main character appear on the talk
show circuit prior to release, so potential viewers will know he/she
doesn't die no matter how much adversity they face in the film  (like
The Hurricane).  And if you've got a problem with the film's story being
boring, can you really complain if it's based on actual events?  I felt
that way about The Perfect Storm and was besieged with e-mail from
people accusing me of not feeling sorry enough for the characters – like
my review was really damning the crew of the Andrea Gail and their
families instead of the film.</P>
<P>Men of Honor was cobbled together with the same cut-rate glue they used
to assemble The Perfect Storm.  While its central character isn't quite
as unlikable as the money-grubbers from the Andrea Gail, the film offers
precious little besides a formulaic story, phoned-in performances and
button-pushing racial issues calculated to cause white viewers to hang
their heads in shame as they drive their SUVs back to the suburbs.</P>
<P>Honor is about Carl Brashear, who is portrayed here by Cuba Gooding Jr.
(Chill Factor).  The film follows Brashear's life from his family's
Sonora, Kentucky dirt farm to a military career during which he became
the first black deep-sea diver in U.S. Navy history.  Of course, the
journey from Point A to Point B is full of adversity, mostly at the
hands of the racism Brashear encountered in the ‘60s Navy.  He starts
his career as a cook on the seas of the South Pacific, of all the
horrible things.</P>
<P>After finally clawing his way through two years of training in
casseroles and soufflés, Brashear lands at a New Jersey dive and salvage
school, which is run by redneck Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert De
Niro, Meet the Parents).  Sunday is a drunk with a corncob pipe (but,
sadly, no button nose) and has recently been assigned this training
position after severely damaging his lungs during a daring dive in the
Mediterranean.  He immediately takes a dislike to Brashear's hue and
makes him work 10 times harder than anybody else in the training
program.</P>
<P>The rest of Honor is pretty predictable (aside from a startling and
grisly injury to one of the characters).  We've already seen countless
films where two chest-thumping Alpha males butt heads, and it's not any
different here just because it's based on a true story.  Honor is slowed
down by obligatory romantic threads involving Brashear's Harlem
librarian  (Aunjanue Ellis, In Too Deep) and Sunday's strange
relationship with a beautiful woman played by Charlize Theron (who is
making her third feature film appearance in less than a month - The
Yards and Bagger Vance).</P>
<P>Honor was the writing debut of Scott Marshall Smith and was directed by
George Tillman Jr. (Soul Food).  The film features Gooding's best
performance since Jerry Maguire, but that's not really saying much if
you've seen what he's done lately.  The best and most exciting scene is
given away in the trailer.  It fails to inspire in nearly every way, but
does happen to be the second boat film this year to feature David Keith
(U-571).</P>
<P>1:20 – R for adult language and graphic violence</P>
