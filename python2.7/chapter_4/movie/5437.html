<P>     It's probably unfair to characterize THE PHANTOM as a BATMAN-
wannabe, since Lee Falk's comic book creation predated the Caped 
Crusader.  Nevertheless, as far as motion picture adaptations are 
concerned, Michael Keaton first stepped into his suit seven years before 
Paramount Pictures released this movie.  And, since both superheroes 
lack recognizable super powers and wear costumes, the connection is 
obvious.  It should be noted, however, that while Batman's form-fitting 
suit looks a lot more stylish than The Phantom's cheesy purple outfit, 
appearance isn't everything -- this film is more fun than Tim Burton's 
1989 atmosphere-soaked, empty-headed yarn.</P>
<P>     That's not to say that THE PHANTOM, directed by Simon Wincer (FREE 
WILLY), doesn't have atmosphere.  Actually, it's a nice-looking motion 
picture, with splashy colors highlighting nearly every scene.  But, 
unlike BATMAN, it doesn't hang everything on mood, and the tone isn't 
relentlessly downbeat.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  Since THE PHANTOM 
never takes anything seriously, the audience doesn't have to, either.  
This is the sort of tongue-in-cheek campiness that knows exactly what it 
is, and the irreverent tone saves this film from being another failed 
RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.</P>
<P>     In fact, the action sequences are among the least enjoyable parts 
of THE PHANTOM, since they're uniformly routine.  If you want action, 
see THE ROCK.  This film is for those who enjoy come-to-life comic books 
with self-consciously preposterous dialogue, over-the-top acting, silly 
plot contrivances, and a superhero who strikes all the right poses.  
It's not great cinema, but that doesn't stop it from being enjoyable in 
a B-movie way (and, unlike most films out there now, it's entirely 
suitable for children).</P>
<P>     For four-hundred years, the Phantom has haunted the Bengalla woods, 
known to the native inhabitants as "The Ghost Who Walks."  Kit Walker 
(Billy Zane) is the twenty-first man to take up the mantle, inheriting 
it from his late father (Patrick McGoohan), who makes occasional ghostly 
appearances to advise him.  It's the lot of the Walker family to "fight 
piracy, cruelty, and injustice in all its forms", and has been since the 
boy who became the first Phantom witnessed his father's murder.  Because 
all the Phantoms wear the same costume, the outside world believes that 
there's only one of them -- an immortal vigilante of sorts -- and Kit is 
in no hurry to dispel the illusion.</P>
<P>     The age-old enemy of the Phantom is the evil Sengh brotherhood, who 
are searching for the fabled Skulls of Touganda, a trio of artifacts 
that, when brought together, give the possessor great powers.  One New 
York businessman, Xander Drax (Treat Williams), wants those skulls for 
himself, so he sends his henchman, Quill (James Remar), into the jungles 
of Bengalla to retrieve one.  Quill and the Phantom have a history -- 
he's the one who stabbed Kit's father in the back.  Meanwhile, back in 
the Big Apple, a newspaper publisher and his daughter (Kristy Swanson) 
who suspect that Drax is up to no good run afoul of the megalomaniac 
when they start investigating his personal affairs.</P>
<P>     Billy Zane, who played the psycho in DEAD CALM, is an excellent 
choice for the lead role.  Zane adopts the right self-deprecating tone 
and has a well-toned body that fills out the skin-tight costume 
impressively.  He seems to be enjoying himself, which is important for 
this sort of part.  Kristy Swanson (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER) slides 
into the love interest role with gusto, showing enough spunk to avoid 
fading into the background.  Catherine Zeta Jones plays an exotic, 
athletic bad girl.  The villains are Treat Williams, who has as much fun 
here as Jack Nicholson did in BATMAN, and James Remar.</P>
<P>     Although THE PHANTOM is more often enjoyable than not, it lacks 
that special characteristic necessary to provide it with a unique 
identity.  Arriving in the midst of so many "can't miss" offerings, I 
expect it to sink like a rock, moving quickly to "dollar theaters" then 
to video. I'd like to be able to champion this film, but the truth is 
that I'm tiring of the genre as a whole, and, while THE PHANTOM opts for 
a different tone than most of its brethren, it's still not an especially 
memorable motion picture.  This is the kind of movie that offers modest 
entertainment while you're in the theater, but is forgotten by the time 
you get home.  </P>
