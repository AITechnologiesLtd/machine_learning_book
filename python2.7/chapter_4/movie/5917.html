<P>     When faced with watching a movie that is so utterly uninteresting
and entirely uninvolving, what is the sane person to do?  Well, you can
yawn and stretch and scratch your parts and read your watch and, if
you're lucky enough to be armed with a notepad, translate your miseries
into hand-written musings.  The torture doesn't end, though, until you
leave the theater, which is exactly what I wish I'd done during THE
SPITFIRE GRILL.  This butt-numbing tear-jerker stars newcomer Alison
Elliott (THE UNDERNEATH) as a stranger in a small Maine town, recently
released from prison and now working at a local diner.  Her alien
presence-- or is it her seeming aversion to shampoo?-- sets the entire
town on its ear, which then gives the Crusty Diner Owner Widow Mother
with the Bad Back (Ellen Burstyn) a chance to start sticking up for her.
Yawn.  This one won an award at the Sundance Film Festival and, frankly,
I'd like to know what they were smoking.  The hazy lighting, suffocating
score, dueling accents, eye-rolling monologues, and story surprises that
you can see coming from a mile off were all too much for me.  But what
do I know?  The audience that I saw this with cried, clapped, and, in
later scenes, cheerfully talked back to the screen.  You go girls.</P>
