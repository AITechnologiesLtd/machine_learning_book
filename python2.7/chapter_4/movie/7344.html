<P>     8 HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG definitely isn't for everyone.  But if you 
have a twisted sense of humor and can see the comedy in films like 
WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S, this movie is right up your alley.  For my part, 
while I wasn't overly impressed by significant chunks of the movie, 
there were times when I was nearly doubled over with laughter.  8 HEADS 
IN A DUFFEL BAG works very much like a series of skits cobbled together 
into a movie -- some of them work, some don't.  When they fail, they're 
painful to watch.  But when they succeed, they can be hilarious.   </P>
<P>     Not surprisingly, the most interesting performer in the film is 
lead actor Joe Pesci.  In the midst of all the madcap zaniness, Pesci 
plays his role mostly straight -- a weary hitman who just wants to 
complete one last job so he can retire.  Some of 8 HEADS' best moments 
come as a result of Pesci's even-handed approach to the material.  In 
fact, the movie's comic momentum has a tendency to flag whenever he's 
off-screen for more than a few minutes. </P>
<P>     Pesci's Tommy Spinelli is charged by mob boss Big Sep (Howard 
George) to transport the heads of eight dead men from New Jersey to San 
Diego.  Tommy's trouble starts on the airplane, when he's forced to 
check his bag because it's too large to be carried on.  Then, in 
California, there's a mix-up between his luggage and that of college 
student Charlie Pritchett (Andy Comeau), who's on the West Coast to 
vacation with his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) and her parents (George 
Hamilton and Dyan Cannon).  Charlie ends up with Tommy's eight heads and 
Tommy gets a bag full of clothes.  What follows is a series of offbeat 
misadventures as Tommy attempts to retrieve his duffel bag while Charlie 
tries to get rid of it. </P>
<P>     A lot of the humor in 8 HEADS is expectedly lowbrow and grotesque, 
but there are some truly inspired moments.  In a scene that recalls the 
work of the late English director Dennis Potter (PENNIES FROM HEAVEN, 
THE SINGING DETECTIVE), the heads starting singing "Mr. Sandman" while 
their decapitated bodies dance around.  Tommy also has a solution for a 
foul-mouthed old lady (Ernestine Mercer) that may remind a few people of 
THROW MAMA FROM THE TRAIN.  Writer/first-time director Tom Schulman 
(who, curiously enough, penned DEAD POETS' SOCIETY) clearly knows how to 
use macabre circumstances to get a laugh, although by the last reel he 
has become repetitive.  </P>
<P>     While this is ultimately Pesci's film, there is a fairly sizable 
supporting cast.  Newcomer Andy Comeau does a nice job making Charlie 
seem both likable and inept.  George Hamilton, Dyan Cannon, and Kristy 
Swanson all have their moments, but, in general, their work here is 
largely forgettable.  Todd Louiso and the ever-irritating David Spade 
have roles as a pair of college students whom Tommy kidnaps and tortures 
to learn Charlie's whereabouts.  While Louiso's interaction with the 
heads is worth at least a chuckle, Spade is constantly more annoying 
than funny.   </P>
<P>     8 HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG offers humor of the most irreverent, and 
sometimes downright disgusting, sort.  As a result, it belongs in the 
same group as films like THE MONSTER and CEMETERY MAN, neither of which 
could be described as examples of sophisticated taste.  And, while this 
particular entry is not really a "good" film in the traditional sense, 
it's hard to make it all the way through without laughing your head off 
at least once. </P>
