<P>     I've heard it called "JAWS with claws" and that's a fair summation
of the plot, though that tag line does little to quantify quality.
Director Stephen Hopkins (BLOWN AWAY, PREDATOR 2) and screenwriter
William Goldman (MAVERICK, MISERY) would have you believe that this is
an epic historical drama about man against nature, based on what really
happened in Africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to
the 20th Century.  They've stacked the deck with two big stars (Val
Kilmer, Michael Douglas), a bigger production design, beautiful
photography (by Academy Award winner Vilmos Zsigmond), and a score so
overblown that it makes THE LION KING soundtrack sound like chamber
music.  The movie doesn't make a lick of sense, though, either as an
epic or as your basic boo-fest.  In fact, some of the bits are so
laughably ludicrous that you may think you've stumbled into the sequel
to MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000: THE MOVIE.  How about the three guys
with rifles, who trap a lion and then can't even hit the damned thing?
Or the ham-on-wry acting of Michael Douglas, who chews more scenery than
the animals ever do??  Or, my favorite, lions so agile that they can
even climb onto rooftops?!?  </P>
