Reviewed August 7, 1999.</P>
<P>And the winner of the second creepiest film of the year (after "The Blair 
Witch Project") goes to director M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense." To 
say that the picture is merely "creepy," however, is not giving it nearly as 
much credit as it deserves, as it is that special type of gem that quietly, 
and gradually, sneaks up on you so that you are immediately absorbed into the 
story and characters, but still question throughout where everything could 
possibly be leading. Predict all you want, but it is virtually impossible to 
figure out the ending before it comes, and even though it's right out of left 
field, I hasten to say that it is not used as a gimmick, sort of like 1995's 
"The Usual Suspects." No, the conclusion to "The Sixth Sense" is very 
different, for in one ingeniously simple scene every single plot hole is 
thoroughly patched up, and the film, with that vital turn of the switch, 
gracefully moves right out of being merely a 'psychological thriller,' and 
becomes something far more profound and ruminant that anyone could possibly 
have anticipated when the opening credits began 113 minutes earlier. </P>
<P>After a stirring prologue in which psychiatrist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce 
Willis) and his wife, Anna (Olivia Williams), get paid a visit by one of his 
past patients which ends with Malcolm getting shot and the patient committing 
suicide, the film switches to "The Next Fall," as Malcolm has recovered from 
his injury but whose relationship with Anna has turned into a distant one in 
which they don't even speak to each other anymore. Dr. Malcolm's current 
patient is 9-year-old Cole (Haley Joel Osment), a quiet loner of a boy living 
with his hard-working single mother (Toni Collette), who is expected to have 
a behavioral disorder. Cole tells him right away that he seems like a nice 
doctor, but one that can't help him, for this deep, dark, and terrifying 
secret that he is hiding is not known by anyone but himself. So what is the 
secret? Although this revelation is discovered midway through, the trailers 
for the film foolishly give it away, but in respect for those that have been 
fortunate enough not to see them, I will not reveal it. As for those who have 
seen the ads, well, you already know the "secret" and therefore, I don't have 
to give it away for you, either.</P>
<P>The recent releases of "The Blair Witch Project" and "The Sixth Sense" 
couldn't have come at a more opportune time, because both films visually show 
very little of the actual horrific things terrifying the characters, which 
does nothing but add a deep intelligence and eerie effectiveness that 
probably would have been lost in a special-effects extravaganza. Just look at 
Jan De Bont's piss-poor remake of "The Haunting," a $75-million film which 
left nothing to the imagination and, coincidentally, did not have one 
frightening moment in the whole movie. The "less-is-more" theory appears to 
be becoming a tradition recently, and it's a tradition I'd like to see 
continue if these two marvelous films are any indication. Shyamalan is wisely 
very discreet in his storytelling approach to "The Sixth Sense," and the film 
never rushes along to the next scene for the insulting reason of keeping the 
audience awake. If every scene isn't action-packed, that is perfectly fine, 
as the movie progressively draws you into the proceedings as if you were 
reading an intriguing book, so that when a fleeting moment of visual horror 
is seen, it is all the more unexpected and emotionally stirring. </P>
<P>The highly important role of the child was, no doubt, a tricky part to cast 
because having a sickeningly precocious kid actor who mugs for the camera at 
every opportunity possible would have ruined the whole film. 11-year-old 
Haley Joel Osment (1996's "Bogus") is different, and thankfully so. Simply 
put, Osment is a real actor, one that, with every line of dialogue and 
memorable facial expression, is wholly believable and sympathetic without 
being overly 'cute.' Incredible and unassured, Osment is perfect in relaying 
his character of Cole's personal confusion and terror at the things he is 
able to see. It is the best performance from a child I've seen since 
3-year-old Victoire Thivisol in 1997's "Ponette." </P>
<P>Because Osment is so very good, the "star" and veteran of the cast, Bruce 
Willis, is unable to hold his own ground as firmly as if a more accomplished 
actor had been playing this same role. Willis has to be given a round of 
applause for choosing this one-of-a-kind film project, which is far better 
than anything else he has been in since 1994's "Pulp Fiction," but there is 
something about Willis' face that keeps him from selling most of his 
characters. Seemingly always smirking as if he is in on the "joke," kind of 
like Adam Sandler, Willis recites some of the dialogue in his "ultra-serious" 
mode, which usually causes him to not fully sell his lines. Still, Willis is 
not, I repeat not, bad in the film, and this somewhat negative reaction 
probably stems more from the brilliance of Osment than from Willis' own 
acting talents.</P>
<P>Right next to Osment on the performance scale is Toni Collette (1995's 
"Muriel's Wedding," 1998's "Clockwatchers"), a prodigious, versatile actress 
who is remarkably poignant and compassionate as Cole's frustrated, caring 
mother. Also of interest is Olivia Williams (1998's "Rushmore"), as Willis' 
long-suffering wife. The role is underwritten and doesn't give her enough to 
do to equal what she is capable of, but intently watch Williams when she is 
on-screen and you will see that the subtle expressions on her face speak 
volumes over spoken words. </P>
<P>When it all comes down to it, "The Sixth Sense" is a film that shines the 
spotlight brightly on the two main characters, Cole and Dr. Malcolm, and that 
is the rightful centerpiece in which everything else revolves around. 
Amazing, too, how the ending has the sheer power to completely blindside you 
when the final, ultimate twist occurs. This whole review, I know, has been 
fairly vague in description, but that is how it should be. "The Sixth Sense" 
is a genuine experience--genuinely scary, genuinely touching, and genuinely 
thought-provoking--so much so that it is one of those special films released 
in the confines of Hollywood that somehow squeezed through the cracks to 
present an audience with several truly original ideas. Surprisingly, a late 
scene between Cole and his mother may even bring you to tears (it came very 
close for me), the emotions of which come refreshingly from the honesty of 
the situation, rather than from syrupy melodrama. And the real kicker of it 
all is, it turns out "The Sixth Sense" isn't really a typical horror movie at 
all, but actually a contemplative, thoughtful look at the process of life. </P>
