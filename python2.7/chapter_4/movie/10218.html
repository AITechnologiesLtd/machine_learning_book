Titanic **** out of four.</PRE>
<P>There's a moment in Titanic that illustrates what James Cameron is trying
to create with his giant epic.  It's not a special effect or a computer
animation or an explosion of any sort.  It's a simple scene:  Jack Dawson
(amazingly played by Leonardo DiCaprio) sits and draws Rose DeWinter (Kate
Winslett).  It's amazing because you actually believe that Dicapprio is
trying in earnest to create a portrait of Winslett.  His love for her is so
grand, that he only wants to create a picture that illustrates his love. 
It has to be perfect, you can see it his eyes.  It's a great moment
between the actors in a movie that could have so easily ignored them and gone
out to be a big budget disaster movie.  Cameron isn't after a disaster film
or gimmicky effects, he's after an emotion that he wants from his
audience: sympathy, maybe even tears.  He wants you to cry at the tragedy of the
sinking Titanic.  And in this movie, we do.  </P>
<P>Does Titanic live up to the hype?  I think it's better than the hype; It
is one of the best movies of the year.  A gigantic sprawling masterpiece
from James Cameron, who emerges as one the two or three best director of
epic movies of our time.  Here he has created a movie that is not only
amazing to look at, but amazing to feel and to be a part of.  As a friend of
mine said after the show, "I need a box of Kleenex."  </P>
<P>A lot of people have criticized the love story between Winslet and
DiCaprio, but I think that's what makes the film so good.  Unlike other films
that rely on special effects, Titanic is centered around a beautifully told
story.  The doomed ship is merely the backdrop that makes the story so
powerful.  Kind of a supporting character (a $200 million supporting
character) rather than at the fore front.</P>
<P>With big budget movies these days, there is no story.  It's all just an
excuse for special effects (Starship Troopers, Con Air, The Lost World,
Spawn, Batman and Robin, etc...) Titanic, however, is so much more. 
Cameron's use of story telling, letting us know how the boat will sink so that we
can watch for it at the end was brilliant.  From that point on, we forget
about the sinking and concentrate on the story.  After all, you know the
boat will sink.  In the meantime, we get to see some of the most beautiful
cinematography that I have seen in 10 years.  Yes, it is three hours, but
you don't notice it.  Instead, I was absorbed with the show that Cameron
puts in front of you.  It's grand entertainment; a documentary, a love
story and an adventure rolled into a movie that's bigger than life.</P>
<P>I don't know if Titanic will earn back the money it spent, but it
deserves to.  I think we need to praise Hollywood and Cameron for going out on
the line and making a big budget movie with a heart and characters that we
care about.  When people are dying at the end, we feel bad because they
somehow seem real.  We relate to them; we wonder if we would act like them as
they struggle to live.  </P>
<P>I think what makes it so good is that you feel like you're part of an
event.  Thirty or fourty years from now Titanic might be on TV (or whatever
we have as an equivalent by then) and we can tell our kids, "I was there
when that movie opened. I got to watch that in the theaters."  It's the kind
of epic that transcends generations and will probably be remembered for a
long time.  </P>
