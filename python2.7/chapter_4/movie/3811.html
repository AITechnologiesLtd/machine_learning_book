<PRE>                                  SPECIES
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Why throw so much acting and
          expensive special effects at a project with such a
          weak and poorly thought-out screenplay?  A shape-
          changing were-alien stalks singles clubs for mating
          stock while a team of drafted civilians tries to
          track her down.  It has violence, a lot of sex,
          nudity, and little to think about afterwards.
          Rating: -1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Two years ago Ben Kingsley played in what is arguably one of the
best films ever made.  It is hard to imagine the same actor now taking
a role as an amoral scientist who helps to create what turns out to be
a shape-changing were-alien who cruises singles bars in Los Angeles.
And he is not the only good actor in the film, SPECIES also features
Forest Whitaker and Alfred Molina.  That is a lot of acting talent
marshalled to film a really disappointing script from Dennis Feldman
which borrows from a lot of other sources but more than a little from
the TV play and book A FOR ANDROMEDA by Fred Hoyle.  Feldman's
screenplays--notably GOLDEN CHILD--usually start with good concepts,
but he does not know what to do with them.</P>
<P>     Since the 1970s we have been broadcasting into space signals about
ourselves including some rudimentary information about our biological
makeup.  That much is based on fact, though the information we give
about DNA is as true of a garden slug as it is of a human, so it is not
a lot of information about ourselves.  This film says that we have been
sending a biological blueprint of humans and have been receiving
similar messages back for two years including a biological blueprint
for an alien race.  (That limits the source to the Centauri system,
Barnard's Star, Wolf 359, HD95735, Sirius, UV Ceti, and Ross 154,
incidentally.)  The government has had Dr. Xavier Fitch (played by
Kingsley) build the DNA specified in the message and combine it with
human DNA.  The scientific absurdities then come thick and fast.  The
resulting creature is neither non-viable nor even a crossbreed, but
rather a shape-shifter that can appear to be either a beautiful woman
or one of several ugly alien forms.  The timing is not right for the
twenty-ish were-alien to have matured so we are told that she developed
in a mere six months (reminiscent of the film EMBRYO).  The six months
were enough to bring her to the apparent age of a teenager.  Then she
goes on an eating binge and spins a cocoon only to emerge an adult.
(Incidentally, even the binge does not seem sufficient to provide the
mass needed to build the cocoon.)  The resulting adult (former model
Natasha Henstridge) seems to be both beautiful and an incredibly quick
study at learning how to fit into our society.  It is never clear how
Sil, as she is called--first as "the Sil" and then just as "Sil"--knows
all she does about our society, but she seems to have absorbed the
knowledge someplace.  Meanwhile a task force of private citizens is
drafted by the government to track down the were-alien.  The team
includes some sort of exterminator (Michael Madsen) whom the government
has used before for top secret missions.  And also included is a
psychic empath--as if the government has a ready stock on call.  So
much is left unexplained that while some films call for a sequel or a
prequel, this one could handily use an inquel.</P>
<P>     Director Roger Donaldson has spiced up the film with more than its
share of action and thrills, but all too often the action takes the
form of a chase like any film with a more human quarry.  Or the action
might be someone being skewered through the walls of a restroom.  Then
to add a thrill or two there are false jump scenes thrown in.  I will
not spoil even the false jumps, but one involves a ridiculously
unrealistic piece of animal behavior.</P>
<P>     Kingsley and Whitaker are each too professional to turn in
performances that are not good, but Donaldson must not have been a very
demanding director and nobody else is particularly noticeable.  Oddly
this includes Alfredo Molina who probably would have done more with his
role had it been possible.  The script fails to develop the characters
much at all beyond throwing in a little romance among a lot of sex and
nudity.</P>
<P>     While the design of the alien creature is by H. R. Giger, the
surreal artist who is best known as the designer of the creature in
ALIEN, most looks at the alien creature take place in dreamlike
sequences.  Toward the end we actually see it, but it is a
disappointment.</P>
<P>     While this film could have been an effective exploration of two
species in conflict, too often the script takes an easy and familiar
path rather than explore new science fictional territory.  The
absurdities might have been acceptable with more originality, but what
this film offers is just not what I am looking for in a science fiction
film.  I give this one -1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
