<PRE>                             MR. NICE GUY
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: As usual there is more stunt than
          story to Chan's latest adventure.  That approach
          plays to Jackie Chan's strength: having the
          greatest attention lavished on the stunts while the
          plot is more an afterthought. The characters are
          thin, the story is stale and familiar, but the
          audience is entertained.  However, once again Chan
          injured himself in the making of the film and he
          uses machinery rather than his own skill in the
          final battle.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It is difficult to evaluate a Jackie Chan film like one evaluates
other films.  Was the plot any good?  Well no, it was pretty lame
actually.  Was the acting any good?  Well, no, that was not so hot
either.  Chan has a lot of personality--more so than just about any of
the martial artists who regularly star in films--but that is not the
same thing as acting.  Acting has to do with giving the viewer insights
deep into a type of personality or it can be just playing a certain
type of person very authentically.  However, there is nothing very deep
about the personalities Chan plays.  And since I doubt there is anyone
really like a Chan character, the whole question of whether he is doing
a good job of acting is moot.  Does a Chan film have good
cinematography?  Well, it probably is no easy task to keep in the frame
of the camera a moving target like Chan.  And there is some okay
location scenery of (in this case) Melbourne, Australia.  But it hardly
is what anyone would consider good camerawork.  All of what one thinks
of as the usual virtues of a movie do not apply to a Jackie Chan film
besides the general fact that it is entertaining.</P>
<P>     The virtues of a Jackie Chan film are not those of a film, they
are the virtues of a circus performance.  Are there fabulous stunts in
the film?  Is it impressive that a human being can do what his
character does?  Are the movements smooth and graceful and well staged?
There are the virtues one expects of more from Ringling Brothers than
from Warner Brothers.  I am sure when a new Chan film is being
considered choosing the stunts is the first order of business.  Then a
minimal story is written to tie the stunts together.</P>
<P>     In this outing Chan plays a chef on Melbourne television.  The
irony of having a martial artist in such a delicate profession as
cooking is already familiar from the UNDER SIEGE films.  In any case
Jackie seem equally adept at delivering a well-done karate chop and a
well-done lamb chop.  After a cooking show broadcast one day Jackie is
returning to his car when he sees a damsel in distress being chased by
thugs.  He jumps in and saves the woman and quicker than a three-minute
egg he finds himself in the middle of a three- way war between two
rival gangs and the police.  There is a plot with a missing
incriminating videotape and some unexplained detective work by the
baddies who have an uncanny ability to find Chan and the people under
his protection wherever they hide.  After several confrontations Chan
gets angry enough and brings his enemies to a crushing defeat.</P>
<P>     The story is pretty basic stuff, but does anyone REALLY care about
the plot?  Chan fans probably want to know what kinds of action scenes
there are and what kinds of props does Chan use.  The centerpiece is
probably a sequence with a horse carriage.  There are some sequences
with power tools including that old standard of villainous menace, the
buzz saw.  And at one point Jackie takes on a giant earth-moving
machine.  There is a comic bit in a building under construction that
has only walls and doors.</P>
<P>     Some people were disappointed with the conclusion of Chan's RUMBLE
IN THE BRONX. Instead of having a climactic martial arts battle, Chan
let a hovercraft do the fighting for him.  That history repeats itself
for MR. NICE GUY.  Reportedly Chan suffered a neck injury in the
shooting.  Again the audience does not get the final fight between Chan
and villain and a convenient vehicle does the real fighting for Chan.
Perhaps Jackie Chan is nearing the end of his run and is discovering he
can no longer take the risks he has in the past.  Time is catching up
with him.</P>
<P>     A film like this deserves multiple ratings.  The stunts are
enjoyable to watch and little else really matters to someone who would
come to see a Jackie Chan film.  The film is pretty much
interchangeable with any other Jackie Chan film.  For those who like
this sort of thing, go for it.  I give MR. NICE GUY a 6 on the 0 to 10
scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
