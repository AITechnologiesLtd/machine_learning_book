<P>Retelling the classic story of Joan of Arc has been a popular trend this
year. Earlier this May, Leelee Sobieski played the passionate title role
in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on CBS. And now, director Luc
Besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage
girl supposedly sent by God to rescue France from the clutches of their
enemies. Starring Milla Jovovich, who is predominantly unconvincing as
the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch, `The Messenger: The
Story of Joan of Arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical
re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the
famous legend.</P>
<P>Besson (who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `The Fifth
Element') perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife Jovovich,
because in `The Messenger', the actress
is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience. At first, when reports
were indicating that Jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role,
I was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of
such a caliber. After seeing the rousing trailer, my
hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - Milla Jovovich looked superb.
With the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance, `The Messenger'
looked like a timeless epic in the making.</P>
<P>A timeless epic it is not. Besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and
flashy style, and the
story behind `The Messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands. On
the shoulders of
Besson's choppy and unexciting direction, the film dissipates into an
uninspiring
hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery.
There is no human exploration into the character of Joan (or Jeanne).
Jovovich merely rambles on about the
power of God when we have little or no insight into her visionary
objective. Jovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the
realization that Besson sees Jeanne as a piece
of spiritual cardboard. She is just another special effect in this
continuous visual feast.</P>
<P>Jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power, but mainly,
she looks lost. Quite frankly, I don't know of any actress who could
successfully navigate her way through `The Messenger' without a major
fumble. The script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate
comedy, as Jeanne confronts the uncrowned King Charles VII (John
Malkovich) and informs him of her heavenly intentions. Faye Dunaway
plays Charles' overbearing mother-in-law, and Dustin Hoffman appears
over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ‘The Conscience'.
All three actors juggle limited screen time, although Malkovich is
uncharacteristically awful.</P>
<P>The battle scenes are extremely bloody, but with the presence of such
jittery camera work, they capture none of the excitement or finesse of
something like `Braveheart'. There's a particularly graphic and
unsettling scene early on, when Jeanne (as a young girl) watches in
horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely
raped by a bloodthirsty English soldier. Even his fellow troopers are
petrified.</P>
<P>`The Messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story.
Almost too 90's, it seems. There's gratuitous use of the f-word and a
barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts!' sprinkled throughout the
screenplay. I was half-expecting Jeanne to invite her homeys to come
chill in her crib, but it never happened. There's also the familiar
presence of bizarre Besson humor, but none of it comes even remotely
close to functioning properly. It seems terribly misplaced, but in a
catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `The Messenger', almost
everything does.</P>
<P>The musical score by Erric Serra is spectacular, and the set and
production designs are continuously impressive. If it was visual
excellence that Besson was striving for, then he achieves his goal. But
the only time the dramatics come alive in `The Messenger' is during the
closing trial, in which Jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake.
During these moments, the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of
Joan of Arc reaches the audience, albeit in a faint stream of light that
provokes little power or meaning. It's just too delayed for Besson to
revive his lifeless interpretation, in which he is always concerned with
the wrong aspects.</P>
<P>`The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome
historical addition to the Hollywood shelf. Anyone searching for an
entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and
confusing film. Despite my original hopefulness, Milla Jovovich is not
going to have to worry about thanking the Academy.</P>
