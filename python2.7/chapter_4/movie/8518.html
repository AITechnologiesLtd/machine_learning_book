<PRE>THE RELIC (1997)
A film review by Nick Schaden
Copyright 1997 Nick Schaden</PRE>
<P>What is with the horror/thriller genre of today?   Either we have
movies that try to spoof horror (i.e. "Scream") with moderately
enjoyable results, or the countless number of movies that actually try
to freak us out, with for the most part, far too predictable and almost
laughable results.  "The Relic" throws us an interesting plot and pretty
sweet special effects - big potential.   However, by the end of the
movie, all the glory that "The Relic" tries to achieve nose dives.</P>
<P>The plot of "The Relic" (contrary to all the scientific mumbo jumbo you
hear throughout the movie) is rather simple:  A mutated monster that
kills humans to stay alive has been accidentally sent to the Field
Museum in Chicago with disastrous results.   An attractive evolutionary
biologist (Penelope Ann Miller) and a veteran homicide cop (Tom
Sizemore) both work apart, then together to stop and destroy this
monster.   The plot actually stays intact pretty well for a horror
flick, and I enjoyed it, it was quite original.   To boot, the
"scariness" of the movie starts slow and picks up speed gradually, with
satisfying results.   In addition, a few of the "nail biting" hooks work
relatively well, and the cinematography does these sparse scenes
justice.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, about halfway through the movie when the tension really
heats up, the movie tanks.   First problem: the acting.   Penelope Ann
Miller turns suddenly from a good role as bad boy biologist into yet
another stereotyped "woman-victim", meaning she spends the rest of the
movie screaming and running in high heels and a tight black dress.   The
other star, Tom Sizemore hits rock bottom too.   Sizemore starts as the
hard-boiled cop he seems to play well in many movies (i.e. "True
Romance") but soon goes WAY over the top, reduced to doing little but
barking orders and using the "f" word a lot.   Second problem: the
people in the movie are just too stupid.   Naturally, when all hell
breaks loose nobody except Ann Miller and Sizemore have any strategy,
the people just run around and become puppy chow for the monster.  Even
the two stars don't exactly have a winning formula: Instead of just
trying to escape right away from the museum, they decide that "this
f**king thing has to be DESTROYED first" and spend much of the movie
trying to find the origin of this monster.   It all seemed quite trivial
to me, just a pretty lame plot excuse to have some more "near-miss"
thriller scenes.   Last problem:  The ending. After what seemed to be a
very confusing and overblown "special effects extravaganza" final
showdown, in what seems a matter of seconds the entire movie wraps
itself up far too quickly.</P>
<P>In the end, "The Relic" seemed like a horror/thriller movie almost
ready to crack out of its shell, but unfortunately became another
heavily flawed flick that dies half way out of the starting gate.</P>
<PRE>Nick's Rating: -2</PRE>
<P>*** Movies rated from -4 (worst) to +4 (best), 0 = average movie ***</P>
