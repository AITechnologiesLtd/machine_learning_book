<PRE>                     ESCAPE FROM THE LIBERTY CINEMA
                       A film review by Alan Jay
                        Copyright 1991 Alan Jay</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Wojciech Marczewski
Leading Players: Janusz Gajos, Zbigniew Zamachowski
Poland 1990
Shown at the 35th London Film Festival.</PRE>
<P>Capsule:  This film is about a censor and a film where the actors decide
to take their life into their own hands.  (+0.5)</P>
<P>     ESCAPE FROM THE LIBERTY CINEMA centres around a provincial Polish
censor and the problems that happen when the actors in a film playing in
the "Liberty" Cinema decide they can't take it any more and go on
strike.  The film plays homage to Woody Allen's PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO
and even includes an excerpt from it.</P>
<P>     The film is an odd mix a comedy about a serious subject that varies
from being truly hilarious to very serious.  This means that the film
is, in my opinion, not quite walking the tightrope perfectly but making
a good attempt.</P>
<P>     The film includes some scenes from THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO which
Woody Allen arranged to have provided royalty free after seeing the
script.  This segment where the senior Party officials are called in to
sort out the problem is one of the best in the film as it shows how
farcical the whole thing has become.</P>
<P>     I'm not sure that I would recommend this film to my friends but it
makes its points sufficiently well that I do not feel that I wasted my
time seeing it.</P>
