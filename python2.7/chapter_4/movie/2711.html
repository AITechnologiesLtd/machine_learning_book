<P>     No amount of nostalgia can bring back the past, but, oh, how
TROUBLE tries.  Spousal scribes Charles and Nancy Shyer--who remade
FATHER OF THE BRIDE in 1991--have returned to reinvent the screwball
comedy.</P>
<P>     Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts play rival Chicago reporters.  He's a
veteran columnist, she's a cub reporter.  They meet at the scene of a
train derailment--a fitting metaphor for their first impressions. (He
hates her guts, she thinks he's a sleaze.)  They sniff around the
wreckage, scoop each other's story, and, finally, pool their resources
to work as a team.  That is, a team that happens to file separately.</P>
<P>     Rival reporting is a tried-and-true Hollywood tradition and, in
the beginning, the film has the feel of one of those great, old
newspaper classics like THE FRONT PAGE.  Somewhere around the hour
mark, though, TROUBLE transforms into a thriller, complete with bodies,
bullets, and half-baked McGuffins.  Which is too bad, because the
plot--some nonsense about missing microfiche--shoots the film in the
foot.</P>
<P>     Nolte and Roberts have more chemistry than the film deserves, but
not enough to keep viewers awake through the sitcom situations that the
characters wind up in.  The script's lack of snappy patter doesn't help
much, either.</P>
<P>     (The age discrepancy is almost worth noting, until you remember
that Nolte and Roberts are the same age as when Tracy and Hepburn
were doing the same thing.)</P>
<P>     Technical credits are surprisingly superb.  Charles Shyer's
direction, Dean Tavoularis' production design, and John Lindley's
lensing are all worth watching.  If nothing else, I LOVE TROUBLE is one
of the better-*looking* films of the summer.</P>
