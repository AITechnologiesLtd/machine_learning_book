<P>NENETTE ET BONI
 By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Strand Releasing
 Director:  Claire Denis
 Writer:  Claire Denis
 Cast: Gregoire Colin, Jacques Nolot, Alice Houri, Valeria
Bruni-Tedeschi
   Nenette et Boni takes place in Marseilles but as the film
progresses, that French seaport town looks more like
Metaphor City.  Winner of the 1996 Locarno Film Festival
Best Film award, this movie is nothing if not original: though
its dysfunctional family theme has been dramatized in
thousands of narratives, from Agamemnon, Medea and
Lysistrata through Hamlet and The Myth of Fingerprints,
director Claire Denis has forsaken narrative structure for a
particularly elliptical method of telling her story.  Particularly
inviting is her way of letting her principal character slip into
fantasies and dream sequences without giving the audience
much of a clue as to which is reality and which is the illusion.  
  But all this structural technique takes a back seat to the
film's hub, which is the particular bond felt between the title
characters, who are brother and sister.  Denis seems to say
throughout that there is something quite special about this
attachment, a link not as closely associated with that between
parent and child or an individual and his friends.  Brothers
and sisters may argue and become distant, suffer episodes of
envy and hate; but they are the same flesh and blood.  As
Ms. Denis stated in an interview, "We don't know the bodies
of our parents as we know those of our brothers and
sisters....We were fed with the same milk, something creates
a tie."
   Cinematographer Agnes Godard's camera focuses most of
the time on 18-year-old Boni (Gregoire Colin), who, in an
opening sequence fires his BB gun at his neighbor's cat.  But
he is a good lad, one who takes loving care of his adorable
white bunny.   A school dropout, he spends time in a pizza
wagon when he "feels like working," but Boni, who like his
sister Nenette despises his father, has a fantasy life that
would be the envy of Walter Mitty.  When he kneads the pizza
dough, it is obvious to the audience that he is metaphorically
caressing a woman's breast.  When he gazes tenderly at a
brioche, he is likewise thinking of a bosom.  Boni has wet
dreams particularly of a woman (Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi), the
alluring and happy wife of an American baker (played
humorously by the American actor, Vincent Gallo).  We often
are not sure whether his relationship with her is part of his
fancy or is reality, particularly in a scene in which she has
invited him for coffee and he is strangely passive.
   The core of Claire Denis's movie is the affinity between
Nenette and Boni, each possessing what the other is lacking. 
Boni is tragically lonely, seeking connection though his
dreams.  He needs someone to fill the space.  His 15-year-old
sister Nenette, by contrast, is burdened with the last thing she
wants: she is seven months' pregnant, too late to abort, and
utterly indifferent to the baby when the birth takes place.  
   The chemistry between brother and sister is the high point
of this drama.  Gregoire Colin is perhaps known to the
American art-house crowd from his role in "Queen Margot"
and has appeared in a number of French films with limited or
no exposure in the States.  Throughout the moments of
friction between him and his sister, played by the Alice Houri
(who has had relatively little exposure in film), the audience
senses the love that flows beneath the surface, a fondness
that reaches its peak when Boni rescues Nenette from a
particularly silly attempt at home-made abortion.  
   "Nenette and Boni" is likely to be off-putting to those who
believe that cinema, as opposed to theater, is a realistic
medium.  Denis takes her time to develop her characters,
during which duration we are unsure of what she is getting at. 
The piece comes together by the conclusion as Boni finds
fulfillment, leaving Nenette at bay, yet to work out her
difficulties.  Not Rated.  Running Time: 103 minutes.  (C)
