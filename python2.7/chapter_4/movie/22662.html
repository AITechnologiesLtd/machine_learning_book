<P>   More people are seriously injured each year on the football
field than in the boxing ring, yet some people who are ardent
fans of pigskin pugilism point moral thumbs down at the
roped-off slugfest.  This is not irrational.  The aim of the
defensive guard is to block the opponent from galloping freely
across the gridiron.  The objective of the prizefighter is to hurt
his opponent.  Moral misgivings may be justified in the latter
case but the case for banning football is not at all strong.</P>
<P>  You don't want to hurt your friends, though, do you?  How,
then, can you expect two people who are bosom buddies to
confront each other inside the ropes other than for some
friendly sparring?  This is the question that writer-director Ron
Shelton wants you to keep in the back of your mind as you
watch his "Play It to the Bone," a picture that's so crackling
with energy that you sometimes take your mind off its
repetitive, underwritten screenplay.  "Bone" is about two over-
the-hill prizefighters enjoying their final fifteen minutes of
fame under the bright lights of a Las Vegas stadium.  As you
watch the Madrid-born fighter, Cesar Dominguez (Antonio
Banderas) riding across the Nevada sands with his sparring
partner Vince Boudreau (Woody Harrelson), one thought
must remain in your mind.  How can these two guys,
scheduled to fight each other for real, ever manage to pull
their punches and yet avoid giving the crowd the notion that
the match is fixed?  The big surprise will be that they not only
go after each other like a mongoose for a snake but turn in a
struggle ferocious enough to bring the house down.  Much of
the movie's 124-minute play time is devoted to convincing the
audience that the two chums in this road-and-buddy film
share enough resentment to guarantee a bruising brawl.</P>
<P>   The call back to arms for the two tusslers comes when
hours before a preliminary middleweight bout, one contender
dies in a car crash while the other ODs.  Corrupt promoter
Joe Domino (Tom Sizemore) and his partner Artie (Richard
Masur) call up Dominguez and Boudreau at their Los Angeles
gym, promising them a quick $100,000 to share plus a
guaranteed title bout for the winner if they can make it to
Vegas that very day to allow the show to go on.  To save
money, Boudreau and Dominguez do not fly to Vegas but
instead call upon a woman with whom each had once
enjoyed an affair, Grace Pasic (Lolita Davidovich).  The first
part of the movie deals with the road adventure that the
threesome undertake; the second handles their actual fight
and its aftermath.</P>
<P>   Woody Harrelson parlays his fine performance in
"Sunchaser" into a role that suits his talents and shows
convincing chemistry with his co-star, Antonio Banderas, as
they take on the long, scenic route from L.A. to Vegas in
Grace's bright green, open-top car.  Harrelson, however, is
burdened with a discouraging character eccentricity.  He is
allegedly a religious person who occasionally skims passages
from the Bible in the back seat and in several scenes has
visions of Jesus--who in one situation saves him from
remaining on the mat for the 10-count.  Yet he--as well as
virtually the entire contingent of performers--spout four-letter
words incessantly and in one bizarre, unbelievable situation,
Harrelson's character engages in a sexual marathon behind a
gas station with a mixed-up druggie, Lia (Lucy Liu).  </P>
<P>   Davidovich is the movie's scene-stealer, looking dazzling in
the final portion as she strips off her driving clothes to fit
into a revealing outfit recalling her role ten years ago as Huey
Long's Baltimore stripper Blaze Starr.  Sporting a temper of
her own to match that of the two testosterone-addled road
companions, she restrains her former boyfriends from coming
to blows hours before the bout while ironically egging each on
from her ringside seat at the stadium.   In the side roles, Tom
Sizemore evokes considerable laughs as the promoter who
knows how to play his chess pieces against one another.  </P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 124 minutes.  (C) 2000
