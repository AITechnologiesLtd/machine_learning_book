<PRE>SESSION 9
---------</PRE>
<P>'Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself
behind.  Say, like if someone burns toast...'  </P>
<PRE>          Scatman Crothers as Dick Halloran in "The Shining"</PRE>
<P>New dad Gordon Fleming (Peter Mullan, "My Name Is Joe") desperately needs to
win a contract to keep his Hazmat Elimination Co., an asbestos removal firm,
afloat.  He startles his crew chief Phil (David Caruso, "Proof of Life") by
promising town engineer Bill Griggs (Paul Guilfoyle, "In Dreams") they can
complete a massive job at the abandoned Danvers State Mental Hospital in one
week.  The pressure is on when they and three additional workers enter the
foreboding place in cowriter/director Brad Anderson's "Session 9."</P>
<P>Brad Anderson, whose last film, "Next Stop Wonderland" was also shot in the
Boston area, has found a magnificent location in Massachusetts' Danvers
State Mental Hospital.  He and cowriter/star Stephen Gevedon have fashioned
an homage to Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining," with the modern feel of "The 
Blair Witch Project."  The film loses its tense grip at its climax, when
the titular Session 9 is revealed, but it provides an intensely nerve racking
ride getting there.</P>
<P>We know Gordon is under a lot of pressure, not only because of his shaky
business and some hinted-at problems at home with his beloved wife and new
baby, but because he hears an eerie voice on his first visit to the site.  
Phil begins to doubt his boss's judgement, particularly concerning Gordon's 
loyalty to crew member Hank (Josh Lucas, "You Can Count On Me"), who stole 
Phil's girlfriend and continues to needle him about it.  Hank also rides Jeff 
(Brendan Sexton III, "Welcome to the Dollhouse"), Gordon's neophyte nephew 
who's afraid of the dark.  Mike (Gevedon) is a failed law student who 
immediately gets drawn into the records and patient histories he finds in the 
basement, especially the taped nine sessions of split personality Mary Hobbes. </P>
<P>Mike, whose uncle was a DA during a satanic ritual abuse case with one of the 
hospital's patients, knows the history of the place and delights in regaling 
his coworkers with tales of horrific abuse and botched lobotomies (based on 
actual stories from Danvers State).</P>
<P>As Mike listens to tapes, Hank discovers a load of silver coins and other
treasures hidden behind a brick wall in a basement corridor (we're made privy
to the other side of that wall where an unsavory looking medical lab still
stands).  Hank returns at night to recoup the treasure and doesn't return to
the
job the next day.  Gordon visits the hospital cemetery to make private phone
calls to his wife.  Phil begins to speak to Mike about Gordon's state of mind.
Mike listens as Mary Hobbes takes on one persona after another.  Jeff's forced 
to face his fears replacing a fuse in a darkened room.</P>
<P>"Session 9" strongly resembles "The Shining" as each passing day is announced
by title card that precedes aerial shots of a forbidding and abandoned old
building with a dark history.  A central figure is a father with job
pressures who can hear the voices of the past.  The film's look is more akin
to "The Blair Witch Project" as shot by a professional (cinematographer Uta
Briesewitz uses the 24P HD camera - widescreen digital video that apes the
frames per second of film and captures every dust mote, paint peel and ray 
of light).  Characters meet their fates in much the same style as Blair Witch 
(camera blackouts) and one is even found facing the corner.  While the name 
Hazmat surely refers to hazardous materials, it sounds mighty similar to
"Blair Witch's" production company, Haxan Entertainment.  "The Texas
Chainsaw" gets a nod via the prominence of a loud, belching generator and
a bloody hand print on a van's exterior.  </P>
<P>The cast all turn in good performances, with Caruso being the standout as
a serious crew chief trying to keeping things pulled together.  Mullan projects
just the right amount of confusion to make us wonder if Phil's concerns
are valid and an air of sadness that matches the gloom of his surroundings.
Sexton III injects a freshness and innocence into the tough, experienced group.</P>
<P>Anderson knows how to build tension.  As his characters go off on their
individual side tracks, he cuts to the other team members innocently going
about their jobs.  Each will be impacted by the actions of the others in
some way.  But above all, Anderson knew a location in need of a horror 
film when he spotted one.</P>
<P>The grounds of Danvers State Mental Hospital are off limits to visitors.
If Burkittesville, Maryland is any indication, they better get more guards.</P>
