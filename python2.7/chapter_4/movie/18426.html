<PRE>Gods and Monsters</PRE>
<P>Ah yes, the little movie that could.  No doubt that more than a few heads
were shaking the night of the Academy Awards when the Best Adapted
Screenplay trophy had "Gods and Monsters" written on it.  What the heck is
this film, and why is Brendan Fraser in hootin' and hollerin' with
artsy-types Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave?</P>
<P>Turns out that Bill Condon is fascinated with James Whale, a director I had
never heard of, but what a resume-- _Show Boat_, _The Invisible Man_, _The
Man in the Iron Mask_, and the first two Frankenstein movies.  Condon made a
love poem to one of Hollywood's great neglected directors, one whose
eccentric behavior had him all but blacklisted in Hollywood, at a time when
very few directors were acknowledged.</P>
<P>So far, so good.  James Whale is near the end of his life, and he's living
in a respectable little suburban house, far from the glitz that Hollywood is
accustomed to.  One day, he witnesses the young man mowing the lawn, and
pursues a friendship with him (Brendan Fraser)...</P>
<P>And much, much, more.  Gods and Monsters, from the very start, veers into
territory that is popular amongst art-houses--the homosexual angst film.
"Oh, woe is me.  If only I were understood.  If only I were acknowledged for
the real me."  These words were not spoken, but they might as well have
been.</P>
<P>I can appreciate films which explore hidden characters of great,
unacknowledged individuals.  But tell me, in Hollywood, is not the
definition of one's sexual preference quickly taking the defining role as to
who that person truly is?  How superficial.  </P>
<P>Ian McKellen does an extraordinary job as to hiding completely within some
of the eccentricities of James Whale.  But take away the homosexual fetishes
of this dirty old man (which he had truly become), and who do you have?
According to this movie, nothing at all.</P>
<P>The other performances are wonderful, including Brendan Fraser.  But
trumping the entire cast is none other than Lynn Redgrave, as Hanna, Whale's
overly ethnic housekeeper.  What a performance.  Redgrave is fully
convincing, very funny, and quite emotional.  I've seen this, and I've seen
Judi Dench, and to be quite frank, Redgrave was robbed.</P>
<P>And the screenplay has moments of genuine old-fashioned emotionalism, as it
looks at Hollywood at a simpler time, still learning how to deal with fame,
only as shallow as characters the actors played.  The scene I really liked
was a mini-reunion between Whale, Boris Karloff and Ella Fitzgerald, of the
Frankenstein movies.  What was a genuine reunion of old friends turns into a
mundane photo shoot.  Such is the price of fame.</P>
<P>The tragedy is that Condon falls into the same trap that the film's
fictitious reporters have fallen into.  The reporters could care less about
who Whale truly is: just talk about them Frankenstein movies.  Condon
couldn't care less either: he wants only to talk about Whale's homoerotic
impulses late in life.  I appreciate the sentiment, but I still don't know
who the heck he is.</P>
