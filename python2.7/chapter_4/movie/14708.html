<P>Understand that I know absolutely nothing about Hunter S. Thompson or
his work.  Also understand that I have no desire to
research him or his work in order to write this review.  That having
been said, let's begin...</P>
<P>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is just a ridiculous mess.  It has it's
good moments, but ultimately infuriates the viewer for
having no point whatsoever.  The film is similar to 1980's Where the
Buffalo Roam where Bill Murray played rebellious writer
Hunter S. Thompson and Peter Boyle was his whacked-out attorney.  Here
it's Johnny Depp as Thompson and Benicio Del
Toro as his whacked-out attorney.  Where the Buffalo Roam skipped right
over the events of this film, and wisely so.  The
events in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas consist of nothing more that
Depp and Del Toro using drugs, stumbling around,
hallucinating, retreating to a hotel room, doing more drugs, stumbling
around, hallucinating, and so on and so on.</P>
<P>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas isn't telling us a story, and it isn't
trying to say anything.  It's just one long drug trip.  It's mildly
amusing for a while, and does provide a few chuckles, but it quickly
wears thin.  Depp is good playing yet another odd
character, but Benecio Del Toro again gets on my nerves here.  Whenever
I see him on screen (in movies like The Fan and
The Usual Suspects) I feel like I need subtitles to understand him.  Add
drunken slurs to his normal unintelligible dialogue and I
can't understand one single syllable he utters.</P>
<P>The film just seems to raise questions that would be interesting to see
addresses, but of course the film is more interested in
obscure drug trips than anything coherent.  For example, who is hiring
Thompson to write articles for them?  Why would
anyone tolerate that kind of behavior?  And also, who can live their
life like this?  How can someone consistantly wake up
surrounded and covered in filth, not knowing what has happened for the
last two hours or so, and then want to do it all over
again?  Come to think of it, that sounds a lot like how I felt after
seeing this movie.  Thankfully, I have enough sense to know
that I'd never want that to happen again.  [R]</P>
