<P>Y'all remember that nasty Y2K thingy that everybody thought was just one 
big hoax?  Well, I have a running theory: the Y2K bug didn't infect 
computers--it wormed its way into Hollywood's cameras this year...</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Carol Ann McKay (Linda Fiorentino) sees her glory days behind her; her 
brightest moment having been Prom Queen to husband Wayne (Dermot 
Mulroney) as King, she now marks time as a nurse in a nursing home in 
her small town while Wayne works the night shift.</P>
<P>Enter Henry Manning (Paul Newman), a famous bank robber in his 
youth--before he was caught in a bank vault--Henry is transferred from 
prison to Carol's nursing home after he has a debilitating stroke.  Or 
so he wants everyone to believe.  But Carol believes otherwise. 
Intrigued by Henry and by his exciting former life, she sets out to get 
a piece of the action by trying to draw him out of his haze; and she 
goes through extraordinary lengths to do so--much to Wayne's dismay.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
It was surreal, going from the pleasure of almost instantly liking 
KEEPING THE FAITH, the movie I watched just before this one, to hating 
WHERE THE MONEY IS in about the same swiftness of time.  </P>
<P>I noticed three things about "Money", right off the bat: first, it is 
only 88 minutes long, making it shorter than most run-of-the-mill Made 
For TV Movies these days.  When I sat down to watch it, I realized why: 
"Money" is terribly edited.  The hack job done on it put me in mind of a 
rabid butcher using a dull-edged spoon to cut up his cow because his 
boss didn't think he was quite ready to use sharp utensils.  And even 
with that, I can't convey the absolute mess "Money"'s editor made of 
this movie; the cuts come so fast and furious at the beginning, I wasn't 
sure whether I was watching the movie, or outtakes of it.  The third, 
and most insulting, thing I noticed about "Money", was that the 
storyline made absolutely no sense.  I did not believe a single thing 
they were trying to "sell", not for a moment--partially because my 
husband works in Corrections and I know (at least in our state) that It 
Just Doesn't Work That Way--but mostly because I did not feel the actors 
believed it either.  </P>
<P>I was embarrassed for the lot of them, most especially for Paul Newman.  
I have to give him props for making something of an effort, but the 
burden weighed him down, and he looked every bit his age.  Hard to 
believe this was the same man who brought the weary yet bright-eyed Cool 
Hand Luke to the Silver Screen.  As Wayne, Dermot Mulroney played Yet 
Another Doofus led around by his smaller head.  Every time I started to 
see a light come on behind Mulroney's eyes, signaling that an actual 
character existed in there somewhere, the focus would shift back to 
Carol or Henry; and by the time the camera came back to him, the light 
would be out again.  And someone should remind the makeup artist that 
worked on Linda Fiorentino, that when a person cries, their tears 
usually run down in a straight line; they're not generally smeared 
across the face as if someone applied Fake Tearz to try to convince the 
viewer that the actress was actually crying.  </P>
<P>If only that were the least of Ms. F's sins.  Setting aside the 
thoroughly disgusting notion of a nurse  attempting to seduce a 
helpless, wheelchair-bound stroke victim, could there have been a worst 
choice of characterizations in her pouty, fuzzleheaded little girl who 
still somehow managed to have her way with two seemingly brain-equipped 
men?  The whole concept of Carol's character was an insult to this 
viewer; I never took her seriously, and for the life of me, couldn't 
figure out why Wayne or Henry would, either.  Thelma and Louise, she 
ain't.</P>
<P>Even when I dislike a flick, I generally try to give it the benefit of 
the doubt, looking for at least one redeeming factor in them, some small 
thing that I can at least grudgingly say I liked.  </P>
<PRE>Nothing comes to mind here.</PRE>
<P>The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
>From what I can tell as a movie critic, the stock and trade of a good 
character actor comes when the casting director, confronted with filling 
a role calling for a specific characterization, has a Eureka Moment and 
thinks immediately of that person.  </P>
<P>This in mind, character actor Frankie Faison will not likely wont for a 
job, as long as mainstream casting directors keep him in mind ("we need 
a Frankie Faison type!") when they have a Smiling Older Black Security 
Guard/Cop/Hall Monitor/Teacher With Little To Do, role to fill.  Think 
back on his past few performances: has he played anything else lately?</P>
<P>On the other hand, at least he's one Black actor who has a "sure", 
relatively unembarrassing, part available to him if he wants it.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
A dud from start to finish.  It's a long way from BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE 
SUNDANCE KID and THE STING to this horribly edited dreck.  My heart goes 
out to Mr. Newman; no legend should have to "end" his career on such a 
sour note.  Hurry up and film another movie soon, Butch, so we won't 
have this to remember ya by!</P>
<P>WHERE THE MONEY IS (rating: redlight): 
I can imagine the folks behind this one are asking just that: "where the 
money is?".  They'd best take it and run.  Quickly.</P>
