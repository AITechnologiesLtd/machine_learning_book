MY DINNER WITH ANDRE (director: Louis Malle; screenwriters: Wallace
Shawn/Andre Gregory; cinematographer: Jeri Sopanen; Andre Gregory,
Wallace Shawn, Jean Lenauer (waiter), Roy Butler (bartender), 1981)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A couple of New York intellectuals get together for dinner and have a
confessional chat about their life. Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory play
themselves, in Louis Malle's two-character drama, displaying wit, humor
and charm. What is real is their personalities that shine through, as
for the opinions stated by each, that is scripted but is probably not
that far from their actual personalities. After all, they wrote what
they said. What results is a dinner conversation that at times seems
bewitching and at other times seems to be egotistical twaddle. The
overall effect is that the film seemed different, and therefore one had
the odd quality of watching these two eat roast quail in a top-scale
restaurant and psychoanalyze each other between munching on their potato
soup. It proved to be a compelling venture in storytelling, if nothing
else.</P>
<P>The unsuccessful playwright and now struggling actor, Wallace Shawn, is
on his way to have dinner with "a man I'd been avoiding, literally, for
a matter of years.'' The man is Andre Gregory, a successful New York
theater director, the one who put on Wally's first play, but who had
since vanished from the theater scene. He travelled to Tibet, India,
Poland, Israel, the Sahara, and the mystical Findhorn commune in
Scotland. Some people in the theater thought he cracked-up and some have
even seen him talking to trees. Recently, a friend of Wally's had come
across Andre in Manhattan, leaning against a building and weeping. Andre
had just come from Ingmar Bergman's "Autumn Sonata," and was moved by
Ingrid Bergman saying: "I could always live in my art, but not in my
life.''</P>
<P>The pragmatic Wally decides he will try and make the best of this dinner
engagement by asking questions, but that the director shouldn't expect
him to help with his emotional problems. He has problems of his own. He
was born and lived as a child on the wealthy Upper East Side (Wally's
dad was a former editor of the New Yorker), and his only thoughts then
were about art and culture, but now that he is an artist, all he thinks
about is money. His struggle is to pay the bills and to jump-start his
career.</P>
<P>Andre surprises him with his graciousness and ease, willing to tell him
about what he was doing when he ran away from the theater. As the two
engage in a genial disagreement about what life means, but showing most
of all, that they are both good listeners, challenging the audience to
carefully listen to a movie more than to watch it.</P>
<P>Andre for most of the film does the talking, telling about being invited
to Poland by Grotowski and participating in burial rituals that make him
connected to everything, including death. Wally tells of playing a cat
on stage and how some of the other actors who actually liked him, made
negative remarks of how he won't be able to perform properly in that
costume. Wally believes they said this because it is difficult to
express feelings directly to people. Andre counters, that we can't be
direct so we end up saying the weirdest things.</P>
<P>Andre talks about his trip to Findhorn and how those there could talk to
insects and work out deals where the insects could stay away from their
crops. That they grew the largest cauliflowers in the world. In Tibet,
he watched as Tibetans would have tea in silence, sitting for hours and
finding no need to talk if they had nothing to say. He berates life for
becoming just something that is habitual. He talks about Martin Buber, a
Hasidic, who told how pray liberates the spirits that enchain one--
everything in life should be a pray to free us from our slavery.</P>
<P>The most bedeviling story was the reason Andre felt he couldn't escape
from New York even if he wanted to: relating how someone amusingly told
him that New Yorkers built the prison they are in and are now the guards
of that prison, and are unable anymore to just leave.</P>
<P>Just as the film seemed to favor the independently wealthy, intellectual
elitist Andre's flightfulness and ability to travel anywhere in the
world, to lead a life with no purpose, living for the moment, it
suddenly turns and favors the struggling playwright, who is seeking a
comfortable bourgeois lifestyle. Wally says that he enjoys being with
his girlfriend, I enjoy waking up to a cold cup of coffee leftover from
the night before, and am pleased when there isn't a dead cockroach in
it. We don't have to travel to some exotic place to find reality, it is
right here.</P>
<P>Andre then seems to apologize for his spiritual quest, saying he became
too mechanical in his responses to life, living only for the theater,
that he needed to find a quiet in him where he could feel real things
again. He had to travel to find that spot inside himself. He also goes
on to say, that if you can't react honestly to people-there is a
deadness. That this journey was a training program for him to be a human
being.</P>
<P>The dinner seemed to end on an apology for both to go back to their
comfortable lifestyles, momentarily exhilarated by the richness of the
meal, the cheer of communicating their thoughts, and by the many
provoking subjects broached. These two seemed like two smug but likable
New York intellectuals, who have a good rap going for them. I thought
how riveting the conversation was and how it all ended up being so
mundane, titillating but irrelevant. The only thing left savoring was
the delicious mood they set.</P>
<P>Andre's quest is a safe one, where he still doesn't have to let go of
his wealth and ego, and Wally's pragmitism is a knee-jerk defense of his
ego. But for the viewer, any one of the numerous topics brought into the
conversation, could be a stimulant for further contemplation. I thought
the energy and the absurdity of the film, was the intangible grandeur,
the something that made this film a special treat, no matter its
seemingly bourgeois idealism.</P>
