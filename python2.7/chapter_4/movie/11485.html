<PRE>U.S. MARSHALS</PRE>
<PRE>Dear Caroline --</PRE>
<P>        The best way to approach "U.S. Marshals" is the same way I go
into the NBC Tower as an audience member for the Jenny Jones Show. (Is
she still on?) Just check your brain at the door, and try to enjoy the
ride.
        It might be a difficult concept to accept for "U.S. Marshals,"
the sequel to "The Fugitive," the hugely popular and 1993
Oscar-nominated film. The expectations are high, but the payoff is
low. The bottom line is that screenwriter John Pogue and former
editor-turned-director Stuart Baird have dropped the ball. This is not
like "The Fugitive" sequel you would have expected to see. Expecting
another tense drama, mano a mano, between Tommy Lee Jones'
Oscar-winning role as Deputy Sam "The Big Dog" Gerard and an A-list
star on the run, Pogue and Baird have delivered a confusing,
directionless film featuring a boring array of government bureaucrats
and spies. Ho hum.
        The producers seem to have forgotten what made the first film
such a success. The only thing we ask for is a testosterone-pumping
thriller as Gerard and Fugitive X butt heads. Instead, "U.S. Marshals"
is light on action, heavy on the international intrigue. The movie
feels like Pogue originally wrote a separate "Fugitive"-type of story,
and then inserted Gerard's grunts and groans to suit Jones' character.
        Gerard's crew, including Joe Pantoliano as Cosmo, is back, but
they only help chase the bad guy and actually have little input into
solving the case. Fugitive X this time out is Wesley Snipes as Mark
Warren, who in a matter of minutes goes from being mild-mannered
Chicago tow truck driver to extradicted federal prisoner falsely
accused of a double homicide in New York City. The drop-dead gorgeous
Irene Jacob plays his girlfriend, Marie, but Jacob is totally wasted
in the role.
        Soon after, Mark is aboard ConAir, gets attacked by a fellow
prisoner and then escapes after a high-budget, effects-laden airplane
crash, much like the bus crash in the original film.
        Mark goes by many last names and that's because he's not just
any tow truck driver speeding down Halsted Street. He's a covert
government assassin.
        This is where asking too many questions becomes a dangerous
thing. How did a smart guy like Mark get involved in a political mess
about South Koreans-Chinese and U.N. officials? How does a secret
agent-tow truck driver meet a Starbucks server and why should we care
about them? And my favorite, just where does Mark think he's going
once he's accomplished his mission in New York?
        The second half of the film takes place in New York City, but
don't believe it. It's still hometown Chicago in disguise, including a
shootout at the Graceland Cemetery (supposedly Queens) over by
Wrigleyville.
         Halfway through the movie Gerard is way out of his
jurisdiction, but that doesn't seem to matter. He already has the
evidence that prooves Mark is innocent, but he might as well chase
after him anyway.
        This needlessly complicated plot began to remind me of
"Mission:Impossible." Sometimes the chase is more important than the
reason for the chase.
        Pre-convict Robert Downey Jr. steps in as a government special
agent assigned to help Gerard with the case. It's never fully
explained what Downey does. In one scene, he identifies himself with
the DSS. That must be the Department of Stupid Spies. This film leaves
you with a lot of uncertainty about the intelligence of our
intelligence agencies.
        Maybe "U.S. Marshals" was doomed from the beginning with
Pogue's convoluted script. His only previous effort was as an
uncredited co-writer to the equally confusing "Eraser" with Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
        Director Baird ("Executive Decision"), who edited impressive
and unimpressive action films like "Demolition Man," "Die Hard 2," and
the first two "Lethal Weapons," keeps the film well-paced, but fails
to find the heart of the story. The sorrowful part for blockbuster
hit-less Warner Bros. is that Baird's "U.S. Marshals" may have killed
a potential film franchise. After four "Batmans" and the fourth
"Lethal Weapon" on the way, it is apparent the Brothers Warner could
use an injection of new blood. Of course, that's assuming Kevin
Costner's "The Postman Rings Twice" ever get green-lighted.
        Rating: Two stars</P>
