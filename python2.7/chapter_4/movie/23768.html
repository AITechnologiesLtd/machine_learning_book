<P>"A child on the farm sees a plane fly overhead and dreams of a faraway 
place.  A traveler on the plane sees the farmhouse and thinks of home." 
-Carl Burns</P>
<P>Perhaps Mr. Burns had ANOTHER PLANET in mind when he said that.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):</P>
<P>The synopsis from the official press release says it best:</P>
<P>  "Cassandra Jones [Sandy Daley] is a young woman from Toronto with a
   very active imagination and a unique view of the world. Feeling
   trapped by life in her low-income community, and unable to relate to
   her brother Patrick [Kevin White], a petty criminal, or her overly
   pious mother, Mary [Marcia Brown], Cassandra decides to leave
   Toronto. She applies and is accepted into an exchange program between
   Quebec and West Africa. When she reaches her Quebec destination, a
   pig farm, she encounters Sylvie Leblanc [Monique MacDonald], a woman
   in need of change, her husband Luc Leblanc [Daniel Levesque], a man
   afraid of change, and Abdoulaye Diallo [Tiemoko Simaga], her African
   exchange counterpart and a man who regrets his decision to seek
   change. </P>
<P>   Because none of her expectations are met, Cassandra quickly becomes 
   unhappy on the farm. Her presence creates plenty of tension, much of
   it humorous. A surprising conclusion comes about after a
   roller-coaster series of events. </P>
<P>   ANOTHER PLANET explores how we define ourselves be it by our gender,
   race, class or simply by what we eat, how we dress or what we believe
   in.  The film is essentially a journey in self-discovery; a journey
   we all must take at some time in our lives."</P>
<P>The Upshot:
It must be said right off: those of us who are more accustom to watching 
movies, as opposed to films, will likely have a bit of difficulty with 
writer/director Christene Browne's ANOTHER PLANET.  Unpolished and 
somewhat slow-paced at first blush, it takes some patience and an open 
mind to enjoy and understand fully.  If subtitles go right over your 
head, or if you equate success with bonzo-boxoffice, you might be prone 
to shrug off films like this.  If that describes your mindframe, read 
the above synopsis again and consider this: instead of being a 
celebration of self-discovery as told by an independent filmmaker, in 
the hands of a big-budget writer/director, ANOTHER PLANET would probably 
have had Cassandra be a neck-twistin', gum-snappin' hoochie mama out to 
get pi-zaid, Patrick a gang-bangin' b-ballin' playa, mother Mary a 
neglectful crackhead, and Diallo a race-hating pimp.  As I contemplated 
that very nightmare while watching Browne's film, I gained a greater 
appreciation of the vast difference between most independent filmmakers 
and Hollywood's "finest"--and the film came across much easier for that 
realization.</P>
<P>To be sure, "Planet" takes some getting used to, from both the story 
aspect as well as the "physical" film quality itself.  Cassandra's 
africentric storyline, though familiar to me with my own strong 
africentric leanings, was still quite different as it was flavored with 
her West Indies upbringing--which I, as a native Detroiter, could only 
imagine second-hand.  The spiritual character of Moko Jumbie, central to 
the outcome of the story, was something I struggled to understand (and 
in the end, failed to fully grasp, even with the help of the writer 
herself).  And as anyone from Detroit who goes across the river to 
Windsor could tell you, understanding French Canadian language can be a 
challenge in and of itself.   </P>
<P>It was worth the challenge, though; through Browne's interpretation of 
her own personal experiences, many familiar faces break through the 
somewhat unfamiliar surface.  The characters may have had a different 
accent, but I could see many old friends and kin in Cassandra, and Mary, 
and even in Sylvie and Luc.  And never before have I seen the face of 
God in the person of a "Majestic Black Woman" (played by Pancheta S. 
Barnett)--but, why not?  Seeing God really listening to prayers, was a 
moment unlike any other I've seen on film before; try that in a 
mainstream flick, and watch the sparks fly...</P>
<P>The performers, for the most part, do well.  Sandy Daley plays Cassandra 
with a light touch of humor, and without the go-girlness that is so 
prevalent in U.S. movie productions starring Black women; though she 
could use more acting experience, anyone that could hold a squealing 
piglet and not turn up her nose at the ordeal, is okay by me.  As 
Patrick, Kevin White left a little something to be desired; of all the 
main characters, his performance just didn't work for me.  On the other 
end of the acting spectrum, however, Marcia Brown's Mary conveyed the 
bible-thumping while lotto-playing paradox with a sense of humor 
reminiscent of the late Helen Martin in movies like DON'T BE A 
MENACE(etc) and HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE.  </P>
<P>Daniel Levesque, as Luc, and Monique MacDonald as his wife Sylvie, were 
more difficult to grasp early on, though as the film progressed, the 
Sylvie character became more defined, primarily through her interactions 
with Cassandra.  The battle-of-the-sexes, with Cassandra and Sylvie on 
the one side, and Luc and African exchange student Diallo on the other, 
was a subplot that wasn't as well developed as it could've been (and 
paled in comparison to some of the more stringent "Mars vs Venus" 
battles we've seen in mainstream flicks.  Not that that's A Bad 
Thing...); but Tiemoko Simaga (who spoke mostly French throughout) was 
good as the somewhat chauvinistic Malian who opened Cassandra's eyes to 
something she already had within her grasp.   In a refreshing change 
from American movie norms, Mathieu Dutan plays Jean "Johnny" Leblanc 
with all of the humor and none of the brattiness of his American 
contemporaries.  And almost a character itself, Donald Quan's background 
instrumental music added an unexpected richness to this film.</P>
<P>Believed to be the first Black woman to write, direct and produce a 
feature film in Canada, Browne's background makes for an interesting 
story itself; in the tradition of independent filmmakers the world over, 
she struggled to raise money to make and distribute her film, which is 
based on her time in an exchange program working on a pig farm in 
Quebec.  I hope she goes on to do another film based on her time working 
in Mali; it would be one of only a few "part two" stories that I'd look 
forward to seeing.</P>
<P>If you're looking for a Hollywood-type offering, look elsewhere.  Then 
remember how bloody awful Hollywood's offerings have been thus far this 
year, and reconsider ANOTHER PLANET.  I found myself glad for the 
exposure to a world outside of what usually passes before my eyes on the 
Silver Screen, and I look forward to seeing more from Browne's pen and 
camera.  </P>
<P>The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
What, you thought that there'd be no BF for ANOTHER PLANET just because 
it's a Black film?  Tsk...whaddya think "We Are Not A Monolith" means, 
eh?</P>
<P>Americans have a tendency to be strongly Americentric; we generally act 
like the world revolves around us, and that our viewpoint is the de 
facto standard.  Unfortunately, this tendency doesn't escape Black 
Americans, though (in a Monolithic way) you'd think We'd be more 
sensitive to such things.  Past the entry-level "shock" that often comes 
with dealing with a more personal film (as opposed to a megaconglomerate 
studio-backed blockbuster movie), many Americans might view the LeBlancs 
as not very much like any White folks they ever met, by gum!  Similarly, 
many Blacks might see scenes such as Cassandra braiding Sylvie's hair, 
for example, and grumble something or other about how We Can't Keep 
Anything For Ourselves, Doggonit. </P>
<P>Of course, this is shortsighted thinking; just another reason that we 
(and We) should be exposed to more multicultural experiences.  Not that 
we should beat ourselves up overmuch for our Americentricity; we've been 
hoodwinked (ObMalcolmXTheMovie: been bamboozled! run amuck! led astray!) 
by propagandistic politicians and media outlets for so long about our 
Rightful Place In The Sun, that it takes a lot for us to realize that 
there are other cultures out there with experiences and worldviews that 
are every bit as legitimate as ours, even when they diverge sharply from 
our own.  Even when members of those cultures look so much like us.  
And, of course, Us.</P>
<P>Substitute "I" and "me" for "we" and "us" in the above, and you get the 
general gist of my own experience watching ANOTHER PLANET for the first 
time.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
Though cultural differences may leave you wondering exactly how one plot 
point leads to another in this film, there is no doubt that 
writer/director Browne's personal experiences and quest for 
self-discovery, as told in Cassandra's story, have a universality that 
is easy to identify with.  Monolith or no, I most def Felt her desire to 
explore and defend her "Africanness", all the way down to my nappy roots.</P>
<P>ANOTHER PLANET (rating: greenlight): 
No, ANOTHER PLANET doesn't have the Spit 'N Polish shine that a 
big-budget flick has--but considering the way mainstream Hollywood has 
been spitting on its audiences lately, maybe that's A Good Thing.</P>
<P>[ANOTHER PLANET is scheduled to be released in art film-outlets this 
summer; stay tuned to 3BC for an upcoming interview with Bams and 
filmmaker Christene Browne.]</P>
