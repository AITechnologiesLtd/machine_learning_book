<P>Director/writer Nora Ephron continues her string of carbon copied films
that began with her participation on the screenplay of one of the best
romantic comedies around, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... (9/10). In 1993, she
decided to write and direct her own romantic comedy about two people
who were meant for one another, but didn't meet until the end,
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE (6.5/10), a poor man's WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, in my
opinion. Now, she even goes as far as to take the same stars as
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, basically the same premise, and shines on in her
quest for complete and utter unoriginality.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Man and woman meet on an Internet chat line and begin a
cyber-relationship via emails back and forth. Eventually, both of them
decide that it's time to actually meet each other face to face, without
the knowledge that they are, in fact, bookstore competitors in
real-life. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Boring, unoriginal, long-winded rehash of two of this writer's earlier
scripts, based on the 1940 film entitled THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER,
this movie is a perfect example of what Hollywood knows to have worked
in the past, and believes will keep working in the future (i.e. will
keep making money). Take two cute and personable stars of the day, add
a fabricated smidgen of romance, a contrived tinge of comedy, a slew of
wise-cracking and one-dimensional costars, a script comprised of lines
that would only be found in a script, various beautiful shots of NY
during all four seasons, and a baby-boomer soundtrack that will just
have the audience's hair standing up in recognition factor alone, and
you've got yourself a perfect recipe for the lowest-common-denominator
type films that Hollywood keeps cranking out from year to year, without
a hint of originality or enthusiasm.</P>
<P>This movie is not funny, barely romantic (the last 15 minutes are okay,
but only if you want to sit through the first 105 minutes of people
typing, a lot of scripted narration and a grand sub-plot about the
corporate giant stores getting rid of the mom & pops nowadays) and not
at all inspirational or creative. Does this mean that you won't like
this movie? I don't know. All I know is that if you're at all like me,
and you believe in the all-and-mighty theory that when a film's trailer
doesn't seem "do it" for you, the film generally doesn't do it either,
then this film is not for you. Having said that, it was Mrs. JoBlo's
idea to see this movie in the first place, she who actually found this
movie's trailer to be appealing, and she was also quite bored and
uninspired with anything this film had to offer.</P>
<P>The actors are okay, with Meg Ryan shining once more as the
cute-as-a-button store owner, who makes you smile when she smiles, and
ache when heart aches. Tom Hanks, on the other hand, does a decent job,
but between you and me, seems to have put on quite a few pounds of
late, and doesn't project much of a leading man role anymore (Remember
Brando, Tom? Put the desserts down from time to time, buddy. Trust me
on this one.) All of the secondary players are screenplay-generated
fluff parts that seem to want to be clever in every scene, and who are
generically divided into the "good clan" and the "bad clan". Nothing of
three-dimensions here, folks. The soundtrack was nice and the
cinematography beautiful at times, but these are supposed to be layers
of cream added to a solid script, not a replacement thereof. Both
elements seemed to be used in abundance whenever the script needed some
"stalling time", along various montage sequence of Hanks and Ryan
bouncing around. </P>
<P>This is not a good movie. It offers no originality, very little real
humour, and even less tangible romance. One kick that I did get out of
this film, was the fact that it majestically announced the "selling
out" of yet another independent film actor, in Parker Posey, who plays
the role of one of the most one-dimensional characters that I have ever
seen on film. Congratulations Parker, you are now part of the Hollywood
mold. This film may appeal to some of you who go in with extremely low
expectations, but either way, I suggest you go out and rent WHEN HARRY
MET SALLY instead, and thank me in the morning.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
After a one-shot guest appearance on TV's "Happy Days", producer Ron
Howard asked Tom Hanks to read for a secondary part in SPLASH, and got
the lead instead. He met his second wife, actress Rita Wilson on the
set of the 1985 movie, VOLUNTEERS. They have two children together and
Tom has another son and daughter by his first wife.
Meg Ryan's full name is Margaret Mary Emily Anne Hyra. She is also
married to a fellow actor, Dennis Quaid, with whom she has one son,
Jack Henry. She received $10.5 million for her role in this movie.  
Nora Ephron was married to writer Carl Bernstein, the man who had "a
little bit" to do with the whole Nixon Watergate scandal. They had two
sons together, and Ephron wrote her film novel and film, HEARTBURN,
starring Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep, based on their marriage. She
is presently married to the writer of the Martin Scorsese-helmed
GOODFELLAS (9/10) and CASINO (7.5/10), Nicholas Pileggi.
The two screenwriters of this script, Delia and Nora Ephron, are
sisters. All of Delia's movie-writing credits are associated with
projects involving her sister, Nora.
Producer Lauren Suler-Donner is the wife of the LETHAL WEAPON movies
director, Richard Donner.</P>
