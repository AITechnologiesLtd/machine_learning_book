<P>For the benefit of curious parents, let's get the formalities out of the 
way. Your kids will have all ball at Disney's "Mulan." Packed with action 
and humor, the film is imaginative, fun and fast-paced, presenting a 
strong tale of female empowerment while imparting a positive message 
about the importance of being true to yourself. </P>
<P>On the surface level, the film succeeds as fine light entertainment for 
adults as well. The disposable pop songs are mercifully short and few in 
number and the animation is striking, particularly in a majestic scene 
showing hundreds of warriors racing down a mountain slope. Too often, 
computer animation sticks out like a sore thumb when placed in the 
context of a traditionally animated film. Here, the CGI is beautifully 
integrated in a number of scenes that dazzle the eyes with a wealth of 
visual information.</P>
<P>Disney magic aside, "Mulan" is even more interesting when you examine 
what's going on under the surface. Remember all the raised eyebrows last 
year when Eddie Murphy was stopped by sheriffs while giving a ride to a 
transsexual hooker? The motives for his good Samaritan act were 
questioned at the time, but now everything is clear. Eddie was just doing 
research for his role in "Mulan", the first animated cross-dressing 
musical. </P>
<P>Murphy provides the voice for Mushu, a wise-cracking guardian dragon who 
accompanies our heroine on her adventures. When marauding Huns attack 
ancient China, the government calls for one man from every family to join 
the Imperial Army. Despite his age and physical limitations, Mulan's 
father prepares to go. She objects, only to be told "I know my place. It 
is time you learn yours." Undeterred, the spirited girl lops off her hair,
 dons her father's battle gear and takes off in his place, masquerading 
as a man. Of course, Disney cartoons require comic sidekicks and Mulan 
gets two; a good-luck cricket and Murphy's dragon, who offers advice and 
assistance as the fledgling warrior trains at boot camp for war. </P>
<P>"Mulan's" humor has a decidedly gay sensibility, with Murphy providing 
one-liners like "I'm doomed! And all because Miss Man decided to take her 
drag show on the road!" Murphy delivers his lines with the kind of 
distinct snap most often associated with gay camp humor. The drag theme 
continues throughout the film, as three of Mulan's bumbling fellow 
soldiers (including the gravel-voiced Harvey Fierstein) dress as women to 
infiltrate an enemy stronghold. In geisha drag, the trio throw themselves 
completely into their roles, with a funny mix of slapstick and high camp. 
Hetero audiences may view the scenes as mere farce, but gay viewers will 
know better. Tellingly, the only soldier who doesn't do drag is the 
troop's captain, a hunky leader who spends a good deal of the story with 
his shirt off. </P>
<P>The film wanders into the Tim Allen approach to gender stereotypes, with 
Mulan's attempts to impersonate a male coming straight from the "men are 
pigs" line of thought. At the urging of her dragon advisor, she spits, 
grunts and gives the other soldiers friendly punches to the arm and slaps 
on the butt. Thankfully, the story doesn't waste much time on this 
overdone line of shtick.
Spirituality plays a role in "Mulan," with four prayer scenes featured 
early in the story. Had the film been set in the Western world, it's 
unlikely that any religious references would have been made, but to many 
contemporary Americans, Eastern faiths are picturesque, exotic and even 
trendy, which makes their inclusion acceptable. In pop culture, religion 
is okay only if it's trippy and several thousand miles away. As if to 
underscore the point, Murphy's character does a mocking impression of a 
Christian evangelist in one funny scene.</P>
<P>In fairness, even the Eastern beliefs receive a bit of tweaking, with 
Mulan's revered ancestors presented as comically bickering ghosts. This 
fits neatly with Disney's Epcot take on Chinese culture, used as an 
attractive motif, but with about as much authenticity as the China 
pavilion at Orlando's World Showcase. While the animation springs from 
the "less is more" school of Chinese art, the Mouseketeers give it a 
Western spin, with fast, swooping movements from the broadly drawn 
secondary characters.</P>
<P>Despite Disney's trademarked candy-coated Americanization of foreign 
cultures, the film still succeeds, thanks to its sense of style, some 
very nice animation and a simple, but genuinely strong story. Young Mulan 
fails when trying to adopt the mannerisms of traditional Chinese women 
and fumbles when pretending to be a man. Only when she ignores societal 
expectations and uses her innate wit and strength of character does she 
succeed. That's a good message and "Mulan" is a good movie. Join the kids 
and whoop during the battle scenes or sit back and evaluate the subtext. 
Either way, you're going to have fun.</P>
