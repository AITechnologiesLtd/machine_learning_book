<P>Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is a psychologist who has been hired to
participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose
victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to
wake them up.  She has been experiencing moderate success with a young
boy in a coma, but the boy's parents aren't happy with the apparent lack
of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her
regular life.  As if trying to assure the boy's parents wasn't hard
enough on her, a new development arises that furthers the strain on
Deane's mental faculties. </P>
<P>A vicious serial killer named Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) has been
kidnapping women, locking them in an automated cell that drowns them
slowly in a matter of days, then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn
them into life-sized dolls.  Just after kidnapping his latest victim and
locking her in the cell, Stargher has a traumatic experience that
triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an
eternal catatonia.  The police, led by FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince
Vaughn) are able to locate Stargher by some clues he left while dumping
his previous victim's body, but they feel all hope is lost for his
current victim due to his vegetative state.  In a last ditch attempt,
they ask Deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo
the frightening task of entering Stargher's mind to try and find the
location of the victim locked in the deadly cell... a cell which will
completely fill with water in the next 40 hours!</P>
<P>Initial reports about this film described it as a cross between The
Silence of the Lambs and The Matrix.  While it does share some
characteristics with both films (particularly the first forty minutes,
which seem almost like a condensed version of Lambs), The Cell also
seems to contain elements of Dreamscape and Brainstorm.  The buzz around
this project is that first-time feature film director Tarsem Singh (who
won many awards for his video of R.E.M.'s "Losing My Religion") wanted a
script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story,
and a good portion of this film supports that theory.  </P>
<P>Despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script
that contains several logically questionable moments, The Cell does
feature some remarkable imagery.  All of the sequences where we delve
into someone's mind are incredibly beautiful (including the dank mind of
Stargher, whose thoughts are reminiscent of an H.R. Giger painting come
to life mixed with a Tool music video), proving that Singh is as adept
at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to
believe.  The first sequence that takes place in Stargher's mind is by
far the best, featuring one of the most ingenious traps I've ever seen
in a film (involving a horse, which no one seeing this film will
probably forget), a zoo-like display of Stargher's victims which are
animated like marionettes, and Stargher himself in a giant purple cape
that spans the walls of his mental throne room.  If the film had
continued within this dirty monstrous world I would have deemed the film
brilliant, but alas, the sequences only become more silly as they go
along (despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film). </P>
<P>The cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot
semblance during the parade of images, but at least Vincent D'Onofrio
turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance (magnified by ten,
thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed).  In my
opinion, D'Onofrio was one of the best creepy actors I have ever seen in
a film, but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful
(i.e.- The Newton Boys, Feeling Minnesota, The Thirteenth Floor, and The
Velocity of Gary) that I have begun to rethink my initial assessment of
him.  The character of Stargher is an excellent role for him though, and
will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him.  </P>
<P>Detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away
from this film, as it contains heavy doses of both.  Besides the nipple
ring removal I mention above, there is also Stargher's penchant for
hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and
legs (prior to his catatonia and capture) which will have audiences
recoiling.  A sequence where Catherine enters Stargher's mind and finds
him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty
disquieting.  One moment also features a character having his intestines
slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like
device. </P>
<P>As a narrative film, The Cell is sorely lacking.  As a collection of
images though, The Cell is extremely well done.  Although the latter
sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first
half, Singh has done what he supposedly set out to do: make a film
solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together. 
Unfortunately, a well-written script should have been considered too,
because without it The Cell just seems like any other music video we
could see on MTV (provided, of course, that MTV allowed for the use of
graphic violence and language in music videos). </P>
