<PRE>SCARY MOVIE</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Keenen Ivory Wayans
Written by: Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Aaron Seltzer, Phil Beauman, Buddy 
Johnson, Jason Friedberg</P>
<P>I'm going to keep the plot summary fairly short, because "Scary Movie" is 
really nothing more than a mix of different slasher films rolled into one. 
Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) is your typical high school student. Her 
problems include: dealing with school; her overly amorous boyfriend, Bobby 
(Jon Abrahams); a pushy reporter (Cheri Oteri); a psychotic, though inept, 
serial killer stalking the student body; and the fact that she and her 
friends, Buffy, Brenda, Ray, and Greg (Shannon Elizabeth, Regina Hall, Shawn 
Wayans, and Lochlyn Munroe respectively), ran over a fisherman and dumped 
his body in the ocean. They've all managed quite well to move on with their 
lives after killing that fisherman, but problems are developing. Now the 
serial killer is after the group, and they can't help but think it may be - 
oh forget it - if you've seen "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and/or 
"Scream", you know the rest. Those two current teen-slasher films are the 
main targets of "Scary Movie".</P>
<P>Someone at the MPAA should be fired (preferably everyone) for allowing this 
movie to hit theaters with an "R" rating. Children shouldn't have been 
allowed to view this film, and I saw several in the audience. The movie 
features such colorful scenes as a girl being plastered to the ceiling by 
her boyfriend's, um, release while the two are having sex; or a character 
being killed by a male's, uh, organ being shoved through his head. However, 
none of that really matters, because "Scary Movie" is intended for adults. 
So how does it succeed on that level you ask? The results are varied. When 
it's spoofing other movies, "Scary Movie" can be fairly amusing. When it 
starts hurling gross-out jokes at the audience, it falls flat on its face.</P>
<P>So what films fall victim to this most recent spoof's attacks? Obviously, "I 
Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Scream" are the primary targets, but 
"Final Destination", "The Usual Suspects", "The Blair Witch Project", "The 
Matrix", and a dozen or so others take a beating as well. How well these 
jabs work seems to depend on the film being spoofed. "The Blair Witch 
Project" is hit fairly well, with Cheri Oteri talking into the camera ala 
Heather Donahue's now famous moment. The small jab at "The Usual Suspects" 
doesn't work half as well because it doesn't fit in with the rest of the 
film. "The Matrix" takes an interesting hit; while it works brilliantly at 
first, the scene drops dead when Anna Faris starts doing an Irish jig in 
mid-air, for no apparent reason.</P>
<P>This is the part of the review I usually devote to an analysis of the acting 
in a film. However, that's a touch more difficult with a movie like this 
because it's difficult to tell if the actors are intentionally acting badly, 
to add to the satire, or if they simply cannot act. So I've decided to rate 
the actors based on their comic abilities and timing. Marlon and Shawn 
Wayans (best known for starring in the WB's horrendous "The Wayans 
Brothers") give two very different, though equally irritating performances. 
Marlon (in the role of Randy, made famous by Jamie Kennedy from "Scream") 
overacts to the extreme, while Shawn (as the gay boyfriend - that's funny 
right?) underacts to the point where we believe he's dead long before the 
character actually bites the dust. Newcomer Anna Faris gives an interesting 
turn, switching from a horrible performance to a great impersonation of 
Jennifer Love Hewitt in a split second. The film's best performance comes 
from Shannon Elizabeth ("American Beauty") as the school's resident phony. 
Watch for the scene where she confronts the masked killer for one of the 
movie's best moments. Kurt Fuller ("Wayne's World") shows up in an amusing 
performance as the town sheriff, and watch for a cameo by David Lander 
("Laverne and Shirley") as the school principle.</P>
<P>The only times "Scary Movie" really works well is when the jokes are clever 
observations about the faults in horror films. The movie fails when these 
observations are about as idiotic as possible, and this happens fairly 
often. The joke about David Arquette's character from "Scream", Deputy 
Dewey, is one of these moronic jokes. Gee, we'll make his character 
handicapped in this one and have him drool - that's funny too, right? The 
quick jab at "Final Destination" is more unexpected than funny, but that's 
more than we get out of most the film's jokes. "Scary Movie" runs a quick 88 
minutes, but it feels a bit longer than that. I'd recommend it only to those 
who are big fans of the Wayans brothers (assuming there are any out there) 
and fans of gross-out humor. I did notice that even people who found that 
kind of humor amusing seemed to get tired of it after a while. When the 
movie started the audience was cracking up, but by the end this had died 
down to nervous chuckles. For a lot of wasted opportunities, I give "Scary 
Movie" three out of five stars. By the way, if you enjoyed this movie I'd 
suggest seeing 1981's "Student Bodies", assuming it's possible to find it 
anywhere.</P>
