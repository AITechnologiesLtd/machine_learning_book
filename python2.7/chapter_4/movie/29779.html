<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>One film critic, Tom Milne, aptly said that Cornel Wilde maintains his
reputation in this film for making the most likable bad movies around. Sharks'
Treasure is an action-packed  nonsense thriller that is very entertaining. In
this oddity film, Wilde is the producer, writer, director, and star. He could
have used someone else to give him some help with the plot  and he could have
worked more with the supporting cast to make their roles more plausible and
meaty. Everyone seemed like a cartoon character, as there was no attempt made at
character development or for the storyline to make too much sense. </P>
<P>The film feels like it's stuck in a strange space-warp, as the all-male treasure
hunters are out at sea and are pretty close to going insane. The four treasure
hunters who seek buried gold in the Caribbean's shark infested waters are: the
skipper Jim Carnahan (Cornel Wilde), the one who dives amidst the sharks Ben
Flynn (Yaphet Kotto), a young man that the skipper favors but keeps calling to
his displeasure kid--whose real name is Ron (Neilson), and another diver named
Larry Hicks (David Canary). </P>
<P>In some of the most colorful scenes, they must battle the sharks to get to the
sunken treasure. They also squabble amongst themselves, hear the skipper lecture
them on the evils of tobacco and liquor, and have to put up with the the
60-year-old skipper boasting how fit he is as he tries to impress them by doing
one-handed push-ups on deck while impressing upon them the importance of keeping
fit. </P>
<P>Their happiness over their new wealth is short-lived, as they are overtaken by a
band of desperadoes. These hombres are bad dudes, bad actors, and bad punsters.
The leader is Lobo (Osmond), a bad joke for what a rough Hispanic pirate should
be like, who thinks of himself as a big man who should be respected. He keeps a
pretty-boy gringo, Juanito (Osmond), around as his trophy lover. The five felons
have escaped from prison and now  plan to steal the treasure and the boat, and
kill their captives, but emotions run high on the boat and a life-and-death
struggle takes place. This all seems bizarre and hardly real, but it's full of
emotion and the action is a hoot to behold. It's a film that has to be seen to
be treasured for what it brings up from such a slight story. </P>
