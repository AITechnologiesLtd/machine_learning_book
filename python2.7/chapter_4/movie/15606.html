<PRE>                              SOLDIER 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
              1 out of 4 for the man-made fighting machine</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee, Connie Nielsen, Jason Isaacs,
Gary Busey, Sean Pertwee.
Screenplay:  David Webb Peoples.
Director:  Paul Anderson.</P>
<P>Numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi,
suspense thrillers. Soldier is a multi–crossbreed between the likes of
Terminator, Aliens and offspring. The problem with such mixed genes is
that the final product is a real mongrel – not well made and should have
been put down before production got off the ground. Besides this, the
action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this
day and age. The fight scenes between Jason Scott Lee and Kurt Russell
seem laboured, slow and sluggish, and could have done with better
choreography. Russell who is usually a good actor in B-Grade action
flicks is unusually hampered by his character – Sergeant Todd, who seems
more like a Sergeant Toad. Besides having almost no dialogue, his
character appears stunted, zombie-like which is in line with his screen
persona, but scores little points of empathy with the audience. This
movie has not made me change my opinion about director Paul Anderson,
whose last epic Event Horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my
mouth. Although this movie does not come anywhere close to the
strangeness of former, it is still a long way from anything considered
desirable.</P>
