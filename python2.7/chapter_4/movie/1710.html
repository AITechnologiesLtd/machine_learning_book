<PRE>                                      TOYS
                       A film review by Malcolm Austin
                        Copyright 1993 Malcolm Austin</PRE>
<P>     I liked this movie a lot more than other people seem to have.
Partially, I think, this is because of one of my own quirks of judging a
movie.  I will often greatly enjoy a movie that achieves a distinctive
mood or feel through music, set design, camerawork, or other incidental
components, even if the plot and/or central characters of the movie are
weak.  This is why I enjoy some "bad" movies such as DUNE, STREETS OF
FIRE, or THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T.</P>
<P>     TOYS certainly achieves such a unique feel.  If this film does not
win an Oscar for set design, the Academy will have forfeited all
respectability as judges of artistic merit (like they haven't
already ...).  The movie is simply wonderful to watch from beginning to
end.  The only movie I can think of to compare it to is WILLY WONKA AND
THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, but this film is far more sophisticated,
visually, than that.  (Even if it doesn't have the Oompa-Loompas.)  One
thing that surprised me was how good the soundtrack was.  It uses
several of my favorite contemporary musicians, such as Enya, Thomas
Dolby, and the new and obscure (or so I thought) Tori Amos.  Not since
NORTHERN EXPOSURE have I seen such a variety of music used well to
create mood.</P>
<P>     Let's quickly go over the bad points.  The plot is predictable, but
that's not really the problem.  It starts with a lot of promise for an
obvious formula, but quickly becomes very dumb, culminating in a final
scene reminiscent of the classic SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS.
(This is not a complement, believe me.)  Most of the casting is actually
quite fine, with the notable exception of Robin Wright, who wanders in
and out of the movie sporting a really strange Southern accent, and
seeming to imitate Darryl Hannah all through the movie.  Robin Williams
is a perfect choice for the character of Leslie Zevo, and not just as a
zany comedian, but his talent gets squandered so badly that his only
good moments are the scenes where he is, in fact, a zany comedian.
(Contrast this to DEAD POET'S SOCIETY, in which his *worst* moments are
when he is a zany comedian.)  He does have one hilarious scene towards
the end as he delivers a Pattonesque speech to a bunch of wind-up toys
in his inimitable style.</P>
<P>     Joan Cusack, on the other hand, delivers a wonderful performance as
Leslie's sister Alsatia.  I think her work was good enough to merit a
Best Supporting Actress nomination, although I doubt she'll get one.</P>
<P>     There are so many unique scenes in this movie that I think it is
well worth seeing, despite its obvious flaws.  I'll definitely be
watching this film again.</P>
