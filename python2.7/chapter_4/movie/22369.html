 "Man on the Moon" (1999) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Jim Carrey, Courtney
Love and Danny DeVito. Directed by Milos Forman.</P>
<P> "Man on the Moon" opens in black and white with Jim Carrey in character as
Andy Kaufman talking directly to the camera.</P>
<P> Go home, he tells audience. This is a bad movie. Actually, he adds, it was
a bad movie until he got hold of it and cut out all the bad parts. This, he
says, is all that is left. Then the end credits begin to roll.</P>
<P> Oh, that "Man on the Moon" had been as inventive as its opening.</P>
<P> For those who knew the comedy of Andy Kaufman, "Man on the Moon" may be a
disappointment. Those who are not familiar with the late comedian, may
wonder, so what? What's the big deal?</P>
<P> In truth, "Man on the Moon," directed by Milos Forman, brings no new
insights about Kaufman to light. You can learn just as much by watching the
pair of documentaries about the comedian that are continually rerun on
Comedy Central.</P>
<P> And that is too bad. Kaufman was a unique comedian, a man who challenged
his audiences, tested their limits, pushed them to the edge - and then
sometimes shoved them over.</P>
<P> Like "Chaplin" of a few years ago, "Man on the Moon" presents the story of
a comic genius, but fails to show the genesis of the spark that set the man
apart from others.</P>
<P> And like "Chaplin," "Man on the Moon" is more of a highlights-greatest
hits narrative rather than an examination of the man himself and of what
drove him.</P>
<P> After the rather intriguing opening, the movie flashes back to Kaufman's
childhood where he is seen playing alone in his room, making believe he's
on television and performing to his wall, which he imagines as his audience.</P>
<P> His father comes into the room and tries to get Andy to go outside and
play normal games with the other kids. He also explains to Andy that to
really perform, you need an audience.</P>
<P> Well, flash forward several years and there's Andy on the stage at a
comedy club bombing big time. After some friendly advice from the club
owner, Andy comes back with his Foreign Man character as well as his Elvis
impersonation and before you can say, Judd Hirsch, he has an agent and a
featured role on a new sitcom called "Taxi."</P>
<PRE> If only real life were that simple.</PRE>
<P> The movie's main conflict revolves around Kaufman's philosophy of
performing. He does not consider himself a comedian. He sees himself as an
old-fashioned song-and-dance man.</P>
<P> He enjoys playing with the audience's mind, fouling up their expectations.</P>
<P> Of course, as in any good bio-pic, he is met with skepticism and
opposition until he finally gains popularity.</P>
<P> "Man on the Moon" seems to race through Kaufman's life. He goes from
"Taxi" to concerts, and then into his infamous wrestling phase, which
features his "feud" with pro wrestler Jerry Lawler (who plays himself).</P>
<P> A lot about Kaufman is left unexplained and unexplored. For example, Bob
Zemuda, Kaufman's creative partner is introduced in a scene backstage at a
nightclub where Kaufman, as overly obnoxious Vegas lounge singer Tony
Clifton, has just humiliated Zemuda, posing as a customer. The two are
gleeful that their gag has succeeded beyond expectations.</P>
<P> Yet, nowhere do we learn where Kaufman and Zemuda met, nor how they
decided to work together.</P>
<P> Like Athena from Zeus's head, it seems the pair merely sprung into being
fully grown and fully developed. Plus, since Zemuda is listed as one of the
movie's producers, did he or could he have exaggerated his contributions to
Kaufman's career.</P>
<P> Carrey is eerie as Kaufman - the on-stage Andy at least - recreating some
of his most famous bits: the Mighty Mouse sing-along on the first "Saturday
Night Live," Clifton, Latka from "Taxi" and, of course, the obnoxious,
bad-guy intergender wrestling champion.</P>
<P> Carrey's problem, though, is that when off-stage he continues to act like
Kaufman on stage; the hunched shoulders, big eyes. He fails to
differentiate between the public and private person.</P>
<P> Carrey gives a wonderful impersonation, but a rather tepid performance.
Like Kaufman, he only comes alive when in front of an audience.
The supporting cast, which includes Danny DeVito as Kaufman's manager,
George Shapiro, and Courtney Love as Kaufman's fiance, are merely wasted.
They either act befuddled and exasperated by his actions or laughing and in
awe of his comic genius.</P>
<P> "Man on the Moon" has been a movie much anticipated. Unfortunately,
especially for Kaufman fans, it is going to be a disappointing Christmas.
It's like expecting a Playstation and getting a pair of socks instead.</P>
