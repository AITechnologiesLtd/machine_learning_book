<P>_The_Very_Thought_of_You_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>It's no big shock that Miramax decided to give a more accessible title
to this modern-day screwball comedy, which has been released elsewhere in
the globe under the unconventional name
_Martha,_Meet_Frank,_Daniel_and_Laurence_.  That strange title pretty
much sums up the eccentricities of this film, which follows Martha
(Monica Potter), an American who runs off to London to start a new life. 
Within a couple of days, Martha individually meets Brits Frank (Rufus
Sewell), Daniel (Tom Hollander), and Laurence (Joseph Fiennes)--all of
whom fall in love with her.  Little does she know that the three are
lifelong friends, and little do they know that only one of them has her
love in return: Laurence.</P>
<P>Of course, a number of complications, coincidences, and
misunderstandings befitting that original title ensue.  But one wishes
that the film were as simple as the new, if generic and completely
irrelevant, title it bears now.  Potter and Fiennes are charming
together, and he is proven at playing lovelorn types (albeit not while
decked out in contemporary garb, which it is actually somewhat jarring to
see him in).  I would have liked to see them in a more straightforward
love story without all the mechanical silliness involving the other two
guys.  Unfortunately, that's what one must sit through in order to savor
their too-few sweet moments together.</P>
