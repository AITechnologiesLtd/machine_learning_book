<P>Payback (1999) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Mel Gibson.</P>
<P> A bit of the sadist is needed to really appreciate Payback. Mel Gibson's
latest movie is filled with unlikable people, most of whom come to gruesome
ends.</P>
<P> And when they are dispatched, you'll probably grin or laugh. Yea, Payback
is a movie for those people who get their entertainment from watching those
police or secret surveillance programs that Fox airs.</P>
<P> Payback is for those of us who slow down and gape at an accident scene,
secretly hoping we catch a glimpse of a mangled body.</P>
<P> In its own sick way, Payback has some cartoonish-like charm, and that is
mostly because of Gibson.</P>
<P> Here he plays Porter, a bad guy, a professional robber who, with his
friend, Val (Gregg Henry), steals $130,000 from some Chinese Mafia types.</P>
<P> Only Val double-crosses Porter, taking his wife and all the money and
leaving Porter for dead.</P>
<P> Like most Gibson characters, Porter is like that Eveready bunny - he takes
a lickin' but keeps on tickin'. Porter recovers from his gunshot wounds and
goes after Val, but not for revenge. He only wants his cut of the loot -
$70,000.</P>
<P> To get his money, Porter takes on the Outfit, a crime organization that
Val used the $130,000 to pay off as a sort of entrance fee.</P>
<P> Porter, then, keeps climbing the Outfit's chain of command, leaving bodies
in his wake, as he tries to secure what he believes is rightfully his.</P>
<P> Heck, you gotta admire the man's persistence.</P>
<P> Payback is a bloody, ultraviolent feature with no likable characters. Even
the cops are corrupt, waiting for Porter to make his score so they can take
the money from him.</P>
<P> But the script by Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential) and Terry Hayes,
based on the novel The Hunter by Richard Stark, keeps you riveted. There's
no let-up in the action as Porter moves from person to person like some
unyielding, unstoppable force of nature.</P>
<P> And if the plot sounds familiar, it's because it was adapted for film in
the late 1960s' as Point Blank, starring Lee Marvin and directed by John
Boorman.</P>
<P> Helgeland, making his directorial debut, seems to get some glee in sleaze
and S&M. Val, for instance, is savagely beaten by Pearl (Lucy Liu), a
dominatrix with a mean right and a taste for blood.</P>
<P> Porter is tortured by having some of his toes slammed by a sledge hammer.</P>
<P> Helgeland isn't so foolish as to show the toes actually being struck, but
you hear the sounds of bones crunching. And that's enough to make an
impact.</P>
<P> As Porter, Gibson shows the dark side that's underneath some of his more
heroic characters such as his Lethal Weapon's Martin Riggs. Gibson goes
through the entire film with a scowl on his face as if he swallowed a stale
burrito.</P>
<P> Henry makes his appearance felt as the conniving Val, while William Devane,
James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson are featured as the higher-ups of the
Outfit.</P>
<P> Maria Bello, best known for her role on TV's E.R.. plays Porter's love
interest, the stereotyped hooker with a heart of gold.</P>
<P> Payback is definitely not a date flick. It's mean, dirty, ultra-violent
and devilishly fun. But you may feel a twinge of guilt afterward.</P>
