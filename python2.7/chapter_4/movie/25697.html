Susan Granger's review of  "COYOTE UGLY"</PRE>
<P>Adding a new finale, a flashy musical number at the hip, rowdy
bar where the exhibitionistic young women work, caused this Jerry
Bruckheimer film to almost miss its August 4th opening date. And - who
knows? - perhaps it was the only fitting conclusion to this cinematic
amalgam of Hooters, "Cocktail" and "Flashdance," written by Gina
Wendkos and directed by David McNally, a veteran of TV
commercials. Newcomer Piper Perabo stars as a naive, 21 year-old
aspiring New Jersey singer-songwriter who ventures across the Hudson
River to seek fame and fortune as a barmaid in Manhattan's gritty,
high-energy Coyote Ugly bar, strutting her seductive shots-and-beer
stuff under the watchful eye of bar owner Maria Bello, who mandates:
"You are to appear to be available but never be available. Other
tantalizing, dancing "coyotes" include Izabella Miko, Bridget Moynahan
and model Tyra Banks. Coyote Ugly's a treasure chest (pardon the pun!)
of unruly, bizarre behavior - like hosing down the crowd if someone
orders water, even setting fire to the bar - but that's about the only
interesting thing in this otherwise dull, wretchedly cliche-filled
movie. Predictably, there's a skeptical guy Piper falls for - Adam
Garcia.  Her apartment gets robbed and her nice-guy, widower dad,
played by John Goldman, is hospitalized - yawn! There's a sexual tease
with tight, revealing costumes but no nudity. It's rated PG-13. The
sound-track rocks loudly even if it doesn't exactly roll - with singer
LeAnn Rimes dubbing Piper Perabo's voice and making a cameo appearance
near the end of the film. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Coyote Ugly" is an undulating, sappy 3. If you want to find the REAL
Coyote Ugly watering hole, it's on 10th Avenue in the East Village.</P>
