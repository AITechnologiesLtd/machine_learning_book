<PRE>A review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * *</PRE>
<PRE>CAST
Neve Campbell - Sidney Prescott
Skeet Ulrich - Billy Loomis
Matthew Lillard - Stuart Maker
Jamie Kennedy - Randy Meeks
David Arquette - Deputy Dwight "Dewey* Riley
Courtney Cox - Gale Weathers</PRE>
<P>Twelve years ago, director Wes Craven gave audiences "A Nightmare on Elm
Street", and terrified an entire generation. After an ungodly number of
terrible sequels, Mr. Craven has collaborated with writer Keven Williamson on
something quite new. "Scream", is a rare item indeed. A serious horror movie in
which all involved seem to realize they are in a horror movie. </P>
<P>A serial killer, obsessed with old horror movies, is stalking a small
California town. After the brutal murders of two high school students in the
beginning of the film (one of the movie's most shocking and tense scenes), a
group of high school students decide to figure out who the killer is. Sidney
Prescott (Neve Campbell), is more or less the leader of the group, and her
mother had been killed the year before. As the teens search for the killer's
identity, everyone becomes a suspect. Things are made more interesting by a TV
reporter, Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), and a deputy (David Arquette) who are
also trying to determine the killer's identity.</P>
<P>This film is not for the squeamish, be forewarned. It just barely squeaked by
an NC-17 rating for exessive gore.  I can't, in good conscience, give a blood
splattered horror movie a higher rating than four stars, but this is truly one
of the best I've seen. The only weak point in this film seems to be Neve
Campbell's acting at times. It's not that she does a bad job, she simply isn't
as convincing as the rest of the cast. In particular, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew
Lillard are quite good. Lillard plays Campbell's boyfriend, and Lillard is a
goofy member of the group. Jamie Kennedy is a riot as the horror movie expert
of the gang, spending a good deal of time spouting off lines from horror films
and quoting the rules for how to survive a horror flick.</P>
<P>Another excellent member of the cast, though she isn't in it for too long, is
Drew Barrymore. Playing a terrified student, home alone one night at the
beginning of the film, she does a marvelous job. One last thing I must point
out, is how much I enjoyed the mystery aspect to the story. The majority of
horror films make it quite clear who the killer is. Not here. The murderer
wears a ghoulish halloween costume which hides the face behind a rather scary
looking fhost mask.</P>
<P>This movie is a lot of fun for those who have strong stomachs. If you don't
normally enjoy slasher flicks, stay far away from this one. Watch for two
rather surprising actors in here too. Henry Winkler, as the high school
principal, and Robert Englund (Freddy Kreuger) shows up very quickly as a
janitor.</P>
<P>* * * * * - One of the greatest movies ever made, see it now.
* * * * - Great flick, try and catch this one.
* * * - Okay movie, hits and misses.
* * - Pretty bad. See it if you've got nothing better to do.
* - One of the worst movies ever. See it only if you enjoy pain.</P>
