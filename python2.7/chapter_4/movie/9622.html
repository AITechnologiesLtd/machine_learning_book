<PRE>The Peacemaker
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) George Clooney was the best movie Batman yet. Val
Kilmer was flat and brooding and Michael Keaton was too much of a wimp.
Clooney brought the right mix of sophistication and wisdom. Not being a
fan of ER, I attributed his success to good acting. </P>
<P>Now that I've seen him play the same character in ONE FINE DAY, ER, and
now THE PEACEMAKER, I see that he's one of the worst actors to make it
big, good looks aside. He's the next Arnold Schwarzenegger - icon, not
actor. </P>
<P>THE PEACEMAKER is a very conventional action movie. All the baroque
trim, all the flourishes, have been removed. There is no love interest,
there are no wisecracks, just stripped down, economy model action movie.
This was no doubt Leder's point, and it was a good idea, but it didn't
work. </P>
<P>The effect was that the movie felt, well, plain. It felt like a quickly
made, no-time-for-details, made-for-TV movie (not surprising considering
Leder's strong TV background). It didn't shun enough of the action genre
to really set itself apart. </P>
<P>After an opening sequence of Russians stealing a packet of nukes, the
movie introduces Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman), a special investigator
whose job it is to find out what happened to them. Assigned to assist
her is Tom Devoe (Clooney), a military liaison with strong Russian
connections. </P>
<P>They track the nukes through Vienna, where Clooney is tailed by a crew
of disposable bad guys in identical cars. The ensuing chase scene is
very well handled; it looks great on screen. But the endless
destruction, first without any airbags deploying, and second without any
apparent moral or legal consequence, shows that Leder and screenwriter
Michael Schiffer really didn't leave the action genre as far behind as
one might think. </P>
<P>Kelly and Devoe eventually recover all but one of the stolen nukes. They
track this last one to Bosnia, where they learn that Gavrich (Marcel
Iures) a Bosnian politician disgusted with the West's lack of aid in
their war, intends to detonate a single nuke at the U.N. building in New
York.  </P>
<P>The movie crosses the Atlantic to Manhattan, where another good-looking,
but rather conventional chase scene happens. The movie's climax involves
what Roger Ebert calls RDRs - red digital readouts - counting down to
the destruction of New York. </P>
<P>Can Kelly and Devoe stop the bomb in time? Well - yes and no. But even
that enigmatic conclusion isn't enough to set this movie apart. </P>
<P>It would be interesting to see a truly genre-breaking action movie that
doesn't just shun the superficial elements (like love interests and
wisecracks), but questioned the very idea of using violence to combat
violence as the morally Right thing to do. </P>
<PRE>Or maybe that would just be boring.</PRE>
