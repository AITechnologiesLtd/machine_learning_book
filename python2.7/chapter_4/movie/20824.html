<PRE>"American Beauty" - More than Just Skin Deep
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>`American Beauty' offers us a glimpse into what really
fuels suburban families, like that of Lester Burnham
(Kevin Spacey).  In doing so, the film tears apart the
suburban myth of well-trimmed rose-gardens and
automatic garage door openers.  Sure, Lester may have
a nice house, a family, and a relatively secure
future, but his life isn't much more exciting than
that of a mannequin.  And though he projects a
constant smile, his life is just an endless spiral of
boredom and the highlight of his day is his morning
shower.  What has made his life so bereft of passion? 
Perhaps it's his prissy wife, Carolyn (Annette
Bening).  She also smiles a lot and tries to excel as
a real estate agent.  But her life is equally vacuous
and her soul is joyless.  Her self-confidence is
almost non-existent, and her marriage to the
milquetoast Lester is nothing but a loveless sham. 
Daughter Jane (Thora Birch) doesn't add any sanity to
this family either.  Even Lester admits that what
neighbors see is `a commercial for how normal we are
when we're anything but.'  </P>
<P>Now, dig a little deeper and look a little closer. 
This film reveals some very surprising things that you
would never think would exist.  What gets Lester's
juices flowing again is Angela (Mena Suvari), a friend
of Jane's that he begins fantasizing about.  Angela,
who confidently boasts about her adult experiences,
doesn't mind the attention and says that if Lester had
more muscles, she would be interested.  DING!  Lester
breaks out the weights and starts a running regimen. 
But this is just the beginning of the new Lester.  He
quits his job and blackmails his boss at the same
time, he begins smoking powerful marijuana, and he
buys a classic muscle car.  But why should Lester have
all the fun?  His radical actions prompt Carolyn to
begin an affair with her chief competitor while Jane
begins to take an interest in a mysterious boy next
door.</P>
<P>The wheels are set in motion and the film wonderfully
strips any conventions that we have of suburbia and
gives us some very strange yet sad characters with
whom we can empathize.  For Lester, it's time to let
loose.  He no longer cares about anything and while
chaos can destroy the sanctity of his home, it is the
only thing he appreciates now in his life. 
Consequently, the situations that he winds up in are
often funny, poignant, and amusing.  A counter-story
to Lester's life features a militaristic, homophobic
retired marine living next door.  He preaches
discipline to his son.  But like the Burnham's nothing
on the outside is as it really seems.  The real
interesting point that this film makes features
another of Lester's neighbors, Jim and Jim (Scott
Bakula and Sam Robards), who are gay.  Despite their
strange outward appearance, their lives were the most
normal of all.</P>
<P>The beauty of `American Beauty' is it's harsh
revelations and brutally frank situations.  
This is not a film that strives to entertain as a
comedy.  Rather it is a film that tries to scrape away
at the true nature of people like Lester Burnham.  As
Lester, Kevin Spacey is comfortable and almost too
real as the dispirited suburbanite whose last chance
at living is fading fast.  Annette Bening also shows
might in her portrayal of the brittle housewife. 
However all of the wonderfully developed characters
and their complexities will beg you to ask yourself
what may really be going on in your own cul-de-sac
world. </P>
