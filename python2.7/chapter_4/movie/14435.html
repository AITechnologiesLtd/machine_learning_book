<PRE>Tootsie (1982)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 68</PRE>
<P>"Tootsie" is a successful and entertaining comedy.
While not as good as its reputation, there are
many genuine laughs to compensate for its
weaknesses.</P>
<P>"Tootsie" stars Dustin Hoffman as a talented but
troublesome actor, unemployable due to his
reputation.  Out of desperation, he dresses up
as "Dorothy" to win a role as a woman on a daytime
soap.  He is somehow able to pull off this fraud
for a year, although it causes problems with his
old girlfriend Teri Garr, his new girlfriend
Jessica Lange, and his boyfriend (?) Charles
Durning.</P>
<P>"Tootsie" examines gender roles and differences,
and seems to conclude that women are better than
men.  In his final lines, Hoffman admits that he
was better as a woman than he is as a man, whatever
that means.  One of the male characters is a jerk
(soap director Dabney Coleman) and another is a
romantic buffoon (George Gaynes).  Admittedly,
the principal female characters have their faults
as well.  Lange drinks too much, while Garr can't
get her life together.</P>
<P>Other than two Steven Bishop songs, the most obvious
weakness of "Tootsie" is that no one except his roommate
(Bill Murray, in one of his best supporting roles)
and his agent (Sydney Pollack, who also directed)
knows that "Dorothy" is a man.  Even more unlikely
is the unwanted romantic attention he receives, from
Gaynes and Durning.</P>
<P>This was the first feature film for Geena Davis.
She makes an auspicious debut in a dressing room.</P>
<P>"Tootsie" was nominated for numerous Academy Awards,
including Best Picture, Best Actor (Hoffman),
Best Director, Best Original Screenplay,
Best Supporting Actress (Garr) and Best Cinematography
(Owen Roizman).   Somehow, the sappy "It Might Be
You" was nominated for Best Original Song.
The only Oscar the film won was by Jessica Lange
for Best Supporting Actress.</P>
