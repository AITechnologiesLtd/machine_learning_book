<PRE>_The_Best_Man_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>If you ask me, it's impossible to not like a film that ends with the
entire cast doing the electric slide to Cameo's '80s funk classic
"Candy."  But there's more to enjoy in   _The_Best_Man_ than its
infectious full company closing dance number.  First-time writer-director
Malcolm D. Lee's fresh and fun ensemble comedy is a classy effort that
delivers the requisite doses of laughs and romance along with a fair
amount of intelligence.</P>
<P>As the title implies, the central event in _The_Best_Man_ is a wedding,
that between football star Lance Sullivan (Morris Chestnut) and his
longtime love Mia (Monica Calhoun).  The blessed event reunites a number
of the couple's college friends, including Murch (Harold Perrineau Jr.),
henpecked by longtime girlfriend Shelby (Melissa DeSousa); self-styled
player Quentin (Terrence Howard); successful BET television producer
Jordan Armstrong (Nia Long); and of course the best man himself, author
Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs), who is shy to committing to long-suffering
girlfriend Robin (Sanaa Lathan).   He shakes up what could have been a
smooth and blissful reunion when an advance copy of soon-to-be-published
novel--not-so-loosely based on his and his friends' dirty little
secrets--makes the rounds within this tightly-knit circle. </P>
<P>This is the film's one aggravating contrivance.  Harper did not see any
harm in airing his personal dirty laundry in the book because it was
scheduled to be released after the big reunion at the wedding and hence
wouldn't have to face everyone about it--or endanger Lance and Mia's
impending nuptials.  In the latter respect, it's understandable why he
would not want his friends did not see the book until its release, but
even once the two are wed, they and the others would eventually get upset
with him anyway.  And Harper is presented as someone who values
friendship, not to mention a great writer; he is mentioned to be set for
an appearance on _Oprah_ for his book.  With the plot of his book so
closely mirroring his real-life past, Harper doesn't appear to be that
imaginative an author.</P>
<P>But one doesn't dwell on the issue since Lee's own writing and execution
is energetic and entertaining.  _The_Best_Man_ may be named for one
character, but this is an ensemble film in the best sense, with all the
characters each given their moments to shine and doing so brilliantly. 
In fact, Harper is perhaps the least interesting of the bunch; far more
amusing are the smooth, smug womanizer Quentin and the shrewish Shelby,
both played to perfection by Howard and DeSousa.  This is not to say that
the two most central players, Diggs and Long, fail to hold their own;
blessed with talent and chemistry to match their good looks, they make
for very captivating and likable leads.</P>
<P>As many times as I laughed during _The_Best_Man_, what I remember most
clearly are the sweet and more serious moments.  While the scandal of
Harper's book is the engine of the film, its heart lies in love and
fidelity--not just to lovers, but also to friends.  The resolution to one
of the plot threads may be a disappointment to some audiences, but it
ends on the right note, and Lee must be commended for not going for the
cheaply crowd-pleasing twist.  In any event, any dissatisfaction is
completely erased by the closing dance number--a perfect delight of a
capper to a perfectly delightful film.</P>
