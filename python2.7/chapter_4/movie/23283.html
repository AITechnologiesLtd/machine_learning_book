<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A postwar British noir film; revenge being the theme. Clem Morgan
(Trevor Howard) was an RAF pilot during the war, but is now
disenchanted. He drunkenly chooses to join a criminal gang of black
marketeers, encouraged to do so by his girlfriend Ellen (Ashley).</P>
<P>When he discovers his boss, Narcy (Griffith Jones), is dealing in drugs,
he tells him he wants out. The vicious gang leader, hating the amateur
crook and pining for his woman, decides to frame Clem for murder. He has
gang member Soapy (McNaughton) run over a cop during one of their
escapades, and they crash the car into a lamppost while knocking out
Clem. They escape into a waiting car and Clem is convicted of
manslaughter, and will serve a 15- year sentence in Dartmoor prison.</P>
<P>He receives a prison visit from Sally (Sally Gray), a chorus girl and
the former girlfriend of Narcy. The jealous woman tells Clem that Narcy
dumped her for his girlfriend Ellen. She also says that she knows he
could get Soapy, the driver of the getaway car he was in, to corroborate
his innocence. Soon afterwards, Clem escapes from the prison. While on
the run, he enters a household and the housewife gives him clothes and
food and a gun. She tells him the gun is for him to kill her drunken
husband; she says one more murder wouldn't make a difference to him. He
refuses, but when he leaves the gun behind, she has his fingerprints on
the gun, and thereby she kills her husband. The newspaper headlines
proclaim that the escaped convict has killed another and they increase
their manhunt.</P>
<P>He hitches a ride from a lorry and jumps the driver, thereby driving the
lorry through the roadblock and reaching London. Inspector Rockliffe
(Ballard Berkeley) suspects that Sally is in danger from Narcy for
squealing to Clem, and tries to take her down to the station for her own
protection. But when he leaves her with a cop, Narcy's gang overtakes
the cop and they take her back to their hideout.</P>
<P>Soapy and his girlfriend Cora (Ray) go into hiding, fearing Narcy will
kill Soapy since he is a witness to the frame-up. Narcy sends the
knife-wielding Jim (Brennan) after him. Meanwhile, Clem is determined to
get revenge and tracks Narcy and to the gang's  hideout. He has a fight
with Narcy on the roof, amid the gigantic letters R.I.P., which are
brightly reflecting from the moon's beams bouncing onto the roof, as the
two struggle for life and death. There will be no happy Hollywood type
of ending here.</P>
<P>The film was mildly diverting, suffering from a weak storyline and
Trevor Howard as the lead actor. He is too regal an actor to play a noir
protagonist. What was gritty about the film, was the quick-cut editing,
the magnificent black and white photography, and the keen direction. The
film had a certain amount of distress coming forth from it characters
and lots of brutal scenes, adding much suspense to the routine story.
But the British films are no match to the Americans when it comes to
noir, this one being no exception.</P>
