<P>"Go back to Jersey, Sonny. This is the City of the Angels and you
haven't got any wings."</P>
<P>        If I had to choose one particular line of dialogue from L.A.
Confidential that perfectly summarised the kind of feeling you get
from watching this film… well, I don't think I could do it. The
reality is that every single moment of this film is so well crafted
that I can't see how it could possibly be improved. However, the above
quote, uttered by Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) during a violent
police interrogation, succinctly sums up the world of L.A.
Confidential. This is a world of tough justice, where the cops are
every bit as bad as the criminals and corruption lurks everywhere.
This is classic film noir.</P>
<P>        The story revolves around three cops in L.A. during the 50s,
whose lives become entangled following a horrendous spree killing at
the Night Owl Coffee Shop. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is the merciless
cop who prefers the violent brand of justice. Ed Exley (Guy Pierce) is
the ambitious, by-the-book cop, who is trying to live up to his
father's police career. Kevin Spacey (Jack Vincennes) is the cop who
works as technical advisor for a TV show, who, in a rather poetic
moment, admits that he can't remember why he became a cop in the first
place.</P>
<P>        Now this may all sound rather routine for the genre, but L.A.
Confidential is superior to almost all its noir relatives. The script
is so well written and the acting is so uniformly superb, that it's
two and a half hour length actually feels short, even upon multiple
viewings. Indeed, L.A. Confidential deserves to mentioned alongside
other landmark noir films such as The Maltese Falcon, Chinatown and
The Big Sleep. </P>
<P>        The film crams so much plot into it's run-time, that there's
no way I can provide an adequate summary in this review. I haven't
even mentioned the roles of Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger), Sid Hudgeons
(Danny DeVito), or Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), and yet they're
all such memorable characters. </P>
<P>        Probably the most amazing thing about L.A. Confidential is the
fact that Curtis Hanson's name is next to the writing and directing
credits. We're talking about the man who's previous accomplishments in
film include The River Wild and The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (just
thinking about them makes me cringe). However, Hanson has made a
complete turnaround with L.A. Confidential and proven that he can make
film on a level far above most of his contemporaries. What remains to
be seen is whether he will emerge as the latest auteur or remain a
one-hit-wonder.</P>
