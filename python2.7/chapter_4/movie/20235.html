<PRE>Genghis Blues (NR) *** 1/2
Starring Paul Pena, Kongar-ol Ondar
Directed by Roko Belic
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>There is not one other film this year that will give off the same amount of
emotions that Genghis Blues does. At first, it's tone is rather comedic, it
follows the story of a blind man's (Paul Pena) journey to Tuva, a country just
north of Mongolia, to enter the throat singing championships. Throat singing is
manipulating the human voice into singing two notes at once, and Paul's
nickname is earthquake for a reason</P>
<P>He is greeted by everyone. Being one of the first Americans ever to want to
visit Tuva, he spends most of the film traveling the countryside and singing in
the contest. He experiences his first sheep slaughtering, a bath in a holy
river, and delicious Tuvan vodka. His times there are very happy, but things
begin to go bad. Running out of his depression medication, the crew in forced
to have some shipped directly to them (which isn't very easy.) This let's us
see Paul's more vulnerable side, and it's extremely sad.</P>
<P>But the film is so much more than that. Have you ever seen a film that can be
sad, uplifting, depressing, and trimuphant all at the same time? No, you
haven't. In Paul's home of San Francisco he is just a stupid blind man who's
only place he can go by himself is the local mini-mart. They tell of a time
where Paul was asked directions while a man took a $400 dollor check out of his
hand. </P>
<P>But in Tuva he is a god. And his memories there is something that people can
never take away from him. Genghis Blues appeared at the Seattle International
Film Festival and has begun a two week run in Seattle. I'm not sure if it will
be released elsewhere, but if it does, I highly recommend that you see this
wonderful movie. This is a true triumph of human emotion. Genghis Blues gets
*** 1/2 stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film contains a sheep slaughtering scene (it's not that bad)
and some mild language. Good Age: 9 & Up</P>
