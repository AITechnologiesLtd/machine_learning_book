<PRE>"Moulin Rouge"  -- Laissez Les Bon Temps Roulez
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>Summer's most impressive visual spectacle has hit the
theatres.  But in this film, you won't find squadrons
of bombers or capsizing battleships.  Instead, you'll
find a rhapsodic presentation that evokes the great
Hollywood musicals of the 50s with sets that burst
with vivid color, production numbers as showy as any
Broadway spectacular, and a kinetic pace that patterns
itself after hip MTV videos.  And beneath all of this
pomp, you'll also find a moving story about "truth,
beauty, freedom, and love."</P>
<P>In the revisionist film, `Moulin Rouge,' story and
song boldly come together in a film about a tragic
love affair between penniless writer Christian (Ewan
McGregor) and beautiful courtesan Satine (Nicole
Kidman).  These two meet at the fabled nightclub
Moulin Rouge, where fantasies power its atmosphere of
glitz and opulence.  But when you return from your
state of euphoria, reality is hurtfully cold.</P>
<P>No character is caught up more in this state of
fantasy than the naive Christian, whom after
befriending dwarf artist Toulouse-Lautrec (John
Leguizamo), is given the rare opportunity to meet
Satine.  This encounter makes his heart sing,
literally.  He croons a love song to her delight ("I
can see you're going to be bad for business," she
says) but perhaps to the ambivalence of the audience. </P>
<P>Actually, McGregor, Kidman and the cast members can
all competently carry a tune, but their renditions
lacked brassiness or distinction.  At other times,
such as when our couple sings a medley of love songs
to one another, the exercise seemed nauseatingly
silly.  Indeed some of the musical numbers bordered on
kitsch (like the sales pitch set to the tune of the
Can-Can to persuade a financier to invest) while other
numbers seemed forced just for the sake of song.  Yet,
many selections were quite impressive and easily
acquitted itself of this complaint such as the opening
and closing numbers and a dark Tango set to Sting's
"Roxanne."  </P>
<P>Christian's state of euphoria may soon come to an end
when he discovers that the investor (Richard Roxburgh)
who agrees to finance his latest play also wants
exclusivity to Satine.  If she does not agree, then he
shall also seize the property.  Harold (Jim
Broadbent), impresario and owner, asks her to hurt him
for the sake of everyone involved.  "We are creatures
of the underworld," he laments.  "We can not afford to
love."  </P>
<P>But their bond is unbreakable, which leaves our
flustered paterfamilias making up brilliant lies when
the investor begins to doubt her commitment.  A
terrific musical moment occurs when Harold explains to
him that Satine has cancelled her date because she has
gone to confessional and then breaks into Madonna's
"Like a Virgin."  His character is by far the most
enjoyable of the cast.</P>
<P>While we gladly accept the songs and take interest in
the love story, what really holds our attention,
however, is the film's camerawork and inventive
visualizations.  The film's images frenetically
display the pageantry of turn-of-the century Paris
during the period when avant-garde artistry was at its
heyday.  The extravagant production ably captures its
festive mood, from the tuxedo-clad clientele reveling
at the nightclub to the melodramatic characters to a
scene where our wildly-in-love couple dances on a
cloud while serenaded by the moon.  It's a fantasy of
which we should all be a part.</P>
