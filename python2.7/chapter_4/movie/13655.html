<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        In my review of There's Something About Mary, I said something to the
effect of "laughter isn't everything."  I now need to make a brief
addendum to my postulate:  Laughter isn't everything, unless I'm
watching a Jim Abrahams film.  See, spoofs are easy with me.  I love
movies, and I love movies that make fun of movies that I love. 
Sometimes I'm the only one in the theater laughing.  Sometimes I laugh
so hard that I embarass myself because my laugh is so high-pitched in
comparison to my speaking voice (it cuts right through everyone else's
laughter).  Sometimes I laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the
end of the film.</P>
<P>        Abraham's latest film, Mafia!, induced this kind of hysteria upon me. 
It's gotten some mediocre reviews, but, hey, I'm the guy who laughs at
everything.  There may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film, but
there are far more that work, and I laughed so frequently that the
failed jokes usually occurred as I was recovering from the previous bout
of giddy madness.  I enjoy films like this because not one second of it
is serious or thought-provoking.  Most lighweight films that pose as
comedies try to do other things, like develop characters, shape stories,
and other such nonsense.  Mafia! has no pretentions about characters or
story, and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh.  </P>
<P>        The film begins on the perfect high note, with a mockery of the opening
of Casino.  Our hero (Jay Mohr) is seen walking from a casino and
getting into his car, which subsequently explodes and sends him flying
through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire.  To describe the
story of Mafia! is absurd and pointless, but I will mention that it
basically follows the framework of the Godfather films, with a lot of
Casino references inserted throughout.  Along the way, the parodies seem
arbitrary, and rarely victimize mob films:  pictures like The English
Patient, Forrest Gump, and Jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing.</P>
<P>        Movies like this rely on just a few things, but the most important
element is direction.  Abrahams has been down this path many times
before (Hot Shots!, Top Secret!, Airplane!, and any other film with an
exclamation point in the title), and so I hold most of the success of
Mafia! to his experience.  He takes just the right attitude in each
scene, and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most
oddly placed references (one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to
make fun of Titanic, but it never develops).  </P>
<P>        The actors are all energetic, which helps a lot with the tone of the
film.  Mohr (Suicide Kings, Paulie), who is quickly becoming one of my
favorite actors, is so good here.  He looks like he's having so much fun
that he's containing his laughter in every scene (watch his face in the
sequence by the swimming pool).  He's probably the only performer in the
cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material. 
Lloyd Bridges does a decent imitation of Brando's Godfather, while
Pamela Gidley is dead-on in a full-blown mockery of Sharon Stone.</P>
<P>        The hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that I'm supposed
to give examples of things and be specific.  Unfortunately, I was so
constantly blindsided by laughter during Mafia! that I can't remember a
lot of what made me laugh.  But that's a good sign:  Mafia! is so funny
that I wasn't even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory.  I
laughed so hard that it shut off my brain.  I know that doesn't sound
particularly complimentary, but when watching a dumb comedy like this,
the first thing I want to do is shut off my brain.  Finally, a film that
does this for me. </P>
