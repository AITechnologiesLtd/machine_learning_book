<P>Synopsis: Michel (Lucas) and his wife Claire (Seigner) are en route to 
their rustic summer cabin with their three unruly daughters. In a rest 
stop bathroom, Michel chances to meet Harry Ballestero (López), a 
childhood acquaintance. Harry and his girlfriend (Sophie Guillemin) 
finagle an invite to the cabin, and soon Harry has enmeshed himself in 
Michel's personal life. Are Harry's deeds truly as philanthropic as he 
claims, or are his true intentions far darker?</P>
<P>Review: "With A Friend Like Harry" is reminiscent of "Suspicion", amongst 
other Hitchcock films. In both, the plot builds slowly; although we know 
straight away that something not quite right is going on, it remains 
subtle, unpronounced and reveals itself bit by bit. The result is a 
splendid character drama, a guest-that-wouldn't-leave story that begins as 
merely creepy and becomes gradually more disturbing. The film's success 
hinges on the performances of its leads, and López in particular is up to 
the task. He lends a sinister edge to Harry: he smiles a little too much, 
lingers a little too long. But López is careful not to take this too far; 
it is not clear, at first, whether Harry is malevolent or just socially 
inept. Lucas, meanwhile, is very good in the everyman role; we can easily 
put ourselves in his place and wonder just how we would handle someone 
like Harry. Moll's direction is assured, and despite its sometimes mundane 
aspects (especially early on), "Harry" never lags. Like Hitchcock, if 
there are no thrills at hand, Moll fills the silence with humour -- but 
never so much that the atmosphere is ruined. Only the movie's rather 
abrupt ending disappoints, preventing what could be the intriguing 
fruition of the relationship between Harry and Michel. But then, Hitch's 
endings -- "Suspicion" included -- weren't always the greatest, either.</P>
