<PRE>`The Bachelor'  --  A Fair Catch
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>With the 1999 movie year drawing to a close, you can
expect the studios to start releasing a spate of films
that will be vying for the Academy's attention.  It's
Oscar time, so expect films to be more innovative in
presentation and weightier in storytelling.  But if
you're not in search of an Oscar contender, and
instead would be content with a lightweight, romantic
comedy for a Saturday night, then I would like to
marginally recommend `The Bachelor,' a saccharine film
where the cutest of couples inevitably find their way
into each other's arms.</P>
<P>The couple in question is Jimmie (Chris O'Donnell) and
Anne (Renee Zellweger).  And according to Jimmie, guys
have a strange way of looking at relationships.  Men
are like wild mustangs running wild through the
plains.  They stop for the occasional patch of lush
grass, symbolic to how men date different women.  Once
the mustangs are done, they move on.  So, it's
puzzling to him that he's been going steady with Anne
for almost three years.  What scares him even more is
that all of his friends are also getting married.  He
is the only bachelor left among his circle of friends.
 He is the only wild mustang that still roams free. 
Now, it's just a matter of time.  Soon, he'll have to
pop the question.  However, it is clear that Jimmie
isn't ready for marriage.  His gives Anne the most
awkward and wretched proposal that anyone has ever
given.  Indeed, his words aren't a proposal but rather
a declaration of surrender.  This doesn't make Anne
very happy.  She declines, though Jimmie somehow feels
relieved.</P>
<P>Soon after, Jimmie learns that his persnickety uncle
(Peter Ustinov) has passed away and has bequeathed to
him a $100 million fortune.   The only catch is that
he must marry before he turns 30, which literally
gives him 24 hours to tie the knot.  His desire to wed
quickly does not stem from the lost inheritance;
rather, the provisions of the will would force him to
sell the family business and put hundreds of people
out of work.  With Anne out of the question, Jimmie
searches out his old girlfriends with the $100 million
proposal.  One of his odder second-tier choices was
the deranged-looking Buckley (played by Brooke
Shields).  As she grudgingly begins to take her vows,
she keeps repeating `100 million dollars' to herself
to convince herself to go forward.  But she becomes
more rattled when she soon discovers that she'll have
to stay wed for 10 long years and even more shaken
when she learns that she must give birth to one child.
 She quickly bolts and the search continues.  This
includes a front-page article in a newspaper, which
leads to a very funny but sweet finale.  Despite his
need to wed quickly, he still wishes that he could
marry Anne.  But until he can internalize commitment,
that will never happen.</P>
<P>I am marginally recommending this film for two
reasons.  I enjoyed the final 10 minutes of the film
when 1,000 hopeful brides (and a few drag queens)
chase Jimmie through the streets of San Francisco. 
But primarily, it was because I liked Jimmie and Anne.
 Renee Zellweger is adorable and her smile can
brighten the darkest day.  Chris O'Donnell is also
affable.   They both exude energy, and it is their
combined charm that allows this movie to stay afloat.
`The Bachelor' is somewhat engaging but never
disappointing.</P>
