Rating: *** out of  **** (quietly affecting)</P>
<P>        Upon taking a seat at the theater, and surveying the crowd, I soon
realized that I was the only person under forty in the premises.  I'm
twenty-two, but have been accused of looking sixteen.  Yet as the film
began, any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five
close-knit, yet troubled sisters.          Director Pat O'Connor (Inventing the
Abbots, Circle of Friends) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss,
need, and the bonds between five sisters.  The family is ruled by Kate
(Meryl Streep), an unconsciously strict schoolteacher, who is completely
conscious of the deterioration of her family.  There is very little
background given to the viewer, as we are thrust into a tense but loving
home.  Squabbles take place one after the other, caused by years and
years of history.  Perhaps one of the best things about this film, is
its naturalness.  No situation is over-wrought, and characters react as
real people do, to real problems.  This probably is a result of the film
being from a stage play.  The play was in turn is based on a time in the
life of the playwright.</P>
<P>What seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances
of peoples, both in Lughnasa and Africa.  In fact, dance seems to be the
glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their
closeness.  Legs tap, and bodies sway even in the midst of impending
disaster.  Only after the music stops, and the characters stand
breathing heavily do we sense any trouble.  In the quiet after the music
we muse that it's sad that music has to cease, and families falter.</P>
<P>The movie is framed by a scene of Michael Mundy, the narrator of the
movie, as a young child flying a kite.  He trips over a bump and loses
hold of his string, and the kite floats off farther into the distance. 
Drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once
pained, and at another glance mischievous.  The Mundy family itself
follows a similar fate to that of the kite, and Kate's hold of the
family isn't strong enough to hold off the winds of change.  As Michael
stands, staring at his kite fly away, we hear the adult Michael, looking
back at the season that his world changed forever.  The movie is not
overpowering, but it gives us a beautiful window into the life, love,
and trouble of a household of lonely women.</P>
<P>Note: this is the first movie review I've ever written, any responses on
it would be greatly appreciated. : )</P>
