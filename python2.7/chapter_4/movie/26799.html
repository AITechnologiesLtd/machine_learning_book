<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>"Remember The Titans" is neither a great sports movie, nor a great movie
about race relations. Like Denzel Washington's last based-on-reality
movie, "The Hurricane", "Remember The Titans" is a simplified 
Hollywoodisation of true-life events, prettied up for the big screen. But
unlike "The Hurricane", "Titans" manages to maintain its integrity
throughout the proceedings, resulting in a superior overall product which,
while not the Oscar contender some have touted, is certainly worth the 
price of admission.</P>
<P>The setting is Alexandria, Virginia, in 1971. Due to the racial 
integration of the formerly all-white high school where he coaches 
football, Bill Yoast (Will Patton) has been demoted to serve under a new
black coach, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). He stays on only to ensure
that his white players do not boycott the season, thereby ruining their
college eligibility. Boone, meanwhile, has been installed purely as a
public relations move, with the school board ready to yank him out of his
job as soon as his team -- the Titans -- loses so much as one game.</P>
<P>The result is a series of fairly predictable set pieces. There are the two
leaders of their respective group of players -- Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst)
amongst the white students and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) amongst the
black -- who are first enemies, then grudging allies. There is the new
white player who does not subscribe to Alexandria's racial turmoil, and
the veteran Titan who refuses to accept the integrated team. There is the
inevitable growth of respect between Boone and Yoast, building up to a
crucial moment in the team's season. And, of course, there is the football
aspect of the film which, unsurprisingly, all hinges on a final climactic
game.</P>
<P>There is little new in "Remember The Titans" -- familiar buttons are
pushed both in terms of the race plotline and the football story -- but it
is at least handled well by screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard. Howard
keeps the tone of the story light without sugarcoating the racial tension
on which it hinges. There is irrefutable unpleasantness here, and not all
of it is resolved comfortably; consider a scene in which one of the white
players new to Alexandria convinces two of his black teammates to come
into a restaurant which refuses to serve African-Americans. But the
indisputable thrust of the film is toward racial harmony, and the final
outcome is sure to leave audiences smiling as they exit the theatre. 
"Remember The Titans" is a feel-good movie in every respect, and serious
scenes such as the preceding quickly give way to more upbeat fare.</P>
<P>Fortunately, even this material is well-scripted and amusing, such as an
increasingly hilarious game of one-upsmanship in the Titans' locker
room. Howard also mixes in some genuinely intriguing and moving subplots,
including one in which Bertier must choose between his football team and
his girlfriend (Kate Bosworth), who cannot bring herself to accept her
black schoolmates. Howard and director Boaz Yakin are fortunately able to
tone down the unavoidable schmaltz factor, keeping such scenes as the
resolution to the Bosworth subplot pointed and underplayed.</P>
<P>Yakin handles the directorial reins capably, and the material on the
football field is executed with particular skill, neither belabored nor
difficult to follow. He demonstrates wisdom in not exaggerating scenes
unnecessarily; a sequence at Gettysburg, for example, could have been
milked for all the patriotic, egalitarian fervour it was worth, but
instead Yakin keeps it subdued, almost subtle.</P>
<P>He is aided in this endeavour by both his lead actors, who concentrate on
their characters as people rather than representatives of societal
ideologies. There is an excellent scene toward the start of the movie
where Boone refuses to take Yoast's job away from him, because that sort
of thing was done to him at his old school. But when a throng of
African-Americans shows up at his doorstep to cheer him on in his new
position, Boone is forced to change his mind and coach the team despite
his personal preferences. Boone is not a noble campaigner for black 
rights, but rather a black man who finds such a role thrust upon him. 
Washington delivers a very even performance, accepting both Boone's
defects and his virtues.</P>
<P>Similarly, Patton plays Yoast as neither a stubborn redneck nor a
bleeding-heart liberal. His transition from being passively against the
integration of his high school to learning to respect African-Americans is
handled smoothly and without show. For example, Yoast's decision to let
his daughter Sheryl (Hayden Panettiere) stay at the Boones' house is not
treated as an earthshattering event, but is instead relayed almost
off-handedly, in a conversation with another coach. Indeed, Patton's
performance may eclipse even Washington's. Although Washington handles his
part with unsurprising skill, Patton has to convey a far greater range, as
Yoast makes the gradual transition from (broadly speaking) villain to
hero.</P>
<P>Yakin coaxes workmanlike portrayals from the rest of his cast, who are
mostly stuck in typical, formulaic roles: the jovial fat guy, the jock,
the religious guy, and so forth. "Remember The Titans" is sadly 
unambitious on this front. Very little true conflict is uncorked between
the characters, and is instead left to fester mostly with 
briefly-appearing cameo parts -- a corrupt referee, a local Hall of Fame
president, the aforementioned restaurant owner. When there is disagreement
amongst the Titans, it is, in general, easily dealt with.</P>
<P>This leaves the impression that bringing the team together wasn't much
work at all. This was likely not Yakin and Howard's intent, as it somewhat
undermines the tension of the film's opening hour. Indeed, viewers are
left wondering just why it took the rest of Alexandria so long to follow
suit. And while, in principle, this is a very valid question, the sad
truth is that reality is rarely so accommodating, and I expect the real
Titans did not come together quite as smoothly as this depiction would
suggest. It only works that way in the movies.</P>
