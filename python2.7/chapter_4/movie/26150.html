<PRE>"Bait" -- Leaves You Empty-handed
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>There's a lot that "Bait" wishes that it could have
accomplished.  It put forth some ideas that could have
been entertaining.  However, amateurish storytelling
and the film's pedestrian pace will ensure a speedy
trip into your local video store.  Look for it to be
prominently placed next to another similarly trite
film, "Chill Factor" (and there are an incredible
number of similarities between these two films that I
would list, but I doubt that you would have seen
either of these two).  This movie features a couple of
interesting elements, but as a whole, it can't put it
all together to make this offering anything more than
a marginally serviceable action film.</P>
<P>"Bait" begins with the improbable heist of $40+
million in gold bricks from the Manhattan Gold
Reserve.  Two men carry out this theft.  One is a
brilliant but psychotic madman, Bristol (Doug
Hutchison), who has the ability to break into and
bypass the most advanced security systems as if he was
hot-wiring a car.  This allows him to plan such a
daring robbery with clockwork precision.  However, he
has no compunction about harming others, whether it's
shooting an innocent bystander or setting off a bomb
that may kill hundreds.  And, he talks in this
whispery monotone, making him sound like he graduated
with top honors from the John Malkovich School of
Method Acting.  </P>
<P>Meanwhile, his partner, John Jaster (Robert
Pastorelli), is just some poor construction
worker-schlepp that he needed because he couldn't move
all that gold by himself.  However, when Jaster
finally learns how mentally unstable Bristol is, he
takes off with the gold and buries it in a secret
location.  This is not a very bright guy.  In fact,
sometime later that night (after he hid the gold), he
is stopped for a traffic violation and sent to prison.</P>
<P>His temporary cellmate is Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx),
a small-time crook who just can't make the right
decisions in life.  He has a good heart but not many
opportunities to show it.  Jaster's heart, however, is
about to fail.  And before it does, he gives Alvin an
enigmatic message.  Treasury agents, led by angry
investigator Clenteen (David Morse), are too late in
learning anything from Jaster.  But they suspect that
Alvin might know something.  Their plan is to implant
a tracking/listening device inside his jaw
(unbeknownst to Alvin), spring him loose, and wait
until Bristol makes an appearance.  And boy, do we
wait quite a long time.</P>
<P>"Bait" is a hackneyed production at best, but it's not
the fault of Jamie Foxx, who is amiable and possesses
a charismatic insouciance.  The real problem is that
the film just can't generate any momentum.  For most
of the film, we're just waiting for the bad guy to
show up.  Until that point, we get a handful of
tangential subplots, glitzy visuals, and some neat
editing touches, but nothing of any substance.  By the
time the 'suspense' happens, it pounces on you so
quickly that it's impossible to really comprehend the
moment.  Imagine virtually nothing happening for the
first 90 minutes, and then for the remaining 15
minutes, our hero must defeat the bad buy, save his
loved ones, AND find a way to dispose of a truck-sized
bomb.  Given this kind of dramatic arc, "Bait"
probably won't catch on with many moviegoers.</P>
