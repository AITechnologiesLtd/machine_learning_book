<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>The most disappointing thing about 'The Ice Storm' is that despite the 
strength of its characters, it is a tediously flat and unoriginal film that 
breaks no new ground in exploring marital infidelity, adolescents coming 
of age or the human condition in general.  </P>
<P>Based on the novel by Rick Moody and scripted by James Schamus, it's 
set in New Caanan, Connecticut in 1973. 'The Ice Storm' begins as the 
story of a middle class family headed by Kevin Kline and Joan Allen who 
have two children.  Kline is having an affair with his next door neighbour 
(Sigourney Weaver) while Allen confronts her own suspicions about the 
affair.  Their daughter (Christina Ricci) is a socially aware adolescent 
who follows the Watergate hearings with great enthusiasm.  All the 
adolescents in this film begin exploring sex, drugs and rebellion against 
their parental authority figures.    </P>
<P>After looking hard at the film what struck me most curiously is why would 
you make a film audiences have seen over and over again? Director Ang 
Lee ('Sense and Sensibility') tries to build a film with intense dramatic 
overtones with little or no music score, starkly bleak camera work which 
in fairness is appropriate for the depressing conditions of the main 
characters lives but although I enjoy motion pictures which don't have 
the conventional happy endings (and I'm not giving away the ending by 
saying this) this film puts no new spin on creating any difference in the 
film whether its the opening ten minutes or the final ten minutes.  The 
tone and character portrayals are unmoving for the film's entire running 
time.  </P>
<P>The only thing slightly unique about the film is the concept of wife 
swapping.  At an adult party in the film, men put their car keys in a bowl 
and at the end of the night, women fish out a pair of keys and go home 
with the owners of that set.  I once saw a half hour episode of 'All in the 
Family' which explored this issue in a deeper and much more meaningful,  
entertaining manner.</P>
<P>'The Ice Storm' isn't a bad film, it just didn't strike a nerve with me and 
perhaps that fact the its dramatic shadows are so hard to spot, it might 
have played better with a couple of re-writes.</P>
