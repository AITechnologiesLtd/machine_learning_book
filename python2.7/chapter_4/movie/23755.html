<P>   If you were a good-looking, sophisticated, but not highly
schooled woman of about thirty-five, recently widowed and
more or less broke, what would you do if you had these
options?  Alternative one: accept a proposal of marriage to a
rich, successful, stable man of about 60 who has been
appointed to a highly prestigious post in an exotic foreign
land and who you feel will never desert you.  Choice two:
Live dangerously and hang out with a handsome, dashing,
witty playboy of about your own age, who is married only in
name to a woman he will probably never see again.  He
promises nothing permanent: just fun, romance, and thrills
during whatever time you are together with him.</P>
<P>   You say choice two?  Is there a possibility that your
selection is informed by the fact that now, especially in a
booming economy, you can always support yourself and need
not depend on a man?  Absolutely.  You've made the right
choice.  Let's add something to the inquiry.  The year is
1938.  You're as good looking as you are now.  You are an
English woman recently widowed to a man whom you loved
but who turned out a drunkard, lost all his money, and was
killed in an auto accident.  But here's the kicker.  Women did
not by any stretch have the job opportunities that could be
found in America and indeed the West nowadays.  If you had
limited education, even nursing and teaching might be closed
to you.  You still say choice two?  Perhaps you'd have to be
in the situation to appreciate the desperation a woman in that
situation could feel.</P>
<P>   Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) was just such a person
in W. Somerset Maugham's novella "Up at the Villa," which
has been given a sumptuous treatment on the screen by Phil
Haas.  Haas is a flawless choice for a period piece of this
nature, having helmed the exquisite "Angels and Insects"
(also featuring Kristin Scott Thomas--in a story set in
Victorian England about a man who studies the insect world)
and "The Music of Chance," which featured James Spader as
a man involved in a high-stakes poker game with two
eccentric millionaires.  For his part, the late Somerset
Maugham has been no stranger to screen adaptations of his
own works, including "Of Human Bondage" (on every high
school reading list to the dismay of teens) and "The Moon
and Sixpence," the filmed version of an episode in the life of
Paul Gauguin which starred George Sanders.</P>
<P>   What gives "Up at the Villa" a quality above that of the
recent screen version of Graham Greene's "The End of the
Affair" is the credibility of the central character, Mary Panton.
Panton operates in no way by the mystical mandates of
Sarah Miles but is tormented by a confluence of pressures at
a crucial point in her life.  Living like Tennessee
Williams's Blanche Dubois on the kindness of strangers, Mary
shares an Italian villa in Florence at the invitation of her
long-term, wealthy friend Princess San Ferdinando, where
she indulges in the dolce vita of an expatriate community
composed of most aging British and American citizens.  She
has just received a proposal from Sir Edgar Swift (James
Fox), recently appointed governor of the Indian state of
Bengal, and a man with whom she can share a stable,
although loveless life.  At a lavish dinner presided over by the
princess, she meets an American playboy, Rowley Flint
(Sean Penn), who unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her and
is told in no uncertain terms by Mary that she does not
consider love and romance an important consideration at her
stage in life.  =</P>
<P>   Torn by advice on the one hand by her friend, the princess,
to be practical and go with the money, and provoked on the
other hand by the dashing Rowley Flint, the conflicted Mary's
life is turned around by a chance meeting with a poor refugee
from Nazi-occupied Austria, Karl Richter (Jeremy Davies).
Richter (performed graciously by Davies) has misinterpreted
her gesture of kindness and pity toward him, thereby meeting
with a tragic fate that would alter Mary's outlook forever.</P>
<P>   This straightforward, well-made tale, filled with
cinematographer Maurizio Calvesi's close-ups--which provide
a veritable atlas of emotions from the classy, photogenic face
of Kristin Scott Thomas--is played against a backdrop of
emerging clouds of war.  Mussolini's fascists are in control of
Italy and already in 1938 ominous commands issue from the
office of the local high official, the smooth and educated
Beppino Leopardi (Massimo Ghini), which are to impact the
entire Anglo-American expatriate community in Florence. =</P>
<P>Anne Bancroft shines in the broadly comic role of the
mistress of the villa, who at one point describes her dead
husband as bearing "a face so ugly that he scared even the
horses" and Derek Jacobi as the foppish Lucky Leadbetter
who considers himself lucky indeed if he can wangle an
invitation once a year to one of the princess's lavish
champagne parties.</P>
<P>   What a pleasure to take in an adult movie inhabited by
first-rate performers who convincingly play out a time that =</P>
<P>of their lives would be altered by extremist governments and
a disastrous war!  If you enjoyed Franco Zeffirelli's 1999
saucy "Tea with Mussolini," about a group of eccentric British
women, the Scorpioni, in 1930s Florence and the impact of
their livelier and more vulgar American counterparts in the
expatriate community, you can't go wrong with "Up at the
Villa," which is more focussed and appropriately charged with
just the right degree of unpredictable melodrama.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 115 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
