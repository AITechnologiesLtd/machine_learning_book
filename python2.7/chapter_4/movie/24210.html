<P>         Director James Toback fancies himself a provocateur, and from
the very first scene it's obvious he intends "Black and White" to be a
startling expose of what happens when white teens try to impress the
gangsta rappers they adore. The film opens with rich kid Charlie (Bijou
Phillips) engaged in a tryst with another young woman and Rich (Wu-Tang
Clan's Oli "Power" Grant), a thug who dreams of becoming a music
industry mogul.</P>
<P> What does Charlie want? She doesn't appear to know -- "I wanna
be black," she bleats when the question is asked -- and certainly
Toback, who also wrote this weird mess, hasn't got a clue. Maybe it's a
bout of adolescent rebellion, maybe it's her idea of true love, or maybe
she's just trying to fit in with her trendy friends.</P>
<P> At any rate, Charlie's not the only character in "Black and
White" who seems unbalanced. Toback also trots out an airheaded
documentary filmmaker named Sam (Brooke Shields) who's in denial about
her flagrantly gay husband Terry (Robert Downey Jr.); Will (William Lee
Scott), the son of a district attorney who's thrown away his life of
privilege to work as an errand boy for Rich and his crew; Dean (Allen
Houston), who dreams of glory in the NBA but seems to take all of two
seconds to decide whether or not he wants to throw a college basketball
game for $50,000; and Greta (Claudia Schiffer), an anthropology student
who behaves like some kind of double-agent as she betrays all the men in
her life.</P>
<P> None of these people is remotely likable or particularly
interesting, and only Scott attempts to make his character in any way
credible. Downey flounces around irritatingly, Shields does a lot of
squawking, and the real-life rappers Toback has brought on board to play
Rich's friends seem baffled by the director's free-form style, which
requires everyone to come up with their own dialogue while the camera is
rolling. Realizing viewers can only take so much bad improv before they
tune out entirely, Toback throws in a few gratuitous sex scenes and a
cameo appearance by a dazed Mike Tyson, who must fend off propositions
from both Sam and Terry. "No one ever expressed to me that I was
gorgeous or anything," Tyson blushes before turning down the offers.</P>
<P> Although he wrote a justifiably acclaimed script for Warren
Beatty and Annette Bening's "Bugsy," Toback has never had much luck as a
filmmaker. Perhaps you remember "The Pick-Up Artist," the movie that
single-handedly killed Molly Ringwald's career? That was another Toback
production. "Black and White," for all its arty pretensions and supposed
shock value, doesn't break his losing streak. James Sanford</P>
