<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  *** out of ****</PRE>
<P>It is hard to imagine today, but in the late 1970's, porno movies were
actually a lot like regular movies.  They were shot on film and shown
in theaters.  Marquees and posters advertised the latest X-rated
flicks in blatant view of motorists on the street.  You actually
bought a ticket from the guy at the box office, and walked into the
theater.  The problem was, you might have been seen doing so.  In the
early 80's, the adult film industry made a profound change.  Most
movies were shot on video with minuscule budgets, mass produced, and
marketed through mail order.  While losing the "artistic" quality of
larger productions, the increased anonymity afforded by mail order
resulted in a huge growth in sales.  After all, the only one who might
have known you were watching these tapes would have been your mailman.
Today, the adult industry is booming like never before, even keeping
up with the latest trends in technology; films are now available on
CD-ROM and even DVD.</P>
<P>BOOGIE NIGHTS starts out in the earlier era of adult entertainment,
when the filmmakers counted on star power to get viewers into the
theater seats.  "Exotic" film director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds)
notices a young dishwasher named Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) in a
nightclub and offers him a career in X-rated movies.  Eddie has
dropped out of school and faces continual verbal abuse from his mother
at home, and so one evening, after his mother (Joanna Gleason) crosses
the last line, the seventeen year old Eddie runs away, ending up at
Jack Horner's house.  To Eddie, Jack's offer is his ticket out of his
little life and into one of stardom.</P>
<P>We meet a lot of colorful characters in the business.  First there is
Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), a porn queen who lives with Jack, but
under apparently platonic circumstances.  There's also a high school
dropout-turned porn starlet who goes by the name "Rollergirl" (Heather
Graham) because she never takes off her rollerskates, even
while...ahem...acting.  We also meet Buck (Don Cheadle), a black
pornstar who is a hi-fi salesman on the side.  He wears
country-western outfits on the job and uses music to match when
selling stereos, prompting the store manager to ask, "What kind of
brother are you?"  Another one of the male talents is Reed Rotchild
(John C. Reilly), who's so insecure about himself that the first
question he asks Eddie is, "You work out?"  Behind the camera, we meet
Jack's set manager Little Bill (William H. Macy), who regularly
catches his wife having sex with other men.  Scotty (Phillip Seymour
Hoffman) is a set hand who is decidedly more attracted to the male
actors than the female ones.  Finally, sitting behind it all is a man
called "The Colonel" (Robert Ridgely) who puts up the money to produce
Jack's movies.</P>
<P>With such a cast of characters, there are a lot of possibilities for
some great scenes, and the viewer is not disappointed.  Take for
example, a scene at a party where Little Bill sees a group of people
gathered around in a circle.  He goes to find out what everyone is
looking at, to find his wife (played by real-life porn star Nina
Hartley) having sex with a stranger.  Little Bill demands to know
what's going on, to which his wife responds with, "Bill, you're
embarrassing me!"  Another great one is when Eddie meets Reed, and
each wants to find out how much the other benches at the gym.  Just so
one doesn't make up a figure higher than the other's, they agree to
say their bench weights at the same time, "on three."  They count to
three and there's silence.  Then Eddie says, "You didn't say
anything."</P>
<P>Some of the scenes involving the shooting of a porn film may seem
preposterous to the unindoctrinated, but director Paul Thomas Anderson
makes no apologies.  To his credit, the scenes are treated almost with
the factual nature of a documentary, and very few attempts are made at
colorizing the proceedings for the purpose of eliciting a laugh.  The
result is a surprisingly evenhanded representation of the filmmaking
process, with laughs naturally occurring at actions which seem
ridiculous to most, but which are simply another day's work for adult
entertainment employees.</P>
<P>Anderson does a good job at presenting us with a film about journeys.
We witness each character as he or she changes with the times or has
the times run over them.  Not one character is the same at the end of
the movie, and that is something very satisfying.  We even get to see
the journey made by the industry itself, in it's move from film to
mass marketed video.  In a great scene, Horner is taping in the back
of a limousine, saying they are "about to make film history....right
here on videotape."  Of all the journeys made, the most compelling is
Eddie's, who we see progress from dishwasher to pornstar "Dirk
Diggler" (the persona he assumes), his displacement from the industry,
and his decent into drugs and crime.  Wahlberg, perhaps still more
widely known as a rapper than an actor, comes through with a great
performance.  I look forward to what he will do in the future.</P>
<P>The real joy of this movie, however, is watching Burt Reynolds.  There
has been much talk about the Jack Horner role being his comeback
performance, and I do not doubt the truth to this.  Over the last
number of years, Reynolds has been playing mostly comical,
tongue-in-cheek type roles which shied away from the kinds of
characters he played in the past.  Although he has been quite amusing
in some of these cases, this has caused the public to in a way forget
that he is capable of really putting forth as a good actor.  Reynolds
is sincere, and plays Horner without the indulgence in which another,
less experienced actor might be tempted to engage.  It definitely pays
off.</P>
<P>There are only a few problems with BOOGIE NIGHTS, and only one that
really bothers me.  One of the major plot points is that Dirk Diggler
was easily replaced by up and coming talent.  This is one thing that
the movie got wrong, as it is the women who are in constant danger of
being the flavor of the month.  Males have a much better chance of
staying in for the long haul, often remaining in the business for a
decade or more.  The good thing is, if you didn't know this until now
(and I'm sure most people don't), it won't detract one iota from
enjoyment of the film.  Make no mistake; there is a great deal of
explicit language being tossed about, but most of the obscenities are
the words themselves.  Although there is a lot of sex going on, it is
tastefully shot and often more alluded to than anything else.  It
would be a shame if the subject matter dissuades you from taking in
this great film.</P>
