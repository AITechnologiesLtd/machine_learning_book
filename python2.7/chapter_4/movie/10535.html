<P>     Jim Sheridan and Terry George, contemporary cinema's poets laureate
of the Irish "Troubles," are building an extraordinarily well-received
body of work.  Sheridan's 1993 film IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER earned
multiple Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations; George's 1996
directing debut SOME MOTHER'S SON garnered many critical plaudits.  Their
earnest, well-crafted stories of folks caught up in the turbulence of
political violence have moved many viewers to heap adjectives of praise
upon their films.  And while all this occurs, I find myself sitting and
thinking, "You know, it was good, but..."</P>
<P>     Sheridan and George's latest collaboration, THE BOXER, falls into a
very similar category.  It tells the story of Danny Flynn (Daniel
Day-Lewis), a former IRA member who has just completed a fourteen year
sentence for his involvement in terrorist activities.  All Danny wants is
to pick up the pieces of his life, perhaps returning to the boxing career
interupted by his incarceration, but things are not to be so simple.  His
teenage sweetheart Maggie (Emily Watson) is now married to another
prisoner and has a teenage son of her own; Danny's former running partner
Harry (Gerard McSorley) is none-too-pleased that Danny has shunned his
former IRA friends.  While IRA political leader (and Maggie's father) Joe
Hamill (Brian Cox) tries to create peace at the bargaining table, Danny
makes his own small efforts to bring the warring factions together, but
finds his personal and professional desires encountering dangerous
opposition from Harry.</P>
<P>     There are always plenty of things to like about a Sheridan film, most
notably his ability to create a vibrant sense of place.  The divided
Belfast of THE BOXER is a startling image, with its physical wall dividing
the people even more concretely than the differing ideologies.  One early
scene finds IRA memberrs leading Joe through a series of cut-out walls so
that he can reach a party without having to walk outside; explosions rip
through the characters' lives without warning.  The insanity and
self-perpetuating violence of the Irish conflict are starkly portrayed,
with more ambiguity surrounding the question of right and wrong than most
films on the subject -- including Sheridan and George's own previous films
-- have managed to explore.</P>
<P>     For all its welcome complexity of theme, however, THE BOXER tends to
drift in the exploration of its main characters.  Nowhere is this more
evident than in the love story between Danny and Maggie, a star-crossed
romance which feels more obligatory than well-developed.  Furtive glances
and snatches of conversation establish tension between them, but their
connection is never entirely convincing.  It doesn't help that the central
impediment to their relationship -- Maggie's husband, to whom she is
expected to be unerringly faithful in support of The Cause -- never makes
an appearance.  In one sense, it's an effective device which turns him
into an abstract rallying point for the IRA rather than an individual
human being.  At the same time, we are forced to take for granted that
Maggie belongs with Danny, and that Liam's devotion to his absent father's
memory is the foolish stuff of childhood.</P>
<P>     None of which is to suggest that the performances aren't strong from
top to bottom, because they are.  Daniel Day-Lewis brings a resigned
dignity to Danny; his unwillingness to return to the IRA's ways seems as
much a result of fatigue than moral scruple.  Brian Cox and Gerard
McSorley do solid work as the warring factions within the IRA, and Ken
Stott has a few nice scenes as Danny's old trainer, reduced to a pathetic
drunk by the dissolution of his boxing club.  Their stories always hold
your attention, but they never engross the way great film stories do.
Perhaps my sense in THE BOXER, and with IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER and SOME
MOTHER'S SON for that matter, is that Sheridan and George are more
interested in making a point than making a movie.  The result is a
cerebral film with too little gut-level emotion.  Sheridan and George are
good film-makers, but they could be great if they were as attentive to
their people as to their politics.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 boxing days:  7.</PRE>
