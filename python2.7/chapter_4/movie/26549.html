<P>The Exorcist (1973, 2000-reissue) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Ellen
Burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason MIller, Max Von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb.
Written by William Peter Blatty. Directed by William Friedkin. Rated R.</P>
<P> Time has not been kind to "The Exorcist."</P>
<P> What was controversial and stomach churning back in 1973 seems almost
quaint today.</P>
<P> "The Exorcist" still packs a wallop, but it has been blunted because
over the past 27 years our senses have been assailed with images much
more horrifying - both on and off the screen - that our systems we have
been dulled to the point of numbness.</P>
<P> It is ironic that the most uncomfortable scenes in "The Exorcist" have
nothing to do with demonic possession; rather, they are the sequences
set in the hospital where poor little Regan (Linda Blair) is put through
various painful medical procedures to try to determine what is causing
her spells and outbursts.</P>
<P> Nor does the addition of new scenes help the movie; it only makes it
longer.</P>
<P> As a brash young reporter in Springfield, Ohio, I reviewed "The
Exorcist" upon its initial release. I said then that the movie was
overhyped, that it was nothing more than an overblown horror film. For
my trouble, the irate local theater owner tried to get me banned from
his movie houses. Not likely.</P>
<P> More than a quarter-century later, I still stand by that first
impression.</P>
<P> "The Exorcist" is a nerve jangler, to be sure, but it is neither the
first nor last word in horror films. I still would rate such films as
"Halloween" and the original "Alien" as much scarier outings than
William Friedkin's frightfest.</P>
<P> "The Exorcist" offers many fine performances, including Ellen Burstyn,
Jason Miller and especially young Blair.
Friedkin's direction is crisp and keeps the audience at seat's edge.</P>
<P> But, unfortunately, the movie does seem dated. The jumping bed, the
pea-soup vomit, Regan's spinning head, today look like what they are -
movie trickery.</P>
<P> "The Exorcist" still is potent in some scenes, but overall the magic
and mystery are gone.</P>
