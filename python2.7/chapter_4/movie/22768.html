<PRE>DOWN TO YOU
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>In writer/director Kris Isacsson's light-weight film, DOWN TO YOU, two
college kids fall in and out of love.  Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia
Stiles, the movie's likable stars, manage to be mildly interesting in a
film that almost never is.</P>
<P>The story has some intriguing story elements, but the director seems
lost about what to do with them.   And Robert Yeoman's bland and
uninviting cinematography doesn't provide much support to a movie that
could use some help.</P>
<P>Al (Prinze) is an upper classman who spies a beautiful freshman, Imogen
(Stiles), at a party.  Their initial exchange, with its excessively cute
dialog, doesn't bode well for the rest of the story.  Her name, she
feels obligated to explain, came from a name book that her mother used.
When she gets -- quite unconvincingly -- tipsy, she blames it on her
boozing style.  "I shouldn't drink between drinks," she tells him.</P>
<P>The movie's only effective moments are the frequent asides that the
leads give to the camera.  In these they seem to be honestly talking
about love, in contrast to their lack of much genuine chemistry when
they're together.  Stiles tries hard, but the obvious conclusion is that
she's better cast when she's nasty, as she was in 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT
YOU, than when she's nice, as she is here.</P>
<P>Much of the show concerns the many minor characters.  Al's father (Henry
Winkler) has a famous television cooking show, "Chef Ray."  His scheme
for his son is that they should create a "reality-based cooking show."
In a dream sequence we get to watch an episode as a SWAT team of chefs
descends on a typical suburban home.  With guns drawn, they throw out
the family's bad food and teach them how to cook better meals.</P>
<P>Another, and even lamer, subplot concerns Al's porn star roommate.  No
BOOGIE NIGHTS, DOWN TO YOU has the porn star spending his time in press
interviews, lecturing on college campuses and writing his first book.
His porn co-star is an MIT chemistry drop-out.</P>
<P>When the movie can't keep the romance angle going, it falls back on teen
movie clichés .  "What do kids do whenever they can't work things out?"
Imogen asks her roommate (Rosario Dawson).  "ParDEE!  ParDEE!" the
roommate fires back.</P>
<P>DOWN TO YOU runs 1:38.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual situations and
profanity and would be acceptable for kids 12 and up.</P>
