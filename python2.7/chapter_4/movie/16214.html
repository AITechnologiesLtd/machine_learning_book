<PRE>A Simple Plan
A movie review by Thomas Skogestad</PRE>
<P>(Re-)view January 10, 1999 at Cinemateket, Oslo, Norway

<PRE>Starring:
Bill Paxton as Hank Mitchell
Bridget Fonda as Sarah, Hank's wife
Billy Bob Thornton as Jacob Mitchell, Hank's brother</PRE>
<P>Directed by Sam Raimi (The Quick and the Dead, Darkman, The Evil Dead
series)
Written by Scott Smith, based on his novel
Cinematography by Alar Kivilo</P>
<PRE>Rating: *** out of ****</PRE>
<P>MPAA rating: R for violence and language. (The book however is, as I
remember, more explicit)</P>
<P>Expectation rating: A bit worse than expected (mainly because I found
the middle part to be a bit dull). Roger Ebert gave it a four star
review, and while he is a critic that uses the full scale, and I often
agree -- such as Dark City being the best film of 1998, he must have
seen a better film. I read the book about five years ago and hugely
enjoyed it.</P>
<P>The opening of A Simple Plan reminded me a bit of The Sweet
Hereafter. The landscape is snowy and cold, and is filmed what I feel
is in a rather crisp manner (which also reminds me of Fargo (which I
loathed)). One can almost sense the cold. But the movie far from the
eye popping delights of The Quick and the Dead, instead Raimi has made
a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better. This is
probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd
shots.</P>
<P>The movie also reminded me of Affliction, as the lead characters all
seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life
than their father, and they see a chance for such a dream to come
true. This chance is uncovered in a snow covered field, where an
airplane has crash landed. In the plane three men find «The American
dream ... in a gym bag.» Affliction too was set in a snowy landscape.</P>
<P>It really seems very simple. Just hold on to the money until spring,
and if no one claims it, they'll be safe to spend it and their hope
of experiencing the American dream can come true.</P>
<P>But the snow melts, and so might several of the character's hopes.  As
in «Return to Paradise», some of the characters are presented with a
chance to do the right thing. But doing the right thing might not
result in a better result than something more selfish.</P>
<P>The movie's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense. I have seen
many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from
the book visualized, eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent
story -- for example Clear and Present Danger. The biggest problem
seems to over-familiarization with the story. The writer perhaps feels
that he doesn't have to present scenes that are clear to him, but the
lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book.</P>
<P>This is definitely not the problem with A Simple Plan, even though the
screenplay is by the book's author. The movie is always clear on where
it's going, and always makes sense. I'm sue a lot was cut, but really
I can't remember what. Even a minor scene involving a man complaining
that he has paid for too much grains is included. The man only comes in
on Mondays, but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase
too many. Turns out ... well, see the movie.</P>
<P>One should be warned against seeing the trailer. It reveals several
scenes from the ending moments (which yes, like in the book, it is a
downer), several plot developments, and much of the beginning. But
much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer, so if
you're lucky, you'll have forgotten about all of this when you see the
movie.</P>
