<P>Isn't there some saying about avoiding all movies that have a part in them
called `jailbait?'  Or is it that you should avoid casting jailbait on the
basis of their parts?  Well, either way, when you have a movie like Me,
Myself, and I, which starts out by yelling `cocksucker' at the audience and
follows this up with a sequence where we learn of Buddy Arnett (George Segal
's) obsession with laying Lolitas, and then we are lead to believe that this
is supposed to be a comedy, we know that this is probably not going to end
up very funny.</P>
<P>And, like just about everything else in this incredibly predictable rant,
Me, Myself, and I performs exactly as you would expect it to.</P>
<P>Me, Myself, and I follows Crazy Diane/Sane Diane (Jobeth Williams), a
psychotic who believes that numbers are chasing her until she seduces her
next door neighbor, Buddy.  Life is honky dory for a while, and we see a lot
of Sane Diane and then Buddy has to deal with his estranged wife, Jailbait,
and other pains of living.  All of which makes for a cheesy melodrama with a
bit of multiple-personality disorder put in.</P>
<P>The performances are admittedly enjoyable, but the film's pacing is so slow,
it's style so off-Broadway that I feel more like I'm watching What Happened
Was… devoid of intellect.  Save me the trouble.</P>
<P>A few moments of humor are interspersed with a weak narrative, good
performers given bad material, and all of the other paradoxes that make a
movie so midlist that it will be marked off of my list, and should never
find its way onto yours.</P>
