<PRE>"America's Sweethearts"</PRE>
<P>Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) have
been romantic idols to the American public for nine films. When their
marriage broke up a year and a half ago, her career went down the tubes and
he ended up as a patient at a California wellness clinic. Now, with their
last film about to hit the street, PR maven Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal) is
given the task of bringing the estranged couple together, with the help of
Gwen's sister, Kiki (Julia Roberts), to save their careers and their film
(and his job) in "America's Sweethearts."</P>
<P>Screenwriters Crystal and Peter Tolan provide a modern romantic comedy that
is set in the world of the Hollywood "press junket." The last film Gwen and
Eddie did together is scheduled for its debut, but there are problems. The
divorced couple, both of whose careers are currently in the toilet, need to
make a show of reconciliation or lose their audience and a lot of money for
the studio. Complicating matters, the director, Hal Weidmann (Christopher
Walken doing a riff on real director, the late Hal Ashby), has taken the
unfinished movie, named "Time Over Time," hostage and won't let anyone see
it until the junket, not even studio head Dave Kingman (Stanley Tucci). Lee
has to do the most difficult juggling of his public relations career to
keep the press at bay and the stars conciliatory until Hal and his film
arrive.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Gwen's sister and assistant, Kiki, has quietly undergone a
change since her sister's divorce. Since Eddie last saw her, right after
the breakup, she has lost 60 pounds and is not just a nice person (unlike
Gwen) she has turned from an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan. Eddie and
Kiki have always been close and, now that he has been separated from Gwen
for a while, he begins to see which sister really is the one for him. The
conflicted romantic comedy continues until the big day when Hal finally
delivers his film and shows it to the studio heads and the press. Then, all
hell breaks loose.</P>
<P>I had high hopes for "America's Sweethearts" what with its stellar ensemble
cast and all. Julia Roberts is actually developing into an actor and does a
good job as the self-deprecating, loyal sister to the star. She maintains
the nice-girl persona of the character throughout the film and, when the
now-svelte Kiki binges out on a huge breakfast from frustration with the
whole situation, she does it with vigor. Catherine Zeta-Jones, as Gwen, is
dead on as the shallow, selfish prima donna - "People have no idea what it
is like being me!" she whines - and is as unlikable as she is beautiful.
Cusak does the bedraggled, obsessive actor with his usual goofy charm.
Billy Crystal moves things along (and gives himself some of the funniest
lines, especially when acting opposite a large Doberman), both as writer
and performer and he does good PR shtick.</P>
<P>The problem that holds "America's Sweethearts" back is the completely
telegraphed story. There is little doubt, for the viewer, as to who ends up
with whom and how they get to where they are going. The actors play their
parts well, but the two-dimensional machinations of the script prevent
anything more than the obvious from happening so, by the end, you have the
whole thing figured out. There is slapstick galore and one-liners abound -
the Doberman gets to do the best visual gags in the film - but there isn't
nothing' new here. A bright distraction, near the end, is Hal's
presentation of his visionary film, changed from feature to documentary,
much to the consternation of soon-to-be ex-studio boss Kingman. Alan Arkin
gives a subtle, yet riotous, cameo as Eddie's wellness guide. He's supposed
to be an Indian wise man, but he plays it so sharp he keeps you guessing if
he's Eastern Indian or Native American.</P>
<P>Direction, by Joe Roth, is perfunctory and straightforward. He does it by
the numbers as he walks his cast down the line to the films inevitable
conclusion. Costuming, by Ellen Mirojnick (with Jeffrey Kurland responsible
for wardrobing Miss Julia), meets the superstar criteria of elegance and,
for Cusack, despondent seediness. Production design by Garreth Stover,
especially the selection of the remote location of the Hyatt Regency Lake
Las Vegas Resort, suits the Hollywood star mentality of "America's
Sweethearts." The prods show the money is there and the tech staff uses it
well.</P>
<P>A good cast and expensive production attributes can help a film but,
without a solid screenplay to hang it all on, you can never attain
greatness, whether it be comedy or drama. "America's Sweetheart" falls
smack in the middle of this dilemma and suffers for it. It will draw a good
size audience and will appeal to many with its good-natured pokes at the
Hollywood star machine. But, it never rises beyond the level set by the
routine, predictable screenplay and I give it a B-.</P>
