<PRE>THE GLIMMER MAN 1996
 A film review by Timothy Voon
Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Steven Seagal, Keenan Ivory Wayans, Bob Gunton, Brian Cox,
Michelle Johnson, John Jackson, Stephen Tobolowsky Director: John Gray
Screenplay: Kevin Brodbin</P>
<P>101 Dalai Lama brownie points, and full marks for donating some of the
proceeds of this movie to the Tibetan cause - earning Segal the title of
'Tulku' (reincarnated lama); but all that glitters is not gold, and the
only glimmer in this movie is sadly a fish out of water.</P>
<P>He has chosen the oriental look, dresses like a monk with a pony tail,
has put on a bit of weight, but beneath all his exterior show of
Buddhism is Steven Segal. It was hard to picture him as the same man who
had played the knife wielding chef of 'Under Siege.'</P>
<P>The plot is even more difficult to comprehend. What is the possibility
that an ex-mercenary, turned cop, now becomes involved with a serial killer
who crucifies his victims including Segal's ex-wife; but in truth there
are two killers, also a wealthy business man trying to murder his step
son, and a partner (Wayans) who cries every time he sees 'Casablanca'
and eats 'deer penis' for his allergies.</P>
<PRE>Comment: Very odd.</PRE>
