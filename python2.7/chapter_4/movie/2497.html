<P>     The latest offering from the Taviani brothers (PADRE PADRONE and
THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS) is FIORILE, a series of four vignettes
interconnected by the common theme of a curse that haunts a family
through the centuries.  Since the late 1790s, the Benedettis--called
the Maledettis ("the cursed") by the peasants who accept the stories
about them--have been victims of a series of strange and tragic
events.  If fate has a sense of irony, it's on display here, as the
source of this family's riches lies at the root of their misery.</P>
<P>     The story opens a few years before 1800, as Napoleon's army
marches through Tuscany.  A young French officer, Jean (Michael
Vartan), falls in love with a local girl, Elisabetta (Galatea Ranzi),
whom he calls "Fiorile" after the French Revolutionaries' name for the
month of May.  While the two dally in the woods, Elisabetta's brother
Corrado (Claudio Bigagli) steals a chest full of gold that had been
placed in Jean's charge.  This act leads to the officer's disgrace, and
heartbreak for Elisabetta.</P>
<P>     One hundred years later, one of Elisabetta's descendents (also
played by Galatea Ranzi, to emphasize the familial relationship) is
given an opportunity to avenge her ancestor.  The target of her wrath
is her brother, a near-copy of Corrado (Claudio Bigagli again).</P>
<P>     During the war years of the mid-forties, another member of the
Benedetti family, Massimo (Michael Vartan's second role), must struggle
with his belief in the family curse while fighting to help the
anti-Mussolini rebels with whom he sympathizes.  Captured, then
inexplicably set free by the fascists, Massimo must live not only with
the specter of the Benedetti history hanging over his life, but also
the weight of guilt that he was spared when his comrades were killed.</P>
<P>     The final episode of FIORILE takes place in modern times, and has
Massimo's son and grandchildren visiting the old man at the Tuscany
home where he has become a hermit.  Their arrival opens old wounds and
forces him to face truths which he would prefer to hide from.</P>
<P>     The 18th Century segment of FIORILE is brilliantly-written and
performed.  Irony, tragedy, and romance blend together to form what is
by far the best half-hour of the film.  After that, however, the
characters become progressively less-compelling, and the storyline
gradually loses its appeal.  The second vignette is largely static; the
third manages something of a recovery; and the fourth goes nowhere,
doing little to close the "curse" story arc with a satisfying
resolution.</P>
<P>     The Tavianis have done some interesting things in this movie, the
most notable of which is casting the three main leads in multiple roles
to emphasize the intertwining of the fates of the Benedettis across the
decades.  Unfortunately, the brothers are unable to sustain the sense
of immediacy inherent in the first act.  FIORILE starts strong but
finishes weak.</P>
<P>     The cost of greed is not a new theme to the movies, nor is the
concept of the sins of the fathers being visited upon their children.
FIORILE weds the two together, but makes the mistake of presenting the
initial act far more impressively than the consequences, and that
somehow seems in large part to defeat the point that the filmmakers are
attempting to present.</P>
