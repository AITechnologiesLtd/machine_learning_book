Fiennes, Richard Attenborough, Fanny Ardendt, John Gielgud, Terence
Rigbby, et al</P>
<P>In one of the most engrossing history lessons I've come to experience
this year, ELIZABETH brings to life the tale of a princess who overcomes
the adversity of the Catholic Church, to become the greatest Queen of
her time. She is Elizabeth the First, Elizabeth the untouchable,
Elizabeth the virgin, Elizabeth the servant of her country. She set
herself immeasurable standards and never married. She rescued the
flagging English economy and pushed it in the direction of power,
despite being constantly under the threat of war from France and Spain.
Without her there may never have emerged such great writers like William
Shakespeare, for art flourished under her regime.</P>
<P>Her tale is set mostly in court, where the stuff of murder, intrigue and
deceit are woven into a web of suspense. We watch how perilously close
she comes to death, when her enemies had no greater wish than to see her
beheaded. Neglected by her father, the incorrigible Henry the 8th,
betrayed by her lover Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), it is not
surprising she clearly states that ‘I am the mistress of this house and
no man will be my master'. In this context, we are shown why the Queen
suppresses her femininity and does not allow herself to love or be
loved, for treachery waits for her at every doorstep. In a time when
women were deemed inferior to men, she boldly tells the House of Lords –
‘I may be a woman, but I have the heart of a man, if I so choose.' And
so destiny was paved, when Elizabeth proved herself a worthy ruler, by
choosing to serve her country above herself.</P>
<P>This is a fine performance by Cate Blanchett, a talented Australian
actress, who deserves nothing less than an Oscar nomination for her
portrayal of the Queen. Jeffrey Rush should not to be overlooked, as he
gives another solid performance as the cunning Sir Francis Walshingham,
the Queen's most trusted confidante and adviser. This may be considered
a slow ride for some, but so are novels and they usually read better
than movies. Like a novel, this story comes across more finely paced
than most of the rushed 2 hour jobs out there today.</P>
