<P>        Ellen Ripley died 200 years ago trying to wipe out a violent
species, she succeeded. Until now. Brought back to life by methods of
cloning. Brought back to life with the Queen still inside her. The
queen alien is removed from Ripley and raised for breeding. 'Special'
cargo is required for this breeding and science that is going on with
the queen and her young. But as luck would have it the aliens are a
bit on the smart side and they escape, and here begins the fun...
        Well you should now have an idea as to what this movie is
about, nothing spectacularly original on its own. But with enough
originality to be a good idea. The beginning of the movie is great,
really well thought out and really interesting. Then instead of
continuing along this line the movie degenerates into the predictable.
Its pretty well executed with some original scenes that provide some
interest. The plot itself needed a bit of work in my opinion, some
things seem to be taken for granted and somethings seem to happen for
no real reason whatsoever. I wont give examples for that might spoil
the movie for some people, but some of the scenes could be removed and
the plot furthered by other means. All in all the plot is fairly sound
and doesn't leave you wondering why things happen, but then again the
plot isn't very demanding so at least this job was accomplished with
some proficiency. The plot in this movie is by no means perfect
though, but its a good start for a movie. 
        The characters, being such an integral component of the plot
have to be proper. This is usually a given and it in most cases just
ignored.  But in the case of Alien: Resurrection I am brining it up,
because a few of the odd scenes that I found in the movie were caused
by a particular character, Call. I don't know what bothers me about
the character, but something does. I think that the character should
have been looked into with a bit more effort, maybe giving the
audience something more to grasp a hold of so to say. The character
didn't seem to fit too well, I am not too sure that Ms. Ryder was
perfect for the role either. But thinking about it I am not too sure I
could think of any actress that would have been able to do as good a
job. So I will have to concede that she was cast well for the part,
even thought the part is a bit on the odd side. The actual acting in
this movie was fairly convincing, especially Sigourney Weaver. She
plays her part with an interesting passion and wit, very good
performance from her. The rest of the cast performed well, and
convincingly in some cases much better than an action picture could
have hoped for. Although in the end the two things that I will most
remember about the acting and characters from this movie is the
character of Call, simply because something about the character
bothers me and Ripley's new found wit. 
        Having some thought about this movies there is something that
bothers me about it, I have tried putting my finger on it but with no
avail. The character of Call is one thing but that is not the only
thing that bothers me. Something seemed to be missing when I was
finished watching it, I don't get that sort of feeling from most
movies. I got the distinct impression that it was rushed and that the
director was a bit too liberal with his cut. I don't know if I would
recommend this movie to everyone, the special effects of this movie
were spectacular in some scenes and very appropriate but nothing so
revelation that everyone had to see it. SO if you are a fan of science
fiction flicks or horror flicks you should like this movie. Now those
of you who are not die hard fans of either genre, here's the question
you should ask yourself: Do you really want to see a decent action
flick that is a bit out of this world? if yes then you should like the
movie. Just don't come crying to me if you didn't like it. Its nothing
grand, its an action picture you wont get any grand revelations about
life from it. You should enjoy the ride. And If I ever figure out what
is bothering me about the movie I'll add a little PS at the end. Other
than bin a bit rushed with some oddities its an OK flick. You might
want to be able to stomach some gore though. This movie isn't for all
audiences, you should know if this movie is for you or not, please use
your discretion folks, its at most a decent action/sci-fi/horror
flick. </P>
