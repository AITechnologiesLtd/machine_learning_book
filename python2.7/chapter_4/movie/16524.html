<PRE>SHE'S ALL THAT (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Steve Kong

<P>I really wanted to dislike She's All That. I didn't even want to see it.
But, I was dragged kicking and screaming into the movie by my teenage
cousins. I'm glad that I saw She's All That. Contrary to my preconceptions
about the film based on the previews, this film was very entertaining.</P>
<P>Zak (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) is the coolest guy at his high school. He's
smart, good looking, and well respected. He's also dating the hottest girl
at the high school. He and she are about to be voted prom king and queen.
Everything seems to be going great for Zak until his girlfriend comes back
from spring break and dumps him for some TV hotshot. On a bet with his
friends, Zak tries to turn the high school loser, Laini (Rachael Leigh
Cook), into a prom queen. The story is somewhat predictable and has been
done before. But, it is done in such a way that it is quite entertaining.</P>
<P>She's All That is a movie aimed square at those who have recently graduated
from high school or are still in high school. I'm not in that range, but I
still found the film quite enjoyable since some of the situations will hit
home for many of us. The film is hip with its music and young actors.</P>
<P>The acting is nothing to write home about. But, it is good enough that it
kept me interested. The script is hilarious, with many laugh out loud
moments. And the writer, Lee Fleming, is able to write some sharp and witty
lines for the characters. This might not be Shakespeare, but it is good
writing worthy of watching.</P>
<P>If you have a free afternoon (and perhaps in that age range I mentioned)
you'll enjoy She's All That. Catch She's All That at a matinee showing.</P>
<P>[Rated PG-13 for sexual content, crude humor, brief strong language and
teen drinking. Running Time: 95 Minutes]        </P>
