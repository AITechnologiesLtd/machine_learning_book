<PRE>DANCE WITH ME
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     Get out those foot protectors, ladies.  The cherubic Rafael 
Infante, played with charm by popular Latin American entertainer 
Chayanne in DANCE WITH ME, is a klutz when it comes to dancing.  When he 
takes a partner on a spin around the dance floor, his feet have all the 
grace of a sledgehammer.</P>
<P>     In a movie with exactly two "surprises," one is that Rafael as 
actually an extremely accomplished dancer.  His problem is that he is 
not familiar with the more popular dances.  Coming from Cuba, he knows 
the rhythms and the moves of the local dances there, but in America, he 
is a fish out of water, or more precisely, a fish swimming in a 
different pond.</P>
<P>     The movie begins with the story's second surprise.  John Burnett, 
the owner of a cheap Texas dance studio, gives Rafael a job as a 
handyman in his studio as soon as he arrives from Cuba.  John bends over 
backwards to help him because of some unexplained sense of obligation.  
In the most underwritten of a group of underwritten roles, Kris 
Kristofferson delivers a bland rendition of John, an aging small 
business owner and fisherman.  The movie devotes considerable time to 
John and Rafael's relationship with little payoff in return.  The 
mystery of their relationship doesn't amount to much, and neither does 
the movie's unsuccessful attempt at poignancy when the secret is 
revealed.</P>
<P>     The other major serious subplot has the shy but charismatic Rafael 
falling in love with Ruby Sinclair, one of John's dance teachers and a 
professional Latin dancer.  Vanessa Williams, who plays Ruby, is a 
perfect match for the equally beautiful Chayanne, and the sweet 
chemistry between them feels genuine.</P>
<P>     These mini-dramas have little appeal and are not the reason to see 
the film.  People come to see the dancing and hear the music.  
Audiences, however, are likely to be disappointed as director Randa 
Haines spends an inordinate amount of time off of the dance floor in a 
film that inexplicably comes in at over two hours in length.  Why do the 
characters spend so much time on boat docks and in truck junkyards when 
they could be dancing?</P>
<P>     When the Latin music cranks up, the show comes alive.  The costumes 
are fun, and multicolored lights bathe the dancers.  Cinematographer 
Fred Murphy, regretfully, thinks it is his job to jazz up the picture 
with tight close-ups of the dancers' backs and sides.  This results in a 
swirl of images that blur into a montage reminiscent of a late Monet 
painting.  It becomes difficult to ascertain the skills of the dancers 
since we are rarely given the proper perspectives.</P>
<P>     In true formula fashion, the storyline drives toward the big game - 
dance in this case - at the "XXII World Open Dance Championship."  Ruby 
decides to partner again with her estranged husband Julian Marshall, 
played by real-life dance star Rick Valenzuela.  Julian treats her like 
dirt and even dances in a hostile manner.  In contrast, Rafael leads 
with his buttocks in a comical but slightly sensual style of dancing 
that has to be seen to be believed.</P>
<P>     Dance movies should be energetic, not pensive.  DANCE WITH ME comes 
alive periodically but spends way too much time with low-grade soap 
opera material.  Say what you will about the film, its two stars are 
charming.</P>
<P>     DANCE WITH ME runs too long at 2:06.  It is rated PG for a brief 
male topless scene that sent our audience into a chorus of hoots and 
giggles.  The film would be fine for kids around nine and up.</P>
