<PRE>TITUS</PRE>
<P>STARRING:  Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming, Colm Feore,
Harry J. Lennix, Angus MacFadyen, Matthew Rhys, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers
DIRECTOR:  Julie Taymor
WRITTEN BY:  Julie Taymor, William Shakespeare (play "Titus Andronicus")</P>
<P>If Tales From The Crypt had been around in the sixteenth century,
William Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus would have made a perfect
episode.  One of the Bard's earliest and least-known plays (written in
his formative stage before 1599), it's a nasty little tale of betrayal,
murder, and revenge that still packs a shock-value wallop.  In bringing
her stage adaptation to the screen, theater director Taymor (best known
for her Broadway version of Disney's The Lion King) admirably doesn't
shy away from these lurid elements.  In attempting to tinker with the
original play's ancient Roman setting, however, she has created a film
that is at once mesmerizing and preposterous, fascinating but ultimately
frustrating.</P>
<P>The story centers around Titus Andronicus (Hopkins), a victorious
general who returns to Rome with several prisoners in tow.  These
include Tamora (Lange), the vengeful Queen of the Goths, her three sons,
and her lover, a dark-skinned Moor named Aaron (Lennix).  All of these
captives will eventually spell disaster for Titus and his family.  In a
typically Shakespearean turn of events, Tamora ends up marrying the
newly crowned Emperor Saturninus (Cumming), and promptly proceeds to
take revenge on Titus for killing her firstborn son as a sacrifice.  By
the time Tamora and Aaron are through, three of Titus' sons are dead,
another banished from Rome, and his daughter subjected to particularly
gruesome atrocities.  Naturally, Titus is devastated to the point of
insanity, but he keeps it together long enough to cook up a revenge
scheme that would make the Crypt Keeper proud.</P>
<P>In terms of interpretation, Taymor's adaptation is brilliant.  She
stages scenes with a mastery that truly brings the play to life, and she
gets performances that are solid all around.  As the duty-bound Titus,
Hopkins plumbs depths of despair and madness with riveting presence.  As
the irredeemably evil Aaron, Lennix skillfully avoids caricature, and
Cumming makes a memorably snide and capricious Saturninus.  Lange, in
her first Shakespeare role, gives Tamora the benefit of her age.  In bed
with Saturninus and her sons, the Goth Queen radiates an almost
incestuous sexuality.  Despite the occasional accent slip, Lange holds
her own against Hopkins and the rest of the exceptional cast.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Taymor can't resist the urge to customize the play's
original setting.  While she isn't the first director to try it (see A
Midsummer Night's Dream), she does such a poor job that it nearly
torpedoes the entire film.  She seems to be striving for the sort of
uniquely indeterminate time frame that Terry Gilliam (Brazil, The Fisher
King) does so well, but too much of the production design is merely
clumsy anachronism.  Every time the story threatens to become totally
engrossing, a motorbike or an arcade videogame or a shotgun will
suddenly appear as an irritating distraction.  Worse yet, the character
of Young Lucius (Titus' grandson) acts as a surrogate audience
throughout the film, undermining the effectiveness of nearly every scene
he's in.</P>
<P>While these touches are more artifice than art, they thankfully don't
outweigh the film's merits.  Titus is worth seeing for the performances,
and for Taymor's confident interpretation of the dialogue.  Besides, as
the Crypt Keeper would say, "there's plenty of meat to the story, boils
and ghouls."  Heh heh.</P>
