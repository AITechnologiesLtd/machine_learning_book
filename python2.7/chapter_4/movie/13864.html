<P>>From the opening bloodletting scene, to the moment I walked out
(something I've never done before), there was a lingering feeling of
nausea - brought on by the sickening nature of this sordid movie. The
feel of dead bodies, morgues, necrophilia and lingering smell of
formalin-pickled anatomy parts, left a bitter taste - not your average
cup of tea. I hated anatomy and medical school left me with bad memories
of a stale, dark museum – resulting in a low tolerance for this sort of
movie. Feeling run down from a hard days work (equals - not in mood for
psychopathic killer on mad sexual rampage, killing prostitutes), was
probably another reason why I left early.</P>
<P>I laughed at KISS THE GIRLS, I shrugged my shoulders with indifference
to I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and ignored most of the
grotesqueness of the SCREAMS, but I could not tolerate NIGHT WATCH. It
crossed that unseen barrier of acceptability. There were two others who
made an earlier departure than I, so clearly I was not alone in how I
felt.</P>
<P>>From what I did watch (about half the movie), the story revolves around
a night watch man (Ewan McGregor) who works part time at a morgue, in
order to supplement his income whilst studying. His best friend (Josh
Brolin) starts to show psychopathic tendencies early on. He keeps going
on about reaching ‘highs' – and I don't mean drugs. Sex ‘doesn't do it
for him', neither do prostitutes, he is unexcited with fighting, leaving
him with a void that needs to be filled. When he asks his best friend
(McGregor) to sleep with his girlfriend, so he can get turned on –
warning bells startedto ring. In this trend, it is hinted that the
psychotic bastard only gets a rush when he's murdering prostitutes. One
can only imagine what he does with the body after! This movie is like
Jeffrey Dharma revisited and is best avoided all together. It exploits
the darker side of human nature, a territory that is best left in the
unexplored realm of hell.</P>
<P>The only regrets I have is, watching talents like Patricia Arquette and
Ewan McGregor wasted on such poor material. After, A LIFE LESS ORDINARY,
Ewan McGregor has only himself to blame for choosing bad roles.
Hopefully, his upcoming performance as the young Obe-Wan Kenobe, in
George Lucas' STAR WARS pre-quels will be a redeeming feature - ‘May the
force be with you Ewan.'</P>
