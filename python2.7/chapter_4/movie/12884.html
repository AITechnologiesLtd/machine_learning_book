<PRE>                           KISSING A FOOL 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                       1 :-( for playing the fool</PRE>
<P>Cast: David Schwimmer, Jason Lee, Mili Avital, Bonnie Hunt, Vanessa
Angel, Kari Wuhrer
Director: Doug Ellin
Producers: Andrew Form, Rick Lashbrook, Tag Mendillo
Screenplay: James Frey and Doug Ellin</P>
<P>Another day, another poorly made David Schwimmer movie. He ends up
making a fool of himself, but that's becoming a usual trend in his
movies. If you're the kind of person who likes David Schwimmer in
FRIENDS or who appreciated his performance in THE PALLBEARER, then you
may be able to tolerate this movie. Since I am neither, I will stand
back and be totally biased and say this was an awful movie.</P>
<P>Ever notice that David Schwimmer always carries the same persona in all
his acting roles. He just can't seem to get out of that annoying puppy
dog look, feel sorry for me, … duh … droll-sort-of-voice which makes
many women fall for him??? He's the kind of actor, that women probably
like to mother in real life, but has drawbacks in limiting your choice
of movie roles after awhile. Anyway enough about Schwimmer, before my
blood pressure soars through the roof. Let's just say that KISSING A
FOOL is marginally better than most of his co-star
FRIENDS-Hollywood-efforts, but that doesn't really say much considering
their poor track record.</P>
<P>The plot basically involves two best friends, Max Abbit (Schwimmer) and
Jay Murphy (Jason Lee) and how they end up falling in love with the same
woma, Samantha Andrews (Mili Avital). The story is told through the lips
of the ever-charming Bonnie Hunt, and the idea is to semi-guess what
happened and who ends up with whom in the end. It's all very
predictable, but I'm not sure how many guys will really appreciate their
best-friends ex-girlfriends after knowing how intimate they were in bed?
Can you still be best friends after this? In Hollywood you can, and with
a tremendous about of forgiving, forgetting and reading – all ends up
well in the rather foolish world of David Schwimmer.</P>
