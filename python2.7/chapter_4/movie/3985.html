<PRE>                                THE USUAL SUSPECTS
                        A film review by Christopher Null
                         Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     THE USUAL SUSPECTS, the heavily hyped new film from Bryan Singer,
is finally here, and with it comes the answer to the riddle posed in
its high-powered ad campaign, "Who is Keyser Soze?"</P>
<P>     Keyser Soze is a semi-mythical crime kingpin who ultimately
directs the actions of five small-time hoods.  With the promise of $91
million and the opportunity to keep their lives, the enigmatic Keyser
sends the quintet on a fool's errand in San Pedro harbor: to stop a
competitor's huge cocaine sale that would interfere with Keyser's own
drug operation.  As the film opens, we see the catastrophic results of
the mission.</P>
<P>     The band of unlucky criminals includes the classy Dean Keaton
(Gabriel Byrne), palsied Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), hardware
specialist Hockney (Kevin Pollak), entry-man McManus (Stephen Baldwin),
and the mush-mouthed Fenster (Benicio Del Toro).  Kint, the lone
survivor of the five felons, is quizzed by U.S. Customs Agent Kujan
(Chazz Palminteri) about the crime.  The remainder of the movie shows
us the tale he weaves.</P>
<P>     THE USUAL SUSPECTS puts some neat twists on the classic crime
drama, and it's one of the blackest comedies you'll see this year.  All
the actors nail their parts with ultra-cool finesse, and just listening
to Del Toro mumble his lines is worth the cost of the ticket alone.
Singer's direction is also completely on target.</P>
<P>     My problems with the film come from the plot.  The primary
difficulty is that the movie sometimes gets a little too clever for its
own good, the same problem Hal Hartley ran into with this year's
AMATEUR.  While it keeps you in stitches, the film takes its
multi-layered riddles a little too far, and while this is somewhat
critical to the film, it's still a bit much.  The end result is a
picture bogged down by the weight of maintaining an overdone mystique.</P>
<P>     The other "minor" problem is the mystique itself, regarding the
identity of Keyser Soze.  45 minutes into the film, I placed my bet on
the name of Soze's alter-ego.  An hour later, I won, despite some
rather unfair trickery on behalf of the script.  While the flashback
clues can be very misleading (a la Hitchcock's STAGE FRIGHT), they
never come out and deliberately lie to the viewer.  Regardless, it
still shouldn't stop the audience from figuring it all out, well in
advance.</P>
<P>     Despite all this, THE USUAL SUSPECTS is a funny, visually
stunning, and much-needed change of pace from recent thrillers, which
have had the originality of a Xerox machine.  I'm happy to say that
this one's no copy.</P>
