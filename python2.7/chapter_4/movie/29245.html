<PRE>THE OTHERS (2001)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
August 15th, 2001</PRE>
<P>I never thought anyone would care to make a haunted house movie with such
delicacy, vigor and intelligence as "The Others," but here it is and it is a
stunning classic in the tradition of ghost stories. Funny how two years ago we
were bombarded with a remake of "The Haunting" that threw all imagination to the
winds with its countless special-effects and histrionic performances, and now
comes a film of brooding menace and oodles of atmosphere and tension. Yes, it
can still be done with nary a CGI effect. </P>
<P>The exquisite strength of Nicole Kidman continues with her latest role as a
near-hysterical, icy, religious woman named Grace. Set in 1945 after World War
II, Grace lives with her two children in an isolated mansion located in a foggy
English island known as Jersey (one of the Channel Islands). Grace needs
servants to look after the house and places an ad. Presto! The next day, a triad
of Irish servants arrive at her house and are given a tour of every door and
every room. Grace is adamant about keep each and every door closed and locked at
all times so as to not let the slighest amount of light enter the house. The
reason is because her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James
Bentley), are allergic to the light to the point where it could kill them. The
servants seem to have another agenda though and, as it turns out, they were
formerly servants of the same house and know its deepest secrets that Grace can
hardly prepare for. Yes, indeed, it is haunted, or is it!
? </P>
<P>"The Others" is in the fine tradition of excellent ghost stories such as the
original "The Haunting" and the nervy "The Changeling," both dealing with
haunted manors or mansions where pianos seem to play by themselves, floors seem
to creak, attics are full of mysterious items, and so on. There is absolutely
nothing in "The Others" that you have not seen before but rarely is it done with
this much skill or panache. Spanish writer-director Alejandro Amenabar ("Open
Your Eyes") understands that subtlety and imagination pay off in this kind of
genre, and he does a superb job of creating an ominous atmospheric pull that
builds the tension incredibly until the surprising ending. </P>
<P>Kidman helps to build the tension with her shrieking fits and her frequent
hysterical episodes - her Grace is no ordinary heroine. She is fearful but
always in control and it is a delicate balance brought on beautifully by Kidman,
an actress who continues to surprise and engage me in each and every
performance. What is also rendered is Kidman's genuine pathos, uncovering a
gentle, human, loving woman who fights to protect her kids. Just look at her
mania episodes and contrast them with her vulnerable, sunnier side when her
husband (Christopher Eccleston) returns from the war looking like a famished
zombie. It is an amazing performance by Kidman that I hope is remembered at
Oscar time.</P>
<P>Alakina Mann and James Bentley are both excellent as the mature kids who love to
read but are also afraid of the dark - they can't seem to get used to it enough,
particularly the frightened Nicholas. They are kids who seem more mature than
their years, a rare find in this day and age of cute, cuddly tots with no
personality who never seem to mature (Olsen twins, anyone?). </P>
<P>The enigmatic servants are also well-portrayed. Fionnula Flanagan is the dear
old Mrs. Mills who caters to Grace's needs though she does question Grace's
behavior to her own children (still, Mrs. Mills makes a helluva good cup of
tea). Elaine Cassidy is the mute Lydia, showing more expressions of sadness than
I have seen in some time (she was the fabulous lead in Atom Egoyan's "Felicia's
Journey"). Eric Sykes is Mr. Tuttle, the loyal gardener. </P>
<P>"The Others" is not per se a scary film (though there are a couple of requisite
shocks) but it is an eerie, often frightening psychological drama, showcasing
Kidman to full effect as a tormented woman who will do anything to protect her
kids from the evils of the sunlit world. As she slowly becomes emotionally
unbalanced in her fears and anxieties, you also sense the house itself has taken
its toll on her.  </P>
