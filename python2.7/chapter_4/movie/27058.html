<PRE>Getting a little K & R
Proof of Life</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>An expert in K&R (Kidnap and Ransom), Russell Crowe endeavors to rescue 
a disconcerted woman's husband down in South America. Despite 
complications to this mission, Crowe is magnificently steadfast. Ryan, 
however, seems uncomfortable in her role as the hippie housewife, even 
more comfortless is Pamela Reed as the victim's sister. </P>
<P>No fault of Crowe's, following a compelling 10-minute 
opening/introduction to his line of work; a full fifty-minute lull 
abducts all but one moment of spectacle from film. Until surprisingly, 
it's the smallest of lines, "Okie dokie," that wakes me from my glossy 
daze. Another 10 minutes of commanding film from there, and again, the 
production eventually slides into messy back-and-forth dialogue with 
Ryan. "Who do you care about?" she shouts accusingly at the guy who has 
obviously come to her rescue. </P>
<P>A room full of thugs draw their weapons and yet, civilians Ryan and 
Reed, stand up and shout at them. I don't find that too realistic, even 
the strongest willed of citizens would shut up at the sight of a gun and 
hit the floor! </P>
<P>Then the story takes a short dip into uncharacteristic melodrama that 
sticks out like a sore thumb. Pausing from the normal serious dialogue 
and sparsely interjected action; Meg and hubby David Morse, though miles 
apart, express their longing for each other during a series of back to 
back dissolves. It did not work for me. </P>
<P>At the end of the day (that's an Aussie phrase), Crowe's commanding 
performance stands out too strongly against the backdrop of this 
awkwardly paced, off balance production. </P>
