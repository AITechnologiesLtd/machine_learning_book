<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   A film revolving around subject matter as morally repugnant as the
   mythic snuff movie is not one which will exactly inspire a lot of
   affection; not only will many find the material so thoroughly
   distasteful that a typical knee-jerk reaction is to reject the entire
   project outright, but even the more tolerant will find themselves
   immersed in a harrowing world of debauchery.  Equally contentious is
   that the vague undercurrent of hypocrisy involved in condemning
   sadistic voyeurs while neglecting to indict the audience's own
   complicity in partaking this inherently voyeuristic tale.  In short,
   this is the sort of edgy, unpalatable material which one would expect
   to find tackled in a more daring independent film, not addressed in a
   big-budget studio production starring Nicolas Cage. However, despite
   giddy overtures to the contrary, it eventually becomes clear that
   8MM, a picture which finds detective Tom Welles (Cage) and newfound
   sidekick Max California (Joaquin Phoenix) in search of a teenage girl
   seemingly murdered in an old 8mm reel, is unwilling to explore the
   iniquitous subject head-on and instead uses it as a basis for rote
   thriller sequences.</P>
<P>   8MM is the newest entry in an oeuvre of mostly unfortunate vigilante
   pictures by the Internet's most-maligned director, Joel Schumacher,
   whose effectively provocative FALLING DOWN was more than offset by A
   TIME TO KILL and his notorious BATMAN films.  (There's some irony in
   that 8MM, with Cage's grim, obsessive leather-clad hero and Phoenix's
   brash, wisecracking sidekick, captures the ethos of the Dark Knight
   legend far better than either of his two pictures in the Warner Bros.
   franchise.)  While it's difficult to defend his recent track record,
   it should be accounted for that Schumacher was working from
   screenplays by longtime collaborator Akiva Goldsman -- not the most
   promising of starting points.  (I'm not sure that even the greatest
   director alive could've made anything worthwhile out of the insipid
   BATMAN AND ROBIN screenplay.)</P>
<P>   In this picture, Schumacher instead works from a script from SE7EN
   scribe Andrew Kevin Walker, and while many comparisons can be drawn
   between the David Fincher picture and this one (in particular,
   Walker's morbid fascination with the grotesque), from a narrative
   standpoint 8MM is largely indebted to Paul Schrader's HARDCORE, which
   followed George C. Scott in a father's dogged search of his daughter
   into the depths of the underground sex world; similarly, in the
   Schumacher film Welles finds himself delving into the seedy
   underground pornography scene in order to track down the elusive girl
   in the dated film footage.  There's less of a personal tie here --
   Welles is essentially a mercenary figure -- but the story is given a
   paternal angle through an affecting performance by Amy Morton as the
   missing girl's mother, and imbued with emotional shadings through
   Welles' transformation into an avenging angel.</P>
<P>   The film's early sequences depicting Welles as an adoring family man
   with wife Amy (Catherine Keener) and a baby daughter carry immediate
   significance -- 8MM is less interested in establishing a background
   of normalcy than it is setting up his downfall, hence the cuddling,
   kissing and I-love-yous give way to uncomfortable silences and
   increasingly infrequent phone calls from the road as the film
   progresses.  With Amy as his metaphoric lifeline, Welles' deepening
   disaffection and hardening is revealed by his cold and distant manner
   as he spirals into the nightmarish abyss.  It's not very profound nor
   particularly subtle -- there are even overly explicit lines of
   dialogue like "There are things that you're gonna see that you can't
   unsee: they get in your head and stay there" and "If you dance with
   the devil, the devil don't change, the devil changes you" -- but it's
   nonetheless effective to contrast the stony-faced Welles blankly
   staring at lurid acts of sexual torture with the one whose loathing
   of violence is so pronounced that his screening of the girl's filmed
   slaughter prompts exaggerated cringing and horrified shudders.</P>
<P>   Curiously, Welles' screening of the snuff film, clearly one of 8MM's
   most crucial sequences, is far less effective than it ought to be,
   largely due to the failure to build an ominous mood of dread leading
   into the scene.  It's also not helped by Mychael Danna's percussive
   predilection -- if ever there was a picture which cried out for a
   moody Howard Shore score, it would be this.</P>
<P>   While the procedural vignettes which follow are competent if
   unconvincing -- Welles doesn't come off as nearly resourceful enough
   to trace the girl's path so handily, though clues and breaks in the
   case clearly pop up in order to expedite the storyline -- the
   picture hits its stride when it shifts locales to Hollywood and links
   Welles up with Max, a punky adult store clerk who guides him through
   the Los Angeles underground sex scene.  The film's strength is in its
   seedy, revulsive depiction of this shadowy world, in no small part
   due to the sets and lighting; in stark contrast to the almost
   wholesome, cheerful version of the mainstream pornographic world
   drawn out in bright colors in BOOGIE NIGHTS, 8MM uncovers the flip
   aspect of its hidden, seamier side, taking the film into damp, dark
   basements bathed in cold, clinical neon light.  There's a palatable
   sense of danger in these gritty scenes, and the frequent glimpses of
   miscellaneous S&M footage (surprisingly graphic for a studio picture,
   though no moreso than in, say, David Cronenberg's VIDEODROME) in
   conjunction with the bombardment of disturbing perversions help to
   create a thoroughly unsettling ambiance fraught with tension.  While
   Schumacher does not capture the same atmosphere of helplessness and
   despair as Fincher in SE7EN, this film is even more consistently
   gloomy -- it may not be perpetually overcast, but it's not nearly as
   jokey and only sporadically dabbles in humour.  During its
   exploration of this depraved underworld, the relentlessly bleak
   imagery of 8MM is effectively disquieting.</P>
<P>   Unfortunately, the picture slips gears shortly thereafter as it seems
   to lose its nerve and transforms into a fairly routine thriller,
   employing standard chase and fight scenes in a disappointing move
   which feels like a commercial concession.  Aside from an overbroad
   performance by Peter Stormare as "the Jim Jarmusch of porn" and the
   Scooby Doo-like revelation of a surprise villain, it's mostly solidly
   staged -- there's a sequence which momentarily rivals Clarice
   Starling's breach into Buffalo Bill's lair in THE SILENCE OF THE
   LAMBS for tension, and another which momentously hinges upon a
   decision, similar to the climax of SE7EN -- but it squanders the
   sordid tone in favour of familiar cathartic slam-bam heroics and
   vengeance.  The inclusion of self-psychoanalysis by the villains was
   also an unwelcome choice; while occasionally gripping (the villain's
   rant in the Fincher picture worked on sheer acting prowess), it's
   usually just goofy, and in 8MM's case, unintentionally laughable --
   when one unmasked villain meaningfully readjusted his appearance and
   launched into a speech about the banality of evil, I almost groaned
   aloud.  When Welles screamed "Why?" at his tormentors, I wasn't
   counting on such an elaborate and detailed explanation.</P>
<P>   Though 8MM's conventional latter half is substantially less
   enthralling than the scenes leading into it, the strong visual work
   of the picture is still reasonably successful in evoking a creepy and
   foreboding atmosphere.  Ultimately, the most disturbing thing about
   the film is how close it comes to becoming something truly memorable
   before veering back into safer territory.</P>
