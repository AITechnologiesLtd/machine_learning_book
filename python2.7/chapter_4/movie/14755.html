<PRE>                   CURE (Japanese with subtitles)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: A series of killings, each by a different killer seems to
have elements in common.  One killer may be using mind control to avoid
being caught.  A Japanese film with an effective concept for a serial
killer who would rival Hannibal Lector.  Rating:  6 (0 to 10), high +1
(-4 to +4)  Spoiler warning: nearly any description of the premise will
be something of a spoiler.</P>
<P>   - Director is Kiyoshi Kurosawa has done many films in Japan, mostly
     crime films, but this is first international film.  It is a
     different idea and one that is likely to be copied, or would be if
     it were used in a film that got seen in this country.
   - There are a series of almost identical crimes, which would point
     to one killer, but in each case the killer is caught and it is a
     different person each time.
   - Atmospheric horror-mystery.  Reminiscent of FALLEN.
   - Subdued color which creates a mood as effectively as black and
     white.
   - Pace is a little slow at times due to some long and lingering
     camera shots.
   - Detective trying to piece thing together in spite of personal
     problems with a disturbed wife.
   - Complex film with many things going on at once.
   - Slow but effective horror film with deeper meanings about mind
     control.  Themes similar to THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.</P>
