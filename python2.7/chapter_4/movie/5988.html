<P>     I'm walking on very thin ice as I prepare to discuss THE RICH MAN'S
WIFE, because in order to explain what is really wrong with it, I'm going
to have to reveal some critical plot details.  Sure, I could try to
tap-dance around it, but in so doing the context would probably still make
it clear what to expect, and I wouldn't have the luxury of discussing
particulars.  So I'm going to do something I've never done before:  I'm
going to encourage you not to read this review if you have any intention
of seeing THE RICH MAN'S WIFE.  Please skip to the bottom, where you will
note my less than enthusiastic rating, and avoid my point-by-point
analysis of how a rather mundane thriller can become an actively annoying
one.</P>
<P>     The title character in THE RICH MAN'S WIFE is Josie Potenza (Halle
Berry), the young spouse of wealthy television executive Tony Potenza
(Christopher McDonald).  The marriage is not a happy one, however, and
when Tony bails out on a romantic weekend for business, Josie seeks
comfort with Cole Wilson (Peter Greene), a man she meets in a bar.  Their
conversation turns to Josie's unhappiness with Tony, a problem Cole
suggests solving by killing Tony.  Josie bolts at the suggestion -- and
away from Cole -- but Cole decides to do the job anyway.  When he reveals
to Josie what he has done, Cole makes it clear that they are in this
together -- he demands $30,000 or he will tell the police that Josie, the
person who stood to gain the most from Tony's death, was the one who
arranged it.</P>
<P>     That is a decent enough premise for a psychological thriller, but
writer/director Amy Holden Jones doesn't begin to make it pay off.  After
an interminable opening which takes several trite scenes to show us how
unhappy the Potenzas are when one good one should have done the job, THE
RICH MAN'S WIFE introduces us to Cole, and any chance at originality
vanishes.  To Peter Greene's credit, he does the best he can with the part
as written, which is as a happy-go-lucky sadist.  If Cole is more
well-intentioned and genuinely obsessive in his murderous behavior,
Josie's dilemma becomes a more compelling one, one which might be solved
by brains rather than by gunfire.</P>
<P>     But there was never really any chance for that to happen because --
here's the big revelation, so don't say I didn't warn you -- we discover
in the film's final moments that Josie herself engineered everything, and
has been spinning an elaborate lie to the police.  Even though I smelled
it coming as soon as I saw that the story was set up as a flashback, I
still cringed when I saw Halle Berry smirk in triumph and get in the car
with her co-conspirator Nora (Clea Lewis, in a performance which
jump-starts the film with its only measure of intentional idiosyncrasy).
Not only had I been subjected to a mediocre thriller, but nothing I had
seen mattered at all.  THE RICH MAN'S WIFE is an elaborate cheat, and the
ending is an opportunity to dupe the audience into believing it had been
watching something unusually clever instead of something unusually lazy.</P>
<P>     "Ah," some of you must be musing to yourselves, "but isn't that
scenario he just described remarkably similar to THE USUAL SUSPECTS, a
film widely praised for its cleverness?  How is THE RICH MAN'S WIFE so
different?"  In one extremely significant way:  in THE RICH MAN'S WIFE,
the ending serves absolutely no dramatic purpose.  Too few critics of THE
USUAL SUSPECTS gave it credit for making Keaton's desire to go legitimate
a critical element in the resolution of the story; the final revelations
make him a tragic character, and there is evidence to allow us to reach
different conclusions.  No such evidence exists in THE RICH MAN'S WIFE.
If the revelation that the story is an complete hoax serves any purpose,
it is as an excuse for suspense cliches (see, that's what they would be
_expecting_) or for day to turn miraculously to night for added artificial
tension.</P>
<P>     There is a smug pseudo-feminism in Amy Holden Jones' script, a sense
that we should be inspired to whoops of "You go, girls!" because Josie and
Nora do in the obnoxious men in their lives and dupe more men to get away
with it, or inspired to self-flagellation because we have under-estimated
them.  But Jones denies us the chance to under-estimate them because we're
never allowed to estimate them in the first place.  She isn't playing with
expectations or with genre conventions.  She's playing us for suckers.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 business-as-usual suspects:  3.</PRE>
