<P>Blue Streak, while not to be mistaken for a cinematic masterpiece, is a
moderately amusing diversion. It circulates around a familiar
fish-out-of-water plot, has the regular cardboard characters, and never
does anything special with the formula. But energetic star Martin
Lawrence is fun to watch, and although a large portion of Blue Streak is
messy and poorly assembled, it's sure to be an audience favorite. You
could call it Rush Hour's little brother (without Jackie Chan, of
course).</P>
<P>The film starts on a high note. Miles Logan (Lawrence) and his burglary
team are in the process of pulling off the heist of a priceless diamond.
Due to certain complications, the plan goes awry, and the vicious Deacon
(Peter Greene) double-crosses Logan for a bigger share of the profits.
Miles is able to escape the surrounding police and enter a separate
building, where he tapes the diamond to the interior of a ventilation
shaft for safe keeping. It's off to jail for Logan and his associates,
but after his short term is over, Miles knows he's going to be a very
wealthy man.</P>
<P>Two years later, as we are informed, he is out of the slammer and
looking for redemption. He ventures over to the location of his
priceless rock, only to realize that (*gasp*) it has become a police
station!! Dressed as a nerdy pizza delivery boy with massive incisors,
Logan is denied entry, and informed that the only ones permitted are
those `wearing hand-cuffs or a badge'. Luckily, Logan has connections,
and is able to get his hands on a fake ID that will enable him to enter
the station and retrieve his stolen goods. It all sounds so very
easy.....</P>
<P>Logan's new partner, Carlson (Luke Wilson), is a bumbling idiot who can
hardly drive. Then again, everyone in the police force must have a very
unflattering IQ to actually believe that Lawrence is indeed a dedicated
cop, despite the fact he has no past records on file. These people are
so stupid that they actually promote the impostor to lead detective in
the burglary division. They call him a `super cop', even though he
hasn't a clue what a P-31 is. And naturally, Logan continues to dig
himself deeper into the unbelievable mess while attempting to locate his
diamond.</P>
<P>Blue Streak never breaks formula, but it delivers the goods in a
reasonable fashion. The situation develops nicely and often blends
seamlessly to the audience's liking. The comedy is inconsistent, to say
the least, but when director Les Mayfield (Flubber) is on target, there
are some fireworks. In the supporting category, Peter Greene is
completely under-used in the psychotic bad guy role, and motor-mouth
David Chappelle has the effect of fingernails across a blackboard. Only
Wilson and William Forsythe, as another hard-nosed cop, register
alongside the star.</P>
<P>Which brings us to Martin Lawrence, who injects energy into the plot
like bursts of Ritlin. If you hate Lawrence and everything he does, do
not even consider seeing Blue Streak. It is a Martin Lawrence movie,
where everyone else plays second fiddle. But if you have a special place
in your heart for the comic and enjoy his goofy shtick, you are going to
have a lot of fun. The star is enthusiastic and likable, and rarely
shows signs of desperation even with the occasionally weak material.</P>
<P>There is also a healthy dose of action, well choreographed by Mayfield
and the remaining technical team. In-between gags there are breathless
car-chases, all of which exist for the purpose of making us forget the
mediocre plot and dialogue. Do they succeed? It all depends on whether
you enjoy this kind of thing. I was diverted enough by Lawrence's
abounding energy that I dismissed the gaping plot holes, sat back, and
had some fun. Despite all of it's flaws and an unsatisfying wrap-up,
Blue Streak never loses the ability to entertain.</P>
