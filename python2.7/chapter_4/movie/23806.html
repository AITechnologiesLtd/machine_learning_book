<P>Starring Paul Campbell, Mark Danvers, Carl Bradshaw, Audrey Reid.
Directed by Chris Browne Not Rated (R-equivalent for sex, drug use and
gun violence).</P>
<P>The island of Jamaica hasn't exactly embraced the film industry. The
Internet Movie Database lists only ten films that have come from
Jamaica; just 3 in the past ten years. The latest is called Third World
Cop, a drama with a simple, appealing story but dreadful execution. The
film's defenders may chalk it up to the film's low budget but far
better movies have been made for much less money. In an age where you
can make an acclaimed movie for less than the price of a Ford Taurus,
filmmakers need a better excuse.</P>
<P>"Capone," a renegade cop whose gun "doesn't respect anyone" is
transferred to the violent city of Kingston, Jamaica (but not before
his supervisor gets to tell him "Your methods may be effective, but
they're not always right!") There, he reunites with his childhood
buddy "Ratty" (Mark Danvers) and makes himself useful by fighting a
local gun-smuggling operation led by thug Wonie (Carl Bradshaw). He
does this by shooting pretty much everyone he catches.</P>
<P>He soon discovers that his friend Ratty is Wonie's right-hand man. He
must now decide whether to stand by his convictions and bust his friend
or to turn the other cheek and preserve a lifelong friendship. There's
also Capone's childhood sweetheart who is friends with both men. She
can do nothing but stand by and watch her friends destroy each other.</P>
<P>The plot is simple, fast and to the point. There's little filler, few
significant supporting characters and minimal exposition. But despite
the alluring straightforwardness of the story, virtually all other
aspects of Third World Cop leave a lot to be desired. The script is
almost unbearable, piling cliché on top of cliché until we're left with
dialogue straight out of "The Screenwriter's Guide to Cop Dramas." My
personal favorite: after getting into about 15 shootouts, Capone comes
up to his friend and says "Guns only lead to self-destruction."</P>
<P>Paul Campbell, apparently a huge star in Jamaica, is passable as the
title character, even though the same "menacing" expression never
leaves his face. He's flawlessly suited to the role, which requires him
to talk minimally but be able to wield two firearms at a time. I also
liked Mark Danvers, who evokes sympathy despite dialogue that made me
want to slap him. As for Carl Bradshaw, the film's most seasoned actor,
well, he's just irritating as the villain, comical rather than
dangerous.</P>
<P>The movie was directed by Chris Browne and shot on video rather than
film. Browne has worked as camera assistant on many high-profile
American films, though this is his first venture to the director's
chair. He did not write the movie, so the blame does not lie with him;
as a matter of fact he did a relatively excellent job considering that
he didn't use film. The camerawork is unaffected by the medium.</P>
<P>Third World Cop's press kit proclaims the movie to be "Jamaica's
biggest blockbuster," saying that "more than 10% of the adult
population in Jamaica saw the film." This is probably good -- I welcome
anything that encourages a country to make itself a presence in the
film industry. I wish Jamaica could have chosen a better movie to be
their breakthrough but, as Third World Cop's characters say, "Respect."
For people who have not seen a lot of movies and are unfamiliar with
their conventions, it might even prove to be a serviceable experience.
For American audiences, however, there are better alternatives.</P>
