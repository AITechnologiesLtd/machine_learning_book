<P>PLOT:
A group of high school kids suspect the grade's sharpest students, known as
the Blue Ribbons, to be controlled or programmed from another source other
than themselves. And as more and more students join the unique group, a
couple of rebellious kids take on the task of getting to the bottom of this
strange mystery.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Creepy, escapist thrill-show, this movie takes elements from the STEPFORD
WIVES and CLOCKWORK ORANGE (9/10), mixes in some hip, young stars, a rockin'
soundtrack, and an interesting enough premise to fill its overly short 80
minute runtime. I haven't found myself thinking this much of late, but this
is one film that could've used another 20 minutes of so, to further develop
its interesting premise, and add onto its simple conclusion. It might've
turned the movie into something more than what it is now, which is a decent
thrill-ride, entertaining enough to enjoy, but shallow enough not to take
too seriously. Do you have 80 minutes to give up in your life, to watch a
dark, moody presentation shown over an alternative soundtrack, and Katie
Holmes in many a tight top? If you do, then check this puppy out, otherwise,
see one of the originals which I compared it to before, or better yet, check
into another one of screenwriter Scott Rosenberg's creations via THINGS TO
DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD (7/10) or BEAUTIFUL GIRLS (8.5/10). Nick
Stahl's performance as the paranoid pothead with the overly literate tongue
was the only one to stick out in my mind (He went on to a bit part in
Terrence Malick's THE THIN RED LINE (6.5/10).</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Screenwriter Scott Rosenberg has a pen for the unique genres, as his first
three screenplays comprised of a quirky crime flick a la THING TO DO IN
DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD, a romantic coming-of-adult-age drama, BEAUTIFUL
GIRLS (8.5/10) and the summer action blockbuster, CONAIR (6.5/10),
respectively.
The actor who plays the janitor in this film also played the role of the
Grim Reaper in 1991's BILLS AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. His name is William
Sadler.</P>
