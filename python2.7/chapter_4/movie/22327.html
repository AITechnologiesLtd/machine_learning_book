<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Fleg (George Sanders) is a gentleman rare book collector, willing to do
anything in his pursuit of collecting rare books, which includes forgery
and murder. His partner is the attractive Myra Blandy (Gail Patrick), an
equally treacherous conspirator, who is capable of doing almost anything
to make money dishonestly.This offbeat suspense story, with some romance
thrown in, is a fast-moving crime caper, taking place mostly in a
library.</P>
<P>Fleg while visiting the library to look at the rare Richard Burbage
edition of Shakespeare's Hamlet kept under glass, kills the library
guard and steals the valuable folio. Instead of selling it outright, he
forges copies of it and has his associate, Myra, set up the book deals
to sell the forgeries as originals. Against his wishes, she sells the
forgery to Martin Cleever (Sidney Blackmer). Fleg warns her to give him
back his money, that he works for the Nazi Gestapo collecting rare works
of art and he will kill them if he feels he has been cheated.</P>
<P>But Myra sees a way out of her dilemma when a private detective from New
York, Hal McByrne (Denning), who is working for a client she indirectly
cheated in the states, tells her he is onto her little swindle. She
seems to be caught with two bad choices, get killed by Cleever's men or
go to jail through McByrne. But leave it to Myra, she flirts with the
womanizing detective and strikes a deal with him, whereas he will shield
her from being involved in the scam. She thereby uses him romantically
only as a way out her dilemma; and, at the same time, strikes a deal
with Cleever, pretending to help him find Fleg. She  tells him that
McByrne is really Fleg and sets it up so that they will meet in the
library.</P>
<P>The carefully woven plot takes place right before closing time in the
library, as Myra tries to kill two birds with one stone, by getting
Cleever to try and kill McByrne when she gets him to go to the library
to get a book for her. The story gets further complicated when Fleg also
comes to the library posing as a phony policeman, accompanied by his
entire gang posing as cops. He keeps everyone locked in the library, as
he puts himself in charge of the murder investigation.</P>
<P>The library scene results in a few murders taking place, with Nazis and
crooks running after each other, some more rare books being stolen,
romantic entanglements becoming complicated between McByrne's and Fleg's
romance with the duplicitous Myra, and with McByrne also meeting an
innocent and attractive librarian, whom he falls for, Kay Ryan (Lynne
Roberts); and, to add further confusion and air raid takes place, as the
library goes dark in the middle of the bogus murder investigation.</P>
<P>It's a spirited film, with enough cheap Freudian explanations about the
forger and his associate to keep you in stitches with its Freudianisms.
Sanders's typical suave and maniacal performance, plus the B&W noir-like
lighting for the film, give it a mysterious look, and the many twists in
the plot and its unusual location, make it a better- than- usual
B-movie.</P>
