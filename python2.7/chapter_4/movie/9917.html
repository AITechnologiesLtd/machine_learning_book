<PRE>ANASTASIA (1997) (*** out of 4)</PRE>
<P>The Disney juggernaut has long held dominion over the feature film
animation market in Hollywood. It's reached the point of most Americans
equating animation itself with Disney. And try as they might, no other 
film
studio in Hollywood has been able to produce an animated film that could
legitimately challenge Disney's monopoly.</P>
<PRE>Until now.</PRE>
<P>ANASTASIA is such a contender, the end result of years of effort by former
Disney animators Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, and a Disney-sized budget
provided by Twentieth-Century Fox. While neither innovative nor
groundbreaking, this film demonstrates, beyond any doubt, that Disney's
days as sole producer of feature animation in Hollywood are over.</P>
<P>Loosely based in history, ANASTASIA is the tale of the purported surviving
daughter of Czar Nicholas II of Russia, but historical accuracy is not an
element of this story, nor is it necessary. And while comparisons to the
classic film of this story starring Ingrid Bergman are inevitable, they
really aren't appropriate, as the theme and focus of this adaptation are
quite different from that of the earlier effort. The Bergman film was a
mystery, a high drama: was the girl really the heir to the Russian empire,
or was she a fraud? This animated version, on the other hand, is presented
as a grand romantic adventure, a fairy tale, and a comedy of errors.</P>
<P>Two key twists in the history are all that was needed to create the
fairy-tale atmosphere of this story. First, the mystery element was
removed; we, the audience, know from the very start that Anya (Meg Ryan) 
is
indeed the real Anastasia. Second, a villain was created, since you simply
can't have a fairy tale these days without a villain (Disney used the same
alteration in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, another tale which originally did not
have a villain). The convenient historical character to become the villain
was Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd), the monk and mystic who was once an
adviser to Czar Nicholas. In history, Rasputin did fall out of favor with
the court, and reportedly did curse the Romanoff family, but he was
otherwise not involved in the demise of the royal family. In the film's
version, Rasputin sells his soul for the magic needed to make his curse
felt.</P>
<P>And that curse is felt quickly. The rabble rioting through the palace
manage to capture nearly all of the royal family. Only the Dowager Empress
Marie (Angela Landsbury) and Anastasia, Nicholas's youngest daughter,
escape, thanks to the help of Dimitri, a servant boy in the palace.
Unfortunately, Marie and Anastasia are separated in the escape, and Marie
goes on to Paris, wondering what happened to her granddaughter.</P>
<P>Ten years later, Anastasia (now known only as Anya) is living in an
orphanage in Russia with no memories of her royal childhood. An impulse to
find her past (and the urgings of a stray dog) leads her to St. 
Petersburg,
where she meets Dimitri (John Cusack), who is now auditioning girls to
present to the Dowager Empress. It seems that Marie, desperate to find her
granddaughter, has offered a reward of ten million rubles to whomever can
reunite her with Anastasia. Struck by Anya's resemblance to palace
portraits of the young princess, Dimitri convinces Anya to go with him to
Paris to meet the Empress. Meanwhile, Rasputin's long-dormant curse has
been awakened by Anya's return to St. Petersburg, and the evil monk,
languishing in limbo, revives to finish off the Romanoff family once and
for all.</P>
<P>There is nothing new about this kind of story; long-lost heirs and
forgotten pasts are staples of epic romantic adventure. And there is never
any real suspense in this film, as it is obvious from the first that Anya
will be revealed at the end to be the real Anastasia, and Rasputin's curse
will be defeated. But, just as when traveling to places one has visited
before, the enjoyment is not so much in discovering the destination as it
is in finding out how one will get there this time.</P>
<P>Technically, the film has much the same flaws as Disney's recent animated
features, but more so. Effects, backgrounds, and props animation is
excellent, aided by modern computer techniques, but their photo-realism is
distracting when the animated characters are placed in the middle. In some
scenes, the mismatch between characters and props is so great it's
laughable, with props not moving in sync with the characters manipulating
them. And the character designs are very inconsistent, with faces changing
shape right before our eyes as the camera moves around. The only plus of
this inconsistency is that the variations make it clear that all the cels
were actually drawn individually, not photocopied or reused as seems to be
the fashion at other animation houses in Hollywood.</P>
<P>Just as with most of Disney's animated features, the performances of the
supporting actors in ANASTASIA are much more interesting than those of the
leads. Ryan and Cusack are passable, though bland, in their roles, but
Landsbury and Kelsey Grammer (as Dimitri's partner Vladimir) are more
entertaining and authentic. And the songs, while mostly sticking to a
fairly authentic vintage Broadway style, do occasionally fall into the
modern pop stylings that have plagued recent Disney musicals.</P>
<P>In fact, the real strength of ANASTASIA as a challenger to Disney's
dominance is not so much in what it does better than Disney as it is in 
how
well Disney's own strengths and weaknesses have been copied. Had Disney
continued its animated features in the same direction where THE LITTLE
MERMAID and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST led, ANASTASIA is the sort of film which
might have come next.</P>
<P>Despite all its flaws, ANASTASIA is a film which is very difficult to not
be enchanted by. Its formulaic characters and plot are the same archetypes
which brought Disney into its Second Golden Age, and so it should appeal 
to
the same audience. In the hearts of many American filmgoers, predictable
epic romance will never go out of style.</P>
