A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: John Bruno</PRE>
<P>Written by: Chuck Pfarrer and Dennis Feldman, adapted from the Dark
Horse comic VIRUS</P>
<P>Starring: Jamie Lee Curtis, William Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, and
Joanna Pacula</P>
<P>Ingredients: alien creature, troop of well armed crew members being
stalked</P>
<P>Synopsis:
With their tugboat damaged by a hurricane, the tugboat crew seeks refuge
in the eye of the storm, only to find another ship there: a huge,
deserted Russian space research vessel called the Volkov, equipped with
dozens of machine rooms and mechanized labs. Exploring the Volkov, the
tugboat crew comes upon the scientist Nadia (Joanna Pacula), the frantic
sole survivor of some sort of massacre. Nadia claims that an electronic
life form has invaded the ship by satellite and that the alien is using
the Volkov's power and labs to manufacture cyborg-like creatures in an
attempt to destroy mankind. The alien life form uses humans for spare
parts.</P>
<P>Of course nobody believes Nadia until people start disappearing and
showing up as spare parts on robotic attackers. Can Foster (Jamie Lee
Curtis), Steve (William Baldwin), and the others defeat the alien aboard
the Volkov before it takes over the world? Lucky for them the scientific
research vessel happens to contain an ample supply of guns, ammo,
missiles and thermite grenades.</P>
<P>Opinion:
I love the cast of VIRUS. Donald Sutherland as a creepy sea captain;
Jamie Lee Curtis as the heroine; William Baldwin as a seaman; it can't
get any better than this. VIRUS also has good effects, courtesy of
director John Bruno who happens to be a special effects expert. VIRUS
marks his debut as a director. I even like the bad guy: a ruthless,
faceless, personality-free, alien life form made of electricity trapped
in the circuitry of the ship.</P>
<P>What VIRUS lacks, however, is suspense. VIRUS works like a 50s B-movie
with an upgraded budget. People stumble along, weather a few attacks,
and at last find a loud way to end the thing. Ideally in a movie you
want the good guys to face a deadly opponent they know nothing about.
Through narrow escapes and small clues they should slowly learn enough
to theorize a way to beat the thing. But in VIRUS finding out about the
enemy is done too quickly and easily; it's just a matter of believing
whatever Nadia says, rather than thinking about clues. Similarly, in an
ideal technothriller, the audience should be shown some of the devious
traps the alien might be planning, in order to ratchet up the suspense
factor when the unknowing heroes are shown. But in VIRUS the audience
never gets shown the sneak peak, so a lot of opportunity for suspense is
lost.</P>
<P>There are also some unanswered questions concerning the incongruous
behavior of various characters. What does Captain Everton stand to gain
from his actions? Why would a special forces expert become hysterical
when all the civilians are calm? These actions don't make sense.
Suspense is when you know a character well enough to see that his
personality is going to put him in big trouble with the upcoming
situation he doesn't know about. But when characters act unbelievably,
some of that juicy anticipation is lost.</P>
<P>In short, it's fun watching the cast of VIRUS ham it up, and there are
plenty of high tech booms and bangs in this movie for amusement. But
VIRUS could be much better with a healthy dose of basic suspense.</P>
