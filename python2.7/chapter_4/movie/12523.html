<PRE>SHOOTING FISH
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of  * * * *</PRE>
<P>Stefan Schwartz directs this con-game comedy from his own script...a
script has a few good idea, but which is overwhelmed by problems.</P>
<P>Dylan (Dan Futterman) and Jez (Stuart Townsend) are a pair of hard
working con artists seeking to earn 2 million pounds for poor orphans
(they're both orphans, you see...).  Dylan is the smooth talker, while
Jez is the technical genius.</P>
<P>For one of their scams, they hire a typist, Georgie (Kate Beckinsale),
to pretend to be a computer.  However, each of the men fall madly in
love with Georgie, who doesn't want anything to do with illicit scams.</P>
<P>You see, Georgie has problems of her own.  She's secretly (at least from
Dylan and Jez) engaged to marry a man she despises, yet must marry. Yet
she yearns for the sense of adventure she experiences while around Jez
and Dylan.</P>
<P>Shooting Fish has an occasional bright moment scattered here and there.
Some of the cons are amusing, but most of them are a little too
prolonged.</P>
<P>The movie seriously runs aground during its last act, when it contorts
to deliver a cloyingly happy ending.  Its intent may be self-parody at
this point, but whatever the intentions, it rings a note shockingly out
of tune with the rest of the film.</P>
<P>The cast is pleasant, but nothing special.  Of the three leads, Kate
Beckinsale is the most congenial, and has the strongest character.
There's not much more to Dylan and Jez than has been put down in this
review.</P>
<P>Shooting Fish ends up being a nice, but unmemorable little film that had
the chance to be much better.</P>
