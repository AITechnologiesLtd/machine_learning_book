<P>**** out of *****
A big surprise to me.  The good trailer had hinted that they pulled the
impossible off, but making a Blues Brothers movie without Jake Blues (John
Belushi) is such a dumb idea I really had no hope.  They replaced him just
fine.  Not with John Goodman, he didn't do much of anything, but with the
brilliant actor Joe Morton, who can REALLY sing.  The fourth Blues Brother
is J Evan Bonifant, who's ten.  This was another of my fears for the film,
but he's a really good dancer, and plays a mean harmonica (although he may
have been dubbed).  Things that intellectually had bothered me before, like
no mission from God, everyone being richer, it not being filmed in Chicago
-- gave me no problems at all.  I'm quite pleased that there were less car
pile-ups, because they meant less music, and John Landis seems to have lost
interest in the whole thing.  There's a few early crashes, and then one
huge pile-up, but after that it all stops.  It's just the music.  One of my
problems with the first is that Cab Calloway's song is so good the actually
Blues Brothers look dull after him, but there's no problems with this.  the
music is all as good as ever, tons of great musicians showing up -- with
the exception of Johnny Lang, who can't sing, all the musicians do a great
job.  The only real problems I had was the special effects.  These were
superfluous and a waste of money.  Since the film isn't doing very well,
they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel, which I want to
see.  The bluegrass version of Riders in the Sky is even better than
Rawhide.
