<PRE>A 90210 ballet
Center Stage</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>If you like campy dance movies, this one won't let you down. One "free"
screener commented, "If I paid money for it, I wouldn't have been
disappointed." This reviewer, expecting a wince-able display, admittedly
winced only a couple of times. Another viewer/dance major said something
like this, "Great dancing ... err ah, ... dancers aren't good actors
though."</P>
<P>"Center Stage" is what you'd expect it to be - even a little more. Though it
has its fair share of stale acting, more than half of the principals do pull
their own weight. In fact, Susan May Pratt (Maureen) taps down a strong
performance as the prissy perfect ballerina soon to learn a lesson on self.
A scene with her domineering mom in the middle of the film is perfectly
written, directed and acted.</P>
<P>We follow a group of choice young ballet talent through soap, friendships,
and a year of strict dance training at ABC (only the world's premiere
studio). Which three will make it into the professional dance company? Campy
and fun, un-glamorized dance sequences, light, well-paced.</P>
