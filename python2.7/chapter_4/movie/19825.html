<P>The accents and exaggerated stupid characters from FARGO meet a mockumentary
type film featuring a black comedy look behind Teen America beauty pageants.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A faux documentary film featuring a glimpse behind the scenes of a small
Minnesota town's teen beauty contestants and their overly competitive
families.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Some people may find stupid, over-the-top, stereotyped characters from a
small town to be extremely funny, and I myself have been known to subscribe
to this group from time to time, but it was obvious from the first frame of
this film that its only source of comedy would come from its idiotic
characters, goofy accents and ignorant statements. For me, that just wasn't
funny! It's unfortunate because the premise of the film seemed ripe for
parody with some funny characters brewing within, but for me, only a few
chuckles trickled out here and there, but mostly I was shaking my head and
thinking "this is just stupid". It didn't  help that most of the main
characters seemed to go in and our their accents from time to time.</P>
<P>Besides its lack of consistent humor, I also found that the film ran a
little too long, had one really exaggerated and unfunny retarded character
who was just embarrassing, and many, many missed opportunities, including a
flat ending. I did enjoy two smaller characters in the film, one being the
father of Denise Richards character and judge#2 with his penchant for "young
girls", but overall, most felt tired. Two characters which were way
underused were Ellen Barkin, who could've been so much more, and Denise
Richards, who appeared to be the star of the film from the look of its
trailer, but actually only played a small part within a diverse cast of
characters.</P>
<P>Overall, the film didn't do it for me, offering very little in real humor
and relying more on the easy, let's make fun of the trailer-trash-folk-type
of comedy. And if you're expecting T&A from Richards, forget about it. Any
which way you look at it, missed opportunities all around.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Kirsten Dunst has gone on record as saying that she will remain a virgin
until she meets the "right guy", and once dated Dustin Hoffman's son. She
also beat out Christina Ricci for roles in INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE (8/10)
and LITTLE WOMEN.
This film is director Michael Patrick Jann's feature debut. This film is
also screenwriter Lona Williams' first produced script. She was once first
runner up in the National Junior Miss competition. She also plays Judge#3 in
this film.
Denise Richards stands 5'6", has been nicknamed "Fluffy Girl", and made her
feature film debut as Gladys in 1993's LOADED WEAPON.
In 1995, Ellen Barkin dated actor David Arquette. She was also married to
actor Gabriel Byrne
This film was originally titled DAIRY QUEENS.</P>
