                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>149 min., PG-13, Drama, 1993
Director: Richard Attenborough
Cast: Robert Downey, Jr., Moira Kelly, Anthony Hopkins, Milla Jovovich,
      Dan Aykroyd, Geraldine Chaplin, Kevin Dunn, Kevin Kline,
      Diane Lane, Penelope Ann Miller, Paul Rhys, John Thaw,
      Marisa Tomei, Nancy Travis, James Woods</P>
<P>     Robert Downey, Jr., plays the legendary Charlie Chaplin.  This
film traces the life of Charlie Chaplin, starting with his entrance into
show business.  Most of the film is spent covering Chaplin's movie
career and sex life.</P>
<P>     CHAPLIN is an excellent film, which I highly recommend that you
see.  Although the film is almost two and a half hours long, it doesn't
slow down or get boring.  CHAPLIN is very well done and mixed with
comedy (which is appropriate because Charlie Chaplin was a comedian) so
that it doesn't get over dramatic.  This film is very well written.  On
a scale of zero to five, I give CHAPLIN a five.  CHAPLIN is rated PG-13
for female nudity, explicit language, and adult situations.  How this
film managed to get a PG-13 rating, I don't know.</P>
<P>     I expect that, at least, one cast member will be nominated for an
Academy Award (an Oscar).  The entire cast is superb.  Robert Downey,
Jr., (1969, TUFF TURF) was an excellent choice to play Charlie Chaplin.
He does an excellent job and brings life to Chaplin.  Moira Kelly (THE
CUTTING EDGE, LOVE LIES AND MURDER) has a double role in this film.  She
plays Charlie Chaplin first love and his last love.  She does an
excellent job with both roles.  Anthony Hopkins (THE BOUNTY, SILENCE OF
THE LAMBS) does an okay job as a fictional character.  He was put in the
film so Charlie Chaplin would have somebody to tell his life story to.
I don't think that Anthony Hopkins added anything to this film.  Milla
Jovovich (RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON, KUFFS) plays Charlie Chaplin's
underage lover.  Milla Jovovich gives a very good performance.</P>
<P>     Dan Aykroyd (DRIVING MISS DAISY, NEIGHBORS) is great as the film
maker who starts Charlie Chaplin in films.  Aykroyd has a comical
character and is a great asset to the film.  Geraldine Chaplin (BOLERO
[1982 version], DR. ZHIVAGO), who is Charlie Chaplin's daughter, plays
Charlie Chaplin's mother in the film.  She does an outstanding job, and
I hope to see her get nominated for an Academy Award.  Kevin Dunn (ONLY
THE LONELY) gives a good performance as J.  Edgar Hoover.  He doesn't
add much to the film though.  Kevin Kline (A FISH CALLED WANDA, GRAND
CANYON) gives an excellent performance, per his usual, as an action film
actor.  Kevin Kline adds a lot to the film.  Diane Lane (LONESOME DOVE,
THE OUTSIDERS) plays another one of Charlie Chaplin's lovers.  She does
a great job.  Penelope Ann Miller (DOWNTOWN, KINDERGARTEN COP) is great.
Paul Rhys (VINCENT AND THEO) is very good as Charlie Chaplin's brother.
James Woods (ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, THE HARD WAY) is on briefly as
a lawyer.</P>
