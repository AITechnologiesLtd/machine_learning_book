<PRE>Ahnold no Deckard clone</PRE>
<PRE>Sixth Day
A film review by Michael Redman
Copyright 2000 by Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Human cloning appears inevitable. We've cloned sheep. We're mapping the
human genome. Can a clone of a former President who, himself, runs for that
office be far away?</P>
<P>"The Sixth Day" examines the moral implications of copying people. Sorta. It
also tosses in an Arnold Schwarzenegger action film and does neither with
much thought...or action.</P>
<P>Adam Gibson (Schwarzenegger) returns home one day to discover that he's
already there. His duplicate is enjoying his birthday party. Even worse,
he's enjoying his wife in the back seat of their suburban assault vehicle.</P>
<P>In the not-too distant future, cloning is commonplace. "Repet" is a
commercial success assuring your family they never have to suffer the death
of a beloved pet. Rover is back with you, just a clone away. Human copying
has been outlawed but a rogue company is secretly Xeroxing away.</P>
<P>The bad guys have to kill Gibson before they are discovered. Arnold has to
survive, destroy their operation and make everything safe for law-abiding
folk. It's a typical Schwarzenegger movie, but not quite as exciting.</P>
<P>The action scenes lack the punch of earlier Schwarzenegger pictures.
Accustomed to the more highly stylized "Matrix", the audience for
old-fashioned shoot-em-up science fiction films might be disappearing. This
one isn't exactly a box office sensation.</P>
<P>The story feels reminiscent of "Bladerunner" but without the soul. The minor
plot element of which Gibson is "real" (which could be interesting had it
been explored for more than 30 seconds) is handled clumsily compared to the
underlying question of whether Deckard is a replicant. Gibson's mission is
to destroy clones which happen to have a built-in limited life span. Sound
familiar? Compare the final scene with one of the <I>Bladerunner<I> endings.</P>
<P>In this season of Christmas releases, Santa won't be laughing "Ho! Ho! Ho!"
at this film. It'll be more like "Ho! Hum!"</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for long enough that he can remember
both versions of "Bladerunner". Email <A HREF="mailto:redman@bluemarble.net">redman@bluemarble.net</A> with your
cinematic memories.)</P>
