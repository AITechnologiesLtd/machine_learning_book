<P>     DEAD SAILORS SOCIETY is the unfortunately appropriate description
of this aspiring, real-life drama that ends up, well, all wet.  The
plot, based on the true 1961 incident, centers on the floating school-
ship Albatross.  Its crew of thirteen high-schoolers have signed-on for
a year of sailing 'n' schooling, just as *we* have signed-on for a grand
coming-of-age tale set against the allure and adventure of the high
seas.  Unfortunately for us *and* them, neither gets what they expected.</P>
<P>     WHITE SQUALL is a confounding film.  The visuals are great, as only
Ridley Scott (ALIEN, BLADE RUNNER) can render them; equally good is Jeff
Bridges, who gives a strong, salty performance as the no-nonsense
Captain.  "If we don't have order, we don't have anything," he notes and
to which somebody behind the camera should've taken seriously.  For
starters, all the young dudes look alike.  There's nary a distinguishing
trait between them, other than the fact that they all look like Tom
Cruise.  The passage of time is never properly charted, also a problem,
nor is the awesome "strength of the sea" given it's proper due.  That
is, until the climax.</P>
<P>     What happens to the Albatross-- and after someone shoots a dolphin,
no less!-- could be an outtake from Robert Shaw's speech in JAWS.  Man
goes out on boat with three crew and thirteen lads; only eleven return.
The villain-- impressively rendered inside an indoor tank-- is a freak
meteorological phenom called a "white squall," which hits near the end
of the film.  Water water everywhere and soon the surviving captain and
crew are blubbering and bonding before a condemning Coast Guard
tribunal.  It's a stupid, sappy ending to an already waterlogged movie.
Arrggh.</P>
