<P>         Just in time for the first frost of the season comes "Random
Hearts," a romance between two ice cubes that moves at the speed of a
glacier.</P>
<P> Screenwriters have reportedly struggled for years to develop
Warren Adler's novel into a workable script, and the final version,
penned by Kurt Luedtke ("Out of Africa"), shows why the story has taken
so long to get to the cinema. It's much easier to cover a character's
transition from distraught, mournful soul to upbeat survivor in a
300-page book than in a two-hour movie. The challenge flummoxes not only
Luedtke, but also the usually unflappable Harrison Ford and Kristin
Scott Thomas, both of whom move self-consciously through most of the
film.</P>
<P> But if "Hearts" is a dramatic fizzle, Sydney Pollack's
direction and the sumptuous photography of Philippe Rousselot ensure
it's still watchable. The A-list supporting cast (Charles Dutton, Bonnie
Hunt, Dylan Baker, etc.) is well-utilized and everything looks glorious,
from the magnificently colored Maryland forests to the pricey bottles of
wine served at a political fundraiser. Production designer Barbara Ling
has engineered such an eye-pleasing series of locations for the drama
that even a backwoods cabin looks as if it was personally decorated by
Martha Stewart.</P>
<P> All this glamor, however, surrounds a pair of very cold fish.
William "Dutch" Van Den Broeck (Ford) is a tight-lipped Washington D.C.
internal affairs sergeant, while Kay Chandler (Thomas) is a New
Hampshire Congresswoman embroiled in a tough re-election campaign. Both
are utterly absorbed in their work, so it's no wonder their respective
spouses Peyton (Susanna Thompson) and Cullen (Peter Coyote) manage to
sneak off together and carry on an affair. Besides, don't people with
names like Cullen and Peyton always wind up together after all?</P>
<P> When the lovebirds' flight to Miami crashes and Dutch drops
everything to investigate, all is revealed. The movie's strongest scenes
come in this early stretch, as Pollock and Ford do an expert job of
capturing the desperation and raw emotions that lead up to that
wrenching moment when all Dutch's worst fears are realized.</P>
<P> For reasons never made particularly clear, Dutch feels
compelled to track down kay and confront her with the evidence he's
found. At first, she's aloof -- "First class isn't what it used to be. I
don't think it's worth the money," Kay blithely informs him when told
Cullen and Peyton were sitting together in 3A and 3B -- but eventually
she becomes angry and resentful. Dutch, for his part, continues to be
resolutely morose.</P>
<P> Is shared grief a fertile ground for romance? Most would argue
it's not, but "Hearts" plows forward nevertheless, determined to build
something meaningful on this fragile foundation. The rambling plot is
punctuated with stony silences, vodka-soaked confessions and accusing
looks, all of which we can assume are meant to suggest smoldering
passion.</P>
<P> Instead, these things serve as a lead-in to a bedroom scene in
which you half-expect to see the lover's breath. Dutch can barely manage
an interested look at Kay, and as Republican women go, she has the
unbridled sensuality of Nancy Reagan. Ford and Thomas have scored as
romantic leads with other partners in the past, but as a couple they
generate next to nothing.</P>
<P> "Sooner or later, everybody knows everything," Dutch muses at
one point, and in practically no time at all viewers will realize
"Random Hearts" is simply an elegantly appointed igloo. James Sanford</P>
