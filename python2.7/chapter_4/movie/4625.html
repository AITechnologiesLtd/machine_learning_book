<PRE>                           ANNE FRANK REMEMBERED
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Most of us have seen various TV screenings of Anne Frank's Diary
and grieved for the young girl who met such a horrible death at the
hands of the Nazis just as the war was coming to an end.  But no matter
how many times you have seen it, someone else has found a new way of
presenting it, has found new, previously unseen footage of the atrocity
that was the Holocaust.  Now come ANNE FRANK REMEMBERED, an
unforgettable documentary that will tear at your heart.</P>
<P>     When, some years ago, I visited the very house where she and her
family were hidden in the attic, I was extremely touched.  And every
time I see a film about the tragic incident I am spellbound again.</P>
<P>     This is the kind of film that must be seen again and again so that
nothing like the horror of the death camps will ever happen again.
This is what movie-making does best, bringing to us history the way it
really happened.  No adjectives are strong enough to fully do justice
to the accuracy and poignancy of the film.</P>
