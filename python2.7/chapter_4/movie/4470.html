<P>      Wow.  Director Michael Mann's epic crime story is an instant 
qualifier for the category of "year's best."  The three-hour tale 
of cops and robbers has been fashioned from the oldest of stories, 
but Mann puts a provocative psychologist twist on it.  He focuses 
on the *inner* lives of two obsessively driven men:  master thief 
Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) and LA cop Vincent Hanna (Al 
Pacino).  They spend almost the entire movie apart, an irony that 
isn't lost on anyone before or behind the camera.  Pacino and 
De Niro have never shared a scene together, despite starring as 
father and son in THE GODFATHER, PART II.  When they finally meet, 
in the middle of the movie, for an impromptu coffee-shop conver-
sation, it's a quiet moment of impressive magnitude.</P>
<P>     Despite the implications of the punchy title, Mann's extended 
cat-and-mouse chase is not about testosterone-poisoned action 
heroes.  These guys are just out to do their jobs; each more 
methodical than maniac, or so they would rationalize.  They know 
they have a job to do, and that some people might get hurt as a 
result.  (Such as their women-- the wives, daughters, and 
girlfriends that the story poignantly portrays.)  The overall tone 
is cool; perhaps too cool for some.  The dolby-enchanced set-
pieces, the ones most likely shown in the ads, are few and far 
between.  A heavy-artillery shoot-out on the downtown streets of LA 
is something to see, though.  Mann, ever the thinking director, 
allows us to catch our breath.  Just as he allows his characters 
their own moments of silence.</P>
<P>     The superior photography, by Dante Spinotti, is one of the 
many technical credits that deserves Oscar recognition.  As he's 
shown in THIEF, MANHUNTER, and THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, as well as 
in his two TV series "Miami Vice" and "Crime Story," Michael Mann 
is no slouch on style.  Nor on substance.  He's written reasonable 
roles for Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight (!), Val Kilmer, and Ashley 
Judd.  The supporting players are an equally impressive lot.  The 
whammo cast also includes Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Amy Brenneman, 
Mykelti Williamson, Natalie Portman, and Tom Noonan.  And, since we 
*are* in LA, both rocker Henry Rollins and rapper Tone-Loc wander 
through for a scene or two.  </P>
