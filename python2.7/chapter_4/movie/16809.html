<P>"The Other Sister" is one of the most genuinely sweet love stories to 
come along in quite some time. Well-directed by Garry Marshall, the 
film, if anything, puts to an even larger shame the false sentimentality 
and writing of the recent "Message in a Bottle," for here you actually 
do believe that the two central characters are in love without having to 
suffer through one unbelievable tragedy after another.</P>
<P>At the start of "The Other Sister," Carla Tate (Juliette Lewis), a 
mildly retarded young woman in her early 20s, has just obtained a 
certificate from a special school she has gone to for a large chunk of 
the latter part of her life. Returning to her family's wealthy San 
Francisco home, and to her overprotective, but loving mother (Diane 
Keaton) and more understanding father (Tom Skerritt), Carla announces 
that she wants to be a veterinarian's assistant one day and also wants 
to go to the local Polytechnic school, even though it is primarily for 
people without a mental disability. On the first day there, she meets 
Daniel (Giovanni Ribisi), who also is mentally disabled, at the 
registration center and helps him out when someone calls him a "retard." 
Thus begins a delicate relationship between Carla and Daniel, both of 
which can understand the other person unlike anyone else, since they are 
both very much alike in their ways of thinking. Carla is intrigued to 
find out early on that Daniel has an apartment of his own, which his 
father is paying for while he is in school, and she decides that it's 
time she get an apartment herself. </P>
<P>It is difficult to describe the "plot" of "The Other Sister," since the 
film wisely has decided to be more of a character study between two 
people who, yes, do have a disability, but are able to love each other 
just like anyone else can. It is this aspect of the film that I 
appreciated the most, because the screenplay, by Garry Marshall and Bob 
Brunner, does not look upon or treat the characters of Carla and Daniel 
as "different," nor do they want to make us feel pity for them. Quite 
the contrary, they are regarded as regular people who do have a handicap 
to deal with in their lives but not when dealing with each other. The 
dialogue between the two also never feels anything short of exact and 
accurate, and through their actions we quickly are allowed to care very 
much about them, while we also can laugh with joy at their veritable 
innocence.</P>
<P>Juliette Lewis, always an interesting and talented actress (1991's "Cape 
Fear," 1993's "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," 1996's "The Evening Star"), 
gives a tour de force performance after being absent from the screen 
since 1996, and she proves here in spades that she is nothing short of a 
brilliant actress, one of the best of her generation. To substantiate 
this point, take a look at her in this film, and then view her as an 
unstable serial killer in 1994's "Natural Born Killers." If Lewis could 
not be classified as diverse, no one can, and if Academy Award members 
did not have such frustratingly short attention spans, Lewis would 
certainly garner a Best Actress nomination come next year, and there is 
no doubt in my mind that she would have this year if the picture had 
been released in December. To avoid short-changing Giovanni Ribisi, he 
also gives a completely believable performance and amazingly has a lot 
of chemistry with Lewis. As Carla's mother, Diane Keaton develops her 
character to be one that we don't always agree with since, after all, 
she is so overprotective, but also one that we can relate to and 
understand her reasoning behind certain judgements. And also lighting up 
the proceedings, even with a relatively small part, is Poppy Montgomery 
as one of Carla's sisters, who was the highlight of last year's 
otherwise badly-made comedy, "Dead Man on Campus." When, or if, 
Montgomery is ever cast in a lead role, I have no doubt that she will be 
able to pull it off, since she has already marginally salvaged one poor 
film and has made an impression here with only a limited amount of 
screen time.</P>
<P>Throughout "The Other Sister," the more dramatic moments are always 
skillfully done and, thankfully, never overly dramatic. In one 
particular scene where Daniel discovers he failed his school class, the 
film wisely uses a light emotional tone, avoiding simple melodrama, and 
therefore comes off as a far more effective and touching moment. Without 
giving away anything, another heartbreaking sequence, and one that 
admittedly did bring a few tears to my eyes, involved Daniel saying 
something very much inappropriate in front of a crowd, which brings 
Carla to a state of confusion, anger, and tears, and the following scene 
set in a parking lot between the two could not have been as powerful 
without the performances that director Marshall was able to get out of 
Lewis and Ribisi.</P>
<P>Although perhaps a bit overlong (with a running time of 130 minutes, a 
few scenes could have easily been edited out without losing anything 
substantial), "The Other Sister" is probably the most winning and joyful 
film I have seen so far in 1999. The love story element got me deeply 
involved in the characters, and the handling of the mental disability 
angle was subtle and intelligent. But what I will remember most, and 
will continue to remember throughout the year, is Juliette Lewis' 
flawless, lovely performance. Not even the nearly incomparable Meryl 
Streep could have done it any better, and that is, for sure, a testament 
to Lewis' wonderful abilities.</P>
