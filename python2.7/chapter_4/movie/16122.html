<PRE>DRIFTING CLOUDS (1996)</PRE>
<P>"Take a number, fill out a form, and wait your turn."</P>
<PRE>3 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Kati Outinen, Kari V‰‰n‰nen, Sakari Kuosmanen, Elina Salo;
Written & Directed by Aki Kaurism‰ki;
Cinematography by Timo Salminen</P>
<P>It might be possible to call DRIFTING CLOUDS a satire or a black 
comedy, but that would imply a sense of anger, of vitriol, of energy; 
DRIFTING CLOUDS is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone.  
It is the sad, slow story of Lauri and Ilona, a married couple caught 
between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward.  He 
loses his job as a tram driver, because everyone drives cars nowadays.  
Within a couple of months, she loses her position as a head waiter, 
when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff 
replaced.</P>
<P>A conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation.  
Lauri has surprised Ilona by buying her a TV, which she greets with 
little enthusiasm.  She notes that they haven't finished paying for 
the bookshelves or the couch yet.  He says that in four years the 
payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the 
shelves.  It would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn't spoken with 
such resigned weariness.</P>
<P>This sets the tone for the rest of the movie.  There is humour and 
idiosyncracy at the periphery, but at the centre there is frustration 
and futility, and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit 
reduces people, until their worth is equated solely with their earning 
capacity.  There is an element of political commentary in this 
critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social 
environment it creates, but in DRIFTING CLOUDS the political is 
subsumed by the personal: the movie is about two people and what 
happens to them, and nothing else matters.</P>
<P>Lauri and Ilona live lives starved for friendship, respect, culture, 
passion.  They go to the movies, and walk out past old posters for 
L'ATALANTE and L'ARGENT, but the movie they have just seen is a 
pointless, violent, unfunny comedy.  Their house and workplaces are 
uniformly unpleasant, painted and upholstered in lifeless colours 
(ugly greens, dull reds, insipid blues), full of inelegantly 
functional objects and appliances.  The art design is impeccable in 
its tawdriness, and director Aki Kaurism‰ki often matches the colour 
of characters' clothes with the background colour and/or lighting, so 
that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the 
environment.   There is no suggestion of sexuality in the 
relationship; Ilona and Lauri sleep in separate beds and their 
gestures of affection lack the heat of desire; their lives are now 
bound by something more complex and desperate than love.</P>
<P>Their downward, downsized, downtrodden lives have a momentum that is 
almost comic, as one setback succeeds another, bottoming out when 
Lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette 
wheel.  It must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs, 
more farce, more deadpan wit, but the film's great strength is the 
sober, empathic manner in which it observes Lauri and Ilona's 
misfortunes.  Irony would be an injustice.  Situations and settings 
are broad and exaggerated--this is not realism--but they are not 
distorted.  The emotions are authentic.</P>
<P>If it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens, despite the 
droll performances, the laconic humour, that's because Kaurism‰ki 
brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities 
that are suffered.   He shows us how humiliating it must be for a 
woman of thirty-eight, who has worked long and hard to win a 
respectable position, to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in 
a two-bit restaurant; how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 
to confront his wife's former employer, demanding the rest of her 
wages, only to have the crap beaten out of him, unable to land a 
single punch, when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the 
money.</P>
<P>All this is observed keenly, with great economy: every cut, every 
line of dialogue, is judicious.  If most films are novelistic in their 
telling, this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story 
to bear.  But what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined 
by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96-minute 
running length.   I have seen many movies far less profound, less 
humane, less necessary than DRIFTING CLOUDS, but they filled me with 
an urge to watch them again, and this one did not.  It does not need 
to be seen twice: its every detail and implication can be absorbed in 
one viewing.</P>
<P>It is not a movie that will be seen by a large audience, because it 
cannot be pitched to one.  There is no selling point.  It is all 
understatement, restraint, melancholy.  The characters are 
unremarkable, their best years behind them, their dreams dissipated; 
it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills.  This 
does not make them less fascinating, merely less marketable, which is 
a shame, because this is a movie which should be seen, precisely 
because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies 
prefer to ignore.  It engages us and touches us and 
resolves--surprisingly, and movingly--into something resembling a 
happy ending.  The only thing greater than the ill-luck that governs 
the characters' lives is their refusal to give in to despair.  Their 
persistence is rewarded with what might be called a "feel-good" ending 
elsewhere, but not here, because this ending differs in kind from most 
such endings: this one has truly been earned.</P>
