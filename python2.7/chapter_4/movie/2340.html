<PRE>                             SCHINDLER'S LIST
                       A film review by Laurie Mann
                        Copyright 1994 Laurie Mann</PRE>
<P>     SCHINDLER'S LIST is simply the best movie of the decade (and the
second movie I've ever given a 10 to on "the list").  As upsetting as
the movie is to watch, it is gripping and wondrous.</P>
<P>     The movie opens quietly with a pre-war Polish Jewish family
lighting candles and saying prayers on Friday night.  The family
vanishes, and, in time, the candles burn out.</P>
<P>     The scene switches to a man carefully dressing, stuffing his hand
with money & carefully pinning a Nazi pin to his lapel.  He is a
shadowy figure, paying his way to get a fine table at a fancy
restaurant in Krakow, and catching the eye of some Nazi officers.
Schindler is just a glad-handing business man making contacts and
buying influence.  Soon his wining and dining pays off, as he acquires
a factory recently taken by the government as it was Jewish-owned.</P>
<P>     Schindler's one ambition in life is to retire with several steamer
trunks of money.  He sees running a pot factory in wartime Krakow as
the way to riches.  He finds the accountant who used to manage the
books for the factory and urges him to come to work for him.
Mr. Klein, cautiously played by Ben Kingsley, reluctantly agrees.  Since
Jews are cheap labor, Schindler tells Mr. Klein to find people to work
for him.</P>
<P>     Klein serves as Schindler's conscience at a time when Schindler
does not seem to have one.  Granted, Schindler is not a murdering Nazi,
but he's hardly a "nice" man, either.  So Klein rounds up friends, many
of whom have never worked in a factory, and rescues them from
deportation.  ("But I have a vital job, I'm a history teacher!" one man
protests as the Nazis force him on a truck.)  Schindler does not
complain about all the on-the-job training, and is soon backing the
necessity of his workers after the Nazis shoot one for failing to
shovel snow fast enough for them.</P>
<P>     War and war-atrocities continue to dehumanize the unthinking Nazis
in this film (and if the film does have a weakness, it is that the
Nazis are so unrelentingly bad its as if they were not human), but it
abruptly humanizes Schindler.  The script is intelligent, the
performances feel completely real, and Spielberg deserves enormous
credit for directing this masterpiece.  Liam Neeson, a long
under-recognized actor, gives an extraordinary performance in this
movie.</P>
<P>     One wonders how much of himself Spielberg may have seen in
Schindler.  For years, it looked like Spielberg only wanted to make
money.  He has taken risks at least three times with his films:  THE
COLOR PURPLE, EMPIRE OF THE SUN and now with SCHINDLER'S LIST.  With
SCHINDLER'S LIST, he's completely fled from any hint of commercial
exploitation and has just made a great movie.</P>
