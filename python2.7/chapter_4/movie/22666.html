<PRE>Retrospective: Jeanne la Pucelle (1993)                    </PRE>
<PRE>Part one: The Battles
Part two: The Prisons</PRE>
<PRE>        Directed by Jacques Rivette
        Starring Sandrine Bonnaire </PRE>
<PRE>        In French with English subtitles</PRE>
<P>Rivetteâ€™s version of the life of Jeanne the Maiden has just now
been made available on videocassette to the American public, a
move that certainly has something to do with the recent release
of Luc Bessonâ€™s $58 million epic.  The two movies are poles
apart; but then Jeanne has always been something of a blank
slate, inviting a wide variety of interpretations.  Ingrid
Bergmanâ€™s Joan was a saint (sainte avant dâ€™etre sainte),
Bessonâ€™s half-crazy Jeanne an unguided missile. Rivetteâ€™s
Jeanne is the girl next door.</P>
<P>The first one of Rivetteâ€™s paired films, The Battles, begins in
Valcouleurs, the first stage in her journey, where Jeanne waits
and waits.  And waits.  The local captain ignores her, tells her
to go home, tells her she should have her ears boxed.  But
mostly he just ignores her.  Itâ€™s an unpromising beginning to a
four-hour brace of films, as Sandrine Bonnaire stands around
doing nothing in front of a static camera.  Patience is rewarded
though, both Jeanneâ€™s and the viewerâ€™s.  The story builds
slowly, but gradually a sense of Jeanneâ€™s character develops. 
This movie will sneak up on you; I found it engaging, despite
the slow start. One big problem in portraying this character lies
in answering the question, why did anyone listen to her or
believe her?  Itâ€™s a dilemma that puts a nearly impossible
burden on any actress portraying Jeanne.  Bonnaireâ€™s Jeanne
answers that question on the first night of the journey to
Chinon.  Two of the men accompanying her plan to rape her as
they lie together sleeping.  But when they wake up in the
middle of the night, they are nervous at being in the middle of
enemy territory, and they find that they really donâ€™t  have the
stomach to carry out their plan.  Jeanne wakes up too, and it is
she who reassures them.  They are impressed; theyâ€™re taken
with her.  So too is the viewer.  Itâ€™s very nicely done.  This
Jeanne is calm and down-to-earth.  She is prone to girlish
giggling fits.  Her ordinariness is appealing.  For all her
courage, faith, and commitment, it is her ordinariness that
always shines through.</P>
<P>When she is wounded at the Tourelles, she cries.  Although the
wound is slight, it hurts, and sheâ€™s frightened that she will die. 
Itâ€™s a natural reaction.  No heroics here; she doesnâ€™t yank out
the arrow and make a joke.  Sheâ€™s not nuts.  She is neither saint
nor hero, but an eighteen year old girl.</P>
<P>The Battles is an unfortunate choice of title for the first film. 
Hampered by a small budget, the battles at Orleans are barely
sketched in.  Filmed with perhaps twenty extras, they border on
the absurd.  The second film, The Prisons, covers the extended
period of her imprisonment, and explores her curious
relationship with Joan of Luxemborg.  Joan was the aunt of the
nobleman whose prisoner Jeanne was, and she protected
Jeanne until her death in 1430.  Only then was Jeanne sold to
the English; her nephew was apparently afraid to deliver
Jeanne while his aunt lived.</P>
<P>Curiously, Jeanneâ€™s trial is almost entirely left out; the story is
picked up again at her sentencing.  Under threat of death, she
signs the renunciation and is returned to prison  There she is
tricked into resuming menâ€™s dress, which provides the pretext
for her execution.  When she learns she is to be burned as a
relapsed heretic, she tears her hair, cries, and begs for pity.  It
is an affecting scene.  It stands in marked contrast to the stagy
artificiality of the Ingrid Bergman version.  Bergmanâ€™s Jeanne
faced her end with absurd stoicism, almost welcoming death by
fire as a small price to pay for sainthood.</P>
<P>History records that Jeanneâ€™s final words as the flames reached 
her were â€œJesus!â€?  There are lots of ways of calling out â€œJesus,â€? 
and the way the scene is handled pretty much sums up Dryerâ€™s, 
Bessonâ€™s, and Rivetteâ€™s films on the life and death of the Pucelle. 
Bergmanâ€™s Jeanne spoke it calmly, as a prayer.  Milla Jovovichâ€™s 
cries are inaudible, unheeded by a nonexistent God.  Sandrine 
Bonnaire screams â€œJesus!â€? like a girl who is being burned alive.</P>
