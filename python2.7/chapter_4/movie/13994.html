<PRE>                             ARMAGEDDON 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                       1 :-) for a very noisy ride</PRE>
<P>Director: Michael Bay
Writer: Jonathan Hensleigh, J.J. Abrams
Cast: Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Will
Patton, Peter Stormare, Keith David, Steve Buscemi</P>
<P>In ARMAGEDDON, everyone wants to save the world, each other, and carry
on them so much love and comradeship, you'll gag on the popcorn. There
are no bad guys, except for a big, mean meteorite and a highly
unintelligent president. Throw in volatile father/daughter/lover
relationships, the fate of humanity hanging on limbo, about to be
blasted into oblivion and NOISE, NOISE, MORE NOISE, and before long,
you're senses have been thrown into overdrive by the Jerry Bruckheimer
team. They have once again pulled out a no stops, glitzy, action packed,
noisy adventure that will leave you dizzy with explosions and
collisions, that just seem to roll across the screen.</P>
<P>Unlike the slower, more thoughtful, DEEP IMPACT, this movie begins with
a flash of destruction – the collapsing Chrysler building - you can't
get smaller than that. Not to mention, an action packed cast all wanting
their fair share of screen time - namely, Mr. B.Willis, Mr. B.Affleck,
and Mr. B.B.Thornton. Mr. Willis gets to give his customary, ‘look how
tough I am' stare, that also spells ‘I'm the greatest American Action
Hero'. Whilst Mr. Affleck, who hasn't learnt how to develop this
technique yet, throws himself about the screen, saying ‘Watch out for
me, I'm better looking, and I'm going to be the next best American
Action Hero.' Mr B.B. Thornton, on the other hand, carries himself with
such self-control and dignity, that says to Willis and Affleck, ‘I may
not be as good looking, but I can sure act better than the both of you.'
On the side, Liv Tyler, looks prettier than all three.</P>
<P>On the whole, an action packed thrill ride that is certain to please
lovers of special effects and action heroes. If this is your kind of
film, then it is probably worth the weight of a movie ticket, as it will
be much less impressive on tape.</P>
