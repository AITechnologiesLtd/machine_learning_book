<PRE>THE BIG HIT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Too many movies these days aren't smart enough to realize they
would have been infinitely better recast as parodies - FIRESTORM and
HARD RAIN come immediately to mind.  Arguably the best thing that can
be said about THE BIG HIT is that it is smart enough to realize how
dumb it is and to make the most of it.  Never taking itself seriously,
even for a moment, the movie features silly dialog ("Ladies, you're so
fine I want to pour milk over you and make you a part of my complete
breakfast.") and shoot 'em up action played for maximum camp.</P>
<P>     A group of macho hit men lead by Cisco, played in a hilarious
over-the-top performance by Lou Diamond Phillips, kill people left and
right.  Mark Wahlberg, who was the well-endowed porn star in BOOGIE
NIGHTS, is Cisco's number one gun, Melvin Surley.  Mel is a sensitive
contract killer, whose biggest worry is that people will not like him.
Cisco and the other members of his crew like to show off their buff
bodies, and the picture includes some conspicuous rear male nudity to
titillate the audience.</P>
<P>     With the military precision and the weaponry of commandos, the hit
men can take on any challenge.  That is until they decide to pick up a
little money on the side by kidnapping a millionaire's daughter, Keiko
Nishi, played with a delicious mixture of schoolgirl innocence and
tough-woman attitude by cinematic newcomer China Chow.  When she reads
her kidnapper's ransom note, misspellings and all, the scene will have
you in stitches.  Her father, Jiro (Sab Shimono), turns out to be a
bankrupt filmmaker, whose best friend is Cisco's boss.</P>
<P>     Taavo Soodor's set decoration is a hoot.  Mel lives in an upper
middle-class development in which the men engage in synchronized lawn
mowing reminiscent of L.A. STORY.  His garage has all the standard
household tools as well as enough guns to supply a small army.</P>
<P>     The movie has a side plot so ridiculous that it's great dealing
with an obnoxious, pimple-faced, video rental clerk, played by Danny
Smith, who keeps calling and threatening to kill Mel if he doesn't
bring back his overdue copy of KING KONG LIVES.  The clerk has a wanted
flyer posted with Mel's picture on it for being a "video truant."  One
of the other hit men, on the other hand, is a video store award winner,
who has his picture on display for entirely different reasons.  But
this funny subplot is basically unprintable.</P>
<P>     Among the movie's more absurd scenes is a car chase and demolition
derby, during which Cisco uses his car like Paul Bunyan to fell the big
trees in his path.  The movie even uses instant replays to show you
exactly how the characters manage to escape certain death.</P>
<P>     Just to make sure that he's covered every comedic base, writer Ben
Ramsey has a part for Elliott Gould as a hen-pecked Jewish husband who
can't be let near the alcohol or bad things will happen.  Well, lots of
bad things do happen in THE HIT MEN.  And its director Kirk Wong has
the audience laughing at most of them.</P>
<P>     THE BIG HIT runs a fast 1:39.  It is rated R for violence,
profanity and brief nudity and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
