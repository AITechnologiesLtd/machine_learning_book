<P>     With its abundance of foreshadowing, flashbacks, and other methods 
of toying with time and reality, Anna Campion's feature debut, LOADED, 
enjoys bending the audience's perceptions.  Add an atmosphere soaked in 
dark, ominous overtones, and the result is moody and artistic.  
Unfortunately, Campion (who is the sister of THE PIANO's Jane) doesn't 
invest the same effort into creating characters and smoothing out the 
narrative as she does shaping the tone.</P>
<P>     LOADED introduces us to seven college-age characters who travel to 
an out-of-the-way country house to videotape a no-budget horror flick.  
Lance (Danny Cunningham), the stern, rather unpleasant director, has 
delusions of recapturing John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN success.  No one 
else shares his enthusiasm, but they all participate, either by going in 
front of the camera or staying behind it.  Rose (Catherine McCormack, 
from BRAVEHEART) is the leading lady, who, in real-life, is obsessed 
about losing her virginity.  Her boyfriend, Neil (Oliver Milburn), is 
perhaps the least stable of the group -- he's in therapy.  Also present 
are Charlotte (Biddy Hodson), a spoiled rich girl who wants more 
closeness in her relationship with Lance; Zita (Thandie Newton), the 
only "normal" one; and Giles (Nick Patrick), an intellectual who keeps a 
scrapbook of serial killers.  Half an hour into the movie, Lionel 
(Matthew Eggleton), a born-again Christian biker, arrives on the scene, 
but his arrival fuels a misunderstanding with tragic consequences.</P>
<P>     The title has multiple meanings.  In the first place, it refers to 
what happens to these seven people when they take sample doses of acid -
- they become loaded.  More generally, however, it alludes to the 
concerns that weigh down young men and women coming of age in a time 
when the previous generation is still groping for answers.  This loading 
can lead to anger that has no effective outlet.</P>
<P>     As strong as the core ideas are, however, Campion's presentation is 
erratic.  Her script is poorly-paced.  There's a protracted introduction 
that goes nowhere, and features a number of superficial conversations 
that purport to address "deep" issues.  By the time things start 
happening, the movie is half over.  This storytelling method might have 
worked if it had yielded a field of rich personalities, but these 
characters are incomplete -- a few unique, individual traits grafted 
onto the familiar post-Generation X angst.</P>
<P>     The drug sequence is suitably hallucinogenic, although, as in Roger 
Avary's KILLING ZOE, it goes on for too long.  We see the wood grain of 
a table turn fluid and birds fly out of the wallpaper.  Campion 
effectively uses point-of-view shots during these sequences, but there's 
a time when becomes tedious.  Meanwhile, half the characters are left 
with nothing to do.</P>
<P>     There's a certain artsy pretentiousness about LOADED that the thick 
atmosphere and cleverly-constructed final act can't completely obscure.  
All the magical, mystical conversations about spirituality and life 
don't amount to much -- they come across as forced, and only serve to 
diminish the characters involved.  There are times, mostly during the 
second half, when LOADED develops into an eerily-compelling piece of 
film making, but these instances are offset by the many unsuccessful 
elements.  Overall, LOADED is a promising debut, but too uneven to be 
considered much more than a curiosity.</P>
