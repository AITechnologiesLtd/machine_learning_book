<P>The source novel by talented British writer and film critic Gilbert Adair
was a rather parodistic reworking of the Thomas Mann novella "Death in
Venice" told in the first person. Writer-director Kwietniowski (London-born
in 1957) reworked that reworking intelligently, sympathetically, with a
strong sense of visuals, editing and benevolent irony.</P>
<P>Before this, he had made about six gay-themed short films shown in several
festivals. "LDLI," his first feature, at the 1997 Cannes Fesival, received
a nomination for a Golden Camera and a special mention, as did John Hurt,
from the International Critics Association.</P>
<P>John Hurt is present in just about every scene. The thespian has a
marvelous track record, mostly in roles as different from one another as
they are from deja vu. Among them, in "A Man For All Seasons,"" Midnight
Express, ""The Elephant Man" (title role),"1984,""The Hit,""White
Mischief,"" Scandal,"" Rob Roy." He looks like no one else and can act like
nobody's business. Now in his  late 50s, he has the age of Giles De'Ath in
"Love and Death on Long Island."</P>
<P>British writer De'Ath lives in contemporary London but not in this century.
A widower (significantly, his wife was older than he, and they had no
children), he inhabits a world of books in a posh, old-fashioned apartment
where his housekeeper follows the man's clockwork routines without
intruding into his reclusive habits.</P>
<P>He gives no interviews, but when he is finally talked into an appearance on
BBC-Radio, it is  hilarious. Giles is befuddled by the questions, the
interviewer by the replies. De'Ath is truly out of the 20th century in
every way. "Do you use a word processor?" "I am a writer" he snaps," I
write words, I do not process them." Not that he has the foggiest about
what a processor is. Or even a typewriter.</P>
<P>A notation in the BBC ledger shows us just two words about the man: "fogey"
and "cult." This nagged me throughout the movie. If Giles has not a clue
about life-at-large, we don't have any about the kind of writing he does;
or why he is a figure in the literary Establishment; or what kind of cult
surrounds him, and why. Nonetheless, Giles is a hoot.</P>
<P>The radio interviewer had pointed out to Giles, who had not been to the
pictures in ages, that films have been made of the novels by E.M.Forster.
Later, locked out of his apartment and caught in the rain, Giles notices
such a film on a movie-house marquee and goes in. But unaware that there
are such innovations as multiplexes, he wanders into an American teen
flick, "Hotpants College 2." With comic slowness it dawns on him that
"this is not Forster." He  stands up to leave, but sees on the screen a
young performer (Jason Priestley) and  is entranced by him. Giles gets a
"coup de foudre," his first ever love-at-first-sight  and undoubtedly his
first  love ever, at any sight. The heart is a mysterious thing.</P>
<P>A major fixation is born. The besotted writer sees the picture again,
acting at the box-office like the traditonal, funny kid who wants to buy
condoms in a drugstore. Tracking down the name of the actor (it is Ronnie
Bostock) in comically awkward ways, he loads up on teen magazines which he
buys and disposes of as though they were pornography. He reads and
memorizes all about Ronnie, starts a cut-and-paste "Bostockiana" album.
Giles further enters pop culture by renting (more comedy here) all the
Bostock videos possible. He purchases a video-player, after first mistaking
microwave ovens for such machines, has it delivered by a stupefied young
man who explains to Giles' surprise that a TV set is required to watch the
tapes.</P>
<P>Passion escalates. After more research, howlers and howl-making episodes,
Giles takes off for the USA, to the Long Island village where Ronnie and
his supermodel girlfriend Audrey live by the sea. Giles, the innocent at
home, becomes the innocent abroad. But by now, the comic tone of the first
part acquires a lining of pathos, though without losing various funny
delights.</P>
<P>The second, American (though shot in Canada) half, has Giles take a room in
a motel where mostly couples meet furtively; be obsessed by his wanting to
meet Ronnie; resort  to a series of investigations and stalkings that
involve everything, from Ronnie's dog, his Porsche ragtop to  Giles'
becoming a regular at the greasy spoonish establishment owned by Irv. It is
called "Chez d'Irv," which somehow sounds like "chef d'oeuvre" (French for
"masterpiece") --a most unlikely bilingual pun, given Irv's
simple-mindedness</P>
<P>Love is the mother of inventions. The hitherto very low-key Giles  goes
energetically through loops and hoops, contrives a supermarket "accident"
to meet Audrey, turns on the charm, makes friends with her while waiting
for Ronnie to return from California. Finally, he meets him.</P>
<P>De'Ath's task is vastly aided by the small community --including the young
couple-- being one of naive people with little or no culture.No denizen had
ever heard of De'Ath, perhaps even of   literature. But all are hugely
impressed by having an English author in their midst. Dull, duller, dullest
Giles becomes an exotic creature.  It reminds me a bit of the newly rich
vulgarians who mistake Bob Hope for an Earl in "Fancy Pants."</P>
<P>Hurt's performance is probably his best, along with his Quentin Crisp in
"The Naked Civil Servant." In speech, expressivity, body language, timing,
he is impeccably in character, ludicrous and absurd yet believable, quasi
farcical yet touching. Wide-eyed Priestley, sporting Elvis  sideburns that
make him look even dimmer, performs with restraint a persona that's partly
an un-blatant send-off of his "Beverly Hills 90210" heartthrob, partly that
of a young actor who confusedly feels that there are things to do higher
than his teen-junk movie roles. The ground is fertile for Giles to lay on
with a trowel compliments, bold and bald statements about  Ronnie's talents
and potential, the imaginary film script Giles is writing for him. All
this, of course, leads to implanting the idea that things can go better,
not with Coke but with De'Ath as a mentor. To what extent Giles believes
what he says remains an open question.</P>
<P>Ronnie's is a supporting role to Giles' and Audrey's (well played by a
relative newcomer) is one level below this. The balance of the cast are
sub-supporters to the top trio, yet all appearances, down to the tiniest,
are sharply sketched out. Throughout the film, Kwietniowski also fleshes
out ambiances through light, economical, amusing touches in the
peripherals, from TV watching to weather predictions, not to mention
telephone answering machines or faxes.</P>
<P>November's attraction to May is something common. So is the mismatched
attraction of persons widely separated by social class, taste, intellect,
culture. Examples abound in movies, from  Somerset Maugham's novel "Of
Human Bondage" (the good version was filmed with Leslie Howard and Bette
Davis) to "Citizen Kane" and beyond.</P>
<P>In the case of " Love and Death" all this acquires new twists and an
outcome that I cannot disclose. But I can reveal that there is no sex,
there are no caricatures. Instead, we get heartfelt sentiment and much
humor at the expense of the nadirs of pop culture, teen adulation, as well
as of stuffy "high art."</P>
<P>No closure in its fullest sense comes at the end. Certain things are left
in the air, with an upbeat last-moment hint about Giles.There is audience
manipulation here, since the title's "Death" is a red herring. The name
De'Ath (pronounced Deh as in Irish or Italian names) does really exist, but
used without the apostrophe, it suggests to the unprepared public dire
events rather than a verbal joke.I'll grant you though that it is a good
mnemonic device.</P>
