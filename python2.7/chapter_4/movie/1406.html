<PRE>                                A WOMAN'S TALE
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     A WOMAN'S TALE is an Australian film directed by Paul Cox and
written by Paul Cox and Barry Dickins.  It stars Sheila Florance, Gosia
Dobrowolskia, Chris Haywood, and Norman Kaye.  Unrated.</P>
<P>     A WOMAN'S TALE, a film that moved from the Seattle International
Film Festival to a local theatrical run, blurs the line between fiction
and documentary to the point where we the audience cannot say that
anything we see on the screen happened to Sheila Florance, the
80-year-old Australian actress, or to the character she plays in this
her final performance.  Both were dying of cancer as the film was made.
Both apparently are feisty, sweet, in love with life with all its
sadness, thoughtful, and mean to the petty and to those who have lost
sight of life.  However neither she or her character is the frightful
old lady of TATIE DANIELLE or the cute eccentric of HAROLD AND MAUDE.
She is one of a kind, the fictive she as well as the real she.</P>
<P>     We have a traditional, rather straight-forward plot about an aging,
dying woman, whose landlord wants to move someone more lucrative into
her memory-filled apartment, whose fretful son wants to move her into a
nursing home "for her own good," whose visiting nurse has become her
surrogate daughter, whose friends include a 90-year-old woman who is as
fluffy as her white hair and a senile ex-military man.  His death sparks
a crisis in her own life.  This appears to be fiction.</P>
<P>     But the core of interest for us in the character and person of
Sheila Florance.  She appears to be playing herself, her memories appear
to be her character's -- as when she remembers the Blitz and dogfights
and body parts raining out of the sky and the death of her infant
daughter.  Her anger at war, her inconsolable, lifelong grief, her joy
in life, her wit, her theatrical, rather Tallulah-Bankheadish
mannerisms.  On this level, A WOMAN'S TALE is a one-woman theater piece.
One thing is certain in all the peekaboo is that Florance was a
performer of extraordinary courage and honesty.  Her scene of taking a
bath -- how many of us have even seen a naked woman of her age?  -- in
which she not only reveals her outer self, the sunken flesh, the fallen
breasts, that amazing wide mouth stripped of its lipstick, the eyes so
bright and lively elsewhere closed and unseeing in the dim bathroom, but
even more devastatingly she reveals the inner terror and sadness of
being old and alone with her memories, her losses, her tears.  She
grants us a unique gift in her dying to preserve and reveal who and what
she was.  You rejoice that you get to know this much of her now even you
regret you never knew her when she was alive.</P>
<P>     Florance is so compelling a personality that it is easy to lose
sight of the writer-director Paul Cox, a Dutch-born Australian whose
career ranges from a documentary about Van Gogh (VINCENT) to a gentle
love story (LONELYHEARTS) to a comedy about voyeurism (MAN OF FLOWERS)
to a divorce drama (MY FIRST WIFE).  He first saw Florance on stage in
the 60s, when they became friends.  He has the good sense to pretty much
hand his film over to Florance.  But Cox also respects the lesser
characters in his story, even the fluffy old lady who prattles endlessly
about cliched messages in nature.  Despite the source, there is an
underlying wisdom even in the cliches and Cox returns to the source
again and again in recurring (and final) images of moving water.  Even
the bitchy queens who live below Martha (Florance's character) and who
covet her apartment are redeemed at the right moment; exactly why they
had to be a gay couple to be bitches and unpleasant neighbors seems to
me the only gratuitously mean note in the film.</P>
<P>     Sheila Florance died last fall, a few days after receiving an
Australian Film Institute award for this work.  Because of the film, she
lives on.  I high recommend that you do what needs to be done to make
her acquaintance.  She will repay you many times over.</P>
