<PRE>Besieged
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**** (out of 4) BESIEGED is elegantly structured and concisely told.
Based on a short story by James Lasdun, it has the feel of a folk tale.
The setting is modern, but the characters and their motivations are
timeless and cross-cultural.</P>
<P>Before I continue, let me say that if you're interested already, go see
BESIEGED before reading this or any other reviews. It's not that the
movie centers around a surprise; it's that the movie's structure and
pace are very part of what's best about it. Knowing too much beforehand
might diminish their impact. Forgive me if the rest of the review is a
little vague as I try not to spoil anything.</P>
<P>Shandurai (Thandie Newton) is a medical student who earns her keep as a
live-in maid. Originally from Africa (from an unspecified military
dictatorship), she is now in Rome.</P>
<P>Her employer is Mr. Kinsky (David Thewlis), a reclusive English pianist
who rarely goes out and only teaches a few students. He lives alone
(except for Shandurai) in a rich, multistory apartment left to him by
his aunt. Antique statues, tapestries, and paintings adorn his lonely
home. Amid all the beautiful objects, only the black lacquer grand piano
is loved.</P>
<P>BESIEGED'S setup is subtle. It is elegantly arranged so that after about
15 minutes, all the introductory shots and scenes -- from Africa and
from Rome -- click into place. More exposition might have answered some
questions sooner, but Bertolucci's introduction is cleaner, more
succinct, and more forceful.</P>
<P>In this first part, there is an amazing lack of dialogue. Bertolucci
sets the scene without explaining it for the camera. Except for some
incidental dialogue in Africa, nothing is said until Mr. Kinsky abruptly
professes his love for Shandurai.</P>
<P>Kinsky's announcement is sudden and jarring, both to Shandurai and to
the audience. Usually a filmmaker lets you know right away whether a
screen couple will end up together or not. But at this point, the
characters have barely been introduced, and they have hardly spoken to
each other. The first words they share shouldn't be a desperate proposal
of marriage. When Kinsky says he's never felt this way before, it is
easy to believe him. His reclusive lifestyle seems to have deprived him
of the emotional maturity and experience that would have helped him
control his feelings.</P>
<P>Obviously, Shandurai rebuffs him. And to clearly draw the line for Mr.
Kinsky, she tells him that she is married; her husband is an African
prison. Bertolucci captures the awkward moment perfectly, using handheld
camera, slow motion, and jump cuts. (In fact he uses these techniques
throughout the movie to highlight or flit past a moment.) Soon enough,
the moment passes and the two never speak of the incident again.</P>
<P>But the words have been spoken and the can't be called back. Shandurai
tries to forget them by looking for another living situation and
immersing herself in school. Mr. Kinsky is the perfect gentleman,
apologizing once, then acting as though the embarrassing exchange is
completely behind them.</P>
<P>While Shandurai studies, Mr. Kinsky starts frequenting the African
churches. Soon, small things start disappearing from Mr. Kinsky's
apartment, to the surprise of Shandurai. Very slowly, very gradually,
his apartment becomes sparser and sparser. Life goes on, but the opulent
setting is becoming more and more humble. Kinsky never explains where
the rich adornments go, and Shandurai is afraid to ask.</P>
<P>Our suspicions (and Shandurai's hopes) are confirmed when she discovers
a letter in his wastebasket from her country's government in
Africa....</P>
<P>The story of sacrifice is very simple. So simple, in fact, that it
almost sounds like a fairy tale -- like a story once told around
campfires to extended families.</P>
<P>In fact, BESIEGED features an African storyteller. He exists outside of
the story but appears on-camera at key moments from Shandurai's life in
Africa. Perhaps he is the director's shadow, because with BESIEGED,
Bertolucci proves himself a great storyteller.</P>
<P>Bertolucci uses the medium of film to its fullest extent. He slows time
when a moment has weight, and skims through it when a moment is
fleeting. He avoids unnecessary dialogue and SHOWS, rather than TELLS,
when possible. He uses editing to concisely compress time, and to draw
thematic parallels between scenes.</P>
<P>The use of music in this film is wonderful. Rich African rhythms and
harmonies contrast with the luxurious beauty of Kinsky's solo piano
pieces. The musical contrast echoes the differences between the two main
characters. (It's interesting to note that Kinsky's music takes on more
rhythm and life after he visits the African church.) A single jazz tune
in the middle -- "My Favorite Things," appropriately enough -- bridges
the two styles of music and the two halves of the film.</P>
<P>Finally, and most importantly, Bertolucci keeps the actors in an
emotional middle ground, rather than locking them into a strong,
fully-explained passion. This leaves room to interpret words or deeds in
different ways. Does Kinsky love Shandurai or is he merely infatuated?
Does he hope to make her happy or does he hope to win her love? Does she
love him, or is she merely grateful? Different answers could leave
viewers with completely different ideas about what the movie was about.</P>
<P>That's not to say that Bertolucci was being vague. Rather, he was
acknowledging that when it comes to human behavior, there is usually no
single, identifiable motivation.</P>
