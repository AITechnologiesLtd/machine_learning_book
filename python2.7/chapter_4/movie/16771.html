<PRE>              A REVIEW OF "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"
                       by Ryan Ellis</PRE>
<P>give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, <A HREF="mailto:iluvmick@hotmail.com">iluvmick@hotmail.com</A></P>
<P>        Steven Spielberg is a busy man. He's got a lot to worry
about with his leadership of 'Dreamworks SKG' and concurrently
trying to find scripts that appeal to the artist inside him.
Fortunately, a man with his kind of stroke in Hollywood can take
producing credit on some lesser projects and then direct his
personal favourites. Only his 6th directing effort of the '90s,
"Saving Private Ryan" is his most brutal, and perhaps most
honest, film.
        Like Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece, "Schindler's List", this
picture has historic significance. People can study "Saving
Private Ryan" and actually learn something about the horrors of
World War II. Now, don't assume that "study" means that young
kids should see this. They certainly should NOT see it because
the violence is so brutally frightening. What happens to the men
in this picture makes the violence in most action films look even
MORE cartoonish than usual. This is blood and guts at its
stripped-down core.
        And gore may have never been shown on the silver screen like
this. Even stupid slasher flicks haven't shown this much
diversity in how to kill people. The now-famous first 25 minutes
of "Saving Private Ryan" is the D-Day invasion on Omaha Beach.
The Allied Forces storm the beach to take it from the Germans by
sending in the ground troops to break down the defences. Before
many of the young men ever get off the boats, they're shot like
sittin' ducks. Using a great deal of hand-held camera shots and
terrific make-up, Spielberg shows men loosing limbs, internal
organs, heads, and obviously their lives throughout the bloody
invasion. As the bodies pile up and the audience grip their
arm-rests, the troops surge forward to "take the beach".
Ultimately successful in their primary objective, but faced with
massive loss of lives, the armed forces do what you do in war
when bad stuff happens--move on.        
        So, having said that, the movie would not have worked if the
main characters were not likable. And who's more likable on the
big screen than Tom Hanks? The two-time Oscar-winner is as close
to a modern-day Jimmy Stewart as we have. Heck, I'd follow Tom
Hanks into war. Nominated for another Academy Award as Captain
John Miller, Hanks leads a platoon of 7 other men into the heart
of a war-torn Europe. Their mission--and they have no choice but
to accept it--is to find the youngest son of a mother who has
already lost his 3 older brothers. They have orders to bring him
out so he can go home.
        On the surface, it's a simple story and one that COULD end
when they find Private Ryan (Matt Damon). A poor movie would end
with the trumpets blaring and the credits rolling when the entire
platoon stumbles victoriously into friendly territory with the
young fella. This film is better than that. It dares to give us a
reason to believe in their mission of endangering 8 lives for the
life of 1. You believe in their mission by the time the final
guns go off and just have to love these fightin' men. A part of
you dies when they die. Well, not ALL of them end up dead, but
let's be honest--even if you haven't seen the film--they're not
all coming out alive. After all, this is war and war is hell.
        Young Ryan responds in perhaps the most honest and
honourable way he could when the platoon find him--he refuses to
leave because he feels obligated to stay and defend a bridge with
his new "brothers", his squadron. The climactic battle with the
heavily fortified Germans is almost as messy as the D-Day
invasion. The out-manned Americans fight gallantly, but this
final battle rivals the one on Omaha Beach in terms of bloodshed.
        It's strange that one of the hottest actors on the planet,
Matt Damon, is not the star of this show (even if he IS the title
character). He is appropriately cast as the boy they're trying to
save. You feel the same way the platoon does when they first see
him--all the bellyaching about the mission is easily forgettable
when you put a face to the name. The chief "bellyacher" is Reiben
(Edward Burns). Playing the wisecracking' kid from Brooklyn,
Burns looked to be a good bet to receive an Oscar nomination.
Since he didn't, he can take something far more valuable from
this film--as a young director, he got to work with the immortal
Spielberg. Tom Sizemore, who plays loyal Sgt. Horvath, could have
been an Oscar-finalist, too, since he so epitomized the
toughness, grit, and sincerity of the group. Also, Jeremy Davies,
the green corporal brought along to translate, is like a small
child caught in a mansized nightmare. He's very good in his role,
as well.
        In all, "Saving Private Ryan" was nominated for 11 Academy
Awards, ranging from sound to art direction to score (John
Williams, alas) to the phenomenal make-up. However, it didn't get
the nod for Visual Effects and that's just not right. All those
bullets and explosions and hideous deaths were worthy of some
recognition. So, if the Academy won't do it, then I'll recognize
it here--the terrific special effects were award-worthy because
they were helpful to the story, rather than BEING the story.
        Spielberg has now shown the Jewish side and the American
side of WWII. It will be interesting to see if he takes a big
risk and tackles a project that shows the German, Japanese, or
even the Russian side of that war. If he does, he could be in
line for a third Best Director Oscar (provided he wins this year,
of course).
        This is only the second movie I've ever seen twice in a
theatre and it's good enough to be seen again. When I walked out
of the cinema the first time last summer, I said "there's your
Oscar winner right there". I stand by that quote even today,
despite the wonderful rivalry that should develop between "Saving
Private Ryan" and "Shakespeare In Love". Both films are worthy in
this two-horse race, but the great Steven Spielberg deserves a
2nd Best Director Oscar. I believe he'll win it for this film.</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--If Tom Hanks wins his 3rd Oscar, he would become
the first actor to ever win 3 awards in a leading role (all of
them in just 6 years!).</P>
<P>This film receives a 10/10.
It also ranks #74 on My 100 Favourite Films list.</P>
