Virgin Suicides</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>The provocative title "Virgin Suicides" connotes a rough edgy film shaded
with dark humor and graphic violence - perhaps even sporting a grainy 16mm
touch and feel to the projection on screen. But in reality, "Virgin
Suicides" plays out more like the "growing up" stories of "Liberty Heights"
or "October Sky" as it utilizes the suicides of five beautiful, blonde, teen
sisters as the story's vehicle.</P>
<P>Rewinding to the 1970's, this suburban high school tale aspires to recreate
the mystery, magic and agony of teendom.</P>
<P>Doctor to patient, "What are you doing here? You're not even old enough to
know how bad life can get."</P>
<P>Suicidal teen, "Obviously doctor, you've never been a 13 year old girl."</P>
<P>Narrator Giovani Ribisi recounts the events that lead up to the final
suicides, while simultaneously introducing us to the Lisbon sisters, his
group of neighborhood boys, and the intersection thereof. Though the
filmmakers' constantly seem to be telling this tale as some sort of
cathartic therapy toward understanding the suicides and therefore, I don't
know, comprehending life itself a little better; it unfortunately seems more
of an insincere excuse to relate a rather interesting story. In fact, it
isn't necessary that Ribisi needs to or even cares to know the WHY's. The
fact is, the story itself is compelling enough. In this way, it's not unlike
a bystander ogling a car-wreck for the inexplicable guttural attraction,
then trying to excuse his interest as purely investigatory.</P>
<P>But that's just what I saw, here's what the director had to say, "It's about
mortality and obsession and love. It isn't about romanticizing suicide. I
never saw the Lisbon sisters or their acts as real and I don't think they
were intended to be. The Lisbons are the figments of memory, these lovely
mythical creatures of the imagination who are more beautiful than reality
can ever be, so of course they cannot last."</P>
<P>Still, this is my review. The reasons for the suicides seem rather strongly
implied if not plainly obvious. Personally, I'd rather have had them left
mysterious. But as long as they weren't, any pursuit to their understanding
by Ribisi seems insulting. A focus from the domineeringly oppressive
parents' perspective, may have been a curious direction, though that would
have been another project all together. James Woods is awesome, albeit a
minor character, as the submissively bliss math teacher father; while
Kathleen Turner (mom) rules the house with an iron-gate fist.</P>
<P>In the end, this is not really the edgy graphic picture you'd expect. It's a
coming of age tale about boys and girls that never quite comes of age
itself, but still makes an interesting story. Ribisi's narration generalizes
the difference between the sexes, "We know that they knew everything about
us, but we couldn't fathom them at all."</P>
<P>Debuting director Soffie Coppla (daughter of Francis Ford) shows great
talent in portraing the moments. A family at home watching nature TV with
the handsome young male guest, a bare foot on the coffee table, the uneasy
parents. But this particular film, though compelling (even humorous) at
times, doesn't quite fill out in the end.</P>
