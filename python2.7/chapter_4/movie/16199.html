<P>A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ** (out of ****)
Paramount / 1:27 / 1998 / PG-13 (language, sexual/crude humor, bad hair)
Cast: Will Ferrell; Chris Kattan; Dan Hedaya; Molly Shannon; Richard 
Grieco; Loni Anderson; Elisa Donovan; Gigi Rice; Lochlyn Munro; Colin 
Quinn; Chazz Palminteri 
Director: John Fortenberry 
Screenplay: Steve Koren; Will Ferrell; Chris Kattan <HR>"Wayne's World" aside, turning favorite "Saturday Night Live" shtick 
into box office gold has been nothing but risky business - you might 
remember any one of "Coneheads," "Stuart Saves His Family" or "It's 
Pat," and if you don't, that's the idea. What works on television in 
five-minute portions is more than likely going to suffer when the 
running time and picture size are multiplied by 17, and that's just the 
problem with "A Night at the Roxbury," "SNL"'s latest skit-to-screen 
offering. It falls somewhere between the "Wayne" highs and the "Pat" 
lows. </P>
<P>The "SNL" incarnation of "Roxbury," as fans of the show already know, 
follows the plight of two wild-and-crazy-wannabes (played by Will 
Ferrell and Chris Kattan) as they peruse - and get thrown out of - the 
L.A. club scene for violently pelvic-thrusting pretty ladies, all the 
while bobbing their heads to the beat of Haddaway's dance hit "What Is 
Love?" Not much meat to build an 87-minute story on, and boy, does it 
show. For those keeping track, the movie's biggest accomplishment is 
giving these loser siblings names - Steve and Doug Butabi. </P>
<P>The Butabis ambition, for lack of a better word, is to one day gain 
passage into the Roxbury, a swank, Studio 54-esque nightspot that celebs 
like Richard Grieco (playing himself) frequent. Once Steve (Ferrell) and 
Doug (Kattan) finally make it inside, due to a Grieco-involved auto 
mishap that's perhaps the most complicated thing about the film, the 
Roxbury angle is pushed aside for some boring business involving trampy 
golddiggers, brotherly dissension and Steve's impending nuptials with 
the heiress (Molly Shannon) of a lightbulb enterprise. </P>
<P>At least that last development allows for an uproarious wedding climax 
that manages to pull off witty jabs at "The Graduate," "Say Anything 
..." and "Jerry Maguire," all one right after the other. And although 
those spoofs are probably "A Night at the Roxbury"'s sole claims to 
hitting the comedic bullseye, there is enough sporadic lowbrow silliness 
to impress those looking for a cinematic good time a la "Dumb and 
Dumber" - these guys make those guys look like Stanford grads. Ferrell 
and Kattan must be, er, complimented for their ability to, uh, lose 
themselves in their characters. </P>
<P>Loni Anderson shows up with that scary cleavage of hers as the Butabi's 
plastic surgery-addicted mom, and Chazz Palminteri does a turn as the 
Roxbury's owner, a goateed lothario fond of asking various friends and 
patrons, "Did you grab my a--?" But the former refrains from speaking 
much and the latter isn't even billed - it seems that even the on-hand 
talent was aware of how unevenly unhip "A Night at the Roxbury" is. Oh, 
sure, those that eat the Butabis up in their weekly fragmented "SNL" 
format will really love this ... but what is love, really?<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

whites will be embarrassed. The movie will bring us all together, I 
imagine, in paralyzing boredom." -Roger Ebert on "B.A.P.S."</P>
