                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     About 150 years ago there was the Victorian age, known for decorum
and modesty, even prudery.  When we think of that period, the very
word, "Victorian" brings that certain image to mind. Still, people are
unpredictable and, regardless of the age in which they live, there are
secrets about which most of us know nothing.  One such secret was
discovered by a naturalist, William @Adamson (Mark Rylance) who lost
all his specimens he had studied and collected in South America when on
his return to England he was shipwrecked.</P>
<P>     Many educated and wealthy men of the time engaged in studying
nature.  When one such, the Reverend Alabaster, (Jeremy Kemp) heard of
the disaster that had befallen Adamson, he took him into his home where
Adamson met and fell in love with the beautiful daughter of the
Reverend, Eugenia (Patsy Kensit).</P>
<P>     Adamson seemed to have indeed fallen into great luck but nothing
ever runs smoothly.  Adamson wondered why his wife was a tiger in bed
at night but a cool cucumber during the day.  He could find no
explanation.  The other bothersome part of being in the household was
that his brother-in-law, Edgar, (Douglas Henshall)  who despite being
of the aristocracy was in fact a disgruntled boor and seemed to have an
intense dislike of Adamson.  It seems that he wanted the Alabaster
family kept pure; Adamson does not fill the mold of a blond, beautiful
family.  When the secret of the Alabasters is out, it is an exploding
bombshell.</P>
<P>     The film is ably helped by Mary (Kristin Scott Thomas), a poor
relation who lives with the family but who has more in common
intellectually with William than he does with his wife.</P>
<P>     While on the surface this may appear to be a costume film of the
Victorian Age, with the evolutionary theory of Darwin making its
presence known, the movie is much, much more.  Highly recommended.</P>
