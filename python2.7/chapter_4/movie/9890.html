A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:
John Leonetti</PRE>
<P>Screenplay written by: Brent Friedman and Bryce Zabel (original story
written by Lawrence Kasanoff, Joshua Wexler, and John Tobias).</P>
<P>Starring: Robin Shou, Taliso Soto, James Remar, Sandra Hess, Lynn "Red"
Williams</P>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Other dimensions, fate of the world, martial arts heroes, costumed
villains, karate babes</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
This is not a sentimental movie, a 'date' movie, or a thriller. It's the
sequel to ‘Mortal Kombat,' a 1995 movie based on a popular video game.
In the original ‘Mortal Kombat' an immortal named Lord Rayden chose
three heroes - -  nice Hong Kong guy Liu Kang, SWAT team leader Sonya
Blade, and movie star Johnny Cage - - to represent the planet earth in a
high stakes interdimensional martial arts tournament called Mortal
Kombat. Talisa Soto played Kitana, the princess from another dimension
who helped the heroes succeed. In this sequel, ‘Mortal Kombat:
Annihilation,' no sooner do the victorious heroes return to earth with
their friend Princess Kitana than another crisis presents itself. 
Shao-Kahn, the evil emperor of Outworld, has hatched a plot to kill Lord
Rayden and the heroes, and take over the earth by merging it with
another dimension.  Shao-Kahn kills Johnny, captures Kitana to set a
death trap for the heroes, and then sets about destroying the earth with
rocket-launching techno-ninjas, a zombified queen, a centaur creature,
scorpion monsters, martial arts armies, and evil siblings. Meanwhile the
heroes enlist the aid of Sonya Blade's old SWAT team pal Jax, and start
kicking booty. Will good triumph over evil?</P>
<P>Opinion: 
This is the kind of movie that adolescent guys will love. If you liked
the first ‘Mortal Kombat,' with it's hyperactive high-kicking male and
female leads, you'll like this movie, which emphasizes state-of-the-art
special effects, great fight photography, and martial arts choreography,
and de-emphasizes a confusing mythic plot. The visual "oomph" emphasis
is probably due to that fact that director John Leonetti is best known
for photography - - he was the director of photography on ‘The Mask' and
on ‘Mortal Kombat,' while his brother Matthew shot ‘Star Trek: First
Contact.' ‘Mortal Kombat: Annihilation' uses an eclectic blend of fresh
fight choreography from a number of different fighting arts involving
plenty of aerial kicks and trampoline-style spinning jumps. The CG
(computer generated) characters manage to do decent fight scenes as
well. In other words, this movie puts American fight choreography up
there with Hong Kong wu shu. For Asian-Americans and for Hollywood,
‘Mortal Kombat: Annihilation' will be a test of how willing the American
public is to pay money to view an Asian movie protagonist. Producer
Larry Kasanoff, who also produced  ‘Terminator 2' is producing this
film.</P>
<P>Stars: 
Robin Shou, the leading man in ‘Mortal Kombat' and ‘Mortal Kombat:
Annihiliation' was born in Hong Kong but moved to Los Angeles at age
eleven and obtained a degree in civil engineering from CSU Los Angeles.
He worked for a year and half as a soil engineer, but eventually moved
to Hong Kong, became a movie stuntman, and finally worked his way into
playing villains. After nine years of Hong Kong movies, he went to a
friend's barbecue in California and met an agent, who suggested that
Robin audition for ‘Mortal Kombat.' Robin's martial arts style is wu
shu, a cinematic mixture of martial arts forms and dramatic
presentation. As a college he became so excited about wushu that he sold
his car and skipped a quarter of school to fly to China and study it.</P>
<P>Model-turned-actress Talisa Soto is best known for playing James Bond
Girl Lupe Lamora in ‘License to Kill.' To my knowledge she is the first
Hispanic Bond Girl.</P>
