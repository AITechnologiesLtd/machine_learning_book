<PRE>Star power is a tricky thing. </PRE>
<P>In some respects it can count for a lot -- the classic example is Jim
Carrey, otherwise known as the Twenty Million Dollar Man -- and in other
respects it can count for very little. AT FIRST SIGHT, a recent romantic
release, dropped off the Top Ten charts only three weeks after debuting
despite trumpeting the names of Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino. Eventually,
that may be the case for the latest drama from WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN
director Luis Mandoki, but it's clear initially that MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE
is drawing a tidy sum from its leading names. </P>
<P>Those leading names are Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, and Paul
Newman, and each has something to offer this romantic tale of love under
precarious circumstances. Costner has it all backwards, making something
out of nothing and nothing out of something, but by this point in his
career he's mastered the art and we've come to expect it from him. Robin
Wright Penn, of FORREST GUMP notoriety, even manages to make Costner's
frequent missteps look charming, and together the two create quite a
screen presence. Newman lends comic relief in fine form, giving a much
more memorable performance than his last outing in the crime drama
TWILIGHT. </P>
<P>Here, Costner plays sea dog and widower Garret Blake, a sailboat expert
who lost his wife several years ago and now writes bottled romantic
epistles to her. Jogging along the beach one day while on vacation,
divorced newspaper researcher Theresa Osborne finds one of these
messages and takes it back to Chicago to check it out. Using
professional connections and doing some tidy sleuth work on her own, she
tracks the messages back to Garret and smoothly works her way into a
love affair with the man. The two share a common feeling of neglect, and
share their love by throwing marshmallows at each other before snuggling
up by a fire on the beach. All of this is very romantic, except for the
fact that Theresa's secret of how she found Garret threatens to tip the
balance. </P>
<P>The movie plays out like THE HORSE WHISPERER Lite, with all of the grand
cinematography of Big Sky country replaced by cramped silhouettes of
sailboats on the Carolina coast at dusk. Gone is the silent brooding of
the Robert Redford film, and instead we get Robin Wright Penn and Kevin
Costner doing voice-overs that lack all emotion but will still manage
evince a tear in every woman's eye. The red-blooded American males in
the audience will appreciate the movie's lone fight scene, in which a
disgruntled Costner suplexes his opponent on a diner table before being
told by the assembled crowd, "It's not worth it, Garret." </P>
<P>Truth be told, the movie does manage to play itself out fairly
efficiently, and its 145-minute running time hardly seems that long. The
drama is solid, providing metaphors for Garret's maturity with his
personal project of constructing a sailboat. When the sequences begin to
scrape the bottom, Paul Newman enters with a witty line and a twinkle in
his eye. There's not a specific flaw to be found, other than the movie's
refusal to break from tradition and its seamless devotion to the
predictable. The ending does not come as a surprise, and encapsulates
the whole affair with startling precision. On the whole, this isn't a
light and breezy romantic comedy but a moody drama which will have those
leaving the theater feeling disenfranchised. But it just might be worth
it, anyway. </P>
