<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>One thing you have to give the entire 'Alien' series credit for is the
fact that they are all vastly different.  Four different directors
have injected their vision of horror in space battling ugly creatures
of unspeakable strength.  Ridley Scott got the ball rolling in 1979
with 'Alien' and chose a very relaxed and later tension filled pace in
which the main characters get eliminated one by one.  As a visionary
piece of film making it was genuinely original but as a character
study and a film of plotting, it was shallow.  James Cameron picked
things up in 1986 with 'Aliens' and Cameron had two things to his
advantage.  First, he also wrote the script to it which gave him
latitude to invent things at anytime on the set and secondly, he
challenged the intellectual aspects of the first film by moving 180
degrees the other way and giving the audience a spectacular roller
coaster ride of soldiers creating their own demise by underestimating
their enemy.  Again, the main characters get eliminated one by one and
the few survivors that remain give the film a better ending than the
first film.  Unfortunately the third film, 'Alien 3' from 1992 had a
former music video director (David Fincher) at the helm and the film
suffered from dizzying camera work too incoherent for its own good and
a feeling of dreadful torment which instead of entertaining the
audience, it merely gave them an opportunity to see how the story of
Ellen Ripley would come to an end.  It had some good moments but for
an intended end to a classic film trilogy it was no classic itself.
Proof of its failure as an appropriate way to end things is found in a
fourth film which tries to redeem the series and end things once and
for all.</P>
<P>'Alien Resurrection' is directed by by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and is
written by Joss Whedon and I'm sorry to say that it is a major
disappointment.  It chooses a straight forward formula path in which
to tell its story.  A covert government operation in space is breeding
a new batch of the horrible creatures and little is known about them
by this crew who believe they can contain them in chambers for
experimental study.  The corrupt general in charge (Dan Hedaya) of the
space station operation sells out to a band of space travelers who are
criminals of a terrorist proportion.  Ron Perlman (t.v.'s 'Beauty and
the Beast') is the most slimy and potentially dangerous of the band
and Winona Ryder is portrayed as one of the gang as well and she is
badly casted in a role not suited for her talents.  Naturally, the
creatures get loose and all hell breaks loose again and a group of
people battles to survive in an unoriginal manner which we've seen
three times before.</P>
<P>Sigourney Weaver who played Ripley in the first three films and who
died in the third one is cloned here with some DNA from the creatures
she battles and her character of the new Ripley this time is
unattractive and robotic at best.  Her leadership is badly needed in
this film and I found her character could have been better written.
On the plus side, this film looks great and has the usual computerized
special effects which are now standard procedure for movies and the
technical aspects all around are impressive but its attempt to redeem
itself from the failure of the third film is only mildly successful
and its shallow attempt at continuing the story that should have been
laid to rest long ago is painfully obvious.</P>
