                            EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY
                         A film review by Jeff Meyer
                          Copyright 1989 Jeff Meyer</PRE>
<P>[Seen at the Seattle International Film Festival]</P>
<P>EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY (USA, 1988)
Director: Julian Temple
Screenwriters: Julie Brown, Charlie Coffey, Terrance E. McNally
Cast: Gena Davis, Jeff Goldblum, Julie Brown, Jim Carrey, Damon Waylans,
      Michael McKean, Charles Rocket</P>
<P>     As Dennis Miller might say, "Hey, what can I tell ya?"  You got your horny
aliens from outer space, who (once they've had the Nair treatment) look just
like humans.  You got your attractive, pleasant, somewhat naive hairdresser
who's looking for Mr.  Right.  You've got that mythical plastic Southern
California Suburban World of beaches, bimbos and blondes to let the cast play
around with.  And you've got 45 minutes of the old "gotta keep the nice aliens
from being discovered" theme, which was getting stale back when Bill Bixby
hadn't even thought about having a weekly green steroid treatment.  What do YOU
think is going to happen?</P>
<P>     Well, you're right.  Outside of some of Julie Brown's bouncy pop tunes,
there isn't much here to entertain.  There's certainly no surprises; I found
about two jokes funny (and a nice shot which is FLY-inspired), and the scenes
with Goldblum (head alien and romantic love interest of Davis' character (and,
I guess, Davis)) and company learning Earth customs is a pale retread of other
pale retreads.  (I can remember the one part I enjoyed -- the prosthetic tongue
scene -- simply because it stood out among such a completely familiar
background.)  Goldblum looks a little uncomfortable, even for a space alien in
California.  Davis holds up well, and you end up hoping that she and Goldblum
had a good time working together again.  Charles Rocket plays his usual role as
the yuppie rotter; he must be sorry that MOONLIGHTING is gone, as it appears to
be the only place he ever got to stretch his talents some.  The only thing I
really enjoyed about the film were the opening credits (you'd think they were
done by Pee-wee Herman), the art direction, and the old SF props/masks/suits
that they got out for Davis' dream sequence.  Other than that, *yawn*.</P>
<P>     I have the feeling that the director and screenwriters saw HAIRSPRAY and
thought they were working at something similar here.  They aren't; HAIRSPRAY is
an immensely well-crafted film that balances its elements with exceptional
precision, and comes out with a film that is parody, satire AND an actual
"teen" film at the same time.  This film just reminds you of how many comic
alien films you've seen before, and that while you might like Julie Brown's
songs, at least they're over in five minutes.</P>
