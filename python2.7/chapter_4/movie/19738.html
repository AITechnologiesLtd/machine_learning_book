<P>My Life So Far is the kind of slice of life old school stories that
print critics wax poetic over. I could see calling it a well-acted,
intimate portrait of a puritan Scots family confronted by the deadly
sins of lust and greed, while dealing with a young boy's awakening
sexual curiosity. That's fair, but it doesn't relay the fact that this
flick is a dud.</P>
<P>Cranky has thought long and hard about why this beautifully photographed
film falls short of expectations -- director Hugh Hudson and producer
David Puttnam last worked together on Chariots of Fire; Puttnam is
responsible for the most excellent and highly recommended Local Hero. My
conclusions after the synopsis.</P>
<P>Set in Argyll, Scotland in 1927 My Life So Far is narrated by 10 year
old Fraser Pettigrew (Robbie Norman), a red haired, blue eyed cutey. His
father Edward (Colin Firth) is a bit of an eccentric inventor, whose
obsession with creating products out of moss brings him into conflict
with brother-in-law Morris (Malcolm McDowell). Morris, a self-made
millionaire, wants control of the family's estate, called Kilronan,
currently lorded over by his mom "Gamma MacIntosh" (Rosemary Harris).
Not only is Morris rich, this sixty-ish gent is sporting a brand-new
24-year old French wife named Heloise (Irene Jacob) whose affection for
young Fraser makes daddy Edward jealous. Wife Moira (Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio) keeps a stiff upper lip when she uncovers evidence of
Edward's infidelity.</P>
<P>Fraser narrates the story and, from time to time, inflicts bits of
wisdom gleaned from his deceased Grandfather's "Encyclopedia of Ethics"
into the family conversations. Problem is, the "encyclopedia" documents
various sexual peccadilloes and practices that the ten year old is way
to young to understand -- he suggests, for example, that his mother and
new aunt engage in the practice of prostitution to raise money to aid
the poor.</P>
<P>Yes, it's funny. Kidlets talking dirty always is, especially with the
upper class language that is the territory of this tale. But having a
ten year old, who has no conception of the sexual conflicts raging among
the adults around him, narrate the tale does nothing but hinder the
greater story. While Edward explains to Fraser that Beethoven is the
music that God dreams while Jazz is music that the Devil creates, the
boy is too young to understand the sexual subtext that jazz brought to
the 1920s. And this flick is packed with sexual symbolism. Hudson does a
visual dance around the question of whether Edward raped Heloise, or if
their one and only dalliance was consensual. (It's hard applying 1990s
standards to a 1920s setting. What may have been considered sexual
pressure as little as twenty years ago is considered "rape" today.) It
matters not to Moira, whose emotions are bottled up until the very end
of the flick.</P>
<P>Sorry, Cranky's writing like a film student. It happens from time to
time. But there's only a paragraph or so to go, so hang in there.</P>
<P>The print critics may rave about fine acting performances, and there are
two to be mentioned here: Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who has little to
say, and must bear her emotional consternation silently; Malcolm
McDowell, as the loud (sic) I-know-better-than-you uncle whose character
is a flame burning in an emotionally dense fog. As good as this pair
are, it's not enough to recommend My Life So Far.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to My Life So Far, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$1.00</PRE>
<P>A Dud's a dud, regardless of the big name's attached.</P>
