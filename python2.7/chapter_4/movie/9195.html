<PRE>                                 L.A. CONFIDENTIAL
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
                        Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: *** (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>It's the early 1950s and the lure of Tinseltown brings the hapless and the
hopeful to the City of Angels.  Maybe to make it as a Hollywood movie star.
Or maybe just to see one.</P>
<P>But beneath the glitz and the glamour and the celebrity lies a dark and
dangerous underbelly--crooked cops, mob rule, corruption, homicide, vice.
The L.A.P.D. have their hands (or pockets) full.  The relationship between
three officers--men with very different agendas--forms the fascinating core
of "L.A. Confidential," writer/director Curtis Hanson's stylish, handsome
adaptation of James Ellroy's noir novel.  It's a story about the good, the
bad, and the beautiful.</P>
<P>Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is young, college educated, and politically astute.
He does things by the book, refuses to take payoffs, and snitches on fellow
officers, all in the name of justice (and career advancement).  Exley is
not the most popular policeman on the force.</P>
<P>Bud White (Russell Crowe), on the other hand, believes that the quickest
way to get a confession out of a suspect is to beat it out of him.  He's a
muscle guy who uses violence as "a necessary adjunct to the job."  His
sense of justice isn't much different from Exley's, but his methods are.</P>
<P>Then there's Jack Vincennes (the terrific Kevin Spacey), a flashy,
showbiz-influenced crimestopper who acts as technical advisor for a
Dragnet-style television show.  Vincennes also scams for a sleazy tabloid,
getting front-page notoriety nabbing potheads in the act by Hush Hush
huckster Sid Hudgeons (Danny DeVito).</P>
<P>Sparks fly as Ed, Bud, and Jack's distinctly differing styles come into
conflict--and out again--as they investigate the Nite Owl Massacre, a
six-person bloodbath in a coffee shop that took one of their own.  Adding
pudding to the mix is an icy cool millionaire pornographer pimp (David
Strathairn), whose hookers are cut to look like movie stars.  These include
the Veronica Lake-inspired Lynn Bracken, played by a smoldering Kim
Basinger in some great-looking, gravity-defying gowns.</P>
<PRE>It's absorbing, colorful stuff.</PRE>
<P>Curtis Hanson has taken a significant step forward with this film,
displaying depth and detail that was lacking in his previous psycho-bound
thrillers, "The River Wild" and "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."  Lovingly
photographed by Dante Spinotti, "L.A. Confidential" is sleek and
satisfying, full of complex characters expertly played by a fine cast.
While the plot's intricate twists and turns pay homage to noir films of the
'40s and '50s, the film maintains a 1990's sensibility with some extreme
bloodletting, so be warned.  Otherwise, "L.A. Confidential" is a solid,
confident thriller.</P>
