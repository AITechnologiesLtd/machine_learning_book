<P>I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *1/2 (out of ****)
Columbia / 1:36 / 1998 / R (garden tool gore, terror, language, pot use, 
assorted idiocies)
Cast: Jennifer Love Hewitt; Brandy; Freddie Prinze, Jr.; Mekhi Phifer; 
Muse Watson; Bill Cobbs; Matthew Settle; Jeffery Combs; Jennifer 
Esposito; John Hawkes 
Director: Danny Cannon 
Screenplay: Trey Callaway<HR>Movies don't come much more ridiculously titled than "I Still Know What 
You Did Last Summer," but since the movie in question is best described 
as ridiculous, the title sort of works as a warning. More than a 
silly-sounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor, this horror 
sequel's moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw 
the original will be able to spot: What "you" did _last_ summer "you" 
actually did the summer _before_ last summer, and since "I" knew about 
it _this_ summer as well as _last_ summer, it's really illogical to say 
that "I" _still_ know what "you" did _last_ summer. </P>
<P>The filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter "I Still 
Know," the longer "I Still Know What You Did Two Summers Ago" or the 
appropriate "Stupid People Getting Hacked to Bits." That last suggestion 
is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that 
are the polar opposite of smart. For example, if your roommate is 
plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly 
murdered not long ago, would you sneak into her room late at night and 
hide in the closet, even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute 
little dress? </P>
<P>Probably not, but that's precisely what college student Karla (pop diva 
Brandy) does to best friend Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), resulting in 
the first in a long line of phony frights. Julie, you'll recall, was one 
of the sole survivors at the end of 1997's surprise hit "I Know What You 
Did Last Summer," after a slasher with a grudge to bear - it's a _long_ 
story - began trying to pick off her, her buddies and various others in 
their coastal Carolina village. In this installment, the plot picks up 
as Karla wins a trip to the Bahamas, and Julie, yet racked by guilt, 
decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind. </P>
<P>Yeah, right. Their island paradise has room, of course, for one more in 
the form of the still-alive killer (Muse Watson) from the first film. He 
sports the same Gorton's Fisherman get-up, a heavy hat and rain slicker 
that mask his identity, but why he's still trying to stay anonymous is a 
mystery this movie never solves ... though I suppose his hook-hand would 
look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit. In a sense, 
that's the movie's glaring flaw - everybody knows who the bad guy is, 
thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its 
prequel. </P>
<P>The murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary, but 
Trey Callaway's derivative "I Still Know" screenplay makes the Fisherman 
just as dumb as his pretty potential victims. When Julie lays blissfully 
unaware in a tanning bed, giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance 
once and for all, what does he do? He twist-ties the lid shut and cranks 
up the UV rays - you'd think he'd want her gutted now instead of a skin 
cancer victim later. Even prequel "Summer" lovers might balk at how 
little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few 
neat-o shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh. </P>
<P>The innovative gallows humor that scribe (and "Scream" wunderkind) Kevin 
Williamson injected into "I Know"'s unfolding story is sorely missed, 
replaced with the grating antics of a white Rastafarian cabana boy who 
smokes weed and tosses off slang like "yo"; you'll cheer - not shriek - 
when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his 
chest. If "I Know What You Did Last Summer," however effective, was just 
the kind of movie that those subversive "Scream" flicks poked fun at, 
then the deadly "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer" deserves a 
full-blown roasting on "Mystery Science Theatre 3000."<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"After the screening was over and the lights went up, I observed a 
couple of my colleagues in deep and earnest conversation, trying to 
resolve twists in the plot. They were applying more thought to the movie 
than the makers did. A critic's mind is a terrible thing to waste."
