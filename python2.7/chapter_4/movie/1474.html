<PRE>                              ENCHANTED APRIL
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is a light and *very* pleasant
     comedy that could be used as an ad for the Italian Tourism
     Board.  It starts like E. M. Forster's indignant social
     dramas and then unwinds under the warm Italian sun into a
     rich romantic comedy.  It features beautiful settings and
     people you would love to meet.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     I admit it.  The reason I wanted to see this movie was because I wanted
to see more of Miranda Richardson.  No, I wasn't taken with her stunning
beauty.  I just saw her in one film clip in which she had no lines.  She was
only reacting to a conversation between Josie Lawrence and Joan Plowright.
The conversation was funny but Richardson's reactions were priceless.  I
admit it was a silly reason to pay $7 to see a film but nothing else in the
film appealed to me.  And this is a film that turned out to be well worth
seeing.  This film seamlessly bridges the gap between E. M. Forster social
indignation and a Shakespearean romanticism.</P>
<P>     It is a rainy, ugly winter in 1922 London.  Lottie Wilkins (played by
Josie Lawrence) sees a stranger, Rose Arbuthnot (played by Miranda
Richardson) wistfully looking at the same newspaper ad that she had.  It
offered a Northern Italian castle for rent for April ... "wisteria and
sunshine."  Both women are unhappily married, Lottie to a miserly
businessman (played by Alfred Molina) and Rose to a writer of sexy novels
(played by Jim Broadbent).  With four women they might be able to swing the
vacation.  They find a crusty old harridan, Mrs. Fisher, whose father knew
every great literary genius of his generation.  Also there is a world-weary
heiress, Lady Caroline Dester.  Soon the mousey Lottie and Rose find why it
is not good to travel with strangers.  Mrs. Fisher is selfish and nasty,
Lady Caroline is cold and aloof.  Then the warmth and the beauty of
Portofino begins to work a kind of magic on all.</P>
<P>     Mike Newell, who previously directed the horror film THE AWAKENING and
later directed Richardson in DANCE WITH A STRANGER, here directs a
surprisingly magnetic film.  Peter Barnes adapted the 1922 novel by
Elizabeth von Armin.  The film was shot in the same castle where von Armin
wrote her novel.  Each of the four actresses has opportunities to stand out
and Molina's half-serious, half-comic role is also a positive pleasure.
Watching this film is like taking a pleasant vacation.  This is one of the
year's best films.  I rate it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
