<PRE>Taking a Punch Below the Belt
Hurricane</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Entitled "Hurricane" and whirling with hype, the film is good, but doesn't
quite pack the stormy punch you'd rightfully have anticipated. Less a fight
movie, and more a quiet emotional story of one man's endurance in the face
of racism and injustice.</P>
<P>In a black and white 1966 clip, boxer Ruben "Hurricane" Carter muscles his
helpless competitor to the canvas, woven into this sequence is a color 1974
sequence in which an imprisoned Carter prepares to defend himself against
reactionary guards. An excellent introduction after which the film
experiences an early lull of about a half-hour. Also the caption "7 years
later" appears on the screen confusing the time line issue (7 years from '66
or '74?).</P>
<P>Carter's autobiography serves as a convenient way to cover past history. The
stuttering stubborn boy who plays a child Ruben Carter sets the stage well
for the experienced Washington who is very good, but never breaks loose
(performance speaking). An hour or so into the film, a black teen (Lesra)
home-schooled by three white communal Canadians, becomes engrossed in
Carter's book "The 16th Round." This is when we as an audience are given a
sympathetic eye through which to view the drama. No longer innocent
by-standers, we become drawn into the ring by Lesras' passion and
compassion. It's the relationship between Ruben and Lesra that gives
"Hurricane" its thunder.</P>
<P>"Hate put me in prison, Love's gonna bust me out." The picture is seldom
short of this kind of schmaltz and Ruben is nearly always shown in a virtual
angelic light. Still, "Hurricane" endears, its positive message strongly
resonating.</P>
