<P>Independent director Tamara Hernandez's feature film debut, "Men Cry 
Bullets," is a quite provocative piece of work for one reason: in telling the 
story of a physically and emotionally abusive, love-hate relationship, it 
turns the cliche on its head by making a gender-swith and having the female 
as the dominant, forceful one, and the male as the passive, sensitive one. </P>
<P>"By reversing the genders in the film and showing the victim as a weak man 
and the abuser as a violent woman," speaks Hernandez, "I tried to express to 
men what it feels like to be a vulnerable girl, and to shed fresh light on 
the seductively insidious nature of abusive recognizable brutes." This 
potential gimmick ultimately works well in the finished product of 
Hernandez's film, and is ably equipped to encompass such a thing in order to 
create a believable story that, as in many abusive relationships, is headed 
for tragedy. </P>
<P>The film begins on the night of the innocuous, young Billy's (Steven Nelson) 
first performance in a club, posing as a drag queen. Dressed as his late 
mother (in flashbacks to his childhood, we see the abuse she took from his 
unstable father), Billy goes onstage and starts to hit it off until he is 
humiliated by the precarious, loudmouthed 33-year-old writer, Gloria Hunter 
(Honey Lauren), who assaults him when her boyfriend gets up on the stage to 
dance with him. Somehow drawn to Gloria, even after experiencing her juvenile 
ways, Billy goes to see her at her home, where she still lives with her 
parents and has a pig that she calls her child. Gloria half apologizes to 
him, she gets him to fix her breakfast, and then while out in the shed, she 
rapes him. Horrified and upset, Billy nonetheless begins an infatuation with 
her, and for brief, isolated moments, they appear to be a happy couple. 
Things grow more complicated with the appearance of Gloria's debutante 
cousin, Lydia (Jeri Ryan), a beautiful blonde who gradually forms the final 
part of a love triangle destined for failure and affliction.</P>
<P>"Men Cry Bullets" is an involving dark comedy-drama that, occasionally, is at 
least a little too offbeat and odd by a half, particularly in the final 
half-hour, which includes a drunken, fantasy-like three-way sex scene, a 
potential poisioning, and murder. The ending is especially unsatisfying, 
bringing the conflict to a close but, at the exact same time, creating new, 
more complicated problems that are never explored before the end credits 
roll. </P>
<P>For the first 70 minutes, however, the film works wonderfully, particularly 
due to Honey Lauren's dazzling performance. As the venemous, wicked Gloria, 
she adds unexpected dimension to the "villain" role by making her an 
alternately spiteful and likable woman. At times, when Gloria is not 
exploding into fits of rage, we are able to half understand her position. 
After all, she is edging into her mid-30s, still lives at home, does not have 
anyone to love except her pig, and is seeing a psychiatrist. It is also 
apparent that she respects her parents but, simply put, she is nothing but a 
child inside, albeit a dangeous one.</P>
<P>Steven Nelson has the right looks to be believable as Billy, an innocent man 
who also is often childish and haunted by his past, but unlike Gloria, keeps 
his feelings bottled up inside rather than taking them out on others. The 
problem with Nelson is that, in comparison to Lauren, he does not captivate 
the viewer as he should, nor did he really make me care for him. Oddly 
enough, I did care about the fate of Gloria, most likely because she was a 
more easily identifiable and multi-layered character.</P>
<P>Rounding out the three principles is Jeri Ryan (of TV's "Star Trek: Voyager") 
as the southern belle, Lydia. Ryan is often very funny, and runs with her 
flightly, unconciously egotistic lines of dialogue. The key to Lydia not 
turning into a stuck-up, dispicable character is that she really does care 
for her cousin, Gloria, and even admires her for her forthrightness. When 
Billy and Lydia become friends, and he starts to understand that he needs to 
say goodbye to his relationship with Gloria, Lydia makes a kind-hearted offer 
for him to come back with her when she returns to her southern home. Ryan is 
the most well-centered character of the three, and therefore, somewhat helps 
to keep the film from flying completely off the deep end in the over-the-top 
penultimate sequences.</P>
<P>"Men Cry Bullets" is a flawed motion picture, and yet it works despite its 
many problems. Digging underneath the surface, the film is basically about 
two unhappy people (Billy and Gloria) who have their own sets of serious 
problems and are both lonely individuals, but whose wildly diverse 
personalities do not mix, no matter how hard they try. Writer-director 
Hernandez is a promising talent who sometimes needlessly gets a little arty 
(such as pointlessly intermixing color and black-and-white photography), and 
who loses track of her realistic focus in the latter half, but never 
condescends to the characters or the audience. "Men With Bullets" is a tough, 
if uneven film, perfectly admirable for a first film from a new director, but 
something tells me Hernandez has stronger, more balanced stories to tell in 
the future, and those will be greatly anticipated by myself.</P>
