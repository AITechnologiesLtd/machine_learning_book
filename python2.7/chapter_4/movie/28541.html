<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Dutch-born but longtime Australian director, Paul Cox ("Lonely Hearts"),
has based this film on a short story set in the 19th century by Guy de
Maupassant called "La Chevelure." It's set in modern Australia and
concerns a bachelor named Bernard Simon (Chris Haywood), who is a
specialist in repairing antique clocks. He is obsessed by both clocks
and death, keeping a household full of such clocks. He likes the ones
that are not battery operated because they tick, therefore giving signs
they are alive. The protagonist's obsessions are so extreme, that he's
seeing a psychiatrist (Kaye) to get help in dealing with reality.</P>
<P>The story revolves around his newest romantic obsession, another
sensitive but lost soul like him, Terese (Gosia Dobrowolska). She's
unhappily married, and is a social worker for the Salvation Army. Her
naive husband Joseph (Paul Chubb) is a major in the Salvation Army, and
would prefer to be kept ignorant of her affair. Bernard is a generous
benefactor to the Army, which greatly pleases the major.</P>
<P>When an antique shop owner's husband dies she sells him an antique
Venetian cabinet, which turns out to be German. But Bernard finds inside
one of the secret drawers a golden braid and this sets his imagination
off; he tries to have conversations with the braid in order to find out
about the love life of the woman whose braid it is, believing that it's
still alive and can understand him. The poor soul has lost track of
reality and is absorbed in a world of fantasy, and is in danger of
losing the lover who is well suited for him. She tells him that she only
knows that she's alive when she's with someone who loves her, and
demands his full attention.</P>
<P>In this slow-paced character study of the obsessed man, which turns out
to be a film about the celebration of life, there are a few memorable
scenes: the gentle lovemaking between the two hurt souls; the brilliant
cello solo by Phillip Green called "Song of the Birds;" a confession
scene of Bernard with the priest, where the priest agrees with his
confessor that as long as you pay for your lust it is not a sin; the
unique house that Bernard lives in that's filled with clocks chiming,
art work, and antiques; and, Bernard's revealing conversation he has
with Terese, where she ridicules him for having slept with around 100
women in his lifetime and being a collector of women. She says one woman
is all he needs.</P>
<P>There's a quiet brilliance about this melancholy chamber piece, that is
much enhanced by the artistic cinematography of Nino Gaetano Martinetti.
It's a film for those who appreciate oddities in filmmaking and are not
deterred by the slightness of the story or the slow way it gets to where
it's going.</P>
