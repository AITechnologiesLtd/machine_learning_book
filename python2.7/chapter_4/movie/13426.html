<PRE>SMALL SOLDIERS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>If Toy Story told the story of what would happen if everyone's favorite
childhood toy came to life, then Small Soldiers tells the story of what
would happen if today's violent action figures sprung to life.  The
result is a violence-filled kids movie, which has its moments of creepy
fun.</P>
<P>The mayhem begins when a defense contractor, Globotech, buys up the
Heartland Toy company.  Toy designers Irwin Wayfair (David Cross) and
Larry Benson (Jay Mohr) use the latest military computer chips to design
the ultimate toys:  fully interactive action figures called the Commando
Elite, and their monstrous enemies, the Gorgonites.</P>
<P>However, Globotech never foresaw the consequences.  When the Commando
Elite leader Chip Hazard (voiced by Tommy Lee Jones) activates, he will
stop at nothing to destroy the Gorgonites and anyone allied with them.</P>
<P>That anyone happens to be young Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith) and his
neighbor Christy (Kirsten Dunst).  Alan's dad owns a small toy shop, and
Alan manages to talk his way into getting the first shipment of Commando
Elite and Gorgonite action figures.  However, soon he has an all out war
on his hands...a war which could turn deadly for his family and friends.</P>
<P>Director Joe Dante, who also directed Gremlins, has applied many of the
same touches to this movie.  The general theme (peaceful suburbia
destroyed by violent little creatures) is the same, and there are
several other little details which add to the same feel.</P>
<P>The animation is simultaneously well done and crude.  The integration of
the action figures into the real world is done superbly.  However, the
action figures themselves (made of rigid plastic) have very few
expressions.  As a result, the characters never truly come alive as in,
say, Toy Story.</P>
<P>The filmmakers did a good job in voice casting.  In addition to Tommy
Lee Jones, Frank Langella is cast as Archer, the lead Gorgonite.
Rounding out the Commando Elite are Ernest Borgnine, George Kennedy,
Bruce Dern, Jim Brown, and Clint Walker.  Spinal Tap's Christopher
Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer provide additional Gorgonite
voices.</P>
<P>The humans are mostly secondary characters.  Gregory Smith and Kirsten
Dunst are somewhat bland as the leads.  However, Kevin Dunn and Phil
Hartman add some levity as the kids' respective fathers.</P>
<P>But let's not kid around...the center of a film like small soldiers are
the toys and the havoc they wreak.  At times the film is a bit
subversive in its humor, and a little violent for the youngest set, but
mainly it is just plain fun.</P>
<P>The violence is mostly toy violence (hence no blood and guts).  However,
there are a few intense scenes here and there (but all tamer than
Gremlins).</P>
<P>Small Soldiers doesn't pack as much ammo as some of the bigger action
flicks this summer.  However, it has a bigger punch than a few I could
mention.</P>
