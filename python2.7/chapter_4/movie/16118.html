ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>James Woods, perhaps Hollywood's best relief pitcher, saves yet another
otherwise mediocre movie in ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE.  With his
mesmerizing blend of incendiary emotions and fascinating charisma, Woods
adds a dazzling spark of life to any project he undertakes.</P>
<P>Director Larry Clark, whose first movie was the highly controversial
KIDS, directs his second, ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE, as an updated and
less romanticized road picture a la BONNIE AND CLYDE.  With large doses
of realistic gore and with one heroin induced high after another, the
film likes to push the cinematic envelope as far as possible while
avoiding the dreaded NC-17 rating, which it probably deserves.</P>
<P>Vincent Kartheiser plays a drug addict and lowlife hood named Bobbie.
When we first meet Bobbie, he is high on speed.  In a rage, he is
cracking open vending machines with a big screwdriver, which, when he is
caught, he uses to impale the guard through the heart.</P>
<P>As Bobbie's girlfriend, Rosie, Natasha Gregson Wagner spends most of the
movie whining and cooing and asking him to get high with her and come to
bed.  Wagner, who has the most underwritten role, does little visible
acting.</P>
<P>After the vending machine debacle, "Uncle" Mel (James Woods) comes to
administer some heroin to Bobbie to help him with his sore ribs and
other ailments.  In return, he proposes that Bobbie join him in a life
of big-time crime.</P>
<P>Mel owns a big, shiny black Cadillac, the land yacht of choice from the
time when the story is set, the early 1970s.  A proud member of the
criminal fast lane, Mel thinks he is invincible and, hence, has much to
teach up-and-coming crooks like Bobbie.</P>
<P>Melanie Griffith plays Mel's girlfriend, Sid, whose heavy makeup and
expensive but tacky clothes still don't hide the thick aging lines in
her face.  Besides wanting to look a decade younger than her age, Sid
pines for a baby.  Mel, of course, being a serious, career professional,
pooh-poohs Sid's desire for family bliss.</P>
<P>Most of the movie has these two Bonnie and Clyde couples -- the veterans
and the apprentices -- engaging in a variety of crimes.  Almost like
commercial breaks, we cut to episodes of them shooting up heroin outside
of and during work hours.  If heroin were legal, these might be confused
with paid product placements.</P>
<P>The predictable script by Stephen Chin and Christopher B. Landon, based
on the book by Eddie Little, telegraphs most of its punches.  If a job
looks too easy, you can be sure it will go awry and in the obvious way.</P>
<P>The enjoyment of the picture comes back to James Woods's compelling
acting.  In one delicious scene, Mel sells drugs to two California
"surfer dudes," who try to bargain down the price.  Bad idea.  Drawing
two six-guns, Western-style from their hidden place between the sofa
cushions, he almost scares the kids to death.  Bullets would have been
superfluous.</P>
<P>ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE skirts various movie genres (including crime
drama, comedy, character study and drug abuse) without ever developing
any of them with enough depth to allow them to gel.  What we are left
with is another wonderful performance by James Woods and little more.</P>
<P>ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE runs 1:39.  It is rated R for pervasive heroin
and other drug abuse, strong violence, profanity, sex, and nudity and
would be questionable for anyone less than college age.</P>
