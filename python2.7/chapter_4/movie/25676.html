"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>In Cocktail, Tom Cruise's character became a bartender because he
dreamed of owning his own bar and becoming a millionaire.  In Coyote
Ugly, Piper Perabo slings drinks because she has in insatiable urge for
hard liquor and man-meat.</P>
<P>Well, that's not true at all.  If you've seen Ugly's trailer, you'd
think the film was about a bunch of slinky bartenders who can't get
enough men.  But Ugly is only rated PG-13, and its characters don't ooze
sex any more than a Britney Spears video.  The closest thing to nudity
in the film is Perabo's shadow in a dressing room.</P>
<P>Will guys be disappointed with Ugly after being assaulted with the
promise of sex and various state of feminine undress in the film's
marketing campaign?  It's a distinct possibility, since Ugly actually
plays like a chick-flick by portraying men as knuckle-dragging
Neanderthals and women as the cooler, calmer sex.  Where the hell is
Russ Meyer when you need him?</P>
<P>Perabo (The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle) plays Violet Sanford, the
daughter of a New Jersey tollbooth collector (John Goodman, What Planet
Are You From?).  Although she suffers from stage fright, Violet dreams
of becoming a successful songwriter - a career that her deceased mother
attempted and failed before Violet was born.  Her career ambitions take
her from a job in a suburban pizza parlor to a filthy, cramped Chinatown
apartment.</P>
<P>Violet quickly learns that the big city chews up and spits out girls
like her on a regular basis.  Everyone she meets seems to be a bitter,
failed musician.  Before you know it, she's chased off an open mike
stage by a pair of drunken hecklers and, of course, her grimy apartment
is burglarized.  Down on her luck and out of money, Violet ends up
taking a job from Lil (Maria Bello, Payback) who owns a popular bar in
Manhattan's meat-packing district.  The catch is that she has to wear
skimpy outfits, flirt with the customers and perform bar-top dances with
her sexy co-workers Zoe (supermodel Tyra Banks), Rachel (Bridget
Moynahan, Sex and the City) and Cammie (Izabella Miko, in her film
debut).</P>
<P>Predictably, Violet is horrible at her new job, but slowly becomes as
skilled and popular as her co-workers.  She even develops a relationship
with an Australian expatriate named Kevin (Adam Garcia, Wilde).  Their
romance is fairly interesting, despite being one of those typical
Hollywood affairs, with the girl initially hating the guy until he
finally wears her down with his relentless pursuit.</P>
<P>Perabo, who at times is a dead-ringer for Julia Roberts, can do the
sweet and innocent thing really well, but her character is oddly written
to be intermittently a naïve pussycat and a quick-talking hard ass.  It
left me scratching my head.  In most
inexperienced-person-goes-to-the-big-city films, the character stays
green until the final reel.  But not in Ugly.  The supporting roles are
all flimsily sketched, but Aussie actress Melanie Lynskey (But I'm A
Cheerleader) is a stand out based on her chunky Jersey accent alone.</P>
<P>Ugly is the directorial debut of David McNally, and its script was
written by Gina Wendkos, who is best known for a little-seen 1992 Jami
Gertz film called Jersey Girl (which was described as a Cinderella story
with big hair).  The picture was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (Gone in
60 Seconds, Armageddon), who usually makes huge summer blockbusters with
flimsy female characters.  Ugly isn't Bruckheimer's only venture away
from his typical testosterone-driven resume – the producer's football
flick Remember the Titans hits theatres next month.</P>
<P>Interestingly, Ugly uses the Gloria Gaynor song `I Will Survive' in one
of its major scenes, as does The Replacements, which opens one week
after Ugly premieres.  Also of note is a pet cat that mysteriously
appears in Violet's apartment.  Country crooner LeAnn Rimes appears in
the film's final scene, which makes no sense at all even after you find
out that Rimes provides the voice for all of Violet's singing scenes.
In short, Ugly is kind of like an all-night drinking binge – it's a fun
blur while it's happening, but you'll barely be able to remember it the
next day.</P>
<P>1:40 - PG-13 for adult language, mild violence and some light sexual
content</P>
