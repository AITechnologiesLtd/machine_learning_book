<PRE>                           FAITHLESS (TROLÖSA)
                    A film review by Rachel Gordon
                      Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com
                             filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Liv Ullman may get the directing credit, but every line in Faithless is
stamped Ingmar Bergman (who wrote the script).  Between the immoral
souls of the characters twitching with desires they can't control and
the extended two and a half hours to endure, who else could it be? 
(Bergman's original Fanny and Alexander was close to five hours long,
though the American version is two and a half).</P>
<P>Bergman showed a penchant for family drama with Fanny and Alexander and
Wild Strawberries, among others. He enjoys mixing the imaginary world of
his characters with their reality.  This can lead to a deeper emotional
entanglement with the characters; it's human nature to reflect and react
based on internalized stimuli.  Unfortunately for Faithless, Bergman is
revisiting territory he excelled in some 40 years ago, without shedding
any new light on his subjects.</P>
<P>This isn't the first film in which Bergman has written an old man
getting close to the end and brooding with a fantasy companion about his
wrongdoings.  It's basically Wild Strawberries, only this time the crime
is adultery instead of hubris.  The main character is even sitting at a
desk and writing constantly, again.</P>
<P>Bergman (the character, played by Erland Josephson) is an elderly
gentleman who beckons Marianne (Lena Endre) to discuss her adulterous
relationship with David.  Marianne, an actress, and Markus (Thomas
Hanzon), an orchestra prodigy, have been happily married.  They have a
young daughter, Isabelle (newcomer Michelle Gylemo), and David (Krister
Henrikkson) is their best friend.  David is a director and the
stereotypical brooding, unhappy artist.  One day David offhandedly
suggested sleeping with Marianne, and when she went to Paris on a
special project, he found reason to go as well, and their new
relationship began.</P>
<P>Bergman and Marianne journey through the entire story of the
relationship.  Often the camera cuts from the tense face of him to the
tear-strained eyes of her.  Every once in a while these moments are
punctuated with a flashback sequence.  In fact, the experience feels
more like a play than a film, as screen time is consumed with the two
sitting in a room and chatting away.  The circumstances that brought
Bergman to be the repentant weakling he is today and Marianne as his
mirage take a back seat.  Multiple takes of a man feeling horrible and a
woman crying do not a film make.</P>
<P>Not to say that Faithless is a complete waste of time.  When scenes that
reflect on Isabelle come along, her innocence and quiet intelligence are
well drawn.  Because she gets to underplay the situation she has no
control over, her plight becomes more important than that of her
parents.  This young amateur remarkably carries more presence in her
silence than Marianne does with her tears.</P>
<P>Another fascinating point in the film is how simple and suddenly
adultery can come to pass between two old friends.  No easy excuse is
made for it -- "trouble in the marriage" -- and the subsequent actions
of the characters involved are realistically complicated.  The film
sticks to its story without attempting to pander to a mainstream
audience.</P>
<P>For those who have never seen Bergman's work, this is not the place to
start.  A predecessor by some 40 years, Wild Strawberries is a more
interesting story (even if it was shot in black and white) because the
characters are more active, both in imagination and real time.  They
don't just sit around and brood all day but instead reflect based on
external cues in their environment.  That is what made Strawberries
emotionally engaging.  Perhaps if Faithless was told from beginning to
end instead of through glimpses into a past, driven by tears, it would
have hit half the nerves it was striving to.</P>
