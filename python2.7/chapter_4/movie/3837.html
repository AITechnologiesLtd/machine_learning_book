<P>     Because of the universally negative reaction to incest, it's a 
subject rarely tackled by motion pictures -- especially when that incest 
is lesbian in nature.  Therefore, in its depiction of the twisted 
relationship between co-dependent sisters, SISTER MY SISTER is unique.  
Like HEAVENLY CREATURES, this tale of frantic love and brutal murder is 
based on a true story.  While Nancy Meckler's film lacks the 
completeness of Peter Jackson's, the two movies together represent a 
fascinating study of parallels in obsession-based murder. </P>
<P>     SISTER MY SISTER opens with a brief prologue showing sisters 
Christine (Joely Richardson) and Lea (Jodhi May) as little girls.  It's 
clear that the younger Lea is Mother's favorite; the parental reaction 
to Christine borders on contempt.  The scene then shifts ahead some two 
decades, to a small provincial town in 1932 France.  Christine, working 
as a maid for Madame Danzard (Julie Walters) and her plain daughter 
Isabelle (Sophie Thursfield), has managed to persuade Lea to join her in 
service.  Reunited at last, and out from under their mother's control, 
the two sisters rejoice.  Meanwhile, Madame Danzard finds the 
arrangement quite suitable, since she gets two maids for the price of 
one. </P>
<P>     But Christine and Lea's relationship has already been poisoned by 
their mother's favoritism.  Lea, painfully shy and uncertain of herself, 
needs Christine's approval for everything.  The older sister, on the 
other hand, harbors a barely-concealed rage that occasionally finds form 
in tempestuous explosions.  She protects her sister with a fierce 
jealousy that goes beyond the rational.  As time passes, the sisters 
spend almost all their free hours cloistered in their upstairs room, 
hiding from a world that they no longer feel a part of.  In the process, 
their relationship crosses the line from platonic to sexual.   </P>
<P>     One of the most unusual elements of SISTER MY SISTER is that it's 
peppered with comic moments.  However, rather than lightening the mood, 
the humor deepens the story's uneasy tone.  Put simply, we get the 
feeling that we're laughing when we shouldn't be, and that sensation is 
exactly what the director is aiming for.  Intense performances by Joely 
Richardson (I'LL DO ANYTHING) and Jodhi May (THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS) 
possess an unsettling quality, and the entire movie leaves a lingering 
impression.  Character motivation is not as detailed as in HEAVENLY 
CREATURES, and certain elements of the protagonists' pasts remain 
ambiguous, but there's enough to lend resonance to the climax.  </P>
<P>     The greatest failing of this film is its flat presentation of 
Madame Danzard and her daughter.  Julie Walters gives a hilarious, over-
the-top performance as a prototypical high society snob, but there's 
nothing real about Madame Danzard -- she's a pure stereotype with barely 
a trace of any human sensibility.  This kind of simpleminded portrayal 
belongs in a different motion picture.  Meckler is somewhat ambivalent 
about Isabelle, occasionally lumping her with her mother in the 
caricature mold, but at other times allowing the audience to glimpse a 
more evenhanded personality.   </P>
<P>     SISTER MY SISTER is daring, and would have received more attention 
had the superior HEAVENLY CREATURES not reached the screen first (both 
movies went before cameras at about the same time).  The story raises a 
lot of questions about where the division lies between healthy and 
diseased love, and the sorts of tragic results that can come when humans 
are subjected to unreasonable repression.  Although those easily 
offended will find SISTER MY SISTER unbearable, even the most liberal 
viewer will leave the theater affected by the naked passions laid bare 
during the course of the film. </P>
