<PRE>                             ALONG CAME A SPIDER
                        A film review by Norm Schrager

<P>When you think "movie franchise," you think Harrison Ford or maybe Eddie
Murphy... but Morgan Freeman?  Yet, with the middling $60 million take
of 1997's Kiss the Girls, the low-key, dependable actor returns as Dr.
Alex Cross, in another try at a psycho thriller.  Sadly, Freeman's the
only point of interest in this one.  Kiss the Girls was average at best
-- Along Came A Spider should aspire to such heights.</P>
<P>Both films are based on James Patterson novels, where the good Doctor
(detective, psychologist, author, hostage negotiator, model boat
builder... good Lord) chases down some scary guy who's either a
kidnapper, a murderer, or both.  Here, our culprit is a teacher (Michael
Wincott) at a D.C. prep school for kids that require Secret Service
detail.  He conducts his entire teaching career incognito, and then
snatches the young daughter of a generic U.S. Congressman (Michael
Moriarty).</P>
<P>One of the more vital secrets in a psychological mystery like this
should be: Why is the madman doing this?  By keeping this fact at bay,
and perhaps even creating an inviting puzzle, a filmmaker can heighten
tension and develop characters.  First-time screenwriter Marc Moss and
director Lee Tamahori (Once Were Warriors) decide that isn't really
necessary.  So, the result is a bad guy causing evil evidently because
his parents weren't there for him.  Now that's creative!</P>
<P>Moss' dialogue is no help.  It's strictly cookie-cutter formula, made
all the sillier by Jerry Goldsmith's overblown theme music.  Both the
script and the orchestra are supposed to make us raise our eyebrows in
confusion or fright, but both are so self-consciously heavy, they do
nothing but cause heavy sighing and snickering.</P>
<P>The screenplay does take on some requisite twists to be oh-so-surprising
(taken from the novel, I imagine), but it's flat and derivative for most
of the movie.  Especially funny is an attempt at a cat-and-mouse
scenario, where our criminal is making poor old Dr. Cross run from point
to point in D.C., picking stray phones out of trash cans to get his next
instruction.  It's a carbon copy of a sequence in Ransom (among other
films), and it leads to a loot drop-off clearly stolen from Kurosawa's
High and Low.  And Moss' idea of a scene transition is Dylan Baker
closing every phone contact with the kidnapper by bellowing to police,
"OK, people, let's move it!"</P>
<P>Freeman does the best he can with this stuff.  He has an excellent knack
for hitting a line in a unique way, maybe emphasizing a word that others
wouldn't.  He tries to seem interested, and keep the mood grave, but
this one's just too silly.</P>
<P>Taking over the cutie-pie female role from Ashley Judd is Monica Potter
as a dejected Secret Service agent that feels responsible for the
kidnapping.  She has a beautiful face but minimum acting chops, and
between this and the horrific Head Over Heels, she's averaging about one
bad movie per month.</P>
<P>So what's next for Dr. Alex Cross if this one takes off?  Well, there
are five other books, but the latest, First To Die, will become an NBC
miniseries.  Sounds more appropriate.</P>
