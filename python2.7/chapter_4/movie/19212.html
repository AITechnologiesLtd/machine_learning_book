<P>"Passion can destroy a genius if it is not contained."  </P>
<P>There's probably a great film yet to be made about the life
and excesses of legendary, eccentric Australian pianist Percy
Grainger, who dominated the world stages long before David Helfgott.
Unfortunately Peter Duncan's ambitious but rather dull biopic is not
it.</P>
<P>Passion only begins to scratch the surface of Grainger's
genius, and assumes that audiences will have some prior knowledge of
his life and his accomplishments.  Passion will be, largely
unfavourably, compared with the recent Shine, as it lacks that film's
dramatic heights and accessibility.</P>
<P>Written by Don Watson and based on an earlier screenplay from
Roy George and Peter Goldsworthy, Passion concentrates on the few
years that Grainger spent in London immediately before the outbreak of
the Great War, at the expense of far more intimate and potentially
interesting biographical detail.</P>
<P>Passion primarily explores the complex relationship he shared
with his domineering mother Rose (beautifully played by Barbara
Hershey), and his relationship with the beautiful Danish musician
Karen (Emily Woof).  The film also explores the contempt he had for
the staid musical establishment of the time.</P>
<P>However, most of the controversy surrounds Duncan's delving
into his insatiable sex drive, which scandalised the rather
conservative circles in which he lived.  The most confronting element
of the film comes from Duncan's depiction of Grainger's kinky sexual
habits, in particular his predilection for flagellation and a bit of s
& m, which has earned the film an unjustified R rating from the
censors.  However, these brief sequences are tastefully handled by
Duncan, and presented without any hint of sensationalism or
exploitation.  (It would indeed be interesting to compare Duncan's
restraint with the verve and excess that Ken Russell would have
brought to his undoubtedly colourful treatment of this aspect of
Grainger's life.)</P>
<P>For all that though, Duncan's film ultimately lacks any real
passion or insights into the character, and falls short of other
brilliant biopics about other famous and deeply troubled musical
geniuses, like Amadeus, Scott Hicks' Shine, or even the recent Hilary
And Jackie.  Duncan, whose previous films include Children Of The
Revolution and the awful A Little Bit Of Soul, is a director with a
lot of ideas, but not necessarily the wherewithal to bring them to the
screen in a cogent and coherent fashion.</P>
<P>On the positive side, though, Passion is exquisitely filmed
and looks gorgeous.  Duncan has a meticulous eye for the period detail
of pre-war London, and some lavish cinematography from Martin McGrath
enriches the film's look.</P>
<P>The lead performances are also particularly strong.  Richard
Roxburgh, who apparently bears a resemblance to the younger Grainger,
brings energy and enthusiasm to his performance that brings the
character to life and allows his personality to almost leap of the
screen.  Hershey is terrific as the tragic, syphilitic Rose, and she
makes the most of this complex and fascinating character and her mood
swings.</P>
<P>For all its visual style and superb performances though,
Passion is a vaguely unsatisfying biopic about an eccentric genius.
There is, ironically, a sense of real passion missing!</P>
