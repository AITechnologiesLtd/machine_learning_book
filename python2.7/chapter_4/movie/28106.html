<P>And Now For Something Completely Mindless.  And, funny.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
It's old one-two con: Dear Old Mom Angela (Sigourney Weaver) left-hooks
some poor fool into marrying her, then daughter Page (Jennifer Love
Hewitt) sucker-punches the schmoe by seducing him into a compromising
position, so that The Jilted Bride can collect on blackmail...er, I
mean, alimony.  All in the family, I reckon.</P>
<P>After snagging philandering chop-shop owner Dean Cumanno (Ray Liotta)
this way, Page wants out of the mother-daughter con game to set up her
own separate scams.  Angela doesn't think Page can hack it, but
reluctantly agrees to break up, until an IRS Agent (Anne Bancroft)
bursts their bubble.  Needing some quick cash, Page agrees to one more,
big con, so the two set off for prime Rich White Guy hunting grounds:
Palm Springs.</P>
<P>There, they pick out tobacco billionaire William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman)
as their new mark; the constantly-hacking Tensy seems an easy enough
mark, though Page would rather go after younger game.  But complicating
things for them both are Tensy's stern, dedicated housekeeper (Nora
Dunn) and Jack (Jason Lee), a bartender (and more?) with the hots for
Page's alter con-ego.  Could True Love be in the cards for Page?</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Well, it's not completely mindless.  Nope, that's MONKEYBONE territory.
HEARTBREAKERS was more like DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS with tits.  Oh boy,
am I gonna hear it for that one.</P>
<P>Despite all the flailing about, the ObLoveStory between Page (Love
Hewitt; LH, from now on) and Jack (Jason Lee, who I can't stop seeing as
Azrael from DOGMA.  Trust me; that's not A Good Thing.) was the least
interesting thing about HEARTBREAKERS, though I was shocked when I
realized that I actually liked both characters and their actors - taken
separately.  No, what HEARTBREAKERS had going for it was more an
ensemble groove, with each character, and actor, adding their own zesty
spice to the mix.</P>
<P>Sigourney Weaver, in one of her best comedic performances since WORKING
GIRL, and Ray Liotta, in one of _his_ best performances, *period*, in a
lonnnnnng time, had great comedic timing together, as did - much to my
shock - Weaver and LH (who I wouldn't have bet could Hold Weaver's
Jockstrap; thanks, Jim Hill, for that image).   As it stood, LH was much
more convincing as the put-upon condaughter, than as the Love Interest;
I could live with that, though, because the con was The Thing.  And
though his was a one-trick pony, Gene Hackman's hacky cigarette baron
character, William B. Tensy, kept me grinning for most of the movie.  I
wasn't crazy about his payoff scene, but I've gotten a lot of mileage
out of that statue [go see the flick, to catch my meaning].  The cast
seemed to get much giggles playing off each other; that translated well
to the audience, as we giggled right back.</P>
<P>There's not much depth to HEARTBREAKERS - certainly, nothing Exciting!
And! New!, despite the lame "I'm like this because I have Male
Abandonment Issues" subplot - but sometimes, a good laugh is its own
reward.  And lord knows, after the dismal early 2001 movie season, we
need all the rewards we can get.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Um...how about the "Chick Factor" instead?</P>
<P>I admit I don't have much first-hand experience at being a horny guy who
has, apparently, never seen a push-up bra he didn't like, so somebody
help me out here: what is it about a curvy chick flashing her tits, that
makes guys stoopid?  I mean, didn't Julia Roberts already Go There with
"Airhead Broccoli" (or whateverthell it's called)?  Are fellas really so
desperate that all it takes is a little whiff of pus...er...femininity,
to make y'all give away the farm?  Well, somebody sure thinks y'all are,
given all the Curvy Busty Chick Snags An Idiot plots in comedies these
days.  But maybe I'm just playa-hatin' because I know I won't look half
as good as Ms. Weaver, when *I* turn 50.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line
No, it's not THE STING, nowhere near it.  But HEARTBREAKERS was a funny,
lighthearted comedy - and who doesn't like to laugh?</P>
<P>HEARTBREAKERS (rating: greenlight):
HEARTBREAKERS was a turn-your-brain-off-and-just-enjoy-it kinda flick.
Hey, everything can't be Deep, y'know?</P>
