<PRE>Review: The Astronaut's Wife (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>        Written and directed by Rand Ravich
        Starring Charlize Theron, Johnny Depp, Joe Morton,
        Nick Cassavetes, Donna Murphy, Clea DuVall</PRE>
<P>Here `Rosemary's Baby' meets `The Right Stuff,' or, more
accurately, the wrong stuff.  A near total lack of
characterization torpedoes this lackluster film, and Theron's
somnolent acting doesn't help.</P>
<P>It has been said that science fiction is about ideas, not
character.  Bad science fiction certainly is, and `The
Astronaut's Wife' qualifies as bad sci-fi.  While Theron's
character, Jillian, is front and center throughout the movie, I
left the theater without a clue as to who this woman is.  Or her
husband Spencer (Depp) either, for that matter.  Depp at least
has an excuse for looking blank and empty inside: he's been
reprogrammed by space aliens and is a pod person.  In
Theron's case, it's just bad acting.</P>
<P>Really bad acting.  She can't even manage a convincing
American accent.  In scene after scene, things happen to her--
mostly bad things--and she looks like she simply doesn't know
how she should be reacting, and would be incapable of
conveying the emotion even if she did know.  She's hopelessly
vague, except for a couple of scenes where she overacts.</P>
<P>Admittedly, the material is not very good.  But Theron does
absolutely nothing with it.  Jillian is pregnant; there's
something wrong with her husband, he's changed, and she
becomes gradually convinced that he's possessed.  There may
be something wrong with the twins inside her.  Nobody will
believe her of course: to complicate matters, she has a history
of mental illness.  At first she loves her husband (or so we're
told), then she suspects him, finally she's afraid of him;
throughout, she reacts with the same stony indifference.</P>
<P>Depp's character is a confused mess too.  Is he a good ol' 
boy who drinks Budweiser from the bottle or a corporate shark
who sips Scotch?  His hair style and accent give him an
uncanny resemblance to an Elvis impersonator, which doesn't
help his credibility as the film's heavy.  He does at least
manage to come across as creepy at times.  He keeps appearing
unexpectedly behind Jillian; it had me thinking maybe she
should hang a bell around his neck, like a miscreant cat.</P>
<P>Both Depp and Theron are way too pretty to be believable in
these roles.  He looks like he stepped off the cover of GQ, she
from Vogue.  One moment she's uneasy about uprooting from
their Florida home; in the very next scene she's mixing with
New York society, wearing expensive clothes well. Theron
should have stuck to modeling; she's always striking poses in
the film.  I half expected there to be a man just offscreen with a
Nikon calling out, `Pouty, pouty ... work it!'  Jillian and
Spencer's cavernous NY apartment is straight out of
Architectural Digest, too.  It just isn't a believable transition
from Cocoa Beach. Even NASA offices look fabulous in this
absurd film.  There are lots of extravagant camera angles and
unnecessary camera movement too, in order to jazz up the
visuals.  This movie is all surface.</P>
<P>There are some clever bits, including one where creepy
Spencer caresses Jillian and lets his fingers pause to feel the
pulse points in her neck and wrist.  This lets the audience know
there's something odd about this guy.  (It also had me
wondering why Jillian didn't notice.)  There's another clever
scene where Jillian turns Spencer's radio on and is so relived
that it's not tuned to interstation static (he receives messages
from his pals the aliens that way) that she starts doing a little
dance to the music.  It's the closest Jillian ever comes to being
charming and real in this movie, plus there's a nice shock
when the ever-lurking Spence pops up and scares the bejezus
out of her.  Never mind that we've already seen this gag done
on a 30-second hair color commercial....</P>
