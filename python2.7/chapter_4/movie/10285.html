<PRE>                            TOMORROW NEVER DIES
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Media mega-tycoon and megalomaniac
          Jonathan Pryce matches wits with the Pierce
          Brosnan's James Bond.  The film is long on action
          sequences and short on plot.  Brosnan's
          interpretation of Bond gets more and more like
          Roger Moore's.  There is less and less effective
          under all the polish and instead we have plot
          contrivances to make sure things work out for the
          best.  TOMORROW NEVER DIES ranks about 12th of the
          18 James Bond films from United Artists and (now)
          MGM.  Rating: 5 (0 to 10), high 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     If one looks at FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, there is a lot that
happening in the film.  The plot involves British intelligence, Russian
intelligence, Turkish intelligence, and SPECTRE.  Within SPECTRE there
are competing agents chess champion Kronstein vs. Rosa Klebb.  There is
a false seduction and other double crosses.  There are also fights and
chases, but they are each relatively short in duration.  When Bond
fights Grant it is a believable fight and Grant is dispatched in three
or four minutes.  Then the plot starts moving forward again.  The
result was that FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE was a James Bond thriller.  If
you have James Bond captured by the nasties and twenty minutes later he
is still escaping and the plot is still at a standstill, it does not
matter how many cars have been blown up, how many people have been
shot, or how many helicopters have crashed.  What you have may be a
James Bond action film, but it is not a thriller.  If Bond has to do
some clever deductive work to realize what the villain is up to, you
may have a thriller.  If Bond's success just happens because by
coincidence he is in the right place at the right time, you might have
an action film, but you do not have a thriller.  TOMORROW NEVER DIES
has an unfortunate shortage of plot complexity.  It is an action film
with James Bond, but it is not a James Bond thriller.</P>
<P>     After a shaky start in his first film, Pierce Brosnan is every bit
the James Bond that Roger Moore was, for whatever that is worth.
TOMORROW NEVER DIES reminds on of a Roger Moore Bond film.  After a
mostly irrelevant opening sequence we have a British battleship first
buzzed by Chinese MiGs, then chewed up by some sort of mechanical
device that combines aspects of a torpedo, a tunnel borer, and a
lamprey.  It goes to the bottom much like the Titanic, the film about
which was released in the same weekend.  (I wonder if the allusion
could have been intentional.)  The British and Chinese governments are
on the point of war and James Bond is sent off to figure out another
puzzle.  It seems that while sea-water was still leaking into the
battleship, news of the attack had already leaked out.  It was on the
news channel before anyone could have possibly known unless they knew
in advance the attack was to happen.  The news channel is ruled over by
magnate Elliot Carver (played by Jonathan Pryce).  Pryce seems to
comprise the worst aspects of Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch, Bill Gates,
and a lamprey.  Can it be that Carver is actually creating the news--
WAG THE DOG style--for his own ends?  Wait till you hear the reasons
why!  But Bond has to get his information pumping Paris Carver (Teri
Hatcher), former Bond lover and now Mrs. Elliot Carver.  The plot works
like a too-well-oiled machine taking us from one fifteen-minute action
sequence to one that is possibly twenty minutes without ever slowing
down for the audience to ask if it all makes sense, which it does not.</P>
<P>     Along for the ride this time are Judi Dench as M, trying to look
as much as possible like Bernard Lee with two X-chromosomes and
frighteningly succeeding.  Desmond Llewelyn is trying to give the
impression that a job in the Secret Service is for life.  He is
probably there mostly for continuity as is Joe Don Baker's superfluous
Jack Wade, formerly of GOLDENEYE.  Jonathan Pryce is a great actor who
makes a nearly colorless Bond villain.  Two characters are not
colorless and should have been used to considerably advantage.  One was
a Chinese agent played by Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh, a sort of
female Jackie Chan who could well have out-performed Brosnan in the
action scenes.  The other was a terrific small role for Vincent
Schiavelli as Dr. Kaufman, expert in torture and other infamous arts.
Schiavelli has one short delectable scene in a role that cried out to
be expanded.  Also there is a totally lackluster and boring acting job
by Bond's car.  The scenes in which the car appears look like second
rate automobile ads, which by an odd coincidence is exactly what they
are.  (I would not mention that here, but since the filmmakers accepted
all that nice money from the manufacturer to pose the car so much more
carefully than they pose any of the human characters, I feel obliged to
review the car's performance.)</P>
<P>     As a director Roger Spottiswoode is, well, spotty.  His UNDER FIRE
was a very solid political film.  His made for cable adaptation of AND
THE BAND PLAYED ON was a high-point of its year.  Let us not, however,
dwell on his STOP! OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT.  As a director of a Bond film
he was only middling successful.  He should have exerted more control
on the script, making it more intelligent and refusing the product
placements.  David Arnold has written an acceptably John Barry-sounding
score built around Barry's James Bond theme (credited falsely to Monty
Norman).</P>
<P>     TOMORROW NEVER DIES is below average for the Bond films to date.
They never even bother to tell the viewer what the title means.  I rate
the new Bond film a 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high 0 on the -4 to +4
scale</P>
<PRE>     Just so the reader can know what my values are in Bond films I
would rate the Bond film best to worse as:
  1.  FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE
  2.  ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE
  3.  THUNDERBALL
  4.  DR. NO
  5.  LICENSE TO KILL
  6.  GOLDFINGER
  7.  FOR YOUR EYES ONLY
  8.  YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE
  9.  THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS
  10.  THE SPY WHO LOVED ME
  11.  OCTOPUSSY
  12.  TOMORROW NEVER DIES
  13.  GOLDENEYE
  14.  DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER
  15.  THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN
  16.  A VIEW TO A KILL
  17.  MOONRAKER
  18.  LIVE AND LET DIE</PRE>
