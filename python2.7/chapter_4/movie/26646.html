"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Say what you will about Hollywood churning out films based on old
television series, but Charlie's Angels might be the best female-led
chop-socky action flick to be produced in this country.  Not only is it
funny, but Angels' action sequences are just as good as any blockbuster
released this past summer.  And the whole package is covered with a
thick layer of cheese, which is a good thing, considering that a film
like this should be taken as seriously as a sequel to Battlefield Earth.</P>
<P>For those of you not old enough to remember the television show (I'm one
of them), Angels was about three sexy secret agents who worked for the
Charles Townsend Detective Agency.  The Angels (and viewers) never saw
Charlie, but he assigned their cases via phone calls to an intermediary
named Bosley, portrayed here by Bill Murray (Hamlet).  Cases were neatly
wrapped up each week, and the pistol-wielding Angels were always sure to
find themselves in another precarious predicament in exactly seven days'
time.</P>
<P>Here, the pistol-less Angels are played by Cameron Diaz (Any Given
Sunday), Drew Barrymore (Never Been Kissed) and Lucy Liu (Shanghai
Noon), who play, respectively, the brain, the muscle and the daredevil
of the outfit.  They're a giggly group of girls (think Powerpuff) who,
for some reason, are forced to assume secret identities to blend into
society.  Angels' opening credits show clips of each of the character's
childhood before launching into a hysterical montage of all things ‘70s.</P>
<P>The film's first big action sequence takes place on an airplane, where a
character played by LL Cool J (In Too Deep) discovers that a fellow
passenger has a bomb on board.  He grabs the terrorist and leaps out of
the plane's emergency exit, plummeting toward the choppy water below. We
later learn that the Cool J character is really Dylan (Barrymore) in a
latex mask and a voice alteration chip (a la Mission: Impossible). For
some strange reason, the film doesn't address how the petite Barrymore
is able to pass for the built Cool J, as if there wasn't much difference
between their body types.</P>
<P>Angels' story isn't anything to write home about.  The nerdy creator of
cutting-edge voice-recognition software (Sam Rockwell, The Green Mile)
has been kidnapped, and his partner (Kelly Lynch, Mr. Magoo) seems to
think that a maniacal satellite tycoon (Tim Curry) may be involved.  The
Angels take the case with their usual gusto, but quickly find out that
the assignment may be a little trickier than they thought.</P>
<P>The Angels have several run-ins with a nameless character played by
Crispin Glover (Nurse Betty), who has no lines, wields a cane like a
Bond baddie and fights like Carrie-Anne Moss in The Matrix.  Their
battles include many gravity-defying kicks, which look surprisingly
believable from Liu and Diaz (but not Barrymore).  Strangely, Liu has
landed in two of the best American action films of 2000 (this and
Shanghai Noon), but Diaz really steals the show as the gangly Natalie.
Barrymore does double duty as star and producer.</P>
<P>Angels is the feature film debut for McG, who has directed a bunch of
popular music videos and award-winning commercials.  He paces the film
well and adds a good mix of period music and modern rock, as well as the
obligatory hipped-up version of the original theme song.  The best part
about the film is that it never takes itself too seriously (they mock
television-series-turned-feature-films in one scene) and, as a result,
it looks like everybody had a blast making the movie (the closing
credits include some funny outtakes).</P>
<P>1:34 - PG-13 for adult language and violence</P>
