"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Based on a Rainer Werner Fassbinder play, Water Drops on Burning Rocks
is the directorial debut of François Ozon, the reigning bad boy of
French cinema.  The film centers on the relationship between middle-aged
Léopold (Bernard Giraudeau) and twenty-something Franz (Malik Zidi).
Their affair begins torridly, but quickly turns dull and routine, with
Franz basically becoming Léopold's houseboy.</P>
<P>Just a Franz appears to be ready to check out of the relationship, the
situation gets complicated by the arrival of his curvy, sex-starved
ex-fiancée (Ludivine Sagnier), who arrives just before Léopold's
ex-lover – a man who became a woman to please her former boyfriend (Anna
Levine).  Hilarity, tragedy and a bizarre dance number ensue in this
well-executed film debut.</P>
<P>1:30 – R for nudity, sexual content, adult language and violence</P>
