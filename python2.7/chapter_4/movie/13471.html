<P>In response to the critical drubbing he received for "Armageddon," 
director Michael Bay pointed to the box office receipts and speculated 
that film critics may be out of touch with popular tastes. Hopefully, Bay 
will catch a screening of "The Mask of Zorro" and realize that it's still 
possible to make a rousing popcorn flick without treating your audience 
like wide-eyed rubes suffering from attention-deficit disorder.</P>
<P>Packed with action, intrigue, humor and romance, "The Mask of Zorro" has 
all the payoffs one expects from a contemporary big summer movie, with 
the style of a classic Errol Flynn swashbuckler. It's the kind of film 
that leaves you sighing at the end, not just out of satisfaction, but 
also in relief that they didn't screw it up. Put that in your rocket-
launcher and smoke it, Mr. Bay.</P>
<P>The prologue begins in 1821, when two young brothers help Zorro prevent 
the execution of a group of peasants. We learn that Zorro is the 
aristocratic Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins), mortal enemy of vile 
Spanish governor Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson). Just when the 
triumphant Don Diego is ready to retire and devote himself to his wife 
and young daughter, Montero invades his home and exacts a horrifying 
revenge.</P>
<P>Twenty years later, Montero returns with a new scheme for power. The 
aging Zorro recruits one of the brothers who helped him so long ago, 
outlaw Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas), and trains him to continue 
his legacy. Complicating things is the presence of the beautiful Elena 
(Catherine Zeta-Jones), Don Diego's daughter, who Montero kidnapped and 
raised as his own.</P>
<P>"The Mask of Zorro" works because it takes the time to actually set up 
the story, and the trouble to create three-dimensional characters whose 
fates matter to the viewer. Having a whale of a cast doesn't hurt, either.</P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as the graying hero. His Zorro is noble, 
witty and just a bit full of himself. He insists on perfection as he 
trains young Murrieta, and has the strength of character to make you 
understand why the bandit obeys.</P>
<P>As the new Zorro, Antonio Banderas shines in a role he was born to play. 
Rakishly handsome, Banderas convinces both as an outlaw and later, as a 
hero. His Murrieta has a rough-hewn sense of style and a chip on his 
shoulder that Don Diego is more than happy to knock off. The two men work 
well together, despite their clashing egos. </P>
<P>Catherine Zeta-Jones proves that she's more than just an incredibly 
beautiful face as the smoldering Elena. Clearly her father's daughter, 
her fiery eyes glisten with defiance and intelligence. Sparks quickly fly 
between her and the dashing Murrieta, adding sexual chemistry to the 
film's mixture of passion and derring-do.</P>
<P>Of course, characters as rich as these need a juicy villain and Stuart 
Wilson gives them one as Montero, investing him with enough humanity to 
make his wicked deeds all the more horrifying.</P>
<P>Director Martin Campbell does an exceptional job bringing the script to 
life, giving the production a rich, fluid feel as he dances between 
heroics, romance and humor. The stunts and sword fights have a snap to 
them and the audience truly becomes involved in the action, even at its 
most far-fetched, thanks in large part to the passion given the 
characters. As opposed to typical summer entertainment, "Zorro" has only 
one big explosion. That one explosion pays off beautifully, because the 
filmmakers understand that restraint always works better than overkill.</P>
<P>At 136 minutes, "The Mask of Zorro" is just a little too long. As good as 
the sword fights and narrow escapes are, a few less would have helped 
this larger-than-life adventure. But that's small criticism for the first 
summer popcorn movie of 1998 to fully deliver all it promised. </P>
