<PRE>                              LEAVING LAS VEGAS
                        A Dreary Honeymoon in Vegas
                       A film review by Chuck Stevens
                        Copyright 1995 Chuck Stevens</PRE>
<P>     This being 1995, misery and self-destruction are hardly unexplored
topics in the cinematic world; admittedly, the advent of what has come
to be considered Generation X cinema has lent angst a distinctly
shallow feel, but there is still room for legitimate exploration of the
themes it implies.  But it is not often that the despair depicted on
screen is quite as palpable, or as strangely compelling, as in Mike
Figgis' LEAVING LAS VEGAS, currently on limited release in theaters,
starring Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue.  It isn't that the events
portrayed are particularly novel movie fare, or even that the
characters are especially real: it's that the dreariness, for this is a
profoundly dreary movie, comes within the context of more dreariness,
surrounded by, well, you get the idea.  That the events and characters,
by turns tragic and pathetic, seem absolutely normal and unremarkable,
lends LEAVING LAS VEGAS, as a cinematic and cultural statement,
considerable power.</P>
<P>     The plot tells only half the story.  Cage (perfectly cast,
extraordinally comvincing) depicts Ben, an alcoholic Hollywood
screenwriter who, upon being fired, heads to Las Vegas to drink himself
to death; on his first night there, he picks up a prostitute named Sera
(Shue, also entirely believable) who finds him interesting and
eventually convinces him to move in with her.  Figgis (who also wrote
the screenplay) is not particularly interested in a
redemptive-love-story theme, though: Ben's self-destruction goes on
unabated and largely unremarked upon, and the relationship at the
center of the film is among its victims.  We see extensive segments
from a perspective that mirrors his: disjointed, marked by flashbacks,
blackouts, delusions, and a heightening sense of diminishing control.
Sera, for her part, struggles with an abusive pimp and more abusive
customers, and steadily wearies of saving Ben from himself; they
eventually separate, accelerating his breakdown, and their
reconciliation comes too late to rescue him.</P>
<P>     But LEAVING LAS VEGAS is not a love story, in any real sense,
nor is it about alcoholism.  The sex scenes--of which there is no short
supply--are largely mechanical, joyless, whether they involve Ben and
Sera or Sera and one (or more) of her clients.  Sex, here, is simply
sex for its own sake; emotional attachment is not a related concept.
The alcohol abuse is ongoing and marks every scene, including those
where Ben is seemingly stable and self-aware: while the viewer
recognizes alcohol's effects, there are no scenes of relative happiness
or coherence due to Ben's putting down the bottle for a bit, as might
be expected if the aim were solely to dramatize alcoholism.  Drinking
simply exists--again, for its own sake.  The mood of the soundtrack
alternates between bluesy and peculiarly jaunty, making it hard to take
the story entirely as tragedy; finding pathos in self-destruction is
hard when the story is set to bouncy, even raucous, music.  The opening
shot shows Ben walking down a grocery aisle tossing bourbon and whiskey
into a shopping cart--but the hard-edged jazz beat behind the scene
undercuts any sense of that sequence as ominous or disturbing.  He
lives to drink, and he drinks to die: sadness at the concept comes only
from a removed perspective.</P>
<P>     The failure of the relationship of the two characters further
undermines any sense of a renewing force, a redeeming feature.  When
Ben moves in, Sera buys him gifts, prominent among them, astoundingly,
a gold hip flask.  The camera lingers on the object for a while, as if
to say, yes, she really did it: clearly, this is not a scenario where
love struggles against the effects of drink.  Rather, love (or whatever
approximates it) serves to aid and abet the process of disintegration.
No sense of future intrudes on their life--and the grimness is
reinforced by a lighting scheme where shadows are heavy, pervasive.
Discussions of their relationship are invariably tied to sex: should
they have it, what does it mean, etc., and it is over sex--his bringing
home a prostitute, in a scene redolent with irony--that they go their
separate ways.  In all the time he lives with her, she makes no
apparent effort to halt his slide: she sympathizes, when drinking leads
to uncontrollable rage or shaking helplessness, but she does nothing.
To extrapolate this attitude into a larger cultural statement about
life choices, and our willingness to see and condemn self-destructive
behavior, may seem like something of a stretch, but the tone of this
film supports that notion.</P>
<P>     Essentially, the movie concerns itself with certain actions,
actions that come to mark and define two lives: sex and alcohol abuse.
We are immersed in--no, barraged by images of these behaviors, to the
point where they seem distinctly unremarkable: by the end of the movie,
the viewer is hard-pressed to be shocked by the meaninglessness of the
sex scenes or the deliberateness of the alcoholic self-immolation,
because, well, the viewer has already seen two hours of similar fare.
So, it seems, goes life in this particular culture (Las Vegas, high and
low society): nothing is wrong, as such, since everything has been and
will continue to be done.  The one truly vivid scene in the movie
comes, fittingly, outside the city: Ben and Sera have gone to a motel
for a few days, and after they make a scene (in a weird fusion of
drinking and sex) and manage to break a glass table, the hotel manager,
a steel-eyed woman in her 50's, advises Sera to leave and not to "cut
her little hands" on the glass, and tells them, in a tone balancing
irritation and contempt, to clear out in the morning.  That hotel
manager's line, "We get a lot of screw-ups here," gives the viewer a
sense--a fleeting sense--of external standards, of real people without
sympathy or understanding for what Las Vegas represents.  That moment
of perspective is brief, naturally: we promptly return to the city and
all it represents.  But that one moment--when the music stops and
sunlight replaces neon, faces are out of shadow--made me think that
Figgis has something to say with this movie, something not strictly
related either to sex or to alcohol.</P>
<P>     To make a movie about pain and anguish, a movie with
essentially two characters, grim without turning it into tragedy or
camp is not easy, and Figgis does well to avoid that end.  But it also
says something about his perspective that the love relationship seems
so shallow: her final tearful protestation that she "loved him" seems
meaningless, artificial, given what has come before.  The effectiveness
of the message underscores the strength of the performances by both
Cage and Shue; each depiction is intensely persuasive. (Cage's best
moments are in extremis: this is real drunkenness, alternating between
the obnoxious and the self-pitying.  And Shue's weary resignation as
she goes about her work gives us a sort of pained understanding of what
she goes through.) The brilliance of the acting saves the movie, which
might easily have become unwatchable (as it is, you may often need to
look away); while I cannot recommend LEAVING LAS VEGAS to anyone
looking to enjoy an evening, it is, in its own way, compelling.</P>
