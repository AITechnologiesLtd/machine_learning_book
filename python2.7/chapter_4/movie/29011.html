<P>The Princess Diaries (2001) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Anne
Hathaway, Julie Andrews Carolind Goodall, Hector Elizondo, Heather
Matarazzo, Robert Schwartzman and Sandra Oh. Screenplay by Gina Wendkos.
Based on the novel by Meg Cabot. Directed by Garry Marshall. Rated G.
Approx. 114 minutes.</P>
<P>The Princess Diaries is an appealing live-action fairy tale from Disney
that is simplistically charming.</P>
<P>This G-rated family feature is an undemanding as it is preposterous,
but somehow it actually works and holds your attention, even at an
overlong 114 minutes.</P>
<P>The movie is basically the ugly duckling story transported to
contemporary San Francisco.</P>
<P>Mia Thermopolis is a 15-year-old at a private high school where she
passes unnoticed. She even considers herself invisible. With the
exception of her best friend, Lilly, she is basically ignored by the
other students.</P>
<P>But all that changes when Mia's grandmother, whom she has never met,
comes to the city for a visit. It seems - surprise - grandma is Queen
Clarisse Renaldi of Genovia and Mia is a princess. Not only a princess,
but the heir apparent to the throne of the small European principality.</P>
<P>Mia's mother and father divorced when Mia was an infant. Pop went back
to the old country to take care of royal business, while Mom remained in
San Francisco to follow her career as an abstract artist.</P>
<P>The Princess Diaries is a movie aimed at young girls, most of whom can
probably identify with Mia's predicament. `I don't want to run my own
country, I just want to pass 10th grade,' Mia says.</P>
<P>Mia is intelligent, but painfully shy; she can't make it through debate
class without having to hurl. It also doesn't help that she's a bit
nerdy looking as well as awkward. But once her regal grandmother begins
giving her `princess lessons' - and she gets a complete makeover - she
emerges as a graceful, self-assured young woman.</P>
<P>Anne Hathaway's portrays Mia with the right combination of brains,
gawkiness, reluctance and finally, confidence.</P>
<P>It is a bit difficult to imagine the reaction of an anonymous teen-ager
being told just before her 16th birthday that she is heir to the throne.
Hathaway, Caroline Goodall as her mother and Julie Andrews as Queen
Clarisse nearly succeed in making this unlikely scenario believable.</P>
<P>Truly, though, this is one of the film's weak points. It is difficult
in today's split-second, Internet, super-electronic age to fathom such a
secret being buried for almost 16 years without a leak.</P>
<P>Andrews is dazzling and slyly humorous as the royal grandmother playing
Henry Higgins to her granddaughter's Eliza Dolittle. Those who remember
Andrews from her classical stage performance in My Fair Lady can
appreciate the irony of the situation.</P>
<P>Director Garry Marshall, he of Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride fame,
tries to keep the proceedings moving, but a little more judicious
editing could have been used. At nearly two hours, the film drags in
spots.</P>
<P>The Princess Diaries, based on a young adult novel by Meg Cabot, plays
out as you'd expect, with everyone living happily ever after.</P>
<P>And even though the bumps and detours on this road to happiness are
very predictable, The Princess Diaries is a movie parents and children
can enjoy together. It's not grand cinema, but it is an enjoyable
confection that will give some families an excuse to spend some time
together.</P>
