The Governess</PRE>
<P>Minnie Driver's new film: it's one of the "Governess in Remote Estate"
genre, something I understand better than the "American/Briton in
Italian Villa," but, really, that doesn't say much.  The latter is
entirely mysterious to me; the former is less so, only because of the
good old high school reading list, which included more Bronte sisters
than you can reasonably expect to see in later life.</P>
<P>This new film takes place in the 1820s or 1830s, and throws a few
twists into the usual story.  The first one, not truly remarked on for
most of the movie, is that Minnie Driver's character is Jewish.  To
kick off the film, we see an interesting depiction of Jewish life in
early 19th C. London: a marginalized culture, almost wholly insular,
with its own rituals and institutions.  Gentiles are the great unknown,
and the only interaction between the two groups early in the film is an
exchange of insults between Driver and a pair of street hookers.</P>
<P>Driver's father dies early on, leaving the family in debt.  Instead of
marrying a rich old fish monger, as her mom wants, Driver takes on a
Gentile name, Mary Blackchurch, and becomes a governess.  Her first job
is at the aforementioned remote estate, on a remote Scottish island,
the Isle of Skye.  Travel before the invention of railroads just sucks,
but there are very nice shots of the North Sea, almost flat as a mirror
at times.  In any case, the archetypal trappings of the remote estate
are there: a bratty charge, a distant wife, a dynamic if emotionally
closed master of the house.  Things develop as expected.</P>
<P>The second twist comes about in this part of the film.  The estate's
owner is an inventor, trying to come up with the right chemical
solution to "fix" photographs, so the images captured by camera won't
fade immediately after they're taken.  So, woven into the usual
governess story is a meditation on the capturing of indelible images
and memories.  This is a romanticized, compressed history of the
invention of camera film, but it provides the filmmakers with a nice
opportunity to show large, airy chambers filled with fluttering
photographic prints, art photos that you won't find in Daguerreotype
archives.  Presumably, there was some meditation on eyes, observation
and their relation to memory as well, but that was far too subtle for
me, so we'll skip it.</P>
<P>The relationship between the lord of the manor and the governess is
done fairly well, with the expected bright, sunlit moments amid sturm
und drang as the affair's barometer bobs up and down.  The lord's son
makes an appearance later in the film; he's read too much Byron,
apparently, something the flouncy shirt and haircut gives away.
Hijinks and revenge ensue, and the governess leaves for the calmer
environs of London by the end.</P>
<P>The epilogue is a curious one: she becomes a photographer in her own
right, specializing in capturing the heritage of her people.  This
ending feels a little tacked on, as her people aren't really remarked
on for most of the film, not in any meaningful way.  Yes, there's a
dramatic moment or two somewhere in there, and the Jewish-Gentile thing
highlights her isolation in Scotland, but it's not organic to the film:
she could have been a worshiper of Bob the Subgenius for all it
mattered.</P>
<P>As a side note, I saw the preview for this film a couple of days
later.  Golly: what a Harlequin Romance!  It's not that bad in real
life.  "The Governess" is supposed to be the director's first film, and
it's a fine first effort.  Some of the photography is gorgeous, though
the movie was a little longer than it could have been.  I didn't find
the story that intriguing, but that may be me.  Quite watchable.</P>
