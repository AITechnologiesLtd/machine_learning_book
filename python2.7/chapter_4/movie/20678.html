<PRE>MUMFORD
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        The town of Mumford is filled with so many cranks, oddballs, and
eccentrics that it requires the services of not one but three licensed
psychologists to keep all that angst in check.  Actually, "licensed" is a
bit of a stretch since the intriguing premise of Lawrence Kasdan's ("The
Big Chill," "Silverado," "Grand Canyon") latest film is that one of these
professionals is not exactly certified.  So much for the drama; that
"revelation" is out on the table simply from reading a twenty-five word
synopsis.</P>
<PRE>        So what else is left?  Unfortunately, not much.</PRE>
<P>        "Mumford" strives for that same multi-character ensemble chic so
glowingly realized by the likes of Robert Altman and Alan Rudolph.  The
feel of Kasdan's film, however, is more like an extended episode of
"Northern Exposure," where the good doctor gets to do his thing and say his
piece and everyone around him grows a little in the process.</P>
<P>        The characters who frequent the couch of Dr. Mumford (peculiarly
the psychologist bears the same name of the town, but nothing really comes
of that) are a wacky bunch it's true.  There's a sexually-frustrated
pharmacist (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who fantasizes in the style of those '50s
dime-store paperbacks with names like "Sucker Bait"--"all I needed was a
stiff drink, a cold shower, and a hot dame."  There's a skateboarding head
of a multi-national modem conglomerate, played by "Chasing Amy"'s Jason
Lee.  And there's a shy, delicate woman who's probably suffering from
chronic fatigue syndrome (Hope Davis).</P>
<P>        These are among the better-developed characters.  Ted Danson, Mary
McDonnell, and Alfre Woodard try to get inside their less-well developed
roles and have a tougher time of it.</P>
<P>        For a movie with so many recognizable stars, Loren Dean is an odd
casting choice as Mumford.  Dean's filmography is interesting--"Billy
Bathgate," "Gattaca," and "Enemy of the State" to name a few--but he
certainly isn't a household name.  In "Mumford," Dean doesn't so much act
as re-act; his dialogue is peppered with a great many hmms and uh-huhs as
he takes stock of his clients' odd little quirks and preoccupations.
Perhaps being a good listener is key to being a good psychologist, but it's
a risky personality trait with which to saddle your leading man.</P>
<P>        After some impressive opening achievements (director of "Body
Heat," screenwriter of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and a couple of early
"Star Wars" sequels), Kasdan's work has slumped into mediocrity and below.
His recent turns at bat have been potentially interesting yet ultimately
futile affairs--"French Kiss," "Wyatt Earp," and "I Love You to Death"
spring to mind.</P>
<P>        "Mumford," alas, is no exception, a film bogged down by
fair-to-middling writing, uninspired direction, and a central conceit that
never really takes off.</P>
