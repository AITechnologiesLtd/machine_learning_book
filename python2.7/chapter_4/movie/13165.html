<PRE>                                   MULAN</PRE>
<P>With the exception of the unforgettable FANTASIA, there has been nothing in
the field of animation to compare with Disney's MULAN.   The graphics were
absolutely captivating.   The battle scenes, the spears and arrows in the
air, the city below, the snow,   the crowd of 2,000 Huns on horseback,
7.000 lanterns, a crowd of 30,000. . .  everything with perfection.</P>
<P>Then there is the wonderful story, in fact a great poem, (which originated
during the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534 AD) that the Chinese have been
relating to their children for some 2000 years so that everyone in China is
as familiar with the story as we here are with Pocohantas.   The original
great poem begins with the sound of a loom, "Zhi-zhi, zhi-zhi."  The poem's
story over the many years of telling have resulted in many versions.    It
should be noted that unlike the MULAN film being reviewed here, the only
love interest in all the stories was one of the paternal-filial
kind.   Hollywood added Captain Shang (voice of B.  D.  Wong).</P>
<P>The current film is based on the story version by the famous
children's books writer, Robert D San Souci.   China has been
invaded by the Hun, Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer).  The Emperor (Pat
Morita) decrees that every household must send one male to help
fight the invader.  Mulan (Ming-Na Wen), a feisty, brainy young lady
who, according to custom should be getting married, is very upset
because her aged father, Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) the only male, is
thinking of joining the army and will surely be killed.  She throws
all caution aside, dresses like a male and secretly sets off to join
the army where she does heroic duty and helps save the day.</P>
<P>In the film, Mulan is slightly wounded, which is when it is revealed
to Captain Shang by the attending  physician that Mulan is woman.
In the original poem, the revelation comes when she returns home
from the war with a medal given her by the Emperor and the treasured
sword.    Adding the captain as the love interest does not hurt
anything.</P>
<P>There is the delightful character,  the dragon, Mushu, (Eddie
Murphy) who was originally an ornament on an incense burner who
comes alive to help Mulan.   There's the matchmaker (Miriam
Margolyes), there's Mulan's gruff but good-hearted comrade in arms,
Yao (Harvey Fierstein), Shang's singing voice (Donny Osmond), and
more.</P>
<P>One more word about the original poem which ended with a sentence
that became famous in China:   If two rabbits run side by side, how
can you tell which is the male and which the female?</P>
<P>Songs and music by Matthew Wilder, lyrics by David Zippel, and an
original score by Jerry Goldsmith.</P>
<P>Everyone connected with the film should be very proud.  It is
magnificent.</P>
