<PRE>                                 TWISTER
                       A film review by Scott Marcus
                        Copyright 1996 Scott Marcus</PRE>
<PRE>Cast: Bill Paxton, Helen Hunt, Cary Elwes, Jamie Gertz

Grade: B</PRE>
<P>Review for the MTV-generation: Great effects, adequate story, and some
good performances make TWISTER an enjoyable ride. Caveat: Make sure to
see it on the big screen, because much of the power of the film will
undoubtedly be lost when it comes to video.</P>
<P>Two groups of tornado-chasers (it's hard to believe that anyone would
be crazy enough to go looking for tornadoes, let alone *two* groups of people)
are racing to try to deploy a bunch of sensors into the heart of a tornado.
The purpose is to learn enough about these storms to predict their paths.
If this can be done, people in danger will be able to get fifteen minutes
warning before one strikes.</P>
<P>TWISTER is just about what you'd expect, and what the ads promise. The
tornado effects are awesome. The F/X people on this film did everything they
could to bring the awesome destructive power of tornadoes to the audience,
short of actually creating one in the theater. Whenever a twister is on
screen, I was completely captivated; completely caught up with the characters
who were placing themselves in the path of these beasts of nature.</P>
<P>The question remains, though, what about when the effects stop, and the plot
and characters and screenplay take center stage? After all, two hours of
tornadoes might be enough to sell videos for the weather channel, but it's
no way to make a film.</P>
<P>The answer is, more or less, that the rest of the film is worthwhile. Two
of the three leads are excellent -- Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt. Both are in
top form, Paxton as the tornado-chaser turned reluctant weatherman, and
Hunt as the tornado-obsessed scientist. The rest of the rag-tag band of
chasers is also good, with several familiar faces from TV. They are more
reminiscent of a college fraternity than of a group of scientists, which
helps lighten the mood effectively.</P>
<P>The other lead, Jamie Gertz, as Paxton's current fiancee, is drawn a little
lightly. I'm not sure if the problem is the actress or the part, but
whichever, the character has too little substance. And the other somewhat
sour note is the rivalry between Hunt's amateurish group, and a
well-financed group of storm chasers led by Cary Elwes. Elwes is a former
associate of the college group, but has gone pro, as it were, by getting a
lot of money through corporate sponsorship. The film would have been tighter 
without this unnecessary plot device.</P>
<P>Overall, though, the effects are what will bring people to the theater, and
the effects are what will be remembered as they leave.</P>
