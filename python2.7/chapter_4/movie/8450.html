<PRE>                         THE LIFE OF BRIAN 1979
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Micahel Palin, Terry Gilliam, Eric
Idle, Terry Jones. Director: Terry Jones Written: By the cast.</P>
<P>At first there was 'The Life of Christ'. Who can forget 'The Sermon on
the Mount', 'The Feeding of the Five Thousand', and 'The Last Temptation
of Christ'. Ooops, did I say that? Must have misplaced a page out of
Scorsese's books. Then there is the 'Life of Brian'. Who can forget the
'Gourd of Life', the 'Missing Slipper' and the 'Miracle of the Berry
Tree.'</P>
<P>"Brian child prodigy, the creation of mistaken identity, who had the
misfortune of being born on Christmas day, to forever be compared to the
greater man. His gifts of Myrrh, Gold and Frankincense snatched away at
birth by three wise men. Not as stupid as haggard looked. His mother in
great need of shave, with voice so deep a frog prince one could almost
mistake her be. Grew up in town of Bethlehem, nay carpenter or humble
slave, but rising member of 'Judean People's Front'. To see the Pharisee
of Cleese organise let's stone 'Jehovah' speech, to watch women with
camel beards, pick up rocks in furious vent their anger be on that
stupid Pharisee. Next of note, on Graffiti paint. The walls of
Jerusalem, not 'All Hail Mary' or 'Hail King David', but one hundred
times from dusk till dawn, poor Brian slaves with picture words to pen
'Hail Caesar' not in one, but three Hebraic, Greek and Aramaic. Thus his
life goes on to forever be, remembered as Christ's prodigy. Where 'Bigus
Dickus' brings laughs bigger than 'Fall of Rome'; to mercies feet,
Brian's fate rests on Pontius Pilate's mouthy lisps with 'evewy Wobert,
Wichard and Bwian'. To end up crossed not with nail to hand, but rope to
arm and platformed feet. To die for cause J.P.F., P.L.O., and I.R.A. His
dying words nay 'Father forgive them for they know not what they do.',
but hey 'Always look on the bright side of life.'"
     From 'The Chronicles of Monty Python Snippets' by TMT Voon.</P>
<P>Technically speaking how can one criticise 'Monty Python' when in truth
they are a mockery of themselves. One cannot take the talents of Cleese,
Idle, Palin and the others and expect Shakespeare, Keats, or Wordsworth.
Confusing in many parts i.e. the kidnapping of Brian by a space craft, the
use of the same actors to play multiple characters. This irreverent
comedy pastes together not a script or a plot, but various stand up
situations of issues relating to the Christian faith. Most notably
'Blind Faith', and the unquestioned acceptance of miracles. However, the
definition of faith is one which does not have it's roots imbedded in
explanation or logic, so in truth faith is blind. As with every Monty
Python movie, the sets, the costumes, the entire film is always
secondary to the jokes and the actors. So what we have is a lot of
adolescent school boys having plenty of fun playing with themselves in
Jerusalem.</P>
