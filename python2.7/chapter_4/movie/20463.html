<PRE>Teaching Mrs. Tingle (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Starring: Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes,  Melissa Coughlan, Barry Watson, Vivica
A. Fox, Molly Ringwald.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13 for thematic content, language, violence, and sexuality.</P>
<P>By first glance 'Teaching Mrs. Tingle' looks like a teen comedy with lots of
laughs. Well it is a teen movie, but the laughs are there, but not as much as I
had hoped. I did however like the plot, and the performance by Helen Mirren,
which saves the movie from being a washout. She is a very good actress, and it
shows in this smart, clever, and sometimes funny comedy/thriller. Katie Holmes
delievers another good performance, besides the mediocre performance by Barry
Watson, the film seems to have all it takes to be a successful film, now we
just have to get past the box-office performance of this movie for being so
long-delayed.</P>
<P>Kevin Williamson, the 'mastermind' behind films such as 'Scream and Scream 2'
'I Know What You Did Last Summer', 'Halloween: H20', and 'The Faculty' wrote
and directed this movie. He as most of you know also writes and executive
produces the popular TV show 'Dawson's Creek.' He did do a good job with
writing and directing this movie. The script is very clever with some good
lines and gags. The directing which he did himself was good too, except for
some derivative camerwork. </P>
<P>Katie Holmes plays a not-so-rich girl names Leigh Ann. Her friend Jo Lynn
(Marissa Coughlan) (Notice the two names?). After Mrs. Tingle (Helen Mirren)
gave a not-so-good grade to Leigh Ann for her history work, she has to do extra
credit to make up. A guy named Luke (Barry Watson), who stole a copy of Mrs.
Tingle's final exam test, gives it to Leigh Ann, and sticks it in her bag.
After Mrs. Tingle finds out, she goes right to to the principle's office. He's
not there so she goes home.</P>
<P>The kids go to her house and try to explain what happened. After some words are
spewed, Mrs. Tingle is grazed by an arrow, and knocked out cold. The kids tie
her up, and try many things to keep her quiet, blackmail, torture, and making
her feel bad. But Mrs. Tingle is the teacher from hell. She has no feelings, no
heart, no nothing. Some surprising revelations are found towards the end, which
makes Mrs. Tingle a whole new person. </P>
<P>I must say, this movie IS NOT the best ever made. Nor is it ever close to being
great. But the movie itself was entertaining, and I did enjoy it. I thought
some of it was ludicrous (AKA Jo Lynn's re-enactment of 'The Exorcist'). But it
was non-the-less enjoyable. The acting was good too. I was kept on the edge of
my seat by the end, and was glad I got to see this movie. "Teaching Mrs.
Tingle" is no classic, but it is a worthy peice of work by Kevin Williamson.</P>
