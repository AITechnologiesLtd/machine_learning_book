<P>Ali (Per Graffman), a cabdriver living in Sweden, thought he had left his
guerrilla past behind him 18 years ago, but it catches up with him in the
opening scenes of "Before the Storm". Addressing him as "Captain," a woman
fare (Nasrin Pakkho) knows not only who he is, but what he is capable of
doing. Unless he agrees to assassinate the Swedish manufacturer who has
been selling trucks that are converted into rocket launchers against their
people, her compatriots (and his formerly) will kill the wife and son that
he left behind. Although the film does not identify their nationality, it
is implicit that they are Kurds since they are being persecuted for their
language.</P>
<P>Ali has a new family in Sweden. Now married to a Swedish woman, they have
two teenaged daughters. The younger has a classmate named Leo (Emil
Odepark) who has a crush on her, but whose affections are not returned.
Poor Leo is spurned not only by her, but the rest of his classmates who
enjoy tormenting him as a "monkeyface". But none are as cruel as Danne
(Martin Wallström), an older boy who makes Leo's life a living hell. At
knifepoint, he forces Leo to march naked into the girl's locker-room to don
the panties of Ali's daughter, the girl he loves.</P>
<P>As with students in the American news, Leo decides to take matters into his
own hands. He steals his mother's 9 millimeter pistol (she is a police
officer) and lures Danne into a wooded area where he forces him to get down
on his knees and apologize. In the ensuing altercation, Leo shoots Danne in
the chest.</P>
<P>The remainder of the film focuses on the crossed paths of Ali and Leo. One
is fleeing from the law, particularly from his mother who has discovered a
missing bullet in her pistol's chamber. The other is fleeing from his duty
as assassin, coerced as it is. In a riveting scene, the two sit in Ali's
kitchen in the middle of the night. Just moments after warning Leo that he
must turn himself in (he can not run forever), Ali receives a phone call
from his blackmailers. They put his first wife on the line to plead for her
life. Overhearing this chilling conversation, Leo discovers that Ali is
also in the hands of fate. Both of these characters, longing for normalcy
and love, are wrenched into another, more frightful reality by
circumstances beyond their control. In one case, war in the Mideast. In the
other, a sadistic high school bully.</P>
<P>By making his two lead characters murderers, young first-time director Reza
Persa (born in Iran but living in Sweden since 1980) is confronted with the
challenge of making us empathize with decent characters doing indecent
things. As he told the audience after the showing, there is no greater
challenge facing an artist. Although some Arabs have criticized him for
stereotyping them as terrorists, he explained that most Swedes appreciate
the film for showing the powerful forces that can make people take
desperate actions. In addition, the film effectively confronts stereotypes
about the Swedes, although of the opposite sort. When the film debuted,
critics found it hard to believe that a Swedish schoolchild would kill a
bully in this fashion, but only three months ago such an event took place
for the first time in this bland, social-democratic country. Showing far
greater gullibility, some critics also questioned whether Swedish
manufacturers could be war profiteers. Evidently they never heard of Alfred
Nobel, who funded his annual prizes with money he made from the sale of
dynamite, a product he invented.</P>
