<P>Some movies are meant for entertainment purposes only.  These are the
films which you almost want to laugh at because the writing is bad, or
the acting sucks.  I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is one of these
films.  The acting is quite good for a film of this genre, but the
writing is very mediocre, bordering on hideous.  Based on Lois
Duncan's revered novel, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER's story is
changed dramatically on the transition from novel to screen.  Instead
of being a psychologically probing teenage story, LAST SUMMER ends up
as a horror film, with some psychological moments in the first hour.
In fact, the first hour is very well done, with characters you get to
know and like, and some you don't like, and that is when screenwriter
Kevin Williamson shifts the mood to horror.</P>
<P>I have no objections to the alteration, but I will say that much of
his writing is rather cheesy at times.  This is quite unusual coming
from the writer of the highest-grossing horror film SCREAM.  What made
that film such a success though, was the smart, ironic take on the
teen slasher genre.  LAST SUMMER doesn't exactly make fun of motion
pictures as SCREAM did (I think the closest example was when a
character commented, "Jodie Foster did this in a movie..."), and
sometimes it uses the cliches talked about in Williamson's previous
film.  But what makes LAST SUMMER work isn't exactly the writing.  The
plot is the high point of the script, with the dialogue being the
lowest, but the cast makes up for a lot of the plot holes left (and
there are quite a few).  However, actors can never cover up every
single plot hole, no matter how good they are.  Thankfully, the
direction by Jim Gillespie is usually well done, creating a lot of
suspense and terror.</P>
<P>I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER begins with a very impressive shot
which zooms in onto a lone character, sitting on the edge of a cliff.
His solitude creates tension on the screen from the start, as we begin
to dread the fate of this character.  However, it doesn't turn out as
you might think, as fireworks break the silence.  The annual Croaker
Festival is occuring, and the highlight of the evening is the Croaker
Queen Pageant, as a few high school students perform and answer
questions in their swimming suits (a crack at the Miss America
Pageant?).  One of these students is Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle
Gellar), whose answer to her question is a very funny spoof of beauty
pageants.  Helen wins, obviously, and becomes the year's Croaker Queen
(a very nice foreshadowing effect, I might add).  Her three friends
best friends, Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Barry Cox (Ryan
Phillippe), and Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.), all sit in the
balcony and cheer.</P>
<P>After the crowning and party, the four jump in a car and race to the
beach to tell stories about killers with hooks (the foreshadowing is
almost overwhelming).  They all have sex, and then drive home.
Turning a curve, Ray is distracted by Barry and doesn't see the
shadowy figure whom they mow down with the car.  After dumping the
nearly dead body into the ocean, the four have to struggle with their
consciences, changing their lives forever.  Julie takes it the
hardest, and she becomes the central character of the film.  A year
passes, and Julie is nearly flunking out of college.  Her roommate
suggests that she go home to take a break from college and "get a
tan."  At home, she receives a mysterious letter, with "I Know What
You Did Last Summer" printed on it.  She contacts all of her friends
again, and they begin a search of who could know.  The most obvious
would be Max (Johnny Galecki) who drove by the scene of the accident.</P>
<P>Very quickly, bodies start piling up, and Julie and her friends begin
a race of survival and mystery.  Who is the killer?  Could it be the
dead victim himself?  All these questions are answered, rather
insufficiently because we, the audience, are never given a chance to
figure out for ourselves who is doing it (something SCREAM did very
well).  However, the mystery is not really an essential part of the
film.  The purpose of LAST SUMMER is to gross audiences out and scare
us while doing it.  The film succeeds at this basic premise quite
well, and so I am giving the movie a recommendation.  I will admit
that what LAST SUMMER did to make me like it was put good characters
into the situations.  Many critics claim that the characters are
unoriginal and uninspired, but I assume that that is exactly what
Williamson's intentions were.  Unfortunately, there is really only one
interesting male figure in the film, Max, the friendly fisherman, but
he is left in the shadow of the four stars.</P>
<P>Kevin Williamson's screenplay manages many scary moments, along with a
truly suspenseful highlight, which lasts around ten minutes.  After
watching LAST SUMMER, I realized that true suspense isn't watching
someone being chased around by a mysterious killer (although that
extended sequence is the highlight aforementioned).  True suspense is
expecting something to happen and then waiting for it to occur.  You
know someone is going to jump out of the shadows, but who will it be,
and when will it happen?  Sometimes, it doesn't occur at all, and the
suspense lingers as we continue to expect it.  Director Jim Gillespie
is no Wes Craven, but he does manage to create some genuine suspense,
along with several of those "jump" moments that we all know and love.
Unfortunately, many scenes create unintentional humor because the
writing requires one thing, while Gillespie does another.  Williamson
does write a very intelligent first half, which deals with the guilty
consciences of the friends.  This setup gives the audience an
emotional connection with the characters, making us care for them as
they are stalked.</P>
<P>The cast is one of the best parts of the film.  Jennifer Love Hewitt
is obviously the main character here, although one might think
director Gillespie was trying to give Sarah Michelle Gellar the
starring credit.  Hewitt's presence is very reminiscient of Neve
Campbell's role in SCREAM, but Hewitt's reaction to every situation
seems appropriate and accurate.  I liked her character, and Hewitt
added a lot to it.  Gellar nearly steals the film with a cheesy spoof
of beauty queens, obsessed with their hair.  Gellar, from TV's "Buffy,
the Vampire Slayer," seems like a perfect choice for this role, and
she adds more depth to the shallow character than required.  I'm not
sure if we were supposed to care for the character, but with Gellar in
the role, I dreaded the entire chase sequence involving her and the
killer.  Freddie Prinze Jr. gives no depth to his character, and his
performance is probably the worst in the film.  Ryan Phillippe is good
as his cliched character, but we never are very clear on what his
intentions are.  Anne Heche gives a very good performance, although
listening to her talk, I began to realize that none of the other
characters had Southern accents.  Heche is given a small shred of a
role, but she does a lot with it.  Johnny Galecki portrays the only
male figure that I liked in the movie.  Galecki has a very unclear
role, and this uncertainty gives us yet another character to add to
the list of possible killers.</P>
<P>I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is rated R for strong, graphic horror
violence, terror, and language.  Because the film is based on a novel,
I forgave the killer's choice of weapon.  I kept expecting one of the
characters to remark on how similar this is to CANDYMAN, the
frightening 1992 horror film.  Normally I don't like humor in a
slasher film like this (I didn't really appreciate the over-the-top
performance in SCREAM), but this film certainly could have used some.
LAST SUMMER isn't scary enough to make you scream, and as a result,
should have added humor to make it more entertaining.  For what it is
though, this film certainly is fun to watch.</P>
