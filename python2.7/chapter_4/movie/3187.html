<PRE>                                  READY TO WEAR
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1995 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Directed by Robert Altman
Starring: Anouk Aimee, Marcello Mastroianni, Sophia Loren,
          Kim Bassinger, Stephen Rea, Tim Robbins, Julia Roberts,
          Lauren Bacall, Sally Kellerman, Danny Aiello</P>
<P>     Altman has developed a unique style.  His classic films all have
large ensemble casts juggling several intertwining storylines at once,
often talking at the same time.  After taking on the world of politics
in NASHVILLE and the disintegrating California social structure in
SHORT CUTS, lampooning the vapid world of Paris fashion just doesn't
seem to be a worthy enough subject.  Fluff, dissected and scrutinized,
is fluff.  There is very little more to know about it than can be seen
at first glance.</P>
<P>     READY TO WEAR, or PRET A PORTER as the film's title sequence still
says, only has a chance of being moderately satisfying compared to
Altman's classic essays on society.  It does succeed for the most part,
landing at least in the upper half of Altman's work, but least
satisfying of his efforts since his "comeback" with VINCENT AND THEO,
but better than his last Paris lensed outing, BEYOND THERAPY.</P>
<P>     His stories this time are much more loosely connected than last.
In SHORT CUTS a thread of cause and effect could be traced from one
character to the others, Lily Tomlin's accident to the parents to the
cake maker and so forth.  In READY TO WEAR, one simply has to be in
Paris on the days covered to be included in the story.  Several of them
could be removed completely with no effect on the storyline.  Where
characters in SHORT CUTS often delved into their deepest emotions,
READY TO WEAR is all cheap shots, one line barbs.  Nothing in the film
is deep or heartfelt.  Simply as a comedy, it is difficult to tell what
the jokes about the fashion world even are, since the world is so close
to self-parody anyway.  An unpleasant vein of scatological humor runs
through the film as well.</P>
<P>     After a so-so first hour, filled with protracted set-ups and
introductions, the film gets somewhat better.  After what seems to be
an endless bit of airport arrivals and hotel check-ins, several plots
emerge, mostly concerning petty backfighting between different
designers, models, photographers and magazine editors.  Once the
characters and their own personal vacuous goals are established, the
stories get going quickly as a maze of rehearsals and shows that one
either must be seen or not be seen at.  Doing the seeing for us is Kim
Bassinger as Kitty Potter, an MTV-type fashion reporter who seems to be
everywhere trying to get a straight answer from anybody as she reads
her questions from cue cards.</P>
<P>       The ensemble cast for the film is huge.  Many real Paris fashion
icons play themselves, and lent their creations to be used in the
film.  The cast is a who's and who's not list of international talent.
Stephen Rea gives his best performance to date as a jaded photographer
in a stand out role.  European art film stalwarts Marcello Mastroianni,
Sophia Loren, Anouk Aimee and Jean-Pierre Cassel bring warmth to their
story, and it is a large portion of the film.  Lauren Bacall, Lyle
Lovett,  Tim Robbins, Julia Roberts, Teri Garr and Danny Aiello are
among several stars really wasted in side stories that never get to be
quite amusing enough.</P>
<P>       By the end, more of the stories hit than miss.  It becomes
amusing to see what new depths of shallowness some of the characters
will sink to in their petty back stage games.  Even the message scene
at the end is amusing for its shallowness at making a deep statement
about fashion.</P>
<P>     Compared to most of the films that came out of Hollywood this
year, READY TO WEAR is better than most, but once it is over it is as
forgettable as last year's platform shoes.  Ultimately it is as shallow
as the world it is commenting on.</P>
