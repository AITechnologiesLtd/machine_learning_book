<PRE>                        POLICE STORY III: SUPERCOP
                       A film review by Eric Brochu
                        Copyright 1996 Eric Brochu</PRE>
<P>Starring: Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung, Michelle Yeoh
Directed by: Stanley Tong</P>
<P>Jackie Chan has rocketed to mainstream acceptance with
Rumble in the Bronx, and Miramax and New Line have
deals lined up to distribute four more Jackie Chan
films between them.  With Jackie in the public eye so
much, many new fans are wondering about his older
films.  Unfortunatly many of the most readily available
rentals are old, dull films, made before Jackie Chan
really developed a personal style.  With this series of
reviews, I intend to cover a broad range of his better
works.  While they are not easy to find, I hope that
people who read these reviews and are interested in the
films will be inspired to seek out the specialty shops
and Chinatowns where these movies _are_ available, and
see Jackie not as he appears in his early chop-sockey
films or even as he appears in the weak Rumble in the
Bronx, but as the charming, talented, amazing
entertainer that he is.</P>
<P>One of Jackie Chan's most spectacular and 
enjoyable films is his 1992 hit Police Story III: 
Supercop.  While it is the third installment of this 
highly successful and entertaining series, there is no 
difficulty in understanding it if you haven't seen the 
first two.  In these films, Jackie plays a determined 
and eager Hong Kong cop named Chan Chia-chu, who finds 
himself in the midst of all manner of criminal 
mischief, which he kung fu kicks and jokes his way out 
of with a "just part of my job" stoicism.  A running 
gag which crops up in this movie is Chia-chu's 
relationship with his pretty, but jealous girlfriend 
May (Maggie Cheung).</P>
<P>At the beginning of Police Story III: Supercop, we 
learn that Interpol and the Royal Hong Kong Police are 
looking for a cop to do the almost impossible (and 
extremely dangerous, natch) job of doing something 
about drug smuggling in Southeast Asia.  Guess who gets 
tricked by his superiors into volunteering?  </P>
<P>After a classic Jackie bit in which Chia-chu makes 
arrangements with May in case he doesn't return -- 
without telling her he's doing anything dangerous -- 
he's off to China, where he is given an undercover 
identity as a small-time criminal by Director Yang, a 
Chinese police officer who just happens to be a 
beautiful woman (Michelle Yeoh).  Well, in all honesty,
I had trouble following the plot after this point; it 
has holes the size of a freight train, and I think 
there are some scenes missing in the version I saw (or 
maybe it just seems like there are).  If you can look 
beyond this, though (and even I, fussy movie watcher 
that I am, had no problem with simply ignoring the 
gaps), you're in for a real treat: the movie, 
particularly the second half, alternates between 
hilariously funny and absolutely amazing, featuring 
some of the most amazing stunts ever put on film.</P>
<P>Jackie is in great form here.  Sure, he doesn't 
have an amazing range as an actor, but that's not the 
point.  He's as charming, witty and charismatic as 
ever, and a real joy to watch.  And when he performs 
his stunts and fight scenes, it is easy to see why he 
is so deservedly popular an action star.  In one heart-
stopping scene, he leaps from a rooftop onto a rope 
ladder dangling from a helicopter, which then flies 
through downtown Kuala Lumpur trying to shake him off.  
The camera angles make it perfectly clear both that it 
really is Jackie on the end of that rope ladder and 
that it was shot without special effects: he really is 
flailing around thirty stories up or passing so close 
over a train that he is momentarily obscured by the 
engine's smoke!</P>
<P>Yeoh is also enjoyable to watch as the efficient 
Communist cop who ends up teaming with Jackie.  Not 
only is she very attractive, she is a great action 
movie star, and she gets some of the best fight scenes, 
comic situations (just watch what she does when she 
finds herself in the middle of a gunfight with a 
bullet-proof vest full of dynamite (!) ), and stunts 
(in one amazing sequence, she jumps from a hill to the 
top of a moving train on a motorcycle).  At times, she 
threatens to upstage Jackie on his home turf, certainly 
no easy feat.  </P>
<P>One of the few weak points of the film, though, is that 
Yeoh and Jackie don't really have any chemistry 
together.  I got the impression that nobody was really 
sure if they should have a cop-buddy relationship or 
some sort of sexual tension between them, so they 
decided to have neither, though there are a few hints 
at both.  While it doesn't really hurt the film, it 
would have been nice to see something besides general 
coolness between these two engaging entertainers,
especially since the unconventional but successful
Chia-chu and the tough, by-the-book Inspector Yang are
obviously meant to represent Hong Kong and mainland
China: it would be nice to explore that subtext in
a bit more detail.</P>
<P>There is, however, great chemistry between Jackie 
and Cheung, whom he runs into while undercover in 
Malaysia, and it is not at all hard to see why their 
relationship has been a thread running through the 
series.  Jackie is at his most engaging when he has 
someone equally charming and down-to-earth like Cheung 
to work off of.  The scenes where Chia-chu is torn 
between the demands of his job and his unwillingness to 
risk angering May are some of the warmest and funniest 
of the film.</P>
<P>Overall, this is a great action film, and features 
some of Jackie Chan's most amazing stunts, as well as a 
great supporting cast and some very funny bits.  It is 
also one of his most "western" films in terms of action 
and style, and people who think they might be turned 
off by Jackie Chan's brand of kung fu comedy but are 
still interested in the man might want to look at this 
film first.</P>
