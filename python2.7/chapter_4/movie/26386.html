<P>   "Meet the Parents" is a perfect title, an ideal label for a
movie that is about just that.  By contrast, the awkward "Pay
It Forward" is an expression so stilted, so convoluted that the
characters in Mimi Leder's movie get to repeat the phrase a
dozen times or so to make sure that every last audience
member understands the connotation, which is: When a
character does you a good turn, don't pay the favor back.  
Instead pay it forward by doing a kindness for three other people.  
Be sure you tell each of the three other people to do
something for three more.  Pretty soon, following a geometric
progression, the whole world becomes a better place.  </P>
<P>   Sounds good, but just how do we interpret "do something
for someone else?"  If you give up your seat in the subway
car to an elderly person, you're doing good, and if that
person who just assumed your seat says a really pleasant
"good morning" to a neighbor, she's doing something good. 
The problem is that just about everyone does something that
benefits another person every day, and yet the world is not
the utopia that its originator promised.</P>
<P>   What started this idea? None other than a middle-school
social studies teacher in the Las Vegas suburbs, the lonely,
quiet, and unassuming Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey), who
springs to life only when he's in front of a stack of eleven-
year olds.  Delivering an introductory lesson on the opening
day of school--without even bothering to take attendance or
distribute textbooks--he flips up a map of the U.S. and
demonstrates with stick figures how his pay-it-forward
concept works.  When a particularly attentive lad, Trevor
McKinney (Haley Joel Osment), challenges the instructor by
asking what he ever did to help change the world, Simonet is
caught off guard.  Couldn't he just say that by teaching 100
kids every day he is doing far more than most others to help
complete strangers rather than paying back his mom and
others who served him in the past?  </P>
<P>   As Leder begins her film, based on Leslie Dixon's
adaptation of Catherine Ryan Hyde's novel, she takes a page
or two out of just about any movie about kids in schools
making "Pay It Forward" a "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" without
the laughs or "If" without the fiery rebellion.  More eager to
please the three-hanky crowd than to evoke laughs or create
something of quality, Leder turns the story into a do-good
soap with conventional cinematography--which means that
though she may be justified in infusing more melodrama than
you'd find in a humdrum day, she would do well at least to
keep her characters believable.  This is the hardly the case.  </P>
<P>   In one circumstance, for example, Trevor, taking the
teacher's opening day assignment seriously, discovers a
group of drug-addicted losers during one of his furious bike
rides. Without knowing a thing about them, he invites Jerry
the junkie (James Caviezal) to his home without his mother's
permission, feeds him, and allows his mom to risk a heart
attack upon discovering this disheveled stranger in their
home.  Jerry, not knowing the social studies teacher's rules,
fixes the family truck, thereby paying it back instead of
forward.</P>
<P>   The principal goal of the gifted eleven-year-old is to fix her
mother up with his favorite teacher, since the boy's own
drunken father had abandoned the family months before. 
(Isn't that paying back his teacher and his mother for the
good they did to him rather than paying it forward?  But never
mind.)  Extra suds notwithstanding, the boy's mother, Arlene
(Helen Hunt), is an alcoholic who is warned to stay away
from booze: to avoid men for at least a year lest she be put
into an atmosphere where others are drinking.  This does not
stop her from being a cocktail waitress in Vegas club.  In a
subplot that seems to come from another movie rather than
meshing successfully into this one, reporter Chris Chandler
(Jay Mohr) is given a free Jaguar by a complete stranger
after his own Mustang is totaled, and suspecting that the
donor is in a cult, he tracks down the story--one which
involves a favor done to the sports-car enthusiast by a
common hoodlum that may have saved his daughter's life,
and so the executive is paying the favor forward.  (Wouldn't
the suit be doing more for society if he sold that Jag and
donated the money to a needy person rather than to a
middle-class journalist?)</P>
<P>   What a humiliation for Kevin Spacey to emerge from
superior films like "American Beauty" and "The Big Kahuna,"
lowering himself by accepting a script that requires him to
act the part of a burn victim who in one climactic scene
that you've seen dozens of times before relates the story of
his childhood abuse.  Helen Hunt is made up to look so
haggard that you wonder if the cosmetician ever heard the
expression "less is more."  And James Caviezel: how can you
go from a strong, genuinely emotional piece of work as Frank
Sullivan's son, John, in "Frequency" to accept the role of a
saintly bum who not only repairs a long dormant truck but
even saves a woman from jumping off a bridge?  The only
pleasure in this film is the work of Haley Joel Osment, the
sort of kid any teacher would want in his classes, one who
uses his ingenuity to design a plan to capture a stepfather for
himself.</P>
<P>   This movie is sappy, unbelievable, and utterly
conventional in design.  There now.  I've done you a favor.
Pay It Forward.  Better still, pay it back.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 109 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
