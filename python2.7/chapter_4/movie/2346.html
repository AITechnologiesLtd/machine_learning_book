<PRE>"I'm afraid I panicked."
                - C.S. Lewis on why he ordered a gin-and-tonic on his
                  honeymoon.</PRE>
<P>     Richard Attenborough had a good year in '93.  He breezed his way
through JURASSIC PARK with a warm performance as the didn't-mean-to-
be-evil scientist.  And, in December, he served up his own movie magic
with SHADOWLANDS, the touching, true-life story of how author
C. S. Lewis discovered love very late in his life.</P>
<P>     The story opens in 1952 at Oxford University.  Lewis is already a
world-renowned children's author, much to the bemusement of his friends
and fellow faculty members.  They chide "Jack," as he's called, because
they know all too well of his controlled, insulated world --a world
with no seeming accommodation for children or child-like behavior.</P>
<P>     Into that world steps Joy Gresham, an American poet who has been
corresponding with Lewis.  Her letters hint of a special awareness into
his character.  And when she travels to England with her son, Joy
discovers a common bond with her favorite author--a bond that is
tested by friendship, love, and illness....</P>
<P>SHADOWLANDS is a delightfully unobtrusive film.</P>
<P>     Director Attenborough lets his actors act with an uncommon
sparsity of intrusive technique.  Given the very melodramatic nature of
the story, the film's plain-vanilla wrapper is almost staggering. And
yet, with hardly any overt manipulation from the filmmaker, the story
still makes quite an impact.</P>
<P>     (If nothing else, see it for the background music that stays in
the background! :-)</P>
<P>     Structurally, SHADOWLANDS weakens somewhere in the last third.</P>
<P>     The story wanders off-course for a bit as the characters grapple
with a host of "heavier" themes.  The saturating solemnity--coupled
with an already strained running time--results in a story that seems
to lose steam before galloping onward to its fine finish.</P>
<P>     Despite the weakened final act, SHADOWLANDS is still a very
rewarding experience.  Credit the combined efforts of a talented cast
and an excellent writer.</P>
<P>     Playing his second repressed-but-I-like-it character since THE
REMAINS OF THE DAY, Hopkins glides through with his role with magical
ease.  His part is much more expressive, though no more interesting,
than his last role of Stevens the Butler.  He'll be a front-runner for
Best Actor.</P>
<P>     Winger pulls off an equally fine performance--her first in quite
some time.  She walks and talks American, but her eyes flash with
unexpected intelligence.  She's the perfect foil for the stately actor.</P>
<P>     The supporting players are tremendous.  Standouts include John
Wood, Peter Firth, and Edward Hardwicke as "Jack's" droll brother
Warnie.</P>
<P>     Writer William Nicholson helps the actors along with line after
line of quotable dialogue.  Though his script is heavy on the meanings
of life, love, and loss, humor wins the day for most of the movie.  Some
of the better bits include Winger's first appearance in a British tea
room, a hilarious roundtable discussion on Christmas, and a classic bit
of Hopkins ordering room service.</P>
<PRE>Bottom line: SHADOWLANDS is the touching, true-life story of how
             C. S. Lewis discovered love very late in his life.
             Seemingly overlong, due to a weakened third act, this
             delightful film is a stunning showcase for everyone
             involved.
