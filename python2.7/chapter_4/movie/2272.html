                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Jacob Tierney, Noah Fleiss, Martha Plimpton, Stephen
Tobolowsky.
Screenplay:  Frank Deese.
Director:  Billy Weber.</PRE>
<P>     Every once in a while, I come upon a movie where I simply can't
get beyond the basic premise; as well as certain individual elements
might be executed, I'm so turned off by that premise that I can't
possibly enjoy the film.  Such was the case with last year's RADIO
FLYER, where children in a dysfunctional household were used as the
launching pad for an adventure.  Now comes JOSH AND S.A.M., similarly
focused on the exploits of two troubled kids, and again my rejection
mechanism kicked in.  There is some charm to be found in the
performances, but overall it simply depressed me, and wrapped up a
disturbing package far too neatly.</P>
<P>     JOSH AND S.A.M. is the story of two children struggling to cope
with their parents' divorce.  12-year-old Josh (Jacob Tierney) is a shy
computer whiz who prefers living with mom; 8-year-old Sam (Noah Fleiss)
is a fight-prone daydreamer who enjoys time with dad (Stephen
Tobolowsky).  On one visit with their father's new family in Florida
tensions boil over between the brothers, and Josh convinces Sam that
he's a Strategically Altered Mutant, or S.A.M.  Josh uses the deception
in an attempt to run away, but instead the boys end up on the road
together, depending on each other and a friendly hitchhiker (Martha
Plimpton).</P>
<P>     JOSH AND S.A.M. hinges on the fact that Sam almost immediately
believes the improbable story that he is a genetically engineered
fighter, the evidence consisting of "documents" that Josh has mocked up
on his father's computer.  It's a stretch to accept that Sam would buy
such a ridiculous concept, especially when he knows his brother is so
adept with computers.  Screenwriter Frank Deese attempts to bypass this
plausibility problem by having Sam say that the "fact" that he is an
S.A.M. explains why he thinks about being dead all the time.  Suddenly
JOSH AND S.A.M. becomes the tale of a cruel prank perpetrated on a
deeply disturbed little boy, and it becomes extremely unpleasant to
watch.  These problems are further compounded when JOSH AND S.A.M. aims
for an inappropriately upbeat conclusion.  The two children are
repeatedly treated with cruelty and inconsideration by their parents
and extended families, and these issues are almost completely glossed
over.  Dad makes a relatively sincere apology, but for a film which
uses serious family problems to set up its hijinks, it's
disappointingly timid in dealing with the repercussions.</P>
<P>     Its dark undertones are not the only problem with JOSH AND S.A.M.,
however.  A certain amount of contrivance is practically required in
capers such as this, but JOSH AND S.A.M. really pushes the envelope.
The event which forces Josh to run is a strained sequence involving
Chris Penn as a drunken Texan, and he really doesn't work.  Most
baffling is the role played by Martha Plimpton, an ill-defined runaway
who appears and disappears without leaving any recognizable imprint on
the story.  Somewhere in that character was a relevant back-story, but
it never made it to the screen.  There is even a tossed-off attempt to
make her a romantic interest for Josh, which is raised and resolved in
under five minutes of screen time.  JOSH AND S.A.M asks for far too
much leeway, and offers far too little reward in return.</P>
<P>     As disturbed and disappointed as I was in the story, I have to
acknowledge the appeal of the two lead performances.  Jacob Tierney is
very good as the bright and resourceful Josh, best of all in the
obligatory "fool the stupid cop" sequence, and Noah Fleiss brings real
heartbreak to the truly confused Sam.  The two are convincing brothers
throughout, and I liked the rapport between them.  Still, I found
myself dwelling on its handling of a serious subject matter in a manner
I found inappropriate.  There is no such thing as an objective review,
but in this case I can't even pretend otherwise.  I found nothing fun
about watching two kids in desperate need of therapy taking a joy
ride.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 S.A.M.'s:  4.</PRE>
