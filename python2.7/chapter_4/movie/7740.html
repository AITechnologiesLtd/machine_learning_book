                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>****
1941, not rated, 119 minutes [1 hour, 59 minutes]
[drama]
starring: Orson Welles (Charles Foster Kane), Joseph Cotton (Jedediah
Leland), Dorothy Comingore (Susan Alexander), Evertt Sloane (Mr. Bernstein),
written by Orson Welles, Herman J. Mankiewicz, produced and directed by Orson
Welles.</P>
<P>We have all been told money, wealth, and fame do not necessarily lead to
happiness, but time after time, we have ignored that message. "Citizen Kane"
is a powerful story of a man whose intentions were good, but as hard as he
tried, couldn't accept the fact money isn't everything.</P>
<P>Although the film does not tell a straight, linear story, it isn't difficult
to follow. It makes excellent use of the medium of cinema: the acting is
outstanding; the design is beautifully detailed; and the direction that
brings everything together is perfectly construed. In fact, it's difficult to
critically review it for chance of leaving out the smallest of the film's
important elements.</P>
<P>The film opens in an enigmatic manner as the camera pans through a
Gothic-like mansion. The word "Rosebud" is whispered. Suddenly we see a news
serial which gives a brief overview of a newspaper tycoon named Charles
Foster Kane (Welles). When the serial ends there is a scene of several
reporters discussing it. They agree they must find out more about Kane,
because as much information there is about him, no one knew who he really
was.</P>
<P>Welles and Mankiewicz's script is well paced and chiseled with detail. The
story is not linear, but the arrangement and composition is brilliant. The
story is told from the perspective of a reporter (Alan Ladd) who tracks down
all the important people in Kane's life. He wants to know what Kane meant
when he uttered "Rosebud" as he died. This makes for a sense of mystery and
suspense, because we are just as curious as the reporter. </P>
<P>As interpretations of Kane are given, clues appear subtilely, which are
later recognized through other narrations and flashbacks. The film's
attention to detail and plot structure is intricate, yet the storytelling is
so breezy. The film's ability to do both and do them so well really makes it
a masterpiece. </P>
<P>As a young man, Kane was arrogant and brash because he never had to worry
about money. He is also hypocritical: he pledges honesty to his readers, but
the paper is mostly gossip and editorials; he is married, yet he is
enthralled by showgirls. His life is obviously metaphoric of many ideas, but
it would be impossible to list and describe them all. </P>
<P>The film was shot using a deep focus process which allows everything that
appears on the screen to remain constantly in focus. Welles uses the approach
to add to the rich atmosphere: the looks on people's faces; the objects on
the walls; and entirely separate actions that either influence or represent
other themes within the film.</P>
<P>The mysterious reporter never does find out the meaning to "Rosebud." Only
we, the viewers, realize what the term meant through brilliant, classic
irony.</P>
<P>"Citizen Kane" works on many levels: as a touching drama; as a perfectly
scripted and well acted story; as a timeless social commentary; and as a
breakthrough in cinematic design. Everything that could be great here is.</P>
