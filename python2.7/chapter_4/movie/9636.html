<P>This season needs another serial killer movie like Kathie Lee Gifford 
needs more public devastation. But lo and behold, here comes 
"SwitchBack," and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as "Kiss the 
Girls" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer." But "SwitchBack" is an 
undoubtedly weak genre entry, as the material it covers is old and 
tired, and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of 
the proceedings interesting. </P>
<P>"SwitchBack" opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of 
the young child she's watching. We learn late in the game that the kid 
belongs to FBI agent Frank LaCrosse (Dennis Quaid), and that the 
kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that LaCrosse has been tracking 
across the country for quite a while. He is promptly removed from the 
case, but this conflict of interest doesn't keep him from offering 
pursuit. LaCrosse's most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel 
room in Amarillo, Texas, where the local sheriff (R. Lee Ermey) is torn 
between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man. </P>
<P>In a related aside, former railway worker Bob Goodall (Danny Glover) is 
cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered (even on the 
seatbelts) El Dorado. Along the way, he picks up -- and subsequently 
saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner Lane Dixon (Jared Leto). This 
tangent isn't a random one, as Bob or Lane will end up either holding a 
piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself. Or is the 
villain in fact LaCrosse, only pretending to be after the cold-hearted
murderer he knows so much about. </P>
<P>In a sense, that's half of the basic problem with "SwitchBack." For its 
first hour, the movie presents evidence that any of these three men 
could be the perpetrator, so we're given little insight into who they 
are, likely for fear that we'll learn too much too fast and therefore be 
able to make the proper deduction. But "SwitchBack" then decides to 
explicitly reveal the killer's identity at its midpoint, and the 
following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and 
the generation of suspense. </P>
<P>Some of the acting is a burdensome area as well, probably because the 
performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite 
of their true selves. What is Danny Glover doing here, grinning and 
yeehawing his way through the messy plot? And Dennis Quaid? (That 
monotone -- stop it!) Ermey is solid in a supporting role that's more 
interesting than the two leads thrown together, but the charismatic Leto 
(Claire Danes' object of affection in "My So-Called Life") is a 
scene-stealer tried and true. </P>
<P>>From a material standpoint, "SwitchBack" is pretty empty. But even when 
first-time director Jeb Stuart (who wrote "The Fugitive" and "Die Hard") 
doesn't know what to do, he knows what he wants it to look like -- the 
movie provides some great visuals. The set-on-a-train climax looks good 
(even though the action is illogical), and the beautiful, crisp 
cinematography captures the Rockies in all of their icy splendor. Still, 
that's not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond, and more than 
the movie's look will end up leaving you cold. </P>
