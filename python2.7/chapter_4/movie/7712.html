<PRE>                              THE NASTY GIRL
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>When Anja Rosmus researched her hometown's past during the Nazi era she
was subjected to all kinds of harassment and death threats, the least
of which was being referred to as "that terrible girl". . . or as
translated for the film's title, "that nasty girl."</P>
<P>Based on her story of her research and the town's reaction we are
treated to a most wonderful film which despite its very serious subject
contains much humor.  Lena Stolze does a great job as Anja growing from
a teenager early in the film to a mother of 2 children.</P>
<P>It starts with Anna's teen years in a Catholic school, her winning a
national essay contest and her decision to enter another essay contest
picking as her subject, in all innocence, the people of her home town
during the Nazi period.</P>
<P>When she begins the research she is surprised to find that she is being
thwarted in her every attempt to read the town's, the library's and the
church's archives of that period.  As she digs into whatever
information she can gather she discovers that many of the present day
respectable citizens behaved despicably to the Jews, confiscating their
property, accusing them of crimes and allowing them to be sent to
concentration camps.   Although one never hears any talk of that
period,  Anja discovers that the town even had its own concentration
camp.</P>
<P>Very much in a documentary fashion but with a very effective twist, the
film's characters will frequently turn to the audience and explain what
is happening and the circumstances surrounding their actions.   That
all of this is done with a light touch to make its point is
attributable to the talents of its director.  And the point of the film
is to show that 50 years later there is still much hidden in the hearts
of many Germans, and that among many of the young, Hitler is still an
idol.</P>
<PRE>In German, with English subtitles.</PRE>
<P>Masterfully directed by Michael Verhoeven</P>
