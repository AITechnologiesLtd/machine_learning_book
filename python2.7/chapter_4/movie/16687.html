<PRE>My Favorite Martian (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 37</PRE>
<P>Films like "Shakespeare in Love", "Elizabeth" and
"The Thin Red Line" are currently playing in theatres.
The Academy Award season is usually the best time
to go to the movies, as the studios hope to capitalize
on the resulting publicity of the nominees.  But with
all these fine films playing, I went to see
"My Favorite Martian".  I have an excuse: my wife
wanted to see it, and with Valentine's Day approaching,
I needed brownie points.</P>
<P>Having wasted ninety minutes of my life watching this
bad-but-not-truly-awful attempted comedy, I now must
further waste time writing a review.  The pen may
not be mightier than the sword, but at least I can
get some sort of revenge on Disney studios with
my review.</P>
<P>Is there anything nice that can be said about
"My Favorite Martian"?  There is an entertaining chase
scene involving a spaceship, a sewer tunnel, and a
roto-rooter.  There might be three good jokes
for those with great patience and forgiving natures.
Elizabeth Hurley is very attractive and has nice legs.
She also overacts, but perhaps the director can
be blamed for this.  There is a silly silver suit that
talks (think "Roger Rabbit".  Whatever happened to Roger,
anyway?).  I was indifferent to the suit's antics, but
the kids in the theater loved it.  If, God help us,
there is a sequel, expect the silver suit to have a
leading role.</P>
<P>Hollywood is determined to make a movie version of
every 60s television series, no matter its quality.
When will they get around to 'Green Acres', with
Dustin Hoffman replacing Eddie Albert and Fran Drescher
replacing Eva Gabor?  And who will play Arnold the pig?
While the World ponders this momentous casting
decision, I guess that I had better say something
about the film I am supposed to be reviewing.</P>
<P>A plot summary is overdue.  Jeff Daniels is a struggling
reporter, who wants selfish daddy's girl Hurley,
instead of Darryl Hannah who wants him.  Daniels gets
a scoop opportunity when a Martian (Christopher Lloyd,
with his usual goofy mad scientist schtick) lands and
kidnaps him.  Like in "Starman", Fed agents pick up
the trail, led by obnoxious character actor Wallace Shawn.</P>
<P>Daniels does better than expected. Hannah needs better
costumes. Ray Walston has the requisite cameo to provide
a link to the original series.  Lloyd makes goofy faces.
Ten year old kids will enjoy the movie more than their
escorting parents.  Enough said.</P>
