<P>10 Things I Hate About You is an update of the classic play, The Taming 
of the Shrew. That said, drop any pre-conceived notions of what 
Shakespeare's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to 
Padua High School, home of a student counselor (Allison Janney) who 
obsesses over the male penis; a slightly too hip and racist 
African-American English teacher (Daryl Mitchell); a new kid named 
Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); a model named Joey (Andrew Keegan), the 
subject of Cameron and Joey's crushes; Bianca (Larisa Oleynik); and 
Bianca's sister - the shrew (Julia Stiles in a marvelous 
performance)- whose name is Katarina, Kat for short.</P>
<P>With movies about high schools similar to these running through 
projectors like water down the Nile, it would be quite easy to write off 
10 Things I Hate About You as just another doltish comedic-romance. Yet, 
you must realize that the story is timeless, and a few hundred years 
later it is equally as witty and comical as when Elizabeth gleefully 
looked on, groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage.</P>
<P>The first reminder of the original scribe can be found in Katarina and 
Bianca's last name: Stratford. Their family is run by Walter Stratford 
(Pretty Woman's Larry Miller), a doctor who is all too familiar with 
teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly. In what he thinks 
to be a moment of ironic humor, the family "no dating" policy is amended 
to "Bianca can date...when [Katarina] does." With prom just ahead, 
Bianca's fate is grim; unless, of course, she can tame the shrew. 
Don't think this mission to be a simple one, as Bianca kindly points 
out, her sister "... is a particularly hideous breed of loser."</P>
<P>Getting Katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing. When 
Cameron, who likes Bianca, learns of her father's new rule, he is 
quick to consult a friend for advice. The scheme they dream up is to 
fully exploit "someone with money." In this case, that is Joey - the 
other guy with a crush on Bianca. Cameron's friend, a loser by teenage 
verdict, convinces Joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the 
shrew out. The solution lies no farther away than the second blatant 
reminder of the master scribe: Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger). This 
Verona is far from fair; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene 
in prison. Moreover, Katarina openly opined to the aforementioned 
English teacher that "Hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around 
Picasso, hoping to nail his leftovers." The laws of high school cinema 
inexorably turn Patrick and Katarina into Romeo and Juliet.</P>
<P>Providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isn't exactly what 
Shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school 
comedy: A party polluted with liquor, a best friend's betrayal, and 
prom. It is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like 
Drive Me Crazy, American Pie, Never Been Kissed, Carrie, She's All 
That, and Can't Hardly Wait. Yet surely even these practices have 
roots in Shakespeare; Falstaff was a drunk, Romeo and Juliet met at a 
party, and Caesar learned about loyalty the hard way.</P>
