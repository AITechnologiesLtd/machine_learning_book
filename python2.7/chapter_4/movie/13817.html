<P>Sequels are not usually a promising commodity. In most cases it's an
exercise in excess. More action, more violence, more noise,
etc. etc. What is hoped for in these franchises is that you have
something to connect with. And hopefully that is the characters that
made the original film so enjoyable. With the release of Richard
Donner's fourth and final entry in the LETHAL WEAPON series we are
given a serviceable plot with more character interaction than any of
the previous films in the series.</P>
<P>The story opens with our heroic trio Riggs, Murtaugh and Leo Getz
enjoying a late night out on Roger's finished boat. Unfortunately they
run afoul of an uncharted cargo ship which wrecks their fishing
boat. Giving chase, they crash the ship onto the docks. Riggs suffers
a surprise attack by an asian martial artist (James Lew), and is
unable to catch any of the bad guys. Murtaugh and Getz manage to save
themselves and soon the three discover that the cargo ships hold is
filled with illegal aliens from China. After the police arrive,
Murtaugh discovers a family of Chinese hiding in one of the row
boats. Feeling a sense of familial responsibility, Murtaugh takes the
family (against proper procedure) under his wing, giving them
sanctuary in his own home.</P>
<P>It is soon learned that there is an underground market for slave labor
from China in L.A. A custom of paying a debt through labor. But there
is more to this incident than that. As Murtaugh and Riggs investigate
the situation further they find more evidence leading to the purchase
of four Triad leaders from mainland China. But there is even more
subterfuge involved. The cost of rescuing these four criminals is
millions of dollars in Chinese currency. What the Triads have done is
hired through debt, a Chinese artist to counterfeit Chinese
currency. These plates are to be used to print the money with which
the Triads are to pay the corrupt Chinese officials. The debt being
paid is the delivery of his Brother's family to America.</P>
<P>"Lethal Weapon 4" is a wonderfully entertaining continuation of the
popular franchise. While the plot is a little light in development, it
holds your attention. What makes this film so enjoyable is, of coarse
the chemistry between Gibson and Glover. The friendship between these
two characters has moved beyond the standard homo-erotic essence of
the earliest films. These men are now family, brothers of
spirit. Riggs in the film plays with a zen like philosophy of mental
will power. He is coming to terms with his mortality. This is
amplified by the pregnancy of Larna Cole (Rene Russo). Riggs must lay
down his loss and his mania, if he is to survive. And it is this act
of conformity that almost costs him his life. As in the earlier
sequels, Riggs is becoming less of a lethal weapon, while Murtaugh is
becoming more of one. Murtaugh in each succeeding film has placed his
family in more and more danger, and that is because he is also a
lethal weapon, like Riggs but has conformed and masked that quality in
himself ("I'm too old for this shit"), but always manages to return to
what may have been a former self in times of stress and need. With
this film both characters are questioning their age and what their
life is going to become. Hence, this may be the last film in the
series, since Riggs and Murtaugh have to convince themselves that
'They are not too old'.</P>
<P>The main villain Wah Sing Ku is played by Hong Kong superstar Jet Li,
and his inclusion in this film is revolutionary. Never on U.S. screens
have we seen this masterful a presentation of martial artistry since
Bruce Lee. This man looks deadly. His calm, seemingly emotionless
demeanor is simply a mask hiding a raging tiger. When Mr. Li lets
loose, you can only be certain that you'll want to see more of this
incredibly talented man.</P>
<P>Chris Rock is added to the cast as Lee Butters, and he brings his
trademark style of rapid fire comedy to the team. The secret to his
character is that he is married to Murtaugh's daughter (unknown to
Murtaugh), and treats his stepfather with so much respect, that
Murtaugh mistakes the younger mans attention as possibly homosexual in
context.</P>
<P>All of the characters in the film act on behalf of their families. So,
while Jet Li may be the villain of the piece, he has as strong a
conviction and moral purpose as Riggs or Murtaugh. This is the best
development in the script.</P>
<P>Richard Donner continues to prove that he can direct an action film in
his sleep. His style is so effortless and uncomplicated that the film
moves with a brisk and flawless pace. This is no faint
praise. Mr. Donner is becoming of of our best Directors. The script by
Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, Channing Gibson and Shane Black is
remarkably tight considering the differing styles of each author. This
is a credit to producer Joel Silver and Richard Donner, who's sense of
story and character is as strong as ever.</P>
<P>Lethal Weapon 4 is a fine piece of entertainment and a worthy finish
to a classic series. Why do I call this the last of the series. Well
durring the end credits, we are shown a photo album with photos past
and present of all four films. The last shot is of the book
closing.. on the series.</P>
<P>On a scale of *****, "Lethal Weapon 4' rates ****.</P>
