PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></PRE>
<P>Can indie film God John Sayles actually get more independent?  After the
critical and commercial success and a Best Original Screenplay Oscar
nomination for 1996's Lone Star, Sayles has made a slower, richer film
about Central American politics with no big stars, that is predominantly
voiced in Spanish, Nahuatl, Mayan and Kuna.  Is he trying to keep people
at home or what?</P>
<P>Sayles has cast Argentine acting great Federico Luppi (Cronos) to play
Fuentes, a well to do doctor in a fictitious country who spends him time
training future doctors to bring modern medicine to the surrounding
`inaccessible' jungle areas.  When Fuentes happens upon a promising
former student running stolen stereo equipment, the out of touch doctor
becomes afraid that his pet project might not be doing as well as he had
thought.</P>
<P>Fuentes decides to take a holiday from his private practice to see if
his other students have fallen from medical grace as well.  Armed with
only a freshly pressed dress shirt, snow-white hair and a shiny
four-wheel drive vehicle, he drives deeper and deeper into both the
tangled jungle and an intriguing mystery.  It seems that some of the
villages are either completely deserted or only inhabited by a few
people who refuse to speak to Fuentes.  The mass genocide has apparently
made them leery of any outsider.  Of course, the government blames
guerillas for wiping out the small villages, while the guerillas blame
rogue bands of government troops for doing the same.</P>
<P>The interaction between Fuentes and the cast of characters he meets on
his journey are fascinating. Rounding out a fine international ensemble
is Kathryn Grody (The Lemon Sisters) and Chicago Hope star Mandy
Patinkin, who play an annoying American tourist couple.  Their lines are
the only English spoken in the film.</P>
<P>The script has a similar slow-handed pace to Lone Star and was
magnificently shot by Slawomir Idziak (Gattaca).  Sayles, who also
edited the film, has again crafted a phenomenal story that shows his
diverse tastes.  A sample of his past work reveals films featuring black
aliens, baseball gambling, coal mining, crippled soap opera stars and
Irish folklore.  You can't get a better medley that that and Sayles has
shown that he is definitely at the top of his game with Hombres Armados
(Men With Guns).</P>
