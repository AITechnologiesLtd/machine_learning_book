<PRE>                                DAYTRIPPERS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>A "daytripper," I have learned, is someone who cheats on a spouse,
usually around lunch time or while "staying late at the office."  THE
DAYTRIPPERS is a delightfully humorous look at one family when wife
Eliza (Hope Davis) who thinks her marriage is just great comes across
what may very well be a love poem from someone signed "Sandy" to her
husband, Louis (Stanley Tucci).</P>
<P>What is a shocked, suspicious wife to do but run off to her parents'
home, Rita (Anne Meara) and Jim (Pat McNamara) to seek advice.  Jim is
the downtrodden, silent husband who never comments about anything.
Wife Rita makes up for his silence by never shutting up for a moment,
voicing opinions on everything and expecting her every command to be
obeyed.</P>
<P>When Eliza arrives, she is met not only by her parents but also by her
sister Jo (Parker Posey) and Jo's boyfriend Carl (Liev Schreiber).
After reading the poem, mom Rita decides that this calls for immediate
action, ordering the five to hop into a cab and go to the office where
Louis works.  Louis is not there; he has been given the day off.  Wifey
did not know he was going to be off..  Smell a rat?  Something rotten
in Denmark? Nothing to do but track that daytripper and find out what
is going on.</P>
<P>Anne Meara's "mom" is the film's main character . . . and "character"
is the precise word. She is an overbearing, driven, take-no-prisoners
Mom.  Meara is superb; good to see her in action again.  Everyone in
the cast is just right but the star is really the wonderfully realistic
dialogue by writer Greg Mottola. . . and the film's surprise ending.
All the speaking lines ring true, a great plus for any film.</P>
<P>What happens when the family finally finds the elusive daytripper?  Why
not see the film and enjoy it and laugh as I did, right down to the
last moments.  Excellent.</P>
<P>Written and directed by Greg Mottola.</P>
