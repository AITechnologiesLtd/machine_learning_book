<PRE>                              TRIAL AND ERROR
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>'TRIAL AND ERROR' OBJECTS TO BEING ORIGINAL</P>
<P>It's a struggle for a lot of television stars to make a transition to
the big screen.  Two of the most successful have to be Robin Williams
and Tom Hanks.  Other stars such as Tom Selleck, Shelley Long, David
Caruso and Roseanne have had luke warm, little or no success at it.
Michael Richards is certainly the funniest second banana on television
today with his wacky portrayal as Kramer on the top rated television
comedy 'Seinfeld'.  He attempts to strut his stuff in the latest comedy
from Jonathan Lynn ('Clue', 'My Cousin Vinny', 'Greedy') entitled
'Trial and Error'.</P>
<P>Jeff Daniels ('Dumb and Dumber', 'Gettysburg', 'Terms of Endearment')
also stars as a high profile, conservative attorney who is sent by his
firm's boss from Beverly Hills to Nevada to represent a member of the
family (Rip Torn in a genuinely entertaining role) on trial for fraud.
Daniels gets drunk at his bachelor party the night before and by nature
of a hangover the next morning his out of work actor friend (Richards)
substitutes for him in court and pretends to be the attorney of record
for the trial.  The problem now is that he has to keep on being the
attorney of record and things get sticky here to say the least.</P>
<P>I don't understand why Hollywood feels it's necessary to keep telling
the same story over and over again.  While 'Trial and Error' isn't a
complete disappointment because it does have some hilarious moments,
it's a movie of switching identities and getting through the system
very nervously which is something we've seen time and time again.
There is also a needless romantic sub plot where Daniels has an affair
with a beautiful waitress (Charlize Theron) and at the same time is
engaged to be married back home in California.</P>
<P>Jeff Daniels plays the straight man quite well in this one and Richards
does the best he can and you can tell at certain points where his
comedy is improvisational and while 'Trial and Error' hasn't cleared
the way for him to have a big career in the movies, Richards probably
has a better shot than most from today's television at breaking out.</P>
