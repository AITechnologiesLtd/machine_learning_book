<PRE>                           THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     You heard it here first:  1996 will be the year that puts French
cinema back on the map, at long last.  With both PURPLE NOON's re-release
and the arrival of THE VISITORS (the highest-grossing French film of all
time) later this year, we're guaranteed a couple of hits.  But the first of
these French delicacies to arrive will be THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF.</P>
<P>     Rumored to be the most expensive film ever shot in France, THE
HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF is the film adaptation of Jean Giono's popular novel
of the same name.  Directed by CYRANO DE BERGERAC's Jean-Paul Rappeneau,
this tale of love and tragedy in 1830's France is an exquisite period
piece, full of settings and photography as lush as its story line.</P>
<P>     This story involves an Italian revolutionary named Angelo (Olivier
Martinez), on the run from the law as well as the cholera epidemic that was
sweeping Europe at the time.  Forced into France to try to find his
compatriots, Angelo takes refuge in the home of the mysterious Pauline
(Juliette Binoche), and the two begin to grow close.</P>
<P>     As the cholera sweeps across France as well, Angelo finds himself
hunted by the locals, who fear him as a carrier of the disease.  Together
with Pauline, the two strike out across the countryside, each in search of
their own peace.</P>
<P>     The film, full of spectacular action scenes as well as touching or
romantic moments between the two principals, is a careful blend of the two
genres that works very well.  Special kudos to the actors, especially
Binoche, who plays her role as the noble woman with a cryptic goal (I won't
give it away) superbly.  The enormous cast of both speaking parts and
extras is handled well, and the scenes are perfectly choreographed.</P>
<P>     HORSEMAN's one flaw is its tendency to fall into what I call French
Movie Syndrome, with the characters spending long stretches of time in
monologues, reminiscing about characters and places we've never met or
never seen.  It's here that the viewer tends to doze off in hopes of a
swordfight or a fire.</P>
<P>     Otherwise, I have few complaints.  THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF should be
accessible to the same audience that made THE POSTMAN a success, and can be
enjoyed by a wide range of viewers.</P>
<PRE>     (Oh, and watch for a cameo by Gerard Depardieu.)</PRE>
