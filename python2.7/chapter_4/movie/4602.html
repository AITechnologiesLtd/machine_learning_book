<PRE>                                    EL CID
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>        The era of the roadshow -- big budgeted movies designed to battle
the rapid intrusion of television on box office receipts in the Fifties
and Sixties -- was mostly a pompous affair: movies that were one or two
hours longer than needed, elevated prices for reserved seats and
refreshments (like BEN-HUR candy bars), mementos such as stagebills &
souvenir booklets & sometimes glossy still packets, preludes, overtures,
intermissions, exit music. Most of these nothing-money-can't-buy
spectaculars, in spite of honorable intentions, weren't worth the trouble;
they were mostly globs of lush sets, costumes, over-scored music, special
effects demonstrations, ear-splitting sound, eye-popping panoramas --
reasons to spend money, to advance movie technology, to keep a lot of
people working. What other reasons were there for Sam Bronston to make THE
FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE? (But in Bronston's defense: his pre-Epcot Rome
has never been equaled, though the pornographic CALIGULA has a few
settings that come close, and Richard Fleischer's BARABBAS is so plausibly
evocative of the period that its "realism" is out and out depressing.) Of
all the epics that received the deluxe treatment, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's
CLEOPATRA and George Steven's THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD were so badly
butchered by executive fiat -- editing the movies down because of
complaints by the few and for the additional purpose of trying to squeeze
in more showings per day for more bucks -- that they have become objects
of sympathy. (Fox's video of CLEOPATRA, even without letterboxing, might
be the first quietly "restored" spectacle, yet Fox's two video releases of
GREATEST STORY remain 65 minutes short of its original running time.)
After the successful restoration of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, spearheaded by
Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, and following the renovation of
SPARTACUS, Scorsese set his sights on Anthony Mann's EL CID, considered by
many lovers of the genre as its epitome. Most of Scorsese's push to
restore these (and soon-to-be other) films has to do with the fear of
losing the productions, as intended by their makers, to the destructive
elements of time, environment and neglect on original negatives. As he
said of EL CID, "They can't make them like this anymore." He guesstimated
that the 1960-61 $14,000,000 cost of EL CID would approximate $129,000,000
in 1993 dollars. Probably an exaggerated figure, but producers reportedly
spent something close to $80-to-100 million on the megabomb THE LAST
ACTION HERO and something like $170 million on WATERWORLD, and some movie
makers are trying get $100 million to make an epic on the Crusades (with
Arnold!), so Scorsese's regrets should not be confused with future
possibilities. What he's saying is movie makers most likely won't attempt
to re-make a LAWRENCE or an EL CID again, and that's the strongest
imperative behind the restorations.</P>
<P>        When released in 1961, EL CID received some good reviews -- ending
up on Time's and the N.Y. Times' "Ten Best" lists -- but it came nowhere
near the domestic box office of BEN-HUR. It also met with unjust
comparisons: looking at BEN-HUR today, there's such fraudulence -- crammed
with faked backdrops, matte shots, obvious dummies on the miniature ships
and in the galley, embarrassingly revealing bits of stand-ins for the
principals -- that it becomes a hoot. (The 1926 BEN-HUR often more
realistic, like that tempting bare-assed slave chained in the galley.) You
wonder: What drove the masses to see it? Of course, the chariot race. And
superb marketing, with equally grand art work, tailored to religious suck
ups. (Every parochial school bused students downtown to Saturday morning
showings, hoping they'd be mesmerized, overwhelmed, therefore resurrected
by the solemn hymns; the hope being Hollywood could do in a few hours what
the Church took years to do -- transforms the kids from sinners to angelic
submissives.) Having but one splendid action sequence to grab and exhaust
us -- the two-man battle for the city of Calahorra directed by second unit
wizard Yakima Canutt (its other action scenes more than adequate,
notwithstanding Heston's comments in his self-congratulatory 1978  THE
ACTOR'S LIFE) -- EL CID had handicaps and prejudices to overcome. Coming
on the heals of biblical stories like THE ROBE, QUO VADIS, BEN-HUR,
SOLOMON AND SHEBA, THE BIG FISHERMAN and KING OF KINGS, another Bronston
spectacle, EL CID suffered not only because it's an "old Hollywood style"
epic, loaded down with pageantry, encased in stilted aphorisms much like
KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE and IVANHOE, but also because it's an account
of Spain's greatest hero about whom American audiences were neither aware
of nor really cared about. EL CID is indeed propelled along by an
extensive use of epigrams, and Loren delivers more of them than any other
cast member. Her best: "Since my love is not like other men, my life will
not be like other lives." (When Herbert Lom, the treacherous Emir Ben
Yussuf, is berating his men as softies and the camera moves in on the
indispensably nellie Frank Thring, he lashes out, "You have become
women!") And "old fashion" in style it is: perfunctory scenes are used to
advance the story along, there's pomp and clash & bang galore, the
mandatory insertion of good over evil. But unlike other medieval epics, EL
CID has been lavishly wrapped in authenticity: its sets are huge but
subdued in scale and detail for the 11th Century. The restoration of color
and clarity have given us the chance to ooh and aah at not only the
tapestries, murals, flags and other regalia but the real leathers used in
costumes for Heston and Raf Vallone: they're so vividly rich that you can
practically reach out and touch the textures. (Only one costume set sticks
out as atrocious: King Ferdinand's crown and cape of arms look like badly
sown together car decays. Forgiven when, having died, he's laid out on a
black and gold tapestry, which should be sold by JCPenny. And not the only
decoration from a Bronston epic that should be duplicated: Armstrong or
Mannington should consider selling replications of the best floor in all
of movies -- the inlaid masterpiece for Herod's palace in KING OF KINGS.)
The use of Spain's real castles and landscapes add immeasurable legitimate
weight -- underlining some of the overtly false, flimsy settings of
BEN-HUR. For those who have only seen the pre-restored EL CID on TV, or on
one of the two very poor quality video versions available, there must be
disappointment because not only is the color washed out, and no overtures
or exit music, but of course they miss entirely the sweep, the grandeur --
and a lot of tidbits: like watching the troops build their multi-story
ramps, or catching the facial reactions of the various ladies-in-waiting,
or getting to giggle at Thring's earrings or at Ben Yussuf's armies capped
in turbans that in succession look like mushrooms, candied jujubes, peanut
shells and the Elephant Man's head, or getting a good look at Vallone's
blooded-up chest, with its skin peeled back. State of the Art might not
have been a term yet coined, but Vallone's wounds, and Heston's facial
scar and the arrow that's embedded into his chest are excellent 1961
makeup effects. </P>
<P>        No American actor was born to play historic figures more than
Charlton Heston. His only rivals are Englishmen -- Rex Harrison, Peter
O'Toole, and Laurence Olivier, who, never looking more magisterial, steals
SPARTACUS away from Kirk Douglas. The epic as genre would have continued
on its loony, chaotic way without Heston, but as its center, he gave it
legitimacy; somehow his mid-Western intonational Voice of All Ages and his
handsome physical stature imposingly fused. He had the odd, unearned gift
of penetrating our modern cynicism and could redeem the stilted formal
lingo of spectaculars. And little quarrel that his shadow eclipsed those
in Hollywood epics who came before him, like Gregory Peck, or the
unnerving Robert Taylor, who always seemed to be waiting to break for a
cigarette. Part of this has to do with Heston's ability to look
appropriately weathered and flawed, as in EL CID. Yet he's not oversized,
either, like the stockyard beefiness of misfit Victor Mature; there's
something reassuring about how Heston's masculinity remains strongly
intact despite the furs, flowing capes and silks he's often been required
to wear. Because we'll never know what the men of history he's played will
sould like, Heston's legacy could be that we would expect them to come
close to matching him. (Especially true when he's done up as Andrew
Jackson.) That doesn't mean Heston's performances have always been
successful: I didn't believe but a minute or two of his Moses, no matter
what vulgarian DeMille declared about the hunt for elusive facts. But
Heston's inadvertently funny; how could he not be opposite Anne Baxter's
camp-tramp Nefertiri? While not playing a known figure as Judah, his
Oscar-winning performance was based on novelist Lew Wallace's suggestion
of what Jewish royalty might have been like during the time of Roman rule
over Judea. In retrospect, BEN-HUR is a spectacle of stereotype and hate:
all the Romans look and act like primped-up pansies. Not unintentional:
Gore Vidal, who did some of the re-writing of the script, changed the
psychology of the friendship between Ben-Hur and Stephen Boyd's evil
Messala to a revenge on unrequited lust -- without Heston's acknowledge.
The question of the House of Hur's Jewish faith also gets cloudy: will
Judah, his mother and sister convert as Christers after the climatic cure
of leprosy? (They do in the novel.) The best thing about 55 DAYS AT
PEKING, in which Heston's under-ultilized as an American marine battling
the Boxer Rebellion, is that Peking-Imperial City set. The Roman Forum was
being built for ROMAN EMPIRE when Heston signed on to do PEKING, so
Bronston had his standing army of carpenters re-construct the forum into
the Chinese city. God only knows what kind of pressure Heston exerted on
Sir Carol Reed to avoid playing Michelangelo as a homosexual in THE AGONY
AND THE ECSTASY, and though there were many other things wrong with the
epic -- like the mini-documentary which opens it and avoids giving us a
full frontal of David -- Heston's reticence to record the great master as
he was is its major failing. Was the closely cropped beard the only hint
at inclination Heston would permit? Did he not see that the Sistine Chapel
is wrought with religio-homoeroticism? He insinuates with one daring
pre-Freud, pre-genetic line, "God crippled me." As John the Baptist in THE
GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD, Heston not only once again looked the part, he
bellowed it out with great gusto. KHARTOUM, about the British general
Charles Gordon, played by Heston, who must defend the city against the
fanatic Arab Mahdi, performed in a left-over-tan-from-OTHELLO by Laurence
Olivier, was epic short on length and viewers. Audiences were by 1966
suspicious of, if not burnt out on roadshows. And this one's got a musical
score that would otherwise be litigious: composer Frank Cordel steals from
SPARTACUS, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, CLEOPATRA, even from THE AMERICANIZATION OF
EMILY. Heston's not at all bad in his accent, and he's terrifically
appealing in receding grayish hair and those formal duds -- particularly
his gold-on-black dress uniform. Yet once again his refusal to play out
the historical facts -- Gordon was gay, and probably more neurotic and
blood thirsty than T.E. Lawrence -- stunts the characterization.
(Beginning to see a phony "family values" pattern?) Judging from the
reviews of his stage appearances as Sir Thomas More in A MAN FOR ALL
SEASONS, he was persuasive as the myopic numskull stuck on God's mandates.
But then Heston made the fatal mistake of directing himself in a
TNT-production. What a complete shambles it is. The house of cards
playwright Robert Bolt built collapses; there's no distinction between the
reasonable assumption of moral laws and Heston's politics. As if
comeuppance, he becomes a man of no season. </P>
<P>        EL CID is the movie most of Heston's fans and many lovers of epics
have enthusiastically embraced. For good reason: he's at his most
chivalrous. In this present age of misogyny, watching his Cid refuse to be
vanquished by or turn ugly over his love's avenging duty is reassuring;
it's meant to be noble, and honorable, and it's both, but it's also
something of a resurrection of sexual chemistry: the Cid's and Chimene's
loin lust will not be tamed. Under Mann's direction and the marvellous
lighting by cinematographer Robert Krasker, much of this hormonal alchemy
is transmuted through framed posing; and it is in the barn, minutes before
intermission, that they are finally relieved of their prolonged
pentupness. It's the the healthiest sequence in the entire movie, with
Loren at her most relaxed. Smart observers, and readers of Heston's book,
will also note that there's a discernible tension between the two stars
during most of the first half. If Heston's account is to be trusted, it
came about because "All in all, the most trying time with an actress I can
ever recall. Mind you, (Loren) is not a bitch...just more star than pro."
In turn, Loren says not a word about Heston in her own book, and she's not
the only actress to pointedly ignore him: Ava Gardner chose the silent
routine in her bio. But watching Loren opposite Mr. Clean makes you
believe her intuition early on picked up the need to create some friction
because without it, their characters wouldn't spark. Mr. Clean wouldn't
admit it, but Loren's gambit helps him enormously; this is his only
performance in any of his epics in which the audience senses that he isn't
more in love with his enemies or horses than with his leading ladies.</P>
<P>        The Cid's other highly attractive virtue is his selfless
righteousness. For example, it's fact that when he recaptured Valenica
from the Emirs, he did not accept the crown of the city, as was demanded
by his followers, but instead, in order to unite Spain against the
invaders, took it in the name of King Alfonso, who had previously banished
him into exile because he publicly humiliated the King into swearing that
he had no part in the (real) assassination of his brother Sancho. Yet
here's where the movie and what's known about the royal family gets
factually shaky: when Ferdinand died, he willed that his empire be divided
into three parts for his sons, Sancho, Alfonso and Garcia. In the movie,
he wills to Sancho, Alfonso and daughter Dona Urraca, and never once is
Garcia's name uttered. History records no will to a daughter. The script
changed Garcia (who was in fact killed in a power grab by Alfonso) to
Urraca for dramatic tension, and it is at her feet that Sancho's death
lay. The writers, Philip Yordan and Fredric M. Frank, a pseudonym for
blacklisted Ben Barzman, who also worked on THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and THE
FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, spiced her up by suggesting that she had the
incestuous hots for Alfonso, and may have had a thing for the Cid as well.
(Historians interested in the private lives of these figures report the
Cid was the most handsome man of his time, and that by the age of 20 he
was already knighted, and that Chimene was a cousin to the royal family.)
As Urraca, French actress Genevieve Page, looking like an embittered Elke
Sommer, does what she can to insinuate the sinister (her clipped English
helps), but, though this movie has been "fully restored," there's either
reluctance on Mann and the writers's parts to dive deeper into her or that
scenes were cut. This happens to Frank Thring too: though his brief
moments are comic relief -- he's like the Australian version of Jay
Robinson -- surely there should be more to him than what we get. (Still
short of tongue, looking grotesquely rotund with his bald head and chin
down to there, Thring played The Collector in MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME.)
The legend of the Cid as incorruptible probably isn't quite true, either:
he was a soldier of fortune-opportunist who fought on the sides of both
Christians and Moslems, and was richly rewarded. Only when the North
African Emirs threatened to overtake Spain did he see his heroic duty of
uniting Spain. Though the movie emblemizes the oft-repeated legend of
Rodrigo -- that he fell as a result of a battle-inflicted wound and rode
off into history strapped, dead but open-eyed, on a white horse --
historians record that he actually died four years after defeating the
Emirs in Valenica. His death at 49 is said by biographers to have been
brought on by grief and shame over the huge numbers of casualties it took
to do so. The Cid is buried at the cathedral in Burgos.</P>
<P>        If Elizabeth Taylor is contemporary, out of her vocal element as
the Queen of the Nile or Shakespeare's Katharina, Sophia Loren seems much
at home in antiquity; her stressed, emphatic English befits the colloquial
language of epics. Like Heston, it's her size and voice -- they emit a
transitory authority. It's only when we think about some of what she says
do we have misgivings: "Moors? You let Moors live?" (Every once in a while
she sounds like Gina Lollobrigida in Vidor's SOLOMON AND SHEBA.) She looks
gorgeous in costume: perhaps her best is the emerald green cote-hardie
over a white bliaut with embroidered amoeba-like leaves, topped with a
starched lifted collar, that she wears at the wedding banquet. (The
richest-looking wardrobe, however, belongs to Douglas Wilmer as brown
liquid-eyed Lord Moutamin.) And only on the big screen can we appreciate
her swaying hips as she, dressed in mournful black, struts through the
King's Court. Heston, once more, bitched that Loren refused to allow
herself to age, noting that the movie's time span covers more than twenty
years. Covering the criticize, Raf Vallone says to her, "Even all these
months in the dungeon have not marred your beauty." But she was smart to
resist the makeup effects: she's not there for anything other than her
desirable ornamentation. Borrowing from Helen of Troy, Loren's is a face
that launches a thousand men against the King-captor. </P>
<P>        "Script, acting, images and music all act in perfect harmony,"
writes British author Derek Elley in THE EPIC FILM. Not exactly; the
script's cliches aren't fully saved by the cast's efforts because too
often the cliches are central to the movie's problems of conventionality.
There's one glaringly hokey sequence that somehow Heston, who fought with
Mann regularly, didn't consider worthy of fighting against: when the Cid,
in exile, comes across a leper named Lazarus. A genuflection to BEN-HUR,
it's appalling, and made even more so when up pops Chimene, who decides
she must support her stripped-of-wealth, sexually deprived husband. You
have to ask: how did she get to the locale as quickly as the Cid without
him knowing it? And sometimes the acting isn't as large-scale as it is
anxious, over-wrought. But the right god and goddess are in awfully fine
harmony with the imagery, music and sound effects. Miklos Rozsa's orgasmic
score, notes Elley, was originally written to cover almost 100% of the
film, but Mann discovered in Verna Fields (who would do the film editing
for BONNIE AND CLYDE and JAWS) a gifted sound technician: her matchless
ear for a slap with a glove, for dueling swords, galloping horses,
convinced Mann to eliminate over an hour of music. What survives is more
than enough. Rozsa, who won an Oscar for BEN-HUR and died in 1995, went to
Madrid to research with Nobel Prize-winning historian Dr. Ramon Menendez
Pidal, who introduced the composer to the 12th Century cantigas of Santa
Maria and the 13th Century cantigas of Alfonso X, which were inspired by
Phrygian culture. The score's most likely at its loving zenith, and its
simplest, when the Cid returns to the convent to meet, for the first time,
his twin daughters, and when Chimene puts her hand to his scar. Excluding
script convention, the movie's most troublesome element is in the actual
sound recordings: in Heston's diary, he reported that as much as seventy
percent of the soundtrack would have to be redone, "something to do with
inconsistent Spanish current." What's amazing is that, in spite of the
echo of hollowness -- the lack of integrity that results from looping --
the results aren't harmful, as they definitely are in BARABBAS, probably
because of the decision to noisy up the soundtrack with stereophonic
blasts of Rozsa's frenzied score and the sound effects. Film editor Robert
Lawrence has one remarkable feat: during the joust for Calahorra, he not
only has to avoid showing the double used when a sword is swinging away at
the Cid's saddle, he also has to splice in Loren's reaction shots, which
were filmed weeks before. (You can tell: the lighting & wind effects in
the King's grand stand don't quite match the actual outdoor shots.) But
the binding used to wrap it all up is Robert Krasker's painstaking
photography, much of which could pass for paintings. The restoration
returns glorious moments like the first scene of the Cid and Chimene
together in the rotunda -- wherein the stars perform the greatest non-kiss
in movie history; the Cid, underneath the spiral staircase, bracing
himself against the very sword he used to kill Chimene's father; Chimene
sitting in her bed chamber on her wedding night; Ferdinand's
lying-in-state; the opening shot in the barn; the night scenes of Ben
Yussuf's's men riding their horses towards Valenica (the movie makers used
Peniscola) and his infantry banging its drums. There's not a single shot
in BEN-HUR that equals them. In retrospect, given that BEN-HUR remains the
most Oscar-awarded epic so far, the sentiment may come to be that EL CID
is the most egregiously neglected epic by the Academy. But thanks, Marty,
for returning to us foofs the gold we've long waited for.</P>
