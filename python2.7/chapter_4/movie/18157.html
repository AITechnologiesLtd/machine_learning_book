<PRE>Living Out Loud</PRE>
<PRE>[3.0/4.0]</PRE>
<P>It is possible to be surrounded by people and yet still be alone. That is
what happens to Judith (Holly Hunter). Since divorcing her unfaithful
husband, she is isolated in her New York high rise apartment. Her usual
social group was shared by her ex-husband, and because of that link, she
avoids contact with those people. The only outside activity she engages in
is attending a nightclub to hear her favorite Jazz singer, Liz Baily (Queen
Latifah). Judith's divorce has been devastating, but it also offers her a
new beginning. Whereas she had been putting all of her energy into her
troubled marriage, she now can focus solely on herself. She even thinks
about pursuing the medical career that she had abandonded for her husband.
However, she is mostly lost and unsure of where she is and where she is
headed.</P>
<P>The doorman in her Judith's building, Pat (Danny DeVito), is also a kindred
spirit. His adolescent daughter has just died from cancer, and he has been
long since estranged from his wife. She threw him out because of his
restlessness. He has racked up large gambling debts, and he does not settle
into a meaningful job (like working for his brother who inherited a bar)
because he feels he destined for bigger things. He is also blindly groping
his way through a lonely life.</P>
<P>The film is about the two characters, and their relationship with each
other. He is attracted to her, but obviously she will not initially be
attracted to the older, short, balding, rotund man. If this were a
stereotypical story, the focus of the film would be about how the underdog
fights to win the romantic attention of the object of his affection.
However, this is an intelligent drama with much more depth. (Their
relationship has similarities to that of Esmeralda and Quasimodo, from "The
Hunchback of Notre Dame".) Although it is not completely successful in
drawing a total coherent picture, it is engaging and avoids predictability.</P>
<P>DeVito gives a typically superb performance as the confident but vulnerable
Pat. Although the character of Liz Bailey is underwritten and could have
been better utilized, Queen Latifah does a commendable job with the role.
Hunter has a difficult job in playing such a nuanced character. Judith is at
different times devastated, terrified, emboldened, and introspective.
Although the scripted evolution of the character is sometimes awkward,
Hunter is able to keep the character believable.</P>
<P>The film has its share of flaws. Judith's furtive attempt at a new romance
is rather nonsensical. Her friendship with Liz seems improbable. Pat's
suggested background does not match the character represented on screen.
That is, it is not understandable why his wife would have thrown him out.
Judith's husband is unilaterally sinister, but fortunately has minimal
screen time. Also, the epilogue is superfluous because it presents the
characters in exactly the state in which the viewer would have guessed. The
film utilizes an interesting technique of presenting Judith's mental
projections against her reality, so that the viewer can contrast she how
dreams her life to be and how she actually lives it, but this is initially
overused and then abruptly abandoned.</P>
<P>Despite its problems, the story is still enjoyable. Judith undergoes a
rebirth and she reclaims her independence, and the transformance is
realistically achieved in small steps. There are no melodramatic climaxes or
twists that try to overstate the problems and solutions of the characters.
The story always remains subdued and focused.</P>
<P>Recommended. Although it cannot seamlessly join the different parts into a
fully coherent result, the film laudably attempts to avoid formulas and
present an intelligent examination of kindred spirits.</P>
