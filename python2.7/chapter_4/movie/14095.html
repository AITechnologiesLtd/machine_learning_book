<P>MTV, for quite some time, has been a component of entertainment media
that has almost subconsciously defined an entire generation of children.
Anyone too young to be considered a Gen-Xer and/or born post-1979 has
most likely, in some way, been influenced by those three letters. As of
late, though, MTV has come to symbolize the lack of direction its
namesake generation is famous for. Originally formed simply for the
purpose of playing music videos, standard programming now is a curious
mixture of pop-culture-isms and lackluster talk shows. Similar to the
pseudo-network, MTV movies are almost never complete or viable examples
of cinema. Their latest is no exception. </P>
<P>On the positive side, DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS is the best feature to come out
of that certain studio yet, and with a bit of work, MTV might get its
act together. Note carefully that "best yet" isn't high praise when
considering the past features that MTV has sponsored: JOE'S APARTMENT
and BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA. Similar to DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS,
these films are a strictly limited-audience fare. Unlike this summer's
other offbeat comedy, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, however, DEAD MAN
does not have a strong fan base to work with. Its audience will be made
up of those who do not have the intelligence to appreciate smarter
comedy, and even those will surely see limited appeal. </P>
<P>The star of the show here is Tom Everett Scott, who plays Josh. Josh is
a likeable guy, attending Daleman College on a scholarship to their
six-year medical program. His intentions are honest until he meets up
with his roommate, Cooper (Mark-Paul Gosselaar). Cooper is a rich-kid
slacker who'll have nothing to do with going to class and everything to
do with getting high and getting laid. Through Cooper's antics, Josh
becomes distracted from his studies and eventually falls off his
"track." Then Cooper's dad shows up, and informs him that if Coop
doesn't get some higher grades, he'll have to come work for his old man
in the toilet-cleaning business. So Cooper and Josh happen upon an old
statute in the Daleman College handbook which says that if your roommate
commits suicide, you get straight-A's for your grief. Thus they set out
to find an appropriately depressed student to move into their room and
off himself before the end of the term. </P>
<P>Tom Everett Scott, of AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS, does the best job
here, but that could be because he's got the most big screen experience
of the three principals. He's done fine work in most pictures he's been
in - even if the movies themselves weren't that great - and will most
likely mature to something even better. Poppy Montgomery also is
appropriately sexy here, but she plays Josh's terminally normal
girlfriend Rachel; one often wonders how someone so normal got into a
movie with weirdos Scott and Gosselaar. The humor that resounds from
their university escapades, as well, is decidedly sexual in nature and
not very smart. There's not much outright laughter and so what was an
interesting preview turned out to be a botched feature. Think twice
before seeing this one.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS": 2.0 stars - a fair movie.</P>
