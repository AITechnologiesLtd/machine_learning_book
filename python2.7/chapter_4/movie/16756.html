<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</P>
<P>When gambling isn't used to illustrate amazing streaks of luck, it is
often used in association with society's criminals and lowlifes.    Well
there are plenty of criminals and lowlifes in Rounders, a film that is
careful to keep its priorities in the right order.  Card games and risky
bets take the spotlight, but the harsh game of surviving in a world full
of crooks always seems significantly more important.  When players take
to the table in the desperate hope of winning some serious dough,
Rounders provides great entertainment.  Away from the table, however, a
compelling dramatic core is missing.</P>
<P>Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) learns the valuable lessons of playing
high-stake card games the hard way.  One night he plays against Russian
card shark KGB (John Malkovich, in a role that seems a little too easy
for him) and loses a cool thirty grand.  So from then on, Mike works
hard in legitimate jobs, swearing that he will never return to the
gambling table again.  But when his loser best friend Worm (Edward
Norton) is released from jail, Mike is dragged into the game once again
in order to help Worm repay his debts.</P>
<P>One refreshing aspect of Rounders is that it treats its subject matter
with respect.  Not endorsing gambling yet not discouraging it either,
the film chronicles a realistic (though somewhat sensational) account of
two men's triumphs and misfortunes.  It not only examines gambling as a
hobby and a sport, but as a way of life - as a source for putting bread
on the table.  John Turturro is given the difficult task of portraying
the only sensible gambler, a man who "grinds" the game by playing smart
and playing safe.  Turturro has a knack for taking simple characters and
giving them complexity (Exhibit A, Barton Fink, Exhibit B, Quiz Show),
and serves as an integral (although small) part in Rounders.  As Mike
and Worm welcome the chaos that eventually engulfs them, Turturro's
character stands strong and tall, silently knowing that although he has
taken a smaller spotlight, he has outplayed both of them.</P>
<P>Matt Damon is solid in the lead role but is overshadowed by some
terrific performances from the supporting cast.  Norton plays Worm with
sleaziness and extravagance, but also brings an eerie sense of
repression and sadness.  Malkovich and Turturro are excellent, and
Gretchen Mole (playing Mike's girlfriend Jo) is also fine, although
debut scriptwriters David Levien and Brian Koppelman have written her
part predictably and blandly.</P>
<P>Director John Dahl has an obvious fascination with professional
gambling.  On numerous occasions Rounders feels like a fun documentary
on the sport, with human diversions along the way. It is then
disappointing that Dahl rarely gives his gambling scenes more than just
visual interest.  As Matt Damon says during the film, the game is not
about playing the cards, its about playing the people. Dahl shoots card
scenes much better than he examines characters.</P>
<P>The success of the drama between Mike and Worm is off and on, whilst
Mike's relationship with Jo is purely a tool to get a female actor into
the picture.   The writing and direction of Rounders is impressive, but
the sports side of the picture is so much better than its dramatic side
that the film becomes unbalanced in the quality of its scenes.  Whilst
Rounders occasionally touches on themes with meaning and relevance, this
is ultimately just a good and enjoyable sports film.  Had it focused a
little more on the players, it may have been great one.</P>
