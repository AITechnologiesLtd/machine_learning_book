<P>"The Negotiator" is one of those films where you can virtually see the 
gears turning in the writers' heads. Having come up with a nifty concept -
- what if two top-notch hostage negotiators faced off against one another 
--  the writers must figure out how to get the characters into their 
proper places, and that's where the film suffers. Plot contrivances, 
overly abrupt attitude changes and awkwardly grafted-on action sequences 
keep this thriller from hitting the bull's eye, although it still 
entertains despite the problem areas.</P>
<P>Shrewd casting helps. Two of the finest actors working today, Samuel L. 
Jackson and Kevin Spacey are masters of intensity. Jackson's specialty is 
creating fiercely intelligent characters with a love of language, while 
Spacey takes a more low-key approach, focusing on droll, erudite types 
who mask their humanity with layers of finely-honed cynicism. What a 
treat to watch them interact in the same film.</P>
<P>Combining elements of "The Fugitive" and "Die Hard," "The Negotiator" 
deals with a very good man in a very bad situation. Danny Roman (Jackson) 
is one of Chicago's best hostage negotiators and a bit of a show-boater. 
After a tense, well-staged opening scene, where he risks his life to 
rescue a little girl held captive by her deranged father, Roman promises 
his recent bride that he'll stop taking such extreme chances and start 
coming home every night for dinner. As any seasoned moviegoer knows, cops 
making statements like that are just begging for trouble.</P>
<P>Sure enough, trouble finds him when his partner, ready to spill the beans 
about departmental embezzlement of retirement funds, is murdered and 
Roman becomes the prime suspect. The film hits an awkward spot here, as 
the department turns against the heroic cop almost instantly. While the 
move is handy for the plot, it just doesn't wash. As a number of real-
life police situations have shown, officers are generally given the 
benefit of doubt within the department even when their misdeeds are 
witnessed by many. The idea that Roman's fellow officers, knowing what 
kind of man he is, would turn against him based solely on shaky 
circumstantial evidence is patently unbelievable.</P>
<P>Realizing that his life is about to be destroyed by a lazy plot device, 
Roman makes a desperate move, taking hostages in the 20th floor Internal 
Affairs office. As a "Dog Day Afternoon" street scene develops, Roman 
insists he'll only speak with Chris Sabian (Spacey), another top hostage 
negotiator from a different precinct. Roman's logic is clear. Since any 
of the officers he knows could be involved in the embezzlement scheme and 
murder, the only chance he has of getting to the truth is by dealing with 
an outsider. But can he get Sabian to believe him and become an ally 
instead of an adversary?</P>
<P>"The Negotiator" works best during its middle section, as the mind-games 
between Roman, Sabian and the rest of the force are in full flower. 
Jackson gets the lion's share of the good scenes, tersely explaining 
Hostage Negotiation 101 to a patrolman trying to talk him down, and 
making Internal Affairs Inspector Niebaum (the late J.T. Walsh) sweat as 
he interrogates him while explaining how he can tell whether or not a man 
is lying simply by observing his eye movements.</P>
<P>Spacey has a ball as the tightly-wound Sabian, attempting to maintain a 
modicum of cool while trying to outthink both Roman and a lot of trigger-
happy cops. Spacey's dark eyes radiate a keen intellect that enhances the 
palpable tension propelling the story. </P>
<P>As entertaining as Jackson and Spacey are, their characters would have 
been more involving had they been given some shading. Each actor 
establishes a tone for his character and essentially stays there for the 
entire film. Roman and Sabian are dynamic, but they seem defined solely 
by the film's extreme situation. Some insight on how these men became the 
way they are would have helped broaden the characters.</P>
<P>Two of the supporting hostages make a strong impression. The always 
entertaining Paul Giamatti is a hoot playing a snitch with a fatalistic 
loosey-goosey attitude, and Siobahn Fallon, the peculiar farm wife from 
"Men in Black," is fascinating as a secretary whose loyalties are 
maddeningly uncertain.</P>
<P>Of course, when dealing with a high-concept storyline, you have to figure 
out how to resolve the situation, and "The Negotiator" falters in this 
department, with plot contrivances and standard-issue action scenes 
diminishing the tension so carefully established before. Some major 
revelations are telegraphed earlier in the film, making the big surprises 
not all that surprising.</P>
<P>Despite its flaws, "The Negotiator" succeeds more than it fails, 
maintaining a satisfying level of tension for most of the film and 
providing a strong showcase for the contrasting acting styles of Jackson 
and Spacey. Had the filmmakers been as careful with the script as they 
were with the casting, this could have been a real beaut.</P>
