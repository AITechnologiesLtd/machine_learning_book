<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>It's Jackie Chan. You either love him or you hate him. Personally, I love
him. After all, it's this same taste for Jackie Chan as you have for any
kung fu movie, seen chiefly by comic book fans and social misfits, in which
reality is thrown out the window like a ticking bomb that explodes the
moment it has left and the debris that flies in is a brand of dark slapstick
comedy. In other words, he makes people getting beat up look funny.</P>
<P>When you pair him with someone like Chris Tucker, you come up with a bizarre
chemistry seen only once before, when Nick Nolte met with Eddie Murphy for
48 Hours. It just doesn't happen too often that two people can work together
so well on screen. That the both of them can muster enough wit to make
things work.</P>
<P>I suppose you could say it's an east-meets-west story, with a backdrop of
guns and Hong Kong crime family. A few shots here, some street humor there,
some slapstick there. The scenes just make you laugh, chuckle, or smile your
way through the movie until the nice payoff of seeing the mistakes at the
very end DO NOT LEAVE WHEN THE CREDITS START. Those alone… Those alone make
the movie worth watching. Of course the rest is just as good, but everybody
has their cup of tea.</P>
