<P>   When you come down to it, "The Next Best Thing" looks at
first like a glorified, big-screen soap.  Custody battles are the
warp and woof of daytime TV dramas.  But there's a dollop of
originality to John Schlesinger's take on the issue and Tom
Ropelewski's screenplay avoids most of the cliches and
predictable dialogue that you might find on Channel 7 on a
rainy weekday at tea time.  What "The Next Best Thing"
really has going for it that you won't find anywhere on the
tube is some darn credible and compelling acting, featuring
genuine chemistry between Madonna, one of the most talked-
about figures in Hollywood, and Rupert Everett, who is in real
life an out-of-closet homosexual and one who cannot do
wrong in any movie that casts him.</P>
<P>   Productions with gay themes that are essentially divided
into two halves--the first comic, the second tragic--are not
new.  They've been around at least since Mart Crowley
penned the wonderful play "The Boys in the Band"--in which
a man's roommate confesses his love not to the man he was
expected to, but rather to the roommate's wife.  While the
power of that play is the way it peels away its characters'
pretensions, the energy of "The Next Best Thing" is evoked
by the great love its principal gay character has for the child
he believes he has fathered.  </P>
<P>   A pivotal aspect of the movie is that while the opening half
hour is filled with ordinary, feather-light comedy, pratfalls and
the like, one is pleasantly surprised when the buffoonery
turns serious and the performers (particularly Everett) are
given their heads to evoke audience empathy.  Abbie
(Madonna) opens the tale as she is being dumped by her
boyfriend, Kevin (Michael Vartan) who--considering her warm
personality and shapely form makes Kevin a harebrained 
gentleman indeed.  Luckily for Abbey she has an
understanding gay pal, Robert (Rupert Everett), a terrific
shoulder to lean on.  When Robert--who is housesitting for a
rich, aging gay couple--enjoys some drinks with Abbie and
they go into a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers act in the spacious
living room of the house, they somehow end up together in
bed.  Nine months following, a baby arrives.  The
unconventional couple live together for five years, with
Robert's connection to young Sam (Malcolm Stumpf) a loving
one indeed, until complications arrive.  Abbie begins dating a
rich and handsome investment banker, Ben (Benjamin Bratt),
and as Ben and Abbie's thoughts turn to the prospect of
marriage and a permanent move 3,000 miles from the home
shared by Abbie, Robert, and Sam, the earnest drama kicks
in and continues relentlessly until the final resolution of the
story.</P>
<P>   Compelling though the second half is, director Schlesinger
errs on the side of soap opera conventions by
melodramatically turning Abbie's fiance and Abbie herself into
villains who, about to frustrate Robert's natural desire to see
Sam with some regularity force the poor man to take a
desperate legal action against them.  Nor can Schlesinger
resist a final, melodramatic flourish during the custody
hearing involving a knight in shining armor bursting
breathlessly on the scene.  </P>
<P>   Though some of the initial, comic half is of the cookie-
cutter type--gay friends fooling about during the funeral of
one of their own and ridiculing the pomp and circumstance of
the proceedings--one comedic scene is a winner, involving
Robert's entry to Kevin's recording studio in full gay attire
allowing the rap group in attendance to assume that Kevin
was Robert's gay boy friend.  In short, a story which (absent
the unusual nature of Robert and Abbie's household) is
conventional but is redeemed by some of the finest acting
this year so far--matching even the performances of Michael
Douglas and Tobey Maguire in "The Wonder Boys."</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 107 minutes.  (C) 2000
