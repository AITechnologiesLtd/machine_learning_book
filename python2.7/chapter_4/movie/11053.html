<P> Seen February 15, 1998 on home video (borrowed from Chris Wessell).</P>
<P>        When it comes to modern gangster movies, it's really difficult to describe
 and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or
 just using the word "routine." I've always subscribed to the philosophy that
 any idea (no matter how many times it's been used before) can provide for a
 good story and "Donnie Brasco" clinches this idea. It's not unlike most of the
 great films of the genre, yet it never apes another's style as it has a good
 layer of authenticity, even if its core is a tad stale.</P>
<P>        The film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of New York
 City in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it. We meet Lefty
 (Pacino), an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk. He
 and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime
 films like this. Somehow he comes across Donnie Brasco (Depp), a younger guy
 with a lot of spunk who isn't afraid of Lefty and his rep, and even manages to
 befriend him after Lefty was ready to kill him. It's clear Donnie is new to
 the life and Lefty recognizes this immediately, telling him all the tricks of
 the trade. I have never seen this technique of actually revealing the Mafioso
 idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit. However, we
 soon realize Donnie is actually Joe Pistone, an FBI agent working undercover -
 a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the
 lifestyle and treated as a newcomer.</P>
<P>        The first act works as a guided to
ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor, a brief history of the mob,
 definitions of their slang, and where their money comes from and who it goes
 to. The screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these
 elements, however, the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original. Most
 gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how
 the mob works (probably from watching other gangster movies), and although
 this attitude comes across, the film tries to fill in all the holes where and
 when it can and the effort is appreciable.</P>
<P>        Thankfully the film doesn't become too caught up in the tedious details of
 organized crime, and instead opts for character development. Much of the story
 is told simply through the interaction between Lefty and Donnie. Pacino is
 outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner
 any blue collar worker would. He's old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what
 he does, just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be.
 We learn of his accomplishments, which are quite impressive within their
 context, and when he complains about not being made top boss, it's easy to
 sympathize with him. Newell constantly plays up this aspect, making it a major
 theme which works well in the long run. As Donnie is constantly impressing and
 even one-upping Lefty, it's hard to tell which emotion is more powerful: the
 fact Donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob; or the fact Lefty has once
 again been over shadowed.</P>
<P>        Most of the film tells the story of Donnie's life in Mafia, which creates for
 many sub-plots and individual conflicts, but doesn't always seem to come
 together as a whole. The storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout,
 even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar. The resonance
 to Donnie's actual assignment varies, he often reports back to the Feds with
 detail of his progress, but it doesn't always seem to have much meaning. Back
 home, his wife Maggie (Heche) is ready to divorce him because he's never
 a
 and the family is suffering. Since this is based on a true story I
 wouldn't doubt this would happen, although the way it is handled often borders
 on the melodramatic.</P>
<P>        My only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act, or at least
 any real sense of closure. A climax of sorts does occur, but there's little
 feeling of a payoff. We get a happy ending, which is good, but perhaps a sad
 ending would have been more powerful.        </P>
<P>        Aside from a few minor, general flaws, "Donnie Brasco" manages to be a solid
 piece of storytelling and character development. It may be routine, but it's
 good, and that's respectful.</P>
