                     THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD 1995
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Hal Scardino, Litefoot, Lindsay Crouse, Richard Jenkins, Rishi
Bhat, David Keith Director: Frank Oz Screenplay: Melissa Mathison based
on the book by Lynne Reid Banks</P>
<P>When a kid with not so perfect teeth locks a toy Indian in his magical
cupboard, WELLA we have a walking, talking, child bearing, lactating
Indian Squaw. No that's not right. How about a turban wearing, pipe
smoking, Indian snake charmer? Nope. What we have is a genuine
hunter-gathering, soul searching Iroquois Indian, who is a widower.</P>
<P>On his birthday, a nine year old boy (Scardino) receives two presents of
note. A toy cupboard (ten by five inches), and a plastic Iroquois Indian
(two by three centimetres). Any one who can't add, like myself, will
know that the Indian if divided by three, to the square root of two,
will fit nicely into the toy cupboard; and too my surprise, and
everybody elses, like a chemistry experiment where lead becomes gold,
the toy Indian when placed in the cupboard comes alive (flesh and blood,
but real small).</P>
<P>Wow, Ooooh, it's magical. For anybody who is wandering whether this also
works on toy T-Rexes, Darth Vader dolls, monopoly money etc. Yep, it
sure does, as long as it can fit inside that magical cupboard. We have
all played with toy soldiers, cars, and planes as children. Remember Ken
and Barbie, well I liked ripping Barbie's head off. So let's stick her
in the cupboard and we have for ourselves a walking headless
Barbie... now that's food for thought!</P>
<P>Besides being a relatively entertaining children's movie, where the
imagination gets a little carried away (I mean really where did the
cupboard come from, the 'Twilight Zone'?). This movie does deal with
important issues where the child grasps the concept of the
responsibility for human life. The child becomes the parent, for his
living, talking little Indian, and by the end of the movie realises that
he cannot toy with the life of another for his own selfish pleasure. So
if you want a pet, get a puppy, they don't talk back, and they sure
don't shoot arrows at you when unhappy.</P>
<P>So kids, jump into bed with mom and dad, and watch the 'Cowboys and
Indians' at play. Don't click your heels three times and wish you were
in Kansas, and don't say 'Open Sesame' or 'Abracadabra', or you may end
up with 'Dorothy and the Forty Thieves'. If it's Indians you want,
remember to turn the key to the cupboard clockwise, then anticlockwise;
but don't do it too often or you'll scare your little Iroquois Indian to
death.</P>
<P>Indian Feel Scale:
0% Pocahontas / *THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD* / Dances With Wolves 100%</P>
