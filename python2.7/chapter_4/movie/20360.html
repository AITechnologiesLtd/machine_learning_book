<PRE>`Chill Factor' – Lukewarm Entertainment
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>The summer season for movies is fast approaching an end.  As I think
back about the summer offerings, there has been a dearth of the
standard shoot-em and chase-em movies compared to last year.  There
were a fair share of comedies, a handful of mature dramas, and a
stunning showing for scary films.  But where were the standard staples
of summer?  The prototypical action flick was probably rarer this year
because studios finally figured out that audiences are craving for
movies that titillate the senses or tickle the funny bone.  Gratefully,
the standard shoot-em up fare is moving towards extinction.  Perhaps
these films will find their future as straight-to-video releases. 
Although `Chill Factor' is probably as competent as any other summery
action film, this is also a film that you'll probably see at your
neighborhood Blockbuster's within eight weeks.</P>
<P>In this film, the U.S. government has been secretly testing a chemical
weapon that can evaporate human flesh within a matter of seconds.  The
problem is that scientists have been unable to control the energy of
this chemical reaction.  The only thing that they do know is that the
chemical (which looks like blue, semi-gelatinous crystals) must be kept
cold, less than 50 degrees.  Otherwise, the chemical reaction would
start.  There's nothing as cleansing as a radioactive facial.  If an
enemy nation were able to get their hands on it, they could easily wage
a destructive war guaranteeing themselves that their enemies will all
dissolve into dust.  There's an overly elaborate set-up to introduce us
to the person that wants to steal and auction it off to the highest
bidder (in this case, a vindictive former Army officer).  With his band
of hired mercenaries, they infiltrate a top secret research facility to
make the theft.  </P>
<P>The bandits are unsuccessful, and the chemicals wind up in the hands of
two average citizens.  One is Tom (Skeet Ulrich), a brooding guy who is
overcome by a sudden wave of patriotism.  He must deliver the chemicals
to an Army base about a day's trip away.  But he must keep the
chemicals cold.  Luckily, he meets up with Arlo (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) who
just happens to be an ice cream truck driver.  Arlo has nothing better
to do with his life, and despite the fact that transporting the
chemicals means almost-certain death, he grudgingly decides to help
Tom.</P>
<P>What does sustain the film is Gooding's fun nature.  There's a certain
charm that he has when he yelps his dissatisfaction at their
deteriorating situation.  Another ongoing joke seems to be that Tom and
Arlo can only flee using very unlikely getaway vehicles, including a
beat-up ice cream truck and a UPS brown van.  But with the villain hot
on their trail, Tom and Arlo face a series of challenges in order to
stay alive.  Driving along a narrow ledge high atop a mountainside and
tobogganing down the side of a mountain are just some of their wild
getaways.  And though they face such overwhelming odds at surviving,
they still manage to buy ice along the way to keep the chemical cool. 
The movie is predictable and formulaic from beginning to end.  It has
its light moments (thanks to Gooding) and a relatively brisk pace, but
beyond that, this film is about as exciting as the Vanilla in Arlo's
ice cream truck.</P>
