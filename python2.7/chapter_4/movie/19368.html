<P>   If the French still have not faced up to criticism of their
wartime policies, it's no wonder.  Defeated twice by the
Germans--first in 1914 and then in 1940--France has been
reproached by many for its role in cooperating with the
enemy during World War 2.  The unoccupied southern portion
of the country was run by a collaborationist government from
the city of Vichy, while many French police and citizens
shamefully participated with the Nazis in the rounding up of
their Jewish citizens.  The one bright chapter in French
wartime history centers on the Resistance, an underground
force which ambushed and blew up ammunition-carrying
trains and trucks and shot German soldiers whenever they
felt they could get away with these actions.  Not surprisingly,
just after the war, the number of French who fought with the
Resistance miraculously "expanded," with collaborationists
and neutralists alike suddenly sharing the glory of the brave
people who risked their lives to free their country from the
hated occupiers.  One might expect Claude Berri, the noted
French director who is the son of Jewish immigrants, to come
down hard on those Frenchmen who helped round up Jews
for the Gestapo.  But in "Lucie Aubrac," based on a true 
story "Outwitting the Gestapo" by a heroic female Resistance
fighter whose real name was Lucie Bernard, Berri unfolds the
brave woman's struggle to free her husband from jail shortly
before he was to be executed.</P>
<P>   The film opens on its most exciting action sequence, one
that might bring to mind the blowing up of the overpass in
"The Bridge on the River Kwai."  A fictitious event in that
Aubrac's husband was not actually involved, the occurrence
adds considerable drama to a story embracing more talk than
physical action.  As a group of French Resistors work
feverishly to wire up an explosive device, Raymond Samuel,
aka Aubrac (Daniel Auteuil)--backed up by a handful of
fighters--later watches with delight as their operation succeeds in
destroying a steam train carrying ammunition to the German
forces.  Aubrac, a high-level member of the Resistance in
charge of administering a zone of operation, meets
clandestinely with his colleagues, including the leader, Jean
Moulin aka Max (Patrice Chereau).  Ultimately he is arrested
and charged with terrorism after the group are allegedly
betrayed by one of their associates, thrown into a tiny, roach-
infested cell, tortured, and sentenced to death for terrorism. 
At this point, his wife Lucie (Carole Bouquet) schemes to
save her husband by concocting a plan which would allow
him to be transported to the office of a Nazi official, thereby
allowing her colleagues in the Resistance to use violence to
free him.</P>
<P>   Claude Berri is quite familiar with the period of history he
describes.  His 1991 film "Uranus" starring Gerard Depardieu,
dealt with the struggle for power in a village among groups of
communists, anticommunists, collaborators and ex-resisters.
Here, he illustrates some military action in this two-hour
drama, but fixes primarily on the romantic scheme at the
story's heart.  That he is most concerned with machiavellian
designs of his countrymen is not unusual, considering that at
his height, he directed his most discussed film "Jean de
Florette"--about a proud French farmer who schemes with his
simple-minded nephew to acquire some nearby farmland by
making sure that the new owners discover an all-important
natural spring on the property.    </P>
<P>   A strong sentimental note attends the tale.  Lucie made
love with her husband for the first time on a May 14 and has
promised that they would be together on the anniversary of
that date for the rest of their lives.  Her insistence on keeping
to that bargain goes a way toward illuminating her strong
motivation to do everything she can to persuade German
officials to transport the man for a day from his death cell.</P>
<P>   While Daniel Auteuil turns in his usual reliable
performance, Carole Bouquet carries the day with a forceful
discharge of her valorous role.  Keeping a straight, almost
poker face throughout her negotiations with the enemy, she
shows the uniformed torturers and soldiers alike that she
means business.  We are made privy to her determination
even as we watch her teach history to her class of 10-year-
old girls, suggesting that they "don't laugh" whenever they get
the giggles as girls that age are wont to do.  Vincenzo
Marano's camera glides across Olivier Radot's production
design--a layout that not only transports us to village France
of the 1940s but actually makes us feel that we're watching
one of those old-time romantic war movies.  Though "Lucie
Aubrac" includes more than a modicum of violent action, the
overall ambiance is a sober one.  This is a deliberately paced
film with a powerful woman's role that may not knock your
socks off but will give you insight into the machinations within
an occupied area of Europe and how love--with just a trace of
honeyed sentiment--can serve as a literal life-saver.</P>
