Susan Granger's review of "MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2" (Paramount Pictures)
PERSONAL NOTE: My son, Don Granger, is the Paramount Pictures exec who super=
vised this film so if this review sounds a bit biased - so be it.</P>
<P>   As a fan of the original "Mission Impossible" TV series,
I'm delighted that this sequel returns to its roots, complete with the
intriguing, unexpected disguises and inventive gadgetry updated to the
21st century. Tom Cruise plays special agent Ethan Hunt who's
recruited from a rock-climbing vacation in Utah for a new,
globe-hopping mission by his IMF contact, Anthony Hopkins. His team
consists of a computer genius, Ving Rhames, and a beautiful thief,
Thandie Newton. Their target is a terrifyingly destructive super-flu
virus. The deadly virus and its antidote were stolen from Biocyte
Pharmaceuticals in Sydney, Australia, by a bitter, formidable
IMF-agent, Dougray Scott, who threatens to ignite a worldwide
plague. To achieve his goal, Tom must not only overcome all the
physical obstacles that Scott tosses his way but also his own
emotional turmoil when he realizes that he and Scott are both in love
with the same woman.  "That could be difficult," says Tom. "This isn't
'Mission Difficult'," retorts Hopkins. "It's 'Mission Impossible.'
Difficult should be a walk in the park!" Screenwriter Robert Towne
concocted the clever, intelligent script, while filmmaker John Woo
proves why he's the most imaginative action director working today,
combining reality with surrealism. The "acrobatic insanity" of the
incredible stunts will have your adrenaline rushing - not to mention
the firepower and explosions. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Mission Impossible 2" is an exciting, action-packed 10. It's a sleek,
stylistic adventure thriller, a fun-filled popcorn picture that will
not self-destruct.</P>
