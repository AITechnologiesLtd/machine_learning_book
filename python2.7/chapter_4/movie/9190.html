<P>     In the dusty, dry world of THE LOCUSTS -- a Midwestern American 
cattle ranch during the late 1950s -- everyone has a secret.  But, 
unlike films that live or die on the basis of unexpected plot 
disclosures, secrets are only important to THE LOCUSTS in the way they 
define the characters, explain their motivations, and drive their 
actions.  It's entirely possible to guess one (or more) of the truths 
that these men and women keep buried before those revelations are 
explicitly divulged, but such insight is unlikely to diminish your 
appreciation of this film in any significant way.  In fact, it may 
actually enhance it.</P>
<P>     THE LOCUSTS is a genuinely powerful motion picture that achieves 
its potency through character development rather than audience 
manipulation.  This approach is becoming increasingly rare in dramatic 
motion pictures, which often try too hard to generate tears, and it 
speaks highly of first time feature director John Patrick Kelly's 
ability to tell a story.  THE LOCUSTS is also successful in the way it 
manages to interweave small moments of triumph with intimate tragedies.  
This is not by any means a "feel good" motion picture (quite the 
opposite, in fact), but there are times when it touches a core of 
optimism.  </P>
<P>     THE LOCUSTS opens with a rugged stranger, Clay Hewitt (Vince 
Vaughn), entering the town of Sealy, Kansas.  He claims to be looking 
for temporary work to finance his cross-country trip to California, 
where his brother, a marine, is stationed.  Clay finds a job and a place 
to live at a local cattle ranch run by Delilah Ashford Potts (Kate 
Capshaw), who has a reputation for giving her ranch hands "a room, a 
job, and a whole lot more than [they] bargained for."  While there, Clay 
strikes up a fragile friendship with Flyboy (Jeremy Davies), Mrs. Potts' 
emotionally-damaged son.  Flyboy is known for his isolation and 
passivity -- he speaks only to a "pet" bull -- until Clay's easy manner 
and persistence encourage Flyboy to open up.  Meanwhile, Clay also 
becomes friendly with a local girl named Kitty (Ashley Judd), who is 
willing to help with his project to rebuild Flyboy's confidence and 
psyche.  But change is one thing Mrs. Potts will not tolerate, and, on 
the ranch, she wields all the power.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Kelly has chosen a strong cast to work with.  Vince 
Vaughn, who made his mark in SWINGERS before appearing in THE LOST 
WORLD, gives his strongest performance to date -- an intelligent and 
believable rendering of a man trapped by powerful emotional forces.  
Ashley Judd (currently appearing in KISS THE GIRLS), who has displayed 
amazing versatility as an actress, creates a character with a resilience 
and appeal that recalls her lead role in 1993's RUBY IN PARADISE.  Kate 
Capshaw, best known as either Mrs. Steven Spielberg or "the girl from 
the second INDIANA JONES movie", renders Mrs. Potts with the intensity 
and style of a femme fatale -- sexy, mysterious, and dangerous.  The 
most striking performance, however, belongs to Jeremy Davies (SPANKING 
THE MONKEY), whose interpretation of Flyboy is worthy of mention 
alongside that of Dustin Hoffman from RAIN MAN, Tom Hanks from FORREST 
GUMP, Billy Bob Thornton from SLING BLADE, and Geoffrey Rush from SHINE.</P>
<P>     THE LOCUSTS is as rich in themes as it is in three-dimensional 
characters.  There's atonement, redemption, revenge, and a particularly 
brutal examination of the shifting balance of power between men and 
women, and parents and children.  Clay is impelled by a need for 
salvation -- a need that is so overpowering that it blinds him to the 
potential consequences of his actions.  Flyboy is driven by a desire to 
achieve a semblance of normalcy.  Love compels Kitty, the most open 
character in the film, and the only one of the four protagonists without 
a secret.  But the one with the darkest motivation is Mrs. Potts, who 
makes no excuse for her savagery and the manner in which she abuses 
every kind of power at her disposal. </P>
<P>     The narrative for THE LOCUSTS does justice to each of these motifs 
as it gradually peels back the onion-like layers of the characters to 
reveal the complexity that lies beneath.  The film doesn't offer any 
simpleminded solutions to difficult issues, and there are two very 
different ways to interpret the ending (depending on whether you're an 
optimist or a pessimist).  THE LOCUSTS explores both extremes of the 
human experience -- the purity of innocence and the viciousness of 
cruelty -- as well as many of the ambiguous shades in between.  If 
there's one misstep in THE LOCUSTS, it's that the meaning of the title 
(which is a metaphor) is explained a little too obviously.  But that's 
an extremely minor quibble and it does little to detract from the 
strength of this film, which is one of the year's best.</P>
