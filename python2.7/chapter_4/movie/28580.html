<PRE>KISS OF THE DRAGON</PRE>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten
 20th Century Fox/ Europa Corp
 Director: Chris Nahon
 Writer:  Luc Besson, Robert Mark Kamen, story by Jet Li
 Cast: Jet Li, Bridget Fonda, Tcheky Karyo</PRE>
<P>   In one of the opening scenes of this martial arts action drama,
a Parisian makes the patronizing point to Jet Li--who had just
arrived from Beijing--that French history doesn't amount to a hill
of beans compared to the chronicles of China.   You may or may
not believe this but as you watch Jet Li in action in the role of
China's top government police agent, Liu Jian, you might easily
go along with the notion that this guy of medium height and build
could be the finished product of China's long and often glorious
record.  Liu Jian works awfully hard to make his presence felt
knocking out lights in the City of Lights and while he's China
leading maestro of martial arts, he's also skilled in the science of
magic.  When he's not literally kicking up a storm, he's doing
some awfully strange things with his acupuncture needles, which
in the picture serve as double-edged swords for both their
curative powers and their capacity to inflict suffering on the
enemy.   The ultimate magic of these needles is their ability to
deliver the kiss of the dragon, which makes its ironic, less-than-
amorous appearance at the very end of the film.</P>
<P>   The story--such as it is--opens at the customs booth at Orly
International Airport as an sinister-looking passport inspector
asks Liu  his purpose in visiting France.  When Liu answers
simply "pleasure" (because he's no way in the same class as
James Bond, who'd say, "Pleasure: is there any other?"), we can
believe that what the typical foreign tourist considers fun is not
breaking up a sinister gang of murderous criminals led by French
police Inspector Richard (Tcheky Karyo).  Liu has been sent by
his government in Beijing to assist the French police in protecting
a member of his nationality, but when that official tells the two
hookers who have been assigned to make his visit pleasant, 
"send me to heaven," he did not have in mind the same type of
travel that Richard had planned for him.  When the police
inspector turns out to be somewhat worse than Javert--a
downright killer, super-pimp and more--Liu is in for the adventure
of his life: at least until his next movie opens in a year or so.</P>
<P>   The "Kiss of the Dragon" is a violent tale involving Uzis,
flamethrowers, grenades, and of course the supernatural limbs of
its hero as well as his trusty needles.  "Kiss" involves Bridget
Fonda as well in the role of Jessica, a North Dakotan who when
asked how she wound up as a Paris streetwalker, explains to Liu
that some guy she was with spoke a beautiful French to her and,
well, that explains everything.  The movie suffers from a plot that
is more difficult to understand than the intrigue of Alain Resnais'
"Last Year at Marienbad," but no one in the audience except for
some elitist critics expects much of a storyline: we're here for the
action.  Do we get it?  Not really.  We're not sure that Liu can
easily knock out an army of twenty black belts whom he meets in
a building and who happily take him on, but Liu has the benefit of
one good friend to help him: Marco Cave, who is the most
powerful man in the movie.  Who's he?  The editor, of course,
whose assistance enables Liu not only to polish off an army of
guys in karate outfits, a pair of gigantic blond twins (Cyril Raffaelli
and Diddier Azoulay), to dodge an avenging hand grenade and a
threatening firestorm, and to outrace 157 bullets directed at him
from a variety of marksmen.  </P>
<P>   Not even Bridget Fonda comes off looking good in this generic
actioner, and director Chris Nahon must be quite an
accomplished director to realize a feat like that.  What's more
we're hard put to believe that the great Luc Besson, who gave us
the thrilling "La Femme Nikita" (which evolved in the American
"Point of No Return" starring Bridget Fonda in a far better role)
and "The Professional," which laid out the story of a hit man
(Jean Reno) made into a gentle dude while taking care of a
young orphaned girl.  But Jet Li does his best in a film that gives
him not a single line of humorous or witty dialogue and, even
harder to believe, not even arch-villain Richard--who at one point
threatens only half-heartedly to put Jessica's five-year-old
daughter to work in a Parisian Red Light district--gets to say a
single sentence to evoke an audience sneer.</P>
