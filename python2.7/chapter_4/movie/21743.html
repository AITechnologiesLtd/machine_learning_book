<P>`The Bachelor' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see.
Wading through this gooey, detestable sludge is quite the chore for even
a dedicated romantic. Those hoping to find some genuine charm and
feeling behind this Chris O'Donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere;
`The Bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few
brief moments of surprising poignancy. Awaiting these moments by
enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money.</P>
<P>Although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy
cocoon, Chris O'Donnell has an effortless charm as an actor. Most will
recognize him as the high-flying Robin from the two latest `Batman'
films, but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile. Can
O'Donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders? Perhaps, if he
found the proper vehicle... but `The Bachelor' falls far short of the
requirements. The actor just can't register with such a pathetic
screenplay as the guiding light to success. A few instances of adorable
humor aside, it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering
mess that is `The Bachelor'.</P>
<P>O'Donnell plays Jimmie, a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who's
progressing in a serious relationship with Anne (Renee Zellweger).
Jimmie takes Anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for
proposals, and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage. The problem is
that his proposal sucks. Big time. You can tell things aren't going
pleasantly, because Jimmie gets the infamous ‘deer-in-the-headlights'
look when Anne questions his approach.</P>
<P>And then, the plot (along with the stupidity of the movie) thickens.
Jimmie's grandfather (Peter Ustinov) dies suddenly, leaving a video will
behind for his grandson (who also happens to be his only living
relative). Everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is
passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to
Jimmie. Of course, there's a catch: he must get married before his 30th
birthday, stay joined with his bride for an entire decade, and produce
healthy children within the first five years. The bad news is that
Jimmie's birthday is the following day. With Anne out of town, he must
find a willing bride to share his riches with... and within a very
limited time frame.</P>
<P>There are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `The Bachelor'. For one,
the movie's approach is interesting and not dripping with cliché.
Another is the colorful cast. O'Donnell and Zellweger are cute together,
and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from
drowning in it's own mediocrity. Ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky
grandfather figure, and James Cromwell is sincere and effective as a
wise priest dragged through Jimmie's marital adventures. And now the
cons: the approach may be interesting, but in trying an old-fashioned
method, director Gary Sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel. The
characters are drawn with obvious, broad strokes, and the plot is bogged
down with everything humanly imaginable.</P>
<P>Yes, `The Bachelor' is far more frustrating than cute. The screenplay is
lamely written, and the subject matter poorly conceived. The
considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted, along with
whatever promise the film initially contained. Potential goes out the
window early to suit Sinyor's `colorful' approach, but not a minute of
this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director's wishes. `The
Bachelor' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it.</P>
<P>You've seen the TV spots, haven't you? O'Donnell is madly rushing down a
deserted street and the caption reads `What is this man running from?'
In actuality, he's fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to
marry him and inherit his fortune (it's one of the few enjoyable
sequences in the film). After seeing the movie, I believe that the
approaching horde could be something else. O'Donnell could be running
from his angry fans, who have just endured `The Bachelor', and are
hunting him down for revenge.</P>
