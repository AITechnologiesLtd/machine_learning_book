<PRE>               A film review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Albert Brooks is a successful and respected entertainer for two reasons.
One, he is a great example of the ordinary guy in just about every movie he
does which most of us can relate to and two, his writing has a biting
sensation of reality and often a radical perception of reality many refuse to
face.  'Lost in America' (1985), 'Broadcast News' (1987) and 'Defending Your
Life' (1991) are all examples of Brooks' talent both diverse and highly
entertaining.  'Defending Your Life' was a fantasy but I can picture many
people believing what the afterlife might be the same way Brooks portrayed it
in that movie.  Debbie Reynolds is 'Mother.'  Her two sons played by Albert
Brooks and Rob Morrow are respectable, hard working men but mother has
favoured her sports agent son, Morrow over Brooks who is a writer of glib
science fiction.  A wonderful wife and two kids is a great bonus for Morrow
while Brooks being twice divorced doesn't sit well with his family.  Brooks
drives from Los Angeles to San Francisco and moves back in with mother and
his reason is that it's an 'experiment' to see if he can somehow figure out
his relationship with his mother then maybe he can finally adjust to finding
the right mate and finally adjust to women in all aspects of his life.  This
movie is filled with situations that will almost certainly make a lot of men
say "Hey, I've had that experience with my mother!" or "Wow, I can't believe
how this movie details the little things that cause friction in a
relationship!"  It's a dark and humourous and pain stakingly detailed
screenplay co-written by Brooks and directed by the man himself.  Mother is
one of the most realistic slices of life I've ever seen and I related to it
better than most movies I saw in 1996 and Debbie Reynolds is terrific as the
mother who offers love, advice and compassion in an unorthodox and least
obvious way towards her sons.  Albert Brooks is a treat as always and this
gem of a movie is certain to become another buried treasure which will
probably find a huge following on home video as its theatre release has been
limited.  For everyone that's ever had a mother, don't miss this one!</P>
