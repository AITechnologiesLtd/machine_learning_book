<P>     At the core of LITTLE BUDDHA lie questions of belief.  Can you 
acknowledge reincarnation as a viable solution to what lies beyond death?  
Can you believe in the search for Cosmic Oneness as a central mystery of 
life?  And, most importantly, can you accept Keanu Reeves as the Buddha 
dude? </P>
<P>     LITTLE BUDDHA has two stories to tell.  The first follows the quest 
of a group of monks, led by Lama Norbu (Ying Ruocheng) to seek out the 
reincarnated spirit of a great Buddhist teacher, Lama Dorje.  Norbu and 
his fellows believe they have found Dorje's spirit residing within a 
Seattle boy named Jesse Conrad (Alex Wiesendanger).  While Alex is 
enchanted with the monks and their way of life, his parents, Dean (Chris 
Isaak) and Lisa (Bridget Fonda) are wary, and that wariness turns into 
near-hostility when Norbu announces that he would like to take Jesse back 
with him to Bhutan to be tested. </P>
<P>     The second tale is the fable of how a prince named Siddhartha (Keanu 
Reeves) became the great spiritual leader Buddha.  Framed within the 
modern-day portions of LITTLE BUDDHA, this segment is presented as a 
children's story told to Jesse, with the telling simple and fairytale-
like. </P>
<P>     The strength of LITTLE BUDDHA is the ideals that it presents, and 
the way it forces us to confront questions of spirituality and existence.  
Director Bernardo Bertolucci (THE LAST EMPEROR, THE SHELTERING SKY) has 
never been one to avoid probing themes, and the subject matter of LITTLE 
BUDDHA is no different.  There's a fair amount of material in this film 
to stimulate the intellect. </P>
<P>     Unfortunately, it's really just the intellect that is stimulated.  
As beautifully photographed and intelligently-written as the movie is, it 
has no emotional depth or appeal, and is often as cold and clinical as 
its gray depiction of Seattle.  Perhaps the problem is the twenty minutes 
cut from the final print (there's a sequence involving the bankruptcy and 
death of a friend of the Conrads that has been trimmed significantly).  
Or maybe it's the use of a wooden Chris Isaak in a key role.  Whatever 
the reason, however, the characters never connect with the audience, 
causing LITTLE BUDDHA to test the viewer's attention span when it should 
instead be soaring.</P>
<P>     There's also a question about LITTLE BUDDHA's intent.  At first, the 
center of the picture seems to be on young Jesse's spiritual 
enlightenment as he comes to understand the monks' way of life.  This, 
after all, is the whole point of his learning Siddhartha's story.  
However, as the film progresses, the focus wanders as Jesse's presence 
becomes less critical.  Dean's own crisis of the soul, which forms a 
minor subplot, is resolved in an oblique and unsatisfactory manner. </P>
<P>     So what about Keanu Reeves?  Choosing one of today's least able (but 
most popular) actors in such a critical role might at first seem bizarre 
(to say the least), but in a weird way, it sort of works.  This isn't 
because Reeves has suddenly learned how to act, but with his part of the 
story nestled in the cozy frame of a fable, his stilted style isn't 
harmful.  All that he needs to do is look nice - which he does - and not 
flub his lines.  His failed attempt at an Indian accent is a bit 
distracting, however.</P>
<P>     With ragged transitions and a too-long running time, the editing of 
LITTLE BUDDHA is suspect.  Considering the otherwise-impeccable 
production standards, it's odd that this portion of the project should 
have been handled so imperfectly.  Conventional wisdom indicates that if 
you're aware of something, it's a problem, and that's the case with the 
cutting and pasting in LITTLE BUDDHA.</P>
<P>     For those who can get past Keanu Reeves and Chris Isaak, and who 
don't mind viewing a film that opens an emotional gulf between itself and 
its audience, LITTLE BUDDHA has themes and images worth exploring.  And 
while no one will debate the impressiveness of cinematographer Vittorio 
Storaro's work, as far as I'm concerned, there are too many problems for 
this film to be considered more than a mediocre attempt to present a 
multi-layered spiritual and temporal picture.  </P>
