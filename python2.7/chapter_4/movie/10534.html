<P>     Call it TOUCHED BY A DEMON.  Gregory Hoblit's FALLEN is a serial 
killer movie with an unusual, horrific twist.  If marketed properly, 
this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate 
supernatural tales like THE PROPHESY and those who crave grim, dark 
thrillers like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and SEVEN.  In fact, there's even a 
little TWIN PEAKS to be found here, albeit with the lion's share of the 
weirdness distilled out.  (Remember BOB?)  The biggest failing of FALLEN 
is that, although it's consistently interesting, it's not always as edgy 
and suspenseful as one might hope.</P>
<P>     A serial killer (Elias Koteas) has been on the loose in 
Philadephia, but Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington), the noblest 
man on the police force, has brought him to justice.  Now, during his 
last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas 
chamber, the mass murderer cryptically tells Hobbes, "What goes around 
really goes around."  Shortly thereafter, he begins to sing "Time Is on 
My Side" as he's taken on his last walk.  Minutes later, the State of 
Pennsylvania has carried out the execution and Edgar Reese is dead.  But 
for Hobbes, the nightmare is just beginning, because Reese wasn't a 
normal psychopath – he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named 
Azazel. And, with Reese's death, Azazel is free to hop from body to 
body, murdering and wreaking havoc at will. Only Hobbes and a pretty, 
female theology teacher (Embeth Davidtz) have an inkling of what they're 
up against.  The rest of the cops, including Hobbes' partner, Jonesy 
(John Goodman); Lou (James Gandolfini), a newcomer to the department; 
and Lieutenant Stanton (Donald Sutherland), don't have a clue, and, as a 
result, they are in mortal danger.</P>
<P>     As depicted by Hoblit (PRIMAL FEAR) and cinematographer Newton 
Thomas Sigel, Philadelphia is a dark, dreary place – a gothic city 
rather than a modern one.  No skyscrapers or other monoliths of current 
architecture or technology are shown.  The most famous landmark to 
appear isn't the Liberty Bell or Independence Hall; it's Geno's Steaks.  
Shadows and night scenes abound.  The days are cloudy and unpromising.  
This is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen 
angels walk among men.</P>
<P>     FALLEN's plot is brimming with potential, not all of which is 
realized.  Somehow, I would have expected a more frightening tale to 
emerge from something with this kind of premise.  But the level of 
terror, like that of gore, is kept in check.  Nevertheless, there are 
several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of Azazel moves from 
body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city 
sidewalks.  The film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can 
best be described as unusual.</P>
<P>     Of the several dozen actors to play Azazel, the best is by far 
Elias Koteas (EXOTICA, CRASH), who, despite only being on screen for 
about ten minutes, gives a fantastically charged performance.  John 
Goodman also seems to be enjoying himself, although his role for most of 
the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick.  Sadly, however, 
these two are the only ones who excel.  Everyone else, including Denzel 
Washington, is boring.</P>
<P>     Washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of 
the film.  It's not that he's bad per se, but he's not very interesting.  
There's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he 
portrays his character, and that keeps us distanced, however slightly, 
from Hobbes.  As circumstances become progressively more dire for the 
cop, and as his life-or-death chess game with Azazel approaches the 
point of checkmate, I expected to be more on the edge of my seat than I 
was.  Washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this; I 
never felt a sense of urgency.</P>
<P>     However, at least Washington was believable, which is more than can 
be said for Embeth Davidtz (SCHINDLER'S LIST) and Donald Sutherland.  To 
be fair, the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related; 
neither Stanton nor Gretta Milano are well-written.  That said, however, 
there's nothing inspired about either Davidtz's or Sutherland's work.  
Both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts, as if they 
know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot 
rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual.</P>
<P>     Narratively, FALLEN has a few glaring weaknesses.  Although the 
plot proceeds with a convoluted, game-like structure, it uses a Denzel 
Washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters.  At times, this is 
actually helpful, and it has a use beyond the obvious, but there are 
occasions when ponderous lines like "I like the night… Sometimes you 
come face to face with yourself" become a little hard to swallow.  In 
addition, FALLEN is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland, 
generic theology embraced by numerous movies and TV shows like TOUCHED 
BY AN ANGEL.</P>
<P>     However, despite the negatives, I'm still recommending FALLEN on 
the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending, which I 
loved.  The final scenes are startling, audacious, and unexpected.  It's 
not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one 
did.  At a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes, 
FALLEN manages to buck the trend and redeem itself.  This is not a great 
motion picture, but, considering how bad most January releases are, it's 
a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours.  And, whatever you do, 
don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll.</P>
