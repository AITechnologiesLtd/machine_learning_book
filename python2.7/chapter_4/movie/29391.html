<PRE>SIRENS (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>The author of this review, same as any other heterosexual
male, doesn't mind seeing beautiful women in the state of
partial of complete undress. However, when such sights are
appearing in the movies, enjoyment of these particular
scenes is sometimes spoiled when it becomes obvious that
they don't make any sense apart from pleasing male audience.
Movies with non-exploitative nudity seldom appear and even
rarer are those where nudity itself becomes one of the main
elements without which the film wouldn't make any sense. One
of such examples is SIRENS, Australian comedy directed in
1994 by John Duigan.</P>
<P>The plot of the film is inspired by the incident in the
biography of Norman Lindsay (played by Sam Neill), 20th
Century Australian artist who gained controversial
reputation by challenging moral standards of the time by
using explicitly erotic images in his paintings. In 1930 one
of such paintings, "Crucified Venus", is about to be
exhibited in Sydney. Anglican Church authorities view the
painting as too blasphemous for public exhibition and young
Rev. Anthony Campion (played by Hugh Grant), who had just
arrived from England, is sent to visit Lindsay at his estate
in Australian Blue Mountains and try to talk him over from
displaying the controversial image in public. When Campion,
accompanied by his young wife Estella (played by Tara
Fitzgerald), arrives to Lindsay's home, he would find the
artist, his wife and two children living together with three
young beautiful girls that serve as models. Soon it becomes
obvious that Lindsay won't change his mind, but the train
derailment forces Campions to prolong their stay at
Lindsay's home. During that time, in a hedonistic and
carefree atmosphere of the estate surrounded by enchantingly
beautiful Australian landscape, both Anthony and Estella
experience events that would start changing their views on
love, marriage and sexuality.</P>
<P>Many critics were tempted to view SIRENS as nothing more
than soft core pornography wrapped in the package of
"serious" film. At first glance, those critics might have a
point - the plot is weak or almost non-existent and in many
instances the conflict between sexuality and conventional
morality is illustrated with rather predictable situations
and gags, recycled from Bocaccio, D.H. Lawrence or even West
European "sex comedies" of 1970s. But Duigan justifies that
with the great sense of style and generally humanistic
approach to the story and characters. SIRENS doesn't feature
any sort of villains - even the conservatives, who are
supposed to be adversaries to Lindsay and his liberal views,
are presented as misguided but generally nice folks - Church
uses diplomacy instead of trying to force its way, and
Lindsay's redneck neighbours compensate their bigotry with
common-sense approach to life and manliness of their local
boys. The humour in the film seems incredibly restrained and
decent, at least compared with average Hollywood films that
would tackle sexuality as one of its subjects.</P>
<P>The two best known actors of the film - Sam Neill and Hugh
Grant - are something of a disappointment in this film.
Neill barely appears in the film, except in the scenes in
which his character fights ideological wars with the priest,
while Grant plays the same character he had played in dozens
of 1990s films. The pleasant surprise of this film are
actresses. The best known of them is fashion supermodel Elle
Fitzgerald. This was her first major role and she gained
extra pounds in order to give Rubenesque proportion to her
figure and thus her character physically resembling the
beauty standards of 1930s. The acting job in the role of
mischievous model Sheela was perhaps not as impressive, but
it was more than decent as far beyond the accomplishments of
other supermodels that tried acting. Portia de Rossi was
also good in the role of Giddy, the most naive and the least
"corrupted" of all three models. But the greatest acting
asset of the film was Tara Fitzgerald, who again appeared
with Hugh Grant one year later in THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP
THE HILL AND CAME DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. Here Fitzgerald
presented a lot of her acting talent, as well as her body.
Her figure, that seems so small compared to voluptuous
figures of Macpherson and Kate Fischer (who played Pru,
model who embraced Communist ideology), is used by Duigan as
a tool of character development - final liberation of that
character comes when Estella starts seeing that body as
equal to the models. The last shot of the film neatly
combines the beauty of Fitzgerald, Macpherson and other
ladies with the beauty of Australian landscape. Duigan had
the eye for such pretty sights, and he also utilised
Lindsay's real life home as authentic location. In some
instances, the symbolism was too obvious and some jokes
(like the stories about citizens of Australia being killed
by various wild animals) didn't exactly work, but SIRENS is
nevertheless very stylish and entertaining film that should
be recommended even to those viewers who are indifferent
towards seeing beautiful women naked.</P>
