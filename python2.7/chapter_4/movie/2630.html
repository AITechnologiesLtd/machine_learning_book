<PRE>                                WIDOWS'        PEAK
                      A        film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  The peace of        a small        post-WWI Irish
     village is        shattered by the feud of two women in this
     picturesque comedy.  As with many recent British films, the
     setting is        the real star of this film.  The plot twists are
     not as mysterious as they were intended to        be.  Rating: high
     +1        (-4 to +4).  WARNING: A        VERY HEAVY SPOILER FOLLOWS THE
     REVIEW.</PRE>
<PRE>     In        the 1920s, Kilshannon, Ireland,        is a town dominated by rich widows.
The hill at the        center of the town has been given over entirely        to the women
and has        been dubbed "Widows' Peak" by the locals.  Of the elder        female
contingent, first among        equals is Mrs. Doyle Couniha (played by        Joan
Plowright).  The one non-widow on Widow's Peak is Katherine O'Hara (Mia
Farrow)        who was        adopted        by the other widows after an indiscretion earlier in
her life.  O'Hara is a quiet mousey woman who uncharacteristically takes an
immediate dislike to newcomer Edwina Broome (Natasha Richardson).  Even
before Broome's        arrival        O'Hara is finding reason to hate her and soon the
two women are constantly at each others' throats, quite        to the bemused
amazement of Kilshannon.</PRE>
<P>     The screenplay of WIDOWS' PEAK was written years ago for Maureen
O'Sullivan to play O'Hara and for Mia Farrow to play Broome.  Time
passed and Farrow took the role originally written for her mother.  It
is really a pity it was not cast that way since O'Hara had the fiery
personality of O'Hara.  One side effect is that Farrow has to sound
Irish and Richardson has to sound American.  It would not have been
nearly as difficult for Farrow to sound American and her mother to
sound Irish.  Also, Farrow is far too quiet and introspective for the
role.  Richardson has a teaspoonful more personality, but neither
actress can wrest the audience's attention from Plowright.  Adrian
Dunbar of HEAR MY SONG is present but a real disappointment in a role
that gives him little chance to fulfill the promise he showed in that
film.</P>
<P>     One odd note, the film steals a joke from CASABLANCA.  In a film set
after 1943, it would have been considered a film allusion.  WIDOWS' PEAK is
set in the 1920s and that makes        it a theft.</P>
<PRE>     John Irvin        directs        taking maximum advantage of the        small Irish town
location.  He builds texture into the film showing us scenes around the
town, taking us        to a local dance and to        the town's regatta.  He        almost has
Bill Forsyte's ability for making the town itself the star, but        his town
does not have quite enough personality to be really interesting.  Now and
again he does get off a        clever piece of        local color, like a fairly witty
scene of all the widows        in town        visiting their husbands' graves        at the same
time, but it is        not quite enough to make the town really engaging.</PRE>
<PRE>     This is a film that is never so tricky as intended, but it        is always
watchable and usually quite fun.  I give it a high +1 on the -4        to +4 scale.</PRE>
<P>     SPOILER...SPOILER...SPOILER...SPOILER...</P>
<PRE>     What I found to be        the greatest flaw in this film is what was for me
almost its utter predictability.  I knew that there were surprises coming,
admittedly, but        I have to say I        figured        the entire plot        before we even saw
the character of Mrs. Broome.  I saw Miss O'Hara behaves peculiarly
negatively about the coming of Mrs. Broome, I thought of the demographics of
the area, and I        knew exactly what was happening.  Even then it seemed to me
that Richardson        was giving too much away by making Mrs.        Broome a terrible
actress.  (Okay, there were details about what was going on that were not
available until        later, but even        there I        was well ahead of the script.)        In
would not be fair to downrate the film because I guessed too early what        was
happening, but I think they could have done a better job of misleading me
once I knew.</PRE>
