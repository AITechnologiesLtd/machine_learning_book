<PRE>Rocky V (1990)</PRE>
<P>ROCKY V -- a favorite film at Badin High School, Hamilton, Ohio</P>
<P>Just like the three sequels before it, ROCKY V opens with a rehash of the 
last chapter.  We see the robotic Russian Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) 
beating up on Rocky (Sylvester Stallone), before Rocky finally gathers the 
mental fortitude to snap back and floor the perfectly-conditioned giant.  
The sequence is extremely contrived, of course, the chronology of the fight 
tinkered with so that all of Rocky's comeback punches seem to come in an 
awesome few seconds.</P>
<P>This is one of the pluses that the underrated ROCKY V brings to fans of the 
series.  Director John G. Avildsen - who collected an Oscar for directing 
the very first installment - along with script writer Stallone, borrow 
liberally from the foundation built by the four other outings.  We get to 
see everyone and everything again - manager Mickey Goldmill, 
opponent-turned-friend Apollo Creed, even the black hat and duds worn by 
Rocky during his days working for a loan shark on the Philadelphia docks.  
We see Rocky's staunch supporters peopling the streets of the Italian 
market, as well as the statue (from ROCKY III) atop the steps of the 
temple-like Philadelphia Museum of Art.  It's not necessary to have watched 
numbers one through four in order to understand this closing chapter, but it 
makes for more enjoyment.</P>
<P>Here's the story:  Rocky is injured in the battle with the rock-faced 
Russian Drago, invoking late manager Mick's memory that something is "broken 
inside."  Mysteriously, Rocky never seeks a doctor's help.  (In fact, there 
is always a scarcity of promoters and press and especially medical personnel 
around Rocky's fights, considering they are supposed to be huge spectacles.) 
  Not until wife Adrian (Talia Shire) coaxes Rocky into a CAT scan does he 
discover the brain injury that could end his life.  Meanwhile, Don King-like 
promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) attracts loads of attention 
with his mouth and his challenge for Rocky: give a title shot to my 
contender, Union Cane.  Rocky is sorely tempted, but Adrian keeps him from 
committing to any further matches.  What's especially hard, though, is 
Rocky's financial condition, a key component in the plot.  It seems Paulie 
inadvertently had Rocky sign a paper giving power of attorney to Rocky's 
accountant.  You guessed it - the guy invests the champ's millions and 
quickly loses them.</P>
<P>Predictability aside, Rocky's monetary ruin opens the story to compelling 
originality.  His estate auctioned off, Rocky moves his family into the 
South Philly rowhouse that he and Adrian bought as newlyweds.  We see some 
charming scenes with son Robert and Rocky kidding around, the boy showing 
great intelligence to Rocky's punchy and slangy style.  But Rocky is a good 
father, warning Robert about ways to act in the public school he must attend 
in the new neighborhood of "urban blight."</P>
<P>At least Rocky is a good father until a new young fighter comes all the way 
from Oklahoma to ask Rocky's guidance.  At first reluctant, Rocky grows to 
like the chance at still being in the ring, at least vicariously, through 
Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison).  The retired champ is flattered that he might 
establish a father-son relationship like the one Rocky had with Mick.  And 
they are successful together, much of Rocky's gut-punching greatness rubbing 
off on the young blonde pugilist.  The main question we want answered is how 
long can Tommy stand being called Rocky's boy?  How long will it be before 
the honey-tongued Duke lures Tommy over into his own slick side of the 
boxing game?</P>
<P>Humor contributes a lot to ROCKY V.  We still have Burt Young as Rocky's 
brother-in-law, a rummy hanger-on, a clichéd bumbling but lovable uncle to 
Rocky and Adrian's son Robert (Stallone's real-life son Sage Stallone).  And 
there's the wonderful exaggerated tone created by characters like George 
Washington Duke, the biggest ham since Apollo, and some over-the-top fight 
scenes that create as much laughter as fascination.</P>
<P>One of the most engaging parts of any ROCKY film is the montage.  "V" uses 
the technique well to tell a number of stories within the subplots.  We 
watch Rocky with protégé Tommy Gunn, training and coaching and mentoring, 
while Rocky's son Robert seeks attention but is shunned.  Because we've seen 
how close father and son really are, this drifting apart forms a serious 
threat to Rocky's success story:  it's clear that his family, such as it is, 
has always been more important to Rock than anything concerning the square 
circle.  Yes, it is overkill when Adrian says, "You're losing your family," 
but sometimes the big palooka needs a message to hit him square in the face. 
  My favorite sequence happens during a street fight.  Rocky is down and 
apparently out, flashes of memory adding to his trauma:  Ivan Drago's glare, 
his mouthpiece looking like steel teeth; Mick's gravelly voice belting out 
words of inspiration; a grainy shot of Rocky, eyes swollen shut, bright red 
blood poured suddenly over his face.  Avildsen has added some artful and 
gritty images here to explore Rocky's plight.  Even though Rocky's most 
dangerous weapon has always been his heart, how will he overcome the twinges 
of fear - and more directly, the brain damage - inflicted during combat with 
the Russian in the climax of ROCKY IV?</P>
<P>A brilliant stroke brings back Rocky's deceased manager Mickey; Burgess 
Meredith does a memorable cameo that ends up being one of the strongest 
scenes in the piece.  Bankrupt and disheartened, Rocky returns to the old 
gym where Mick first tutored him.  Mick willed it to Robert years before, 
and now Rock stands in the great dusty room and goes back into his memory to 
conjure Mick during a private moment just before Rocky fought Creed in the 
fluke title bout.  One can tell Meredith is 14 years older than he was in 
the 1976 ROCKY, but his veteran skills save the scene from being too 
sentimental, and help to provide Rocky with the incentive he needs to enter 
the other end of boxing.</P>
<P>Even though this final installment of ROCKY is ten years old, its themes 
strike home as very relevant.  Many of my students are inspired not only by 
Rocky's attitude and gutsy styles of training, but also by Bill Conti's 
music, an essential part of each film.  There's something mythical about the 
whole thing, the main plot lines involving glamorous rises and 
heart-breaking falls, underdogs overcoming high odds, father-son relations 
that are fatal or benevolent.  For fans of the ROCKY franchise, ROCKY V 
should be viewed carefully and not discounted as one of the best.</P>
