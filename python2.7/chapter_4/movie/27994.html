Exit Wounds</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Here you'll find everything you'd expect from a film called "Exit 
Wounds" ... lots of gunfire, car chases, things blowing up and catching 
fire, expensive sports cars, cool good guys, crafty bad guys, hip music, 
tough guy one-liners, comedic sequences, and of course, gratuitous 
frontal nudity. I'm not quite sure the reason for the title, except that 
it sounds cool and implies plenty of bullets in flight. Wait, perhaps 
they were playing on the words in a more emotional sense, since Seagal 
is forced to "exit" a desirable position on the force. Naaaah, this is 
definitely a "shut the mind off and enjoy the action" type of film. </P>
<P>An opening action sequence makes that point crystal clear, Lone Ranger 
Seagal single-handedly saves the vice president from a well-armed 
motorcade ambush. In the very next scene, despite his heroism, Seagal is 
promptly reprimanded and demoted for his inability to follow orders. 
Soon enough Seagal finds himself station in the rough part of town where 
a group of cops welcome him with an electric zapper and a 
stress-management group with desks comically too small for his huge 
body. </P>
<P>The film does an excellent job of keeping action rolling and 
interjecting comic relief: Anthony Anderson in the Lamborgini scene, Tom 
Arnold in stress management, and as the credits roll the two of them 
chewing the fat improv-style will send you on your way chuckling. </P>
<P>Of course, the story line has more holes than Seagal's stylishly dark 
garbs after a rain of bullets. He's so cool, never a scratch. And a few 
of the "dialogue only" scenes grind to a jam even a crowbar couldn't 
free. Still, you can't argue with a good car chase or helicopter 
bursting into flames, strong pacing, tight direction, and good 
old-fashioned action ... a lot of fun. Also worthy of note, a nice 
performance by DMX. </P>
