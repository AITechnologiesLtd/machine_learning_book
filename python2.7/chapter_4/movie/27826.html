<PRE>Imaginative but Incomplete "Monkey" Business
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>"Monkeybone" starts off promisingly as an amusing
exploration into the personality of struggling
cartoonist Stu Smiley (likable Brendan Fraser).  His
earlier years were marked by bouts of horrifying
nightmares while success had always eluded him.  But
after meeting sleep therapist Julie (appealing Bridget
Fonda), things began to change.  His nightmares
disappeared and his newfound sense of peace led him to
his newest cartoon, "Monkeybone," an overactive,
orange-colored simian that's actually a representation
of his repressed and unsatisfied libido.</P>
<P>His idea becomes a hit.  The Cartoon Network thinks
it'll be the hottest thing since the Power Puff Girls
while merchandising opportunities hold the promise of
untold fortunes.  But he is currently more
pre-occupied with mustering the courage to propose to
Julie.  Unfortunately, a freak accident lands him in a
coma, and this is where the film's creative juices
begin to stream forth.</P>
<P>While Stu's body lies in a vegetative state in the
real world, his psyche descends to a place called
Downtown, a bizarre fantasyland that looks like a
haunted carnival influenced with a touch of Edgar
Allen Poe.   It's a visually stunning dimension with
it's unusual inhabitants lifted from the world of Star
Wars, including a bulbous Cyclops, a Bee lady, a
humanoid kitty, and Downtown's leader who resembles a
Satyr.  And, there's also a familiar looking,
overactive, orange-colored simian.</P>
<P>What the movie tries to become at this point, I think,
is a clever take on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  With the
multiple personalities that make up Stu now split into
two (one is the libidinous Monkeybone, the other is
plain vanilla Stu), perhaps he can come to terms with
some of his unresolved issues.  </P>
<P>Rather than being dramatic, however, the film wants to
be funny and strange.  But Monkeybone's vituperative
chatter becomes a nuisance.  Meanwhile, director Henry
Selick (who gave us "The Nightmare before Christmas"
and "James and the Giant Peach") goes for the gusto in
terms of bizarre presentation.  The world that he has
created looks great, but he seems to have forgotten
that the characters need to mean something too.  Case
in point: Stu receives help from an unlikely source,
but the reasoning for that is never convincing.</P>
<P>Midway through the film, "Monkeybone" becomes too
clever for its own good.  It introduces a conspiracy,
a plot that threatens the happiness of those in the
land of the living, and a bizarre showdown between
Stu's now-separated two personalities.  That's just
too much for this 88-minute film.  But, I am happy to
say that I hadn't laughed harder this year as I did
during its final 15 minutes.  This is thanks to
Saturday Night Live cast veteran Chris Kattan, whose
body is borrowed by Stu who has returned to the land
of the living to warn Julie about the conspiracy. 
Kattan's body is dead, decomposing with a broken neck.
 Watching him run across town is downright funny.</P>
<P>But, that kind of manic energy was just unsustainable.
  In part, Fraser seems a bit lost and out of place
(he was much better in "Bedazzled").  Also, the film
never lets us internalize Stu's plight because there
is just too much going on.  "Monkeybone" may be the
cleverest movie to come out so far in 2001.  It was
innovative in its look and offered numerous
interesting ideas.  But the film never really takes
off.  I really wanted to like this film more.</P>
