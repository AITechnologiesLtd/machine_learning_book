<PRE>SOFT DECEIT (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Thanks to countless billions of souls that tried to atone
their sins through financial contributions, Catholic Church
has accumulated a great wealth through the centuries.
However, these days spiritual values aren't so strong, and
that includes protagonist of SOFT DECEIT, 1994 thriller
directed by Jorge Montesi. Adam Trent (played by Patrick
Bergin) is a professional criminal who managed to steal
millions of dollars from the Church funds. He is caught by
police, but few years behind bars are going to pass quickly
with the knowledge of loot safely stashed away. On the other
hand, influential Church officials want the money back and
the police, under political pressure, sets up a sting
operation for that very purpose. The mission is given to
atractive lady detective Anne Fowler (played by Kate Vernon)
who organises Trent's escape from prison, hoping that the
criminal would lead her to his stash. However, the things
don't go as planned - Trent seems to always be one step
ahead of its pursuers, and Fowler realises that she started
to fall in love with attractive criminal.</P>
<P>Script by Jorge Montesi and Roy Sallows had many interesting
possibilities, especially those arising from the constant
mind games and sexual tensions between two major
protagonists. Unfortunately, most of that potential got
drowned beneath the sea of cliches and terribly uninspired
performance by Kate Vernon, actress whose good looks didn't
match her acting abilities, at least in this film. As a
result, SOFT DECEIT, despite few bright moments, is not the
film that should be viewed as anything more than forgettable
cinema product.</P>
