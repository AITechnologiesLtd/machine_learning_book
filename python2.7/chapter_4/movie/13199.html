<PRE>JULIUS CAESAR (1953)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Joseph L. Mankiewicz
Adapter: Joseph L. Mankiewicz (from the play by William Shakespeare)
Starring: James Mason, Marlon Brando, John Gielgud, Louis Calhern, Edmond
O'Brien, Greer Garson, Deborah Kerr, Douglass Watson, Richard Hale, Alan
Napier, John Hardy, Jack Raine, Lumsden Hare, Paul Guilfoyle</P>
<P>I've finally come to the conclusion that the aspect of a Shakespeare
adaptation that makes or breaks it is the quality of the acting, and
everything else in the film, the direction, what it leaves out of the text,
the time period, yada yada yada, are all secondary.  If you've ever seen
the 1970 production of "Julius Caesar," you'll know that it looks good and
everything, but the acting by Charlton Heston, Jason Robards, and John
Gielgud is rather weak, and the film is ultimately not a success.  Even a
film like Baz Lehrmann's "Romeo + Juliet" is only marginally successful
because the sets and direction are great, and some of the supporting actors
are magnificent, but frankly, the two leads have no clue what they're
saying (Claire basically does a vapid redux of her character on "My
So-Called Life").</P>
<P>That's why this adaptation of "Julius Caesar" is so goddam good!  You have
Marlon Brando in his fourth screen performance, back in his prime
(sandwiched between performances in "Viva Zapata!" and "On the Waterfront,"
the latter for which he won an Oscar), playing the big scene-stealer in the
play, Mark Antony.  You have James Mason, an extraordinary and very
underrated actor, who had the guts to play the lead in Kubrick's "Lolita"
and did it to perfection, playing the tragic protagonsit, Brutus.  You have
John Gielgud (again), firing up the screen as my personal favorite
character in the play, Cassius.  And in small supporting roles, you have
people like "The Wild Bunch"'s Edmond O'Brien, "The King and I"'s Deborah
Kerr, and the villain from "Duck Soup," Louis Calhern, playing the
eponomously-titled character.  Just amazing.</P>
<P>The play itself is actually not one of Shakespeare's better ones.  The
climax pretty much comes around the middle-to-end of Act III, and
everything else almost seems to feel like an afterthought.  Mark Antony
hardly has any part in the play, save for Act III when he stuns everyone
with a brilliantly given speech that turns the entire tide of the play
around...and then disappears again, only to show up intermittently.  But in
all reality, Shakespeare at his most mediocre is still brilliant.</P>
<P>The play deals with the inner workings of the conspiracy concerning the
assasination of Julius Caesar (Calhern) by several of the senators working
for him, but is told from the perspective of Caesar's most trusted friend,
Brutus (Mason), who in the beginning, is gradually convinced by Cassius
(Gielgud), one of the conspirators, to help them kill him.  After giving in
and helping them murder Caesar in a brutal scene, he wins over the public
with a big speech, only to have Mark Antony (Brando), the sole supporter of
the Republic, turn things right around and convince everyone to hunt down
the conspirators and kill them.</P>
<P>Although whomever plays Antony often gets top bill (as Brando did), the
play's heart and soul is in Brutus, the man who is too easily folds and
convinces himself that what he's doing is good.  The play is an inner
battle for Brutus, and the film masterfully embraces that.  The best moment
in the film for me is not Antony's speech but rather the assasination
scene.  Often a gory scene (the one in the '70 version lasted, oh I dunno,
for about two minutes), the camera actually pulls away from the murder once
it has started, and shows a close-up on Brutus, who stands shocked by it,
still trying to figure out if he wants to join in.  It's just one of the
many examples of the way this film is superior to most Shakespeare films.</P>
<P>The acting is still the real highlight though, and this is one of the
best-acted Shakespeare screen adaptations.  Of course, it only helps that
the three leads are all method actors (I think), and that they are all
trained in the acting style that means acting with full emotional force. 
Marlon Brando got an Oscar nomination for his performance, and his acting
in his few scenes is just incredible.  His funeral speech is probably the
most stirring and jaw-droppingly awesome acted scene in any Shakespeare
film, and he does it so well that it's easy to believe that the Roman
citizens would change their minds so easily.  Meanwhile John Gielgud is
amazing as Cassius.  He actually turns the scene where he tries to convince
Brutus to join up with the other Senators into a seduction scene, playing
not only on Brutus's insecurities, but also, well, his latent
homosexuality.</P>
<P>And James Mason...well, he portrays perhaps the most sympathetic Brutus I
have ever seen anywhere.  I remember Jason Robards was merely "boring" as
Brutus; Mason breathes actual human life into the character, and creates
someone we can all identify with.  His final scenes are probably his best,
though, where he has to finally fess up to the fact that he made a terrible
mistake, and has to face the destruction it has caused, including the
suicide of his wife, Portia (Deborah Kerr).  Mason's performance gives us a
reason to care after Brando's speech midway through the film, because we
still want to see him handle his psychological battles.  While Brando's is
scene stealing and Gielgud's is masterful, Mason's is emotional.</P>
<P>I've probably said way too much about the acting; everything else about
this film is great as well.  The sets are wonderful, the black and white
cinematography gives it a sometimes eerie and conspiring feel, and most of
all, the direction by Hollywood great Joseph L. Mankiewicz.  With his
almost gritty direction and weird camera angles, he brings the play alive,
which is no shock because he's one of the best directors of films with lots
of great dialogue (see "All About Eve" and "Sleuth," two of the best
Hollywood films of all time and both directed by Mankiewicz).  He has a
certain knack for allowing dialogue to take precedence while still managing
to keep things moving.  If anything, his "Julius Caesar" is wonderfully
paced.</P>
<P>The best Shakespeare films are ones that are filled with life, like the
films by Branagh and Olivier, who were also able to give their Shakespeare
films a lot of depth as well.  And the very best ones were acted by actors
who connected with the audience, and gave them a real reason to care what
happens to a bunch of people speaking in poetic verses.  "Julius Caesar"
the play may not be one of Shakespeare's best, but weirdly enough, "Julius
Caesar" the 1953 film is one of the best film versions of his plays.</P>
