<PRE>                              WONDER BOYS
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     I have no idea what "wonder boys" are.  I assume it's one of many
questions that are answered in the novel but which go ignored in this
film adaptation.</P>
<P>     As it turns out, it doesn't really matter who the WONDER BOYS are.
The film has enough substance and, especially, ribald and dark, dark
humor to carry it despite a few minor flaws like this.</P>
<P>     A very deep character study, WONDER BOYS revolves around Pittsburgh
professor and novelist Grady Tripp (Douglas), now struggling with his
second novel, which has stretched into 2,600 pages and years in the
making.  Daytime, he teaches writing to the likes of James (Maguire) and
Hannah (Holmes), while attempting to hide his affair with the (married)
University Chancellor (McDormand) and keeping his unfinished novel from
the grubby hands of his editor (Downey).</P>
<P>     Grady's relationship with the talented (yet nearly sociopathic)
James becomes the focus of the picture, is Grady tries to coax the
hidden writing talent out of James, all while they take a wild ride
together through a Pittsburgh winter storm.</P>
<P>     The depth of character development in WONDER BOYS defies any hack
film critic's two-paragraph description of them.  Suffice it to say that
WONDER BOYS is often deep and invariably quite funny, especially if
you're a fan of black comedy.  Case in point: The film really gets going
when James kills the blind dog that is attacking Grady's leg.  I never
knew a dog's carcass could be so funny, and I'm something of an animal
lover.</P>
<P>     That said, WONDER BOYS is no KINGPIN.  This is a sophisticated
movie for a sophisticated audience.  The cast is universally
outstanding.  It's especially good to see McDormand in a good role
again, and Douglas and Maguire turn in very memorable performances,
redeeming them both for some recent, lackluster pictures.</P>
<PRE>     Go.  Laugh.  Enjoy a little intelligence at the movies for once.</PRE>
