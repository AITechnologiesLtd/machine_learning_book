<P>Cast:  Chow Yun-Fat, Jodie Foster, Bai Ling
Director: Andy Tennant
Writer: Anna Leonowens, Steve Meerson, Peter Krikes</P>
<PRE>Rating: Good Shot  (3 out of 4 stars)</PRE>
<P>Anna and the King strides onto the screen in full regalia, wearing a
brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes, deep, vibrant colors and an
epic storyline. It's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on
the politics of power, whether it's between governments, or the
interplay between a man and a woman.</P>
<P>Anna (Jodie Foster) is a widowed British schoolteacher with a touch of
wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the
recent death of her husband. With son in tow, she takes the employ of
King Mongkut (Chow Yun-Fat) to tutor his son in the English language.
Mongkut sees the strength of the British and correctly surmises that
his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the
western world. Anna function is to help provide that link.</P>
<P>The core of the film, of course, deals with the blossoming love between
Anna and Mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of
a shifting political climate. Foster plays Anna with equal parts
clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder. She is assertive, yet, respectful of
the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities
upon him. It is one of Foster's strongest performances since Silence of
the Lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career.
She brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not
have come across from a younger Foster. It's a joy to watch her cagily
bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of Mongkut's
monarchy. When she makes her entrance into a politically charged
banquet mid-film, she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her
textured performance.</P>
<P>Chow-Yun Fat's King Mongkut is every measure of Foster's Anna, perhaps
even more so. This is the Chow Yun-Fat that  Hong Kong cinema has been
in love with for nearly twenty years. He is imposing, yet vulnerable,
playful, but stern. It is an impressively assured and nuanced
performance.</P>
<P>Precious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an
unengaging subplot involving one the King's concubines (Bai Ling) and
her love of a commoner. It strikes with the subtlety of Siam's fabled
white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story.</P>
<P>Some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie. Although
a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film, it fits within
the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring Burma, a
country backed by the British.</P>
<P>Anna and the King transcends being a predictable, traditional love
story by avoiding mawkishness. It shows a seduction of intelligence.
Ever mindful of each other's positions, Anna and King Mongkut negotiate
a maze of social customs, conflicting world views and lost loved ones
to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying, if not
achingly bittersweet.</P>
