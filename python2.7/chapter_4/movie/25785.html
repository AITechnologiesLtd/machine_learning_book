<P>Let's get one thing straight, from jump: if one is to speak of kings of
comedy - especially filmed concert-comedy, and most especially in terms
of originality - any exclusion of the name Richard Pryor, immediately
calls ones sanity into question.  Not to mention the magnitude of ones
cajones.  So, are Misters Harvey, Hughley, Entertainer [yes, I know],
and Mac heirs to Pryor's crown, or just mere pretenders to the throne?</P>
<PRE>Hmmm...</PRE>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Named after the long-running comedy tour that began in 1997 and ended on
the same stage in 2000, THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY was filmed at the
Charlotte Coliseum on February 26th and 27th, 2000, and features
stand-up comedians and actors Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric The
Entertainer, and Bernie Mac.  The four men are shown not only on-stage,
but also in short behind-the-scenes bits that give the audience a brief
look at what motivates These Four Kings to do what they do best.  Look
and listen closely, and you might find that what you see on-stage, is
not necessarily what you'd get in Real Life...</P>
<P>The Upshot:
I think Pryor can breathe easy [hmmm...all things considered: no pun
intended].  This foursome is good, no doubt, but it'll take a lot more
than their approximately 30 minutes of stage time each, to wipe away any
memories of RICHARD PRYOR: LIVE ON THE SUNSET STRIP from my mind.</P>
<P>That said, past the "trash-talk" title of this Spike Lee joint, the four
"Kings" comedians do fit the bill for an audience that is used to their
brand of comedy - and, let's face it: that audience consists mostly of
cultural Blacks, and Whites who are Down.  Not to say that any of the
four were purposefully exclusionary - they weren't.  It's just that I'd
be very surprised to hear that Mr. And Mrs. Mainstreet were as laid out
throughout most of this concert, as many of the members of my (mixed
ages and races) viewing audience were at times.</P>
<P>[Hmmm...maybe I've gotten off to a bad start here.  Mr. And Mrs.
Mainstreet, feel free to go see the "Kangs" (as Steve Harvey jokingly
said the "country-ass" audience referred to them).  You can be Down too.
Anyway...]</P>
<P>Each of the four comics have had successes in similar venues: Harvey
hosts IT'S SHOWTIME AT THE APOLLO and is the star of THE STEVE HARVEY
SHOW TV series; Hughley was the original host of BET's COMIC VIEW (back
when it was funny) and like Harvey, is also star of a self-titled TV
series (THE HUGHLEYS); Cedric The Entertainer was the host of the second
year of COMIC VIEW (back when it was still funny, though well on the way
to becoming the unfunny joke that it is today) and co-stars on THE STEVE
HARVEY SHOW; and Bernie Mac, along with his ongoing role on MOESHA, has
appeared in movies like LIFE and ABOVE THE RIM.  But in this comedy
concert, it was their skills as veteran stand-up comedians, that came
into play.  With varying degrees of success.</P>
<P>Those "varying degrees" were strange, considering that each of the four
had very similar routines - granted, spiced with their own personal
flava.  If you kept track, you'd note that each of them touched on Old
School ways, on male/female relationships, and on the
ObWhiteAudienceMembers and how "we're different...but really, we're the
same", amongst other similar topics.  Of course, such is the Stuff of
comedy, especially the comedy of My People.  The way some of the
comedians were better at that Stuff than others, though, put me in mind
of IROC car races: since the vehicles are similarly equipped, the winner
is determined solely on his or her driving skills.  And in this case,
Steve Harvey - playing concert host while doing his own schtick - won
the Kings' Race Of Champions.</P>
<P>Harvey, a self-proclaimed "country boy" [though all of the Kings were
Country, dag!] had both the Charlotte and the theater audience right in
the palm of his hand.  He worked the crowd like a master (to say that he
reminded me of Johnny Carson in this, is a compliment), and almost
everything out of Harvey's mouth, was flat-out funny.  D.L Hughley, who
followed Harvey, wasn't as "on" as I've seen him in the past.  I've
never heard this particular routine of his before, but it sounded too
familiar; too...tired.  I found myself wishing he'd do his brilliant
"Come Back With Me" nostalgia "tour" (which reminds me: I need to find
that tape...).</P>
<P>Up next was the always-stylish Cedric The Entertainer, and while he
couldn't quite top Harvey, he also pumped up both audiences.  I know
*I'd* pay for a recording of "Peanut Butter...No Jam".  Closing the bill
- in my opinion, a mistake - was Bernie Mac.  The thought that kept
coming to me while watching Mac was, "what the hell is he so mad
about?".  The second thought was, "...and why should I care?".  Not a
good thing when you're supposed to be laughing at the jokes.  True, I
snickered now and then, but Mac never took off for me.  And neither did
the relatively flat ending.</P>
<P>Unless I miss my guess, Spike Lee should take blame for that virtual
thud.  That, the ineffectiveness of too many of the background bits [why
not spend some time telling us about the tour itself?  Or why such
talented men aren't making hand-over-fist like buttcheek-spreaders like
Jim Carrey?  Why'd you short-change the off-stage bits, Spike?], and
especially the terrible editing job done on this film.   And can you get
less impersonal than to keep showing the auto-tracking camera moving
back and forth across the stage?  The cold feeling of the shots almost
negated the energy that Harvey & Company generated.  Still, Lee deserves
props if only for bringing this concert to a wide audience.  After all,
when's the last time you saw a comedy concert released theatrically?</P>
<P>Taken on its own merits, THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY was a successful
comedy concert; more successful in some parts (any time Steve Harvey was
on-stage) than in others (Bernie Mac's show-closing routine, Spike Lee's
filming, the poor editing, and the "off" feeling some of the non-concert
bits), but overall, a good show to watch.  But it does beg two related
questions: one, why a theatrical release? (possible answer: not
everybody gets HBO?); and two, why MTV Films?</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Thank you, Brother Spike, for providing me with the grindstone for
today's Black Factor Axe.</P>
<P>"How's that?", you say?  Well, I'll tell ya: it has been said that Lee
chose MTV Films over BET as a vehicle for producing "Kings" primarily
because, in a word, BET is notoriously cheap toward its performers
(something to the effect of Lee wanting to be paid in something other
than "sodas and subs").  Say what you want about the guy, but in this
case, I say, more power to ya, Spike.</P>
<P>Ahhh, BET: home of the wannabe-a-goldtooth-gangsta video manual, the
return of the minstrel show (aka, the latter years of COMIC VIEW), and
the never-ending infomercial.  BET: the Graveyard for any and every old
Black TV show - as long as it was a comedy (and usually, a lame one).
BET: The Hoochie Network.  Yes, Brother Spike was right on the money, in
more ways than one.  And if Lee's word ain't good enough for you, check
out the comic strip THE BOONDOCKS by Aaron McGruder (available online at
<A HREF="http://www.boondocks.net/">http://www.boondocks.net/</A>).  McGruder's strip frequently provides
pointed - and funny - commentary on the sad state of BET.  Bammer sez
check it out.</P>
<P>Now, don't get me wrong; BET owner Robert Johnson knows how the game is
played in the capitalistic society known as Corporate America.  We can
bitchnmoan until the cows come home, but at the end of the day, Johnson
uses BET to line his pockets with dough.  And maybe that's as it should
be; after all, Johnson is really no different than the owners of any
other television network, who are also out to line their pockets with
dough, and produce pablum just as unpalatable as anything on BET.  But
one thing is certain: given Johnson's bottom line, the history of BET to
this point, and how We sometimes view anything Black-related, We delude
Ourselves when We think that BET is *anything* deeper than what the name
implies: a television network that (purports that it) provides
entertainment either primarily for, or about, Blacks.</P>
<P>Still..."Black Entertainment Television", my melanin-enhanced behind.
With a notable few exceptions (Tavis Smiley, TEEN SUMMIT, BOBBY JONES
GOSPEL, and maybe one or two more), it's been a LONNNNNNNG time since I
was Entertained by anything on BET.  As always, Your Mileage May Vary.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
"Kings"?  Hmmm...more like Clown Princes (and Bernie Mac, more a
Squire).  Still, the foursome did well, with Steve Harvey conducting the
How To Work An Audience clinic of a lifetime.  I have no idea whathell
was up with Spike Lee's poor filming and editing, though.  This joint
looked downright ugly.</P>
<P>THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY (rating: greenlight):
But though his illness may have left Richard Pryor long past his stage
performing time, King Richard is *not* yet dead.  Long live the King...</P>
