<P>   "Hugo Pool" is the work of the man who gave us one of the
great irreverent movies of all time, "Putney Swope." This is in
itself enough reason to run to see this latest contribution,
which puts him at the helm after a six-year hiatus.  But alas, if
"Swope" might be considered today even more brazen given
the more extreme demands of the political correctness
movement, "Hugo" is a distressing disappointment.  Now,
Downey's heart is certainly in the right place with this
absurdist comedy which treats one of the world's dread
diseases with a touch of honey.  Downey's wife Laura died at
the age of thirty-six of ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, which
attacks and kills off nerves rendering one part of the body
after another paralyzed and unusable.  In the production
notes, Downey is quoted as feeling that his wife, who lost her
life so tragically at an early age, was responsible for making
his own life so meaningful.  Downey constructs "Hugo Pool"
around that theme, setting up characters far more quirky than
the Savannah denizens you've seen in Clint Eastwood's
"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," using his central
character to bring a dysfunctional family together and provide
for a feel-good bonding of a zany community.</P>
<P>   The trouble with the movie is not so much that it is off-the-
wall silly but that the characters, who apparently are given
considerable freedom to improvise, also seem to be holding
themselves back as though fearful of treating the ALS
affliction with frivolity.  The characters are for the most part
cartoonish enough, but if any trait burnishes through it is
repulsiveness rather than mere oddity.  With Malcolm
McDowell in the role of a seedy and unsympathetic heroin
addict, Richard Lewis as a bulgy-eyed brat, Robert Downey
Jr. as an unimaginably giddy film director, even the good guys
are unable to save the work from audience indifference.</P>
<P>   A road movie in which one adventure follows another,
"Hugo Pool" features the title character, played by Alysssa
Milano, who runs a business filling pools with water and
cleaning them.  With a heavy schedule of natatoria to saturate
and unpollute in a single day, she calls on several of the
people in her life to help her.  She will pay her mother
Minerva (Cathy Moriarty) enough to allow her to settle
accounts with her disgusting bookie so that she will not have
to work off the debt in bed with him.  She will permit Franz
Mazur (Robert Downey Jr.) to work off the $12,000 he owes
her by impressing him into her service.  And she sends her
dissolute dad, Henry (Malcolm McDowell) to the Colorado
River to extract enough gallons of water to fill the pool of one
of her clients--illegally, it seems, since California is
experiencing a drought.  The most sympathetic character of
the lot is Floyd (Patrick Dempsey), the uncomplaining victim
of ALS, who seems content to have his head scratched, his
body uprighted in his wheelchair, and his need for liquid
elimination assisted.  Functioning as a kind of angel, the dying
Floyd fashions the folks around him into better people, not he
least by giving Minerva a hot tip on a long shot in a harness
race and by allowing the cutesey Hugo Dugay to overcome
her fear of sex.</P>
<P>   The picture features a choice ensemble of actors who are
starved by the lack of a nourishing script and whose
improvised quips and sallies fall far short of hilarity.  The best
that can be said of the film is that it emphasizes a bold and
colorful visual design, is professionally edited and has a good
sound track particularly in offering a section of Richard
Wagner's "The Flying Dutchman."  Rated R.  Running Time:
93 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
