<P>      A SIMPLE WISH is well-cast, I'll give it that.  Martin Short is
the perfect choice for a bumbling fairy godmother (hey, it's the nine-
ties) who botches his first assignment, granting a wish to a little girl
(Myra Wilson) whose father (Robert Pastorelli) is an aspiring New York
City stage actor.  And who else would you want but Kathleen Turner as
the evil godmother-turned-Wicked Witch of the West Side, out to claim
his (and every other good witch's) wand?  Short is, at times, passable,
but Ms. Turner is great fun.  Her character gets the shaft on screen
time, though, and that's a loss.  The rest of this crap is strictly for
kids, with wit of the squirting-catsup-bottle-in-the-face variety.
(Okay, okay, there *is* an inspired encounter between Short, Wilson, 
and a Nebraska redneck, but that's about it.) One hour was more than
enough for me.  I left around the time that a character began vomiting
computer-generated frogs.  Did I miss a scene of someone farting fish?</P>
