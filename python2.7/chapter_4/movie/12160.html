<PRE>                   "CITY OF ANGELS" (USA, 1998)
                 A Film Review by James Kendrick
                       ***1/2 (out of ****)<HR></PRE>
<P>Director: Brad Silberling || Screenplay: Dana Stevens (based on
an original screenplay by Wim Wenders and Peter Handke) || Stars:
Nicolas Cage (Seth), Meg Ryan (Maggie), André Braugher (Cassiel),
Dennis Franz (Messinger), Colm Feore (Jordan), Robin Bartlett
(Anne), Joanna Merlin (Teresa) || MPAA Rating: PG-13<HR></P>
<P>There is a striking scene early in "City of Angels," where all
the angels who live unseen in our midst, gather at the beach to
watch the sun rise. The camera moves above them, showing the
endless rows of ethereal men and women, all garbed in black. Then
the camera moves in on the face of Seth, an angel played by
Nicolas Cage, and as the sun rises, he smiles and his entire face
lights up. You see, the angels can hear music in sunrises and
sunsets, but they cannot feel a human touch.</P>
<P>It is an important scene for several reasons. First of all, it is
one of many instances in the film that make angels seem
thoroughly plausible. The film presents these fantastic beings as
normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth,
watching what goes on with little interference. There are none of
the standard, hokey angel references used in recent films like
"Angels in the Outfield" (1994) or "Michael" (1996). The angels
here are stark and believable.</P>
<P>This early scene on the beach is also an important scene of
juxtaposition, for its shows how God's angels can enjoy aspects
of the earth that human cannot, and yet they are denied so many
simple human pleasures, like feeling the sand on their feet or
the waves lapping at their legs, or the smell of the salt in the
air. There is an inherent tragedy in being an angel, although
there is much beauty in it as well. They eternally walk the
earth, listening to our thoughts, touching us in our pain, and
leading the dying to heaven. Like human existence, being an angel
is often confused and unsure.</P>
<P>"City of Angels" is essentially a love story, between Seth and a
human, a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named Maggie (Meg Ryan).
He first sees her when he is in her operating room, waiting to
lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven. Maggie is
distraught, doing everything in her power to stop the man from
dying on her table, and Seth is moved by her efforts and, more
importantly, her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies.
Angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery
and pain, and Seth does what he can with his invisible touch, but
it's not enough. He wants to be with her and share her pain, not
just stand back at a distance.</P>
<P>He learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love
and touch is for him to "fall" and become human. He learns this
from another fallen angel, played by Dennis Franz ("N.Y.P.D.
Blue") in a touching and humorous performance. Sitting at a diner
together, Franz tells Cage's character about how wonderful it is
to be human - to be able to taste food, feel another person's
skin, smell the air, and most importantly, have a loving wife and
children. Of course, there is pain to go along with all this, but
for Seth, it will be worth it.</P>
<P>"City of Angels" is something of a reinterpretation of Wim
Wender's haunting 1988 film "Wings of Desire." Wenders' film was
more like a poem - it was the feeling, the emotion that truly
mattered over what actually happened. The Americanized version
moves the location from divided Berlin to broken Los Angeles, and
the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal
angel and the mortal human. And, unlike most foreign films that
are re-made into Hollywood fare, it doesn't suffer extensive
damage. This may be because director Brad Silberling ("Casper")
and screenwriter Dana Stevens ("Blink") wanted to make "City of
Angels" its own movie - inspired by "Wings of Desire," but not an
attempt to copy it.</P>
<P>And yet, "City of Angels" is not a typical Hollywood movie. It is
beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer John Seale
("The English Patient"), whose sweeping aerial shots and golden
lighting make Los Angeles into an almost unrecognizable new
world.  Seale creates many striking visuals: in addition to the
beach scene, there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library
where all the angels appear at banisters all around, looking down
at Seth as he watches Maggie walk by.</P>
<P>While the film travels along a charted plot, it takes time to
develop its characters and situations; it sheds light on the
boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly, and
shows just how thin those boundaries are. Both Cage and Ryan give
soulful, soft-spoken performances. Ryan, who is usually so bouncy
and energetic, truly embodies a sadness that can only be
alleviated by a heavenly touch. Cage projects all his desire and
longing to be human in simple, heartfelt gazes, and speaks with
the comforting, knowing voice that only an angel could have.</P>
<P>What is most striking about "City of Angels" is that Stevens has
added a new ending to the screenplay, which is both unexpected
and challenging. It's not a formulaic Hollywood ending, because
it is both sad and uplifting at the same time.  It doesn't give
the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance.
Instead, it offers something much better, something that speaks
to the depths of what it means to be human and alive.
