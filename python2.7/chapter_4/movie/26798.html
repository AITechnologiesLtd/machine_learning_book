   aka RANG-E KHODA [Farsi; English subtitles]</P>
<P>Directed by Majid Majidi, from his screenplay. Starring Mohsen Ramezani,
Hossein Mahjoub, Salime Feizi. Running time: 90 minutes. Rated PG for
frightening scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on November 7th, 2000.</P>
<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>To the best of my knowledge, "The Color Of Paradise" is the first Iranian
film to be screened in a Newfoundland cinema. I confess that I had little
idea what to expect heading into the showing. My general impression of
Iran, as a country, is less than favorable. I was raised during the
Iran-Iraq war and the reign of the Ayatollah Khomeini; when I reflect on
Iran, my first thought is of the infamous death threat made by the former
Ayatollah against author Salman Rushdie because of the content of his
book "The Satanic Verses".</P>
<P>But it would be a mistake for me to tar all Iranians with the same
brush. And indeed, "The Color Of Paradise" is a film totally divorced from
such international scandal. It is a very small, quiet, spiritual movie, as
far removed from world politics as it is possible to be. This is a story
not of political war or religious fanaticism, but of one sightless boy and
the way his blindness helps him to see God better than anyone else in his
life.</P>
<P>As the film opens, we are introduced to young Mohammad (Mohsen Ramezani),
who attends a school for the blind in Tehran. Classes have ended for the
year (city schools are better than rural schools, Mohammad later tells his
sisters, because they close earlier) and his father, Hashem, is supposed
to come and bring him home. But for a long time, Mohammad's father does
not come. When he finally does, it is a joyless reunion -- Hashem (Hossein
Mahjoub) asks the school officials to keep Mohammad for the summer. It
transpires that Mohammad's father, a widower, fears that having a blind
son around will impair his chances of finding a new wife, something he
wants very desperately.</P>
<P>Ultimately, Hashem is compelled to bring his son home. There, Mohammad
enjoys a happier existence around his two young sisters and his beloved
Granny (Salime Feizi). But Hashem eventually manages to pawn Mohammad off
on a blind carpenter (Morteza Fatemi), who agrees to take the boy in as an
apprentice. This decision precipitates an upheaval in the lives of all
Mohammad's family, and poses the question of who is truly blind -- the boy
or his father?</P>
<P>What is most striking about "The Color Of Paradise" is the way
writer/director Majid Majidi and cinematographer Mohammad Davudi have
managed to capture the simple beauty of northern Iran. Be it the humble
splendour of children playing in an alfalfa field, or the furious vista of
a summer rainstorm, the countryside is brought to vivid life, and is as
much a character as any of the people inhabiting the film.</P>
<P>This is accentuated by Mohammad Reza Delpak's excellent work on the
soundtrack. To reflect the enhancement of young Mohammad's other senses in
compensation for his blindness, the noises of the Iranian environment is
made as vital as its appearance. The movie is filled with the sounds of
nature, from the easily identifiable -- such as a woodpecker hammering at
a tree -- to the more mysterious and exotic. It brings a new dimension to
the movie, and demonstrates just how important and effective sound can be,
if handled skillfully.</P>
<P>Ramezani does terrific work here for such a young actor, delivering a very
natural performance as Mohammad. When the boy cries during an emotional
conversation with the carpenter, his grief is heartfelt and sincere.
Ramezani is not overly cloying or cute; even a rather sentimental scene in
which he rescues a baby bird which has fallen from its nest is not
overplayed. Ramezani makes Mohammad believable.</P>
<P>Less successful is Mahjoub, whose demeanour borders at times on the
preposterous. Majidi is wise not to portray Hashem as an entirely
villainous figure -- his motives in seeking a new wife are sincere, even
if his methods leave a lot to be desired. But Mahjoub cannot hope to 
compare to his young co-star's visceral portrayal, and this leaves Hashem
seeming weak and underdeveloped. Whereas Ramezani embodies his character,
Mahjoub feels very much like nothing more than an actor playing a role.</P>
<P>But although Majidi does an excellent job with the general presentation of
"The Color Of Paradise", he is less successful in its actual development.
These sorts of movies need a steady progression to maintain viewer
interest, but Majidi's story just stops for long stretches of time. As a
result, "The Color Of Paradise" makes for far less compelling watching
than it ought to, and indeed the pacing is so somnabulent in places that I
found myself almost disinterested. There just does not appear to be enough
substance in the movie to support its feature-length running time; I think
Majidi would have been far better served by transforming it into a short
film.</P>
<P>Also unfortunate is the movie's ending, which is so contrived as to strain
belief. It does, at least, deliver with an appropriate and moving pay-off 
which perfectly reflects the film's themes. But this is one of those cases
when you can see the puppeteer's strings; the events of "The Color Of
Paradise"'s climax appear to happen not because they are a natural
development, but simply because they were required to end the movie.</P>
<P>As such, "The Color Of Paradise" ends up being a well-intentioned movie
bogged down by clumsy filmmaking. Young people, who are presumably its
target audience, will likely be particularly bored by its slow movement
and lack of interesting characters (beyond Mohammad, of course).
Ramezani's performance and the beautiful imagery are commendable, though,
and ensure that a viewing of "The Color Of Paradise" is a memorable
experience.</P>
