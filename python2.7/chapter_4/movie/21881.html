<P>Googly eyes that spring forth from a ghoulish figure. A burning
windmill. Ornate choir music. Jeffrey Jones. Sleepy Hollow is Tim
Burton's Greatest Hits. The trouble with most compilation albums is that
they're superficial, a bunch of songs with only one context:
retrospection. If this latest gloomfest from Burton doesn't make you
yearn for the days when you were witnessing his directorial flourishes
for the first time, we saw different films. While the setting is hollow,
the storytelling is shallow.</P>
<P>Washington Irving's classic tale has been retooled to the sensibilities
of Burton and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker (of Se7en). Schoolteacher
Ichabod Crane (Depp) is now a New York City police constable sent
upstate with his wild detecting contraptions (he's a pioneer of
forensics) to investigate a series of decapitations in the community of
Sleepy Hollow. The town's magistrates have pegged The Headless Horseman,
a vengeful ghost, as the killer, but Crane, whose spell-dabbling mother
(Lisa Marie) was tortured to death by puritans, prefers to put his faith
in logic over the superrnatural.</P>
<P>With "Murder She Wrote" or "Scooby Doo Mysteries" instead of Irving's
text as its template, the remainder of the plot feels like filler. Crane
flirts with Katrina (Ricci, in a yellow wig-Burton apparently shares a
blonde hair fetish with Hitchcock), the winsome daughter of landlord
Baltus Van Tassel (Gambon). Katrina's hand has already been promised to
Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien in a role that thankfully doesn't tax
his limited range), which, according to the principles of gothic
literature, means one third of the triangle will have to be dispatched.
Then there's the orphan (Marc Pickering) who tags along with Crane as a
sort of junior Watson, squashing spiders for his wimpy mentor and
shielding him from harm.</P>
<P>Burton and his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have concocted some
psychotically pretty images that visually distinguish this
interpretation of ...Sleepy Hollow from all the others, especially in
scenes featuring Christopher Walken, who leaves a lasting impression as
the Horseman. (Don't worry, I haven't ruined anything.) The actor's
unearthly physical presence has been noted in the past, but here, with
snarls for dialogue and a mouthful of pointy teeth, he achieves
heretofore-unexplored levels of camp. His performance lacks the tragic
elements of the most memorable movie monsters, but the very sight of him
defibrilates a movie mired in Hammer cliches and (with one exception,
involving a duel) derivative action sequences.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, I know, those unmotivated bolts of lightning, shots of people
darting awake from a nightmare in a cold sweat, melodramatic line
readings, and fog-drenched, minimalist sets are Burton's way of paying
tribute to the horror pictures he loved as a youth (Hammer mainstay
Christopher Lee even has a cameo), but the effect is muffled by a
self-consciously B-grade and critically underdeveloped script, not to
mention a budget that could've funded fifty or sixty Vincent Price
flicks. Ichabod and Katrina's cursory romance has been spared the
imagination that went into the special effects (which are spectacular),
and the resolution, which follows a carriage race climax that falls
short of thrilling (not enough complications), is a real head-scratcher.
(The filmmakers skip a necessary step in the plotting.)</P>
<P>I referred to some of Burton's other work in the opening paragraph-in
order: Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice; Frankenweenie (a short);
his entire catalogue; and Beetlejuice and Ed Wood. Burton's Sleepy
Hollow is stitched together from spare parts like some cinematic
Frankenstein, and it's unwieldy. This is the third time he and Depp have
collaborated on a project (after Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands),
annihilating that old adage about charm-their previous unions were much
more fruitful. Depp really disappoints; he emasculates Ichabod, but the
character's cowardice lacks shading. The problem is not that we wind up
rooting for the Headless Horseman, it's that we never root for Crane.</P>
<P>Burton's career is on a downswing-his last effort, Mars Attacks, was
another unsuccessful hommage. His work of late is most signifcantly
characterized by its thematic emptiness-if only, in fishing through his
old bag of tricks, he had pulled up the emotional grandeur of Edward
Scissorhands or Ed Wood, films that spoke volumes about alienation and
passion. It is Burton who loses his head in the dark, dull Sleepy
Hollow. Or, at least, his knack.</P>
