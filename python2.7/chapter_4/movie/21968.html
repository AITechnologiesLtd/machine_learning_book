<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A 'B' movie political thriller, that was shrewd enough to get newsreel
footage of the royal family and the cabinet attending the opening of
Parliament into its closing action scenes. The juicy part of the tough
cop going after the IRA terrorists, Inspector Hollis, was written by
Richard Johnson, the actor who plays the hard-nosed cop.</P>
<P>The weak script and uninspiring dialogue, is compensated for by the
crisp action sequences and fast pacing of the story. It begins in the
Belfast of 1972, and a demolition expert and former Britisher officer,
Hennessy (Steiger), tells his childhood friend and wanted IRA leader,
Sean Tobin (Porter), that he wants no part of that organization, he is
only interested in his family first. Tobin tells him that the cause of a
free Ireland comes above anything else to him. Sooner than you can say
corned beef and cabbage, Hennessy's wife and 7-year-old daughter are
accidently machined gun to death by a British soldier who stumbled when
chasing after bomb and rock throwing demonstrators, thereby reeling off
a volley of shots that killed seven people.</P>
<P>Hennessy is not telling anyone his plans. When he takes off for London
the next morning, skipping his family's funeral, Sean decides to have
his men pick him up and see what he plans on doing. When forced at
gunpoint into a car and unwilling to reveal his plans, the gunman is
suddenly overtaken by Hennessy and shot. The police of the Special
Branch unit of Scotland Yard discover that the dead man is a thug
working for the IRA, and Commander Rice (Trevor) calls in his most
fearsome agent, just back from duty in Belfast, Inspector Hollis, to
look into the matter.</P>
<P>Not going by the book, the inspector beats it out of one of the IRA
cronies that it was Hennessy who killed the thug the police found in the
car. But the cops can't figure out what is going on; that is, until the
IRA learns that Hennessy is going to blow up Parliament and realizing
that if he does that, it will be terrible for the image of the IRA, as
the whole world will turn against them. Therefore, they tell the police
Hennessy's plans and say they will stop him themselves if they have to.</P>
<P>Hennessy chooses as his London hideout the flat of his childhood friend,
Kate Brooke (Lee Remick), whose IRA husband died from the blast of a
bomb he planted. She welcomes him into her flat, but is suspicious of
why he is here, telling him she wants no part in violence or anything to
do with the IRA. He says that it is better for her sake, if he tells her
nothing except that he has nothing to do with the IRA.</P>
<P>The revengeful Hennessy has a one-track mind, never revealing anything
about his character or why he should snap in this way and come up with
such a ludicrous scheme, as the one he has hatched. But he decides to
kidnap the MP Burgess (Moxey) and disguise himself as Burgess and attend
the opening of the Parliament, with enough dynamite strapped onto him to
blow it and him to smithereens.</P>
<P>This is one of those films that doesn't add up if you think about it.
There was one scene where all Hollis had to do was call Rice and have
the masquerading Hennessy be picked up in Parliament, but instead, he
heroically and foolishly goes after Hennessy by himself in Parliament.
The film hopes to get by because of the taut acting jobs of its lead
characters and by the semi-documentary glossy black-and-white look its
color tinted film has, giving it a natural and gritty feel. But the
film's ending has so many holes in its planning, that the film seems
incredulous and the points it make seem dull, and its suspense is not
that nerve wracking either, since you can almost bet your house that the
filmmakers are not going to have the loony Hennessy blow up Parliament.</P>
<P>The film avoids any political manifestations, making the story about the
crazed loner Hennessy take precedence over any sectarian issues that
were in the news regarding Northern Ireland. The best things one can say
about the film, was that the acting wasn't bad and it was watchable even
if it was not a very believable story.</P>
