MONKEYBONE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>MONKEYBONE is the second film this week -- the other was 3000 MILES TO 
GRACELAND -- that doesn't live up to the promise of its trailers.  
MONKEYBONE is by far the better of the two, which isn't exactly high 
praise.</P>
<P>The movie's twisted, silly and sometimes sick humor comes from the minds 
of director Henry Selick (THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS), screenwriter 
Sam Hamm (BATMAN) and comics writer Kaja Blackley (DARK TOWN).  The 
stunning visuals look like a cross with THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, 
the bar scene from STAR WARS and a nightmare vision of an amusement 
park.  Although the images devilishly delight the audience, the script 
is as dead as the afterlife, called Downtown, in which most of the movie 
takes place.  Whoopi Goldberg has a high old time as Death, the queen of 
the underworld.</P>
<P>Brendan Fraser, the star of MONKEYBONE, has two modes: hilarious, as he 
was in my personal favorite of his, BLAST FROM THE PAST, and awful, as 
in DUDLEY DO-RIGHT.  To be fair, he is a wonderfully gifted comedic 
actor and his failures come mainly from an inability to say no to 
terrible scripts.  </P>
<P>This time Fraser plays Stu Miley, as in S. Miley (get it?), a cartoonist 
who created "Monkeybone, America's most disturbed comic strip."  He met 
his girlfriend,  Dr. Julie McElroy (Bridget Fonda), at The Sleep 
Institute, where he went to get help with his severe and bizarre 
nightmares.  </P>
<P>After being hit on the head in a car accident, he goes into a deep coma, 
sending him to Downtown, from which he may never return.  At least not 
unless Death gives him a gold-plated exit pass.  Accompanying him on his 
journey is his sidekick, the sassy Monkeybone, who has a fixation on 
women's breasts and on his own lack of private parts, which he blames on 
his creator, Stu.  Rose McGowan does a sweet turn as Kitty, Stu's helper 
in the demented Downtown.</P>
<P>Chris Kattan, as a dead gymnast, gets the most laughs.  An organ donor, 
he has doctors hot on his trail, trying to get his organs.  He uses them 
like water balloons to toss at people.  If it sounds gross, it is.  
Personally, I was impressed by Kattan's acting but found the jokes 
merely stupid.</P>
<P>Finally, a piece of friendly advice for Fraser.  Please treat the 
projects that you are offered as you would a serious illness.  Once you 
receive the script, ask for a second opinion.  </P>
<P>MONKEYBONE runs 1:27.  It is rated PG-13 for crude humor and some nudity 
and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey and his friends, all about 12, had different opinions of 
the film.  Jeffrey (**) said that he didn't laugh once but that he 
thought the plot was imaginative.  Maxim (***) commented on how much he 
liked the characters and the Fantasyland part.  Sam (*** 1/2) said that 
he found the movie very funny.  Nickolas (*** 1/2) mentioned how 
interesting he found the whole setup.  All of them liked the organ donor 
part.</P>
