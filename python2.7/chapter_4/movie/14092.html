<PRE>                    THE CHAMBERMAID ON THE TITANIC
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: In a harsh steel mill town in France
          of 1912 a man's romantic fantasies transform his
          life and the lives of the people around him.  This
          is a Spanish film about how human nature will
          choose a pleasant lie over a brutal truth and the
          power of the right fantasy to transfigure the
          listener.   Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 9 positive, 0 negative, 2 mixed</PRE>
<P>     If I were to look for a film to double-feature with THE
CHAMBERMAID ON THE TITANIC, it would probably be last year's
misunderstood and under-appreciated THE POSTMAN.  Both films are about
unpleasant societies and the transforming and inspiring power of just
the right lie.  In each film the public is more than anxious to be
fooled by the lie that fills a need.</P>
<P>     THE CHAMBERMAID ON THE TITANIC opens in a steel mill town
somewhere in France.  One gets a feel for how harsh life is in the
credit sequence where the pouring of molten steel looks like the core
of a volcano.  Fun in this town is the annual race in which the
runners, sopping wet, carry large sandbags on their backs through
puddles of standing water.  Each then has to climb a hill of cinders to
retrieve a baton only to return to the run.  The winner this time, as
it has been the previous two, is young and handsome Horty (Olivier
Martinez).  This year there is to be a special prize.  The winner gets
a trip to Southampton, England to see the embarkation of the steamship
Titanic.  Actually the prize was to have been two tickets, but the
manager of the mill wants to use the opportunity to attempt to seduce
Horty's wife Zoe (Romane Bohringer).  Unaware of what is happening at
home, Horty goes to Southampton.</P>
<P>     In his hotel Horty meets a beautiful damsel in distress.  Marie
(Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) is to be a chambermaid on the departing ship in
the morning, but she cannot find a room for the night and asks Horty if
she may have his room.  He reluctantly agrees and spends a frustrating
but chaste night in the same bed with the comely woman.  Marie is gone
before he arises and as he watches the Titanic set sail, he notices
that a local photographer captured her picture.  He purchases the
picture and fantasizes about what might have been.</P>
<P>     On his return, Horty's friends hint to him that his wife may have
been seeing the manager.  Jealous of his wife, he retreats to the bar
to enjoy his memories and his photograph of Marie.  When his friends
start pressing him for details, he brags of his romantic adventures,
telling his fantasies as if they were true.  What begins as the
locker-room sort of boasting evolves into a sort of romantic soft-core
pornography.  Ever-increasing crowds of both genders gather each night
to escape their problems and hear the story of the romantic interlude.</P>
<P>     The deceptively simple story touches on not just the mystique of
womanhood, but the will to believe and to a certain extent
commercialization of the arts.  We have a story of the duality of
legend and reality and the will to believe.  THE CHAMBERMAID ON THE
TITANIC, which takes place in Northern France and England, is actually
a Spanish film.  Jose Juan Bigas Luna wrote and directed.  In keeping
with Spanish film, his visuals are not impressive exercises in effects.
His film is more about people than visual images. Luna's special
effects are sufficient to let the viewer know that it is supposed to be
the Titanic in the background of a scene, but he does not let the
spectacle run away with what is actually a simple story. Bigas Luna, a
filmmaker and a painter, has a string of interesting films to his name,
few of which are seen in the US.  Perhaps the best known here is the
sly comedy JAMON, JAMON.  Following his 1996 BAMBOLA, this is the
second of three films he intends to make on the mystique of women.
Olivier Martinez is probably most familiar to American audiences for
the 1994 THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF.  The enigmatic beauty of the
chambermaid Marie is provided by Aitana Sanchez-Gijon who is popular in
Spain but best known in this country for A WALK IN THE CLOUDS.</P>
<P>     The middle film in a trilogy is frequently the least of the three
films, but because of the current popularity of romantic stories
involving the Titanic, this one is getting much wider play here.  And
certainly the film deserves to be seen.  I would rate it a 7 on the 0
to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
