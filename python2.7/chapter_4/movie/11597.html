<P>   Of all the movie titles with the S-E-X word, this one may
well be the most bewildering.  It's like saying, "What's the
opposite of 'mirror?'"  According to the lead character, Dedee,
the opposite of sex is lasting, committed and loving
relationships.  Now, then, lasting relationships may be
furthered by sexual intimacy, so the terms are hardly
diametrical.  Despite the awkward label given to this Sony
Pictures Classics release, the movie is for the most part
involving, summoning up a number of laughs at the
particularly shrewish dialogue while at other times the cast
members seem to think they're in a live sitcom waiting for the
chuckles to come before proceeding to the next line.</P>
<P>   For those who say that sixteen-year-olds are too innocent
to enter into any form of sex, Dedee Truitt (Christina Ricci)
provides a rebuttal.  Street-wise well beyond her years, this
small but endowed young woman can not only match the
vocabulary of a drunken sailor; she can come up with quite a
few witty, caustic, prescient remarks.  Movie cognoscenti will
find her particularly amusing when she discusses the nature
of film, which she does now and then as the narrator of the
piece.  When she has had it up to her bosom with her
mother's torments, for example, she packs her bag, includes
her gun and makes sure to tell the audience to mark that well:
it's an example of foreshadowing.</P>
<P>   Her story: the tough, seemingly invulnerable, promiscuous
Dedee heads from her Louisiana home to Indiana to crash
the pad of her uncle Bill (Martin Donovan), a gay high-school
teacher living with the handsome Matt (Ivan Sergei).  With a
complete disregard for political correctness she seduces Matt
by implying that his homosexuality is abnormal, accusing him
of prejudice if he does not sleep with her.  When Dedee
announces her pregnancy, naming Matt as the father, Bill
feels betrayed by his apparently bi-sexual partner, who leaves
for L.A. with his white-trash girlfriend.  Meanwhile Bill is
accused by a former boyfriend, Jason (Johnny Galecki) of
molestation when Jason was a student at the high school,
Bill's job is in jeopardy, and he is out $10,000 which Dedde
has stolen.</P>
<P>   Writer-director Don Roos is best known for his script to
"Single White Female," so we can expect him to write strong
roles for women.  True to form, the women in this picture far
outshine the men in barbs and Lisa Kudrow proves the most
amusing as Bill's best friend, Lucia.  Lucia, sexually
repressed, has convinced herself that physical intimacy is, if
not disgusting, just plain wet and greasy. The 28-year-old
virgin's views are about to invert.  Her features resembling the
outer skin of a prune, she walks through the movie
disapproving of anything and everything, as bitter as Dedee
but substituting criticism for Dedee's Betty-Davis wit.  </P>
<P>   The film tries to offend various groups in its projected
audience, but the barbs about homosexuality are too well
known by now to wound and while Roos does not cop out by
finding a heart of gold within Dedee's breast, his final
celebration of home and hearth undercuts the acerbity.  Rated
R.  Running Time: 105 minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten</P>
