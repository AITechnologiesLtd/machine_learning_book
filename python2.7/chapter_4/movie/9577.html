<PRE>THE HUDSUCKER PROXY (1993)
 A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Joel Coen
Writers: Joel and Ethan Coen
Starring: Tim Robbins, Paul Newman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Charles
Durning, John Mahoney, Bruce Campbell, Peter Gallagher, Steve Buscemi,
Anna Nicole Smith</P>
<P>"The Hudsucker Proxy" is basically the only film from the Coens that was
nearly critically and commercially admonished.  Costing about 30 million
bucks or so to make, and making about...1, as well as being trashed by a
lot of critics for having "style but no substance," it was therefore
dubbed "a failure."  But don't be fooled by all this; "The Hudsucker
Proxy" is one of the funniest and warmest comedies to come around.</P>
<P>Playing as a kind of parody of the Frank Capra films of the 30s and 40s,
as well as a semi-satire of 40s industrialism, and general blue-collar
working, "The Hudsucker Proxy" presents a surreal vision of the world of
the past, filled with the wacky, off-beat humor of the Coen brothers,
which seeps into all of their films, even if they're not comedies
(except "Blood Simple," which plays it straight).  What's great is that
this film never looses its humor.</P>
<P>Taking place, I suppose, in the 40s, it deals with a kind of dim-witted
yet hopeful young man (Tim Robbins) who comes to the big city to get a
good job, but finds he has to settle with a crap mail room job for a
company called "Hudsucker Enterprises" (the company in "Raising Arizona"
too).  Ironically, the day he's hired, the president of the company
(Charles Durning) mysteriously and joyously leaps from the top story to
his ultimate squish.</P>
<P>Since this means that the stocks will go out to the general public as of
the new year (some company technicality...), the heads of the company,
ruled by the cigar-smoking Mussburger (Paul Newman), decide to find a
total dupe to replace Durning, who will drive the stocks way down, so
they can buy them cheap.  And guess who has to deliver a "blue letter"
to Mussburger on that day?</P>
<P>Before you can say "cliche," Robbins is being fitted for a nice suit,
and his hair is being plastered down.  Enter the Rosalind
Russel-inspired Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a feisty reporter who
bets her pullitzer that it's a sham and goes undercover to find
everything out.  Soon she's posing as his adorable secretary, and finds
she's falling in love with him, and he with her.</P>
<P>The company thinks they've scored gold with chosing Robbins for the job,
especially when he comes up with his idea for the company's new gimmick:
a drawing with a circle which he carries along with him in his shoe
("You know: for the kids," he says when he introduces it anyone).  The
company goes along with it because they don't know what the hell it is,
but there's a sad (for them) irony in it, especially when you see what
it is he's actually invented.</P>
<P>The film is one of the most frequently funny films of the 90s, going for
various academic gags throughout the course of the film.  They seem to
be going for the humor they did in their amazing "Raising Arizona,"
which is one of the funniest flicks I've ever seen.  Of course, with the
big budget, it means they can improve on the sets and overall production
of their film.  The mail room is actually reminiscent of any set in
"Brazil," with its negative outlook in beaurocratic jobs, which the film
satires frequently.  We get giant sets, a cast of seemingly thousands,
and some just-plain-cool shots, and even some special effects.  The
suicide jump by Durning, and a later one by another character, is the
best I've ever seen in a film.  I think.</P>
<P>If there's a downside to the film, it's that it's just not as cool as
their other films.  Sure, I think it's a fantastic comedy, featuring
many great jokes and even some satire.  But it doesn't have the great
heart of the earlier Coen brother films.  But to me, it's okay, because
this film is one of the few films to be non-stop funny for its full
time.</P>
<P>With Tim Robbins' giddy performance, Paul Newman's deliciously cold
acting, and Jennifer Jason Leigh's awesome Rosalind impersonation, we
get a parody of the screwball comedy and the films of Capra, as well as
a satire of companies and beurocracy which is definitely one of the most
enjoyable films I've seen in the past couple years.</P>
