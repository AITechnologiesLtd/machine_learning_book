<PRE>"Startup.com" </PRE>
<P>Only two or three years ago, a few smart guys with a little bit of capital 
could parlay an idea into a multimillion-dollar Internet business and have 
their fortunes made. Docu filmmakers Chris Hegedus and Jehane Noujaim 
rolled their camera at the birth of just such a company and planned to 
follow the meteoric rise of its founders, until the bottom fell out of the 
market in 2000, in "Startup.com." </P>
<P>In 1998, four young entrepreneurs - Kaleil Isaza Tuzman, Thomas Herman, 
Chieh Cheung and George Fatheree - founded PublicDataSystems, Inc., a firm 
whose goal was to build a government Internet portal that would ease the 
public's pain in dealing with the bureaucracy we have all come to know and 
loath. Longtime documentary filmmaker Hegedus and newcomer Noujaim followed 
their group of web entrepreneurs from the very beginning, at the first 
discussion of the idea of their business to hiring the first folks into the 
company to their almost arrival at the top. The plan was to show the rags 
to riches success of their govWorks.com website and the making of 
20-something multimillionaires. </P>
<P>But, in true documentary style, things do not go off as planned and a 
variety of circumstances happen that signal the end of the ambitious plans 
for the company. Venture capital dollars are a fickle thing and can dry up 
without a moment's notice. The company offices are broken into and valuable 
documents, outlining business and strategies, are stolen. The volatile 
personalities and differing viewpoints of the founders creates conflict and 
threatens the future of the govWorks.com. Then, in 2000, the bottom fell 
out of the Internet marketplace. The rags-to-riches tale becomes the rise 
and fall of an American dream. </P>
<P>"Startup.com" is a sometimes-interesting document that suffers from a major 
problem - none of the individuals being followed are likable and, with 
their arrogance, bickering and techno-automaton behavior, create no empathy 
from the viewer. The makers do a decent job of capturing all aspects of the 
making of a startup company but they, unfortunately for the viewer, picked 
the wrong subjects. There is an attempt to introduce humanity into the mix 
by showing Thomas taking care of his young daughter and Kaleil having 
girlfriend troubles, but these are mere distractions and only serve to make 
an overly long film even longer. Perhaps some judicious editing would help, 
but the subjects, themselves, are the real problem. </P>
<P>"Startup.com" documents the rise and fall of four guys' dreams, but, in the 
end, I don't care, and that's not good for a documentary movie. I give it a 
C. </P>
