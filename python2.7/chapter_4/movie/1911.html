<P>     Terry McCain (Thomas Ian Griffith) is a cop who doesn't mind using
excessive force to get his man, and when two police friends are killed
in a dispute with a drug kingpin (Burt Young), McCain will stop at
nothing to get his revenge.  Soon, however, it becomes apparent that
someone on the force is in league with the criminals, and that the
lives of both McCain and his girlfriend Anna (Charlotte Lewis) are in
danger.</P>
<P>     A detailed review of EXCESSIVE FORCE seems unnecessary.  This film
is made for a specific audience.  Those who like these kinds of
movies--festivals of mindless violence--will see Thomas Ian Griffith's
film, while those who aren't fond of the genre will stay away.  Little
that I say here is likely to make any difference to anyone, but since I
sat through this ninety- minute travesty, I intend to express my
opinion.</P>
<P>     As is usually the case with low-budget action films, the plot is
virtually nonexistent--a nonsensical affectation upon which the scenes
of kick-boxing and shooting can be hung.  For EXCESSIVE FORCE, no
attempt is made to simulate reality in the story.  There is no possible
way that any genuine police department could be run with this degree of
ineptitude and corruption.</P>
<P>     There's plenty of action and blood, but not much excitement.  Good
films of this genre are rousing.  This one is simply dull.  Never do we
believe that the hero is in any danger.  This creates a sense of
inevitability, draining most of the fight sequences of vital energy.</P>
<P>     Thomas Ian Griffith, despite bulging biceps and an impressive
physique, has little to boast about.  His acting isn't any better than
Steven Seagal's and he lacks anything resembling charisma.  Frankly, I
didn't care what happened to his character, as long as it happened
quickly so I could get out of the theater.  Someone is trying to make
Griffith into the next martial arts star, but I don't buy it.</P>
<P>     James Earl Jones makes a few appearances as Jake, the owner of the
bar above which McCain lives.  This role is superfluous and obviously
included in an attempt to give EXCESSIVE FORCE credibility through the
use of a "big name".  It doesn't work.  Fortunately, Jones' reputation
is solid enough that this shouldn't blemish it.  I hope he got paid
well.</P>
<P>     In the past, I have been known (upon occasion) to enjoy mindless
action films.   EXCESSIVE FORCE doesn't fall into that group.  Simply
put, this is a bad movie and should be treated as such by anyone
considering viewing it, whether they enjoy the genre or not.  It's a
decidedly unpleasant experience.</P>
