<PRE>KNOCK OFF
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>no stars (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Jean-Claude Van Damme movies tend to be, if nothing else, a lot of
mindless fun.  His latest film, "Knock Off," skips on the fun part leaving
a wildly incoherent exercise that is, well, simply mindless.</P>
<P>        You can't really blame Van Damme.  No one, I suspect, has ever
expected "the muscles from Brussels" to contribute a heartfelt performance
brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray.  And even his
sidekick co-star, "Saturday Night Live" alumnus Rob "makin' copies"
Schneider, does what's expected of him, although neither appear to want the
role of straight man.</P>
<P>        No, the problem with the film is its direction.  The first five
minutes of the film are incomprehensible ... and it goes downhill from
there!  Five hundred characters, it seems, are introduced within the first
fifteen minutes.  Van Damme doesn't land his first kick until after
thirty--too late for most action fans--and by the time the hour mark has
rolled around, your jaw will be on your cup holder and you'll be wondering
why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess.</P>
<P>        Director Hark Tsui, whose previous film was the Van Damme/Dennis
Rodman teamed "Double Team," films at such a frenetic pace that it's hard
to know what's going on, who's on whose side, and what the point of all
this is.</P>
<P>        Faster than you can yell "fruit stand!" we're watching a crazed
rickshaw race with Schneider being bounced along by an energetic Van Damme.
When Schneider starts whacking Van Damme in the behind with a four-foot eel
while enthusing "move your beautiful big ass," the movie takes an
unprecedented turn to the bizarre.</P>
<P>        Every now and again "Knock Off" will deliver some truly ingenious
directorial flourishes--inventive camera shots and angles, wild rides down
gun silencers and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below,
revealing cut-ins within the frame--but they all happen too quickly, and
within such a furious frame of reference, that they're wasted.  If only
Hark could have slowed things down just for a minute.</P>
<P>        If you're interested in the plot, you're better off reading a
capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the on-screen
shenanigans: "Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer
who uncovers a Russian Mafia plot to terrorize the world with "nanobombs"
hidden in Cabbage Patch knock-offs.  Maybe.  With Paul Sorvino."  A more
accurate summary would be "Jean-Claude Van Damme bums around Hong Kong
failing to avoid large, blatant Coca-Cola product placements."</P>
<P>        The fact that the film is staged during Hong Kong's last days under
British rule gets some lip service but doesn't figure in at all.</P>
<P>        Perhaps "Knock Off"'s most intriguing credit is that Ron and
Russell Mael composed the frenzied music score.  Some of you might remember
the Mael brothers as the '80s synth pop duo Sparks; their contributions
here are as confused as the accompanying action--"Kimono My House" indeed!</P>
<P>        Like the cheap jeans and "Pumma" sneakers manufactured in Hong
Kong, Van Damme's latest is a real phony.</P>
