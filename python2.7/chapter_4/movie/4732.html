<PRE>                                 PRIMAL FEAR
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     It's been a long time since a *really* bad movie has come down the
pike, but it had to happen eventually.  This time up, it's PRIMAL FEAR,
yet another badly-titled Richard Gere-as-a-lawyer flick that will keep you
groaning in your seat when you aren't busy laughing at the unintentional
humor.</P>
<P>     If you had the misfortune of seeing Gere in 1992's FINAL ANALYSIS,
you'll be familiar with the setup.  Gere plays Martin Vail, a
self-described bigshot defense attorney in Chicago.  Laura Linney is Janet
Venable, a crass and unlikable public prosecutor, who spends most of the
film developing her primary character trait:  being a bitch.  Aaron
Stampler (Edward Norton) is who the lawyers fighting over (when they
aren't rehashing their 6 month-long affair), because it turns out that
Aaron butchered the local Archbishop.  Maybe.</P>
<P>     And before you can say "O.J." the oh-so-exciting plot twists start
coming, and these include but are not limited to multiple personalities,
malingering, a pedophilic porn video, and corruption in the church and
city officials.  Most of it is a wild goose chase.  All of it is idiotic. 
And worst of all, it goes on *forever.*</P>
<P>     What makes PRIMAL FEAR so bad?  The plot is stupid.  The characters
are plastic and all of them are loathsome, from the victim to the killer
to the lawyers and even to the judge (played horribly by Alfre Woodard). 
The dialogue is ridiculous, especially in the big courtroom scenes.  Hell,
even the ill-fitting *costumes* are bad!</P>
<P>     The only redeeming feature of the picture is PRIMAL FEAR's campy and
unmeant hilarity (which starts with the title of the film), but that isn't
saying a whole lot.  In the end, all I can say about PRIMAL FEAR is this: 
be afraid.  Be very afraid.</P>
