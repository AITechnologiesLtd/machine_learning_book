<P>         Over a decade ago, Kevin Costner cemented his star status by
appearing in two of the best movies ever made about baseball, "Bull
Durham" and "Field of Dreams." So "For Love of the Game," which finds
Costner returning to the ballpark, arrives with considerable baggage.
Will it be a sexy comedy like "Durham" or a world-class tearjerker like
"Dreams"? Neither, as it turns out, although the film dabbles somewhat
shyly in both genres.</P>
<P> Instead, "Game," which features some of the glossiest
photography since Doris Day retired from the screen, is one of those
stories in which an aging pro has to decide whether to bow out with some
degree of dignity or keep on fighting in the hope of recapturing his
glory days. Billy Chapel (Costner) has been a Detroit Tigers pitcher for
19 years and his perpetually aching body is telling him it may be time
to hang up his glove for good. Just prior to a game in New York against
the Yankees, Billy gets the word the Tigers have been sold and he's
about to be traded, prompting plenty of soul-searching on the mound and
at least one flashback per inning.</P>
<P> But rather than reflecting on his career, Billy spends the
afternoon pondering his l-e-n-g-t-h-y relationship with journalist Jane
(Kelly Preston). Though the movie insists theirs is an affair to
remember, the evidence presented onscreen is wholly unconvincing. For
the past five years it seems these two have been engaged in some games
of their own, dropping in on each other with no advance notice so they
can feel awful when they get rebuffed, carrying on going-nowhere phone
conversations and spending a few fleeting moments in bed together
whenever their schedules allow. Oh yeah, and they also apologize -- a
lot: "I'm sorry about what I said that day at the condo," "I'm sorry I
didn't call," etc.</P>
<P> Last week's episode of HBO's "Sex in the City" offered a
perfectly accurate (and unprintable) name for this kind of arrangement;
suffice to say it had nothing to do with love. The copious footage
devoted to Billy and Jane's encounters might have been easier to sit
through is there was any magic between Costner and Preston, but they're
acting in two different films.</P>
<P> Like Robert Redford, Costner is a romantic who only truly comes
to life opposite a strong female co-star. Pair him with the saucy Susan
Sarandon in "Durham," feisty Amy Madigan in "Dreams" or the jittery Rene
Russo in "Tin Cup," and he's motivated to work to keep up. With a less
secure leading lady such as Olivia Williams in "The Postman" or Jeanne
Tripplehorn in "Waterworld," Costner can barely even feign interest.</P>
<P> That's exactly what happens in "Game." Preston, a genuine ball
of fire back in the days of "Drugstore Cowboy," has since become a
curiously affected actress who always seems to be imitating someone
else. In this case, she's doing her best faux Meg Ryan and she's so
caught up in determining the proper way to wrinkle her nose she seems to
forget who she's sharing the screen with. Consequently, Costner fades
out.</P>
<P> Not for a moment do you believe Billy and Jane belong together
anywhere outside a hotel suite. Costner actually turns out to have more
chemistry with John C. Reilly, playing catcher/confidante Gus. "Game"
improves substantially when it concentrates on the friendship between
these two veterans who can still remember when baseball was about more
than salary caps, TV rights and corporate sponsorship.</P>
<P> Occasionally, writer Dana Stevens' ("City of Angels") dialogue
has some of the zing of Ron Shelton's smart-mouthed "Durham" script and
there are a few genuinely intriguing passages in which Billy does
something called "clearing the mechanism," a mental process that shuts
out all the chaos around him and allows him to focus solely on his
pitching. These scenes are also the only parts of the movie that seem to
have engaged director Sam Raimi's interest; there's very little evidence
of his generally audacious style anywhere else. James Sanford</P>
