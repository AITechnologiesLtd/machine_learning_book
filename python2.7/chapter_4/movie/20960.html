Return with Honor</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Generally, documentaries don't carry well in the movie theater (that goes
for the one's I've produced as well). However, "Return with Honor" is an
exception. Its spirit is more than enough to scale a 70 foot screen.</P>
<P>Beginning with what in hindsight sounds like pipe-dreams, "The clouds open
up like fields of cotton ... it's really beautiful," top-gun pilots talk
about the joy of flying ... and then the painful reality of being shot down
into enemy territory.</P>
<P>"I was taught to escape and evade under a variety of conditions and terrain,
and then after I was shot down and ejected to the ground I was able to
escape and evade for all of five seconds before I was surrounded by what
seemed like a hundred guns." This paraphrase sums up the "capture" segment
of "Return with Honor."</P>
<P>>From there the POWs (now 25 years later) recount their experiences in
"Heartbreak Hotel" and other prisons deep in Northern Vietnam. In a terribly
candid manner and then occasionally moved to tears (or humor), these
survivors sit as relaxed as old friends and tell in detail the tragic
hardships and bone bending tortures that just needed to be endured. Even at
their breaking points, they seem somehow to crawl away with chins up.</P>
<P>The interviews are shot on film and mixed with occasion recreations. Most of
the field footage is real -- including images of the prisoners under
captivity (from the archives of North Vietnam).</P>
<P>"We weren't allowed to talk, but we had to communicate, so we worked out a
tap code. We coughed in code, we raked leaves in code, we swept the floor in
code."</P>
<P>Some may see "Return with Honor" as an Air Force propaganda film, and though
it may tip in that direction, the genuine testimonials of these "Heroes"
transcend political opinion. The filmmakers create a work that progresses
with a very sincere intensity resulting in a rare mix of drama and fact. It
has all the soul of the Rambo movies, without the acting. Truly
inspirational.</P>
