<PRE>                                 SUNSET PARK
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This has been a bad week for basketball films.  A few days ago I
saw CELTIC PRIDE, which was quite bad (1 byte), and two days later
there's another silly one about a coach who knows nothing about
basketball.</P>
<P>     SUNSET PARK is a high school with a basketball team but no coach.
Just as happens frequently in our schools, a phys ed instructor will
be delegated to teach math if there is a need for a math teacher.
The new coach,  Phylllis  Saroka (Rhea Perlman, the little but feisty
waitress on TV's CHEERS)  is the teacher chosen to coach the team. Not
having the slightest idea about basketball, let alone coaching, she
gets a book to learn everything there is to know (it says here), The
Beginner's Book of Coaching Basketball.   That pretty much tells you
where this film is headed.   It also tells you that the players are
not going to pay any heed to their new, shorty of a coach., an ugh,
WOMAN.</P>
<P>     Of course, they have not reckoned with Phyllis'  character which
is to be the best in anything she does and  is determined to make this
team the best in the league.</P>
<P>     Aside from the unlikelihood of a pint-sized woman running a team,
the film has other faults.  For one thing, it does not look as if the
team's players are really playing basketball or are just actors going
through the motions which is how it appeared to me.</P>
<P>         Filled with honorable intentions, the film falls far short of
its goals.   Even Rhea Perlman, a fine performer on TV and the screen,
falls short.  The "plot" is too weak to be overcome by anyone.
Still, just for seeing Perlman do her stuff, the film may be worth
seeing.</P>
