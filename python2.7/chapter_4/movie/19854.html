<PRE>eXistenZ (1998) 97m</PRE>
<P>David Cronenberg's latest biotechnical carny show aims its sights squarely 
at Internet addicts and video-game junkies.  While the idea of people so 
dissociated from reality that they spend all their 'quality time' within an 
artificial environment has rapidly become overworked, Cronenberg still 
manages to come up with something that looks new.  Jennifer Jason Leigh 
plays a designer of ultra-sophisiticated virtual reality games (virtual 
actuality??), worshiped by players everywhere as if she were Lana Croft 
incarnate.  But you can't be this good at something and not expect to draw 
attention, so Leigh finds herself fleeing industrial assassins and 'reality 
activists' intent on sabotaging her latest multi-million dollar project.  
She and fellow fugitive Jude Law hardwire  themselves into the alternate 
universe of this game - 'eXistenZ' - as part of a routine diagnostic.  Soon 
they find more than they bargained for:  they discover  another new and 
sophisticated game within eXistenZ which, as players, they must once again 
plug themselves into, and....you get the picture.  By this time, walls of 
reality have truly dissolved.</P>
<P>The opening of eXistenZ indicates a computer-game version of Cronenberg's 
VIDEODROME - as a director he is well-known for his provocative recurring 
themes (mutation, the bonding of flesh and technology, surgery, hospitals, 
bodies in revolt) and it initially appears that we're about to get a more 
considered reworking of his earlier films.  It's the same, but different: 
firstly, the cyberspace setting is new territory for Cronenberg, but 
secondly (and more noticeably) his approach is considerably lighter.  
eXistenZ is the funniest thing he has ever put on screen - I would have 
never expected to see an audience having such an openly good time with a one 
of his films until now!  Of course, the humor of eXistenZ is pretty skewed - 
those familiar with the director's work will realize that they're laughing 
at the same gooey, organic gross-outs that he used to unsettle everyone with 
in his other movies.  One man buys a copy of a you-be-the-victim car 
accident game and we're instantly reminded of the director's previous CRASH, 
and the furore about the violent automobile games released in its wake.  
Even the cry "Death to enemies of reality" seems to be a lampoon of previous 
rantings about 'the new flesh' .  And if the line "Trust no one!", delivered 
in all seriousness, isn't a poke at the X-FILES, I don't know what is.  Even 
Leigh and Law try to loosen up and enjoy the game, even though Law figures 
there is something sick and wrong about it all (for this is Cronenberg 
country, after all, and cyberspace is not a spotless, computer-generated 
playing platform but a decayed, visceral fug).</P>
<P>And then of course there's all that sex, even though the characters never 
actually get down to having any.  eXistenZ oozes sex continuously, with one 
hilarious metaphor after another thrown up on screen with abandon.  Given 
Cronenberg's past history of equating sex with disease and death, this film 
must surely be seen as a kind of personal liberation.</P>
