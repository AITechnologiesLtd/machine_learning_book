                               WING COMMANDER
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<P>STARRING:   Freddie Prinze Jr., Matthew Lillard, David Warner,
                Ginny Holder, Tche'ky Karyo, Saffron Burrows
DIRECTOR:   Chris Roberts
WRITER:     Kevin Droney (based on the computer game)
RATED:      PG-13
RELEASED:   1999</P>
<PRE>                   RATING: **  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        Few computer games have ascended to the rank of "cultural
icon," but "Wing Commander" is one that has.  Released by Origin
Systems almost a decade ago (yes, it really has been that long),
the game, a self-professed "space combat flight simulator," featured
state-of-the-art graphics, terrific replay value, and frantic (not to
mention addictive!) arcade action.  I was one of the many who got
hooked, rushing home after work each day so I could resume my quest
to save the universe from the evil Kilrathi.  "Wing Commander" (and
eventually "Wing Commander II") dominated my life for several months;
I gained proficiency in blowing up alien spacecraft even as my social
calendar evaporated before my uncaring eyes.</P>
<P>        But all things must pass, and eventually the game was replaced
by newer challenges on my hard drive.  At least four sequels (and
possibly more) have appeared since the glory days of "Wing Commander
II" ("Wing Commander III," "Wing Commander IV," "Wing Commander
Academy," and "Wing Commander: Privateer"), but I never played any of
them.  Indeed, I rarely play video games at all these days: I spend
most of my life working in front of computers, and the last thing I
want to do is spend even more time in front of one for relaxation
purposes.  But I've nonetheless retained an affection for the games
of by-gone years, and when I heard that a big-screen adaptation of
"Wing Commander" was headed for theaters, I was delighted.</P>
<P>        The plot of 20th Century Fox's movie follows that of
Origin's computer game fairly closely: it's 500 years in the future,
and Earth is at war with a fierce alien race called the Kilrathi, who
in the game looked like big tigers, but here resemble nothing so much
as Hans Moleman's head grafted onto Arnold Schwarzenegger's body.  The
Kilrathi have stolen a device called a NavCom from an Earth-owned
asteroid base, and this is bad news indeed for our planet: the NavCom
will allow the Kilrathi to discover the jump coordinates they need to
bombard our homeworld.</P>
<P>        A group of hot young space pilots may be the only thing
that can stop the attack.  Operating from a battered starship
called the Tiger's Claw, this group, headed by Jeanette "Angel"
Devereaux (Saffron Burrows), their wing commander, is determined
to do anything they can to thwart the aliens' plan.  The fighters
include Chris Blair (Freddie Prinze Jr.), who lives with discrimi-
nation every day of his life; the aptly-named Todd "Maniac"
Marshall (Matthew Lillard), who's an overconfident show-off but
an excellent pilot; and Rosie Forbes (Ginny Holder), a young black
woman eager to prove that Maniac isn't the only daredevil on the
ship.</P>
<P>        "Wing Commander's" opening credits are spectacular, mixing
audio clips from famous space-related speeches (Kennedy's vow to put
a man on the moon by the end of the '60s, etc.) with a visual montage
of star-charts and nebulas.  As the credits continue, other
fictitious but real-sounding news bulletins are heard, such as the
first broadcast from the Mars colony, the declaration of war on the
Kilrathi, etc.  I loved the effect; it got me interested in the story
right away, lending a sense of historical weight to the events even
though they're fictional.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, it's also the extent of the movie's cleverness.
For the rest of its duration, "Wing Commander" runs strictly on auto-
pilot, giving us a bunch of largely interchangeable characters
who fly around in spaceships and shoot things.  (Imagine how the
Death Star battle in "Star Wars" would've been if Luke Skywalker had
called in sick that day.)  The movie never even bothers to tell us
why we're at war with the Kilrathi-- merely because they're there,
I expect.  (In all fairness, the game was equally vague on this
point.)  This was one of the big disappointments from me: I was
hoping to get a better glimpse at the culture of a formidable space
foe, but the movie paints them as targets, not adversaries.</P>
<P>        "Wing Commander" flings exposition at the audience as though
we were in elementary school.  Lacking any creative way to integrate
information seamlessly into the story, the film has the characters
speak at great length about things they should already know.  An
example: early in the film, some of our key characters find them-
selves being drawn towards what appears to be black hole.  As they
work frantically to free themselves, someone asks what will happen
if they are unable to break free.  The reply: "We're all gonna be
sucked into space, one molecule at a time."  Shouldn't a crew of
veteran space explorers already know this sort of thing?  Should
they waste valuable time talking about it?</P>
<P>        But that's tame compared to the movie's biggest blunder.
The Blair character is descended from a race called The Pilgrims,
who are despised and mistrusted by every other race.  In a laughable
scene, Blair visits his captain to ask why everyone despises his
heritage.  The captain, bless his heart, then proceeds to explain
the history of Blair's own race to him!  This would be comparable
to a black man going up to a white man during the '50s and asking
why those guys in the white hoods and robes are mean to him!  ("Well,
Billy, a long time ago there was a thing called slavery...")  I burst
into muffled laughter at the thought that the Blair character
wouldn't know the history of his own race, when apparently EVERY
OTHER CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE is well aware of it.  You'll be pleased
to know that I successful restrained an urge to hurl popcorn at the
screen.</P>
<P>        Character interaction is handled with as little dialogue
as possible, causing many of the protagonists to come across as
nothing more than walking plot points.  Commander Gerald (Jurgen
Prochnow), for example, makes an anti-Pilgrim slur in virtually
every single line of his dialogue.  Every time he appeared on the
screen, the movie basically halted for a moment while Gerald spewed
forth a flood of racist comments.  Angel, so interesting in the
computer game, never really feels real here: I didn't buy the way
she handled a particular crisis late in the film involving Maniac,
nor did I appreciate the formulaic relationship between her and
Blair, which certainly didn't exist in the game and feels tacked on
here, possibly as a result of a market study which indicated that
the film needed another love story.  Matthew Lillard's portrayal of
Maniac is a bright point, however: Lillard has played lunatics in
three films now ("Scream" and "She's All That" are the other two);
he's comfortable depicting psychopaths, and is getting better with
practice.  I liked his interactions with the Rosie character: their
constant "I'm better than you are" competitions are amusing and
oddly sweet, culminating in the film's best bit of dialogue:</P>
<PRE>        ROSIE:  "You've got balls."
        MANIAC: "You should seem 'em."
        ROSIE:  "Mine are bigger."
        MANIAC: "I've been told size doesn't matter."
        ROSIE:  "She lied."</PRE>
<P>        The movie isn't consistently entertaining, but it has a
pulse.  Largely hollow characters and a frequently disappointing
script are somewhat balanced by the movie's visual effects (the
combat scenes actually feel more like ballet than typical action
sequences).  Parts of the film are undeniably fun, but overall,
"Wing Commander" is rather like watching someone else play your
favorite video game for two hours-- you keep wishing they'd leave,
so you could have a turn.</P>
