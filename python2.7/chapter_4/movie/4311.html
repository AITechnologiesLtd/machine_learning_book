<PRE>                                    SLACKER
                       A film review by Lons Ponschock
                        Copyright 1995 Lons Ponschock</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Richard Linklater</PRE>
<P>     People in Austin TX are crazier than people in Appleton WI right?
Who knows?</P>
<P>     SLACKER is a verite style film which means it's meant to look like
it just happened.</P>
<P>     Actually SLACKER *just happened* in the mind of the director,
Richard Linklater.  It's full of spew.  Spew is a word you should get
intimately acquainted with when using these systems.  Some of it is
valuable, other of it is trash.</P>
<P>     SLACKER takes you on a tour of Austin TX.  And there are a few
way-humorous episodes in it ... the Madonna one scored big points with
me.  But SLACKER is mostly spew:  young people with half-baked ideas,
old people with fully baked wacko ideas and a bunch in between who can
hang out on the street all year long because it's warm down there.</P>
<P>     Up here in Appleton, it sounds like spew, the spew you can hear
anywhere people have played out all the ideas they have but are young
enough to be able find each other and chat about it.</P>
<P>     For the discriminating "cult classicist," SLACKER is touted as a
must-see.  So see it if you must.  It'll give you something to chat
about.</P>
