<PRE>                               NAKED LUNCH
                       A film review by John Newman
                        Copyright 1992 John Newman</PRE>
<P>Directed and written by David Cronenburg
after the book by William S. Burroughs
Starring Peter Weller, Judy Davis, Ian Holm, Julian Sands,
         Monique Mercure</P>
<P>Summary: NAKED LUNCH is a surprisingly conventional movie given
its namesake.  Nonetheless, its depiction of drug use and its
creatively obscene special effects go far beyond typical Hollywood
fare.  Peter Weller stars as William Lee, a writer, exterminator,
junkie and sometime secret agent trying to stay alive and stay high in
the mysterious Interzone.  A top-flight cast of supporting actors turn
in strange and excellent performances as Weller's friends, his wife,
and his acquaintances in the Interzone.  I recommend NAKED LUNCH for
the ambitious film-goer with a high tolerance for the weird.</P>
<P>     A film adaptation of NAKED LUNCH is an ambitious undertaking.
NAKED LUNCH, written by William S. Burroughs, centers on the themes of
drug (and other) addiction and homosexual perversion.  It is without
coherent plot, is set mostly in a paranoid fantasy, and is definitely
the most vile book I have ever struggled to finish.</P>
<P>     The film NAKED LUNCH adopts some characteristics of the book, but
stays within the bounds of traditional cinema.  A storyline is grafted
on, as are recognizable characters.  In fact, the film comes off in many
respects as a parody of detective film noir (such as, say, the film
versions of Raymond Chandler).  THE MALTESE FALCON was never like this,
though.</P>
<P>     William Lee (played by Peter Weller) is an writer and ex-junkie
trying to make it as an exterminator, but having trouble maintaining his
supply of roach killer.  He discovers that his wife Joan (Judy Davis)
has been shooting up the bug powder.  "It's a literary high," she tells
him, "... a Kafka high.  It makes you feel like a bug."  The police
bring William in for questioning, and this is when the film starts
getting very strange.</P>
<P>     In the police station, Lee is recruited as a secret agent.  The
agent-runner is a giant bug, a roach as big as a Compaq, brought to life
by the director's vile imaginings (as an oblique reference to
Cronenburg's earlier hit, THE FLY?) and a generous special effects
budget.  Lee escapes to the Interzone, an Arabian mecca wildly distorted
from Burroughs' experiences in Tangier.  The rest of the tangled and
not-always-coherent plot, you should experience yourself.</P>
<P>     In the Interzone, pleasurable substances and pretty boys are freely
available.  Lee samples all manner of narcotics, from hashish-like
Majoun to "the meat of the giant aquatic centipede."  Typewriters take
on a mythic quality; they direct the authors' work, write on themselves,
and metamorphose into secret-agent-bugs, incubi, and other obscene
creatures.  The aforementioned pretty boys are a major attraction for
visitors and residents of both sexes, and for some residents who aren't
exactly human.</P>
<P>     One notable quality of Cronenburg's treatment is his matter-of-
fact depiction of drug use.  He does not pull away from the needle;
nor does he zoom in on it, as a War On Drugs training film might.  We
see Judy Davis injecting bug powder at full length, without
over-dramatization, as if she were eating lunch.  Incidentally, this
means that Davis must pull this off without stand-ins or fancy camera
cuts; she performs admirably, although some of the audience may have
felt a bit queasy.</P>
<P>     The film is at its darkest when it stays closest to the book.
Peter Weller, as the book's protagonist, occasionally quotes a sentence
or paragraph from the novel, which is so much darker than the film that
he sounds sententious and out of character.</P>
<P>     Once NAKED LUNCH moves to the Interzone and goes hyperbolic, the
plot does not hold together.  Cronenburg's relatively conventional
spy-vs.-spy plot never really makes sense; the actions of the characters
also don't make sense.  What makes NAKED LUNCH worthwhile is the
excellent deadpan performance of Peter Weller and the off-the-wall
portrayals by the supporting cast, set off against the milieu of
Cronenburg's Interzone.  Also, NAKED LUNCH features some excellent
special effects, effects which don't really push the F/X envelope, but
which are quite different from anything you'll see anywhere else.  Do
see NAKED LUNCH, if you're not easily offended; it is an entertaining
film, and it breaks enough rules to put the rest of cinema in a
different light.</P>
