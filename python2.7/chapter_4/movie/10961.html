<PRE>                       THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS
                       a film by Antoine Fuqua
                        a review by Ben Combee</PRE>
<P>After a few hours of moving furniture, the urge to do something else
took over, so my friend and I went to the matinee of _The Replacement
Killers_, the latest Hong Kong action film to be shot in the US.</P>
<P>Now, semanticians out there will quibble with my last statement... if
it was shot in the US, how can it be a Hong Kong film?  Well, you see
that many of the internationally acclaimed directors, writers, and
actors of HK's booming film business left that country for the US in
the last couple of years before HK went back to China.  So, a film
effectively done under the same people with the same actors here is
still, effectively, a HK film.</P>
<P>_The Replacement Killers_ (TRK for short) is definitely effective.</P>
<P>I left the theatre thinking that TRK was "John Woo"-lite.  There is
much to be said for that argument -- the film was executive produced
by Woo and many of the action scenes directly quote Woo's earlier
work.  If you're into John Woo drinking games, you'd be drunk by the
end of this movie.  What the film in missing, however, is a story.
The plot is there, but its really just a metal clothes-hanger upon
which an mobile of stupendous gun fight scenes can be hung.  Chow
Yun-Fat (star of Woo's _The Killer_) plays a hit-man, John Lee, with
obligations to Mr. Wei, a Chinese mob boss.  After a cop kills Wei's
son, Lee is sent on a mission against the cop.  His ethics get in the
way, so he tried to flee town with the help of Mira Sorvino's Meg, a
designer of fake IDs.  The two of them become partners in a campaign
to take down Mr. Wei after spending most of a day dodging Wei's goons.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of the movie isn't in its poetry or its emotion.
Leave that to Woo.  This movie is ninety minutes of stylized
gunfights, and they are done quite well.  You won't see the amazing
physical feats of a Jackie Chan movie, but you will see lightning fast
reflexes and great choreography.  Mira even does a great job in her
first big action role.  There is no ounce of helplessness in her
character, just big-hearted toughness.</P>
<P>In conclusion, this is a very effective pastiche of Hong Kong's
stylized violence.  It's not filmmaking on the level of the best of
HK, but it fills the gap until we get to see the next Woo film.  On my
[-4, +4] scale, it gets a solid +2.</P>
<P>P.S. One final bit of trivia... what does TRK have in common with
Egoyan's _The Sweet Hereafter_?  A scene in an automatic carwash.</P>
