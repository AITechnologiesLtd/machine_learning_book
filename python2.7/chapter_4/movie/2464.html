<PRE>                               THE REF
                         A film review by Tak

<PRE>One-Line-Summary
----------------
    A hapless jewel thief hijacks a bickering couple.</PRE>
<P>Tak Plot Summary
----------------
     Gus, a hapless jewel thief (comedian Denis Leary), kidnaps a
bickering married couple (Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey) on Christmas Eve
and ends up becoming a hostage himself in the couple's home.  Forced to
play referee to their frantic feuding and to deal with their delinquent
son, annoying mother-in-law, etc, he finds himself at the mercy of this
All-American dysfunctional household and wishing for a "silent night"
anywhere else on the planet.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts 
------------
     The first time I saw THE REF was at a preview screening, a packed
house, filled with people out for the evening.  I left thinking THE REF
was "...the funniest movie I'd *ever* seen."  In fact, I it as my first
"many times at full price".</P>
<P>     So, this weekend, I got all psyched up after writing this review
and talked two friends into seeing a matinee on a sunny Saturday
afternoon.  Boy, was I disappointed.  I had to rewrite this review.
('Nother two hours down the drain).  I dunno if it was the non-capacity
crowd or my high expectations, but it wasn't as fun.  My friends liked
it, but they didn't rave about it like my friends at the screening.  I
think the crowd totally made a huge difference.</P>
<P>     On a better note, it's entertaining to watch people verbally slug
it out with each other.  The dirtier the fighting, the better.  Both
times I saw it, people in the theatres were laughing out loud.  And
although Denis Leary is a formidable talent here, he didn't steal the
show.  In fact, my favorite scenes are from early in the movie, where
the whole interplay is among Gus (Denis Leary), LLoyd (Kevin Spacey)
and Catherine (Judy Davis).</P>
<P>     Denis Leary is absolutely perfect.  His style perfectly
complements his exasperated, frustrated, pissed-off criminal
character.  He swears up a storm, snaps off zillions of one liners, and
rants non-stop.  And it's not really Denis Leary material--you don't
have to be a fan to enjoy THE REF.  In fact, the movie wasn't written
with him in mind at all, though it was a perfect match.</P>
<P>     The rest of the cast had their moments--the sheriff, a drunken
fruit-cake bearing Santa, in-laws that are funny because you recognize
them, and Gus's inept "...fucking waste of life..."  sidekick.  But it
wasn't the same caliber--just your normal lame-o hollywood idea of
funny.  Fortunately we're never away from the bickering for too long.</P>
<P>     The dialog in THE REF is fast-paced, and snappy from the very
first scene where we're introduced to the bickering couple at their
marriage counselor's office.  There's a slight tendency to get a bit
preachy that I noticed the second time around.  Denis Leary almost says
"Now kids, don't try this at home", as well as some speeches about
recognizing your privilege.</P>
<P>PS: Watch for the wrestling scene with the grandma: In Premier, Leary
    says he *really* got elbowed in the balls during filming.  Ouch.</P>
<P>Tak Rating:
-----------
     THE REF is really funny.  Though I'd recommend you go see it at
night, or whenever the theatre'll be crowded.  The experience will be
ten times better.  In either case, you'll enjoy THE REF.</P>
<PRE>   avoid at all costs            see several times (w/friends) as matinee
   wait for videotape            see once at full price
   watch it on cable          X see it several times - full and/or matinee
   see once as a matinee    see many times at full price</PRE>
