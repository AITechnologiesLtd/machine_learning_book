<P>     In discussing DEVOTION, a story about a lesbian love triangle,
writer/director Mindy Kaplan has stated that she wanted to "create
characters and situations that people could recognize and identify
with."  She has succeeded, albeit perhaps *too* well.  All the elements
of this story are achingly familiar, having formed the plot core of
everything from TV soap operas to Harlequin romances.  The only
difference here is that all three participants are women -- but just
because something is "gay" doesn't make it inherently better or more
interesting than its "straight" counterpart.  A tired story is worn out
regardless of the sexual orientation of the characters.</P>
<P>     DEVOTION centers around Sheila Caston (Jan Derbyshire), an up-and-
coming standup comic whose outrageous show has attracted the attention
of a husband-and-wife TV sitcom production team, Lynn and Bill Matthews
(Cindy Girling and Steve Adams).  However, all is not smooth sailing en
route to signing Sheila to the lead role of this cutting edge lesbian
program.  The first face-to-face meeting between Shelia and Lynn is
strained, and we soon learn that they know each other from years ago.
Now, with a bright future ahead, Shelia finds herself haunted by past
memories, and caught between her current lover, Julie (Kate Twa) and
unexpected repercussions from her unrequited first love.</P>
<P>     The first half-hour of DEVOTION, while lively and energetic, has a
glib tone that displays little sympathy for its characters.  Everyone is
constantly smiling, but the happiness seems forced and unnatural.
There's a jaded feel which threatens to alienate the audience.
Eventually, DEVOTION softens its approach, devolving into a fairly
routine melodramatic style with all the expected love triangle elements:
passion, love, jealousy, and self-doubt.  As the film moves along, it
becomes possible to feel for the characters, even though the screenplay
holds few epiphanies.</P>
<P>     DEVOTION is graced by the strong performances of Jan Derbyshire and
Kate Twa.  Together, they have effective chemistry; separately, each is
capable of standing on her own.  It's a credit to the actresses that
they're able to do something with such limited material.  Both throw
themselves into the work with an earnestness that gets translated to the
audience.  On those rare occasions when DEVOTION sparkles, it has little
to do with the script and everything to do with its stars.</P>
<P>     Regurgitated story and tone variations aside, one of the primary
reasons why DEVOTION represents such a dubious entertainment value is
that it's far too long.  There's not enough real psychological or
emotional drama to sustain this story for two hours, and the average
viewer will find herself or himself fidgeting through the last quarter.
Bits of DEVOTION will strike a responsive chord with some audience
members, but the movie as a whole doesn't reach the level of achievement
it's striving for.  Ultimately, the strengths of the presentation don't
adequately compensate for the banality of the content.</P>
