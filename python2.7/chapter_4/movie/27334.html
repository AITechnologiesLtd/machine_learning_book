Exorcist II: The Heretic   * out of * * * *
Starring: Linda Blair, Max Von Sydow, Louise Fletcher, James Earl Jones.
Directed by: John Boorman
Rated R: violence, language.
Running Time: 118 minutes</PRE>
<P>After the huge success of "The Exorcist" in 1973 a sequel was inevitable, and 
sadly like most horror fims that make money, the filmmakers decided to make a 
ridiculous sequel, that makes absolutely no sense at all, and to me was 
extremely pointless, wasting Linda Blair and Max von Sydow completely. 
Needless, dumb sequel flopped in the box office, and never gained much 
success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time, to which 
I agree with.</P>
<P>To start the "story" it is four years later, and Regan is being tormented by 
memories of what used to be, now a priest played by Richard Burton, is trying 
to figure out why this demon tried to possess Regan, and now the demon 
somehow wants to possess her again (maybe she was good or something). Now 
they must try to stop this demon from taking over Regan's body, before it is 
too late.</P>
<P>Some of the bad things Exorcist II has in it is: Linda Blair, she had no need 
to revive her character, and she is really terrible in this film, she brings 
it down to a lull, and in places it seems like it just stops in its place, 
and doesn't go anywhere. Louise Fletcher is alright for what it's worth, but 
she could have done a lot better than this.</P>
<P>The direction by John Boorman, is that of a confused, stylish nature that I 
really couldn't figure out. In fact, I had no idea what was going on in this 
film, the script was jumbled, the plot was jumbled, and the ending is just 
laugh out loud hilariosly bad. For those Exorcist fans who haven't seen this 
one, I recommend renting it.</P>
<P>I actually gave this one a high rating, if it were any worse it would have 
deserved Zero Pumpkins, I went easy on it however because of the fact that it 
has a bit of good direction, but nothing else! Im not saying I like the film 
now, so dont start going anywhere. Bad, Bad, Bad Movie.</P>
