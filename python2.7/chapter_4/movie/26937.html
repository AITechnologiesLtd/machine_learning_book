Yi Yi (A One and a Two)</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"Yi Yi, which literally translates to 'one-one' means 'individually' in
Chinese. This signifies the film's portrayal of life through each individual
member at each representing age from birth to death. 'A One and a Two and
a...' is what's always muttered by Jazz musicians before a jam session ...
to signify what's following the title is not something tense, or heavy or
stressful. Life should be like a jazzy tune." Director, Edward Yang.</P>
<P>With a gentle pace the film clocks in at just shy of three hours. Moving
along with serene steps, the gait simulates the pace of real life. Save for
a few indulgences in drawn-out silent shots, the film moves wonderfully
through the night - giving one the feeling of an experience rather than a
spectacle.</P>
<P>"Yi Yi" centers on NJ, a middle-aged man with a wife and two children, as he
meanders through crises in his marriage and work life. His first love pops
up after thirty years to make matters even more interesting. Ting-Ting, the
teen daughter, also must navigate matters of the heart as she wrestles with
the guilt of her grandmother's illness amidst the emotional whirlwind of
dealing with the opposite sex. NJ's young son, Yang Yang, poked and prodded
by the older girls at school, plots his mischievous revenge. Then there's
NJ's brother-in-law who becomes a husband and father in the same month; he
must field the repercussive actions of his old girlfriend.</P>
<P>It's the confident direction that instills a marvel to the film. Though, the
lovely real people with real problems to care about certainly help. In fact,
(again aside from the few indulgences by the young boy and Japanese
businessman) the film is quite photo-realistic - a slice of modern life in
Taiwan, which has the added bonus of educating those who are unfamiliar with
the Taiwanese.</P>
<P>This nice picture has a few scratches; isolated bits of excessive profundity
bubble up like bulges in a perfectly round tube. And being a slice of life,
there isn't any one strongly focused theme, though tidbits of philosophical
thought are tossed about.</P>
<P>The film takes firm grasp our sympathies, and though never losing hold of
our interest seldom evokes strong emotions.</P>
<P>NJ's wife sits at the bedside of a relative who has fallen into a coma,
"Talking to you is like prayer. I'm not sure the other party can hear. I
wonder if I'm sincere enough. (Sobs in self-pity) Would you wake up if you
were me?"</P>
