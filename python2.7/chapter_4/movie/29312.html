<P>Carol Ann Demaret, the mother of the late David Vetter, has been raising a
big stink everywhere she can about the new film Bubble Boy.  David, it turns
out, had SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency) and was the only boy who
ever lived in a bubble in real life.  While Demaret, who has yet to see the
film, is probably just another loudmouth who thinks everything is funny
until it hits too close to home (you have to wonder how many times Demaret
laughed at something like Forrest Gump), she makes a pretty good point by
saying the idea of Disney making a film that trivializes people like her son
just isn't funny.</P>
<P>And she ain't that far off.  Bubble Boy isn't funny, but it doesn't have
much to do with the way the film pokes fun at the SCIDsters.  In fact, there
are about a half-dozen other groups of people that have more of a right to
be pissed off at this dumb coming-of-age movie than Demaret and her cronies
(who could be working for Disney and trying to get the crappy film some
publicity).  India should be pointing their brand-new nukes at us even as we
speak.  Japan is probably planning another Pearl Harbor (which means another
Disney sequel to that film).  And I don't know what circus freak show types
do to defend themselves, but keep an eye out for it.  Boy's coup de grace
is, perhaps, the worst Jews-are-cheap joke I've ever heard in a mainstream
film (one can only assume the lynching scene was left on the editing room
floor). But God forbid somebody make fun of a kid in a bubble.</P>
<P>The film starts with a voiceover from Jimmy Livingston (Jake Gyllenhaal,
October Sky), the titular Boy himself, explaining he was born without
immunities and can be killed by one single, solitary germ.  Jimmy was
brought into the world "gift-wrapped from heaven," meaning in a giant
plastic bubble in which he's spent his entire life.  If that wasn't bad
enough, his mother (Swoosie Kurtz, Get Over It) is the overly religious
type, crazy enough to make cookies in the shape of crosses AND have
photographs of Reagan and Nixon hanging on the wall (maybe that's why
Demaret is so pissed off).</P>
<P>Jimmy, who looks a lot like Jason Biggs with a perpetually bad haircut and a
Dennis the Menace shirt, falls in love with a busty neighbor girl named
Chloe (Marley Shelton, Valentine), who is referred to as "the whore
next-door" by his mother.  As the years fly by, Jimmy and Chloe grow as
close as a boy in a bubble and a girl can possibly get.  Eventually, Chloe
runs off to marry some loser (Dave Sheridan, MTV's Buzzkill) in Niagara
Falls, and Jimmy builds himself a travel-size bubble to follow her,
interrupt the wedding (a la The Graduate) and win her heart.</P>
<P>Then Boy becomes one big, offensive road trip.  Or is it a
fish-out-of-bubble story?  All I know is the least offensive laughs come
courtesy of a Fabio-led Up With People kind of group called Bright and Shiny
(didn't The Jesus Lizard's David Yow used to get arrested for doing
something with a similar name?).  The writing (from debut scribes Cinco Paul
and Ken Daurio) is full of non-comedic gems, like when Jimmy meets a biker
(Danny Trejo, Spy Kids), who inquires about his strange look.  "I'm some
kind of bubble boy," Jimmy replies, at which point the biker asks, "How do
you take a dump in there?"  Certainly a valid question, but it goes
unanswered.</P>
<P>I think my favorite part of Boy was when Jimmy was supposed to be just
outside Niagara Falls, even though the scene was clearly filmed in the
middle of a desert in Nevada (complete with giant mountains in the
background).  Director Blair Hayes, who made the funny Austin Powers 2
commercials that spoofed The Phantom Menace, carefully places a shelf full
of Niagara Spray Starch in one of the shots, like that's somehow going make
anyone think Jimmy isn't actually in the goddamn desert.</P>
<P>There are a few moments that could have been funny but were ruined in some
way or another - like Jimmy's first boner, which started out cute, but ended
up creepy.  Actually, "creepy" is a pretty good word to describe Boy.  It
doesn't make you laugh and it doesn't make you cry.  It just makes you feel
icky.</P>
<P>1:30 - PG-13 for language and crude sexual humor</P>
