<P>Susan Granger's review of "BROTHERHOOD OF MURDER" (Showtime TV)</P>
<P> Truth is far more terrifying than fiction - and never more so
than in this compelling made-for-TV movie premiering on Sunday,
Dec. 12 at 8 P.M.  on Showtime. Based on an acclaimed book by former
member Thomas Martinez and John Guinther, the title refers to the
brief but deadly rise of The Order, an insidious white supremacist
group whose violent crimes stunned the nation in the mid-'80s.
William Baldwin plays Tom Martinez, an uneducated Army dropout, who
returns home to Philadelphia in 1983. He and his wife (Kelly Lynch)
are expecting their first child and he's unable to find a good job
when he's "recruited" to join The Order, an Aryan, neo-Nazi hate
group, founded by charismatic Bob Mathews (Peter Gallagher). Poor,
white, and angry, he's ripe for their promise of "a better future" for
his family. "What do I have to do?" he asks, admitting that he hasn't
read more than six books in his entire life. "Stand up for yourself,
take an oath of allegiance, and protect your family," he's told when
he visits their isolated "compound" in the state of Washington. But he
soon learns that conformity is key, vigilante justice reigns, and
absolute obedience is expected. Adapted by Robert J. Avrech and
directed by Martin Bell, this character-driven cautionary tale about
extremist groups who preach a venomous message of racial superiority
and hate is, unfortunately, more timely and relevant than ever. But
it's hard to believe that Martinez was so stupid that he didn't know
that counterfeiting was illegal and realize earlier that his "cell
mates" were responsible for the murder of radio talk-show host Alan
Berg. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Brotherhood of Murder is
an insightful, chilling 7. If you miss it Sunday night, there are
additional playdates set for Dec. 16 at 8 and Dec. 27 at 10.</P>
