<PRE>                              BLOOD AND WINE
                       A film review by Marty Mapes
                        Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>BLOOD AND WINE reminded me of last fall's CAUGHT. Both were hyped as
solid, non-mainstream films. Both took place in Florida with main
characters working the sea. Both involve a family with a two-timing
spouse and one adult son. And, unfortunately, both came across as rather
bland movies.</P>
<P>Jack Nicholson plays Alex Gates, a shady wine salesman who is having an
affair with a respected client's nanny. He steals some jewelry from the
client, and even seems to get away with it, but as he's leaving for the
airport to sell the jewels, his wife Suzanne (Judy Davis) confronts him
about the affair. A fight ensues and she gets the upper hand. She knocks
him out cold. Meantime, she unpacks his suitcase (not noticing the
jewelry in the hidden lining), and repacks it with her stuff. She
leaves, taking her son Jason (Stephen Dorff) and, unbeknownst to her,
the jewels with her to a friend's house in Key Largo. Alex and his
partner Victor (Michael Caine) chase after them.</P>
<P> Nobody in this movie is very smart. For example, Alex steals the
diamonds even when two security guards have seen him enter the house.
When the diamonds are found missing, surely he will be a prime suspect,
but this doesn't occur to him. When Suzanne is being chased by Alex and
Victor in her car, she makes the mistake of panicking before she is any
immediate danger. When Jason confronts Alex at the end, he acts out of
anger and hatred toward his father, when just getting away would have
gotten him everything he wanted.</P>
<P>In Roger Ebert's review, he pointed out that the characters seemed to
have driven the story, and not vice-versa. The result is that the
characters are more believable and they have to pay for their actions
more so than in a standard Hollywood movie, but the drawback is that the
plot lacks a sense of reward and accomplishment. To borrow a phrase from
the Simpsons, it's just a bunch of stuff that happened.</P>
<P> If the lack of a traditional story is not important to you, then you
might want to see the movie for other reasons. The music was used well.
It is dark and somber -- more sad for the characters than a violent
reflection of them. The overall tone of the movie is handled very well.
When cruel things happen, the movie is dark and closed, and when
characters are talking about escaping to a better way of life, the movie
is sunny and open. I don't think I've mentioned costumes in a
current-setting movie review yet, but Jack Nicholson was a well dressed
wine merchant. Every shirt he wore seemed to be the color of a different
wine.</P>
<P>It is details like these (plus the glowing review from Ebert) that make
me think maybe I missed something. The same thing happened with CAUGHT
last fall -- it got excellent reviews from the critics and it showed
signs of being well made, but it just wasn't satisfying as a movie
experience.</P>
