<P>Review by: Mike Summers  ** out of *****</P>
<P>        The premise of the new James Wong film, Final Destination, is that 
Alex Browning, the protagonist, prevents six of his friends from boarding a 
doomed airplane, thereby cheating fate. However, fate is not so easily bested, 
and Alex's friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances. Essentially, 
this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher.   
Unfortunately, this is practically the only clever thing about the film. As 
far as teen horror flicks go, Final Destination is better than many.  There is 
enough shocking death, graphic gore, and requisite black humor to provide the 
essential "roller coaster" type thrill at the heart of the average horror 
flick.  Unfortunately, this film also suffers from the worst characteristics 
of this genre. The relationships between the main characters are tenuous and 
their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set-up the next death. 
The scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the 
body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but 
features some of the dumbest dialogue I have witnessed.  If you are looking 
for a Saturday night thriller to scare your date, this film might do the 
trick. Other than that, wait until it goes into heavy-rotation on cable.   </P>
