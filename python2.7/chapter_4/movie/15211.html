<PRE>The Grifters (1990)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 82</PRE>
<P>"The Grifters" is a lurid, tense film that explores
the lives of three con artists and their relationships
to each other.  While the violence, language, and
sexual situations may offend some people, it does not
detract from the film's message, which is that crime
doesn't pay.  The life of a grifter may be eventful,
but it is ultimately dismal.</P>
<P>"The Grifters" stars Roy (John Cusack) as a young
grifter, working 'short cons' on innocents such as
bartenders and sailors.  His mother Lilly (Anjelica
Huston) works the racetracks for a sadistic mobster
(Pat Hingle).  Mother and son have an uncomfortable
relationship, partly due to Roy's need for independence,
but mostly due to his unresolved Oedipus complex.
Roy's girlfriend is Myra (Annette Bening), a ruthless
and manipulative con artist, who sees Roy as a potential
partner for her specialty, 'long cons' to be perpetrated
on desperate businessmen.  Myra and Lilly soon take
a dislike to each other, and tensions are further
increased by Roy's mistrust of Myra.</P>
<P>The character of Myra was the most interesting for me.
She really is a monster, and the more evil an action
is, the more she seems to enjoy it.  Roy is so independent
and mistrustful that he tries to convince Myra and Lilly
that he is a salesman, but he doesn't fool either of them.
Lilly is the film's shrewdest character, but she is
undermined by her avarice and her love for her son.
The complex relationships of these three con artists
creates tense and unpredictable plot developments.</P>
<P>"The Grifters" has several excellent supporting roles
for veteran character actors.  Pat Hingle plays a crafty,
sinister mobster, Henry Jones is a know-it-all motel
clerk, and Eddie Jones is the grifter who makes Roy his
apprentice.  Stephen Tobolowsky plays a jeweler who is
perhaps the film's only honest character.</P>
<P>"The Grifters" received several Academy Award nominations:
Best Actress (Huston), Best Supporting Actress (Bening),
Best Director (Stephen Frears), and Best Adapted
Screenplay (Donald Westlake).</P>
