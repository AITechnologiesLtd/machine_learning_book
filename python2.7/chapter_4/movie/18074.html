<PRE>     If you want a serious film, then go see something else.</PRE>
<PRE>     If you want to have fun, see Go.</PRE>
<P>     Go is fun.  Go is the kind of fun that makes you want a cigarette
afterwards and, a bad mark on it, leaves some of us wanting more.
 The plot of Go is reminiscient of a country song I once heard: "Why Don't
We Get Drunk and Screw?" except that in Go, the refrain should be: "Why
Don't We Hit Pot and Screw?".  A classic demonstration of sex, drugs, and
rock 'n roll, Go takes us on a non-linear, multi-faceted view of a drug
deal.</P>
<P>     We watch the SNAFU go down from three viewpoints, taking us back and
forth through time and space and ending up where we began.  If it sounds
like Pulp Fiction, you shouldn't be surprised.  In basic story structure,
the two films are near carbon copies.  In Pulp Fiction, it tells the story
of two hits gone wrong with diversions in between, and in Go we see the
story of a drug deal gone wrong, with diversions in between.  There is,
however, a notable difference.  Pulp Fiction was a serious movie with some
comedic elements.  Go is a comedic movie with some serious elements.  That
is why I told people expecting something serious to get lost.</P>
<P>     To go into detail about the plot, we have Ronna (Sarah Polley from The
Sweet Hereafter and Exotica), a girl behind on her rent who decides to deal
drugs and work extra shifts in order to avoid being evicted.  She gets set
up to deal drugs by two gay soap actors working for cops, Zach (Jay Morh)
and Adam (Scott Wolf) and is aided in the act by her friends Claire (Katie
Holmes) and Mannie (Nathan Bexton) and the LA drug dealer Todd Gaines
(Timothy Olyphant).  When the deal goes wrong, Ronna is forced to flush the
real Ecstasy and ends up dealing Baby Asprin at a Christmas Rave.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, in Vegas, the normal drug dealer, Simon (Desmond Askew) is
having a ball in Vegas.  He loses money, has a threesome where he attains a
new spiritual high, sets a room on fire because one of the girls set tissues
on fire as she plugged her nose in order to take a bong hit.  Running from
that, he teams up with Marcus (Taye Diggs), a black guy who keeps being
mistaken for a hotel worker due to his race.  Marcus, as a revenge of sorts,
steals a ferarri which happens to have a 9mm in it and the two of them go to
a strip club, where Simon steals a bouncer.  The bouncer, of course, has a
psychotic father (J.E. Freeman) who begins to chase them through Vegas and
L.A.</P>
<P>     The film is a technical masterpiece but a sad spot of storytelling.
Incredibly strong in the realm of dark comedy, it then tries to suddenly be
serious and ends up annoying people like me.  Look, if you're going to have
a point than have a point, and if you're not, don't try.</P>
<P>     Aside from that it is an incredibly cool movie.  People obsessed with
the movies will be awestruck at Liman's capability to capture the rave so
completely, which he does by using some of the best lighting effects
captured on the silver screen (furthermore, it does not lack the idiotic
error of seeing the Stedicam's shadow that we saw in Swingers).  People
obsessed with music will love the soundtrack, which includes No Doubt and
Natalie Imbruglia (the No Doubt song, at the risk of sounding like a stupid
member of my MTV generation, kicks ass).  People who are obsessed with drugs
will just love the drugs.</P>
<P>     The film is gifted with scenes funnier than you are normally greeted
with in a drug movie.  In Cheech and Chong, we just saw them act stoned.  In
Go, we see them being high.  Two strange drug sequences occur as an Ecstasy
double-dosed junkie imagines tangoing with a fellow check out lady and is
later talked to about Chinest nationalists by a cat.  Another beautiful
moment comes when a bunch of yuppie teens trick each other into believing
that sinus medicine is Ecstasy in the midst of a Ford Windstar.</P>
<P>     Not a film for anyone who minds drugs, sex, profanity, and the general
yada yada yada that I don't care about, it still comes off as an extreme
dose of fun for twentysomethings and below.  Just know this coming in to Go.
Don't smoke pot during this film: you get all the same effects by just
watching it.</P>
