                                 TRUE CRIME
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:   Clint Eastwood, Isaiah Washington, James Woods,
                Denis Leary
DIRECTOR:   Clint Eastwood
WRITERS:    Larry Gross, Paul Brickman and Stephen Schiff
                (based on the novel by Andrew Klavan)
RATED:      R
RELEASED:   1999</PRE>
<PRE>                    RATING: **  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        I'll admit that I had high hopes for "True Crime," which may
partially explain the disappointment I feel after screening it.
Andrew Klavan's novel intrigued me, and seemed an ideal choice for
conversion to the big screen: it contains only a handful of major
characters, a great deal of tension, a riveting storyline, and
a number of thought-provoking questions about racism, guaranteed to
stick in the reader's mind.  Granted, it also includes lengthy
passages of exposition that, while perfectly suited to a book, would
only impede a cinematic adaptation.  I knew the conversion would be
a challenge for any screenwriter: he or she would have to be unafraid
to prune Klavan's chatty prose down to something that could be
reasonably covered in a two-hour film.  Even while reading the book,
I imagined how *I* might convert the novel into a screenplay: by
keeping the emphasis on the mystery, jettisoning the exposition, and,
above all, keeping things moving briskly.</P>
<P>        Clint Eastwood's adaptation of this involving novel does not
succeed in any of the above categories: rather than keeping the focus
on the story as a whole, we are repeatedly detoured into the rather
pathetic life of the story's protagonist, Steve Everett (played with
immense weariness by Eastwood himself).  Everett is a newspaper
reporter assigned to cover the impending execution of Death Row
convict Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington), a black man accused of
murdering a white convenience store clerk over a $96.00 debt.
Beachum, however, has always claimed to be innocent, and something
about his story leads Everett to think he may be telling the truth.
Everett decides to investigate the case further, but time is not on
his side: Beachum faces a lethal injection in less than twelve hours.</P>
<P>        Sadly, Beachum is not the focus of the story, and that's
part of the problem.  I would've liked a better glimpse into the
convict's mind as he sat waiting to be executed for a crime he
claims he didn't commit.  The few scenes we get of Beachum coming
to terms with his fate (like when he tells his wife and daughter
goodbye) are haunting.  If only the tone had remained this honest
and intimate, "True Crime" could've been one of the year's most
touching and emotionally involving films; instead, we get far too
many scenes of Everett annoying nearly everyone he comes into
contact with as he bumbles through his investigation, culminating
in two well-worn staples of detective movies: a car chase involving
the hero and the police, and repeated close-ups of a clock on the
wall, counting down the seconds until Something Significant
happens.  By focusing on these items, the screenwriters have
sacrificed drama for cliche'.</P>
<P>        Clint Eastwood is a fine director, but as is often the case
when filmmakers star in the movies they're directing, he seems
reluctant to cut any scene in which he appears, even if these scenes
add nothing but length to the film.  We already know the film is on
a tight deadline, but the story is repeatedly placed on hold to
explore irrelevant tangents involving Eastwood's character: his
alcoholism, his failed marriage, his infidelities, his relationship
with his daughter, his poor work environment, etc.  I'm willing to
bet that Eastwood the actor overruled Eastwood the director during
the editing stages; why else would such a time-intensive story spend
so much of its length exploring Everett's backstory, rather than the
more time-critical issues at hand?  On more than one occasion I
wanted to reach into the screen, give Eastwood a firm shake, and
urge him to get on with it already.  In this film, he's not so much
Clint Eastwood as Clint Deadwood.</P>
<P>        "True Crime" is a thoroughly forgettable thriller that
begins to fade from the brain immediately after the end credits
roll.  Why in the world anyone thought we needed to see this much
of Steve Everett's life when the much more fascinating character of
Frank Beachum is right there on the screen, practically begging for
acknowledgement, is far behind me.  As is so often the case, the
most interesting components of this tale are rejected in favor of
formula details.  "True Crime" isn't just this movie's title: it's
also my opinion of the way this material was handled.</P>
