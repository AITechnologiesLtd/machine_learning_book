<PRE>SHREK
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>So when you're trying to choose a future queen, do you go for 
bachelorette #1 (Sleeping Beauty, who's a real snoozer), bachelorette #2 
(Snow White, who lives with seven guys) or bachelorette #3 (Princess 
Fiona, who has the advantage of looking and sounding like Cameron Diaz 
but who is guarded by a fire-breathing dragon)?  It's a tough choice, 
but Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) finally casts his lot with #3.  Being 
royalty, he doesn't actually plan to slay the dragon himself lest he 
gets his pretty little -- and I do mean little -- body toasted, so he 
delegates the dangerous work to an ugly, slime green ogre named Shrek 
(Mike Myers of AUSTIN POWERS fame), who is aided by a loquacious donkey 
(Eddie Murphy in his sweetest part since he played Mushu in MULAN).  </P>
<P>SHREK, Dreamworks/PDI's second computer animated answer to 
Disney/Pixar's three mega-hits (TOY STORY, A BUG'S LIFE and TOY STORY 2) 
-- their first was ANTZ -- takes a bawdy approach that pushes the limits 
of its PG rating.  You've probably never thought of using an illustrated 
book of children's fairy tales for outhouse toilet paper, but writers 
"Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Joe Stillman and Roger S. H. Schulman" 
have.  (Don't you love the way that the Writers Guild makes hash of the 
English language in order to ensure each writer gets precisely the 
proper credit?)  Since fairy tale characters are the subjects of the 
majority of the jokes in SHREK, their union could decide to picket the 
theaters.  Maybe you'll be lucky, and your theater will be picketed by 
the three blind mice, who certainly are cute in the movie.  </P>
<P>With its laugh-a-minute, fast pacing, it is hard to pick out favorites.  
One of mine comes from the tortured gingerbread man who boldly cries 
out, "Eat me!"  Another is Princess Fiona's great CROUCHING TIGER, 
HIDDEN DRAGON martial arts moment.  And, yet another comes when Shrek 
tells the donkey, "That'll do, donkey.  That'll do."</P>
<P>The script throws several barbs Disney's way.  (You'll recall that one 
of the three founders of Dreamworks, Jeffrey Katzenberg, used to work at 
Disney under Michael Eisner, who kept referring to Katzenberg as a 
midget.  Reportedly, Lord Farquaad's facial resemblance to Eisner and 
his small stature are intentional and not so subtle jabs.)  Lord 
Farquaad's castle looks like Disneyland, right down to its themed 
parking areas (Lancelot rather than something like Pinocchio) and 
singing dolls à la "It's A Small World."</P>
<P>I've just touched the surface of the comedic ideas that the film 
develops.  I haven't even had a chance to mention the break-dancing pigs 
or the humorous possibilities of inflated snakes.  </P>
<P>Even though SHREK never enters Pixar's rarified league, it is an 
imaginative and side-splitting movie that is a treat for young and old.  
Well, perhaps not too young since the love struck dragon -- she has the 
hots for the donkey -- is actually kind of ferocious when she's burning 
up the joint.  But, bathroom humor and all, SHREK is such a 
good-spirited film that everyone will love it.  My son's sixth grade 
class, who were there en masse at our screening, thought SHREK was 
terrific.  I concur.  </P>
<P>SHREK runs 1:27.  It is rated PG for mild language and some crude humor 
and would be acceptable for just about everyone.  </P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, who still hasn't stop repeating his favorite 
lines from SHREK, gave the film a full ****.  His favorite part was when 
the donkey talks to Shrek, saying "We'll stay up late, tell manly 
stories and, in the morning, I'm making waffles!"  Jeffrey friend 
Nickolas, age 12, also gave it ****, saying it was "hilarious!"  His 
friend Eliot, age 12, gave it *** and said that he liked the onion joke 
the best.  </P>
