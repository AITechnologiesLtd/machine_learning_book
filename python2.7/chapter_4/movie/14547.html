<P>ztarring the voicez of Woody Allen, Zharon Ztone, Gene Hackman,
Zylvezter Ztallone
zcreenplay by Todd Alcott and Chris Weitz
directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnzon</P>
<P>Darnell, Johnson, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, Danny Glover, Jennifer
Lopez, and Christopher Walken file into the sweaty, crowded Tudor Room
of Toronto's Four Seasons to discuss the Dreamworks/PDI production
ANTZ, a computer-generated movie that took two-and-a-half years to
complete. ANTZ will beat the not dissimilar Disney/Pixar project A
Bug's Life to screens by a month-that's why Jeffrey Katzenberg-Michael
Eisner's spurned (business) lover, and the K in Dreamworks SKG-is
there, tucked between some cameras and journalists:
he's gloating. Should he be? </P>
<P>This is the first time this partial cast has been together; most of
their dialogue was recorded separately. All were cast on the basis of
their reputations. Said Darnell: "No auditions for these guys." A
discussion of the liberties afforded by voice acting goes something
like this: </P>
<PRE>     Curtin: "No facade." </PRE>
<PRE>     Aykroyd: "No worries about weight loss." </PRE>
<P>     Walken: "The animators kind of duplicate your body language." </P>
<PRE>     Lopez: "I found it hard!... [I prefer] to use my whole body!" </PRE>
<P>     Aykroyd (who plays a wasp): "They got the length of my stinger
too short." (Laughs.)</P>
<P>Woody Allen was cast very early on, which meant "we could really write
for him and stage for him," said Darnell. Perhaps it's no surprise
that Woody Allen's ‘performance' is the best thing about ANTZ; the
movie begins with his character, "Z", kvetching on a psychiatrist's
couch about such insect dilemmas as being the middle child of
two-and-a-half-million siblings. Z knows there is something more to
life than burrowing through dirt tunnels. It's Deconstructing Harry
for the lunchbox set. </P>
<P>Z, a worker ant, embarks on a journal of self-discovery: having fallen
in love with an ant princess (Stone), Z disguises himself as a soldier
at war, just to see her again. (Huh?) Thanks in large part to his
cowardice, Z is the only survivor of the Starship Troopers-like
termite battle that transpires. Lionized by his peers, Z's true
identity is discovered by the mean general (Hackman); Z subsequently
takes the princess hostage and heads for the hills. Together, Z and
his reluctant guest search for the mythical "Insectopia", with
pursuers not far behind. </P>
<P>ANTZ' biggest problem is its lack of focus: one minute it's about a
war, the next about Insectopia, the next about the general's dastardly
plot against the entire ant colony. Z is looking for something
"better", and without giving too much away, he basically finds it
halfway through the film...yet the proceedings continue. Hackman's
villain is uninspired and, frankly, two-dimensional, like some reject
from Dreamworks' other military-themed cartoon Small Soldiers. The
whole film is a bit too mean-spirited, also. (With the words like
"damn" and "hell" liberally tossed around by the ANTZ characters, I
should be pleased as punch-it's the lack of humour with which these
curses are delivered that I found startling.) Also, even in
animated-insect form, the romance that blossoms between Woody
and Sharon is highly suspect. </P>
<P>What about the look of the film? Some scenes in ANTZ are gorgeous,
like the tidal wave, or the establishing scenes of the colony. Others
play out in dull shot-reverse-shot, like the non-interactive sequences
of a CD-ROM game. I wasn't keen on Z's appearance-while other ants
resembled their human counterparts (Walken and Glover especially), PDI
has toiled to make Z look as un-Woody as possible. The result is an
aesthetically unappealing creation that might feel physically
mismatched with any actor's voice. (And why is it the characters are
expressionistic while the backgrounds are super-realistic?) </P>
<P>When confronted about the competing A Bug's Life at the ANTZ press
conference, Aykroyd did some of the talking: "Different story. Lotta
heart in this one." Lotta? No. Some? Sure. Ultimately, it is difficult
to mine warmth from a story about an ant colony; worse, the only real
guffaws come from Allen doing Allen. (Cheap, cheap laughs.) ANTZ feels
computer-generated in every way.</P>
