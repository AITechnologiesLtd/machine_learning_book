<P>This review is dedicated to those whose love, guidance and support shaped 
and enriched my life. I am a better person for knowing you.  </P>
<P>Mrs. Shirley Powell: You shared your love of literature and film, inspiring 
your grandson to follow in your footsteps.  </P>
<P>Mr. Kellman: My high school English teacher. You opened my eyes to the special
"gift" I had. The purpose and direction of my life changed forever.  </P>
<P>John Lott, Lindy Oughtred and Steve Cogan: Journalism's "Holy Trinity". You 
altered my view of the world. My peepers thank you.  </P>
<P>Chris Farrer/Adrian Bromley: My partners in crime. You are more than friends
to me, you're my brothers.  </P>
<P>Julie Powell: My wife. If there ever was a choice between you and my "gift", 
this keyboard would fall silent.   </P>
<P>Bodies and minds recharged, we'd file into the ground floor music room, a 
leisurely stroll from the cafeteria. Chit-chatting, we unpacked our 
instruments. Hinges popped like fireworks. Metal clanged against metal. 
Trumpets blared. Tubas bellowed. Flutes cooed. Mr. Ford slung his jacket 
over a chair and rolled his sleeves up. The symphony of the damned 
evaporated into thin air. Class was in session.</P>
<P>Music was Mr. Ford's life. When he spoke, you half-expected a string of 
musical notes to cascade from his lips. He could play any instrument, any 
instrument at all, just like he'd crawled out of the crib with it tucked 
under his arm.  </P>
<P>He taught in earnest. It was in the intensity of his eyes as he conducted. It
was in his face which flushed blood-red when the class goofed off. It was in 
his smile when you really nailed apiece, stomped its ass and sent it home 
crying to Mother. </P>
<P>I don't remember much from music class, though I pulled decent grades. If I
put a trumpet to my lips now, you'd swear a duck got its tail feathers 
caught in an outboard motor. Am I a failure? Nope. In that ground floor 
music room I learned the committment to hone a skill and the significance
of respecting the "gift" God gave you.  </P>
<P>Man, does my chest hurt. It hit me once the theatre lights illuminated the 
joint. I stood up. A sharp pain seared my ribcage. My family quack diagnosed
it as "Gumpcarditis" (E.T.'s Disease). The symptoms are nausea, shortness 
of breath and the aforementioned chest pains.  </P>
<P>Gumpcarditis manifests after prolonged exposure to sappy filmmaking. The 
kind that plucks at your heart-strings not with nimble fingertips but 
needle nose pliers. The cure? Plenty of bed rest and Clint Eastwood or John 
Woo flicks to cleanse the system. </P>
<P>Mr. Holland's Opus pushes the hokey meter. Sugary scenes stand out as 
deliberate attempts at manipulating our waterworks. I would be in favor 
of marching the producers to detentionhall. Yeah. Dig it. Scrub those 
boards. Scrape the gum off those desks. Mop those floors. And if they do a
real good job, they'll be treated to lunch in the school cafeteria.  </P>
<P>"What kind of people like to go to work at seven-thirty in the morning?"  
sums up Mr. Holland's feelings towards his new job. A travelling musician, 
Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) has settled down with his wife Iris (Glenne Headly)
and at battle axe's urging, he nabs a teaching gig. Holland formulates a master
plan. Teaching in the day will accord him "free time" to compose at night. </P>
<P>A teacher with "free time" on their hands? This guy has been watching too
many Welcome Back Kotter re-runs.  </P>
<P>The class is a tough crowd. Holland reads exclusively from the text and 
assigns homework. His students don't retain a thing. Frustrated, he almost 
calls it quits. Principal Jacobs (Olympia Dukakis) steps in, whispering words
of wisdom. Holland drastically modifies his technique and the students 
excel.  </P>
<P>In the meantime, Holland's relationship with his son isn't exactly Ward and
Beaver Cleaver. Cole is deaf and Holland, the musician, has a hard time 
relating to him. Ain't life ironic?</P>
<P>In spite of the incriminating deficiencies, Mr. Holland's Opus makes the 
grade. Enough superior scenes balance out the defects. Richard Dreyfuss 
hangs tough as the anchor, stopping this leaky ship from drifting out to 
sea. </P>
<P>Mr. Holland's Opus is rated T for Touching. Dreyfuss bagging an Oscar 
nomination x two boxes of Kleenex x Glenne Headly - a nagging case of 
Gumpcarditis + a gym teacher who plays..chess?!?! - Dreyfuss butchering
a John Lennon ditty x sign language for the word "asshole" - MTV video
montages = a run on Teacher's College applications.</P>
<P>Outreach Rating: 9 bitter hall monitors / 10</P>
