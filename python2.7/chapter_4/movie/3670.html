                             (TONARI NO TOTARO)
                       A film review by Chris Meadows
                        Copyright 1995 Chris Meadows</PRE>
<P>Produced, Directed, and Written by Hayao Miyazaki
1988 (1993, American release), color, 87 minutes</P>
<PRE>Available on videocassette, ~$20</PRE>
<PRE>My Rating: 9 out of a possible 10</PRE>
<P>     I'm an anime fan.  Yes, that's right, one of those people who
religiously collects Japanese animation by methods of sometimes dubious
legality, huddles in dark screening rooms at science-fiction
conventions to get my "fix," complains prodigiously about dubs
(especially those from Streamline), and is probably looked upon rather
oddly by most of the people I know because of it.</P>
<P>     As I said, I tend to complain prodigiously about dubs, especially
those done by Streamline.  As such, it's probably more than a little
surprising to you that I'm rating this particular Streamline dub so
highly.  I know it's *damn* surprising to me.</P>
<P>     You see, Streamline has this annoying little habit of *changing*
the lines that they're supposed to be dubbing.  The most notable
example that comes to mind is when Goemon the samurai cuts Lupin's
burning clothes off of him in the movie LUPIN III: CASTLE OF
CAGLIOSTRO.  In the original, he says afterward, "Once again, I've cut
a worthless object."  In the Streamline dub, he says, "Should've worn
an asbestos suit."  And the president of Streamline, Carl Macek, has
stated that he will never subtitle any of his films.  Purist that I am,
I find this kind of thing totally unacceptable, so I was, to say the
least, highly dubious of Totoro.</P>
<P>     What made the CAGLIOSTRO dub all the more disappointing was the
fact that the movie was one of my favorites in the subtitled format.
It was a Hayao Miyazaki film, and Miyazaki is my favorite anime
creator.  He's done some truly beautiful films--CAGLIOSTRO, LAPUTA:
CASTLE IN THE SKY, KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF
THE WIND, and MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, to name a few.  It is sadly ironic
that Streamline got its hands on most of these, and thus no "decent"
commercial version will ever be produced.</P>
<P>     Anyway, enough Streamline bashing; that isn't the point of this
review.  As I've said, I was skeptical of TOTORO, even though some
friends and acquaintances told me it was quite good.  However, since
Miyazaki *is* my favorite director, I knew I would eventually have to see
it.  But as my concession to myself before seeing a Streamline dub (an
act which tends to make me come away feeling rather dirty), I decided
to obtain and view the fan-subtitled version first.  Thus, I watched
the TOTORO fansub one night and the TOTORO commercial dubbed release
the next.</P>
<P>     Even though TOTORO is touted as a children's movie (and a very
good children's movie it is, too), is is a film that will likely
enthrall and at the very least not bore (or, for that matter,
nauseate--Barney, anyone?) any grown-ups who watch it too.  The story
is fairly simple--two young girls and their father move into a house in
the Japanese countryside to be closer to their hospitalized mother, and
the girls meet and befriend the magical creatures that live in the
forest nearby.  But there's more to this film than that.  My Neighbor
Totoro gives us sort of a window into Japanese culture, painting a
picture of life amid the rice paddies that is filled with all the
wonder and magic it has when seen through the eyes of a child.  It's
not my favorite Miyazaki story, but I couldn't help but be entranced by
its simple charm all the same.  Miyazaki always does that to me.</P>
<P>     One thing about Miyazaki is that he likes to make references to
other films.  For example, in both LAPUTA: CASTLE IN THE SKY and an
episode of the "Lupin" TV series that he directed, a robot is featured
that looks remarkably similar to one from a 1930s Fleischer Superman
short.  In MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO there are references to at least a couple
of children's movies--namely, MARY POPPINS and ALICE IN WONDERLAND.  I
had to smile.</P>
<P>     As I've said, I was quite skeptical up to the moment when I put
the dub into the VCR and pressed play.  My skepticism began its
immediate decline when the opening theme began playing.  As this is a
children's movie, it was to be expected that the music would be
translated into English, and I was half-expecting some sort of stupid
kiddie song that would be entirely unrelated to the spirit of the
original.  But as soon as the theme began, my jaw dropped, for they had
somehow managed to translate that song almost *excatly*.  The English
singer even sounded like the original Japanese one!</P>
<P>     And it was thus throughout the entire film.  Not only were the
translations nearly flawless but even the voice-acting was dead-on!  My
friend had said to me that the voices in the English version sounded
just like the voices in the Japanese version.  And they did!  The
translations were 98% accurate--even trivial lines that weren't
important to the story were often rendered correctly.  By the time the
closing credits had rolled, I had realized that my fansubbed copy of
this movie was going to be gathering a lot of dust.</P>
<P>     A brief summary of the most noticeable differences between the
original and the dubbed versions:  The opening and closing songs are in
English, as I've said.  The minor elements of Buddhism (the religion
usually depicted in anime) have been removed: where in the original the
older sister prays at a shrine to let them take shelter from the rain
there, she now asks, "Would it be all right if we stay here?"; where an
old lady was chanting a prayer to Buddha she is now murmuring in the
style of someone praying under her breath.  The film has been
pan-and-scanned, as well.</P>
<P>     One thing which particularly relieves me is that Carl Macek didn't
pull any of his usual "hide-the-kanji-at-all-costs" tricks which so
often make the opening credits of movies he dubs look like crud.  (In
order to hide the Japanese symbols in the Castle of Cagliostro opening
credits, for example, he slowed down the opening animation and reframed
parts of the picture, and it looked utterly disgusting.) In the scenes
where a bus's sign changes to indicate its destination, he dubbed in a
voice (provided, so I'm told, by Carl himself) that said, "Next
stop..."  In one instance a subtitle is provided for translation.  As
many instances of kanji as there are in this film, I'm glad he didn't
try to hide them this time.</P>
<P>     Another thing which relieves me is that none of the names are
changed.  All the original Japanese names are still used, and even
pronounced properly, as far as I know (I especially like the way the
older sister pronounces "Totoro").  This is one more element that adds
to the general Japanese ambiance of this movie.  It makes me feel as
though the characters actually *are* Japanese, but I just happen to be
able to understand them for some mysterious reason.  Very few dubs have
ever done that for me.</P>
<P>     And now I've reached the point where, in summing up, I'm probably
supposed to draw upon those phrases that have become cliches by virtue
of repeated use in magazine movie reviews and inclusion on the backs of
video boxes.  Things like "This is a magical film for all ages," for
example.  But I'm not trying to advertise this movie; it's not like I'm
going to make money off of it or anything.  So, I'll just sum up with a
few observations, instead.</P>
<P>     This is one of very few dubs that I would not feel ashamed to show
to other people.  It maintains the integrity of the original almost to
the last detail.  The film itself is easily comparable to some of
Disney's best, with an attention to detail that Disney sometimes
lacks.</P>
<P>     If you're looking for something you can show the kiddies that
won't have them karate-chopping around the house afterward, get MY
NEIGHBOR TOTORO.  If you're a fan of good animation yourself, get MY
NEIGHBOR TOTORO.  If nothing else, rental will only cost a buck or two,
and trust me--the experience is more than worth it.</P>
