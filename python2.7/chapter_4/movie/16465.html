<PRE>Movie Review: You've Got Mail (1998)
A Review by: Ryan Davis
Rated: PG</PRE>
<P>Since finding love on the Internet is a big 90s fad, it didn't surprise
me at all when I heard Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were starring in a remake of the
1940 film, `A Shop Around The Corner.' Also rejoining Hanks & Ryan, from
`Sleepless in Seattle,' is director Nora Ephron.</P>
<P>The plot is interesting, fairly original, and everything fits together
so well, it's almost like a fable. Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) owns a small
children's bookstore in New York City, aptly called, Shop Around the Corner.
Her mother started the business, and the store and its employees are her life.
Everything is going great, until a giant discount bookstore opens up close to
her shop. The store is part of a large company, named Fox Books. Joe Fox (Tom
Hanks) is one of the executives in Fox Books and Kathleen and he become fierce
business rivals.</P>
<P>Little do the both know that they have been communicating with each
other, under nicknames, on the Internet. After exchanging e-mails and chatting
for awhile, Joe asks to meet with her. But when he arrives at the meeting
place, he recognizes Kathleen and pretends he just happened to bump into her.
Joe's life gets complicated when Kathleen's shop starts to fail and he begins
to fall in love with her. Now he has to get her to forgive him for ruining her
business and figure out a way to tell her he was the guy on the ‘net, all this
time.</P>
<P>It's a cute premise that plays out quite well. This is, in thanks,
mostly to Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's great chemistry.  Whenever they are on the
screen together, sparks fly. Greg Kinnear turns in a good performance as
Kathleen's journalist boyfriend. The main drawback was its length, it runs
over two hours. Other than that, this is a great date movie; it's
entertaining, romantic, and downright likeable.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
