<P>   "Money is not important to me," insists the 16-year-old
Dave Edgerton (Sean Patrick Flanery), a student at an
exclusive New England live-in prep school named Mount
Eden.  "My father wants me to study so I can become a
doctor or lawyer so that I can buy a big car and a big house." 
That's about as original a segment of dialogue you'll get in
Howard Goldberg's "Eden," a movie so small, so pallid and so
blandly acted that it would scarcely qualify for a disease-of-
the-week TV melodrama.  Placing the action in 1965 at a time
that the Vietnam war was just beginning to escalate
dangerously and a small contingent of young people were
considering fleeing to Canada, Goldberg seems to have made
a movie that does not simply deal with the period: it seems to
have been made in the sixties as well.  As dated as Stuart
Hagmann's 1970 film "The Strawberry Statement," about the
Columbia University riots but in no way as compelling (after
all scripter Goldberg is no Israel Horovitz), "Eden" mixes New-
Age mysticism with preppie banality unconvincingly in a movie
that lacks intensity or even a point of view.  The teenaged
students--who, to a man, look like 23-year-old graduate
students and seem to act as august as the denizens of a
British club--are forced to suffer the indignities of living under
the same roofs as their instructors while the faculty are
likewise compelled to put up with their charges at mealtime, in
the classroom, and in evening bull sessions.</P>
<P>   At the center of this insipid tale is a foolish triangle pitting
29-year-old Economics teacher Bill Kunen (Dylan Walsh)
against a flunking and alienated student, Dave Edgerton for
the affection of Bill's wife Helen (Joanna Going).  To Helen
falls the burden of caring for the house in which she, her
husband, her two small children, and three teen students
board, an ordeal made almost unendurable because Helen is
afflicted with Multiple Sclerosis.  Wearing a brace on one leg
and feeling fatigued most of the time, she carries out her
household chores and finds the time to tutor the disaffected
Dave, who develops a crush on a woman who is no much
older than he and has begun to study hard under her kind
and temperate instruction.  Helen insists that her method
works while her husband feels that riding roughshod will bring
his charges to heel.  Cracking under the strain of her
progressive illness, Helen begins to fantasize out-of-body
experiences and looks forward to her frequent naps, which
afford her to ability to soar above her disease-wracked body
and feel absolutely free.</P>
<P>   Perhaps to gain literary credentials, Goldberg uses a
heavy-handed metaphor of a wounded crow who is being
nursed back to health while kept in a cage, but who gets well
and flies away, much to the dismay of young daughter Amy
(Annie Michele Price).  To capture Helen's experience of
freedom, he is unable to transcend the restrictions of his
producer's budget and resorts to obvious, tacky special effects
to illustrate Helen's voyages to freedom.</P>
<P>   If "Eden" serves any purpose, it at least alerts the audience
to think twice before sending their children to boarding school. 
The ironically named institution features faculty members who
think nothing of barking their contempt to the kids as when
one instructor harasses poor Dave, who is sitting on the grass
minding his own business, by shouting "Get a haircut."  (It
should be noted that Dave's hair, if not a crewcut, is perfectly
neat.)  And would you expect a TV disease show to portray
how a husband's love drives his wife's disease into
remission?  Expect it here as well.  Rated R.  Running time:
109 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
