<PRE>                              PHILADELPHIA
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>     Imagine what Jonathan Demme's PHILADELPHIA would be like without
Denzel Washington as the homophobic lawyer. As it is, this first major
Hollywood movie about AIDS is play-it-safe, respectfully detached,
sometimes melodramatic and occasionally false. Without Denzel, it would
have been impossibly dreary, stacked, banal. It comes very close to being
these things anyway, but as the business card-pushing, TV pitching lawyer,
Denzel is the high octane fuel that keeps Demme's motor running. Once Tom
Hanks -- as the highly promising lawyer who is fired by his firm for
alleged incompetence but much more likely because he has AIDS -- asks
Denzel to take the case and refuses, we're in full view of Denzel's
bigotry against gays. There's nothing that he says about or how he
responds to homosexuals that provide comfort to anyone except uneducated
haters. In the movie's pivotal plot-turning sequence, at a public library
where Hanks is researching HIV-related discrimination, Denzel happens by
chance to also be there and he watches -- hiding behind his own pile of
material -- as Hanks, suffering from the outer manifestations of AIDS, is
being pressured by a librarian to move out of the general reading area and
into a smaller, more private spot. We can see both embarrassment and a
whole history's worth of discrimination in Denzel's face, which is puffed
out with an unchewed turnover of some kind. His reluctance to help Hanks
dissipates as he recognizes that there is, in spite of his bias against
gays, an analogy between what Hanks is experiencing and what his own race
has and still is going through. This kinship is never discussed, but we
can sense how troubling it is for Denzel to accept. As the case proceeds
through court, he says to Hanks that his anti-gay feelings are derived
from what most of us in the audience know are often exaggerated
stereotypes: that gays are people who wear their mothers' clothing; gays
are the kind of people who won't fight; are the kind who go after
children; are always wanting to get "in your pants." In what is the
picture's most moving sequence, Denzel watches a wasting away Hanks "live"
out a Maria Callas aria -- "La mama morta" from Giordano's "Andrea
Chenier" -- and sees that his fear of gays (and, of course, his FRAIDS) is
the result of deliberate ignorance. What is startling is that, once Denzel
realizes the extent to which Hanks -- and by extension so many other gays
--- have been hiding their sexual orientation as a means of preservation,
only to see their privacy being used against them, he charges into the
bigoted defendants with bold abandon, challenging them on their own
sexuality, hurling raw (even a few fresh) epithets. He zeroes in on what
isn't the actual legal but voyeuristic case: what Hanks, or any gay, does
in the bedroom. Denzel's lawyer starts at the beginning of PHILADELPHIA as
a shyster; by end, he becomes the Black Knight he never knew he was. Had a
younger Sidney Poitier performed the part, it would have been hokier than
it is and, much worse, condescending, gaggy. The kind of work Denzel
Washington does here, and has done in the first half of CRY FREEDOM, and
in GLORY and MALCOLM X surpasses anything done by Poitier and rivals
Morgan Freeman. And, I think, bests him: Freeman isn't loose enough in
front of the camera to work us up emotionally, and without that ability,
he's an expert at technique; his icy tightness keeps him from being the
inclusive movie actor Washington isn't afraid to be. </P>
<P>     Movie politics being what they are dictated Tom Hanks would get
the best actor Oscar that Washington should have been nominated for. In
the William Hurt-KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN vein, Hanks gets accolades
because, as a straight, he plays a role so many others would run away
from. With the exception of the marvellous makeup effects, Hanks isn't
doing much as an actor that would distinguish him. His most taxing
moments, while in the courtroom, tend to tax us as well -- we're waiting
rather impatiently for him to get to his transitional point; his halts and
self-recognizing bits of physical agony are taking tolls on all of us
because he's getting to them inappropriately. This isn't meant to be as
cold-hearted as it sounds; Hanks simply isn't playing the strings of the
violin as means by which the character unfolds, but as a means to sustain
our sympathies. One could debate the timing of Hanks' deterioration: I
don't think it belongs in the courtroom, as it belabors with MADAME X
dramatics what is already a foregone conclusion. (The jury foreman
capsulizes the case perfectly.) The cushion of safety around Hanks isn't
reassuring, it's artifice -- paralleling Harold Brodkey's in The New
Yorker -- and gay groups protesting the movie for a variety of reasons are
right to point out that Hanks avoids his character's preference. There's a
clad-in-Navy suits dance, and a kiss of a yellowish hand, and clumsy
inferences of gay promiscuity, but it's as if the ghost of William
Friedkin's CRUISING and the religious fundamentalists were acting as newly
revised Hayes hounds. Hanks has two splendid, heartbreaking moments that
grab and shake us: his battle to control, outside Denzel's office, the
swelling of the pain of yet another rejection in his quest for justice,
and, at the conclusion of the aria by Callas, when the red on the screen
returns to normal light, he has the brief, tragic handsome maturity that
sometimes comes at certain stages of terminal illness. (Rock Hudson, Brad
Davis and Ray Sharkey also showed this.)  </P>
<P>     PHILADELPHIA, of course, isn't the first film about AIDS. There
was, initially, the cable production of the play AS IS, starring Robert
Carradine and Jonathan Hadary. Next came Aidan Quinn, Ben Gazzara and Gena
Rowlands in  the double-barrelled AN EARLY FROST. American soaps have
tackled it, too: "All My Children," "The Young and the Restless," "Days of
Our Lives," and though not directly about AIDS, "One Life to Live" dealt
with hatred of gays a season or two ago with writing worthy of but was
denied Humanitas recognition. Judith Light and Lucas Haas did THE RYAN
WHITE STORY. And there's LONGTIME CAMPION, and Julie Andrews and
Ann-Margret did a mothers' perspective on their sons' illness in a TV
special.. Then HBO brought us AND THE BAND PLAYED ON, the all-star version
of Randy Shilts's best seller about scapegoating that I've thus far
successfully managed to avoid. I did catch ROOMATES, which provided Randy
Quaid with a powerful, horribly scary moment of absolute fear (when
there's a knock at the door and he drops the towels). And I caught USA's A
MOTHER'S PRAYER with Linda Hamilton really pushing it. It's probably true
that Demme wouldn't have been able to make PHILADELPHIA as a mainstreamer
had he included scenes that showed homosexual coupling, yet isn't it
hypocritical of him to shy away from the very realities requesting our
tolerance after getting audiences to cheer on a cannibal? Leaving the
theatre, I heard a woman remark to another, "Lawyers  -- they're all scum,
aren't they?" That may be the more honest reaction to Demme's soft-headed
proselytizing. The script is chock full of holes, but the one question I'd
like answered is about the casting of Joanne Woodward's husband: Is he
meant to be a liberal Marlin Fitzwater? </P>
