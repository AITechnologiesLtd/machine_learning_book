<P>You gotta admire David Duchovny on several levels. First of all, he sues his
bosses over at FOX for allegedly screwing him out of certain moneys.
Secondly, he makes use of his time off to do films different than his role
as Mulder on the X-Files. And last but certainly not least, he marries a
sweet, li'l honey-bunny named Tea Leoni, a decision not many other men would
hold against him. Then again, I can't honestly admire him for choosing to
take on this sappy, predictable and ultimately, boring role. And that is the
truth, Mulder.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A happily married man becomes despondent after his wife dies in a car
accident. After some time, the man decides to get back into the "dating"
circuit, only to find himself falling for another woman, who may or may not
have the transplanted heart of his dead wife.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Overly dramatic, monotonous, lagging comedy (?) featuring a decent
against-type performance by Mulder aka David Duchovny, a so-so showing by
Minnie Driver (who managed not to make me hate her as much as usual in this
role), and an interesting premise which ultimately travels straight down the
path of utter predictability. The sad part about it all is that this movie
seems to mean well deep down on the inside, but unfortunately for the
viewer, there's just not enough of anything to get excited about on the
outside. There are a couple of small laughs, but not much more. A few
dramatic moments, but nothing that succeeds in truly grabbing hold of the
ol' heart strings. Just a lot of grade "A" sap. There are also a couple of
shots at romance, but once again, the target is high and the corresponding
tosses are low. Not a horrible movie, but not a good one either. Perhaps if
the large supporting cast had been better utilized, instead of the endless
parade of dull conversations which we are forced to endure, the film
might've enjoyed a success on some other peripheral level. The old men crew
was especially annoying with their uninteresting card games, exaggerated
accents and attempts at being cute and charming. All of which gave my eyes
ample time to practice rolling around in their sockets.</P>
<P>Of course, I do not doubt that others out there might find some of their
idle banter to be funny and interesting, but I personally did not find any
of it amusing. Oh, an Irish/Italian restaurant...how clever. Yawn. And let's
get Archie Bunker to pretend that he's the "Lucky Charms" leprechaun. Well,
he ain't magically delicious! Boring. I don't know, maybe this is just a
film for people with a higher maturity level than myself, or those who don't
mind a simple story with a couple of easy jokes, a safe romance and a touch
of faux-dramatics. Not sure. Maybe predictability and a safety net works for
some people in movies. All I know is that James Belushi had a few good
lines, David Alan Grier always cracks me up, and that's about all the movie
had to offer me, comedy-wise. Add that to the fact that the film started off
reaaaaal slow and dramatic, added barely anything original or charming or
compelling to the tale, and ended off with just about the most obvious
ending this side of the Pamela & Tommy Lee reconciliation, and that's about
all she wrote, people. Duchovny fans may stomach it to see their man in a
role atypical from his others, Minnie Driver fans may like it because of
what she does which apparently is interesting to some people, and lovers of
the standard no fun, no fantasy, no surprise romance "comedies" might also
get their money's worth.</P>
<P>To anyone else, might I suggest renting the always-wonderful-to-watch
romantic classic, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY for the umpteenth time. Trust me,
that is one movie that does make you want to return year after year after
year.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Who knew that David Duchovny had an accident while playing basketball in
high school and is now blind in his right eye? He apparently uses dye to
keep the color right and to keep his pupil from dilating too much. David is
also known to have dated a few starlets before his days as a married man,
including such rumored flames as singer Lisa Loeb, actress Perry Reeves,
Sheryl Lee and Winona Ryder. And to top all that off, David apparently tried
out for the role of Batman in BATMAN & ROBIN, and even holds a degree from
Princeton University, as well as a graduate degree in English from Yale.
Nepotism anyone? Bonnie Hunt, the woman who co-wrote, directed and starred
in this film, graciously inserted four other members of her Hunt clan into
this film's cast (Her directorial debut...taking lessons from the Coppollas,
I see). In fact, her brother, who is physician at Michael Reese Hospital in
Chicago, arranged for the hospital to be used as a setting in the film.
Bonnie's own initial foray in a major motion picture was 1988's RAIN MAN.
Later on, she co-starred once again with Tom Cruise in 1997's JERRY MAGUIRE.
This film was originally titled DISTANCE CALLS.</P>
