<PRE>The Top Five...
High Fidelity</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Better title: "The Top Five." Of course you'd ask ... "The top five what?"
And that's just where the advertisers would love to have you. Well, the top
five most humiliating break ups for John Cusack, as a matter of fact.</P>
<P>Cusack, mug to camera, provides self-depreciating commentary to his dumpy
little life as a used record store owner/operator on the more urban streets
of Chicago. Fun flashbacks provide entertaining history of the top four
heartbreakers as Cusack tragically lives through break up number five in
real time.</P>
<P>Cusack's two loser employees (Jack Black and Todd Louiso) are hilarious. "I
can't fire these guys, I hired them for three days a week and they started
showing up everyday ... that was three years ago." Louiso is especially
lovable as the bald headed pathetically charming geek. Black is ever on the
attack aggressively defending his musical edicts.</P>
<P>But it's Cusack's cynical rambling that gives "HI-FI" it's biting irony.
Here are just a few juicy quotes. The ever so diplomatic... "You f***ing
bitch, let's work it out." And then on the human attraction phenomena...
"It's what you like, not what you are like." Then there's the crude, yet
clever ... "My guts have sh** for brains." Lastly, the nagging film-opening
question ... "Which came first the music or the misery?" (referring to the
depression itself vs. the depressing songs meant to ease/enable). Cusack
spends much of the film trying to understand why he's such an "F***ing
a**hole."</P>
<P>A little slow getting going, but fills out nicely with rough-toothed
dialogue. Eclectic music snobs are sure to have a good time.</P>
<P>Danish actress Iben Hjejle (who plays the lead female role) sums the film
well, "It's the most direct script about men's struggles with relationships
I've ever read. It really surprised me that it has this honesty and I think
it's very unusual for an American film to deal with subjects like this."</P>
