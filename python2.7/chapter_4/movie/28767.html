<PRE>FREDDY GOT FINGERED
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  0</PRE>
<P>FREDDY GOT FINGERED, written and directed by its star, Tom Green, has 
the worst trailers that I've ever seen, and it has been called the worst 
movie ever made by some critics.  "How bad could it be?" I asked myself.  
Whereas I'm not quite ready to call it the worst movie ever, it is 
certain to be at the absolute top of my worst of the year list for this 
year.  A movie whose cruelty knows no bounds, it makes the mistake of 
confusing shock with humor.  When you break a guy's leg so horrendously 
that the bone sticks out, it isn't funny.  And having Green lick the 
blood off the bone only makes it more repulsive rather than making it 
somehow perversely funny.</P>
<P>I'm one of the few critics who thinks that Tom Green's last major 
outing, ROAD TRIP, was one of last year's best and most underappreciated 
comedies.  Perhaps Green has suffered some kind of blow to the head 
since then that has changed his ability to ascertain what is humorous 
and what isn't.  Acting like he is Andy Kaufman's evil twin, Green 
insults his audience from the very beginning of FREDDIE GOT FINGERED. 
Stopping his car when he sees a horny horse, he runs over to masturbate 
it.</P>
<P>In the story, Green plays Gord Brody, an infantile 28-year-old 
skateboarder who lives in his parents' basement since he is perpetually 
unemployed.  Well, he does get a job at the Hollywood Cheese Sandwich 
Factory, but it doesn't last.  Rip Torn and Julie Hagerty, drawing their 
agents' short straws, are stuck playing Gord's parents.  Torn copes by 
overacting while Hagerty tries her best to blend into the woodwork, 
hoping that no one will notice her presence.</P>
<P>With the manic behavior of someone about to overdose on cocaine, Gord 
seems about to explode in every scene.  While at a hospital, Gord 
delivers a baby from a woman whom he has irritated into an early labor.  
After yanking her baby out, he swings the baby rapidly around his head 
by holding on to the umbilical cord.  He then proceeds to bite through 
the cord, spewing blood everywhere.  The scene manages to be even more 
disgusting that this description.</P>
<P>There are a few briefly bearable -- bearable, not funny -- moments in 
the film, but it is impossible to catch your breath them since you are 
perpetually on your guard for the story's next atrocity.  As bad as the 
trailers are, they are masterpieces of comedy next to the abomination of 
the movie itself.  Whatever you do, don't flirt with the idea that any 
movie this bad might be fun to see.  This is a film that you don't want 
to inflict on yourself, no matter how adventuresome a moviegoer you 
think you are.  Trust me.  A root canal without anesthetics would be 
less painful that FREDDIE GOT FINGERED.</P>
<P>FREDDY GOT FINGERED runs 1:33 but feels like three eternities.  It is 
rated R for crude sexual and bizarre humor, and for strong language.  
Consider it as NC-17.  This is not a movie for adults and certainly not 
for kids.</P>
