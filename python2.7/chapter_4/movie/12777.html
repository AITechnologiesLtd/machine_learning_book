<P>THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO
Directed by Whit Stillman
 A younger friend recently told me how jealous he was of the people who were
in college in the early 1980s: "All those great clubs, all that great
music," he gushed. Yeah, I thought, and spiraling inflation, student-loan
cutbacks and the promise of an unfriendly job market when you got out of
school. Happy times, those.
 "The Last Days of Disco," set, according to its opening title in "the very
early 1980s," brings back the P.M. (Pre-Madonna) era in disturbing detail,
recalling the romantic glitziness of the disco years as well as the sleazy
drugginess that ultimately defined and destroyed the party. But rather than
focusing on disco's demise, writer-director Whit Stillman merely uses it as
a backdrop for a group portrait of a handful of young New Yorkers fresh out
of college and anxious for adventure and love. Because this is Stillman
("Barcelona," "Metropolitan") they spend much of their time discussing what
they want to do rather than actually doing it, but their intelligent, often
hilarious conversation turns out to be such a refreshing change from the
usual summer movie dialogue (which generally runs the gamut from "What do
you want from me?" to "Run!") you'll probably be content to let them ramble
on and on.
 The centerpieces of the ensemble are Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale) and Alice
(Chloe Sevigny, looking like a young and streetwise Meryl Streep), former
classmates who now work together as underpaid underlings in a publishing
house and spend their nights in The Club, a Studio 54-style disco. Charlotte
is the more forthright, brassy one, always offering such unsolicited advice
as "whenever you can, try to throw the word 'sexy' into your conversations."
The slightly more demure Alice not only tolerates her slightly overbearing
friend but seems to enjoy her company, at least that is until Charlotte
blurts out in front of Alice's date about the bottle of tetracycline on
Alice's dresser, then tries to smooth things over by telling Alice that
sometimes veneral disease "is not all bad, there are actually positive
aspects."
 Circling Charlotte and Alice are Dez (Christopher Eigemann), an assistant
Club manager who fears both responsibility and his own sexual urges; Jimmy
(Mackenzie Astin), an ad agency lackey whose idea of success is being able
to afford to send his shirts out to the laundry; and Josh (Matt Keeslar), a
genuinely nice guy who's also an assistant district attorney and a manic
depressive. Alice falls fo Josh anyway, prompting Charlotte to snipe, "From
the start, you know he's defective: You usually don't find that out until
much later."
 The performances by the entire ensemble are delightful, with Beckinsale and
Keeslar particularly impressive. Of course, it helps that they get most of
the sharpest lines. Josh's lengthy analysis of Disney's "Lady and the Tramp"
as the type of movie that "programs women to adore jerks" is genuinely
brilliant.
 Stillman also provides a hard-to-resist soundtrack pulsating with such
seductive oldies as Evelyn "Champagne" King's "I Don't Know If It's Right"
and Diana Ross' sizzling "I'm Coming Out" : Do you think she had any idea
what she was singing about back in 1980?. A-</P>
