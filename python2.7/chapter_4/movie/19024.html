<P>     Just in time for Father's Day, "The General's Daughter" swaggered
onto the big screen last weekend with a heartwarming story about a
dysfunctional father-daughter relationship in the military.  If you
can't say anything nice, my mother taught me, don't say anything at
all, so I'll keep this short.</P>
<P>There's a cast of good actors doing their best with lines like
"She could change a tire, and bake a hell of a key lime pie."  That
line falls to James Cromwell, in his heavy mode here (see
"L.A. Confidential") as the General in a sober scene as he recalls his
beloved murdered daughter.  The daughter is well played by Leslie
Stephanson while she lasts -- we even get to see the tire-changing
scene.  John Travolta is the Army cop investigating her murder, and he
does a better job than the writers have any right to expect with their
dialogue.  Madeleine Stowe as his co-investigator and
once-and-possibly-future love interest is beautiful as always, but
shows few signs of acting.  Most of the rest of the characters are
colonels -- Clarence Williams III (of the original "Mod Squad"), John
Beasley, Timothy Hutton, and James Woods (whose cagey scenes with
Travolta are the best in this whole sorry affair.)  One of these
colonels is in the movie for no discernible purpose other than to be a
surprise bad guy, and you won't have much trouble guessing which.</P>
<P>Early on there's one of those .007 plot-irrelevant action scenes
which explodes and disappears without a trace.  Then it's on to the
sex-and-titillation stuff, which involves your usual
stars-looking-at-porn-with-distaste, and then a particularly vicious
and gratuitous rape scene where the girl is stripped and spread-eagled
to tent pegs, calculated to shock and horrify but still grab the
attention with a nicely backlit breast.  It's the worst kind of sleazy
cinematic pandering.</P>
<P>The whole thing is shot and paced like a bad John Grisham TV
movie.  There's heavy-handed exposition, tortuous plot twists and
connections, and material just plain too ridiculous to turn on the
projector for.  The general's daughter, a captain in Psy-Ops, explains
her work to Travolta: "Mostly we just fuck with people's minds."  In
this movie, our minds never get that lucky.</P>
