<P>The emotional trauma that one goes through to make a film..... specially
when one is new, and does not have a record to go with the resume.  This is
really what this film is about.</P>
<P>And this film is as much a tribute to those efforts, as much as it is for a
man who tried to get into film, but eventually, he could only find his way
into an area, that in years to come, Hollywood would finally learn to use to
its advantage.  Ed Wood, unfortunately,
became synonymous with the worst films ever made, not so much because of the
subject matter ( total surrealism, Hollywood style ), but because he ended
up being stuck in his own image.  And in those days, one never left it, or
so it seemed.</P>
<P>This film, is a kind, loving, and caring look at the trials and tribulations
of a film maker.  In the process he has the fortune of making the
acquaintance of one famous actor in the decline, Bela Lugosi, who is
terribly addicted and confused.  And the question is how to get the old
actor into a costume for another story, something which even Bela, might
have hoped would bring his star back to life.</P>
<P>And, what makes this film so nice, is without any doubt, the exceptional
performances all around.  Martin Landau won an Oscar in March of 1995 for
this film, and deservedly so.  The great Bela Lugosi could never get that
much attention, but the legacy he left behind was his mark, and this is
probably as close as he will ever get to the Oscar.  And Johnny Depp, tends
to look like a fifties kid just trying to make it through the 30's and 40's
and make a film.  Sad to say, that the demise of Bela Lugosi had a lot to do
with the depression and how no one could afford to go to see a film, and
thus,
support an industry.  All of the film's attention is on the inside story,
and how some people are trying desperately to make a living, in an era, when
it was virtually impossible to do so.</P>
<P>And the only material that was trying to break the Hollywood traditions of
the time ( already in place ), were the ones that did something different.
And Ed Wood personifies them all.</P>
<P>With a few bit parts here and there, like Bill Murray as Bunny ( eventually
Myra ) Breckinridge, the film plods along.  Ed Wood couldn't afford real
actors, so anyone who wanted to be in a film was going to have the honors.
Many did, to help develop the oddest collection of characters in any film,
to come up with some unusual surrealistic material Hollywood style, which
this stuff really is.</P>
<P>Good film.  Worth seeing.  A great look at the film business as well.</P>
