<PRE>The Boy Friend (1971) 145m. </PRE>
<P>Ken Russell's delirious, hilarious, visually dazzling version of Sandy
Wilson's stage play is his one film that most critics approve of. 
It's at once a homage to and send up of old Hollywood musicals
(especially those by Busby Berkeley): an ingenue is thrown into the
spotlight when the star performer calls in sick; a romance blossoms
between the two leading players; a movie mogul happens to be
talent-spotting during that very performance (this idea was based on
Russell's own experience of viewing the stage production).  It also
has the backstage intrigues of all other 30s-40s musicals, only the
major difference is that Russell allows them to spill onstage as well.
 He piles levels upon levels - it is as a
backstage-plot-within-the-play-within-the film that we, the movie
audience (and not the audience in the movie) are supposed to view
Russell's film.  In Russell's version, the plot of the play serves no
other purpose than to parallel his own storyline unwinding behind the
scenes - he is not interested in a straightforward film adaptation of
the play (it would be impossibly vapid) but a specifically cinematic
reworking of the show's many musical numbers.</P>
<P>The amount of musical set-pieces in this film (especially if you've
seen the full-length version) totals more than any other I can think
of in a film of this type.  Russell, who has always liked
choreographing his imagination to music, at last has the chance to
indulge himself for all he's worth (not that anything's really stopped
him before).  Scene by scene, we are treated to one flamboyant setup
after another - they are obviously well beyond the capabilities of the
run-down theater staging the play, but fit in seamlessly with the
film's several fantasy sequences, which is the main point of this, 
and indeed all of the musicals it acknowledges, i.e. to provide 
escape into a colourful world of happy endings.</P>
<P>THE BOY FRIEND is probably best known as the debut for 60s model
Twiggy, who had never acted or sung before but was assured by Russell
that she would be perfect for the role.  She pulls off her part
effortlessly and is ably supported by an excellent, high-spirited cast
(who were obviously tuned in to Russell's wavelength).  Having seen
both versions of this film (one cut is 25 minutes shorter) I would
question the inclusion of the Bacchanalia fantasy and a couple of the
less stagy songs.  Wilson's stage follow-up was the relatively unknown
DIVORCE ME, DARLING.  Watch out for cinema screenings in revival
houses - this one really has to be seen in widescreen Panavision. 
Cast includes Russell regulars Christopher Gable and Max Adrian.</P>
