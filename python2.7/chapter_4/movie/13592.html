<PRE>THE MASK OF ZORRO
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Douglas Fairbanks made his "mark" in 1920, as did Tyrone Power
twenty years later.  John Carroll "rode again" in 1959.  Now it's the turn
of Latin heartthrob Antonio Banderas to wear the mask of Zorro.  Whether
the titular reference be a sign, a ghost, a whip, or a son, the umpteen
big- and small-screen variants of the Zorro legend have, by now, milked the
living daylights out of the masked avenger who carves his name--or at least
his initial--with pride.</P>
<P>        While one might have expected a revisionist version of this classic
tale for today's audiences, the producers of "The Mask of Zorro" have
decided to play this go-round surprisingly straight.  Unfortunately, they
don't play it straight enough, choosing to pad the two-hours-plus running
time with awkward moments of slapstick, primarily on the part of Banderas,
which dilute the otherwise splashy, hot-blooded proceedings.</P>
<P>        It's almost as if a pre-release audience decided that this
interpretation wasn't funny enough.</P>
<P>        "Zorro, the Gay Blade," a 1981 spoof starring George Hamilton, was
more focused in its lampooning of the title character and a better choice
if you're looking for something camp.  But when Zorro reminds you more of
Inigo Montoya from "The Princess Bride" than he does Errol Flynn buckling
swashes, it's clear that the makers of "The Mask of Zorro"--let's blame
"GoldenEye" director Martin Campbell--have made a miscalculation somewhere.</P>
<P>        Still, when Banderas (or his horse) isn't acting cute, "The Mask of
Zorro" is eminently watchable, suffused with solid readings from Anthony
Hopkins as Don Diego de la Vega (the older, wiser Zorro), Catherine
Zeta-Jones (from British television's "The Darling Buds of May") as his
beautiful daughter Elena, and not one but two odious villains to hiss at.</P>
<P>        The film opens in old Spanish California, circa 1821.  The Baja
natives have found a champion in their midst, a mysterious masked man known
only as Zorro, who protects them from the money-grubbing land barons.
Mean, lean Spanish governor Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson) discovers
the identity of Zorro and in the struggle surrounding his apprehension,
kills de la Vega's wife and abducts his infant daughter, claiming her as
his own.</P>
<P>        Twenty years later when Montero returns with plans to make
California a republic, de la Vega escapes from prison and takes a common
thief, Alejandro Murrieta (Banderas) under his tutelage, grooming him as
the next Zorro.</P>
<P>        Zeta-Jones, in her first big production since the ill-conceived
"The Phantom," gives an uplifting performance as Elena, who finally
discovers the truth behind her origins.  Elena proves she can parry with
the best of them, which is why it's disappointing that her sword fight with
Zorro culminates with our black-clad hero stripping her of her dignity.
Hopkins is typically commanding as the retired caped crusader (who hangs
out in a cave like that other one), and Banderas is suave and dashing as
his protégé.  In fact, "The Mask of Zorro" fully exploits the good looks of
all three of its leads.</P>
<P>        Try to ignore the brief farcical lapses and you should find "The
Mask of Zorro" to be a flamboyant, rousing display of derring-do.</P>
