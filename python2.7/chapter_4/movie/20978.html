<P>When someone's paranoid in a movie and no believes him or her, that paranoia
will be justified. It's cliche. Similarly, when the neighbors are perfect,
they aren't. In Arlington Road, Michael Faraday, (Jeff Bridges) teacher of
an American-Terrorism course, suspects his neighbors just might be
terrorists. And no one believes him. And this isn't the second installment
of Blown Away. It does fade-in moments after an explosion, though, with one
of the strongest opening sequences since se7en, which both sets the
combustible tone for the rest of the movie and, in economical fashion,
serves to introduce widower Faraday to his new neighbors, Oliver Lang (Tim
Robbins)and stepford-wife Cheryl (Joan Cusack).
Soon enough Faraday begins to uncover what we already know from the trailer:
that the Langs aren't perfect. Which makes all the foreshadowing concerning
them a little heavy-handed, but so be it. In writer Ehren Kruger's credit,
however, Faraday's dawning suspicion is at least layered in with grief for
his wife, which is effecting his current relationship with his girlfriend,
whose presence is causing something of a rift between Faraday and his son,
etc. And all this develops more or less simultaneously, to the point where
it begins to seem this may all be one of those narratives where the
emotionally-maimed protagonist (Faraday) is only able to achieve cathartic
release via immersion in some high-tension storyline.
But it's not.
At it's most basic level it's closer to another narrative, most recently
commercialized in Sleepers : the criminal initially getting away with the
crime, then somewhere down the road encountering one of his victims wholly
by chance, who metes out justice. But too, and in spite of its cast,
Sleepers was a failure. Arlington Road isn't, again thanks to strong
writing, to the fact that Oliver Lang isn't directly implicated in the death
of Faraday's wife, but is instead simply identified as the type whose file
gets flagged by the FBI. Faraday's wife died investigating such a flag.
Constructing it this way you get the association without the causality,
which--because not dependent upon serendipity--is even stronger. Meaning we
wholly expect Faraday to mete out some long-overdue justice to Lang, which
is right where Kruger wants us: these carefully cultured expectations allow
Arlington Road to use less contrivance to turn everything upside down, which
it does very effectively in the closing frames. And quietly.
The thing is, in a movie about bombs, the plot's about subtlety. Not just
the inevitable surprise we've come to anticipate, but a development which
forces us to reconstruct the whole movie scene by scene. Which is rarely
done well. Even rarer is that, in retrospect, (and disregarding the opening
sequence) every prior event is open to dual interpretation. Perhaps it was
Mark Pellington's unobtrusive camerawork that eased our suspicions; perhaps
it was simply Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges on-screen together, never a
mistimed delivery or stray eyebrow between them. Either way, Arlington Road
is far and away the best college-professor-just-trying-to-get-out-alive
movie since D.O.A., though it is loyal to it all the same.</P>
