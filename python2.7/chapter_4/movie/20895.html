<PRE>Misfire
The General's Daughter</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>John Travolta plays Paul Brenner, a cocky military investigator shaking up
the top brass after the General's Daughter turns up dead. It's the type of
role Bruce Willis would have loved. That's not to say John isn't
commanding -- he is; it's just that the rest of the movie isn't commanding
around him. And I'm a little more comfortable when that happens to Bruce
Willis (sorry Bruce).</P>
<P>An intriguing premise, Capt. Elizabeth Campbell (the daughter of General
Campbell) is found strangled and apparently raped. Soon after, Brenner
uncovers her secret life of freaky sex with enlisted men. Not surprisingly,
no one at the base appreciates the investigation.</P>
<P>Loaded with a cartridge of high powered actors: Travolta, Hutton, Cromwell,
Woods ... "The General's Daughter" has a poorly aligned barrel. Though a few
scenes were shot well, hitting their targets hard -- too many shells sail
way wide. The rough dialogue is, in part, responsible. When the murderer is
finally found our investigators ask the stupidest question --"Why'd you do
it?" to which they get a well deserved response, "[You're so smart.] You
tell me." (Eek). Secondly, not all the big names deliver big. Cromwell isn't
his normal self. He's a fine actor, although his performance in this film
lacks substance. Hutton isn't spectacular either.</P>
<P>The strongest scenes, condescending and clever, pit the egos of Woods and
Travolta head on and center. Nearly too clever, these scenes destroy their
targets anyway. Woods is wonderful.</P>
<P>Still, the DNA bluff sequence that attacked my modest (yet innocent)
intelligence, along with a few other faulted scenes leave this decent and
respectable story line nearly as overpowered and helpless as its own rape
victim.</P>
<P>Starring John Travolta, Madeleine Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton,
James Woods and Clarence WIlliams III.
Directed by Simon West.
Screenplay by Christopher Bertolini & William Goldman.
Produced by Mace Neufeld at Paramount/Rehme/Krane.</P>
