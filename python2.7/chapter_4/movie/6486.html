<P>     Henry Koster's 1947 release, THE BISHOP'S WIFE, earned Academy 
Award Nominations for both Best Picture and Best Director.  Starring 
Cary Grant as an angel sent to earth to aid a struggling cleric, the 
film, which combines elements of Charles Dickens' A CHRISTMAS CAROL and 
Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, is a typical, feel-good, Christmas 
offering.  It's a lighthearted fantasy that works well enough on its own 
terms, but, by today's standards, seems rather dated.  </P>
<P>     Nearly fifty years after THE BISHOP'S WIFE first reached theater 
screens, director Penny Marshall has decided to revamp the story and 
make a new movie.  Using the bare bones plot structure from the 
original, she and screenwriters Nat Mauldin and Allan Scott have brought 
the characters and situations into the nineties, simultaneously 
transforming an all-white cast into an all-black one.  The result is THE 
PREACHER'S WIFE, a surefire seasonal hit (despite the overlong running 
time).  And, with Disney behind the production, you can be sure that the 
merchandising (most notably the soundtrack) will threaten to dwarf the 
in-theater experience.</P>
<P>     Marshall is probably the ideal film maker to attempt this kind of 
remake.  After all, her directorial trademark is the happy ending.  Even 
her best films (BIG and A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN) have moments of almost-
sickening sweetness.  THE PREACHER'S WIFE milks that quality for all 
it's worth.  Those looking for something truly uplifting will find more 
than they could possibly want in this movie.  Creatively, however, it's 
on shaky ground.  Beneath the warm sentiments and likable personalities, 
THE PREACHER'S WIFE is rather trite.</P>
<P>     I think I would probably react the same way if someone produced a 
passable remake of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  I enjoy that film immensely, 
but my affinity for it results largely from a nostalgia for the period 
during which it was made and in which it transpires.  A modernized 
version of Capra's movie would lack that crucial quality, and, 
consequently, the viewing experience would suffer.  Much the same can be 
said about THE PREACHER'S WIFE.  It has better production values than 
its predecessor, but the intangibles aren't the same.  An element of the 
magic is missing.</P>
<P>     Courtney B. Vance gives a strong performance as Reverend Henry 
Biggs, the pastor of St. Matthew's Church in Newark, N.J.  When 
financial difficulties arise, Henry prays for help.  God's answer is to 
send an angel named Dudley (Denzel Washington in his lightest role since 
MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING) to Earth to assist him.  However, when Dudley 
approaches the pastor with the truth about his identity, Henry is 
understandably skeptical.  That doesn't stop the angel, whose mission is 
not only to help St. Matthew's through a rough time, but to restore the 
preacher's dwindling faith.  Complications arise, however, when Henry's 
wife, Julia (Whitney Houston), develops an attraction for Dudley, who 
offers her kindness and compassion in place of her husband's abstracted 
indifference.</P>
<P>     Despite having two hit movies behind her (THE BODYGUARD, WAITING TO 
EXHALE), Whitney Houston is far from an accomplished thespian.  In her 
defense, her acting skills have improved, but she's still out of her 
depth in the company of performers like Washington and Vance.  She does 
a lot of singing in this movie -- enough, in fact, that it could almost 
qualify as a musical -- but those are the only scenes when her natural 
charisma and energy translate to the screen.</P>
<P>     Besides Houston, the cast includes two other WAITING TO EXHALE 
alumni.  The first is Gregory Hines, who plays an upper-class wheeler-
dealer type ("he's so oily you could fry chicken on his smile").  The 
second is Loretta Devine, who sparkles as Henry's hyperactive secretary.  
The real scene-stealer, however, is Jenifer Lewis as Julia's mother, 
Marguerite.  She's a delightful presence, and her delivery of several 
biting one-liners almost manages to give THE PREACHER'S WIFE the 
semblance of an edge.</P>
<P>     The uplifting moral here is that miracles can happen for those who 
believe.  THE PREACHER'S WIFE is about reclaiming lost faith and 
spreading the message of love.  These are themes common to almost every 
beloved holiday classic.  So, as a Christmas film, THE PREACHER'S WIFE 
has all the right sentiments, and presses the expected buttons.  On the 
other hand (call me a Scrooge if you will), I'm not sure I'd want to see 
this movie at any other time of the year.  If not for the pervasive 
spirit of the season, something like this could easily send me into 
sugar shock.  It's a little too nice and happy.</P>
