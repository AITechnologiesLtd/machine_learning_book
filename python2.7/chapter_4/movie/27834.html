BEFORE NIGHT FALLS</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Julian Schnabel</PRE>
<PRE>De Vargas    R     134 min</PRE>
<P>     This is the second feature by the successful painter Julian 
Schnabel (Basquiat).  Both have been biographies of minority artists who 
suffered grievously and died young, both have been visually and 
stylistically bold, both have been self-indulgent, chaotic, and often 
tedious.</P>
<P>     Before Night Falls is based on the autobiography of Reinaldo 
Arenas, the Cuban poet and novelist who was hounded by the Castro 
government for his homosexuality and his writing.  He was surprisingly 
prolific at both.  He boasted of having bedded 5,000 men by the age of 
25 (and after that he was in prison where the opportunities can't have 
slackened much), and despite his years behind bars and the relentless 
censorship he turned out over 20 books before his premature death of 
AIDS in New York at 48. </P>
<P>     Central to the critical success this picture has enjoyed is the 
Oscar-nominated performance of  Spaniard Javier Bardem (Jamon, Jamon) as 
Arenas.  Bardem does a remarkable job of taking the character from 
exuberant youth to sickly middle age, and he animates him with a cocky, 
jaded innocence.  But as Best Actor material his credentials have as 
much to do with screen time as with interpretation.  The shortfall is to 
a large extent the fault of the movie's structure, which dulls the 
telling with repetitiveness and confusion.</P>
<P>     Some of the confusion comes from the accents.  The movie is spoken 
primarily in a thickly-accented English which is supposed to be Spanish, 
and which is sometimes incomprehensible to the American ear.  Confusing 
matters further are occasional passages spoken in Spanish, the same 
Spanish they're speaking when they're speaking English, if you follow my 
drift.  At least the Spanish Spanish is subtitled, which makes it easier 
to understand. </P>
<P>     Schnabel begins his tale with the baby Reinaldo, playing 
bare-fannied in the dirt in his little village, as the adult Reinaldo 
fondly recalls in voice-over "a childhood of absolute poverty and 
absolute freedom."  He grows up, discovers his writer's gift and his 
homosexuality, and proceeds to write and fornicate until he's thrown in 
jail on trumped-up charges by the revolutionary regime, whereupon he 
continues to do both anyway.  Eventually he gets out of Cuba when Castro 
empties the country of "undesirables" and ships them to Miami.</P>
<P>     There is an extraordinary cameo by Johnny Depp as a 
manuscript-smuggling transvestite, muddied by another cameo by Johnny 
Depp as a military officer, also well played but confusing -- you wonder 
if it's supposed to be the same guy leading a double life.  Sean Penn 
also contributes a barely recognizable cameo as a gold-toothed wagon 
driver.</P>
<P>     Schnabel and cinematographers Xavier Perez Grobet and Guillermo 
Rosas come up with some stunning visuals, and the film's condemnation of 
the repressiveness of  the Castro revolution is damning and disturbing, 
but the movie churns and spins its wheels in an orgy of stylistic muck, 
and never gets up to the speed the story requires.</P>
