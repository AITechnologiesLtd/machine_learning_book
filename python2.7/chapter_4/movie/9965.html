<PRE>The Rainmaker:</PRE>
<P>If there is one thing we can expect from a movie based on a John
Grisham novel it's star power. Tom Cruise , Julia Roberts , Gene Hackman
and Sandra Bullock have each had their turn portraying a John Grisham
character. Therefore it comes as a pleasant surprise that The Rainmaker
offers a cast of relative unknowns and some little seen actors. </P>
<P>There is a lesson here: just because an actor costs 20 million it does
not mean he's worth his weight in gold. The cast of The Rainmaker is
like a breath of fresh air from a bunch of fresh faces. Matt Damon
donates a wonderful performance which will most likely kick his career
into overdrive. Heroic yet flawed , he is an imperfect hero , and
underdog for the audience to cheer for.</P>
<P>Mickey Rourke offers his usual quiet intensity and makes the most of
his five minutes of screen time. Clare Danes is the love interest /
battered wife / useless sub-plot only in the movie because people cannot
watch an entire movie without at least one scene of violence. </P>
<P>Still , she is cute as a button so we can forgive our hero for
indulging his "knight in shining armor" side. Danny Devito is comic
relief , something that was missing from previous Grisham movies , Jon
Voight is incredibly sleazy , as usual. That's just the main cast ,
let's not forget an incredible supporting cast.</P>
<P>Danny Glover , Roy Schneider , the dying boy and his father whose names
i forget. Not one bad performance during the entire movie. Like in all
John Grisham movies the bad guys are , well , bad. First it was sleazy
lawyers , then a corrupt government and rapists...now we have insurance
companies. Ooooohh , my skin crawls at the mention of the name. </P>
<P>It is always a good sign when viewers actually boo the bad guys. It
means we actually give a damn about their actions and the consequences
of these. Luckily , we have a lawyer fresh out of law school and an
assistant who flunked the class six times on the side of all that is
good and mom's apple pie. </P>
<P>Shit. We're screwed. 
Actually they...well i won't give away the ending but it certainly
makes you hate the insurance companies even more. All in all , an
enjoyable movie with a dynamite cast...a cast that probably cost less
than two or three of those bugs in Starship Troopers.</P>
