<P>"Rebel Without a Cause" is such an important film in American history because
it is a true analysis of youth in America that everyone of all ages can relate
to. Everyone feels that they are different in some way, that they don't belong
in some places and "Rebel Without a Cause" successfully shows on screen these
universal emotions. No matter what generation you belong to, these feelings are
present. This is why James Dean is admired by America, because in this film he
represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute. In
our minds, we just try to do the right thing just like Dean's Jim Stark does.</P>
<P>Not only does "Rebel Without a Cause" display these universal emotions for all
to relate to but it also shows that America has suffered a uniqe pattern in its
social structure. Each generation looks at its past generation without a strong
connection. This is because times change and in response people change. No
matter how popular you were once, as your generation grows older, newer breeds
look at you in a different light. This is why Stark and his friends never could
form a strong relationship with their parents. Even if their parents insisted
that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past, the teens could not
believe this. In one humorous scene, Stark, his girlfriend Judy (Natalie Wood),
and his pal Plato (Sal Mineo) pretend they are adults. They use upper class
British accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids
are no good and should be ignored. This scene shows that what was once cool in
a past generation is the complete opposite in another. Speaking on behalf of my
generation, I feel that Dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our
perspective as the years have grown by.  The only ones who seem to still
lionize him are those members of his generation.Same goes for Brando, Redford,
even Deniro. I can only imagine how vaguely Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Brad
Pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century. Will Dean
even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten?</P>
<P>Any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in American
film. Even if "Rebel Without a Cause" has some ridiculous scenes (the game of
chicken - did people really act this way?), an unbelievable conclusion (how did
everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end?), and a silly romance
(Wood declares her love for Dean after talking to him for a couple hours) it
still is a fabulous film. The acting is so believable that it is no wonder that
Dean was considered the epitome of cool. Now, however, the coolness is
fading...</P>
