<PRE>PATCH ADAMS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>In Patch Adams, Robin Williams portrays a real-life doctor struggling to
reform the impersonal medical system with a human touch.  It's a good
premise, and Williams seems to be perfect for the role...perhaps a bit
too perfect. The film is nothing if not emotionally manipulative, and at
times it gets downright irritating to be pushed around so much.</P>
<P>Hunter Adams (Robin Williams) has been suicidally depressed.  The
pointlessness of his life has driven him to the brink, and he finally
checks himself into a mental hospital.  While there, he observes the
detached soulessness of the medical staff, and discovers a purpose for
his own life.</P>
<P>Sporting the new nickname, "Patch", he enrolls in med school.  He
desires nothing more than to connect with people in need, and to help
them out as best as he can.  To this end, he enlists the aid of fellow
students, Carin (Monica Potter) and Truman (Daniel London) to bring
humor and enjoyment into the lives of patients at the local hospital.</P>
<P>But, Patch's unique methods have their detractors.  Patch's study-minded
roommate Mitch (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is frustrated with his
anti-studious attitudes. But the biggest obstacle in Patch's way is Dean
Walcott (Bob Gunton), who sees his actions as a challenge to the medical
establishment, and is willing to prevent Patch from graduating in order
to protect that establishment.</P>
<P>The movie, Patch Adams, is shamelessly manipulative.  It trots out not
just one, but a whole hospital full of sick kids and adults to elicit
sympathy and tears from the audience, while Robin Williams' antic
schtick counterbalances it with laughter.  The ploy partially works:
the film is slightly moving, and slightly amusing.  But it might have
been more so it the manipulation weren't so blatant as to be
distracting.  By the time the film reaches its final "clown salute",
you're half-ready to strangle Robin Williams just to wrap it up!</P>
<P>The role of Patch Adams seems custom tailored for Robin Williams.  First
of all, he's given several moments for "improv" comedy (most of which
are too awkwardly staged to be more than mildly amusing).  Then, the
role has some dramatic heft, as Patch Adams is coping with his own
depression (as well as the depression of others).  Plus, the role is
brimming with plenty of touchy-feely "warm-and-fuzzies" (which Williams
has lately specialized in delivering).  And for the most part, Williams
plays it well.  However, "Patch Adams" is never fully realized as a
character... it's always Robin Williams playing a doctor.  He never
disappears into the role.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is colorful, and mostly enjoyable to watch. The
thorn in the works is Bob Gunton, whose Dean Walcott is so irrationally
mean and dour that he seems like a movie device, rather than a real
person.</P>
<P>All of this is not to say Patch Adams is a bad film.  It is merely one
that not only wears its heart on its sleeve, but has a prominent
exoskeleton too.  If you can overlook the obvious machinery churning
away to produce the next emotion filled "moment", the film can be
moving.  It just requires a lot of concentration to ignore all of that
grinding machinery.</P>
