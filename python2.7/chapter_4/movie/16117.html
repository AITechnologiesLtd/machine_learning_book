<P>Mighty Joe Young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we
actually get to see a great big gorilla.  His entrance, however, is a
grand one:  out from the trees he leaps, gargantuan and imposing,
sporting hands big enough to crush a Volkswagen bug, and a pair of feet
much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have.  Joe bellows
at the poachers before him, angry that they would like to kill him and
sell him for millions of dollars.  During this scene, I turned to my
friend and said, "Wow.  That's some ape."</P>
<P>Joe is quite a gorilla -- a big, digital gorilla.  He runs around the
fields, chasing cars and people.  He picks things up and stares at them
pensively.  He breaks things on accident, because he's just too big to
avoid clumsiness.  Joe, as a special effect, is an image that might hold
your interest for five minutes.  As a character, he doesn't quite
register.  And the story he's been put in is as limp as they come.  The
words "Family Entertainment" have never been a stamp of quality, but
Might Joe Young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have
a heart.</P>
<P>The picture is a remake of the 1949 film.  It's mostly just about the
big gorilla, but, strictly as a formality, the movie also has a few
human characters.  The main one is Jill Young (poor Charlize Theron,
forced to waste her talent), a lover of gorillas.  As a child, she
witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother; now, she lives in the
jungle to protect the wildlife.  Specifically, she's out to protect Joe,
a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood.  </P>
<P>Soon, zoologist Gregg O'Hara (Bill Paxton) discovers Joe; he quickly
realizes that poachers want to get Joe and sell him to a big game hunter
named Strasser (Rade Sherbedgia), who just happens to be the same guy
who killed Jill's mother.  So, in an effort to save Joe, Jill and Gregg
take the big gorilla to a preserve, where it is instantly clear that he
is not safe from poachers.  In addition, the space is way too small for
him (after all, he is a really big gorilla).  And, to add to the
complications, Strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext (he tells
Jill that he has a preserve big enough for Joe), and Joe recognizes
Strasser as the guy who killed Jill's mother.</P>
<P>Jill, of course, doesn't recognize Strasser, even though he did kill
her mother.  This is just one of the many examples of stupidity in
Mighty Joe Young, a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with
a Special Effects Film.  The movie isn't really offensive -- it has some
competent actors, a few nifty sets, and a lot of scenes with a big,
digitized gorilla.  But the story is really dumb, there aren't any
characters, and the film isn't satisfying on any level beyond its
visuals.</P>
<P>The movie also has bad dialogue.  If a critic says that a film has bad
dialogue, it's only fair to quote some of it, but most of the words
spoken in this picture are phrases like "Joe isn't happy!" and "Joe
isn't safe here!"  "We need to get Joe out of here!"  "Joe is way too
big for that cage!"  I don't know if these phrases are word for word,
but they're close.  As I said, the characters here are only present as a
formality:  they do little more than state the obvious (of *course* Joe
is too big for that cage).  Paxton and Theron are talented performers
who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them. 
Sadly, Mighty Joe Young wastes them both.</P>
<P>There are a few clever moments (although none of them are surfacing in
my memory at the moment), and, as I said, the digital effects held my
attention for at least five minutes.  It's certainly not a bad film for
kids; I doubt Joe will give them nightmares.  But adults in the audience
aren't likely to find much of anything interesting about the big
gorilla.  A big gorilla is only interesting for a little while; after
that, something needs to be done with the big gorilla.  Nobody ever
figures out what to do with the big gorilla.</P>
