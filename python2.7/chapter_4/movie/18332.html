<PRE>8MM
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Have you been dying to know just how sick, twisted and decayed the human
soul can become?  Well, look no further.  8MM is a prime example of
bleak vérité.  But, though it has bleakness in spades, 8MM lacks
anything worthwhile to be engaging.</P>
<P>Detective Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) is in over his head.  He has been
hired by a rich widow (Myra Carter) who has discovered what she believes
to be a snuff film in her late husband's belongings.  Upset over the
atrocity, she wants Detective Welles to ascertain whether the film is
authentic or merely a disturbing hoax.</P>
<P>Stumbling upon one incredulously lucky break after another, Welles
follows the trail to Hollywood.  There, he meets up with Max
California(Joaquin Phoenix), an adult bookstore clerk who takes him on a
tour of the seamy world of illegal pornography.</P>
<P>As the depravities Welles encounters get worse and worse, his case turns
into a personal quest.  He needs to understand the pivotal question:
why?  Why is pure evil allowed to exist?  But will understanding the
answer to that question cost him his own sanity?</P>
<P>Many of the conclusions drawn by 8MM were also made by screenwriter
Andrew Kevin Walker's superior 1995 effort, Seven.  However, not only
does 8MM lack the earlier film's strong characterizations and sense of
structure, but 8MM director Joel Schumacher isn't able to create a
visual style anywhere near comparison.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage has the misfortune to play an everyman character whose most
sympathetic trait is the fact that, well, he's being played by Nic
Cage.  He is never able to connect with the audience, even though he is
intended to be their guide to the underworld.</P>
<P>Joaquin Phoenix' Max California at least has a few character quirks that
he can play upon, whereas Cage is given only one (he pretends he doesn't
smoke, although he does).  But, then again, Phoenix exists primarily as
a way to take the movie deeper and deeper into the world of porn.
(Though it works structurally, it doesn't really make much sense in the
movie.  Since Detective Welles is looking for some highly illegal stuff,
why doesn't he simply start with the bottom dwellers instead of working
his way down?)</P>
<P>8MM is the type of movie that, though not particularly poorly made,
makes you seriously wonder, "why am I watching this?"  It's not merely
that the movie is depressing and/or sordid (though it is).  But there
has to be something that engages you among the depressive sordidness...
and that crucial part is missing from 8MM.</P>
