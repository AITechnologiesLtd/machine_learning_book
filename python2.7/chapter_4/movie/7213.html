<P>     This crowd-pleasing comedy-fantasy stars Jim Carrey as a lawyer who
must tell the truth for 24 hours.  His son makes a birthday wish and,
poof, magic happens.  Just like a Penny Marshall movie.  And, because
dad is played by Plastic Man, he can't simply speak the truth.  He has
to shout it, or spit it, or contort his body to express it.  LIAR, LIAR
is as predictable as its one-joke premise suggests, with Carrey on only
a slightly shorter leash than usual.  Though the occasional bit is side-
splitting-- a board-room roast, a violent double-take or two, and the
definitive answer to "how's it hangin'?"-- there's little here that we
haven't seen (or heard) before.  Well, okay, he's never tried to tug at
our hearts, which is what happens at the end, easily the worst part of
the movie.  Thank God for the outtake reel, rolled over the closing
credits.</P>

<PRE>Notes
=====</PRE>
<P>     LIAR, LIAR was screened at Mission Valley Cinemas, in Raleigh.
Fifteen minutes passed before the correct lens was installed.  And the
rude people in the row behind me were expectedly hostile, when I sug-
gested that they continue their conversation after the movie.  But they
*did* shut up.</P>
