<P>After having sat through over three hours of fast-moving action 
involving characters who wouldn't "let me in" to their world in 
"Magnolia", it was a refreshing change of pace to sit back and relax 
with "The Cider House Rules".  Felt like...family.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) is an unusual man in an unusual place 
during an unusual time: along with Nurse Angela (Kathy Baker) and Nurse 
Edna (Jane Alexander), Larch oversees a home for unwanted children--born 
and yet-to-be born--in St. Cloud, Maine during World War II.  The 
abortions he performs are illegal, but in his eyes, they are necessary, 
considering the alternative (terribly unsafe backalley hatchet jobs).  
This, though, is little comfort to young Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire); 
along with housemates Buster (Kieran Culkin), Mary Agnes (Pas de la 
Huerta), Copperfield (Sean Andrew), Hazel (Skye McCole Bartusiak), Fuzzy 
(Erik Sullivan) and the adorable Curly (Spencer Diamond), Homer grows up 
as an orphan under the care of Larch and the nurses, and becomes almost 
as skilled as the good doctor himself.  The difference, though, is that 
Homer objects to Larch's actions, and has no intentions on being an 
abortionist.</P>
<P>Homer's life takes a drastic change when Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd), 
an Air Force pilot, brings his girlfriend Candy Kendall (Charlize 
Theron) to St. Cloud for an abortion.  When they leave, Homer goes with 
them, and experiences life as an apple picker in the cider mill of 
Wally's family, including his mother Olive (Kate Nelligan).  There, he 
meets a band of migrant workers led by Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo), his 
daughter Rose Rose (Erykah Badu, in her acting debut), Peaches (Heavy 
D), and Muddy (K. Todd Freeman).  But Homer's former life isn't quite 
behind him; not yet...</P>
<P>The Upshot:
I went into "The Cider House Rules" fully prepared to be either 
disappointed, or put to sleep, by Yet Another art flick.  I need to get 
rid of my jadedness; it would've done this film a disservice had I let 
it win out.  "Cider" was like a breath of fresh air following the "work" 
I had to do to roll with "Magnolia" (lest ye think I'm doggin' that 
flick, check out my "Magnolia" review first.  I'm just sayin'.)   It was 
nice to just let this film wash over me; quite nice to let the movie be.</P>
<P>The flow of the movie served it well.  Told almost as a bedtime story, I 
could easily hear the nurses reading it to the kids as a lullaby; not 
for sleepy-time, but instead to soothe them from the reality that not 
many people were (and sadly, are still not) interested in adopting them 
once they were no longer babies.  Of course, not every aspect of the 
film was a peaceful as all this; the harsh reality of choosing to end a 
life, was a heavy burden to bear by mother and doctor alike.  That the 
movie didn't get bogged down with the heaviness, is indicative of the 
quality of this film.</P>
<P>One would think that a flick that dealt with such a big Issue as 
abortion, from both sides of the fence, would come off as overly 
strident.  One would be wrong.  Though the Issue was "resolved" in the 
end as heavily balanced on one side over the other (you'll have to see 
it to know which), there was no heavy-handed pro-choice or pro-life 
Message involved; the real Message addressed the humanity of the 
characters involved.</P>
<P>And o, the humanity.  The characters felt as natural as those you might 
meet in a small town in 1940's Maine whose only residents are orphans 
and the caretakers that look after them; the actors, likewise, fit the 
clothes of their roles quite well.  Other than the horrible go at an 
American accent, I could easily believe Caine's Dr. Larch, and the 
compassion he had for orphans and pregnant mothers alike; the way he and 
the nurses made the orphans feel special without patronizing them, 
warmed my jaded heart.  Maguire as the eagerly naive Homer, could teach 
Mr. DiCaprio and pals a thing or three about the importance of not being 
so full of your celebrity that you forget how to act; he was charming 
and engaging, and I look forward to seeing him in more movies.  Ditto 
Charlize Theron; my estimation of her acting skills shot way up after 
this flick.  In fact, I can't remember a missed-note from any of the 
actors or characters--including the children.  Heck, especially the 
children; after the sour taste that "Stuart Little" left in my mouth for 
Cutesy Orphan Kids, I was pleasantly surprised by the easygoing 
performances of the young actors (and I fell in love with Spencer 
Diamond; I'd adopt him in a heartbeat!)</P>
<P>The movie took a weird turn when Homer left the orphanage for the cider 
mill; it wasn't exactly difficult to follow, but the motivations (so to 
speak) for the actions of the characters involved, weren't as clear 
during this part of the movie as they were in the orphanage.  That said, 
Delroy Lindo once again knocked my socks off; I find it hard to believe 
that, considering what his Mr. Rose character went through, I could feel 
as...attached...to his character after the movie ended, as I did going 
in.  Though Erykah Badu's movie debut drew my attention [too much, in 
spots; was she wearing contacts?], Lindo's powerful performance kept it.   </P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
I sometimes have to remind myself that, especially in period pieces like 
this, expressions of "strength" (so to speak) by Black folk, are of 
necessity more muted than they should be able to be in modern day 
movies; that is, just as one wouldn't expect John Coffey to Go Off On 
any of the officers in "The Green Mile", for example, one should also 
not expect Rose Rose to take more serious issue at Candy's charitable 
efforts to give her hand-me-downs.</P>
<P>That said, I cannot help but note this in that regard: White Privilege 
once again reared its ugly head when Migrant Worker Homer was eagerly, 
and repeatedly, invited to sup with both the Kendall and Worthington 
families--but Rose, who at least Candy knew for a much longer time, 
received no such invitation, and none seemed to be forthcoming any time 
soon.  Excuse it away if you will, but I doubt that such excuses would 
go far in Rose's eyes.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
A sweet story with characters that felt Real (especially after having 
just seen "Magnolia", which felt Otherworldly in comparison), one could 
almost forgive Michael Caine for his awful American accent--which gave 
way to his otherwise brilliantly understated performance.  An additional 
tip o' the hat to Delroy Lindo for pulling off the seemingly impossible 
(no spoilers here; you'll have to see it to understand what I mean).</P>
<P>"The Cider House Rules": (rating: greenlight)  
After a year filled with Big!Event! movies (c.f. "Star Wars" The 
Revision), and ultra-long telethon flicks (c.f. "Magnolia"), "Cider" 
gets my props for being a "simple" story with heart.  Y'all go.</P>
