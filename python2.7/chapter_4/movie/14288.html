<P>   Monica Lewinsky was twenty-one when her affair with Bill
Clinton began.  By chronological age she's no Lolita, and
what's more supporters of the president maintain that she is a
manipulating seductress who plied her wiles successfully on
Mr. Clinton--who should not be considered the ogre.  Those
who want the president impeached and removed from office
maintain that he took advantage of someone half his age, a
bimbo in thrall to his position as his country's premier alpha
male.</P>
<P>  The Lolita of novelist Vladimir Nabokov's creation, like
Monica, is a seductress who had at least one lover before she
threw herself on the considerably older man.  Like our
president, the professor did not need much encouragement to
respond affirmatively.  The difference is that the title character
of Vladimir Nabokov's novel is jail bait, a twelve-year-old who
is a half dozen years below the legal age for responsible
consent.  </P>
<P>  Pederastry, even with willing partners, is illegal everywhere,
considered a particularly heinous offense if the underage
subject is horrified by his or her victimization. Pedophilia
makes an intriguing topic for films.  Studios have shown a
general unwillingness to tackle the subject for fear of pickets,
but now that "Lolita" has been shown on Cable TV without
serious incident, we may get to see more studies of the
phenomenon. Already writer-director Todd Solondz is soon to
deliver "Happiness," about a WASPish dad who gains release
from his demons by raping his son's schoolmates. Compared
to child rape, Humbert Humbert's actions, borne out of
genuine caring and passion for his young bedmate, is, well,
kid stuff.  Perhaps that's why some critics have already
judged Adrian Lyne's take on the subject to be dull--even
though this version sticks more closely to Nabokov's novel
than Stanley Kubrick's 1962 adaptation which has James
Mason in the role now inhabited by Jeremy Irons, Shelley
Winters in the Melanie Griffith guise, with Frank Langella now
substituting for Peter Sellers and Dominique Swain in for Sue
Lyon.  But dull it is not.  This "Lolita" is a thoroughly
entertaining piece eliciting much of the novel's comic look at
Middle-American types and capturing a good deal of its lyric
dialogue.  If this version has weaknesses, they are in Lyne's
apparent mistrust of audience sophistication.  Lynn plays up
the obvious and substitutes vulgar poses for more innocently
suggestive fare.  Chief among these flaws is Lolita's ribald
mastication of a banana where sucking a lollipop would have
been more appropriate and in the sexually suggestive
preparation of an ice-cream soda (extra chocolate syrup) by a
profoundly Middle-American type in a 1950's-style
luncheonette.</P>
<P>   The story, which takes place in the early 1950s, centers on
the relationship of a shy but cosmopolitan man and a 12-year-
old nymphet with whom he develops an overwhelming
passion.  When French literature professor Humbert Humbert
(Jeremy Irons) arrives in a New England town for a teaching
job, he runs into a sex-starved widow, Charlotte Haze
(Melanie Griffith) whom he marries only to be close to her
young daughter Lolita (Dominique Swain).  When Charlotte
comes upon her new husband's diary, one which poison pens
her coupled with amorous scribblings about her daughter, she
is determined to leave him but conveniently gets killed in an
auto accident.  Humbert takes Lolita out of the summer camp
to which her mother sent her, only gradually informing the girl
that her mother is dead.  Meanwhile, the two lovers are off on
an auto tour of the American hinterlands filled with the funny
and sorrowful adventures of the immature but ecstatic
Humbert and his precociously manipulating charge.  </P>
<P>   Lyne keeps Humbert in pajamas a good deal of the time,
suggesting the sexual embraces rather than graphically
depicting them.  In one of the movie's funniest scenes, the
maneuvering Lolita cons a raise in her allowance by
seductively moving her hand across Humbert's clothed thigh:
having succeeded in doubling her ration, she parlays her little
victory into what is essentially trading sex for money, sealing
her lover's doom by leaving him for a sinister playwright,
Clare Quilty (Frank Langella), whose pedophilia extends far
beyond Humbert's.  </P>
<P>   No person can fill the role of the hapless Humbert Humbert
better than Jeremy Irons.  The fifty-year-old British actor tends
to be typecast as the shy, befuddled, brooding academic, in
one instance winning Best Actor plaudits from the New York
theater critics for his dual role in "Dead Ringers."  His
Humbert notably embodies the rise and fall of a man who has
been traumatized by the death of his adolescent sweetheart,
given new life by his passion for a nubile adolescent, and
wholly corrupted by an obsession which was doomed from the
start. Dominique Swain portrays her character's duality as
both a refreshingly immature kid who can easily make friends
with her peers in camp and a apt manipulator of an adult
whose academic background gives him knowledge but not
wisdom.  The Nabokov story, which has been appropriately
respected by scripter Stephen Schiff, is being released as a
film at an opportune time when our country's leader is up to
his neck in misery brought about by a similar obsession.  If
only these hapless Humberts looked for real wisdom to the
ancient Greeks whose playrights and storytellers knew only
too well the agony that can result from immoderate emotions.</P>
