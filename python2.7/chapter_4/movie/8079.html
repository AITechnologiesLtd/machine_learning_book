<P>Men in Black is a really good idea for a summer movie. First, it
rides the crest of the X-Files/Roswell mystique, letting their publicity
sell the film. Conflicts with aliens means space ships, explosions, and
creature special effects, perfect for summer repeat business.  Add the
cachet of a graphic novel `comic book,' and you have an off-the-rack
winner. Mercifully, this property fell into the right hands (Spielberg's
Amblin), and didn't end up in the Hollywood sausage grinder. Barry
Sonnenfeld was a good choice as director. He had previously done the
Addams Family movies and Get Shorty. These films had their own peculiar
attitude as their primary strength, and Barry delivered them to the
screen intact. MIB has its own ‘tude,  helped along by those box office
titans..Smith and Jones?</P>
<P>I wonder if the generic nature of the stars' names is a mere
coincidence, given that they play imperturbable, implacable cyphers.
Fact is, Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith both bring a lot of  talent and
charisma to their roles. Will Smith showed us his action/humor chops in
ID4, and he solidifies his ascendency here. Tommy doing comedy is a
surprise to some, but I don't know why. Comedy acting requires a
conviction to the story, letting the comedy come from the material, not
the actor's manner. Check out Tommy's Oscar-nominated turn in JFK, and
Oscar-winning role in The Fugitive.</P>
<P>Will plays a NYPD cop who falls down the rabbit-hole, into the
super-secret world of the MIB. These guys police the traffic of hundreds
of otherworld aliens that live here amongst us, and MIB hides them from
the locals. Earth is sort of a neutral port: `Think of  the movie
Casablanca,' Jones tells Will, `without the Nazis.' Jones becomes Will's
partner/mentor, dead serious as an MIB, but he betrays a capricious
sense of humor in the way he tosses Will into mind-blowing situations.
Tommy and boss Rip Torn never blink an eye as they matter-of-factly
discuss the latest end-of-Earth scenario. Their un-sensationalistic
manner is the implicit smirk that gives the movie its charm. It gives
contrast to Will's comic takes, as he and the audience find out that Sly
Stallone and Newt Gingrich, among others, are really aliens (Elvis,
too). And the MIB agency is autonomous, getting funding from its patents
on such borrowed alien technology as Velcro.</P>
<P>The main bug hunt involves an assassin sent to Earth to kill alien
royalty and capture a bauble he is guarding. Vincent D'Onofrio has a
great time playing the assassin, struggling to move about in the skin of
a farmer, who didn't look too good before the bug killed him. Imagine:
Terminator meets My Left Foot. As bodies pile up, they end in the
morgue, where Linda Fiorentino plays a coroner, puzzled by cadavers that
only appear to be human. Not the first time for her, but prior occasions
have been wiped from her memory by the neuralyzer, an MIB device that
erases the recent memories of people who witness alien events. This
little doodad gets a real workout in the MIB's normal day, and it gets
to be an anticipated punchline as the squares get corraled toward the
end of a scene.</P>
<P>Further humor ensues when Will lobbies Tommy not to use the
neuralyzer on the coroner yet again, fearing repeated use could be
harmful. Actually, he's kind of attracted to her, what with her being
Linda Fiorentino, and he doesn't want her to forget him, again. Turns
out that she unknowingly has possession  of the aforementioned bauble,
so she ends up drawn into a Kong-scales-the-Empire-State-Building ending
anyway. Not to worry. The bug is stopped, Earth is saved, and all
elements are in place for MIB II.</P>
<P>Men in Black delivers, probably better than any summer movie for this
year. The talented Smith and Jones boys solidify their box office
appeal, and Sonnenfeld answers the question `Who you gonna call?' for
offbeat stories that need a sympathetic director. Creature-meister Rick
Baker and Industrial Lights and Magic did their usual superlative job.
Betcha can't see it just once.</P>
