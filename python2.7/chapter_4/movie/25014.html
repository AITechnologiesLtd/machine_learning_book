<PRE>A Video Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Never before in my life have I seen a movie worse than The Omega Code. This 
may sound like a strong statement, but it is completely true. So many things 
went awry with the first movie funded by TBN (the Trinity Broadcasting 
Network) that I seriously could sit here all day listing them. </P>
<P>Gillen Lane (Casper Van Dien) is a self-motivation and religious guru who 
lost his faith when he was ten. His mother died in a car crash when he was at 
that age and since then he's been trying to improve people's lives by 
teaching them to believe in themselves rather than a higher power. His ideas 
interest Stone Alexander (Michael York) a wealthy, but corrupt businessman 
who uses his work to promote peace in Jerusalem and other Middle Eastern 
countries to hide his work on cracking the bible code. Gillen and Alexander 
are both intrigued by this code. When the bible gets viewed in 3-D certain 
patterns emerge that predict the future. Hitler, the assassination of John F. 
Kennedy, and the death of Princess Diana were apparently all foretold by the 
bible. Whoever has control of the code and knows what's going to happen next 
can therefore claim themselves to be God. So Gillen must keep the code safe 
from double-crossing executives, bodyguards, and reporters. Along the way his 
faith may come back. </P>
<P>The main problem with The Omega Code is that it tries too hard to be two 
different types of movies. It wants to preach the lord, and spread the word 
of Jesus to African countries we've never heard of. However, the religious 
message gets overshadowed by all of the action. Writers Stephan Blinn and 
Hollis Barton tried to make this entertaining, but try not to groan when 
Gillen says things like, "I’ve got to do it! It’s my child!" Try not to 
laugh when a man runs away from a big Amish-like shooter guy with a long 
beard. Scenes like these are laughably bad. So is the acting. Casper Van Dien 
still shows no hope of good acting skills. Rather than this being amusing, as 
it was in Starship Troopers, it's just really annoying. Michael York is also 
surprisingly bad. The Omega Code is so utterly predictable it's scary. Gillen 
isn’t smart enough to figure out that almost no one is on his side. The movie 
also treats the audience this way. Whether you see one movie a year or one 
hundred, it's very likely you've seen all of this before. Fifth graders are 
producing better stories with better dialog than this. Sitting through five 
hours of TBN and watching modern-day Tammy Faye Bakkers bawl it out is by far 
a less severe punishment. </P>
<P>There was one joyous moment for me that involved this movie. That moment was 
when I returned the tape to the video store.</P>
