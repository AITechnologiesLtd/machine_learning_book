RUNNING FREE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<PRE>Yada, yada, yada.</PRE>
<P>Sergei Bodrov's RUNNING FREE is a stunningly majestic motion picture
that is almost completely undermined by it's loquacious narrator, a
horse named Lucky.  Jeanne Rosenberg's script spoils the sumptuous
visuals by rarely letting the horse give us a moment of peace so we can
savor the feast set before our eyes.  Trying to enjoy RUNNING FREE is
like watching LAWRENCE OF ARABIA with a precocious preteen who feels
obligated to share his trite thoughts with you at every moment.  No
matter how obvious the scene, the kid feels duty bound to explain it to
you anyway.</P>
<P>And whereas Caroline Thompson's BLACK BEAUTY had the richly emotive
voice of Alan Cumming, which she use sparingly as the voice of the
horse, RUNNING FREE features non-stop and remarkably bland narration by
Lukas Haas.</P>
<P>The minimal story concerns horses sent from Europe to work as beasts of
burden in the mines in the harsh South African desert just before the
outbreak of World War I.  As the title suggests, the horses will
eventually break free.  You could probably figure out the horses'
desires, but motor mouth Lucky spells it out for you anyway.  "I was
born to run free and wild," he tells us.  "No one taught this to me."
So just in case you thought that running free is covered in horse
school, you now know that it isn't.</P>
<P>Sometimes, thankfully, Lucky stops to catch his breath.  In these truly
lucky moments, we can soak in the marvelous images: dust blowing across
the sand dunes, a train cutting through the golden wilderness, a young
colt emerging soaked from having to swim in the ocean and a native girl
scurrying barefoot across rust-colored sand.  Cinematographer Dan
Laustsen uses a gorgeous sepia-toned palette to evoke a warm nostalgic
feel.</P>
<P>But mainly Lucky talks and talks and talks.  "This boy had a gentle
touch," Lucky tells us the obvious, as he is stroked by Richard (Chase
Moore), the stable boy who found the half-starved colt abandoned in a
boxcar.  "I felt I could trust him."  Later, as he chases after Richard
on a train, Lucky says, "I suddenly realized that they were taking my
boy from me."  Yet another example of something we could have figured
out on our own, and another instance when you want to scream at the
screen to "shut up already!"</P>
<P>Besides telling us what we already know, Lucky likes to play the
philosopher.  "It wasn't only in the stables that the world was unfair,"
he remarks on seeing horses used solely for their horsepower.</P>
<P>If the sound system should fail in your theater, just pray that no one
else will complain.  Without the voices, RUNNING FREE would probably be
absolutely wonderful.  I'll never know since, I'm sorry to say, our
speakers performed flawlessly.</P>
<P>RUNNING FREE runs 1:22.  It is rated G and would be fine for all ages.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, seemed fairly unenthusiastic about the movie,
but he said that he gave it *** because he really likes animals.</P>
