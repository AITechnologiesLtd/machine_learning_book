A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Woody Allen</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Woody Allen</PRE>
<P>Ingredients: Washed up writer, divorce, chasing women</P>
<P>Starring: Kenneth Branagh, Judy Davis, Famke Janssen</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Lee Simon (Kenneth Branagh) and his wife Robin (Judy Davis) get a
divorce. From that moment, Lee goes chasing around after beautiful young
women in the entertainment business. Meanwhile Lee's wife Robin doesn't
chase anyone at all, but nonetheless captures the heart of a wonderful
man. Leonardo DiCaprio has a small part as a decadent celebrity who
examines one of Lee's writing projects. </P>
<P>Opinion:
CELEBRITY could have been interesting as a vivacious comedy, but
director Woody Allen plays this one serious and instead gives us a black
and white film about a shallow divorcee who doesn't seem to go anywhere
as he fails one relationship after another.</P>
<P>Woody Allen films are easily recognizable because the characters talk in
self-confessions, as if each dialogue partner is a part-time
psychoanalyst. In CELEBRITY not only do we get the trademark dialogue,
but Kenneth Branagh, playing Lee Simon, is a dead ringer for Woody Allen
himself. Branagh does a masterful job imitating Woody Allen's speech,
mannerisms, and facial ticks. Unfortunately, all this good acting goes
to waste on CELEBRITY's canned script which presents us with nothing we
haven't seen before.</P>
<P>In movies we hope to be uplifted, or at least to be entertained by
something new, something exciting, or something deep - -  as characters
grow, win battles, or come to profound realizations. But in CELEBRITY no
such goals or realizations occur, and filming in black and white doesn't
make the shallow skirt-chasing seem any more insightful. Give us
something more profound.</P>
