<P>Synopsis: British spy Andy Osnard (Brosnan) is banished to Panama, where 
his superiors believe he will be incapable of stirring up trouble. But 
Osnard soon enters into a shady arrangement with tailor Harry Pendel 
(Rush), whose wife Louisa (Curtis) works in the administration of the 
Panama Canal. With Harry's reluctant assistance, Andy begins to weave a 
complex plan involving rebels and the Canal to hoodwink his bosses; and 
Harry may get caught in the crossfire.</P>
<P>Review: "The Tailor Of Panama" comes across as the most cynical James Bond 
movie ever filmed. Brosnan is an obvious casting choice, devilishly toying 
with the audience's preconceived expectations; where Bond is stylish, 
charismatic and heroic, Osnard is stylish, charismatic and utterly 
selfish. And whereas the typical James Bond movie is larger than life, 
full of explosions and colourful villains, "Tailor" is more of a character 
piece, and avoids vilifying anyone in particular. This is a tale of the 
greed of men and the stupidity of nations: how some choose to profit from 
it, and some merely try to survive it. Rush is excellent as Harry, a man 
who quickly realises he is caught up in something over which he has no 
control. Curtis, though, feels a bit wasted as Louisa, and her character 
is the most ill-defined of the principal cast. Boorman impresses with his 
careful direction, achieving an even balance between the script's more 
adrenaline-fueled moments and its essential intricacy. He also takes great 
advantage of the lush Panamanian setting, the whole movie looking as 
though it was filmed through a haze of heat and humidity. The ending does 
feel a bit unsatisfying, with events moving so quickly that it threatens 
the movie's coherency. But as an example of an espionage picture without 
the usual cartoonish superheroics, "The Tailor Of Panama" is impressive.</P>
