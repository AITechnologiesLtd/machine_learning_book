<PRE>                            SWEET AND LOWDOWN
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Woody Allen loves jazz.  He loves jazz so much that he regularly
skips the Oscars to play clarinet with his jazz combo.  He talks about
jazz all the time.</P>
<P>     I love Woody Allen, really I do.  I'm probably the only living
critic who enjoyed CELEBRITY.  I love jazz, too.  Every Wednesday for
two years, I saw a classic jazz quartet play tunes like "All of Me,"
"Rosetta," and "Old Man Time" in a dank cellar bar.</P>
<P>     Woody Allen loves jazz so much he made up a guy and made a
fictional documentary about him.</P>
<PRE>     As it turns out, you can love a thing too much.</PRE>
<P>     Played by Sean Penn, Emmet Ray is a supposed wild jazzman of the
1930's.  He drinks hard, pimps whores in his spare time, falls for a
mute woman (Morton), has a fling with a high-society dame (Thurman), and
plays a little guitar along the way.</P>
<P>     Sounds exciting, but unfortunately the actual story is so boring
and uneventful that it's hard to care about any of this.  At 95 minutes,
I was sure this would be light and breezy Allen fare.  It was the
longest hour-and-a-half of my life.</P>
<P>     Parts of the film are great, mainly a moment near the finale, when
three different versions of a humorous incident in Ray's life are played
out.  The jazz is great, but there's surprisingly little music in the
film.  It mainly serves as a lullaby to play while you blissfully fall
asleep in your chair.</P>
<P>     What's worse is that the structure just plain doesn't work.
Allen's so-called "expert interviews" talking about Ray are intercut not
with faux documentary footage, but with a regular movie.  Sony is trying
to quietly position SWEET AND LOWDOWN as a "real" documentary, but this
ain't no BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.</P>
<P>     Instead, it's just a muddled mess, a character in search of a
story, a filmmaker in search of his muse.</P>
