<PRE>By Jeremiah Rickert</PRE>
<P>     I had not seen the film this was based on, I am sure this was a plus.
I have never been a fan of Richard Gere, so I have to admit I was a bit
negative going into to this film.  
     The plot concerns an attempted assassaination, contracted by a
Russian mafioso, in retaliation for the death of his brother, who was
killed in a joint FBI/MVD (the post Soviet version of the KGB) raid on a
nightclub as part of an investigation. The head MVD agent, Col. Valentina
Koslova (Diane Venora), and the head FBI agent on the scene Carter Preson
(Sidney Poitier) are immediately targets for the mafia, however, instead
they decide to get their revenge on the Americans in a more spectacular
way. They send in the Jackal (Bruce Willis) to convey their message of
revenge in a brutal and public manner for the incredible sum of $70
million in cash.  The premise is a bit hokey for three reasons.  1.  The
FBI does not function outside the United States, the CIA maybe.  2.  $70
million in C-A-S-H?  That would be a LOT of money, even with $100 bills,
and incredibly difficult (doesn't matter who you are) to raise anywhere
without attracting a lot of attention, especially in Russia.  3.  I seems
to me that the mafia would be more able to reach people within Russia than
in the U.S.  Why not take care of the people who did the raid?  That said,
I did enjoy the film.
     No one knows what the Jackal looks like, but they do know that he
exists.  The KGB apparently used him for jobs, but all those who have seen
him are dead, or impossible to find, except for one, a woman who knows his
face named Isabella.  (Mathilda May).  In order to find her, however, they
need her former boyfriend Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere) a former Irish
Republican Army assassain who is incarcerated in the United States.  (how
convenient).  He agrees to help them find Isabella in return for his
freedom, which is never really given, but he seems to have personal
reasons to go after the Jackal as well, so he decides to help them,
revealing that he has seen the man as well.  Lucky for the good guys,
Declan is an expert on the Jackal's techniques, and the race is on to
find out who his target is, and how he's going to carry out the hit,
before he has a chance to do it.
     The plot keeps one guessing, which is rare these days in a lot of
films.  Unfortunately, the Jackal seems to be predictable enough that
Mulqueen can follow his trail easily.  It seemed like tracking him didn't
take as much effort as it could have, there seems to be no doubt that they
will catch up with the Jackal, and since the movie is only about 2hrs
long, you know you won't have to wait that long.  
     The direction by Stephen Hopkins (Blown Away, Ghost and the Darkness,
Predator 2) is adequate, but rarely top notch.  The performances, however,
are all very good.  Willis seems subdued throughout the film, but really,
a killer who has "been in the business for 20 years" is not going to have
a really distinctive personality.  Poitier is at his intense best, as is
Mathilda May as the former criminal Isabella, who is trying to escape her
checkered past, happy to be in a stable family situation, but a bit
unhappy in a might-as-well-settle-before-I'm-dead way.  Diane Verora, as
the scarred former KGB agent has the strongest performance.  She seems to
have a cold detachment from her humanity, brought on by the combonation of
her job and her disfigured face.  However, Mulqueen seems to breach that a
bit, and Venora manages to make the character change in a very very subtle
manner.  She has never thought about a relationship she says because men
are not attaracted to her scar, but Mulqueen seems to connect with her,
and it's very very faintly acknolwedged by her, that is what makes her
stand out.  There was no overt attraction between the two which could
cheapen it, and I found it very entertaining and well-written.  It was a
part of the flim that really avoided cliches.
     The pacing of the film was pretty good also.  Instead of long drawn
out scenes, punctuated by a flurry of action, like recent films The
Peacemaker and to an extent, Starship Troopers, the film is paced rather
evenly, chugging along at a pleasant gait that doesn't leave you gasping
for air, or snoring in your seat.  There was a lot of technological jargon
and hardware that got a bit old, but at the same time, used the internet
in a way that seemd more real than most films that utilize the information
superhighway.  (The Net, and Hackers).  The finale of the movie was also
refreshing because again, it lacked those things which have become cliche
in recent years in action films:  The crescendo of music which peaks then
pauses for a bit, enough for the hero to recite a one-liner, (Hasta La
Vista Baby! Time's Up! Bad Dog! Assimilate This! to name a few recent
examples) and then proceed to kill the bad guy in an overblown way.
(lowering him into molten metal, placing the bomb in his pants, shooting
him with a cannon, and blowing up the piece of hardware he's attached to,
respectively with the cliches above).  I was very pleased that the Jackal
did not sink to that level.  </P>
<P>(Below is a minor spoiler, so don't read on if you haven't seen the film,
my rating by the way, is the film was worth $2.50 of the $3.50 I paid for
it)</P>
<P>     In the end of the film, I would have to say there is no president in
the history of this country that would not have pardoned Mulqueen, or
shortened his sentence, or something like that.   I mean
really!  Talk about making up for your past wrongs!  Maybe they were
trying to avoid the cliche again, but they went to far on that one.    </P>
<P>Once again, of the $3.50 I paid for the flim, it was worth $2.50</P>
