PI (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Darren Aronofsky</PRE>
<P>Writers: Darren Aronofsky, Sean Gullette, and Eric Watson</P>
<P>Starring: Sean Gullette, Mark Margolis, Ben Shankman, Pamela Hart, 
Stephen Pearlman, Samia Shoaib, Ajay Naidu</P>
<P>Made for about the same amount of money that I earned during an entire 
summer break slaving at Radio Shack, "Pi" is an incessantly cool-looking 
paranoiac thriller, all the more interesting because it's budget was so 
excrutiatingly low (as I've already mentioned). Like a German 
Expressionist Film from the 20s, it nearly takes pride in the lack of 
resources it has, and creates a unique-looking world from what 
technology it has, meaning stark, unrealistic black and white 
photography, lots of shadows and pale faces, and a story that relies 
more on visuals and crazy images than entities like acting and plotting. 
In fact, the way it's shot is as appropriate as the way this year's "The 
Celebration" was shot: that Danish film gave a feeling of hidden home 
video, and this film puts us directly into the mind of its protagonist, 
a brilliant mathematician, Max (Sean Gullette), whose sanity wanes as 
the film progresses. The plot - about Max trying to find patterns in the 
stock exchange and therefore predict it - is not nearly as important as 
what the film's main theme is: that knowledge is a crutch, and the more 
you know, the more in danger you are.</P>
<P>With balding hair and a world-wearied facade, Max lives a lonely life, 
but doesn't seem to mind completely since his entire apartment is packed 
with computers and machines. At the top of this cluttered mess is a 
standard stock market scrolling marquee that ominously reveals the 
information that he needs to know to complete his work. The people we 
meet are either loners themselves (a wise older man whom he plays chess 
with, played by Mark Margolis), those out to profit from his knowledge 
(a woman who works for a brokerage, played by Pamela Hart), or 
well-meaning neighbors (an Indian woman, played by Samia Shoaib, who 
seems to have a sweet crush on him). The main plot kicks into gear 
immeadiately, as he runs into a seemingly friendly Jewish scholar (Ben 
Shankman) who piques his interest in finding what may be the Name of God 
from the Rosetta Stone. According to him, God has as many numbers as the 
project he's working on. Max begins working on all of these, and slowly 
passes over the brink of sanity, just as those who would profit from him 
begin to become more and more belligerent (if you've ever wanted to see 
irate and deadly Jewish scholars, have I got a movie for you...). But is 
this all part of his growing insanity, this film seems to question, as 
it shows off more and more crazy sequences, like a creepy scene where 
Max stumbles onto what seems to be a human brain in the subway.</P>
<P>Filled with manic imagery and a great techno soundtrack, "Pi" should be 
an absolutely astounding motion picture, like the two films it's been 
compared to, Orson Welles' "The Trial" and David Lynch's "Eraserhead," 
both which feature many of the same elements of stark black and white 
photography, extensive use of chiaroscuro lighting techniques, and a 
paranoiac overtone. But "Pi" doesn't completely deliver. The way it's 
made is superb, and I have no doubt that Darren Aronofsky's future in 
film will be a promising and exciting one, just from the way he directs 
this film. But it just needs a better script. The story of Max is 
interesting, but it's hackneyed with an interesting but way too simple 
theme, that being that too much knowledge alienates us and drives us 
into insanity. It's almost a pity that it deals with this direclty on 
the surface and doesn't let itself become free and complicated: all the 
plot elements, while interesting, are only there to serve the theme, and 
it becomes less of a human story. When you think of either "The Trial" 
or "Eraserhead," you not only remember the complicated storylines and 
numerous themes, but you also remember the lead characters, respectively 
the irate but guilty Joseph K. (played by Anthony Perkins) and the 
lonely-to-a-fault Henry Spencer. Max, while interesting and greatly 
played by Sean Gullette, is still nothing much more than a catalyst to 
bring about the theme.</P>
<P>In fact, by the end, looking back on the plot, I was wondering if this 
was all there was. If this wasn't told the way it was, it'd be a totally 
forgettable albeit somewhat effective thriller (somewhat referring to 
the amount of horror that Jewish scholars and rabbis on your trail bring 
about). But it is told in a great fashion. Aronofsky is effective with 
his shot designs and camera movements, and his look has that of a 
nightmare, as if it was the world from the POV of a slightly deranged 
and cut-off genius, and we are quickly and effortlessly sucked into 
Max's world, and feel the pain and horror that he witnesses, like the 
way "The Trial" and "Eraserhead" are directed. And this world is as 
fresh and unique-looking as those two films. He's so effective that you 
soon ignore the plot, and concentrate on the hypnotic visuals that are 
being presented to us, so that later on you don't recall the potentially 
frightening elements of the plot but rather the insanity of the film's 
look. Great ending too; in fact, an unforgettable ending, just like the 
design of the film, but while you can't forget the images, do you even 
remember what it's about?</P>
