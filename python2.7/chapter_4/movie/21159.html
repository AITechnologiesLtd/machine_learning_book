<P>   Jane Austen once wrote, "Happiness in marriage is a
matter of chance."  The English novelist, whose works have
been the subject of many film revivals lately, once accepted a
man's proposal but got cold feet and backed down the
following morning.  Much of her thought and feeling infuse
her works, which at times appear so in-your-face
autobiographical that you wonder whether directors of movie
adaptations are creating biopics.  In the new Miramax film
"Mansfield Park"--culled and compressed to some extent from
her novel of the same name but also utilizing assorted notes
that Austen made over the years--the principal focus is on a
writer.  We need not ponder this character's real identity. Like
Austen herself, Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor) wrote
exuberant fantasies as a teen, some satiric histories, and
ultimately was able to set her more mature ideas on paper. 
While the novel showed Fanny to be restrained and passive,
Patricia Rozema--who directs this delightful, nay even
adorable picture--puts a contemporary spin on the tale of
romance, isolation, adultery, betray and snobbery.  And it
works.  Fanny becomes a virtual feminist icon, an
independent-minded, rebellious woman who knows her own
mind and will not settle for a man she does not love despite
the poverty that threatens to accompany her tenacious spirit.</P>
<P>   "Mansfield Park" displays some of the grandeur of previous
Austen adaptations but when compared to Douglas
McGrath's "Emma," Ang Lee's "Sense and Sensibility" and
even the relatively understated "Persuasion" of Roger Mitchell
comes across as almost a tightly-budgeted period piece.  The
capacious manor of the title and the views of the striking
English countryside across which glide stately carriages are
there, but with so much of the action taking place within the
walls of the estate, "Mansfield Park" could have enjoyed a
place on the commercial stage as well.  Even the obligatory
excesses usually present in dance scenes are curbed in favor
of an emphasis on close-ups of the performers' facial
expressions and body language.  These restrains may take
away from the opulence we've come to expect of, say,
Merchant-Ivory works but they serve to enhance the story's
wit, intelligence, occasionally pungent satire.</P>
<P>   In one scene of the story, Mary Crawford (Embeth
Davidtz), a manipulating, self-seeking member of the wealthy
family headed by Sir Thomas Betram (Harold Pinter),
declares, "After all, this is 1806"--making a point that people
should discuss business up front, without inhibition, even if
the intent is grasping.  The England of 1806 still tolerated
slavery, though the institution was soon to die and to threaten
the fortunes of many a rich estate including Sir Thomas
Bertram's.  While Bertram accumulated his wealth from the
work of his slaves in Antigua, Fanny Price, a member of the
family, continued to live in Portsmouth with her poverty-
stricken mother, who had married for love and was therefore
relegated to a harried life in a bug-infested shack.  As a favor
to her, Sir Thomas Bertram invites the young Fanny Price
(Hannah Taylor Gordon) to move into Mansfield Park, where
she is promptly put in her place by the snobbish Mrs. Norris
(Sheila Gish), who is the sister of both Mrs. Price and Lady
Bertram (Lindsay Duncan).  Though Norris instructs all that
the small girl is not the social equal of the rest of the family,
Fanny is befriended by her cousin Edmund (Jonny Lee
Miller), with whom she reads her secret letters and farcical
little history of England.  Years later, Fanny is pursued by the
charming Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola), a man who is
"loved by not loving"), getting a chance to fit into Mansfield
Park as an equal if she'd consent to his proposal of marriage. </P>
<P>   "Mansfield Park" is filled with perhaps more humor than
pathos, making it an eminently enjoyable viewing experience. 
Some of the amusement comes from the bad match
consciously made by Maria Bertram (Victoria Hamilton) with
the manor's foppish Mr. Rushworth (Hugh Bonneville),
propelling her to enter into an adulterous relationship with the
rakish Crawford.  The enervated Lady Bertram serves as a
regular sight gag, sleeping through much of the story under
the influence of opium and alcohol, her beloved pug resting
perpetually on her lap.  Political points are made as Bertram's
sickly son returns from Antigua, his notebook filled with
wrenching drawings of the slave trade there, while the
principal tension comes from the suppressed romantic
longings between Fanny and Edmund--the latter being the
one decent fellow in this dysfunctional family, who self-
destructively admires the conniving Mary while fearing his
passion for Fanny.</P>
<P>   Frances O'Connor, an Australian actress, gives her
character all the required depth.  Fanny, who is Jane
Austen's raisonneur, is intelligent, sharp-tongued, tenacious,
one who is willing to wait for Edmund to come around with a
marriage proposal.  The most touching moment in the story
comes when Edmund tells her toward the conclusion that he
has loved Fanny all his life.  Harold Pinter, yes the Harold
Pinter, makes one of his rare appearances on the screen as 
an authoritarian paterfamilias whose feelings about slavery
are about to invert, while Embert Davidtz turns out a
performance as a personality who is as intelligent as Fanny
but who uses her faculties in Machiavellian ways that lead to
her implosion.</P>
<P>   "Mansfield Park" gets its title from a chief judge of England
who had handed down a ruling limiting the practice of slavery
in his country.  In the film, director Rozema appropriately
gleans some characters from the novel while discarding
others for economy and dramatic impact, making this a
delightful (if unusually low-keyed for the genre) motion picture
experience.</P>
