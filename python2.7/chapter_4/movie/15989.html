<P>The latest collaboration of James Ivory, Ismail Merchant and Ruth Prawer 
Jhabvala is 'A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.'  Following the life of 
an American girl and her family living in Paris and later on Long 
Island, the film explores many of the sweet and sour moments of growing 
up.  It also convincingly depicts the bonds that glue together these 
lively Americans, though it reaches an ending that is flat and 
under-realized.</P>
<P>Because of his tough-guy reputation, one wouldn't think the American 
novelist James Jones (1921-77) would be a devoted husband and wise 
father.  If the real Jones resembled Bill Willis in Kaylie Jones' novel 
'A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,' then indeed he was a breaker of 
stereotypes.  Kris Kristofferson, who plays Bill Willis, paints his 
character with gruff but sweet strokes, and what comes across is a 
family man who will go to any lengths to protect his children and ensure 
their happiness.  Most viewers would agree he is a bit too liberal, 
encouraging his daughter and her current beau to sleep together in her 
bedroom, so at least they will not be doing it in cars.  Kristofferson 
hands in one of the strongest acting jobs in the film, with his 
straight-on approach and easy relationships with others in the cast.</P>
<P>And a strong ensemble it is, too.  Willis and his wife Marcella (Barbara 
Hershey) have a daughter Charlotte "Channe" (Luisa Conlon as a child, 
and as a teen, Leelee Sobieski), a child much adored by her French nanny 
Candida (Dominique Blanc).  James Jones saw action in the Pacific 
theater in World War 2, and was part of a second, post-war wave of 
American expatriates living in Paris.  Daughter Kaylie doubtless writes 
about herself in Channe, a girl much loved by her prosperous parents.  
The girl's world is at least mildly upset by the arrival of a boy from 
an orphanage, Benoit (Samuel Gruen and, later, Jesse Bradford).  Benoit 
soon adopts "Billy" after his new American dad, and we see several 
escapades starring Billy and Channe in which they grow close as brother 
and sister.  In one touching scene, young Channe invites Billy to sleep 
with her, as his bed is wet.  Gratefully he gathers his suitcase, which 
he carries everywhere in anticipation of another displacement, and 
follows his strange blond sister.</P>
<P>Once we know the characters and their situation, a three-part 
storytelling structure begins with the name "Billy" across the screen.  
His character is developed well in this segment, partly through his 
relationship with mother Marcella.  Hershey plays a rabidly protective 
mother who throws sand in the face of a teacher who has been confining 
Billy to the coat closet.  She loves Billy unconditionally and tells him 
frequently, most movingly when he expresses a type of survivor's guilt 
after Marcella has a miscarriage.  But the character to whom he relates 
the most is Channe, who seems to be the post to which the other 
characters are tethered.  Relationships in the story appear to go 
against type - there are a lot a group hugs going on - but the lack of 
dysfunction does not draw doubt from the viewer, and this is quite a 
feat of the depiction of sincerity.</P>
<P>'Francis' is the second name heading: Francis Fortesque, he of the 
brilliant ability and eccentric taste.  Think of child confidantes like 
Dill from 'To Kill a Mockingbird', or the little country boy from 'My 
Father's Glory'.  He's a good foil to Channe, drawing some of the 
negative attention away from her and even from Billy, who are having 
tough times adjusting to their new school.  Anthony Roth Costanzo lets 
himself loose as Francis, a boy nurtured by his mother but misunderstood 
by his peers - except the Willises.  Costanzo's performance is the 
centerpiece of the second narrative segment, though it falls off (along 
with the beloved presence of Candida) when the Willis family returns to 
the States.</P>
<P>'Daddy' is the third segment.  Because of a heart condition, Willis 
wants to be under the care of American doctors, and wishes his children 
to know more of their American roots (instead of becoming "Euro-trash 
brats" like many of their friends' children).  The film falls off a bit 
in its magnetic narration, perhaps because the family now lives in rural 
Long Island instead of a diverse European culture-haven.  But Bill 
Willis' relationship with Channe takes center stage, as he gives life 
lessons and directions for handling matters after his heart does him in.</P>
<P>Leelee Sobieski sports an uncanny resemblance to Helen Hunt as a 
teenager, tall and blond and willowy, eyes often partially shut in her 
insouciant manner.  Sobieski does nicely in portraying the conflicts, 
awkwardness and joy of adolescence.</P>
<P>The last minutes of the film stop the gradual momentum of the entire 
story.  I have not read the autobiographical novel, so I don't know 
about its end.  But director James Ivory seems to be missing an action 
to trigger the resonance he is after.</P>
<P>The film did not see wide distribution in the midwestern United States, 
an indicator that it is a "small" film.  Aside from the flatness of its 
conclusion, 'A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries' features a very likable 
and functional family growing together through the 1960s and '70s.  I 
would bring it home on video and enjoy it, although not with the entire 
family, as its language and sexual references label it with a big 'R'.</P>
