<P>         "We may be through with the past, but the past ain't through
with us." That line turns up again and again in "Magnolia," director
Paul Thomas Anderson's dizzying swing through the lives of an assortment
of L.A. residents, all of whom are troubled, mostly by unresolved
relationships or feelings they've tried to avoid. Rife with unexpected
outbursts, moments of catharsis and deeply funny observations about love
and sex, this is a film that runs you through the emotional wringer,
then shifts into reverse and pulls you back through again.</P>
<P> Running a generous three hours-plus, "Magnolia" allows Anderson
to give his cast room to explore all the corners of their characters.
Almost every one of the central figures gets a soul-revealing monologue,
making this a prime example of an actor's movie, and, for that matter, a
writer's movie as well.</P>
<P> It is not, however, a picture the average moviegoer is likely
to eat up. "Magnolia" shares with Anderson's previous film "Boogie
Nights" a fascination with detail and nuance, with taking scenes to
their limits and then daring to stretch them a little further to find
some extra scrap of emotion or a surprising twist. In one of the most
powerful sequences in "Boogie Nights," Heather Graham and Burt Reynolds,
as porno star Rollergirl and her director respectively, troll Los
Angeles in a limo looking for a guy who'll agree to be videotaped while
having sex with Rollergirl. The man they choose turns out to be a former
classmate of Rollergirl, which shakes her up, although she tries to
maintain a cool facade since she doesn't want the camera to see her get
flustered. Even after the episode's abrupt ending, Anderson lingered on
Graham's face, letting her eyes and lips spell out the battle going on
inside her mind between her passionless professionalism and the life she
left behind years ago.</P>
<P> There are many moments like this in "Magnolia," particularly
for "Boogie" veterans William H. Macy and Julianne Moore and for a
shockingly cast-against-type Tom Cruise. It's Cruise's performance
that's likely to get the most attention, since he's by far the
raunchiest and most unsettling presence in the film, a self-adoring
macho guru named Frank Mackey who pitches his anti-feminist "Seduce and
Destroy" workshops in a series of TV infomercials. Promising his
followers he can teach how to "make that lady 'friend' your sex-starved
slave," Frank is like a foul-mouthed high school jock blown up to
gargantuan proportions.</P>
<P> Macy's character is Donnie Smith, a former child prodigy who
never recovered from his early dose of celebrity and today works as a
salesman in an appliance store when he's not humiliating himself at the
neighborhood tavern, telling disinterested barflies "I used to be smart,
but now I'm just stupid." A blow-up of the $100,000 check he won on the
"What Do Kids Know?" game show hangs on his living room wall, a constant
reminder of how far he's fallen. He's also miserably lonely, confiding
to strangers "I really do have love to give, I just don't know where to
put it."</P>
<P> Moore's Linda Partridge, on the other hand, went out of her way
to sidestep love by marrying solely for money. Now, as her husband Earl
(Jason Robards) slowly dies at home, Linda is completely consumed with
self-hatred and erupts at everyone she comes into contact with, from the
family lawyer to an obnoxious pharmacist who makes cracks about her
Prozac prescription.</P>
<P> No one would want to identify with any of these people, and the
actors don't try to make them likable. Quite the contrary: Moore, Macy
and Cruise seem determined to show us just how unattractive and pathetic
Frank, Linda and Donnie really are by showing all their defense
mechanisms, their explosions of anger and their inability to understand
themselves.</P>
<P> "Magnolia" also zooms in on some folks who are suffering in
silence, such as Officer Jim (John C. Reilly), a divorced cop and devout
Catholic who's so eager for companionship he tries to pick up Claudia
(Melora Walters), an obvious cokehead he investigates for disturbing the
peace. The timid, bookwormish Stanley (Jeremy Blackman) is the current
champion on "What Do Kids Know?" and, to judge from appearances, a
likely candidate to follow in Donnie's footsteps. Phil Parma (Philip
Seymour Hoffman), Earl's nurse, channels his energy into a frantic
last-minute search for Earl's long-estranged son and quietly endures
disapproving Linda's abuse.</P>
<P> The thoughts these people can't bring themselves to speak come
through in the searing songs of Aimee Mann, which string together the
movie's various parallel plots. "Come on and save me," Mann pleads in
her delicate, bruised voice, "from the ranks of the freaks who suspect
they could never love anyone." This is not a film in which the
soundtrack was slapped on at the last minute. In one of "Magnolia"'s
most stirring scenes, each of the major characters is glimpsed singing
along to Mann's ballad "Wise Up" shortly before Anderson unleashes a
climax so startling and utterly bizarre it should cement his reputation
as one of the most audacious filmmakers around. James Sanford</P>
