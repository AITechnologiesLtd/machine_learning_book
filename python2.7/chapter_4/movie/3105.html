<PRE>                          STAR TREK: GENERATIONS
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1994 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<PRE>        REVIEW IN SHORT: An acceptable sequel.  Not the best of the
        seven films, but noticeably more memorable than the last two
        films of the series.  On Mark's scale (-4 to +4) a +0.5.</PRE>
<P>     The seventh film in the "Star Trek" series is the first to
introduce the cast of the wildly successful "Next Generation" series to
the silver screen.  As a transitional film between the original series'
cast (TOS) and the new (TNG) it does it job adequately, but not
spectacularly.  The scenes with Captain Kirk (William Shatner) feel
forced and unnecessary, as if they were a late addition to the script
to give Bill another paycheck.  The inclusion of Kirk coupled with the
absence of Spock (Leonard Nimoy) makes these portions of the movie feel
even more out of place.</P>
<P>     Other than Kirk, the plot is good, jumping from one climax to
another in a dizzying spiral, before crashing back to earth with a long
interlude featuring Kirk and Picard (Patrick Stewart).  The resolution
is predictable, but not childish.</P>
<P>     The effects work is outstanding, especially a long sequence
showing a starship crash-landing on a planets surface.  I saw the film
in a DTS equipped theater and the total effect was nothing short of
stunning.</P>
<P>     There are numerous references to TNG episodes, including a rather
humorous resolution to Data's "emotion chip" and an appearance by two
Klingon villains.</P>
<P>     The movie is no STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN or STAR TREK IV:
THE VOYAGE HOME but it will satisfy most "Star Trek" fans while
establishing a credible baseline for future films featuring only the
"Next Generation" cast.</P>
