<PRE>                                 SCREAMERS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: After a bit of updating, SCREAMERS is
          a fairly accurate version of Philip K. Dick's 1953
          story.  Unfortunately, it takes more than that to
          make a science fiction film that stands out from
          the crowd.  Dick's 50s paranoia comes across today
          as pretty tame stuff that other films have done
          better.  This is just another cold SF film set in a
          high-tech but grungy world.  Rating: low +1 (-4 to
          +4)</PRE>
<P>     Most of Philip K.  Dick's science fiction deals with paranoia
about reality not being what it seems, or people who are not what they
seem, or just something sinister going on behind the curtain.  Films
that have been based on his writing include BLADE RUNNER, about
androids that look human, and TOTAL RECALL, about a reality that may be
coming off a tape.  Paranoia has its place in SCREAMERS also, though
more in later portions of the film.  The film is based on Dick's 1953
story "Second Variety."</P>
<P>     That original story was set on Earth in a disastrous war with
Russia, but to keep the story current the setting has been moved to the
planet Sirius 6B where the 2078 war is with the "New Economic Block."
The best American weapon is a "screamer," a small robot that attacks
from just under the surface of the ground.  It tunnels with lightning
speed, pops out of the ground, and with the same speed rabidly attacks
with whirling blades and deafening screams.  The Alliance soldiers,
most of whom are Americans, have special devices that prevent them from
being detected by the screamers.  The problem is that screamers have
themselves become intelligent and are creating new varieties of
screamer radically different from what came before them.  And they are
unaware that compatibility with the detection jammers were an important
part of their original design.  The new models attack anybody.</P>
<P>     The original story has been adapted by Dan O'Bannon (a creative
force behind ALIEN) and Miguel Tejada-Flores (writer of FRIGHT NIGHT,
PART II).  The problem with SCREAMERS is that the original story, while
obvious film fodder, just does not have a lot of ideas that have not
already been plundered for other films.  The Dick story itself borrows
much of its paranoia from stories like John Campbell's "Who Goes
There?" which has already been adapted twice to film.  Had SCREAMERS
been made in 1980 it would have achieved classic status.  But the
thrills offered by "Second Variety" are too little and too late--years
late.  Ironically, SCREAMERS will appeal mostly to people in widely
separate groups.  It will seem best to those open to science fiction
action films without much experience with them.  And it will appeal to
super die-hard Dick fans.  The range that stretches between including
most science fiction fans will find too little that is new or
interesting about the film.</P>
<P>     The director is Canadian Christian Duguay, who did most of his
filming on the snowy landscapes of Quebec and in the grungy sets that
are now so cliched for post-holocaust and futuristic stories.  Coming
out at the same time as the releases of CITY OF LOST CHILDREN and 12
MONKEYS only makes the sets look more impoverished than they normally
would.  The only really familiar actor is Peter Weller, who seems to be
majoring in playing stories about paranoia and general weirdness.</P>
<P>     SCREAMERS is a low-budget film that has a few expensive
explosions, but the matte artist simply does not seem to be able to do
convincing work.  This adaptation of Philip K. Dick's "Second Variety"
offers far too little variety from what has come before and comes in
second to far too many films.  Rate it a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
