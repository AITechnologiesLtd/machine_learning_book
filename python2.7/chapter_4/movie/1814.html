                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  John Turturro plays a character based
     on his own father in a film he directs and also co-wrote.
     Turturro proves that the lives of a family of carpenters is
     no less interesting than the lives of a family of criminals.
     Surprisingly entertaining.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     The vast majority of employed people in this country have rarely, if
ever, seen someone in the same occupation portrayed in the movies.  There
are maybe fifty or so professions that show up in films and fewer that have
a major part in the plot of the film.  Presumably from the filmmakers'
viewpoint, other professions just are not dramatic.  But, in fact, many
people's stories are dramatic and they do take risks, have dreams, and in
general have stories worth telling.  John Turturro's father, Nicholas
Turturro, built houses.  In the family his adventures in that profession
made interesting conversation, but could the story be transferred to film in
a way that would make anyone want to come to see the film?  John Turturro
apparently thought so, and proves his point with MAC.</P>
<P>     John Turturro plays Niccolo "Mac" Vitelli, a carpenter and brother to
two carpenters and the son of a third.  Mac's father is a genuine craftsman,
but the three brothers work for a Polish builder who takes no pride in work
and who looks for shortcuts to cheat the customer.  Mac gets fed up and,
together with his brothers Vito (played by Michael Badalucco) and Bruno
(played by Carl Capotorto), forms a partnership to compete with his old
boss.  Mac has an eye for detail and assembles a team of quality builders,
but financial problems follow and haunt him.  Even worse, Mac's explosive
temper more than once nearly ruins the family's dreams.  The film also
focuses on the private lives of the brothers.  Mac finds a wife (played by
Katherine Borowitz), but Vito and Bruno both like an attractive beatnik
(played by Ellen Barkin).</P>
<P>     While the screenplay by Turturro and Branden Cole is episodic, it is
nevertheless surprisingly intriguing.  In fact, for interest value MAC holds
it own against films about men building their dreams like BUGSY or TUCKER,
even though the main character has nowhere near the notoriety that Bugsy
Siegel or even Preston Tucker had.  The film has a nice portrait of an
Italian-American family in the 1940 and 1950s.  Turturro plays his role with
an intensity bordering on over-acting at times.  Still, this is an
intelligent treatment of a story unlikely to be made into a film.  I give
this one a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
