Rated PG.</P>
<P>Have parents not complained about the current lack of wholesome family
entertainment? Have critics not bashed the film industry for not putting
out movies that can entertain children without bombarding them with
high-tech special effects? They have, making the fact that Shiloh 2:
Shiloh Season wasn't a box office hit all the more a surprise. It went
nowhere during its admittedly limited theatrical release which signifies
a certain hypocrisy on the part of some parents: how can they rant that
there isn't anything good for their children to watch and then when
something good hits the screens not seek it out?</P>
<P>Shiloh Season is based on the novel of the same name by Phyllis Reynolds
Naylor and it is a sequel to Shiloh, likewise both a novel and a movie.
The first film had little Marty Preston attempting to save a mistreated
beagle from Judd Travers, its cruel owner and the town drunk. He managed
to get the dog and keep it but Judd isn't over it yet. He wants revenge
and he wants the dog back.</P>
<P>Marty, I suspect, would rather give away his little sister than his
beloved beagle so to him, giving the dog back to Judd to avoid trouble
is out of the question. He blatantly refuses and his father (Michael
Moriarty) supports him. But Judd isn't ready to give up so easily. He
begins to blame Marty for various things that mysteriously happen around
his residence, such as his mailbox being knocked over, his truck getting
scratched and his dogs being set loose and biting Marty's sister. Marty
insists that he didn't do any of those things; we, along with his
parents, believe him.</P>
<P>Marty wants to see if he can change Judd; make him a better person by
being nice to him. That's a refreshingly simple concept: here is a
person deeply scarred by events of his childhood, so what better way is
there to change him than to show him compassion? A little kindness, as
opposed to a lot of therapy, goes a long way.</P>
<P>Inspector Gadget this ain't. In fact, Shiloh Season has an almost
frustratingly no-frills attitude; in part, I'm sure, because of its
limited budget but also because it is interested in emphasizing good
values rather than cool effects. That's not to say that it doesn't
entertain in the process: kids will love it and adults who allow
themselves to be won over by it should not be squirming in their seats.
It's a family film, not a kid flick; a movie that might be targeted at
the young ones but can be enjoyed by the parents as well.</P>
<P>What this isn't is the story of a boy and his dog; it's a part of the
plot but a minor one. You'll be hard-pressed to find a moment where
director Sandy Tung tries to get an "Aaaaaaw" out of the audience with
Shiloh's cuteness. Instead, it's a simple but sincere exploration of
human nature. What makes "bad" people? Can we change them? If we can,
how? These are questions that Shiloh Season tries to answer for kids
while leaving enough open for discussions with parents. It's a fun
movie, but it's also, in its own right, an important one.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, with all the big-budget "family" films around, not a lot
of kids want to see stuff like this, and in accordance to the laws of
supply and demand, not a lot of it is released. That is a reason why,
now that Shiloh Season is on video, you should rent it. Don't deny
yourself or your kids the experience of a moral, wholesome family film;
now a rare breed.
