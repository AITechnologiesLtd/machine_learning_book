<P>The fortunes of the Merchant-Ivory producer-director team have suffered
somewhat in recent years; efforts like Jefferson in Paris and Surviving
Picasso have garnered mixed reviews and little box-office interest. There
was a time, though, when the duo's trademark period pieces were virtually
guaranteed critical approval; among their best efforts were 1986's Room
With a View and 1992's Howards End, both of which gave the team something
of a reputation for sumptuous costume dramas with melodramatic plotlines.
Perhaps their finest effort, however, came in 1993 with Remains of the
Day--which, though it fits the customary period-piece mold in some
respects, succeeds on a wholly different level.</P>
<P>The setting is southern England, and the time flashes back and forth
between the late 1950s and the 1930s. Darlington Hall, once a bustling
mansion and estate, has fallen on hard times, owned now by an American and
run by a skeleton staff. Mr. Stevens, the butler, perceives the need for a
"revised staff plan" and sets off across England in hopes of rehiring a
woman who had once served as housekeeper. The trip serves as an occasion
for Stevens to reflect on his life of service and on the decisions he has
made in his service to Lord Darlington, a well-meaning fellow who
developed both sympathies and close contacts with Nazi Germany as the
Second World War approached. Stevens, for his part, professed loyalty to
his employer, but the course of the film brings out doubts about both the
wisdom of that loyalty and its consequences.</P>
<P>Remains is an adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's book, a novel acclaimed in
its own right but hardly, at first glance, suitable for film treatment.
The novel is set down in the form of Stevens's thoughts and writings: the
reader often detects his doubts under a veneer of excuses and
justifications for his own and for others' conduct. As such, it plays with
tensions between the subjective and objective: to determine what happened,
it is now and again necessary to discount the narrator's words as
self-serving deception, or look askance at thoughts or feelings that the
narrator imputes to himself in memory. Filtering the audience's viewpoint
through a subjective account in this way would be a difficult task for a
film, and this one doesn't really try: instead, it relies on the story
itself, and its themes of loyalty and self-denial. There is accordingly
not quite so much to chew on here as in the novel, and certain scenes
documenting Stevens's struggling conscience don't work quite as well--but
the acting more than makes up for it.</P>
<P>It is sometimes said that Anthony Hopkins plays a limited range of roles,
that many of his parts are reprises of the same repressed or inexpressive
type. If nothing else, his performance as Stevens in Remains is evidence
to the contrary: though he inhabits a role and a persona that require
permanent composure, he nonetheless manages to convey a wide range of
feelings. Hopkins is a master of nuance: a blink, a set of the jaw, a
voice inflection often must suffice to express his character's conflicts
or longings. Particularly compelling in that respect are those moments
when he is off his guard or unsure: there is a hilarious moment early in
the film when he is called on to explain the "birds and the bees" to Lord
Darlington's godson. (The scene is all the funnier now, since the godson
is played by none other than Hugh Grant, who turned out to have some
knowledge of the subject.) Hopkins plays a man struggling to fill a role,
and it is in the moments where he cannot quite fill it--the moments that
strain his powers of composure--that his talents really shine. Few actors
could do as much with this role as Hopkins does here; he was nominated for
Best Actor for this role, and it is arguable that he should have won.
Equally compelling is Emma Thompson as Miss Kenton, the housekeeper who
shakes up Stevens's carefully ordered world: much of her part is given
over to testing his limits and trying to draw him out. Though the role is
thereby limited, she has her moments, notably in a scene where she mocks
his mannerisms ("the way you pinch your nose when you put pepper on your
food"). A particularly memorable scene shows her backing him into a corner
to wrest a book from his grasp; the book plays it mostly for laughs ("I
judged it best to look away, but...this could only be achieved by my
twisted my head away at a somewhat unnatural angle"), but the film brings
out the sudden intimacy of the moment. James Fox is convincingly
well-intentioned as the naive Lord Darlington, and Peter Vaughan is
suitably gruff as Stevens's father, but the film's power derives from the
performa of the leads--and the emotional impact of its last third is
considerable.</P>
<P>There is a tremendous amount going on in Remains, enough that it bears
repeated viewing (seven times over for me); there are two fully developed
plotlines that intertwine to some extent, and several subplots deriving
from them. The Nazi-appeasement angle, even if its main function is to
cast in harsh light Stevens's devotion to duty (and, through his
employer's flirting with fascism, to put a disturbing spin on that
devotion), takes up a considerable part of the story: the flashbacks chart
the increasing depth of Darlington's involvement with Germany. In the
book, the tension between Stevens's claim to be proud of his association
with Darlington and his evasiveness (and outright lying) when asked about
his connection to the Nazi appeaser is a major insight into the truths
that he would rather not confront, and serves as a catalyst for some
unwilling reflection. In the film, though some of the same scenes appear,
they are not as obviously significant (or their significance is couched
differently). The second plotline, that of Stevens himself (and, most
obviously, his relationship with Miss Kenton), is the more compelling of
the two--Darlington, the tragic figure of the first plot, doesn't really
get enough attention to command the audience's sympathy in the way that
Stevens does. Accordingly, the first storyline gets pushed to the
background toward the end, to the point that an important development in
the Nazi- connection angle that occurs near the end feels rather
unexpected. One of the subplots highlighting Stevens' character involves
Stevens's father's illness and death, which Stevens manages to turn into a
test on his "dignity" rather than a time of personal loss; again, the book
brings out these tensions somewhat better, in that his final word on the
memory is to proclaim it a personal "triumph," but the film does show the
constricted exchanges between father and son in a way that feels, again,
compelling. The impressive part is that the script makes develops
Stevens's character--and, again, his relationship with Miss Kenton--mostly
through indirection; never does he give a soul-baring speech, never do the
two actually voice their feelings. So nuanced is the acting that
apparently ordinary moments feel emotionally charged simply because they
violate the confines of the central relationship, and the audience does
not need to be told explicitly what is on a given character's mind.</P>
<P>As might be expected from Merchant-Ivory, the film looks remarkable: the
interiors of Darlington Hall are elaborate, both in their prewar splendor
and their latter-day emptiness. Visually, there are many effective
moments, both on the large scale--a fox hunt, an opening tracking shot
that moves up a twisting driveway--and small: both Hopkins and Thompson
are plausible as twenty-years-older versions. Especially effective are the
early scenes, where ghosts of bygone years seem to appear to Stevens
around every corner, and Miss Kenton appears, walking in a back corridor,
before fading and dissolving into mist. There is some disagreement on the
last shot--some critics consider its imagery too obvious--but for simple
emotional impact, it works to perfection. Richard Robbins's score, for its
part, captures the repetitiveness of a servant's life, and the contrasting
emotional drama, fairly well, though at times it seems oddly placed.</P>
<P>As a film, Remains stands or falls on the effectiveness of Hopkins, both
in conveying the essentials of the character and in making him
sympathetic. And by and large, he succeeds on both counts: he makes those
moments where Stevens must deny himself and take up his cross feel genuine
and painful, rather than simply depictions of a repressed butler who has
become accustomed to repression. Rather than simply playing an inhibited
character, Hopkins plays a character who feels that his vocation demands
that he mask his feelings (a "dignity in keeping with his position"), and
when the mask slips slightly at key moments--the one small scene in
private where he loses his composure entirely works all the better for his
icy calm when back in public again--the effect is riveting. With a lead
less skilled than Hopkins, this could have been dreary and dull; as it is,
it packs quite a punch. Though not exactly uplifting, Remains deserves
consideration among the decade's best films. </P>

<P>The room is as you left it; your last touch--
A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself
As saintly--hallows now each simple thing,
Hallows and glorifies, and glows between
The dust's gray fingers, like a shielded light.</P>
