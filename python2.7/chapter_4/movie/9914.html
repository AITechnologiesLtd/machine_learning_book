<PRE>                             HAPPY TOGETHER
                         (CHEUN GWONG TSA SIT)
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     From Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai,the writer and director of
the highly regarded CHUNG KING EXPRESS (CHONGQING SENLIN), comes HAPPY
TOGETHER (CHEUN GWONG TSA SIT).  HAPPY TOGETHER tells the story of a
gay Chinese couple in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who are anything but
happy.  The story, to the extent there is any, consists of a series of
vignettes about their petty fights.</P>
<P>     In this two person drama Leslie Cheung Kwok-Wing plays Ho Po-Wing
and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai plays Lai Yiu-Fai.  Leslie was last seen in
TEMPTRESS MOON (FENG YUE) and Tony in CYCLO (XICH LO).  Both are quite
capable actors, but the parts they are given in HAPPY TOGETHER almost
dares the audience to care.  Their lifeless performances are right in
line with Wong's dreadfully dull screenplay.</P>
<P>     Although the movie contains some of the most graphic homosexual
scenes I've encountered, the actors present no passion or love during
them with the result that the scenes are coldly antiseptic.</P>
<P>     Most of the movie has them arguing with each other, complaining
about the lack of jobs in Argentina and living a life of poverty in
their (literally) flea-bag room.  Never is the narrative interesting
and rarely are the characters the least bit compelling.</P>
<P>     The picture has a single saving grace.  The cinematography by
Christopher Doyle punctuates the otherwise uninvolving scenes with
fascinating images.  Although Doyle's work in HAPPY TOGETHER is not
nearly as good as his stunning work in TEMPTRESS MOON, he enlivens an
otherwise tedious picture.  Using both oversaturated black-and-white
sequences and lush color ones, he keeps the audience's attention even
when the story doesn't.  One evocative scene has our two lonely leads
stranded on the highway.  Shooting from a distance, the black-and-white
highway seems as infinite as Tony and Lai's troubles.  Another scene is
shot from high above the city streets.  Using color at night and a
strobe effect, the cars dart around the turns like colored rats in a
maze.</P>
<P>     "Turns out that normal people are all the same," concludes Lai.
Similarly, the movie HAPPY TOGETHER has a dreary sameness to each of
its vignettes, only the handsome cinematography saves it from being an
unwatchable, boring film.</P>
<P>     HAPPY TOGETHER seems to go on forever but its running time is
actually only 1:37.  The picture is in Cantonese with Chinese and
English subtitles.  The film is not rated but would get an R for
nudity, profanity, violence and graphic sex.  The film is not
appropriate for teenagers.</P>
