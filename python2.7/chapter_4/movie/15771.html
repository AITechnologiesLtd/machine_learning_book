<P>Near the end of 1996, analysts remarked that the year would be the last
in which Disney would stand alone as the animation king. The following
year, 1997, saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio
other than the Magic Kingdom: Twentieth Century Fox gave baronial Russia
to the masses in the form of ANASTASIA. At best, that's all it was -- a
sleeper hit, designed to surprise but not shake the industry. In 1998,
however, things have been decidedly different. There have been a number
of pushes on Disney's death grip on the market, and fifty-one weeks into
'98, a new champion has emerged. </P>
<P>DreamWorks' THE PRINCE OF EGYPT succeeds where all of the other
conventionally animated products have failed. The other two contenders,
Warner Brothers' QUEST FOR CAMELOT and Disney's own annual entry, MULAN,
lacked inspiration and drive respectively. Although CAMELOT was
borderline-abysmal, and can't really be considered a shot at the title,
MULAN had the makings of winner. Unfortunately, it was saturated with
traditional, Disney-cute animation, and lost points against the
rapidly-changing face of the competition. In making THE PRINCE OF EGYPT,
DreamWorks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a
genuinely unique product. </P>
<P>The animation is flawless, and, aside from A BUG'S LIFE, is the
best-looking movie to date. The animators have nimbly mixed both flat
and spatial effects, and the 2D/3D combination is something that artists
from Disney and Fox have heretofore struggled with. The key to success,
however, was that the visuals were used not just because they looked
cool but also as a method of advancing the plot. Namely, some of the
most important action sequences (like the parting of the Red Sea) were
done almost entirely in 3D. DreamWorks is the first studio to prove that
they've got the stuff of success, and that they're capable of
challenging Disney. </P>
<P>The story is also well-written, and the characters voiced with talent.
For the most part, the plot follows its source material -- the Book of
Exodus -- although only in the most general sense. The writers took a
few creative liberties, and most do not damage the story in any way. In
fact, the Shakespearean relationship between Moses (Val Kilmer) and the
Pharaoh Rameses (Ralph Fiennes) makes the story more interesting if
anything. Moses, a Hebrew, is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn
sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the Nile; he floats
into the Pharaoh Seti (Patrick Stewart)'s palace and is taken in by the
royal family. Moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into
the desert, where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by
God to return to Egypt and free the slaves. By this time, Rameses is now
Pharaoh, and the two brothers, now on opposite sides of the line, face
off in a battle of wills and divine intervention. </P>
<P>The cast of voices is most impressive, and also includes such noteables
as Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, and Steve Martin. The
script does not have a lot of one-liners in it, and God is reduced to a
voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to Kevin
Costner in FIELD OF DREAMS, but overall the story is exciting and
interesting. It's decidedly for an older crowd, and the tykes who
haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost. But
for those who make the bid, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT can be a great watch.</P>
