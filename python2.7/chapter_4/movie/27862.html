THE CROSSING
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>In writer/director Yoichi Higashi's THE CROSSING (BOKU NO OJISAN), Koji 
(Michitaka Tsutsui) is a graphics designer whose life is falling apart.  
His ad campaign for Sunny Advertising is not meeting with the approval 
of his managers.  His girlfriend is going to leave him.  His father has 
died so heavily in debt that they don't dare have a funeral, lest 
creditors show up demanding money.  And his junior high school nephew 
has been arrested for holding up the post office with a kitchen butcher 
knife.  It was a botched robbery attempt that looks like it was a plea 
for help.  </P>
<P>Although handsomely filmed and respectably acted, the thin script never 
gets us involved.  The movie drifts along without giving us much reason 
to care about the events.  The film does make a few cute statements 
about the rudeness and pomposity of some cell phone users.  In one 
scene, Koji tosses a cell phone out the window of a bus when its user 
becomes obnoxiously loud next to him.  In another, he takes a small pad 
and holds it like a phone to the side of his face as he walks down a 
busy Tokyo street.  Elevating himself to an executive position in a 
non-existent firm, he conducts important conversations in the same 
boisterous voice as those around him.</P>
<P>THE CROSSING runs a long 1:56.  The film is in Japanese with English 
subtitles.</P>
