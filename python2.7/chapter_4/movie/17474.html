<P>One of the problems with "The Mod Squad," otherwise known as a cool, or 
"hip" group of people, is that the three main characters never earn that 
sleek, exclusive title. Oh, sure, they make think they're cool, but 
there is never any evidence that they actually are, and when one minor 
character asks them at the end, "what do you all think you are? Some 
sort of mod squad or something?," it felt contrived and phony, a 
desperate attempt to make some sort of revelance come from the name.</P>
<P>Based on the cult Aaron Spelling crime-drama series that ran from 
1968-1973, the show and film's premise is simple enough: three troubled 
youths, recovered drug addict Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), ex-arsonist 
Linc (Omar Epps), and goofy robber Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi), agree 
to help out the San Francisco police and become undercover cops (minus 
any sort of weapons) in place of serving time in jail. You'd think the 
work would be a sort of community service but I guess not, since the 
three young adults are obviously paid enough to own their own 
apartments. Anyway, getting back to the story at hand, the three are 
assigned by their superior, Capt. Adam Greer (Dennis Farina), to scope 
out a night club that may or may not be involved in a prostitution ring. 
Soon, Greer has been murdered, and thinking that they may be blamed for 
the crime, Julie, Linc, and Pete set out to find the real culprits.</P>
<P>"The Mod Squad" is such a terminally thin, virtually motionless action 
film that it is only luck it contains many things surrounding the 
convoluted plotline that actually are worthwhile. Claire Danes, a 
wonderful actress who began her acting career with the best television 
drama of the '90s, "My So-Called Life," which met a premature burial but 
can still be found on MTV and home video, has appeared in several 
feature films since then, but none have been able to rise to her 
ability. Although beautiful and obtaining a hard-edged amiableness in 
many of her roles, judging from her latest picture, she should try and 
choose her projects better. Giovanni Ribisi, also a talented actor (just 
watch 1998's indie "First Love, Last Rites," and the recent "The Other 
Sister" if you don't believe me), I'm afraid is beginning to get 
typecast as the "silly" character used for comic relief. Here, that is 
exactly what Ribisi does, and it is the way he is instructed to act that 
began to grate on my nerves in the first half, although he was able to 
flesh out his character a little bit towards the end. Finally, Omar 
Epps, so very good in 1995's "Higher Learning," really doesn't have that 
much substantial material to work with, but still gives a respectable 
turn. Together, the three work fetchingly as a team, and this is the 
film's one saving grace, even if it still, unfortunately, isn't able to 
buoy the proceedings so that the film can be necessarily recommended. 
Some sort of pseudo-relationship arises near the end between Danes and 
Ribisi, but the movie never follows through with it, leaving the whole 
subplot to be a rather pointless waste of time. Aside from these three 
actors, the other characters mostly show up, read some lines, leave, and 
cash a paycheck. Michael Lerner should especially be embarrassed since 
he is given a ridiculous scene in which he forces Epps to dance with 
him. Huh? Where did that come from?</P>
<P>Even if "The Mod Squad" never proves to be what I would call stylish or 
cool, the funky music score, by BC Smith, definately is. Mixing '90s 
music with a groovy '70s-style score that often sounds suited for a 
blaxploitation movie, was a far more original and effective technical 
choice than anything else in the movie. One particular scene that jumped 
startlingly to life thanks solely to the music was a protracted 
comic-action sequence set at a carwash.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the suspension of disbelief is tried many times throughout, 
with the apartment and Lerner-Epps dance sequence examples already 
given, as well as in the action finale in which Danes and Ribisi jump 
out of a car going at least 55mph onto the hard pavement, only to have 
Danes jump up and begin run as if nothing had just happened. Nevermind 
the fact that we had just gotten finished seeing her stunt double smash 
onto the road like a pancake. Also, one of the on-going jokes during the 
climax is the references to the "Lethal Weapon" series. "I feel like I 
should say we're getting too old for this s***," Pete says. "At least we 
aren't going to end up in some old, abandoned warehouse," Julie chimes 
in. And guess what? That is the exact place that they end up at! At once 
passingly clever, this sort of humor really doesn't work well in films, 
since it is both predictable and obviously a strain for original ideas.</P>
<P>During the running time of "The Mod Squad," I saw three promising young 
actors with a surprising amount of chemistry together, but nonetheless 
wasting their times; some entertaining music that fit the picture well; 
a few honest character scenes that made me yearn for more time to learn 
about the people; and a story that is as old as the hills, with all of 
the so-called "twists" being telegraphed far in advance, particularly in 
dealing with Julie's old boyfriend (Josh Brolin) who miraculously comes 
back into her life. For all of its virtues, "The Mod Squad" does not do 
justice to its "Mod" title. Basically, it really is just a cliched 
"Lethal Weapon"-ish action movie masquerading as something more.</P>
