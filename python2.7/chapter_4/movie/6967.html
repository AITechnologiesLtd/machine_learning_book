<PRE>                              ABSOLUTE POWER
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1997 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>ABSOLUTE POWER ** Directed by Clint Eastwood. Written by William Goldman
from the novel of David Baldacci. Photography, Jack N. Green. Editing, Joel
Cox. Production design, Henry Bumstead. Music, Lennie Niehaus. Cast: Clint
Eastwood (Luther Whitney),Gene Hackman (President Alan Richmond), Ed Harris
(Detective Seth Frank), Laura Linney (Kate Whitney), Judy Davis (Gloria
Russell), Scott  Glenn (Bill Burton), Dennis Haysbert (Tim Collin), E.G.
Marshall (Walter Sullivan), Melora Hardin (Christy Sullivan). A Sony
release from Columbia Pictures of a Castle Rock presentation of a Malpaso
production. 120 min. R (violence)</P>
<P>The historian John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton (1834-1902), who became
Lord Acton of Aldenham in 1869, was the first great modern philosopher of
resistance to the evil state. He stressed morality above all. Though known
mostly to specialists today, millions (mis)quote his aphorism, from a
letter he wrote to Bishop Mandell Creighton in 1887:  "Power tends to
corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."</P>
<P>In theory it is hard to resist a political thriller with the explicit title
"Absolute Power," especially when it is by and with Clint Eastwood in his
familiar persona as an enemy of misused and abusive authority. Enticing too
is that Clint plays an master cat burglar, an avocation beloved by readers
and moviegoers --vide Cary Grant in "To Catch a Thief" or The Saint.</P>
<P>Yet, except  for one dud ("The Rookie") the film is not in the league of
Eastwood-directed works since 1990: the shamefully neglected "White Hunter,
Black Heart," "Unforgiven," the acceptable "A Perfect World,""The Bridges
of Madison County."  In spite of changes by sometimes excellent
screenwriter William Goldman, "Absolute Power" does not raise the shabby
source novel to any heights, or add anything to the spate of pictures about
US. Presidents. Though the actors and techniques are very good and
polished, the plot is a salad of incoherences, disconnections and non
sequiturs, arbitrary moves, laughable incredibilities, improbabilities and
impossibilites, coincidences and plot craters. Over those ingredients is
poured a sauce of movie cliches.</P>
<P>The story centers around aging, much decorated Army veteran and veteran
thief Luther Whitney, played with the steely nerves, the cool, the
tongue-in-cheek humor expected of Eastwood. One night, he burglarizes a
mansion to end all mansions, defeating in ho-hum seconds state-of-the art
locks and security systems. (There's a dumb gag that Luther is unable to
program his VCR). As he moves carefully in semi-darkness, he glimpses
paintings by masters and other art treasures. The sequence has good tension
but is stretched out, as if the filmmakers wanted to get their money's
worth for their elaborate movie set.</P>
<P>Luther fills his bag with millions in jewelry, coins and cash. Sudden
noises force him to retreat behind a most convenient two-way mirror. He
watches a dissolute older man (Gene Hackman) and a trampish young woman
(Melora Hardin) both drunk and playing sexual games. These turn violent. As
the man seems ready to strangle his companion, she stabs his leg with a
letter-opener. In a flash,two men materialize and shoot her dead.They're
Secret Service men who guard U.S. President Alan Richmond.</P>
<P>The playmate turns out to be the young, openly and regularly unfaithful
second wife of widower Walter Sullivan (E.G.Marshall) a tycoon in his
eighties. His flushed complexion speaks of illness or alcohol. He is a
king-maker, a very good FOA (Friend Of Alan's).  "I gave him the
Presidency" he says later.</P>
<P>A cover-up follows, led by Chief of Staff Gloria Russell, played by Judy
Davis  with  campy black humor. The hunt for the killer is on. Luther is a
major suspect because, as per the old cliche "there are only seven men" who
can burglarize so well.</P>
<P>That Clint can be very likable is a given. But he allows his film to grow
exponentially  absurd. To flesh it out, newish widower Luther has an
estranged daughter, Kate. She is cute, unattached, and of all things, a
prosecutor. You can sniff instantly the reconciliation to come. Or the
mutual attraction between Kate and chief investigating detective Seth Frank
(Ed Harris). He too is conveniently unattached."I live by myself" is his
leitmotif to Kate. Frank is nice, decent, well-mannered, simpatico.
Eastwood and Harris have by far the best scene as they lunch together, play
wittily cat-and-mouse, and like each other.</P>
<P>In a baffling scene, Luther, about to catch a plane and disappear abroad,
is at the airport. He sees on  TV the President delivering a piously
hypocritical declaration concerning his "like-a-father-to-me" mentor
Sullivan. Instantly Luther decides to stick around and do the right thing.
Had he not realized that the man he had watched through the mirror was the
President? Go figure.</P>
<P>Try also to make sense of the many appearances of key people in places
where they couldn't possibly be. Or how they get to their desinations in
mere minutes. Or how quick-change artist Luther disguises himself so fast.</P>
<P>I have a weakness for disguises. My first publications, in a children's
magazine, were signed "Detective X" after my pulp fiction hero in stories
by Brand House. "X" had a stupendous ability for instant transformations
that made him a clone of anyone he wished to impersonate. Still, to quote
Corinthians: "When I was a child, I spake as child, I understood as a
child, I thought as child; but when I became a man, I put away childish
things." Like suspension of outrageous disbelief.</P>
<P>In another mega-silly sequence, for reasons hard to fathom, a cafe meeting
is set up between Kate and her dad. Dozens of Washington, D.C. cops,
sharpshooters and marked cars skulk around --but no Army tanks or rocket
launchers. Yet no one seems to notice. There's also a gunman hired by old
man Sullivan. How he knew eluded me.Clint appears in a beard, hat and
designer long coat. He escapes a fracas in a flash, because under the coat
he wore a policeman's uniform and a cop's cap.Try it. D.C. becomes DC
comics.</P>
<P>One more item among many. Kate is now in danger. "Good news," Harris tells
Eastwood on the phone "the Secret Service is taking over surveillance."
It's  like saying"Great, the foxes will protect the chickens." How much
better did Alfred Hitchcock's "The 39 Steps" manage when the hero tells his
new host in Scotland that the archvillain is unknown but has a finger
missing. "Like this?" says the host, showing his hand.</P>
<P>No character is dimensional, nothing is thoughtful or thought through or
cerebral. The  "exposes" of the Washington establishment are nullified by
caricature. In spite of occasional good moments, the film is merely a
tabloid, the screen equivalent of the National Enquirer.
