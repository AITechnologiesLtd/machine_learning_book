<P>     I'll be honest with you:  the last thing I was expecting from the
Paramount-distributed TREKKIES was a warts-n-all documentary about "Star
Trek" fandom.  Paramount, after all, was the corporate homeworld of the
United Federation of Planets; how critical a look could the studio
_really_ take at those who so proudly wore the milk moustaches from its
most lucrative cash cow?  Roger Nygard's TREKKIES, however, is about as
far from an officially endorsed whitewash as one could imagine.  In fact,
though its character studies are at times undeniably amusing, it's almost
too focused on turning its subjects into the oddballs everyone already
suspects Trekkies of being.</P>
<P>     Narrated by actress Denise Crosby (who portrayed Tasha Yar on the
syndicated "Star Trek: The Next Generation"), TREKKIES is essentially a
loosely assembled collection of cast member anecdotes and portraits of the
hardest of hard-core fans.  Among the individuals profiled is Barbara
Adams, a Little Rock, Arkansas bookbinder and "Commander" of a local fan
organization who gained national attention when she served as a Whitewater
trial juror in her full Starfleet uniform.  Another tour guide is
14-year-old Gabriel Koerner from Bakersfield, California, who leads
viewers through a typical "Star Trek" convention -- one of 28 he has
attended -- complete with merchandise tables, auctions and guest
appearances by cast members past and present.</P>
<P>     The bad news for many "Trek" fans expecting a sympathetic portrait is
that those two characters are among the more mainstream folks in the film.
TREKKIES doesn't hesitate to show us characters like the cross-dresser who
performs "Trek"-inspired folk songs, or a woman whose obsession with Brent
Spiner (the artificial life form Data on "The Next Generation") borders on
stalking, or an engineer who travels the streets of Minneapolis in an
enclosed wheelchair-like device modeled after a "Trek" prop.  When the
subject matter swerves into the pornographic fan fiction which has been
created using "Trek" characters, it no longer feels like Nygard is just
creating a comprehensive catalog of the manifestations of Trekkie-ism.
There's an element of side show exploitation to these aspects of TREKKIES,
a sense that Nygard is less interested in understanding the phenomenon of
Trekkies than in turning their eccentricities into punch lines.</P>
<P>     That's truly a shame, because the "why's" of Trekkies could have been
at least as fascinating as the "who's".  In an utterly unique way, the
universe created by Gene Roddenberry affected viewers as no other
television program has in the history of the medium.  There are moments of
insight into the way "Star Trek" changed the lives of those involved in it
forever, as in actor James Doohan's ("Scotty") emotional story about how
he helped save the life of a suicidal woman.  TREKKIES also touches on the
impact of the show's positive portrayal of multi-ethnic integration, and
on the optimism of its messages of inclusion and acceptance.  Such ideas
should have made it easier to see Trekkies as social outsiders who have
embraced a mythology in which they are tolerated, and even celebrated.
It's ironic -- and somewhat disappointing -- to watch the film turn them
into social outsiders once again.</P>
<P>     There's no denying that TREKKIES is occasionally quite funny, whether
in the answers of cast members to the strangest fan experiences they have
had, or in the ways various Trekkies have integrated their love of "Trek"
into their lives (like dentist Dennis Bourguignon's "Starbase Dental"
office). It was only after I left the theater that I realized I had been
laughing at these people more than I was laughing with them.  Yes, there
are comments about how intelligent most "Star Trek" fans are; it's too bad
they feel like token gestures.  Many Trekkies themselves seem to have
embraced the film, but I'm not sure they should appreciate the way they
are turned into exactly what the broader population generally thinks of
them.  There's not enough balance between the unusual things these people
do and the love that inspires them to do those things.  It was brave of
Paramount to endorse a film like TREKKIES.  It also seems like a bit of a
betrayal.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Trek meets:  5.</PRE>
