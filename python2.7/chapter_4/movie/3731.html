<PRE>                                BATMAN FOREVER
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Batman's reins have been turned over from director Tim Burton (now
producing) to Joel Schumacher, from lead Michael Keaton to Val Kilmer, and
from an old, baroque Gotham to a heavily stylized, kiddie-pop city.</P>
<P>     A lot can be said for the idea that the setting of a picture
thoroughly controls its tone.  What we have in BATMAN FOREVER is an
attempt to make Gotham more like Los Angeles, full of neon, black lights,
and people sporting primary-color wigs.  Unfortunately, something has been
lost in translation.</P>
<P>     What we lose is the idea of Batman as The Dark Knight.  Instead, he
spends a large bit of celluloid pontificating about the morality of
killing people, telling us like a public service announcement that it
won't make things better.  Okay, I buy that, but why is Batman telling me
this?  Batman is supposed to be a kick-ass-and-take-names type of guy, not
some lousy pacifist.  I don't need to got to the movies for that.  The
message is entirely out of place.  Also lost is a *real*
villain ... instead, we get Jim Carrey's over-the-top interpretation of The
Riddler, who was always a wuss on the TV show, and Tommy Lee Jones's
Harvey Two-Face, who I don't think I've even heard of.</P>
<P>     On the subject of villains, Carrey plays Carrey--what more can you
say?  He's hilarious, obviously made for the role, but the part isn't
written well enough to carry the picture alone.  Jones is downright awful
as Two-Face, mumbling his lines in every scene and trying desperately to
live up to the actors with much better parts who refuse to give him even a
little piece of the show.</P>
<P>     At any rate, here's what the new Batman brings to the table.  First
and foremost is Chris O'Donnell as Bruce Wayne's young ward, Dick Grayson,
a.k.a. Robin.  O'Donnell saves the film more often than he saves Batman,
proving what a spectacular actor he is, even with a bare-bones role.  Also
good is Nicole Kidman as Batman's love interest, Dr. Chase Meridian, who
ends up psychoanalyzing him out of his costume.  It's too bad the love
story wasn't written very well.</P>
<P>     And that's not all that's poorly written.  The plot has enough holes
to drive the Batmobile, the Batplane, *and* the Batboat through. 
Everything is homage to the first two films:  the obligatory car chase,
workmanlike fight scenes, people discovering Batman's true
identity ... yawn.  When you see the film, try to guess what will happen
next:  you'll be right.</P>
<P>     Overall, there's very little originality on the screen ... not that
you could see it, thanks to a nonexistent first act, some dismal
photography (Stephen Goldblatt, out of his element), even worse editing
(Dennis Virkler, surprising considering his two Oscar nominations), and
some dull, unrealistic digital effects.</P>
<P>     Thank God for the self-deprecating humor in the film, with Batman and
Robin poking fun at their small screen past.  If you watched the series at
all, the jokes make the movie worthwhile.  Kilmer is good, as usual, as
the man behind the mask, and there are a few good action sequences.  If
you see the film, try to ignore the preaching, pinch yourself awake after
the first half hour, and pray that Tim Burton makes a really good movie
next to make up for this one.</P>
