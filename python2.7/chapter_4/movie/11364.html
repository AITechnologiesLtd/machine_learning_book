<P>
David Lynch's second best film to date is perfect evidence of what
makes him fascinating as a filmmaker; he has always since day one made
the types of films you normally have to earn the right to
make. Filmmakers in the Americain system, capable of comandeering
substantial resources(financial, human, technical etc..)  in support
of their projects have usually had to go through some sort of rite of
passage after which the reigns on creativity are considerably
loosened. John Woo had to wait two films (ignoring the more sinister
implications...). There is no louder testimonial to this fact,
regarding Lynch's cinema, than his first (and best) film,
Eraserhead. Lost Highway is just as brilliant although we are clearly
in different territory at this point.</P>
<P>Generally speaking, Lost Highway is either about a couple's
experiences with a bizarre mental illness or an interconnected telling
of two distinct tales within which certain characters intertwine. It
could also be both. This is not to suggest that a single reading
exists and that it is difficult to decipher; the whole point is that
the film is any and all of these. In effect Lynch has negotiated an
unprecedented relartionship with the spectator of total and complete
complicity as far as reception and meaning-generation are concerned.</P>
<P>A variety of sources (Cahiers, Film Comment, Cineaste etc..) have
commented on the various structures that establish this
relationship. All in some way or another are linked to Lost Highway's
narrative technique. Structurally, Lynch's conception transcends more
conventional circular narratives in that it is ultimately a loop that
invites the viewer to join in at a given point and follow through
until he has reached this origin. It has been suggested that the
film's indeal exhibition of the film would be a continuous loop of the
film. The fact of the matter is that just as form came front iand
center in Greenaway's The Pillow Book, Lynch here buries his story, as
intriguing as it may be, under the two real creative thrusts of the
film: narrative technique itself and the production design. Both are
decidedly eerie...</P>
<P>The collapsing of space between filmmaker and spectator brings with it
such a degree of subjectivity in the viewer that many have ended up
terrified. This terror usually ends up being expressed as anger,
frustration or accusations of self-indulgence on Lynch's
part. Paradoxically. nothing could be further from the truth, in that,
it as an act of heroic bravery, given today's viewing climate in
Ameica to put forward a film that puts so much faith in them.</P>
