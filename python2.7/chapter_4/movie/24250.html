<P>DreamWorks has struck gold with their first animated feature, "The Prince of
Egypt". It's a completely unexpected triumph that will undoubtedly open new
doors and new possibilities in animation. A daring, breathtaking, dramatic
and powerful musical masterpiece and an artful, mature alternative to
Disney. An emotional and visually stunning tour de force that lifts the art
of animation to new hights. This could be the greatest animated feature ever
created. Although it is still magical and entertaining (without being
ashamed of it), it has a premise that is more interesting and serious that
we're used to. It's an artful alternative to Disney's various mermaids,
lions, beauties and beasts. It is simply a more sophisticated subject.</P>
<P>The film opens with a pray, a cry for freedom. The giant Sphinx standing
amidst the vast, dreamy landscape and the sea of Hebrew slaves working under
the burning sun. Egyptian soldiers with swords, bloodied with children's
blood are roaming the Jewish settlement. Amidst this blood, cry and madness,
a Hebrew mother, places her infant son in a basket and sets him adrift on
the Nile River. The burning houses and screams of terror slowly fade away as
the basket disappears in the river. After a perilous journey, the basket
floats near the royal palace, where it is spotted by the Queen. As she
approaches the basket with her young son nearby, she marvels at the
beautiful infant boy inside. She names the baby Moses and adopts him as her
own...</P>
<P>This is an emotional adaptation of the Exodus, resembling a stimulating
drama, rather than a kiddy cartoon. Every effort is made to stress that
Moses is a major figure in the Old and New Testaments and the Koran. It
tells the story of the Hebrew slave Moses, that became one of the greatest
profets of our time. Raised with a rambunctious adopted brother Rameses
(Ralph Fiennes), Moses (Val Kilmer) lives and content life, among the
Egyptian royalty. As teens the young princes are full of vinegar, charging
at breakneck speeds in their chariots, while all around them the Hebrew
slaves do endless toil under the ruthless Pharaoh Seti (Patric Stewart).
Raised to believe they're brothers, they continue to have a strong
connection even after God's will sets them on a collision course. With time
Moses starts to discover the dark side to this paradise. Rameses is
appointed regent and honors Moses with a Jewish slave as a concubine -- a
wild beauty named Tzipporah (Michelle Pfeiffer ). That night as Moses
returns to his room, he discovers that Tzipporah has escaped. Intrigued by
the rebellious girl, he follows her through the Hebrew settlement of Goshen
where he comes upon his true siblings, Miriam (Sandra Bullock) and Aaron
(Jeff Coldblum ). Believing that Moses has returned to help them, Miriam
reveals to Moses the truth about his identity, that he is the son of a
Hebrew slave. Shocked and dismayed, Moses refuses to believe her and flees
back to the palace. That night he has a nightmare about the slaughter of the
newborn Hebrews many years ago. Confused, shocked and angry, he realizes
that his entire life has been a lie. Fleeing to the desert to sort out his
feelings about his true identity, Moses ends up in Midiante, a peaceful
village surrounded by majestic mountains. Here, away from the glamour and
his past existence, he finds another life. A life of peace and harmony. Here
he encounters Tzipporah and her family. Jethro, Tzipporah's father (Danny
Glover) and the High Priest of Midian, welcomes him into their tribe. As the
years pass, Moses and Tzipporah fall in love and build a contented life as
humble shepherds. One day as Moses goes in search of a wayward sheep, he
comes across an unearthly sight -- a burning bush that is not consumed by
the flames. To Moses' amazement, he hears the voice of God (also Val
Kilmer ), revealing his destiny and calling upon him to return to Egypt and
free the Hebrew people. Filled with doubt and fear, but ready to obey his
God, Moses returns to his past home, where he discovers that with the
passing of years the Pharaoh Seti has died and Rameses has become Pharaoh.
This means that he'll have to fight against his former sibling in his quest
to free his people..</P>
<P>This is hugely impressive. If DreamWorks can maintain such high standards,
Disney can say goodbye to its virtual monopoly on high-quality cartoon
features. It is no longer just kiddy animation films, where unwilling
parents has to be dragged along. It is simply another expression. This is no
longer a cartoon, but a work of art. The filmmakers have departed from the
animation formula that's practically been carved on stone tablets by Disney,
removing the kiddy elements, but keeping the same grandiose theatrical
musical style as those Disney epics that have made their way to Broadway.
Disney would never have undertaken such tricky and risky ride. This is not a
fairy tale. It is a story that has its roots in Jewish, Christian and
Islamic religion and believes. The result is nothing less than astounding.
It overshadows De Mille's classic "The Ten Commandments" with its emotions,
unusual depth and power and some of the spectacular action scenes and
chariot races, with its flurry of wheels, horses and rickety wood, almost
leaves "Ben Hur" in its dust. "The Prince of Egypt" has several scenes of
violence, including the scenes of Egyptian cruelty, that although are not
gory or extreme, might seem a bit too realistic for small children. The
directors have concentrated on the character of Moses and recreated him as a
person, not a hero. The thing I liked mostly about the premise of "Prince of
Egypt" is its three dimensionality. Nothing is black and white. There are no
good guys, bad guys or amusing clowns. It is a personal, penetrating drama,
portraying the struggle of Moses with his adopted Egyptian royal family.
Starting with a playful chariot race between Moses and Rameses and ending
with their conflict at the Red Sea, the film depicts once-loving brothers at
odds.</P>
<P>When it comes to animation, there are not enough words to describe the
splendor and complexion of these artists' work. "The Prince of Egypt" is
probably the most beautiful animated film ever made. It stuns the viewer
with its grandness, beauty and power. Drama is written over the entire film.
The grandness and majesty of the ancient Egypt is brought to life like never
before: giant statuary, pyramids and temples adorned with intricate,
colorful hieroglyphics. This kind of visuals are completely impossible to
create on set, in live-action films. The filmmakers seamlessly combine
painting and computer graphics, filling the screen with dense, richly
layered animation. In one particularly inventive dream sequence, even the
hieroglyphics come to life. God was heavily into special effects - when
Moses returns to free his people, he brings along a rod that turns into a
snake, that turns the Nile into blood, brings on all manner of plagues and
pestilence, and, for the big finish, parts the Red Sea. The lustrous colors
and loving care given to the faces are especially noteworthy. The
traditional animation ratio of forehead to eyes, nose and mouth has been
altered slightly to give the characters more room for subtle physical
communication. The change allows Moses to deliver a number of smoldering
glances that are pretty expressive for a 2D man. The music is also
incredible. Hans Zimmer's grand, emotional musical score echoing in the
background, and several wonderful songs (including the philosophical croon
"Through Heaven's Eyes" and the magnificent "When You Believe", preformed by
Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey), create an atmosphere that is
indescribable and is to see nowhere else.</P>
<P>"The Prince of Egypt" breaks away from the ancient traditions of animation,
by exploring new territories. It is a fabulous and magical refreshment from
Disney's cliché-ridden cartoons. This film raises several philosophical
questions, that De Mille never touched. It tells the story of a man that was
the only one that could speak directly to God and become his messenger -- an
honor he didn't ask for and didn't want. To be the chosen one doesn't have
to be a blessing. "The Prince of Egypt" is a celebration of the human
spirit, retelling the undying story of a man that caused a miraculous
victory that would lay a foundation for the birth of a new nation. And yet
it is a personal tragedy -- a life broken by destiny. Moses' life is forever
changed. He had to see hundreds of innocent children die and his own brother
parish. It is a beautiful and dramatic tale about finding yourself, about
life, fate and destiny.</P>
