<P>     LATCHO DROM, which means "safe journey", has no cast and no
dialogue.  This film, which tells of the migration of the Gypsies
across Europe and Asia, presents its story through song and dance.  It
is an unusual--and ultimately effective--way to tell the tale of an
often-neglected people.</P>
<P>     Through the centuries, few groups of people have been as
persecuted as the Gypsies.  Hitler went after them as assiduously as he
did the Jews.  Nicolae Ceausescu terrorized them in Romania.
Christians castigated them as pagans.  Wherever they have traveled,
bigotry and hatred have awaited.  Yet it is rare to find documentation
of their travails.  They have become a forgotten footnote in history
books.</P>
<P>     LATCHO DROM uses Gypsy musicians from seven countries (India,
Egypt, Turkey, Romania, Hungary, France, and Spain) to get across its
many-faceted message.  With song and dance, they tell of their long
journeys, the anger directed at their people, and their own indomitable
will.  The carefully-constructed picture of the Gypsies could not be
clearer, and the brushwork is accomplished without spoken words.</P>
<P>     Director Tony Gatlif uses images to reinforce the power of his
aural message.  The most memorable of these occurs when a concentration
camp survivor is singing a mournful dirge about Auschwitz.  We see
lonely footsteps in the snow, and the impression is as chilling as the
weather.</P>
<P>     Much of LATCHO DROM is upbeat, however, concentrating on the Gypsy
zest for life.  Many of the songs are designed to be accompanied by
clapping, and the dancers move their hips in a manner that is
suggestive and sensual.  One scene illustrates the healing power of
song as an impromptu performance by a band of roving Gypsies teases a
smile from a young woman on the verge of tears.</P>
<P>     The most impressive quality of LATCHO DROM is how much history it
manages to convey using such an unorthodox manner of story-telling.
The film is a sensory banquet of colorful costumes, lively dancers, and
emotional songs.  There are limits to what can be accomplished
exclusively with music and camerawork, however.  Coupled with a slow
(and, at times, almost-somnolent) pace, this occasionally makes the
movie's greatest asset its most noticeable weakness.</P>
<P>     On balance, though, those in the picture's small target audience
are likely to find LATCHO DROM both appealing and engaging.  It is
undeniably different.</P>
