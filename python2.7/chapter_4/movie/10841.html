<P>     I suppose you could call OSCAR AND LUCINDA perfectly successful to
this extent:  I was genuinely fascinated by these two characters, and
invested in seeing them happy together.  Based on the novel by Peter
Carey, it tells the story of two souls whose destinies collide in
Victorian-era Australia.  Oscar Hopkins (Ralph Finnes) is a reclusive,
penniless divinity student; Lucinda Leplastrier (Cate Blanchett) is a
high-spirited heiress who invests in a glassworks factory.  Though their
backgrounds are in some ways completely opposite, they share one important
hobby in common:  both are compulsive gamblers.  Each finds that wagering
provides a daring sense of release which nothing else in their proscribed
lives can provide, leading to an instant connection when they meet on
board a ship to Australia.</P>
<P>     The respective performances of Fiennes and Blanchett are certainly
impressive -- Fiennes the timid holy man with toussled hair and stammering
speech, Blanchett the "proud square peg" in a world of round holes.  When
the come together, however, the chemistry is nothing short of
intoxicating.  The scenes in which they meet to share furtive games of
cards take on the feel of illicit sexual encounters, eyes wild with a
sense of abandon and discovery.  No screen pairing of the year offered
more promise for fascinating interaction.</P>
<P>     What an absolute pity that the narrative divides Oscar and Lucinda
almost as soon as they are united.  Convinced that Lucinda carries a torch
for a missionary minister (Ciaran Hinds), Oscar sets off on a fool's
errand to prove his devotion to Lucinda, leading an overground party to
bring a pre-fabricated glass church to a remote location in the Outback.
His increasingly feverish quest provides opportunities for some
spectacular shots by cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson, including lingering
views of the glass church floating down a river on a barge.  It's just
terribly frustrating knowing that these two characters are hanging around
in the same movie, but not in the same scenes.  An interest in the fate of
their relationship may keep you watching, but it will also keep you
fidgeting.  On the page, I can see this story being an engrossing,
heart-breaking page-turner.  On the screen, with two great performances
giving a spark to the rare moments these characters are together, OSCAR
AND LUCINDA becomes a beautifully filmed and splendidly acted tease.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 riverboat gambles:  7.</PRE>
