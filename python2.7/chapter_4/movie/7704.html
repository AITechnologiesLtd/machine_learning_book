<PRE>                                  KAMA SUTRA
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Although the plot (commoner and princess vie for the affection of a
king) comes straight from a Harlequin romance, this Indian film is so
rich with sensuality and lush richness that it is a joy to behold.</P>
<P>Directed by Mira Nair (<I>Salaam Bombay!, Mississippi Masala<I>), the
tale follows two young girls Maya (Indira Varma) and Princess Tara
(Sarita Choudhury) as they mature in the ways of sex and politics. Tara
marries Raj Singh (Naveen Andrews) but not before Maya seduces him the
night before.</P>
<P>On her wedding day, Maya tells her "All my life I have lived with your
used things. Now something I have used is your forever." Tara is not too
happy with this turn of events and Maya is banished from the village.</P>
<P>Wandering through 16th century India, she comes upon royal sculptor who
turns her on to a Kama Sutra class. This prepares her for her new
occupation as courtesan to the same king that her childhood friend
married.</P>
<P>The story isn't much, but the costumes and sets are grand. The real star
of the film is the erotic love-making. The scenes are hot without being
explicit, sweaty without being offensive and certainly qualify as some
of the best filmed sex scenes to hit the cinema. See it and take a close
personal friend.</P>
