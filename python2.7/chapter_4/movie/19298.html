<PRE>Repoman: starring emilio estevez, Harry Dean Stanton etc. 
                Dir: Alex Cox</PRE>
<PRE>****-out of four stars.  92 minutes.</PRE>
<P>More and more movies today are being made using a formula.  There are many of
these formulas.  For example, Something bad happens and the hero must save the
girl, that is one of hollywood's standard formulas for movies.  However, a
while ago (1984), a movie was made that broke all formulas.  The movie was
Repoman.  This movie is the kind of movie that hollywood doesn't understand, it
follows no known formula making it one of the most original and exciting movies
to be made in the recent years of movies.  </P>
<P>The movie centers around a young man who is unknowingly sucked into the life of
a repossesor, the life of a repoman is a strange one indeed.  I'm not going to
give away any of the plot, but I will say that the movie does go on to include
aliens, flying cars, a bum that seems to know everything,  a rival group of
repoman, some drug addicted punks and some very odd scientists later on.</P>
<P>If you ever get sick of watching movies that seem to be just like other movies,
I reccomend to go out and rent a copy of Repoman, I cannot gurantee that you
will like it, but if you can appreciate low budget genius movies of this sort,
than you may get a kick out of it.  At least rent it to throw some variety into
your movie life.
If you've read this far, thankyou for your time, I appreciate your patience in
hearing what I have to say.</P>
