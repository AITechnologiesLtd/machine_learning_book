<P>The journey from TV to movie stardom has not been smooth for Matthew
Perry. As the wisecracking Chandler Bing on "Friends," Perry comes off
as the smartest and most edgy of the ensemble cast. But in his previous
big screen starring efforts ("Fools Rush In," "Three To Tango" and the
dreadful "Almost Heroes"), Perry's charisma dissipated on celluloid.
Although playing variations of his television persona, he seemed oddly
bleached out – effete and bland, almost wispy.</P>
<P>In "The Whole Nine Yards," Perry finally appears to have found his
cinematic footing. As dentist, bedraggled husband and put upon good guy
Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky, he displays a sense of backbone – tenuous at
first, but stronger as the film goes on – that gives his one-liners and
pratfalls more oomph.</P>
<P>Of course, it helps that Oz is one of only two decent human beings in
this dark comedy. Surrounded by amiable hitmen who whack their own
friends as casually as one would swat a fly, he provides a welcome moral
center that makes the overwhelming nihilism of the story tolerable. As
in the classic "Arsenic and Old Lace," lovable killers can be a lot of
fun, provided you have at least one character that fully recognizes that
what they are doing is wrong.</P>
<P>Indeed, Oz spends most of the movie surrounded by people doing wrong.
While enduring the constant disdain of his dour bride, Sophie (Patricia
Arquette), he recognizes his new neighbor as Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski
(Bruce Willis), a contract killer recently sprung from prison after
ratting out his former gangland employers. Refusing the witness
protection program despite the fact that there is a price on his head,
Tudeski maintains an assured, cheerful attitude while sharing his
peculiar outlook on life to Oz. "It's not important how many people I've
killed," he explains pleasantly, "What's important is how I get along
with the people that are still alive."</P>
<P>I won't recount the elaborate plotting of Mitchell Kapner's screenplay.
Suffice to say that Oz, badgered by his wife into making a very bad
decision, quickly finds himself up to his ears in trouble, with any
number of people out to kill him. Questionable allegiances, along with
double and triple crossings, make up the bulk of "The Whole Nine Yards,"
providing a surprising amount of snappy entertainment. While humor
periodically takes a backseat to the mechanics of the elaborate farce,
the production never loses steam.</P>
<P>Savvy casting is key to the success of the film. Bruce Willis hits the
right notes as Tudeski, blending a congenial nature with a strong sense
of menace. Willis works beautifully with Perry, building an affectionate
relationship with his new neighbor, while making it clear that he'll
kill him in a heartbeat if need be. Michael Clarke Duncan, fresh from
his breakout role as the gentle giant in "The Green Mile," is wonderful
as a suave Chicago hitman, and Amanda Peet steals the show as Jill, a
perky dental assistant with unusual career aspirations.</P>
<P>Other performers fare less well, mostly because of accents. Kevin
Pollack, playing a gangland boss, affects a weird speech impediment that
wears thin fast and Patricia Arquette, as the unrelenting harridan, uses
a French accent that wouldn't pass muster in a high school play.</P>
<P>Director Jonathan Lynn does hit and miss work here. While he handles his
lead actors with skill, he has problems behind the camera. To his
credit, he moved the story setting from Miami to Montreal, choosing not
to do the usual "Hey, we're filming in Canada to save money, but lets
pretend it's a U.S. city" nonsense. But man, does he make Montreal look
industrial and dreary. Lynn also overuses close-ups and awkward camera
angles. Luckily, Randy Edelman's jazzy score makes the technical
glitches easier to take.</P>
<P>In a winter that has offered a numbing string of lousy movies, "The
Whole Nine Yards" is a zippy, nasty little change of pace. And for
Matthew Perry, it offers evidence that there may be life beyond
"Friends" after all.</P>
