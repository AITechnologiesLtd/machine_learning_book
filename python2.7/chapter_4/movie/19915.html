<PRE>TEACHING MRS. TINGLE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Will they kill her, or won't they?  Is she dead, or isn't she?  These
are some of the stock horror movie questions that writer and director
Kevin Williamson, the writer of the SCREAM series, poses in the black
comedy KILLING MRS. TINGLE.  Oops, I mean TEACHING MRS. TINGLE.  The
original title about the killing of a teacher by her high school
students didn't seem like a wise marketing choice after the real-life
Colorado tragedy.</P>
<P>Tamed down to the PG-13 level, the predictable movie pulls its punches
whenever possible.  Just when a horrible deed is about to be done, for
example, the perpetrators observe the intended victim's spouse reading
the bible.  This bit of piety causes reflection and possibly a change in
course.</P>
<P>Managing to shine in the mediocre movie, Helen Mirren ("Prime Suspect"),
as Mrs. Tingle, delivers one of those hard-edged performances that she
can do so well.  Although her characters usually have sympathetic sides,
Mrs. Tingle, as her students and fellow teachers agree, is a classic
bitch.</P>
<P>Walking down the school hall in her proper, tight-fitting black suit,
Mrs. Tingle parts students like Moses did with the Red Sea.  Even the
principal is scared stiff of her.  With perky confidence, she wishes him
a happy birthday, "happy AA birthday" that is.  He had a drinking
problem that she will forever use against him.  In fact she loves
nothing better than playing mind games with everyone, especially her
students.</P>
<P>Full of sarcasm, she loves putting students in their place by reminding
them how unsuccessful their parents were.  "He too had the words 'no
future' painted on his forehead," she tells Luke Churner (Barry Watson)
about his father, whom she had taught.</P>
<P>She enjoys letting her students perform and make fools of themselves in
class so that she can ridicule them.  "Ask not what your mistress can do
for you, but what your mistress can do for the country," a would-be
starlet named Jo Lynn (Marisa Coughlan) does in a bad Marilyn Monroe
routine.  Needless to say, Mrs. Tingle annihilates her.</P>
<P>Straight-arrow honor student Leigh Ann Watson (Katie Holmes) is one
point shy of beating out a rich kid for class valedictorian.  Unless she
can be top in her class, Leigh Ann will not be able to get the
scholarship she needs to go to college.  And unless she aces Mrs.
Tingle's class, she has no hope of being anything other than second
best.</P>
<P>When Leigh Ann accidentally ends up with a copy of Mrs. Tingle's
upcoming test and is discovered, Mrs. Tingle vows to wreck the girl's
academic record.  Through a series of misadventures, three teens --
Leigh Ann, Luke and Jo Lynn -- end up holding Mrs. Tingle hostage in her
own home.  Tied to her bed, she begins to play mind games with the
three, whose collective IQs seem to be vastly inferior to hers.</P>
<P>Mirren acts circles around the younger actors, who appear as confused
and disoriented as their characters.  The movie needs better-matched
opponents as well as sharper writing and less obvious directing.  When
Jo Lynn, who thinks she's Hollywood bound, tries to pull the wool over
Mrs. Tingle's eyes with a dramatic sob routine, Mrs. Tingle just glares
at her.  "My poor dear, I hope you're a good waitress" is all she
responds.</P>
<P>The teens throw childish temper tantrums.  "Bored, bored, bored, I can't
believe you don't have TV," Jo Lynn complains while holding Mrs. Tingle
hostage.  "It's like not having toilet paper."</P>
<P>So does TEACHING MRS. TINGLE contain any surprises?  Maybe one.  The
weapon of choice is not a gun but a medieval crossbow.  There, I've done
it.  I just told you the only unexpected thing in the entire movie.
Now, you have no reason at all to see it.  Enjoy the time I just saved
you.</P>
<P>TEACHING MRS. TINGLE runs about 1:30.  It is rated PG-13 for thematic
content, violence, sexuality, language and some teen drinking and would
be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
