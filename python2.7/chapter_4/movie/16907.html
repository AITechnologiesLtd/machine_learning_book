<P>The Other Sister (1999) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Juliette Lewis, Giovanni
Ribisi, Diane Keaton and Tom Skerritt.</P>
<P> Sometimes you can tell a film has problems merely by reading its credits.</P>
<P> Four writers are credited with the story for The Other Sister, two of whom
went on to write the screenplay. And if ever there was a clear example of
that cliché about too many cooks ... this is it.</P>
<P> For The Other Sister lacks a definitive focus. It spreads itself too thin
trying to cover too many points. It is a movie that feels more cobbled
together by committee than written.</P>
<P> And what exactly is The Other Sister? A love story? A dramatic
mother-daughter character study? A two-hour promo showcasing the abilities
of the mentally challenged coping and functioning without being a burden on
society?</P>
<P> I do not mean to sound insensitive, but at times The Other Sister seems to
be all of the above. It also has a disturbing underlying aura of
patronization and condescension.</P>
<P> The Other Sister is the story of Carla Tate, a slightly retarded young
woman recently returned home from many years at a "special school."
Carla (Juliette Lewis) yearns for freedom. She wants to prove to her family
- and especially her mother - that she can take care of herself.</P>
<P> Her mother, Elizabeth (Diane Keaton), is an overprotective control freak
who tries to manage Carla's every waking second.</P>
<P> Carla rebels, and she is reluctantly allowed to enroll at the local
community college and eventually get her own apartment. She also meets
Danny (Giovanni Ribisi), a mentally challenged young man, and the two fall
in love.</P>
<P> Any student of movies can guess the rest, and despite the quartet of
writers, the plot doesn't really deviate from the path you expect.</P>
<P> What keeps The Other Sister from being unbearable is the stellar
performance by Lewis. A gifted young actress who is best known for playing
troubled teens (Cape Fear, Natural Born Killers), she shows zest and heart.</P>
<P> Lewis creates a whole woman out of what could have been a one-dimensional
stereotypical character. She is capable, yet vulnerable, sweet, yet steely,
childlike and calculating.</P>
<P> In other words, she is a typical young woman.</P>
<P> Ribisi holds his own as the young man who wants to make a life with Carla.
He brings a warmth and maturity to his Danny. Despite his disability, you
feel confident he can and will succeed.</P>
<P> Tom Skerritt is wise and loving as Carla's father. He overcomes the
cliched aspects of his character to breathe life into a man who sees that
to hold onto his daughter he must let her go.</P>
<P> Which brings us to Keaton. Her Elizabeth, unfortunately, throws the movie
a-kilter. Basically, she is a one-note, grating, mother from hell. She
talks sweetly and professes to love her daughter. And while we don't doubt
her sincerity and concern for Carla's well-being, she comes off as
condescending and a bit duplicitous. She feels that the only way Carla can
be safe and protected is if she listens to mother.</P>
<P> And while The Other Sister can be described as a bittersweet romantic
comedy, Keaton's performance almost pushes it over into melodrama.</P>
<P> Director Garry Marshall, who also is one of the four writers as well as
one of the screenwriters, could have done some trimming on the running
time. At nearly two hours, The Other Sister moves at an uneven pace. There
are a few dead spots, too many scenic views of San Francisco.</P>
<P> The Other Sister is a flawed film, made palatable by the performances of
Lewis, Ribisi and Skerritt, but a more focused screenplay could have raised
it higher.</P>
