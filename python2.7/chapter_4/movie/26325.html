MAVERICK (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Last year's WILD WILD WEST is something unforgivable and
unjustifiable, but at least in the beginning it might have
looked like a good idea. Five years before, another 1950s
western TV series got itself revamped into rather successful
summer blockbuster. This film was MAVERICK, 1994 western
comedy directed by Richard Donner.</P>
<P>The protagonist of this film is Bret Maverick (played by Mel
Gibson), gambler who is both skillful with cards and guns.
He nevertheless prefers coning than shooting people, and
such abilities will be needed when he decides to join great
poker game which is held on Mississippi riverboat. But to
enter this game he must pay large entering fee, so he must
either collect all debts or find some ingenious ways to
depart people from their money. In doing so, he would cross
paths with Anabella Cranston (played by Jodie Foster),
southern belle whose beauty is not spoiled by bad Southern
accent or lack of scruples. While two of them join forces
and travel to the boat, they are pursued by lawman and
Maverick's old acquintance Zane Cooper (played by James
Garner). All that would lead to whole series of adventures
and encounters with various bizarre characters of the Old
West.</P>
<P>Scriptwriter William Goldman probably envisioned MAVERICK
and western version of STING - story which represents
complex set of intrigues, twist and characters who
constantly try to fool each other. However, his efforts
failed for one simple reason - plot aroused very little
interest in director Richard Donner, who instead envisioned
film as series of elaborate and mostly humorous action
scenes. Sometimes those scenes don't have much connection
with the rest of film, in some segments they are slow and
tendency to have as much cameo appearances as possible makes
this film too long. But film is nevertheless saved by
enthusiastic performances of Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster,
two actors who obviously enjoy playing light-hearted
characters for change. James Garner, who played Maverick in
the original series, is very good in the role of Cooper,
while Graham Greene is hillarious as Indian chief. All in
all, despite the lack of plot and excessive length, there is
enough humour for the audience to enjoy MAVERICK as
unpretencious entertainment. Western fans would be
additionally satisfied because MAVERICK with its light
spirit is rather refreshing addition to the rejuvenated
genre, represented with dark, depressive and revisionist
films of the early 1990s.</P>
