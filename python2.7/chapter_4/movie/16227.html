<P>As vampire films go, this is nothing new, and it lacks the styling that have
made the genre famous in the movies the past 20 years. But as a new style,
this is a different film, more like watching the old Bela Lugosi classic
than anything else.</P>
<P>The thing which makes it comparable to that early standard, is its tonality,
and near black and white filming, which adds an eery intent to the who
thing, in serious playing around with shadows, and movements, something that
we take for granted nowadays in any kind of film, and even consider boring
by most standards.</P>
<P>Nadja, like the original it seems to copy, is slow, and the accent is on the
movement and the acting of each particular person, rather than the vampire
story film, where we know that the vampire has to be done away with.</P>
<P>But unlike the religious doodaas that usually permeate those films, this one
does not touch that area, and instead concentrates on the relationships that
Nadja has, and can, or can not maintain, and her desire to control her
urges, so she can have a longer relationship.</P>
<P>I suppose that the best thing in this film is the directing and the shooting
style.... you would be surprised how a well  designed pose, makes the
actor/actress look better and stronger. But all in all, this is not a very
strong film, though it has that quality that reminds me of the style that
used to be around the Warhols and such.</P>
<P>The film is a bit on the nightmarish's/trippy/weird side, but this is its
strength.  It makes sure that nothing is like
any other vampire film.  It spends time with its main character and her
feelings, towards someone, or in general. And if forces us to come to like
this person, whose need is different than others.</P>
<P>In the midst of all this is a crazy looking and acting Van Helsing, the
ultimate commentary on the heroic stance that has been the trademark for
that character. In this case he is almost satirical and a lunatic. The film
does not glorify him, and makes him  look crazy and off the wall, as someone
that has little respect for relationships, specially those that last into
other ages, and generations.  All of a sudden, this doctor is no different
a vampire than those he wants to destroy... he is on a mission that recalls
the same urges as the vampires he chases.  While this is not exactly new,
Peter Fonda's drugged out style stands out, as either out of place, or a
very clever move by the directing and writing crews.</P>
<P>Not a great film, but one that might be interesting for those that enjoy
vampire films... no morals here.. just a story.</P>
