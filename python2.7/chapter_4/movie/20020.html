<P>What you get when take about a dozen name-actors and slap them into a
budgeted $85 Million comic-book movie with Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush as the
bad guy, and first-time movie director of Taco Bell's infamous TV Chihuahua
ads, "Yo Quiero Taco Bell", at the helm? Mystery Men: The Movie, based on
the Dark Horse comic book is what you get. Is it any good? Well, let's find
out.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Captain Amazing, the popular superhero known to have abolished crime in
Champion City, decides to allow one of his biggest nemeses, Cassanova
Frankenstein, out of the penitentiary, because he is losing his sponsors due
to the lack of altercations left for him in the big city. Unfortunately for
him, Cassanova has plans of his own, leaving it up to several up-and-coming,
bumbling superheroes to attempt to save the day.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Mostly enjoyable and colorful comic-book hero spoof, this movie was not as
funny as I anticipated, but did offer enough original material and pretty
eye-candy for yours truly to be amused during its entire showing. I am also
a comic book collector myself, and appreciated many at the potshots taken at
the comic-book genre (Most of the funniest stuff came from this premise). I
also liked the whole concept of "disco" being integrated into the bad guys'
theme, as well as the quirky special effects and the few surprises tossed in
and around. The actors were all passable, with William H. Macy sticking out
as the cream of their crop, but I did think Ben Stiller could have been a
little funnier. Also, what's with Lena Olin taking that complete throwaway
role as Cassanova's bimbo-du-jour (I still have dreams about here in ROMEO
IS BLEEDING... :) Garofalo was darkly humorous as per usual.</P>
<P>All in all, I suppose they could have done much better with such a parody
film, especially in the humor and action department, but then again, some of
the stories that I had heard before this screening, had me expecting the
worst as well. Geoffrey Rush for one, was a definite poor casting call,
simply boring me as the bad guy. They could have gotten someone with a
little more charisma. And surely the "identities" of each of the Mystery Men
was not as inspirational as they could have been...I mean, I know it's a
parody, but the "fork-guy"? C'mon! Having said that, I think that anyone who
has ever had an interest in comic books, superheroes, or even movies based
on either, will enjoy this movie for what it is: a goofy, wink-wink,
over-the-top, special effects-laden comic-book spoof starring a whole bunch
of name-actors having a blast! Not the best movie I've seen this summer, but
definitely far from the worst. Warm your nachos, and grind right into them,
cause these are the kind of movies for which nachos were indirectly
invented.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Kinka Usher is best known for having directed those cute doggie
commercials for Taco Bell ("Yo Quiero Taco Bell?").
Actor Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo once dated for about three weeks, but
stopped after they thought that it was getting "weird". They are now really
good friends, and seem to be in every other movie together. They even wrote
a book together called "Feel This Book: An Essential Guide to
Self-Empowerment, Spiritual Supremacy, and Sexual Satisfaction".
Janeane was offered the role of Gale Weathers in the movie SCREAM (8/10),
but turned it down to do a movie called SWEETHEARTS. Courtney Cox then got
her role and SCREAM went on to gross more than $100 million, where as
SWEETHEARTS went straight to video. Her production company is called "I Hate
Myself Productions". She stands 5'1".
One funny in-joke is contained in the line "I'm just a publicist, not a
magician!", delivered by Captain Amazing's publicist near the beginning of
the film. The actor delivering the line, Rickie Jay, is in actually, a
magician.
Greg Kinnear lived in Greece for sometime, and can actually speak Greek.
Paul Reubens (AKA Pee-Wee Herman) was born Paul Rubenfield. He was once
honorably discharged from the Marine Corps, and was arrested for
masturbating in an adult movie theatre in 1991.
Actress Lena Olin is born in Sweden, and had already made a successful
career as an actress before she came to Hollywood. Director Sydney Pollack
rewrote the scenario for his movie HAVANNA especially for her.
The "H" in William H. Macy's name stands for Hall.
Actress Louis Lasser, who plays Hank Azaria's mom in this film, was once
married to director Woody Allen for about three years in the sixties.
Fugee music star Pras plays one of the Disco Boys in this film.
Actor Wes Studi (The Sphynx) is an American Indian of the Cherokee Nation.</P>
