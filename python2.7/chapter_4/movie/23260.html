<PRE>The Big Kahuna
by Max Messier
copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>When one thinks of a Big Kahuna, Kevin Spacey suits that title just
fine.  When he walks across a room in a scene, all eyes are drawn to his
presence.  His subtle pose and commanding smile act as a strong gravity
that draws all parties' interest.  Spacey's voice carries such
conviction that the most common of situations are made deep when he
speaks of them.  He echoes the great works of Barrymore and Grant and
carries the weight of these acting giants without even a shrug of the
shoulders.</P>
<P>The new film, The Big Kahuna, marks the first venture of Spacey's new
film production company in conjunction with Andrew Stevens's new
production company, Franchise Pictures.  I wonder of Mr. Stevens, a
veteran of late-night Cinemax, thought up the title all by himself.  The
only thing missing is Shannon Tweed.  I guess her acting chops weren't
up to par for Spacey.</P>
<P>The film revolves around the interesting and dramatic world of
industrial lubricant salesman holed up in Wichita, Kansas for one night,
looking for love.  No.no.sorry about that.  Got that mixed up with an
earlier Stevens film, Point of Seduction: Body Chemistry III.  The film
is actually about the interesting and dramatic world of industrial
lubricant salesman holed up in Wichita, Kansas for one night, trying to
`nail' (pun intended) a `Big Kahuna,' a CEO of a major industrial firm
that is looking to do business with some swinging industrial lubricant
salesmen.</P>
<P>The characters in the film are the strongest elements of the piece.  The
portrayal of men at different stages of their lives is brought to life
by the solid acting of Danny DeVito, Peter Facinelli, and Kevin Spacey.
These life stages are well-crafted: the naïve innocent babe with pure
thoughts and without character, the jaded middle-aged guy still fighting
the good fight with both fists, and the reserved older man with the
painful resolutions of a life spent without reward.  The use of mirrors
and dream states of introspection add depth and quality to the plight of
each man's silent and subconscious battle for identity.</P>
<P>The biggest surprise of the film is Peter Facinelli.  The infamous Mike
Dexter from Can't Hardly Wait, one of the best teenage/John Hughesian
films in recent years.  His portrayal of a religious man who would
rather sell Jesus than industrial lubricants is heavy and well-done.
The conflicts he creates with Spacey's character are some of the best
moments of the film and really show off its impressive writing.</P>
<P>The Big Kahuna is an amazing character study and can sit proudly among
any works by Mamet, Allen, Towne, or Schrader.  Anyone that enjoys
tightly woven films revolving around the examination of man's existence
in this somewhat strange thing we call the world will find satisfaction
with this piece of cinema.</P>
