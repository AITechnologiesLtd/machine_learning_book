<PRE>                               DESPERADO
                       A film review by Jeff Inman
                        Copyright 1995 Jeff Inman</PRE>
<P>     Here's the deal with reviewers today.  They're all still ticked
off about WATERWORLD and how it didn't really turn out to be as bad as
they were hoping.  But for all those millions they wanted more.
Naturally!  Hey!  Where's my sensurround-character-development-slackjaw-
scintillating-plotline?  But, it was an okay movie.  At least the
Kostner character didn't fawn all over the babe, ya know what I'm
saying?</P>
<P>     So, now they're still mad.  They're out for blood.  And here comes
DESPERADO, made, quite obviously, by that guy who made El MARIACHI for
a measly seven thousand bucks.  Let's see if he's got The Hollywood
Disease.  Well, sure enough, all the doctors are telling you that the
patient has a bad case.  Oh, they chortled along for the beginning
part, but soon as they finished their popcorn, whaddaya know?  "This
movie has lost all its steam!" The director got caught in the "typical"
problem of action pictures.  All dressed up and nowhere to go.</P>
<PRE>     Listen up and I'll give you the straight poop on DESPERADO.</PRE>
<P>     This movie is full of the kind of life that Hollywood has been
needing for years.  Violent?  Yeah, it's violent.  So?  So, it's
violent.  Is the violence "realistic"?  Get outta my face with your
"realistic"!  No.  Not exactly.  But guns run out of ammo at
inopportune moments, and the good guy, or bad guy, whatever the hell he
is ... he kicks some butt and has a good time doing it, and I had a
good time watching.  I'll wager that real live guys don't comb back
their ponytails just 30 minutes after having knives inserted into their
shoulder muscles.  But who asked ya?  And the babe is lovely.  Or did I
say that already?  She's a winner.  I'd like to thank her, sometime.</P>
<P>     So, we got your basic plot elements: guns (we're talking twin
Ruger .45s, MAC-10s, M-16s, etc, and of course, the eminently
respectable Desert Eagle .44), gorgeous women, plenty of bad guys, and
this special new element that you weren't expecting: humor.  No
fooling.  I know you're probably imagining the typical lame Hollywood
excuse for a joke where the smoke clears and the Good Guy mouths some
ironic one-liner that you've already heard ten times.  But that ain't
it.  I better not describe it.  Trust me.  There's humor here.</P>
<P>     Is it an all-time classic like THE SEVEN SAMURAI?  No.  Okay?  It
is not a 10, like THE SEVEN SAMURAI.  But only 3 or 4 movies have ever
been made that could compare with THE SEVEN SAMURAI, so get away from
me with your little numbering system.  It isn't a 10.  Maybe 7.5.  But
I run a tough scale.  I don't go giving out 10's every day.  Not even
9's.  You ask: what about LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE?  6.5!  Ha!  So, now
you're asking, okay wise-guy, I suppose you loved TERMINATOR.  Well,
okay.  Yeah.  TERMINATOR's an 8.  We could go on like this, but if you
aren't convinced to go see DESPERADO yet, then forget it.  And if you
are convinced, then okay.  No need to argue.  They should make more
movies with this kind of quirkyness, originality, and style.</P>
