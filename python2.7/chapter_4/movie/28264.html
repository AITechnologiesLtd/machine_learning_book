<PRE>FROM DUSK TILL DAWN
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
May 25th, 2001</PRE>
<P>After Tarantino's post-"Pulp Fiction" success in 1994, his future remained 
questionable. Here was a man who reinvented and rewrote the rules of gangster 
flicks forever - in retrospect, not so new were his rules or inventions as 
much as the energy he brought to them - and the question remained if he ever 
could top his crowning "Pulp" jewel. Tarantino didn't try to prove anything 
as he largely acted in some rotten films like "Destiny Turns on the Radio" 
and his own horrendous short film in a collection of bad ones called "Four 
Rooms." It wasn't until 1997 that Tarantino showed why he was a success in 
the first place. It was not the gore or violence as much as his sharp, clever 
writing and the introduction of the gangster as an ironic antihero. "From 
Dusk Till Dawn" was an early script by Quentin from long before "Reservoir 
Dogs," and it is actually two movies rolled into one. It is a silly, jagged 
and overlong pulp carnival that at times is entertaining and funny. From 
behind the cameras is Robert Rodriguez of "Desperado" fame, and you can 
clearly see where Tarantino's movie ends and Rodriguez's begins. </P>
<P>The opening scene is reminiscent of "Natural Born Killers" with George 
Clooney and Quentin Tarantino playing two brothers, Seth and Richard Gecko, 
who rob a convenience store and murder the owner and the police officer all 
in the space of less than ten minutes of screen time. The two antiheroes are 
two bumbling thieves wearing black suits with no particular direction in life 
other than robbing convenience stores. Seth is the calm, resourceful crook 
whereas Richard is a stupid, raging psychopath. </P>
<P>After the murderous robbery, the pair take a hostage from an earlier bank 
robbery to a run-down motel. Richard disposes of the hostage, and the twosome 
end up kidnapping a grizzled preacher, Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel), and his 
two kids, the teenage Kate (Juliette Lewis) and her adopted Chinese brother, 
Scott (Ernest Liu). Seth needs them as bait to cross the border to Mexico 
where he's supposed to rendezvous with his employer. At this point, the movie 
takes on an odd route and becomes a cartoonish "Evil Dead" flick when the 
incongruous group go to a bar named the Titty Twister run by vicious, 
grotesque, constantly morphing vampires! This is where the over-the-top 
histrionics of Rodriguez begins. </P>
<P>As enjoyable as "From Dusk Till Dawn" frequently is, it is disappointing. The 
first half of the film is terrific stuff, mixing in laughs, tension and 
surprises with ease, and all superbly written by Quentin Tarantino. Once the 
movie settles in for the horror aspect, it becomes slightly repetitive and 
mindless. The movie spends an eternity showing our heroes and anti-heroes 
shoving stakes into vampires' hearts, as well as chopping off their heads and 
limbs with an arsenal that includes chairs, beer glasses, crossbows and 
crosses. There is so much vampiric carnage that Rodriguez doesn't allow much 
room for Tarantino's trademark wordplay and that is a shame. </P>
<P>There are, however, some hilarious performances and understated acting to 
compensate. There's the 70's blaxploitation star Fred Williamson as a Vietnam 
Vet; Tom Savini (former make-up artist of "Dawn of the Dead" fame) as a 
leather-jacketed punk named Sex Machine; and Cheech Marin in three roles - 
the best is as the Titty Twister host who invites all the truckers and bikers 
to join in the fun of watching the sexy strippers do their snake striptease 
dances!</P>
<P>George Clooney made a successful transition here from television's "E.R." to 
the big screen, as evidenced by some of his later work post-"Batman and 
Robin." Here he projects a calm, relaxed personality as Seth, and makes a 
convincing, charismatic action star. Surprisingly, Tarantino does his best 
work here as the psychopathic, horny Richard who has the hots for Kate, the 
preacher's daughter. Harvey Keitel brings a level of humanity and quiet 
authority as the preacher who has lost his faith since his wife died in a car 
crash. Juliette Lewis is at her most restrained here and brings a sensual, 
sweetly innocent side that makes us care for her amidst all the flying 
vampire body parts. </P>
<P>In short, "From Dusk Till Dawn" is a rollercoaster ride of thrills and laughs 
that throws in everything from bits of "Pulp Fiction" and the Indiana Jones 
series to all those grade Z zombie/vampire thrillers. The special-effects are 
enthralling yet exhausting, and Rodriguez has still not learned what balanced 
rhythm is. With some spectacularly edited sequences and better-than-average 
performances, this is junky, fast-paced filmmaking at its best. Now if only 
Tarantino would direct his own screenplays more often. </P>
