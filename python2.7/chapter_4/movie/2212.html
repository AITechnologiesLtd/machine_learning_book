<PRE>                       THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Tim Burton proves himself a creative
     genius with a film deserving of instant holiday classic
     status.  Just about everything comes together and genuinely
     works in the best holiday film since Alistair Sim starred in
     A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  Rating: +3 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>     From the on-again off-again career of Tim Burton comes a film so
original and incredibly creative that it genuinely is unlikely to be
surpassed as a holiday film for decades.  While Burton did not actually
direct in this outing (Henry Selick did), Burton produced and wrote the
story, creating the characters.  And THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS shows an
unmistakable Burton style.  The entire film is done in beautiful 3-D
animation and is the culmination of the poetic fairy tale style we saw some
of (but not enough) in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS crossed with the tongue-in-cheek
horror-spoof style of "Frankenweenie" and "Vincent."  This film dazzles the
viewer with so many beautiful images that I found just taking my eyes off
the screen to make notes meant I was missing something I wanted to see.  The
style the film kept reminding me of some exceptionally creative Czech films-
--particularly those of Jiri Trnka--and wishing more films like that could
be done elsewhere.  Now a visual style every bit as compelling, perhaps
more, has found its way into an American film.  The fairy tale style that I
liked so much in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS I attributed to Caroline Thompson, a
then first-time screenwriter whose talents I claimed were just what Burton
needed.  I am very pleased that Burton seems to have had the same insight.
Thompson wrote NIGHTMARE's screenplay also and this time she and Burton have
completely fulfilled the promise their pairing showed in that film.  The ten
musical pieces here are written and scored with the clever style and quality
of a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta.</P>
<P>     The story takes place in a land where holidays are born.  One town
makes Halloween each year, another makes Christmas.  The artistic genius of
Halloweentown is one Jack Skellington, a sort of skeleton with a globular
head.  But then everyone in Halloweentown is a horror, that is the spirit of
Halloween.  The town is full of werewolves, vampires, bats, spiders, mad
scientists, and things for which there are no names.  Jack is dissatisfied
with Halloween and stumbles on Christmastown.  He is  enchanted and puzzled
by the idea of Christmas and decides he and his town of horrors can do it
all better.  Halloweentown starts working on putting on a horror-tinged
Christmas.  If that seems a silly plot, well you don't expect a holiday film
is going to have a Dostoyevsky-level story.  Just accept the story and watch
how well it is told.  Regardless of the plot this is a film that you *will*
find rewarding.  Take it from me you may possibly have seen a film like this
before but only rarely, and you have never seen it done so well for 75
minutes.  If you thought THE WIZARD OF OZ was an impressive children's film,
go see THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  Amazingly to me I give a Christmas
film a rating of +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
