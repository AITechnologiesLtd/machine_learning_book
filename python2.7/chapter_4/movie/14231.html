<P>I should learn to be a bit more leary, and a bit less curious when it comes
to my cinematic choices.  When I was looking through the paper, to see the
movie times for Disturbing Behavior, a disturbing fact came to light.  The
running time of the movie was a paltry 84 minutes.  Barely longer than an
episode of the X-Files.  Knowing the basic plot for this movie, I was a bit
curious as to how they could develop characters, and a plot, and then give
sufficient supporting story, and an effective conclusion.  But being open
minded, and full of wonder, I proceeded ahead.        I should've heeded the signs.</P>
<P>While this is not the worst movie that I've seen this summer (Godzilla and
Armageddon are still "Kings of the Summer" in that category)..this movie does
have it's problems.  It was directed by David Nutter, heretofore, an X-Files
episode director, and the plot rings of a decent, but not totally compelling
episode of the show.  The recipe ingredients start with a mysteriously zombie
like group of "perfect teens" in a small town. Add in the token outsider,
token love interest/rebel/pretty face, a token chilly bad guy,token
mysterious figure, introduced only to fit the conclusion together and a
cliché-filled predictable story. (the sight of feet walking, to build
suspense and mystery only works, when the result is a shock, it never is
here, yet the filmmakers feel the need to drill this premise into the ground,
after a while, I begin saying, to myself, who it was, trying to gain some fun
from this),  blend in some hip, pop culture references (the best of these
being the visualization of Pink Floyd's rebellious cry from Another Brick In
The Wall), Sprinkle in a hip, alternative filled soundtrack and teenage eye
candy, to draw in the adolescent viewers (the obvious desired demographic
here) and In a nutshell, that's the movie.  You see everything that's coming,
you are compelled to watch, trudging through a slow, tension building
development, given hints of deeper meanings, which are never delved on any
further, or even explained, and then, like a TV series, given a quick,
predictable, clean, conclusion, with a tease to "Tune in next week".</P>
<P>It is too bad that this movie doesn't work.  The premise was truly
interesting.  The 1975 cult classic Stepford Wives, was ripe for retouching,
with the right 90s flair.  Mind control, desired perfection, in the right
hands, this could've been a chilling social commentary on parental, and peer
pressure for perfection.  Instead, this is a rushed, forced, predictable
mess.  The movie starts with promise, in an introspective, interesting and
compelling opening scene, the newcomer Marsden, is given a social "tour" of
the school by Gavin (The Man Without A Face's Nick Stahl).  This scene shows
the movie's potential, a struggle to make the perfect class, and the pool of
"others" from whom there is to choose.        The pace and presentation of the
movie are compelling, and intruiging enough to keep you watching (admittedly,
I was not bored, and did keep watching with interest, I liked about the first
10-20 minutes of this).  But once the hand is tipped, like that *snap*, it's
gone. All wrapped up in a nice, sensible, predictable, very sloppily and
hastily delivered finale.  The performances are faceless, nameless even. 
Marsden and Katie Dawson, both adolescent eye candy, are sure to raise the
hormone levels of their respective age-groups.        However, they serve as no
more than puppeteered window dressing.        Bruce Greenwood (an Atom Egoyan
favorite) serves only to create tension, and an evil, chilling presence (want
a better view of this aspect of him, see The Sweet Hereafter).        William
Sadler is usually a watchably maniacally character actor, here, he also seems
only to be filling a position, and never really flexes his known ability
although he, and Stahl do give the movie at least some watchability.  Each
character has a purpose, but is underdeveloped, we don't understand them, and
really don't care.</P>
<P>I felt very cheated by this movie.  The ads showed so much promise, the
beginning teased and hinted of so much more, and then, wham, bam, nothing.  I
sat and stared at the screen, along with a few others, in disbelief of what
had just been done to us.  We all wanted more.        David Nutter must be an
effective television director, to get this chance to make this movie. 
Someone needs to tell him that his chances, and possibilities, increase
proportionally, as the size of the viewing screen does.  Wait for this one on
late night cable. ________________________________________________ See more
