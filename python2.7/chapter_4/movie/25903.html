<P>   One of the most memorable cartoons in The New Yorker
magazine shows a young American woman with the Eiffel
Tower in the background telling a local, "But I don't WANT to
see the real Paris...I want to see the TOURIST's Paris!"  Who
can blame her?  The real anything is not what would interest
anyone out on a fun holiday, nor would the real people have
much use for the typical American tourist.  If you go to Spain,
say, to the particularly romantic city of Seville, do you want to
see how the ordinary people--who, compared to Americans,
would be considered poor--live, or do you want to take in the
flamenco joints, feast on the paella mariscada at the Meson
Sevilla, and take a horse and buggy ride along the banks of
the Guadalquivir?  I rest my case.</P>
<P>   But there's still a chance for you to see the authentic
Andalucians without leaving the comfort of a theater seat by
taking in Benito Zambrano's thoughtful film "Solas," winner of
11 nominations for the Goya (Spain's Oscars), and a well-
traveled movie that has hit the filmfest circuit from Berlin to
Toronto and then some.  "Solas," which means "alone,"
sounds like a downer from its title, and to a fan of fast-
moving, commercial, and highly financed pictures it would
seem to be just that.  Yet if you patiently take on the sincere
dialogue expressed by people you won't see on the glossy
pages of the Spanish Tourist Board's brochures, you will see
at least three of the characters redeemed from lives of abuse,
solitude and desperation.  Even more than in the dialogue,
you will feel every fleeting and lingering emotion alike simply
by studying the faces of the skilled performers, particularly
that of Maria Galina as the elderly mother of a troubled
woman who drinks, smokes, steals and is given to outbreaks
of tempestuous emotion and a kaleidoscope of grimaces.</P>
<P>   At the story's center is Maria (Ana Fernandez) who should
have received the Goya simply for her ability to run through a
performance for at least an hour before cracking even the
dawn of a smile.  She's in bad shape.  She drinks and
smokes and, being without a job, she runs up a tab with a
friendly bartender whom she calls simply Fat Man.  This is
one angry piece of work.  Why?  We learn (but never
observe) that she and her mother were hit from time to time
by Maria's father (Paco De Osca), now recovering from an
operation in an unnamed city in Southern Spain where
Maria's mother, a village person, is invited to share a musty,
mildewed flat rented by Maria.  Nothing world-shaking
happens.  Director Benito Zambrano is more interested in
conveying the inner turmoil of his principals, and so while
Maria (who refuses to visit her father) gets into a fracas with
her offensive boy friend and her mother wiles away the days
crocheting and cooking and visiting her sick and disparaging
old husband in the hospital, hope arises only by the presence
of a neighbor (Carlos Alvarez-Novoa) who is old and has no
family and no one to talk to except his loyal German
Shepherd Achilles.</P>
<P>   While Maria buys the occasional lottery ticket from the blind
seller outside the bar, nothing dramatic is to come her way
through the sort of contrivance you might expect in a
Hollywood movie.  Instead, the elderly neighbor is to offer
three people a chance at a modicum of pleasure--Maria, her
mother, and himself.</P>
<P>   Zambrano states in the notes: "Film must be more than a
sad story.  We propose solidarity, love and tenderness as the
weapons to win love  over loneliness, misery and
dehumanization.  We urge others to always look for
happiness, because it is our right.  Even if it seems there is
no way out, there always exists somewhere to escape from
unhappiness."</P>
<P>   We all know that what the world needs now is love, sweet
love, but Zambrano ups the ante by suggesting solidarity and
tenderness as key ingredients as well.  "Solas," a downer on
the most obvious level, turns out to be its converse.  Rich or
poor, it's nice to have money.  But if you can't get the cash,
trust in your capacity to find gratification in the enjoyment of
others.  Maria does, as does he neighbor.  We should all be
as fortunate.  "Solas" is targeted to a specialized audience of
those who see cinema not as an escape but as a chance to
confront the reality of our lives.  Zambrano's film is deeply
humanistic, blessed with a few performances that approach
the astonishing.</P>
