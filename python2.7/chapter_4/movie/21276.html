PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></PRE>
<P>When Message in a Bottle opens, a single mom enjoys a jog on the beach
after sending her son off to spend time with the ex.  As she runs, she
notices a bottle jutting out of the compacted sand, looks around as if
she were on Candid Camera, and finally pulls it free.  Yup; just like
the song, there is a message inside.</P>
<P>The woman is Theresa Osbourne (Robin Wright Penn), a researcher for the
Chicago Tribune, and the letter moves her and her equally lovelorn
co-workers to tears.  It is, apparently, a letter written by a man that
had recently lost his wife and had written the message as some type of
bizarre sea catharsis.  And you know how chicks eat that stuff up.</P>
<P>Not able to put the memory of the message or the effect of its romantic
drivel out of her head, Theresa decides to track down the mystery man.
Now, mind you, she only knows a few things about him – he is a horrible
typist and he loves to use awful boat metaphors in his work.  The
newspaper then writes a brief human interest piece on the enigma of a
message in a bottle and, after receiving tons of responses, Theresa
winds up getting copies of two other letters similar in form and
content.</P>
<P>Together with the crack research staff of the Tribune (which resembles
something more like an expert FBI forensics team), Theresa tracks down
the author of her letters via a tiny stationery store in St. Claire,
North Carolina.  It seems that after all of these years, the store
employee still had the name and address of the guy who bought the
letterhead and had no qualms about giving it out.  His name is Garret
Blake (Kevin Costner), a boat-fixer-upper guy in St. Claire.  Theresa is
on the next flight to North Carolina.</P>
<P>Her first glimpse of Garret is down on the water as he works on
restoring a beautiful schooner.  As luck would have it, he is an
attractive man with big, strong, blue-collar hands, his only physical
defect being thinning hair (in real life, he would have been a Morley
Safer lookalike).  She feigns interest in the vessel and he invites her
to take a little sail with him.  Despite the fact that she was raised in
a land-locked state, Theresa never gets seasick during the one-hour
cruise.</P>
<P>The two spend the next three days together and end up falling in love
more quickly (and almost more unbelievably) than Leslie Nielsen and
Priscilla Presley in The Naked Gun.  Theresa discovers that Garret's
artist wife died after pregnancy complications.  Not quite over his
monumental loss, Garret hasn't quite had the heart to disturb any of his
late wife's belongings – their house is somewhat of a living shrine to
her memory.  Of course, none of this hinders Garret from trying to get
into Theresa's pants lickety-split.  At one point, he awkwardly asks `Do
you like meat?'  What a smooth talker!</P>
<P>Things progress predictably until the final reel, when things take a bit
of an unexpected twist and all but the numbest apathetic will have their
waterworks turned to full blast.  Penn and Costner have little
chemistry, but are individually inoffensive – she has great hair and he
has tight jeans (this may be a special clause in all of his contracts).
Acting-wise, Paul Newman is the only standout as Garret's crusty old
father.  He is much more effective as a weathered drunk than last year's
staggeringly hokey gumshoe in Twilight.</P>
<P>The filmmakers are no strangers to the tear-jerking medium – director
Luis Mandoki (When a Man Loves a Woman) and writer Gerald DiPego
(Phenomenon) etch a moderately light version of The English Patient,
with Oscar winner Gabriel Yared providing the score.  Based on a novel
by Nicholas Sparks (The Notebook), Message is warmly lensed by Caleb
Deschanel (Fly Away Home).  As a film it's mediocre, but as a chick
flick it's better than most.</P>
