<PRE>Contact</PRE>
<P>When you look up in the sky late at night, do you ever have the feeling
that another being is doing the same thing light years away? How could
there be so many stars and no other life than just us? It would be a
terrible waste of space wouldn't it?</P>
<P>Contact looks at these questions and more. Based on the Carl Sagan book by
the same name, Contact follows the story of a radio astronomer, Ellie
Arroway (Jodie Foster). Since she was a kid, she has been interested in
radio, and using the radio to find other people, or peoples. Arroway starts
her professional career at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, it is
here where she meets Joss (Matthew McConaughey), a biblical man, who does
not believe in technology. Arroway is working on the SETI (Search for
ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence) project. And, thew work is long and dry.
Long and dry enough for the head of the National Science Foundation, Dr.
Drumlin (Tom Skerritt), to cut their funding.
Arroway then, with the help of her coworkers, get private funding to do
research in New Mexico. The funding comes from an eccentric rich man,
Hadden (John Hurt). And after two years of searching, they have yet to turn
something up. So, yet again, Drumlin steps in and wants the project to be
shutdown, because the radio telescopes could be used for more "practical"
projects. But, before the project is cancelled, Arroway and team get The
Message from a star named Vega.
All of that build up takes place in the slow introductory forty minutes.
>From there, director, Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future
series), tries to explore the effect The Message has on science and
religion. And how the two are in conflict with each other. It is here that
the movie picks up the pace, but only by a little. We see Arroway go
through letdown after letdown. The payoff for all of these letdowns, slow
intro, and religious/science exploration, is good but not as satisfying as
can be.</P>
<P>The opening sequence sets the pace for the movie, and has to be seen it's
an incredible sequence.
Worth mentioning is John Hurt as the eccentric man, Hadden. Hurt gives a,
short, but brilliant performance. His character is, for me, one of the most
memorable characters in the movies of summer 1997. Jodie Foster gives a
solid performance, as usual. The special effects, although never
overshadowing the characters and story, are incredible. The opening
sequence, close to the end sequence, and machine are unbeatable. I've not
finished reading the book, but so far the movie sticks pretty much to the
book. And this could be accounted for because of Sagan and his wife
producing the film.</P>
<P>I have only a few complaints. The movie is just a bit on the long side,
running around two and half-hours. Zemeckis uses the same sort of T.V. type
inserts as Forrest Gump, but there seems to be an over use of it in
Contact. Sometimes it seems that he used T.V. footage just to give the
movie a documentary feel. The score from Alan Silvestri is easily forgettable.</P>
<P>Though I have some complaints, Contact is a wonderful movie. It is by far
one of the best sci-fi films to be released lately. And being the summer
film season, it is a film unlike most other summer films, intelligent. I
highly recommend Contact.</P>
