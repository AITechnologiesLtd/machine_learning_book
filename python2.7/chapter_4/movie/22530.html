<P>Imagine a story about a master sleuth, cut down in his prime left in a
state of immobility. He is called upon to help in the investigation of
a series of murders so vicious that the even the police are baffled.
Now add to that mix a young rookie cop, called upon by the paralyzed
investigator to assist him on the case. That simple little plot line
sounds like an intriguing idea for a thriller. Don't be fooled. 'The
Bone Collector' is one of the most maddeningly intelligence stifling
films since 1998's 'Lost In Space'. What makes the film even more
aggravating is the utter waste of a talented cast and crew.</P>
<P>Denzel Washington stars as Lincoln Rhyme, a quadriplegic former
Forensics specialist. Unable to move other than his eyes, his mouth
and one finger (no ventilators or catheters here?!), he wants to end
his life. His injury also causes seizures which may result in brain
death. His character is shown laying in his deluxe apartment (which
could house a small business, I didn't know cops were paid that much
in NYC), watching a peregrine falcon roosting on his window sill. The
bird seems to be an ally, watching over the detective; giving him the
strength to carry on.</P>
<P>When a powerful New York City businessman is found murdered, rookie
officer Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is first to arrive on the
scene. Using a disposable camera she, documents the crime scene before
evidence is washed away by the rain. She discovers additional evidence
one the train tracks and single handedly stops the on-coming train
before it can destroy the clues. This exercise in examination and care
brings her to the attention of Rhyme, who has been called back into
service by his friends on the force, to the chagrin of Capt. Howard
Cheney (Michael Rooker). Urging Officer Donaghy to be his eyes on the
crime scene, an unusual partnership is started.</P>
<P>We are introduced to the killer almost immediately in the form of a
shadowy cab driver who has a toy monkey hanging from his rear view
mirror. One of the clues left at the murder scene (and at each murder
scene) is a small bone fragment, always in the most preposterously
difficult location, but always found. All of the clues are discovered,
including a series of small pieces of paper no bigger than a corner of
a postage stamp. All of these clues lead Officer Donaghy to the
discovery of a true crime book published in the early 1920's called
"The Bone Collector". The crimes being committed are exact duplicates
of the crimes detailed in the book, but no motive can be deduced. That
is until the maddeningly contrived and ridiculous ending, where Ryhme
is confronted by the serial killer who goes to great lengths to
explain his reasoning for the murders and why Ryhme was his primary
victim all along.</P>
<P>Now, to be certain; 'The Bone Collector' does have a grand amount of
atmosphere. The Cinematography by Dean Semler creates a New York so
seedy and forbidding as to possibly kill that states tourist industry
for the next decade. But the plotting of the film and the entire set
up is so convoluted and contrived that it plays like an accident. A
fine example is when searching an old bookstore, Officer Donaghy finds
the "Bone Collector" novel in the first place she looks, on the top
shelve four feet above her, in the second row, buried under several
other books. Now while the character's deductive powers are supposed
to be brilliant, this is taking it too far.</P>
<P>Also.. and this is a spoiler (so do not read this if you do intend to
see the film).</P>
<P>When the killer finally attacks Rhyme in his apartment, he takes so
long to explain his motives that Rhyme is able to finally regain
movement in his hand, enough so that he can operate his hospital bed
to collapse onto the villains hand. At that point, Rhyme is also able
to move his neck enough to deliver the final blow (which does not yet
end the attack). And of course, this just prolongs the climax long
enough for Officer Donaghy to save the day.</P>
<P>The film is so maddening, in that here you have some of the best
talent in film making working on a project so by the numbers, that it
becomes almost absurd. The clues are all pointless, they are set ups
that lead the police in the opposite direction of where they should be
looking. If this were a real example of NYPD investigative resources,
that the crime rates would be astronomical. Mayor Gulliani  should sue
Universal for defamation of local.</P>
<P>Director Philip Noyce (whose credits include the marvelously deft
"Dead Calm" and amusing Zatoichi remake "Blind Fury"), works with a
sure hand. He manages to draw such earnest performances from his
actors, that one could almost (almost), forget the plot contrivances
here. Unfortunately, the script by Jeremy Iocone is loaded with every
possible variation of the serial killer genre, that the film becomes a
template of scenes that never really coalesce into a whole film.</P>
<P>The performances are all very earnest. Angelina Jolie shines as
Officer Donaghy. Her growing maturity and revulsion at her work is
both honest and believable. Ditto Denzel Washington, who manages to
make us accept his physical condition as well as his desire for death.
The chemistry between these two stars is palpable, but unfortunately
even that is dissipated by the inclusion of a scene wherein Officer
Donaghy strokes Rhymes one good finger. That scene is so riff with
unsubtle sexual overtones that it's juvenile.</P>
<P>"The Bone Collector" is one film that should have been better. It
tries hard to be a variation of the film "Se7en", but only succeeds in
being a morbid and grotesque remake of a Umberto Lenzi giallo film. A
disappointing and ultimately disastrous film.</P>
