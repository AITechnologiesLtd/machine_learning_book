<P>Perhaps I am overindulgent in my praise but I still think "The Blair Witch 
Project" is one of the best horror films of the last twenty years. It was 
good enough for me to dedicate a webpage to the film considering how many 
people had misunderstood it and its intentions. Although the film may not 
have been completely original, its approach certainly was. Primarily shot on 
video and 16mm black-and-white film, it had the look and feel of an extremely 
low-budget feature that could have been made by anyone with a camcorder and a 
computer. The difference with "Blair" as opposed to other independent horror 
flicks, such as "The Evil Dead" and "Halloween," is that it did not feel like 
a movie - it sort of transpired before our eyes in practically documentary 
fashion. Now we have a sequel, "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2," that commits 
the error of most other shopworn sequels - it has gore, sex, loud heavy metal 
music, and a host of ghostly manifestations right out of 1999's "The 
Haunting." The original suggested the 
menace of evil. This "Blair" leaves precious little to the imagination, 
though we can be thankful that there is still no visible witch. </P>
<P>"Blair Witch 2" begins promisingly enough. There is a nifty prologue set in 
the town of Burkittsville where the "Blair Witch" mania has spun out of 
control, and the local citizens speak out on how they have dealt with it. The 
local sheriff reassures the "Blair" fans that there is no witch in the town 
or in the woods. But then things go wrong. A mental asylum is shown as a 
flashback of where Jeffrey Donovan, a former patient, was abused by the 
doctors and guards. Once Jeffrey is released, he organizes a Blair Witch 
Hunt, which is a tour of the Black Hills woods where the original movie took 
place. Jeffrey finds four other willing participants for his tour through the 
magic of the Internet. They include: Kim Director, a telekinetic goth chick 
(resembling a pale Heather Donahue) who found the movie to be cool; Erica 
Leerhsen, a sensitive Wiccan obsessed with spreading the good word about 
witches; and a couple (Stephen Barker Turner and Tristen Skyler) involved in 
writing a book on the Blair Witch. Together they
 camp out in the woods where they find misplaced trees and another wandering 
tour group. After a wild night of drugs and heavy Jack Daniels boozing, they 
find out the next day that the cameras are all gone, except for the tapes, 
and all the research from the Blair authors is shredded. What happened during 
that night? And what is it with all the bloody witch markings on their 
bodies? And who killed that rival tour group at Coffin Rock? </P>
<P>At this point, the film begins to get a little more intriguing in the 
investigation of the tapes that were set up in the cameras to record their 
nighttime activities. The group's intent is to discover what happened to 
them, and what they find is quite grisly and decadent to say the least. 
Unfortunately, director Joe Berlinger (acclaimed documentarian of films such 
as "Paradise Lost" and "Brother's Keeper") throws in everything to the mix 
except the witch. We get milisecond shock cuts in the form of flashforwards, 
relentlessly repeated montages of stabbings and dripping blood, ghostly 
manifestations of the Burkittsville children killed long ago by the witch, 
naked bodies dancing and cavorting in the woods, some sexual byplay between 
Erica and Stephen, and so on. Although it is not as overdone as your basic 
slasher cum horror flick sequel, it feels like a bastardization of everything 
the original "Blair Witch" did so well.</P>
<P>Another problem are the characters who feel like they had been recycled from 
the "Scream" mix (Marilyn Manson's song "Disposable Teens" gives a hint of 
what's to come). With the sole exception of the goth chick, all the 
characters are unmemorable and bland to say the least - they scream, shout 
and argue but they hardly have much in the way of personality. Heather, Mike 
and Josh were annoying too but they had gobs of humanity, wit and sympathy - 
everything this cast lacks. The pregnant Tristen Skyler, who should be the 
most sympathetic of the bunch, comes across as the most unlikable - she even 
dreams of killing her newborn! If we cannot care about the characters, then 
we care less if there is a witch inducing a group hypnosis on this bunch.</P>
<P>The concept of this film is fascinating - it assumes the original was just a 
film and that this group is out to perhaps debunk the myth. Although the 
ending is gripping, it lacks the emotional subtext of the original. There are 
some good Heather Donahue jokes, a nod to Frederick Wiseman's excellent 
documentary, "Titicut Follies," and some occasionally tense scenes but 
mostly, this is a lifeless, perfunctory affair. It's obvious that nobody 
could have made a decent sequel to a phenomenon like "The Blair Witch 
Project," a horror film that only comes around once in a blue moon. There is 
sound advice from Randy in "Scream 2" that the filmmakers should listen to - 
'Sequels suck. They are inferior films. The horror genre was destroyed by 
them'. Sounds just about right.     </P>
