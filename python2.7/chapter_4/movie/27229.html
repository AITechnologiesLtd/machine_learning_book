<PRE>FINDING FORRESTER
-----------------</PRE>
<P>Jamal Wallace (newcomer Rob Brown) loves to read and write in his journals,
but hides this fact from his family and buddies in the Bronx.  In public, he
spends his time playing basketball at a local court watched over by a 
mysterious stranger from a window in an old building.  On a dare, Jamal
enters the stranger's apartment, but is frightened by the old man who lives
there and runs, leaving his backpack.  This fortuitous event will be the 
beginning of an unusual mentorship and great friendship in "Finding Forrester."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>"Finding Forrester" skates in upon a slate of comparisons to director Gus
van Sant's own "Good Will Hunting."  While there are similarities, the new
film has quite a different feel than the Boston blue collar drama.</P>
<P>Jamal sees his backpack hanging in that mysterious window - is it a taunt?
an invitation?  He resists, and wins, when the pack suddenly lands at his
feet in the street one day.  Reunited with his beloved journals, Jamal is
first shocked, then intrigued to find that his writings have been marked up
like school assignments by an obviously intelligent and interested reader.</P>
<P>A few false starts later, and Jamal meets the stranger, a gruff, Scotch
swilling Scotsman (Sean Connery) who gradually opens up, pleased to share
a love of the written word.  Then Jamal's secret is blown with his mother
and brother Terrell (Busta Rhymes, "Shaft") when test scores reveal his 
intelligence and result in a scholarship to Mailer Callow, a Manhattan prep 
school that needs a winning basketball team.</P>
<P>At Mailer Callow, Jamal, a black teen from the Bronx,  must navigate the world 
of the white and wealthy.  Claire (Anna Paquin, "X-Men") steps in to lead
the way, beginning another odd relationship for Jamal.  When his story's
conflict arrives it's twofold.  Jamal discovers that his Scottish friend is
William Forrester, a J. D. Salinger-like reclusive legend, who obviously
wishes Jamal to keep his identity secret.  Professor Crawford (F. Murray
Abraham), a failed author and Forrester devotee, doesn't believe a boy from
the Bronx is capable of writing Jamal's words and sets out to discredit him.</P>
<P>While Mike Rich's screenplay doesn't offer any real surprises, sometimes
dipping into cliche, rebounding with good dialogue, the amazing chemistry 
between veteran actor Connery and the untrained Brown is palpable.  Brown, 
who answered a casting call in hopes of getting wages as an extra to
pay off a cell phone bill, is one of the year 2000's great acting discoveries.
Brown gives Jamal grace, confidence and smarts, holding his own against the 
Scottish Oscar winner.  Rob Brown is the main reason to see this film.
Connery also gives a fine performance, but isn't given as much to work with.
Support is OK, but only Busta Rhymes as Jamal's brother and the (uncreditted?)
actress who plays his mom really distinguish themselves.  Abraham is a bit too
patently villainish.</P>
<P>Van Sant's tech crew does a fine job, with fluid camerwork by Harris Savides
("The Yards") and nuanced art direction by Jane Musky ("At First Sight").
Unfortunately, he allows his film to play for over two hours and the
material doesn't warrant it.  A cutesy cameo at film's end may have seemed
a good idea at the time, but calls too much attention to itself, working
against the cinematic experience.  Still, "Finding Forrester" is a solid
entry into the 'teacher/student' genre and the first film of a potential new
star.</P>
