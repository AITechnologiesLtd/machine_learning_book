RONIN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Who or what is a Ronin, you ask?  In somber, slow moving white text on a
black background, a didactic RONIN feels compelled to explain the
definition of its title before it lets the movie begin.  With the
solemnity befitting a religious epic, we learn that in feudal Japan,
Samurai whose liege lords were killed were called Ronin.  Forced to
wander the countryside looking for work, they hired themselves out as
contract killers or as whatever their new employers wanted.</P>
<P>(You'll be glad to know the introduction is little more than a confusing
diversion having scant bearing on the movie at hand.  Although there is
some relevance, it is best ignored.)</P>
<P>John Frankenheimer, who has directed films as intriguingly excellent as
THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and as laughably awful as THE ISLAND OF DR.
MOREAU, focuses all of his considerable talents for tension on RONIN.</P>
<P>The problem with the movie, however, stems directly from Frankenheimer's
skill as an action director.  He's too adept for his own good.  The car
chases, which are masterfully staged, overwhelm a much better
psychological thriller underneath.  After the one-hundredth car is
demolished in his driving-against-heavy-traffic demolition derby, the
audience is ready to cry "uncle."  Stop already and get back to the
plot.</P>
<P>The story trying desperately to get out is an outstanding character
study of intrigue and double-dealing.  Thanks to David Mamet's rewrite
of J.D. Zeik's original script, the movie pulsates with Mamet's
intelligent brand of terse, enigmatic dialog.  (Mamet writes under the
pseudonym Richard Weisz due to a contract dispute.)</P>
<P>As the movie opens, we meet a group of bad guys who know as little about
what is happening as we do.  An Irish ice goddess, who reveals little
more than her name, Deirdre, has collected five criminals to pull off
some unknown job.  The veteran criminals are strangers who are instantly
leery of each other.</P>
<P>As the organizer, Deirdre, Natascha McElhone from THE TRUMAN SHOW and
MRS. DALLOWAY gives the best performance of her young career.  An
actress who is best when she has to keep her emotions closely in check,
McElhone is perfectly cast for the role.  Her character's coldness makes
her few displays of genuine feelings all the more dramatic, none better
than a brief kissing scene.</P>
<P>The odd assembly of crooks quickly begins to size up each other's
skills.  They even devise subtle tests of their acumen.</P>
<P>As Sam, Robert De Niro is Mr. Caution.  If there's any doubt about a
situation, he stays frozen in his tracks like a deer caught in the glare
of a car's headlights.  But, when he does move, De Niro shows that he
can play a quite credible action hero.</P>
<P>The rest of the team of mutual distrust includes Jean Reno as Vincent,
Stellan Skarsgard as Gregor, Skipp Suddeth as Larry and Sean Bean as
Spence.  The remainder of the ensemble cast is as good as the
principals.  Jonathan Pryce, for example, plays a sinister Irish leader
named Seamus, who has an unstated mission.</P>
<P>The setup for the plot is that the team is supposed to steal a case of
unknown contents, guarded by a group of unknown size, from a yet to be
revealed location at some time in the near future.  The movie is set in
France and features great aerial location shots of Paris and Nice.</P>
<P>In this movie of cross, double-cross, and triple-cross, stealing the
case becomes a child's game of case, case, who's got the case.  The
movie is at its very best when the least is known.  This spirit,
thankfully, is continually recaptured as many facts are found out not be
true after all, leaving the gang to try to rediscover what is happening.</P>
<P>The sparse dialog uses the unspoken word even better the spoken to
advance the storyline.  Even knowing the old adage that there's no honor
among thieves, the movie keeps surprising us.</P>
<P>"No questions, no answers, that's the business we're in," Vincent says
at the end.  This movie's business is as a mysterious thriller, not a
mindless action picture.  With about fifteen minutes of car chases
edited out, the marvelous movie at its core could have gotten out.  As
delivered, it's many outstanding parts are obscured by endless, action
sequences.</P>
<P>RONIN runs 1:58.  It is rated R for violence and profanity and would be
fine for teenagers.</P>
