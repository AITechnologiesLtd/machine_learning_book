<PRE>                            LARKS ON A STRING
                  A film review by Thomas E. Billings
                   Copyright 1991 Thomas E. Billings</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
In Czechoslovakia in the early 1950's, a group of "bourgeois" men are
sent to work in a metal scrapyard for "reeducation".  There they meet a
group of women prisoners.  A witty, funny film that contrasts the
people's desire for freedom with the tyranny of the socialist state they
live in; an extremely sarcastic satire of socialism.  A very good but
slow-moving film.</P>
<P>Czechoslovakia (English subtitles), color, 1969, banned by Czech
government censors, released 1990, 95 minutes.
Director: Jiri Menzel.</P>
<P>     In Czechoslovakia in the early 1950's (at the time of the Korean
war), a group of upper and middle class men have been sent to a steel
mill for "reeducation", i.e., to learn to love the Communist party that
oppresses and enslaves their nation.  The men work in the scrapyard,
sorting scrap which is to be melted down into new steel products.  They
work next to a group of women prisoners, "defectors", who are guilty of
the crime of attempting to leave the socialist "worker's paradise".</P>
<P>     Although the men and women work in different parts of the
scrapyard, and the women are guarded, they get together as often as
possible.  The basic plot of the film concerns the men interacting with
a hypocritical party official and the threat of the ever-present secret
police, and two romances.  One of the romances is between a man in the
reeducation group and a woman prisoner; the other major romance is that
of the man who guards the women; he is a newlywed.</P>
<P>     The film portrays the Communist government as hypocritical and
extremely totalitarian; dissent is prohibited.  Simply questioning the
rulers on their commands, or reminding them of their own slogans, can
result in your being sent to prison for political "crimes".  The Party
officials who rule the "worker's paradise" are depicted as drunks,
fools, liars, and even worse (I won't explain the "even worse" part, as
that might spoil part of the film; see it and you will find out!).
Given the negative (but probably generally accurate) portrayal of Party
officials in the film, it is not surprising that the (Party) censors
suppressed the film by banning it.</P>
<P>     The subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) struggle of the men for
freedom and their human dignity and rights provides many opportunities
for sarcastic political humor.  The romances give the director a way to
poke fun at general human nature, a sort of counterpoint to the
political humor.  I suppose the general message of the film is that the
human spirit can triumph over both the evil tyranny of socialism, and
the smaller problems of everyday life.</P>
<P>     This film won the Grand Prize at the 1990 Berlin Film Festival.  I
liked the film, especially its witty, sarcastic humor, and its strong
anti-socialist message.  However, it is very slow-moving, and you might
wonder at times if the film has a plot, or is "going anywhere".  There
is quite a bit of character development, but not much action in the
film.</P>
<P>     The film is too slow-moving to recommend to a general audience.
However, if you appreciate a witty, funny film laced with social and
political satire, it is worth considering.</P>
<P>Distribution:  In its first U.S. theatrical release, and showing
currently (6/10) in San Francisco (Opera Plaza Cinema). Probably
available elsewhere also; New York and/or Los Angeles perhaps?</P>
