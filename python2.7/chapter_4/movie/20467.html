<P>There have been bad films in recent years: 'Mr. Magoo' was by far the worst ever
made, the spectacularly bad 'Blue In The Face', the horrible 'Baby Genuises'
and now 'I Woke Up Early The Day I Died'. It may not however be the worst movie
made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie. The film's acting (if that's what
you want to call it) is well mediocre to me. Loaded with a sensational cast you
would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit, boy was I wrong.</P>
<P>After escaping from a mental institution 'The Thief' played by Billy Zane goes
out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty. He turns to
burglary to survive, robs a loan back, kills the loan officer and runs with
thousands. A country-wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him
down. He ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it
for later, comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere.
Now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day
until he gets his money back, ultimately leading to a finale that is less that
satisfying.</P>
<P>A film which was based on a 'long-lost' script by Ed Wood, I have only one
question: No dialogue, only music and movement where exactly is the point? The
film moves along at a rather slow pace, but does have one advantage: the
soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be
offensive to some. It opens with a fun, innovative opening credits sequence and
quickly goes downhill after that.</P>
<P>Some of the low points are when 'The Thief' steals a woman's purse, and then
she faints, Sandra Bernhard as a dancer and Tippi Hendren as a deaf woman whom
'The Thief' kills to the music of 'Psycho'. Come on people get some new ideas
already! What's even worse is that the film has no plot at all. Well to a
certain extent it does, but who cares by the time the middle of the film
arrives we're bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to
happen.</P>
<P>'I Woke Up Early The Day I Died' is a perfectly bad film. It shows us how low
filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie. Even with the
huge cast talent, the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of
yours.</P>
