<PRE>Buffy The Vampire Slayer
A Review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Kristy Swanson; Donald Sutherland; Paul Reubens & Rutger Hauer</P>
<P>Buffy The Vampire Slayer is the film that spawned the successful television
series of the same name. While Buffy's creator Joss Whedon, who is probably
one of the most talented men in Hollywood, wrote both the TV series and the
movie, the lead actress is different. Buffy was first played by Kristy
Swanson in this movie, as opposed to Sarah Michelle Gellar who plays the
vampire killing babe on TV.</P>
<P>Buffy is cheesy. And it is meant to be (at least I hope that they meant it
to be). My first piece of advice is if you watch this film expecting
anything other than a campy, fun little film, you are in for a big
disappointment.</P>
<P>Apparently vampires roam the Earth. On top of this disturbing fact, there is
only one person that can stop them. The Vampire Slayer. Now there is only
one slayer at a time, and each time one gets killed a new one is chosen to
replace her. Well, in present day Los Angeles its air-head cheerleader Buffy
(Kristy Swanson) that gets the nod to be the next slayer. When she gets
approached by Merrick (Donald Sutherland), her watcher (the guy that trains
her), she is not exactly interested in the job. But soon becomes convinced
that LA has more than its share of vampire activity. The vamps are headed up
by Lothos, played by Rutger Hauer in one of his usual villain rolls. The
interesting casting choice comes in Lothos' sidekick, Amilyn, played by none
other than Paul Reubens (a.k.a. Pee Wee Herman). Now I don't want to give
anything away, but when Pee Wee's fate is decided at the end of the movie it
is one of my favorite scenes in a movie of all time. I won't say any more
but the movie is almost worth it for that one scene alone. Almost, but not
quite. As a horror film -- it isn't scary. As a comedy -- it isn't that
funny. So I'm not really sure what Buffy The Vampire Slayer is trying to be.
As I said, I think Buffy's writer Joss Whedon is one of the most talented
men in Hollywood, but I get the impression that this one of his earliest
efforts, and I must say that his skills have improved significantly since
this movie.</P>
<P>Kristy Swanson shines in this movie if only because she is just so darn
cute. That and the fact that she seems to get most of the best lines on the
movie, other than Pee Wee. Donald Sutherland and Rutger Hauer are good in
their roles but one has to wonder just how bad their careers were at the
time to take these roles. Luke Perry also shows up as pike, Buffy love
interest. Not being a big Luke Perry fan, I was surprisingly impressed at
the job that he did.</P>
<P>In Summary, Buffy is cheesy, campy, and not a particularly great movie,
although worth a look if you are just interested in a little bit of fun
without having to think too much.</P>
<P>Good for a few laughs, but not much else  5/10</P>
