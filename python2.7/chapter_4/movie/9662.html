<PRE>VERTIGO (1958)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Alfred Hitchcock
Writers: Samuel A. Taylor and Alec Coppel (from the book "Entre Les
Morts" by Pierre Boileu and Thomas Narcejac)
Starring: James Stewart, Kim Novak, Babara Del Geddes</P>
<P>On the surface, "Vertigo" looks like a manipulative jokester of a movie,
constantly giving you ideas, then turning the exact opposite direction
with them, frustrating you.  Then, of course, half way through, the film
pulls a 180, chaning the underlying mood from a detective mystery film
to a sick obsession flick.  But the second half is merely fueled by the
first half, which presents the idea of sexual obsession then goes full
blast with it in the second half.</P>
<P>When "Vertigo" initially came out in the 50s, it was criticized for many
of the same things I said in the first paragraph.  Manipulative. 
Stupid.  Not enough suspense.  But a couple years later, people finally
GOT the film, and now it's a classic.  This film is not to be watched
literally, but to be watched introspectively.  Everything this film is
about is beyond the surface, inbedded in symbolism and theme, creating a
film that is not just one of Hitchcock's best, but probably his most
personal film.</P>
<P>The story centers around a detective named Scottie (James Stewart), who
suffers a massive tragedy when he and another cop are chasing a crook on
rooftops in San Francisco, and he nearly tumbles to his death, only to
watch as the cop who tries to save him falls to his own demise.  From
this, he receives a nasty dose of achrophobia, fear of heights, which
gives him vertigo, which is dizziness, which is exactly what Hitchcock
takes us through.</P>
<P>Stewart is hired by an old college chum a bit later to follow his wife
(Kim Novak), who seems to have developed a bit of insanity, and wanders
off aimlessly, and turns out to believe she is her great-grandmother, a
woman who went insane and killed herself.  As Scottie spies on her, he
becomes more and more obsessed with her, and after he saves her when she
tries to drown herself, he falls deeper in love with her.  Until one day
when fate steps in with her bit of insanity, and at a monestary in
California, she runs to the top of a bell tower, and throws herself to
the ground, all while Scottie is crippled on the stairs by his fear of
heights.</P>
<P>Scottie enters a deep ravine of depression, but one day sees a woman who
looks just like her (also Kim Novak), just a brunette.  He approaches
her, and they begin dating.  Of course, it turns out she was really the
other woman, and was posing as the original so the husband could kill
her and get away with it.  Now, this is pretty hard to swallow, I know,
but do yourself a favor, and don't get hung up on it.  The really great
part is yet to come.</P>
<P>What happens is Scottie and her are really in love, but Scottie's really
in love with what she was pretending to be, since she was the one he had
to follow.  So, he begins to transform her into her, buying her the
exact same dresses, dying her hair, and making her look exactly like
her.  His obsession reaches its fullest when she emerges from the
bathroom in a room lit by neon lights from outside, looking exactly like
the original.  It's one of the most frightening and brilliant scenes in
movie history.</P>
<P>This is, of course, a metaphor for the way Hitchcock had to mold women
into these women they really aren't, to satisfy himself.  He had, I
suppose, felt horrible about the ways he screwed with these women's
personalities, and dumped them for another one.  In most of Hitchcock's
films, the events were a metaphor for something else, but this is one of
the most disturbing ones.  The film is not really a great suspense film,
but really a fantastic introspective drama into the mind of a person
much like the master of suspense himself.</P>
<P>P.S. Make sure you get the widescreen remastered/reissued version that
came out this year.</P>
