<P>PLOT:
Woman with amnesia is living the life of a simple schoolteacher & doting
mother when her memory suddenly jogs up her past as a professional assassin
for the US government. Along with the help of a two-bit, wise-cracking
gumshoe, she hits the road to discover her true identity.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Fun, unique action-thriller finally offers us an interesting female hero who
alongside the humorous verbal quips from Sam Jackson, keep the film moving
at an entertaining pace, despite a couple of small lulls here and there. I
will admit to being biased in this case, since I do generally enjoy action
films that are set during Christmas time, but this film should be fun for
others as well, since it does offer a cool heroine, some great action
sequences, a few over-the-top moments and Sam Jackson firing off jokes left
and right. It's obvious that writer Shane Black drew his inspiration from
the French classic LA FEMME NIKITA, which is a much deeper film with less
humor, but for what this one is, it does okay. Don't expect the greatest
action film of all-time, since the movie does seem to plod on at some
points, but all in all, it is a fun time at the movies. I especially fell in
love with the cooler than cool Casino hotel room that they bunked down in
while in Atlantic City. Now THAT'S a room! Great dialogue, much funniness by
the way of Jackson's character, some decent action scenes, a good premise,
and definitely NOT a film to be taken seriously. If you're looking for
mindless fun...look no further than this movie!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Writer Shane Black collected $4M for this script. In the first draft of his
screenplay, Mitch, the character played by Sam Jackson, died of his wounds.
One of my favorite lines in this film came from a Christmas well-wisher who
toasted folks along the lines of "This year, I am thankful that I do not
drink, smoke or curse....", which he quickly followed up with, "Shit, I DO
smoke and drink!".
Not sure if this was meant as an inside joke to one of Sam Jackson's most
popular character roles (Jules from PULP FICTION), but at one point in this
movie, Sam stands there with a gun at and says "I am one bad mutherf**cker".
A nod to one of Geena Davis' most popular roles (Thelma from THELMA &
LOUISE) came in the form of a scene featuring Davis riding a convertible
with sunglasses.
The two main characters in this film drink Finlandia Vodka. Director Renny
Harlin is from Finland.
Director Renny Harlin (Birth name: Lauri Mauritz Harjola) and actress Geena
Davis (Birth name: Virginia Elizabeth Davis) were a married couple while
making this movie. They separated in 1997.
Sam Jackson was nominated for a 1997 Image award for Outstanding Lead Actor
in a Motion Picture for his role in this film.
This film represented actor Craig Bierko's first major movie role. He
recently starred in THE 13TH FLOOR (6.5/10), and is apparently dating
actress Janeane Garofalo.</P>
