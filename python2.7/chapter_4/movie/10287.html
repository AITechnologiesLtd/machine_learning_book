<P>        Well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie
for you. Because thats all that there really is.... I found that after
watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in
the Plot. For one thing, a white leading actor who has a black
daughter does leave some curiosity.... I am not saying that this isn't
possible.. but it does leave one to wonder...I know I did. Another
thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched
out.... and certain Scenes are repeated essentially but with slight
variations. There was one scene that should have been short... but it
was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it I found
myself thinking.. OK enough already get on with it. There are also
times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do...
things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of
the sort... another thing that I noticed towards the end was that some
characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major
through most of the beginning. This movie is also very predictable...
you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you
definitely know what will happen at a given moment.. granted this is
hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at
you. Also some of the things that happen are a little TOO predictable
and several cliques are repeated... It gets boring at times to tell
you the truth... even though there is still action going on. Another
little point I might add is that the main character is supposed to be
a quiet chaos mathematician not some Shoot them up type of Hero. Some
of the characters are not proper for their roles. The acting is fine
but the characters just don't seem to add up. If I was to base my
review totally on the plot then I wouldn't rate this movie too highly
        But that's just the thing this movie isn't just the plot, its
the whole package and this package is really well done. The whole
movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to
overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a
movie. The special effects are just amazing, you can't tell that the
dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live, in a few
instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that
you just wouldn't be able to say that the creature wasn't there during
filming, extinct or not. Another thing is the Destruction scenes...
WOW, those were masterpieces.. well some of them were they were well
choreographed and along with the Dino's make this one of the reasons
to see this movie. This movie is fairly long but it is action packed
so it should do well in the box office.. unfortunately it will take
away from Fifth element but alas what can we do.. I may be too cynical
for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for
it few funny moments.. go see it in a matinee if you really must see
it its not worth full price if you ask me.
        One Little side note, although my opinion of this movie may
not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how
many theaters it was shown in Toronto this opening weekend is nothing
short of stupid, there were 10 theater movie theaters that were
playing this movie around the clock I think that some people really
want money badly.... and I think that this type of activity hurts the
movie industry let the other movies also have a chance.... you know
any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst
movie ever made..... I thought I'd put this here to deflate the movie
hype about this flick... its not that bad a movie but its not THAT
great either hope you people realize this.</P>
