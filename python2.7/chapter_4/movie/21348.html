<P>Susan Granger's review of "MUSIC OF THE HEART" (Miramax Films)</P>
<P>Can Wes Craven, creator of slasher/horror movies from Nightmare
on Elm Street to Scream, score in another genre? Yes! Working with an
intelligent screenplay by Pamela Gray (A Walk on the Moon), Craven
goes for a different kind of gut emotion in this timely, true story
violin instructor Roberta Guaspari, the mother of two young boys, who
was abandoned when her Naval officer husband ran off with another
woman. Forced into asserting her independence to survive, she cleverly
badgers an East Harlem principal into hiring her as a substitute music
teacher, despite the protests of the tenured faculty and the wariness
of the inner-city parents. Fervently believing in discipline, dignity,
and commitment, Roberta Guaspari struggles to teach classical violin
to disorderly, often resistant students, building self-esteem and
changing their lives in remarkable ways. And her crusade leads all the
way to Carnegie Hall, where violinists Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman,
Arnold Steinhardt and Mark O'Connor join in Fiddlefest, along with the
children of Guaspari's actual East Harlem violin program. If the story
sounds familiar, it was the basis of a 1995 Oscar-nominated
documentary, Small Wonders. Meryl Streep delivers a polished, virtuoso
performance that could earn her another well-deserved Oscar
nomination, while Angela Bassett, Gloria Estefan, and Aidan Quinn
deliver strong support. Estefan performs the title song with teen
sensation 'N Sync, and the sound track talent includes Jennifer Lopez,
C Note, Macy Gray, and Julio Iglesias Jr..  On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, Music of the Heart is an exhilarating, uplifting 8. Like
Mr. Holland's Opus, it's sentimental and emotionally manipulative but
there's an audience for this kind of heart-warming film that everyone
in the family can enjoy.</P>
