<P>The Blair Witch Project (R) ** 1/2
Starring Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard
Directed by Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sanchez
A Review by Frankie Paiva</P>
<P>If there is one film this summer (or any summer for that matter) besides Star
Wars could possibly create more hype than this film I would give it a prize.
What started out as a $35,000 dollar horror movie that could cover the fake
Blair Witch, would turn into a phenomenon. Early buzz out of Sundance had
people calling it the scariest film of all time, Artisan signed it that night
for 1 million, and the launch of the Blair Witch site began. </P>
<P>Generating a cult months before the movie opens rarely happens, but do to the
fantastic webpage (www.blairwitch.com) which features all of the fake
mythology, it had people hanging on the edge, waiting for the film to be
released. "The film cannot possibly live up to all of the hype that's been
surrounding it." That was a quote from George Lucas about Star Wars, and it's
true here too.</P>
<P>You know the story, three student filmmakers Heather, (Donahue) Michael,
(Michael Williams) and Josh (Leonard) are out to shoot a documentary about the
Blair Witch. Townspeople say she was old Ellie Keyward, accused of witchcraft
she was banished in the 1800s. Every fourty years after that, mysterious things
would happen. Disemboweled fisherman showed up at the river, children started
going missing, and an old man says he was killing children because an old witch
told him so. </P>
<P>They of course get lost and start hearing weird noises at night. One of the
crew goes missing, and what are all of those strange symbols that they keep
finding all over the forest?</P>
<P>The film does not live up to it's hype. I (and the 25 or so people that I've
talked with that saw it) all agree that is wasn't scary at all. What is hyped
to be the scariest film of all time didn't really inflict one twinge of pure
terror. The camera technique is interesting though, if not sickening, and I'd
like to see more films made that way. However do make sure to get a good
night's rest before seeing the film, the camera shaking didn't make me sick at
all, but it really made me sleepy. No, it's not "Scary as Hell" or is it "An
Instant Classic" but I still reccomend you see Blair Witch which gets ** 1/2
stars.</P>
