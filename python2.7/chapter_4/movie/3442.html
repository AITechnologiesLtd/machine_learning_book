<P>     Over the past fifteen years, Marlon Brando (ON THE WATERFRONT, LAST
TANGO IN PARIS, THE GODFATHER) has been mostly absent from the screen.
With the exception of a few small parts--some good (A DRY WHITE SEASON,
THE FRESHMAN) and some terrible (CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS: THE DISCOVERY)--
the man once hailed as the greatest American actor has eschewed leading
roles.  Until now, that is.  With DON JUAN DEMARCO, Brando is attempting
something of a minor comeback.</P>
<P>     The title character, a modern day Don Juan (with the Italian last
name of DeMarco), is played by Johnny Depp.  At the age of 21, he claims
to have made love to more than 1500 women.  He has been rejected only
once, by the enchanting and innocent Ana (Geraldine Pailhas), but, as is
so often the case, she was "the only one who really mattered."  So, with
no possibility of a life with his true love, Don Juan decides to kill
himself.  He climbs high atop a billboard and demands that the police
send him the greatest living swordfighter so he can die in a duel.  What
he gets instead is Dr. Jack Mickler (Marlon Brando), a massively-
overweight, near-to-retirement psychiatrist who pretends to be Don
Octavio de Flores and talks Don Juan down from his perch.  Then, at
Woodhaven State Hospital, where the young man is temporarily held, Jack
petitions his boss (Bob Dishy) for the right to supervise the newcomer's
treatment.</P>
<P>     DON JUAN DEMARCO is a lighthearted, frothy fable about romance and
the way a patient's fantasies affect his doctor's reality.  Despite
several astute lines which give the film an intellectual appeal, this is
not an exceptionally deep movie.  The playful, often humorous tone,
coupled with Don Juan's accent, suggests THE PRINCESS BRIDE.
Writer/director Jeremy Leven takes pleasure in clouding the division
between what's real and what isn't, but he never stretches matters to
such an extreme that DON JUAN DEMARCO is reduced to a mindless farce.</P>
<P>     Johnny Depp is appealing as the Latin lover, but the truly meaty
role belongs to Brando.  His Jack Mickler (aka Don Octavio) represents
the audience's anchor as the film shifts between romantic illusion and
clinical reality.  There's nothing overtly original in the character, but
Brando shows he can still give a strong performance.  This is far from
his best work, but he's more than a match for the part, and brings to
Jack a human quality that encourages compassion and empathy.</P>
<P>     DON JUAN DEMARCO has a seductively sensual veneer, but the full
compliment of the title character's sexual conquests lacks the romance of
the low-key relationship between Jack and his wife (Faye Dunaway).  These
two act like they've been married for thirty-two years, and her wonder at
his sudden re-awakening is charmingly unaffected.  There is proof here--
as if any is really needed--that couples don't have to be under thirty
to capture an audience's heart.</P>
<P>     With so much blurring between reality and fantasy, there are bound
to be a few missteps, but Leven keeps these to a minimum, and the film is
mostly a success in its approach to its themes.  Don Juan asks the four
essential questions about existence:  "What is sacred?", "Of what is the
spirit made?", "What is worth living for?", and "What is worth dying
for?"  The proposed answer to all is "love", that singular emotion which
pervades this disarming motion picture.</P>
