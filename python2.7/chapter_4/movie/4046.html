<PRE>                              UNSTRUNG HEROES
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Family tragedy gives a twelve-year-
          old the opportunity to choose between the
          rationality of his father and the weirdness of his
          two unbalanced uncles in a sentimental but muddled
          story.  The first dramatic feature film directed by
          Diane Keaton will strike a responsive chord in
          some, but it actually is not a very good piece of
          story-telling.  Rating: high 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It is a lesson we tend to see a lot in the media.  Road Runner
cartoons tell us that technology does not work.  In STAR TREK we learn
that being logical like Spock can be useful but, it is better to be
emotional.  Data teaches us that being human is the ultimate to whicha
machine can aspire.  LITTLE MAN TATE, directed by Jodie Foster, showed
us that child prodigies turn into twisted monsters who concoct
experiments involving "lasers, sulphuric acid, and butterflies."  Now
another actress-turned-director, Diane Keaton, tells us a story of how
in the face of family tragedy, two uncles, even ones with obvious
mental problems, who are emotional are more comforting than a genius
father who insists on being strictly rational.</P>
<P>     In 1962 Steven Lidz (played by Nathan Watt) is the twelve-year-old
product of a loving but strange family.  His father, Sid (John
Turturro), is an inventor and an eccentric genius constantly involving
the children in fanciful creations that never seem to work out.  The
kids at school claim that Steven's father is an alien from another
planet, an idea that Selma Lidz (Andie MacDowell), Steven's mother,
does not completely discount.  But Sid and Selma are so much in love
that Selma overlooks the outright weirdness of her husband.  She is not
quite so willing to overlook the eccentricities of Sid's two very
strange brothers, Danny (Michael Richards) and Arthur (Maury Chaykin).
One is a super-paranoid; the other is just an adult with the mind of a
child.  In day-to-day family life Sid's cold, atheistic rationality is
made bearable for the children by Selma's warm, loving care and
attention.  But when Selma becomes sick and cannot provide that warmth,
the stress of the household becomes too much for young Steven and he
runs away to live with uncles Danny and Arthur.  There he discovers his
uncles were stranger than he ever realized, but also finds them
lovable.</P>
<P>     Just why the craziness of the uncles is so wonderful or why it
transforms Steven is never explained.  And that is an important
weakness of the film.  The anti-rationality of the film would be onlya
minor irritation, but for the film failing to make a case for its side
yet still smugly declaring victory.</P>
<P>     The acting is really not bad, particularly in the performances of
Turturro and Richards as brothers.  And while both performances seem a
little exaggerated, Keaton does manage to suggest common threads in the
two brothers' manias.  Curiously, the male roles are better drawn and
acted than the one major female role.  MacDowell's character is just a
bit too wonderful in a mistaken attempt to make her sickness a little
more tragic.</P>
<P>     But the big mistake of the film is to make so clear that contact
with the crazy uncles was terrific for young Steven without giving the
viewer much reason to understand why it was so good.  Without filling
in that blank the film has no chance to resonate.  The only conclusion
the viewer can draw is that rationality is a cold dead end.  And that
is a theme we see all too often already.  I give this one a high 0 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
