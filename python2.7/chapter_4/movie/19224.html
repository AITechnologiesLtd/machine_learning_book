<PRE>                             SUMMER OF SAM
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: New York City, the summer 1977, the
          local Son of Sam killings hang over everybody's
          lives in the Italian-American community.  But this
          story is really about popular hairdresser Vinny and
          little his betrayals of his best friend and his
          wife.  The climate of paranoia from the killings
          will only bring out the worst in Vinny.  Spike
          Lee's portrayal of Italian-Americans is just about
          like it has been in films likes like DO THE RIGHT
          THING, in such a big dose it looks a lot like
          racism.  Rating: 5 (0 to 10), high 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Spike Lee co-produces and co-directs this story of a group of
people living in Bedford Stuyvesant section of New York.  The film is
not really about the Son of Sam murders themselves but about the
atmosphere of dread created by the killings.  Central to the story is
Vinny the hairdresser (played by John Leguizamo), his wife Dionna (Mira
Sorvino), and Vinny's boyhood friend Ritchie (Adrien Brody).  Vinny is
flashy and flamboyant, a local favorite in the club disco scene.  Vinny
is living the life of easy sex, illegal drugs, loud music, and too much
drinking.  His wife dotes on him but admits to herself that she somehow
failing to satisfy him and is disappointing him.  Ritchie has affected
a British punk hairstyle and a phony British accent.  Most people in
the neighborhood cannot understand what Ritchie is doing but Vinny
defends his friend.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile the paranoia over the killings is getting to the
neighborhood.  There is a general assumption that the Son of Sam is
someone from the neighborhood and someone they all know.  With the
tacit approval of the police vigilante groups form to try to track down
whoever is doing the killing.  In a witch hunt atmosphere anyone who
seems out of the ordinary, even ball-player Reggie Jackson, can be
suspect.  All the while we see little bits of the Son of Sam himself
living in torment from his personal demons then striking like some
Angel of Death.  He is just tangential to the story but hangs over all
that goes on.</P>
<P>     Spike Lee has structured the film a lot like his DO THE RIGHT
THING.  There is a violent incident toward the end of the film and
virtually every scene is buildup to this moment of violence.  In DO THE
RIGHT THING; however, it was a mystery where the story was going.  In
SUMMER OF SAM it is very obvious what is going to happen and the viewer
is left to wonder only how long it will take and how will it happen.
The answer the second question is "longer than you think."  Until then
you will be putting in a lot of time with some generally unpleasant
people. Lee orchestrates all this with the music of the summer of 1997.
He uses the time-tested but hardly original technique of creating
period feel by just finding out what the popular songs stations were
playing and salting them all over the soundtrack.  Sex in the film is
kept frequent, explicit, but using camera angles so that little
explicit is shown to the audience.</P>
<P>     What is disturbing is that Spike Lee's view of the Italian
Americans in this part of New York is not very deep.  If it is beyond
stereotype, it is not by much.  His portrayal is certainly not very
pleasant or understanding.  Lee has, in the past, accused other
filmmakers of using stereotypes.  But it may well instead be a result
of just the same sort of rushed and poorly observed writing that is
starting to appear in his own work.  In fact there have always been
unflattering portraits of non-blacks that he has not written well and
which do not fall far beyond the stereotypical.  During the film he
complains about a double standards toward blacks, but he himself would
complain if another film had black characters so poorly characterized.</P>
<P>     The paranoiac aspects of the film and a good and sympathetic
performance by Mira Sorvino make this otherwise wandering and
pointlessly over-long film considerably more watchable than it would be
otherwise.  And as with DO THE RIGHT THING we do see a good, credible
build of events that make an unthinkable incident believable.  I give
SUMMER OF SAM a 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high 0 on the -4 to +4
scale.  Gee, a film about the summer of 1977 and not one mention of
STAR WARS.</P>
