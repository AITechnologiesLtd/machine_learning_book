<PRE>                            THE STORY OF US
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Okay, let's get thing straight, right up front.  If you have been
led to believe from the trailers that THE STORY OF US is a romantic
comedy, you are in for a huge shock.  This is a mean, bad, melodramatic
horror story about two bickering people.  There is little comedy to be
had in the entire thing.</P>
<P>     Which is a surprise.  This is the man who brought us the masterful
comedy WHEN HARRY MET SALLY.  And here we are, with people on couches,
talking to the camera about their relationship.  Same premise, right?
Ohhhhhhh noooooo.  THE STORY OF US can be summed up quite simply:  Bruce
Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer *hate* each other.  They spend two hours
yelling, cursing, crying, and pouting.  Then maybe they get back
together.  The end.</P>
<P>     Great film?  Uh, no.  Proof that people like Rob Reiner have too
much power.  When you find yourself spending the whole film trying to
read the wine labels in the scenes, you know you're watching something
that's going to be remembered as one of the worst films of the year.
Even the music is annoying – the same acoustic guitar-based Eric Clapton
song is played at least six times.</P>
<PRE>     This is not an exaggeration.</PRE>
<P>     Aside from a (very) few chuckles, this film is completely without
merit.  It's mean-spirited and just plain offensive.</P>
<P>     As usual, I saw this movie with my wife.  If our marriage can
survive THE STORY OF US, well, it can survive anything.</P>
