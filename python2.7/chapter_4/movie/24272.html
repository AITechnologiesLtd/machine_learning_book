RATING: 6.5 /10 --> So-so</PRE>

<P>I'm gonna be honest with you on this one, folks. I really didn't want to see
this movie! I love the cartoons, don't get me wrong, love both Hanna and
Barbara, but geez-louise, the original FLINTSTONES movie just didn't do a
thing for me. In fact, I barely even remember any of it (probably blocked it
out of my memory), save for the enchanting performance by Halle Berry, and
from what I do remember, it stunk to high heaven. All that to say that this
film was actually pretty okay. That's right people...it didn't suck!!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Based on the popular cartoon series, this film takes a look at the lives of
our favorite Bedrock residents before they got married and had their own TV
show. Fred and Barney just graduating from school and applying for jobs at
the quarry. Wilma and Betty meeting for the first time. We even get to see
where Gazoo and Dino came from. So will love bloom? Will Fred bowl once
again? Stay tuned to find out.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Not bad, not bad at all. Definitely a crowd-pleaser with all the kids
bellowing at my premiere, this film manages to balance a throwaway plot with
some great special effects, a very cool and funny Gazoo and a quick,
colorful pace. Of course, you don't go into a movie like the Flintstones
expecting an Oscar-worthy script, but suspicious curiosity always abounds
whenever I see the names of more than two people on a screenplay (this film
credits four screenwriters). Some jokes work in this film, others don't, but
for me, the only thing that really kept me going was the oh-so cool
production values. I mean, there it is on the big screen, a whole
prehistoric world filled with cool animal gadgets, oversized hamburgers and
martini glasses, and yup...dinosaurs. I don't remember the original film
impressing me as much with its extras (it also tried to tie a story in there
as well...brrrrr), but this movie is chockfull of fun eye-candy, starting
with an excellent representation of Gazoo.</P>
<P>Give this little green bastard his own movie, dammit! He ruled! Having said
that, Gazoo seems to disappear about halfway through this film, coinciding
with the movie's lame attempt at creating some tension between the
characters (note: bring in a "bad guy"), and the manufactured Vegas
story-line could only take you so far. I swore that if I saw one more scene
with Wilma staring wistfully into the night, I would shit myself. Thankfully
for all involved...no soiling took place. Performance-wise, I definitely
appreciated the new casting choices much more than those in the original
(Rosie O'Donnell as babelicious Betty...what were they thinking?!?), with
the Rubbles scoring even higher points for getting their laughs down pat.
And Stephen Baldwin even managed to go the entire film without shooting Nic
Cage down once! Not bad, dude.</P>
<P>In a nutshell, I would say that this film delivers on various fronts
including its authentic and exaggerated look, its nifty special effects
(Dino is darn cute), and its quick pace. Plot-wise, things run pretty thin,
as do some of the jokes, which hit and miss all around the campfire, but
this movie isn't really targeted to lovers of classic cinema or to all those
messy teens sweaty-palmed over GLADIATOR coming out next weekend. This movie
is made by kids...for the kids! Huh?!? Well okay, it wasn't made by kids,
but it will certainly be those very kids who will most likely appreciate the
mindless frivolity of this movie, as well as certain "child-like" adults.
And yes...guilty as charged.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
The bassist of the 80s supergroup "Duran Duran", John Taylor, makes an
appearance in this film as one of the members of Mick Jagged's band. The
character of Mick Jagged is played deliciously by actor Alan Cumming, a man
who also does a great job of portraying the character of Gazoo in this film
as well.
Ironically, two actors in this film were also among the cast of Stanley
Kubrick's final film EYES WIDE SHUT. Bad guy Thomas Gibson, as well as Alan
Cumming, who played the cheeky hotel clerk.
Director Brian Levant is a veteran at the children's movie game. He was also
the man behind the camera of the original FLINTSTONES movie back in 1994, as
well as Arnold's foray into kid's films, JINGLE ALL THE WAY, as well as
BEETHOVEN and PROBLEM CHILD 2.
One of the producers of this film is a gentleman by the name of Steven
Spielberg. I'm not exactly sure what this guy has done before, but people
tell me that he's famous and that he's made a couple of "interesting" movies
himself. Oh well... ;)</P>
