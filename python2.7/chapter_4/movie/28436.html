<PRE>THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Fast cars, scantily clad women, bare-knuckle brawls, and guns, guns,
guns!</P>
<P>What more could be expected from a guilty pleasure-ridden American
popcorn movie like The Fast and the Furious.  Nothing of substance or
intelligence is ever really expected from a summer movie, much less when
that movie bears a title akin to a bad porno flick.  The Fast and the
Furious was exactly how I felt leaving the theater: Hightailing it back
home, furious at how quickly the movie fell apart.  I mean, how the hell
could you screw up something as slam-dunk-awesome as souped-up
performance cars amidst the illegal street racing subculture of the L.A.
Basin?</P>
<P>Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is the main bad-ass dude of L.A.'s illegal
street racing circuit.  He runs a performance car tune-up shop, along
with his colorful team of misfits and mechanical geniuses.  But is he
the guy responsible for the recent hijackings of big-rigs full of
performance car electronics?</P>
<P>Undercover cop Brian Spindler (Paul "Don't call me Keanu" Walker)
saunters to crack the case, showing up in a green Eclipse with enough
nitrous to blow up a city block.  His job is to infiltrate Dominic's
crew and find out who's pulling the hijacking jobs before his
stereotypical commanding officer eats up too much of his screen time. 
During his investigation, Brian is taken under the wing of Dominic and
into the underground world of illegal street racing, where he learns how
to avoid potholes and ignore plot holes.</P>
<P>Coo as Brian falls in love with Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana
Brewster)!  Watch as Brian leaps so gracefully out of the way of
ill-tempered Asian gangs with automatic weapons!  Feel the thrill when
Brian learns how to leave a Ferrari in the dust!  And ultimately, try to
hold back the tears as Brian begins to question his loyalty to the badge
versus the respect and honor of his newfound "racing family."  It's
Point Break all over again.</P>
<P>The first twenty minutes of The Fast and the Furious are a real treat. 
I even thought that hack director Rob Cohen (an old Miami Vice director
who was responsible for such classics as Daylight and The Skulls) could
have pulled this off with sweeping cameras angles and tight, tight
editing.  All Cohen needed to do was keep the action hot and heavy with
racecars flying by, chicks making out in hallways, and fists flying. 
Sadly, the studio wanted a PG-13 rating for the film in order to get the
kiddies in and ultimately homogenizes the movie into a regurgitated
episode from Starsky and Hutch.  A horrendous ending doesn't help.</P>
<P>Even Vin Diesel, a strong actor with great turns in such films as Pitch
Black and Boiler Room, spends half the movie trying to create a
sympathetic character while frantically looking for a way out of the
film.  Which he doesn't find until the credits roll...  See it or don't,
but remember one thing either way: a Honda Civic can't slide under a
big-rig trailer without bodily harm coming to all involved.</P>
