<P>     The helpful sub-title tagged on to THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB is not the
only time you'll be instructed exactly what you're supposed to understand
about the film. Throughout this tale of a group of gay West Hollywood
friends, rookie writer/director Greg Berlanti includes title cards
defining key words and phrases in the characters' lingo. "Meanwhile" is
code to draw attention to an attractive guy nearby; a "newbie" is a
recently-out young man; "gym bunnies" are the muscle-bound hunks desirable
primarily (if not exclusively for sex). It's more than a movie, it's an
anthropology class. Welcome to "Intro to Gay 101."</P>
<P>     THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB clearly has its broken heart in the right
place, but it's too concerned with making statements about its milieu to
let the narrative work organically as a character study. And there are
lots of characters to study in this ensemble dramedy. Dennis (Timothy
Olyphant) is a nice guy trying to make the transition from sex to
relationships. Cole (Dean Cain), Dennis's roommate, is an aspiring actor
who loves 'em and leaves 'em. Howie (Matt McGrath) has trouble admitting
when he loves someone. Patrick (Ben Weber) has trouble loving himself.
Taylor (Billy Porter) is the only one in a long-term relationship, though
perhaps not for much longer. Benji (Zach Braff) looks for a more
party-filled lifestyle. And Jack (John Mahoney) is their collective
father-figure, the older restaurateur whose softball team brings them all
together.</P>
<P>     Those are just the members of the core group of pals, not even
counting Patrick's lesbian sister (Mary McCormack) and her partner (Nia
Long), or the sweet "newbie" (Andrew Keegan) Dennis takes under his wing.
That's a whole heap of humanity to which Berlanti must be attentive, and
he's not quite up to the task. Most of his characters remain types
throughout, particularly the more effeminate Benji and Taylor. Olyphant
(the menacing drug dealer in GO) is surprisingly good as Dennis, the most
fully-developed of the characters, and Cain does a nice job of
under-playing the philandering Cole. The rest of the actors just don't
have enough to work with. In 94 minutes, THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB just can't
support a half-dozen major characters.</P>
<P>     It's a shame, too, because Berlanti actually has an intriguing
concept at the core of his film. Unlike most gay-themed films, this one
isn't about coming out, or dealing with the straight world, or AIDS. It's
a fairly risky statement about the complications when members of a
minority group become so insular that their entire frame of reference
becomes their other-ness. Berlanti's portrays his characters alternately
coping effectively with their lives and dealing with the constant
disappointment of not yet being able to define who they are or what they
want. This is a film that's ready to acknowledge that sometimes gay
men -- even after they've said, "We're here, we're queer" -- haven't quite
gotten used to it.</P>
<P>     An idea, unfortunately, isn't enough to sustain a film. While the
characters struggle to emerge as individuals from Berlanti's broad thesis,
the film struggles to avoid basic miscalculations in structure (case in
point: After one character comments about rumors that a famous actor is
gay, and another character responds, "Just because he's every gay man's
fantasy doesn't mean he's gay," several seconds of idle banter commence
before the cutaway to the famous actor in a clinch with another man).
There is plenty of tart dialogue, and not all of it is of the bitchy-queen
variety. The individual moments of humor and discovery are nice, but they
don't add up to enough. THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB is a movie determined to
teach you something, rather than a movie about people whose experiences
teach you something. A lecture with romance and comedy is still a lecture.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 boys in the bland:  5.</PRE>
