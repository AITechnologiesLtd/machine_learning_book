 It's every parent's nightmare. Your child kidnaps your newborn and
disappears into the woods on a stormy night with his friends. Then the media
descends on your home, anxious for all the details.
 That situation is played for laughs in "The Rugrats Movie," and while it
might also be a nightmare of many parents to have to pay to see Tommy,
Chuckie and Angelica on the big screen, "Rugrats" has more than enough
hijinks and gross-out humor to keep the under-10 crowd in hysterics for 90
minutes.
 Older viewers might catch themselves chuckling as well, especially when
Tommy's pregnant mom insists on checking into the Lipschitz Maternity Arts
Center -- which promises it's "state-of-the-art in primitive birth
alternatives" -- or when an obnoxious tabloid reporter grills grieving
parents with questions like "Is it true a dingo ate your baby?". Certainly
the kids won't pick up on how alternative-rock pioneers like Patti Smith,
Laurie Anderson and Beck provide the vocals for a nursery full of
complaining babies, or catch the easily recognizable tones of Whoopi
Goldberg and David Spade as a pair of forest rangers who assist in rescuing
the Rugrats from the wilderness.
 That's not to say that all of "Rugrats" is sophisticated and in-jokey. Many
of the jokes are built around "chocolate pants" (think diapers) and bodily
functions, the kind of lightly raunchy material that's, in Rugrat parlance,
"more fun than picking noses" to those whose ages are still in the single
digits.
 But, to balance things out slightly, "Rugrats" does offer a gently
delivered message about how older siblings need to overcome feelings of
jealousy and take part in raising a new baby. In this case, Tommy feels he's
lost his place in the Pickles family after the arrival of little brother
Dylan, who seems to exist solely to smack Tommy around and weep rivers of
tears. The only disappointment the target audience for "Rugrats" is likely
to feel comes from the movie's underemployment of bratty cousin Angelica,
who is kept out of the action for most of the movie.
 The feature is preceded by a raucous "Catdog" short, in which the
half-feline/half-canine manages to cause citywide destruction and an
airplane crash while trying to win a call-in radio contest. Its relentless
comic violence and hyperactivity would have made maverick "Golden Age"
animator Tex Avery proud.
