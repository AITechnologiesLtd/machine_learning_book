<P>   As the film opens up, we are shown an agonizing mise-en-scene in
which three brothers and their sister pay their respects to their
recently departed mother. This somber scene barely even sets the tone
for what we are about to see: a wild romp through the night in the lives
of Thomas, John, Michael, and Sheila Flynn, all of whom are separated
after a scuffle in a bar.
   An impressive feature debut by Scottish director Peter Mullan (best
known for a role in Trainspotting), Orphans tells the tale of each
individual character as they try to make their way to their mother's
funeral the next morning. Each character is given distinct
personalities, goals, ambitions, and lives. Thomas (by Gary Lewis) is
the strict catholic that refuses to leave his mother's side. John (by
Stephen Cole) the younger brother, seeking vengeance against the one who
wounded his brother Michael (by Douglas Henshall). Sheila (played by
Rosemary Stevenson) is the disabled sister, who tires of Thomas' vigil
and leaves, only to have her motorized wheelchair break down in the
middle of nowhere. Michael is the `normal' one in the bunch, trying to
reconcile with all the family members and bring them back together for
the next day's funeral.
   While the premise lends itself to an unmarketable state (which led to
its dropping by Film Four studios), each character goes through some
very absurd moments, many breaking past the reaches of dark comedy.
Before leaving in a huff, Sheila causes Thomas to break a statue of
Mary, which he is frantically trying to piece together (his efforts are
eventually rendered moot). On one of his vengeance seeking tirades,
John's friend finds out the hard way why he shouldn't bother a man while
he masturbates (and you thought that the `hair gel' scene in There's
Something About Mary was bad). And then there's the scene where Michael
finds himself in the worst bar in Glasgow.
   Scenes like these effectively break up the somber narrative, although
a Tarantino weaned audience would with to see more of the dark and
comedic stuff. Still, the solid characterization more than makes up for
what audiences otherwise expect. With vivid clarity, this is an amazing
portrayal of a family in obvious turmoil. Michael is slowly bleeding to
death. John is about to make the biggest mistake of his life. Thomas
doesn't even care and just wishes to watch over his mother's body. And
the three of them have no idea where their sister is.
   The film also deals with some heavy religious allegory. As well as
representing various biblical figure (Thomas, as the faith-shaken
apostle; John, possibly the apostle that slices a guard's ear off prior
to Jesus Christ's arrest; Michael as an angel of sorts), there are
interesting metaphors. One such involves vengeance seeking bar patrons
chasing the evil bartender through the streets, with one of them
dropping a large stone as soon as Michael sees this (I'll let you figure
that one out). Things like these only enhance the storytelling.
   With some of the most solid acting that you'll see in a while and a
well written storyline, Orphans is easily one of the best films I've
seen in a long time. While some may lose patience with the buildup, the
payoff is ultimately worth it.</P>
