<P>Admittedly, it gets increasingly difficult to review films that star the   
ebullient Jackie Chan.  One film is just like another.  Fortunately, each   
film is as cutely entertaining as another.  Like all is films, he chops,   
socks, flips and somersaults with the greatest of ease.  His playfulness   
makes him very likable.  You can't help but laugh at the cheesiness of   
the dubbing; you can't help but stare in awe at the wonderfully   
choreographed fight scenes; you can't help but gasp in delight and   
amazement as he performs his own stunts.  In this movie, you get 90   
fun-filled minutes of cheesiness, awe and delight.</P>
<P>This latest Chan vehicle to hit the American landscape is basically a   
take-off of the Raiders of the Lost Ark genre.  Tons of gold, purloined   
by the Nazis during WWII, sits in a secret German base buried in the   
Sahara.  It's up to Jackie to find it.  Now, this is not a really   
creative story.  I mean, even Jackie Chan's character name is…uh…Jackie.   
 But, Chan movies are not meant to have significant depth (or any for   
that matter).  Watch as scenes are seemingly incongruously edited   
together.  Watch mysterious bad guys appear out of nowhere and pop back   
up at the most awkward of moments. This is no masterpiece to be sure.   
 But it is the situations that Jackie finds himself in, and the   
incredibly amusing way in which he gets out that is the hallmark of these   
films.  Jackie is also accompanied on his quest by 3 different women.   
 All are attractive and have a minor purpose for their inclusion, but   
their roles amount to little more than fodder for more comedy and   
silliness.  And, there are the usual odd assortment of bandits, thugs (my   
favorite rarely-used word), nazis and mercenaries that all try to get   
Jackie.  My feeling is that when there are more people in his films, more   
fighting can happen.  After all, that is what we want to see.  That is   
what we've come to expect.  And, smartly, that is exactly what we get.</P>
<P>For those that have never scene the previous Chan releases (Rumble in the   
Bronx, Supercop, or First Strike), this is a unique movie-going   
experience, mainly because Chan is so different than the Van Dammes,   
Bruce Lees or Steven Segals.  Chan can fight with the best of them (if   
not better), but he wants you to laugh at him and with him too.  Like all   
of his other movies, Jackie is a 3-ring circus of entertainment.  In one   
ring, we can enjoy his boyish charm.  In another ring, we can see him at   
the center of some amazing action-sequences and martial arts encounter.   
 And in the 3rd ring, we can enjoy the humor that he injects to brighten   
anybody's spirit.  Chan is a trapeze artist, lion tamer and clown rolled   
into one.  In this case, Chan and his film can be enjoyed by ladies and   
gentlemen and children of all ages.</P>
