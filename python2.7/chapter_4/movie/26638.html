<PRE>                      BOOK OF SHADOWS: BLAIR WITCH 2
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     The cinematic event of 1999 desperately wants you to make it the
cinematic event of 2000, as the (first) sequel to The Blair Witch
Project is rushed into theaters just in time for Halloween.  Alas, it's
not to be, and soon the original will become regarded as a one-hit
wonder and a footnote in the annals of independent film.</P>
<P>     Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 is clearly Made In Hollywood, but
it's still trying to pretend to be a documentary.  The story this time? 
In Book of Shadows, the original Blair Witch was "just a movie," but
this time it's for real -- this is what happened after all those
tourists descended upon Burkittsville, MD, believing the woods to be
genuinely haunted.</P>
<P>     Of course, as the film points out, that was all phony.  Um, but now
the woods really are haunted.  So the original wasn't phony after all. 
I think.  Uh-huh.  Who's going to buy it this time?</P>
<P>     Book of Shadows is so self-referential, The Blair Witch Project is
invoked at least once every five minutes.  The film even opens with a
montage of news clips and movie reviews (Hello, Ebert!) all talking
about that Blair Witch phenomenon.  You know, in case you hadn't heard
about it.</P>
<P>     All of this would be forgivable if the sequel was any good.  All
the fuss turns out to be for naught, a vain attempt at making a
Hollywood snuff film full of disjointed fright gags.  Book of Shadows
has the same nauseating camerawork as the original and takes place in a
forest, but that's where the similarities end.</P>
<P>     This time around, half-crazed Blair Witch fans decide to venture
into the Black Hills in search of the truth behind the legend.  Within
hours, it turns out the "myth" of the Blair Witch is anything but, and
our unlikely heroes (including a once-psychotic tour guide, a Goth
chick, a self-professed Wiccan, and a book-writing couple) find
themselves waking up in their now-trashed camp with no memory of the
last several hours.  Then it's back to the tour guide's house (a spooky,
converted factory deep in the woods, natch) as the quintet tries to
figure out what happened to the missing time.  And then the body count
clock starts to tick.</P>
<P>     I wasn't a rabid fanatic of the original Witch, but at least the
original had a consistent mythology that, despite being cryptic, was
relatively sensical.  Book of Shadows is all over the map and completely
random, jumping from scene to scene (as well as forward and backward in
time) without much care for structure or logic.  Frankly, the film just
doesn't make a lot of sense, and it's not compelling enough to make it
worth the effort to try and figure out.</P>
<P>     Much of the blame should fall in the lap of director Joe Berlinger,
best known for his fabulous (and real) documentaries, Brother's Keeper
and Paradise Lost, who is way out of his element in this world of MTV
jump cuts and a throbbing heavy metal soundtrack.  The cliché-driven
characters aren't much help, either, but fundamentally you have to
expect that this is just what happens when Hollywood tries to glom on to
an indie phenomenon (see also She's the One attempt at rekindling The
Brothers McMullen).</P>
<P>     Of course, the biggest question most are wondering about is, Is it
scary?  No.  It's creepy, but the spine-tingling power of the final
scene of Blair Witch is nowhere to be found here.</P>
<P>     And as for this titular "Book of Shadows," that's one little detail
that seems to have been excised from the film altogether.  I guess we're
just going to have to wait for Blair Witch 3 to figure that out.</P>
<PRE>     God help us.</PRE>
