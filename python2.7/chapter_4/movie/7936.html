<PRE>                                    KINGPIN
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>** (out of 4 = fair)
1996, PG-13, 113 minutes [1 hour, 53 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Woody Harrelson (Roy Munson), Randy Quaid (Ishmael Boorg), Vanessa
Angel (Claudia), Bill Murray (Ernie McCracken), produced by Brad Krevoy,
Steve Stabler, Bradley Thomas, written by Barney Fanaro, Mort Nathan,
directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly.</P>
<P>"Kingpin" tries to cash in on the elements that worked in the Farrelly
brothers' first film, "Dumb And Dumber," this time with the generic sports
plot (the underdog versus the champion), and it doesn't work because it goes
overboard. The film focuses too much on plot rather than on jokes, and the
jokes we get are in questionable taste.</P>
<P>There isn't much to a comedy like this, it recycles every comedy formula: 1)
the underdog versus the world, 2) the idiots in the real world, 3) the
bombshell, 4) the road trip, 5) the monetary deadline, 6) and the villain.</P>
<P>The film stars Woody Harrelson as Roy Munson, a young bowler from Iowa who
attempts to make a career out of hussling bowlers along with the man whom he
narrowly defeated, Ernie McCracken (Murray). A lot of cartoony jokes and
storylines start to form, such as Munson being too stupid to notice what is
going on around him, and Ernie as the typical, wise-cracking antagonist. When
Ernie leaves Roy to a mob of angry gamblers, Roy finds himself deprived of
his bowling hand and of course his life is shattered. </P>
<P>Fast forward to the present day as Roy is doing whatever he can to make ends
meet, even going so far as to sleep with his absolutely disgusting landlady
to avoid rent payment. Here the tone of the movie is set - we're going to get
a lot of poo-poo jokes that are original, but disgusting at the same time.
You laugh but you feel guilty afterward. </P>
<P>One day Roy meets an Amish man named Ishmael (Quaid), who is the talented
prodigy with great potential, if only he'd let Roy coach him. And so Roy and
Ish start their cross-country journey from Pennsylvania to Reno to the
million dollar bowling tournament, because "the bank" has threatened to
foreclose on the Amish if they can not come up with $500,000. </P>
<P>>From here on the story goes through the motions and only exists to make for
jokes - some funny, others not, which wouldn't be so bad if the pacing was a
little faster. We get many jokes about both male and female genitalia,
typical cartoony slapstick, and one-liners, but they are all pretty much
connected by the fish-out-of-water story. The jokes start to get a little too
lowbrow, relying on locker room humor and male fantasy jokes.</P>
<P>Guess how "Kingpin" ends? Actually, one element to it is surprising, but the
rest is pretty standard. Yes, this movie does yield some big laughs, but not
all big laughs. It concentrates too much on plot and comedy suffers. </P>
