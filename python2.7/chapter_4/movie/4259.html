<PRE>                             THE DOOM GENERATION
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Good Lord, how did this film ever get made?  As Gregg Araki's fifth
feature, you'd figure he'd have learned *something* about movie making by
now.  Looks like I'm wrong again.</P>
<P>     THE DOOM GENERATION, hands-down one of the most horrid examples of
filmmaking I've seen in ages, is a brain-dead, post-modern love story. 
The plot (what there is of it) tells the moronic tale of Amy Blue (Rose
McGowan), her boyfriend Jordan White (James Duval), and some guy they pick
up called Xavier Red (Johnathon Schaech).  (Did you catch on to that
ultra-clever color motif?)  Altogether, these three embark on a
nonsensical spree of sex, killing/mangling people, and then eating...and
then repeating the cycle four or five times.</P>
<P>     Along the way, Amy uses a wider variety of vulgar insults than I'd
ever conceived of.  Jordan pretty much just stands around, with Duval
perfectly cast in the part of an idiot zombie teenager that makes you
cringe just to look at him.  I still can't figure out what Xavier's role
was supposed to be all about, but I'm guessing Araki's "666," skull &
crossbones, and Apocalypse references are supposed to indicate that
Xavier's the devil.  Oooooh, scary.  If that was supposed to be a social
or cultural statement, please pinch me.</P>
<P>     Araki should, however, be thanked for the one distraction that keeps
you from having to think too hard about the garbage on the screen:  cameos
galore!  From Margaret Cho to ex-Brady Buncher Christopher Knight to
Married With Children's Amanda Bearse to Hollywood Madam Heidi Fleiss,
there's enough washed-up stars and wannabes to dam a river with.  It's
cute, but I think Jon Waters squeezed the last ounce of life out of this
stunt years ago.</P>
<P>     I could go on about the poor or inappropriate lighting, cutesy
direction, horrid dialogue, and overall silly atmosphere this film
creates, but why bother?  I think I've pretty much made my opinion clear
by now.  There's absolutely no reason to see the movie, and I'd rather
watch the Weather Channel for two hours than sit through it again.</P>
