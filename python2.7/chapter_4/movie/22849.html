Written and Directed by David Cronenberg</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: 7/10</PRE>
<P>David Cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his
impressively twisted head. It is one of many science fiction films, released
during the last year of this millenium, that tackles issues that will play
an important role in our future.</P>
<P>The story unfolds in a near future, where the line between reality and
virtual reality blurs. The world of the future is an unfriendly place, where
the scared inhabitants are "hiding" in virtual reality fantasy games to
escape the uncertainty of the real world. Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason
Leigh), the leading game designer in the world, is testing her new virtual
reality game, eXistenZ with a focus group. As they begin, she is attacked by
a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun. She flees with a young
marketing trainee, Ted Pikul (Jude Law), who is suddenly assigned as her
bodyguard. Unfortunately, her pod, an organic gaming device that contains
the only copy of the eXistenZ game program, is damaged. To inspect it, she
talks Ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game
with her. The events leading up to this, and the resulting game lead the
pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn't exist, as
the "players" are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot. Here
the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their
own or the game's perspective.
I don't intend to reveal more of the film's premise, which is structured as
a computer game, with "tasks" that the characters must complete to win the
game.</P>
<P>Released after "The Matrix" and "Dark City", "eXistenZ" has some
similarities and parallels that connect it to these films. However,
"eXistenZ" is moving in a different direction, with a premise of its own. A
combination of dazzling special effects, brilliantly coordinated action
sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot, made "The Matrix" a
rare and entertaining science fiction experience, with some dark and
frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade. "eXistenZ" has a
completely different atmosphere, resembling "Dark City" , which is darker,
more serious and less entertaining. "eXistenZ" has the opportunities and
potential, but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored.</P>
<P>After the engaging beginning, it starts to falter.  While I was watching the
film, many left the theatre during the first hour. And indeed, "eXistenZ"
seemed as a complete failure: the actors seemed unreal, the plot and
dialogue silly, unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one
after another. But the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete
different level, explaining all past events, the silly dialogue and the
unreal performances within a few scenes. And jet the film fails on several
issues. Probably the best written character in the story is a game designer,
who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world, than face
real life. This is a great possibility to create a magnificent character,
and Jennifer Jason Leigh stretches Cronenberg's script to the limits, but
fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real
world are never shown. eXistenZ is not a world of which you might dream
about in your fantasies. It is not a world worth sacrificing your life for.
It's a cold, dark place where the "players" are forced to interrelate with
unreal characters, eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own
will. It doesn't look like a place worth even thinking about.
David Cronenberg has been the creator of "The Fly", "Videodrome" and "The
Dead Zone" , so it's not so hard to guess that "eXistenZ" is a violent and
gory film. Besides the regular murders of innocent people, the audiences can
enjoy an autopsy of a two-headed mutated amfibium. Scenes like that have
become a trademark for Cronenberg and it seems that he can't make a film
without flowing blood and foul creatures. The way I see it, this is the
film's crucial failure. It is impossible for Cronenbergto create a beautiful
world where time, space and problems of our everyday life do not exist; a
place of blooming blossoms, green forests and clear waters; a place really
worth sacrificing your life for. Because of its lack of three
dimensionality, the film looses most of its possibilities, but stays afloat
because of some interesting scenes, amusing performances (especially by
Willem Dafoe ) and one interesting and important thought, depicted in many
different ways throughout the movie. During the film, the audience is as
confused as the characters: detached from their everyday existence and no
longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative
reality that they have created.</P>
<P>"The Matrix", despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts, ends with a
light at the end of the tunnel. "eXistenZ" does not. It is a one time
experience, ending in blood, gore and madness - a rather frightening
forecast for tomorrow.</P>
