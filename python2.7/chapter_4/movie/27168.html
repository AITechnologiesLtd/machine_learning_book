Susan Granger's review of "POLLOCK" (Sony Pictures Classics)</PRE>
<P>     Actor/director Ed Harris's wrenching study of Jackson
Pollock, one of the greatest American painters of the 20th century,
reveals him as a complex, pathological alcoholic. In the late 1940s,
Pollock thrust "splatter" abstractionism into modern art and then
drank himself into misery, finally perishing in a car wreck. During
his rise to fame and fortune, the notoriously self-promoting, yet
inwardly self-doubting, Pollock met up with feisty, tough-talking
fellow painter Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden) when he was living in
Greenwich Village and, together, they moved to rural Long
Island. Their domestic arrangement was far from tranquil and,
eventually, Pollock acquired a younger trophy, Ruth Kligman (Jennifer
Connelly), while Krasner emerges as a bitter, enabling wife.  From his
lying on the grass staring at the sky and clamming in East Hampton to
his precise methodology of drip-painting canvases and his drunken
revels at Jungle Pete's, the watering hole near his home - Pollock's
abusive, mercurial life is up there on the screen. The weakness is in
the simplistic, sequential screenplay with its cliche-ridden
exposition and dialogue, along with its lack of character insight, by
Barbara Turner and Susan J. Emshwiller. Val Kilmer lends support as
rival artist Willem de Kooning, as does Amy Madigan (the real-life
wife of Harris) as idiosyncratic heiress Peggy Guggenheim, with Bud
Cort as her art scout, and Jeffrey Tambour as art critic Clement
Greenberg. Kudos to cinematographer Liza Rinzler, production designer
Mark Friedberg and costumer David Robinson for the evocation of the
'40s-'50s era. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Pollock" is a
stylish 7, distinguished by Oscar-caliber performances by Ed Harris,
Marcia Gay Harden and Amy Madigan.</P>
