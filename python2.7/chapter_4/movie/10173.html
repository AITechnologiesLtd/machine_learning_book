<PRE>                           Addicted to love</PRE>
<PRE>                           A Griffin Dunne Movie
  With Meg Ryan, Matthew Broderick, Kelly Preston, Tchéky Karyo </PRE>
<P>The astronomer Sam (Broderick) and the teacher Linda (Preston) , a
blonde angel, are the perfect American small town couple. He watches
the stars and everyday at noon his love in a nearby park. He could go
on like this forever. She escapes to New York City.</P>
<P>Sam goes after her and discovers that meanwhile she is living with
Frenchman Anton (Karyo). So he moves into an abandoned house across
the street and waits for her to come back.</P>
<P>Then Antons crazy ex-fiancée Maggie (Ryan) moves in with him. Her
intentions aren't quite as innocent as his. She wants to vaporize her
ex.
To seperate the faithless lovers is only the first step. Anton has to
suffer much more. He looses his restaurant, his furniture is
reposessed and finally he is disfigured by the effects of a strawberry
allergy.</P>
<P>Of course the story ends well, mainly because Sam is so incredibly
GOOD.
But before we get there we can have a few hearty laughs.</P>
<P>I don't know what I like best: the wild couple Ryan/Broderick or the
idea to use the Camera Obscura.</P>
<P>Teddy bear Broderick collides with hard drinking leather wearing biker
girl Ryan.
Both are excellent. You buy both the funny and the more serious parts
of their roles.</P>
<P>They make the other couple fade out. Especially Linda. She is blonde
and sweet. Besides we owe her two zany appearances of her father who
alway has to deliver the 'Dear John'-letters to her ex-lovers.</P>
<P>Anton is the cliché Frenchman. In the end you almost sympathize with
him, when even his furniture is taken away, his skin itches and he
breaks both his arms. But not quite.</P>
<P>The Camera Obscura Sam uses to bring Linda's picture into his run-down
apartment provides us with beautiful images. One scene where Maggie
and Sam sit on the couch with a bag of potatoe chips and watch their
exes like a TV program reminded me of "When Harry met Sally".</P>
<P>I have to mention the set design. Everything is perfect: Ryans
outfits, the abandoned house and especially the collage Maggie makes
in the course of the movie.</P>
<P>One thing I did not like was the timid attempt to justify Maggie's
revenge.
It didn't fit into the comedy and wasn't pursued consequently enough
to lend some depth to the story.</P>
