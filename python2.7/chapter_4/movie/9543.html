<PRE>THE SHINING (1980)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Stanley Kubrick
Writers: Diane Johnson and Stanley Kubrick (from the book by Stephen
King)
Starring: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scatman Crothers</P>
<P>"The Shining" is a tough film to review.  On the surface, it's a
faithless adaptation of the novel, but still tells a really creepy story
that makes almost no sense.  Cinematically, the film is deep with
meaning(s), and creates total atmosphere, creating a sense of dread in
the viewers.  Despite the very, very, very low body count in the film,
this film is one of the scariest films I've ever seen.  And I'm not
easily scared.</P>
<P>You probably know the story about writer Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson)
who accepts a job of looking over a mountain top hotel called the
Overlook in its four-month down-period as the snow storms block the only
road to the hotel.  While there with his wife and son (Shelley Duvall
and Danny Lloyd, respectively and obviously), he gradually loses any
sanity he once had, and even begins talking with ghosts.  At the end, he
chases his family around the giant hotel, wielding an axe (a mallet in
the book), and screaming out one-liners.</P>
<P>In the both the book and the movie, the son, Danny, is a bit psychic,
possessing a little affliction called "Shining," which allows him to
perceive some of the past, and talk through brain waves with other
people who have the shining.  He meets the cook (Scatman Crothers) of
the hotel who also has it, and who warns him of some kind of old psychic
power the hotel has.  But Danny is too young to totally comprehend it,
and he watches as his father's sanity decreases.</P>
<P>In the book, the hotel's ghosts had power over Jack and were trying to
silence Danny throughout the story.  In the end, Jack was under the
power of the hotel, instead of really being totally insane.  Stanley
Kubrick, who is, in my humble opinion, more interesting than Stephen
King, didn't like that idea, and decided to make another film with his
theory of violence being a part of every human being.  He uses some of
the stories in the book about Jack, particularly the one where he
accidentally broke his son's arm.  And when he gets to the hotel, he
suddenly goes insane, but not totally until near the ending.  The
reason?  Well, the final frame explains that, although it really doesn't
make a whole lot of sense.</P>
<P>Kubrick is never a director to easily comprehend, and "The Shining" is
one confusing flick.  One viewing is not enough to make sense of all the
bizarre sequences, and one explanation cannot cover all the things that
occur.  Is Jack merely hallucinating these people (each time he's
talking to a ghost, he's facing a mirror), or are they really there?
Did Danny really bring it out of Jack, since he brought it out in him
when he accidentally broke his arm?  Is this a satire of violence, and
even TV (there are quotes from TV throughout - i.e. "Heeeeere's
JOHNNY!")?  Or is it even a film about the murders of the native
americans slain on the very site of the hotel?</P>
<P>I have no clue what this film means, but someday I hope to figure it
out.  But even if the film makes no real sense, there's the sense of
depth to everything that goes on.  And, of course, there's the
direction.</P>
<P>Stanley Kubrick has made one of the truly horrific films ever made.  I
mean, this film is actually frightening.  There are moments where I was
scared to breathe, as scared as some of the people in this film.
Kubrick paints dread over everything that goes on, even the childish bit
of Danny riding his little mini-three-wheeler around the hotel.  And
there aren't any scenes where someone just jumps out of nowhere like in
a slasher film.  When Jack is chopping down the bathroom door where
Duvall is hiding, Kubrick shoots it head on.  When Jack jumps out of
nowhere to attack someone, we see him way before it happens.</P>
<P>Last year's mini-series with Steven Weber and Rebecca DeMournay (!!!)
went by the book, but lacked any of the depth and creepiness this film
mastered.  It also lacked any of the fun acting that this film
posesses.  Jack Nicholson's twisted performance is, yes, more campy than
Guy Pearce in "Priscilla."  But it's one of the more darkly comic and
creepy ones in horror history.  He starts off as kind of reserved and
maybe a little twisted, but by the end is drooling and howling like a
dog.</P>
<P>Duvall, who I think was nominated for a highly coveted Razzie award for
her performance, is pretty annoying.  But I think it works with this
film.  I mean, he's supposed to want to kill her, right?  Okay, so I'm
kidding.  She's annoying.  Danny Lloyd, who never did another film I
think (what a shock, I mean, he was a child actor!), is pretty good as
the quiet son (much better than that annoying buck toothed kid in the
mini-series).  And Scatman Crothers...well, he's the man, and we all
know it.</P>
<P>The major complaint of this film, other than it just doesn't make any
sense, is that it's not faithful to the book.  Now, I've read the book,
seen this movie, and even watched all 6 hours of that horrible
mini-series (that kid was annoying as hell, wasn't he?), and this was
the best of all of them.  The book is good and all, but the ending just
didn't live up to the rest of the story.  And the mini-series didn't
help.  Playing like a basic outline of the book, it created zero
suspense, hokey scenes, and even tried to revert to cheap thrills along
the way.  I like how the movie never pulls its punches.  Jack has gone
insane, and there's no way he's going to go back just because his son
starts crying.  It's popular knowledge that the book is ALWAYS better
than the movie adaptation (not the other way around though), but this
film disproves that.  While Stephen King is a very good writer, Stanley
Kubrick's just a better director in this little analogy of mine.</P>
<P>Kubrick's adaption and direction might diss the book, but I think it
works better the way he did it.  It's one of the few times the film was
better than the book.  Yes, the book fills in a lot of the gaps in the
film (well, in the first half).  But it's creepier to watch it this
way.  Don't tell me you weren't shaking when he walked into the
off-limits room and that chick was in the bath tub.  Don't tell me you
weren't breathing shallow when Jack talks to the ghost of the father who
killed his family before.  This is a film that may make no sense the
first 100 viewings, but it's so well done and so absolutely scary that
it works.</P>
