<P>ME MYSELF I (M).  
(Gaumont/Buena Vista International)
Director: Pip Karmel
Stars: Rachel Griffiths, David Roberts, Sandy Winton, Yael Stone, Shaun 
Loseby, Trent Sullivan, Rebecca Frith, Felix Williamson, Ann Burbrook
Running time: 104 minutes. </P>
<P>Something of an Australian variation on films such as Sliding
Doors and If Only, Me Myself I tackles themes of destiny and having a
second chance of living your life over to rectify, or come to terms
with, past mistakes.</P>
<P>Fiercely independent, single and a successful journalist on
the wrong side of thirty, Pamela Drury (Rachel Griffiths) is starting
to suffer from a mid-life crisis.  She is suddenly plagued with a
sense of regret, doubts and dissatisfaction at her life.  She begins
to wonder if her life would have been different if she had married
Robert, her childhood sweetheart, thirteen years ago.  Has she missed
out on something by remaining single while all her friends are getting
married?</P>
<P>Then a mysterious accident enables Pamela to interact with the
parallel version of herself, and they temporarily swap roles.  Without
warning, Pamela is plunged into the routine of domestic duties with
husband Robert (David Roberts), who has grown distant and is occupied
with his business dealings.  She also finds her hands full coping with
the demands of three young children - Stacy (Yael Stone), on the verge
of adolescence and in need of some understanding and sympathy from her
mother; the sullen, surly and rude Douglas (Shaun Loseby); and Rupert
(a cute and scene stealing tyke played by Trent Sullivan), who is in
the throes of toilet training.</P>
<P>At first, Pamela has difficulty coping with her new life, but
eventually she musters all the strength that has marked her life as a
single woman and journalist and begins to pull this dysfunctional
family back together.</P>
<P>Taking its cues from Joan Armatrading's 1970's anthem to
independence, Me Myself I is an exploration of life, love,
relationships and life style choices in the '90's with a decidedly
feminist bent.  It is surprisingly even handed in its treatment of the
contrasts between a single, solitary life and marriage, motherhood and
domestic "bliss."  Some of its observations are truthful and honest.
Many of its ideas about regret, lost opportunities, and making the
most of your life will resonate with anyone in the audience over
thirty.  However, the film is also full of warmth and humour.</P>
<P>Me Myself I is the first feature film from Pip Karmel, a short
film maker best known for her award winning work as editor on Shine.
The film is an extension of an idea explored in one of her short
films, and is entertaining enough, although it seems to lack spark.
Karmel handles the material confidently enough, although the script at
times becomes a little too earnest in its approach and lacks the
breezy quality of many romantic comedies.</P>
<P>Griffiths is, as usual, excellent, and her wonderful presence
holds the film together.  Griffiths admits that her performance here
was largely inspired by Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts,
although she lacks their light touch and laid back style.  She has the
range to capture Pamela's emotional journey, but she also possesses a
great sense of comic timing that enables her to play the more physical
aspects of the film without embarrassment.  Roberts is also solid as
her husband, who is trying to deal with his own problems, while
newcomer Sandy Winton has an appealing presence as Ben, for whom
Pamela develops a strong attraction.</P>
<P>But ultimately Me Myself I is visiting familiar territory, and 
has little that is new or fresh to offer.</P>
