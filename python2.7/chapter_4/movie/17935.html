<P>"Pushing Tin" is air traffic controllers' slang for getting planes in
line for landing. That's the responsibility of Nick Falzone (John
Cusack), one of the sharpest controllers at New York's Terminal Radar
Approach Control center. Blessed with a lightning-fast mouth and mind,
he's become known as "The Zone" for his ability to sort out potential
problems in the sky before they happen.</P>
<P>What he's not so hot at doing is sorting out his own emotions,
particularly after the enigmatic Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton,
with a slimmer than usual physique and newly acquired hair) joins the
TRACON team and almost instantly arouses Nick's suspicions.  "Pushing
Tin," an agreeably twisted comedy-drama from the gifted British
director Mike Newell ("Four Weddings and a Funeral," "Donnie Brasco"),
tracks the slow unravelling of Nick's mind and his marriage as he
becomes obsessed with Russell and his comely young wife Mary (Angelina
Jolie), who guzzles vodka by the bucketful to deal with the stress in
her home.</P>
<P>Controllers' wives, we learn, refer to themselves as "firsts,"
"seconds," etc., a telling sign of the failure rate of most
controllers' relationships. The screenplay by Glen Charles and Les
Charles offers many such observations, and it's no surprise to find it
was based on a New York Times Sunday Magazine feature that
investigated the pressure-cooker world of guys like Nick and
Russell. But rather than playing the subject matter for high drama,
"Tin" finds a certain sardonic humor in the paradox of men and women
who can't cope with their own problems, yet take the lives of
thousands of travelers into their hands daily. We're told an air
traffic controller saves more lives in one shift than a surgeon does
in an entire career. "Tin" is also very much in the same school as
other Cusack comedies, such as "Grosse Pointe Blank" and "Say
Anything," movies that didn't break any box office records when they
were originally released, but have built up fervent followings in the
years since. This stage-trained actor generally has uncommonly good
taste in material, as well as an impressive capacity for playing
seemingly normal guys who have to deal with issues much bigger than
themselves. Nick may be only a breath away from flat-out nuttiness,
but Cusack obviously likes him nonetheless, and gives him a largely
sympathetic reading. Subtlety and nuance are the keys to Thornton's
performance as well, which keeps us guessing as to the true nature of
Russell's personality. In the potentially tricky role of Nick's wife
Connie, the luminous Cate Blanchett adopts a dead-on Long Island
accent while avoiding turning the woman into a caricature. Jolie's
abrasive/pathetic Mary - who growls "I'm too sober for this" when Nick
tries to engage her in conversation - is also colorful and funny.</P>
