<P>Capsule Review:
    After a brief and somewhat disconcerting flirtation with the =
conventional, FARGO creators and supreme weisenheimers Joel & Ethan Coen =
have returned to the fringe big time with this, their loosest film to =
date. A radically disheveled Jeff Bridges headlines as the titular Dude, =
a hazy bowling obsessed slacker who gets reluctantly drawn into the =
Coens' favorite plot device - a haywire kidnapping scheme. It's a =
tantalizing setup - THE BIG SLEEP with Jeff Spicoli instead of Philip =
Marlowe - but the film never really builds on it, preferring instead to =
dance around the edges and introduce as many wacky characters (including =
ace performances by Coen mainstays John Goodman, John Turturro, and an =
underutilized Steve Buscemi) and absurd situations as it possibly can.
    Although there are plenty of laughs to be had, what ultimately makes =
this film feel like a minor effort is the lack of the tightly coiled =
(albeit noticeably bent) internal logic that governed the duo's previous =
efforts and which made even the goofiest scenes seem connected with the =
narrative as a whole; this is the first of their movies that feels like =
it was pretty much being made up as it went along.
    While longtime fans will find much to savor amid the mess =
(particularly Goodman's superb performance and an awesomely gonzo =
musical dance sequence), LEBOWSKI isn't likely to satisfy the mainstream =
audience that jumped aboard the bandwagon with FARGO - and that just =
might be the Coens' biggest and best joke of all.=20</P>
