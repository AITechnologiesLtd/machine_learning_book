<PRE>                             THE FISHER KING
                      A film review by Ken Johnson
                       Copyright 1991 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>140 min, R, Drama, 1991
Director: Terry Gilliam
Cast: Robin Williams, Jeff Bridges, Amanda Plummer, Mercedes Ruehl,
      Michael Jeter</PRE>
<P>      Normally I would put a brief summary of the film here but the only
way I could do that would spoil THE FISHER KING so I decided to skip the
summary.   Most people have already seen this film but I wanted to put
in my opinion anyway.</P>
<P>      THE FISHER KING is rated R for explicit language, adult
situations, and one very small scene of graphic violence.  I give the
film a four on a zero to five scale.  I highly recommend seeing the film
for it is very well done and enjoyable.  Although the film looks like it
runs for a long time it doesn't seem that long when you're actually
watching it.</P>
<P>      The reason I went to see this film is because it stars Robin
Williams, and I am a fan of Robin Williams' work.  The film I saw was
quite different than what I had expected from the ads.  I was expecting
a retelling of the Fisher King and the holy grail story.  The movie is
not really a retelling of the Fisher King story.  It is however a really
good film that is definitely worth watching at full price.</P>
<P>      Robin Williams puts in one of his best roles yet.  His best role
in my opinion was in DEAD POETS SOCIETY.  His character in THE FISHER
KING is quite believable.  Williams thinks that he is a knight in a
quest to find the holy grail.  Williams is able to put humor into this
character without ruining the dramatic part of this film.  At some
points in the film I felt myself wanting to get up and cheer for Robin
Williams while other times I felt bad for him.  </P>
<P>      Jeff Bridges also puts in a great performance.  Bridges finds out
about Robin Williams and his quest.  Because of a past event Bridges
feels badly for Williams and tries to make himself Williams protector.
This puts a lot of strain on Williams and his girlfriend Ruehl.  Jeff
Bridges really brings his character to life and, like Robin Williams,
really made me feel for his character.</P>
<P>      Director Terry Gilliam has done MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL,
which was a very good comedy about the quests for the holy grail, and
BRAZIL, a science fiction film that I thought was horrible.  He has also
done a couple of other films that I have not seen, both comedies.  He is
an actor in the MONTY PYTHON films too.  I don't think that Gilliam has
ever done a dramatic film before this one and I feel that THE FISHER
KING was a very good start.</P>
