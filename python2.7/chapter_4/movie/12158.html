<PRE>SLIDING DOORS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     SLIDING DOORS takes a what-if look at romance.  What are those tiny
changes that could have had an immense impact on your love life?  Who is
that special someone that you could have met but didn't because you
entered a crowded room a minute too late or too early?  And that tragic
time you found your lover in someone's arms, what if you had come home
just a bit later and missed seeing them together?  This is the promising
premise of SLIDING DOORS.</P>
<P>     When a little girl walks in front of Helen, played fetchingly but
not very convincingly by Gwyneth Paltrow, she just misses her subway
train.  The picture then backs up time so that Helen just manages to
slip through the train's sliding doors.  This plot device sets up two
parallel universes in which all of the story's characters exist.</P>
<P>     In one, Helen walks in on her boyfriend, Gerry, played with his
usual doleful eyes by John Lynch from CAL, who is in bed with his old
girl friend Lydia.  Jeanne Tripplehorn, who was the sexier of the two
female leads in BASIC INSTINCT, plays Lydia.  For those hoping to see
Tripplehorn recreate some of the animal passion she demonstrated in
BASIC INSTINCT, you'll be sorry to know that she doesn't.  Her scenes
are the standard ones, in which she's quickly caught and then promptly
jumps out of bed.  Helen goes on to meet and fall for a married man
named James (John Hannah).  James is as gregariously happy as Gerry is
inertly melancholy.</P>
<P>     In another scenario, Helen comes home just after Lydia has left.
She does, however, begin to get suspicious when certain clues to Gerry's
affair begin to turn up.</P>
<P>     First-time writer and director Peter Howitt uses a bag of old
cliches to tell his story.  A typically cliched scene that rings false
is the one in which Gerry gives his full and complete confession to
Helen.  She manages to fall completely asleep just as his admission of
guilt begins.  In another, set after she becomes pregnant, he hangs up
on her just as she's about to tell him the big news.</P>
<P>     The slowly paced movie switches back and forth between the two
scenarios without managing to make either compelling.  Rarely effective
as a comedy or a romance, the film finally finds its footing towards the
end when it dips into pathos.</P>
<P>     With its light-hearted spirit, SLIDING DOORS would be a hard film
to dislike.  On the other hand, if you want more than Paltrow's
enchanting smile, you would be advised to look elsewhere.</P>
<P>     SLIDING DOORS runs 1:45 but feels longer.  It is rated R for sex
and mild profanity and would be fine for most teenagers.</P>
