<P>It might seem like a potential Oscar contender, especially when compared to
the rest of the slop released so far this year, but Blow just doesn't
measure up to the similarly themed Traffic, or the sweeping scope of Boogie
Nights, which also featured a male character's evolution from a naïve boy
into a cynical adult.  Instead of presenting a fictional Dirk Diggler, Blow
is the true story of George Jung, who became Columbian drug lord Pablo
Escobar's main U.S. cocaine distributor.</P>
<P>Blow's slick opening credits show the journey cocaine takes from the fields
of Columbia into Johnny Depp's nose.  Depp (Chocolat) plays George and
narrates the film as his character, who tells us the story of his life from
a federal penitentiary.  We begin with George's childhood outside Boston,
where his mother (Rachel Griffiths, Blow Dry) constantly runs away from home
and his dad (Ray Liotta, Heartbreakers) has some pretty serious money
problems, which we're led to believe is the motivation for George's career
choices.</P>
<P>When he's old enough, George moves to Cali with buddy Tuna (Ethan Suplee,
Remember the Titans) and starts selling pot he scores from SoCal's
burgeoning supplier Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens, Mystery Men).  Learning he's
a remarkably gifted salesman with an equally remarkable product, George
branches his operation out to the East Coast and frequently deals with
hundreds of pounds of herb he obtains from Mexican farmers.</P>
<P>After a bust and brief imprisonment, George promotes himself from weed to
cocaine, with the help of former Colombian cellmate Diego (Jordi Mollà).  He
works his way into Escobar's (Cliff Curtis, Bringing Out the Dead) Medellin
cartel, where he controls about 85% of the United States coke import
business.  George also meets, falls in love with and marries a hot tamale
named Mirtha (Penélope Cruz, All the Pretty Horses).  And then, predictably,
the wheels start to fall off.</P>
<P>The main problem with Blow is that the story just isn't that exciting.  It's
the tale of a guy I've never heard of and knew nothing about, yet it was
easy to see what was going to happen long before it did.  The ending is a
little too sappy (are we supposed to feel sorry for this guy?), and the
whole thing plays like a weak version of GoodFellas, but with a focus on
drugs instead of the Mafia.  It's director Ted Demme's (Life) best work to
date, but parts of the film feel like he's showing off, throwing every
cinematic technique at the screen and emerging a bit like a Guy
Ritchie-style showoff.</P>
<P>But there are plenty of positive things about Blow, too.  It's got all the
great music and silly clothes you'd expect from a period film like this
(Depp's hair gets more and more ridiculous as the film progresses - at one
point, he streaks through an airport looking like the twin brother of Urge
Overkill's Nash Kato).  Depp, Griffiths and Liotta do well with grating
Boston accents, and the makeup department does a great job at aging those
three characters (although they could have just used Skeet Ulrich to play a
young Depp).  This is Depp's best non-Tim Burton performance since Donnie
Brasco, and Blow also marks the American film debut of Franka Potente (Lola
from Run Lola Run), who plays George's girlfriend early in the film.</P>
<P>Blow was based on Bruce Porter's book and adapted for the screen by David
McKenna (Get Carter) and Nick Cassavetes (Unhook the Stars).  It's nicely
photographed by Ellen Kuras (Summer of Sam) and features some nifty editing
by Kevin Tent (Election).</P>
<P>2:04 - R for pervasive drug content and language, some violence and
sexuality</P>
