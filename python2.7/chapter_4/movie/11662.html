<PRE>"When Chronicle of a Disappearance won a prize at Venice, I was
careful not to say that I was Palestinian; I was afraid people would
applaud more loudly if I did."
                                         -Elia Suleiman</PRE>
<P>In a recent article for Cahiers du Cinema, Frederic Strauss, described
Palestininan filmmakers as filmmaker-ambassadors.  Implicit in this
description is the added burden, for these artists, of representing an
entire people as opposed to simply their own views or ideas on a given
subject matter. One of the remarkable qualities of Elia Suleiman's
first film, Chronicle of a Disappearance is that it eleagantly
balances both these tendancies. The film uses an elliptical and
occasionally opaque structure to relate the tale of a Palestinian
filmmaker named Elia Suleiman who has returned to Palestine. The
expected ambivalence, confusion, amusement, despair and elation that
comes with this journey are all conveyed in the film. This is seen
through a number of episodes that are presented, almost as a simple
travelogue, except that a carefully controlled style and a number of
associative devices are used to elevate this material in masterful
ways.</P>
<P>    Suleiman achieves considerable economy of means by keeping his
production modes relatively simple: non-professional actors, natural
lighting, location shooting.  However, his actual use of these tools
is by no means simple. It would have perhaps been tempting to offer a
more straight forward narrative, in the vein of recent 'social
realism' such as (Sandrine Veysset's) Will There be Snow For
Christmas, an accomplished film in it's own right. Instead, however,
Suleiman uses an episodic structure marked by a number of careful
repetitions and variations. A car repeatedly comes to a halt outside
of a cafe and the drivers have an altercation or exchange of some
kind; the 'Holy Land Souvenir Shop' is repeatedly framed in long-shot,
with usually one key element of motion either being introduced or
withdrawn from the frame etc.. While specific interpretations will
vary, it is the overall technique: the juxtaposing of seemingly
similiar yet disparate scenes as to tease out inquiries that is
telling.  These are moments in time...a people that has perhaps grown
eerily accustomed to being marginalized by an annexing culture that
denys them both their history and their future. In a recent interview
Suleiman asserted that, "...a principle reason for [outsiders] wanting
peace today, is to deny the existence of Palestinans before 1948; to
not have to deal with this problem."</P>
<P>    One of the most notable aspects of the film is Suleiman's
restrained use of the camera. For the most part scenes are framed from
a single static position. But this is not the arbitraray static camera
that has come to plague so many, fiscally challenged and aesthetically
bankrupt Americain Independant filmmakers. This is not the
'Look-ma-no-cuts' style of Jim Mackay (Girlstown) or Neil Labutte (In
The Compny of Men). Suleiman employs Bressonian rigour in choosing the
composition, angle and particularly the articulation between his
shots. The result is a considerable density despite the spare means
described earlier. This 'persistence' of the camera alludes to a
feeling of the need to document. A need to describe and represent in
the absence of an official history for Palestinians. The insistence of
a certain computer journal to perpetually record the words "The next
day", as if this in itself were enough, reinforces this notion.</P>
<P>    The film is at its best when it betrays the comic sensibility of
its director. The opening monologue of a woman sitting on a couch
indulging in neighbourhood gossip, the meeting of two friends who
shake hands, offer each other cigarettes and light them exactly
mirroring each others gestures, the bufoonery of Israeli police as
they raid a woman's house and fail to see her despite an obvious
presence (more concerned with being policemen than with recognizing
their foe.) all provide humorous counterpoints to the more serious
undertones of the film. Suleiman has provided an exceptionally well
realized work that we can only hope will spearhead continued efforts
from Palestinian filmmakers in Palestine and around the world.</P>
