<P>Fight Club - Directed by David Fincher.  </P>
<P>      There is a certain elegance and grace to Fight Club that is rarely seen
in movies today.  The scenes flow from one to another, the dialogue seems fresh
and realistic, and the whole movie comes off as being effortless.  That, of
course, is not true, a lot of work must of gone into the production of Fight
Club, and all of that work was work paid off.  Few movies have ever achieved
the greatness that Fight Club manages to pull off, it is a marvel of film
making.</P>
<P>     Watching Fight Club is an adventure in itself.  Sitting in your seat
noticing all the little details in this film is what makes it so great.  I
couldn't help but think to myself how far the movie-making industry has come in
order to make movies like this.  This is by no means a conventional movie, it
took the path less traveled and made something truly unique, with lots of
original scenes, (aka the scene where "cigarette burns" are explained to the
audience).  Fight Club definatley has a lot of depth and care given to each
scene, and this makes for a more enjoyable movie experience.  Watching Fight
Club for the first time is like being introduced to a whole new world, a
temporary environment where you can just let yourself go and be a part of
something, and when it ends, reality comes crashing down.</P>
<P>     There is very little else to say about this movie, it is almost an escape
for the viewer.  There are so many little things that I would love to talk
about, however half of the fun of this movie is to find them out for yourself. </P>

Roger Ebert is a sell out.</PRE>
