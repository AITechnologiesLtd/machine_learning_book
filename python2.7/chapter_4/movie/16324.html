1989 - 99 minutes.
Rated R (for profanity and sexual situations).
Reviewed October 28, 1998.</P>
<P>Steve Soderbergh's "sex, lies, and videotape," which won the Grand Prize 
at the Cannes Film Festival in 1989, arguably began the resurgence of 
independent films. Made on a shoestring budget of $1.2 million, with 
then relatively unknown actors, it is a provocative, thoroughly original 
drama.</P>
<P>The film mostly focuses on the four central characters, all in their 
late 20's-early 30's. Ann (Andie MacDowell), an unfulfilled housewife, 
is married to John (Peter Gallagher), an insensitive lawyer, who, 
unbeknownst to her, is having an affair with her younger sister, Cynthia 
(Laura San Giacomo). Complicating matters even worse is Graham (James 
Spader, who won Best Actor at Cannes), John's old college buddy, who 
comes to stay at their house. Ann is absolutely won over by him, even 
though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex.
That is the set-up for the last hour of the picture, and since the film 
is entitled, "sex, lies, and videotape," it is best to keep the rest of 
the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine 
surprise. </P>
<P>Director Steven Soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker, 
ranging from the independent, to the mainstream (1998's "Out of Sight"), 
to the downright Kafkaesque (1997's "Schizopolis"). He is the type of 
director who obviously takes a lot of chances, and believes in the work 
that he does, and, "sex, lies, and videotape," is probably his most 
confident, and maybe even best, to date.</P>
<P>The performances are superb from all four leads, but MacDowell stands 
out in what is probably the main character. She is always a very winning 
actress, but this is probably her most three-dimensional role that she 
has had (with a close second being Altman's 1993 mosaic, "Short Cuts"). 
The other parts are perfectly cast as well, from Spader's ominous 
Graham, to Gallagher's self-involved John, to Giacomo's outspoken 
Cynthia.</P>
<P>The final act of the film, especially, comes right out of left field, 
and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching, and it would be 
criminal to give away the film's secrets. Suffice to say that, through 
one powerful sequence, Ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell, 
and John learns a valuable lesson about honesty, as well as deception.
The film has one fault , however. The characters are almost all 
emotionally cold and isolated from one another, and often unlikable. If 
there had been a few extra scenes with Gallagher, it probably would have 
helped, since his relationship with MacDowell isn't quite as explored as 
I would have liked.</P>
<P>"sex, lies, and videotape," although minorly flawed, is still easily a 
brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about 
its subject matter than the usual film. Soderbergh clearly knew what he 
was doing while he was making it, and the final product certainly proves 
this. </P>
