<PRE>                                    NAKED
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  David Thewlis, Lesley Sharp, Katlin Cartlidge, Greg
Cruttwell, Peter Wight, Claire Skinner.
Screenplay/Director:  Mike Leigh.</P>
<P>     I can thoroughly understand someone either loving or loathing Mike
Leigh's NAKED.  On the one hand, it is a rather unpleasant visceral
experience with troubling images of violence against women; on the
other hand, it is unflinching in its acidic humor and features a
tour-de-force performance by David Thewlis.  Yet for my money, there is
another level at which NAKED approaches brilliance.  This film is a
warning designed for the self rather than for society, a startling
examination of one mind's response to dehumanization.</P>
<P>     NAKED focuses its attention on Johnny (David Thewlis), an
intelligent but extremely bitter drifter from Manchester who takes off
for London as the film opens.  There he looks up old girlfriend Louise
(Lesley Sharp), but first finds her roommate Sophie (Katlin
Cartlidge).  They get along famously, perhaps a bit too famously as
Sophie becomes rather clinging.  Johnny spends his days wandering
through London, sharing his unique philosophies with characters like
Brian (Peter Wight), a mild-mannered night watchman.  Meanwhile, Louise
and Sophie have a run-in with their sado-masochistic landlord Sebastian
Hawkes (Greg Cruttwell), who makes himself a bit too much at home.</P>
<P>     With Johnny, Mike Leigh has created a magnificent character who
serves as a prophet of the apocalypse, an apocalypse he describes in
terms rather different from what one might expect.  He is intensely
aware that humans, including himself, are becoming something less than
human, and his commentary is filled with references to monkeys.  As he
watches Brian perform his mundane job, Johnny notes that it could be
done by a "tall chimp."  On another occasion, Louise asks him, "Why are
you such a bastard?"  "Monkey see, monkey do," is his response.  Still
later, Johnny asks Sondra (Claire Skinner), Louise and Sophie's
high-strung third roommate, about her experiences as a nurse:  "Is it
true some babies are born with, like, fur all over them?"  And on and
on, too many instances to mention, all connected to Johnny's larger
obsession with evolution.  The fact is that in his own unique way,
Johnny is a true optimist.  When he "preaches" to Brian about the end
of humanity as we know it, he is describing an event he looks forward
to.  We are not the ultimate expression of creation, he realizes; we
are far too base.  Johnny acknowledges the animal aspect of his nature,
but he doesn't revel in it.  When he speaks of our new form being like
the angels, he is speaking with hope and passion.  The title of the
film itself becomes an acknowledgement of our status in the universe:
when all the frills are stripped away, we're just big monkeys, monkeys
who seem to have stopped reaching for more.</P>
<P>     All the brilliance in the world in the writing would have counted
for little withough a perfect actor for Johnny, and David Thewlis is
that actor.  His sarcastic, often bilious musings easily could have
come off as smug and self-congratulatory, but Thewlis pours a great
deal of emotion into his lines.  Yes, he believes that he is more aware
than those around him, but he derives no pleasure from that knowledge,
instead finding only disgust with it.  Thewlis is supported by several
other fine performances, most notable Claire Skinner's small but
memorable role as the frantic Sondra; only Cruttwell rings false with
his slimy Sebastian.</P>
<P>     NAKED is not without its faults.  An encounter between Johnny and
a young Scots couple who can't seem to find one another is funny, but
doesn't really connect to the rest of the film.  The Sebastian
character is way too much, too crudely drawn to work as the
representation of gilded brutishness he is meant to be.  NAKED has a
semblance of a narrative through-line, but basically it's a collection
of snapshots viewed through Johnny's singular lens, and that collection
can appear somewhat unfocused.  But from its first jarring frames to
its final shot of Johnny limping down a London street, it risks showing
us the side of ourselves we don't like to see, and hoping we won't turn
away.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 monkeys:  8.</PRE>
