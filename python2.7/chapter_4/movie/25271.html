<P>The Kentucky Fried Movie is the writing debut of comic masterminds Jerry
Zucker, Jim Abrahams and David Zucker (who went on to give us zany gems
like Airplane!, Top Secret!, and The Naked Gun trilogy).  The film is a
raunchy sketch comedy movie (a popular comedic format in the 1970s, with
The Groove Tube and Loose Shoes as other examples) and most have
described it as an R-rated "Saturday Night Live". </P>
<P>The Kentucky Fried Movie is horribly dated by today's comedic standards,
but the attempts at humor come so often that there are enough good jokes
throughout to make it work.  Although, I wonder what someone's reaction
to this film would be watching it for the first time today, since a
great deal of the humor is based on the commercials and fads of the
70s.  I mean, when was the last time you heard "Detroit" as the
punchline of a joke? </P>
<P>Best bits include: the educational film "Zinc Oxide and You", the 1950s
lawyer spoof "Courtroom", and the final skit of the film where a TV news
anchorman and his crew watch a young couple having sex through the
couple's television.  Other segments fall flat or run too long, with the
Bruce Lee parody "A Fistful of Yen" definitely falling into the latter
category. </P>
<P>The Kentucky Fried Movie is available on DVD from Anchor Bay
Entertainment.  It contains the film in its original theatrical aspect
ratio of 1.85:1 (and enhanced for 16x9 televisions), as well as a full
frame version.  The disc also features a full length audio commentary
track (featuring director John Landis, producer Robert K. Weiss, and
writers Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams and David Zucker), the original
theatrical trailer (featuring footage shot specifically for the
trailer... and advertising the film as G-rated!), behind the scenes
footage, a photo gallery, and crew biographies. </P>
<P>The commentary track is a blast, just as you'd expect it to be with
these five men in one room.  The jokes come as quickly as they do in the
film, although many times someone ends up getting talked over (as is
common with commentary tracks featuring numerous participants). 
Director John Landis is quick to point out all the moments that would
never make it through the motion picture rating board today, and how the
film, if resubmitted, would instantly get an NC-17 rating.  Landis also
pulls off the amazing feat of seemingly knowing what every single member
of the cast is doing today. </P>
<P>The behind the scenes footage, which was shot by the Zuckers to prove to
their parents that they were actually making a movie, is interesting
whenever there's sound to go with it.  However, that isn't often.  The
remaining silent footage would be of the most interest to the cast and
crew of the film, as watching them all sit and enjoy a meal isn't too
entertaining for me (despite those silly 70s haircuts). </P>
<P>Anchor Bay has done the fans of this film a great service with this
special edition DVD, and I'm very happy to support a company dedicated
to giving its customers exactly what they want.  [R]</P>
