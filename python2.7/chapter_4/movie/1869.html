<PRE>                                PASSION FISH
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  John Sayles's latest film is a nice
     pleasant story of two women learning to get along and survive
     with each other.  This leisurely story of a paraplegic and
     her nurse learning to deal with and then help each other has
     few surprises, but it does do a detailed portrait of its
     major characters.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     May-Alice Culhane (played by Mary McDonnell) was once the queen of the
soaps.  Then a reckless taxi driver turned her into an unemployed
paraplegic.  She wakes in a hospital with no memory of the accident and with
a vicious attitude toward life.  She determines to return to her family home
in Louisiana's Cajun country to drink, watch television, and generally pity
herself.  In this state she goes through several nurses.  Either she could
not stand them or they could not stand her.</P>
<P>     Finally, Chantelle (played by Alfre Woodard) is sent by the agency.
Chantelle wants the job, but has little experience and a bad background.
Surprisingly, she is a natural at dealing with May-Alice.  Each battles the
other and has enough need to put up with the other's bullying.  Chantelle
starts seeing a man from town while May-Alice strikes up a friendship with
an old potential beau, Rennie (played by David Strathairn).  Rennie is
already married with five children and May-Alice's condition makes sex
impossible, but there clearly is some interest.</P>
<P>     John Sayles both wrote and directed PASSION FISH, taking his time to do
it right.  In showing us some of May-Alice's old friends, Sayles is able to
have some fun at the expense of the soap opera industry and at overly demure
Southern womanhood.  The film is longish at 134 minutes, but it does not
drag.  Some of the Louisiana scenery is very well photographed.  I give
PASSION FISH a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>[Seen at the Montgomery Theater in Rocky Hill, NJ.]</P>
