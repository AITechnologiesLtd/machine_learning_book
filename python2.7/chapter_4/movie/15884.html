<PRE>Shakespeare In Love</PRE>
<PRE>Director: John Madden.</PRE>
<P>Starring: Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Ben
Affleck, Judy Dench.</P>
<P>Going to see Shakespeare In Love I learnt a lesson that I've learnt
many times before and I'm sure I'll learn many times again. It kind of
undermines this web-site but the lesson is: Never listen to critics!</P>
<P>I had seen the preview for Shakespeare In Love and it looked exactly
like the kind of movie I would hate. Three things, however, worked
against me. First, the critics were raving about it. It was getting
ten out of tens, and fours stars and two thumbs way up. Second, a
friend of mine believes that whatever impression a preview gives, the
only thing you can be sure of is that the movie isn't like
that. Third, Colin Firth was in it.</P>
<PRE>So, off I went.</PRE>
<P>Perhaps the lesson should be always trust your first
instincts. Shakespeare In Love was a trial to sit through. There are
so many reasons why this is a painful movie: let me count the ways.</P>
<P>    1.Gwyneth Paltrow and her nasal British accent. Are there no
British female actors of the right age to play this part? (Perhaps
they all read the script and had too much sense.) Or if we must have
an American actor to drag in the US audience, could we please have
someone different? After Emma and Sliding Doors I've had enough of the
British Ms. Paltrow.
    2.Romeo and Juliet. I will confess that I think this is one of
Shakespeare's weakest plays. Perhaps it was revolutionary for the
times, perhaps it tells an amazing story, but really, it's now such an
overdone plot in Hollywood: star crossed lovers, insurmountable
barriers, passion beyond compare. In Shakespeare In Love, we don't
only have to sit through the story of Romeo and Juliet, we have to sit
through the rehearsals and the performance of it, just in case we
don't get the allegory.*
    3.More British accents. I will admit that Ben Affleck played quite
a good role but there were moments when his accent wandered. At one
point this event caused me to laugh at the most inappropriate
moment. I prefer Kenneth Branaugh's approach of letting people speak
in their own accent. It's not like historical authenticity was a point
here: the British people were speaking with twentieth century accents.
    4.Did Gwyneth Paltrow really need to have her breast bound to pass
as a boy?
    5.The soap opera production values. By this I mean the climactic
moment, serious close-up of our male hero as he reacts to the
situation, amazing close-up of our female hero as she reacts to the
situation, quick shot of a couple of the by-standers for their
reaction, back to the heros, lingering on their faces, cut to a
commercial. Ok, so we didn't get the commercial but we got everything
else.</P>
<P>Are there any good points to this movie? Well, it looks
beautiful. They may all behave like they're in General Hospital but
they've got a budget that would make television people weep. Apart
from the wandering accents, all the performances are quite good and
finally, Colin Firth is in it.  He seems to be specialising in playing
the baddies opposite people of the Fiennes family (see The English
Patient).</P>
<P>Speaking of which, if you liked that movie, you'll probably like this.
They're very similar: star-crossed lovers, insurmountable barriers,
passion beyond compare. Are there no original ideas in movies any
more?</P>
<PRE>Rating: CP</PRE>
<P>*For those of you who find this stance contradictory to the HD that I gave
Romeo + Juliet, I think Baz Luhrmann's treatment of this play is
perfect for the subject matter, suggesting perhaps that it's not totally
the play that's the thing but what you do with it that matters.</P>
