                                    CRONOS              
                        A Film Review by Scott Renshaw 
                         Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw </PRE>
<P>Starring:  Federico Luppi, Ron Perlman, Claudio Brook, Tamara Shanath, 
Margarita Isabel.
Screenplay/Director:  Guillermo del Toro.</P>
<P>     Horror films with any semblance of wit or style are so rare
that I'm tempted to be even warmer in my embrace of CRONOS than my 
head tells me to be.  This Mexican import puts a unique spin on its 
tale of a search for eternal life, features some extremely arresting 
imagery and has a nicely twisted sense of humor.  Yet as much as I 
admired the artistry of CRONOS, I couldn't help but notice a gaping 
hole at the center, namely a central character who steadfastly refused 
to engender any sympathy.  A viewer willing to overlook its lack of 
heart will be rewarded by a project full of a new director's 
excitement at being allowed to realize his vision.</P>
<P>     CRONOS opens with a narration describing the efforts of a 14th
century alchemist to find the secret to eternal life.  In our own 
time, that secret has fallen into the hands of antique dealer Jesus 
Gris (Federico Luppi), in the form of a mysterious golden egg called 
the cronos device.  After unwittingly activating it, a change begins 
to come over Jesus which worries his granddaughter Aurora (Tamara 
Shanath).  And his transformation is not the only dilemma facing 
Jesus.  Dying industrialist Dieter de la Guardia (Claudio Brook) also 
knows of the existence of the cronos device, and wants to use its 
power to save himself.  He sends his brutish American nephew Angel 
(Ron Perlman), who covets an inheritance from his uncle, to obtain the 
device--a quest which proves exceedingly difficult.</P>
<P>     Thanks to the half-dozen or so credits which precede the title,
CRONOS reportedly boasts the second highest budget in Mexican film 
history (behind only LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE), and Guillermo del Toro 
leaves it all on the screen.  True, the make-up effects seem cheesy by 
modern standards, but elsewhere CRONOS sports a high polish.  The art 
direction team of Brigitte Broch and Maria Figueroa have created some 
dynamic sets, most notably Dieter's antiseptic living quarters, filled 
with dangling statues and jars containing Dieter's excised tumors.  
Also noteworthy is the cronos device itself, and del Toro's creative 
use of it, including showing its elaborate inner workings.  Director 
of photography Guillermo Navarro shoots the film with an emphasis on 
big spaces, and the result is a deliciously spooky atmosphere.</P>
<P>     For all its visual flair, CRONOS may be most satisfying on the
level of del Toro's off-beat sense of humor.  There is a glorious 
perversity to a scene in which Jesus finds himself inexplicably 
compelled to perform a unique clean-up job after a gentleman with a 
nosebleed in a public restroom, and to the image of Aurora clearing 
out her toybox to serve a purpose for which it probably was never 
intended.  There is also a quirky performance by Daniel Jimenez Cacho 
as a mortician who takes inordinate pride in his craft, and Ron 
Perlman (of TV's "Beauty and the Beast") as the slightly dim-witted 
goon obsessed with getting a nose job.  Guillermo del Toro manages to 
put a lot of bite into his script, in more ways than one.</P>
<P>     There is that one big problem, though:  Jesus Gris is
completely bland.  Del Toro doesn't connect Jesus' fate with his 
character in any noticeable way; in fact, it might be a stretch to say 
that Jesus has a character.  With his ultra-symbolic name, you would 
assume that there might be some attempt to go deeper into the 
psychology of his "resurrection."  But there is no sense of who he was 
before his experience with the cronos device, and more early 
characterization would have been extremely useful.  I also had 
problems with Aurora, whose placid response to bizarre events is 
stylized but ultimately tedious.  Of course, style is ultimately 
CRONOS' strongest asset, and it's very strong at that.</P>
<P>     Guillermo del Toro has said that he only wants to make horror
films.  With a bit of seasoning as a writer, these projects could 
prove well worth anticipating for the thinking fright fan.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 cronos devices:  7.</PRE>
