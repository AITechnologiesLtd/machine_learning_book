<PRE>Air Force One -- Hail to the Chief</PRE>
<P>Blending the action-gripping essence of Die Hard and the claustrophobic   
intensity of Executive Decision, the resulting elixir is a potent mixture   
in the form of Air Force One.  Being such, it is a high-flying adventure   
that offers a lot of roller-coaster style excitement in this airborne   
suspense thriller.</P>
<P>Harrison Ford stars as the President of the United States.  After Russian   
terrorists (led by the sinister Gary Oldman) somehow board the world's   
most advanced and secure airplane, they eventually overtake the   
presidential plane and hold everyone hostage, including several chiefs of   
staff, a bevy of secret service agents, and the president's family.  In   
exchange for the safe release of the hostages, the terrorists demand that   
the Russians release a recently captured military General, who was   
imprisoned for heinous acts of tyranny while in power.</P>
<P>It is an extraordinarily high price to pay for the hostages safety.  Not   
only do the Russians not want to release a madman that could undermine   
the stability of the Russian government, but the leadership at home, led   
by Glenn Close as a formidable Vice-President and Dean Stockwell as a   
must-take-action Secretary of Defense, also vehemently stands by   
America's principle to not negotiate with terrorists.  However, if his   
demands are not met, he will execute one hostage every 30 minutes.</P>
<P>Air Force One doesn't really amount to anything more than a simple story   
about the good guys trying to retake the plane and defeat the terrorists.   
 But it is the caliber of the actors and the fine ingredients thrown into   
the movie recipe that makes this summer fare worth sampling.  Ford is   
reliably charismatic as the President -- stern and tough, but still   
vulnerable when faced with decisions of the heart.  Ford becomes the   
anchor for all that is American; all that is good; all that is just ˜ and   
will die for his country.  Oldman plays his character with delicious   
intent as a psychotic militant bent on carrying out his demands.   Oldman   
is the anchor of future Russia (at least as he sees it).  He is equally   
willing to die for his beliefs as well.</P>
<P>Additionally, the movie incorporates several excitement-heightening   
components that keeps you at the edge of your seat.  There is the   
constant cat and mouse chase through the tight confines of the airplane.   
 There is constant ingenuity displayed as the adrenaline-rushed good guys   
try to find different ways to free the hostages or to land the plane.   
 But most of all, there is no doubt that of all the protagonists of the   
summer, there is no one worth rooting for more than the President (and   
America) -- the embodiment of truth, justice and the American way.  And,   
it was also interesting to see the capabilities of Air Force One, loaded   
with sophisticated gadgetry and advanced military technology.</P>
<P>Yet, despite this generally, excitingly, executed storyline, you'll find   
that the ending was somewhat of a letdown given all that had transpired   
as you question the motivations behind one of the main characters.  So   
much so, in fact, that it slowed much of the momentum as the movie wound   
to a close.  Nonetheless, the fast-paced action, the fine all-around   
performances, and the sheer enjoyment value of the film earned its wings.   
 I salute this fine summer offering.</P>
