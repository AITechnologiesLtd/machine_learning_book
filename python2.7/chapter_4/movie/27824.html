<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>I enjoy a lot of different kinds of films, but none more so than the scary 
ones. There are few things more satisfying than sitting in a darkened 
theatre and feeling my heart pounding in my chest, sweat beading on my 
forehead, each breath coming just a little bit faster as the action on the 
screen unfolds. Being startled so much that I actually jump back in my 
seat -- that, to me, is perhaps the ultimate cinemagoing experience. It's 
the surest sign that I'm not just watching the movie, but am completely 
absorbed in it.</P>
<P>These days, sadly, Hollywood tends to favour the more low-brow slasher 
genre. Some of these are enjoyable enough in their own right (I'm a big 
fan of the original "Scream"), but too often they substitute gore for real 
terror, and that's a thrill that's far more ephemeral. Even the occasional 
movie which does harken back to more mature suspense frequently sacrifices 
atmosphere for cod mysticism -- last autumn's "Bless The Child" springs to 
mind.</P>
<P>"The Gift" attempts to reverse this trend. Its setting is a staple of the 
classic American thriller: the Deep South, in this case the backwoods town 
of Brixton, Georgia. Brixton is a place made up of rusted pick-ups and old 
Gothic mansions, murky lakes and gnarled old trees. The denizens are a 
superstitious lot making a pretense of living in modern times: they scoff 
at the unknown, until they have no other choice but to accept it. I was 
most reminded of the excellent but little-seen TV show "American Gothic" 
from the mid-Nineties (indeed, that programme's demonic sheriff, Gary 
Cole, makes an appearance here as a philandering lawyer).</P>
<P>The movie's title refers to the paranormal abilities of a woman named 
Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett). Annie's husband died a year earlier and she 
now supports herself and her three sons by telling people's fortunes with 
the help of a deck of Tarot-like cards. Amongst those who appeal to 
Annie's wisdom are a troubled mechanic (Giovanni Ribisi) and Valerie 
Barksdale (Hilary Swank), who is trapped in a marriage to abusive redneck 
Donnie (Keanu Reeves). When Donnie finds out that Annie has been 
encouraging Valerie to leave him, he threatens both her and her children. 
The local police are little help: not only are they friends of Donnie's, 
but they view Annie as little better than a Satan worshipper.</P>
<P>One evening, Annie and a friend go to the local country club to relax. 
There, Annie meets her son's school principal, Wayne Collins (Greg 
Kinnear). There is an obvious attraction between them, but Wayne is 
already engaged to heiress Jessica King (Katie Holmes), whose status as 
the town slut seems to be no secret at all, except to Wayne. That night, 
Jessica vanishes. Quickly exhausting their leads, the police reluctantly 
turn to Annie for help. Annie begins experiencing visions which help her 
uncover Jessica's grisly fate. But in the process, she puts herself and 
her boys at risk of an equally grim end.</P>
<P>In most good thrillers, the setting is as vital an ingredient as any 
actor, and director Sam Raimi does a fine job of filming his rural locale. 
Nature is filled with unseen menace, and we can readily believe that such 
an environment would have bred a woman like Annie. There is a palpable 
atmosphere in scenes such as one where the psychic wanders outdoors after 
experiencing a horrifying vision. We know that her ordeal is not finished 
yet, but the source of the terror could be anywhere.</P>
<P>Blanchett is in good form as the small-town seer, demonstrating that Annie 
is a normal woman who just happens to have a special talent -- no 
different than if she were a great pianist or a gifted surgeon. She sees 
her "gift" as simply a means to keep her family going. It is interesting 
to observe the role that Annie plays in the community of Brixton. While 
many view her with suspicion, for others she plays the same role that a 
psychiatrist might in a different setting. She doesn't just tell her 
customers' fortunes, but consoles them and advises them: she is as much 
counsellor as clairvoyant.</P>
<P>But despite these promising beginnings, Raimi, working from a script by 
Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson, isn't able to maintain his momentum. 
Things start off far too slowly, for one, as Raimi awkwardly brings his 
player on stage. And then, just when things get rolling, the movie detours 
into a by-the-numbers legal sub-plot, with Annie defending herself and her 
abilities before the courts. The idea of fortune tellers being mistrusted 
and feared is hardly a new one, and "The Gift" does not put a new spin on 
the concept. As a result, this extended sequence is just marking time,
dragging out the proceedings between Jessica's disappearance and its 
ultimate resolution.</P>
<P>Simply put, "The Gift" is too straightforward a story for a feature film. 
There are no real twists and turns, and those that do crop up are obvious 
and predictable. The entire movie is cliche piled upon cliche: the 
would-be frights are standard fare, the plot unravels without enormous 
surprise, and most of the characters are common stereotypes, such as 
Reeves' country redneck and the woefully miscast Holmes' high-society 
trollop. Even a last-minute "Sixth Sense"-like twist has been lifted 
wholesale from any number of old folk tales.</P>
<P>"The Gift" is the sort of movie that probably would have been better off 
as part of an anthology (if Hollywood made those). Cut down to an hour or 
so, with a better balance between the plot and the film's focus on Annie 
as a character, this could have been a nice atmospheric piece. As it is, 
"The Gift" is entertaining in places, but is simply too insubstantial and 
too typical of the genre to succeed as a whole. While it's great to see an 
old-fashioned thriller back in theatres, I don't think it's too much to
expect a few new ideas too.</P>
