<PRE>Review:</PRE>
<P>This movie is not for everyone.  It's important to get that out of the way
at the outset.  It's a strange, disturbing, confusing, and considerably
offensive movie, and it's without question one of my all-time favorites.</P>
<P>When I first heard of this movie back before it was released in theaters,
I was excited about it, though I'd never even heard of the book.  I
originally discovered it when I was trying to check up on whatever Terry
Gilliam's new project might be.  You might know him from any of a number of
excellent movies he has directed including "12 Monkeys",
"Brazil", and "The Fisher King".  Anyway, I was very favorably surprised to
find that this, his next movie, was going to star two of my favorite actors,
Depp (go see "Donnie Brasco", "Ed Wood", and "Edward Scissorhands") and Del
Toro ("The Usual Suspects" and many small but incredible roles).</P>
<P>Anyway, to the movie at hand.  It is, simply put, about drugs.  Slightly
less simply put, it is "A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American
Dream".
The plot revolves around two compatriots, a doctor of journalism and his
attorney, who are sent to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race for the
magazine Raoul Duke (Depp) works for.  This business trip (no pun intended)
quickly turns into an extended orgy of drug use, mayhem, and (dare I say)
hilarity.  The movie is clearly a comedy, but there are many moments where
the experience becomes oppressive -- too strange, too demented.</P>
<P>Like the book (which I rapidly bought and read after seeing the film), the
movie is able to rapidly and seamlessly go from ridiculous humor to
disturbing and uncomfortable strangeness to a really poetic and thought
provoking narration.  Actually, almost everything in the movie is word for
word, image for image taken from the book.  It's a very faithful
reproduction.</P>
<P>As I said, it's definitely not something everyone would like, but I strongly
urge everyone who thinks there is any chance they would like it to give it
some serious thought.</P>
