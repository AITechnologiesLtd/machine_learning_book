<PRE>                                THE REAL MCCOY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Kim Basinger, Val Kilmer, Terence Stamp.
Screenplay:  William Davies & William Osborne.
Director:  Russell Mulcahy.</P>
<P>     Some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch.
Then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone *in* the
movie has turned off *their* brains.  THE REAL MCCOY is both.  It's
charmless, molasses-slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that
the film commission of Atlanta, where THE REAL MCCOY is set, might well
consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this
humiliation.</P>
<P>     THE REAL MCCOY opens with bank robber Karen McCoy (Kim Basinger)
being arrested in the middle of a job.  Six years later, Karen is out
on parole and looking to stay straight.  She soon bumps into
J. T. Barker (Val Kilmer), a hapless would-be thief who idolizes Karen.
J. T. also has ties to Jack Schmidt (Terence Stamp), the man who blew
the whistle on Karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him.
Schmidt, who is in cahoots with Karen's sleazy parole officer (Gailard
Sartain), again wants Karen to help him stage a robbery.  This time he
has some leverage:  Karen's kidnapped son.  Just when she thought she
was out, they keep pulling her back *in.*</P>
<P>     Contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and
furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them.  Leading the
list is the Jack Schmidt character, who through unexplained but
presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story
begins.  There is no reason given why he should need or want to get
involved in another crime, let alone why he would actually participate
in the break-in.  Karen's initial encounter with J. T. during a botched
convenience store hold-up also strains the limits of credibility.  It
would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that
point, but instead they run into each other the next day because
they're leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment.
Small world, eh?  Then there's the convenient car trouble during an
attempted escape, and pet tigers which, through the power of the Laws
of Bad Cinema, must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into
their cage.  However, the buffoon prize goes to the Atlanta police, who
come off like the Keystone Kops on a bad day.</P>
<P>     But the fun doesn't end there in the shambles of a script by
William Davies and William Osborne.  There is also the absence of a
single, solitary interesting character.  Karen is earnest and
single-minded in her motherly devotion, but lacking any kind of edge
which would make her a convincing criminal, and Basinger is not a
thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material.  Schmidt is a flaccid
villain, the parole officer is a complete blank, and Karen's son and
ex-husband might as well be furniture.  Only Kilmer's J. T. is remotely
appealing, but his one potentially intriguing quality, his ineptitude,
is never developed.  In fact, Kilmer disappears during the middle of
the film, just when his admiration for Karen could have made for an
interesting sub-plot.</P>
<P>     I might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more
appropriate to a caper comedy, but THE REAL MCCOY goes nowhere fast.
Various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever, and some
end with no reason evident why they didn't end up on the cutting room
floor.  Even the reasonably clever climactic break-in falls victim to
this syndrome, including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a
vault which lasts (I kid you not) four minutes.  There is no tension in
the scene, just tedium.  Russell Mulcahy (HIGHLANDER) is a director
with some style, and indeed THE REAL MCCOY looks reasonably good, but
he completely stumbles in the editing room.</P>
<P>     There are so many big problems with THE REAL MCCOY that I'm
tempted to overlook the little ones.  Like Karen disarming one of
Schmidt's henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where
her son is playing.  Like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it
reappearing in one piece a few moments later.</P>
<P>     Tempted.  But I'm pretty good at resisting temptation.</P>
