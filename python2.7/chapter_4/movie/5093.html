<PRE>                               THE SNAPPER
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1993) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        This is one of those artsy foreign Irish comedies (THE 
BROTHERS MCMULLEN, anyone?) with plenty of wry observations 
on life and biting humour (It's not spelled "humor" unless it comes 
from America). Still, even though I enjoyed THE BROTHERS 
MCMULLEN (a separate review I haven't written yet), I couldn't fully 
get into this one. The characters here were the loud, obnoxious kind 
who gather in pubs and gossip about their neighbors. That pretty much 
sums up the movie, pubs and gossip, not to mention gossip in pubs.</P>
<P>        There is a slight plot, though. Young adult Sharon (Tina 
Kellegher) is pregnant. Her parents aren't happy but they still support 
her even though she won't tell them who the father is. She won't tell 
anyone who the father is, not even her friends, whom she regularly 
meets at the pub to have gossip sessions with. Her father also meets his 
friends at the pub for some gossip, where he overhears from one friend 
that another friend said his daughter was "a great ride." That just goes 
to show you how distorted certain statements can become after being 
run through the rumour mill. It turns out the friend, when he used the 
phrase "great ride," was actually talking about the new roller coaster at 
Six Flags Over Ireland.</P>
<P>        Nevertheless, this bloke, older than Sharon's dad, is indeed 
the father of her unborn child. Sharon is pissed at him for letting the 
secret get out because now her entire family is ostracized from the 
community, no one believing her story that the baby's father is a 
Spanish sailor she met while drunk in a hotel room for one night of 
torrid animal sex. (That should make the parents feel better about the 
situation, don't you think?)</P>
<P>        There's not much to the movie. Like I said, pubs and gossip 
about cover it, but it does offer a few memorable lines and biting 
humour. (Sorry, I don't get enough chances to spell the word that 
way.) This Irish comedy may not have been my mug of beer, but it did 
get three-and-a-half stars out of Roger Ebert, comments like 
"Exceptionally funny!" and "Hilarious!" out of The New York Times 
and Newsday, not to mention awards at various film festivals. So 
someone out there likes these European films. THE SNAPPER also 
pretty much answers the question of why Irish people have drinking 
problems when it shows Sharon partaking in alcohol several times 
while pregnant. I'm no Surgeon General, but even I know that's bad 
for a child's health. Now back to my Hostess fried cherry pie...</P>
