<PRE>American Beauty (8/10)</PRE>
<P>Kevin Spacey is one of the few actors whose name in the credits alone
would make me want to see a film. Even in his smaller roles, such as his
portrayal of serial killer John Doe in Seven, he makes an impact far
beyond his screen time, but here he is given the chance to move from
being the king of character actors to being a movie star. He probably
doesn't think of it in those terms, but that's what's happened. Spacey
plays Lester Burhnam, a bumbling inconsequential man in a joyless
marriage to Carolyn (Annette Benning) and with a daughter (Thora Birch)
who hates him for being so pathetic. Lester considers himself to be
half-dead.  Then he meets his daughter's pretty friend (Mena Suvari) and
his life is transformed. But this is not just a film about a middle-aged
man falling for a young girl. The film's main theme is developed by
Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), the Burnham's new neighbour, who sees beauty
all around him and captures this beauty on video.</P>
<P>Although Sam Mendes is a first-time movie director, he has worked in the
theatre, notable directing Nicole Kidman in the London production of The
Blue Room. Given this background, it is not surprising that he has
obtained such fine, emotionally revealing performances from his cast,
but what is striking is that he has not just directed a play and filmed
it - he has made a technically sophisticated movie and had fun playing
with the medium, but he never falls into the trap of being gratuitously
tricksy. Given that this is a film about beauty, it is appropriate that
the film itself is often astonishingly beautiful. The idea of finding
beauty in unexpected places is taken to an extreme in some grainy video
footage of a plastic bag blowing in the wind;  one of the most gorgeous
images I'd ever see in a movie. And in the use of colour and the framing
of characters in their environment, such as the Burnhams at their dining
table, Mendes and cinematographer Conrad Hall produce images that could
have been by Kubrick.</P>
<P>There are moments of utter delight in the screenplay by Alan Ball
(another first-timer), which shares some thematic similarities to David
Fincher's Fight Club - even the leading characters' names (Lester
Burnham and Tyler Durden) have a similar ring. Lester echoes Tyler in
his rejection of society's obsession with material goods, telling his
wife that "it's just stuff" and seeking fulfilment in less conventional
ways. There are also similarities to Todd Solondz's Happiness, which
also frankly examines middle-American family life and sexual mores.
American Beauty, however, has found an audience Happiness couldn't,
maybe because Solondz's film was a little too brutal.</P>
<P>I've seen American Beauty film twice - once with a typical suburban
multiplex crowd and one with an audience made up almost entirely of
students. Both times the cinema was packed and both audiences seemed to
love the film. Lets hope the Hollywood bean-counter take note - serious,
intelligent and accessible movies can be made by new writers and
directors. And these films can make lots of money.</P>
<P>Although it contains much to admire and enjoy, American Beauty is not
perfect. It works better in pieces than as a whole and there is a clumsy
sub-plot and framing device involving Ricky's father, a homophobic ex-
Marines colonel. Although finely played by Chris Cooper, this character
seems to have no relevance to the substance of the film and his
existence in the story seems contrived to provide a dramatic and tidy
end. Its structural flaws aside, American Beauty is a fine film - it's
just not quite the masterpiece that the generally ecstatic critical
reception would suggest.</P>
