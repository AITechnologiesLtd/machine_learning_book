                         A film review by Jeremiah Kipp

<P>The title Series 7 stands for the seventh season of the highest-rated
reality based show on television, The Contenders.  Set a few years from
now, the program rules are laid out with unsparing precision: Six
average, everyday citizens are chosen via random lottery to mercilessly
kill one another.  This will continue until one survivor remains.  Sound
familiar?  When historians chart the downfall of human empathy, they
will see that we were only one step away from moral paralysis in our
increasing apathy to Survivor, Temptation Island, and The Real World. 
Here we are, now entertain us.</P>
<P>This satire couldn't be more cutting edge.  Former tabloid TV producer
Daniel Minahan (and co-screenwriter of I Shot Andy Warhol) takes dead
aim on glib, pre-packaged network formulas for success.  A terse
narrator (Will Arnett) offers mock-sympathetic encouragement for the
contestants as well as in-depth play-by-play ring coverage.  Opponents
are given screen time for weepy confessions to their assigned guerrilla
cameramen, dispassionately filming their fight or flight confrontations
on hand-held digital video.</P>
<P>Our odds-on favorite is the lethal, eight-months-pregnant Dawn (Brooke
Smith), a returning champion with 10 confirmed kills under her belt.  If
she makes it through one final season, she'll be granted her well-earned
freedom.  Marching through the eroded suburbia of her hometown (Newbury,
Connecticut), there's no confusing her for a helpless female.  This
pistol-packing mama will do anything to save her unborn child, eyes
glazed over with steel acceptance.</P>
<P>In the grim opening footage lifted from a previous season, the camera
follows Dawn as she barges into a 7-Eleven to pop a few caps into an
unsuspecting victim.  The expressive, open-faced Smith has always been
one of cinema's best-kept secrets, most memorable as the senator's
daughter at the bottom of Buffalo Bill's well in The Silence of the
Lambs.  Here, she displays a vigilance that kicks Series 7 into
overdrive.</P>
<P>The programmers throw a sensational tabloid curveball by placing Dawn's
perpetually glum high school sweetheart among her opponents.  But almost
all of the dramatic contrivances (this one being the most obvious) can
be written off as part of the television structure-induced malaise. 
It's doubtful they'll be apparent in the visual onslaught of
information.</P>
<P>Revealing a taste for showmanship, the now-married Jeff (Glenn
Fitzgerald) has unorthodox plans for their televised reunion.  Rotting
away from testicular cancer, Jeff literally doesn't have the balls for
this contest.  Minahan shows admirable restraint in not exploiting this
obvious gag.  Jeff asks that Dawn painlessly remove him from the game
with an overdose of sleeping pills.  Easier said than done, especially
when it's the only man she ever loved -- and what if he suddenly
rediscovers his lust for life?  This morbid coupling is even granted an
appropriate theme song, Joy Division's "Love Will Tear Us Apart
(Again)."</P>
<P>Though Dawn and Jeff are given the center spotlight, there's no telling
when their number is gonna be up.  The same can be said for their
colorful opponents, a perfectly cast ensemble of "Joe Average" deviants:
Franklin (Richard Venture), a half-crazed conspiracy theorist; Tony
(Michael Kaycheck), a hulking brute who practices intimidating
shadowboxing techniques; Connie (Marylouise Burke), a brittle emergency
room nurse; and Lindsay (Merritt Weaver), a bright eyed, attractive
17-year old virgin.</P>
<P>Place your bets, but be forewarned: They may not die in the order you'd
expect.  Whether prowling through dimly lit houses or playing
hide-and-seek in an airy shopping mall, mundane locations become bloody
battlegrounds at the drop of a hat.  There's a queasy adrenaline rush in
this hastily staged domestic combat, with tension increased by the
digital photographers covering the scene.  What happens when they step
into the line of fire?</P>
<P>Minahan doesn't play this potentially lurid material as camp, opting
instead for the howlingly funny pseudo-documentary approach of Rob
Reiner's This Is Spinal Tap.  By playing it straight, he's able to take
blistering potshots at media carnage (including an obligatory freeway
chase with echoes of O.J. Simpson) without losing his edge.  When a
contender is taken out, it's not done for giggles like Oliver Stone's
naïve Natural Born Killers, but viewed with the ironic detachment of
video surveillance.  There are no formalities -- once the kill is
confirmed, it's on to the next kill with maddening proclivity.</P>
<P>Series 7 is too self-conscious to be defined as naturalism, but there's
something freakishly accurate in the mannered affectations of these
media-savvy contestants.  Even Dawn's gaze keeps flickering to the lens
of the camera, seeking artificial validation.  Constantly reciting
dialogue lifted from a bad episode of Geraldo Rivera, their emotional
codes of conduct have been gleaned from daytime talk shows.  To even
say, "I love you," during a tearful embrace feels like art imitating
life imitating 90210.  Daniel Minahan welcomes us to the bleak dead-end
of our cultural void -- if it's seen through the camera, it's no longer
real life.</P>
