<PRE>                             THREE COLORS: RED
                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1994 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<P>Directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski
Written by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz</P>
<P>     They don't make movies like this anymore.  Even the most
self-conscious of European films, destined to be widely promoted in
America with dull trailers, tasteful posters, and an art house blitz,
aren't as unapologetically indulgent as the recent films of Polish
director Krzysztof Kieslowski.  His DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE offers an
oblique meditation on the properties of light alongside a metaphysical
study of Veronique, a French woman who inadvertently photographs her
perfect double (Weronika) while visiting Poland.  BLUE casts art-house
standby Juliette Binoche (THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING, DAMAGE) as
a mopey French widow, and features a rich and overwhelming orchestral
score and arresting imagery (a sugar cube touched to coffee fills the
movie screen as the white crystals turn brown) that literally bring the
film to a halt time and again.  WHITE is a neatly comic film about
marriage and capitalism that travels from France back to Poland and
offers up at least one show-stopping visual metaphor--the screen blazes
white in illustration of Julie Delpy's orgasm, reducing audiences to
gasps and titters.</P>
<P>     Kieslowski's harshest critics maintain that the films sap the
sympathies of an irredeemably gullible audience.  They accuse him of
arranging for fashionable Frenchwomen to traipse through his very
European landscapes, murmuring New Age platitudes, sleeping with
sensitive New Age guys, and pouting for the camera.  The director's
newest film, RED, the culmination of his Three Colors trilogy which
also includes BLUE and WHITE, they insist, is overblown claptrap,
substituting notions of Fate and Destiny for credible filmmaking.  The
new issue of FILM COMMENT juxtaposes a rich essay on the trilogy by
NEW YORK DAILY NEWS critic Dave Kehr with a tirade against it (by
Phillip Lopate) which insists that the film's supporters have been
aesthetically "bamboozled."</P>
<P>     Kieslowski's audience is neither gullible nor easily amused.  The
concluding scenes of RED, which may represent the conclusion of the
director's career, tie the three films of the trilogy together so
perfectly and unexpectedly that their themes resonate in a viewer's
head for days afterward.  The films ostensibly examine the principles
of liberty, equality, and fraternity, but they do so in the service of
a much broader agenda.  Kieslowski has integrated three very distinct
pieces into a triptych that folds in on itself and contemplates its own
nature.  In the process, his characters determine one another's
destinies, even as the director plays God.</P>
<P>     Irene Jacob, the uncannily radiant star of VERONIQUE, is
Valentine, a Swiss model who we see shooting an advertisement for (of
all things) chewing gum.  In the film's most memorable visual trope,
her face is to be reproduced on a huge banner and draped against the
side of a building in Geneva.  Accidents and mishaps drive much of the
action in Kieslowski's films, and the most important relationship here
is catalyzed when Valentine, trying to tune in a distant radio station
on her car stereo, hits a dog in the street.  The dog, named Rita, is
bleeding, but alive, and Valentine tries to take it back to its home.
Valentine finds Rita's owner, the retired judge Joseph Kern (the
perfectly crusty Jean-Louis Trintignant), who hardly seems to care
whether the dog lives or dies.  Kern leads a solitary life, but has a
radio set up so that he can monitor the telephone conversations of his
neighbors.  Valentine initially finds his aural voyeurism repugnant,
but a strange bond grows between the two characters as they relate
their life stories to one another.</P>
<P>     The film contains a great many telephone conversations, and indeed
Kieslowski investigates the ways in which we humans communicate (or
fail to communicate) with one another.  It's telling that the
relationship between Valentine and Kern (they could be lovers if not
for their age difference) is the only one in which two people seem to
be gaining knowledge and support from one another (Valentine has a
boyfriend, Michel, who is in England and who she plans to visit, but
throughout RED she only communicates with him by telephone).  It
would be unfair to give away further details, since much of the film is
wrapped up in the intricate relationships that color the lives of both
Valentine and Kern, and an odd sort of "double life" that Kern himself
is living.  The film, and the trilogy, culminate in an act of God which
hinges on the intrusion of the director himself, who decides the final
fate of his characters.</P>
<P>     Although Kieslowski obviously finds something fascinating in the
face of Irene Jacob (which is honestly the glue holding this film
together), one is tempted to draw the conclusion that it's
Trintignant's misanthropic old judge--who conspires to manipulate his
own cast of characters--that the director feels the closest affinity
with.  It's a very good sign, then, that the embittered judge finds
some measure of satisfaction and redemption at the end of _Red_ (which,
incidentally, Kieslowski claims is his last film).  Kern has a pointed
conversation with Jacob at one point, asking her why she stopped to
pick up the dog and take it to a doctor.  Was it to help the dog, he
wants to know, or was it to make herself feel better, less guilty? By
the end of the film, the judge will be asking himself the same question
about his own contrivance, one that is key for Kieslowski, who has said
in interviews that he has come to believe people are inherently
selfish.*  Critics have complained that Kieslowski's films are reliant
on coincidence and overblown ideas about Destiny, but it's a moot
complaint when the director is so honest about his role as grand
manipulator of his own world, weaving his presence thematically into
the work.  The culmination of his masterful Three Colors trilogy
suggests there is Something Larger than Kieslowski's characters.
Whether that is the Deity or simply the Director is left for us to
decide.</P>
