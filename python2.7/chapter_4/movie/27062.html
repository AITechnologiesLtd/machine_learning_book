<P>_Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon_ (PG-13) **** (out of ****)</P>
<P>The martial arts film has always generally been written off as being the
cinematic equivalent of junk food.  The term often used for the genre,
"chopsocky," perfectly expresses this perception; the word sounds fun,
but it also sounds rather silly and inconsequential.  There's no denying
the amusement to be had with, say, an average Jackie Chan film, but is
there any real nourishment that comes with the enjoyment?  Not
especially.</P>
<P>With credits ranging from the Taiwanese family dramas
_The_Wedding_Banquet_ and _Eat_Drink_Man_Woman_ to the slice of '70s
Americana _The_Ice_Storm_ and the Jane Austen adaptation
_Sense_and_Sensibility_, director Ang Lee would appear an unlikely person
to helm what would be typically classified as a kung fu flick; in fact,
given his award-winning oeuvre, such a film seems beneath him.  As it
turns out, however, Lee is not only a lifelong fan of the genre, his
greatest filmmaking goal was to make a lavish martial arts epic. 
Watching _Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon_, the fruition of that dream,
it's clear that all of Lee's previous (and largely terrific) work has
been a mere warm-up to this staggering accomplishment.  _Crouching_Tiger_
is even more than an exhilarating reinvigoration of the martial arts
movie--it's a thrilling testament to the transporting power of film.</P>
<P>Note the term "reinvigoration" as opposed to "reinvention," for in
keeping with being a reverential fan, Lee doesn't tamper with time-worn
convention in adapting Wang Du Lu's 18th Century-set novel (the fourth in
a series of five).  Basic plot strands bear the air of the familiar. 
After many years of legend-building combat, famous and feared warrior Li
Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) is ready to give up his violent ways--that is,
after completing one last mission: avenging the murder of his master at
the hands of the notorious criminal known as Jade Fox.  But Li is ready
to make one major gesture toward a different life, and that is giving up
his fabled sword, the Green Destiny to a friend.  Soon after it is placed
in the trophy case of respected leader Sir Te (Lung Sihung), the Green
Destiny is stolen, and Li and his longtime friend and former combat
partner Yu Shu Lien's (Michelle Yeoh) quest to recover it is the mere
jumping-off point for a sweeping tale of action, intrigue, and romance.</P>
<P>One of _Crouching_Tiger_'s most noteworthy elements is the first-ever
screen pairing of two of Hong Kong cinema's biggest stars, Yeoh and Chow.
 Surprisingly, these iconic figures actually take secondary positions to
beautiful young newcomer Zhang Ziyi.  As Jen, the seemingly innocent and
innocuous daughter of prominent political figure Governor Yu (Li Fa
Zeng), Zhang is a real find, holding her own in all aspects and carrying
the picture with ease once the focus settles squarely on her.  The
conflicting forces battling for influence over Jen's soul is
_Crouching_Tiger_'s main concern, and without an actress as gifted and
captivating as Zhang in the pivotal role, it's difficult to imagine the
story being quite as engrossing involving as it is.</P>
<P>That said, there's no discounting the invaluable contribution Yeoh and
Chow make to the film.  They prove to be a most dynamic duo in every way,
even displaying sides of their ability that they've never had an
opportunity to reveal before.  The ever-charismatic and commanding Chow,
making his bow in this type of action film, proves to be as natural with
a sword as he is with a gun (his usual cinematic weapon of choice); but
granted, his stunts aren't as heavy duty as those of Yeoh, who is given
ample opportunity to show off and even elevate her well-established
athleticism and grace in the spectacular fights staged by the renowned
martial arts choreographer Yuen Wo-Ping.  But the two are even more
impressive in the dramatic scenes.  They have a nicely understated
chemistry that lends heartrending pathos to their characters'
relationship.  Li and Shu Lien have long been in love, but they've denied
their passion in honor of the memory of Shu Lien's late fiancé, a brother
by oath to Li.  Their tortured longing is subtly, wrenchingly conveyed in
Yeoh and Chow's vividly expressive eyes.</P>
<P>Scripters Wang Hui-ling, Tsai Kuo-jung, and James Schamus (Lee's regular
writing collaborator) ultimately address a number of weighty themes in
_Crouching_Tiger_, but they and Lee don't make their points without
having fun along the way.  A lot of fun.  The story is essentially
serious, but the film has a healthy, self-aware sense of humor about
itself, best exemplified by the parallel romance between Jen and Lo
(Chang Chen), a desert-dwelling bandit.  The circumstances behind their
meeting are wholly comical; she chases after him for an insane distance
after he steals... her comb.  Ridiculous, yes; but the light touch is
beguiling and completely convincing, befitting the playfulness of a
young, impetuous love.</P>
<P>Of course, most of the fun comes from the electrifying and boundlessly
imaginative action sequences, which further maintain the film's fidelity
to genre tradition by paying no heed to the laws of gravity.  The film's
first showpiece, an extended chase/fight across many Peking rooftops, is
a jaw-dropper guaranteed to get every audience around the world to burst
into awestruck applause.  Even more unbelievable than this sequence is
the fact that this is only the starting point.  To say more is to rob a
bit of the wonder of the thrills Lee and Yuen conjure up; suffice it to
say, they regularly defy and surpass expectations.  In terms of
bread-and-butter fighting, Yuen outdoes himself, and Lee shoots the
action in such a way that every balletic, meticulously choreographed move
is made clear and thus lent maximum impact.</P>
<P>That impact stays with you long after _Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon_
is over, but what leaves an impression even more enduring than the
spectacular action, breathtaking images (captured by cinematographer
Peter Pau), and lovely melodies (composed by Tan Dun) are the
people--their personalities, their emotions, their struggles, the hard
lessons that they learn.  Exciting, funny, uplifting, heartbreaking--the
list of descriptions can go on and on, yet all that is the magnificent
_Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon_ is easily encapsulated in one word:
masterpiece.</P>
