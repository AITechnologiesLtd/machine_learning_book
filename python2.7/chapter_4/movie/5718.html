<PRE>                                   SUPERCOP
                       A film review by John Robertson
                        Copyright 1996 John Robertson</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Stanley Tong</PRE>
<P>Starring: Jackie Chan, Michelle Khan, Maggie Cheung, Ken Tsang, Yuen Wah,
Bill Tung.</P>
<P>Perfect Person Rating*: The Perfect Person for Supercop is someone in the mood 
for an action film that doesn't pull any punches (or use stuntmen!), who also 
gets a kick out of campy humour and bad overdubbing.  This film's perfect 
person would give Supercop 10 out of 10.</P>
<PRE>----</PRE>
<P>For those whose first experience with Jackie Chan was this year's Rumble in 
the Bronx (Cannonball Run notwithstanding), Supercop will be both a surprise 
and a delight.  Everything that there was to love about Rumble in the Bronx, 
namely the action, the incredible fight choreography and the charisma of 
Jackie Chan, are to be found in Supercop.  The surprise for people familiar 
with Rumble is that Supercop is actually a much better movie.  Where Rumble 
was something of a comedy that scored many of its laughs through the absurdity 
of the plot and setting, Supercop is a more straightforward action flick in 
the summer blockbuster vein that gives you smiles along the way.</P>
<P>The plot of Supercop isn't too important, but a brief summary for those who 
are interested. Chan plays Kevin, a Hong Kong cop with an impressive resume in 
the martial arts.  He volunteers for a mission infiltrating a drug ring that 
has its tendrils spread all through southeast Asia.  He suceeds, and makes his 
way to the inner circle of the gang along with his sister "Hanna" (Michelle 
Khan), the second best thing about the movie (after Chan himself).</P>
<P>Supercop isn't a typical action movie, and one of the ways this is most 
apparent is the character played by Khan.  Most females in action movies are 
ornaments typically, who slow up the hero, trip when being chased, and maybe 
kick someone in the groin for humour near the end of the movie. Sure I'm over 
generalizing, but compared to Khan that's what every female action movie 
sidekick seems like.  She not only keeps pace with Chan in the fighting and 
humour department, she does her own stunts as well, and at least one of hers 
is better than anything Jackie does.</P>
<P>If you had to find a flaw with Supercop, you don't have to look far -- or 
listen far as the case may be.  Made in Hong Kong, the movie is overdubbed 
into English, but whoa, the audio on the dubbing is REALLY bad.  It sounds 
like it was done through a couple of tin cans tied together with string, and 
that's just not what you expect for your eight bucks. </P>
<P>Next movie Miramax decides to bring us from Chan's repetoire, I'll buy the 
microphones for the dubbing if they let me meet Jackie. :)</P>

<P>* Perfect Person Rating: The Perfect Person Rating is an attempt to give the 
reader a new way of understanding my rating. Rather than give a film a score, 
either overall, or on several attributes, the Perfect Person Rating tries to 
identify the type of person would enjoy this movie the most. Since a reviewer 
is by nature someone with a great deal of experience in what they are 
reviewing, their experience may not be the same as someone who has less 
experience, is less jaded, or more attuned to the subject. Hopefully the 
Perfect Person Rating will go further toward eliminating reviewer bias than a 
simple rating scale. Comments are appreciated. </P>
