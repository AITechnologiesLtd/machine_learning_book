<PRE>THE GOLDEN BOWL
---------------</PRE>
<P>American Charlotte Stant (Uma Thurman) is in love with Italian Prince
Amerigo (Jeremy Northam, "An Ideal Husband"), but she doesn't have the money
he needs to restore his beloved family Palazzo.  With the help of 
Fanny Assingham (Anjelica Huston) he becomes betrothed to Maggie Verver 
(Kate Beckinsale, "The Last Days of Disco"), daughter of America's first
billionaire Adam Verver (Nick Nolte), a school chum of Charlotte's.  Fanny
advises Charlotte that her acquaintance with Amerigo will be kept from the
Ververs.  In order to remain close to Amerigo, Charlotte nabs Maggie's
widowed 
father and begins a complex game of lies and deceit in the latest Merchant 
Ivory adaptation of a Henry James novel, "The Golden Blow."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>The titular golden bowl is a gold encrusted piece of crystal presented
to Charlotte as a possible wedding gift by an antiques merchant.  Amerigo,
who has accompanied her, advises outside the shop that the crystal is
cracked.  While Amerigo appears to be content with his lovely, innocent
young wife, Charlotte will not let him go and Maggie's devotion to her 
father allow the foursome to pair up according to Charlotte's desires.
Charlotte's passion for Amerigo makes her deaf to gossip, but her husband
is not as blind as she might think.  His veiled warnings to her go unheeded,
but Amerigo is quick to pick up on his father-in-law's doublespeak.</P>
<P>This lusty, modern adaptation by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala gives the art house
crowd a period soap opera to relish.  James' story casts Charlotte the
villain of the piece on a surface level, but some consideration makes one 
begin to doubt - hasn't Amerigo betrayed everyone, and for money no less,
while Charlotte is motivated by love?</P>
<P>Uma Thurman forgoes her usual pallid, somnambular style and sinks her teeth 
into her meatiest role since "Pulp Fiction."  If she seems overtly modern 
and out of control, those are qualities that make Charlotte such a hair 
trigger, allowing the film to build up to a squirmy level of tension.  Nick
Nolte, who had the misfortune being cast in the lead of Merchant Ivory's least
successful film "Jefferson in Paris," rises to the occasion here.  Adam
seems the stereotypical, open, easy-going, buried-in-work American, but 
Nolte allows the shrewdness to wink out at us even as his costars accept
his oblivious good nature.  Beckinsdale is terrifically appealing as the
naive Maggie.  The sweetness she brings to the role emphasizes the
underhandedness she's dealt.  The English Northam is believable as an Italian
aristrocrat, but he's a bit too opaque, not enough an object of such desire.
Anjelica Huston can't quite decide on her accent (she seems distinctly
Southern
American in her initial scene), but does the hand-wringing thing well as her
cover-up breaks down.  James Fox ("The Remains of the Day") is a comic asset 
as her husband, Colonel Bob Assingham.</P>
<P>Director Ivory borrows from Jane Campion's "Portrait of a Lady" flourishes,
using period title cards, old stills and period-look news footage to move
his tale along.  A secret meeting between Charlotte and Amerigo at a wax
museum is heightened when the eyes from a tableau seem to follow the
duplicitous couple, yet a horrific tale from Amerigo's ancestry used to 
bookend the film is heavy handed.  Costume, art direction and locations are 
lush beyond measure and a treat for the eye.</P>
