Starring Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson, Ellen DeGeneres, Jenna 
Elfman, Rob Reiner. Rated PG-13</PRE>
<P>Peruse through Ron Howard's legacy and you'll find few smudges. From the 
titillating Ransom, to the awe-inspiring Apollo 13 and Cocoon, he's 
brought us quality yet unpretentious entertainment through his years as 
a director, a producer and a writer (and who could forget his stint as 
Richie Cunningham on Happy Days?). But everyone of his followers knew 
that, like every great director, he wouldn't be able to keep his lucky 
streak alive forever (remember Steven Spielberg's 1941? Francis Ford 
Coppola's Jack?). As luck would have it, the place where Howard's train 
derails is the moronic new comedy EDtv. Not only does this film have the 
dubious distinction of beating a great concept straight into the ground, 
but it also does it with no dignity whatsoever.20
How does Matthew McConaughey's career continue? He's been universally 
panned, he can't act, and he has single-handedly spoiled (or at least 
reduced the quality of) almost every film I've seen him in. But continue 
his career does, and everyone who sees EDtv will wish that it didn't. He 
stars as Ed, a video store clerk selected by a struggling cable network 
to be on tv 24 hours a day, with his whole life in continuous live 
broadcast. This, of course, involves cameramen following him around 
everywhere he goes, which, understandably, presents some problems for 
him and the people around him.20</P>
<P>At first, Ed jumps at the chance to become famous and wealthy. And for a 
few months he wallows in being begged for autographs, being nationally 
recognized and getting huge bonus payments. He has fun with the 
cameraman who have the unenviable task of staying with him all day and 
all night. But then, things start to get out of whack. His girlfriend 
(Jenna Elfman) dumps him because of lack of privacy. His brother writes 
a book entitled "My Brother Pissed on Me." His family becomes alienated. 
He wants to quit, but will the network let him?20</P>
<P>Of course, this is a great opportunity to present some anti-media social 
commentary. And you know what? This whole thing sounds a bit like that 
little movie that we all saw last year called The Truman Show, doesn't 
it? Yes, comparisons to that masterpiece are inevitable. While Truman 
presents its themes with maturity, subtlety and hilarity, EDtv is 
childish, in-your-face and dull. Truman did not scream "Mass-media is 
bad" at its audience. EDtv pummels the audience with images of people 
shielding their faces from cameras while dramatic music plays. When you 
compare the two films, the latter is almost insulting.20</P>
<P>All of this wouldn't be so bad if the characters were compelling or if 
the film was funny. No such luck. Ed is not even a character but a 
nebulous representation of your everyday, happy-go-lucky guy. 
Unfortunately he is also a total and complete loser. He has no life and 
few friends. He talks like he's drunk and he's not funny or interesting 
in any conceivable way. This makes the already very weak film completely 
collapse. Think of a 2-hour film centered around one person who you'd 
rather not spend 2 hours with, and you'll be thinking of EDtv.20</P>
<P>The failure of Ed the character and EDtv the movie can be at least 
partly blamed on the failure of McConaughey in the lead (what do you 
mean, "What else is new"?). Certainly anyone else (Jim Carrey, for one, 
ridiculous as the suggestion is) could have done at least a slightly 
better job portraying the protagonist of this lame picture, or at least 
as good a job as the god-awful script would permit. The supporting 
actors fare slightly better. Woody Harrelson as the brother whom Ed 
pissed on is equally horrible, but Ellen DeGeneres and Rob Reiner as 
studio executives are occasionally funny.20</P>
<P>This is a very, very bad film. But somehow I feel that there is more at 
stake here than millions of people wasting two hours of their lives. The 
problem is that thanks to EDtv, in the future, any filmmaker that 
attempts a film about a person trapped in a tv world will likely be 
beating a dead horse. The Truman Show presented the concept. 
Pleasantville reinforced it. EDtv grabbed it by the throat and pounded 
it's metaphorical head against the ground</P>
