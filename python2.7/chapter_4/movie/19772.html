Not Rated (some sexuality)</P>
<P>Why do people buy antiques?  They're old and frayed materials that have
passed through time, faded by each passing year.  We pay gigantic sums
of money to obtain them, receiving what can easily be called
disposable.  In The Red Violin, an auction is being held and many people
ferociously covet a centuries-old violin; one that has been restored,
but nevertheless, is worn.  They all desire this relic for different
reasons.  They know something about it.  It has been touched by history,
by their ancestors, by those they profoundly admire.  Francois Girard's
flawed but pleasing film, The Red Violin, discusses this and more- the
yearning for "perfection," as Roger Ebert pointed out; and the need and
importance of music and an emotional outlet.</P>
<P>The film follows the journey of this red violin, from its native Italy
to when it resides in Communist China.  The violin's odyssey begins in
Italy, where a pregnant woman, Anna Bussotti, has just discovered from
her fortune-telling servant that she will have a difficult, possibly
fatal, childbirth.  Her husband, Nicolo, a man who makes violins for a
living, has made a beautiful one for his coming baby.  When Anna dies
from labor difficulties and the baby dies too, Nicolo bathes this
priceless violin in her blood.  It is then shipped to an Austrian
monastery.  For a century, it is used for teaching little boys how to
play, until finally it comes into the hands of a very young musician, a
boy, Kasper Weiss,  who is possibly as precocious as Mozart was.  He is
nurtured by Georges Poussin, who auditions him in front of royalty.
>From there, the violin comes into the hands of gypsies in England and
then to a famous, genius musician, Frederick Pope, who is inspired by
the violin's utter perfection to begin playing it again.  He woos his
women and makes love to them with this instrument.  The red violin turns
up, later, in China during the Cultural Revolution, where a woman must
hide it from Western-hating officials.  Its final stop is at the home of
the auction, Canada, where it is discovered after being much sought
after, and is restored and about to be sold.</P>
<P>All the people who gather at the auction to purchase this artifact are
aware of its importance, that it has journeyed several continents and
countries and has been in the hands of such famous and prodigious people
as Frederick Pope.  A pair of Chinese people are after it because of its
history in China; one man longs for it because it has been used by
Pope.  So much emotion has been poured into and been released through
this instrument, "the perfect marriage of science and beauty."  The
violin has been painted with a woman's own blood, the maker's muse and
wife.  It is not insignificant.  In Austria, it was played by a small
little boy who could have resulted into great and famous things had he
not died.  Kasper's performances were startlingly superb, filled with
longing and vibrancy.  This orphan expressed his sadness and loneliness
through the instrument.  When it was found with gypsies, it was one of
the only things that brightened up their lives.  Pope used it to express
his sexual desires and lusts.  His orgasmic playing was inspired by
making love to his women; he played while having sex.  In China, it is
the one greatness in the cloudiness of Communism.</P>
<P>Samuel L. Jackson has a little role here as a collector who lusts after
it more than anyone- not only does he want it for its historical
context, he also thinks it is the most "beautiful acoustic machine" ever
made and he wishes to share this with his daughter, his family, pass the
soul of Anna Bussotti and history and continents down.</P>
<P>The Red Violin also tells of the need for perfection, for music, for
uplifting.  The symbol of perfection for those attending the auction is
Bussotti's violin and the cinematography aids in making the instrument
seem priceless; meticulously and closely inspecting its lines, wood,
strings, the red color.  The Red Violin is about the need and wish to
preserve this perfection, to never let it die.  When a violin is
confiscated by Communist officials in China from a music teacher, he
wearily throws it into the fire.  He is infinitely glad when he learns
that this instrument is still alive in China, the woman who owns the red
violin gives it to him as a present.  The score is wonderfully
evocative; the little orphan in Austria doesn't speak much, but we
understand him clearly through his glorious violin performances.</P>
<P>There are flaws, of course, in the film.  There is a particularly erotic
scene in which Frederick Pope is making love to his girlfriend; as she
kisses him, he plays fiercely, aroused- spelling, musically, his passion
and gratification.  I wish the film had made the sexual details elusive;
it would have been more intense and interesting to listen to the music
alone instead of hearing the music and seeing the activities producing
its ardent quality simultaneously.  The imagery gets in the way of the
powerful violin.</P>
<P>There is also a supernatural subplot that is painfully obvious in its
absurdity.  The fortune-teller, who is intercut with the violin's
journey and the auction, throughout the film, tells that whoever comes
in contact with Anna Bussotti will have tragedy befall them.  When the
violin, drenched in her blood, is in the hands of players, they die soon
later.  This adds childishness and silliness to otherwise serious and
sophisticated material.</P>
<P>I especially enjoyed the scenes in which the violinists perform.  They
are obviously playing with all their heart and soul; they breathe
deeply, in and out, frequently, as if all their strength and emotions
are fueling the music's fire.  The Red Violin is mightily ambitious: is
in five languages and more than five countries.  It attempts to document
the life of this gem, this invaluable violin that has touched and
brought harmony, passion, and fervor to the lives of unhappy people.  It
has gone through centuries of war, sex, and deceit.  The Red Violin
borders on greatness and mediocrity, pushing more towards the mediocre;
but what is great about it: its mapping of the human desire, is more
than sufficiently absorbing.</P>
