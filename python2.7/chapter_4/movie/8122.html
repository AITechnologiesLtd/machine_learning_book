<PRE>BEAN 1997
 A film review by Timothy Voon
Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast : Rowan Atkinson - Mr. Bean,  Larry Drake, Johnny Galecki,
Richard Gant, Andy Lawrence, Peter MacNicol, Sandra Oh, Pamela Reed,
Tricia Vessey, Harris Yulin. Directed by Mel Smith. Written by Richard
Curtis (I), Robin Driscol.</P>
<P>Bean fans, he's here! Billed as the 'Ultimate Disaster Movie', when in
truth this is the 'Pen-Ultimate Disaster Movie.' Move over Twister,
Volcano and up-coming Titanic, make-way for Bean - the man who can
generate laughs with the cataclysmic propensity of Hiroshima.</P>
<P>Yes, it was funny. Watch out U.S.A. here comes the infestation known
as Bean. He's ugly and mean, pays little respect to customs, or
hygiene. Beware this lean, mean, fighting machine known as Bean,
coming your way October.</P>
<P>Watch the Bean reduce a 50 million painting of ‘The Whistler's Mother'
into a caricature of 'Hagar', and hear his insightful thoughts on the
painting after. He makes Tom Cruise look like an amateur, when it
comes to a 'Mission Impossible' break-in, with only the use of a skate
board, laxatives, eggs and underwear. Witness the life-saving
techniques of Bean as he removes bullets from downed cops, and the
'Bean-Defibrillator Method' of arousing coma victims; and at the end
of the day watch him warm the hearts of his audience, as he brings a
broken family together again.</P>
<P>Comment: Bean is his name. Disaster is his game. Hear him roar!</P>
