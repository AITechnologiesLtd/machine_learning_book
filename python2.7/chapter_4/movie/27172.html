<P>   While this year's character played by Tom Hanks, Chuck
Noland, found a spot of land undiscovered and free even of
bird life, a journey such as his is impossible in the U.S.  The
great historian, Frederick Jackson Turner, pronounced the
American frontier closed as of 1890, presumably leaving
some of the Cook Islands as the only area short of Mars that
has not been inhabited by humankind.  So what's a fella to
do if he's looking for wide open spaces, passionate romance,
and a chance to carve out a life free of the 5 o'clock rush-
hour traffic?  For John Grady Cole (Matt Damon), the central
figure of Cormac Mcarthy's major novel which has been
adapted to the screen by Ted Talley, the answer seems
clear.  He is in line to inherit a nice piece of Texas ranch
land, but when his grandpa dies and his absent mother sells
the land out from under him, he has no place to go.  No
place, that is, until he notes that all he had to do was cross
what amounted to a puddle of water ironically called the Rio
Grande and head out to the still not-so-developed Mexico.</P>
<P>   The adventures that befall Cole and hs best buddy Lacey
Rawlins (Henry Thomas) as they head out to the new frontier
in 1949 are the stuff of this film helmed by Billy Bob
Thornton, whose aim seems to be to capture the precious
dialogue in the McCarthy novel while showing his audience a
picture of post-World War II frontier life uncluttered by the
high melodrama of 1950's American Westerns.  No general
stores with barrels of food along the main street, no bars with
assertive women named Kitty, no duels at high noon here. 
Unfortunately, however, what is intended to be art is just
another horse opera made in an understated and
underproduced manner to give the viewer the impression that
he is looking at virtuosity.  Since the Romeo-and-Juliet
romantic interest that develops midway through the story
between Cole and the rich and forbidden Alejandra (Penelope
Cruz) is only about as fiery as the first sparks set off by
Chuck "Flintstone" Noland while rubbing sticks together on
his South Pacific island, and since the drama comes to
cinematic life only twice when an unfortunate fellow is
dragged away for execution and Cole must defend himself in
a prison fight, "All the Pretty Horses" gives us ample time to
concentrate on the title characters of the movie and put the
laconic human beings out of our thoughts.</P>
<P>   The journey of self-discovery on foreign land finds Cole
and Rawlins meeting up with the sixteen-year-old Jimmy
Blevins (Lucas Black), who is riding what they suspect is a
stolen animal.  Horsing around with him, they agree to let him
join the trek only to find that he becomes the source of much
of their troubles.  Cole and Rawlins are hired as help on a
prosperous ranch owned by the English-speaking Rocha
(Ruben Blades), giving Rocha's daughter the opportunity to
cast her come-hither eyes on the handsome young gringo,
Cole.  Engaging in forbidden love, Cole winds up in jail
together with Rawlins, where the former must prove his
manhood in the obligatory fight, which is well staged involving
a choreographed exit from the dining tables by all prisoners
save Cole and the man who is expected to kill him.</P>
<P>   Filmed by Barry Markowitz in a surprisingly conventional
manner with obligatory filtered National Geographic-style
shots on the rugged, uninviting landscape, "All the Pretty
Horses" fails to capture the nuances of the McCarthy novel,
particularly the humorous moments.  Despite that, the film is
overly talky, the adventurers expressing their sophomoric
dreams for the lives the want to lead.  A negative product
placement for the Mexican Tourist Board, "All the Pretty
Horses" is pretty much a neigh.</P>
