<P>War is hell.  A point that very few, from whatever side of the fence you
reside, will disagree with.  A seemingly pointless, senseless loss of life,
all to attain an objective that they do not understand, or even believe in. 
Anyone who doubts or disputes any of those statements, should sit through a
viewing of Saving Private Ryan.  If you can, and still hold your belief that
war isn't a tragedy, for which the payoff sometimes doesn't seem worth        the
journey, then, I pity you.</P>
<P>Spielberg's vision of war, the most unabashed, undaunting, uninhibited that
I've seen in a while (albeit, not being a fan, nor frequent viewer of war
movies, I can't compare this fairly against them).  The much-talked about
opening scenes, difficult to express in words because of the intensely
emotional vision painted, are worthy of the talk.  They are graphic, tragic,
maybe a bit over the top, but if that is the way that war really was, then I
have an even stronger found respect for those who went through it.  Being a a
veteran of war (albeit comparing my experiences to these, would be like
comparing my one year of Little League, to that of the New York Yankees, by
saying.."Yeah, I played baseball") I can understand and respect some of the
ideals, sentiments,a nd thoughts expressed.  We often wondered (as the
characters do) what's the purpose, is it worth it, questions, that have been
asked through time, and may never have an answer, but this movie tries.</P>
<P>It is brutally honest, straightforward, it is drawn out at times, overly
emotional and lingering at others.  It pulls no punches, reaches into your
soul and brings you there, makes you feel it.  The sounds are all around you,
the visions are exquisite (kudos to cinematographer Jarusz Kaminski, this
movie looks amazing, with some memorable shots), the horror of it all, right
in your lap.</P>
<P>The story involves a team of soldiers, sent to retrieve the lone surviving
brother, of 4, who is somewhere in France during the Normandy invasion of
1944.  Granted, you know what's going to happen, but you just don't know how,
and that is where this movie succeeds.        You are stuck, on the journey, like
it, or not, and the only resolution, is to complete the mission.</P>
<P>The performances, are thoroughly effective as well.  Hanks, is, well, he's
Tom Hanks, he can do epics in his sleep, and he turns another effectively
emotional, but not overly mind blowing (see Forrest Gump) performance. The
remainder of the group, Tom Sizemore, in the best performance yet of his
career, as the loyal grizzled sidekick.  Edward Burns, the talented actor-
director (see Brothers McMullen) as a the required tough Brooklyn-ite (do all
war movies need the token New Yorker) pulls off the doubting Thomas role with
a street tough sentiment.  Of course the hunk-o-the-moment Matt Damon, who
really isn't given much to do, but has an effective presence, and some well-
placed cameos from Ted Danson, and Paul Giamatti (on a role since Howard
Stern phone-whipped him in Private Parts) keep the movie flowing.  But the
kudos in this one, goto a trio of unknowns, Jeremy Davies (The Locusts) as
the reluctant interpreter, Giovanni Ribisi, as the emotional medic, and Barry
Pepper as the sniper, with God on his side.  These three young stars make a
presence, and add to the emotional intensity of this movie, by being
seemingly the most real of the group.</P>
<P>Clocking in at just under three hours, you tend to lose yourself a bit, but
that's the way war was, it was long, it was tiring, and it wasn't pretty or
simple.  This movie is not for the weak of heart, or stomach.  It will
effective reach inside you, leave a bit of itself in you afterwards.  Is it
the best movie of the summer, probably not, as some will say..I won't jump on
the Oscar bandwagon yet, too early.  But in a summer full of brainless,
plotless, emotionless wastes of celluloid, this one stands out as an
effective, if not educational and emotional, way to spend an afternoon.  I
would suggest this one be viewed on the big-screen, in all it's epic glamour.</P>
