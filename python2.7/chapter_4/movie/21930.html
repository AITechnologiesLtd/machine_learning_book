<P>>From writer and director Darren Stein comes Jawbreaker, the poorly told tale of
what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong.  At Reagan High,
four girls are sitting on top of the world.  Courtney Shane, played by Rose
McGowan, holds the title of meanest, most disrespectful soul in the school. 
Everyone hates her, but everyone envies her due to her popularity.  Courtney is
the "leader" of her clique, which also includes Julie, played by Rebecca
Gayheart, Liz Purr, played by Charlotte Roldan, and Marcie, played by Julie
Benz are the other three in the group.  It is Liz's seventeenth birthday, and
Julie, Courtney, and Marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent
prank on her, but the prank results in the death of Liz.</P>
<P>Just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one, the foursome
decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone
else.  And also just like in other teen directed movies, one of the four don't
agree with hiding it, this time that character being Julie.  And finally, just
like in other teen movies, there is a witness outside the group trying to hide
the truth.  This time that character being Fern Mayo (Judy Greer), who is
subject to many cracks from Courtney's group, as well as the entire school. 
>From here, Jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge, bad morals, and
at least trying to do the right thing.</P>
<P>Not only is the script weak, on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large
amount of the main cast.  Judy Greer is undeniably awful as her one
dimensional, annoying character, as she overacts every line she has.  Also on
the bad side of acting is Julie Benz, almost falling to the annoying factor
that Greer delivers.</P>
<P>On the positive side of acting, Rose McGowan performs well here, but doesn't
match her wickedly clever performance as "Tatum", in 1996's Scream. McGowan's
role is annoying, but this only adds to the film.  She is wickedly mean, and
even though she a well-written character, you downright hate her.  Faring even
better than McGowan is Rebecca Gayheart, who is always exceptionally believable
as her roles.  When the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character,
she turns it into three, always putting strong emotion and power into her
roles.  Gayheart isn't given as much to do here as she was in 1998's Urban
Legend, but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in
Jawbreaker.</P>
<P>Jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout, hardly throwing
anything for the viewer to get absorbed in.  We get way off of the topic of the
jawbreaker incident, and get into things that don't have anything to do with
the actual film.  The beginning and ending are strong, it's just the middle
that needs a lot of help.  During the body of the movie, it is undeniably
repetitive, never progressing towards a conclusion.  Nothing to grab the
viewer's interest is around, and the same, extremely annoying song plays over
and over again. </P>
<P>Jawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film
Clueless, but falls flat.  The few gags that actually work die off quickly and
die off with a bang.  All in all, a horrible disappointment.  </P>
<P>The Bottom Line: The tagline reads, "Even the sweetest candies are sour as
death inside."  Yes, that is too true.  No matter how good this film may have
looked, it fails to deliver.</P>
