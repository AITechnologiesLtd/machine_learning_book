<PRE>                             THE SECRET GARDEN
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1993 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     Although I have not read it, I understand the children's book THE
SECRET GARDEN to be a cloying, precious story of a young girl's
restoring herself and her crippled cousin through a secret, magical
garden she restores.  I expected this film to be a particularly
effective adaptation of this book to the screen, because of its
direction (by Agnieszka Holland, who did EUROPA, EUROPA and OLIVIER,
OLIVIER) and its production (from Francis Ford Coppola's studios,
Zoetrope)--as well as because of the preview, which presents the film
from this point of view.</P>
<P>     But instead, this film is the sort that comes along every only
every ten years or so; true, competent, professional cinematic art.
Uniquely, to my knowledge, Holland has achieved this level of art in a
movie that can be appreciated by anyone, from a child to an adult.  It
is a remarkable accomplishment, which I think puts Holland on the level
as the finest directors.</P>
<P>     She does this by interpreting the novel in a very realistic and
child-oriented way. Children see the world very differently from
adults, and not at all in the sweet and precious way we like to think;
they believe in magic, not always the good kind (e.g., LORD OF THE
FLIES), and for them young animals are not only cute, but also models
and symbols of growth and fecundity.</P>
<P>     Holland incorporates many references to the young girl's emerging
sexuality without ever seeming heavy-handed or obvious about it. It is
not accidental that the accident that sends her back to England occurs
just after she has physically expressed her anger towards her parents,
seen them kissing, and hidden under the bed. But from the girl's point
of view these are real events, not symbols, and that is how Holland
presents them to us.</P>
<P>     Most of all, this is a really good movie. You will want to meet
these people, to see the garden.</P>
<P>     I don't remember the names of any of the actors or actresses,
except for Maggie Smith, who plays the evil governess of the
household.  But I especially liked the girl's maid, the girl, and the
young boy who helped her with the garden.  The maid, in particular,
stands out; I hope to see her again soon.</P>
