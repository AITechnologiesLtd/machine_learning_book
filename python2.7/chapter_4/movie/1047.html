<PRE>                               ONLY THE LONELY
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     ONLY THE LONELY is a film from John Hughes (co-producer) and Chris
Columbus (co-director).  The film stars John Candy, Maureen O'Hara, Ally
Sheedy, with Anthony Quinn and James Belushi.</P>
<P>     I recently asked in this newsgroup "Does anybody *like* John
Candy?" by which I meant does anyone find him a sympathetic screen
presence.  Some people enjoy laughing at him, some cannot abide him; but
I doubted that anyone wanted him as a personal friend.  Generally, I do
not enjoy Candy's good-hearted jerk; the last film in which I thought he
was even moderately successful was PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES with
Steve Martin; the scene when the two men wake up in bed together and
have to reestablish their heterosexual manliness is both funny and
telling.</P>
<P>     ONLY THE LONELY offered no such insights into men or women, or even
moms.  Mom may be a bitch, but only because she loves us.  End of
insight.  And certainly none of comic manicness of THROW MOMMA FROM THE
TRAIN.</P>
<P>     I went to ONLY THE LONELY to see Maureen O'Hara and anticipated a
certain amount of discomfort in the presence of Candy as the price to be
paid.  As it turned out, it was neither as bad as it might have been,
nor as good as it could have been.  Even O'Hara, fiery and vicious,
suffers from a script that gives her precious little motivation and
less history.  She's a bigot, an emasculator; but you know she's
basically ok underneath.  In the Hughes-Columbus world, everyone is
basically ok underneath, even Mom.  Still, O'Hara shines through the
limitations of the script; she's alive when the rest of the movie is
dozing.</P>
<P>     Candy tones down the Uncle Buck klutziness and becomes the
pushover.  He decides to assert himself against the wishes of the whole
world, but exactly why will remain a mystery, as will the related
questions of why now and not before.  Candy's acting skills are
sufficiently limited that if he's not doing some SCTV fat-jerk shtick
he's talking real slow and looking like a whipped puppy to register
sensitivity.  The result here is some glacial pacing and slippery
schmaltz.</P>
<P>     Ally Sheedy was supposed to be this major-league introvert, afraid
of the sound of her own voice.  Not only do we not know why, but we are
given no particular reason why she finds herself attracted to Candy or
increasingly able to assert herself.  At least she's a better actor than
Candy and seems to be maturing into someone that may prove to
interesting to watch on the screen.</P>
<P>     In supporting roles we have James Belushi, totally wasted as
Candy's meat-wagon partner.  God, I wish the script had done more one
joke on the subject of the meat wagon.  Or a subplot hinted at of
Belushi's relationship with rather alarming wife.  And then there is
Anthony Quinn, old, totally charming, quite sexy and seductive as he
pursues the unobtainable  O'Hara, who hates all Greeks (of course, Quinn
plays a Greek).  </P>
<P>     A friend of mine with a taste for sentimental movies loved this
one.  I did not totally hate ONLY THE LONELY.  Instead, I would
recommend that this might be a tolerable film to rent in video, but
don't pay even matinee prices for it.  There's not enough there there.</P>
