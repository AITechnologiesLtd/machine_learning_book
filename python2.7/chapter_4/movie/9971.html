<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   You knew it was bound to happen.  With the completely unanticipated
   degree of success enjoyed by Wes Craven's SCREAM from December 1996,
   it was just a matter of time before the revitalized teen slasher
   genre revved back into gear, and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER
   manages to be among the first to capitalize on the trend. As of this
   writing, it's an unqualified hit -- consider that it topped the
   domestic weekend tallies for its first three weeks; only
   megablockbusters MEN IN BLACK, LIAR LIAR, and STAR WARS: SPECIAL
   EDITION have done likewise in 1997 -- and it's sure to give
   credibility to the cost-effective strategy of raiding television
   shows for pretty young starlets in order to assemble an ensemble cast
   which will draw the youth demographic.  Putting aside the lawsuit
   from Miramax over I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER's advertising
   campaign (which touted the film as being from the creator of
   Dimension Films' SCREAM -- in this case, hot screenwriter Kevin
   Williamson penned both), Sony executives have to be grinning from
   ear to ear over the success of their horror entry.</P>
<P>   I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is fairly generic in scope -- it has
   the standard setup of a group of teens stalked by a homicidal madman
   -- and uses familiar scare tactics, but it's sort of fun in an
   offhanded way.  There are too many standard fright devices employed
   in the film (eyes suddenly opening with a startle, the presumed-dead
   lurching back to life, attackers popping out from the darkness -- any
   of this sound familiar?) to take it seriously; it's simple popcorn
   fun.  I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER obviously isn't as
   self-consciously knowing as SCREAM, but it's not aspiring to be as
   similarly clever.</P>
<P>   The film focuses on four teenagers reaching a pivotal moment in their
   young lives -- high school graduation, and the promise of bright
   futures ahead -- but it's really only interested in its female
   characters, best friends Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt from PARTY
   OF FIVE) and newly-crowned local beauty pageant queen Helen Shivers
   (Sarah Michelle Gellar, from the television series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE
   SLAYER).  As is often the case in modern slasher films, Julie and
   Helen serve both as the chief protagonists which drive the plot
   forward, and as the requisite lust objects; a profuse number of
   scenes in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER find its heroines either
   in swimsuits or scurrying about in revealing attire, and there's an
   abundance of tittilative cleavage shots (it's actually bemusing to
   observe how director Jim Gillespie strategically frames his shots).
   In fact, given the film's preponderance for ogling its pretty
   starlets, it's somewhat amusing that Bridgette Wilson, who plays
   Helen's older sister Elsa, is cast against type as a brainy,
   no-nonsense department store manager (fully clothed throughout, yet).</P>
<P>   After a cozy July 4th evening on the beach, complete with wistful
   introspection and boozing, Julie and Helen, and their respective
   beaus Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Barry Cox (Ryan
   Phillippe), pile into Barry's car and head home.  While driving back,
   Ray is distracted by Barry's drunken antics and plows into something
   in the road.  They all begin to panic when they realise that they've
   just run over someone, and after much frantic bickering, Barry
   convinces the group to dispose of the incriminating evidence by
   dumping the body into water.</P>
<P>   Jump forward to a year later.  The formerly tight-knit group has
   splintered apart after the incident, friendship giving way to guilt,
   bitterness, and resentment, and their once-promising futures have
   since dissipated: Helen's acting aspirations in New York flopped,
   and the beauty queen is reduced to manning the cosmetic counter at
   her family's department store; Ray toils as a fisherman. seemingly
   resigned to his lot in life; Barry staggers about on his family's
   estate in a haze; former scholar Julie crashed and burned in her
   freshman year at her prestigious Ivy League college.  Suitably gaunt
   and haunted, Julie returns back home to the North Carolina fishing
   community where a mysterious note awaits, predictably reading "I
   know what you did last summer!" (as opposed, I guess, to "You may
   have already won ten million dollars!")  In the wake of this ominous
   message, Julie reunites the reluctant clique in order to determine
   who's behind it.  And the killing begins...</P>
<P>   The costumed killer in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is decked out
   in full fisherman's garb, complete with slicker and hat, and wields
   a razor-sharp hook as his preferred instrument of death.  The film
   makes a point of obscuring the madman's face and coyly drops clues
   throughout in order to play up the mystery of his alter-ego, but
   ultimately I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER doesn't really play fair
   in terms of revealing the identity of the killer.  When The
   Fisherman is finally unmasked, one can sense a collective sentiment
   of Who Cares? erupting from the audience.</P>
<P>   For awhile, it appears as if I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is
   going to veer towards a more psychological approach to the plot --
   the depiction of the characters' lives irrevocably shattered by their
   murderous deed is effective, and they all seem to walk around as
   empty shells of their former selves.  Julie, who was the most adamant
   against dumping the body after the hit-and-run, appears the most
   tormented and harrowed of the group after the fact, and after
   one-third of the film, I almost expected a resolution involving a
   schizophrenic Julie to be behind it all, although shots of a
   weathered male hand grasping the Fisherman's hook sort of ruined that
   misguided notion.</P>
<P>   I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, then, is fairly conventional in
   terms of the handling its slasher elements, and Mr. Gillespie's
   feature debut is a competent if uneventful piece of work.  Although
   it can be difficult to generate real tension from such familiar
   scenarios -- I've honestly always wondered how a maniac, walking as
   if on a leisurely stroll, can *still* always seem to gain on the
   frantic, fleeing heroine --  his traditional handling of various
   sequences in the film doesn't help matters.  After a character
   endures a harrowing ordeal, when the film cross-cuts between the
   character finally within the reach of safety and the look of relief
   on the character's face, it's a telltale sign that something
   unfortunate might befall the character, and any opportunity for a
   shock or a surprise is consequently destroyed.</P>
<P>   The sequence which is the most effective in the film is the critical
   hit-and-run scene; the mounting tension and escalating sense of
   panic as the situation begins spiraling out of control is palpable,
   and as played by the lead actors, wholly credible and convincing.  I
   particularly enjoyed the touch of having the Barry character exclaim
   "My car!" in the aftermath of the collision, which is both darkly
   humourous and frankly authentic.</P>
<P>   In general, the performances from the ensemble cast of I KNOW WHAT
   YOU DID LAST SUMMER aren't outstanding, but generally appealing and
   perky.  While the leads are fine, the striking performance in the
   film is that of Anne Heche, who in a small role is disquietly creepy
   as Melissa Egan, the sister of the dead man fished from the water.
   After some nondescript performances earlier this year, it's a relief
   to see her return to form -- I was beginning to worry.</P>
<P>   As in SCREAM, Mr. Williamson includes some knowing references in his
   screenplay for I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (which he incidentally
   wrote during the SCREAM shoot) which are amusing.  There's a cute
   reference to Jodie Foster's Clarice in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS by
   the heroines as they nervously approach Melissa Egan's out-of-the-way
   house.  While he's an interesting writer and a particularly good
   scenarist, I still find much of Mr. Williamson's attempts at snappy
   teen dialogue to be particularly awkward.  Who wasn't wincing during
   SCREAM when Neve Campbell and Skeet Ulrich were exchanging clumsy
   dialogue about their is-it-an-R-or-is-it-a-PG-13 relationship?
   Along the same lines, in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, "You feel
   my pain" just doesn't cut it.</P>
<P>   I don't think it spoils much to reveal that after the film has
   culminated, there's a final coda in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER
   which is all too generic -- a standard last "Boo!" to leave the
   audience nervously tittering as they exit the theatres (much along
   the same vein as Julie Delpy's remarkably hairy chest in the
   oft-run trailer for the upcoming AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS).
   This coda teases at a sequel, which is par for the genre, but in this
   case, due to the film's surprisingly potent success, a sequel is
   indeed in the works.  As Mr. Williamson himself wrote, "Let's face it
   -- these days, you gotta have a sequel."</P>
