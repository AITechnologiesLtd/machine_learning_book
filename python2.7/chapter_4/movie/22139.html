<PRE>Night Of The Creeps
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Jason Lively; Steve Marshall; Jill Whitlow; Tom Atkins & Wally
Taylor</P>
<P>"What is this, a homicide or a bad b-movie?" That is the prophetic question
asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie. Let me
clear things up for you cupcake, this isn't a bad b-movie, it's a really bad
b-movie. So bad, it's almost good. Almost, but not quite. The movie starts
off in the 1950's with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to
Earth. It is a bunch of slug-like creatures that kill people and take over
their bodies. The slugs' first and only victim in the fifties is
cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody. That is, until two
loser university students unfreeze him in 1986. He, and the slugs inside
him, promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co-eds into slug
zombies. A slightly crazed cop (Tom Atkins) and the requisite girl with the
face of an angel (Jill Whitlow) join these two geeky university students
(Jason Lively and Steve Marshall) to do battle with the slugs. It more or
less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil
slugs.</P>
<P>The acting is bad with a capital B. The story is worse. And the special
effects are somewhere between an old rerun of Star Trek and what you see in
a home movie. The only saving grace was the requisite tit-shot courtesy of
Jill Whitlow. It had absolutely nothing to do with the story -- but I liked
it. Actually, it was the high point of the movie for me. Of course, that
isn't really saying much.</P>
<P>The story moves around in a hap hazard fashion. Which gives it a leg up on
some other horror films. Unlike most movies of this genre, there actually is
a story. Not a great one, but it is there. This is one in a long line of
movies from the 1980's that were thrown together to capitalize off the
success of the Friday The 13th, Halloween and Nightmare On Elm Street
movies. You could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you
local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not
better. But Night Of The Creeps might make a nice addition to a b-movie
horror marathon. Just don't be too upset if you can't find it. You really
won't be missing that much.</P>
