<P>     When we first meet Ethan Frome (Liam Neeson), he is a broken man
hobbling around town.  The new preacher takes an interest in him and
soon learns the tragic tale of Frome's life.  Years ago, as a younger
and more hale man, Ethan married Zeena (Joan Allen), perhaps
mistakenly, as "compensation" for her giving up part of her life to
nurse Ethan's mother.  Zeena, however, is a sickly woman and becomes
susceptible to almost every kind of illness.  When she proves unable to
adequately keep house, she calls on a poor cousin, Mattie (Patricia
Arquette), to come to help.  What Zeena cannot foresee is the
attraction that develops during the course of a year between her
husband and Mattie.</P>
<P>     While Richard Nelson's script for ETHAN FROME is faithful to the
overall tone and general storyline of the novel, there are some
differences.  The identity of the character probing into Ethan's past
has been changed.  In the book he is an engineer; in the film, a
preacher.  The other substantial alteration involves the eventual depth
of Ethan and Mattie's relationship.</P>
<P>     The plot is not intricate.  It contains elements of many
genres--mystery, drama, and romance--but none of these are overplayed.
In many ways, the strength of ETHAN FROME comes largely from its
essential simplicity.  There are no convoluted subplots to muddy the
waters and no large gallery of characters to keep us wondering who this
person or that person is.  We are given an opportunity to focus on
three people living one story.  We understand very quickly who they are
and what's going on.</P>
<P>     The greatest asset of ETHAN FROME, however, and the most essential
to successfully transferring the story from the written page to the
screen, is the acting.  Liam Neeson, an actor of ability, is
astoundingly convincing in this role.  Everything about him, from his
mimicking of the injured man's walk to the pained facial expressions in
numerous close-ups, shows how in touch he was with the role he was
playing.  Neeson took a serious reduction in pay to play the title
character and, as an audience, we are forever grateful for that.</P>
<P>     Patricia Arquette is not the most famous of the Arquettes, but her
performance here is more sincere and heartfelt than anything Rosanna
has ever done.  She has an expressive face.  There are scenes between
her and Neeson where dialogue is not needed.  An unlikely couple they
might be, but the chemistry between them works.</P>
<P>     Joan Allen has the role of the antagonist: a shrill, unpleasant
woman eaten away by sicknesses of the body and soul.  The creative team
behind the movie attempted to make Zeena less obviously wicked than she
is in the book.  Admittedly, they succeed in providing excellent
motivation for her nastiness, but the audience doesn't develop much
empathy--or sympathy--for her.  She is still the villain.</P>
<P>     ETHAN FROME is a deeply moving film.  Much of its power comes from
an unwillingness to hurry events along.  Everything is done
slowly--each scene takes its time to unfold.  Even so, the running time
of the movie is no longer than that of an average film, despite the
fact that its content is far from "average".</P>
<P>     This is not a movie for children.  Even though it is free from all
profanity, nudity, and overt sex, ETHAN FROME is not a good family film
because, frankly, those of a younger age will find it dreadfully
boring.  The picture is adult in nature, because it takes a mature
outlook--as well as a suitable attention span--to allow yourself to
become immersed in the magic that director John Madden has woven with
the help of a superlative cast.</P>
<PRE>                            Rating: 8.9 (A, ***1/2)</PRE>
