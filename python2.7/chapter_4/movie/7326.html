<PRE>                              LICENSED TO KILL
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     LICENSED TO KILL, not to be confused with the James Bond film
called LICENCE TO KILL, is a harrowing tale of violence against gays.
Documentarian Arthur Dong (COMING OUT UNDER FIRE) interviews 7
murderers inside various prisons.  The film could be considered their
brief autobiographies as Dong uses still photos of the murderers
growing up to make them seem more like flesh-and-blood people than
monsters locked behind bars.</P>
<P>     The inmates tell their stories matter-of-factly.  This casual
style represents the film's single biggest downfall.  Documentaries
need energy, or they can become as dry as reading a dictionary.  Dong's
questions too often illicit little interest from the prisoners.  An
interviewer with a more provocative style might have gotten the
prisoners to open up more emotionally.  All of this notwithstanding,
the film does end up exposing an important subject.</P>
<P>     The easiest way to view problems in our society is to relegate
them to the "couldn't happen here" category.  When you are sure that
some form of crime is being committed, but not in your neighborhood, it
becomes an abstract issue that can be conveniently ignored and shelved
into your tertiary memory.</P>
<P>     The scene in LICENSED TO KILL from nearby San Jose really brought
the film home for me.  A gay man there was constantly being harassed by
his neighbor, so the gay man set up a video camera in hopes that he
could finally prove his story.  As he was innocently watering his lawn,
his neighbor came out spewing homophobic epithets at him and then began
to beat him.</P>
<P>     The killers in the show are of different races and from various
parts of the country.  The only thing they share is a hatred of gay
people.  Some prisoners blame their hatred on a molestation incident in
childhood, but most seem proud to lay the blame on God's doorstep.
They have a confused understanding of religion and have decided that,
since homosexuality is immoral in their code of ethics, gay bashing and
murder are almost inevitable.  Most of the convicts show some remorse,
but none are particularly convincing.</P>
<P>     In one especially ironic interview, a prisoner rants and raves
about the lack of religion in the schools.  He attributes the decay of
society to the courts outlawing Christianity in the classrooms.  These
diatribes come from someone who seems to have an unswerving faith in
the "Nine Commandments."</P>
<P>     In the interview with convicted murderer Jeffrey Swinford, he
explains his nonchalant view of beating up gays and how his friends
would make a party of it.  "Like girls, you know, they would ride
along," he explains.  "You know, like cheerleaders -- 'Kick 'em in the
head' -- stuff like that.  We never done it for fun, you know.  We just
did it if we need money."</P>
<P>     LICENSED TO KILL runs just 1:20.  It is not rated but would be R
for its troubling and explicit pictures of people who have been beaten,
stabbed, or shot.  Teenagers need to be mature to be able to handle the
intensity of the images.  I recommend the documentary to you and give
it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
