<P>One of the major banes produced by the media revolution is so-called 
celebrities of all kinds. They are the good, the bad and the ugly; 
the objects of cult, of paparazzi and groceries' check-out counter 
tabloids, of most glossy magazines; they fill the airwaves; they 
regularly elbow out substantial news items; etc.</P>
<P>Per se, the "celebrity"-mania may not cause any major harm. But since 
human life and time are finite, the frills of  the excessive 
documenting of mostly entertainment figures has to be at the expense 
of more important knowledge and information. A vivid example of this 
is the Jay Leno show's sadly funny "Jaywalking" segments. (They are 
edited interviews, of course, and require that the people in them 
give permission --sign releases -- but is it not horrible that they 
accept to be idiots in public for the sake of being on TV?</P>
<P>On a more elevated level, too many college students who might be 
smart, and who almost all know by heart the names, performances and 
trivia of "celebrities," have lacked the time to learn (even 
slightly) general culture: history, geography, current events, 
literature, the arts and so on.</P>
<P>In fairness I must add that it was ever thus. College education is 
time-consuming; it offers limited opportunities for students to go 
beyond certain specialties. But then,  this state of things has 
reached exponentially abysmal proportions with the exponential rise 
of the media. Sadly too, while TV, the most influential of all, can 
also be also a major boon, an amazing and vivid source of learning, 
this very positive aspect of the media is far too little exploited. 
In fact, any polling of persons "being educated" reveals that
the small percentage of those who profit from 
educational/informational television consists overwhelmingly of older 
persons.</P>
<P>The same tragic situation applies to books, magazines, etc. You name 
it. And, alas, not only to the United States but to most, if not all, 
other countries.</P>
<P>Having gotten this off my chest I'll turn to "The Eyes of Tammy 
Faye." It is a documentary about "celebrity"  Tammy Faye Bakker, now 
Tammy Faye Bakker Messner. Its two directors (who seem to be Brits) 
are experienced in the genre. They are not impartial. They set out 
to redeem Tammy--or at the very least to induce in their public 
second thoughts about Tammy. The film goes overboard. The information 
that comes with it shows this clearly.</P>
<P>Examples: "Tammy is one of the most adored and reviled women of her 
time." Do the makers really believe that she was/is  a concern of 
most Americans, not to mention the rest of the planet?  They admit to 
having drawn an "  affectionate portrait."  But documentaries of this 
sort should not be partisan and take no sides openly, even though 
subliminally or indirectly documentaries always have a point of view 
(That's the old argument about "cinema verite")  Tammy is "both 
surprising and endearing." Says who? "The Bakkers were crucified in 
the court of public opinion for their supposed greed and corruption." 
If this is not a partisan opinion, what is? And so on.</P>
<P>Entertaining the film certainly is --and this is what makes me give 
it 2 1/2 stars. But it also falls between two stools. At first it 
seems to be akin to the satirical exposes by film-makers such as 
Michael Moore ("Roger and Me," " The Big One," et al.) But it rapidly 
evolves into a gentler, kinder portrait of Tammy and her adventures.</P>
<P>"Celebrities" can be, and often are, ridiculous figures. Make your 
own list. Tammy was and remains a Class A oddity who cannot be taken 
seriously as she recounts her life from its beginnings to the Odyssey 
of the Tammy-Jim Bakker duo, its rise and fall, to developments and 
updates through recent times.</P>
<P>The movie follows her mostly through interviews in which Tammy 
speaks to the camera.  Her interviewers are mostly unseen and unheard 
but many other "names" do appear and add their favorable, pro-Tammy 
opinions.</P>
<P>For many members of the movie's audience the main interest will be 
the light shed on the aspect of Americana known as televangelism. The 
couple's debut, in the 1960s, was when almost unknown Pat Robertson 
had them create for his own TV program in his one-station "network" a 
Jesus-based puppet show. (The puppets are in the film as 
chapter-announcers). Then the Bakkers invented  "The 700 Club,"  the 
first Christian talk-show.  Jealous of their success Robertson dumped 
the couple.</P>
<P>Moving to California the couple co-founded TBN, and were betrayed 
again. Moving on to North Carolina, they founded PTL (Praise the 
Lord), which became the jewel in their crown and was one of the very 
first 24-hour satellite networks.  Its thriving televangelism 
business culminated with the creation of the first Christian theme 
park, the mammoth Heritage USA.</P>
<P>Eventually came financial troubles, irregularities, deficits, money 
problems. Added to them was Jim Bakker's one-night stand with his 
employee Jessica Hahn (who later told her side of the story in 
Playboy). There also came research and exposes by the Charlotte 
Observer's reporter Charles F. Sheperd. All that spells scandal.</P>
<P>Hard-right televangelist Jerry Falwell now enters the picture. He had 
his own empire. Apparently he hated PTL because (among the reasons 
given by Tammy) he was against its all-embracing nature, its 
acceptance of  all denominations, of gays, addicts, and so on. And he 
had no satellite.</P>
<P>Oddly  (on the surface only) when PTL became a sinking Titanic, 
Falwell offered help, flew in to the rescue (in his private jet), 
made an offer that the Bakkers could not refuse: he promised money 
--and to get more funds, he said he would take over PTL for a short 
time only, to fix things, and so on.</P>
<P>As per Tammy, he cheated. Within a month he declared  PTL's 
bankruptcy, exposed the Bakkers' financial tangles, attacked Jim for 
his "homosexual audiences" and dishonesty ---and added one more 
betrayal to the J & T saga.  Falwell is the arch-villain of this 
story. There's no honor among thieves.</P>
<P>Soon after Jim was sentenced to 45 years in prison. The marriage 
dissolved. Tammy married their friend Roe Messner, the contractor of 
Heritage USA. Messner was also tried and sentenced to a sojourn in 
jail.</P>
<P>A tawdry tale, it keeps its steady focus on Tammy, a monument to bad 
taste in  makeup and vestimentary horrors. (At one point, her huge 
rings reminded me of gladiators' shields.) The camera and microphone 
show her as freaky but gutsy, pathetic (in both senses), with a 
meowing baby voice that matches her celebrated (in effect a huge joke 
to all but Tammy) treatment of her eyes. She speaks of her private 
troubles in an endless, often lachrymose litany :her betrayal by Jim, 
her drug addiction, her fight with colon cancer, her formerly 
alienated children, and much else. We follow her undaunted search for 
(un-realized or failed) Tammy-starring, outlandish TV shows (such as 
"Medicine Today with Tammy Faye") ,her singing, her recitations of 
her doggerel-plus poetry, her "beautification" for cameras, her 
visits to Oral Roberts University where she warbles ( the radio guy 
calls her "a fabulous singer" --sic) her determination to pull on 
heartstrings.</P>
<P>If this movie plays in Europe, where televangelism is still a rarity 
and a novelty, whether or not understood by non-Americans it is bound 
to become a mega-curiosity. That's another reason I rated it  **1/2 .</P>
<P>Tammy takes herself so very seriously that one might (or not) doubt 
her faith. There is a notable, disturbing passage when job-seeking 
Tammy talks about switching to "secular TV." Quote: " I am a very 
secular person. Christ is only part of me." And from start to finish, 
with the word "God"  kicked around as incessantly as a ball in a 
soccer game, one can't help thinking of the Commandment:</P>
<P>"You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; for the 
Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain. "</P>
