<PRE>"crazy/beautiful"</PRE>
<P>Rich girl meets poor boy and they fall into star-crossed love. This has
been the staple of movies and song for decades and the question usually is:
is he good enough for her? Director John Stockwell does a 180 on this theme
in a story about rich, troubled Nicole (Kirsten Dunst) and poor,
intelligent and hard-working Carlos who find love together, but now the
question is: is she good enough for him in "crazy/beautiful"?</P>
<P>Nicole Oakley is a pretty, troubled and troublesome 17-year old who is
emotionally estranged from her congressman father and her wealthy
stepmother. She is always getting into one jam after another, disdains her
prestigious Pacific High School and seems destined to self-destruct. Carlos
Nunez is a poor, inner city kid who has enough smarts to want to make
something of his life. He voluntarily busses himself, for two hours each
way, to the same school, works very hard and has plans to attend Annapolis
when he graduates. When the two meet, sparks fly, but Nicole's past and her
present abuses may be too much for Carlos to handle.</P>
<P>"A Place In the Sun" and "Love Story" (and the classic 60's song "Down in
the Boondocks" by Billy Joe Royal) come to minds with the poor boy/girl
looking to the ritzy side of the tracks for love and success.
"crazy/beautiful," from the original script by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi,
twists the tradition rich/poor concept around from what we normally get,
with the poor kid being warned by his friends, family and, hell, even the
girl's own father, that she's no good and will only drag him down.</P>
<P>I like the idea of distorting the old rich-girl/poor-boy yarn to show that
underprivileged is not necessarily a bad thing and having the lap of luxury
and all its perks is not always good. "crazy/beautiful" starts out with the
first tentative meeting between Nicole and Carlos on a sunny beach as she
picks up trash as punishment for driving under the influence. Nicole is
pretty, in a rather haggard way, and, with her troublemaking attitude, soon
gets Carlos into hot water - repeatedly. Just why he would jeopardize his
ambitious, focused future for someone who causes him nothing but trouble is
a problem I have with the story.</P>
<P>There are other issues, too, as "crazy" Nicole is not all that whacked out.
Sure she has psychological and self-esteem problems. She drinks too much
and acts irresponsibly, but I've known people who I considered "crazy" and
they were a lot worse than Nicole. I kept waiting for the girl to really
flip out but, except for one scene when she is awakened from a drunken
stupor by the cops who pulled Carlos over as he (soberly) drove her home,
this never materialized. By the end, when everything is nicely wrapped up,
I was still waiting for her to explode.</P>
<P>The two leads make a nice looking couple but I never believed in the mutual
attraction. Dunst continues to build her acting credentials and is
developing into a young star. Newcomer Jay Hernandez is personable enough,
but does not stand out as Carlos. The rest of the cast is little more than
background noise. Taryn Manning, as Nicole's best friend Maddy, is cute,
has an effervescent personality and is unceremoniously dropped from the
story entirely by the half way mark. Bruce Davison collects a paycheck as
the congressman dad who disdains and ignores his troubled child until,
perfunctorily, they all live happily ever after in the last few minutes.
The only character that rings true to me is Carlos's mom who expressed
maternal, protective volumes with just a look at her son.</P>
<P>"crazy/beautiful" never gets out of the shallow end of the pool with its
tale of star-crossed love. It doesn't grab me, but maybe it will win over
its female teen target audience. I give it a C-.</P>
