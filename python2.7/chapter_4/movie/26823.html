<P>Mission: Impossible 2 
Tom Cruise is back as super secret agent Ethan Hunt who must save the world - 
not from nuclear war or terrorists - but from a lethal man-made virus. An 
original idea to be sure, but the execution of the story is not. Instead of 
being too confusing like the last time, this time it's almost too simple and 
certain key plot points and sequences are waaaaaay over the top and 
unbelievable. Action filmmaker John Woo certainly puts a lot more energy into 
this film than Brian De Palma did in 1996. We can really buy Cruise as a 
genuine action performer (the long, drawn-out fight scene at the end is proof 
of this). 
Whatever you're expecting this film to be will, it WILL be, so enjoy the 
ride.
