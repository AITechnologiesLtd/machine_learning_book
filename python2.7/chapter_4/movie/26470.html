<PRE>EMBRACE OF THE VAMPIRE</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* *</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Anne Goursaud
Written by: Rick Bitzelberger, Nicole Coady, Halle Eaton</P>
<P>Charlotte (Alyssa Milano) is a first year college student. She has a 
boyfriend, Chris (Harrison Pruett), who she's been seeing for some 
considerable amount of time yet won't have sex with. This is apparently 
because her mother placed her in a catholic school and she was raised with 
the belief that sex is bad (she sure talks about it a lot though). Lately, 
she's been having strange dreams about a man she believes is a vampire 
(Martin Kemp). Apparently this vampire was in love with her in a past life 
and has no tracked her down. He must seduce her away from Chris in three 
days or he'll die. So, he begins working his charms on her by giving her an 
ankh which makes her become more and more sexually promiscuous. Soon 
Charlotte is descending into a world of carnal pleasures and begins to 
forget about Chris entirely.</P>
<P>As a movie critic, I don't have the luxury of giving a movie a good rating 
based entirely on the amount of nudity (which, let's face it, is the one 
reason people are seeing this film) it contains. So let's get this out in 
the open right now. Yes, Alyssa Milano loses all her clothes, and yes she 
looks fantastic. That out of the way, "Embrace of the Vampire" is a terrible 
movie. I'd like to be able to classify it as a guilty pleasure, but it's not 
even good enough to earn that title. This is the sort of movie so poorly 
written, directed, and acted, you'd normally be left wondering how in the 
world it got made. I say normally because it should be perfectly obvious how 
it got made, and how it managed to sell so many copies on video. Sadly 
enough, as a skin flick it's sub-par at best. There aren't many nude scenes, 
and the ones that are there are so poorly filmed and written (it took THREE 
writers to create this piece of garbage?) they're fairly painful to watch. 
As a horror movie, "Embrace of the Vampire" is, well, words cannot describe 
it.</P>
<P>Believe it or not, there was acting in this movie. Granted, it was of fairly 
poor quality, but while the actors may have been talentless, they sure gave 
it their best shot. First off we have Alyssa Milano, looking like she'd 
rather be just about anywhere else in the world. I mean this poor girl looks 
so embarrassed I half expected her to break down and start crying right in 
front of the camera. Harrison Pruett, meanwhile, takes his part very 
seriously. I guess this makes sense considering the fact that it's his one 
and only appearance in a "major" motion picture. Why didn't his career go 
anywhere? Well, because despite the fact that he tries very hard, the man 
doesn't have anything even remotely resembling acting talent. The less said 
about Martin Kemp's ("Waxwork II") turn as the vampire the better. I'll make 
this brief. There's overacting in that fun, zany, John Lithgow sort of way; 
and then there's overacting in that painful, horrendous, Martin Kemp sort of 
way. Last up we have Jennifer Tilly ("Bound") in what thankfully amounts to 
little more than a cameo. The less time I have to watch Tilly pretend she 
can act the better.</P>
<P>Not all the film's faults can be blamed on the actors, a good chunk of them 
can land in the laps of the director and writers (three writers; sorry, I 
just can't get over that). Anne Goursaud seems to fancy herself something of 
a skin flick master. Yet let's take a look at her directorial credits, shall 
we? To start with, she directs this with about as much skill as your average 
first year film student. The pacing is horrendous, with an already boring 
story moving along about as quickly as your average PBS special on tree 
slugs. You want to know just how slowly this film moves? Warning, this is a 
minor spoiler (not that you should care). The movie ends with a chase scene 
that involves the hero walking up stairs after the villain. They walk, and 
walk, and look around, and walk some more. It's far more dull than I can 
adequately describe here. So, after making this stupid movie, she goes on to 
make "Poison Ivy 2" (starring a very embarrassed looking Alyssa Milano. Are 
we noticing a trend here?), and the less said about that movie the better. 
Finally she (hopefully) ends her career as a director by helping to create 
"Love in Paris". If you've seen that "movie", I'll that sink in for a 
second. If you haven't seen it, be thankful. It's one of the most ineptly 
acted, directed, and written movies ever made.</P>
<P>As for the writing, if it can really be called that, it's so gloriously 
stupid you'd think the writers were drunk (I guess that's a possibility 
actually). Nothing in this movie is every explained. We never find out why 
the vampire is going to die if he doesn't have Charlotte, or why he can't 
just take her by force and be done with it, or even what happens to half the 
characters who simply vanish midway through the film. The dialogue is 
remarkably bad, often painfully so; the characters have no personalities 
other than he likes sex, she doesn't like sex; and some of the characters 
are so obviously present for one specific purpose or another (mainly 
involving sex, imagine that) you'll probably catch yourself laughing out 
loud when they appear on screen. As for the score, it isn't exactly good, 
but it's not half as terrible as the film's other elements. "Embrace of the 
Vampire" runs 93 minutes, but it feels considerably longer (like several 
days longer). I'd recommend the film only to those who are simply dying to 
see Alyssa Milano in the buff, but to no one else under any circumstances. I 
give it a slightly generous two out of five stars, and a curse upon you Anne 
Goursaud, may you never direct again.</P>
