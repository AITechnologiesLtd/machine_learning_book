The General  (1998)  129m</PRE>
<P>John Boorman deservedly won the Best Director at Cannes in 1998 for this 
biopic of Irish criminal Martin Cahill (who was assassinated by the IRA four 
years previously).  It is one of his finest works, a film that manages to 
look both as the opus of a mature film-maker and the early work of a 
talented new arrival.  THE GENERAL is wonderfully assured and without the 
unevenness of earlier Boorman works, yet also appears an apotheosis of all 
that went before it:  we can see the black-and-white spirited 60s of CATCH 
US IF YOU CAN, another great performance from Jon Voight (DELIVERANCE), the 
criminal underworld of POINT BLANK, the nostalgia of HOPE AND GLORY, and the 
man-as-myth themes of EXCALIBUR and ZARDOZ.  Throw in a few giant locusts 
and you'd be able to pull EXORCIST II out of the hat as well (Boorman does 
make at least one in-joke by including a brief shot of a 'Squeal like a Pig' 
t-shirt that cites the most famous line from DELIVERANCE).</P>
<P>THE GENERAL scores on many levels - the acting is terrific (Brendan Gleeson 
makes the role entirely his own, and Voight's accent is faultless), the 
story engaging, and the viewpoint always open.  Boorman doesn't judge 
Cahill, although he does get us to admire his resourcefulness.  It's hard 
not to like him - unlike most other crime lords he does not create a 
dangerous heirarchy that places him significantly at the top.  True, he is 
the brains of his operation, but his shambolic, hangdog manner keep him in 
at grass roots level with the rest of his boys.  Even when resorting to 
thuggery (when one of the gang appears to have cheated the others), his 
organization doesn't appear as sadistic as others we have seen on screen.  
Really, Cahill is the antithesis of the gangster image popularised by films 
such as GODFATHER and CASINO.  Rather than grandstand in the manner of a 
mafia Don, Cahill shuffles about obscured by rainwear; he avoids eye contact 
and speaks quietly; his hand is always fluttering near his face, trying to 
hide it.  His rogueishness could almost win us over entirely if we were not 
reminded (by Voight's character) that his antics have lost several honest 
people their jobs and have terrified people inside their homes.  Cahill 
lives an extraordinary life but is determined to keep his lifestyle as 
'normal' as possible - all he wants is a nice house in a nice area for his 
family (in the meantime, he carries on what is seen as just a 'normal' 
affair with his sister-in-law!).  We hardly notice the conflict because the 
rest of the country is in turmoil anyway - by the time Cahill, the police, 
and the IRA are all on opposing sides, we've lost hope for anything ever 
attaining normality.  Maybe that's why one of the more memorable moments in 
THE GENERAL is an understated housebreaking scene, in which Cahill moves 
from room to room while a Van Morrison song plays quietly and magically on 
the soundtrack.  It's a sweet, distinctive cinema moment; we can only hope 
that Boorman will be bringing us more.</P>
