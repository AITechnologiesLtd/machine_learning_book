<PRE>RETROSPECTIVE: HAIRSPRAY (1988)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Mike Watson
Copyright 1998 Mike Watson</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: 5 out of 5</PRE>
<P>Hysterical racist housewife to funky black lady in downtown record
shop:  "Don't you try your voodoo spells on me you...you...NATIVE
WOMAN!!!!"  For quotable quotes, no one does 'em like John Waters.</P>
<P>After two decades of outrageous, confronting, often hilarious and at
times plain disgusting movies, The King Of Camp and Prince Of Puke
delivered his first mainstream film with HAIRSPRAY.  And though it's
no shockfest, it remains one of his most likable and enduring films,
possibly the finest of his long career.</P>
<P>This affectionate, funny tribute to teenage life in early-60's
Baltimore has such an innocent feel-good vibe that fans of Waters'
earlier trash classics may, ironically, be a little shocked.
HAIRSPRAY tells the story of "pleasantly plump" Tracy Turnblad (Ricki
Lake) and her ambitions to be a star on The Corny Collins Show, the
cool TV dance show that's the be-all and end-all for Baltimore's
glamour-crazed teens.  Her wacky parents (played wonderfully by Divine
and Seinfeld star Jerry Stiller) and shy best friend Penny stand by
her side as she battles bitch teen queen Amber Von Tussle for both the
star spot on the show and the love the teen hunk Link.</P>
<P>The soundtrack is spiced with great songs, and the some of the dance
routines are nothing short of sensational.  For me, the most powerful
sequence is when our white heroes pay their first ever visit to a
black dance club.  Immediately you see - no, feel - the difference
between the black and white styles as Waters charges the scene with an
incredible sensuality and sexual energy.  It really is an exhilarating
moment.</P>
<P>With HAIRSPRAY Waters has clearly toned down his infamous shock
tactics of earlier films - you'll see no eating dog shit, obese
lesbian lovemaking or dicks being cut off here.  Thankfully his way
with dialogue, his love of trash, and his endearing sense of camp
remain.  The outrageous hairdos, the silly teen lingo, the "Hefty
Hideaway" fashion boutique, Penny's hysterical Puritan mother - his
unmistakable touch is everywhere.</P>
<P>This is a comedy, no question.  But what surprises is that it's a
comedy with a strong moral awareness.  Amongst all the laughs and
driving the film at its centre is the issue of black/white
segregation.  It's a fact of life in the lives of these characters,
but not for long if Tracey Turnblad and her friends have their way.
Their growing awareness of the obscene injustice of it all eventually
leads them to full-on revolt, and you can bet your beehive hairdo that
you'll be cheering them all the way.</P>
<P>This is what elevates HAIRSPRAY above just about every other retro
comedy to come out of Hollywood in the last two decades.  It's not
just entertaining, it's actually very touching.  John Waters'
compassion for black people, fat people, outcastes and fringe-dwellers
gives this film tremendous heart.  I've watched it four times and I
still find it one of the most genuinely uplifting films I've seen.  Of
course, it's also riotously funny, and with those two magic
ingredients combined the writer/director has delivered an unmistakable
classic.  </P>
<PRE>Don't miss it, groovers.</PRE>
