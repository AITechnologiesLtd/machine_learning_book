<P>     METRO is about as generic as action pictures come.  All the staples 
are in place:  the maverick cop out for revenge, the psycho villain with 
more than one life, the girlfriend-in-danger, and the mismatched 
partner.  There are also numerous, assorted shoot outs, car chases, and 
explosions.  Yet, despite the familiar nature of all this material, it 
somehow manages to rise above its cliche-riddled origins and ascend to a 
watchable -- and, at times, even enjoyable -- level.  This is due in no 
small part to the charisma of star Eddie Murphy and the sure-handed 
direction of Thomas Carter. </P>
<P>     For Eddie Murphy, THE NUTTY PROFESSOR was a good career move.  It 
revived his reputation as a top-money funny man, and proved that, under 
the right circumstances, he can still generate a healthy box office 
return.  It remains to be seen whether METRO will continue the revival 
or plunge the actor back into the murky pit from which he so recently 
emerged.  While METRO isn't nearly as bad as either BEVERLY HILLS COP 3 
or ANOTHER 48 HOURS, one wonders if movie-goers, who stayed away from 
those features in droves, will avoid this one too.   </P>
<P>     Murphy plays Detective Scott Roper, a hostage negotiations expert 
with a gambling addiction.  When a strung-out druggie takes prisoners 
following a botched bank robbery, Roper uses his charm and unorthodox 
methods to diffuse the situation.  Afterwards, his captain (Denis Arndt) 
cheerfully informs him that he has a new partner, McCall (Michael 
Rapaport), a sharpshooter who scored well on all his police aptitude 
tests.  Soon, Roper and McCall are involved in a deadly cat-and-mouse 
game with a sociopath named Korda (Michael Wincott), who raises the 
stakes to include the life of Roper's girlfriend, Ronnie (Carmen Ejogo). </P>
<P>     Somehow, almost against the odds, Murphy manages to make Roper 
interesting.  He's cut from the mold of dozens of motion picture cops, 
but, through sheer force of personality, Murphy makes him unique and 
likable.  The same cannot be said of Michael Rapaport, who sleepwalks 
his way through another wooden performance.  It continues to baffle me 
what film makers see in him.  Michael Wincott, who seemingly never plays 
a good guy, does a perfectly adequate job as the piece's villain.  And, 
even though I thought METRO's love story was lame, I enjoyed the work of 
British newcomer Carmen Ejogo, despite her lack of chemistry with 
Murphy. </P>
<P>     Carter evidences a great deal of aptitude in directing the action 
sequences.  They are well-paced and tightly-edited (although there are 
times when it's obvious that Murphy is using the services of a stunt 
double), and keep the viewer from thinking too much about the flawed, 
episodic plotline.  Even the film's most obvious steal -- the chase 
through San Francisco's streets immortalized in BULLITT -- adds enough 
new twists, including a thrilling runaway cable car skid -- to make it 
entertaining in its own right. </P>
<P>     Ultimately, however, owing to too many derivative elements and an 
erratic story that runs out of steam about halfway through, METRO is 
only partially-satisfying.  I suppose any viewer's reaction will depend 
on whether they choose to see this particular glass as half-full or 
half-empty.  Murphy fans and action junkies will probably find enough 
here to keep them involved and upbeat.  Everyone else will likely see 
this material as disappointingly over-familiar.  In the wasteland of 
early-1997 releases, you could do worse than METRO, but, by year's end, 
few people are likely to remember the title, let alone the premise. </P>
