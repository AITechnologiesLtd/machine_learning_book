<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>The emptiness of this film and why its story is so unsatisfying in comparison
with its acidy acting and rollicking photography is because English director,
Jonathan Glazer, comes to filmmaking in his debut feature from music videos and
television commercials; he has succeeded only in making a violent film that is
ugly below its surface beauty. It's a film that discourages thinking and
aggressively forces one to revel in the forceful acting jobs going on by the
over-the-edge performance by sociopath Ben Kingsley, and the understated ones by
retired nice guy thief Ray Winstone and brazen mobster boss Ian McShane. In the
end, the performances don't mean much because the story doesn't amount to
anything. </P>
<P>Gal (Winstone), who I gather is the sexy beast, is a retired London East End
thief living a relaxing life of luxury in his villa in Spain's Costa del Sol.
The heavyset, fortysomething, jewelry chain wearing hood is living with former
bad girl Deedee (Redman), someone he loves as much as a rose loves water. Guests
at his villa are his London underworld friends -- Aitch (Kendall) and his girl
Jackie (White). The highlight of the villa, which is in a remote area, is the
swimming pool, which is maintained by houseboy Enrique. When a boulder comes
tumbling down from the hill above the house and just misses Gal and lands in the
pool, the gangster's tranquility is only momentarily shaken. After all, he got
out of the toilet he considers England to be and has found peace in the hot
Mediterranean climate. </P>
<P>The film's plot centers on Gal's ex-boss, a person who inspires fear, Don Logan
(Kingsley), who calls Jackie (someone he had wicked sex with) and tells her to
tell Gal that he's coming to see him because he's putting together a team for a
heist. The thing is Gal is retired and doesn't want to do the heist, but doesn't
know how to tell this to Don. When the bald-headed Don arrives, he intimidates
everyone and goes through a maddening cockney routine of gossip, profanity,
menacing threats, and weird jokes. The film could have used subtitles because
the cockney was laid on so thick it was almost incomprehensible to this
American's ears. </P>
<P>Don tells Gal, by the side of his now empty pool with the small remains of a
boulder still evident after its removal, that Teddy Bass (Ian McShane) has
schemed for the last 5 months to heist an almost impossible series of
safes--which requires Gal's underwater talents to crack them open. When Gal
wishes to thank him for considering him for the job but, nevertheless, says no,
Don's aggressive manner goes to work and Gal is stuck with the familiar dilemma
used in many a gangster film: of a weary thief wanting to quit but outside
pressures make it difficult to do so. </P>
<P>There's nothing special or interesting about the story; the film is pretty to
look at and moves at a rapid pace due to jump-cuts and fast editing, but what
happens is inconsequential and the film gets bogged down in its limitations.
There were also several surreal dream sequences that Gal has, but they seem
meaningless and add no weight to the story. It was hard to care about what
happens to Gal and his irksome pals and his beloved wife (someone he would do
anything for), and it was not possible to care one bit about the Kingsley
character. As far as the Kingsley characterization goes, it was too showy for my
taste to keep me riveted to such a pointless story. </P>
