<PRE>                             TOO MUCH SLEEP
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>Indie filmmakers who want to make their own version of After Hours
better damn well know what they're doing.  In his first feature, David
Maquiling appears to have a grasp of the basics, but his film falls
short of its goal.</P>
<P>At its heart, Too Much Sleep is an extremely simple story about a young
man named Jack (Marc Palmieri), a lazy security guard who finds his
father's handgun stolen during a bus ride daydream.  His quest to
retrieve the gun sends him on the kind of wacky misadventures seen only
in the movies.  With his friend's uncle Eddie (Pasquale Gaeta,
apparently channeling Bruno Kirby in The Freshman here), Jack visits
male strip clubs, foreign parties, and even a Chinese restaurant in
order to track down the mysterious Kate (Nicol Zanzarella), whom he
suspects of conspiring to steal the weapon.  Naturally, we expect Jack
will also find himself along the way.</P>
<P>Sure enough, Jack falls for Kate en route to a whiffle bat beating of
the ultimate crook, but unfortunately, writer/director Maquiling muddles
his metaphors to the point where the audience becomes ambivalent toward
all his characters.  Palmieri's Jack is such a sorry deadpan fool we
hardly care whether he'll retrieve his (illegally owned) gun.  Kate has
so little screen time we don't really feel their relationship is a wise
choice for either character.  Only Gaeta's Eddie comes across as likable
(despite the fact that he's a dishonest lech); his Mafioso-wannabe is
simply too deliriously acted to be seen as anything but innocuous.</P>
<P>Sure enough, Too Much Sleep comes across as exactly that: innocuous and
sleepy, an overly dry shot at creating something quirky that misfires as
often as it hits due to a misconfigured sense of comic timing. 
Filipino-American Maquiling describes his film as an homage to the
timeless "folk story," presumably something passed down orally from
generations to generations.  My kids will have to be content with
digging up the videotape somewhere decades from know.</P>
