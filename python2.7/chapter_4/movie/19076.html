<PRE>`Big Daddy' – Big Dud
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>This is the third movie that I've seen with Saturday Night Alumni Adam
Sandler, the other two being `The Wedding Singer' and `The Waterboy.' 
And having moderately enjoyed his last two offerings, I can say that
the one thing that really works for him is that he does well in stories
where he plays a simple-minded-underachieving-doofus-turned-hero.  When
he plays the gentle soul who occasionally releases his bottled-up
feelings of frustration, we can laugh at those minor eruptions.  And we
can generally laugh at his clueless demeanor and the way that he sort
of just lucks into the happy ending.  These ingredients are what give
Adam Sander the power to turn meaningless fluff into comedic,
blues-chasing films.  However, none of that happens in this film.  And
the result is a generally lifeless film that Sandler just doesn't have
the talent to save.  </P>
<P>Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, an underachieving jerk who is living off
the money won through a lawsuit.  Though he seems to possess some kind
of underlying intelligence, he has no concept of responsibility and
would rather spend his time displaying his skewed pathological
behavior, such as screaming at fast food clerks and throwing branches
in the path of oncoming inline skaters.  His lackadaisical attitude
prompts his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) to leave him, telling him to
grow up.  He needs a quick-fix solution.  Amazingly, a lost waif shows
up at his doorstep.  His name is Julian and he is in search of his Dad
who may be Sonny's roommate (played by Jon Stewart).   Well, his
roommate is travelling, and Sonny, in his infinite wisdom, decides to
keep him as his own son.  He supposes that this decision will teach him
responsibility.  His decision will also prove that the rest of this
movie will amount to the entertainment value of 3AM diaper changes.</P>
<P>As a parent, Sonny should be reported to social services.  When Julian
requests a night light, Sonny brings him a neon sign that says `Live
Nudes.'  When Julian wets his bed, Sonny cover the wet areas with
newspaper and then places Julian on top.  And what fatherly things does
Sonny teach to his child?  Among other things, they include fielding
hard-hit baseballs, learning how to spit in a most disgusting manner,
and peeing on sides of buildings whenever it is convenient.  Sandler is
just trying to have fun with this material, but the more I thought
about Sonny being a father to Julian, the more appalled I became.</P>
<P>In `Big Daddy,' Sandler can't take the reigns of the material, which
deserves more weight.  The material was weak to begin with, and I think
that Sandler knew that.  To compensate, there are other components of
this film.  We meet up with an introspective homeless man (Steve
Buscemi who probably did this as a favor to Sandler) and are introduced
to two college buddies who are openly gay (if you are offended by two
men lustfully kissing, close your eyes upon seeing them for the first
time).  We also meet his roommate's girlfriend who was a former Hooters
girl.  The unfunny Hooters jokes go on and on and after a while, I was
really surprised that she just didn't shoot Sandler.  The only sane
element was Sandler's new girlfriend, Layla (Joey Lauren Adams).  Too
little too late.  The film finally reaches the epitome of discomfort at
the finale, which involves a court scene where Sonny tries to convince
everyone that he is a worthy father.  Perhaps a court will sentence
this to a quick trip to the video store.</P>
