<P> "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" is a prime example of why movie
sequels are usually scorned and derided.</P>
<P> There is absolutely no reason for this movie except to fatten the
wallets of Universal Pictures and of the cast member -probably Eddie
Murphy - who has a percentage deal with the studio.</P>
<P> The movie is like its hero, Sherman Klump, fat, ungainly and leaden.</P>
<P> It is a cynical offering concocted by a goulash of writers who couldn't
move beyond tired flatulence jokes and making fun of old people having
sex.</P>
<P> They even threw in a tired fantasy sequence lamely spoofing
"Armageddon" and "Star Wars." How pathetic.</P>
<P> "Nutty Professor II" is basically an ego trip for Murphy who not only
portrays Professor Sherman Klump, but also assays the roles of Granny
Klump, Mama Klump, Papa Klump, Young Papa Klump, brother Ernie Klump,
Lance Perkins and Buddy Love.</P>
<P> And I bet if given the opportunity, Murphy would have also played the
giant mutant hamster.</P>
<P> The silly story revolves around a genetic youth formula invented by
Sherman, which is stolen by the re-animated Buddy Love who has been
genetically removed from Sherman's body then accidentally brought back
to life via a dog's DNA.</P>
<P> Don't ask or try to understand because it doesn't make a lick of sense.
And neither does the film.</P>
<P> It's merely one big excuse for Murphy to parade around in old-person
drag bouncing a fake pair of breasts, as if it were the height of humor.</P>
<P> Even Jerry Lewis, who is listed as one of the picture's executive
producers, should be embarrassed to have his name in the credits.</P>
<P> OK, Bloom, you're asking, a couple of weeks ago you raved about "Scary
Movie," in which the low-brow humor was heavy on sex, bodily fluids and
bodily functions. So, Mr. Critic, what's the difference between the two?</P>
<P> Simple, "Scary Movie "- in its own disgusting way - was spoofing a
known genre while also laughing at itself. "Nutty Professor II" simply
mocks the audience, making you feel like a sucker for shelling out a few
bucks to waste your time with this tired turkey.</P>
<P> "Nutty Professor II" spends so much time showing off Rick Baker's
excellent make-up effects that it forgot the jokes. You need more than a
versatile actor such as Murphy dressing up as various people to propel a
movie. You need to build a plot, create characters with substance and
situations that offer a payoff - whether comic or dramatic - to involve
the audience.</P>
<P> "Nutty Professor II" does none of these. And it is too bad because I
always have liked Eddie Murphy, and I yearn for the old Murphy who was
so smart and sassy in "Trading Places," "48 HRS" and the original
"Beverly Hills Cop."</P>
<P> Murphy showed great promise as a comic actor. Instead he became a movie
star.</P>
<P> "Nutty Professor II" should do well for a week or two at the box
office. Then, like most sequels of its ilk, it will be forgotten,
eventually consigned to the bargain bins at various video stores and
discount houses where it belongs.</P>
