                       A film review by David Pimmel
                        Copyright 1993 David Pimmel</PRE>

Rated R for language, violence, brief nudity, simulated sex</P>
<PRE>Synopsis
========</PRE>
<P>     Robert De Niro plays reclusive police evidence technician/
photographer Wayne, who is called "Mad Dog" because he is anything
but.  One night he walks into a robbery and saves mobster/ loan shark
Frank Milo (Bill Murray)'s life.  After a night of friendship Frank
gives Wayne a present, Glory (Uma Thurman), a bartender who is
basically in hock to Frank.  Trouble and romance bloom.</P>
<PRE>Review
======</PRE>
<P>     The strength of this film is in its characters.  All three of the
leads bring forth personalities with depth and consistency.  The plot
line is a little awkward and several scenes seem unnecessary, but the
leads carry the film admirable.  I was particularly impressed with Bill
Murray.  He seems to finally be developing into an actor rather than a
comedian who acts.  His performance here and in GROUNDHOG DAY are a far
cry from his smug laugh at the world performances in MEATBALLS and the
GHOSTBUSTERS film.  He is finally playing characters with depth and
interest.  Robert De Niro has been handling the tough roles his entire
career.  This is not his best performance, but as always, he portrays
another solid and believable character.  However, after seeing TAXI
DRIVER recently, it was a bit hard to adjust to De Niro's character at
the beginning.  Finally Uma Thurman as Glory gives a fairly strong
performance.  Unfortunately, her role provided the least substance so,
occasionally she seemed lost.</P>
<P>     This film was originally scheduled for release about six months
ago.  This is usually a sign that something is wrong.  Here we don't
see it as much.  The one scene that seemed out of place was the second
love scene of the movie.  The first was actually a very powerful scene
for plot and character development.  The second seemed gratuitous and
more like a five-minute filler and a chance to show a little skin.
Also the end of the film seems a bit strained.</P>
<P>     In summary, MAD DOG AND GLORY works because of the strong
performances of its leads, despite a less than wonderful script and
plot line.  Particularly strong, as always, is De Niro, but Murray
surprisingly strong as well.</P>

<PRE>Thumbs Up!  *** out of ****
