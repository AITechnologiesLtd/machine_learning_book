<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>I find that the presence of Michael Douglas in a film will make that
particular film seem smarter.  There's something about the 
condescending way he delivers dialogue that instantly inflates the
intelligence level of the film.  Of course, this heightened intelligence
may an illusion, such as in A Perfect Murder, but the point is that
Douglas fools you through the duration of the film's running time.  (The
one exception to the Douglas Rule is, of course, the unwatchable The
Ghost and the Darkness, in which he acts very silly.) </P>
<P>A Perfect Murder is the new film from director Andrew Davis, who also
brought us The Fugitive.  He also brought us Chain Reaction, which, many
will agree, is not as good as The Fugitive.  I think Davis is getting
better at what he does, and A Perfect Murder should prove to most people
that he has a lot of style and knows how to handle suspense pretty
well.  The problem here is with Patrick Smith Kelly's script, which
relies far too heavily on a convoluted and contrived plot, and not
enough on characterization or anything that seems even remotely
plausible.</P>
<P>Douglas plays a rich guy named Steven Taylor.  Gwyneth Paltrow plays
his wife, Emily; and Viggo Mortensen plays her lover, David Shaw.  Now,
if you've seen the previews, you should be aware that this is a film
that banks on plot twists.  The first twist is early, and it's bad form
for me to tell it to you simply on the basis of plot synopsis.  I'll
just say that Steven becomes aware of his wife's infidelity, and he
develops a plan to eradicate her in an easy and fashionable manor.  Oh
hell, he plans a perfect murder.</P>
<P>The film is always fun to watch, and it certainly never gets boring. 
Davis, along with cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and production designer
Philip Rosenberg, has created an atmospheric and extremely rich setting
for the characters to roam through.  The film isn't overflowing with
style, but it has just the right amount to keep you interested without
making you horribly aware of the nifty camera angles.  </P>
<P>A Perfect Murder is based on the play Dial M for Murder, which was made
into a terrific film by Hitchcock in 1954.  It's important to remember
that A Perfect Murder is not a remake of Hitchcock's film, nor is it
derivative of it in any way.  I was glad to see that Davis didn't try to
imitate Hitchcock, although most of what I liked most about Dial M for
Murder is not present in Davis' film.  A Perfect Murder falls back on
mindless action and unlikely plot developments, whereas Hitchcock's film
was intriguing and always believable.  </P>
<P>Of course, that isn't Davis' fault.  I do admire Kelly for trying to
make a very complicated story and still tie all the loose ends together,
but the story simply falls apart when you think about it.  Characters
are forced to do things that they wouldn't do.  Lives hang in the
balance of chance meetings and unlikely coincidences.  People believe
things they shouldn't, and say things that incriminate them, and make up
elaborate and perfect lies in half seconds.  The funny thing is, Davis
weaves the material so seamlessly that the Swiss-cheese-ness of Kelly's
script is only blatantly noticeable on afterthought.</P>
<P>The acting is good, although one of the major problems with the film is
that there really aren't any sympathetic characters.  Douglas plays
nearly the same role that won him the Oscar for Wall Street, although
his performance here suggests more depth in his character and maybe even
a little bit of a conscience (gasp!); eventually, however, he does
things that only hateful sub-humans would do.  Mortensen proves his
versatility again (you might not even recognize him as Demi Moore's
nemesis in G.I. Jane), and does some interesting things with his
character.  Paltrow is also good, but she's the character we're supposed
to root for, and yet there's nothing much to like about her.</P>
<P>Oh, I'm just quibbling.  I liked watching this movie.  It's fun, and
even surprising in a lot of parts.  It could have been better though,
and more realistic, but Andrew Davis at least has shown me that he can
carry his talent beyond The Fugitive.  And as for Douglas, Hollywood
should keep casting him as smart characters in silly movies, because he
sure is good at pulling a messy script together and making it seem smart
. . . even if it is just an illusion.</P>
