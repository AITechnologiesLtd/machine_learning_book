<P>A powerful and unforgettable film, Spike Lee's Summer of Sam is, to 
date, the best drama of 1999. The chief feature of the production is its 
background setting, one so intriguing that it is capable of being an 
entire plot: New York City in the summer of 1977. By adding a 
fictionalized subplot putting several characters under a magnifying 
glass, the film is able to not only use these rich events, but a study 
of human paranoia resulting from them as well. The movie uses these 
great settings and shockingly forthright violence to tie these plots 
together so well.</P>
<P>In the summer of 1977 New York City had a heat wave bringing 
temperatures well over 100 degrees, the Yankees were on there way to a 
world series victory led by Reggie Jackson's three dramatic home runs, 
a blackout occurred that put the city that never sleeps in a zombie-like 
state for days, and the city's first genuine serial killer, David 
Berkowitz, calling himself "Son of Sam," roamed the streets preying on 
innocent young women.</P>
<P>As the temperatures rise, and the body count increases, a certain 
insanity comes about the city that is only further stimulated by the 
other events. Spike Lee's fictionalized group of characters from the 
Bronx, led by Vinny (John Leguizamo) slowly fall victim to the paranoia 
that a serial killer presents, and seek a scapegoat to reassure 
themselves of their safety. Using fractured logic they reach the 
conclusion that this murderer, whoever he may be, must be from their 
neighborhood. So a list of everyone they consider to be a weird-o is 
drawn up, and at the top of their list is aspiring punk rocker Ritchie 
(Adrien Brody) who soon becomes the subject of continuous persecution 
from the group.</P>
<P>Son of Sam (Michael Badalucco) actually has less than 15 minutes of 
screen time in this production. The time that he is on screen proves to 
be some of the most horrifying and frightening moments of the entire 
film. Every murder he commits during the movie is shown with explicit 
detail for a period of time just long enough to make it sink real deep 
inside of you. Not once during any of these beautifully choreographed 
murders do you see the killer's face, just those of people realizing 
that they are about to lose their lives.</P>
<P>Summer of Sam also features a strong sexual content aside from the 
violence and obvious use of foul language. Several scenes focus on 
conversations regarding oral sex techniques, and styles. One scene 
includes three-way sexual activities. Being that a subplot of marriage 
problems with Vinny and his wife (Mira Sorvino) comes about, this 
otherwise excessive sexual content is actually a building block of the 
film's excellence.</P>
<P>The production includes an incredible panoply of background settings and 
musical pieces. Scenes range from the streets of New York to Studio 54, 
with music from groups like ABBA to Elton John. The film also uses a 
delightful contrast technique using upbeat music as the murders take 
place, creating an incredible chill.</P>
<P>When David Berkowitz announced that he had received orders to kill from 
a dog, people were equally shocked and amused. He had been a strong 
presence in New York City for over a year, and that was his reasoning. 
Comparatively, Summer of Sam is both shocking and entertaining, making 
it a strong presence and great film at the same time.</P>
