<PRE>                            SILK ROAD
                  A film review by Thomas E. Billings
                   Copyright 1992 Thomas E. Billings</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
Set in China during the Sung dynasty (11th Century), the film depicts
the adventures of a young scholar who gets drafted to fight in several
battles.  The ultimate goal of the film is to provide a (fictional)
explanation for an archeological mystery: the discovery of a large
library of 11th century scrolls, found in Dun-Huang in 1899.  A
historical drama set in China, that is similar in style to a Japanese
samurai story.  Not as good as most Chinese "art" films; not
recommended.</P>
<P>Japan/China (English subtitles), color, 1991, 120 minutes.
Director: Junya Sato. 
Based on a novel by Yasushi Inoue.</P>
<P>     Because this new film has the same name as another recent program,
it is appropriate that I clarify the situation.  In 1980 (date
approximate), NHK, the Japanese television firm, broadcast a documentary
called "Silk Road."  The "Silk Road" documentary is probably best known
in the United States for its soundtrack by Kitaro, a (very) popular
Japanese "New Age" musician.  I mention this because I want readers to
be fully aware that the film SILK ROAD is new and different; it is not
the documentary, and the soundtrack is not by Kitaro.  (As a side note,
I would mention to fans of Kitaro that the "Silk Road" documentary is
now available on videotape in the U.S.; I believe Time-Life is the U.S.
distributor.)</P>
<P>     The story centers on a young scholar, Zhao Xingde, and is set in
China during the Sung dynasty; most of the action occurs in the years
1026 and 1028.  The film begins with the young scholar being questioned
by elder scholars.  He fails the exam because he does not know much
about Xixia, a nearby country.  Shortly afterward he joins with two
other young scholars, and leaves for Dun-Huang, the crossroads city on
the "silk road," the overland route  between China and the Mideast and
Europe.  (Dun-Huang is in northwestern China.)  His caravan is captured
by soldiers, and Zhao and his friends find themselves immediately
drafted into the Chinese unit of the Xixian army!</P>
<P>     Their unit is later involved in a few battles, and they eventually
find themselves at the gates of the capital city of Uighur (another
country).  Zhao goes ahead to scout the city, and discovers the daughter
of the king of Uighur.  He hides her and tries to protect her.  A few
days later he leaves the city, under orders to go to another city, and
smuggles the princess out of the city.  The story continues as they get
lost in the desert...</P>
<P>     I was somewhat disappointed by this film, for reasons that will be
discussed shortly.  First, you should know that although the film is a
(fictitious) historical drama set in China, it is very much a Japanese
film.  The director, most actors, writer, and some of the production
staff, are Japanese.  Except for a brief narration at the beginning and
ending of the film (the narration is in English), all dialog in the film
is in Japanese.  The film has subtitles, in English only (no Chinese
subtitles in the version I saw).  The film was co-produced by a number
of Chinese organizations, including the Chinese Army.</P>
<P>     Now, in saying it is a Japanese film, I am really referring more to
its style, tone, and pacing rather than the ethnic origin of its cast or
production crew.  In these matters, the film  is very similar to a
Japanese feudal period or samurai film, except it happens to be set in
ancient China instead of feudal Japan.  I happen to enjoy both Japanese
historical dramas and Chinese historical dramas.  However, I found
watching a Chinese drama, done in the style of a Japanese drama, to be
somewhat incongruous.</P>
<P>     The film has more problems than simply a style that differed from
my expectations.  First, the film provides very little character
development and then quickly jumps to action (battle scenes).  As an
example, the film begins with a short scene of Zhao being questioned.  A
few scenes later, he is in the desert, and his caravan is being attacked
by soldiers.  The 2 or 3 minutes between introducing the character and
the first battle does not provide time to get involved in or care about
what happens to the character.  This same problem appears later in the
film when the Uighuri princess quickly falls in love with Zhao.  Of
course he helps her, but why does she fall in love with him, other than
the script calling for love at first sight?</P>
<P>     Next, the editing is rather abrupt at times, making the film hard
to follow.  I had the impression that the film was edited down from a
much longer film -- a TV miniseries perhaps?  (Note that this is pure
conjecture on my part).  The battle scenes often involved large numbers
of men on horseback in the dry and very dusty desert.  These epic battle
scenes often turned into large clouds of dust!  Also, the camera would
scan to show the huge cast assembled for the battle scenes.
Unfortunately, these scenes were often out of focus in the film print I
viewed.</P>
<P>     Because of the film's technical flaws and poor story development, I
would not recommend it to a general audience, and would recommend that
fans of Chinese historical dramas avoid it.  I also wouldn't recommend
it to fans of Japanese historical dramas, as there are many excellent
Japanese historical films available on video.</P>
<P>U.S. Distribution: presently in its first U.S. theatrical release.
The film opens in San Francisco at the AMC Kabuki Theater on Friday, 31
January, 1992.  The U.S. distributor is Trimark Pictures.</P>
