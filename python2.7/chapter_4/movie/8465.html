                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
          Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: ** (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>Since his star-making turn in 1994's "Pulp Fiction," Samuel L. Jackson has
been slowly leveraging himself into the forefront of the American
moviegoers' consciousness.  Therefore it's something of a surprise that his
latest vehicle, "187" ("One Eight Seven"), a sincere yet cookie-cutter look
at how hard it really is to be a teacher, has crept into the
back-end-of-summer releases with very little fanfare.</P>
<P>Jackson's performance is typically commendable, but there's nothing new to
be learned from this seen-it-all-before movie experience.</P>
<P>When Trevor Garfield (Jackson), a high-school science teacher in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of New York, flunks one of his students,
the kid takes it personally, perforating Garfield in the back with a nail
the way one would tenderize a nice flank steak.  Fifteen months later, a
recovered Garfield transfers to L.A., but quickly learns that academic
achievement is not a high priority for the underprivileged youths of John
Quincy Adams High, where he signs on as a substitute.</P>
<P>Stubbornness and a passion for teaching compel Garfield to stand his
ground, winning the affection of Computer Science instructor Ellen Henry
(Kelly Rowan) and the ire of many a disenfranchised student, including one
particularly confrontational punk, Cesar (convincingly played by Clifton
Gonzalez Gonzalez).  In an environment where staying alive takes precedence
over educational excellence, Garfield soon finds himself a man on the verge
of breaking point.  Again.</P>
<P>The number 187 (police code for homicide), by the way, shows up at the
beginning and end of the film, first scrawled threateningly throughout one
of Garfield's textbooks ("When a student says they're going to kill you,
you believe them") and lastly scratched in his car's paintjob, when events
lead to a contrived and over-the-top finale that is every bit as
uncomfortable as it is stupid.</P>
<P>Director Kevin Reynolds, whom many thought wouldn't work in this town again
after the much-maligned "Waterworld," displays some creativity in his
burned-out depiction of an East L.A. scorched by apathy and hate.  It's
like a brick-red, jump-cutting Pepsi ad, with students literally coming
into focus as the lightbulbs spark in their tiny minds.  But where the film
fails is in its writing.</P>
<P>"One in nine teachers," the statisticians choose to inform us at the onset
of the film's end credits, "are attacked in their schools.  Ninety-five per
cent of those attacks are by students."  But perhaps the most jarring
statistic is this: "A teacher wrote this film."</P>
<P>Screenwriter Scott Yagemann, although having spent seven years teaching in
the Los Angeles public school system, presents a viewpoint so devoid of
originality that it makes you wonder how this film ever got financed.  An
insider should have shown us something we haven't seen before, not a pale
imitation of such standout films as "The Blackboard Jungle" or "Stand and
Deliver."  True, the casting of Jackson in the lead might draw a crowd (as
at one of Philadelphia's few remaining Center City movie houses, where
audience participation is on a par with "Let's Make a Deal").  But while
Jackson gets a B+ for his solid, dominating performance, "187" should have
been held back.</P>
