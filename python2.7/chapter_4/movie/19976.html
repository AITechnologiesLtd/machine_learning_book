<P>_Bowfinger_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Universal's ad campaign for _Bowfinger_ would lead one to believe that
the film rides solely on one (admittedly inspired) gimmick: Unable to
land action superstar Kit Ramsey to headline his no-budget extravaganza,
aspiring movie producer-director Bobby Bowfinger instead casts a geeky
lookalike.  However, that's only a small fraction of what's on
writer-star Steve Martin's savvy satirical mind, which takes stinging
potshots on a wide variety of targets under the Hollywood sun in one
efficiently funny package.</P>
<P>It takes a while for Bobby (Martin) to get so desperate as to hire a
dead ringer for Kit (Eddie Murphy), but his initial scheme is just as, if
not more, pathetic.  Knowing that the key to making his sci-fi cheapie
_Chubby_Rain_ a success would be the involvement of the elusive and
self-centered Kit, he shoots his unwitting "star" in secret, assembling a
performance out of footage shot while he is in public places (such as
restaurants and parking sructures) and reacting to his "co-stars," who
approach him out of the blue.  The reaction usually elicited is one of
confusion and fear--which, as it happens, are the primary emotions of his
"character," who is supposed to be witness to an alien invasion.</P>
<P>While the shooting-on-the-sly premise is funny--particularly Murphy's
work as the oblivious and bewildered Kit--_Bowfinger_ really takes off
with the introduction of the softspoken Jiff (also played by Murphy), who
is hired as a Kit substitute when the real deal goes on a retreat to
replenish his rapidly diminishing sanity.  Much like how the film is
given new life, Murphy is similarly energized in the character of Jiff. 
He has always been at his best when he tosses his vanity aside and
disappears completely into a role, as he did so memorably in
_The_Nutty_Professor_, and he similarly wrings laughs and elicits a fair
amount of sympathy as the good-natured, if slow of mind, Jiff.</P>
<P>Low-budget guerilla filmmaking and egotistical stars are Martin and
director Frank Oz's main targets in the film, but they nimbly use their
supporting players to attack other Tinseltown staples.  Daisy (Heather
Graham) is both the wide-eyed innocent who thinks a bus ticket from Ohio
is also an instant one to stardom as well as the predatory young actress
on the make.  On the other end of the spectrum is Carol (Christine
Baranski), an aging stage diva who itches for a taste of recaptured
glory.  Jerry Renfro (Robert Downey Jr.) is your typically greasy studio
exec, and _Chubby_Rain_'s script happens to be written not by a career
screenwriter but an accountant (Adam Alexi-Malle) with big-time Hollywood
aspirations.  There's also a thinly-veiled knock on Scientology.  With
such a wide range of targets, Martin and Oz give all their peripheral
players their moments to shine, with the one notable exception being
Jamie Kennedy, whose natural live-wire instincts (see the _Scream_ films)
are unfortunately held in check in the limited background role of Dave,
the studio gofer who "borrows" the equipment to film Mr. Bowfinger's
opus.</P>
<P>_Bowfinger_ does take its time to build a head of steam, but in an age
where movies often begin well before precipitously falling apart, the
fact that it is a film that actually gets better as it goes along makes
it something of a rarity.  Also rare is the enjoyment in finding a
seemingly no-brainer comedy that reveals itself to not only have a brain,
but a sharp one at that.</P>
