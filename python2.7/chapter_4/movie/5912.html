but can frighten many youngsters. </P>
<P>One hundred years ago the visionary writer H.G.Wells 
published "The Island of Dr. Moreau" in which a 
scientist transformed animals into something like 
humans.</P>
<P>In 1933, the novel was  filmed as "The Island of 
Lost Souls."  The ruler of the remote Pacific Island 
was played by Charles Laughton as a merciless, 
whip-cracking plantation owner. With talented gusto, 
he hammed up his verbal and body English. The film 
was once banned in Britain for its vivisection 
scenes, tame by today's standards. According to 
historian Carlo Clarens, "Wells openly repudiated 
the picture as a vulgarization of his novel." But 
then both book and movie were more effective as 
horror than as science.  </P>
<P>Its director Erle C.Kenton was a prolific, minor 
figure who tried various genres, including comedies 
with W.C. Fields or Abbott and Costello, 
Frankenstein derivatives, whodunits. Some were 
pretty good  but Kenton is only remembered for 
"Moreau", his "magnum opus."</P>
<P>The Don Taylor remake in1977 went back to the Wells 
title, starred Burt Lancaster, lasted 34 minutes 
longer, was more serious and eager, played pretty 
well but did not dethrone its predecessor.</P>
<P>Now the second remake has a director who came in on 
a "troubled" picture.  John Frankenheimer was one of 
the major new filmmakers of the 1960s, with good to 
excellent films in a variety of genres and with an 
almost unbroken  string of successes : "The Young 
Savages" (with Burt Lancaster); "Birdman of 
Alcatraz";  the legendary, paranoid political 
thriller "The Manchurian Candidate";  the military 
conspiracy thriller "Seven Days in May" (Lancaster, 
Fredric March, Kirk Douglas); the WWII adventure 
"The Train" (Lancaster); the racing story "Grand 
Prix"; the haunting, sinister sci-fi rebirth 
thriller "Seconds," one of the best pictures of the 
decade and possibly Rock Hudson's top role; "The 
Fixer"; "The Gypsy Moths."  </P>
<P>There was a decline in the 70s, except for "The 
Iceman Cometh," "French Connection II," and "Black 
Sunday" (1977).It continued into the 80s and early 
90s, when Frankenheimer made only about six 
features.</P>
<P>The fans of the director were pinning their hopes on 
"Dr. Moreau." Alas, this is not a comeback movie.  
It is not bad, but it just isn't good enough either. 
In it, David Thewlis (who triumphed in "Naked") 
plays Edward Douglas, an Englishman on a U.N. 
mission and the sole survivor of a plane crash in 
the Malay Sea. (The aquatic parts and all else are 
shot beautifully by veteran, versatile master 
cinematographer William Fraker, now 73). </P>
<P>Rescued by the mysterious Val Kilmer, Thewlis is led 
to the island where he becomes a guest-prisoner. He 
discovers that Nobel prize-winner Dr.Moreau (Brando) 
had been there for 17 years, after being thrown out 
of the USA by animal righters. Kilmer, his factotum 
for 10 years, is ambiguous, takes drugs, perhaps 
aspires to become the new Moreau. He gives a 
wickedly good imitation of Brando.</P>
<P>Moreau works with genetic engineering, creating 
beings from "animals fused with human genes," in 
search of the perfect homo sapiens. He fabricates 
horrible-looking monsters, a gallery of mutants with 
endless combinations like parts of two animals along 
the human side. He calls them "my children."  His 
only near-total  accomplishment is beautiful Aissa, 
but even she needs regular potion fixes so as not to 
regress into savagery.  </P>
<P>The Law of the isle is a vegeterian version of Thou 
Shalt Not Kill. Infractions, unlike in the original 
movie in which the critters were punished by torture 
in The House of Pain, are dealt with through  
electronic implants. With a touch of a button in his 
remote-control gizmo, Moreau can send a culprit 
writhing in pain. </P>
<P>Soon, the frightened, disgusted Douglas, along with 
the frightened and illogical Aissa (doesn't she know 
that without her doses she'll revert to a beast?) 
try to escape and are caught. Then the beast-people, 
do the Spartacist thing and revolt... Then Douglas 
discovers files and vials with his name on them. 
Then....</P>
<P>The movie is rich in visuals and effects, many of 
them splendidly computerized.  But they are 
counter-productive in their excess. Past the 
well-handled first part, you can't see the forest 
for the trees, the continuity becomes messy,  many 
incoherences enter the film. Metaphors abound--the 
expected ones like "Don't tamper with the work of 
Nature," "Don't fool with evolution," "There is a 
beast inside each human." Yet more specific 
connections to our waning century's crucial issues 
of DNA, gene-splicing and the like, are buried under 
the confused/confusing script. </P>
<P>What is new and positive are the movie's funny 
aspects, whether planned or not.  Marlon Brando is a 
hoot. His first public appearance is in a 
Brandonmobile, the analog to the Popemobile. Sitting 
high, looking like a Kabuki Buddha, a Deity with a 
huge tent-hat and veils, Marlon even blesses his 
flock from above. Perhaps the filmmakers also had in 
mind a Rajah nodding to his subjects from atop an 
elephant? </P>
<P>Brandon, thinking that his Moreau is allergic to 
heat and sun rays, convinced Frankenheimer that 
because of the destruction of the ozone layer, the 
doctor's  face had to be marmeladed over with a 
white, oozy sunscreen. A howl. That's not all. 
Moreau's mumbo-jumbo explanations are 
tongue-in-cheek. Outrageously and ludicrously 
delivered, they're quite comical.</P>
<P>We wonder where all this state-of-the-art medical 
and electronic equipment came from, and was bought 
with what money? But 
leaving logic in the Malay Sea, we can enjoy every 
single scene with Brando. He sits at a grand piano, 
with his smallest "son" (a dwarf's dwarf in size-- 
how did they do it?) at a child's piano that belongs 
to the Guinness Book of Records as the minusculest 
functioning grand ever. Together they tinkle away a 
four-hand rendition of Chopin's Polonaise No 6. They 
are very pleased with themselves. </P>
<P>Later, when the now carnivorous humanoids invade the 
room and bang on the pianos, Moreau, trying to 
soothe them, tells them that the sounds are most 
interesting: "Reminds me of a man called 
Schoenberg... 12-tone music." He proceeds to attempt 
calming the savage breasts with Gershwin's "Rhapsody 
in Blue."</P>
<P>Watching this re-remake you seesaw between high camp 
and monstrosities, including a scene that brings to 
mind Nazi crematoria.  Animal lovers will be 
saddened at the moral and physical uglification of 
beasts. When Moreau's Law ceases to work, it's the 
law of the Jungle that prevails, but by now we all 
know that this law, once maligned, is an exquisitely 
complex, beautiful construct.</P>
<P>The movie could use much more simplification on one 
hand, subtlety and complexity on the other, instead 
of ending up as just a Grand Guignol spectacle. 
Still, Brando's screen time is worth the price of 
the ticket. In French, super-artists are called 
"sacred monsters." That's what Brando still is, 
especially here.</P>
