<PRE>THE MATRIX (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Steve Kong
Copyright 1999 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>If I say too much about The Matrix I risk spoiling your fun when you see
it.  If I say too little about The Matrix I risk you losing interest in
this intriguing and thought provoking film.  So, let me say this up front
about The Matrix: Don't Miss The Matrix.  This is the best science fiction
movie put out so far this year and possibly for the rest of the year.</P>
<P>Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a bland software engineer by day and a daring hacker
by night.  As of late he's been getting some strange messages from an
unknown source warning him of a danger to his life.  The messages come from
a man named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and are sometimes delivered by a
beautiful messenger Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss).  From here on, if I say
anything else I'll spoil the twists and turns that the movie goes through.
Let's just say that what you think is real, isn't.</P>
<P>The Matrix comes from the Wachowski brothers, Andy and Larry.  These are
the same two that put together the equally brilliant film Bound.  Being
their second film, I was sure that The Matrix was going to be a solid film
but what The Matrix really is surprised me.  These two are not just
Hollywood hacks; they are two talented moviemakers.  What makes the
Wachowski brothers so good is their sense of style and atmosphere.  If
you've seen Bound then you'll know what I mean.  With The Matrix they turn
the style and atmosphere up a notch.  The film is dark, gritty, and dense.
Shadows and light are used to the extreme, with shadows lingering and light
casting in all sorts of mysterious ways.  Actors are lit in ways that
attract the eye from one section of the screen to the other, while at other
times actors are half hidden in the shadows.  The Matrix is more than just
a solid film; it is an instant classic.</P>
<P>What makes The Matrix so intriguing is the way that the Wachowski brothers
tell the story.  Instead of laying the whole story on us at once, they
layer it on.  Using Neo as the freshman, we learn at his rate as he is
taught about The Matrix.  This slow layering of the story works well and
helped to keep my attention focused on the story presented.  It was only
until after the film ended that a big question popped into my mind, but
we'll get that later.</P>
<P>The Matrix is a mix of Dark City and Strange World with some Gibson stirred
in for good luck.  The ideas presented are horrifyingly plausible and
strangely engaging.  Keep this in mind; the film is not a brain-dead film.
The script is quite intelligent and though it'll be hard for you to lose
interest in the film, you'll want to keep the brain turned on for this
sci-fi action film.  The film doesn't stay with one genre too long, it
defies cliches and moves between genres at will and does this well.
There's quite a bit of action, some romance, a double cross, and a lot of
sci-fi.  The portion of the film, next to the sci-fi, that got a large
chunk of my attention was the action.</P>
<P>Most often American directors who try to emulate my favourite director John
Woo end up looking like cheap knock-offs.  But, this is the first time that
I've ever seen action done at a level that approaches Woo.  The Wachowski
brothers are, in my book, close or as good as Woo in doing action.  The
action sequences in The Matrix are of the same type of adrenaline pumping,
at-the-edge-of-your-seat action that Woo puts together.  There are many
standout sequences, including some incredibly choreographed hand-to-hand
sequences that will not be forgotten anytime soon.  The action sequences
that had me in awe were the gun-fighting sequences.  Sure, we've all seen
it done before; the slow-mo, and the bad guys that have no aim, the bullet
shells hitting the floor.  But, it's never been done this well.</P>
<P>The special effects by Matthew Ferro are a visual feast.  Bullets can speed
up, slow down, and can also come to screeching halts.  People can run up
walls, jump into the air and linger, and then come crashing down with
enough force to crack pavement.  Then there are the subtle effects that are
added for style.  Look at the way that Ferro and the Wachowski brothers use
reflections in Morpheus's sunglasses.  These are some of the best effects
to ever hit the screen.</P>
<P>Performance wise, all performers give good performances.  Actually, I think
that the secret with the Wachowski brothers is that they do not tailor the
performances of the actors to the movie, but instead tailor the movie and
atmosphere to the actors.  Keanu Reeves, whom when not pressured to emote
too much, can turn in good performances.  He did just that in Speed and
Devil's Advocate; and he does it again in The Matrix.  Laurence Fishburne's
last foray into sci-fi was the horrible Event Horizon; this time around he
does much better.  Not only does he have better material to work with, but
he also has a part that is tailored to his acting style.  Fishburne is just
right for the part of Morpheus.  Carrie-Anne Moss, whom I've never seen as
a performer, puts in a wonderful performance as Trinity.  But, the
performer to notice is Hugo Weaving who is one of the Sentinel Agents
(imagine an evil version of the Men In Black).  Weaving uses a monotonous
flat performance that turns out to be one of the best in the film.</P>
<P>The thing that got to me after I stepped out of the theatre was the fact
that the film ends a bit too abruptly.  It leaves a question that I
couldn't figure out the answer to and that I thought could have been
answered in the film.  I'll reveal the question and I'll do it in such a
way not to spoil any fun: What are the freed people going to do in the
world that they're freed into?  This question is a nagging question that
the film glosses over with a voice-over that really doesn't tie things up
as tightly as could be.  But, this is only a small nuisance of the film.
Looking at the film as a whole, it is a well put together and entertaining
film.</P>
<P>Let me just reiterate: Don't Miss The Matrix.  This is one of the best
films of the year.  Please do catch this on the big screen, there are some
effects that are meant to be seen on the big screen.  You'll have to see
the film to find out the answer to the big question:</P>
