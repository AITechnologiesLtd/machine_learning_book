<P>Terrence Malick, widely regarded as one of the most visually stunning 
film directors of all time, made two films in the '70s, "Badlands" and 
"Days of Heaven," respectively, and then completely vanished for many 
years. His first film in twenty years, "The Thin Red Line," set during 
World War II, is like no other war picture I have ever seen; one of 
extraordinary beauty that goes beyond the norm of simply setting up 
characters and battles (even those the film does have these) and into a 
plain of astonishing metaphysics.</P>
<P>In a surprising turn from a regular movie set during a war which usually 
begins in the depths of a battle, "The Thin Red Line" starts out with an 
unidentified man (Jim Caviezal) gently walking around and observing a 
Melanesian village, where the natives all appear to be in a state of 
deep harmony. As I watched this striking prologue, the film really was 
able to fill me with a strange feeling of inner peace, especially in a 
small, moving scene where he has a warm conversation with one of the 
female natives who is holding her tired, young child. Eventually, this 
peaceful tranquility is interrupted with an oncoming war ship, and we 
discover that the man is actually the AWOL soldier, Private Witt, who is 
being picked up by his gruff commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Tall 
(Nick Nolte), and Sergeant Welsh (Sean Penn). The ship is headed for 
Guadalcanal, and soon we are placed directly in the middle of the 
infamous battle, where the soldiers alternate through voice narration in 
pondering some of their deepest thought about their lives and human 
nature, in general.</P>
<P>Due to the timing of the film, comparisons are inevitable between "The 
Thin Red Line" and last summer's "Saving Private Ryan," although they 
are actually quite different in style. While "Saving Private Ryan" 
contained graphic battle scenes, the film itself was undoubtedly more 
mainsteam and accessible for regular audiences, due to its neatly 
written characters and story, as well as the occasionally 
oversentimental emotions (after the success of "Patch Adams," I have 
realized how much most Americans love corny, melodramatic situations). 
"The Thin Red Line," on the other hand, plays like a lyrical poem, much 
more meditative and thought-provoking in its ideas and treatment. Not 
only that, but even though it is not as bloody as "...Ryan," I found 
myself much more enthralled with this picture, particularly in its 
reflective storytelling techniques and seemingly more realistic overall 
depiction of war.</P>
<P>"The Thin Red Line" has been almost unanonymously acclaimed by critics, 
but it has been seldomly criticized for its use of narration, which is 
said throughout the film by eight different characters, telling us their 
personal thoughts. Some critics object to the scholarly and overtly 
mature thoughts that are swarming in the soldiers' heads, which I find 
to be a rather offensive complaint towards those who have ever fought in 
a war. The truth is that humans naturally have many, many thoughts 
constantly in their minds, and I find it wholly believable that people 
under such life-threatening circumstances would think and question 
themselves about things of such importance and meaning.</P>
<P>For a large majority of its almost three-hour running time, "The Thin 
Red Line" is set in the midst of the battle of Guadalcanal, and it is 
here that we get to know the wide array of characters. Terrence Malick 
acquired a huge cast of people, both known and unknown, and it was only 
in the editing room that he structured the film, while trying to cut a 
rumored million feet of film down to three hours. Because of this, 
previously expected storylines were completely dropped and some cast 
members totally disappeared from the final cut, such as Bill Pullman and 
Lukas Haas. Regardless of this fact, and the unorthodox way that the 
characters enter and exit the picture without much of an introduction or 
farewell, I was pleasantly surprised that I still was able to get to 
know the people, even if it only was from body language or subtle 
observation. Ben Chaplin is, perhaps, the most effective in the cast as 
a soldier who often is reminiscing about his angelic wife (Miranda Otto) 
back home. As Witt, Jim Caviezal also makes an impression due to his 
brilliant performance in the opening section set at the Melanesian 
village. After "Affliction," Nick Nolte does another high-powered turn 
as the always-hollering Lt. Col. Tall, and obviously put his heart and 
soul (as well as his voice box) into the role. Finally, Woody Harrelson 
is heartbreaking as the doomed Sergeant Keck, and Elias Koteas 
poignantly portrays the scared and confused Capt. James Staros, who 
fears risking the lives of his men when ordered to ascend farther up the 
hill upon the Japanese enemies. The only flaw in the cast (and it isn't 
the actor's fault) is George Clooney, who appears right at the end and 
comes off as an example of pointless casting in order to get another 
"big name" star.</P>
<P>Coming away from "The Thin Red Line," I was not only struck by the 
intriguing questions the film brings up, but also the unforgettable 
images that appear throughout. As a visual stimulant, the recent "In 
Dreams" and this film certainly do the trick unlike anything else I've 
seen in a long time. As the camera gracefully moves among the giant, 
swaying blades of grass, the film causes you to feel like you have 
physically entered into the exotic setting. Other images of equal 
pulchritude include the shots of the sun gleaming through the trees; the 
bamboo stalks blowing in the wind; an alligator slowly descending into 
the depths of a river; and a fatally wounded baby chick wrestling around 
on the ground for dear life. For a mainstream audience used to 
conventional fare, "Saving Private Ryan" will most likely seem superior 
in their eyes because this film is more deliberately paced. However, for 
those viewers interested in a phenomenally more challenging piece of 
work, "The Thin Red Line" is the way to go. Along with Oliver Stone's 
"Platoon," "The Thin Red Line" is easily the best war film I have seen 
and, just in the way that Malick takes WWII and then is able to 
transform everything into a more meaningful tapestry about human nature, 
is an amazing triumph that proves what a master Terrence Malick is at 
his craft. Hopefully, he won't wait until the year 2018 to make his next 
masterwork.</P>
