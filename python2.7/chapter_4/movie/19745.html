<P>BESIEGED  (director: Bernardo Bertolucci; screenwriters:
Bertolucci/Clare Peploe/story by James Lasdun; cinematographer: Fabio
Cianchetti; cast: Thandie Newton (Shandurai), David Thewlis (Jason
Kinsky), Claudio Santamaria (Agostino), 1998)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The main characters don't speak much, he plays Mozart, Grieg, Bach and
Scriabin on the Steinway piano and she is his black African housekeeper,
Shandurai (Thandie), who doesn't undertand his Western music. She has
fled from an undemocratic African country after her schoolteacher
husband was imprisoned by the military for ridiculing the dictator.
Jason Kinsky (Thewlis) is the Englishman who has inherited from his
aunt, a splendid four-story Rome villa, which has a spiral staircase, a
garden patio, ornate statues and a dumbwaiter. He must be a rich man,
but he spends all his time giving piano lessons to children and pining
after Shandurai, living an almost reclusive existence.</P>
<P>His love for her is expressed in the passion he exhibits on the piano,
and is seen by us through the varied camera angled shots of the kindly
pianist peering down the spiral staircase at his beloved muse, or
looking at her ironing while she is animatedly listening to some African
pop sounds of Papa Wemba on the radio, with the steam coming out of the
iron. The sexual tension is building up-- as we are left to watch the
two quietly go about their household business, seemingly unable to
connect because of all the differences between them.</P>
<P>Shandurai polishes his artifacts, dusts the furniture, and mops his
floors. She is working her way through medical college, where she is an
A student. Her closest friend is a less serious student, Agostino
(Claudio Santamaria), who wants to sleep with her despite telling her
that he's gay.</P>
<P>Jason, wearing a nerd-like smile and displaying an awkward knack for the
art of casual conversation, can't control himself any longer one day and
grabs onto the startled girl, who does not respond to his gestures for
romance. He, in desperation, blurts out that he loves her and that he
will marry her, telling her that he'll do anything for her love. She
surprises him, by responding in an angry tone, that she is married and
what he could do for her is free her husband from prison.</P>
<P>Nothing more is said about that incident after Jason apologizes, saying
he didn't know she was married. But the house gradually becomes empty of
all the artifacts, tapestries, furniture, and finally the piano; and it
becomes obvious to her what Jason is doing. Their contact is now, even
more so, through the solo piano pieces he plays, as through his visits
to a local African church, he is able to learn how to blend in her
African music into his Western.</P>
<P>What is going on inside her, is seen through the marvelously constructed
dream sequences of her in Africa- as a griot, an African musical
storyteller, chants out an indecipherable medley of very potent songs-
that are very emotionally received by her. This is the kind of
filmmaking Bertolucci does best. There is an element of vague beauty and
mystery in these sequences that evoke a sense of wonder.</P>
<P>When she hears that her husband has been freed from prison, she gets
tipsy on a bottle of champagne and tries to write a thank you note to
Mr. Kinsky. When that fails to materialize as she wants it to, she finds
herself feeling a love for him and goes up to his bedroom, where she
finds him sound asleep from a night of drinking. Remaining in bed with
him until morning, when the doorbell rings and it is her husband at the
door, as the picture enigmatically ends, with us not quite sure who she
will remain with.</P>
<P>The beauty of the film lies in the interplay between the two strangers,
unbelievable as their roles are- she is too perfect and overachieving to
be credible and he gives up too much of himself to be considered
anything less than a saintly figure- as they wrestle with their
incomprehensible feelings and desires, struggling to face what is
present in front of them. Strangely enough, their past seems to be
becoming more and more inconsequential. The imponderable emotions of
love are caught in the music, the stunning visual spectacle of the film,
and in the quietude of their personalities. They are reaching out across
man-made barriers to a point where they can't avoid each other anymore,
and must stop being evasive. How this works out, is how hard to say. It
wasn't easy for me to be sure if love meant the same thing for both of
them. The glib ending didn't help me understand them any better, as it
felt like something was missing from their relationship, something that
either I didn't catch or something that was just left out of their
relationship that shouldn't have been.</P>
<P>Their acting was first-rate and very unnerving, we could see their
thinking and emotional process unfolding on screen; it is ultimately
what makes this film somewhat special.</P>
<P>The up and down career of Bertolucci, is up again after this less than
epic film (actually made for an hour TV program, but lengthened for the
sake of a feature movie). It is the kind of small art story that
Bertolucci seems to excel in more than with some of his more recent
commercial ventures (Little Buddha, The Last Emperor). That even though
this story was an obvious and abbreviated one, it was still a joy to
see. What the story means, is not tied in with some of the director's
political or psychological ideas of the past. This is more or less a
film that lives through its style and grace of letting the two of them
tell their story without much help from the script. And it worked out
better than these kind of films usually do, mainly because there is a
power in Bertolucci's direction that maybe someday he can put it all
together and live up to the potential that was once expected of him. All
his films are worth looking at, and this one more so than what I have
seen in a long time from him. It sort of grows on you, and seems more
emotionally satisfying the more you think about it.</P>
