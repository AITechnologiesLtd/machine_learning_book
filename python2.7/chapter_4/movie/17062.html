Running time: 108 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Who would have thought that a low budget British film about
two middle aged women would have been so damn heart wrenching, or,
indeed, so entertaining?</P>
<P>Jackie (Julie Walters) and Dawn (Brenda Blethyn) are life long
friends and sisters-in-law, who have grown up together in the working
class town of Rawtensell, in northern England.  They work together in
an electronics components factory and live in the same street.  Dawn
is self-sacrificing and reserved, and devoted to her family, while
Jackie is abusive, sharp, and combative, with a healthy disregard for
rules and authority.</P>
<P>The only escape from the drudgery of their work and domestic
environment is their weekly Friday night outing to the local Bingo
hall, where they can briefly dream of a better life.  Jackie and Dawn
have always shared their small winnings.  This night, Dawn wins the
jackpot, a piece of good luck that changes their lives in totally
unexpected ways.</P>
<P>Jackie finally finds the courage to leave her husband and quit
her boring job.  Then Dawn is struck down by a mysterious illness.
She is diagnosed with terminal cancer, but decides to keep it a secret
from her family while she undergoes treatment.  The worried Jackie
learns the truth, and, on a whim, whisks Dawn off to Las Vegas to
fulfil a life time dream in the short time she has left.  Along the
way, the two women learn much about themselves, their friendship and
their lives that enriches them.</P>
<P>Like Thelma And Louise, this warm and moving British film is a
wonderful testament to that special bond of friendship that develops
between two women.  However, Girls' Night is tinged with a haunting
air of poignancy given Dawn's terminal illness.  Kay Mellor
(Children's Ward, Band Of Gold, etc) was inspired to write the film
following the death of a close friend, which lends an emotional
potency to the story.  The script is rich in insight and perception,
and features a pair of warm, credible and beautifully developed
central characters about whom the audience comes to care deeply.</P>
<P>Blethyn has made the role of the feisty working class house
wife her own in recent years, but her performance as Dawn lends a
vibrancy to the film, giving the character an unexpected depth and
vulnerability.  She delivers a solid, touching performance that is
thankfully free of some of the clichéd nuances of more recent films
(In The Winter Dark, Music From Another Room, etc).</P>
<P>Walters, too, is well-suited to her role as the bold, brassy
and tarty Jackie, and delivers her best performance since her
breakthrough role in Educating Rita.  Kris Kristofferson's screen
comeback continues to go from strength to strength, and he gives a
sympathetic, likeable performance in the smaller role as Cody, the
ruggedly handsome cowboy the girls meet in Vegas.  The supporting cast
all deliver solid performances.</P>
<P>Nick Hurran, a veteran of tv dramas making his feature film
debut, handles the material with surprising empathy and compassion.
He wrings every laugh and tear from the material, without becoming
obviously manipulative.  The film beautifully evokes the drudgery of
life in a northern town with honesty.  Hurran depicts the glitz and
glamour of Las Vegas with the awe struck approach of an outsider
visiting the town for the first time.  He creates a wonderful contrast
between Las Vegas and the harsh environment of Rawtensell, in which
the characters are sustained only by their optimistic dreams.</P>
<P>Girls' Night is easily the best British tear jerker since Richard 
Attenborough's Shadowlands.         </P>
