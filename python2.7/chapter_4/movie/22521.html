CHASING AMY (director/writer: Kevin Smith; cinematographer: David Klein;
cast: Ben Affleck (Holden), Joey Lauren Adams (Alyssa), Jason Lee
(Banky), Dwight Ewell (Hooper), 1997)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This romantic comedy about the love life of comic book writers feels
like a sitcom because that is what it basically is, not withstanding,
that it pushes the envelope further out by having characters in it who
are more sexually active than the usual sitcom. Its story is also a bit
more arresting. Its strongest asset being the quick-witted and acidy
dialogue it brings to the table by its capable cast who are most able to
deliver those punch lines.</P>
<P>At a comic book fair in NYC, comic book writers and longtime friends,
Holden (Ben) and Banky (Jason), are signing autographs for their hit
comic "Bluntman and Chronic." In this scene we get a good dose of the
ambiance of the comic book world and we get a chance to see what their
readers are like and of how serious the writers are about the work they
do. We learn that they want to be looked upon as artists and not to be
taken for intellectual lightweights just because they work in the comic
book business.</P>
<P>A comic book writer, Alyssa (Joey) is introduced to them by another
comic book writer, Hooper (Dwight), who poses as a black militant,
hiding from his comic book audience that he is gay. It turns out that
Holden falls for Alyssa, and he also thinks they have much in common
since they both come from the same town in the New Jersey suburbs, but
what he doesn't realize, at first, is that she is a lesbian who is
unwilling to get into a relationship with a man. Their first meeting,
over a game of darts, gives Holden, what he calls a "shared moment."
Banky has a blast with this explanation.</P>
<P>The would-be lovers must take risks to make their relationship work.
Holden is the first to feel that he must be with Alyssa. He has led a
sheltered, somewhat nerdy life till now, still living in the Jersey
suburbs, while Alyssa is wild and alluring. She is very sexy, having a
deep-throaty voice and an open manner that makes it easy to talk to her.
But, having led a very active sexual life, experimenting with all sorts
of sexual encounters, she comes with a checkered past. Holden is able to
face up to her lesbian affairs but has difficulty in reconciling her
reckless sex with multiple male partners whom she does not even care
about. And it disturbs him that he has to find this out through gossip
and not from her; especially, when she seems to make such a big thing
about honesty in a relationship. Smith does an excellent job in showing
the doubts men have about being with a loose woman who they are smitten
with. Our hero is not a liberated hero, but it is his flaws that give
him credibility.</P>
<P>The twist in this story comes about in the part his wise-guy partner
plays in trying to destroy their relationship, out of jealousy. The film
gives this a surprising psychological meaning.The relationship between
the three of them becomes an unsmooth one, as they all battle the
mundane worries most people have in regards to love affairs,
friendships, and how it will affect them and their careers.</P>
<P>CHASING AMY is a moral fable. The title of the film derives from the
story the director himself tells to Holden, as he portrays a character
called Silent Bob. He tells them a story about a girl named Amy. She is
the girl who ran away from him because he didn't know how to handle the
situation he was in and he ended up losing the girl he loved. This scene
was not needed, as the story itself was simple enough to follow. We did
not need a ready made explanation of the film from the director.</P>
<P>Not everything worked or made sense, but the characters and their
problems seemed real. And, the dialogue hit the mark more often than
not. This is Smith's third film about the travails of young people
growing up in New Jersey and influenced by "pop" culture. What I didn't
like about the film, is that despite its attempts not to be viewed as a
sitcom, that is what this film is, even if its mature story line adds
more weight to it. Sitcoms are just not the way I like to see drama
unfolding, as it always leaves me thinking that things are still being
dumbed down, that even though, these are characters we usually do not
see on the screen and it is refreshing to see them; we are,
nevertheless, not going any deeper psychologically with this story and
with character portrayal than other sitcoms go.</P>
<P>Smith's film does give us a real sense of a relationship and the
struggle it takes to make it work, but there is still an air of
superficiality about its presentation.</P>
