Free Enterprise **1/2</PRE>
<P>rated R
Regent Entertainment
starring Eric McCormack, Rafer Weigel, William Shatner, Audie England,
Patrick Van Horn, Jennifer Sommerfield
written by Mark A. Altman and Robert Meyer Burnett
directed by Robert Meyer Burnett</P>
<P>Picture a Kevin Smith ("Clerks") movie with "Star Trek" enthusiasts
instead of "Star Wars" fans, and you'll have a pretty good idea of
what Robert Meyer Burnett's slightly amusing "Free Enterprise" is
like. "Free Enterprise" stars Eric McCormack and Rafer Weigel as Mark
and Robert, two L.A.  "trekkies" who are down on their luck as they
approach age 30. All that changes (for an instant) when they run into
their lifetime idol, "Star Trek's" William Shatner (mocking himself in
a brilliant performance), and their luck gradually changes (hey, the
plot is pretty thin). This even lower-budget version of "Swingers" has
its characters spouting out movie references in basically every line
of dialogue. While this is actually a lot of fun for a while, the
talkiness gradually wears thin by the end of the film (which is at
least 20 minutes too long). All in all, "Free Enterprise" is a nice
but overlong little indie flick that should make a decent rental. If
you're a trekkie in a rush to see William Shatner rapping, then check
"Free Enterprise" out in theatres, and don't expect too much.</P>
<P>Note: I know absolutely nothing about "Star Trek", so I have no idea
what this film's title means, and I have no idea of how this film is
from a trekkie perspective.</P>
