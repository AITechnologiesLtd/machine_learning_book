<PRE>Mystery, Alaska: hoosiers on ice</PRE>
<P>In 1976 Rocky said it once and for all: "I can't beat him. But that don't
bother me. The only thing I want to do is to go the distance, that's all."
The determined underdog, the noble nobody, the champion-in-waiting. These
are the things we love. Mystery, Alaska (re)delivers them, packaged nicely
in snow and isolation and every episode of Northern Exposure. Which isn't at
all a drawback: Northern Exposure had some strong writing. Refreshingly, so
does Mystery, Alaska, though of course it does--as the genre demands--dabble
the slightest bit in hero-making. But so be it. Heroism and sports are
synonymous in the American conscience. As are the Mighty Ducks and hockey.
And, not unlike Mighty Ducks, it does all come down to that one final
game--locals vs. the professionals--and it's all balanced such that
individual victories and team victories are interdependent, and there are
all the necessary enthematic rallies in the halftime locker room ('you've
got the rest of your lives,' etc), but, in spite of all these predictable
developments, Mystery, Alaska manages to set itself apart. Or, slightly
above.</P>
<P>This is due largely to Russell Crowe as John Biebe, the aging Sheriff
who--in the space of what has to be the most condensed 24 hours Mystery's
ever seen--gets bumped off the local hockey team, has to arrest one of his
players on shooting charges, and is called to investigate a 'mysterious'
helicopter carrying his wife's old flame Charles Danner (Hank Azaria) back
into town. Danner is of course bringing the news we already know from the
trailer: that the New York Rangers are coming to town. Soon enough
everything and everyone's in motion, preparing, anticipating, etc. Everyone
except Judge Burns (Burt Reynolds), that is, the pessimistic voice of reason
here. But he gets very little screentime, too, which makes it easy to get
caught up in the fervor of this small town attempting to prove itself
to/against the big city, which is nicely carried out on an individual level,
with Sheriff Biebe, who has to similarly prove himself to the town council
(who for some strange reason decide who gets to play in the weekly games).</P>
<P>But Crowe doesn't carry the movie himself. Mary McCormack as Donna Biebe is
the real show-stealer, in an understated way. And of course Skank (Ron
Eldard, with some good sitcom training) provides enough philandering humor
that things never get boring. They do however, get a little contrived in a
couple of places. The first of these is a court trial that, for a
legally-hip audience, either rings a bit false or isn't quite Liar Liar-ish
enough to mute our critical faculties. The second contrivance is the
so-called low point of the narrative, when all the characters are
simultaneously and conveniently hit with something from which it seems they
surely won't be able to recover. In addition, there's a strange little
teenage romance going on between the Judge's daughter and Stevie, the new
team star, a relationship which seems to have been written in largely for
comic effect, as it has no real relevance to the rest of the movie. It is
funny, though, and does make room for the best line of the movie, to the
Judge, from his wife, about his daughter's sex life, in response to his
question about what they're talking about without him: "If you don't leave
[the room] right now, I swear I'll tell you."</P>
<P>The Judge wisely backs out of the room, and Burt Reynolds is all hat-tipping
Bandit as he does.</P>
<P>What's nice about Mystery, Alaska are those kind of moments, where you
forget you're in a sports-movie and begin to suspect you might be getting
caught up in some of this small town drama, the lives of these characters
which are supposed to be just padding for the slow-motion action sequences.
Yes, though, in the end Mystery, Alaska is just Hoosiers on ice, but all the
same, Hoosiers was a good movie. Mystery, Alaska could have done far worse
for a role model.</P>
