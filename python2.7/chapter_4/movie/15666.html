<P>Back in 1951, the longshoreman-philosopher Eric Hoffer published his first
book "The True Believer : Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements" -- a
short, great treatise which made "True Believer" a catch-phrase that's as
valid now as ever. It's also at the root of The Siege.</P>
<P>Fanatics such as Mao's Red Guards or Europe's Red Brigades have been
treated in films abroad but rarely in American political thrillers.
Hollywood's richest fodder was the villainy of the Soviets. With the  Evil
Empire now gone, replacements are needed. Militant Islamic fundamentalists
can partly fill this void. This is what The Siege does.</P>
<P>Technically, all its production values are impressive, from sets,
photography, music score, crowd scenes and skillful editing. The latter
takes effect right away, with a montage that alternates between violence
and visual poetry.</P>
<P>A sheik who masterminds terrorists is driven in a Mercedes through the
beautiful emptiness of desert sands. In a bloody ambush, he is abducted by
the mysterious attackers. Cut to almost lyrical high shots of a mosque in
New York City, where a muezzin (the Muslim man who calls the hours of
prayer) chants beautifully from a minaret, as the faithful pray, and as a
panoramic view of the Big Apple appears.</P>
<P>In  the city's One Federal Plaza, Anthony "Hub" Hubbard (Denzel Washington)
leads the FBI's New York anti-terrorist unit. Anonymous threats demand the
sheik's liberation. Words become acts, a string of bombings:  of a bus, a
Broadway theater, the Federal Building itself. An attack on a school is
thwarted. The body count is in the hundreds.</P>
<P>The FBI reacts with surveillance,chases and arrests. It's a duel of Good
vs. Bad, manicheistic but not in the simplistic way of westerns with their
immediately identified evildoers and heroes.</P>
<P>The side of Good focuses on Hub and his Lebanon-born buddy Frank Haddad,
well-played by Tony Shalhoub who was US-born in  a Lebanese family. The
other lead role goes to CIA operative Elise Kraft, (Annette Bening).</P>
<P>The FBI is a melting-pot of Oriental-Americans, African-Americans and
Everything-Else-Americans. Hub mobilizes them, barks his orders, puts the
agents go instantly into high gear. These use high-tech plus deductive
reasoning. You might think that the ethnic rainbow's political correctness
is too neat, its lighting efficiency too much, but we outsiders cannot tell
whether we are witnessing real life or movie life. What matters is that
there is convincing verisimilitude on the screen.</P>
<P>The lead trio are forceful,look good and credibly intelligent. There may be
some deja vu with the two men but there's none in Elise's  quite original
role. It underlines both the rivalry and the cooperation between FBI and
CIA. Ms. Bening's physical appearance is carefully calculated. Her makeup
does not hide her age; she is attractive but not glamorous, lively but not
artificially cute. Her persona is full of interesting ambiguities, of
role-playing and true feelings, of using charm and sexuality to infiltrate
the terrorists. She may also have the best pragmatic line in the film when
she admits that no politics and policies can be simon-pure, that there are
no clear-cut rights and wrongs, that one "has to choose the right that is
the least wrong."</P>
<P>The film's first part is a fine thriller. The second half expands in ways
that have caused controversy and indignation among Arab-Americans. As the
terrorist menace swells, the American President (Clinton, in genuine TV
appearances) is under pressure. He has to resort to martial law, with
General Devereaux (Willis) in charge.</P>
<P>An unpleasant, dour man who dislikes Hub and Elise, Devereaux has tunnel
vision, sees himself as the country's savior, and proves to be another type
of True Believer.  Set on rounding up as many Arab-American male New
Yorkers as possible-- including the US-born--he does with a cold gusto that
includes executing a suspect.</P>
<P>New York in a state of siege is like an occupied country. The procedures
remind you of the treatment of Japanese-Americans during WW II;  of the
stadiums full of arrestees in Pinochet's Chile (cf. the movie Missing); of
the Nazis' Kristallnacht in November1938 rampage against the Jews, and of
the later herdings that led to death camps.</P>
<P>The developments pit Frank, Hub and Elise against the unbearably arrogant
Devereaux. Crucial questions are raised, but they take on a melodramatic,
rather simplistic, rhetorical shape that hurts the movie. It would have
been better to debate the issues in depth and to give some dimensions to
the Arab-Americans. But then there would not have been all the slam-bang of
Part II -- and there's something in Hollywood that abhors physical
inaction. The joke here is that the long second half is filmically much
less exciting than the first.</P>
<P>The Siege's subject is inherently tricky and touchy. Even before iys
release, the film sparked protests by Arab-Americans, including the Arab
Anti-Defamation League. It is roughly the same situation as for Godard's
Hail Mary and Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ. Both movies were
boycotted even before they came out . (Later, in Paris, there was even  a
fire bombing  of the theater showing the Scorsese).</P>
<P>It is a given that in real life there are Good People and Bad People of any
creed, race and color--perhaps with the exception of Icelanders who seems
to be all good. Islamic terrorists however, what with the almost daily
headlines, have special visibility in the West. (Arabs in general even
stand out visually  because of the women's clothing). Even though the movie
goes to some lengths (some of them awkard) to stress that the the acts of a
few taint unfairly the many good people, you can't blame Arab-Americans for
worrying.</P>
<P>On the other hand, director Zwick is a liberal whose heart generally seems
to be in the right place. Witness his Glory and his Courage Under Fire
(both with Denzel Washington). In a sense, his making The Siege, flaws and
all, was something of an act of courage under fire.</P>
