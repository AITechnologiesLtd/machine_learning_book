<P>
 Three to Tango (1999) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Matthew Perry, Neve
Campbell, Dylan McDermott and Oliver Platt.</P>
<P> "Three to Tango" is a comical farce about mistaken identity - sexual
mistaken identity.</P>
<P> But what the movie, directed by Damon Santostefano, cannot clearly focus
on is its attitude toward gays.</P>
<P> The premise is straight out of one of those screwball comedies of the
1930s and '40s.</P>
<P> Oscar Novak (Matthew Perry) and Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt) are
partners in an architectural firm, bidding on a multimillion-dollar project
by tycoon Charles Newman (Dylan McDermott).</P>
<P> Through a misunderstanding, Newman is led to believe that Novak and
Steinberg are not only partners in business, but in their private lives.</P>
<P> Thus, thinking Oscar "safe," the married millionaire asks the young
architect to keep an eye on his mistress, Amy Post (Neve Campbell), an
artist.</P>
<P> Of course, Oscar and Amy fall in love, and complications and
misunderstandings abound, creating comedic situations.</P>
<P> What seems a bit unclear in the screenplay by Rodney Vaccaro and Aline
Brosh Viviano, based on a story by Vaccaro, are their feelings toward gays.</P>
<P> Throughout the film, the script has Oscar constantly denying that he is
homosexual as well as feeling embarrassed and humiliated by the entire
situation.</P>
<P> In the final reel, Oscar gives one of those heartfelt speeches that is an
affirmation of not judging people by their sexual preference, but looking
at them as individuals and at their accomplishments.</P>
<P> The scene also features one of the latest - most annoying - clichés to
creep into movies: the single clap. After someone finishes a speech or
accomplishes something special there is dead silence until one person
stands and begins applauding. Then another person joins in and another,
until the entire room or arena or stadium is on its feet.</P>
<PRE> It's not a new idea, of course.</PRE>
<P> Perry is very adept at physical comedy as he takes shots to the head and
groin and gets tackled by a football player who falls for him after his
"coming out."</P>
<P> Campbell is luscious as the free-spirited artist. She glows on screen.</P>
<P> McDermott is appropriately sleazy as the two-timing villain of the piece,
while Pratt easily steals the movie as the wise-cracking gay partner, who,
ironically, McDermott's Newman believes is straight.</P>
<P> "Three to Tango" is a lightweight, enjoyable romp. It's not too deep, nor
is it preachy. It is what it is. Don't expect anything more.</P>
