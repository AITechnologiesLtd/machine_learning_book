<P>When we last saw Ellen Ripley, she was.. Dead!  And she took the alien
with her.  This was not a good business decision for a promising
franchise.  Director David Fincher (Seven, The Game) had been undercut
by the Fox studio, and his Alien3 was not up to expectations.  At that
point, wrapping it up may have seemed like a good idea to all
concerned.  But, much like the Frankenstein monster, the Alien character
was too compelling to just fade away.  Many Alien graphic novels
continued to flourish, showing that the faithful were out there,
betrayed, but waiting patiently.   Scripts with and without Ripley were
tossed around, and one story finally emerged, resurrecting the franchise
AND Ripley.  You sorta have to look the other way when they clone
Ripley, but hey, it's a small price to get our story back on track.</P>
<P>        The movie opens 200 years later, when the evil Weyland-Utani
corporation has turned everything over to the military.  On a special
lab-spaceship, a secret team of doctors is trying to clone Ripley. 
Using a blood sample taken back on the prison planet in Alien3, they
bring back Ellen AND the Alien, so that they can harvest the Alien. 
This is fast-and-loose Sci-Fi science, so why not let Ripley retain
memories, too?  The scientists get their alien queen specimen, and
busily start to bring about their own demise.  The Ripley clone is kept
as a curiosity, and indeed she is.  With some alien DNA in her, she has
uncommon strength, her blood is caustic acid, and she has an eerie,
alert demeanor.  It is probably formed as much by predator instincts as
by the condescending treatment from the doctors.  She maintains her
alien-fighting chops, but also displays a disturbing empathy with the
beasts.  </P>
<P>         A cargo of human victims is acquired from some space pirates, who sell
the cryo-tubes from a hijacked ship.  These colorful characters are
still aboard when the aliens predictably break loose and overrun the
ship.   Lots of military-types are killed and many get away in escape
pods.  This leaves Ripley, the pirates, one evil scientist, and one
impregnated victim - embarking on their own Poseidon Adventure to get
back to the pirates' ship.  Additional urgency is added by the fact that
the lab-ship is programmed to return to Earth in an emergency.  This
last detail is unnecessary to the story, but essential to the set-up for
Alien 5.</P>
<P>        Nigel Phelps' production design is good, retaining the grungy, lived-in
look for the spaceships.  The casting is quirky.  Winona Ryder seems out
of place, but her character deserves more attention as the story
develops.  Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet brought along his two stars from
City of Lost Children:  Ron Perlman is colorful playing an pirate bully,
and Dominique Pinon adds a lot as a resourceful paraplegic.  Dan Hedaya
does a good job as the pragmatic military commander.  He runs a tight
ship but comfortably deals with the pirates under the table.  B-movie
ghoul Brad Dourif gets an A-movie, but they saddle him with a lot of the
embarrassing scientific explanations.</P>
<P>        Successful sequels need to reprise signature elements, but they must
improve them to justify the effort. We get Sigourney Weaver back, but
she's not really Ripley.  The pirates are certainly more colorful than
the prisoners from Alien3.  Much of the action is obligatory and
predictable.  There's some new stuff showing a swimming alien, and the
puzzling addition of a new, mammalian alien.  Other alien appearances
are mostly head and teeth, rarely showing us the exquisitely grotesque
creature designed by H. R. Giger (who is more than a little miffed by
not being mentioned in the credits).</P>
<P>        Individual evaluation of these offerings will vary widely.  Those
hungry for another episode will be happy enough, especially when they
see the built-in Alien5 potential.  Skeptics worried about the mercenary
motives of the producers may be less patient.  Newcomers may be lost,
since the screenplay does not provide them enough exposition.  Alien3
has had the impact of a baseball strike.  The franchise may recover, but
Wynona Ryder is no Ken Griffey Jr.</P>
