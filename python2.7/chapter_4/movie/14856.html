<P>Plot: By accident GP John Dolittle suddenly rediscovers his forgotten 
childhood ability to talk to animals. He is promptly driven around the 
bend as animals everywhere come to him seeking help. His family think 
him crazy while his seemingly eccentric behaviour threatens a corporate 
takeover of his practice.</P>
<P>I grew up with Hugh Lofting's original Dr Dolittle stories written in 
the 1920s and still remember their delightfully fabulist charms - not 
unakin to the absurdist joys of a Pippi Longstocking or a 'Wind in the 
Willows'. So you may understand my bias against this current adaption of 
the stories. This is a version that might be politely termed a 
bastardization. About all the film has in common with the stories is the 
central concept of a doctor who can talk to animals - with everything 
else having been tossed out. It does have a brief scene in common with 
the 1967 film version where Dolittle gets thrown in an asylum but other 
than that the stories have been fed through the modern American 
children's film formula. Out has gone the period setting and all of Dr 
Dolittle's fantastical encounters with exotic animals - the talking 
hamsters and tigers here, technically superb and all as they are, sadly 
never compensate for the lack of any Push-Me-Pull-You's or Giant Pink 
Snails. Instead we have a cute, feelgood film which is merely about a 
character with an outlandish gift. The film wheels out all the cliches 
associated with this sort of comedy - the doctor's family thinking him 
crazy, the one-dimensional tightass villains, trite little speeches 
about being special, the doctor's eventually proving himself and 
everybody accepting his gift. The 1967 film version may not have been 
particularly good but it certainly had more of the spirit of the 
originals than this does.</P>
<P>The film is directed by Betty Thomas, a former actress best known for 
the part of Lucy Bates, the beat-cop with a frustrated mothering complex 
on tv's 'Hill Street Blues'. Thomas began to branch out into directing 
with the likes of the highly acclaimed tv movie 'My Breast' (1994) and 
received a Best Directing Emmy nomination for the tv movie 'The Late 
Shift' (1996) about the network wars between the David Letterman and Jay 
Leno talkshows. Thomas then broke into feature films and had notable 
success with 1995's 'The Brady Bunch Movie' followed by 1997's 'Private 
Parts' about the on-air hijinks of Howard Stern.</P>
<P>Unfortunately Thomas is not a very good director. 'The Brady Bunch 
Movie' consisted only of  a single-note joke about sarcastically 
puncturing the original tv series' naivete, and 'Private Parts' seemed 
entirely taken up by a scatological admiration for its subject matter 
Howard Stern's adolescent on-air antics. 'Dr Dolittle' might have been a 
funnier film if it had a better director - there are several scenes like 
Dolittle being caught giving mouth-to-mouth to a hamster or acting as an 
animal therapist that would have been hilarious on paper. But under 
Thomas's hand the film grovels in an extraordinary excess of toilet 
humour - a fat lady getting a hamster stuck in the crack of her butt; a 
rectal probe becoming lost up a dog's ass; CPR being performed on a rat 
only to find it is a pent-up fart. The talking animals are voiced with 
the irritating people-saying-silly-things-in-falsetto-voices that shows 
like 'America's Funniest Home Videos' seem to regard as the height of 
humour. The film stars funny man Eddie Murphy who over the last couple 
of years has been trying to rejuvenate a flagging career by reinventing 
himself in fantasy films but the film fails to give him any opportunity 
to open up and do the wild and crazy things he does best. In all a sad 
and lamentable vulgarization of a fine set of children's stories.</P>
