<PRE>       HAPPINESS
       --------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            GRADE: A</PRE>
<P>       Proving that the spiky and affecting WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE
       was no fluke, writer/director Todd Solondz follows up with a
       harrowing comedy about pain, isolation, and dysfunction in
       New York and New Jersey. With a scope and ambition that
       serves him well, Solondz cross-cuts his narrative among the
       stories of an extended family, crafting a remarkably coherent
       story out of these increasingly disquieting vignettes. Think
       of Altman's SHORT CUTS reimagined for the East Coast, or Neil
       La Bute's YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS with less smug distance.
       The key difference between Solondz and La Bute? Compassion.</P>
<P>       Photographs of Solondz suggest a bespectacled geek who bears
       a close resemblance to Dawn Wiener, the girl who slogged
       through DOLLHOUSE's bleak junior high school universe. That
       persona seems to have splintered in Happiness into myriad
       character types. There's Helen Jordan (Lara Flynn Boyle), a
       black-clad poet who knocks 'em dead at readings and book
       signings, but secretly believes her work is presumptuous and
       insincere. In search of gritty experience, Helen is intrigued
       by an obscene phone call from Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman),
       an overweight basket case who's working his way through the
       phone book, masturbating bitterly.</P>
<P>       Allen also rings Helen's sister Joy (Jane Adams), a
       soft-spoken songwriter who's emotionally pummelled by the
       equally needy people around her. (Pretending to be an
       acquaintance, he asks her what she's wearing and she responds
       sweetly and naively, unaware that she's being had.) The third
       sister, and the only one to have married, is Trish (Cynthia
       Stevenson), who has a husband, a home, and a family -- the
       kind of life that Helen claims to covet. The neighbor kids
       call Trish's psychiatrist husband (Dylan Baker) "Dr.
       Maplewood." Bill Maplewood seems to be a gentle,
       understanding father, but he's also a pedophile spiralling
       out of control. In a sequence that's both wryly comic and
       horrific, he slips a Mickey into a boy's tuna sandwich during
       a sleepover, the better to take advantage of him. What's most
       heartbreaking is the relationship between Bill and his son,
       who share an uncommon (and unsettling, given the context)
       candor about sex. The whole film moves inexorably toward a
       wrenching conversation between the two that once again
       crystallizes Solondz' regard for childhood as trial by fire.</P>
<P>       If the synopsis above sounds like it may be too much to take
       in one 134-minute sitting, be grateful I haven't described
       the separation of the Jordan sisters' parents after 40 years
       of marriage (executed with sangfroid and loneliness by Ben
       Gazzara and Louise Lasser), the Russian cab driver's game, an
       early outburst from the spurned lover played by Jon Lovitz,
       or the fate of Pedro the doorman. Despite the considerable
       downers, what's most notable about Happiness may be its
       seamless fusion of low comedy and human tragedy. Solondz
       recognizes that, no matter how bleak this life may be,
       there's also something fundamentally absurd about our
       day-to-day struggle toward "happiness," and a reassurance to
       be had in the bitter humor that accompanies unspeakable
       sorrow. Accordingly, the performances he draws from his cast
       beg us to recognize that humor without resort to mockery or
       caricature.</P>
<P>       Particularly crucial is Baker's finely tuned portrait of that
       most chilling incongruity, a family man and child raper. In a
       film peppered with slatternly depictions of humanity,
       allegedly sick humor, and twice as much semen as I've seen in
       any mainstream flick, the one element that led Universal
       Pictures to disown HAPPINESS (which was set to be released by
       their adventurous October Films division) was its refusal to
       imagine Maplewood as a monster. All the credit goes to
       Baker's portrayal of a man who, calmly, quietly, and with
       little apparent soul-searching, leaps into his own abyss.</P>
<P>       Against the odds, Solondz makes all of these bits work as a
       whole through canny scripting and characterization.
       Sometimes, it's like watching a car crash. Individual moments
       may seem cruel, mean-spirited or even deliberately "shocking"
       (in a couple of scenes, he may go too far out on the limb in
       search of one more outrageous twist), but Solondz plays fair
       with these misfits and criminals, using them as narrative
       prisms, each reflecting fragments of our own lives back at
       us.</P>
<P>       Having crafted two movies that take a clear-eyed, deeply felt
       gander at the dark truths undermining the sunny ideal of
       American life, Solondz is more than just another hipster
       angling for shock value. He shares with the best filmmakers a
       wit, self-assurance and off-kilter grace that enable him to
       stare down his demons decisively, even as he conjures new
       ones. Having arrived on the stagnant "indie" film scene just
       when we needed him most, Solondz takes his place among the
       most fearless and incisive directors working today.
