<P>A WALK ON THE MOON **1/2  Directed by Tony Goldwyn; written by Pamela
Gray; director of photography, Anthony Richmond; edited by Dana Congdon;
music by Mason Daring; production designer, Dan Leigh; produced by Dustin
Hoffman, Goldwyn, Jay Cohen, Neil Koenigsberg, Lee Gottsegen and Murray
Schisgal; released by Miramax Films.CAST: Diane Lane (Pearl Kantrowitz),
Viggo Mortensen (Walker Jerome), Liev Schreiber (Marty Kantrowitz), Anna
Paquin (Alison Kantrowitz), Tovah Feldshuh (Lilian Kantrowitz), Bobby
Boriello (Daniel Kantrowitz), et al. 107 minutes. R  (sex).</P>
<P>A nice movie, even though it is too slow, too long, has overly neat and
predictable developments, and is unsubtle (but then its people are
unsubtle, too).</P>
<P>It's the first directorial effort by actor Tony Goldwyn, the grandson of
the famous Sam Goldwyn who created MGM. It is also the first filmed script
by Pamela Gray. She wrote it as her thesis for the UCLA Film Department,
and the scenario attracted much attention.</P>
<P>The movie (shot in Canada's Laurentians standing in for the Catskills )
centers on Pearl Kantrowitz (Lane), a young and comely mother of two,
Alison (Paquin) 14, and much younger Daniel. Her husband Marty (Schreiber)
is a Brooklyn TV-repairman. The time is the summer of 1969. Marty drives
his family, including his mother Lilian (Feldshuh) to the low-end Jewish
resort of Dr.Fogler's bungalows. Marty, like many other, unretired men, has
to go back to work and gets to the bungalows only on weekends.</P>
<P>Pearl is a pretty woman with a beautiful figure -- often displayed. She is
vaguely dissatisfied with her life.  Married to Marty when she was a
teenager (and pregnant with Alison), she has known no other men (carnally,
that is) and is also aware of the hippie culture of the times, and the
"freedom" that goes with it.</P>
<P>While, at the resort, rather too neatly Alison gets her first period and
her first boyfriend, Pearl meets Walker (Mortensen), aka The Blouse Man. He
is a peddler of women's garments, an itinerant dweller of his bus
shop-plus-home. Pearl has an affair with him. Marty finds out. But there's
a probably (and certainly contrived) happy ending.</P>
<P>AWOTM does a good job in its observation of people, that is, its nucleus of
the five Kantowitzs plus Walker. The other characters are strictly an
uncluttering background, which is good -- even though contemporary
Jewish-American filmmakers (Gentiles would not dare !) including this
picture's, tend to overdo ethnic accents, manners and mannerisms. They add
to them touches of irony (granted this is often warm) that can border on
the tiresome.</P>
<P>However, the Kantowicz family is free of ethnic touches, except for old pro
Tovah Feldshuh who portraysa most original and sweet mother-in-law. All the
people in the film are real, even veristic, which amounts to their being
rather dull, as most terra-firmans are. But the main problem is not there.
It is in the construction.</P>
<P>First come the symbols, metaphors, parallels and improbabilities, starting
with the movie's title. The summer of 69 was the summer of the first man to
walk on the moon (Neil Armstrong on 20 July). While the gathered
bungalow-dwellers watch on TV the liberation of earthlings, and rejoice,
Pearl, inside Walker's bus, goes into sexual orbit and finds her own sexual
liberation. Too pat.</P>
<P>The coincidental mother-and-daughter newfound sexuality? Too pat. Later,
Walker and Pearl cavort and make love under a waterfall, but the camp's
denizens do not notice. Improbable. The Woodstock Rock Festival   (15-17
August), held not at Woodstock but in Bethel , N.Y., is too conveniently
close to  Dr. Fogler's Bungalows. Alison and new boyfriend Ross scoot  over
to the festival where she spots her Ma writhing with abandon with her
lover. Too much. When Pearl takes to the road, in the rain, the itinerant
Walker just happens to be driving by.   Young Daniel gets strung by bees
--at a providential time that triggers his dad's return to the resort. Too
pat. And so on.</P>
<P>I 'll  make an educated guess here. As a film student, script-writer Pamela
Gray must have most certainly seen several classic movies. Her scenario is
under the sign of at least three masterpieces of the 30s and 40s: The Rules
of the Game (France), Casablanca (US), Brief Encounter (UK).</P>
<P>In The Rules of the Game, Renoir went to some careful preparations before
the wife of the host, testing a small monocular, spies her husband
embracing his (now-ex) mistress.  In  AWOTM, Alison, using unexplained
binoculars, spots Pearl and Walker within a crowd of hundreds of thousands!</P>
<P>In Casablanca, Rick parting with Ilsa utters the famous "it doesn't take
much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill
of beans in this crazy world."  He is right, but such is the power of that
movie that, paradoxically, those problems do affect the audience. Which is
not the case in AWOTM, where, as in many more movies, private or domestic
problems affect the characters but not the public. Such  movies do not go
beyond their own borders.</P>
<P>Brief Encounter is a masterpiece among films in general and love stories in
particular. The short-lived affair, with no sex, between married Celia
Johnson and Trevor Howard is so achingly beautiful that it can haunt you
for years. What is important for the characters is certainly not trite for
us.</P>
<P>This said, the principals' performances are very good. For Diane Lane, Liev
Schreiber and to an extent, Anna Paquin, their roles are difficult yet
deliver the goods with great conviction. Lane's debut was as a ravishing
teen-ager in A Little Romance (1979). She made a lovely Paulette Goddard in
Chaplin (1992), but her career has had few memorable roles. Her Pearl feels
like a comeback.</P>
