<PRE>                                   TWIST
                   A film review by David N. Butterworth
        Copyright 1993 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<P>     Promoting itself as "an instructional dance film," TWIST purports
to chronicle the evolution of rock-and-roll dance.  Instead it jumbles
together a wide and disjointed assortment of nostalgic images, leaving
the audience to figure out what it's all about.  As a result, TWIST is
a dance documentary with two left feet.</P>
<P>     The film is structured as eight dance "lessons," complete with
flashy title boards, but there's nothing especially unique to be
learned from each section.  Canadian producer/director Ron Mann uses a
combination of old film and television footage and interviews with now
middle-aged AMERICAN BANDSTAND dancers and recording artists.  He
spotlights these performers by having them jiggle in front of heavily
stylized backgrounds and, frankly, it's embarrassing.</P>
<P>     It's clear from the observations of Betty (Romantini) Begg, Carole
(Scaldeferri) Spada and Floss (Harvey) Mancini why they are dancers,
not commentators, as Mann allows them to ramble on even though they
have almost nothing to say.  In addition, Hank Ballard, Joey Dee, and
to some extent Chubby Checker come across as egotistical jerks--surely
not the director's intention.</P>
<P>     The film kicks off with the early 1950s, when ballroom dancing was
all the rage.  In the juke joints and nightclubs of Harlem, places like
Smalls, The Apollo and The Savoy, a rising young star called Hank
Ballard and his group the Midnighters were performing their hits, songs
like "Get It," "Sexy Ways," and the infamous "Work With Me Annie."
Ballard's lyrics were raw and suggestive.</P>
<P>     With the arrival of such notables as Elvis Presley, disc jockeys
on radio stations like Philadelphia's WDAS stopped calling Ballard's
style of music R&B and started calling it rock and roll--"to attract
the white kids."  On WFIL-TV's AMERICAN BANDSTAND, regulars on the show
started imitating the black kids and claiming the dance steps as their
own. Mann's interview with BANDSTAND dancers Joan (Buck) Kiene and
Jimmy Peatross attempts to illustrate how the white mainstream ripped
off the African- American culture.  As a political message it's too
simplistic; Mann lingers on their shallow repetitiveness and misses the
opportunity to make a major statement.</P>
<P>     Most of the information presented in TWIST isn't new--the fact
that rock and roll was considered to be a "communicable disease" under
Eisenhower's presidency, for example--but the section on the Twist
itself is informative and well-structured.</P>
<P>     In 1959, Ballard's recording "The Twist" took the nation by
storm.  Twisting was easy; you just moved your hips.  As legend has it,
Dick Clark assumed that the song would be too dirty coming from
Ballard, and it didn't show up on BANDSTAND until the cleaner-imaged
Chubby Checker recorded his version in 1960.  A year later the dance
had become a world-wide sensation and the song returned to number one,
spawning over 300 Twist spin-offs. It was probably the first time those
immortal words "It's got a good beat and you can dance to it" were
spoken on prime time TV.  At a New York club called the Peppermint
Lounge, Manhattan's rich and famous were rubbing shoulders with the
commonfolk to get in on the action.</P>
<P>     For a brief moment the film becomes quite fascinating; we learn
how influential the Twist really was, starting fashion trends and
saturating popular culture.  If only the rest of the film could have
maintained this momentum.  Unfortunately, Mann follows this portion of
the film with a downward-spiraling epilogue that simply flings more
contrived dance floor maneuvers in our face.  The Swim, the Jerk, the
Watusi--all less successful derivations.  The Hully Gully and the
Hucklebuck; imitations that paled by comparison.  When the British
invaded in 1964, one kind of musical hysteria was traded for another.</P>
<P>     For all the shimmying and shaking going on in the film, TWIST is
amazingly lacking in energy.  The archive footage is varied and often
fun (a clip in which Marshall McLuhan shares his thoughts on the dance
craze, for example, is a howl), but Mann does very little with it.
Many scenes lack continuity.  After a while, the frenzied
black-and-white footage of teenagers bopping and jitterbugging becomes
repetitive and ultimately boring.  It's hard to tell the Fly from the
Frug, the Millie from the Monkey.  Even though TWIST runs only
seventy-eight minutes, it's a long haul.</P>
<P>     It's not clear whether TWIST is supposed to be a celebration, a
tribute, or a condensed history lesson.  As a simple account of dance
styles from the Fifties and Sixties, it's poorly-conceived (it would
have made a fine short film).  For all its instructional aspirations,
TWIST doesn't know when to lead and when to follow.</P>
