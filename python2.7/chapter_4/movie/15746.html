<P>Hurlyburly is a very black comedy adapted by David Rabe from his own play. 
On the surface, it is about a misogynistic casting director (Sean Penn)
trying to save his relationship with his girlfriend (real-life wife Robin
Wright-Penn), but actually it is an existential treatise on communication,
or more accurately, the lack thereof.  Unfortunately, director Anthony
Drazan is not particularly adept at transcending the stage origins of the
material.  He is not the most visually stimulating director and hasn't much
perception on how to use cinematic space.  Apparently though, he is quite
good with actors.  Sean Penn supplies one of the year's best performances
in his courageous and revealing depiction of Eddie, a Hollywood casting
director constantly snorting cocaine.  Chazz Palmenteri is excellent as
Eddie's best friend, Phil, an unemployed actor who gets his points across
with threats and violence.  Even better is Kevin Spacey playing Mickey,
Eddie's deeply sarcastic roommate and business partner.  I am convinced now
that Spacey is easily one of the best actors working today.  Penn has
already long held that status.  Robin Wright-Penn, Garry Shandling, and
Anna Paquin are all fine even if their performances don't quite stand out. 
The only actor who does not pull her load is Meg Ryan, here as an
intelligent prostitute (apparently wearing the most wondrous of
wonderbras).  Regardless of what's going on around her, whether she's just
been pushed out of a moving car or is planning a day at Disneyland, Ryan
essentially keeps the same tone in her voice.</P>
<P>Hurlyburly is really about how the characters cannot understand one
another.  All of them with the exception of Mickey constantly ramble on
until they forget what they themselves are talking about.  Half the time,
they realize they don't even have the vocabulary to communicate their
points and their tirades dwindle into gibberish like "blah blah blah!" 
Even when they say what they mean, the other characters are either in
denial or thinking they're talking about something else.  Eddie is pulled
between spiritualist Phil and the utter realist Mickey.  Phil looks for
answers to his problems in fate and destiny or even Judaic mysticism. 
Mickey, on the other hand, always makes Phil the butt of his jokes.  Eddie
envies Mickey's ability to deal with reality unstintingly while looking to
Phil and his metaphysics for some hope in his life.</P>
<P>Despite the film's aspirations, it never quite fulfills its potential.  It
often plods along aimlessly, and has a few too many contrivances such as
when Anna Paquin's character reappears at the end for an attempted but
unfulfilling catharsis.  Still, if the film doesn't give answers to its
existential angst, it at least asks the right questions.</P>
