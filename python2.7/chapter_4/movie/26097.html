<P>_Dancer_in_the_Dark_ (R) **** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Without question, the love-it-or-hate-it reaction that greeted Lars von
Trier's _Dancer_in_the_Dark_ at this year's Cannes Film Festival will be
duplicated as the film slowly rolls out in theatres across the country. 
The controversial winner of this year's Palme d'Or is a film that not
only challenges conventional explanation, it also defies easy analysis. 
But given the dramatic effect--both positive and negative--that it has on
audiences, it can be agreed that <i>Dancer in the Dark</i> is a film like
no other, and even if only to simply bear witness to such a bold,
experimental work, it commands a viewing.</P>
<P>However, I believe there is a lot more to _Dancer_ than simple curiosity
value, and I think my--and the rest of the film's fans'--embrace of the
film stems from an idea suggested in a comment that von Trier made (which
has also been echoed by co-star Catherine Deneuve) about the film's star,
Icelandic music sensation Björk (who won the Best Actress prize at
Cannes): "She can't really act; she can only feel."  Similarly, I think
the key to appreciating _Dancer_ is not to watch it, but to "feel" it--to
experience the raw gamut of emotions it thrusts upon the audience
throughout its 140 minutes.</P>
<P>This idea of "feeling"--and the big debate over the film--is established
long before a single image appears on screen.  _Dancer_ begins with a
somber five-minute overture accompanied by a black screen, and it would
be easy to dismiss it as a pompously pretentious move.  But it also
clearly announces two of von Trier's objectives in this film: first, to
evoke the spirit of the grand melodramas of yesteryear; and second, to
immerse the audience the point of view of his main character, Selma
Jezkova (Björk).</P>
<P>Selma, a Czech immigrant trying to carve out a living as a punch press
operator in the 1960s Pacific Northwest, is going blind.  Keeping Selma
going as her condition rapidly deteriorates is the love of and for her
12-year-old son Gene (Vladica Kostic) and her love for the lavish
Hollywood screen musicals.  The latter initially manifests itself in
Selma's life in her ability to imagine music out of everyday sounds. 
While the strains of the overture don't derive from such a recognizable
source noise, this opening gets the general idea across: the audience
sees darkness yet can hear music, much like how Selma experiences her
reality.</P>
<P>A number of writers as well as distributor Fine Line Features have been
remarkably indiscreet about divulging details about _Dancer_'s story; in
fact, the film's trailer gives away one critical plot point.  I won't do
that myself though I will say this  much more about the story: Selma's
condition is hereditary, and she puts away every single penny of her
negligible factory wages toward an operation that would save Gene from
her literally dark fate.  To say more than that is to say too much,
making the temptation to include spoilers quite understandable--there
really isn't much to von Trier's story.  That has also been leveled as a
criticism of the film, but I think it's a deliberate move; the
straightforward plot again reflects old-fashioned screen melodrama dating
back to the silent era.</P>
<P>There is another cinematic spirit von Trier conjures up, and that is of
the classic, cheery Hollywood musical.  References are everywhere--Selma
regularly attends showings of Busby Berkeley tunefests with her best
friend and co-worker Kathy (Deneuve), who often has to verbally describe
the onscreen action to her; Selma and Kathy spend a number of their off
hours rehearsing for a community theater production of
_The_Sound_of_Music_; and, most notably, Selma has elaborate fantasies of
her life as a musical.  These numbers, which are shown in a glorious
mock-Technicolor splendor, starkly contrast with Selma's reality not only
in a visual sense (the shaky hand-held camera work and washed out,
_Breaking_the_Waves_-style hues evaporate in favor of a vibrant faux
Technicolor and quick cuts between what reportedly are up to 100 fixed
digital video cameras) but in an emotional sense--these scenes are all
unbridled joy while the rest of the film bears an unshakable air of
misfortune and misery.  Much has been said about von Trier "reimagining"
musical conventions by marrying high-kicking production numbers with a
grim story, but, again, he's not so much attempting something fresh than
reviving what had been an out-of-fashion aesthetic: that of classical
opera, which invariably is tragedy set to music.</P>
<P>Granted, however, these are non-traditional musical numbers, beginning
with the music itself.  Björk composed all of the songs, and like her
other work they are characterized by a dissonant marriage between
orchestral arrangements and more manufactured sounds--an admittedly
acquired taste for general listening, but a perfect match for this
context; nearly all of Selma's numbers are triggered by a real world
noise, which lingers as a song's backbeat.  That makes just about none of
the songs instantly hummable nor memorable (though the pivotal "I've Seen
It All" leaves a haunting impression); consequently, each appearance of a
musical number--which are all heavily choreographed--is made all the more
jarring and, in certain cases, annoying.  Nonetheless, a strange effect
is achieved; a couple of the interludes don't quite work as you watch
them, but when looked back upon as part of the bigger, completed picture,
a method is revealed to the madness.  Selma's imaginings grow more
outrageous as her situation grows more dire, and it becomes clear that
her dreams are not so much an escape route from her real life than her
only way of actively and effectively living that life.</P>
<P>If, as the comment goes, Björk can't act but only feel, von Trier could
not have made a better choice for his lead.  Selma's story is all about
emotion, and in order for _Dancer_ to succeed, her portrayer must make an
instant connection with the audience.  And that Björk instantly achieves;
Selma may be rather naïve (another point of criticism for the hate-its),
but she is endearingly, honestly so, and one is easily willing to
accompany her on her flights of fancy and stand by her during her many
trials and tribulations.  While von Trier's radical storytelling and
directorial hand are a large factor, the astonishing, unadorned force of
the film's finale would not have been achieved with an "actress" playing
Selma.  Björk simply is Selma--and the film itself.</P>
<P>Given von Trier's reputation as an insincere provocateur, the
impassioned hate-it contingent for _Dancer_in_the_Dark_ is not only
understandable, perhaps it's even correct in pegging the film as a
fraudulent come-on.  _Dancer_ could very well be read as some sick joke,
a cynical jab at an America that invites foreigners to its land with
sunny propaganda (here, movie musicals) only to plop them down in the
diametrically opposing genre--tragic melodrama; or even an experiment in
shameless audience manipulation.  But if von Trier's machinations are
able to wring such a genuine and profound emotional response from the
audience by the final frame (and I speak not only of the overwhelming
sense of loss and devastation it brings the film's admirers but also the
equally fervent anger it incites in its detractors) how can the work
be--as the now-infamous _Daily_Variety_ review of the film put
it--"artistically bankrupt on every level"?  (opens September 23 in New
York)</P>
