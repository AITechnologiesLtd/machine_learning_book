<P>Robert Richardson's familiar light filled cinematography showers scenes of
close up intimacy the way they have in many other films but it is
particularly startling in the case of 'Bringing Out the Dead'.  Set in the
early 90's in New York City, Nicolas Cage stars as a paramedic named Frank
Pierce, a man haunted by the people he couldn't save and has a re-occurring
vision of one particular young woman whom he sees while driving in his
ambulance every time he looks at some of the city's derelicts.  Richardson's
photography echoes the notion of spirituality as those who believe in the
spiritual nature of mankind will connect with the striking camera effects
that give way to believing the soul leaves the body at the moment of death.</P>
<P>Cage's performance as the paramedic is brilliant.  Sort of an up tempo
variation on his performance in 'Leaving Las Vegas'.  In that film from 1995
for which Cage won the Best Actor Oscar, he played an alcoholic L.A. writer
who was determined to move to Las Vegas and drink himself to death within 30
days.  In 'Bringing Out the Dead', Cage looks like he did in the above
mentioned film.  Pale, stressed out with bad hair, bags under his eyes and
an overall structure of a man not in good physical health.  Only this time
the characterization that Cage has brought to the screen is frenzied rather
than sedated.  His colleagues in the paramedic business who travel with him
from time to time are Larry (John Goodman), Marcus (Ving Rhames) and Tom
(Tom Sizemore).  All are men of different personalities.  Larry is the
straight shooter, Marcus envisions himself as sort of an evangelical saviour
of those requiring his services and Tom is the foul and nasty individual who
hates his job and acts like a jerk every step of the way.</P>
<P>Director Martin Scorsese has made a relentless and lacerating film and this
film is vintage Scorsese.  It reaps with scenes of hollow urban destitution
like 'Mean Streets', and 'Taxi Driver'.  When Scorsese is on target with his
visuals, he photographs and cuts his films with mesmerizing accuracy.
Scorsese keeps 'Bringing Out the Dead' from being just another NYC story of
grit and keeps a re-occurring theme elevated for the film's entire running
time.  Frank Pierce (Cage) is seen at the beginning of the film responding
to a call where an elderly man has had a heart attack.  Frank befriends his
daughter (Patricia Arquette) and keeps checking on her father's progress
throughout the course of the film.</P>
<P>The film is also like a big screen version of television's 'ER'.  The
emergency room at the hospital has all the characters you would expect to
find in a big city hospital.  There is the stern security guard wearing
sunglasses who is determined to keep order, the head nurse who questions
people as to why the hospital should help people like drug addicts when they
brought these problems on themselves, the head physician who complains that
there is a constant need for space and the repeat patient who is strapped to
a table on wheels in the hallway, going out of his mind because he can't get
his drug fix.</P>
<P>'Bringing Out the Dead' is anything but conventional film making.  Believe
it or not, from all of the problems its characters face as true examples of
human beings, the film has a surprising sense of humour.  Writer Paul
Schrader, whom I have always disliked in most cases and who made the most
depressing film I've ever seen as both writer and director of 1998's
'Affliction', does an excellent job as author of the 'Bringing Out the Dead'
screenplay.  He constructs the film in a manner that grabs your attention
right away from the opening scene and never lets up.  However, a lot of the
credit for this belongs to Joe Connelly, who wrote the novel on which this
film is based.  The only thing that prevents this movie from being a five
star accomplishment is that it is not an entirely new version of events from
either Scorsese, Cage of Schrader.  As good as the film is, it is the
definition of re-invention.  You can see that all involved are doing a
variation on past work and consequently, it just misses being a great film
but is excellent film making but won't bring Scorsese the long awaited Oscar
he deserves and may some day win.</P>
