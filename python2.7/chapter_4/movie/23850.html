<P>In preparation for his role in "The Skulls," actor Joshua Jackson
researched the real Yale University secret society, the Skull & Bones,
which served as model for the one portrayed in the thriller. He spoke
with Entertainment Weekly Online about the group, whose roster includes
former presidents William H. Taft and George Bush, as well as current
candidate George W. Bush, and their kinky hazing rituals. Reportedly, an
inductee "proves his worth" by getting shot up with Sodium Pentothal
("truth serum"), lying naked with another potential member for a round
of "Liar's Hell" (a prolonged game of "Truth"), and – get this –
masturbating in a coffin. "If George W. becomes president, I won't be
able to look at him without laughing," said Jackson. "I mean, c'mon, he
was wankin' in a coffin at Yale."</P>
<P>With such freaky background material, it would be reasonable to expect
lots of lurid fun from "The Skulls," but instead we get the kind of
dreary, half-hearted crap that the USA Network routinely palms off as
made-for-TV movies.</P>
<P>Jackson, best known as Pacey from "Dawson's Creek," plays Luke McNamara,
a blue collar kid struggling financially to stay in Ya--… well, they
never actually call it Yale, although you can occasionally spot large
"Y's" prominently affixed in the background. Luke's longtime townie pals
now view him as uppity, so he hangs out with two campus buddies;
crusading writer Will (Hill Harper) and plucky potential girlfriend
Chloe (Leslie Bibb).</P>
<P>Soon enough, Luke receives a cryptic invitation from the Skulls. Despite
warnings from Will about the dangers of shadow organizations ("if it's
secret and powerful, it can't be good"), Luke eagerly follows
instructions and gets drugged into unconsciousness, waking up in a
coffin (presumably, he was too groggy to do any wankin') on a
hilariously phony gothic set covered with other coffin-encased wannabe
Skulls.</P>
<P>With spotlights swooping everywhere (the Skulls are real drama queens),
Judge Litten Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson), leader of the group, strides
into the chamber to lay down the law. Each member of the society is
paired with a fellow inductee who will be his "soul mate," offering
emotional support and counsel for life. The Skulls operate from an
exhaustive rule book that covers any possible situation. "Our rules
supersede all others," Litten intones as his soul mate, Senator Ames
Levitt (William Peterson), looks on from the distance. Luke learns that
his soul mate is none other than Litten's pretty boy son, Caleb (Paul
Walker).</P>
<P>Life immediately changes for Luke, as the society deposits thousands in
his bank account, presents him and the other new kids with bright, shiny
sports cars (for a secret society, the Skulls sure are flashy) and hold
grand dinners where dessert is a bevy of glamorous whores.</P>
<P>The party ends when Will turns up dead and Luke uncovers evidence that a
Skull is responsible. The group deems him a threat, leading to the
requisite chases, confrontations, yadda yadda. No cliché is left unused
as the film slogs its way towards a grand finale featuring a good
old-fashioned duel!</P>
<P>Every moment of "The Skulls" is just as idiotic as it sounds. Had the
film explored the concept of secret societies, from the dynamics of the
power structure to the eroticism that lies beneath the rituals and that
"soul mate" business, this could have been interesting. Instead,
director Rob Cohen is satisfied to present a painfully routine movie
that grows sillier with each passing minute. The only mystery in "The
Skulls" is why actors of Craig T. Nelson's caliber agreed to
participate. Surely, the residuals he earns from "Coach" are big enough
that he can afford to pass on garbage like this.</P>
