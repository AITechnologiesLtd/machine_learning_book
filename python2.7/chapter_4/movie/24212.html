<PRE>"What the hell?" </PRE>
<P>That was the first question I asked myself after
seeing American Psycho. </P>
<PRE>"What the hell?" </PRE>
<P>is still my reaction writing this review a few days
later. The ending of American Psycho is so
over-the-top, so unlike the rest of the movie, so
catastrophic, that it just becomes confusing. Neither
me nor the six people I saw it with understood what
the overall message was trying to say. The sloppy
ending disproved any conclusions we came up with.
American Psycho may be fun to watch but its ending
seriously damages all of the characters' introduced
including the protagonist/serial killer Patrick
Bateman (Christian Bale). Surprise endings work
extremely well when the surprise actually makes sense
with the rest of the movie (like Sixth Sense, Fight
Club). On the other hand, they are extremely ruinous
when films use them as an easy way out to end a movie
that is difficult to finish. When American Psycho
ends, it is not over; there are one too many questions
left unanswered. </P>
<P>What was the point of American Psycho? Does Patrick
Bateman represent all of our gruesome fantasies come
true? As a rich Wall Street type living sometime
during the 1980's who acts as a serial killer on his
off time, Bateman gets away with everything he does.
He doesn't just escape the murders unharmed, he also
cheats on his "fiancée" (Reese Witherspoon) with his
friend's fiancée, pays prostitutes, tortures animals,
and snorts cocaine all during an average weekday. This
all coming from the same man who obsessively takes
care of his skin with a series of lotions, who goes
insane when he stains a blanket, and who idolizes the
music of Whitney Houston. Patrick is like no other
character you have seen before thanks to an incredible
performance by former child-star Christian Bale. Bale
saves this movie from being a total disaster with his
ability to make Bateman into a two-faced character who
loves the sight of blood but can't stand seeing it on
his bed sheets. Thank god Leonardo DiCaprio did not
take the title role, he would have been terrible
miscast. The only problem with Bale's magnificent
accomplishment is that he appears in every scene,
meaning he makes every other actor in the movie look
terrible. It felt like director/co-writer Mary Harron
left every other supporting character underdeveloped.
Several excellent actors are all wasted in their
roles. Witherspoon, Willem Dafoe, Samantha Mathis, and
Chloe Sevigny all have potential to be interesting
characters but, due to the terrible ending and
Bateman's dominance, are never given a chance. We
never learn anything about their lives, who they
actually are, what they hide behind their social
appearance. The beauty of Bateman is that he acts one
way in front of society but another, unbelievable to
his friends, way when by himself. And slowly, as the
movie progresses, his "mask of sanity begins to slip."</P>
<P>Besides Bale's performance, there is not much to
recommend about American Psycho. Rumored to be
extremely controversial and unforgettable, the movie
is far from that. The jokes, sometimes hilarious, are
mostly muted by the extreme violence. Maybe the MPAA
ruined the movie…who knows? </P>
<P>What was the point of American Psycho? Was it a
clever, satirical examination of the 1980's? Bret
Easton Ellis' novel, which the movie is based on, may
be just that but I don't see why the film couldn't
have taken place during the 60's, 70's, 90's, or the
2000's. Pop culture has affected society as much in
these periods (if not more) than in the 1980's. </P>
<P>With a decent ending that wrapped up the plot and
expanded the potential of the supporting characters,
American Psycho could have been much more. Bale does
his best to make this movie work but in the end it
just seems like the viewer is being forced to watch a
crazy man kill a bunch of innocent people and get away
with it and nothing else. Overall, American Psycho was
a disappointment.</P>
