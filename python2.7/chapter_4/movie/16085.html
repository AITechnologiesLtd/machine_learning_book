<PRE>F for Fake (1975) 88m</PRE>
<P>Playful documentary by Orson Welles may make your head spin, especially 
the chop-and-switch of the first ten minutes.  Thoroughly hermeneutic 
work is quintessential Welles even more than any of his fictional 
features, showing us Welles the actor, Welles the raconteur, Welles the 
parlor-magician, and Welles the film-maker, who blends his subject (art 
forgery) into the business of film fakery with a devilish sleight of 
hand.</P>
<P>Film's hall-of-mirrors approach has danger of becoming irritating after 
a while, but Welles guides us through its strange events with 
confidence.  Most of it is concerned with art forger Elmyr de Hory, who 
quietly circulated fake 'unknown' works of artists from his home in 
Ibeza.  Once uncovered he became the subject of attention by writer 
Clifford Irving....who then upstaged him by himself becoming the 
perpetrator of a hoax upon producing a fake biography of Howard Hughes.  
Hughes gives a telephone interview stating that he's never heard of 
Irving - but there is no guarantee that it is really Hughes giving the 
interview.  Meanwhile, Hory suspects that Irving has stashed some of his 
forged paintings for future sales; others think that the handwritten 
Hughes documents were forged for Irving by Hory; there is even 
speculation that Hory isn't a real fake, but a fake fake, and that the 
so-called 'forged' artworks are real paintings.  Get the idea?  Welles 
revels in the duplicity of his subject, reminding us time and time again 
that we can't trust the medium of film either (remember, this is the 
individual who pulled off the biggest media hoax in history with his 
famous 'War of the Worlds' broadcast).</P>
<P>Film takes a break from the machinations of its tricky story after an 
hour while Welles talks of the events that led him to Hollywood to make 
CITIZEN KANE (which at first was going to be based not on Randolph 
William Hearst but....Howard Hughes!), then spends the last twenty 
minutes of the film recounting an anecdote about Picasso.  At first it 
seems that this has been included into the documentary because the 
Hory/Irving/Hughes material couldn't be stretched any further - but keep 
watching: Welles isn't through with that idea yet.  It's a delight 
seeing him playing to the camera, sitting at a restaurant with friends, 
laughing while interviewing a gallery owner, studying footage through a 
moviola, and entertaining a youngster with conjuring tricks.  As Welles 
prefers not to discuss his films in interviews it's the closest peek 
into his mind we're likely to get.   </P>
