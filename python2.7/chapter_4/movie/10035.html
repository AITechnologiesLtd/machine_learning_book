THE ICE STORM
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1997 by Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1997) ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Christina Ricci saying, "I'll show you mine if you show me 
yours," _that's_ what more arthouse movies need. THE ICE STORM, 
adapted from the novel by Rick Moody, is a powerful Ang Lee film 
that explores the world of empty bitterness and loneliness of two 
Connecticut families during the sexual revolution of the '70s. As we 
all know, the American colonial war wasn't the only revolution with 
a "shot heard 'round the world." I don't know what that last sentence 
was supposed to mean exactly; just chalk it up to one more vague 
sexual innuendo from the mouth of Andrew.</P>
<P>        Kevin Kline, Mr. Name Above the Title, plays an average 
husband. He's got a wife (Joan Allen), two kids and a lot of tacky, 
big-collared shirts. It's the kind of family that ships the teenage son 
off to boarding school, leaves the teenage daughter at home and 
heads off to some lame party every night, parties where they 
speculate about those wild California "key" parties. That's when the 
men put their car keys in a bowl and the women fish out a random 
set of keys at the end of the night to see which guy they're going 
home with. It beats the hell out of mistletoe, I'll tell you that.</P>
<P>        Kline also happens to be having an affair with the 
neighbor, Sigourney "Zuul" Weaver. But look out, tables are 
turning, Allen eventually gets it on with the husband in his car ("Do 
these seats go back?") and Weaver's son (Elijah Wood) is messing 
around with Kline's daughter (Ricci), the kind of plot twist you'd 
find in an X-rated episode of "The Brady Bunch." At the same time, 
Ricci is drawn to Wood's younger brother, a weird kid who spends 
his time blowing up his model airplanes and hanging his Army 
dolls.</P>
<P>        Meanwhile, there's Kline's son, the only person who 
manages to pursue anyone outside the neighbor's family. Home from 
boarding school for Thanksgiving weekend, he arranges a train trip 
into New York to see a girl from his school. For once, he's trying to 
get to a woman before his best friend does, until he shows up at the 
house and finds the friend already there. This storyline was my 
personal favorite of the movie, as someone who's had that special 
"brother" relationship with a lot of girls I've had crushes on.</P>
<P>        THE ICE STORM takes its precious time to get started, but 
once it does, it turns into one hell of a ride. Its circular, orchestrated 
plot and existential dialogue keep it from being anything raunchy or 
low-brow. In a movie where people of all ages search for meaning in 
sex, drugs and alcohol, nothing is glorified or exaggerated. That is 
the beauty of THE ICE STORM and, having seen it, I can now say 
with all honesty, "I'll show you mine if you show me yours."</P>
