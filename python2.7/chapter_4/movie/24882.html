<P>Retitling of the Italian black comedy/horror Dellamorte Dellamore
(meaning "of Death and Love") and based on the novel by Tiziano Sclavi,
Cemetery Man features Rupert Everett as Francesco Dellamorte, operator
of Buffalora Cemetery.  Whenever someone new is buried in the cemetery,
seven days later they return from the grave, hungry for flesh.
Dellamorte and his mentally handicapped assistant, Gnaghi
(Hadji-Lazaro), must shoot them in the head and rebury them in order to
keep them from doing any harm.  Between replantings, Dellamorte tries to
make his best friend's seemingly perfect life miserable, most of the
younger townspeople taunt him because they think he is impotent, and the
mayor won't listen to his plight involving the graveyard. </P>
<P>When the most incredibly beautiful woman Dellamorte has ever seen (Anna
Falchi) appears at his workplace to mourn the passing of her
substantially older husband, he immediately falls in love.  She rebukes
him at first, but finally warms up to him, and they end up making love
on her dead husband's grave ("I never kept any secrets from him" she
explains when questioned as to why).  Unfortunately for her, it's been
seven days since her husband's passing, and he returns from the grave
taking a large bite out of her arm before Dellamorte manages to ram a
large metal cross through his head.  Dellamorte incorrectly thinks she
is dead, so when she seemingly comes back to life he shoots her, again
incorrectly thinking it has killed her when all it did was graze her. </P>
<P>Dellamorte's life then turns upside down more than it already was.  His
assistant falls in love with still-living severed head of the mayor's
daughter, a busload of dead boy scouts comes back to life (still trying
to rub two sticks together!), and two women who look exactly like his
previous love suddenly enter his life.  Dellamorte snaps and kills the
teenagers who taunted him and three prostitutes.  All of the murders get
blamed on his best friend, who confesses to those crimes and the murder
of his own wife and children because he also snaps under the constant
barrage of pessimism from Dellamorte.  When Dellamorte tries to leave
town to get away from all the madness, what he finds humbles but
doesn't surprise him.  </P>
<P>Cemetery Man is currently available only on videocassette and laserdisc,
neither of which is letterboxed, effectively ruining many of the jokes
and impressive visuals that were seen on the big screen.  Director
Michele Soavi uses the gothic statuary and shadows of the cemetery to
great effect, and some of his wonderful visually striking imagery is
lost in the transfer.  A Japanese import was available letterboxed, but
unfortunately, is no longer in print.  It's a shame a decent letterboxed
copy isn't available, because a movie this great deserves better. 
Unceremoniously dumped into theaters with a poor advertising campaign
that inaccurately reflected the tone of the film, Cemetery Man was
virtually ignored at the box office, then was unceremoniously dumped
onto home video.  </P>
<P>Cemetery Man was shot and dubbed in English (as many Italian films are)
using the original actors, who just post synched every line, so those of
you who don't prefer to read subtitles have nothing to worry about.  I
highly recommend this quirky little film to anyone looking for something
a little different in his or her movie watching experience, especially
if you are tired of the milieu of teen horror romps that Hollywood has
churned out in the wake of Scream.  It's nice to find a well written
horror film that can combine gore, comedy, and human psychology as
deftly as this film does.  Originally presented in 1.85:1 (but good luck
finding a copy of that anywhere). </P>
