<PRE>                                AMISTAD
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Steven Spielberg's account of the
          slave mutiny of 1839 and its legal aftermath is
          certainly a good historical film, filled with facts
          and historical details.  Occasionally it is
          actually powerful.  But it lacks some of the
          emotional impact of THE COLOR PURPLE and
          SCHINDLER'S LIST and its pacing is off. Still, it
          is a useful and engaging source of historical
          perspective.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to
          +4).  A minor potential spoiler follows the main
          review.</PRE>
<P>     In one of those delightful ironies of history the ship was called
La Amistad--Spanish for "friendship" or "friendliness."  In fact, the
ship was anything but friendly.  Its primary cargo was black people
being brought in chains from Cuba to the United States, a country just
sixty-three years old and whose current President, Martin Van Buren
would be the last President to have been born owing allegiance to the
Crown of England.  In this summer of 1839 off the coast of Cuba some
fifty-three slaves chained up in the hold of the ship would break from
their bonds take control of the ship.  Taking command was Sengbe Pieh
whom the Spanish had renamed Cinque (played with surprising power by
Djimon Hounsou).  His plan was to force the crew of the ship to sail
back to Africa, but they tricked him and instead sailed north up the
coast of the United Stated.  An American Navy man-of-war captured La
Amistad off of Long Island, New York.  The ship could have been hauled
to a New York harbor or to Connecticut.  It was taken to New Haven,
Connecticut to increase the salvage value.  New York law said that
nobody could own anyone else and the blacks on board would be
considered passengers.  Connecticut still allowed slavery and the
blacks were legally cargo that could be sold.</P>
<P>     Steven Spielberg's new film tells the story of the legal battle
that followed the ship Amistad arrival and the question of whether the
blacks on board would be slaves or free men.  It was an issue that made
opponents of current President Van Buren (played in the film version by
Nigel Hawthorne--with no small borrowing from his role in THE MADNESS
OF KING GEORGE) and former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony
Hopkins), now a doddering old man and member of the House of
Representatives.  Van Buren, already unpopular due to a recession
resulting from Andrew Jacksons policies, is anxious to placate
Southern voters who could make the difference in the elections the
following year.  Van Buren also wants to placate Spain's eleven-year-
old Queen Isabella II (Anna Paquin) who believes that the slaves are
Spanish property.  Both sides in the controversy are aware that this
could be a powder keg that would lead the country into a civil war over
the issue of slavery.  Coming to the aid of the blacks are two
abolitionists, former slave Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) and a
Mr. Tappen (Stellan Skarsgard).  They bring aboard a real estate lawyer
named Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey).  But Baldwin has his work cut out
for him.  He has no language in common with his clients and does not
even know if they come from Africa or Cuba, an issue pivotal to the
case.  The screenplay for this film is based on the book BLACK MUTINY
by William Owens and is adapted by David H. Franzoni.  The latter's
only previous screen writing was the story for the Whoopi Goldberg
vehicle JUMPIN' JACK FLASH.  It is rumored that for him to make a
script of this quality he needed the help of perhaps the best current
screenwriter, Steven Zaillian of SCHINDLER'S LIST and LOOKING FOR BOBBY
FISCHER.</P>
<P>     One weakness of this film is that apart from a few very powerful
scenes, AMISTAD is very much a cold account of a court case.  Because
the blacks who are on trial are strong and for the most part silent we
get only rare glimpses at emotions we can share with them.  The viewer
is angered that they are being denied justice but gets very little
understanding for the characters.  Their plight is more compelling than
they themselves are.  Cinque is never a fully three-dimensional person,
though we do see a bit of his self-doubt. The only character who is
anywhere near fully developed is Matthew McConaughey's.  We seem to be
seeing a lot of McConaughey these days, but he is not the most emotive
actor.  Anthony Hopkins plays John Quincy Adams as what old age has
left of a once fascinating man, but who now colorful without being
really interesting.  He bores people with his flowers and plays small
practical jokes in the House of Representatives.  When he gives an
eloquent speech it rates about a 7 where 10 is Lincoln at Gettysburg
and 0 is Steven Seagal anywhere.</P>
<P>     Spielberg had a difficult fight wanting to make SCHINDLER'S LIST
(mostly) in black and white.  Here he creates much of the same effect
by subduing the color scheme in the set design and probably also by
photographic filters.  He then makes the only bright colors of the film
the blood during the mutiny.  In this way he can underscore the
violence of his film in a year of so many bloody films.  Be warned that
in that same violent year perhaps the most jarring scene I remember is
AMISTAD's depiction of a man being killed by a sword.  The mutiny, lit
only by lightning, is the first thing we see in AMISTAD but nonetheless
is the centerpiece of the entire film.  Spielberg does have a nice
visual sense that comes out in this scene and elsewhere showing the
blacks in impressive silhouette to make them look larger.  Spielberg
creates some additional tension by letting the viewer from the start of
the film go a long, long time, perhaps fifteen minutes, without any
English in the dialog or on the screen.  That itself becomes a little
wearing.</P>
<P>     Others of the film's touches I question: the mutineers aboard the
Amistad having fashioned for themselves turbans made from what appear
to be American flags.  It is not clear where they would find what would
be three or four American flags on a Spanish ship.  Also the Capitol
building at this point had a ring of pillars at the top and ended
there.  The actual dome was not added until early in Lincoln's second
term.  We see it, however, fully domed.  Just as the Capitol Building
was incomplete, so was the Supreme Court.  There were eight judges, not
nine.  The latter was pointed out by Gore Vidal in an article for THE
NEW YORKER. Van Buren appears a dithering incompetent.  This is perhaps
unfair.  He was merely a second-rate President having to clean up a
mess left by our first second-rate President, Andrew Jackson.</P>
<P>     The Jewish Steven Spielberg has now made two stirring films on
Black History and one on Jewish History. If he can manage to reconcile
tensions between those two communities he will be deserving of more
than Oscars.  I rate AMISTAD an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     Generally when I review a history film I like to look up the
incidents in multiple history books and add information to my review to
broaden the context and correct misimpressions left by the film.  In
this instance my collection of history books have been nearly unanimous
in omitting the Amistad Incident. Even Howard Zinn's A PEOPLE'S HISTORY
OF THE UNITED STATES which concentrates on injustice and minorities
appears to omit the incident.  Of course, any historian writing a
history is forced to choose the incidents he feels willing to cover,
but it is surprising to see this particular incident so ignored and
rescued from obscurity by Black History courses and by Steven
Spielberg.</P>
<PRE>     Spoiler Spoiler Spoiler</PRE>
<P>     Another touch that is wearing: in general the film is deliberately
paced and comes to a conclusion, then the viewer discovers the film
runs its own stop sign and just keeps going.  It was a pleasant
surprise when Spielberg did that in POLTERGEIST, but here it goes just
a bit too long with too little reward.  It needed a more power behind
the speech by Adams.</P>
