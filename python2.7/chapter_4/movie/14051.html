REGENERATION
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     REGENERATION, inspired by some actual events from World War I, 
tells the story of the imprisoned poet, Siegfried Sassoon.  Sas, a 
military officer played by James Wilby from MAURICE and HOWARD'S END, is 
sent to a Scottish hospital when he writes an illegal pamphlet against 
the war.  The authorities figure that, once ensconced in a hospital for 
the shell shocked and insane, his protests will be completely 
discredited.</P>
<P>     Sas, the winner of a medal for bravery at the front, is not your 
typical conscientious objector.  Sas is the type of officer who arranges 
for his men to have tea after any long march.  He is not against all 
wars.  It is just that he thinks this one has become hopeless and is 
being needlessly prolonged.</P>
<P>     As Dr. William Rivers, Sas's sympathetic doctor, Jonathan Pryce 
gives a sincere performance.  Caring for his charges is inducing a sort 
of shell shocked behavior in the doctor as well.</P>
<P>     Stuart Bunce plays Wilfred Owen, who is claimed to have produced 
some of the best poetry to come out of the war.  Sas mentors Owen, who 
is a fellow patient.</P>
<P>     Jonny Lee Miller, as Billy Prior, comes mute to the hospital.  The 
film explains that mutism is an affliction that only struck the upper 
classes during the war.  The lower classes developed completely 
different problems.  Even diseases it seems are class conscious.  Once 
cured of his mutism, Billy goes on to form a romantic entanglement with 
Sarah (Tanya Allen), a local "munitionette."  Their small love story has 
a natural, unforced quality that the rest of the film lacks.</P>
<P>     Although the stories in the film are moving, director Gillies 
MacKinnon (A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE) is never able to weave them into a 
compelling whole.  The battlefield scenes shown in flashback are 
singularly unrealistic looking.  One attack has the men slowly falling 
like toddlers lying down for a nap.</P>
<P>     The movie's visuals can be stunning.  Set in a bleak but sharply 
lit Scottish winter, Glen MacPherson's cinematography will have your 
bones shaking as you admire the beauty of the countryside.</P>
<P>     A few times REGENERATION says something enough out of the ordinary 
to make you think.  Typical of these is Billy's reflection that a battle 
charge is just like sex, "exciting and ridiculous."  Too bad more of the 
movie wasn't as provocative.</P>
<P>     REGENERATION runs 1:53.  It is rated R for war violence and would 
be fine teenagers.</P>
