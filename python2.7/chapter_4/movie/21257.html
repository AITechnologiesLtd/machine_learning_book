<PRE>JOE THE KING</PRE>
<P>If you go to see this movie because you like Val Kilmer or Ethan
Hawke, you're making a mistake. You won't get the typical flamboyance
a la Kilmer, nor the masculine ruggedness you've come to expect from
Hawke. Both actors put on weight and changed their look in order to
portray absolute degenerates in this film, but that old trick doesn't
work for these two. No matter how sloppy, drunk, or flabby these two
get, they can't hide their Hollywood faces--they're just too
pretty. Both are unconvincing, and when the two biggest names fail to
produce, you know you've got a lousy product.</P>
<P>JOE THE KING is the sad story of a young boy trying to cope with his
dysfunctional family in a poor, small town in the 1970s.  Director and
writer Frank Whaley's debut attempts to reveal the loneliness of
adolescence by exposing the heart of a boy made tough by the harsh
circumstances of his miserable family life. Set in upstate New York,
the film follows Joe Henry (Noah Fleiss-JOSH AND S.A.M.) as he deals
with an abusive father (Kilmer) and a hapless mother (Karen
Young). His only salvation is his fifteen-year-old brother, Mike (Max
Ligosh). Together they comfort each other as they deal with each
violent and horrific episode of family crisis.</P>
<P>The weight of the film relies heavily upon the shoulders of young Joe
Henry. Unfortunately the story doesn't allow for his character to
develop because he gets no support from any of the other
characters. His mother has no time, his father is constantly drunk,
his brother hates him throughout most of the film, and his guidance
counselor (Hawke) doesn't seem to care.  So we're stuck with two hours
of one kid's pathetic existence.</P>
<P>The bright spot is that the young cast outshines the adults. Deprived
of food for days, the adolescents survive on a diet of Hohos and
whipped cream. They'll do anything for a buck from stealing to washing
dishes to mopping toilets. Strangely enough, the adults throughout the
town fail to notice how desperate the kids actually are, and their
indifference is disturbing. To their credit, the kids of the small
town are a lot more convincing and resilient in dealing with despair
than their elders.</P>
<P>But no matter what era it takes place in, this film is overdone and
clichéd. If you see it, I recommend some No Doz, otherwise you
might find yourself being awaken by some theater attendant. Or he may
have nodded off as well, who knows.</P>
<P>* one star [lowest rating]
