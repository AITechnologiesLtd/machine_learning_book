<P>     The first thing to notice about John Duigan's LAWN DOGS is the 
astounding performance of newcomer Mischa Barton, who plays Devon, the 
10-year old protagonist.  Barton is a natural actress, and manages to 
convey the perfect blend of maturity and innocence necessary for us to 
accept her character as something more vital than the construct of an 
uneven plot.  Amongst all the weeds of LAWN DOGS, she represents one of 
the few true blades of grass.</P>
<P>     The second thing to recognize is the keenly-realized relationship 
between Devon and a 21 year-old lawn cutter named Trent (Sam Rockwell, 
from BOX OF MOONLIGHT).  Theirs is basically a friendship between 
outsiders, and, although there is an undeniable sexual undercurrent 
inherent in their interaction, it's kept subtle, and Duigan never 
exploits it.  This is no LOLITA; these two have a great deal in common 
on an emotional level, but neither is interested in entering into a 
physical relationship.  In fact, on the one occasion when Trent thinks 
Devon is making a sexual overture, he becomes extremely uncomfortable, 
and she laughs at the foolishness of his presumption.  </P>
<P>     Sadly, Barton's standout performance and the core relationship are 
really the only two worthwhile aspects of LAWN DOGS, a film that never 
quite gels into a satisfying whole.  The problem is twofold.  The plot 
is unwieldy and peppered with familiar, melodramatic moments.  Worse, 
the supporting characters are all pure caricatures.  The plentiful 
attempts at satirizing the suburban lifestyle consistently strike a 
wrong note, often seeming cruel, uncomfortable, or out-of-synch.  Every 
scintilla of thought and creativity evident in LAWN DOGS was lavished 
upon Devon, Trent, and their peculiar relationship.  All other elements 
of the film are disappointingly banal.  </P>
<P>     One of the primary themes evident in LAWN DOGS relates to the 
differences between the "haves" and "have nots" of the world, or, as 
Trent puts it, "people that own lawns and people that mow them."  Trent 
is one of the latter, a college-aged loner who lives in a run-down 
trailer outside of town because he can't afford anything better.  To 
raise a little cash, he transports his mower to the nearby, gated 
community of Camelot Gardens, where, for forty dollars a lawn, he does 
the cutting and trimming necessary for everyone to keep up with the 
Joneses.  The home owners in the lavish, perfectly-manicured development 
tolerate Trent's presence because he serves a necessary function, but, 
when it comes to using their lavatory facilities or socializing with 
their children, he is persona non grata.  And when a theft occurs, he is 
the automatic suspect.</P>
<P>     Devon is the precocious daughter of Morton (Christopher McDonald) 
and Clare (Kathleen Quinlan), two newcomers to Camelot Gardens.  Their 
overriding concern is to earn the approval of their neighbors by 
presenting the facade of a perfect family.  Devon is bored, unhappy, and 
profoundly depressed by her parents' shallow behavior.  Her disdain for 
other kids ("they smell like TV and they talk too fast") prevents her 
from having any friends her own age.  One day, when she's out selling 
cookies for a girlscout-like organization, she meets Trent and senses a 
kindred spirit.  It isn't long before the two of them have become 
unlikely pals, and are doing all sorts of fun things together, like 
stealing and cooking chickens, dancing to a Bruce Springsteen song on 
the roof of Trent's truck, and mooning a couple of startled fishermen. </P>
<P>     Sitting through LAWN DOGS is like watching two entwined movies of 
vastly different quality.  One is a well-written, atypical buddy story.  
The other is an uneven, cliché-riddled look at the inherent schism 
between the outsider and the citizens of the closed, privileged 
community of Camelot Gardens.  The film expends enough effort on the 
latter to mute the impact of the former, and the climactic sequence is 
an exercise in violent, predictable melodrama.  Director John Duigan has 
made a career out of exploring conflicts between mavericks and the 
establishment (see his FLIRTING, SIRENS, and THE JOURNEY OF AUGUST KING 
for prime examples), but this is his weakest feature to date. While 
there are things to appreciate in LAWN DOGS, especially Barton's 
performance, the film as a whole left me strangely unfulfilled.</P>
