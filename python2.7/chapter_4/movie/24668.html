<P>   Israel Horovitz--who co-scripted this movie--is perhaps
better known as a playwright than a filmmaker.  "The Primary
English Class," Horovitz's off-Broadway play starring
Diane Keaton, is set in a classroom where a young teacher is
trying to teach basic English to a group of new citizens, not
one of whom speaks the same language as another.  
Misunderstandings develop, though the tone of the entire play
is a comic one, but one point is made loud and clear.  If
you're going to spend your life in an English-speaking
country, learn the language.  That's one form of assimilation,
probably the most important one.  But just how far should we
go to assimilate into our land of choice if its soil becomes
corrupted by the weeds of wickedly extremist politics?  This is
the principal notion behind the three-hour long epic drama,
"Sunshine," which bears an ironic title notwithstanding the
fact that Sunshine is also the family name of the brood
explored under director Istvan Szabo's cinematic microscope.</P>
<P>   "Sunshine" chronicles several generations of the
Sonnenschein (Sunshine) family beginning nominally in 1840
and running right up to the fall of Communism in Hungary in
1989.  The film is an intelligent portrayal of the struggles of
this family--which came into wealth as a result of a delicious
alcoholic beverage made with a secret recipe and carrying
the family name--against a backdrop of political turmoil in the
Eastern European country.  We observe the tribulations of
the Sonnenscheins through the eyes of Ivan, the great-
grandson of the patriarch Emmanuel Sonnenschein, who built
the family fortune.  Emmanuel (David DeKeyser), a religious
Jew, sits at the head of a table embracing his wife Rose
(Miriam Margolyes), his two philosophically distinct sons
Ignatz (Ralph Fiennes) and Gustave (James Frain), their
passionate first cousin Valerie (Jennifer Ehle), and Gustave's
roving wife Greta (Rachel Weisz).  We are quickly taken to
the turn of the century when, at the stroke of midnight,
Emmanuelle toasts what he proclaims a new era of peace,
justice and toleration.  </P>
<P>   "Sunshine" turns on several pivotal moments in the political
lives of the narrator, Ivan, Ivan's father Adam, and Ivan's
grandfather Ignatz--all of whose roles are played by Ralph
Fiennes.  The first of these is the decision by the Austro-
Hungarian emperor's loyal subject Ignatz to advance his
career as a judge by assimilating further into the mainstream
of his native Hungary.  He changes his name from the
Jewish-sounding Sonnenschein to the more Magyar-ish Sors. 
The second is the determination of the judge's son, Ivan, to
participate as a fencer in the 1936 Berlin Olympics--which
requires him to convert to Roman Catholicism and join the
officers' club.  The third is pondered by Adam's son, Ivan. 
Should he continue as a "fully" Hungarian subject, or should
he reverse the clock and reclaim his heritage as a Jew?  </P>
<P>  "Sunshine" would be an involving if somewhat drier film if
politics were the only issue on the table.  What makes the
picture particularly alluring is the way that director Szabo
merges the political with the personal.  He punctuates the
fevered arguments over marriage that threaten to tear great-
grandfather Emmanuel's family apart.  He shows how Ignatz,
his son Adam, and grandson Ivan need virtually to push
women away with a stick, so readily do they throw
themselves upon the handsome and charming men.  He
exhibits the fit thrown by the family matriarch, Rose, when
her son announces his determination to marry first cousin
Valerie.</P>
<P>   Whether you'll be intrigued more by the political or by the
personal would depend on your inclination.  My own pushed
me in the former direction.  I can understand Ignatz's
willingness to change his name to advance his career as a
judge, particularly because the chief judge, who actively
recruits the talented jurist, explains the requirement with
balanced arguments rather than with any form of anti-Semitic
rant.  I suppose I could empathize with Adam's willingness to
go a step further, to convert to Roman Catholicism, for
without this sell-out he could not have advanced his own
determination to be his country's top fencer.  But in a
shocking scene in a Hungarian concentration camp, Adam
makes a literal life-and-death decision which set my survival
wishes agog.  Adam's choice--the most heroic in the story--is
scarcely believable considering the stakes involved and the
ease with which he could extricate himself from a most
uncomfortable situation.</P>
<P>   Photographer Lajos Koltai takes advantage of several
areas of Hungary, including modern Budapest, to order an
appropriately European ambience. He also enjoys the
advantage of file films, especially those taken from the two
world wars to give the project an authentic feel.  The 38-year-
old Ralph Fiennes effectively shucks off the effete roles with
which he's been associated in movies like "Oscar and
Lucinda" and "The English Patient" to more than match his
most prominent guise--as the evil Nazi commandant in
"Schindler's List."  Portraying three characters with
appropriate changes of hair style and costume, Fiennes
comes across forcefully, convincingly, and in one case with
heartbreaking poignancy as conflicted heirs to a family
fortune whose background as Jews cause them so much
unnecessary and irrational pain.  Rosemary Harris also
shines as the older Valerie, imparting wisdom and kindness
to all with the good fortune to be privy to her thoughtfulness.</P>
<P>   For those in the audience not already aware of this truism,
all totalitarianisms, all blinding intolerance, are faulty, whether
they go by the name Communism, Fascism, Nativism, even
nationalism.  We've toasted in the current century echoing
Emmanuelle's hopeful prediction of a hundred-year period of
peace, justice and toleration.  Will the world, now moving
ever more rapidly toward globalization and cooperation, be
one of largely uninterrupted sunshine?  Or will we fall into the
cynical pattern of the last century, so aptly portrayed through
the perceptive eyes and ears of young Ivan Sonnenschein in
this remarkable, epic film?</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 180 minutes.  (C) 2000
