<PRE>                            YI YI (A ONE AND A TWO)
                        A film review by Jonathan Curiel
                         Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com

<P>     It wasn't fair.  For more than 10 years, Taiwanese director Edward
Yang made movies that were runaway hits in Asia and at festivals around
the world, but the films weren't released commercially in the United
States.  With Yi Yi, that's all changed, and the only question now is,
"What took so long?"</P>
<P>     Nearly everything about Yi Yi is odd and wonderful.  The movie
revolves around a middle-class family in Taipei struggling with everyday
life.  The main character is an uptight businessman named NJ whose
company faces bankruptcy.  His wife is a delicate woman who breaks down
when her mother suffers a stroke.  The family's youngest member, a
precocious 10-year-old boy, is preoccupied with photographing the backs
of people's heads. And the boy's sister is a student musician who falls
for the wrong guy.</P>
<P>        What makes Yi Yi special are its small details and absurd plot twists. 
At his brother-in-law's wedding, NJ (played with understated brilliance
by Wu Nienjen) runs into a former girlfriend, who yells at him for
deserting their relationship 20 years earlier.  NJ wants to reconcile
with his beautiful ex, but she is married, and he is a family man. 
Guilt-ridden and stressed by work, NJ finds refuge in the music of Bob
Dylan and other artists, listening to their songs on headphones while
figuring out what to do next.  After spending one night in a karaoke
bar, he gets the courage to call his old flame (aided by alcohol and the
advice of a wise Japanese game designer) and is soon flying to Tokyo to
get his "second chance" at love.</P>
<P>Yi Yi, which opens with a wedding and ends with a death, isn't for
everyone.  For moviegoers who need Hollywood stars, car chases,
shootings, and dramatic sexual posturing to stir their cinematic pulse,
the movie will seem like a long, boring waste of time.  Can you name
another film that lingers forever on a cloudy sky and the sound of
wind?  And what other recent film outside the oeuvre of Jim Carrey has
used urination as a transition device?  Yi Yi is poetic and crude,
literary and streetwise, serious and funny.  It is an international hit
in the best sense of the term, winning Yang the best director prize at
Cannes and the top honor from the National Society of Film Critics in
New York.  (Yi Yi beat out Traffic for this recent U.S. award.)</P>
<P>Music is a fundamental part of Yi Yi.  For the English translation of
the movie's title, Yang chose A One and a Two as a nod to the saying
uttered by jazz musicians. "(It's) to signify that what's following the
title is not something tense, or heavy or stressful," Yang told an
interviewer.  "Life should be like a jazzy tune."</P>
<P>If I had qualms with Yi Yi, it was with the film's first half-hour, when
so many characters were introduced at such a dizzying pace, it was hard
to keep track of developments and who was with whom.  Schmaltzy opening
music also detracted from the film, but in the big picture, these are
just quibbles.</P>
<P>Yang, whose best-known previous work is A Brighter Summer Day, is 53
years old.  With the critical success of Yi Yi, he has received more
offers to make films in the United States.  Perhaps he'll follow in the
footsteps of Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Taiwan's most
successful director, who has already made the transition from China to
the West.  Yang himself is no stranger to America.  Born in Shanghai and
raised in Taipei, he studied in Los Angeles at USC film school, dropping
out after one semester to work as a computer and systems designer in
Seattle.  Yi Yi is full of references to U.S. culture.  The film's mix
of East and West and its urban setting are two more reasons Yi Yi may
seem relatively familiar to new audiences in North America.</P>
<P>Wherever you live, the film is worth seeking out.</P>
