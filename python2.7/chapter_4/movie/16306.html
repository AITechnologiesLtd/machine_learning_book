<PRE>                           HILARY AND JACKIE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Melodrama and beautiful music mix in
          a story loosely based on the relationship of
          Jacqueline and Hilary Du Pre, two sister musicians
          of very different degrees of success.  Well-worn
          themes of sibling jealousy, the high price of fame
          and success, the comparative rewards of the simple
          life out of the public eye, and family tragedy
          combine in Frank Cottrell Boyce's screenplay, based
          on a novel by Hilary and her brother Piers.  The
          film is entertaining and well-produced but falls
          short of its high reputation.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10),
          high +1 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 9 positive, 0 negative, 4 mixed</PRE>
<P>     From those who would make great music the gods extract a heavy
toll.  How many times have we seen this in film?  We have seen this in
films from A SONG TO REMEMBER to AMADEUS, SHINE, and this season's
HILARY AND JACKIE.  But the latter actually may be closer to a RICH AND
FAMOUS or a BEACHES in plotting.  It give us the lives of two women,
lifelong friends (in this case sisters) and follows one through fame
and fortune and the other through the simple life, concluding at the
end that celebrity is not worth its price.  And it tells this story, as
SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS would say, "with a little bit of sex." If this was
the first film we had ever seen on these themes it would get full
marks.  But there have been surprisingly many similar stories.  The
film is supposed to be the true story of Hilary and cello master
Jacqueline Du Pre, but a heavy set of disclaimers in the closing
credits suggest that it may not be even that.</P>
<P>     The film opens with the two as children with a mother (Celia
Imrie) who endows both with love and a sense of wonder for music.  We
see her transcribing and leaving them by their beds overnight new
melodies for them to discover and excitedly play in the morning.
Hilary is older and more accomplished on the flute. Jacqueline can
barely get a decent melody out of her cello.  Hilary gets attention for
her flute skills, little Jackie feels left out and determines to catch
up with her sister.  So her abilities have to develop at a faster rate
and they continue to do so.  Soon the two are recognized as award-
winning musical prodigies, though now it is Hilary who is jealous of
the attention paid to Jacqueline.  Both girls learned from their mother
the supposed bad habit of putting too much body expression into their
playing.  To them playing is almost a little bit of dance.  Jacqueline
gets a good teacher who is tolerant of the body language.  Hilary's
teacher is an ogre who is intolerant of her having so much fun with her
playing.  The teacher ruins the joy of her playing.  The film splits in
two paths.  First it tells the story of Hilary, the quiet young woman
with a famous sister.  While Jacqueline travels the world with apparent
disdain for her family, Hilary wistfully follows her sister's career.
She meets a man, falls in love, and then has her sister re-enters her
life, a different and disturbed person.  The film then returns to the
splitting and tells the story of Jacqueline Du Pre and why she is so
unhappy with her fame and remains envious of Hilary.</P>
<P>     It has been suggested that this film puts the Du Pre parents and
Jacqueline's husband, Daniel Barenboim, in a bad light.  It is true
that there is something unfavorable about each of them at some point in
the film.  The Du Pre parents are not shown to be perfect, but then
what parents are?  Certainly Mrs. Du Pre is the source of the genius of
her daughters.  Her husband is a bit obtuse at times, but not
destructively.  A little more of the film's criticism is reserved for
Barenboim as Jacqueline's husband, but on balance he seems to be a more
devoted and more reasonable spouse than Jacqueline was.  There is
little that Daniel does to Jacqueline that Jacqueline has not done to
Daniel first.</P>
<P>     Jacqueline Du Pre is played by Emily Watson of BREAKING THE WAVES,
whose two big films have been about sexually disturbed women.  Both
films have allowed her to play women who are confused and a little
opaque.  It is hard to say if this is really good acting or not since
the women she plays are so unusual. There are far more ways to be
something out of the ordinary than to be commonplace.  Rachel Griffiths
as Hilary may have had the more difficult role, having to seem normal
but playing off her strange sister.</P>
<P>     HILARY AND JACKIE is more melodrama than serious drama.  It is not
exactly what would have been expected from the positive reaction this
film has been getting.  But even melodrama can be done well and as such
films go, this is one of the better ones.  Some of the music is
superlative.  I rate it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</P>
