<PRE>_Happiness_ **** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>No other film released this year is likely to cause the storm of
controversy that Todd Solondz's _Happiness_ is most certain to stir.  A
bold, provocative look at some truly miserable lives in American suburbia,
this beyond-black comedy offers some queasily subversive laughs--while at
the same time shocking and, more than likely, offending everyone.  It is a
brave, brilliantly realized piece of work, one that will be debated about
for years to come.</P>
<P>_Happiness_ follows a broad Altman-esque cast of characters, all of whom
are linked somehow, as they attempt to find happiness--or some reasonable
facsimile thereof.  At the core of this canvas are the three Jordan
sisters: Joy (Jane Adams), Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), and Trish (Cynthia
Stevenson), daughters of long-unhappily-marrieds Lenny (Ben Gazzara) and
Mona (Louise Lasser).  Down-on-her-luck Joy, miserable after losing
boyfriend Andy (Jon Lovitz), attempts to find fulfillment teaching at a
school for adult refugees, where she meets Vlad (Jared Harris), a shady but
alluring Russian.  Sophisticated Helen is a successful writer, but she
yearns for raw emotional authenticity, which she attempts to find through a
twisted pas de deux with an obscene phone caller--whom she doesn't know is
her slobby but completely innocuous neighbor Allen (Phillip Seymour
Hoffman), who, in turn, is quietly pursued by his other, far less glam
neighbor, Kristina (Camryn Manheim).  Trish, married with three children,
appears to be the one sister who has her life together.  Little does she
know that she doesn't.  Her shrink husband Bill (Dylan Baker) has a problem
suppressing certain sexual impulses... involving prepubescent boys.</P>
<P>The pedophilia subplot is certain to be _Happiness_'s most controversial,
but not because the issue is taken lightly; in fact, it is the only story
in the film that is _not_ played for laughs.  What makes the topic even
more disturbing to viewers (myself included) is the brutal honesty with
which it is handled.  Bill is certainly a monster, but Solondz and Baker
refuse to let the viewer off the hook, infusing the character with genuine
humanity.  The rub is, Bill knows and admits that he's a monster--it's just
that he cannot control his urges.  His problem culminates in a
heartbreaking and, at the same time, highly upsetting scene where he comes
clean, with blunt frankness, about his actions to his son Billy (Rufus Read).</P>
<P>This gravely serious subplot may seem out of place in a film that is a
comedy (albeit one that is seriously warped), but its inclusion is
justified.  Sick as he is, Bill is the only character who actually finds
"happiness" during the film, freely indulging in his taboo desires.
Everyone else fails to come close, and while their misery can be and often
is laughed at, the pain is real.  The sight of dumpy Allen calling random
women in the phone book in hopes of getting off is funny, but his
loneliness is genuinely sad; the same is the case with Kristina, who is
often shrugged off with a giggle as a pathetic loser.  Joy tries to do her
best to do good, but her often comical failures are failures nonetheless,
much like how Helen's ridiculous desperation, is, in the end, desperation.</P>
<P>Solondz described his film as being about "how people always struggle to
make a connection."  Everyone in _Happiness_ is searching for some type of
connection, but, in fact, they are already connected with everyone
else--through their collective isolation.  The issue, then, is not
connection with others, but connection with themselves.  Bill comes to know
who and what he is, and for one brief moment, he is happy.  By the end of
the film, one wonders if everyone else--or oneself--will ever be able to
follow suit.</P>
