<PRE>                         DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE
                       A film review by Nizam Ahmed
                        Copyright 1995 Nizam Ahmed</PRE>
<P>     When Renny Harlin's DIE HARD 2 hit the big screen several years
ago, it was to universal criticism.  Christmas Eve again?
Single-handedly saving an entire airport again?  Most negative views
centred around the film's huge body count and it's lack of screen
sophistication and subtlety.  But never believe the hype: DIE HARD 2 was
as exciting, action-packed, adrenaline-pumping and fun as the first, if
not more so.  DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE has attracted similar criticism
to it's predecessors.  But history has repeated itself: the film is
Hollywood entertainment at it's best, a roller-coaster ride that is the
most satisfying movie of the summer.</P>
<P>     There are big changes this time round: no Bonnie Bedelia (as
McClane's estranged wife), no enclosed setting, no ventilation shafts.
But there is Samuel Jackson as a Harlem businessman with an acid
tongue, accidentally finding himself running around New York with
McClane at the beck and call of a German mad bomber with explosives
planted in one of NY's 500 schools.</P>
<P>     The whole thing is ridiculous fun, stretching credibility to the
limit with a taxi drive straight through Central Park, surviving a 100
foot drop onto concrete, outrunning a million-gallon torrent of water
in a truck (in reverse).  This is where it suffers in comparison to DIE
HARD and DIE HARD 2.  Even amongst all the mayhem, there was still some
contact with reality there.  Some of the events depicted here are so
over-the-top they're laughable.  The dialogue between Zeus and McClane
is funny at times, though never quite as snappy as it could have been,
and the bad guys are not as mean as in the first two.</P>
<P>     But forget that: this is still suspense, excitement, adventure on
every level.  Lightning has struck yet again.  Watch this and the last
thing you will have is a bad day.</P>
<PRE>OVERALL RATING: 80 %</PRE>
