<PRE>                                SwitchBack</PRE>
<P>The script for SwitchBack was written when Jeb Stuart was in
college, long before he wrote DIEHARD and THE FUGITIVE.   There is
no question about his talent.  Still, the story for SwitchBack
reads like a million others, convoluted and unnecessarily
complicated.</P>
<P>Essentially, it is the story of a serial killer, Bob Goodall,
(Danny Glover) who is being tracked by an FBI man, Frank LaCrosse.
We are never told why Goodall is engaged in his killings, only that
he has killed some 16 people.   Not only has he thrown the police
off his track, he has managed to make them look for someone else.
However, he has not fooled LaCrosse.   When Goodall becomes aware
of that, he kidnaps Lacrosse's  seven-year-old son in the hope that
the father will lay off.  On the contrary, this incites the father
to double his efforts.</P>
<P>Early in the film, Goodall meets up and saves the life of Jared
Leto (Lane Dixon) a medical student dropout who has become a
drifter.  For the rest of the film they hang out together.   The
other interesting character is that of Sheriff Olmstead (R Lee
Ermey) who originally is antagonistic to the FBI stepping in on his
case but eventually becomes an ally.</P>
<P>What value the film has is almost entirely in the spectacularly
beautiful photography of the snow-covered Rocky Mountains with the
train snaking through. That is the magnificent work of Oliver Wood.
In addition, there are some hair-raising fights with both Goodall
and LaCrosse battling it out on some kind of snowplow that swings
perpendicularly away from the train.  Still, the film does not lend
itself to any great acting and so everyone is quite adequate
without particularly having to shine..</P>
