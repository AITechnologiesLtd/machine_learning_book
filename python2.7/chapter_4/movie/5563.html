<PRE>                                 TO DIE FOR
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1995) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I'm sure there was some media case these past few years 
where some beautiful woman seduced a teenage boy and convinced 
him to kill her husband. It sounds like based-on-a-true-story TV 
movie fodder to me and even if I'm mistaken about that, it was still 
a minor subplot in WAYNE'S WORLD 2. But no matter what veteran 
comedy writer and performer Buck Henry's inspiration was in 
scripting this movie (besides, of course, the novel it was based 
on), TO DIE FOR is definitely an entertaining black comedy that 
hovers somewhere between scathing satire and sex-killer thriller 
material.</P>
<P>        Nicole Kidman plays Suzanne Stone, a beautiful woman 
who is prepared to pour all her effort into becoming "the second 
Diane Sawyer" in the TV journalism world. Shortly after meeting 
and marrying a man (Matt Dillon) whose parents are "pillars of the 
Italian-American community" (translation: Mafia), she gets her foot 
in the door at a small public access cable channel, doing midnight 
weather reports before the national anthem comes on, signifying 
the end of the broadcast day.</P>
<P>        By this point we know she really isn't any good at her 
craft, but that's not important. She has an amazing tenacity and 
dedication, from sleeping with TV executives on her honeymoon 
to presenting Wayne "Newman" Knight (the cable station head) 
with a list of impeccable references for a part-time secretarial 
position. She eventually wears down his resistance to where he 
lets her do the weather forecasts and work on a documentary 
chronicling the life and views of three teenage losers.</P>
<P>        Of the losers, one is an insecure, overweight girl who 
idolizes Kidman, another is a juvenile delinquent who was forced 
into participation in the documentary as punishment, and the third 
lusts after her hopelessly (as do we all). Kidman knows exactly 
how to play all three like a fiddle, offering one sex, one money, 
one companionship and all three a future life of luxury with her 
in Hollywood.</P>
<P>        All they have to do in exchange is remove the one obstacle 
standing between her and stardom. That obstacle, naturally, is her 
husband. Kidman's character doesn't have much of a reason to kill 
her husband, who is painted as faithful and dedicated to her success, 
but the ultimate motivation for the murder -- and everything else 
Kidman does -- is her unwavering commitment to success in the 
broadcast field. And the fact that she's nuts.</P>
<P>        The story is told in flashback, mixing in the dramatic 
scenes with footage of Dillon's family on a daytime talk show, 
documentary footage of Kidman telling her own side of the story 
and interviews with the three kids and Dillon's ice skater sister. 
Henry's choice to tell the story of a documentary gone wrong in 
documentary format was a shrewd one. TO DIE FOR, on the whole, 
is an incredibly clever movie. It succeeds as a subtle satire of media 
influence instead of beating us over the head with its message as 
Oliver Stone did in the painful-to-watch NATURAL BORN 
KILLERS.</P>
