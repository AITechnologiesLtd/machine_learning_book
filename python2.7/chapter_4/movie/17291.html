<P>There's a certain taboo about the subject of cannibalism, and even those
most accustomed to eating red meat find thoughts of human flesh as
sustenance most disgusting. And so their ought to be something truly
frightening in Antonia Bird's latest film, RAVENOUS. Instead, the
director of 1994's PRIEST crafts a stylishly goofy film; a film that
manages to stumble through its running time without creating substantial
success or error. Largely, though, RAVENOUS is simply too extreme for
any mainstream audience. </P>
<P>The story even starts out extreme. The audience meets John Boyd (Guy
Pearce), a US Army captain rewarded for bravery in the line of duty but
terribly squeamish. As it turns out, his supposed valor was nothing more
than luck, and as such he's sent to distant Fort Spencer, California,
where he'll be out of the Army's way. Fort Spencer is a prosperous way
station during the summer but a ghost town during the winter, and as
Boyd shows up on the eve of a great snowfall he meets the skeleton crew
assigned to the post during the down months. Headed up by a man named a
cynical nice guy named Hart (Jeffrey Jones), it seems the place is one
of tedium.</P>
<P>Far from it, in fact, as Boyd soon learns after half-dead stranger named
Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle) shows up. Colqhoun explains that he barely
escaped a cannibalistic disaster in the mountains above Fort Spencer,
and when his story is investigated the movie begins its twisted journey
into the nether regions of storytelling. </P>
<P>The story is slim and the acting isn't much better. On the whole, the
story is told in a rather drab fashion and is executed poorly, drawing
no emotion other than a tinge of doubt from the audience. Attempts at
suspense or depth do not work, as when the story tries to play with
Colqhoun's background. His role is immediately obvious to the audience.
Similarly, the process of establishing Boyd's history is muddled, giving
us fragments of his story in seemingly random order; for instance, we
know he dislikes blood (or possibly red meat) but we don't know why. The
only part of the movie that does work is the comic relief, provided by
the soldiers positioned at Fort Spencer. Their tongue in cheek dialogue
goes a long way toward drawing the audience in, and unfortunately it
can't account for other missteps. </P>
<P>The thriller RAVENOUS opens with a quote from Friedrich Nietzsche, and
for the next 100 minutes, that's about as serious as it gets. For all of
the spooky seriousness about cannibalism and rampant hunger, there's
very little in Antonia Bird's film that evokes prolonged consideration
of myth or superstition. Instead, the movie chooses to be something of a
dark comedy (very dark, indeed) and espouses true thrillerism only when
it suits the ends of shock value. There's nothing truly substantial in
RAVENOUS, and this may be a better video rental.</P>
