<PRE>October Sky ***1/2* / ****
Reviewed by Zach McGhee </PRE>
<P>At the core of October Sky, there is the overly convoluted and melodramatic
story, shoved down the throats of its audience, about four high school kids in
a small town trying to win a science fair. Thankfully, the film itself has much
more depth and integrity than can ultimately be described. </P>
<P>The film starts in the late 1950's, just as the Russians launched Sputnik, a
satellite that would orbit the Earth continually. Indeed, the race for the moon
had begun, but it would be a few years before that happened. The mission of the
moment was to gain confidence in the United States once more, that we could
redeem ourselves as the most technologically advanced. The movie, however,
takes an unusual route to do so. </P>
<P>In Coalwood, West Virginia, the town's name has definite meaning. The boys all
grew up to be coal miners, the girls all coal miners' wives. On occasion, one
boy would get a ride out of town on a football scholarship, but such occasions
were few and far between. Too small for the latter category, Homer Hickam (Jake
Gyllenhaal) is less than enthusiastic about his predetermined profession, but
can do little to change his destiny. </P>
<P>Homer's father (Chris Cooper), however, sees no exception in the line-up of
forthcoming coal-miners, and as superintendent of the mine, will see his son
follow him in his footsteps. Regardless of whatever ambitions Homer may have,
they are irrelevant in a world as local as their's. </P>
<P>But, one night, as Sputnik flies over the Coalwood October sky, Homer sees what
the possibilities are. In that instant, Homer's dreams grow beyond capacity. He
wants to know more about space, and satellites, and rockets. In the following
weeks, he searches out the school outcast, Quentin (Chris Owen), in a desperate
desire to learn. With Homer's other two friends (William Lee Scott, Chad
Lindberg), who are a bit reluctant at first, but soon follow Homer's ambition,
they begin. </P>
<P>Cannibalizing Homer's basement, much to his father's dismay, they assemble as
many rockets as possible. However, after suffering a few casualties (i.e. his
mother's white picket-fence), they are forced to find another refuge to
continue the realization of their dream. Soon, the rockets succeed, flying
higher and higher each time. The Rocket Boys, as they came to be known, also
developed quite a cult following, with Homer's father notably absent. </P>
<P>The beauty of October Sky is its ability to maintain an intricate balance
between the many issues it faces. The relationship between Homer and his
family, his father in particular, is one of the most well constructed pieces of
film in years. Typically, film has shown fathers and sons as bitter enemies,
nothing more. In October Sky, their relationship is brought to terms, as both
show obvious resentment, but ultimately love, towards one another. While the
story may be about four boys who make rockets, its heart is to succeed in life,
and realize your dreams. </P>
<P>The film's imagery is visually stunning, not because of a location or fancy
15th century costumes, but because of how real and true it is. The cast is
generally excellent, with Gyllenhaal leading the way to perfection. The script,
coming from the real Homer's novel, is solid in every detail. </P>
<P>While we may have to put up with a few movies like The Avengers or Armageddon,
every once and a while a movie comes along that reminds you why you pay $7
every week or two. October Sky is one of those movies. </P>
<P>[Rated PG for language, brief teen sensuality and alcohol use, and for some
thematic elements.] </P>
