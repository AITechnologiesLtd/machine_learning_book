<PRE>                             THREE SEASONS
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is an American film shot in Ho
          Chi Minh City with a nearly all Vietnamese cast
          looks at various aspects of love, self-image, and
          life in modern Vietnam.  The images are beautifully
          filmed but the story telling is slow and somewhat
          enigmatic at times.  The stories are reminiscent of
          other films. Rating: 6 (0 to 10), +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     THREE SEASONS is an odd melding of Asian film styling with the
story telling of Robert Altman.  Like Altman's SHORT CUTS the film
involves multiple (in this case four) short stories, each developing in
parallel and in close geographical proximity but otherwise mostly
unrelated.  Four plot lines are set in Ho Chi Minh City and begin and
end about the same time.  In one story a cyclo-driver becomes obsessed
with a beautiful prostitute and decides to do whatever it takes to win
her.  (A cyclo is a bicycle modified with a wide passenger seat in
front to be used like a taxi.  One sees them frequently in Southeast
Asia.)  In another plotline a woman comes to the city for a job picking
flowers in a lotus pond and selling them in the city.  She becomes
involved with the recluse who owns the lotus pond.  The third story
involves a street boy who makes his living selling small items like
cigarette lighters from a box.  When his box is stolen he must get it
back again or go hungry.  The fourth plotline involves an American
Vietnam veteran who returns to Ho Chi Minh City driven by conscience to
find his daughter whose mother he abandoned during the war.</P>
<P>     It is very difficult to tell stories of any real plot complexity
in a film that is going to tell four stories in as little as 110
minutes.  If one adds to it that the pacing of this or many Asian
films.  Each of the four stories could probably be told in three or
four sentences.  What is important is not the plot but the texture of
the telling and the feeling for what has become of Saigon after it
became Ho Chi Minh City.  We see a daily life that in some ways is not
that different from what we have in the United States.  The story of
the cyclo-driver and that of the street boy could take place in just
about any big city with few modifications.  The man looking for his
daughter, the least developed of the four stories, might also, but
would be much more likely to occur in Vietnam, with its particular
problem of abandoned mothers.  The story of the lotus pond probably
would not work any place but Asia.</P>
<P>     THREE SEASONS was written and directed by Tony Bui, based on his
own stories. Bui was born in Vietnam, but raised in the US and this
constitutes a return to his parents' land.  It is the first American
independent film shot in Vietnam since the war.  The film stays away
from politics, however, no doubt in part because it had to be passed by
Communist censors and had to play in the United States.  Curiously they
do not seem to object to the film calling the city Saigon rather than
its more politically correct name in Vietnam.  The film plays double
duty as a fiction film and as a documentary look at what Bui saw when
he returned to his country.  Bui has the eye of an artist with much of
the Asian sense of color.  We see this in the cyclo-race that is the
centerpiece of one of the stories and in the sensuous pleasure the
camera takes in the bright red blossoms of a country scene.</P>
<P>     THREE SEASONS--where the title comes from us unclear since it
seemed to me to take place over a much shorter period of time--is what
used to be called a feast for the eyes but remains a simple quiet
little film and not one that says very much.  I rate it a 6 on the 0 to
10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
