<PRE>Congo
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Laura Linney; Dylan Walsh; Ernie Hudson; Tim Curry & Grant Heslov</P>
<P>Congo is based on the Michael Crichton novel of the same name. Laura Linney
plays a scientist whose company has sent an expedition into the Congo to
look for a lost city. While the expedition is in contact with their
employers in the US via a video satellite link, they are attacked. Before
the transmission is cut off, it appears as though the attackers are giant
gorillas.
Linney is told to mount another expedition to find out what happened. Her
character hooks up with another expedition that is also going to the Congo.
This one consists of a scientist who is returning his gorilla, Amy, to the
Congo. Oh yeah, Amy knows sign language and the intrepid scientist has
developed technology that interprets her signs into words. So Amy can speak.
Sound kinda dumb? Well, in the original novel, Crichton pulls it off. The
movie doesn't.
Congo is a disappointment from the get go. Amy, as you might expect, is not
a real gorilla -- and it shows. There are very few scenes in this movie were
you might actually be fooled into thinking this was anything other than a
guy in a bad gorilla suit.</P>
<P>The actors are largely wasted in this movie -- especially Ernie Hudson who
plays the guide, and Tim Curry as the shady treasure hunter along for the
ride. The rest of the cast is almost laughable. It may be as much a fault of
the script as it was of the actors. I suppose if I was an actor, it would be
pretty difficult trying to give my best effort while acting alongside a
talking monkey.  Not to mention the fact that Congo doesn't quite seem to
know if it is an action movie or if it some sort of environmental cause. The
movie seems to instantly switch gears back and fourth from this dangerous
search for the lost city, to some sort of animal rights message that Amy
should be with her own kind in the jungle and not in captivity. Of course
that message is completely forgotten when the killer apes arrive and the
cast starts unloading some heavy firepower into them. I'm not even going to
go into the somewhat schizophrenic killer apes. For most of the movie they
are portrayed as being these highly intelligent creatures, but during the
final climactic scenes of the movie all those brains seem to have gone right
out the window.</P>
<P>Confused? Don't feel bad. So were the filmmakers. The movie isn't a total
disaster; it just could have been so much better considering the source of
the story. Which, in all fairness, is not Crichton's best work. So let's
just say this film is no Jurassic Park. The only high point, and we're not
talking Mount Everest here, is the fact that some of the special effects
weren't half bad. But they weren't good enough to make up for the guy in the
bad monkey suit. My advice? If you are a Michael Crichton fan -- read the
book. Everyone else should stay away from this movie and check out one of
the better Crichton movie adaptations – like Jurassic Park or Rising Sun</P>
