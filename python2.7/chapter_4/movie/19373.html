<PRE>reviewed by Jonathan Hauer</PRE>
<P>Y'ever see a car wreck?  How about one in slow-motion? How about in super
slo-mo?  How about one hundred one minutes of slo-mo car wreck up-close and
personal in all its teeth gnashing, nail scraping, shriek-inducing glory?
Well, if this is what's lacking in your life, please see "Very Bad Things."</P>
<P>The movie details Kyle Fisher's (Jon Favreau) ill-fated bachelor party.  You
see, his wife-to-be is demanding, the planning is a chore, and his only
relief is a night in Vegas with his mean-spirited, low-life, self-righteous
childhood pals.  After quickly tiring of the obligatory gambling and
pro-wrestling pay-per-view, the boys move on to cocaine and a woman of the
night, which one of the man accidentally kills.  This premise is not a bad
one, in my book.  This is not to say that I am condoning either hooker
slaughter or drug abuse, but the fact is that these are dark and titillating
subjects (see car wreck, above) which can propel a movie in the right
direction for an adult audience.</P>
<P>But, alas, these are cheap, contrived situations and Peter Berg leads us
through one hundred one of the most tedious and depressing moments of our
lives, second only to our own true tragedies.  On the positive side, the
acting is pretty good.  I was convinced (with the exception of the
developments involving Christian Slater's character) that these fellas were
being run through hell and back.  I truly felt Kyle was trapped, I felt Adam
(Daniel Stern) was grossand pathetic and I felt like Michael (Jeremy Piven)
was an irresponsible, hot-headed jerk.  However, gross manipulation does not
a movie make.  In this respect, I was reminded of last year's "Return to
Paradise,"  another long, slow car wreck of a movie, which showed us the
most pathetic and heart-rending of stories, but that's all it showed.</P>
<P>The tone of "Very Bad Things" felt awfully inappropriate at times.  At the
beginning I was impressed that the film decided to defy its previews and
take the much more serious tone of a darker film rather than a dark comedy.
But, then, as if to confuse, each act was concluded with an entirely
contradictory happy, jazzy tune...way to kill the mood, guys.  It's like
they were trying to say, "hey, we were just kidding about all that horrible
stuff," but without the actual humor to back it up.  Add to that a very bad
sense of timing -- how many days took place between the bachelor's party and
the wedding? -- and you've got yourself a stinker of a movie.</P>
<P>I found myself wondering why I had enjoyed other dark movies (Fargo, A
Simple Plan) to a great degree, but not this one.  What was the difference?
The difference for "Very Bad Things" was an uneven tone, a lack of any human
sympathy for anyone in the film, and a story that was entirely too
predictable.  It could've been better, the audience can see the potential,
Peter Berg's direction was very interesting at times, but that just made it
all the more frustrating.</P>
