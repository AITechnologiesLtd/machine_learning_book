<P>     After being rendered a paraplegic following a freak New York City
automobile accident, soap opera star May-Alice (Mary McDonnell) retreats
to the house in Louisiana which she inherited from her parents.  There,
she is cared for by nurses who come and go with revolving door
regularity, driven away by May-Alice's bitterness--until the arrival of
Chantelle (Alfre Woodard), that is.  Desperately needing a job and
pursued by her own personal crises, Chantelle has no choice but to stick
it out.</P>
<P>     PASSION FISH will win no awards for originality.  It embodies some
of the oldest storytelling motifs around:  the growth of a relationship
between two mismatched people and the valiant fight of someone to
conquer a disability.  In a way, the movie is a little like DRIVING MISS
DAISY, with a healthy dose of THE WATERDANCE thrown in.</P>
<P>     In its portrayal of paraplegics and the struggles they have to
endure adjusting to their disabilities, PASSION FISH is inferior to THE
WATERDANCE.  In his 1992 film, Neal Jimenez may have given a definitive
portrayal of how a once-normal person comes to grips with the sudden
loss of mobility.  PASSION FISH does a good job telegraphing May-Alice's
pain, but the presentation isn't as powerful.</P>
<P>     This isn't the most accomplished "buddy film" of recent memory,
either, but it is one of the rare few featuring women, and possesses all
the candor and openness of a FRIED GREEN TOMATOES.  Sayles' strength has
always been characters and, in PASSION FISH, he manages to create a pair
of vibrant, complex ones.</P>
<P>     The film starts in the middle of the story, and, as it progresses,
we are treated to revelations of both future and past.  There are no
flashbacks.  Everything that we learn about what was comes through
dialogue--a snippet here, a snippet there.  As is the case when we meet
someone in real life, we aren't made aware of everything at one time.</P>
<P>     The relationship between the two main characters is at times too
strained to attain the level of emotional honesty that the movie
expects.  Nevertheless, perhaps that's one of the elements that
differentiates PASSION FISH from the legion of other films in its genre.
Also, the May-Alice's abrasive temperament could have been toned down
without detracting much from the movie.  While the experience of
becoming a paraplegic admittedly gives a person the right to be bitter,
there are times when this trait threatens to transform May-Alice into a
stock character.</P>
<P>     Because John Sayles is a great writer and director, and because his
two leads are more-than-capable in their roles, PASSION FISH overcomes
its many shortcomings to provide a clear look at an unusual
relationship.  While there isn't much life to the supporting characters,
May-Alice and Chantelle are intriguing enough to keep the audience
involved.</P>
<P>     There was a 1992 film called SOAPDISH that took over ninety minutes
in a mostly-unsuccessful attempt to lampoon daytime television.  As
almost a throw-away element of PASSION FISH, John Sayles manages a more
humorous and incisive satire in this movie.  Few elements of soap operas
are spared a dig.</P>
<P>     The bayous of Louisiana provide a rich backdrop to the film.  None
of the cinematography is epic in nature, but there's something about the
wetlands, with their alligators and snakes, that captures the attention.
It's also interesting to note how well Mary McDonnell allows May-Alice's
accent to slowly reassert itself.</P>
<P>     PASSION FISH, primarily because it is so deeply character-driven,
is short on action, but heavy on drama.  This is a film for those who
love to watch real-seeming people struggle through
different-but-unspectacular lives.  It's a small movie, about small
changes in attitude and understanding, and it knows when to be serious
and when to laugh.</P>
