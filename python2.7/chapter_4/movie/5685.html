                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1996 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 - C:William H. Macy.</PRE>
<P>The content of a film has never made me angry. I have never seen a film
where one of the character's actions were so frustrating that I just wanted
to reach into the film and beat them. The story involves a college professor
(Macy) who tries to help one of the girls in his class understand what he's
teaching. Keep in mind that throughout the film the teacher does absolutely
nothing wrong.The student returns later and accuses the professor of sexual
harassment. Even though the professor explains to her that he was only
helping her to understand, she says it's not his intentions that are the
issue, it's how she interprets his actions. That's like if you are driving
along and way off in the distance there's a car behind you. You then drive
into a ditch because you think the car will catch up with you and crash into
you. So, as a result, you sue the driver because you thought he would damage
your car, even though the driver never even came remotely close to you.</P>
<P>This female character is clearly insane and if there are people like her who
think how she thinks, then society as we know it will surely crumble. The
film is well acted by Macy and not at all well acted by the psychotic
student. The dialog seems forced, however, and for the first thirty minutes
or so, the two characters have a conversation that would take normal people
thirty seconds to have. Written and directed by David Mamet.</P>
