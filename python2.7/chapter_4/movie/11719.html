<PRE>Reviewed by Doug Skiles</PRE>
<P>What SUPERMAN II (1980) is to SUPERMAN (1978), so is BATMAN RETURNS
(1992) to BATMAN (1989).</P>
<P>What does that mean?  That means it's a worthy, well-done sequel.  What
is it with these DC Comics heroes having two good entries in their film
series and then going downhill?</P>
<P>This time, the plot might actually need some commentary.  We see before
the eerie credits sequence that, 33 years ago, a boy was born deformed,
and, repulsed by his appearance, the parents (one of which is played by
Paul Reubens, a Tim Burton film veteran) tossed him into the sewer (or a
storm drain - hard to tell) and he floats his way to the "Arctic World"
attraction at Gotham's zoo.  There, it's implied that he's found among
the penguins and is put into the "Red Triangle Circus", where he becomes
the "aquatic bird boy."  The circus keeps him alive, but eventually he
returns to life under the streets.  All of this primarily occurs
off-screen, before the main focus of the story takes place, as we have
other matters to deal with... </P>
<P>In the modern day, millionaire deparment store owner Max Shreck is
trying to build a new power plant, despite the fact that Gotham City
already has a power surplus.  Why?  Well, because his power plant is
actually a capacitor, which will suck power in and store it.  But he's
not telling the mayor (Michael Murphy) or Bruce Wayne, who are both
opposed to his plan, that.</P>
<P>Of course, Max also has a secretary named Selina Kyle.  Selina strikes
up a romance with Bruce Wayne, but, as you already know, she won't end
up being Selina Kyle for the whole movie, and you can find out why and
how when you watch for yourself.</P>
<P>Michael Keaton now seems even more comfortable in the Wayne/Batman role,
and plays it better than ever.  He even looks better in the suit here
(incidentally, this is obviously the most flexible suit that any Batman
wears in any of the films, and it looks quite cool).  Keaton is still
the definitive Batman, here more than ever - he's even made his hair
look less '80s for this film.  It's too bad that the story doesn't focus
more on him.</P>
<P>DeVito plays a very good tormented, umbrella-wielding Penguin, a man who
wants to return to the world above and "reclaim his birthright" by
becoming an appreciated member of Gotham society - all while secretly
plotting his own destruction schemes and revenge plots with his former
circus buddies who are now his gang.  He even gets to be funny at times.</P>
<P>Pheiffer is an excellent Catwoman, the first foe who is a worth physical
adversary to Batman in the series.  She's sultry, she's fun to watch,
and always chews the scenery.</P>
<P>And speaking of the scenery, it is, again, a beautiful thing to see. 
fills in for the late Anton Furst, and, although he doesn't reach the
same level as Furst, he does an admirable job.  Gotham is again a
beautiful and dark world.</P>
<P>Oh, yeah... Christopher Walken?  He's Walken.  He's pretty much always
Walken.  He's always a pretty good villian, because, hey, he's
Christopher Walken.  He can't compete with the Penguin or Catwoman, but
hey, what did you expect?</P>
<P>Danny Elfman's main theme returns here, and it, along with the other
music he did for this film, is much more haunting and dark this time
around, with chanting often rising up from the background.  This score
is again beautiful, and is just as strong as the one Elfman wrote for
the first film.</P>
<P>If the plot for this movie sounds odd... well, I suppose it is a little
weird, but Tim Burton films are usually quirky.  Still, somehow it all
seems to make sense on the screen, and works just great when you see it
for yourself.  Another Batman triumph for Burton and Keaton, BATMAN
RETURNS has all the strong performances, cool action, great direction,
gorgeous design, and powerful music of the first film.  The only flaws
would be that, this being our second trip through Gotham, maybe we
aren't as dazzled as the last time (sort of like the problem THE LOST
WORLD: JURASSIC PARK [1997] had to deal with after the origina JURASSIC
PARK [1993]), and we could've made do with more time spent with Batman,
and perhaps less villians.  With the next film, however, BATMAN FOREVER
(1995), Joel Schumacher's reign begins, and things get even more
crowded... so be prepared.  </P>
