<PRE>DIE HARD 2 (1990)</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Bruce Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, William Atherton and

Directed By Renny Harlin</PRE>
<PRE>Review By David Wilcock
(C)1998 David Wilcock</PRE>
<P>After the incredible sucess of Die Hard (1988) it would seem
obvious that a sequel would be on the way. However, this film
breaks the golden rule of sequels, which is that the sequel must be
worse than the oringinal, by actually being better. It's bigger, it's
more fun, and generally this is a much better film.</P>
<P>The films starts with John McClane (Willis) in Dulles Airport
waiting for his wifes (Bedelia) flight. However, the airport is soon
under the grip of the deranged Colonel Stewart, played evilly by
Sadler, who are waiting to pick up a drugs baron who is being
flown into the country (the drugs lord is played by Franco Nero)
Of course, it's up to Willis, and not the police (the cheif of police is
played by Dennis Franz, star of NYPD Blue) to save the day.</P>
<P>The film then follows the Die Hard genre closely, by delivering big
explosions, a few deaths, and the usual Willis one liners. The
director, Renny Harlin, who's only previous film was Nightmare
On Elm Street 4, directs very well, and Willis gives a good
performance. The best performance has to go to Dennis Franz,
who's police is very good. Sadly, William Atherton, who played
the news reporter in Die Hard, is wasted here, and serves no
purpose in the film at all. William Sadler, though, is terrific as the
Colonel. Although nowhere near as outlandish as Alan Rickman in
Die Hard, he plays Colonel Stewart with superb menace.</P>
<P>But, of course, no-one watches an action film for the
performances, they watch it for thrills, spills and destruction. And
here, Die Hard 2 really delivers. The airport setting gives chances
of luggage hold shoot outs, an ambush on a skywalk, and of
course planes blowing up, and Die Hard 2 gives us two planes
exploding, both with massive explosions. Die Hard 2 also features
one of the most incredible scenes in action movie history, by
showing Willis eject out of a plane, while the plane explodes below
him. It really is an incredible sight, one of the best explosions put
on film.</P>
<P>Fun though Die Hard 2 is, the plot is incredibly stupid (much like
any action film) The audience are supposed to believe that the
terrorists can build practically a airport tower in a church, which
could never really happen. There some other things that happen in
the film that are ridiculous aswell, such as the police taking so long
to act on this terrorist threat. The script is just about average (in
action film standards), with some in jokes for Die Hard fans, but
it's not the cleverest script in the world. </P>
<P>But despite the plot flaws and weak script, Die Hard 2 proves to
be a great popcorn film, and even better than Die Hard, partly due
to the fact that it's got a far more sensible running time (just under
2 hours, unlike Die Hards 2 hours 30 minutes) An excellent action
movie</P>
<PRE>OVERALL= ***1/2 out of *****</PRE>
