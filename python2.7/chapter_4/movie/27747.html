<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Jennifer Lopez is Mary Fiore, she's the workaholic wedding planner,
someone who hasn't had a date in six years. The Wedding Planner is a
romantic comedy cut from the cloth of the Hollywood studio zany comedies
of the '50s. It reminded me most of "The Father of the Bride," only it
didn't have Spencer Tracy's assurances that everything would turn out
OK, as the film looked real good for the first 70 minutes and then slid
into tedium and then into a contrived ending ala "The Graduate."</P>
<P>The refreshing zaniness is there in the opening scenes when Mary gets
her Gucci shoe stuck in a sewer hole in the streets of San Francisco and
a hunk by the name of Steve Edison (McConaughey) rescues her from being
crushed by a runaway dumpster. She looks at him and he looks at her, and
it's love at first sight.</P>
<P>He turns out to be a pediatrician, and when Mary's assistant, with the
rolling eyes and high sqeaky voice, the loopy Penny (Judy Greer), senses
romantic sparks in the air seeing the two together, she arranges a date
for them in Golden Gate Park. This is an amazing park, because besides
having an amusement ride and an outdoor dance floor, it screens movies
and on their two visits to the park they watch rarely seen Hollywood
musicals: Two Tickets to Broadway (1951, with Janet Leigh, Tony Martin,
and Gloria De Haven) and Flirtation Walk (1934, with Dick Powell and
Ruby Keeler).</P>
<P>On the dance floor, only a rain storm stops them from kissing.</P>
<P>Mary has talked her conniving boss Geri (Kathy Najimy) into giving her a
partnership if she can snag the account of the soon-to-be bride, Fran
Donolly (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras). Her family is extremely wealthy,
having made a fortune in the high-tech business and are willing to spend
a small fortune on the wedding. Mary has worked her way into being one
of the best planner's in the business due to her diligence in planning
the perfect wedding. But the surprise that comes her way, after happily
landing this big account, is learning that Steve is the sexy guy Fran is
going to wed.</P>
<P>The film comes armed with an inane subplot, that wasn't particularly
funny or believable, as Mary's very heavily accented, doting, Italian
immigrant, widowed dad, Salvatore (Alex Rocco), foists Mary's childhood
playmate, Massimo (Justin Chambers), on her and lets it be known that
they are engaged. Massimo is a manipulative clod, with a penchant for
saying and doing the wrong thing, and is someone she never liked, even
though he's not bad looking.</P>
<P>Upon the introduction of Massimo into the story, the film loses its
energy. For someone who is billed as a control freak such as Mary is,
there is no way she would not have put a damper on the relationship
instantly. But since she doesn't and the chilly Fran shows only
friendship for Steve and no love -- we are forewarned of what will
happen to their intended wedding plans. Only, first-time director Adam
Shankman builds the tension up to ridiculous proportions, by having both
couples getting married to the wrong person at the same time -- Fran's
in the park, Mary's in city hall.  But there should be no surprise how
everything is resolved.</P>
<P>It's a modestly successful romantic comedy, much like those
old-fashioned fluff films of yesterday. It's ready made for an audience
that applauds when two people who are meant for each other, wind up with
each other no matter what. Hollywood loves churning out stories like
that because they're good box office and have mass appeal. This is one
of those films, and if that's your poison, be my guest, you won't be
disappointed by this one. The two stars are glamorous, with Jennifer and
Matthew throwing some PG-13 heat onto the screen. The film's big joke is
when Jennifer is told she has a big neck, an obvious reference
to Jay Leno's running gag about her big derriére.</P>
