<P>If you've been thinking about vacationing on one of Greece's Ionian Islands
and you have a lot of time to kill, head down to your local megaplex and
check out Captain Corelli's Mandolin.  Pretty much everybody else should
just stay away.  With its crystal-clear blue water and bone-white sandy
beaches, Mandolin is essentially a really (really) long commercial for the
Greek Tourism Commission.</P>
<P>As if we haven't already had our fill of wartime romances this summer,
Mandolin tries awfully hard to be The English Patient but instead is only
slightly less ridiculously annoying than Pearl Harbor (with fewer
explosions, to boot).  It's about a Greek woman who falls in love with one
of the Italian soldiers occupying her picturesque island during World War
II, which would be kind of like Anne Frank hooking up with Colonel Klink.
Like Patient, it's based on a hip novel (Louis de Bernières' 1994 novel had
a different ending and oodles of homosexual overtones) that you've probably
never heard of before, but Patient it is definitely not.</P>
<P>Mandolin was doomed from the get-go, with original director Roger Michell
(Notting Hill) dropping out after suffering a heart attack just months
before shooting was supposed to start (personally, I think he was faking).
He was replaced by John Madden (Shakespeare in Love), but then one of the
worst casting blunders of all-time occurred when Nicolas Cage was tapped to
play the Italian soldier and Penélope Cruz accepted the role of his Greek
beauty (because all olive-skinned people look alike, right?).</P>
<P>Why can't more filmmakers do like Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi and cast
films with actual people native to the region in which the film is set?
With Mandolin, we get Cage (The Family Man), whose Captain Antonio Corelli
is the only member of his battalion to speak Greek.  When he translates,
he's an American guy who is playing an Italian speaking Greek, but it's
really English.  Makes about as much sense as my long-distance phone bill.</P>
<P>About a half-hour before I saw this film, some entertainment show was
crowing about Cage spending months to master an Italian accent, as well as
learning how to both play the mandolin and conduct an opera.  They made it
seem like he was working on a cure for cancer, and the fact is, his accent
is horrible.  Cage, who has very little experience in period romances,
sounds like Dracula (he always looks like him anyway, to me), and if it
weren't for Shannon Elizabeth in American Pie 2, he'd win the Worst Accent
of the Month Award.</P>
<P>Cruz (Blow) is no better, as her Pelagia is performed by a Spaniard
stumbling over the English language while not even bothering to try to sound
the slightest bit Greek (but all Mediterranean people sound the same,
right?).  Pelagia has spent her whole life on the island of Cephallonia
(which, I think, is the name of the brain tumor you get from using a cell
phone), learning how to practice medicine from her father, Iannis (John
Hurt, Lost Souls).  She gets engaged to a simple fisherman named Mandras
(played by a simple actor named Christian Bale, Shaft), but before you know
it, those damn Italians are amassing at the Greek border on Mussolini's
orders.</P>
<P>Shortly after Mandras heads off to join the Greek partisans, Cephallonia
surrenders to the Italians (after a funny initial response) and the island
becomes "occupied" by a dozen soldiers, led by the mandolin-toting Corelli.
Iannis, who looks an awful lot like Stalin, is forced to put Corelli up in
his house, much to the dismay of Pelagia.  But we learn Corelli is more into
dancing, singing, drinking and swimming than any type of war activity.  He'd
sooner shout "Heil Puccini" than "Heil Hitler," and he tries to acclimate
himself with all of Cephallonia's locals (called Cellephants, perhaps).</P>
<P>Even the blind can see where this story is going.  Pelagia hates Corelli at
first, but she starts to fall for him at the one-hour mark, and they're
playing tonsil hockey about 15 minutes later.  Then, the all-important
unveiling of the Penélopes occurs.  But what will happen when the tides turn
in the War?  How will Italy's surrender affect the island?  Will the
soulless Germans try to occupy Cephallonia?  And, more importantly, will we
get to see the Penélopes again?</P>
<P>If you can stay awake, you'll learn the answers to these important questions
and more at Captain Corelli's Mandolin, playing at a theatre near you.  Just
don't say I didn't warn you.</P>
