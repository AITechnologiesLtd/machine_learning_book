<P>Trigger Happy (1996) 93m.  Originally released as MAD DOG TIME</P>
<P>Love it or loathe it, writer-producer-director Larry Bishop's debut
outing is destined for cult heaven.  In summary, story sounds like a
run-of-the-mill mob flick:  Gangland boss Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is
returning to his nightclub after being released from incarceration. 
Other would-be mob bosses (Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Gregory
Hines, to name a few) wonder how to use this situation to their best
advantage.  They don't wonder too hard - everyone's solution to
problems in this scenario is simply to shoot everyone else dead, which
is exactly what transpires, in one measured showdown after another,
until the film's conclusion.  </P>
<P>The lack of compunction or consequence resulting from this gunplay
pushes TRIGGER HAPPY well beyond the fringe of reality, but that's
understandable:  Vic is being released not from a prison, but an
asylum - this story may be taking place entirely within his head. 
That's one plausible reason, at least, for the over-tanned
blemish-free makeup smothering all the characters (Dreyfuss himself is
positively pancaked with the stuff) - the inhabitants of Vic's world
are as neat and tidy as the precise, bloodless killings within it. 
Then there's the opening narration about the entrance of a new
universe, the references to the Big Bang theory and Vic's
conversations with God, and the extreme closeup of Vic's eye in the
final frames.  Vic, as demented creator of an equally demented world,
is ubiquitous throughout the story: other characters talk about him
constantly whenever he is absent from a scene.  In fact, Dreyfuss
doesn't put in an appearance until considerable buildup has elapsed. 
It's an interesting effect, because despite our warnings that Vic is
totally insane, Dreyfuss never actually does anything crazy (no
crazier than his contemporaries, anyway).  He needs do nothing more
than stare benignly and let our imaginations wonder how psychotic he
really is. There's almost one moment of revelation during Gabriel
Byrne's awful rendition of Vic's signature tune ‘My Way' (What else,
for a Creator?), surely the most memorable cinematic representation of
that standard since Sid Vicious mangled it in SID AND NANCY.  It's an
interesting moment because we can't be sure if Byrne is snarling
remarks like `You're a paranoid schizophrenic' between the lyrics or
whether we are finally seeing/hearing evidence of Vic's delusional
psychosis.</P>
<P>The contribution of Byrne, who speaks in an unfathomable accent, is
the most comic of the film.  He makes a great foil for Vic's hired gun
Jeff Goldblum (my favorite performance among his credits so far),
whose wry, schoolboyish looks suggest he is concealing some sly prank.
 He, Dreyfuss, and Byrne form the crown of a cast list that is
irresistible, including the likes of Ellen Barkin, Diane Lane, Billy
Idol, Rob Reiner, and Paul Anka.  Rat Packers Sinatra, Martin, and
Davis dominate the soundtrack.  The original title, MAD DOG TIME was
meant to be an anagram of MAD GOD TIME, highlighting Bishop's
intention that his film be seen as an allegory.  </P>
