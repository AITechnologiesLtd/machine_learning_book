<PRE>Rating: Near Miss  (2 out of 4 stars)</PRE>
<P>The story of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet has become so iconic that
the story crosses many cultural boundaries. It's a fine framework on
which to build a story about rival gangs, eastern vs. western morality
and forbidden love. The problem with Romeo Must Die is just as the
writer and director start building their clockwork beast, they suddenly
stop to admire their work without fleshing it out. It's a creation
whose heart pulses to the beat of slick marketing: the world of music
video meets Shakespeare. It's an unsteady creation.</P>
<P>The film teeters along a path in which it tries to be an action film
while haltingly being an examination of societal boundaries within the
code of honor amongst thieves. The story centers on two crime families.
One is Asian American. One is African-American. The Asian family is
headed by actor Henry O., whose son, Han Sing (Li), a former police
officer,  is in a Hong Kong prison for an unspecified crime involving
his father. In archetypical Hong Kong cinema fashion, the brutal death
of Han's brother brings him to America, seeking answers and revenge.
The other family is helmed by Isaak O'Day (Lindo), whose daughter and
ersatz Juliet, Trish (Aaliyah), wants nothing to do with the family
business. Both men are attempting to acquire oceanfront property in a
bid to acquire land for a shady developer looking to build an NFL
stadium for an Oakland expansion team. Whichever family is able to land
the deal will be able to emerge from the shadows of crime into the
world of legitimate businessmen.</P>
<P>Kapner and Bartkowiak try too hard to force the disparate themes
together. They've culled one of the basic tenets of Hong Kong cinema: a
family member being killed and the hero's ensuing search for justice.
Rather than the death being affecting, it feels perfunctory. Added to
the mix is a distractingly loud urban soundtrack that is a too obvious
grab for teenage viewers. (Especially when a song sung by Aaliyah was
being played as she was on the screen.) Layered on top of that is the
inert "romance" between Trish and Han. Though the pair are intimated as
having romantic feelings towards each other, there is nary a kiss or
profession of love between them. Perhaps this is a concession to a
perceived unmarketability of interracial romance, especially when both
parties are minorities? The script lightly touches on the notion of
race in America, but with such a feathery touch so as to be almost
unnoticeable. Interspersed throughout the film are fight scenes
involving Li. These are done to Li's disadvantage.</P>
<P>There are some unique situations for Li to present his on-screen
fighting skills. The first being a Houdini-like escape in which he must
overcome six prison guards as he is dangling in the air by one foot and
handcuffed. It could have been a memorable scene, however, the camera
flashes through the action so quickly that the confrontation becomes a
blur of colors and noises, rather than a mano-a-mano between men. Other
battles are ingeniously set up with Li using props such as a fire hose,
a belt and other items. Each scene is compromised by spastic editing
that doesn't allow full appreciation of the powerful, yet precise
fighting style of Li. During the fights, one can sense the marketing
gurus at work. Punches land and bones are broken, but it's done in a
bloodless and oddly politically correct manner. One innovation involves
showing an x-ray of an opponent as his bone, spine, etc, is broken.</P>
<P>Given the overreach of the material, several performers manage to carry
the film  on sheer charisma. Aaliyah acquits herself nicely, even being
given a crying scene that feels forced and too obvious a showcase for
her range. There is promise in her. Li has some moments where he
effectively and silently conveys a range of emotions, yet other times
he merely occupies the screen. There are snippets of the presence that
made him a star in Hong Kong, but this vehicle doesn't allow that
persona to fully surface. The always sturdy Lindo gives much needed
heft to the proceedings. Wong and Washington both radiate a handsome,
leading man glow that dims as they are gradually reduced to mustache
twirling villains. Maybe if Romeo must Die had sets its sights a tad
lower and gained some focus in the process, it might have been a better
showcase for Li and Aaliyah. As it stands, both partially cut through
the confused fog to show two emerging Hollywood lights. It's said that
a man's reach should exceed his grasp, but in this case, the filmmakers
went a bit too far and muddied things by taking on too much.</P>
