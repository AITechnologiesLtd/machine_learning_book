<PRE>A TIME FOR DRUNKEN HORSES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>In Bahman Ghobadi's A TIME FOR DRUNKEN HORSES (ZAMANI BARAYÉ MASTI 
ASBHA), two poor kids, Ayoub (Ayoub Ahmadi) and Ameneh (Amaneh 
Ekhtiar-dini), care for their older, 17-year-old brother Madi (Madi 
Ekhtiar-dini), who is a sad looking dwarf.  They need to find money for 
Madi's life-saving operation and get him across the border into Iraq 
where the operation will be performed.  Although this might sound 
dramatic, which it is briefly in a tear-jerking ending, most of the 
movie is a hardscrabble, slice-of-life story in which nothing much 
happens other than slogging through deep snow.  </P>
<P>Living the life of smugglers, the children are part of the homeless 
Kurdish minority in Iran, Iraq and Turkey.  Their plight is made clear 
by the story.  The ragamuffins work a life straight out of Dickens as 
they just barely scrape by in jobs helping the smugglers.  Large, 
tractor-sized tires are apparently one of the most popular items on the 
black market, and one mule can carry two tires -- just barely.  The 
film's name comes from the spiking of the horses' water as a way to help 
them cope with the intense cold.  (This is a picture that does appear to 
violate the strict American rules against actual violence against 
animals during the filming of a motion picture.  The horses are clearly 
beaten and kicked in the head when they get too drunk to walk.)</P>
<P>Among the film's most memorable moments are the sounds of rolling 
thunder rippling across the mountain tops as the Kurdish smugglers try 
to avoid another ambush.  What you are left with when you leave the 
theater are a few nice images but little more.  </P>
<P>A TIME FOR DRUNKEN HORSES runs 1:17.  The film is in Kurdish and Farsi 
with English subtitles.  It is not rated but might be PG-13 for mature 
themes and animal violence and would be acceptable for kids around 10 
and up.</P>
