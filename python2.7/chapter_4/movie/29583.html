<P>Don't Say a Word sounds a lot better on paper than it ends up being on the
big screen.  It's a psychological thriller based on a novel - a good start -
and features performances from the usually reliable Michael Douglas and
stars-in-the-making Brittany Murphy and Sean Bean, the latter of whom will
appear in the upcoming Lord of the Rings trilogy.</P>
<P>But Word is merely a predictable, by-the-numbers action flick with a little
psychobabble thrown in to the mix.  In fact, the only shocking thing about
the film is the fact it was one of three set to open on September 28 that
feature prominent shots of the World Trade Center (the others are
Serendipity, which will remove the potentially offending images; and
Sidewalks of New York, which also stars Murphy and has been pushed back to a
November release).</P>
<P>Word begins ten years ago with a group of five expert thieves knocking off a
Manhattan bank to get their mitts on a $10 million ruby (for some reason,
they pass up various other riches).  The gang, led by Patrick Koster (Bean,
Ronin), leaves in two cars and, as they get away, realize they've been the
victims of the old switcheroo.  Before we learn more, Word brings us into
the present day, where Dr. Nathan Conrad (Douglas, One Night at McCool's) is
heading home from his upscale psychiatry practice to spend the Thanksgiving
holiday with his wife Aggie (Famke Janssen, X-Men) and eight-year-old
daughter Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak, The Patriot).</P>
<P>Before he reaches his luxurious Central Park West home, however, Nathan
receives a call from Dr. Jerald Sachs (Oliver Platt, Ready to Rumble), an
old colleague who needs his help with a new patient at a dingy nuthouse on
the other side of town.  Figuring it will only postpone his arrival home by
an hour or two, Nathan meets Jerald and his patient, a spooky 18-year-old
named Elisabeth Burrows (Murphy, Summer Catch) who has been in 20 different
institutions and had just as many different diagnoses.  It seems that
Elisabeth witnessed her father being hit by a subway when she was eight and
hasn't been the same sense.</P>
<P>Long story short, Nathan wakes up the next morning to find his daughter has
been kidnapped, and her captors say he has until 5:00 that evening to pry a
mysterious six-digit code from Elisabeth's crazy noggin.  Hmmm.let me get my
abacus.  Elisabeth is 18 and her dad was killed when she was eight.  That's
ten years ago.  I wonder if her dad had something to do with the ruby
robbery?  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to stay at least one step ahead
of Word at any point.  It becomes clear fairly early on that Nathan will
both save his daughter and cure Elisabeth like some kind of psychiatric
superhero.  The only unanswered question is whether Word's final shot will
show Elisabeth eating Thanksgiving dinner with Nathan's family or not.</P>
<P>The best aspects of Word come from the most unexpected places.  Nathan's
wife Aggie has a broken leg and is in traction, confined to her bed for the
entire film while she's being watched by the bad guys' hidden video cameras
(it's like a reverse Rear Window).  And the badly underdeveloped
relationship between little Jessie and her kidnapper has a lot of potential,
as the girl seems to grow on the gruff, tattooed gangster (it's like a
reverse Stockholm Syndrome).  And Amir Mokri's (Coyote Ugly) cinematography
is, at times, quite captivating, especially in the gritty flashback scenes
and prologue that make New York City look like Sarajevo.</P>
<P>Instead, director Gary Fleder (Kiss the Girls) and screenwriters Patrick
Smith Kelly (A Perfect Murder) and Anthony Peckham, adapting from Andrew
Klavan's novel, insist on including a completely worthless subplot involving
a homicide detective (Jennifer Esposito, Dracula 2000) who may be the
toughest female law enforcement agent since J.Lo in Out of Sight.  Still,
her character does nothing but take up time, making Word about 20 minutes
longer than it needs to be.</P>
<P>1:52 - R for violence, including some gruesome images, and language</P>
