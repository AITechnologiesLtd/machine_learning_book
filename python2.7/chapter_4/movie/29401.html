<P>ROCK STAR (2001) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Mark Wahlberg, Jennifer Aniston,
Jason Flemying, Timothy Olyphant, Timothy Spall, Dominic West, Jeff Pilson and
Jason Bonham. Written by John Stockwell. Directed by Stephen Herek. Rated R. 
 Rock Star is a heavy metal fairy tale that despite striking some discordant
notes is overall enjoyable and likable. </P>
<P> Inspired by the true story of a singer in a tribute band who gets his chance to
join and front a famous rock group, Rock Star features Mark Wahlberg as Chris
Cole, lead singer for Blood Pollution, a Steel Dragon tribute band. Chris
idolizes Steel Dragon's lead singer, Bobby Beers, and knows everything about the
band, its history and members. For Chris, fronting Steel Dragon would be a dream
come true. </P>
<P> After being thrown out of Blood Pollution, Chris receives a phone call that
will fulfill his fantasy. Next thing he knows he and his girlfriend, Emily
(Jennifer Aniston), have been jetted to L.A. After a brief audition, Chris is
rechristened Izzy and is soon becoming the idol of millions. </P>
<P> Set in the mid-1980s, this rags-to-riches story has much to offer. Even if you
don't like heavy metal music, you will find Rock Star an entertaining outing
because while the music does play a major role in the proceedings, the story is
more about Chris's/Izzy's introduction into the perks and pitfalls of stardom.</P>
<P> Chris begins his new life filled with wide-eyed innocence and enthusiasm. After
all, he is now the embodiment, the cipher of those millions of anonymous youths
who pay to see him perform and imagine themselves in his tight-leather pants. </P>
<P> As time passes, though, Chris learns the responsibilities of stardom are more
than just wailing to an enthusiastic audience. The grueling pace of the road,
the groupies, drugs, publicity shoots and all that the role encumbers soon
begins to wear on the young man. </P>
<P> Despite growing jaded, Chris/Izzy never loses his passion for the music. It is
only when Kirk (Dominic West), Steel Dragon's lead guitarist and spokesman,
rejects Chris's song ideas that the young singer understands his limited role
within the organization. Kirk explains to him that the band holds a specific
niche in the music world and any deviation would destroy that toehold. </P>
<P> John Stockwell's script is surprisingly low on cynicism, which is refreshing
considering all the fodder this particular territory could have afforded. And
while the script does cast a jaundiced eye at the practices and machinations of
the music industry, it is neither preachy nor judgmental. </P>
<P> Wahlberg offers a sincere, hard-working performance as Chris/Izzy. His
transformation from obsessive fan to naive innocent to disillusionment is
gradual and painful. Wahlberg does his own vocals, which were electronically
enhanced, but that should not detract from his first-rate effort. </P>
<P> Aniston's role is a bit underwritten as the loyal girlfriend watching the
corruption of her man, but unable to stem the tide. </P>
<P> A small, but memorable bit of acting is offered by Timothy Spall as Mats, Steel
Dragon's longtime road manager, who counsels Chris on the wild lifestyle of rock
stardom. </P>
<P> One of the film's best moments revolves around the confrontation between Bobby
Beers (Jason Flemyng) and his former bandmates, which echo an earlier scene
between Chris and his former group members. </P>
<P> Flemyng's short scene is touching and painful as he tells Chris of the
realities and responsibilities of being a member of a top rock group. </P>
<P> One of the funnier moments is a parking lot confrontation between two Steel
Dragon tribute bands, which leads to a war of words, costume critique and near
fisticuffs. </P>
<P> Helping the enterprise is the casting of members of various heavy metal bands
in pivotal roles. They include Zakk Wylde, lead guitarist for Black Label
Society and Dokken guitarist Jeff Pilson. </P>
<P> If Rock Star, ably directed by Stephen Herek (Mr. Holland's Opus, 101
Dalmatians) has a drawback, it is it's anti-climatic ending. </P>
<P> Rock Star is a fast and loud fable, filled with colorful characters and
ear-shattering music. It's a somewhat cautionary tale about wishes coming true
and about how those desires may not measure up to expectations. </P>
