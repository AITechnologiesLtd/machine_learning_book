<PRE>                                  MORTAL KOMBAT
                              "Kicks are for Kids"
                             A film review by Bill
                  @1995 and Bill don't need no stinkin copyright.</PRE>
<P>Rating: 2.5/4  (Not nearly as bad as STREETFIGHTER.)</P>
<P>Preview:
     Saw the one hour making of/preview on cable, turns out they shot
on location in Thailand.  The guy who plays Liu Kang is in/famous for
many movies in Hong Kong, and he also helped choreograph a bunch of the
fighting.</P>
<P>     The guy who plays badass Shang Tsung is REALLY REALLY famous,
you'll recognize him easily.</P>
<P>     The documentary was interesting, and the walkthroughs of the sets
were nice--they put a *lot* of detail into 'em, and then you see'm for
30 seconds of the movie.</P>
<PRE>The Movie</PRE>
<P>     Christopher Lambert (McCloud from Highlander) plays RAIDEN.</P>
<PRE>     The special moves for sub-zero were really cool! (no pun
intended.)</PRE>
<PRE>     Scorpion's fatality was good!</PRE>
<PRE>     They got Johnny Cage's speed/blur kick just right!</PRE>
<PRE>     Sonya was okay (what do you expect for a chick?)</PRE>
<P>     Goro was entirely computer generated as every four armed badass
should be, but he wasn't utilized to his full potential.</P>
<P>     The plot kinda dragged, they went out of their way to explain WHY
there is this tournament, and WHY everyone has to kick/punch the shit
out of each other, but who cares right?  Get on with the fighting
already!</P>
<P>     And when it comes time to fight, some of these guys get wasted too
quick....</P>
<P>     I'd seen STREETFIGHTER the movie (rental) and was so thoroughly
dissapointed, but after seeing the previews, I knew this one couldn't
suck *that* bad....</P>
<P>     I guess it helped to be surrounded by a hundred kids yelling
"DAMN!", "Kick his ass! Yeah!" and "FINISH HIM!"</P>
<P>     To its credit, it kept a fairly quick pace, and the *music* really
punched it along!  Check out the soundtrack!</P>
<P>     Go see it *soon*, while the theatre will be full of screaming kids
and they'll have the soundtrack turned up to max and you should enjoy
it.</P>
<PRE>                            later,
                                        Bill</PRE>
