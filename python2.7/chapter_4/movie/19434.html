<PRE>Lost Highway (R) **
Starring Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette
Directed by David Lynch
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Lost Highway, the most recent Lynch opus makes it's way into theaters just two
months after Scream, which markets itself as a scary movie. Compared to this,
it's Care Bear fare. </P>
<P>Saxaphone player Fred Madison (Pullman) and wife Renee (Arquette) start
receiving videotapes of their house, and of them sleeping in bed. They are set
on the front porch, unmarked, showing more every night. This continues until
they receive a video showing Fred killing his wife, who has mysteriously
disappeared. Fred is put in jail, and much to the guard's surprise the next
morning, someone else has replaced him in his cell. </P>
<P>Mechanic Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty) is his replacement, and we get to see
the story of him, how he makes a new friend in mob boss (Robert Loggia) who not
only is linked to a guy that makes porn movies (starring Marilyn Manson in a
cameo.) He introduces him to Alice (Arquette again) who strangely looks like
Renee. </P>
<P>Sound like a soap opera? Not really...the chilling aspect is eyebrowless Robert
Blake (who sort of has this white clown makeup on) who tells Fred that he is at
his house while he is talking to him at a party. Also, the use of silence is
wonderful and had me jumping even when the TV turned on or the phone rang.</P>
<P>The video features a preview for a video all about David Lynch, and it's my
guess that some of the bizarre strangeness of this movie could find explanation
there. But until we find the key to open Lynch-world this is just a weird
violence-high film noir.</P>

<P>ADDITIONAL NOTE: I have been hearing rumors of a rerelease in February of 2000,
if this is true, I highly advise you to go see this film in theater for an even
more chilling experience. </P>
