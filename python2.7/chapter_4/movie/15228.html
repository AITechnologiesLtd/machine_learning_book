THE PRINCE OF EGYPT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>When casting the key part of the voice of Moses, most people's first
candidate would probably not be the controversial actor Val Kilmer (THE
SAINT and THE ISLAND OF DR.  MOREAU), but he was Dreamworks's choice in
their first traditionally animated movie, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT.</P>
<P>The selection of Kilmer proved to be a wise one, but the biggest risk
Dreamworks took wasn't in the casting department.  The radical departure
was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical
epic, a la Cecil B. DeMille, to move our hearts and minds rather than to
tickle our funny bones.</P>
<P>In the press kit producer Penney Cox says that they wanted to make a
film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not
exclude children.  Animated movies for adults that are appropriate for
kids and that are not comedies, now that is something fresh.</P>
<P>Let me admit up-front that I was quite skeptical as to whether
Dreamworks could pull it off.  Dreamworks's ANTZ seemed to be a movie
not quite appropriate for any age group.  THE PRINCE OF EGYPT may be
harder to market than ANTZ, but it is much more satisfying.</P>
<P>Like ANTZ and unlike the more modest casting of Pixar's A BUG'S LIFE,
THE PRINCE OF EGPYT has half of Hollywood doing the voices.  Danny
Glover is the voice of Jethro, Jeff Goldblum of Aaron, Steve Martin of
Hotep, Helen Mirren of the Queen, Michelle Pfeiffer of Tzipporah, Martin
Short of Huy and Patrick Stewart of Seti.  You can figure out for
yourself who does the voice of God.</P>
<P>The movie, which is weakest in the story department, is a Cliff's Notes
version of DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.  The script by Kelly Asbury
and Lorna Cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic
event in Moses's life.  DeMille took over three and a half hours in
order to do it justice.  At less than half of that, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT
rushes through so much material that it doesn't establish sufficient
depth for us to bond with the characters.</P>
<P>We meet Moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket.
We watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to
Ramses (Ralph Fiennes), the future Pharaoh.  Moses is a free spirit and
a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a Jew.  ("All
I've ever known to be true is a lie," Moses complains.)  After finding
out his real identity, he sees for the first time the oppression of the
Jewish slaves that are all around him.</P>
<P>After leaving Egypt, Moses comes back to ask Ramses to let Moses's
people go.  This leads to the classic scene of the parting of the Red
Sea, which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance
the traditionally hand-drawn animation of the most of the production.</P>
<P>It is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling.
Drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses, blues and golds, the
picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last.</P>
<P>The construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust, and other
scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun.  The most original visual
sequence in the film occurs during a dream Moses has.  Done with an
explicit two-dimensional look, the colorful images painted on the temple
walls come to life to tell their own animated story.</P>
<P>Even though it has its weaknesses, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT is a noble
attempt to carve out a new genre -- serious animated movies for adults
that are acceptable for the entire family.  This awe-inspiring movie
deserves to be seen.</P>
<P>THE PRINCE OF EGYPT runs about 1:30.  It is rated PG for thematic
elements and would be fine for the whole family.  How old a kid would
need to be to be interested depends on the child, but those over 8 will
probably like it.</P>
