                        Copyright 1997 Vince Deehan</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by Steve Buscemi. Cast :  Steve Buscemi, Chloe Sevigny,
Anthony LaPaglia, Elizabeth Bracco, Mark Boone Junior,  Seymour Cassel, 
Carol Kane, Bronson Dudley.
UK Release Date: Feb 14 1997.</P>
<P>TREES LOUNGE is the entertaining directorial debut from one of the most 
enjoyable actors around, Steve Buscemi.  Whether he is playing the bellboy 
Chet ( "Chet!") from BARTON FINK or the hitman in THINGS TO DO IN 
DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD, Busecmi is always a joy to watch.
He commands attention whenever he's on the screen and  I have never 
seen him  give a bad performance yet.  He has worked with a huge array of 
talented directors including the Coen Brothers, Robert Altman, Jim Jarmusch and 
Quentin Tarantino and I am delighted to say that he has shown with this film 
that he has plenty of directorial talent himself.</P>
<P>In TREES LOUNGE Buscemi plays the lead role of Tommy, a 30-something car 
mechanic who has been fired  for "borrowing" (as Tommy puts it) 
money from his boss and neglecting to return it.  His boss Rob  (Anthony 
LaPaglia) is now married to Tommy's ex-girlfriend Theresa  (Elizabeth Bracco) 
who is now pregnant with a child who may or may not be Tommy's.  Tommy spends
most days standing outside his former workplace which irritates Rob greatly.  
Rob stole Theresa from Tommy which perhaps explains why Tommy is keen to 
irritate Rob !</P>
<P>Spending time standing outside Rob's garage is, however, merely a pleasant 
diversion for Tommy's main preoccupation which is propping up the counter in 
his favourite bar Trees Lounge, named presumably because of the 
single, sad looking tree which sits just outside.  The bar itself is not 
particularly attractive and would be unlikely to attract any passing trade. 
It would appear to be only used by a select few regulars who , like Tommy, 
spend many hours there each day drinking their lives away and generally 
feeling sorry for themselves.  </P>
<P>We see Tommy walking the streets in search of work as a mechanic.  He gives 
the impression that he couldn't care less whether he got work or not.  He knows 
full well that his old boss Rob would not be able to provide him with a 
glowing reference but he nonetheless  tries to get work.  When Tommy's Uncle Al 
(Seymour Cassel)  has a heart attack and dies at the wheel of his ice cream 
van, he is offered the chance to take over the job, which he does.  Tommy knows
that he is hardly suited to the job but he gives it a shot.  While on the 
round Debbie (Chloe Sevigny), the seventeen year old niece of his ex-girlfriend,
joins him one day and they strike up a friendship which soon leads to a 
romance.  Needless to say, when Debbie's father Jerry (Daniel Baldwin) finds 
out, he is none too pleased.</P>
<P>We also meet another regular of the bar, called Mike (Mark Boone Junior).  
Mike owns a removals firm but is having marital problems and has taken to 
spending his current vacation  sitting in the bar all day drinking, and taking 
drugs in the bathroom.</P>
<P>In TREES LOUNGE Steve Buscemi treats all the characters with obvious 
affection despite their shortcomings.  The character of Mike is particularly 
interesting since he obviously has a lot going for him: his own company, his 
own house and a wife and child; but despite this he prefers to retreat from 
his responsibilities and wallow in self-pity in the  bar all day.  We don't  
really get to understand Mike's actions nor any of the other characters, but 
this isn't really a fault.  I don't think Steve Buscemi set out to create a 
deep character study but rather he has created a lot of characters whose 
behaviour we have to take at face value.   Why, for instance, does the old man 
at the bar, Bill, spend his entire day  (or so it seems) drinking , before 
been carried paralytic into his small bedsit above the bar.  What has happened 
in his life that has gotten him into this state ?  We don't get to find out.  
We just have to imagine it for ourselves. </P>
<P>The acting from the whole cast (including brief cameos by Samuel L. Jackson 
and Mimi Rogers) is of a high standard throughout. Buscemi 
himself is  as wonderful as ever, but special mention should go to Chloe 
Sevigny (KIDS) who handles the potentially tricky role as the teenage Debbie 
with ample style and grace.  She never comes across as precocious for one 
minute which would be the pitfall for a less talented young actress.  </P>
<P>TREES LOUNGE is a wonderful directorial debut from one of America's most 
likeable and interesting character actors and I hope that we will see more 
from him.</P>
