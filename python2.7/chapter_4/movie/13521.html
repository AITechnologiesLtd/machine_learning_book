<P>METEOR THREAT SET TO BLOW AWAY ALL VOLCANOES & TWISTERS!</P>
<P>Summer is here again! This season could probably be the most ambitious =
season this decade with Hollywood churning out films like DEEP IMPACT, =
GODZILLA, THE X-FILES, ARMAGEDDON, THE TRUMAN SHOW, all of which has but =
one main aim, to rock the box office. Leading the pack this summer is =
DEEP IMPACT, one of the first few film releases from the =
Spielberg-Katzenberg-Geffen's Dreamworks production company. Following =
the rather dismal showing of their previous two releases; MOUSEHUNT and =
AMISTAD, DEEP IMPACT shines with elements which could just make it one =
of the biggest movies of the year.</P>
<P>DEEP IMPACT begins with the discovery of an Earth bound comet during a =
school astronomy outing by Leo Beiderman (Elijah Wood) which =
subsequently stirred up the political community of the world. Keeping =
the information under wraps to prevent widespread panic, President Beck =
(Morgan Freeman) took it upon himself and his subordinates to execute a =
highly secretive space project to destroy the comet before it hits =
earth. While pursuing a sex-scandal story amongst the presidential =
ranks, ambitious up and coming reporter, Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) =
unfolds the wool that President Beck has pulled over the citizens of the =
world. As if the knowledge of the imminent annihilation of mankind is =
not enough, Jenny has to come to terms with her father (Maximillian =
Schell) leaving the mother for a younger woman.=20</P>
<P>President Beck announces the discovery and preparations to destroy the =
comet exactly one-year later, with so much confidence that it left no =
trace of panic within the American community. Achieving fame from =
announcement of the comet Wolf-Beiderman en-route to Earth (the name of =
its discoverers), Leo Beiderman continues life in his small town as a =
young celebrity. A team of astronauts, led by the ageing veteran =
astronaut Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall), was secretly trained to carry =
out the mission to land on the comet and create and explosion with a =
nuclear device, with the hope of blowing it out of its current path =
towards Earth. Despite him being the most experienced in the team, the =
younger generation of astronauts in the team doubts Tanner's ability due =
to his age. But these are just problems of individuals. Life on Earth =
goes on as any other day, confident that the comet will be destroyed.</P>
<P>When the attempt to avert Wolf-Beiderman's path failed and caused the =
comet to split into two: Comet Wolf and Comet Beiderman, the President =
unfolds his contingency plan to evacuate part of the population, leaving =
the rest to die. Citizens are randomly chosen to live underground for 2 =
years prior to impact, when the dust due to the impact around earth have =
settled, by then all life on the surface would have died. Jenny and Leo =
were picked but many of their loved ones were not, only a handful of =
Earth's population will be saved from destruction. =20</P>
<P>DEEP IMPACT's moving moments occur in the least special-effect laced =
scenes. While the effects are fantastic, they only form a small part of =
the film, which indulges itself in the development of its main =
characters; Leo, Lerner and Tanner. Leo's struggle when he learns that =
his girlfriend is not part of the population to be saved, Lerner's =
dwindling relationship with her father and her pain for the mother's =
loneliness, Tanner's strive to gain the respect he deserves from his =
crew and his ultimate sacrifice, all form the backbone of DEEP IMPACT's =
moving moments. DEEP IMPACT smells suspiciously like the previous year =
release CONTACT despite vivid differences. I think its probably because =
they both delve in a story of global proportions and indulges in the =
premise of hope, faith and life itself. Both do not depend heavily on =
eye-candy in the form of CGI effects.  Director Mimi Leder (who won =
numerous awards directing television series, and made her debut with =
PEACEKEEPER last year) is definitely a director to watch.=20</P>
<P>Despite this being the first of the two meteor movies this summer (the =
other being ARMAGEDDON), I think there will be stark differences in the =
approach to the subject matter. While the premise of both may be the =
same, execution and focus of the films will in fact show that DEEP =
IMPACT has more focus on human elements than ARMAGEDDON, which is done =
by the team which brought us BAD BOYS, CRIMSON TIDE and THE ROCK. =20</P>
<P>DEEP IMPACT should be able to satisfy a variety of audiences; from the =
most action-craving to those who just want to immerse into its =
manipulative but nonetheless dramatic premise.</P>
