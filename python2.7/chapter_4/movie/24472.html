<P>         Too bad Hollywood can't just find a way to clone Jim Carrey.
That would save the rest of us from the long line of Carrey wannabes
who've tried to get their own piece of the action.</P>
<P>  The latest pretender to Carrey's porcelain throne is Harland
Williams, who seems to fancy himself as a cross between Pee Wee Herman
and a geekier John Cusack, and the best that can be said about his
performance in ``RocketMan'' is that it's not consistently irritating,
just frequently irritating. With a better vehicle, who knows? He might
end up being just occasionally irritating.</P>
<P>  ``RocketMan'' could prove to be a real side-splitter for
little boys under the age of 12 or for their bigger brothers, provided
they have a blood-alcohol level of .12.</P>
<P>  No doubt the screenwriters used their best crayons to
scribble down this yarn about a doofus computer programmer named Fred
Randall (Williams) who, through a remarkably flimsy and inane set of
circumstances, winds up being picked to join an expedition heading to
Mars. The rest of the crew includes skeptical veteran astronaut Bill
Overbeck (William Sadler) and a chimpanzee named Ulysses who seems to
be onboard solely to complicate Fred's life and to react to his
oh-so-zany shenanigans, which include hanging his boxer shorts in
place of the American flag on the surface of Mars and coercing
everyone on Earth to join him in singing ``He's Got The Whole World In
His Hands.''</P>
<P>  Actually, Fred seems to burst into song quite regularly and
never quite tunefully. When he's not warbling a tune, you can rest
assured he's making a mess of the mission, accidentally serving
hemorrhoid cream for dinner and literally bouncing off the walls when
he's locked out of his ``hypersleep chamber.'' He also passes gas into
Bill's spacesuit in a scene that climaxes - like many of Fred's
foul-ups - with the lovable nerd squealing ``It wasn't me!''</P>
<PRE>  Oh that Fred: He's such a card, you just want to deck him.</PRE>
<P>  To be fair, there are a few bright bits in ``RocketMan,''
scattered through the story like a handful of diamonds at the garbage
dump. And the movie gains a wee bit of an edge for having the audacity
to cast Sadler as something other than a psychopathic killer. More
often than not the jokes fall flat, but director Stuart Gilland at
least manages to keep the film moving along.</P>
<P>  With this past summer's Mars mania, this would seem an
opportune time for another movie revolving around the space
program. But in the end, the only thing ``RocketMan'' has in common
with ``Contact'' is that they're both in color.</P>
