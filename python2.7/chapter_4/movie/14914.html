<P>BRIDE OF CHUCKY **1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers' Id (<A HREF="mailto:wchamber@netcom.ca">wchamber@netcom.ca</A>)</P>

<P>Revoke my critic's license; sentence me to a public hanging. Both
suitable punishments for what I'm about to write: BRIDE OF CHUCKY is a
fun, fun movie. Whether it's any good is another issue altogether, but
like another of this year's sequels-that-nobody-asked-for, Halloween:
H20 Twenty Years Later, BRIDE OF CHUCKY is bearable and even enjoyable.</P>
<P>Tilly stars as Meg (though not billed separately, Tilly's breasts steal
her every scene), ex-lover to Charles Lee Ray, the serial killer whose
soul inhabits "Chucky" the Good Guy doll. For three movies now, Chucky
has terrorized unsuspecting white folk. In this fourth Child's Play, Meg
steals a mangled Chucky from a police impound (which houses, among other
horror memorabilia, Jason's mask and Leatherface's chainsaw), sews him
back up, and revives his evil spirit with the assistance of a guidebook
called "Voodoo for Dummies". Their first victim: a goth punk wannabe
(hilarious Alexis Arquette of The Wedding Singer) who ends up suffocated
during a menage a trois with Chucky and Meg. But after domestic
squabbles ensue, Chucky electrocutes Meg in a bathtub-and her spirit
possesses a female doll called Tiffany. United as toys, Chucky
and Tiffany enlist the help of ignorant next door neighbour Jesse
(Stabile) to retrieve an amulet that will enable them to transfer their
souls back into a human being. So Jesse and his runaway fiancee, Jade
(Heigl, whose breasts also deserve special mention), naively transport
the multiple-murderer dolls across America, leaving a trail of bodies
behind.</P>
<P>As horror icons go, Chucky is one of the most absurd. His pint size and
minimal strength prevent him from doing much damage without the
assistance of a whole person. Yet in BRIDE OF CHUCKY, he (along with
Tiffany) manages to shoot a quiver of nails into corrupt police chief
John Ritter's face (after this and his turn as a psychotic android on
"Buffy The Vampire Slayer", Ritter has proved he can play a heavy), blow
up a car, and impale a pair of newleyweds with a thousand shards of
glass. After the lame, tame Urband Legend and I Know What You Did Last
Summer (why both those movies were given an "R" rating remains a mystery
to me), BRIDE OF CHUCKY's tasteless, repulsive and extreme violence is a
breath of fresh air. Chucky's a nihilist-he and Tiffany decide to off
one key character just because they haven't killed someone in a while!
Dourif's excellent voicework is the most lively and memorable
performance he (has repeatedly given) since becoming American cinema's
resident wacko. (After winning an Oscar for his portrayal of tragic
Billy Bibbit in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Dourif took to playing
human monsters in such films as The Exorcist III and Body Parts.) His
Beavis-esque vocal stylings are matched by Kevin Yagher's special
effects: the puppeteering of Chucky and his bride is flawless-very
little of it looks computer-assisted.</P>
<P>If BRIDE OF CHUCKY fails to entertain on one level, it's in the
alliterate characters Jesse and Jade. Both are unaware of Chucky and
Tiffany's evil: they take turns accusing each other of a secret and
insatiable appetite for homicide. The trouble is, this young couple is
excruciatingly dull (although I suppose it's difficult not to be
upstaged by Chucky and Tiffany). And don't bother going for the
scares-there aren't any. The fright factor is nil, but the laugh
quotient is high; not since Peter Jackson's Meet The Feebles have
devilish (and, I should add, carnal) dolls been this guiltily enjoyable
to watch.</P>
