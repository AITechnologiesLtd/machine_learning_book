<PRE>                      THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST
                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>

<P>"The hills are alive with the sound of ...'</P>
<P>What's that awful noise? Oh my goodness .. It's THE NANNY!</P>
<P>My grandmother is a big fan of Fran Drescher, and "The Nanny". So we
went to see this movie, and what we essentially saw was - well - another
two hour episode of "The Nanny"; but without the strong supports of
Niles and Miss Babcock.</P>
<P>She's a beautician (what's new); is hired by the wealthy dictator of a
eastern European country (Dalton) to look after his children. Sound
familiar? Unfortunately, there isn't any singing nuns or hostile Nazi's
to help make the plot more exciting.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, Fran Drescher has decided to stick with what she knows
best - big hair, make-up, high heels and unorthodox child rearing.</P>
<P>Comment: For die hard fans of "The Nanny'.</P>
