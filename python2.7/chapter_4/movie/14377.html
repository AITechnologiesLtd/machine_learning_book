<PRE>"Rounders" - The Real Deal
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Poker players are a strange breed indeed.  If they can't find their way
to the poker rooms of the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City or to the fabled
Mirage in Las Vegas where the best players in the world sit down,
they'll still find a game somewhere.  Maybe it'll be in the back room of
some bar, or in the basement of some rundown building.  And never mind
the heavy smoke or cramped quarters or dank surroundings.  These people
are known as 'rounders.'  Poker to them is a delirious mix of
on-the-edge living and all-out warfare.  For these people, the rippling
of the cards is a call to arms, outplaying your opponents is the goal,
and stacks of chips become their ammunition.</P>
<P>"Rounders" offers a fairly accurate exploration of this hidden world
where fortunes are won and lost overnight and your only friends are the
cards in your hands.  Here, we meet up with Mike McDermott (Matt Damon).
He is a card-playing whiz who has been financing his law school tuition
through poker.  But one bad hand costs him everything, and he vows to
retire from the game.  Worm (Ed Norton) is his friend who was just
recently released from prison.  He also plays cards but wins his
fortunes through cheating.  He owes a lot of money to some disreputable
people, and Mike decides to continue to play in order to help him out.</P>
<P>The strength of this movie, however, does not lie within the story
between Mike and Worm.  For me, I was more intrigued with how it focused
on the shady, almost-invisible environment and how it highlighted the
many nuances that you have to master in order to play poker well.
Being a mediocre poker player who periodically plays the 10-20 Hold 'em
games at the Taj and one who can be labeled, to a certain degree, a
'rounder', the movie hits the mark in several areas.  We see various
types of players such as Kinish (John Torturro) who looks to win one or
two hands an hour in order to grind out a living and David KGB (John
Malkovich) who runs one of these poker rooms and whose weakness lies in
the way he eats Oreos.  The movie also accurately presents, through
narratives, the psychology required to win.  And it shows how playing
can suck you into a vacuum as you forget about everything else around
you.</P>
<P>I recall watching Maverick where the final few people played their last
hands.  One player held 4-of-a-kind; the villain held a 7-high straight
flush and the winner miraculously won with a Royal Flush.  Entertaining
- yes; realistic no.  This film could be considered the flip side of
that movie.  Authentic - yes; original - no.  "Rounders" is more
interesting than entertaining, but certainly one of the best movies
whose subject matter is poker.</P>
<P>Grade: (B-) if you don't play poker; (B) if you do.</P>
