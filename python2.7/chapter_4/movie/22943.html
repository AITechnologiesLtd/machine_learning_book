<P>   When the new millennium began last month, the world did
not end nor did terrorists succeed in striking a single blow
against the West.  The day came and went with no changes. 
But if you look from a slightly longer perspective of the past
decade, the biggest change appears to be the loosening
of a sense of loyalty that companies have toward their
workers not only here but even in Japan--where large
companies had heretofore guaranteed their employees
lifetime jobs.  The nineties was the decade of downsizing, of
shifting alliances, and large segments of the working
population who were formerly dedicated to unionism found
that there was simply no organization around any more to
defend their interests.</P>
<P>   Jim Jarmusch's "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,"
dramatizes this dereliction of allegiance in his own quirky
way.  The Czech-German-French-Irish filmmaker known to all
movie buffs mostly for his eccentric comedy "Stranger Than
Paradise" (about a bland young man, his dimwitted friend,
and his 16-year-old cousin who come to America from
Hungary), and "Mystery Train" (about a trio of foreigners who
stay in a sleazy hotel), retains his style of slow pacing and
idiosyncratic characters this time around as well.  "Ghost
Dog" intersperses the rules and regulations of two disparate
groups, the Japanese samurai and the American Mafia, to
dramatize the decline of the old loyalties and the inability of
anyone, however disciplined, to restore the codes of respect
and honor of previous generations.</P>
<P>   While the movie is punctuated by intermittent and
abundant shoot-outs, Jarmusch casts a meditative demeanor
around his latest project, highlighting close-ups of the
brooding, isolated and generally friendless Ghost Dog (Forest
Whitaker), a professional hit man for the Mafia.  Attacked in a
racial incident by a band of thugs,  Ghost Dog's life had been
apparently saved by a mid-level mobster named Louie (John
Tormey), who guns down the man's assailant.  The
expression "I owe you one" takes on a profound meaning, as
Ghost Dog, a student of the culture of the Japanese samurai
whose bible is the 18th century warrior text "Hagakure: The
Book of the Samurai," pledges himself as a retainer to his
unlikely new master.  But when Ghost Dog hits the lover of
mob boss Ray Vargo (Henry Silva) while the boss's daughter
is still in the room, Vargo cannot forgive Louie for failing to
put the emotionally distant young woman on the bus before
the assassination.  He orders Louie to hit Ghost Dog or forfeit
his own life.</P>
<P>   What could have been just another B movie about
gangsters takes on a special resonance as Jarmusch
introduces some of the oddest characters, such as the
obligatory old mob "uncle" who wears glasses, leans on a
cane, and occasionally spurts out the most unusual racist
epithets.  An African immigrant who sells ice cream from a
truck and speaks a French that no one else can understand
is yet another curious individual--given to announcing over his
loudspeaker each day that "ice cream is healthy...I heard this
from a nutritionist on the radio today...lots of calcium."  The
vendor (Isaach de Bankole) and Ghost Dog do not
understand a word of each other's conversation but are best
friends and chess partners, and they look out for each other.</P>
<P>   While "Ghost Dog" is too sluggish to be compelling and is
dependent on a taciturn title character, the movie has an
exciting hip-hop soundtrack by a group known as The RZA
("Rizzah"), and a few compelling scenes such as one in
which Whitaker practices some swordplay on the roof he
shares with his carrier pigeons in a scene reminiscent of a
key vista in Soren Kragh-Jacobsen's Danish feature "Mifune." 
Whitaker is thoroughly believable as a kind of Don Quixote
(or, in a sense, Sancho Panza) who rebels against the
passing of the old order of chivalry and continues to fight
windmills in an age becoming bereft of loyalty codes.  We
root for the guy--who kills only criminals--and wonder what
advantage still lies in being a wiseguy in the 21st Century.
The goodfellas in this movie can't even pay the rent in the
clubhouse, which is situated in a Chinese restaurant, and for
diversion idle away their days watching TV cartoons featuring
Felix the Cat and Woody Woodpecker.  As proof of the
mobsters' dysfunction, look closely at the boss' daughter,
Louise Vargo (Tricia Vessey), a basket case of emotional
deadness and intellectual vapidity.  Jarmusch displays a neat,
occasionally comic, but ultimately flat blend of disparate
people who--as the tagline says--live by the code and die by
the code.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 116 minutes.  (C) 2000
