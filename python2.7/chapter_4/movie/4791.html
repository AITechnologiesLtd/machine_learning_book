<PRE>                            ANGELS AND INSECTS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Humanity is seen as an analogue of
          the insect world in this adaptation of a story by
          A. S. Byatt.  William Adamson is a naturalist
          forced by circumstances to become part of an upper
          class English family in the 1860s.  Their household
          melodrama parallels the insect world.  Rating: low
          +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     In the 1860s naturalist William Adamson (played by Mark Rylance)
has come back ten years in the Amazon jungle but on the way lost all
his notes and specimens in a ship disaster.  His patron, the
Rev. Harald Alabaster (Jeremy Kemp), has invited Adamson to visit the
Alabaster country estate.  The Reverend Alabaster has embraced the
teachings of Charles Darwin, albeit reluctantly, and is looking to
Adamson to help him sort out his crisis of faith in the face of
changing ideas.  Adamson is struck by the beauty of Alabaster's
daughter Eugenia (Patsy Kensit), but having lost everything he cannot
hope to win her, particularly with Eugenia's snob brother Edgar
(Douglas Henshall) reminding Adamson at every turn that while he is a
guest at the Alabaster estate, he is of quite a lower station in life
and must never think of himself as being anywhere near an equal.
However, Eugenia's fiance committed suicide before Adamson knew her and
with Eugenia's younger sister marrying Eugenia feels the need to be
married.  Knowing that she is considered out of his caste, Adamson
offers what help he can give to Eugenia, even marriage, and is
astounded when his unobtainable love readily accepts his offer.  The
marriage is an odd one and not wholly satisfying, but Adamson is able
to channel his time into the study of ants on the Alabaster property.
It is a study in which he is ably assisted by Matty Crompton (Kristin
Scott Thomas), a quiet, spinsterish relation to the Alabasters also
living at the estate.  Adamson finds to his amazement that Crompton is
at least his equal in intellect.</P>
<P>     If all this sounds a little bit like a Jane Austen plot, the
answer is yes, it is a little bit like that, but it is also very
different in theme.  There is also some Charlotte Bronte thrown in.
And something more.  The story, the photography, and even details like
the costume design are intended constantly to compare and contrast the
upper class society with the society of insects, particularly ants and
butterflies.  It does so as the odd behavior of the Alabaster family is
developed.  The problem is that the we note the odd behavior for so
long that we start to wonder why we are being shown so much upper-class
weirdness we no longer really want to understand the family.
Eventually the viewer gets tired of waiting for some concrete
development.  It is not that there is not some interest to the study of
the ant world and its comparison to the Alabaster family social
structure.  But the film seems aimless for too long before things tie
together.  The screenplay is by Belinda Haas who edited the film Philip
Haas who directed.  The same team did the same tasks on 1993's THE
MUSIC OF CHANCE, which was a better film.  While it was perhaps even
more enigmatic than this film, it seemed like an enigma to better
purpose.</P>
<P>     ANGELS AND INSECTS is a bit of a disappointment and rates a low +1
on the -4 to +4 scale.  Incidentally, don't look too hard for angels.
The book ANGELS AND INSECTS had two novellas, one having to do with
angels, one with insects.  This is an adaptation of "Morpho Eugenia,"
the novella about insects.</P>
