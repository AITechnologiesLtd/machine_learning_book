<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>     The title of 'Speed 2: Cruise Control' is an oxy-moron.  The film is
anything but in control whether it's intentional or not.  What made the first
film so incredible was that confined areas had plausible scenes of tension
with a couple of exceptions.  There was also a genuine acceptance for the
second rate characters and a villain with panache and flamboyance.  A lot of
that is missing from this sequel that suffers from being nothing more than a
crashing bore.</P>
<P>     In one of the first opening scenes of 'Speed 2' we are asked to believe
that reckless driving is funny and is part of being a free spirit as Sandra
Bullock flunks out on her driving test and her boyfriend (Jason Patric) is a
member of the LAPD just as her companion (Keanu Reeves) was from the first
film.  We are told she apparently broke up with Reeves because of the
dangerous nature of his job.  Why would she hook up with a guy in the same
line of work?  You can tell that Patric's role was originally intended for
Reeves who decided not to make this sequel and he is off the hook from a
badly written movie.  </P>
<P>     Bullock is astoundingly annoying in this film and director Jan DeBont
who made the first film and 1996's 'Twister' should have recognized the bad
jokes, frumpy dialogue and razor thin interest that 'Speed 2' would generate.
 I guess his background as a noted cinematographer has not allowed him at
this point to catch these academic errors.  </P>
<P>     Willem Dafoe is a mad bomber this time around who sabotages Bullock and
Patric's cruise in the Caribbean with computers and gadgets of assorted
terror and his motivation is bent on revenge against the system that Dennis
Hopper's villain had from the first film.  Dafoe doesn't look like he's
having all that much fun playing the bad guy this time around and that's
suspicious.  Jason Patric, who is such a good actor is naturally expected to
save the day with his experience as a police officer but this time around his
faceless, dull expressions make Keanu Reeves look like a genius.</P>
<P>     This movie is an example that sometime less is more and while this
sequel is bigger in its presentation of special effects, it's a reminder that
quality and not quantity is what sells and that movie audiences don't want
their intelligence insulted</P>
