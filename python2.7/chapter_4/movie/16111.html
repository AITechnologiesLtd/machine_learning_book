<P>"The Manchurian Candidate" stars Laurence Harvey
as Raymond Shaw, who returns from the Korean War
a hero and a Medal of Honor awardee.  Major Marco
(Frank Sinatra) remembers Shaw differently, however,
in a recurring nightmare as a killer brainwashed
by Russian and Chinese brass.  Harvey's mother
is Angela Lansbury, a calculating Communist Agent
and wife of blustering Senator Iselin (James Gregory).
If Shaw is an assassin controlled by communists,
who is his target, and can Marco stop him?</P>
<P>At first viewing, "The Manchurian Candidate" is a tense
drama.  Subsequent viewings transform the film into a
black comedy, with Shaw and his Senator stepfather the
most humorous characters.  Shaw is stolid but bewildered,
almost sympathetic in his contempt for everything,
while the alcoholic, idiotic Senator gives a great
performance as Lansbury's shameless puppet.</P>
<P>"The Manchurian Candidate" is not without minor flaws.
The audience must accept two enormous coincidences:
Shaw overhears a bartender advise a game of solitaire
with Marco arriving as a witness, and Jocie arriving
at the costume party wearing the Queen of Diamonds.
Lansbury is only three years older than Harvey, who
plays her son.  And Janet Leigh's character falls over
herself picking up Sinatra, despite his inability to
light a cigarette, his distance, and his getting arrested.</P>
<P>These flaws aren't important compared to the film's
strengths.  "The Manchurian Candidate" never compromises
in its attack on right-wing demagoguery, and Shaw's
willingness to kill without remorse is chilling.
Lansbury may be the worst mother in screen history.
Sinatra's fight with Henry Silva is a memorable brawl,
complete with eye gouging and rib kicking.  And
the dream sequences with the laconic soldiers
and cynical communists are mesmerizing.</P>
<P>When John F. Kennedy was assassinated a year after
"The Manchurian Candidate" was released, the film was
shelved by Sinatra, and was unavailable for the next
two decades.  The film's cynical, satirical, and
conspirational attitude toward politics and assassination
had become unacceptable.  Seen today, however, the
film's viewpoints appear as valid and relevant as ever.</P>
<P>The British Academy Awards awarded "The Manchurian Candidate"
Best Film of 1962.  Their American counterparts were not
as receptive, but Lansbury was nominated for Best Actress,
and Ferris Webster was nominated for film editing.</P>
