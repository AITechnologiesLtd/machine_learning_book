<PRE>                             DEAD MAN WALKING
                       A film review by Rui Sadio
                 Translated from the Portuguese by Rui Sadio
                        Copyright 1996 Rui Sadio</PRE>
<PRE>Rating (0 to 10): 9.1</PRE>
<P>Since I remember, I can't find any movie so capable to obligue an 
audience to reflect about a certain subject, in such a powerful way as 
"Dead Man Walking" makes us to reflect about the death penalty question.
First of all, I have to say that this movie is, in my opinion, the best 
movie of 1995 and certainly one of those which I won't forget easily.</P>
<P>"Dead Man Walking" is based on the book with the same name by Sister 
Helen Prejean, a nun who has worked with condemneds to death for a long time.
Directed by Tim Robbins, one of my favourite actors, this film has also 
the brilliant and unforgetable performances of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon.</P>
<P>Sean Penn is Matthew Poncelet, a condemned to death who receives 
spiritual help of Sister Helen Prejean, a role interpreted by Susan Sarandon,
in his last days of life.
Both artists are sensational in their performances and that happens 
because they don't act separately. I mean, the Sean Penn's interpretation 
"lives" from the Susan Sarandon's interpretation and vice versa. Is 
something like Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins in "The Silence of the 
Lambs". However, now the dialogues between the two principal characters 
are even more dramatic and emotional than those in the Jonathan Demme's 
film. That's why I think Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn should win the 
oscars of the Academy, this year. The most significant part of the 
movie's power is due to their work.</P>
<P>"Dead Man Walking" is too far of being an anti-deathpenalty movie. On the 
contrary, "Dead Man Walking" follows a guide-line which divides the two 
opposite opinions, becoming the frontier between those convictions.
There are times when we think that death penalty is a fair way to punish 
a person who has already destroyed the life of so many people. However, 
there are times when we start believing that a death can't pay another 
death. After all, if no one has the right to kill then we shouldn't apply 
the death penalty, or else we should be punished too.</P>
<P>Tim Robbins is the responsible for this revolution inside our minds. He 
manipulates us as he wants and he never discloses what is his position.
He makes us be sorry for the condemned but he makes us hate the condemned!
All the directing work is superb, including the beginning of the film, 
showing that Tim Robbins is more than an excellent actor. In fact, he is 
also an excellent director.</P>
<P>At last, a reference to the mysterious music that emphasizes the dark 
side of the film. Songs which are intimately connected with the 
characters and the movie environment. We can listen to Bruce Sprinsteen, 
Johnny Cash, Suzanne Vega, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Eddie Vedder and many 
others. After seeing the movie is very important to listen to the 
soundtrack.</P>
<P>"Dead Man Walking" is one of those movies that everybody should see and 
reflect about. The death penalty question deserves that reflection.
About my position, I just say I'm happy for living in Portugal, one of 
the first countries to abolish that kind of punishment.</P>
