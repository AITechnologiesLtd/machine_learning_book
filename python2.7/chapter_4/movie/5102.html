<P>     This likable romantic comedy stars Janeane Garofalo (BYE BYE
LOVE, REALITY BITES) as a talk-show pet doctor who pretends to be
her blonde-model friend (Uma Thurman) after a charming caller (Ben
Chaplin) asks her out on a date.  (Think "Cyrano" Lite.) Mildly
hilarious before it descends into "touchy-feely" tedium, THE TRUTH
ABOUT CATS AND DOGS is hampered by the casting of two equally
attractive leading ladies.  For the conflict to work as it's
written, the characters need to be a real "Mutt and Jeff" pair.
However, Ms. Garofalo is easily as appealing as (if not more than)
Ms. Thurman.  (If Uma looks less-ravishing than usual, I'd blame the
terrible 'do that she wears!  Woof!) Director Michael Lehmann
(HEATHERS) tries to make Janeane look frumpy, but to no avail.  She
shines even brighter than her co-star and that's a problem for
believability.  (Maybe a better title would be THE TRUTH ABOUT
WOMEN'S SELF ESTEEM?) That said, Janeane, Uma, and Ben Chaplin have
a very good chemistry together.  They make this a trip to the vet
that's arguably worth taking, even for those of us who gag at all
the canine- and feline-related humor.</P>
