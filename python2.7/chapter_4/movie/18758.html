A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Jon Turteltaub</PRE>
<P>Written by: Gerald Di Pego, based on the novel "Ishmael" by Daniel Quinn</P>
<P>Starring: Cuba Gooding Jr., Anthony Hopkins, Donald Sutherland, Maura Tierney</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is a young psychiatrist who has been given
an interesting case to study: An anthropologist named Ethan Powell (Anthony
Hopkins) who has lost his humanity living in the Rwandan wilderness among
mountain gorillas has been caught, deported, and sent to an American prison
psychiatric ward after killing two rangers. Caulder makes regular therapy
visits to converse with Powell and to try to figure out his mentality. Is
Powell a brutal killer, an ape man, or a downtrodden naturalist with a
legitimate complaint against society? </P>
<P>Opinion:
INSTINCT plays like a mystery. Mountain gorillas are gentle herbivores who
only attack in self defense, so what could possibly cause an eminent
scientist with the mentality and friendship of herbivores to go out and
attack rangers? Psychiatrist Theo Caulder takes the whole movie to find out
the reason when the answer is obvious. </P>
<P>INSTINCT isn't very convincing. As Powell Anthony Hopkins seems too
educated and studious to have ape-like episodes of superhuman strength and
brutish behavior. It makes the character seem more like a split personality
than a scientist with a secret reason. That a keen mind such as Powell's
would relish an alternate identity as a primitive, grass-eating forest
creature instead of using his wits and tool-making abilities in the jungle
is barely credible. Similarly unconvincing is the bond between Theo Caulder
and Ethan Powell. Their psychiatric relationship is a clinical,
teacher/student thing. But as Caulder Cuba Gooding Jr. seems overly
emotional, as if the two protagonists had shared more happy moments than
they actually had.</P>
<P>The film's major theme is the innocence of nature versus the corruption of
humanity. This is a noble goal, but INSTINCT hits you over the head with
it. As Powell Anthony Hopkins even draws a colored map of ancient Earth and
diagrams man's historic exploitation of nature. Much more compelling is the
side plot involving Maura Tierney as Powell's neglected daughter, trying to
understand why her father had abandoned the family. To me, a more
intriguing INSTINCT would be a complex movie about a daughter trying to
rediscover the lost father she never knew. </P>
