<PRE>Deconstructing Harry
Directed by Woody Allen
Starring: Everybody</PRE>
<P>Woody Allen's latest film, Deconstructing Harry, is a fine addition to his
masterful body of work. It doesn't have the sweetness of Annie Hall, or the
goofiness of Sleeper. What it does have is originality that blends well with
the bitterness, the autobiographical aspects, and the brash humor. Allen has
taken a new approach technically with "Harry" while he returns to some of his
classical short story writing, many traces of which can be seen here.</P>
<P>Harry is a writer who has just completed a book, based strongly on his
experiences, that upsets all of the women in his life. The film is a montage
of his current predicament and scenes played out on screen with other actors
in his role. (Richard Benjamin, Stanley Tucci and Tobey Maguire all play Harry
in various embelished stories from the book.) Occasionally, to break even
further with conventional narrative, Harry will meet these characters who are
based on himself and have conversations with them. Though it doesn't really
matter, this film doesn't flow terribly well, but it is obvious that Allen
doesn't want it to. </P>
<P>One of the technical aspects that Allen employs here is a unique editing
approach. Much of the film consists of scenes in which dialogue is cut
abruptly to flash forward only a few seconds in time. Cuts will also be made
to show brief passages in time. For example, a character may be sitting in one
position and rather than show them shift in their chair, a quick cut will be
made to their new position. It is extremely unique and works well with the
overall concept of the film, which is expressed in the title, deconstructing
this writer and all of his immoralities.</P>
<P>One of the best sequences in the film involves an "out of focus" Robin
Williams, which must be seen to be believed. It is one of the most original
and hilarious concepts I have seen in modern filmmaking. That brief sequence
alone is enough for me to recommend this picture to even those who are not
Allen fans.</P>
<P>The language in Deconstructing Harry is much more abrasive than in most of his
films. It helps to illustrate the nastiness of Allen's character who is as
neurotic and whiny as he always was, but now has a bit of a gruff and bitter
edge.  The film is fun for many reasons, not the least of which is the cast
which includes Elizabeth Shue, Billy Crystal, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, Demi
Moore, Eric Bogosian, Amy Irving, Judy Davis, Julie Kavner, Kirstie Alley and
Robin Williams. There are many lines in the film that you will probably be
using for years to come. And Allen isn't afraid to let inventive filmmaking
take the place of solid narrative here. Plus, fans of his books will see many
references to old stories. Deconstructing Harry is strange to say the least,
but a must for Allen fans and most likely enjoyable for anyone who wants a
good laugh.</P>
<P>3 stars
