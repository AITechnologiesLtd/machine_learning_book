<P>Trick is a gay gay film. No, this is not a typo, since both meanings 
of gay are intended, as Trick is a rather upbeat romantic comedy. 
Nowadays gay films are out of the closet and into the street. Gayness 
has stopped being camouflaged or apologetic or sad or militant or 
whatever. It is treated above-board and openly. Trick is a good case 
of a movie that's entirely matter-of-fact in its subject and 
treatment.</P>
<P>The aptly-name Gabriel is a pretty angelic-looking, low-key gay young 
man who aspires to song-writing in the old tradition of musicals. He 
is helped (or is he hindered?) by his best friend since high-school 
days. She us Katherine, a hyper-kinetic actress. To give a 
demonstration Gabe sits at the piano and Kate sings and tap-dances. 
It's quite funny.</P>
<P>Gabe is a relative loner, and on the shy side. He shares an apartment 
with Rich who is heterosexual with a vengeance, as he regularly 
preempts their lodgings so as to activate his libido with a string of 
women. This  forces Gabe to spend a lot of time out of the apartment.</P>
<P>On such an evening, Gabe decides to have a look at the rich gay scene 
of which he is not a part. At a strip bar, he and the 
athletic-looking go-go boy Mark get each other's attention. Then, by 
coincidence, they meet on the subway, where Mark energetically picks 
up Gabe. One thing leading to another, the active Mark and the rather 
passive Gabe spend a long night (The Long Night is the title of a 
film and the essence of several others) looking for a place to be 
alone together. But they get foiled time and again, in often comic 
ways. However, what started out as a search for sex ends up as the 
beginning of a love affair.</P>
<P>As the  mini-Odyssey proceeds among the night-life clubs and 
activities of gays, there are several asides, parentheses, 
interruptions and characters, several of those quite entertaining. 
The film does not occur in real time, since events go from one day to 
the next dawn, but it has a sort of classic unity of time, place and 
subject.</P>
<P>Some scenes go on for too long before the movie cuts to the chase, 
yet many other scenes are well-times. Among others, they show quite 
cannily the transformation of Ben from timidity and embarrassment to 
sexual openness, and of Mark from stud-ness to caring (and from what 
we thought of as just a body to someone with brains).</P>
<P>The subject is not really terribly interesting, nor would it be in a 
non-gay film. In fact, with variations, a some heterosexual movies 
have been about a man and a woman looking for a place to be together. 
I am also thinking in particular of some Czech, Polish or Hungarian 
films  where the guilty party was a Communist society with a terrible 
dearth of apartments--even rooms. The political subtext added much. 
especially in the indirect ways needed to make such works acceptable 
to official censors.</P>
<P>Yet what Trick lacks in originality is made up by its colorfulness 
and by its succession of solid comic inventions. E.g. a drag queen 
called Coco Peru with her flamboyance and advice to Gabe, in the 
toilets; or, in a bar, an older man's funny new song "Come to gusta 
mi pinga"; or, in Gabe's and Rich's place, a woman who is a 
caricature of Marilyn Monroe bears her breasts and "philosophizes."</P>
