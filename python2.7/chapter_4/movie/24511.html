<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>The reign of Caesar Marcus Aurelius in the mid-second century A.D. is
often considered a golden age of the Roman Empire. Marcus was 
instrumental in securing peace in the nether regions of the Empire, but 
was also a philosopher of great renown. He died in 180 and rule passed to 
his son Commodus. The transition was an orderly one; Commodus was 
recommended to the Senate by Marcus, and indeed had been sharing power 
with his father since 177. Commodus' rule, however, would go down in the 
history books as disastrous, with the Caesar's demeanour descending into 
brutality and ultimately madness. In 182 his sister Lucilla and a group 
of senators tried unsuccessfully to have him assassinated. Commodus 
became obsessed with the gladiatorial games, and in 192 his own advisers 
had him strangled by a popular wrestler.</P>
<P>"Gladiator" is a condensed and largely fictionalised version of the true 
events. The most notable addition to the story is Maximus (Russell 
Crowe), a general who leads the Romans to victory against the German 
tribes to the north. Contradicting real life, Marcus Aurelius (Richard 
Harris) wants Maximus -- not Commodus -- to be Rome's new ruler after his 
death, with the aim of eventually turning the empire back into a republic. 
Before he can proclaim his decision, however, the deceitful Commodus 
(Joaquin Phoenix) murders his father and orders Maximus' execution.</P>
<P>Maximus escapes and tries to return home to Spain, only to discover that 
Commodus has had his wife and son killed as well. Gravely wounded in his 
flight, Maximus is captured and bought by Proximo (the late Oliver Reed)
to fight as a gladiator. Initially reluctant, Maximus soon embraces his
new role when it gives him a chance to travel to Rome, where the new
Caesar has declared 150 days of gladiatorial games to celebrate his 
ascension to the throne. There, Maximus' efforts to take revenge on 
Commodus involve him in the machinations of Commodus' sister Lucilla 
(Connie Nielsen).</P>
<P>The first blockbuster movie of the 2000 summer season, "Gladiator" is a 
visual feast. Expert set design and computer effects have been exploited 
in their fullest by director Ridley Scott to bring ancient Rome to life. 
Shots which pan overhead across the city to the Coliseum, teeming with 
spectators, are fabulous to behold. It is difficult not to feel  
transported eighteen hundred years back in time.</P>
<P>In some respects, however, Scott overdoes it with his cinematic trickery. 
Specifically, he portrays many fight scenes -- both with the gladiators 
and the legions -- using a choppy, strobe-like technique. Scott is 
clearly trying to achieve the sense of disorientation in battle that was 
so successfully conveyed in films like  "Braveheart" and "Saving Private 
Ryan". Instead, he merely makes these sequences disjointed and hard to 
watch. It is virtually impossible to follow the actions of even the 
principal characters, and so the viewer is left to try to piece together 
what is actually happening.</P>
<P>It has been more than thirty years since the last great Roman epic was 
made. In reviving the genre, the scriptwriters have elected to hew 
closely to tried-and-true storylines rather than break new ground. 
"Gladiator" does not deviate much from other examples of the genre, 
echoing everything from "Spartacus" to "Doctor Who". The mad emperor, the
resurgent war hero, and the gladiatorial games as a conduit for revenge 
are all familiar plot elements. Nonetheless, the story is entertainingly 
told, and while considerable attention is paid to the gladiator combat 
which is the movie's main attraction, this is not overaccentuated. 
"Gladiator" is no "Mortal Kombat", moving from meaningless battle to 
meaningless battle without pause. The film is very well paced, and the 
quieter aspects of the plot are not trivialised.</P>
<P>Perhaps as a result of this, "Gladiator" boasts some unusually fine 
acting for a big-budget action picture. Crowe, although by no means 
achieving the complexity of his Oscar-nominated performance in "The 
Insider", brings a pleasant depth to Maximus. The general is a man first 
and a hero second; he is driven to confront Commodus not by a love of 
Rome, but rather of a man who was as a father to him, and of a murdered 
wife and child whose deaths he must avenge. Crowe brings an evenness to 
the role which makes Maximus seem more real than similar characters in 
other movies.</P>
<P>Likewise, Phoenix does well not to overplay Commodus. The role of the
insane tyrant has often been an invitation to hammy overacting in the 
past, but Phoenix's portrayal is more subtle. Commodus' burgeoning 
madness is manifested largely through his body language, rather than any 
particular statement or deed. Also very good are Reed and Harris in 
supporting roles. Despite their comparatively short screen time (indeed, 
Reed actually died before filming was complete, forcing Scott to 
compensate using clever editing and digital effects), both grant their 
characters a sense of history and profundity.</P>
<P>Perhaps least successful is Nielsen as Lucilla, despite having what may be
"Gladiator"'s most involved role. Lucilla is Commodus' sister, and he 
obviously harbors inappropriate feelings for her. It is also strongly 
implied that she is Maximus' former lover. And she is a dispassionate and 
intelligent schemer, whose allegiances may be pivotal in determining 
Rome's future. But Nielsen comes across as detached throughout the 
proceedings, more so than is called for by her character. Even in scenes 
where Lucilla's reserve breaks, Nielsen feels removed from the action. 
Given her importance in how the events of the movie play out, this is an 
unfortunate central weakness.</P>
<P>But all in all, "Gladiator" is entrancing to watch, beautifully acted, 
and really just a lot of good old-fashioned fun. Although far removed from 
the greatness of classics like "Ben-Hur", it marks an entertaining and 
satisfying return of what was once one of Hollywood's favourite genres.
Indeed, given the possibilities offered by this age of increasingly 
sophisticated special effects, "Gladiator" is hopefully just the first 
of many forays back to the time of the great Roman Empire.</P>
