<PRE>                                    BEAUTIFUL GIRLS
                       A film review by Larry McGillicuddy
                        Copyright 1997 Larry McGillicuddy</PRE>
<PRE>****  (out of 4)                                  
Directed by Ted Demme                                       
Starring Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon, Michael Rappaport,    
Natalie Portman, Uma Thurman, Mira Sorvino, Rosie O Donnell </PRE>
<P>There have been numerous films about twentysomething males  
who have a fear of commitment and worry where their lives   
are headed. Last year's wonderful independent feature       
"Kicking and Screaming" is an example, and Diner is the     
Citizen Kane of this genre. Most of these films follow a 
similar pattern. The guys spend a lot of time drinking beer,
fantasizing about women they cannot have, and forgetting    
about what they have right in front of them. "Beautiful     
Girls", a recent video release, doesn't offer much new to   
the genre, but what it does offer is a literate, laugh out  
loud script by Scott Rosenberg, sound direction from Ted    
Demme, and a first-rate ensemble cast.                      </P>
<P>"Beautiful Girls" is set in a small New England town where  
nothing changes and nobody leaves. One of the few that did  
escape is Willie (Hutton), who has come back for his high   
school reunion. He is uncertain about his future with his   
current girlfriend, who wants him to make a commitment. </P>
<PRE>Tommy (Dillon) is the former high school football star, who 
now has a job plowing snow during the winter, and           
construction during the summer. He has an anorexic          
girlfriend (Sorvino), who he is cheating on with his former 
high school sweetheart, now married.                        </PRE>
<PRE>Paul (Rappaport) is a man so obsessed with supermodels he   
has pictures of them all over his wall, and he has even     
named his dog Elle MacPherson. He has waited too long to    
commit to his girlfriend of 7 years, who is now "banging the
meat cutter" as he so subtly puts it.                       </PRE>
<PRE>Needless to say, these two are definitely not good role     
models for Willie at this time.                             </PRE>
<P>Then suddenly, Willie becomes entranced by two women. One is
a drop dead gorgeous city girl who is knowledgeable about   
sports and does whiskey shooters to boot. She is the ideal  
woman, almost too good to be true. Then after teaching each 
of the guys a lesson, she promptly vanishes almost like an  
apparition. This is the most interesting work Thurman has   
done to date. </P>
<P>Then there is Marty, the 13 year old neighbor of Willie's   
father. Willie thinks she might be the ideal woman for him, 
and actually considers waiting 5 years for her when she's   
legal age. As played by Portman, Marty is a girl wise beyond
her years. The dialogue given to Marty is almost too        
literate, but it's a credit to Portman that she can actually
pull it off and make it seem like a 13 year old could       
actually talk like that. The scenes between Hutton and      
Portman are magical. We can begin to understand why they    
like one another, and also why they weren't meant to be.    </P>
<P>Aside from the exchanges between Portman and Hutton, there  
are several other wonderful vignettes in this movie. Rosie  
O' Donnell plays the local beautician who delivers a        
blistering monologue about how blind men can be. And the    
film's higlight is a scene in a bar where the gang firsts   
meets Thurman, who asks Willie to play something, and they  
break out into a chorus of "Sweet Caroline". It's a magical 
scene. For one moment, they are able to recapture the       
memories of youth when life wasn't so complicated.</P>
<P>"Beautiful Girls" is a humorous, funny, and touching film. It doesn't  
take any easy routes to its conclusion, and none of it seems
contrived. It belongs with "Diner" and "Kicking and         
Screaming" as the best in it's genre. </P>
