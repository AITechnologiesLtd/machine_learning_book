<PRE>Vatel (2000)</PRE>
<P>The Cannes Film Festival always produces good movies. At least that's what
they say. So I went to Vatel, a non-Hollywood movie, first released in
Cannes.</P>
<P>Although it is a non-Hollywood movie, it has all the elements of Hollywood.
A big budget, a big set, and famous Hollywood artists (Uma Thurman, Tim
Roth). The only french things in it is Gerard Depardieu and the setting.</P>
<P>Set in 1671, the story is about the visit of King Louis XIV to the Castle of
Prince Conde. The Prince of Conde must prepare a set of festivities to make
sure that the King is happy, so he assigns his Master Steward, Francois
Vatel, (Depardieu) to prepare a three-day banquet.</P>
<P>The whole movie is set in the huge Castle of Conde. Very detailed
background, you can see the difference between kingdom and peasants in
seconds. I can't recall any other movie set in 17th century France with such
precise details. From the castle, to the clothes, to the props, to the food.</P>
<P>But with this good set comes a vague story. For the first hour I was still
guessing where the movie is going to. There weren't a lot of conversations,
and when there was one, it was short with high-class language. It looked
like a love triangle, but it wasn't. Actually it was just the Master Steward
preparing the whole party. And then the fish came too late, or he was just
too impatient.</P>
<P>It's worth watching only when you're interested in 17th century France. Or
Gerard Depardieu's big nose. After all, it is a non-Hollywood movie. If
you're looking for action or suspense, then just go to The Gladiator or MI-2
again.</P>
