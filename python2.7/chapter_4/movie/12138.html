<PRE>U TURN
*** of **** grade is B-</PRE>
<P>There are two ways you can go with U Turn.  You can state that it has no
pont and is contrived, or you can see it as a nice change of pace for a
great director.  That director is Oliver Stone, I have liked everyone of
his film - except Natural Born Killers - and his new found shooting
style.  This style consists of B&W, underexposed film, cornball lenses
and unusual camera angles.  Many find this distracting and migraine
inducing, I find it a wonderful way to add personality to a film.</P>
<P>The story is about a former tennis player (Sean Penn), who owes a
lownshark money, is short two fingers, has car break down in Supierior,
Arizona, fights off murder hirings, a jealous kids warnings and the
philosophy of a blind indian.  During this he meets a Grace (Hot
Jennifer Lopez), who seduces him into a compromisng situation, and has
her husband (Nick Nolte) come home and suckerpunch Penn.</P>
<P>Poor Penn, as you can tell by my synopsis, he is banged around like a
demented pinball.  He goes from frustrating situation to equally
frustrating, watching Penn is fun as you see a man on the edge given
continuous nudges.  U Turn also has echos of After Hours - from another
master in Martin Scorsese - that was a better film (although it had
flaws) and yet quite a compliment for U Turn to be compaired with.</P>
<P>U Turn is technically a black comedy, while After Hours was a regualar
comedy.  Hours had a happy ending and Turn, well.  Both film are
interesting chage of pace films for director stuck in a rut of mega
productions, but this doesn't gel quite like you'd expect a Stone film
to be.  I liked the nasty touches in the film, and the acting is first
rate.  I am giving the film a very mild recomendation to those who feel
like a stylish, bloody, and often sick film that ends up being
suprisingly fun.</P>
