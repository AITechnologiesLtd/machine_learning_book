<P>   When President Clinton and his wife Hillary were in Russia
during the late summer of 1998 meeting with Yeltsin, Hillary
introduced him everywhere: "This is Bill Clinton, the president
of the United States."  Why is this unusual?  In every previous
instance, she would introduce him as "my husband, Bill
Clinton."  So says Joe Klein, a top political columnist in a
recent issue of the New Yorker magazine.  That's not all.  "B
touches H gently on shoulder as she passes.  H stares
straight ahead."  This too from the notepad of Joe Klein.  A
small matter?  Nope.  Significant?  You bet it is.  If you doubt
the gravity of this subtle body language, sit through Christian
Vincent's engrossing film "La Separation," a 1994 picture
released in New York and other markets this October.  </P>
<P>   "La Separation" deals with a couple who have been living
together for just about two years.  They have a lovely child of
eighteen months, Loulou (Louis Vincent) who is cared for
largely by a young and attractive nanny, Laurence (Laurence
Lerel).  You could probably imagine that when life was rosier,
Anne (Isabelle Huppert), a business executive, introduced her
lover (Daniel Auteuil), as "Pierre, the man I live with."  Now
that their relationship seems to be headed south, she'd
probably inform everyone, "Meet Pierre: he's a commercial
artist."  How do we know this?  By the little things that mean a
lot.  They sit in a crowded theater watching an Ingrid
Bergman movie.  Pierre is more interested in Anne than in the
screen.  He closes his palm around hers.  She pulls away. 
"I'm trying to watch the film," she complains.  He pouts.  They
still live together, attend parties, and visit their best friends,
Victor (Jerome Deschamps) and his live-in girl friend Claire
(Karin Viard).  But their connection is frayed and is not likely
to be patched together.  "La Separation" is about reality.  It is
not at all influenced by American-style optimism.</P>
<P>   The glory of "La Separation" is that Christian Vincent
captures it in a distinctly different style from the way an
American romance-gone-sour would be played.  There is just
one violent scene that's over in a flash.  The man is at first
quite understanding when his live-in lover tells him flat-out,
"Pierre; I think I fell in love with someone."  We all know how
a red-blooded Texan would react to that, and for that matter
look at how Takuro Yamashita (Koji Yakushi) responds in
Shohei Imamura's Palme D'Or winner at the '97 Cannes
Festival, "Unagi."  A blood bath results when he falls upon his
wife in flagrante delicto with another man.  </P>
<P>   "La Separation" is a simple enough story of a relationship
gone bad.  If this were an American movie, a critic would
seek Anne's motivation for alienating Pierre's affection.  Here
it's not necessary: in fact the audience is encouraged to
guess, based on what the mature, intelligent viewers have
experienced or witnessed in their own lives.  Perhaps, as is
quickly hinted, she got bored while he suffers.  No matter. 
What does count is that "La Separation" features two first-rate
actors whose every gesture speaks volumes about their
feelings.  Isabelle Huppert, who dazzled critics and audiences
alike in the far more action-filled drama "La Ceremonie,"
proves her mettle once more by communicating her emotions
by a twitch of the right eye here, a look to the side there.  She
elevates the film, produced by the famed Claude Berri, far
above melodrama by turning her feelings on and off
unpredictably.  One moment she is agreeing to Pierre's
decision to separate, to live apart.  In a twinkling she rests her
head lightly on his chest in a show of tenderness which in the
hands of another actress would seem laughable if not
downright bizarre.  </P>
<P>   Pierre is not so able to hide his emotions.  He lets it all
hang out with his pal Victor, probably a mistake because no
one can really help a man who is losing not just the woman
he cares for but the infant he cherishes and has carefully and
regularly videotaped.  When he appears toward the
conclusion red-eyed, dazed, not knowing even how to get
home, even the passing taxicabs sense that something is
wrong and refuse to stop for him.  While director Vincent may
not have intended us to take sides, we can't help feeling that
Pierre is being treated unfairly.  But what "La Separation"
really wants to say, I think, is that life is unfair, romantic love
is fleeting, and that the two lovers face an existential dilemma
that is all too common.  As one character reports, "Love
stories start rosy, then the relationships go to the dogs."  </P>
<P>   La Separation is obviously not for an audience targeted by
producers of Van Damme films, nor is it even for the folks
who think a show is first-rate because "I laughed, I cried."  It's
for a discerning constituency seasoned enough to have been
battered by life's inexplicable impasses, people who can
empathize equally with a couple who have loved and lost
through no apparent fault of their own.  The understated
performances by Huppert and Auteuil are nothing short of
astonishing.</P>
