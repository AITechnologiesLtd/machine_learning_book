<P>What From Dusk Till Dawn is, I'm not so sure. It's two completely
different movies sewn together to make a freakish looking final product.
One is a gangster story with violent and profane mannerisms, much like
earlier work of writer and co-star Quentin Tarantino. The second is a
gory bloodbath involving a battle against the un-dead, lots of
explosives and severed limbs. Where one story merges into another is
hard to say - but the result is an enjoyable time, if you've got the
stomach to withstand it.</P>
<P>The story picks up in the desert near the Mexican border, where the
Gecko brothers - Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Tarantino) - have
just robbed a bank and killed four rangers in the process. They need to
pass the border so they can meet their accomplice at a Mexican
rendezvous point, but have trouble maintaining a living hostage in their
possession, because Richie is prone to shooting them. Stopped at a
motel, they come upon a former preacher named Jacob Fuller (Harvey
Kietel), and his two children (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu). They even
have a motorhome - perfect for a quiet getaway. And so the brothers'
take the family of three hostage, until they have safely crossed the
Mexican border and reached their destination.</P>
<P>The rendezvous point chosen is a wild, raunchy biker bar called the
`Titty Twister', populated by naked women and tight-fisted truckers.
This is where things get really bizarre. After Seth and Richie bruise up
some of the locals, it becomes apparent that the Titty Twister is
infested with ravenous vampires hungry for blood. From here on in, the
movie turns into a gory action fest that never lets up. Tarantino and
director Robert Rodriguez steal largely from films like Sam Raimi's Evil
Dead, but this part of From Dusk Till Dawn is more of a homage than
rip-off. And there is no room for the squeamish; heads roll, people are
disemboweled, and chunky flesh splatters in all directions. But it also
means that the main characters must also depend on each other, so they
can make it until dawn alive.</P>
<P>>From Dusk Till Dawn is a fun movie. The entire second half is done with
tongue-in-cheek, making it more ridiculous than scary. Part of the
enjoyment comes in the casting; for instance, hunky TV star George
Clooney is admittedly an odd choice to play the hero figure in something
like this. But in a pleasant surprise, Clooney is admirably game as he
mangles the hapless vampire race with amusing enthusiasm. Kietel, in the
midst of such a ridiculous plot alteration, still manages to deliver a
fairly good performance. And then there are other survivors in the bar,
who amazingly have the ability to slaughter vampires as if they do it
for a living. In a neat bit of casting, one such character is played by
famous makeup guru Tom Savini, who calls himself (for no apparent
reason) `sex machine'. Salma Hayek plays a voluptuous Mexican dancer
named Satinico Pandemonium. But alas, she is a vampire too.</P>
<P>As expected in a Tarantino film, the exchanges of dialogue are spewed
out in sharp and witty bursts of startling profanity between characters.
But all that is weighed down when the silly monster plot abruptly takes
over. And practically everything seems so appropriate in the third act
of this movie. For instance, hordes of vampires can't get through a
small wooden door (or even attempt to) as the main characters anti up
with weapons found in crates that truckers had brought through. Then, as
the good guys launch an assault using crossbows and super soakers filled
with holy water (that was clever), the un-dead seem to keel over a bit
too easy. Plus, all myths and legends associated with vampire movies
(garlic, crosses, etc.) conveniently work like a charm. But what's the
use of this criticism? The movie checked it's brain at the door, but was
fun anyhow.</P>
<P>If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino films, you should enjoy From Dusk
Till Dawn. At least the first half.</P>
