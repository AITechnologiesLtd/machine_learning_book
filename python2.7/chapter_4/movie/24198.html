<PRE>EAST IS EAST
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>When the father of two would-be brides compliments George Khan (Om Puri
from MY SON THE FANATIC) on his having six beautiful sons, George
immediately sets the record straight.  He has only five sons, now since
one is dead.  Actually, the supposedly dead son is very much alive; it
is just that his father has written him off and removed all traces of
him from their home after the boy walked out during his arranged
wedding.  The young man was offered a beautiful bride but one that he
neither loved nor knew before the wedding day.</P>
<P>In a comedic drama of clashing cultures, EAST IS EAST tells the story of
a Pakistani man, his English wife and their 7 kids, who live in a
working-class neighborhood in England.  The family owns a small
fish-and-chips shop called George's English Chippy, in which everyone in
the family pitches in to keep it going.</P>
<P>Trying to run his family with Muslim strictness, George is a
good-natured blowhard.  His wife, Ella (Linda Bassett), whom he loves
dearly, generally ignores his attempts to rule their family with an iron
glove.  Only when it comes to his marrying off their sons does she
reluctantly yield.  Their marriage is basically a good one, full of
playfulness and love.  But, when pressed, he reverts to his own
upbringing and lays down the law in his household, in which he thinks
that the father should be lord and master.</P>
<P>Most of the movie is a sugary confection of little episodes typified by
the one about the circumcision of the youngest son, Meenah (Jordan
Routledge), a boy about 12 years old.  In a completely unbelievable
incident, the mother realizes that Meenah, whom she had undoubtedly
diapered a thousand times, was never circumcised as she had assumed.
Meenah is seen urinating -- an activity that occurs with bizarre
frequency in the film -- by a Muslim cleric, and the cleric is shocked
that the boy is not circumcised.  The father quickly arranges for an
operation ("It's only a little operation.  It won't hurt."), which puts
an understandable amount of fear in the lad.  His older sister torments
him after the operation by drawing a picture of a penis, which she tears
in two, taunting him by saying "Ouch!"  This produces the show's only
substantial laugh.</P>
<P>When the father tries to marry off two more of his sons, the would-be
brides turn out to be some of the ugliest women around.  This sets up
the story's overly long and bittersweet concluding segment, in which the
good-spirited picture turns mean and the father loses our respect but
not his wife's.</P>
<P>Director Damien O'Donnell, working from a script by Ayub Khan-Din,
continually pulls his punches, never quite making either a truly funny
film or a biting social satire.  The result is a movie that's kind of
cute and kind of poignant, which all adds up to being only kind of nice.</P>
<P>EAST IS EAST runs 1:36.  It is rated R for violence, sexuality and
language and would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
