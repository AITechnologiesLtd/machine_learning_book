<PRE>                               DAWN OF THE DEAD
                       A film review by David Wilcock
                        Copyright 1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<PRE>DIRECTED BY GEORGE A. ROMERO
RUNNING TIME= 2HRS 20 MINS </PRE>
<P>After NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, the second of the zombie films by Romero is
basically a remake, but in colour, and with A LOT of blood and guts. Like
watching zombies heads explode, people getting ripped apart, and a
screwdriver going through someones brain? You've found your film. But is
not just blood and guts. There is also lots of messages about what the
world is like today.
The film, by the way, isn't that bad. Although i wouldn't recommend this if
you're squemish, there is only one gory zombie death (involving a
screwdriver) All the others basically get their brain separated from their
body by shotgun blasts. This is the main problem with the film. It is
INCREDIBLY repitive. You just know how the zombies are going to die, and
thats with a shotgun blast. 
The zombies themselves do are really quite scary. The extras do convincing
extras, and they even though some funny things, like going up the down
escalator. (The film is set in a shopping mall, where the survivors are
hiding in) Also, we get to like the heroes of the piece quite well, and
their personalitys show well.
There are, of course, some corny lines in it ('When their no more room in
hell, the dead will walk on earth') and the ending seems a bit tacked on,
like they didn't when to end the movie. (The movie is 2hrs 20mins roughly,
which is far too long)
Sadly, then, this movie is not as frightening or as good as NIGHT OF THE
LIVING DEAD, but then again isn't as bad as some Stephen King adaptations
or other tacky horror movies. But after all the things I heard people
saying about it (It's really scary, etc) I was midly disappointed. But if
this film is at a horror season at your cinema, or showing on TV, go along
and see it. Although mindless, you will probably enjoy it.</P>
