STRIKING DISTANCE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Those people who didn't like Hitchcock used to say that he
made entire movies around single, most effective scene. In
case of STRIKING DISTANCE, 1993 thriller directed by Rowdy
Harrington, the most original and effective scene is
actually wasted in the beginning. What follows is rather
formulaic plot about Tom Hardy (played by Bruce Willis),
Pittsburgh homicide detective and one of the many members of
his family who chose police profession. Loyalty towards his
colleagues and kinsmen is seriously challenged when he
starts investigating the case of a serial killer and finds
out that the perpetrator might be policeman. But this is not
the end of his problems - first, his own father (John
Mahoney) becomes one of the killer's victims, and later on,
his coleague and cousin Jimmy (Robert Pastorelli) commits
suicide after being accused for brutality because of Hardy's
testimony. The ratting on colleague is unforgivable crime
and Hardy is transferred to the River Rescue service. Two
years later, he is embittered alcoholic, but the new wave of
killings would make him re-start investigation, this time
with the help of partner Jo Christman (Sarah Jessica
Parker).</P>
<P>STRIKING DISTANCE is rather forgettable film, which
shouldn't surprise anyone, because the script, written by
Rowdy Harrington and Martin Kaplan, is so full of cliches
and predictable plot twists, that the film itself is hardly
distinguishable from hundreds of similar products produced
by Hollywood in that era. The only difference, perhaps is
the setting - city of Pittsburgh is something like a
refreshment for all those viewers who are tired of seeing
all crime thrillers set in Los Angeles, New York or, in case
they got lucky, New Orleans or Chicago. However, city in
question was probably chosen because of being situated on
three rivers, which allowed Herrington to direct many and
endless chases including speedboats. Some of those action
scenes work, and some don't - in any case, they hardly
justify a whole bunch of formulaic subplots and wooden
characters. The acting is mostly fine - whole bunch of
capable character actors like John Mahoney, Dennis Farina,
Andre Braugher or Brion James do their best to rise above
mediocre script. The lead actor, Bruce Willis, was probably
in one of the worst periods of his career - post-HUDSON HAWK
and before PULP FICTION - so his character, although still
being wise-cracking self, is hardly memorable. Another
disservice to him is done with pairing his character to the
token female in the form of Sarah Jessica Parker, good actor
totally unsuitable for the role and romantic pairing with
zero chemistry. All in all, STRIKING DISTANCE is movie
unworthy of attention, made watchable only by rather sad
collection of great acting talents who had deserved much
better film.</P>
