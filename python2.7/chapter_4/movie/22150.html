<P>1999 appears to be the year where filmmakers pay tribute to the
entertainment medium that paved the way for celluloid: theater.  This
summer saw the release of John Turturro's stage-set _Illuminata_, and
opening this month are Mike Leigh's _Topsy-Turvy_ and Tim Robbins'
_Cradle_Will_Rock_.  All films bear their own unique qualities (on a
basic level, _Illuminata_ is a complete fiction, while _Topsy-Turvy_ and
_Cradle_ both have some grounding in historical fact), but Robbins' film
stands apart in that in addition to providing a portrait of the New York
stage circa the 1930s, it also aims to capture the political climate at
the time.  It's a grand ambition, but Robbins is able to pull it off, if
only in the end.</P>
<P>While politics loom large over the film, Robbins, as one well knows, is
an actor himself, and thus the theatre plays no small part in _Cradle_. 
The film is titled for _The_Cradle_Will_Rock_, a politically-themed,
pro-labor-union musical composed by one Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria). 
The production, directed by a tempestuous young Orson Welles (Angus
Macfadyen), is the focal storyline of the film, but it's also not the
only one.  Elsewhere, wealthy Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack)
commissions Mexican artist Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) to paint a mural
in the lobby of his new building.  Margherita Sarfatti (Susan Sarandon),
a representative for Mussolini, gives valuable paintings to millionaires,
one of whom is one Grey Mathers (Philip Baker Hall), in return for their
support of the Italian war effort.  The American government conducts
hearings that will determine the future of the Federal Theatre Project,
which is valiantly defended by its head, Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones);
but helped taken down by a low-ranking employee (Joan Cusack), who in
turn is pursued romantically by a ventriloquist (Bill Murray).</P>
<P>With so many characters and so much going on, _Cradle_Will_Rock_
meanders with no clear agenda for most of its running time.  As messy as
it gets, the proceedings are kept watchable by the work of the stellar
cast, which also includes Emily Watson, John Turturro, Vanessa Redgrave,
and Cary Elwes.  Everyone does a fine job with their roles--though Jones
impresses the most.  The actors also have an infectious ball working
together; pairing two live wires like Cusack and Murray proves to be an
especially inspired move on the part of Robbins.  Even so, as the film
bounces between characters and plot threads, interest flags at times.</P>
<P>But all the disparate elements and ideas in Robbins' screenplay
gradually weave together and then cement into a rousing climax that
powerfully makes its points about the importance of artistic freedom.  In
the end, _Cradle_Will_Rock_ proves to be a very apt title; it sways
haphazardly for a while, but it does eventually find its steady rhythm.</P>
<P>At two hours and forty minutes, _Topsy-Turvy_ runs about a half hour
longer than _Cradle_Will_Rock_, but writer-director Leigh doesn't take
quite as long as Robbins does to find his film's footing.  A lot of that
has to do with _Topsy_'s more modest ambitions; Leigh only aims to make a
light tribute to the genius of the musical team of lyricist/librettist
William Schwenck Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and composer Arthur Sullivan
(Allan Corduner).  And Leigh has succeeded in a most delightful way,
offering a witty and engrossing behind-the-curtain look at the rocky
making of one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most celebrated works,
_The_Mikado_.  Broadbent and Corduner are the stars of this film show and
both do a splendid job (in particular Corduner), but what makes the film
an especially enjoyable romp are the supporting players who do a
wonderful job of performing selected scenes from the actual musicals. 
The long but snappily-paced _Topsy-Turvy_ isn't as deep or "important" a
work as Leigh's best-known film, the Oscar-nominated _Secrets_&_Lies_,
but it certainly a lot more fun--which is the point.  (_Topsy-Turvy_
opens December 17)</P>
