<PRE>                                   KOLYA
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     "I'm only a distant father," pleads confirmed bachelor Frantisek
Louka.  "I meant to say a step-father."  An ambulance driver is leaving
Louka's 5-year-old step-son Kolya with him, and Louka tries in vain not
to accept delivery.</P>
<P>     Kolya's mother had paid him to marry her temporarily so she could
get out of Russia.  On his doorstep now is a boy whom he never expected
and doesn't want.  It gets worse.  The kid is adorable but only speaks
Russian, and Louka only speaks Czech.  And worse still,  since the
mother has fled the country, the police interrogate Louka about the
marriage scam.  Being questioned by the police in Prague in 1988 is not
to be taken lightly.</P>
<P>     Thus is the setup for the sweet and touching little picture KOLYA
by director Jan Sverak.  KOLYA is this year's entry from the Czech
Republic to the Academy for consideration for best foreign film.</P>
<P>     KOLYA is a sometimes slow picture that quickly wins your heart.
There is great chemistry in the acting of the two leads.  Zdenek Sverak
plays Frantisek Louka, a 55-year-old man who is extremely handsome and
believably has several romantic interests.  He is a serious looking but
playful man whom women in the story find charming, and so does everyone
in the audience.  The film's sexual situations are never explicit, and
yet the show has some naturally erotic scenes.  The best has to do with
Louka's bow while playing at a funeral.  He uses it to caress the
singer and his main romantic interest, 40-ish Klara (Libuse
Safrankova).</P>
<P>     Besides taking one of the lead roles, Zdenek Sverak, the father of
the director, also created the imaginative script.  In the story Louka
earns his income as a musician playing at funerals -- lots of funerals.
Since he needs more money, he has several odd jobs, including restoring
gravestones.  It is through the latter position that his friend Mr.
Broz (Ondrej Vetchy) talked him into marriage as a way to solve his
financial difficulties and allow him to buy that little used car he
wants.</P>
<P>     Zdenek Sverak's performance is strong enough to carry the film,
but he is usually upstaged by the other lead, Andrej Chalimon as the
little boy with whom he does not quite know what to do.  Chalimon is
one of the sweetest and most photogenic child actors I have seen in a
long time.  His facial expressions are so sincere and sad that they
will steal your heart.  Most of the time he is that way, but in some
precious little scenes, like the time he is read to in Russian over the
phone, he comes alive and chatters away.  The press kit said that they
had some difficulty with Chalimon since he is such an incessantly happy
little boy.  They took to reading him sad stories before many of his
scenes so he could get into character.</P>
<P>     Although it will come as no surprise that the script has Louka
coming to love his unwanted son, it is significantly more believable
and involving than the Hollywood-style versions we have come to expect.
When the inevitable child-in-danger part comes, you will be as
frightened as I was and yet never feel manipulated.</P>
<P>     The show ends on both a sad and a happy note.  I was starting to
cry at the former until I almost started to clap at the latter.  KOLYA
is a show that will make you richer in spirit for having seen it.</P>
<P>     KOLYA runs 1:45.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual situations and for
a couple of mild profanities.  To be interested kids should probably be
about ten or so.  I recommend the film to you and award it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
