<P>When it comes to the cast members of `Friends' making the transition to
film, success is scarcely evident. Perhaps the most profitable move to
cinema was made by Courteney Cox (now Courteney Cox Arquette), who
experienced enormous prosperity with the renowned slasher films `Scream'
and `Scream 2'. Matthew Perry, although appealing and undeniably
charming, has received the short end of the stick in his ventures to the
big screen.</P>
<P>I enjoyed Perry's `Fools Rush In', but the film was generally savaged by
critics, leaving it in tattered box office ruins. And in the forgotten
comedy `Almost Heroes', the actor looked suitably embarrassed as he
played second fiddle to the late Chris Farley. The right vehicle was
waiting for Matthew Perry, but until he could work up the courage to
track it down, the comfy confines of `Friends' would have to suffice. Is
`Three to Tango' the crown jewel in Perry's bag of tarnished rocks?
Certainly not. But, with it's beguiling charm and infectious appeal,
this light romantic comedy is indeed a tasty entree.</P>
<P>Oscar Novak (Perry) and Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt) are members of a
design team hoping to revitalize an aging city landmark with a new,
attractive layout. The project financier is a greedy millionaire named
Charles Newman (Dylan McDermott), who must choose between Novak and
Steinberg and an opposing design duo (played by John C. McGinley and Bob
Balaban). But first.... Charles' secretary overhears a conversation
between Oscar and Peter, and makes the inaccurate assumption that they
are gay partners. Charles gets immediate wind of this news, and, worried
about male competition, he hires Oscar to spy on his beautiful mistress
(Neve Campbell) at an art show.</P>
<P>As with most romantic comedies, the primary weakness in `Three to Tango'
is in it's setup. The characters are introduced in such a frenzied rush
that they come across devoid of depth and discernible feeling. The
situations are not particularly funny or interesting. But the mistaken
identity premise at the film's core provides more cheerful fun than one
would rightfully anticipate. There's nothing you won't be able to
predict, but director Damon Santestefano's approach is an inviting one,
and the continuous appeal of the actors generates enough fuzzy charm to
fill three movies of a similar genre.</P>
<P>Although the issues are interesting, the experience of `Three to Tango'
is not going to linger in your mind. It's pleasant, but instantly
forgettable. Oscar initially goes along with the false humor of his
homosexuality, in fear of letting the definitive moment of his career
slip carelessly through his fingers. But, when the news gets out in the
open, he is helpless to defend his strictly heterosexual intentions.
Borrowing tidbits from the amusing comedy `In and Out', in which Kevin
Kline was mistakenly `outed' at the Academy Awards, Oscar's friends and
family are left bewildered with the arrival of the shocking news. Amy,
Charles, onlookers on a city bus - everyone believes Oscar is gay. As
Platt puts it: `You've made a big gay bed, and now you must slumber
gayly in it.'</P>
<P>It's nice to see Neve Campbell free herself from the bloody (`Scream')
and the dirty (`Wild Things'), and attempt to portray nothing other than
good old-fashioned cute. Whenever Campbell lends her bright, attractive
charisma to a scene, `Three to Tango' sparkles with genuine appeal. The
relationship between Oscar and Amy is convincing, mainly because both
leads are charming and have the ability to balance the weight of the
relationship with precise believability. The sparks generated in their
unlikely romance are extremely hard to resist. And, in wonderful spirit,
Oliver Platt once again registers as a quirky supporting player. My
question is: when will his assembly line of quirky supporting characters
ever stop? There was `The Three Musketeers', `Lake Placid', and now this
primary example. One thing is for certain: Platt is good at what he
does.</P>
<P>`Three to Tango' is refreshingly full of honest, well-executed humor
that will strike a chord with most audience members. What's lacking is
the presence of a decent script that doesn't rely heavily on predictable
plot devices and underdeveloped characters. However, those characters
are played by actors with enormous charm - enough charm to guide this
light, enjoyable romantic comedy to moderate success.</P>
