<PRE>_Flawless_ (R) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>With a title like _Flawless_, writer-director Joel Schumacher has set
himself up for the easy critical jab, so allow me to get it out of the
way right here, right now: _Flawless_ is anything but.  However, this
small-scale character drama from the poster child for studio-manufactured
bombast is not without its flashes of perfection even if the whole is the
opposite of its title.</P>
<P>_Flawless_ may take its title from a drag queen beauty pageant that
figures not-at-all-prominently in the plot, but it best serves as a
description of the terrific performances featured in the film.  First and
foremost there is Robert DeNiro, who initially does not break any new
ground as retired New York security guard Walt Koontz, a homophobic macho
man who is constantly annoyed by the drag queens who practice singing in
the apartment across the way.  But after Walt suffers a paralyzing
stroke, DeNiro turns in some of his most impressive work.  His physical
mannerisms are entirely convincing largely because he doesn't overdo
them; he shows remarkable control as Walt's condition slowly improves
through the course of the film.</P>
<P>That improvement is in no small part due to the drag queen who is Walt's
main target, Rusty (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who reluctantly gives Walt
singing lessons as speech therapy.  Hoffman's performance is the direct
opposite of DeNiro's, all flamboyance as opposed to subtlety.  It's a
showy part, no doubt, and Hoffman far from downplays Rusty's theatrical
nature, creating more than a few funny moments.  But his work also
conveys genuine heart; one easily feels the pain behind Rusty's heavily
made-up exterior.</P>
<P>Even the more peripheral supporting players are noteworthy, in
particular Daphne Rubin-Vega, who is touching as Tia, a young tango dance
hall patron who carries a torch for Walt.  But performances do not
entirely a movie make; there has to be an interesting story to tell. 
Unfortunately, Schumacher doesn't come up with one.  As can be gleaned,
the focus of _Flawless_ is the unlikely friendship that develops between
Walt and Rusty, and while the relationship is not without its
charms--DeNiro and Hoffman play, pardon the term, flawlessly off of each
other--there's nothing terribly distinctive with how it develops.  Adding
another layer of contrivance is a tired thriller element Schumacher
places on top of it, involving some shady characters looking for stolen
money.</P>
<P>Schumacher obviously intended _Flawless_ to prove that he can pull off a
small-scale film, but he's only half-succeeded.  The strong performances
show that he can coax winning work from his cast within more modest
settings.  While that proves his ability at a director, his dull script
shows his writing ability lags far behind.</P>
