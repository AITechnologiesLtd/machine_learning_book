<PRE>A Fast-Moving, Fun-Filled "Rush Hour"
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>The words "fun" and "Fall" don't usually go together.  We're done with
the mega-productions of the summer and we are approaching the time
period that is heavy on movies that are vying for Oscar's attention.  It
gets harder to find a true piece of popcorn fare that is consistently
pleasing and exciting to watch.  But "Rush Hour" manages to be just
that.  Although familiar in formula, this action-comedy is enormously
entertaining.</P>
<P>When the daughter of a wealthy Chinese consulate is kidnapped by a
Chinese crime organization, the FBI quickly take on the case.  The FBI
agents, however, don't want help from other people whom they think will
interfere with the successful return of the consul's daughter.  They
certainly don't want help from a foreign detective (Jackie Chan) who the
consul has personally requested.  And, they don't want help from the
local police.  So, to keep them out of the way, they tell the assigned
police officer (Chris Tucker) to babysit the arriving Chinese detective
and to stay out of sight until the case is solved.</P>
<P>When they first meet, it looks like a match made in Hell.  Both like to
work alone, and hate having a partner.  While driving around, Chan wants
to listen to the Beach Boys over the radio while Tucker insists on
listening to Hip-Hop.  But despite these and other oddball differences
(watch Tucker walk into a pool hall whose clientele are tough-looking,
black men and greet them saying "what's up, my ni**er" and then see what
happens when Chan does the same thing!), they both have one thing in
common.  They both want to save the consul's feisty and precocious
daughter.  To do so, they need each other.  Chan needs Tucker to show
him around LA.  Meanwhile, by taking Chan around, this will earn Tucker
brownie points with his boss.  During their investigation, they both get
to showcase their unique skills.  Tucker uses his soprano-ish,
mile-a-minute mouth to talk his way in and out of locations.  And when
trouble sparks, Chan steps up and we are treated to some terrifically
choreographed fight scenes featuring the Asian's gravity-defying martial
arts.</P>
<P>Rush Hour does two things very well.  First, it let's Tucker and Chan
showcase what they do best.  Tucker is genuinely funny especially when
he gets to make fun of his new partner.  Meanwhile, there's no denying
Chan's affability.  He's sweet, innocent, and packs a mean chop.
Secondly, the film has some strong performances from its supporting
players that elevates the suspense level, which is something that's hard
to do in a buddy cop comedy.  The Fall movie season certainly gets off
to a funny start.  This film offers a crowd-pleasing mix of comedy and
action that makes "Rush Hour" anything but slow.</P>
