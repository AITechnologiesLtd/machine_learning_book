<P>PAYBACK
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: **1/2 (out of ****)
Paramount / 1:41 / 1999 / R (edgy violence, langauge, sexuality, drugs)
Cast: Mel Gibson; Maria Bello; Gregg Henry; James Coburn; Kris 
Kristofferson; William Devane; Lucy Liu; David Paymer; Deborah Kara 
Unger 
Director: Brian Helgeland 
Screenplay: Terry Hayes; Brian Helgeland<HR>If you don't flinch at the thought of a guy getting his toes broken one 
by one with a mini-sledgehammer - and the sickening crunch booming in 
amped-up surround sound - then "Payback" is without a doubt your kind of 
movie. Though said torture scene - easily cinema's nastiest since Kathy 
Bates fractured James Caan's ankles in "Misery" - happens near the 
climax of this gritty crime thriller, it's preceded by a steady stream 
of drug overdoses, bone-smashing, oozing wounds, bloodletting, 
sadomasochism, various mayhem and other very bad things. Don't be fooled 
by perennial nice guy Mel Gibson's casting in the lead role - in 
"Payback," nice guys finish last. </P>
<P>In fact, it'd probably be a safe bet to accuse "Payback" of employing 
nary a nice guy in its complex story. Gibson's Porter character is the 
closest thing to a protagonist it has, and audiences will get the gist 
of his nastiness from the opening on: Not only does he narrate the film 
in the gravelly, low-octave hush commonly associated with the rogues 
gallery, we also get our first glimpse of him as he swipes a cash stash 
from a crippled vet. OK, so this panhandler turns out to be phony - even 
the bit parts aren't sympathetic here - but the point is that this 
Porter guy is someone with a vicious streak you definitely don't want to 
provoke. </P>
<P>Too late. Gibson starts off "Payback" already in a snit, and an 
understandable one at that. It seems he recently fell the victim of a 
scam at the hands of his duplicitous partner Val (Gregg Henry); Val 
helped Porter pull off a $140,000 heist from the Chinese mob and then 
stabbed - well, shot, if you really wanna know - his buddy in the back, 
leaving him for dead. But heavies rarely go down without a fight, and 
when Porter makes an unexpected recovery some months down the road, he 
hits the mean streets to track down Val and collect his $70,000 cut by 
any means necessary. This is where all the afore-mentioned 
unpleasantness kicks in. </P>
<P>"Payback" is so deliriously violent that audiences expecting a cuddly 
crime yarn a la the last few "Lethal Weapons" are going to be shocked 
into submission. And speaking of submission, one of the recurring 
vicious plot threads likely to distress unsuspecting viewers involves 
the kinky machinations of an Asian dominatrix named Pearl ("Ally 
McBeal"'s Lucy Liu), a gal who mingles pleasure and pain with malicious 
glee. Like it or not, the supporting cast includes many colorful roles 
like the above, and their featured sidetracks are far more fun to behold 
than Porter's pulpy lust for revenge. As assorted lowlifes, David 
Paymer, James Coburn, William Devane and Kris Kristofferson steal more 
than their share of scenes. </P>
<P>Much has been made of the fact that "Payback" had quite a troubled 
production schedule - apparently director Brian Helgeland's cut of the 
film did not appease Gibson, or something of the like, and a decent 
amount of new footage was reshot in order to lighten the tone a bit. It 
sort of shows: The first half of the movie is exceedingly dark and 
brooding in ways that are almost distancing, while act two exceedingly 
lets humor (mostly of the black comedy variety) and its star's 
never-fail charm seep into the mix. The hard-to-classify final result - 
you try putting it in the appropriate genre - is dangerously uneven but 
still a decent game of double-crossing and one-upmanship.<HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck

"There is possibly an audience for this movie, but I have the oddest 
feeling that on opening night the people in the theater will all be in 
black and white. See 'Pleasantville' if you wonder what I mean. In fact, 
see 'Pleasantville' anyway." -Roger Ebert on "I'll Be Home for 
Christmas"</P>
