<PRE>Don't Mess with "Shaft"
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>When Detective Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson) says, "don't
make me chase you," the bad guy better be able to
escape.  When Detective Shaft is involved in a shoot
out, the bad guy better not miss.  When Detective
Shaft is on a mission, you better stay out of his way.
 If you don't, he'll come at you with the fury of a
tornado.  He's a man to be reckoned with, and he'll do
whatever it takes to get things done.</P>
<P>Shaft will have to take matters into his own hands if
he is to find closure with his latest case, which
involves the death of a young, black man at a local
club.  Arrogantly confessing to the crime is Wade
(Christian Bale), son of a wealthy and well-respected
community member.  He gloats about what he did and
chuckles to Shaft that he'll be released on bail and
that nothing will ever happen to him.  Because no
witnesses will testify and Wade has squirrelly
lawyers, he easily posts bail and walks away.</P>
<P>Shaft is incensed.  He wonders how justice can be so
blind.  But he knows what to do.  He must find a
witness to the murder.  Using his unique brand of
sleuthing skills, which means invariably demanding
favors or threatening people, he is able to locate
Diane (Toni Collette).  She was a bartender at the
club that night who actually saw the crime take place.
 She has been silent, fearing that testifying against
such a powerful person would be extremely dangerous.  
Shaft promises to keep her safe, but when Wade finds
out about Diane's intentions, he wants to have her
permanently silenced.</P>
<P>"Shaft" (the man and the movie) is mostly about
attitude and style.  Jackson is very confident,
sporting a wicked goatee while clad in leather pants,
a leather overcoat, and sleek sunglasses.  The women
just love him ("it's my duty to please your booty," he
says to one of them).  He talks tough, walks tall, and
never let's you down.  Meanwhile, the film showcases
the nostalgic look and feel of a 70's film.  It has a
soundtrack unique to that era, features Richard
Roundtree (who was the original Shaft), and includes
Isaac Hayes (who sang the original) singing the
opening song.  </P>
<P>Yet, about two-thirds of the way into the film, the
glaze of the "Starsky & Hutch"-like soundtrack and
Shaft's penchant to insult and intimidate may begin to
bore you.  You discover that the film is spiritlessly
plotted and lacks a rewarding dramatic arc.   It also
becomes oddly chaotic as it approaches the final
climactic scenes.  New people seem to come out of
nowhere, and there is a very busy shoot out sequence
where dozens of bad guys are crammed into a small
apartment.  </P>
<P>There are heroes that use intelligence to best their
opponents and there are heroes that use weapons to
defeat their enemies.  But Detective Shaft (Samuel L.
Jackson) virtually taunts them into submission.  He
reminds us that fighting crime is a tough business,
and it requires an equally rugged individual to get
things done.  He stares down his opponents, spews
threats like a volcano spews lava, and takes matters
into his own hands when he thinks, for example, that a
pistol whipping might get the point across more
effectively.  This guy is one tough mutha.</P>
