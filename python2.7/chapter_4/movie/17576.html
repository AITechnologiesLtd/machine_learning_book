<P>Perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this
decade have to do with special effects. There is no question that
action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the
character of their light and noise. Whereas classic adventure pics of
the last twenty years, such as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, were made in
grand traditional fashion; contemporary films like JURASSIC PARK are
multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology. The latest in this
visually awesome series of movies, the Wachowski brothers' THE MATRIX,
is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to
enhance a movie's story. </P>
<P>Unlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy
blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise, THE MATRIX is a
carefully constructed special effects event. It runs 135 minutes in
length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range
from gimmick to grandiose, and the quality of the effects remains
constant throughout the film's length. Contrary to popular trend, THE
MATRIX commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound. </P>
<P>In this regard, the movie is something like a card sharp. With its
flashy mass stripped away, THE MATRIX would be quite shallow and
untalented. The script is characteristically weak, and the dialogue
suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach. But, like the
card sharp, THE MATRIX wows its audience to such a high degree that
actual content is irrelevent. The viewers don't care about what THE
MATRIX has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right
around the corner. </P>
<P>And right around the corner they usually are, for the script tells a
fast-paced, albeit frequently revisited story. As the movie explains,
the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program
constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating
mankind. Billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the
intelligence -- the Matrix -- "farms" our life energy. Only a select
group of individuals knows of the "real" world, and a particularly
ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool Morpheus (Laurence
Fishburne). Morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named Neo
(Keanu Reeves), believing he is a prophesied individual who will help
them overthrow the Matrix and return peace to Earth. </P>
<P>The cast plays out this story in stylish fashion. The set design is very
dynamic, running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and
airy. The costumes, as well as the actors who wear them, add to the
roles. For instance, the manifested antagonists in the movie, a group of
"agents" created by the Matrix in its computer program, all dress in
matching Secret Servicewear; the rebel fighters, on the other hand,
dress in rich hues of leather. The casting cannot be criticized, for the
typically stoic Reeves isn't required to say much and Laurence Fishburne
gets plenty of time to be so damn cool. Supports in Carrie-Anne Moss,
Joe Pantoliano, and Hugo Weaving are all effectual. </P>
<P>One of the best comparisons to THW MATRIX is last year's science fiction
masterpiece DARK CITY, particularly if one ponders how this same premise
would've worked from a different approach. The Alex Proyas film was far
more dark and introspective, requiring a bit of thought before themes
became clear; here, the Wachowski brothers have managed to construct a
thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise. The
better picture between the two depends on the viewer, but the key to the
success of THE MATRIX is that the noise did not get in the way of the
fun. </P>
