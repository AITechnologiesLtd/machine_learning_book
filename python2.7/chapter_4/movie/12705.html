<PRE>The Horse Whisperer</PRE>
<P>More provocative than the racial lines drawn from the vastly different
responses of the O.J. Simpson verdict, are the gender lines drawn from that of
_The Horse Whisperer_.  This is a chick flick extraordinaire.  It's got women,
horses, extraordinary scenery, a sappy soundtrack, and Robert Redford.  Even
more importantly, (and significantly) it lacks a single identifiable relatable
male character.</P>
<P>Oh sure, there's Redford, but he's an icon, and unless you have a warped ego,
you can't touch him.  As strong an icon that Redford is, he is withered down
to saying "Do this" and by his quiet demeanor and strong presence, and you
_know_ it will get done.   Then there's Sam Neill, who's underused, and who
loses all credibility at the end.  Lastly, there's Chris Cooper, who I really
liked in _Lone Star_, who's reduced to saying "Yep" a lot.</P>
<P>For the women, you have Kristin Scott Thomas, in her first big role since _The
English Patient_.  Here she plays the Holly Hunter role: she's a workaholic
mother who needs to be in control over every situation, who learns to break
her city-bound roots and be taken in by nature (in more ways than one).  For
the girl, I forgot her name,  she's also drawn with the same character traits
of Natalie Portman, so much so that you'd swear that this girl had no
personality traits of her own.  She's smart, pouty, and "Hollywoodish average"
which is equivalent to saying she's an Ivory teenage girl.  And then there's
Chris Cooper's wife, played by a slightly more plump Dianne Weist, who infers
"Yep" a lot.</P>
<P>Why should I state the plot?  You see it in the characters.  Mystical cowboy,
overworked midlife crisis city-mother, pouty depressed but blooming adolescent
girl, the relatively good husband who wimps out, and the "Yep" family.  And
there's a horse, who's the best actor in the film.  Except for a very
well-executioned and haunting beginning, when the girl and her horse get into
an accident that involves snow, a steep hill, and a skidding truck, the film
then goes on auto-pilot for the rest of the time, which I wouldn't care so
much about, except that the film clocks at about three hours.</P>
<P>But what else can I say, that wouldn't get usurped by the throngs of women who
_will_ see this film?  Take my advice.  Since you will be taking your s.o. to
this, you can bargain your way so that she would have to watch two 90-minute
Jackie Chan flicks on video.</P>
