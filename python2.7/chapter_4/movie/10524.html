<P>"They Came From Within" is a rough, untidy little horror film which
marks one of the first recognized feature-length appearances by cult
Canadian writer-director David Cronenberg, last heard from for his
controversial adaptation of J.G. Ballard's "Crash" (1997).  There are
actually quite a few things in common between the two films: the
recurrent sex-equals-death theme that's so prevalent in many of his
films (especially "Rabid", "Dead Ringers", and "Videodrome"), scenes
well-paced and designed to shock the audience out of their skins, and
heavy Ballard influences (while "Crash" comes directly from a Ballard
work, "Within" appropriates a good number of settings and plot devices
from Ballard's 1973 novel, "High-Rise").</P>
<P>Watching "They Came From Within" in 1998, it really becomes evident that
Cronenberg was designing a film that's as much of an homage to the
sci-fi and horror films of the '50s as it is to the conventions he
brought to the genre himself.  It's also one of his most watchable
films, and avoids a lot of the dreariness that many of his later films,
like "Crash" and "Naked Lunch", were chided for.</P>
<P>"They Came From Within" takes place on Starliner Island, a
state-of-the-art apartment complex outside of Montreal which offers its
tenants all of the conveniences of city life, without the hassle of
other people.  From the get-go, it becomes perfectly clear that, even
without the presence of the malevolent parasites that do indeed come
from within, living in this building is a pretty warped place. 
Marriages are flat, lifeless affairs that are punctuated by hot sex with
teenage girls.  Nearly everyone in the complex is completely
dispassionate towards life in general, and from the few glimpses of the
tenants we see, it can easily be alluded that the excesses of '70s
"modern living" in the wake of '60s free love are clearly in effect. 
The security guards at the front desk even carry guns "because all the
other ones do".  The building is a closed system, stagnating on the line
between depravity and contempt.</P>
<P>The early scenes are comprised of a slideshow of the apartment's many
features, which is a fairly effective device for getting the basic
elements of the story out of the way.  In one of the film's most intense
sequences, Cronenberg juxtaposes a young couple entering the building
with a fierce struggle between an older man and a young girl in a school
uniform.  It's unclear as to why the struggle is going on, or who indeed
is the aggressor, but in the end, the man knocks the girl unconscious,
rips off her clothes, and proceeds to cut her open with a scalpel and
pour sulfuric acid into her body cavity.  He then slashes his throat and
is heard hitting the floor.  It's a really effective, masterful sequence
that equates a gender battle with freakish, clinical behavior, thus
setting the pace for the rest of the film.</P>
<P>As it turns out, the man who gutted the girl is a researcher and
biologist who was working on a new breed of parasite that could
duplicate the functions of human organs.  Hey, at least it sounds like a
plausible idea.  But of course, the parasites are really nasty creatures
that do all the things that parasites do (slowly destroy their hosts
while replicating inside of them), and do in a very gory fashion.  The
parasites also cause their hosts to engage in extremely compulsive and
violent behavior.  The girl was the test subject and got busy with
several men on Starliner Island.  Before you can say "tapeworm",
residents are exhibiting strange and dangerous mannerisms and are
vomiting blood all over the white porcelain sinks of their bathrooms. 
One character chucks up a parasite (which looks like a cross between a
penis and a turd) off the balcony, which hits an old woman's umbrella in
a particularly humorous sequence (she thinks it was a bird that bounced
off the building).  Soon the parasites are in the building's sewage
system, and making their way inside several of the people dwelling
there.  And it's up to Dr. Hobbs, the facility's medical examiner, to
try to figure out what's going on before it's too late.</P>
<P>This simple plot device gives Cronenberg the leeway to make an
exceptional low-rent horror picture and in turn exploit just about any
perversion you could think of.  With this nasty bug going around, along
with it comes numerous sexual assaults (my favorite is the woman who
looks like Divine who attacks a bell boy, saying "I'm hungry ... hungry
for love!"), excessive violence (Hobbs beats a handyman with a crowbar;
some super-gory car crashes follow), incest, some gay and lesbian
situations, and two naked women on leashes barking like dogs, which
Hobbs walks away from in a very funny sequence in a stairwell.  It's
obvious that Cronenberg is trying to put the audience on edge throughout
the film, but by erasing each step with semi-humorous situations, he's
able to desensitize viewers and push them even further.  In creating an
almost comical compulsion in the infected characters, Cronenberg also
strikes a chord of the limits of human nature, and illustrates a
phallocentric society that blurs primal behavior with regular human
interactions.  As a parasite makes its way out of a bathtub drain and
between actress Barbara Steele's legs, this parallel cannot become more
clear.</P>
<P>Cronenberg makes use of some excellent source material, using the film
to pay homage to Don Siegel's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", George
Romero's "Night of the Living Dead", and "Village of the Damned" (as
there seems to be some sort of unified mind between the infected
characters).  In fusing these films with the art-porn he created in
films like "Stereo" (1969), Cronenberg ups the ante for levels of sex
and violence in films up to that point (a process that had already begun
with the advent of the '70s hardcore porn industry, and the works of
folks like Sam Peckinpah, Tobe Hooper, and Sean Cunningham).  In keeping
with most of his films, there is not a happy ending (or maybe there is,
depending on which team you're on), but the complete downer rush of
films like "Rabid" (in which Santa Claus is blown away by National
Guardsmen) and "Videodrome" (in which the protagonist kills himself in
the end) isn't all that present here.  </P>
<P>If you can stomach the gore and aren't offended by the numerous sexual
situations in the film, I'd say peep it - it's a very good introduction
to the bleak views of human nature as presented by Cronenberg throughout
his body of work.  Hopefully this film (and many of the other gaping
holes in the American-International film library) will make its way back
onto video sometime really soon. </P>
