<P>REVIEW: Desperate Measures
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</PRE>
<P>Theirs something about watching deranged, remarkably intelligent screen
criminals that appeals to me.  John Travolta blew me away as a crazed
villain in Broken Arrow, and Dennis Hopper made an eerie, repulsive
presence in Silence of the Lams.  Now Michael Keaton (who I always swore
looks a little crazy) plays possibly the most interesting bad guy so far
this year - a bloke with an IQ of 150 and a craving to kill.</P>
<P>Pete McCabe (Keaton) is a ruthless killer locked away inside a
maximum-security prison.  He "gets the chance to kill again" without
leaving the prison, if he refuses to transfer his bone marrow to a
compatible young boy (Joseph Cross) dying of Leukemia.  He eventually
agrees to the operation, purely for a chance to escape.  When the
surgery does not succeed as the boy's cop father Frank Connor (Andy
Garcia) would like to believe, he refuses to give up on his son and is
in hot pursuit of McCabe.</P>
<P>Although there are certain to be many skeptics, Michael Keaton worked
wonders for me as the ferocious, unyielding McCabe.  Keaton himself
seems so out of place in his role that it ends up beneficial to the
film - we can't predict his next move, because it seems so improvised
that he doesn't know himself.</P>
<P>Director Martin Barbet Schroeder (Single White Female) gives a sense of
solidarity to the film.  All scenes are cleverly interlaced, so that
when the final moment occurs, it feels as if we have experienced a
memorable thrill ride - even though we find ourselves in a similar
position as we were to start with.   This is perhaps the main reason why
Desperate Measures is better than most action films - it achieves some
clever footwork - but ironically, fails to improve on some of the most
common action film flaws.</P>
<P>To start with, Andy Gracia's performance is problematic.  The actor
himself is quite tuned in to the task (and, as I mentioned before, is
very realistic), but the plot's bumbling setup means that his character
will inevitably be caught up in a careless cat-and-mouse chase.  It's
careless because we rarely get to see Garcia and Keaton on the screen
together; on most occasions McCabe hatches his schemes from a distance
which minimizes the tension, and ultimately, interest.  Perhaps
Schroeder's intention was to create suspense so that when the characters
did meet towards the end, it would be a dynamic conclusion - but this
never properly works.  Arguably the most important scene, the final
confrontation on top of a nowhere-to-run-from bridge, completes skips
whatever chance it had to make an upbeat semi-finale.  The strange thing
this, the very last scene - where McCabe chats to a hospital guard -
caps off on an almost perfect, wonderfully twisted note.</P>
<P>This is indeed a bizarre mixture: textbook action sequences with
startlingly realistic performances.  But that's it for Desperate
Measures. It's sharp and well executed in what it does, but this
unfortunately is not much - and is often very unconvincing in its
science, and reason. We are not only expected to believe that McCabe is
the only person available with a compatible bone marrow, but also his
escape using a combination of different chemicals that looks like
something from MacGyver. What's next - give the man a paper clip so he
can destroy the hospital?  I wouldn't be surprised.</P>
<P>Desperate Measures,         although sometimes frustrating to watch, is
ultimately a pleasing flick.  Michael Keaton's performance is alone
worth the price of admission, and he has successfully added himself to
my favorite "deranged criminals" list.</P>
