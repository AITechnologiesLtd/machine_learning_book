<P>   "The Governess" is writer-director Sandra Goldbacher's
British answer to Agnes Merlet's Italian-centered "Artemisia." 
While "Artemisia" deals with the first woman who made a
living by painting in Italy, "The Governess" is a (fictionalized)
interpretation of Britain's first female career photographer. 
Wielding vivid but realistic color when Ashley Rowe's camera
focuses on an almost subterranean society in London, the
lens takes on a cold, harsh conviction when it travels to the
remote and uncharitable Scottish island of Arran, a piece of
godforsaken territory that must seem alien even to its lifelong
residents.</P>
<P>   "The Governess," which takes place in the 1840's, is the
story of Rosina Da Silva (Minnie Driver), a woman of great
English patience who grows up in the Sephardic Jewish
community of London, where she enjoys a happy and
prosperous life amid a people generally shunned by the
Anglican majority.   She jokes readily with her conventional
sister.  In one scene, the two young women ponder the
possible taste of semolina, a dessert enjoyed by Gentiles,
which they agree looks somewhat like semen.  "I'd like to see
semen but not as a drink," Rosina announces to her sib, who
is shocked even that Rosina had once kissed her boyfriend
Benjamin though they are "not married."  When Rosina's
loving father is murdered, we understand that the estate is in
debt.  To support her mother and sister, Rosina must find
employment, but in an anti-Semitic Britain, what will she do? 
As she is educated, she takes the job of governess, a
prestigious profession which, along with prostitution, was one
of the few careers open to women.  But to acquire and
maintain the position, she must pose as a Gentile (not difficult
for one who aspires to the stage), and even then, she must
re-locate to a manor on the bleak Scottish island of Skye.</P>
<P>   As she puts it, writer-director Goldbacher, herself a product
of an Italian Jewish father and a mother from the Isle of Skye,
is interested primarily in taking "a character out of one really
strongly defined, close-knit, vivid culture into another world,
and look at what it would be like for her to fall in love with
someone from this other culture, while also denying her own
identity."  From the looks of things, Rosina--now known by the
name Mary Blackchurch--has quite a conflict on her hands. 
On the one hand she finds it difficult to accept the exotic
culture of non-Jews whose remoteness keeps her feeling an
outlander.  On the other hand, she enjoys her first sexual
relationship, one which both destroys her stereotype of
Gentiles as a distant people and reconfirms her expectations
of them.  Striking a feminist attitude, one which projects both
strength of character and vulnerability to hurt, Minnie Driver
gives an Oscar-caliber performance as a woman who takes a
deep interest in the traditionally masculine profession of
chemistry as she becomes involved in the experimentation of
her employer, Mr. Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson), one of
England's first photographers.  With no background in the
field, the clever Rosina impresses Cavendish by providing the
clue he needs to fix the camera's images on paper while at
the same time freeing the repressed gentleman from his
sexual limitations.  Much of the humor comes from Ms.
Driver's thoughts, which provide some narration to the tale, as
when she assesses the patronizing Mrs. Cavendish (Harriet
Walter) as a woman who "seems as though she has a lemon
up her posterior."  Florence Hoath turns in a cute
performance as Clementina, the thirteen-year-old spoiled brat
who is tamed by her governess while Tom Wilkinson shows
his flexibility this year by playing both an enraged homophobe
in "Wilde" and a tormented, obsessed scientist in "The
Governess."</P>
<P>   Urban audiences will be pleased by Goldbacher's view of
country estates, in which wealthy patrons allegedly enjoy their
lives in quiet and splendor.  Mrs. Cavendish is, after all, bored
out of her mind; their son Henry (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is
disturbed enough to be thrown out of college; and Mr.
Cavendish is oppressed by the surroundings.  Even when
returning to her cholera-embattled digs in London, Rosina--
who has lost her mother to a disease that is ravishing the city-
-realizes that there's no place like home.  Minnie Driver finally
has the role of her career; one that utilizes her considerable
acting talent and the dark Mediterranean features which have
allowed performers like Joe Mantegna (in "Homicide") and
John Turturro (in "The Truce") to achieve splendid turns as
Jews.  The sound track of Sephardic songs is mesmerizing,
as is the rest of the picture. Rated R.  Running time: 114
minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
