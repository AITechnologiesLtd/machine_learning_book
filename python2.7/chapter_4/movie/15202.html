<P>Only hours after viewing this film, horrifying images of war and
sacrifice haunt my mind.  I know these will last for days, maybe weeks.
Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan is as much about the devastation
of war as it is the nature of human sanity.  This off and on director
challenges the influence and power of contemporary cinema, pushing the
boundaries of his medium as far as he can go and stops just before
bursting into horror and trepidation.  Spielberg pulls all the right
cinematic strings, but ultimately Saving Private Ryan is more of an
experience than it is a movie.</P>
<P>The first half-hour or so is undoubtedly one of the finest pieces in
film history.  It is an excruciating scene set in Ohama Beach, Normandy,
at the time of the D-Day massacre. Cameras pans across the shoreline and
land, capturing American soldiers fighting as they try to reach the
offending troops, many gunned down from higher ground.  The tension is
almost unbearable.</P>
<P>Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is the commanding officer of a team
consisting of eight men.  They are assigned to an unusual mission: to
find and retrieve Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose mother has
received telegrams and a visit from the priest after her other three
sons were killed in action.  General George Marshall decides that Ryan
will make it home, so Miller and his crew contemplate risking their
eight lives to save one.  Rationalizing between the mission and the men
is never an easy thing for Miller to do; but this time, the mission is a
man.</P>
<P>The sheer visceral force of Saving Private Ryan is enough to evoke all
sorts of reactions, but Spielberg's intentions are more than just to
shock his audience.  With the aid of writer Robert Rodat's (Fly Away
Home) potent screenplay, he examines all aspects of war, whilst never
losing sight of developing character and setting.  This makes the battle
of governments and tactics appear as something much more individual, as
each of the eight men convey their unique demeanors and try to make
sense of a ludicrous war.</P>
<P>Even after his expert performances in Philadelphia, Forrest Gump and
Apollo 13, Tom Hanks has managed to step up a few notches.  Hanks plays
Miller deliberately restrained; he doesn't look like a glorified hero,
he looks like an ordinary man outside of his comfortable environs. Rodat
has crafted Miller as a mysterious leader who is bound by personal
motives to earn his way back to his wife, back to civilization.  "Each
person I kill makes me feel further away from home," Miller explains, as
his feelings begin to unravel.</P>
<P>Jeremy Davies is painfully realistic as Cpl. Upham, a translator who has
never been in combat before.  His harrowing portrayal of a weak willed
man is amongst the film's finest.  Tom Sizemore gives a strong
performance, as does Matt Damon, as does Edward Burns, as does Barry
Pepper.  The entire cast is electric.</P>
<P>Even more impressive than the performances is the stark cinematography
by Janusz Kaminski (Schindler's List, The Lost World) and the tight
direction from Spielberg.  In many scenes hand held cameras were used to
great effect, and they stylize the film with a mixture of clarity and
radiate an overall look of uniqueness.  Saving Private Ryan's visual
overture is fast paced and convincing, as if the events on screen were
as realistic as the war itself.</P>
<P>Deliberately more sentimental that Spielberg's other World War II
masterpiece Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan is actually an epic
movie, packaged as very much an American flick by the identical opening
and closing images - an US flag waving in the wind.  As one of the great
directors of our time, Steven Spielberg has re-assured us that a picture
can tell a thousand words, and it is those pictures of war and sacrifice
that will continue to lurk in my mind.  Saving Private Ryan almost
beckons us not to label it as a film.  It's an experience.</P>
