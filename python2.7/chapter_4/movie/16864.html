<PRE>                  A REVIEW OF "BARTON FINK"

<P>Captivated fans of the Oscar-winning "Fargo" would be remiss if
they didn't rent a 1991 beauty called "Barton Fink". Directed by
Joel Coen, produced by his brother Ethan, and written by both of
them, this '91 gem epitomizes the fresh, original style and
substance that movies can showcase.</P>
<P>Taking a delicious stab at the Hollywood film industry, the Coens
seem to be parodying vintage Hollywood or even Billy Wilder's
masterpiece, "Sunset Blvd."! Featuring superior set design,
fantastic cinematography, meticulous detail, and great acting,
this picture (set in 1941) sets a high standard of intelligence
and manages to keep the two-hour story at that level throughout.
Some critics might sniff at the bizarre plot-turns--and they
certainly are weird--but those twists add flavour, not blandness.</P>
<P>John Turturro (a Coen regular) plays Barton Fink, a New York
playwright hired by Capital Pictures to pen a wrestling script.
Moving to a seedy hotel in Los Angeles, Fink sets out to write
the story. He receives both beratings and praises from the
producer (Michael Lerner in a Oscar-nominated supporting
performance) while trying to find that all-important
'inspiration'. It seems that he has a rough case of writer's
block and whenever he seems ready to put something on paper, he's
interrupted by his neighbour Charlie Meadows (John Goodman).
However, don't believe what you see because this film is full of
metaphors. Let's just say that Goodman is well-cast as a
buffoonish travelling salesman.</P>
<P>In his travails, Fink also "meets" a revered writer, W.P. Mayhew,
(John Mahoney) and his wife, Audrey (Judy Davis). Mayhew has
become a pathetic souse and Audrey is the true author of many of
her husband's creations. Fink invites Audrey to his dilapidated
hotel room to work on his "failing" script. From this point on,
things take that weird turn I mentioned above. If there is a
weakness to this movie, it would have to be that things become a
little crazy. Meadows is revealed as serial killer "Madman Muntz"
and takes the script to strange new places. I'm going to stop
giving away the story though. This is one of those, "make of it
what you will" sort of films, where not everything is as it
seems.</P>
<P>Contained within are some of the niftiest twists, smartest jokes,
and juiciest plot lines shown in this decade. A technical
delight, "Barton Fink" has every sort of efficient use of
lighting, camera angles, editing, and the trademark Coen
attention to detail. In the climax, the film combines special
effects, long camera lenses, and great dialogue. A fine subtlety
was the highway-length hotel hallway with faint wind sounds
creeping below. No fancy explosions or computer graphics need
apply here. "Barton Fink" proves that a good script can still be
written in Tinseltown.</P>
<P>After the first viewing, some of the material whooshed over my
head, but the gist of the tale brilliantly parodies film-making,
angst-ridden (Woody Allen-ish) writers, and the strange decade of
the '40s. With solid, sometimes snickeringly sensational
supporting performances by Steve Buscemi, Jon Polito, Richard
Portnow, and Christopher Murney, this is a dead-on lampoon.
Portnow and Murney portray detectives with the utmost of
silliness in their parody of the '40s film noir/cop movie genre.
Of course, Michael Lerner is the scene-stealer and he was
nominated for an Academy Award for his fine work.</P>
<P>The Coen brothers have done two great films in their
careers--"Fargo" and the vastly underrated "Miller's Crossing".
"Barton Fink" is a shade below that level, but only a shade. This
is the kind of film that doesn't sit well with the
Godzilla-loving movie-going public in the late '90s, but REAL
movie fans will discover a gem in this piece of work. Rent this
film soon and enter Barton's living hell.</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--John Turturro appeared in a small, hilarious role
in 1998's "The Big Lebowski" as Jesus the flamboyant bowler. The
Coen brothers use Turturro, Goodman, Buscemi, and others quite
regularly--a rare sort of loyalty in Hollywood today.</P>
<PRE>This film gets a 9/10.
It also ranks #89 on My 100 Favourite Films list.</PRE>
