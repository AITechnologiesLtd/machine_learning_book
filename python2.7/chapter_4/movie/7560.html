<P>     Penises are being severed left and right.  Is Lorena Bobbit on the
loose?  No, the crimes are actually being committed by the killer
condoms, nasty little creatures that look like genuine prophylactics,
but, when applied, open wide and chomp down on whatever happens to be
between their teeth (I will refrain from making all sorts of off-color,
completely obvious jokes at this time).  This sort of activity is
guaranteed to put a damper on safe sex.</P>
<P>     At the Hotel Quickie in New York City, strange things have been
happening.  Men and women go in, but the men come out missing a critical
part of their anatomy.  The cops, led by the improbably-named Detective
Macaroni (Udo Samel), are called in to investigate.  Macaroni, who is
gay and proud of it, discovers that staking out the Quickie offers a few
fringe benefits, but, when he and a boy-toy are getting down to business
in one of the rent-for-an-hour rooms, Macaroni learns firsthand what has
been causing all the damage.  Fortunately for him, he zigs at the right
moment, and only loses a testicle.  After recovering from his wound, he
mounts an all-out crusade against the killer condoms -- only no one
believes his story.  That is, until a Presidential Candidate (who
becomes known as "Dickless Dick") has a similar encounter.</P>
<P>     Is KILLER CONDOM campy?  Of course, and the film, which is based on
a comic book, is intended to be so from the first frame.  The problem
is, this is basically a one-joke movie, and the effectiveness of that
joke wears off pretty quickly as the penis count mounts.  Almost all of
the laughs happen during the first fifteen minutes; after that, it's a
long, often-tedious run to the end credits.  There are several
entertaining, but not terribly original parodies (hard-boiled cop
stories, JAWS, and PSYCHO), but all these offer is a moment's diversion.</P>
<P>     One of the most unintentionally amusing aspects of the film is its
choice of language.  The entire film takes place in New York City, yet
everyone is speaking German.  While I'm sure this might seem quite
natural to the German audience for which the movie was made, it's pretty
funny for an American.  Of course, Hollywood has been doing a similar
thing for decades.  How many movies have been filmed in foreign
countries where all of the natives amazingly speak English, albeit with
a very bad accent?</P>
<P>     In the midst of the lunacy, KILLER CONDOM delivers an anti-
homophobic message with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer applied to a
glass window.  Humor can be an effective tool for highlighting bigotry
and social injustice, but it needs to be a little better thought out
than what's presented here.  The "Sermon on the Mount" at the end is too
much even for an over-the-top motion picture of this sort. </P>
<P>     Of some interest to U.S. viewers of KILLER CONDOM is how the German
film makers see American society.  During the movie, we are presented
with numerous examples of a cynical perspective of American culture,
morals, and, most notably, politics (although perhaps no more scathing
than that of some American satirists).  Everything is a stereotype, of
course, but these attitudes are instructive in illustrating how American
society can appear to those on the outside looking in.</P>
<P>     As expected, the killer condoms represent the silliest aspect of
the whole production.  Despite being designed by H. R. Giger (who
created the look for the creature in ALIEN), the tiny creatures have not
been effectively realized by the special effects team, and, as a result,
look rather cheesy.  Ultimately, although KILLER CONDOM is fairly gory,
unbelievably silly, and unmistakably outrageous, it's not as enjoyable
as it should be.  There's no doubt, however, that it belongs in the "so
bad that it's good" category and has the potential to amass a cult
following.</P>
