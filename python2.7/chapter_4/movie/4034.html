                       A film review by Bryant Frazer

<P>Written and Directed by Anthony Waller
Edited by Peter R. Adam
Cinematography by Egon Werdin

Starring Marina Sudina, Fay Ripley, Evan Richards, and Oleg Jankowskij.
Russia/Germany/Great Britain 1995</P>
<P>     MUTE WITNESS is really two movies in one. The first half is a
creepy, nearly hallucinatory thriller with style to burn and camera
moves torn from Brian DePalma's playbook. The second half is a comic
action picture, with quick bursts of violence perforating the corkscrew
plot and ugly Americans tearing up the roads of Moscow. The switch-over
is disconcerting until you get into the mood of the film.
Writer/director Anthony Waller has created a skillful homage to scary
movies, and if the whole thing winds up off-balance, it's probably
because he's still a little loopy from years of intoxication on pseudo-
political thrillers and cheap slasher films. You can smell it on his
breath, and this film is his way of passing you the bottle.</P>
<P>     Russian actress Marina Sudina stars as Billy Hughes, the
witness of the title. She's an American make-up effects artist shooting
a dreadful horror picture on the cheap in Moscow with her sister Karen
(Fay Ripley) and an American B-movie director, Andy (Evan Richards).
She can't speak, which makes her situation all the more precarious when
she's locked into the old film studio after dark--she resorts to
telephoning her friends and tapping urgently on the phone receiver to
try and get their attention.  While she's trying to find help, Billy
stumbles stumbles across a threesome (the cameraman and an actor from
Andy's film, along with an unknown woman) who are apparently shooting a
porn flick on the sly. But as Billy watches from the shadows, the movie
turns into a snuff film--the woman is brutally murdered at the end of
the scene.</P>
<P>     As Billy runs away, she's plunged into a cat and mouse game
with the two men. Chased through hallways, stairwells, and even an
elevator shaft, she searches for a way out of the building in a
breathless series of set pieces that emphasize her hopeless physical
disadvantage against the larger men. MUTE WITNESS has a keen sense of
geography, and the camera movement is choreographed against the
positions of the actors to sustain a remarkable cinematic tension.
Sudina has a keen sense of her character, too, playing Billy as
determined but terrified, smart but vulnerable. Her performance, along
with Waller's sure, straightforward direction, render some of the
script's more obvious implausibilities irrelevant in favor of sharp
audience identification with Billy. And when the veracity of what she
saw is called into question--was the "murder" she witnessed really
just a clever special effect?--the audience, too, is forced to
reconsider its own experience of the murder on screen.</P>
<P>     This one was a labor of love, and it shows. The film's history
dates back at least to 1985, when Waller, then a director and editor of
movie trailers and music videos, filmed the scene featuring Sir Alec
Guinness as "The Reaper." Principal photography finally began in
October of 1993, and was subject to bad weather and delays. MUTE
WITNESS was originally written to take place in Chicago, but was moved
to Moscow, partly for economic reasons. The relocation works wonders
for the story, adding a layer of isolation for both the American
characters in the film, and for the (primarily English speaking)
audience watching it. The fairly extensive Russian dialogue is not
translated, and we're as much at a loss to understand those
communications as Billy is to make her own meaning clear. An excellent
score, composed and recorded in Russia by Wilbert Hirsch, adds texture
to the largely wordless environment, underscoring Billy's silent
screams with piercing crescendos. And the ready-made movie environment
of the Mosfilm studios is a wonderful backdrop for some virtuosi
filmmaking.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, too many of those truly exciting moments are
crammed into the first segment of the film, and the remainder dwells a
bit heavily on the expected unexpected plot twists and a missing item
that bears no relation at all to what's important in the
film--Hitchcock would call that a MacGuffin, and its presence is just
one of the ways that MUTE WITNESS makes reference to its own genre.
Still, a bogus gimmick is a bogus gimmick, and Waller isn't quite
Hitchcock.  Even worse is Waller's decision to bring Karen and Andy
back into the picture as ineffectual comic relief. It's probably part
of an efficient joke about bumbling young American directors working
abroad, but Andy's presence is a little more irritating than it should
be.</P>
<P>     But if MUTE WITNESS ultimately disappoints, it's because it
starts running too fast and just can't keep up the pace.  Joyously
manipulative and happily morbid, the movie's style might be closest to
Danny Boyle's downbeat SHALLOW GRAVE or Kenneth Branagh's even more
exuberant DEAD AGAIN (it's better than the former, but not up to the
high standards of the latter). Still, MUTE WITNESS is a hard-won battle
from a filmmaker who has already doubtless started looking for ways to
top himself.  When Waller figures out how to apply this giddy level of
craft to a project that doesn't meander and muck about in the trappings
of its own genre, it should certainly be something to see.</P>
