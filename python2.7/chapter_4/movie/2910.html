<PRE>"Genuine dead people!"
             - Sheen to Kinski</PRE>
<P>     QUIZ SHOW's Christopher McDonald in a blond wig as a bad-guy!?
That's just one of the guilty pleasures of TERMINAL VELOCITY, a
harmless thriller starring Charlie Sheen as a thinks-with-his-ahem
skydiving instructor who gets wind of a conspiracy after his student
(Kinski) plays Wiley Coyote and lives.  Though slower than SPEED, the
last action sleeper, TERMINAL VELOCITY enough falling bodies and
semi-spectacular stunts to make this trip (almost) worth taking.</P>
<P>     The story is the weakest link, a silly mix of international
intrigue and airborne action.  David Twohy's script has more
liabilities than U.S. Air, but that doesn't deter director Deran
Sarafain.  He thinks he's Renny Harlin and pulls out all the stops,
from a gonzo mother-of-all-jumps jump to a gag stolen from DIE HARD 2.</P>
<P>     The scowling Sheen is always easy to watch, but his female co-star
could use some practice in self-parody.  The Arizona locales are good,
too.  Complementing the mise en scene are a windmill farm and a nifty
jet junkyard.  Too bad the plot poops so soon.  And what's with that
awful music direction?  Imitation Herrman and heavy-metal don't mix.</P>
<PRE>Next up:  Wesley Snipes in DROP ZONE.</PRE>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  Better than THE CHASE, but still several thousand feet 
              below the skyjacking sequence in CLIFFHANGER. </PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
