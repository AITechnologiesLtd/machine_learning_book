<P>Take the man who produced GOODFELLAS (9/10), give him a story based in truth
written by Dr. Oliver Sacks (entitled "To see and not see"), the man
portrayed by Robin Williams in AWAKENINGS, slap in Quentin Tarantino's
ex-chum, Mira Sorvino, and one of the many Batmen we've had over the past
decade, Val Kilmer, and you've got yourself a perfect recipe for a romantic
melodrama, right? Well, not exactly, but somehow, the movie works!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Blind massage therapist falls in love with an architect from New York, and
vice-versa. She discovers an alternative surgery for him that would allow
him to regain his sight, which he lost at the age of one. Visual
transformation complete, the duo find themselves drifting apart as the
hardships of his newfound sight prove difficult. In the end, they must look
within themselves to figure out what they truly want out of life.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Effective sappy film, runs slow at first, but eventually draws you in with
the solid performances by its leads, an interesting and truthful premise,
and its heartfelt epilogue, which teaches us never to lose sight of what is
most important to us. This is one of the few films that actually had me
buying the sap that it was preaching. It's longer than it should be, but it
does take the time to create a few believable characters, and develop a real
relationship between two people who truly want to be with one another. It
sure had me root-root-rooting for the home team! The cinematography of the
film was also real sweet, with New York in the winter months always looking
so fine. Add to that, the hockey references (I love hockey), a few cute
one-liners, and a couple of unexpected turns, and you've got yourself one of
the few recent romantic dramas to score.</P>
<P>The actors in this picture also made a big difference, with each one
bringing their own truth to their characters. Mira Sorvino was good, and not
overly tearful like the women from STEPMOM (6/10). Val Kilmer, who is
incidentally getting skankier by the picture, also came through as the blind
guy with the heart of gold. And guess who also makes an appearance? Remember
the flight instructor from 1986's TOP GUN (7/10)? That's right, Kelly
McGillis is back and she hasn't aged like the wine that is fine. She is also
very good as the older sister, who essentially raised Kilmer's character
from childhood. I think the relationship between the loving couple could
have used a little more spice, but other than that, this film did manage to
"gulp me up" during its money scenes, and in my book of colours, that's a
definite sign of an effective character drama.</P>
<P>All in all, a nice romantic tale to enjoy with your better half, especially
if you're in the doghouse, because this movie will surely bring out the
appreciation of the most important aspects of your relationship. It's a tad
slow and about twenty minutes too long, but it does manage to develop some
rich characters, around a fascinating premise, and dash in a couple of
romantic and enlightening moments all the while.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film is based on a real-life couple who are currently married and
living in Ohio.
It was during the week of this film's release, that actor Nathan Lane (real
name: Joe Lane), who plays the character of Dr. Phil Webster in this film,
"came out" in a publication of "The Advocate". For the first time, he
publicly announced that he was gay. He joins fellow actors Rupert Everett,
Nigel Hawthorne and Ian McKellen in that respect (among many other I am
sure.)
It was in January 1999, that Val Kilmer claimed that his old friend Kevin
Spacey, whom he studied with at Julliard, still owed Kilmer's father,
Eugene, $18,000, from a friendly loan that he took out from the latter, in
1979, in order for him to finish up his education at the prestigious acting
school. He never did finish his tutelage at the school, but did claim to
have paid pop Kilmer back $1000, which he claims was closer to the correct
amount of the loan. Kilmer claims that he will not speak to the actor until
his debt to his father is fully restored. Mind you, Kilmer's father passed
away in the early '90s, so he says that he's "gonna have to have Spacey pay
for the college education of my children." Oooh, what fun in Hollywood! Stay
tuned.
During the hockey game scene, you can clearly see the character of Austin
Powers, from AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY (7/10) on the giant
scoreboard over the ice.
Irwin Winkler is good friends with actor Robert DeNiro. DeNiro's daughter
Drena plays the character of Caroline in this film. Winkler produced ROCKY
(8/10), for which he won an Oscar,
This film was originally titled SIGHT UNSEEN.
When in Key West, Florida, be sure to stop by a restaurant named "Kelly's",
owned by the actress of the same name, Kelly McGillis.
The real Dr. Oliver Sacks also makes an appearance in this film as a doctor
at the news conference.</P>
