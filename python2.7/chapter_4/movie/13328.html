<P>All icing, no cake. That pretty much sums up "Lethal Weapon 4." Having 
decided that the appeal of the buddy cop franchise was action, jokes and 
the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, the powers that be 
apparently decided to discard such antiquated elements as character 
development and coherent plotting, opting instead to create a film of 
virtually nothing but action, jokes and the chemistry between Gibson and 
Glover. And so we have "Lethal Weapon 4," a 127 minute stunt and shtick 
extravaganza. </P>
<P>In the stunt department, a car crashes into a building, drives through, 
crashes out the other side and continues pursuing the bad guys. Very cool.
 Mel's stunt double climbs from vehicle to vehicle during a high speed 
freeway chase. Jet Li moves quite adroitly while kicking the crap out of 
everybody. There's lots and lots of big explosions too, along with the 
series' trademark sadism.</P>
<P>Moving on to the shtick, Mel plays lots of wacky practical jokes on his 
partner and best friend Danny. He gets him to dance in his underwear to 
"distract" a lunatic. Later, he repeatedly fastens newspaper photos of 
Danny in his underwear to the cubicle walls in the police station. He 
tricks Danny into believing that Chris Rock is gay and infatuated with 
him. And so on.</P>
<P>In-between the jokes and fights, there's a couple of pregnancies thrown 
in, along with a nominal, extremely murky plot about Chinese people doing 
bad things. The film's recurring theme is family, which is nice.</P>
<P>It's all very fast-paced and pretty entertaining on its own terms, but my 
thoughts kept drifting back to the first "Lethal Weapon." I remembered 
the agony of that scene where Gibson, as the suicidal Martin Riggs, sat 
quivering with the barrel of a gun in his mouth, crying tears of 
frustration when he couldn't pull the trigger. I remembered Danny Glover, 
as quintessential family man Roger Murtaugh, nursing his partner through 
his anguish, displaying remarkable nobility and compassion. Sure, "Lethal 
Weapon" was often cheesy and lurid, but I cared about those men.</P>
<P>Watching the fourth installment of the series, I realized how much I 
missed Riggs and Murtaugh, back when they were people instead of the Two 
Stooges. Sure, I laughed at a lot of Gibson's puns and wisecracks, but 
missed the man behind the jokes. With Danny Glover, witnessing his 
sputtering straight man bit actually became embarrassing. At what point 
in the series was it decided that Murtaugh didn't need his dignity 
anymore?</P>
<P>As for the rest of the cast, aside from an absurd, but nifty fight scene, 
Rene Russo is relegated to the background, although she gets more screen 
time than the rest of the womenfolk. Joe Pesci returns as the 
extraordinarily irritating Leo Getz, punctuating his constant yammering 
with his "Okay! Okay!" catch phrase. As if that wasn't annoying enough, 
Chris Rock joins the proceedings with his own shrill brand of fingernails-
on-the-blackboard verbal torture. The nadir of the film comes during a 
scene where Rock and Pesci exchange rapid fire banalities. I swear to God,
 if I'd had an Uzi at that moment I would have happily riddled the screen 
with bullets.</P>
<P>Thankfully, "Lethal Weapon 4" wraps up with a genuinely warm, family 
scrapbook scene that almost makes everything else forgivable. It's as if 
the cast was saying "Folks, we're doing this for the last time. We know 
it's all ridiculous, but we're just having fun and we hope that you had 
some too." And, to a certain extent, I did. But it's hard to watch 
talented performers throw plot, character development, logic and 
credibility away in favor of playing caricatures in a high-octane free-
for-all. I guess I'm just getting too old for this shit.</P>
