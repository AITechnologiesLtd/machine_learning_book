<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Since "Scream" revived the teenage horror genre, there hasn't been much
variation on its successful formula. Films like "I Know What You Did Last
Summer" and "Urban Legend" were largely direct knock-offs, lacking the
creative spark to try something different. Now comes the latest
youth-oriented thriller, "Final Destination", as usual sporting an
inexperienced cast culled from other recent movies and TV shows popular
with its target audience. But while the trappings of "Final Destination"
may seem familiar, it is not just another "Scream" wannabe -- its
screenplay is original, and more importantly does not speak down to its
audience. While by no means a movie for intellectuals, "Final  
Destination" is nonetheless possessed of an intelligence which I hope is
not lost on future scary movies.</P>
<P>As the film opens, a group of teenagers is boarding Flight 180 from JFK
Airport for a class trip to Paris. One student, Alex Browning (Devon 
Sawa), falls asleep before takeoff and has a dream in which the craft
explodes in midair, killing everyone on board. Convinced he has 
experienced a precognitive vision, Alex freaks out, trying to warn
everyone off the plane. He ends up fighting with jock Carter Hogan (Kerr
Smith, miles away from his character on "Dawson's Creek") and this results
in several of them being kicked off: Alex, Carter, Alex's best friend Tod
(Chad E Donella), Carter's girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), nebbish
Billy (Seann William Scott), loner Clear (Ali Larter), and their teacher
Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke). Except for Clear, they all think Alex is
overreacting to a nightmare -- until moments later when, in a terrific
scene of building horror and anticipation, the plane does indeed blow up.</P>
<P>Alex is treated like a pariah thereafter. Some people (including the FBI)
believe he may be responsible for the explosion, while others just fear
him because they think he can see the future. But then, one by one, the
survivors of Flight 180 start to die under mysterious and highly 
improbable circumstances, and Alex keeps getting premonitions. He slowly
comes to believe that he and the others were not meant to survive the
explosion, and now Death is coming back to claim them. Having cheated
Death once, can he and the others do so again?</P>
<P>"Final Destination" is essentially composed of two types of scenes: scenes
where people die, and scenes where people talk about death. The former
might be, in a perverse way, the more enjoyable -- the movie boasts some
impressively elaborate ways of killing off its cast, some of them worthy
of Rube Goldman -- but it is the latter which sets "Final Destination"
apart. The script, by Glen Morgan and James Wong (of "The X-Files" fame)
and Jeffrey Reddick, does a good job of considering how death affects
people, and how young people in particular think about death. There's the
stereotypical attitude that teens think they're immortal, of course
(embodied in Carter), but also much discourse about fate and free choice.
What if the things we do today set in motion the events which will cause
our death years down the road? asks Alex. It is a question with deep
implications indeed.</P>
<P>But as much as "Final Destination" throws in touches of originality, in
too many ways it is also very predictable. The identities of those who die
and those who survive (or do they?) are not hard to guess, and as a
result the middle portion of the film is somewhat lacking in suspense. We
know people are going to die, we can pretty much guess who's going to die,
so we end up marking time until the next inventive death sequence. It's
not helped that almost every death is presaged by not just one but several
occurrences: gusts of chill wind, strange shadows, the strains of
"Rocky Mountain High" by the late John Denver ("He died in a plane crash,"
Alex notes early on). These touches added style to the killings the first
couple of times around, but by the end of the movie had been overused to
the point of farce.</P>
<P>The script is also hampered by a few gaps in logic. For example, after the
plane explosion, more than a month passes before any of the survivors is
killed, and then the deaths come in a rush. A similar stretch of time
passes later in the film. Did the Grim Reaper have to wait until his
calendar freed up? Also, we never learn why Alex has been gifted with
these visions, and while the answer to that question is not really
essential, I think some indication would not have been unwarranted. All
this said, "Final Destination" makes up for some of these imperfections by
eschewing the traditional Hollywood ending for something much darker and
more surprising -- albeit one that is really inevitable, in the context of
the movie. The writers deserve praise for sticking to their guns, instead
of tacking on a more palatable ending which would have only diminished the
picture as a whole.</P>
<P>The cast of "Final Destination" is generally solid, with Ali Larter
notable as the enigmatic Clear. Sawa spends a little too much time looking
wide-eyed and harried, but altogether does a good job in the lead role.
The direction, by co-writer Wong, is accomplished, developing the
atmosphere of paranoia without going overboard. Indeed, "Final
Destination" is a movie which is well aware of its more ludicrous
elements, and acknowledges them rather than trying to justify them --
witness a hilarious cameo by Tony Todd as a mortician, for instance.</P>
<P>"Final Destination" is not a great film, but as flawed as it is, it tries
valiantly to rise above the conventions of the thriller genre, to be more
than just another horror movie for teens. It doesn't just tell a story,
but tries to tell a story about something, and I can only hope that other
filmmakers follow its lead. "Final Destination" demonstrates that a movie
-- even a scary movie -- can have meaning, and still be fun.</P>
