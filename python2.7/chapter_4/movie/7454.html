<P>What if Lloyd Dobler from "Say Anything" lost his nerve, ran out on Diane,
and became a hit man instead? That's just one of many ways to look at this
very complex, very funny movie. The first time I heard a critic pan a film
because "the script doesn't know what it wants to be" was in reference to
Joe Dante's delicious "Gremlins", and since then I have always translated
that particular criticism as "I don't know how to pigeon-hole this movie
and against which boilerplate genre-standards I should compare it".
Stepping off from a premise that would not have been out of place in a
conversation from "The Player": "a professional assassin (John Cusack)
goes to his ten-year high school reunion", Grosse Pointe Blank makes
non-chalant transitions from Action Comedy (Grocer (Aykroyd) shouting
"Workers of the world, unite!" as he plugs two gunmen who interrupt his
attempt to recruit Martin Blank (Cusack) into his nascent Assassin's
Guild) to Romantic Comedy (Debi (Driver) forcing Blank into an on-air
interrogation when he drops by her radio station to apologize for standing
her up at the prom ten years previously) to Action Thriller (Blank in a
surprisingly well-choreographed fight scene when a Basque mercenary
surprises him searching his old locker for that joint that's still there
after ten years) to Shameless Nostalgia (Blank discovering, to his
delight, that his old English teacher still has the advantage over him, a
professional killer) to Suburban Angst (Blank in a not-brief-enough visit
with his lithium-ridden mother, followed by a libation of Glenlivet at his
father's grave) to Understated Ironic Satire (Blank leaving solipsistic
rationalizations on the answering machine of Dr. Oatman (Arkin), a
therapist whom he doesn't pay but instead extorts into weekly
confessionals) to Existential Maunderings (Blank finally explaining to
Debi (and to us) how he came to the point where killing for money was
acceptable (and enjoyable)). </P>
<P>All these shifts cannot help but break any mood that might have been
established, but I suspect director George Armitage accepted them (had the
film been by Lynch, they would have been deliberate (and tiresome)) as
necessary to showing the world of fractured relationships Blank lives
with. Dramatic manifestations of high school reunions have always featured
the theme of the gap between expectations and reality, and attempts to
contrive fictions to fill that gap. Unlike Romy & Michele, however, Blank
is well-practiced in self-examination and justifying himself, whether to
his secretary Marcella, his colleague Grocer, his "therapist" Oatman, or
to himself. I was quite bemused to note that with no important character
back in Grosse Pointe (nor with many unimportant ones) does Blank
embellish or obscure his personal history of the past ten years; he tells
them he is a contract killer, but no one takes him at his word.
Nevertheless, even though he is presented with example after absurd
example of fellow "Pointers" failing to live up to their expectations,
Blank still feels the sting of having stood Debi up, and he realizes that
neither the cynicism of his last ten years nor the disillusionment to
which he has returned relieves him of his obligation to make amends for
his original sin (sic). </P>
<P>That it requires plot developments ranging from the treacly to the
homicidal for Blank to make this realization might say something about the
age demographic the film hopes to snare with its nostalgic trappings. I'm
always the first to sneer at age-based generalizations (read: market
strategies), but I'm not at all confident that my wholesale acceptance of
Blank's character, dialogue, and behavior has nothing to do with being
from the Class of 1986 myself (although I still didn't recognize half the
songs in the soundtrack). I didn't go to my ten-year high school reunion.
Had I known that Martin Blank would have been there, I still wouldn't have
gone because guys like Blank never talked to me anyway. </P>
