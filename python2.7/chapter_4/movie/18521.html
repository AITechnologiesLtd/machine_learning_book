<PRE>Review of Cruel Intentions
Written & Directed By: Roger Kumble
Rating: * out of ****</PRE>
<P>        I never understood what the cliché "Hell on Earth" truly meant
until very recently. I've just never experienced anything in my life
which was so terrifying, so horrible, so monstrously deplorable that
it justified being termed as "Hell on Earth". After all, I've never
been to war, I've never been the victim of any violent crime, I've
never really been broken hearted, and I've never been audited; so I
really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said
that something was "Hell on Earth"  </P>
<PRE>        Then I saw Cruel Intentions.</PRE>
<P>        In a perfect world, I would be in charge of all the movie
studios. The very first thing I'd do in this perfect world, would be
to take every Hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in
contemporary America with a 20-something cast playing teenagers and
featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from MTV, and throw them in
jail. But it wouldn't just be your average jail, not even a maximum
security installation. I'd have these producers (and everyone else
involved in the production of these films) put in front of a war
crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against
humanity.</P>
<P>        Now you're probably thinking to yourself: "Is this really how
bad Cruel Intentions is?"</P>
<P>        The answer is no. It's actually much worse. Watching the cast
of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through Roger
Kumble's awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing
yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open
wound. And then pouring acid on the salt. I don't know if Kumble was
trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where Marci
Greenbaum (Tara Reid) whines about having nude photos of her posted on
the internet, but the only emotion I felt was sheer boredom.</P>
<P>        From that opening scene, where boring actor Ryan Phillippe
tries to seduce TV actress Swoosie Kurtz, to the conclusion which I
don't remember because I had practically fallen asleep; Cruel
Intentions is truly "Hell on Earth," right up there with war and tax
audits.</P>
