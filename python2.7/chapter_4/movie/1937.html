<P>     David Greenhill (Don Johnson) is about to go on trial for the
murder of his rich socialite wife.  To prepare his defense, he solicits
one of the best young female lawyers in the country, Jennifer Haines
(Rebecca DeMornay).  After an initial bout of reluctance, Jennifer
decides to take the case--she realizes that David is a womanizer and
manipulator, but she believes him to be innocent ("People who are
guilty are rarely this blunt," she confesses) and sees his case as a
challenge.  However, from the moment she accepts him as a client, she
finds herself in over her head as David, obviously not possessing the
most stable of personalities, begins to toy with her personal life--
and her mind.</P>
<P>     Trials and questions of guilt and innocence are nothing new, but
GUILTY AS SIN has a few twists that give this film a different slant
than many other courtroom thriller/dramas.  Limited though it is, the
strength of this picture lies not in a tense verbal jousting match
between prosecuting and defense attorneys, because there isn't one, nor
is it to be found in the "did he do it/didn't he" theme, since the
truth is revealed relatively early.  Instead, the centerpiece is the
cat-and-mouse game played between Jennifer and David as the two twist
and manipulate circumstances, people, and each other.  Much of the
story, while admittedly overplotted, is cleverly-conceived and fun to
watch.  That's what makes the ending such a colossal disappointment.</P>
<P>     Often, the final act of a film has little impact on the overall
quality of the product.  There are a number of good films that have
weak conclusions, and a few horrible movies that surprise with
unexpectedly-solid wrap-ups.  GUILTY AS SIN, however, is an example of
how an ending can ruin the entire picture.  Without revealing anything
plot-wise, let me simply state the final moments lead to an inept and
feeble letdown.  Everything that was carefully developed during the
first ninety-five minutes is thrown away in the last ten.  It's almost
as if someone different was brought in to do the writing.  What's worse
is that it's easy to construct scenarios that would have made a fitting
conclusion to an otherwise-intriguing and entertaining film.</P>
<P>     While the end of GUILTY AS SIN is by far the film's most grievous
fault, it is by no means the only sour point.  Some of the dialogue
could have used a re-write or two.  There are a number of lines that
are unintentionally funny, and this is a bad sign for a movie trying to
develop tension.  There's also a truly horrible performance given by
Stephen Lang, who fails to infuse his Phil Garson (Jennifer's lover)
with anything remotely resembling humanity.  Fortunately, he doesn't
have a large role.</P>
<P>     Rebecca DeMornay is inconsistent.  There are scenes when she does
an excellent job, but an equal number when she is amateurish, stilted,
or unconvincing.  She's at her best playing someone of cool, ruthless
intelligence and at her worst attempting to give an impression of
vulnerability.  Strong emotion appears to be something that she has
difficulty portraying effectively.</P>
<P>     Don Johnson, on the other hand, is wildly charismatic as David
Greenhill.  He plays the role to the hilt, pulling out all the stops
and more than occasionally overacting.  What he does is perfect for the
movie, and immensely fun to watch (it also helps to erase the memory of
an execrable performance in Born Yesterday).  There aren't many movies
when I find myself sympathizing with the villain, but this is among the
exceptions, Johnson's acting putting me solidly in Greenhill's corner.
Oddly enough, another recent example of this occurred when I rooted for
DeMornay's Paige in THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE.</P>
<P>     Comparisons can be made to JAGGED EDGE, but most of the
similarities are superficial.  Aside from EDGE being a better-crafted
piece of entertainment, there's a lot to differentiate the two.  While
it's true that Jack Warden's character in GUILTY AS SIN is uncannily
like Robert Loggia's in EDGE, and that in both films there's a strange
attraction between the female lawyer and a client that she believes to
be innocent, each of the movies focuses on something different.  GUILTY
AS SIN pushes Greenhill's guilt or innocence into the background, along
with his trial, to zero in on his bizarre and weirdly fascinating
relationship with Jennifer.</P>
<P>     GUILTY AS SIN will not win any awards for realism, but as escapism
it's fine--until the ending, that is.  It's disappointing and amazing
how a few ill-conceived pages of script can shatter what might
otherwise have been a shallow-but-enjoyable thriller.  What a waste.</P>
