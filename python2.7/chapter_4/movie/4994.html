<P>     A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE is muddled to the point of 
tedium.  The screenplay is credited to four writers, and its unevenness 
argues that none of them were on the same wavelength.  Subplots start 
but never finish, characters come and go, and even the main storyline 
can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a morality play, or a 
thriller.  Lead actor Martin Lawrence (in his directorial debut) has a 
degree of screen presence, but not even his charisma can rescue this 
cliched film from sliding into oblivion.</P>
<P>     Darnell (Lawrence) is the kind of character who it's easy to 
dislike.  He's a classic womanizer -- the kind of man who keeps a stream 
of girlfriends waiting at the other end of the phone for his call.  For 
Darnell, the harder a woman is to get, the more she entices him.  So 
when Brandi (Lynn Whitfield), a wealthy real estate agent, turns her 
nose up at his come-ons, Darnell goes after her with the tenacity of a 
pit bull.  Employing every trick in his book -- flowers, a hired limo, 
classy presents, and even a horseback riding excursion -- he sets out on 
a coldly-plotted plan of seduction.  Eventually, he succeeds, but he 
gets more than he bargained for.  When he tries to break things off with 
Brandi to prove his affection for the high school sweetheart who has 
come back to town (Regina King), he discovers that Brandi isn't willing 
to let him go.  She'll try anything, including bodily harm, to keep him.</P>
<P>     Mix Eddie Murphy's BOOMERANG with FATAL ATTRACTION, and you get an 
idea how confused A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE is.  Although 
Lawrence, who's wearing half-a-dozen hats for this film (Executive 
Producer, Music Supervisor, Story, Screenplay, Director, and Star), 
includes a few humorous scenes, there's not enough comedy to leaven the 
film's slower portions.  The dreary setup takes forever, the thriller 
elements are disappointingly pedestrian, and the climax is formulaic.  </P>
<P>     There is the core of an interesting story here -- what happens when 
a lothario becomes a victim -- but Lawrence never does more with this 
plot strand than superficially trace it.  There should be a lot 
transpiring on a psychological level, but the script is content with 
unbelievable transformations and simple labels.  Darnell is the 
repentant sinner and Brandi is the psycho scorned woman.  The film's 
message -- don't say you love someone unless you mean it -- doesn't have 
any resonance because, aside from a few cuts and bruises, Darnell never 
pays a real price for his actions.  The ending doesn't have the guts to 
demand a meaningful sacrifice.</P>
<P>     A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE boasts several solid 
performances.  Lawrence is energetic, but never so completely out-of-
control that he loses the audience the way Jim Carrey does.  Lynn 
Whitfield occasionally manages to bring hints of humanity to Brandi (the 
almost-invisible tear on her cheek when Darnell breaks off the 
relationship is a nice touch).  Regina King and Della Reese (as 
Darnell's mother) are effective in supporting roles.  </P>
<P>     With a more clear notion of what it was trying to do and a shorter, 
tighter script, A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE could have been 
worthwhile as a comedy or a thriller, although doubtfully as both.  In 
its present form, however, the only line that this film treads is the 
ugly one between mediocrity and pointlessness.</P>
