<P>A funny thing happened this Thanksgiving. A new slam-bang action movie
starring Arnold Schwarzenegger opened and nobody seemed to notice. How
could such an oversight occur? Perhaps the barrage of hype for "How the
Grinch Stole Christmas" was so intense that it hypnotized filmgoers.
Perhaps some fumes from the 1999 stink bomb, "End of Days," lingered
around the big man's name. Or could it be that Arnold has simply entered
the twilight of his film career?</P>
<P>I hope not. Oh sure, he can't act and he's a Republican, but how can you
not love the big lug? Arnold Schwarzenegger is the embodiment of the
American dream. A scrawny kid from a tiny European village achieves fame
and fortune as a bodybuilder, then announces his intent to become a
movie star. Everyone snickers at his ambitions, his cartoonish bulk, his
gap-toothed grin and, of course, that accent. But Ah-nuld ignores the
naysayers, becomes the most popular actor on the entire planet and
marries into the Kennedy family. My God, you couldn't make up a story
like that!</P>
<P>Of course, time spares no living creature, and the years are beginning
to show on this Sequoia of a man. Schwarzenegger still does his action
hero shtick in "The 6th Day," but his movements are more deliberate,
betraying a certain creakiness. Even the bravado is muted. This time
around, his most famous catch phrase gets amended as his character
states "I might be back."</P>
<P>The aging of Schwarzenegger fits perfectly into "The 6th Day." Beneath
its sci-fi trappings, the film addresses mortality and is far more
thought provoking than one might expect.</P>
<P>Set in the near future, the story revolves around cloning. Arnold plays
husband and father Adam Gibson, who runs a charter helicopter business
with his partner Hank (Michael Rapaport). Shortly after consenting to a
high-tech fingerprinting and eyesight testing procedure for a new
client, Adam swaps a piloting gig with Hank without informing the
passengers. Later, Adam returns home, only to spot his exact duplicate
inside the house with his wife and daughter.</P>
<P>Adam learns that he was mistakenly cloned by cronies of genetic
engineering tycoon Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn). While cloning of
lower animals is allowed, the practice is strictly prohibited for
humans. Since Adam is walking evidence of Drucker's lawbreaking, the
pilot must be eliminated, leading to the sort of action expected in a
Schwarzenegger movie.</P>
<P>As entertainment, "The 6th Day" falls in the middle of the Ah-nuld
oeuvre, not as good as the "Terminator" films and "Total Recall," but
better than a lot of his outings. Although the cloning particulars are
extremely far fetched, most of the other near-future trappings seem
refreshingly credible, not to mention fun. Hank has a holographic
girlfriend so accommodating ("I've recorded all your favorite sporting
programs," she coos, while straddling him and his sensory-stimulating
love chair) that he has no desire for a real woman. Drivers can turn
over the vehicle commands to programs that drive a pre-planned route.
One of the Adams gleefully sneaks a stogie in the garage, defying a
national ban on smoking. A police station allows suspects access to
virtual-reality court-appointed attorneys and psychiatrists.</P>
<P>The futuristic stuff is a kick, but the notions raised by the cloning
theme are much more interesting. In the story, an individual's memories
and personality can be transferred to their fully-grown cloned body,
which presents Adam with an ethical quandary. Initially, he wants to
kill his clone, but then reconsiders. Even if Adam 2 is a duplicate,
does that make him deserving of death? Dr. Griffin Weir (Robert Duvall),
the scientist behind the process, faces his own dilemma when his gravely
ill wife, Katherine (Wanda Cannon) begs him to stop cloning her and just
let nature take its course.</P>
<P>I left with a number of questions. What if this procedure was possible
in our world? Would I participate? Would downloading the contents of my
brain into a new container let me attain a practical immortality, or
would my soul get lost in the transfer, leaving a separate lifeform that
only thinks it is I? Even if I could be sure that my soul would survive
the transfer, should I do it? Yes, the procedure would allow my
continued earthly survival, but what about the possibility of life after
death? I would never be able to find out if our souls reunite with loved
ones on a different plane of existence.</P>
<P>Pretty heady stuff for an Ah-nuld movie, eh? Here's a final (and
frightening) thought. What if cloning is like photocopying and, each
time you make a copy of a copy, the quality level goes down? And what
if, at the upper echelons of our society, cloning has been going on for
decades, with inferior fourth or fifth generation clones walking the
streets right now? This, my friends, would finally explain George W.
Bush, who recently claimed, in the type of phrasing that you would
expect from a fifth generation clone, that people were
"misunderestimating him." Think about it.</P>
