<PRE>It's Just a Bruise
Any Given Sunday</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>This is a hardcore football flick, not some mushy tale with football as a
backdrop. All American football all the time. So if you're not fond of the
sport, don't let your date take you. Even for those of us who like
football - it borders on the excessive.</P>
<P>What an incredible pace Oliver Stone delivers for 2 hours and 45 minutes,
impressive. The film is an MTV collage of sport, drama, and music. His fast
cuts, Hi-def digi-vid field shots and special effects put you into the
dangerous parts of the game; the dark side, where bones and spirits get
broken. Off the field, the action is still the same, ego's collide like
helmets.</P>
<P>Al Pacino plays Coach Tony Demata who can't separate life from the game -
nor can Oliver Stone. Like Tony's life, the film is all hardcore football.</P>
<P>Great acting, Jamie Foxx as QB Willie Beaman does a great job, but a
stereotypical play to make this 3rd-stringer turn hot shot into an
in-your-face vanity case is too fast and beneath the quality of the
production. I would have liked to have seen more complexity to that move.
Additionally, a scene that should have been the climax is cut short. Pacino
faces Diaz (owner) in the locker room closet - it's the all out fight we've
been waiting for ... and it's just starting to rock. But it gets cut short
of blossoming, leaving the climax to fall into a clich?coach's speech to the
team before the big game. That was fine, just could have been much better.</P>
<P>In an effort to make QB Beamen less predictable and more loveable - he
vomits in the limelight - it's a good quirk that works.</P>
<PRE>A strong B+.</PRE>
