<P>     THE FIRM was soft, THE PELICAN BRIEF wasn't, and THE CLIENT is a
trial.  Why is John Grisham so hard to make into a movie?  Three, count
'em three different filmmakers have attempted to best the bestselling
author and, with the lastest loss THE CLIENT, three strikes have made
little more than one out.</P>
<P>     The story is straight-forward and easy-to-follow and doesn't have
one scene of anyone going crazy in a copy room.  The plot is about a
eleven-year old Tennessee boy (Renfro) who may be the key to a Memphis
mob murder.  He won't talk to the Feds and barely cooperates with his
lawyer (Sarandon).  That is, until the mob sends some men to "tie up
loose ends." Even though no one actually says that in the movie.</P>
<P>     Brad Renfro and Susan Sarandon are the stars and they have good
chemistry and are more believable than either Tom Cruise or Julia
Roberts.  Renfro, in particular, is politely unpolished and a
refreshing change for smoother child actors.</P>
<P>     With the exception of Ossie Davis--who chairs the film's sole
exciting scene--the rest of the cast is a waste.  Yes, even Tommy Lee
Jones. But they all do drawl within the lines; sometimes even sounding
like bad Elvis impersonators.</P>
<P>     Speaking of which, I counted a total of eight references to The
Big E.  There may be more.  Uuuh-huh.</P>
<P>     THE CLIENT has some good local color and the occasional flash of
humor, but, considering the competition, is hardly deserving of your
summer movie dollars.  There's nothing exciting here.</P>
<P>     Anyone up to again adapt Clive Cussler?  Surely no one remembers
RAISE THE TITANIC....</P>
<P>BOTTOM LINE:  This is the guy who's going to direct BATMAN FOREVER??</P>
<PRE>Grade: C-</PRE>
