THE POSTMAN
Grade: F (I'd rather be on fire for three hours than sit through this 
one again)</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Kevin Costner
Written for the Screen by Brian Helgeland and Eric Roth from the Novel 
by David Brin
Starring: Costner, Will Patton (No Way Out), Olivia Williams, Larenz 
Tate (Dead Presidents)
Year of Release: 1997
Rating: R</PRE>
<P>Deserves Recognition for: Achieving the near-impossible task of making a 
grander monument to self-love than Steven Seagal's On Deadly Ground.</P>
<P>Capsule Review:
A question: After the floating Baby Ruth that was WATERWORLD, what in 
the @$&% were the Hollywood execs who gave Kevin Costner the money to 
make another post-apocalyptic movie thinking? In this 3 hour 
advertisement for his new hair weave, Costner plays a nameless drifter 
who dons a long dead Postal employee's uniform and gradually turns a 
nuked-out USA into an idealized hippy-dippy society. (Judging by the 
costuming at the end of the movie, the main accomplishment of this brave 
new world is in re-inventing polyester.) When he's not pointing the 
camera directly at himself, director Costner does have a nice visual 
sense, and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly 
jingoistic film in the trust-no-one 90's; but by the time the second 
hour rolled around, I was reduced to sitting on my hands to keep from 
clawing out my own eyes. Mark this one "Return to Sender".</P>
