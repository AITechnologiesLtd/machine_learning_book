<PRE>"Sound and Fury"</PRE>
<P>Heather Artinian is a precocious little six-year old who has decided that
she wants to change her world from one of being deaf to hearing. The reason
for her decision is a controversial medical device, the cochlear implant,
which would help Heather to hear. With Heather's desire as a springboard,
the fine documentary, "Sound and Fury," explores the struggle for identity
of a deaf family in the hearing world. It also attacks the controversial
issue of turning our children into robots dependent on the kindness of
those who can hear, forsaking their soundless roots.</P>
<P>When one first hears of the subject matter of "Sound and Fury," a cure for
deafness in children through surgery and implant, it sounds like a
no-brainer. Of course, if a child is born deaf, the best thing, the right
thing, to do is to correct that deficiency. The cochlear implant is
installed inside the child's skull and is attached to an external connector
that, in turn, connects to a Walkman-like device that the child must carry
in order to hear. When implanted at a very young age, the device
successfully allows the child to hear and, thus, speak. The problem is, as
a child gets older in the deaf world, they become assimilated into it,
making the value of the implant to decrease, proportionately, with age.</P>
<P>Heather's two brothers and her parents, Peter and Nita, are all deaf. Peter
is a near-militant leader of the anti-implant deaf community on Long Island
and is stunned by his daughter's desire to enter the hearing world. Nita is
initially encouraging, but, when she finds out that implant would not work
for her - an adult mind would find it nearly impossible to assimilate the
cacophony of sounds that would invade their silent world - she joins Peter
in his adamancy against the process. They also fear that their silent
world, which revolves around American Sign Language, will grow increasingly
isolated as their children are given the chance to leave the realm of the
deaf.</P>
<P>So you say to yourself, "Wow, they're right to want to preserve a culture
of necessity and keep their children close." Then, docu filmmaker Josh
Aronson and his team shift gears. Peter's sister, Mary, and her husband are
blessed with the birth of twins, but one of the babies is deaf. The hearing
couple learn of the success of the cochlear implant and immediately see the
device as a savior for their child. The whole controversy over the implant
is focused on the Artinians and their nuclear family, both deaf and
hearing.</P>
<P>Peter's adamant anti-implant stance is argued just as strongly against by
his mother, who had to learn to adapt to the life of a deaf child and had
first hand experience of the pain and the prejudice a deaf person must face
in the hearing world. Peter wishes to preserve a world where he can freely
communicate with his family. He also sees that the independent and adaptive
world of the deaf is going to close in upon him and him and his family.
Peter is, I think, justly afraid of being left alone, deaf, in a hearing
world.</P>
<P>I find it amazing that a subject that, on the surface, is so cut-and-dried,
turns out to be one of the most intelligent and thought-provoking
documentaries I have ever seen. It presents both sides of the controversy
in a fair, even-handed manner that gives ample food for thought. Each
side's case is well represented in this familial microcosm of a process
that can, indeed, change the world of the deaf. Unfortunately, the implant
will leave those untreatable in a constantly contracting world that will
garner less and less understanding or sympathy from the hearing world as
time goes forth. Peter argues, too, that the process is extremely invasive
and anything but minor, but this argument has to be discounted. As medical
technology progresses, other, less invasive, devices will be developed,
making Peter's a moot point. The real issue is the isolation and loss of a
culture that has lived and survived among us hearing folk for thousands of
years.</P>
<P>"Sound and Fury" does exactly what a documentary is supposed to do - open
your eyes to another world unfamiliar to you. It does that and makes you do
an awful lot of thinking, too. I give it an A-.</P>
