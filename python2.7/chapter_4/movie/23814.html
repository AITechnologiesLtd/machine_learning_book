<P>I'd be hard-pressed to name a movie more average than "The Skulls".=20
Scripting, acting, direction -- none of them are bad, exactly, but none=20
of them manage to impress much, either. This is the sort of movie where,
if you're paying any sort of attention, you can easily predict the plot
twists (to use the term loosely) before the first five minutes are up...
and probably come up with better ones, too. "The Skulls" is utterly
lacking in spark or invention, barely enjoyable as a mindless popcorn
movie.</P>
<P>"The Skulls" is inspired by Skull and Bones, a real Yale "secret" society.
This movie, too, takes place at Yale, though in one of several bizarre
decisions by screenwriter John Pogue, the university is never named --
despite the abundance of the letter 'Y', the name of the school sports
team, and other signs which should make the setting obvious. Luke McNamara
(Joshua Jackson) is a "townie" who has built himself up from meagre roots.
Now he's a scholarship student and the star of the school rowing team, and
has attracted the attention of the Skulls.</P>
<P>Inducted into the secret society, Luke is paired with Caleb Mandrake=20
(Paul Walker); the two become "soulmates", intended to watch each other's=
=20
back. Caleb's father, Supreme Court hopeful Judge Litten Mandrake (Craig T
Nelson) is the chairman of the Skulls, but their relationship is strained
over Caleb's indecision about his future. At first, life as a Skull seems
grand: Luke is given money, a car, women. But his newfound status -- and
the all-pervasive secrecy of the Skulls -- begins to cause tension between
him and his best friends Will (Hill Harper) and Chloe (Leslie Bibb).</P>
<P>To make matters worse, Will is covertly working on an expose of the=20
Skulls. This leads to a confrontation with Caleb and Will's death, which
the Skulls make to look like a suicide. Luke decides to betray his
benefactors and tell the police what he knows, but soon discovers that the
Skulls' power truly is as far-reaching as they claim.</P>
<P>Despite starting from a promising premise, the script for "The Skulls"=20
leaves much to be desired. Having come up with the basis for the movie, it
appears Pogue was content to write the rest of it with his brain stuck in
neutral. Usually, a conspiracy film at least hands its audience a few
unexpected twists to keep the suspense high, but even that is lacking
here. There is a feeling of inevitability surrounding the proceedings, an
unfortunate sense that we've seen all this before -- and often done=20
better.</P>
<P>But the movie's biggest problem is its conception of the Skulls itself.
Although they are obviously supposed to appear powerful and fearsome
(right from the start, we're told three Presidents have been Skulls and
the CIA owes its origins to them), the members instead come across as a
bunch of squabbling, scheming incompetents. I find it difficult to believe
that a society could remain so secret and so successful for two centuries
with its membership stabbing one another in the back at every opportunity.</P>
<P>But wait, there's another problem: just how "secret" are the Skulls
anyhow? Everyone on campus has heard of them, which isn't surprising given
that they advertise with a bloody great symbol on the roof of their
building. The night they induct new recruits is common knowledge, and each
member has a skull branded into his arm for all to see. (The movie
dubiously has the recruits don wristwatches afterward, as if this will
cover up the brand forevermore.) Their videotape records are cleverly
hidden in a secret room behind a bookcase in the campus library, accessed
by moving a certain book. This would be a foolproof scheme, I guess, if it
hadn't also appeared in about two hundred episodes of "Scooby Doo". Even
the Skulls' attempt to cover up Will's death are hamfisted. He has smacked
his head off the floor, so they make it look as if he hanged himself;
wouldn't it be a lot more convincing to just throw him off a building?</P>
<P>One good thing about "The Skulls" is that, in addition to main star
Jackson, a very good, action-oriented role is provided for Bibb as well.=20
To feature a woman who isn't entirely helpless is a rarity enough for the
genre; to feature one whose deeds are so pivotal to the outcome is unusual
indeed. Although wooden in places, Bibb does a capable job in a=20
commendable role, and it is only unfortunate that her contribution does
not extend to the movie's lackluster climax.</P>
<P>Jackson, although not a prototypical action hero in appearance, isn't bad
here either. He does a good job of portraying Luke as a man torn between
two worlds: not just between the Skulls and his friends, but between his
"misspent youth" and current Ivy League life as well. Sadly, his and
Bibb's chemistry leaves something to be desired; a sex scene, for example,
feels token and unnatural.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast is less impressive. Walker is given a lot of
potential as Caleb, but doesn't really run with it, turning in a
performance that is passable at best. Harper is vapid, albeit in a
transparently scripted, purely functional role. William Petersen, as
Senator Ames Levritt (who may or may not be Luke's only ally in the
Skulls) appears to be doing his best Bill Clinton impersonation
throughout. And Craig T Nelson is hard to take seriously in a dull and
cliched part, especially given that he seems to have borrowed Patrick
Stewart's mustache from "Masterminds".</P>
<P>Given that it boasts an intriguing premise and a couple of good young
castmembers, "The Skulls" could have been much better. As it is, this is a
mostly forgettable exercise in the paucity of the creative process. The
teenage market, at which this film is obviously aimed, has endured movies
much worse than this one. But it deserves better than "The Skulls", too.</P>
