<PRE>Kubrick's last dream </PRE>
<P>On Stanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut ' (1999)</P>
<P>America's double sexual moral was rarely brought to a sharper light
than prior to the posthumous premiere of
Stanley Kubrick's last movie Eyes Wide Shut. For weeks, the American
tv-audience's interest was roused by an enticing clip showing a naked
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman kissing in front of a mirror. The media
could not get enough of the randy pseudo-scandal atmosphere they
themselves had created. But the American viewer did not get to see any
of the sex: 65 seconds worth of "graphic content" - this wonderful
neutral term for anything inappropriate - was hid from view by
digitally added human figurines. Kubrick himself, who had died four
days after completing the movie, could not be asked for his opnion
anymore. Still, the alterations appear to have taken place with his
consent. He knew, no doubt, that depicting so-called penetration
scenes would irrevocably earn the movie the much dreaded NC-17 rating.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Kubrick's compromise did not have the desired effect.
Thanks to the hullabaloo - Roger Ebert, too,
said he couldn't approve of the changes - and also thanks to the many
interviews with "Hollywood's hottest couple", Cruise and Kidman, about
the ins and outs of extramarital sex, sex in front of a camera, sex
for sex's sake, etc., the general public was slowly, but surely,
prejudiced into thinking that Kubrick must have been a semi- or even a
full blown director of pornography.
The irony is that this observation is less distant from the truth than
one would think. For years, Kubrick was attracted by the thought of
making a porn movie under studio conditions and Terry Southern,
co-scenarist of Dr. Strangelove who also signed for the script of Blue
Movie, almost persuaded Kubrick at that time into directing this porn
classic. And indeed, why not? Kubrick's own Lolita and A Clockwork
Orange show that sex was not an alien theme in his world. Besides,
there is no conceivable reason why Kubrick, who tried so many
different genres in his small oeuvre, would shrink from pornography
(or what then would be his version of it). </P>
<P>Considering this variety of genres, one wonders what the common factor
of Kubrick's works might be, that is to say, the core, that which
necessarily comes out in each expression. To do justice to his movies,
one cannot view
them as mere contributions to the respective genres. The Shining is a
'horror movie', like Barry Lyndon is a 'costume movie' and Full Metal
Jacket is a 'Vietnam movie', but before all of this, they are made by
Stanley Kubrick. At best, what could be said is that this variety of
his work shows that he was conscious of the fact that there are
innumerable alternatives to any approach to reality.
The question of what motivated Kubrick is all the more interesting
since his personality seems to be almost completely untraceable in his
movies. That is why biographers and psychologists find themselves
disappointed when they try to assign that personality in order to
locate the center of his art. This is not, of course, because he would
not have a personality, but because the driving force in his movies is
so strong that it seems that they are governed from a great distance.
Therefore, in order to enter his realm, one needs to look for certain
characteristics in style and recurring images - less obscure, surely,
than a number, 114, that must have been of particular importance, but
less common, too, than the cliche of the genius who never left his
house. </P>
<P>Kubrick made his first film, Fear and Desire, with money that he had
hustled as a chessplayer in Greenwich Village.
His passion for chess has never left him and this is something that
can be clearly told from his movies. The
perspective with which Kubrick looks at reality is that of a
chessplayer: strategic, distanced and with a surplus of
cognitive ability and rationality. It is a view on the world that
disregards the personal, the 'human-all-too-human'. This indeed
romanticized him with an unapproachable and legendary aura, but his
psychological structure simply had to bring along this preoccupation
with what is 'great' - not because it could not degenerate into
paranoia or absolutism, but because 'greatness' is the perspective
with which chessplayers look at the world. Not by chance, the
chessplayer shares this outlook with both generals and filmdirectors,
as can be told from the panoramic battlefield
of Spartacus, Paths of Glory and Full metal Jacket. Not as panoramic,
but blown up, nonetheless, to the very extreme are such typical
Kubrickian settings as the immense 'War Room' in Dr. Strangelove, the
colossal hotel in The Shining and, finally, space itself in 2001: A
Space Odyssey.
Of course, the more the consequences of this perspective inflate
reality, the nearer the border is drawn to a moment
where either nothing is possible or everything turns into its
opposite. Kubrick reached this moment rather early in his career, in a
film that in its long title expresses the outcome of this process: Dr.
Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. A
nightmare comedy with a nuclear apocolyps as its final solution: it
seems as though Kubrick went straight through reality here, even when
he could not preserve his seriousness. Still, the humor in this movie
is not the result of a concealing or extenuating approach, but,
rather, of the absolute urgency with which Kubrick posed the question
of the future of man and atomic bomb. After all, one cannot expect to
preserve oneself, or even one's seriousness when one attempts to
pursue a movement of thought that leads to catastrophe. Kubrick used
Peter Sellers as his alter ego, but immediately dispersed into three
through him (the Group Captain Mandrake, President Muffley and Dr.
Strangelove; originally also the cowboy who at the end personally
delivers the bomb to the Ruski's). This is how he tried to outsmart
reality, by surrounding it from all sides and assailing it with
alternatives. More balanced and, indeed, more poetic, Kubrick repeated
this process six years later in 2001: A Space Odyssey, where he 'went
through reality' once more, this time by having astronaut Dave Bowman
break through the barrier of space and time ("Beyond the infinite")
and have him witness his own rebirth as "Star Child". </P>
<P>Realities such as these, taken to the extreme consequence, were the
result of a logic that Kubrick could only give form and shape to if
and when he attained complete and full control over his films. Outside
influences on his work were to be kept at the lowest possible level.
This did not only apply to human interfering, but also to reality
itself, which he rebuilt in his studio. To Kubrick this was the only
way to design a world according to his own insights. Besides, when you
create a world of your own, you're also allowed to destroy it, if you
so chose.
In contrast - but not in contradiction - to the fending off of other
peoples' interfering with his movies, Kubrick attached high value to
mankind in a world that, since the Enlightenment of Barry Lyndon's
18th century, had more and more come to reflect his own chessplayer's
mind: rational, logical and, as an extension of that, technical and
scientific. Nothing fascinated Kubrick so much as the fatal disparity
between the ever progressing technological achievements on the one
hand and the lagging spiritual developments of mankind on the other.
This is the reason why Kubrick's people (mostly men; women, who
emphasize feeling, play secondary roles) try to
find access to a system (often their own creation) that is founded on
logic and rationality. But in order to gain access they need to
surrender their control over themselves. As soon as that happens the
system turns itself against them and expels them, after which they are
left to wander meaninglessly through a labyrinth-type surrounding,
where they find that the only thing they can rely on is, after all,
that same fragile humanity.</P>
<P>One early depiction of such a labyrinth can be found in the endless
trenches of Paths of Glory. They are the mad
creation of a system that cynically claims its own men, who have given
up the authority over themselves. Another
labyrinth is on board the spaceship of 2001: A Space Odyssey, where
the astronauts do their workouts in paths
that have no beginning, ending or even direction, and where the HAL
9000-computer finally and fatally takes command. In The Shining we
find the opposite mechanism at work: the gigantic hotel, with its
endless hallways, chambers and enormous spaces does not expel Jack
Torrance (Jack Nicholson) but gains power over him and reduces him to
a mere function of its morbid jokes. Perhaps this is the reason why
the labyrinth got its most literal expression in this movie: not only
outside, in the snow, but inside too, in the hallways where the little
boy drives his tricycle in endless rounds and blood from ages past
comes flooding in.
There is another figure in which Kubrick depicted his appreciation of
the human: that of the machine-man. The
most literal example of that creation is, of course, the HAL-9000
computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey But there
is Dr. Strangelove, too, who is not able to control his arm and Alex
Burgess in A Clockwork Orange, who has his
impulses programmed into him. In Full Metal Jacket, soldiers are
trained to become killing machines. They expel
the fat boy Gomer Pyle from their midst, an event that is mirrored in
the second half of the movie by Pyle's antipode, the North-Vietnamese
female sniper, who singlehandedly takes up the task of expelling the
Americans from her country.
Finally, in A.I. (Artificial Intelligence), the project that Kubrick
had been working on since 1977 but that he left unfinished, again the
subject was a machine-man: a robot in the guise of a little boy, who,
against a background of ultramodern high tech, desires to become
human. </P>
<P>Going from this machine-man to Eyes Wide Shut seems to be quite a
leap, since the human factor would  supposedly be visible au naturel
here. But what is better suited for depicting the loss of humanity
than the moment where love and eroticism transfer into mechanically
experienced sex? 
After a party at a friend's house, where Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman)
is seduced by one of the guests, she confesses to her husband Bill
(Tom Cruise) that several years before she had an encounter with a
naval officer during which she was willing to give up "everything":
him, their marriage, their 7 year old daughter, herself. Additionally,
she tells him about a dream that she had in which she went to bed with
"hundreds" of men. Bill becomes so upset by this that he leaves the
house, not so much with the plan to commit adultery, as to find out
which powers are at work here. His wandering expedition leads him
through a series of women, each of whom is willing to give herself to
him, although this never actually takes place. It all results in the
visual highpoint of the movie: a closed gathering with a Freemasonry
character in a Kubrickian country house (huge rooms, hallways,
staircases) where masked men and women indulge in sex. It is here that
Harford is exposed as an intruder and where both the motive of the
system versus the human, as well as the subsequent expulsion become
actual. And so, Bill and Alice relate inversely proportional to
eachother: what Alice experiences in her dream is what Bill
unsuccessfully tries to copy in reality. But considering the title and
the corresponding title of Arthur Schnitzler Traumnovelle ("Dream
novella") on which Kubrick based the script, one wonders whether or
not what Bill experienced is real at all. Perhaps Bill's quest was
nothing but a dreamt initiationrite1 with the purpose of
renewing him and making him see that Alice is not only related to him
through sexual ties. Their reconciliation in the end, while doing
Christmas shopping with their daughter, indicates that despite
Kubrick's passing away there might still be hope for mankind. It is a
conclusion to which the already classic final word of the movie -
Alice's four letter invitation to Bill - seems to follow up on very
nicely.</P>
