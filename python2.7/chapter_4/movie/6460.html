<PRE>                             THE EVENING STAR
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     What could be more foul than having your ashes spread over the
beach of the horribly polluted Gulf of Mexico?  Well, maybe having to
sit through THE EVENING STAR, the long-awaited tearjerky sequel to TERMS
OF ENDEARMENT.</P>
<P>     THE EVENING STAR picks up in 1988, and follows 8 more years of the
further adventures of Aurora Greenwood's (Shirley MacLaine)
uber-dysfunctional extended family.  Now, Emma's (Debra Winger in TERMS)
kids have grown up under Aurora's eye, and the jury's still out on how
well she did.  Their Aunt Patsy (Miranda Richardson) is now a wealthy
divorcee who is constantly one-upping Aurora.  The caustic Aurora finds
brief happiness in the arms of a younger man (Bill Paxton).  Rosie
(Marion Ross) is still in Aurora's kitchen, and a whole horde of minor
players weave in and out of the action, mainly serving to dredge up the
past and to breathe some new life into the ENDEARMENT franchise.</P>
<P>     THE EVENING STAR is so chock full of mystery illnesses & deaths,
Oedipal complexes, prison terms, illegitimate children, and other
staples of daytime TV that you'd think it would make a much better movie
than it does.  Instead, the film comes off as a pointless rehashing of
old story lines, part soap opera (see above illnesses, etc.) and part
sitcom (sample wacky dialogue: "How are we gonna get Aurora Greenwood to
see a shrink!?").</P>
<P>     ...and *all* cheese.  By killing off the entire senior citizen
population of Houston (where the film is set and was shot in), the
filmmakers go straight for the tear ducts, in the hopes that you'll be
crying too much to notice that this movie has no plot whatsoever.  When
someone's not gasping last words, the film is just a series of movie
cliches, one after another.  Why bother?</P>
<P>     While there are a few bright sparks in the film, notably the
fantastically over-the-top Richardson and the curmudgeony Ross, plus
some decent jokes here and there, overall the movie is a meandering tale
that, in the end, just reminds me even more of why I hate Houston so
much.</P>
