<P>     Calling all technophobes!  Though slower than a 486 with only 4K
of RAM, Irwin Winkler's well-titled thriller benefits from a honest
performance by Sandra Bullock (WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING). Her plucky
charms recall Julia Roberts, especially in a scene were evades a killer
by dressing up as a fireman.  Bless her heart.  She's so busy trying to
act like a computer geek (yeah right) that she doesn't even think to
change her appearance after being listed as a fugitive in a police
computer system.  Sigh.</P>
<P>     There really isn't much of a reason to recommend connecting to THE
NET.  Though the absence of any Windows 95 references is a definite
plus, the plot is Swiss cheese, the techie stuff is far-fetched, and
there's precious little screen time actually devoted to the art of
hacking.  (There is a car chase, though!)</P>
<P>     As recent Washington legislation can attest, the time is ripe for
a movie to further fuel the fears of a computer-based culture.  Too bad
that this classic "wrong man" premise flubs on the logic.  How can we
be afraid of hackers who act as dumb as Sandra Bullock's character??</P>
<PRE>     This NET needs an upgrade.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C-</PRE>
<PRE>CLUELESS
========</PRE>
<P>     Beverly Hills remains an easy target as writer/director Amy
Heckerling (FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH) takes aim at their high
school sect.  There's really only one joke here--that, duh, these kids
are too spoiled to have a single clue between them--but it's a good
joke that's both casually and confidently milked for a solid ninety
minutes.  Nothing hilarious, just *very* amusing.</P>
<P>     Alicia Silverstone (THE CRUSH) leads an appealing cast of teens
that includes Stacey Dash, Brittany Murphy, and Jeremy Sisto.  The
adult actors could have more to do, though.  The usually tart Wallace
Shawn, for example, is awfully wishy washy here.  Inconceivable!  Then
again, where else this summer can you find jokes about SPARTACUS and
2001: A SPACE ODESSEY butting heads with Beavis and Ren & Stimpy??</P>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
<PRE>THE SILENCE OF THE HAMS
=======================</PRE>
<P>     Caught this one on video.  Writer/director/producer/star Ezio
Gregio's 1994 spoof is actually worth a rent (with fast-forwarding) to
catch Dom DeLuise's brief-but-delicious performance as Dr. Animal
Cannibal Pizza.  The veteran comic actor is in top form.  The rest of
the movie is a patchwork rework of PSYCHO and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,
with more than a little sifting through the files of POLICE SQUAD!
Billy Zane stars as, ahem, FBI Agent Jo Dee Fostar.  (And that's one of
the better jokes!)</P>
<P>     With Larry Storch, Phyllis Diller, Rip Taylor, Bubba Smith, Martin
Balsam, John Landis, Mel Brooks, John Astin, and Shelley Winters.</P>
<PRE>     Scary.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: D-</PRE>
