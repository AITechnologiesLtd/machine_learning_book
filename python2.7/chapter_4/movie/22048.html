<PRE>VIOLENT COP
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>In the aptly named VIOLENT COP (SONO OTOKO, KYOBO NI TSUKI), Azuma
(Takeshi Kitano) is a DIRTY HARRY-style rogue cop operating in Japan.
Directed by Kitano without any of DIRTY HARRY's comedic flourishes and
without the character depth of Kitano's more successful FIREWORKS, the
movie does start promisingly.</P>
<P>When some juvenile delinquents -- now more politely called social
misfits -- beat up a poor man, Azuma visits one of their homes.  Telling
the boy's mother not to worry, Azuma goes into the kid's room and beats
him up in order to teach him a lesson.</P>
<P>Azuma's a vigilante who dispenses his brand of justice on the spot.  In
his mind the world is easily dichotomized into the victims and the punks
-- his favorite expression being "damned punk."  When someone dares
sleep with Azuma's grown sister, he gets ridiculed as a punk and slapped
around by Azuma.</P>
<P>VIOLENT COP, which has almost no music and little ambient noise,
possesses a serenity that is periodically punctured by random acts of
increasingly horrific violence.  Kitano's acting is always intriguing,
but the thin story has trouble holding the viewer's interest.  Starting
off as a character study, the picture quickly degrades into just a
collection of stylized acts of violence.  The intensity of Kitano's
acting and directing has to be respected even if they become
increasingly difficult to admire as the story grinds on.</P>
<P>The English translation of the dialog sometimes becomes laughably
sparse.  One interchange, for example, has a new cop introducing himself
to Azuma with "I'm the rookie. Coach me."</P>
<P>The minimal plot involves drugs, but the plot is just a ruse.  The whole
point of the picture is to let Azuma demonstrate his sadomasochistic
behaviors.  Walking into a hail of bullets, he doesn't even duck as he
gets holes all over his body.  "Everybody's crazy," the criminal's
second in command says of both sides in the war of Azuma vs. the drug
dealers.  And so is the movie -- violently crazy.</P>
<P>VIOLENT COP runs 1:43.  The film is in Japanese with English subtitles.
It is not rated but would be an R for strong violence, drug use and sex.
The film would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are older and
mature.</P>
