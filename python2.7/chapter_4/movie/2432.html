<PRE>"A foul is not a foul until the referee blows his whistle."
                                        - Alfre Woodard to Nick Nolte,
                                          on the subject of rules.</PRE>
<P>     Hurrah!  Hurrah!  Once-upon-a-time wunderkind Bill Friedkin is
back and with a subject that hits, at here in North Carolian, *very*
close to home.  With an assist from basketballsy writer Ron Shelton,
Friedkin's first film in four is a exciting but easy examination of
illegal recruiting practices in college basketball.</P>
<P>     BLUE CHIPS introduces Pete Bell (Nolte), the dedicated coach of
the Western University Dolphins.  The team has just wrapped its first
losing season and Bell is upset, to the say the least.  He knows that
his team is doing their best, but he needs better players--boys they
can't recruit because *he* won't play "dirty pool." Pressured by
everyone from the alumni to his athletic director, Bell confronts this
issue to build a strong "starting line" for the upcoming season.</P>
<P>     BLUE CHIPS is a frantically charged film.  True to Friedkin form,
*everything* stays in motion.  Bill films basketball like he was born
for it and even his off-court scenes have an infectious energy.  He
also pulls a powerhouse performance from Nolte, who spends the entire
film wrestling with his conscious more than with his players.  Nolte's
best scene comes early, when he punts a basketball into the stands
after losing a fight with a ref.</P>
<P>     Less successful is Shelton's script and how it oversimplifies
illegal recruiting.  The characters have depth, but not the story.  The
ending is unusually good for a sports film, though.  BLUE CHIPS favors
fair-play instead of feel-good and it's a welcome change.  Even *with*
a soapbox speech at the end.</P>
<PRE>     The rest of the cast is a scattershot mix.</PRE>
<P>     McDonnell gives a mediocre performance as Bell's basketball-smart
ex-wife.  And there's barely any chemistry between her and Nolte.  The
ever-leering J. T. Walsh hangs out the ham, again, as an boorish
booster.  And seven-foot, four-inch "Shaq" O'Neal makes an appealing
freshman recruit.</P>
<P>     (Six-foot, one-inch "Ed" O'Neill is wasted as an investigative
reporter, though.  But his inclusion may be nothing more than a simple
joke--if memory serves, O'Neill once played a TV version of "Popeye"
Doyle!)</P>
<P>     For basketball fans, BLUE CHIPS is a fountain of familiar faces.
Larry Bird, Bob Cousy, Jerry Tarkanian, and, yes, Dick Vitale, are just
some of the good sports who appear in the film.</P>
<PRE>Bottom line:    As a morality play on college recruiting, BLUE CHIPS
                scores about 3 out of 5 from the free-throw line.  But,
                for fans of both Nick Nolte and William Friedkin, it's
                a winner.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
