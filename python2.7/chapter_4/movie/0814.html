<PRE>                                    DARKMAN
                       A film review by David Alba, Jr.
                        Copyright 1990 David Alba, Jr.</PRE>
<P>     When I first entered the theater, I had somewhat mediocre
expectations for the film DARKMAN.  The trailers looked good but I
really didn't know much about the director (I have never seen any of the
EVIL DEAD movies), but when I left the theater I was glad I took a
chance on seeing this excellent movie.  </P>
<P>     The story involves a scientist Dr. Peyton Westlake (Liam Neeson)
who is working on an invention that will create realistic synthetic
skin.  His girlfriend, Julie Hastings (Frances McDormand) who works for
the District Attorney's office uncovers a document revealing some
illegal transactions between Trask Industries and Robert Durant (Larry
Drake).  One night when Westlake is on the brink of perfecting his
invention, Durant and his hoods break into Peyton's lab in search of the
document.  After roughing up Westlake they find the document.  Durant's
henchmen dunk Westlake's hands and face into a vat of acid, afterward
they blow up his lab.  Julie arriving home after work sees this
explosion and assumes Peyton is dead.  Later we find out that Peyton
wasn't killed, instead he was taken to the Hospital Burn Unit with
severe burns over 40% of his body, the worst being on his face and
hands.  After Peyton regains consciousness he escapes from the hospital
and becomes DARKMAN.</P>
<P>     DARKMAN has the ability by using his invention, to assume the 
identity of anyone he chooses simply by using their photograph.  He also
possesses incredible strength and no longer has the capability of
feeling any physical pain, due to an operation that was performed in the
hospital.</P>
<P>     The visual effects in this film were quite good.  I also enjoyed
the directorial style of Sam Raimi.  The performances of the actors were
also very good, especially Liam Neeson.</P>
<P>     The latest trend in films today is making movies about comic 
heroes.  We have been treated to BATMAN and DICK TRACY.  CBS has a
television series called THE FLASH due for its fall season, and the
films CAPTAIN AMERICA, SPIDERMAN and the BATMAN sequel are also in the
planning stages.  DARKMAN had the look of a comic book that BATMAN was
missing and DICK TRACY never achieved.</P>
<P>     So, the next time a stranger bumps into you on the street or your
loved one doesn't seem to be themselves.  You might want to ask
yourself: is it really them or could it be DARKMAN??  I give this film a
rating of +2.</P>
