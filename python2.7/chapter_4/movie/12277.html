<P>>From the first film version of Victor Hugo's classic novel 'Les
Miserables' in 1935 with Fredric March and Charles Laughton, to the
latest (not counting this one) in 1995 with Jean-Paul Belmondo and
Michel Boujenah, there have been four other notable versions sandwiched
in between.  Two in 1952, one in 1957 and a television version in 1978.
Hugo's fascinating novel of forgiveness and redemption is a timeless and
literary classic message to be passed down for all generations to come.
I've read the book twice but the last time was some 15 years ago or so
and I must confess that I've never seen any of the staged versions but
so what?  Motion pictures capture the true essence of eternal human
expression better than any other medium.  Just my opinion, of course,
but seeing visuals spring from the pages of artful writing is truly one
of life's greatest pleasures.  The latest version is a pleasing, but is
at times a muted adaptation that might disappoint the hard core fans of
the story but will satisfy most others.  I'm somewhere in between and I
recommend the picture either way.</P>
<P>Set in early 19th century France, Liam Neeson is Jean Valjean, a man
convicted of stealing bread from a merchant's window display and is
forced to spend 19 years in prison, suffering the harsh labour of a
punishment that doesn't fit the crime.  The hypocrisy of 19th justice
comes to complete fruition as people are judged in the workplace on
their morals, but a completely immoral punishment such as this comes to
pass.  Upon his release on parole, he examines his future through the
kind actions of a monsignor who spares him from a return to prison and
Valjean rises above the social cellar to become a man of political
influence and considerable wealth.  Neeson is towering in the role of
Valjean, uncompromising in his righteous path of redemption while
retaining the strength of character he learned the hard way in prison.</P>
<P>Geoffrey Rush ('Shine') is Javert, a man who served as an official who
supervised, abused and humiliated Valjean in prison and now recognizes
Valjean twenty years later, determined to see Valjean arrested for
circumstances that he considers to be a violation of Valjean's parole.
His intention is to expose Valjean for who he once was.  In this time
and place, you don't have the chance to reform as society always judges
you by what you've done in your past life.   Javert is a man so rigid in
his moral high ground, that he fails to see the errors of his way.  Rush
is completely different from the role he played in 'Shine'.  He proves
he can make a villain just as memorable as a hero and he is truly a
gifted performer.</P>
<P>Valjean now owns a factory and is the local mayor and takes pity upon a
former worker, Fantine (Uma Thurman) who was dismissed for having a
child out of wedlock and is now forced to work as a prostitute to
support her daughter that she sent away to live with others.  As he is
forced to leave his business behind because of the relentless pursuit by
Javert, Valjean adopts Fantine's daughter Cosette (Mimi Newman as a
little girl and and later Claire Danes as a young woman) after Fantine's
death and as the years pass, they try an make a life for themselves
around the time of an uprising against the French monarchy.  Cosette's
semi-romantic involvement with a young revolutionary (Hans Matheson) is
the film's weak spot, an underwritten sub plot that detracts for the
overall impact of the film's climax.</P>
<P>As a richly textured and deeply felt part of literary history, Les
Miserables transforms well into a motion picture but it is impossible to
portray all of the book's elements in a 2 hour and 13 minute film but
director Bille August and screenwriter Rafael Yglesias have fashioned a
version of the story that moves well, is easy to understand, and despite
the lack of French accents among the cast, it's a story of redemption on
many levels, most notably that of souls tormented by their past.</P>
