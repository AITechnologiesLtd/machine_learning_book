<P>Call it "Happy Gilmore Meets the Bad News Bears" or "Billy Madison Opens 
Up a Big Ole Can of Whup Ass." Either way, you get the idea: Adam Sandler 
is back and he's up to his old tricks again, with yet another broad 
comedy starring a culturally-arrested adult with violent tendencies. Hard-
core Sandler fans will cheer his antics and the up-with-people storyline, 
while everyone else will wonder why he keeps cranking out variations of 
the same movie.</P>
<P>Now Adam Sandler is no dummy (though he plays one onscreen) and he knows 
what elements are required to satisfy the target audience for a film like 
this. His story introduces a lovable loser, simple-minded Cajun Mama's 
boy, Bobby Boucher. Athletes love picking on the childlike waterboy until 
they discover his formidable skills as a tackle. Everybody loves an 
underdog, so the tale pits Bobby and a sad-sack football team with a 
neurotic coach against a bunch of overgrown, self-satisfied bullies, led 
by former "Smokey and The Bandit" second banana Jerry Reed. As if that 
wasn't enough, Sandler further loads the deck by making Bobby's home life 
equally oppressive, with the kid's ferociously smothering mother (Kathy 
Bates) deeming everything from young ladies to Dick Clark as tools of the 
devil. </P>
<P>Add a sexy girl (Fairuza Balk), a Nick-At-Night co-star (Henry Winkler, 
leaving the Fonz behind to play a timid coach), loads of cameos by 
celebrities playing themselves (Lee Corso, Bill Cowher, Dan Fouts, Chris 
Fowler, Jimmy Johnson, Brent Musburger, Dan Patrick, Lynn Swann and 
Lawrence Taylor), the requisite surprise appearance from a "Saturday 
Night Live" alumnus (Rob Schneider), a feel-good plot, plus well-staged 
slapstick out the wahzoo, and you've got yourself a surefire moneymaker. 
The only thing missing is even the vaguest hint of an original idea.</P>
<P>The explanation for Sandler's artistic rut may lie with his creative team.
 One of the film's producers is Jack Giarraputo, a college buddy of 
Sandler's. "Waterboy" director Frank Coraci was another college pal, and 
Sandler co-wrote the story with former college roomie Tim Herlihy. 
Sandler states that the group, also responsible for three of his other 
films, creates a comfortable environment, explaining "I like working with 
people I've seen in just a towel."</P>
<P>That's a good line, and "The Waterboy" has quite a few genuinely funny 
moments. The slapstick works more often than not, there are some great 
sight gags, and a number of strong one-liners (one crack-related joke 
works on two levels, due to the recent headline-making substance abuse 
problems of the man who delivers the line). But despite the laughs, this 
is a tired production. There is nothing wrong with low-brow humor, but 
Sandler and his frat-house friends have done the infant-in-an-adult-body 
shtick to death. To paraphrase Danny Glover (from all four "Lethal 
Weapon" movies), aren't they getting too old for this shit?</P>
<P>A film like this wouldn't be quite as frustrating were it not for 
Sandler's breakthrough performance in "The Wedding Singer." In that hit 
comedy, Sandler proved he could charm a wide audience, hold his own as a 
romantic lead and even play an actual adult, all without sacrificing his 
trademark style. After enjoying his winning turn in "The Wedding Singer," 
it's hard to watch him climb back into the playpen.</P>
<P>The cast of "The Waterboy" is varied, to say the least. Kathy Bates has a 
whale of a good time playing Bobby's Louisiana swamp mama and her 
performance, cartoonish as it may be, is one you won't soon forget. As a 
dangerous young woman smitten with Bobby, Fairuza Balk is terrific, 
projecting confidence, charisma and an edgy trailer-park sexuality. Henry 
Winkler has a certain odd charm as Bobby's whipped-puppy mentor, while 
Jerry Reed haplessly blusters as the chief villain of the movie. </P>
<P>As is his norm, Sandler peppers the story with some really strange minor 
players. Clint Howard, Opie's little brother, leaves a greasy impression 
as a fanatical redneck football fan, and Rob Schneider somehow manages to 
be filthy and smarmy simultaneously as a hillbilly booster. Other 
eccentrics include Robert Kokol as a Kentucky-Fried windbag professor and 
Blake Clark as assistant coach Farmer Fran, whose incomprehensible Cajun 
mutterings is a running gag that might have been funny, had we not seen 
the same joke 24 years ago in "Blazing Saddles."</P>
<P>But, of course, that brings us back to "The Waterboy's" central problem. 
We've seen this all before, at least twice by Sandler and his pals, and 
countless times by other "Saturday Night Live" graduates. Speaking of 
graduating, perhaps it's time for Adam Sandler to graduate; from the 
comforting sameness of his college roomie production team and from 
reworking the same movie over and over. Hopefully Sandler will look at 
"The Wedding Singer" as one small step, and his next movie as one giant 
leap to a new level of more sophisticated comedic filmmaking.</P>
