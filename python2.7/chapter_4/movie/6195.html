<P>     Part English lecture, part behind-the-scenes documentary and part
theater piece, LOOKING FOR RICHARD is an ambitious experiment created by
Al Pacino as a sort of "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About
Shakespeare but Were Afraid to Ask."  Motivated by a desire to make the
works of William Shakespeare speak to a contemporary audience, Pacino
spent several years (evidenced by his now-you-see-it, now-you-don't facial
hair in the film) putting together a film version of "Richard III" which
would combine performance of key scenes, observation of the actors
wrangling over interpretation of those scenes, and historical background
for the play.  To that end he brought together a group of actors including
Alec Baldwin, Winona Ryder, Kevin Spacey and Aidan Quinn to make their
"Richard III" a Shakespeare for the uninitiated.</P>
<P>     It is a noble goal Pacino has set for himself, but there is something
inherently contradictory about the way he has chosen to go about achieving
it.  As an educational tool, LOOKING FOR RICHARD isn't exactly pitched at
those individuals represented in his person-on-the-street interviews, most
of whom greet the word "Shakespeare" with a shrug or a grimace (the
notable exception being a panhandler who speaks eloquently about how the
Bard "instructed us how to feel").  It is a fairly academic piece of work,
with lectures about iambic pentameter intermingled with talking heads
describing the events in the play.  Pacino employs rat-a-tat editing to
cut back and forth between locations for rehearsals, descriptive narration
and the play itself, resulting in a film which may have been made with the
multiplex audience in mind but which seems destined exclusively for the
art houses.</P>
<P>     Yet LOOKING FOR RICHARD is likely to bore those same art house
viewers, because the film does not offer much in the way of insight.  The
actors and academics who speak throughout LOOKING FOR RICHARD go to such
lengths to make the basic plot of "Richard III" understandable that they
have little time or inclination to dig deeper.  Pacino may have wanted to
foster the "appreciation" of Shakespeare, but he is willing to settle for
people being able to describe what happened and who is doing what to whom,
and that doesn't leave much for those who already know and love
Shakespeare.</P>
<P>     It is also likely that those same art house-attending,
Shakespeare-loving viewers saw Ian McKellen's dynamic RICHARD III last
year, a cinematic rendering which does far more to thrust the play into a
20th century context.  Pacino himself plays the hunch-backed villain with
his typical intensity, and he often shifts into his habit of indicating
the significance of a given line by the volume at which he delivers it.
It is a straightforward performance, but far better ones are turned in by
Kevin Spacey (whose Buckingham seems so fiercely intelligent that he
becomes like an advisor to a modern politician) and even Alec Baldwin (a
surprisingly sympathetic Clarence).  Winona Ryder is a bit less successful
as Lady Anne, and Aidan Quinn is even less successful as Richmond; Quinn
in particular is like a walking manifestation of John Gielgud's comment in
the film that American actors become intimidated by Shakespeare because
"they've been told they can't do it."</P>
<P>     If LOOKING FOR RICHARD does one thing particularly well, it is to
emphasize the interpretive process which makes Shakespeare a living text.
There may be little inherent drama in a group of actors sitting around a
table talking about what they see going on in any given scene, but the
scenes of those conversations help to show the unique qualities of
performed literature.  It is one of the film's best moments when Pacino's
collaborator Frederic Kimball explodes in frustration at Pacino's plan to
ask an "expert" why a character might have acted in a certain way.  "You
know more about this character," Kimball bellows, and it is a perfectly
succinct description of how a role is re-defined by every actor who
performs it.  That makes LOOKING FOR RICHARD an interesting supplement for
a drama class, but it isn't nearly as worthwhile for an English class.
With its snippets of scenes and specific historical asides, LOOKING FOR
RICHARD doesn't exactly teach how to explore the Bard's texts.  It is more
like a filmed version of the Cliff's Notes.</P>
