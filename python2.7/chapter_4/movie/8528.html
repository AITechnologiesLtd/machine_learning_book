<P>CONSPIRACY THEORY -- a movie review by Justin K. Siegel</P>
<P>Scenario: Alice Sutton (Julia Roberts) walks into the office of one Henry Finsch, a man who she needs to get in contact with due to the fact that his life may be in danger.</P>
<P>"He'll be with you in a moment," his secretary says.</P>
<P>Then I, Justin K. Siegel, viewer, turn to my viewing companion and
whisper, "it's the guy with the nose."</P>
<P>She tells me to shut up and watch the movie.</P>
<PRE>It _is_ the guy with the nose.</PRE>
<P>Predictability is often frowned upon by movie critics and civilians
who like to think they're movie critics, but in a lot of cases,
CONSPIRACY THEORY being one of them, predictability can can be a
welcome thing.</P>
<P>Mel Gibson plays Jerry Fletcher, a freaked-out cab-sriver who
publishes a quarterly newsletter entitled "Conspiracy Thery." In it,
he includes newspaper clippings and his beliefs on everything from
flouride in drinking water ("It turns you into a robot unable of
creativity or free thought") to the cinema of Oliver Stone ("do you
think he'd still be alive, knowing what he knows, if he weren't
working for them?"). It is safe to say that Jerry _is_ a wild and
crazy guy.</P>
<P>He is also stalking Alice Sutton, a lawyer whose father was murdered
about six months ago. Jerry, I don't think, is in love with her per
se, but the conspiracy surrounding her father's death. She should hate
him, but something draws her to him. It could have something to do
with the fact that he looks like Mel Gibson.</P>
<P>When Mel prints something in his newsletter that has a slight ring of
truth to it, the aforementioned "guy with the nose" (Patrick Stewart,
from "ST:TNG") kidnaps him, drugs him and almost gets him murdered. He
is called the guy with the nose because Jerry, in the process of
defending himself, bites this guy's nose off.</P>
<P>Now, I would be lying if I said I fully comprehended the gist of this
film, but I understood enough to know I liked it. My viewing
companion, in fact, believes that Mel Gibson should be nominated for
Best Actor for his performance. I tended to disagree, as Peter Fonda's
heartbreaking turn in ULEE'S GOLD is still too fresh in my mind, but
who knows what I'll think come next Febuary when the nominations are
handed out? Not me.</P>
<P>I do know one thing, though: I'm tired...</P>
