_A Simple Plan_ and _Waking Ned Devine_</PRE>
<P>Lifelong drinking buddies, from a small town in the middle of nowhere,
accidentally come across a ticket to financial freedom. In order to
secure the millions that they+ve discovered, one devices a plan, which
they unanimously pursue.  One lets his wife in on the secret, and while
she initially is against it, relents, and becomes a partner in the
crime.  Needless to say, complications arise, and these everyday folk
find themselves committing vices that they never dreamed of committing.
The men struggle against all sides to prevent the possible prison
sentences.  Suspicious outsiders close in, and (I+m not giving anything
away in saying this) untimely deaths occur.</P>
<P>The movie is, of course, _Waking Ned Devine_.  The delightfully droll
English comedy stars Ian Bannen and David Kelly who live in a seaside
Irish village, where they find that the winner of a national lottery has
died, ticket in hand, ecstatic smile on face.  The two plan to collect
the money for themselves, by fooling the lottery officials of the
original ticket-buyers+ whereabouts.  The laughs come from these
complications, the quirkiness of its characters, and through two madcap
scenes of laugh-out-loud slapstick, which I will not disclose here.  And
yet...</P>
<P>And yet, watching this film, I was reminded of _A Simple Plan_, a
cinematic thunderbolt still a-fresh in my mind.  It starred Bill Paxton
and Billy Bob Thorton (an Academy caliber performance) as two brothers
who discover four million dollars on a crashed plane in a nearby
wildlife reserve.  They decide to "hold" the money, and if nobody claims
it, take it for themselves.  That film had tackled the moral
implications of its plot on a much more serious, yet unpredictable
scale.</P>
<P>In both films, greed opens its doors to worse crimes.  In _A Simple
Plan_, the protagonists+ plotting leads to impending doom.  In _Waking
Ned Devine_, the devising takes on a happier note.  In one, the end
result is hell on earth.  In the other, it appears to be a greater good.</P>
<P>What makes this all the more confusing is the differences between the
two sets of plotting characters.  When Paxton and his wife (Bridget
Fonda) want the money, it is for their future plans--a child is on the
way.  But when Ian Bannen and his wife (Fionnula Flanagan) want the
money, they are retired, have been content with frugal living, and face
it--their future is, ahem, limited.  For the former pair, it is criminal
for them to participate in the plan, albeit with honorable reasons.  For
the latter pair, it is not only good, but circumstances appear that it
was divinely-ordained that they receive their fortune, for what appears
to be the paltriest of intentions.</P>
<P>Because it is a comedy, _Waking Ned Devine_ has no room for asking the
greater questions.  Even if you fully root for the characters, and exit
the theater with the light-comedy sign-of-approval--the goofy grin, the
film leaves open the possiblity that, due to simple economics, the
characters+ standard of living will not be affected at all, and all of
that mayhem occurred in vain.  I don+t think the filmmakers intended for
there to be a sting in that film, which is unfortunate, because had it
had one, it would have been a better film.</P>
<P>Still, considering the curse that January puts upon new releases, you
can+t do any worse than these films.  _Waking Ned Devine_ is nothing
more than satire-lite, a "Get out of jail free" card for two-hours of
greed indulgence.  _A Simple Plan_ is more serious, more economical in
delivery, more surprising, more shocking, more thought-provoking, more
memorable, with great performances and a heart-stopping script...   but
with less humor.</P>
