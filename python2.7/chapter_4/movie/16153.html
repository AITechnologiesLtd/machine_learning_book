<P>Halloween : The Boogeyman don't scare me.</P>
<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Someone once told me it was the most successful independent film of all
time. Someone else told me that it revolutionized horror. Yet another told
me it created horror (HELLO, Psycho?). Personally, I don't see what the big
deal is all about. There are movies that I just can't stand. That their even
being created mystifies me. Halloween was such a film.</P>
<P>Like all of the horror movies that you and I, the babies and the people who
lived through the 80s dealt with, it has the same basic plot: Psycho escaped
from institution has fun stabbing/gutting/strangling/decapitating (based
upon film) the victims of his killing spree.</P>
<P> Like most horror movies, it could have been good for a laugh. But no. Trust
John Carpenter (director) to give us a film that takes itself so seriously
that you just can't laugh at it. All you can do is sit there with that
glazed look in your eyes.</P>
<P>I am truly sorry it was made. If it wasn't, there would be no horror genre
(for mass market), and we would be out some of the worst films of all time.
Granted, the Scream franchise would be gone too, but I could live with that.
I'm sorry if you already saw it. I'm sorry if you want to see it. Please, I
implore you, don't waste your time.</P>
