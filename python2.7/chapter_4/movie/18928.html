<P>
 The General's Daughter (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring John Travolta,
Madeleine Stowe, James Woods, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton, Leslie
Stefanson and Clarence Williams III</P>
<P> "The General's Daughter" is a slick thriller with crackling dialogue,
interesting characters and an intriguing mystery.</P>
<P> It's an adult melodrama with crisp, give-and-take repartee between
protagonists.</P>
<P> The "who" of the murder mystery isn't as interesting as the "why."</P>
<P> "The General's Daughter" stars John Travolta as warrant officer Paul
Brenner, a top investigator for the Army's Criminal Investigation Division.
Brenner is called upon the solve the killing of Capt. Elisabeth Campbell
(Leslie Stefanson), the daughter of base commander Gen. "Fighting Joe"
Campbell, who is due to retire within the week and possibly enter the
political arena.</P>
<P> Brenner is under pressure to solve the killing within 36 hours or the case
will be turned over to the civilian authorities. Aiding him in his
investigation is another CID agent Sarah Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe) a former
flame.</P>
<P> Together they uncover a slag heap of sexual deviation, buried secrets and
enough suspects to fill a platoon.</P>
<P> The screenplay by Christopher Bertolini and the legendary William Goldman
("All the President's Men," "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," "Marathon
Man") is based on the best-selling novel by Nelson DeMille.</P>
<P> The writing is abetted by Travolta's timing and superb delivery. His
Brenner is a juggernaut who, despite knowing the Army way of doing things,
plows straight ahead in his search for the truth.</P>
<P> A scene in which Travolta's Brenner interrogates Col. Robert Moore
(scene-stealer James Woods) just bristles with tension as the two spar in a
verbal chess match.</P>
<P> You get so engrossed in the dialogue and interplay between characters, yet
you never get lost as the plot twists and turns on its way to a nearly
satisfying solution.</P>
<P> Without giving too much away, let's just say after all the huffing,
puffing and investigating, the final piece of the puzzle fits a bit too
easy and conveniently to tidy up all the loose ends.</P>
<P> Nevertheless, "The General's Daughter" sparkles with wit. It is no
plodding murder mystery. Rather it jogs along at a steady pace allowing its
audience to keep up.
Fine performances abound. Stowe is smart, sassy and sexy as the CID
investigator who gives as good as she gets from the chauvenistic soldiers
with whom she must deal.</P>
<P> Woods is wily and a bit vulnerable as the commanding officer of the murder
victim, while James Cromwell is cold, calculating and tough as the famous
general.</P>
<P> Also along for the proceedings are Timothy Hutton as Col. Kent, the base's
Provost Marshall, and Clarence Williams III as a top aide to Gen. Campbell.</P>
<P> Stefanson as Capt. Campbell exudes a sexuality that her uniform cannot
hide. Yet, in her small role, she also shows a kind-hearted spirit as well
as a vulnerability that makes her death even the more tragic.</P>
<P> "The General's Daughter" is an well-packaged drama that, despite a couple
of obvious plot holes, won't disappoint.</P>
