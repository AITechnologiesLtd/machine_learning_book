<PRE>                                THE WILD BUNCH
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1995 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     THE WILD BUNCH, Sam Peckinpah's magnum opus has returned to the
big screen.  The late William Holden stars as Pike Bishop, the
leader of an aging gang of outlaws who are trying for their last big
haul before they hang up their
guns.</P>
<P>     When it came out in 1969, the western appeared to be dying but
director Peckinpah created a film that was fresh stylistically and
thematically.  Today, with its honest depiction of violence and how it
effects men, women and children, THE WILD BUNCH is as relevant as
ever.</P>
<P>     Holden, with his mixture of bravado, humor and remorse, gave one
of his best performances in this film.   Bishop is morally ambivalent
but we find ourselves caring greatly for him and his bunch because in
the cruel, unlawful world they inhabit, they at least have their own
code of ethics.  Other members of the all-star cast include the late
Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine and the late Edmond O'Brien.</P>
<P>     Shot on location in Mexico, THE WILD BUNCH overflows with
atmosphere and realism which contrasts sharply with the westerns that
feel as if they take place on a movie set.   Production designer Edward
Carrere was so concerned with authenticity, he had 12,000 Red Harvester
ants and 12 gray scorpions flown in.  Peckinpah and cinematographer
Lucien Ballard beautifully capture the desert landscape in all of its
heat, dirt, and vastness.</P>
<P>     Editors Lou Lombardo and associate editor Robert Wolf  took action
sequences to new heights by juxtaposing slow-motion images with footage
shot at regular speed.  A revolutionary technique at the time, it made
the gunfights appear almost poetic.  This type of action editing is
copied all of the time today but the effect is generally nowhere near
as potent.</P>
<P>     In addition to a restored sound-track and color correction, THE
WILD BUNCH has about ten minutes of additional footage that was excised
from the director's cut before its initial release.  Time has told,
this movie is an American classic and the best way to appreciate all of
its, fun, gritty, bloody grandeur, is on the big screen.</P>
