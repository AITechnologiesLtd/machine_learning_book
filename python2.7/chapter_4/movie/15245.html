<PRE>The Imposters</PRE>
<P>Comedy is the most volatile topic to write about.  There have been
innumerable instances where I laughed wholeheartedly at a film, only to
stare blankly at a second viewing.  I don't know the criteria for making
comedy "timeless", and very few comedies make me laugh over repeated
viewings.</P>
<P>That said, _The Impostors_ made me laugh a whole lot.  It is light,
whimsical entertainment--a throw-back to the silent comedies of Keaton
and Chaplin.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's a relief.
It's about two unemployed actors who find themselves in crazy
circumstances beyond their control.</P>
<P>Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt (his credits are erratic--from Flatliners
& The Three Musketeers to Bulworth and Simon Birch) play their own
rendition of Laurel and Hardy, unemployed actors who, in running from
Jeremy Burtom, an irate established actor (Alfred Molina--Boogie Nights)
hide in a crate, only to find themselves as stowaways on that very same
ship that Burtom is on.  Ha ha.</P>
<P>Afterwards there are deceptions, takeover plots, mistaken identities,
cross-dressings, broken hearts, and the worst subtitles joke I+ve seen
since _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_.  It+s so bad, that you can+t
help but laugh at the inanity of it all.</P>
<P>The great cast includes Lily Taylor (Ransom), Billy Connolly (Mrs.
Brown), Steve Buscemi (Fargo), Hope Davis (Next Stop Wonderland),
Campbell Scott (The Spanish Prisoner) and Isabella Rossellini (Big
Night).  They are all given roles that best exploits (or drastically
alters) their standard screen personas.</P>
<P>Granted, ensemble casts don't mean as much as they used to.  (Take a
"Cannonball Run" film, or a Leslie Nielson film, and count the
recognizable actors with the "doin' this for a paycheck" mentality).
Here, however, it appears that the cast is game.  The atmosphere is
contagious.  The actors are having fun. We have fun too.</P>
<P>_The Imposters_ was produced, directed, and written by Tucci, who
enthralled moviegoers with _Big Night_ two years ago.  I felt _BN_ was
overrated, but I liked _The Impostors_ a good deal more. Tucci has
crafted a very light, very funny comedy that works in its own right.</P>
