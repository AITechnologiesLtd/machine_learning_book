"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>A promising comedy from Nisha Ganatra, Chutney Popcorn is an interesting
film about sibling rivalry taken one step beyond the norm. Ganatra, who
also directed and co-wrote the film, stars as Reena, a motorcycle-riding
henna tattoo artist and photographer in New York City.  She's also
Indian and a lesbian, and Popcorn shows the provocative clash between
the traditional and modern relationships.</P>
<P>Popcorn opens with Reena missing sister Sarita's (Sakina Jaffrey, Cotton
Mary) wedding to Mitch (Nick Chinlund, Third Watch).  Being late is one
thing, but Reena's mom hits the roof when she's tardy and brings
beautiful girlfriend Lisa (Jill Hennessy, Law & Order).  It becomes
clear that Reena can do nothing right in the eyes of her mother and, as
a result, has developed a distinct jealousy toward sister Sarita.</P>
<P>Reena sees her big chance to win Mom's approval when, after several
months of unsuccessful attempts, Sarita announces she's unable to get
pregnant.  Much to the slack-jawed surprise of everyone, Reena steps in
and offers to carry her sister's baby to term, and then give the child
to Sarita and Mitch to raise.</P>
<P>Popcorn's first act sets up the characters, while the second shows Reena
trying to get pregnant (there are several funny turkey-baster scenes).
The third act focuses on the havoc that the pregnancy wreaks in the
relationships of each character, especially between Reena and the
permanency-phobic Lisa.  `She's my sister,' Reena explains, before Lisa
complains, `So you owe her 13 chromosomes?'</P>
<P>There are also a series of frank sexual discussions that take place in
front of a street vendor become somewhat of a running gag in the film.
But the main attraction here is the rivalry between Reena and Sarita.
One is boring and grounded, while the other is a fun-loving free
spirit.  By the time the closing credits role, they've swapped places.</P>
<P>Popcorn features a dizzyingly beautiful soundtrack, featuring Team
Dresch, Maganpop, The Spinanes and The Magnetic Fields.</P>
<P>1:32 – R for adult language and sexual content</P>
