<P>Surreal and visually dazzling, "The Matrix" is one hearty bowl of sci-fi 
goulash. Andy and Larry Wachowski, the brothers behind the sultry lesbian 
gangster flick, "Bound," incorporate everything from John Woo-style 
operatic violence to "Alice in Wonderland" trippiness in this bleak-chic 
extravaganza. The production is extremely derivative, but still great 
gloomy fun. Besides, any filmmakers who can create a story that logically 
incorporates the superhuman fighting techniques from contemporary Hong 
Kong action movies, the freeze-frame, pivoting-camera special effect 
popularized by the swing-dance "Gap" ad, and the chronically dazed look 
on Keanu Reeves' face, are all right in my book. </P>
<P>Like last year's "Dark City," "The Matrix" explores the very nature of 
reality. "Dark City" is a better film, more successfully creating and 
maintaining a quasi dream state, but "The Matrix" offers plenty of its 
own rewards. With movies like these, it's best to enter the theater with 
no advance knowledge and just let the story flow over you, but since 
feature length mind-fucks aren't everyone's cup of tea, I'll run down the 
basic set-up, if only for the benefit of your date.</P>
<P>(SPOILER ALERT: Reveals significant plot points) Thomas Anderson (Reeves) 
is a clean-cut computer programmer working for a software corporation in 
1999, but the young man leads a secret life. As a hacker called Neo, he 
seeks to ease his nagging discomfort with the way his life feels by 
searching for truth on the ominous fringes of the Internet. Moments 
before the authorities close in, his online mentor Morpheus (Laurence 
Fishburne) urges him to "Follow the white rabbit" if he wishes to avoid 
arrest. Spotting a tattoo of a rabbit on the arm of a young rebel, Neo 
joins her in a wild flight from the Men in Black that leads to a 
shattering revelation.</P>
<P>Neo's existence is a lie, a virtual reality construct devised by a race 
of sentient machines to control mankind. In the distant future, the 
remnants of humanity are kept in fluid pods, with fabricated lives piped 
into their brains. The retro 1999 setting is but a comforting illusion, 
reflecting the last year before the beginning of the fall of our culture. 
In the new millennium, the human race fought, and lost, a long, horrific 
war with the artificial intelligence they created. The machines now use 
people as a power source, and the Matrix is the mechanism to control 
their crop of souls. </P>
<P>But Morpheus, one of the few remaining free human rebels, has been to the 
Oracle and believes Neo to be "The One," the messiah who will bring 
salvation. Freed from his pod, Neo joins Morpheus and his followers in 
their small ship and undergoes training. He must learn to discard all 
notions of physical limitations in order to plug in and fight the 
machines on the virtual battlefield of metropolitan 1999. But the 
Sentient Agents, led by the sadistic Smith (Hugo Weaving), have their own 
agenda. Using superior intelligence, they will capture the band of 
warriors and snuff out the organic rebellion once and for all (END 
SPOILERS).</P>
<P>The Wachowski boys do a dandy job of making this hooey seem more 
meaningful than it is by deftly working in overtly religious references, 
general undertones of mysticism and loads of technobabble. Thankfully, 
they throw in some humor as well. The story works because the heroes, 
while sketchily drawn, are just distinct enough, and the bad guys are 
deliciously nasty. As Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving is a wicked delight, over-
enunciating as he spits out diatribes about mankind. Laurence Fishburne 
carries the proper sense of authority as the human leader, Gloria Foster 
is utterly disarming as the Oracle, Carrie-Anne Moss makes for a hell of 
a warrior and Keanu Reeves succeeds because his typical stunned persona 
is actually appropriate in this context. </P>
<P>But style is the real star of "The Matrix" and the film's powerhouse 
combination of grinding music and phenomenal visuals more than make up 
for the soggy plot that goes on a few minutes longer than it should. The 
cast, decked out in way-cool sunglasses, black leather and trenchcoats 
(even in virtual reality, fashion counts), employ a dizzying array of 
gravity-defying gymnastics and martial-arts moves, unlike anything ever 
seen in an American film. In addition to the aforementioned flow-frame 
shots and some unusual morphing effects, the filmmakers use high-speed 
photography, enhanced by computer, to depict characters running up walls, 
delivering impossibly fast punches and kicks, and making incredible leaps,
 sometimes stopping or shifting in mid-air. "The Matrix" is absolutely 
the best live-action realization of comic-book sensibilities to date. You 
may get a headache trying to decipher the ponderous storyline, but the 
amazing imagery will likely soothe your pain.</P>
