<PRE>Grade: 86</PRE>
<P>"A Christmas Carol" has to be Charles Dickens' most famous work.
There are countless versions and parodies, but all of them,
this version is probably the best.</P>
<P>It tells the story of Ebenezer Scrooge (Alastair Sim), an elderly
businessman who has grown cold-hearted and miserly over the years,
discarding family and disregarding his employees, especially
humble clerk Bob Crachit (Mervyn Johns).  On Christmas Eve, Scrooge is
visited by a series of ghosts, who seek to change his ways before
he has to walk the earth after death, dragging heavy chains like
his unlucky partner Jacob Marley (Michael Horndern).  The ghosts 
represent Christmas Past, Present, and Future.  Will Scrooge recognize
the error of his ways?  Will he repent and embrace mankind?</P>
<P>There seems to be a correlation between the ghosts of Christmas
and Scrooge's character.  The Spirit of Christmas Past is kindly,
as was Scrooge in his youth.  Christmas Present is more stern,
just as Scrooge has become cruel.  And Christmas Future is
as forboding and bleak as is Scrooge's future.</P>
<P>Why is this version of the classic better than its competitors?
The script is well adapted, and the direction is tight, but
the film's strength comes from the cast.  Bob Crachit, Tiny Tim,
and Scrooge's pleasant nephew all glow with the warmth of
Christmas spirit.  Alastair Sim plays Scrooge so that you feel
sorry for him, rather than despise him, especially after the
spirit of Christmas Past has shown us that Scrooge has taken
some hard knocks.</P>
<P>"Scrooge" is a British production, but the accents are not strong
and I had no trouble following the dialogue.</P>
