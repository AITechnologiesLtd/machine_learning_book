<P>     Consider this situation:  your daughter has just been raped and 
beaten.  The two men who attacked her have been apprehended, but are 
likely to be set free.  You are a Vietnam vet with combat training and 
have access to an M-16.  What do you do?  Sit by and hope that the 
fickle American courts decide the issue based on who has the best 
lawyer, or take decisive action now?  Author John Grisham recognized 
that this scenario would make for a compelling tale, so, during the late 
1980s, after spicing it up by including themes of racial tension and 
capital punishment, he wrote A TIME TO KILL.  Seven years later, the 
film version of the writer's first book has reached the screen.</P>
<P>     Grisham has stated publicly that A TIME TO KILL has the most 
personal meaning of any of his works, and, as a result, he demanded a 
measure of creative control in the movie-making process.  So, with Joel 
Schumacher (THE CLIENT, BATMAN FOREVER) at the helm and Akiva Goldsman 
(THE CLIENT) credited with the screenplay, Grisham is listed as one of 
four producers.  And, while aspects of the script differ from details in 
the book, the overall storyline is very similar.  This is fortunate, 
because, of all Grisham's novels, A TIME TO KILL is the one best suited 
to generating a compelling motion picture.</P>
<P>     It's possible to argue all day about how much of the race issue in 
A TIME TO KILL is a legitimate exploration of black/white tension, and 
how much is sensationalism used to spice up the story.  The KKK has a 
prominent role, but couldn't a more moderate, less universally-despised 
group have filled a similar function?  There are times when A TIME TO 
KILL preaches, but isn't Schumacher aiming the sermon at the converted?  
The movie clearly touches on some important social issues, but it's up 
to the viewer to dig beneath the propaganda and unearth the messages 
that mean something.  Then again, it's worth noting that this Hollywood 
production is actually saying something, rather than just churning out 
eye-popping special effects while relying on a regurgitated plot.</P>
<P>     The basic setup has 10-year old Tonya Hailey, the daughter of Carl 
Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), being raped and beaten by two rednecks.  
Taking the law into his own hands, Carl Lee guns down the pair in front 
of dozens of witnesses in the Canton, Mississippi courthouse.  In the 
process, he also seriously injures a local deputy (Chris Cooper, star of 
John Sayles' LONESTAR).  Carl Lee is arrested for the double murder, and 
faces trial.  For his attorney, he chooses a local white lawyer, up-and-
coming hotshot Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey).  With a team that 
includes a sleazy divorce specialist, Harry Rex Vonner (Oliver Platt), 
an energetic assistant, Ellen Roarke (Sandra Bullock), and his old 
mentor, Lucien Wilbanks (Donald Sutherland), Jake goes up against the 
local DA (Kevin Spacey).  When the KKK become involved, Jake discovers 
that his life, and the lives of everyone close to him, including his 
wife (Ashley Judd) and daughter, are in danger.  And the defense of Carl 
Lee Hailey has just begun... </P>
<P>     Even with a one-hundred fifty minute running time, A TIME TO KILL 
is perhaps too ambitious.  In remaining faithful to the novel, the movie 
gives us too many characters and themes, and some of both get lost in 
the cracks.  Take Jake's secretary (played by Brenda Fricker), for 
example.  She's superfluous -- remove her and nothing changes.  Then 
there's the issue of capital punishment.  Jake and Ellen debate the 
subject, but it's a perfunctory argument that doesn't do much for either 
side.  </P>
<P>     Still, despite my reservations, it's impossible to deny that A TIME 
TO KILL is well-directed, expertly paced, and largely entertaining.  
Thankfully, grandstanding during the trial is kept to a minimum.  
Hollywood loves all sorts of twists and surprises in court dramas; 
Grisham has kept these to a minimum.  There are a few, primarily to keep 
the audience interested, but nothing so outlandish that we leave the 
theater shaking our heads in disbelief.  With respect to the filmed 
versions of Grisham's other novels (THE FIRM, THE PELICAN BRIEF, and THE 
CLIENT), there's no comparison -- this one is much better.</P>
<P>     The most compelling question raised by the film is whether Carl 
Lee, as a black man, can get a fair trial from a white judge and jury.  
As it turns out, he hires Jake because Jake is white.  "You see me as 
they see me," he tells the attorney.  "If you was on that jury, what 
would it take for you to set me free?"  Ultimately, A TIME TO KILL shies 
away from offering a definitive answer.  Perhaps, under the 
circumstances, it's not a question that can be answered definitively.</P>
<P>     A TIME TO KILL attracted a top-notch cast with star power and 
ability to match.  Sandra Bullock, as appealing as ever, gets top 
billing, but the real lead is Matthew McConaughey, who mixes intensity 
and natural talent with good looks.  Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as 
Carl Lee, radiating a palpable outrage and grief.  The supporting cast 
includes such luminaries as Ashley Judd, Kevin Spacey, Donald 
Sutherland, Charles S. Dutton, and M. Emmett Walsh.  From top to bottom, 
everyone does a credible job.</P>
<P>     There's not a lot of real tension about what the verdict is going 
to be, although the film unsuccessfully tries to lead us astray.  But 
there are enough interesting side-issues going on that there's no fear 
of a viewer losing interest.  Despite certain drawbacks, A TIME TO KILL 
is involving, energetic, and occasionally thought-provoking.  All things 
considered, this film will make for a worthwhile trip to the cinema for 
all, not just those who have time to kill.</P>
