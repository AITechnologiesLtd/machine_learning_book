<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is an awkward comedy made just before Kurosawa's breakthrough film,
Rashomon. It was released in the West 30 years later. It is about a
headstrong young artist, Ichiro Aoye (Mifune), who is painting in a
remote mountain vacation spot, as three peasant bystanders look over his
shoulder and he explains to them how his art comes from what he feels
inside. He has a chance encounter with an attractive, demure, famous
concert singer, Miyako Saijo (Yamaguchi), who approaches the men and
tells them she missed her bus. When told that she has to walk two miles
to town, she accepts a ride on Mifune's motorbike and checks into the
same hotel he is staying at. Before he leaves the mountain spot, he
finishes painting, now changing the color of the mountain to red,
feeling inspired by her presence.</P>
<P>At the hotel, he innocently comes into her room dressed in a bathrobe to
talk with her and when they step out on the balcony, a scandal tabloid
magazine, Amour, takes a compromising photo of them standing together,
both in bathrobes, and then the tabloid writes a false story saying they
are lovers.</P>
<P>Mifune is indignant that the scandal magazine refuses to retract their
story, and is not pleased with the publicity, even though his art
exhibition is now well attended. The moralistic artist decides to sue
the magazine and its slimy pubublisher Hori (Ozawa). Saijo
shuns the publicity and tells her manager she would like to cancel her
next concert, even though it is sold out, because she feels bad that
people are coming solely because of the scandal.</P>
<P>Into the picture enters a wormy lawyer, Hiruta (Shimura), and pleads
with Mifune to hire him to fight for him and protect his name. Mifune's
artist model can't believe he would hire a loser like him to take the
case, but Mifune says, he has honest eyes.</P>
<P>When Mifune visits his impoverished home, he finds there is only the
lawyer's angelic young daughter, Masako (Katsuragi), home in bed, as she
tells him she has TB. He sees all the racing forms in the house, but is
convinced that Hiruta must be a good man, because he has such a good
daughter, who has probably fallen onto bad times.</P>
<P>But Hiruta is not reliable, as he explains himself, saying people used
to take advantage of him and laugh at his weaknesses, so he now uses
trickery on them and doesn't care about ethics. The film switches
tracks, as the two leads are not particularly interesting types, but the
flawed Hiruta makes for a more compelling story, so he becomes the main
focus of the film. He turns out to be a drunk and when he visits Hori,
he recognizes him for a vile person, but allows himself because of his
weak character to be bought off by him.</P>
<P>The dying Masako suspects her father of betraying Mifune, and can't face
the kind-hearted artist, knowing that her father will purposefully lose
the libel suit for him. The courtroom is filled with contrivances, as
the story befits a tacky soap opera. The lawyer is shown dumping the
case while the villain publisher is smirking with contempt at his
apparent victory and to top things off, Masako dies and her last words
are for her father to win the case for Mifune. You can't beat that for
pouring on the goo!</P>
<P>Supposedly this film is a parody of the Japanese willingness to accept
America's foreign culture as theirs. Therefore the Christmas music, such
as Silent Night, is played as the trial takes place during that season,
emphasizing how after Japan's defeat in the wake of World War 11, it has
become completely westernized. Kurosawa cynically shows how the naive
but innocent plaintiffs stand little chance in a court of law that can't
look at them and know that they are innocent, as even the courtroom has
become Americanized.</P>
<P>Kurosawa is an overrated director outside of shooting an action film,
who can't shoot a dramatic film without laying on an overdose of goo.
Here he has Mifune and the concert singer become sexless, while the
publisher becomes a stock cardboard villain, and the lawyer's fall and
redemption are just too predictable to have any effect. There is
something caustic in this story, but its overall effect is ruined by too
much that is an obvious delineation of what is good and evil. The
immoral lawyer can be redeemed according to Kurosawa because he has a
goodness in him and is not an evil man, he is just a weak man, while the
innocent couple are the soul of Japan and that must never be lost sight
of. I found the message awkwardly delivered and unconvincing, and the
acting was especially bad, as the lines as rendered seemed to be
mechanical and not instinctive, it was as if all the actors attended a
school for bad actors and learned to act by being didactic. This film
hardly had a pulse, just a message it kept sending out in a not too
subtle way.</P>
