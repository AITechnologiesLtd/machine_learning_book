<P>-------------------------------------</P>
<P>The average movie enthusiast has probably heard the name Akira Kurosawa
mentioned with reverence in pretentious film-snob circles or in almost
any film school, but chances are the average movie enthusiast probably
hasn't bothered to ever really watch any of Kurosawa's films, which is a
real shame. For in these films lies the expression of unbelievable
talent - a poetry of motion and color - created and painted by a true
master of the art of modern cinema.  Now in theatrical reissue, casual
moviegoers once again have the chance to see Ran, Kurosawa's
masterpiece, on the big screen.</P>
<P>Kurosawa's closest colleagues addressed him as "sensei," a respectful
and affectionate term meaning "teacher" or "master," and for good
reason: He is without question, the master of Japanese cinema and an
artist whose film legacy spanned 50 years of moviemaking.  He influenced
filmmakers such as Lucas, Spielberg, Coppola, Scorsese and countless
others.  For example, the movie A Fistful of Dollars was really nothing
more than Western remake of the Kurosawa film Yojimbo, and The
Magnificent Seven was a remake of The Seven Samurai.  The Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Kurosawa four times in his
career, and Ran has won countless awards, including Best Film from the
esteemed National Society of Film Critics.  The film was Kurosawa's
obsession for more than 10 years and he feared that the movie would
never be made.  When it finally did get financing, it became Japan's
most expensive film ever made at the time.</P>
<P>Ran, which translates as "chaos" or "turmoil," is Kurosawa's meditation
on Shakespeare's King Lear, mixed with the history of Japan's 16th
century Civil Wars, and the Japanese legend of Mori.</P>
<P>At the age of 70, after years of consolidating his empire, the Great
Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (played brilliantly by Tatsuya Nadakai) decides
to abdicate the throne and divide his domain among his three sons.  To
illustrate his demand for family unity, Hidetora shows that a single
arrow can be easily broken, but three arrows held together are strong. 
But the loyalty the Great Lord dreams of doesn't happen and his empire
falls to family bickering and civil war, with the old lord traveling
from son to son in a futile attempt to keep empire and family together.</P>
<P>The film is beautifully well made, with subtle changes in color and
texture as the story progresses.  The characters makeup resembling an
early form of Japanese theater. Epic battles, requiring the use of 1,400
extras and hundreds of horses are shot using a multi-camera technique
that Kurosawa himself developed.  All of these elements combine to
create a feeling of immersion in the story.  And while some of the
battle scenes seem a bit campy by today's standards - with an overuse of
blood that looks more like paint - the overall picture is dramatic,
impressive, and visually stunning.</P>
<P>At 2 hours and 40 minutes the film is a bit on the long side for most
people but it does not deter from the fact that Ran is an incredible
picture worth seeing and talking about.  Whether you really are a
pretentious film snob or just someone who appreciates seeing something
well made, this film is a must-see.</P>
<PRE>4 1/2 stars</PRE>
