<PRE>                            JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS
                        A film review by Norm Schrager
                         Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com

<P>Remember all those television-themed movies in the 90s, big-screen
versions of TV favorites that were devoid of any energy (The
Flintstones, The Beverly Hillbillies, The Little Rascals, Sgt. Bilko)? 
Well, forget that problem with Josie and the Pussycats.  This pop
culture comedy is just popping with giggles, laughs, rockin' tunes, a
smart script, and an infectious spirit.</P>
<P>If you're old enough to remember the Josie and the Pussycats cartoon
(from the Archie comics), but young enough to have actually watched it,
you'll dig this.  The plot is a kick -- a trio of peace-loving, friends
4-ever, rockin' chicks get hurled into the limelight as the next big
thing... only to realize they're just a corporate vessel carrying
subliminal messages that make teenagers part with their cash.</P>
<P>It's the same idea as last year's failed Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle, but this is faster and sharper, with the sly flavor of an
Austin Powers or perhaps, a Wayne's World.  Director-writers Harry
Elfont and Deborah Kaplan create a pseudo-futuristic setting where
product placement is in every nook and cranny of life -- right down to
the McDonald's washcloth in the hotel that's shaped like an order of
fries.  Visual jokes like these come in piles, and if you blink, you
might miss some awfully good ones (quick magazine headline: Barrymore,
Diaz, & Liu to star as Pussycats!)</P>
<P>But let's not get carried away.  The story is often mighty thin, but in
a movie revolving around rock music, no problem: music video time! 
Sounds easy, and it probably is easy, but here it works.  The Pussycats
-- Rachael Leigh Cook, Tara Reid, and Rosario Dawson -- play around in
the montages with unparalleled adrenaline and happiness, and the songs
are flat-out great rock tunes (real lead vocals by Boston rock hottie
Kay Hanley).  The videos are edited with an MTV flair, but without
falling into parody.  Makes you wanna leap into the movie and jump
around.</P>
<P>A surprisingly plodding final act is saved by our two villains: music
moguls played by Alan Cumming and Parker Posey.  Both rip into their
roles, chewing up the dialogue and the scenery with an appropriate zest,
getting nearly all the laughs and looking like they're having a great
time, too.</P>
<P>Be aware, however, that some demographics are just not going to get
this.  If you know about today's boy bands, but are smart enough to
realize they're as processed as Hormel meats, this is for you.  If you
know the connection between Pussycat Tara Reid and MTV darling Carson
Daly, then this is really for you.</P>
<P>By the time the Pussycats save the day and reach rock stardom, it's
tough to wipe the grin off your face.  There's probably another show and
another adventure just around the corner.  Pussycats in Outer Space,
anyone?</P>
