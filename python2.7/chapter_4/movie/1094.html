<PRE>                        SIFF David Lean Retrospective
                         Film reviews by Jeff Meyer
                          Copyright 1991 Jeff Meyer</PRE>
<P>     The filmmaker retrospective this year focused on four of the late
David Lean's films; three of them are among his lesser-known, non-epic
pictures.  Here's four thumbnail reviews...</P>
<P>BRIEF ENCOUNTER (David Lean Retrospective/Britain, 1945):</P>
<P>It has its moments, and you get Stanley Holloway wandering in and out,
so it's watchable; but despite it's reputation as one of the great
romantic films of all time, I found it unexceptional.  (However, I think
they forgot to show a reel of it; that I'm not sure should tell you
something about the pace of it.)</P>
<P>HOBSON'S CHOICE (David Lean Retrospective/Britain, 1945):</P>
<P>Lean's only out-and-out comedy, this is a treat, telling the story of a
period romance of practicality between a humble and rather simple
cobbler (John Mills) and the elder daughter (Brenda de Banzie) of a
wealthy, imperious ogre of a bootmaker played by Charles Laughton.  The
parts with Laughton are actually rather slow, but once the film settles
on Mills and de Banzie (who decides that it's time she got married and
that Mills has his points), it's a charmer.</P>
<P>DOCTOR ZHIVAGO (David Lean Retrospective/Britain, 1965):</P>
<P>Very beautiful and pretty to look at, like a Christmas snow scene under
glass: after the first hour and a half, you want to turn it upside down
and shake it.  Alec Guinness is (as usual) magnetic in the few spots
he's on, but Ralph Richardson isn't really given much room to move
around in.  Did anyone else find themselves snorting with amusement
during Omar Sharif's last scene?  Another tragic mass transit story...</P>
<P>SUMMERTIME (David Lean Retrospective/Britain, 1955):</P>
<P>I like Katherine Hepburn, I like the script, Lean captures Venice
nicely, and it's interesting to see what Darren McGavin looked like when
he was young and hadn't discovered vampires yet.  Nothing very special,
but you feel full up afterwards.</P>
