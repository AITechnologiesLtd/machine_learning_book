<PRE>                              CRIMINAL LOVERS
                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp

<P>        She's a mouthy, demanding, bratty femme fatale who always wants her own
way. Her cuckold is a slightly goofy young fellow who hangs on her every
word and submissively goes along with whatever scheme she cooks up.
These are our unsympathetic heroes in Francois Ozon's latest exercise in
cinematic shock treatment, Criminal Lovers. </P>
<P>        After a preliminary scene in bed where the girl, Alice (Natacha
Regnier, unrecognizable from The Dreamlife of Angels), mouths off to the
boy, Luc (Jeremie Renier), taking a photograph of his limp penis and
threatening to mail it to his mother, they commit a violent crime.
Without fully knowing their motive, our title characters meander into a
high school shower and stab their jock classmate Said (Salim
Kechiouche).</P>
<P>        Taking it's cue from the Coen Brothers' recently re-released Blood
Simple, they proceed to get rid of the body by wiping up the blood and
dragging the canvas wrapped body out into the middle of the woods to
bury it. Ozon dwells on their first major obstacle, fully observing how
difficult it is to rid themselves of the corpse.</P>
<P>        Thrillers should really grab you in the first fifteen minutes. It's the
crucial time where we meet the characters who you'll be following for
the duration of the film. The biggest problem with Criminal Lovers is
that Ozon has created two characters who are downright annoying to be
with for ninety minutes - she's completely obnoxious and rude to the
boy, berating him with every word. He's a simpering weakling who sulkily
takes it on the chin. They're nasty and dull, a poor combination. </P>
<P>        Things heat up when they get lost in the woods. Before you can say
"modern retelling of Hansel and Gretel, they're kidnapped by a natty old
forest hick (creepy Miki Manojlovic) who locks them in the basement.
What follows are drawn out scenes of the wood ogre demanding that Luc
bathe him and have sex with him, just for starters. The worst, of
course, is yet to come. Why do you think he's fattening Luc up? What do
fairy tale ogres do to their victims?</P>
<P>Intercut with these relentless scenes of torture are flashbacks of high
school as Alice and Luc plan their murder. Far from illuminating the
crime, they make it trite because each twist involved in their scheme is
telegraphed so far in advance through the obvious dialogue that there's
no satisfaction in those elements of surprise. The viewer is forced to
sit and wait for the inevitable "moment of shock" where we see that
"everything is not what it seemed to be."</P>
<P>A good hour of the movie is devoted to the ogre and his child as they
spend time developing their sado-masochistic relationship while Alice
seethes in the basement demanding food. You quickly become used to the
wood ogre pushing Luc around, and soon realize that this is going to be
the movie. The youngsters aren't going to escape for several reels, so
we're treated to long takes of "wash my hairy back" or "my turn to wash
your back." Since Ozon so clearly wants to titillate and shock his
audience, the effect wears off as his well of continuous thrills runs
dry.</P>
<P>The grand finale is utterly ridiculous on every level, as Ozon winks and
nudges as the action takes place, asking the audience for a pat on the
back to acknowledge how clever he is to make fun of the lovers engaging
in their moment in the spotlight. With his numerous cutaways to animals
peeking in from the forest and the bright, shining music, you can almost
hear Ozon say, "Aren't I being so clever with my use of irony?" </P>
<P>Pretentious schoolboy drivel. This is the type of movie which gives "art
house cinema" a bad name.</P>
