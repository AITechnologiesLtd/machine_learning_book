                                 THE DUTCH MASTER 
                        A Film Review by James Berardinelli 
                         Copyright 1994 James Berardinelli </PRE>

<P>     THE DUTCH MASTER is a cleverly-developed, lighthearted comedy about 
the differences between reality and fantasy, and the hidden inhibitions 
uncovered by crossing that line.  In one sense, there is a commonality 
between Susan Seidelman's Oscar-nominated short (the movie is less than 
30 minutes long) and John Duigan's SIRENS - both narratives revolve 
around a sexually-motivated realization that forever alters the life of a 
female protagonist.  THE DUTCH MASTER, however, is contemporary, and far 
funnier. </P>
<P>     Theresa (Mira Sorvino, the daughter of actor Paul Sorvino, and co-star 
of AMONGST FRIENDS) is a dental hygienist engaged to be married to a real 
"hunk."  She's basically a normal New York girl until one day when she 
visits an art museum and becomes fascinated by a painting depicting a 
17th-century household.  Fascination becomes obsession, and Theresa 
begins to fantasize about the lives of the people depicted on the canvas, 
neglecting her friends and her fiance. </P>
<P>     With a witty script, THE DUTCH MASTER engages its audience from the 
outset, giving us a group of characters whose "realness" we can 
appreciate, if only through their down-to-earth dialogue.  Director Susan 
Seidelman, whose full-length features include DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN, 
has chosen a perfect cast, and her method of telling this story - 
combining pseudo-documentary interviews with a more traditional view of 
events - keeps this film fresh from start to finish. </P>
<P>     Told from a "woman's perspective," THE DUTCH MASTER nevertheless has 
universal appeal.  Its length is both an advantage and a disadvantage - 
there's no fat to be trimmed, but the characters are fascinating enough 
to deserve more screen time and we have to leave them just as we're 
really getting to know them.  As it is, though, there's more than enough 
in THE DUTCH MASTER than in many movies three times its length. </P>
