<PRE>                                 VISIONS OF LIGHT
                       A film review by Shane R. Burridge
                        Copyright 1997 Shane R. Burridge</PRE>
<PRE>Visions of Light (1992) 92m.  </PRE>
<P>Superlative collection of movie scenes and interviews with
cinematographers was directed by Arnold Glassman, Todd McCarthy, and
Stuart Samuels, and won the 1993 Oscar for Best Documentary.  While it
may seem a little nepotistic of the film industry to give an award to
a documentary about the film industry, it is in this case well
deserved.  The stars of the show are the directors of photography who
have  contributed to movies over the last hundred years.  VISIONS OF
LIGHT reads like a Who's Who of cinematographers:  Nestor Almendros,
Vilmos Zsigmond, James Wong Howe, Gordon Willis are among the cast 
list enthusing and reminiscing about the images they and others 
have created.</P>
<P>Documentary traces the evolution of cinema chronologically, but what
makes it unique is seeing developments such as the advent of sound and
color exclusively through the eyes of the cinematographers (although I
find it odd that the invention of new lenses is never acknowledged at
any time).  The DPs come across as a closely-knit club - it's fun
hearing them talk about their work and admiration for their
contemporaries, friends, and heroes.  As one captivating film sequence
follows another you'll feel you are at their sides, flipping through a
family album of cinematic treasures. How could anyone not want to rush
out and see all of these films on a big screen afterwards? </P>
<P>Films of every genre and era are ably represented, and what's
admirable is that there are few of the usual 'classic' scenes that
always appear in films of this type (one exception is the crane shot
of the wounded in GONE WITH THE WIND).  VISIONS OF LIGHT wisely
emphasizes the feeling of discovery - unexpected or forgotten moments
of film are unearthed and rediscovered from start to finish.  You
won't be anticipating segments from ROSEMARY'S BABY or IN COLD BLOOD. 
Other works like SUNRISE and McCABE AND MRS MILLER are impossible to
ignore.  Film packs a lot in for its 90 minutes.  You may have some
fun with friends later discussing what was left out (personally, I'd
like to know why BARRY LYNDON's breakthrough
photography-by-candlepower wasn't included).  A must for anyone
seriously interested in cinema.</P>
