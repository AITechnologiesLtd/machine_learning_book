<PRE>                       SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                        1 :-) for his girl Friday</PRE>
<P>Cast: Harrison Ford, Anne Heche, David Schwimmer, Jacqueline Obradors,
Temuera Morrison
Directors: Ivan Reitman
Producers: Ivan Reitman, Roger Birnbaum, Wallis Nicita
Screenplay: Michael Browning</P>
<P>Harrison Ford is getting to the age where playing a male lead, requires
more than just a set of good looks. The perpetually likeable Ford, has
charisma, charm and likeability that will tie him over into the next
century. Playing something reminiscent of the late Cary Grant in FATHER
GOOSE, Ford is a bit of a scruffy, drinking pilot that crashes his plane
on a deserted island, with a perky Anne Heche, fashion magazine editor
on board.</P>
<P>So this story has a Robinson Crusoe feel about it and the first half the
movie is about survival and mostly comic, because of a good series of
one liners between the Heche and Ford. Unfortunately, the final half
falls into a rather round-the-mill, ‘die hard' action flick once the
pirates arrive on the scene. The idea of Anne Heche, being Ford's girl
Friday is quite entertaining, but is she really the right choice for a
good romantic lead? There is some chemistry between Heche and Ford, but
it really should have stayed more on an intellectual level, than a
physical one. The passion aspect of their relationship is as solid as a
half-boiled egg.</P>
<P>David Schwimmer doing his usual ‘rah, rah', ‘I'm such a jerk' persona,
is perfect for his role as the weak-spirited fiancée of the Heche
character. So tt's not surprising that she chooses Ford over him.
Although, no aspect of this movie is exceptional, overall it is well
written and directed and more enjoyable than one would expect. After
all, it is a product of Ivan Reitman and any admirers of his work should
expect a comic side to this movie.</P>
