<PRE>                           PAY IT FORWARD
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A seventh grade teacher challenges
          his students to change the world.  Then one
          implements a scheme that might just do it.
          Given the premise, this is a surprisingly adult
          and moving drama.  It does not talk down to the
          viewer.  There is a lot of pain in the scarred
          characters.  Kevin Spacey again gives a solid
          performance.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low +2 (-4 to
          +4)</PRE>
<P>     A reporter's car is destroyed while he is getting a story on a
hostage crisis.  As he sadly looks at the wreckage a passing
stranger throws him some car keys, making him the gift of a new
Jaguar.  But the benefactor has one condition.  The reporter must do
large favors for each of three deserving people of his own choice.
And each of them must do three favors.  Intrigued, the reporter sets
out to find the origins of this benevolent pyramid scheme.</P>
<P>     Flash back four months.  In a Las Vegas junior high school, a
new teacher, Mr. Simonet (played by Kevin Spacey) gives his seventh
grade social studies class two tough assignments.  The first is just
to keep up with all the new vocabulary words he uses in his
conversation.  Not easy, but the second assignment is a lot harder.
"Think of an idea that could change the world."  Not an assignment
frequently given to a junior high student.  (At least not until high
school teachers see PAY IT FORWARD.)  Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel
Osment) comes up with a plan more powerful than he realizes.  He
will do favors for three people, each of whom will pass the favor on
threefold in an ever growing pyramid.  Rather than paying back the
favor they pay it forward.  This part of Las Vegas certainly is a
community that could use some altruism.  Trevor's mother Arlene
(Helen Hunt) is a recovering alcoholic who is a waitress in a casino
by day and one in a strip joint by night.  Arlene is infuriated when
Trevor gives a homeless man the run of her house, and she goes to
complain to Mr. Simonet.</P>
<P>     There are several ways this story could have gone wrong.  The
people could have been instantly transformed by the power of good.
Or everybody in the chain might have their lives dramatically
changed by the scheme.  Or the people might not be properly
developed or only developed as one might expect for a film aimed at
teens.  In fact these are people who have had some hellish
experiences and whose lives are not working out.  The script could
have pulled its punches in many different ways.  The way that story
does go wrong was in a much less offensive manner, thought wrong it
does go at the very end.  The filmmakers turn the heretofore
realistic plotline into a slightly syrupy allegory toward the end.
To that point they go out of their way to take a story that was not
pat, and then they give it a pat ending.  But then director Mimi
Leder has had previous problems with the final reel of otherwise
good movies.  That was her problem with the film DEEP IMPACT.  This
screenplay was written by Leslie Dixon who wrote OVERBOARD and MRS.
DOUBTFIRE. The writing is frequently moving and at times takes
chances.  I could probably have done without the love story.  But
for the ending and perhaps some gratuitous violence at the beginning
the writing is good.</P>
<P>     The plotting has been compared with what one might have gotten
in a Frank Capra film and it is an apt analogy, though this
screenplay has some harrowing realism, perhaps along the lines of
LEAVING LAS VEGAS.  Speaking of Las Vegas, when this film about a
pyramid scheme shows the skyline of that city, it features the Luxor
pyramid.  Was it an intentional comment?  Other writers have tried
to do films in the Capra style.  Notable particularly is THE
HUDSUCKER PROXY by the Coen Brothers.  This is a more successful
attempt.</P>
<P>     Helen Hunt seems to be showing up everywhere on the screen
these days.  She is in both PAY IT FORWARD and DR. T AND THE WOMEN,
both currently playing in theaters.  If that were not enough
theaters are showing a trailer for WHAT WOMEN WANT starring Helen
Hunt.  Haley Joel Osment, formerly of THE SIXTH SENSE, seems to have
been born with a face that just seems earnest and intense.  But
whatever part luck played, he is already a skillful actor who holds
his own against adults, not with Shirley Temple cuteness, but with
genuine acting intelligence.  Kevin Spacey also exhibits acting
intelligence, but then he is all grown up so it not quite the same
feat.  All three play scarred people, though Spacey's character's
scars are the most obvious.</P>
<P>     This is a good film worth seeing as I think the other half
dozen or so people who saw it in the theater with me would agree.
It is a pity it is not getting larger audiences.  Perhaps people are
underestimating the maturity of the storytelling.  I rate it a 7 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     A comment for people who have seen the film:  The chronology
does not quite work in this film.  The birthday party is maybe one
day before the end of the film, but the invitation to the birthday
party happened before the whole parallel sequence.  Simply too much
had to have happened in that interval of time.</P>
