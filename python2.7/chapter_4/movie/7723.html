<P>Back from the Cannes Festival where even in weak years excellent films can
be found, I felt apprehensive about what  US summer movies held in store
for me. I chose the prosaically titled "Addicted to Love" as my first local
outing, knowing little about it beyond the fact that its lead actors were
attractive. My worries increased as the movie unfurled.</P>
<P>Astronomer Sam (Broderick) works in some unnamed rural area, worries when
his schoolteacher forever-love Linda decides to accept a brief educational
assignment in New York City. In one of the several scenes that require a
leap of faith, he waves at her from his truck as he follows the airliner
she's in on the tarmac. Don't try this at home.</P>
<P>In another jolt, but this time wonderfully screwy, as Sam prepares to
welcome back Linda, he gets instead her father reading him a Dear John
letter. Linda has found a new love. Sam goes bananas with worry, but I felt
that things were looking up. (Much later the same gentleman has an  amusing
reprise of a different Dear John letter).</P>
<P>After the fastest packing job in film history, Sam flies to the Big Apple,
begins to search for his lady-love and, improbably, locates her in SoHo
where she shares the apartment of her new amour Anton.  Improbably (again!)
Sam finds a racked-and-ruined space in a condemned building just across
from Anton's.</P>
<P>Accumulating impossibilities, our jilted hero sets up a camera obscura to
spy around the clock on the new twosome. This requires an explanation. If
you know about the development of photography, you may be familiar with the
camera obscura principle, one that dates back many centuries. Imagine a
room like a big cube. You make a small hole in one wall. This acts as a
lens and projects what it "sees" outside on its opposite wall. Some
painters used this trick ages ago, and later this became the primitive
"pinhole" camera.</P>
<P>The wall picture is upside down, but since Sam knows all about optics he
Rube Goldbergs a lens system that rights the picture up on the wall he has
just painted white. The final result is a Peeping Tom's (or Sam's)
voyeuristic-masochistic super-gizmo that the audience must take on faith.</P>
<P>Next a mysterious motorcyclist, helmeted hence faceless, shows up in Sam's
loft. To no one's surprise, the biker is Maggie, the jilted fiancee of
Anton's. A photographer, collage and, somehow, audio expert,
Maggie teams up with Sam and adds sound to images by bugging Anton's place.</P>
<P>Both Sam and Maggie are cuckoo. Sam, a scientific whiz but a rube in
matters of the heart, is convinced that Linda's infatuation will wane. He
sets up weird charts on which, with self-deluding hope, he follows Linda's
symptoms, such as the diminishing (he thinks) intensity of her smiles. He's
willing to wait until Linda sees the light.</P>
<P>Maggie however wants Anton "vaporized," needs revenge, impure and
un-simple. She's like a maenad, but even as a Gorgon with snakes for hair,
Meg Ryan would still be Miss Cute Universe -- notwithstanding grungy
leopard blouses, black-rimmed eyes, coarse vocabulary and all. But she is
certainly stretching her film persona and doing it very well. (You'll find
that as matters advance, Maggie's looks get gradually un-grunged and her
speech un-coarsened).</P>
<P>Even before the movie starts it is a given that the Ryan-Broderick duo will
turn into a cooing couple, that their initial aims and tactical differences
will result in harmonious co-conspiracies. No matter how you cut it, they
make an nice couple, in love and war. Unlike Ryan, Broderick is not cast
against type, since, in so many of his roles, he has been a rather quiet
reactor rather than a flaming personality.</P>
<P>At some point between the setting up of wild gadgetry and the Maggie-Sam
rapprochement, the movie makes you disregard disbelief. Instead, it begins
to captivate and amuse you, to enjoy its cleverness and chain of surprises,
to make you conscious that there's more originality than meets the eye.</P>
<P>In the other couple there is a nominal imbalance that plays with, then goes
against, movie cliches. Linda is your film-typical wide-eyed beauty who has
lost her heart and mind to a wily Latin lover, Anton, the owner of a new
French restaurant. For a long stretch, he is your movie-typical flashy,
suave, self-assured French seducer whose affair with Maggie seems to have
been a ploy towards legal U.S. residence -- the Green Card syndrome. Yet as
the story proceeds, we find out that Anton may be a hustler but he is not a
heel or a villain, not one-dimensional, and above all, not untouched by
love.</P>
<P>Tcheky Karyo,a heavy in "La Femme  Nikita" and other films, becomes here a
splendidly comic figure, a man whose panache obscures feelings that are
complex yet do not include complexes. In an improbable but beautifully
written kitchen sequence (which doubles as gentle mocking of American
xenomania), he tells his admiring staff about his rise from a simple cafe
waiter in Paris to an entrepreneur in New York. In the New World, a French
accent, piling on the sophistication, having a culinary lexicon, audacity,
brashness (or chutzpah) have made him a glamorous figure and opened Horatio
Alger possibilities.</P>
<P>Maggie and Sam feel increasingly comfortable together. In fact, as they sit
on a sofa and watch the wall-movie of Linda and Anton they seem to enjoy it
the way the silhouettes do in Mystery ScienceTheater 3000, without the
latter's obnoxious comments. And as they plot anti-Anton activities, you
almost feel that the fun of the tricks proper is bigger than the
perpetrators'  original aims. There's improbable, off-the-wall
inventiveness at work here. Such as discrediting Anton in Linda's eyes by
(don't ask) having a monkey mark the Frenchman's shirt with lipstick, or
kids squirt-gun expensive perfume on him.</P>
<P>Those guerilla tactics expand when Sam infiltrates Anton's life, taking a
job as a dishwasher, becoming the model employee, getting appreciated by
Anton --and then ruining the restaurant by (literally) bugging it.
(Writer-reporter Dominick Dunne, the director's father, has a cameo as a
food critic).</P>
<P>Unexpectedly, what hurts Anton's soul most is the loss of Linda. What hurts
his body is a devastating allergy inflicted by Maggie, followed by broken
bones inflicted in a mix-up by Sam, by now sort of a pal . The suffering
Gallic sophisticate has, at this point, become the most interesting figure
of the movie. Though this is not  quite a "noir" comedy, it is transformed
into high-energy slapstick with all the ingredients of farce : raucousness,
physicality and funny cruelty.</P>
<P>An interesting point is that the only product-placement item in this film
is the Leica M-series camera -- as classy and fine an item as can be. It is
symbolic of the movie's own smooth elegance and mechanism once you get past
the unlikely bits.</P>
<P>Actor-producer's Griffin Dunne's first directed feature may have started
out as a potential loser but ends up as a clear winner. Photography, sets
and all production values do justice to the maverick, novel, first produced
feature script by Robert Gordon, one that took over seven years to reach
the screen.</P>
