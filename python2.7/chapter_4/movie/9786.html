<PRE>BEAN (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Mr. Bean is an internationally known character, but like all
internationally known things he's not as well known here in the US. Sure,
he has been shown on PBS from time to time, but for most of us, who's Mr.
Bean? Mr. Bean is a clumsy bumbling soft mumbling man. The hilarious Rowan
Atkinson portrays him.</P>
<P>In Bean, Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is a guard of some sort, though I could
be wrong because the position is unspecified, at the London National Art
Gallery. When a rich man in the US donates enough money to buy back the
Whistler's Mother from the London National Art Gallery, the US Grierson
Gallery requests that an expert accompany it to introduce it to the public.
What the Gallery gets is Mr. Bean. The curator of the Gallery (Peter
MacNicol) unknowingly volunteers to host Mr. Bean at his house, to the
dismay of his family and wife (Pamela Reed).</P>
<P>Rowan Atkinson is a great physical comedian who is funny but not annoying
(as with the case of Jim Carrey). The comedy bits in Bean are hilarious and
most of them had me laughing out loud. The problem was that there was too
much quiet time between the bits. Taking a TV show that's based on short
skits and stretching that out to a 90 minute feature film is a tough thing
to do. Though Bean comes close to pulling it off it fails in two ways.</P>
<P>The first is that there are, like I said, too many quiet moments between
the comedy bits. These expository moments put the movie into the real world
setting and this leads to the second reason why Bean fails. The Mr. Bean
character is a character that lives best in his own world. The things that
he does do not live too well in the real world, and by taking the Mr. Bean
character and sticking him in the real world, it takes a lot away from the
comedy. The most apparent place where the comedy just feels awful because
it's set in the real world is the hospital scene. If that had been done in
Mr. Bean's world, it would have been hilarious, but as it is in the film,
there is a kind of uneasy that follows the scene.</P>
<P>But, don't get me wrong, Bean is a funny funny movie that in parts almost
had me in tears laughing. These scenes include Bean in the restroom, Bean
at the park, and Bean with a turkey. Rowan Atkinson is perfect as Mr. Bean.
I would recommend seeing Bean during a matinee showing, it is good silly
fun that is somewhat flawed.</P>
