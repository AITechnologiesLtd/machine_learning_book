<P>Starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>I cherish energy in a movie. I cherish genuine wit even in the most
unlikely places. I cherish escapist fare that truly deserves that name -
- a movie that makes even the most critical of viewers forget it's own
faults (as well as the viewer's own troubles, if only for two hours),
sit back and enjoy. The Mummy is a movie I cherish.</P>
<P>The Mummy, believe it or not, is actually a remake of a 1932 horror film
of the same name and starring Boris Karloff. It is not a horror flick.
It's about a super-cool adventurer named O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) who
leads a young librarian (Rachel Weisz) and her brother (John Hannah) in
search of a forbidden Egyptian city. When they find it (quite easily, I
might add), the librarian screws up. She reads from a forbidden book and
that, you see, wakes up The Mummy (Aaron Vosloo), who has been stuck in
a tomb for thousands of years, has been given the powers to bring
horrible plagues on Egypt and needs human flesh and blood to regenerate.</P>
<P>>From the moment The Mummy awakens, director Stephen Sommers's (Deep
Rising) film goes into hyperdrive. It becomes a non-stop tirade of
special effects, action scenes and jokes. Damned if it doesn't work.
Throughout, The Mummy maintains a contageous sort of glee, a sense of
almost self-ridiculing facetiousness. It is the kind of movie where when
someone asks someone else what to do because the boat has been sabotaged
and is burning down, the other person responds "Stay here, I'll get
help" and jumps overboard. It's the kind of movie where the main
characters are constantly in jeopardy and yet the movie almost tells us
"Don't worry about them, look at that awesome wall of sand!"</P>
<P>Most of The Mummy is utter nonsense. Not only does the plot not make
sense, but the movie doesn't even make any attempts to justify it. This
is not a plot movie. All that matters is how the characters try to
escape their situation -- not even whether they escape, but how they go
about doing it. It's an excuse to showcase some eye-popping imagery, but
it's also a hell of a lot of fun.</P>
<P>The performances from Vosloo, Weisz and Fraser are barely worth
mentioning because they don't matter. I'm sure that their performances
are satisfactory, but if Stephen Sommers and his screenwriters could
have gotten rid of characters all together, they probably would have, so
the wall of sand could be the official star of the movie. The only
performance that bears any significance in The Mummy is that of John
Hannah -- the script has some ingeniously funny scenes reserved for him,
some of them eliciting applause from the audience (myself included).</P>
<P>There is a lot in this movie to hate. Cinematically, it's a piece of
crap. However, no human should be bored. Most should be greatly
entertained.</P>
<P>You have to get yourself in the right state of mind to enjoy this
picture. Don't look at it as a movie; view it rather as an outrageously
entertaining theme park ride. If you're not willing to strap yourself in
and drop your cinematic pretentions at the door -- don't go.
