<PRE>                               IT TAKES TWO
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     Last year's IT TAKES TWO is yet another cinematic retelling of
Mark Twain's "The Prince and the Pauper."  Since it is such a sweet and
classic tale, it is a natural for producers looking for a safe film.
Here we have the fraternal twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen in the lead
roles.  Mary-Kate is a streetwise orphan named Amanda Lemmon whereas
Ashley plays a billionaire's daughter by the name of Alyssa Callaway.</P>
<P>     The short setup for the plot is that Amanda is about to be adopted
by the horrible Butkus family who collect children, but not if her
social worker Diane Barrows (Kirstie Alley) can stop it.  Meanwhile
back at the mansion, Alyssa has her own set of problems.  Her wonderful
father Roger (Steve Guttenberg) is about to marry blond airhead and
fortune seeker Clarice Kensington (Jane Sibbett).  Clarice hates kids,
but Roger is oblivious to this fault.  Roger's butler Vincenzo (Philip
Bosco) does not like Clarice either.</P>
<P>     What makes the show bearable is that the kids look exactly alike,
and they change places with each trying to help the other out of their
predicament.  As you can guess, their driving ambition is to get Roger
and Diane to fall in love and get married so they will be sisters.</P>
<P>     Although the script by Deborah Dean Davis and Jeff Schecter is
pedestrian, it does have its good lines.  Amanda describes the troubles
of an older child getting adopted as, "The orphan stuff is like growing
up in a pound.  Everybody wants a puppy."  Roger has an usual
explanation on how he got his fortune telling Diane, "I made my money
the old fashion way - pure dumb luck."  Diane does not believe she has
a chance with Roger, reflecting, "Guys like him like girls with food
names like Cookie or Muffin or Candy, not girls like me."</P>
<P>     There is little original in the film.  Most scenes you have seen
countless times before.  They even have an old fashion food fight.  I
thought everyone had gotten tired of seeing them by now.</P>
<P>     The acting is perfectly acceptable with no outstanding good or bad
performances.  The movie takes no risks, but for kids wanting a fun
little show and for parents wanting something non-offensive, IT TAKES
TWO fills the bill.  If you rent it with suitably low expectations, you
may be surprised by it.  I should point out that this is director Andy
Tennant's first foray into directing theatrical movies.  He has done
four made-for-TV movies, but probably the only one you have heard of is
THE AMY FISHER STORY which bears no resemblance to this show.</P>
<P>     IT TAKES TWO runs a little long at 1:41.  It is rated PG because
they used a few mild swear words to keep the film from getting the
dreaded G rating.  Producers believe that G ratings mean less take at
the box office.  There is no violence, sex, or nudity.  You could let
kids of any age see this show as there is nothing to offend.  My son
Jeffrey (age 7) and I watched it on tape the other night.  He liked it,
but there isn't enough there for me to recommend it.  I do give the
film ** for its sweetness, but I wish the filmmakers had taken some
risks and come up with a more involving show.  Wholesomeness is just
not enough.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
