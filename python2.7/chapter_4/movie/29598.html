<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A triumph of quirkiness over a hackneyed western story to make it a very
appealing film that varies slightly from the genre. It had a lot of different
type of characterizations to make it a unique western, one that would acquire a
cult status as it ends with the bizarre fight on Main Street between a seafaring
Swede with a whaling harpoon killing a vicious hired gunman firing a six-shooter
and dressed in all black while having a steel fist under one of his gloved
hands. It was one of the best low-budget westerns that the noted director Joseph
H. Lewis made in his long and distinguished career, as he chose to retire from
the film industry with this film. </P>
<P>There was some controversy surrounding this film as it was probably not good for
anyone's career to appear in it, as many in the production were either
blacklisted or were subpoenaed to appear before the House of Un-American
Activities Committee. Sterling Hayden wasn't blacklisted, but appeared in front
of that committee and admitted his communist affiliations in the past--much to
his later regret, he named names. Lewis was not involved with all that but was a
close friend of one of the film's stars, Ned Young, who was blacklisted, and it
was he who asked him to direct the film. </P>
<P>After being at sea for the last 19 years and not seeing his dad (Stanhope), the
Swedish whaler, George Hanson (Hayden), returns to Prairie City, Texas, to find
that his seafaring-turned-farmer dad was killed and that the sheriff (McVey) is
corrupt and has no intention of making an arrest. He soon discovers that a
grubby land baron, McNeil (Cabot), is buying up all the farm land by force and
at a cheap price. When the Swede's dad refused to sell, he was killed by the
hired gunslinger, Johnny Crale (Ned Young). </P>
<P>McNeil can't scare Hanson out of town or get him to give up his farm, and when
he learns that there's oil on it, he's able to rally the cowardly farmers
together to stop any further land sales to McNeil. </P>
<P>Some of the characterizations are really done well: Victor Millan is a poor
Mexican farmer who witnessed his friend Hanson get shot, but because his
pregnant wife asked him not to say anything he remains uncomfortably mute. Carol
Kelly is the forlorn girlfriend of the gunslinger, who tells him that she stays
with him only because she can look up and see someone lower than herself. Ned
Young takes his code of conduct as a hired gunman seriously, even though he lost
his shooting hand and his skills have greatly diminished. Sebastian Cabot
exhibits a certain lively panache for corpulence, sleaze, and craftiness, as he
plays the town's evil villain. Sterling Hayden avenges his father's death with a
harpoon, a way that doesn't figure in a western. It was skillfully made, had
style and the expressions of an auteur filmmaker to make it standout from other
westerns. </P>
