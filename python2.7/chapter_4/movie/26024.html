<P>A touching character drama about a brother and sister questioning the ways
of their life and spirituality from the guy who wrote ANALYZE THIS and ROCKY
AND BULLWINKLE? Yup, believe it! This film tied for the Grand Jury Prize at
this year's Sundance Film Festival with another fall release entitled
GIRLFIGHT, and features a breakout performance from actor Mark Ruffalo.
Remember the name. Of course, you already know the name of the executive
producer on this project...one Martin Scorsese.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A carefree brother comes back home to visit his morally upright single mom
sister and decides to stay awhile. Their day-to-day goings-on is what fills
our time together with brother essentially trying to "find himself" while
making friends with her young son, and sister trying to figure out which
fella she'd rather keep dating while simultaneously not losing her job at
the bank. Slowly but surely, their respective traits begin to rub off on one
another.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A small movie set in a small town delivers various big elements including
top-notch performances from its two leads, extremely effective character
development all around and a poignant message dipped with the importance of
love, family, relationships and spirituality. This is obviously not a
typical Hollywood picture and surely not for everyone, but definitely one to
see for anyone who appreciates superior character studies, feels confused,
overwhelmed or bored about their own life, and is curious about the familial
foundation which supports this entire movie. This isn't a very upbeat film.
It does contain a handful of lighter moments, but is basically a movie that
feels sort of somber all the way through but doesn't ever really get boring.
The force of the writing is the main reason for that, with the superior
performances set forth by all, straddling in as a close second. Major kudos
go out to Mark Ruffalo, who completely inhabits his role as the loose
younger brother with the knack for getting into trouble, as well as Laura
Linney, playing the full role of mother, sister, lover and employee to a
tee. The excellent rapport between the two leads also makes you glad to be
spending some time with them.</P>
<P>The film also offers a solid outing for Rory Culkin in a pivotal role of the
son in the movie, and Matthew Broderick delivering yet another small but
effective performance on his end (dude, it's time to put films like GODZILLA
and INSPECTOR GADGET behind you once and for all!). The film isn't really
about anything in particular, plot-wise that is. It moves from moment to
moment, sort of like a "week in the life of" you or me. But the crux of the
story is really simmering under the covers, the relationship between brother
and sister, an emotional attachment that isn't really discussed much in film
nowadays. The two kids grow up as orphans and maintain different standards
of living, one very opposite from the other. The truth is that neither one
of them really knows exactly what they're doing (perhaps because of the lack
of parental guidance), but the love between them is never in doubt. This is
one of those smaller pictures that I really love balancing off against those
big, loud, smack-down Hollywood flicks. It's insightful, it's emotional and
it actually means something! Okay, so I might not be selling this film as
best as I could, but all I know is that it touched me with its solid
performances, great insight and universal message. One to see.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Writer/director Ken Lonergan also plays a small part in this movie. He is
the priest. He is primarily known as a playwright but has written several
screenplays including a co-writing stint on ANALYZE THIS and a full-blown
screenwriting credit on ROCKY & BULLWINKLE. His wife, J. Smith-Cameron is
also in this picture. She plays Mabel.
Actress Laura Linney is probably best remembered for playing Jim Carrey's
wife in THE TRUMAN SHOW. Clint Eastwood picked her for the part of Kate
Whitney in his movie ABSOLUTE POWER after seeing her performance in PRIMAL
FEAR.
Long-time Martin Scorsese producer and ex-wife, Barbara DeFina, is one of
the producers on this project. Martin Scorsese is also one of its executive
producers.
This is 11-year old Rory Culkin's second movie. He played the "young Richie"
his brother Macauley Culkin's RICHIE RICH movie. He also has another acting
brother named Kieran.</P>
