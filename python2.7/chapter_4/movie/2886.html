<PRE>                                 QUIZ SHOW
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1994 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     In our cynical times, a rigged game show would probably have a
tough time making the front page of a newspaper, let alone throwing a
nation into shock.  However, it is substantial enough to make a
compelling film.  QUIZ SHOW, Robert Redford's latest directorial effort
is a thoughtful, extremely well crafted movie about the fixing of the
1950's game show, "Twenty One."</P>
<P>     John Turturro plays Herb Stempel, a smart but uncharismatic man
who, as someone in the film said, "has a face fit for radio."  Stempel
is the top- rated show's reigning champion, battling new-comers each
week as he heads towards the big win.  But when the ratings begin to
slip, the chairman of NBC and the show's sponsor, Geritol, tell the
producer, Dan Enright (David Paymer),to find a more charismatic
champion.  Enright quickly takes action and offers Stempel seventy
thousand dollars if he will take a dive to challenger Charles Van Doren
(Ralph Fiennes).</P>
<P>     A member of the aristocracy, Van Doren is a handsome college
professor who is at first wary of Enright's proposal but is soon
overwhelmed by the chance for fame and fortune.  To take over the role
of reigning champion, Van Doren is fed the supposedly secret questions
and answers before the show.  Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) is a bright,
young lawyer fresh out of Harvard LawSchool who begins investigating
for the Congressional Oversight Committee, Stempel's claim that the
show was rigged.  During the investigation, Goodwin becomes friends
with the charming Van Doren and he must then wrestle with the dilemma
of putting television on trial without destroying the lives of the
contestants in a McCarthy-like ordeal.</P>
<P>     A major theme in QUIZ SHOW is temptation.  The temptation to
violate the public trust for the sake of higher ratings, the temptation
to trade one's values for fame and fortune, and the temptation to look
the other way to be accepted by the Establishment.  As Jews, Stempel
and Goodwin are both outsider to society's elite.  However, Goodwin is
more polished, more acceptable with his educational background and last
name ("its Goodwin, not Goodman," he says) to the Charlie Van Dorens of
the world.  Goodwin wants to be Van Doren's friend so badly that at one
point his wife tells him that he is "the Uncle Tom of the Jews."  By the
end of the film, Goodwin learns that Van Doren does not have the
character he thought he had, but he still cannot help but admire him.</P>
<P>     John Turturro once again turns in an excellent performance as
Stempel, the man who blows the whistle on the show because he was
denied fame and fortune.  The tragedy of Stempel's character is that he
failed to realize that the public did not want someone like him, they
wanted a handsome, wholesome face.</P>
<P>     It will be very surprising if Ralph Fiennes does not receive a
second Oscar nomination for his performance as Charles Van Doren.
Unlike his character in SCHINDLER'S LIST, we feel sympathy for this
man who has done a great wrong but who is also a victim.  The primary
basis for the sympathy is that Van Dorenis a man living under the
shadow of his over-achieving uncle and father.  Desperately wanting to
carve out his own name and success, he succumbs to temptation.  It is
difficult to condemn him for taking the road to easy money and fame
which had eluded him, despite his high intellect and strong pedigree.
In addition, the network (NBC) and the sponsor (Geritol) are the ones
who were the were the most guilty and who got off with the least
punishment.  Goodwin does place television on trial but ends up hurting
only the contestants in the end.  The producers who were implicated
went on to do the "Joker's Wild" and Goodwin ended up being a
speech-writer for Kennedy before settling down as a writer.  Stempel
and particularly, Van Doren, went on to live a secluded life.</P>
<P>     The film's beautiful look created by cinematographer Michael
Ballhaus, production designer John Hutman and costume designer Kathy
O'Rear is as much of a treat to watch as the acting.  Redford's
direction is nearly flawless.  His choices of shots, grasp of the
conflict and use of subtlety is what makes the difference in this
film.  The screenplay by Paul Attanasio does drag in parts but overall
it is well written, particularly the scenes between Charles and his
father, played with powerful presence by Paul Scofield.</P>
<P>     QUIZ SHOW gives us an entertaining account of the genesis of
television's moral decay.  The film shows us a time when people were
not cynical and trusted that whatever they saw on the "tube," was
true.  Redford uses the rigging of "Twenty One" as a focal point for
the beginning of the end of that trust.  But far more sobering than the
rigging of the quiz shows is that even today, with all the talk-shows,
tabloid news, "Date Line" scandals and political commercials, is that
television influences our opinions more than ever.</P>
