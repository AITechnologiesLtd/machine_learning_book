<PRE>                       THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>105 min., R, Mystery, 1991, In French (?) with English subtitles
Director: Krzysztof Kieslowski
Cast: Irene Jacob, Phillippe Voltar, Sandrine Dumas,
      Aleksander Bardini, Louis Duereux, Claude Duneton,
      Halina Gryglaszewska, Kalina Jedrusik</P>
<P>     In Poland, Veronika (Irene Jacob), who is a singer, has feelings
that she has a counterpart.  In France, Veronique (also Irene Jacob),
gets premonitions that something is going to happen to her.  She starts
receiving strange mail from an unknown person and tries to figure out
what it all means.</P>
<P>     I found THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE to be a great movie, and wish
that I could have gone back to see it again, but I saw it on the last
day it was being shown.  I highly recommend this film, I think that you
will probably enjoy it.  This film has been released on video cassette.
However, many video stores may probably not get this film (like mine
didn't).  If your video store has gotten the film, there is no real need
to go see it in the theater, unless you prefer to see films in the
theater.  On a scale of zero to five, I give THE DOUBLE LIFE OF
VERONIQUE a five.  THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE is rated R for female
nudity, adult situations, and explicit language.</P>
<P>     All of the actors/actresses do a great job.  Irene Jacob, who won
the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival, is excellent, as
well as being extremely beautiful.  Veronika's aunt and Veronique's
father were also both great.  A nice thing about the film is that the
two main characters (Veronika and Veronique) are shown separately.  At
only one brief time are the two shown almost together, and that keeps
the film from getting confusing.  </P>
<P>     This film is definitely not for mainstream audiences.  I feel that
those who don't ever venture to their local art theater will most likely
find this film to be a waste of time.  Those who tend to enjoy
imports/alternative cinema will most likely be entranced by the film,
although you may have to see the film twice for everything to make
sense.</P>
<P>     The idea behind the film is interesting, but I don't think that it
is a new idea.  The film is well written.  Well, I should say that the
subtitles are well written (I don't understand the language spoken so I
don't know what the actors were really saying).  The subtitles are done
with white lettering, and is almost always easy to read.  The locations
used, I assume in France and Poland, are great and really set the film
well.</P>
