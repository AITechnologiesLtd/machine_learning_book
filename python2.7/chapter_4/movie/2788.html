<P>     Dogs have always been man's best friend and, as such, it's only
fitting that a sizable number of movies have had their foundation laid
in this popular human/pet relationship.  How else is it possible to
explain the countless incarnations of Lassie and Benji?  Every once in
a while, however, filmmakers decide to throw a bone to the other
creatures of this planet--cats (one of three stories in HOMEWARD
BOUND), horses (BLACK BEAUTY), whales (FREE WILLY), and now--with the
arrival of ANDRE--seals.</P>
<P>     Really, Andre isn't much more than Lassie with flippers.  He does
a lot of the same cute antics and, of course, is ready to come to the
rescue when his foolish human friends need help.  Some might argue that
there's a little more to this film than that, but all of the peripheral
stuff is only so much excess baggage.  It's developed and presented
with little flair and a high degree of obviousness.  Those seeking
hard- hitting drama had best look elsewhere.  The closest ANDRE gets to
that sort of thing is a couple of smarmy scenes that preach the need
for tolerance.</P>
<P>     The film opens, as we're told by narrator Annette O'Toole, in
Rockport, Maine during the spring of 1962.  Harry Whitney (Keith
Carradine) is the local harbormaster and, on one of his rounds, he
discovers a sick seal.  Much to the delight of his daughter Toni (Tina
Majorino), he brings the pup home to care for it, braving the ire of
local fisherman Billy Baker (Keith Szarabajka), who blames seals for
the season's poor catches.  The return to health is a slow process, but
eventually the seal--named Andre by Toni--is ready to return to its
natural habitat.  When that day arrives, the nine year old girl is
heartbroken--but Andre still has a surprise or two in store for her.</P>
<P>     Considering ANDRE as light family entertainment is the only way to
form a satisfying opinion of the movie.  On a strictly clinical level,
it really isn't very good--the cliche-riddled plot is hopelessly
predictable, the characters are broadly realized, and the acting is
merely serviceable.  However, this, much like FREE WILLY, is the kind
of movie that kids enjoy.  It moves with enough snap not to threaten
boredom, and there aren't many deep meanings for children to furrow
their brows over.  The villains are suitably nasty, the heroes are
nicely heroic and, of course, the seal is cute and funny.  Also, ANDRE
has a couple of none-too-subtle messages that everyone will
understand.</P>
<P>     Tina Majorino is a busy young actress--this is her third film of
the year (in addition to WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN and CORRINA,
CORRINA).  She's an appealing performer who shows promise, but she
still has some rough edges to file down.  When she smiles, she lights
up the screen, but her expressions of sadness and grief are less
overwhelming.  Nevertheless, she's considerably more credible than many
actors of her age.</P>
<P>     Those with children can feel confident that ANDRE will present an
enjoyable ninety-six minutes for their offspring.  There's a lot of
saccharine here--perhaps too much for the "intellectual" movie-goer.
ANDRE will appeal most strongly to the under-thirteen crowd, or at
least to those who are of that age in heart, if not in body.</P>
