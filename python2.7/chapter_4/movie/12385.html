<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>Deep Impact is a disaster film that tries to do too much in the two
hours it has.  I noted about thirty minutes into it that the film would
have to clear three hours in order to develop all the subplots into
meaningful stories.  And, as I expected, the film instead relies on
numerous manipulative "heartfelt" scenes in which characters hug each
other, say goodbye, and cry profusely.  I'm not above all that -- some
of the character-driven moments in this film actually work.</P>
<P>But I want a disaster film!  Deep Impact is, as you all should know,
about a big comet careening towards Earth, and what we do to try and
stop it.  The film builds up steadily to its climax, parts of which you
can catch on the trailers and TV spots (you get to see giant tidal waves
destroy buildings and offshore oil rigs, among other interesting
sights).  But, that's two or three minutes of payoff for a long film
about people who cry more than anything else.  Most upsetting is that
the disaster doesn't look nearly as convincing or incredible as I was
hoping.  In trying to do everything (characters and disasters), Deep
Impact somehow misses on both counts, thus proving that you do need
three hours (Titanic) to develop characters and throw them in a disaster
like this.</P>
<P>I really don't want to synopsize the plot.  I don't feel like it right
now, and it probably doesn't matter too much because all that you need
to know is that there's a comet, and that it could wipe out all life on
earth.  I will brief you on the characters, though.  First, there's
Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni), a reporter who is essentially the first to
hear of the "biggest story in history."  Her subplot includes her mother
(Vanessa Redgrave) and her father (Maximilian Schell) who are divorced;
she's angry with her father because he's married a younger woman and is
ignoring his ex-wife.  All three actors are very good in their roles,
although Leoni seems unable to smile and Schell seems unable to do
anything but smile.</P>
<P>Then there's young Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) who, one year prior to
most of the events in the film, discovers the comet in his astronomy
class.  He's in love with Sarah Hotchner (Leelee Sobieski, who is a
Helen Hunt lookalike in every possible way).  Both kids have entire
families, the members of which are all given considerable screen time in
this film.  Wood is a strong actor, and he pulls off all of his scenes
with ease; newcomer Sobieski is also good.</P>
<P>There are many veterans in smaller roles.  Morgan Freeman plays the
president in that solid Morgan Freeman way.  James Cromwell has one
(yes, one) scene as the Secretary of State.  Robert Duvall plays
astronaut Spurgeon Tanner, the leader of the mission to destroy the
comet.  The mission utilizes the largest spaceship ever created, the
Messiah.  The plan is to fly up to the comet and plan nuclear devices in
it, hopefully diverting its path.  This is the first measure they take,
and happens about an hour into the film.  I hope you don't expect it to
succeed.  If it did, then we wouldn't get to see the comet flying
through the atmosphere and crashing into the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
<P>The film isn't what I'd call realistic.  The astronauts pilot the
Messiah right into the tail of the comet and try really hard to avoid
the house-sized chunks of ice breaking flying towards them at thousands
of miles per hour.  How the Messiah gets going that fast, or how it
catches up to the comet in a few seconds, are details that we never
learn, and, because of this, the pacing feels strange and rushed through
this section.  The subplot does provide for a well-made scene during
which the astronauts walk around on the icy surface of the comet.</P>
<P>I've heard that Spielberg hand-picked director Mimi Leder for this
project (her debut film was last year's The Peacemaker, which, in my
humble opinion, is not a quality action film, but not really because of
her).  I think she's a pretty good director, and a lot of the scenes
here are handled well (my favorite scene has Leoni and Schell standing
on a beach, awaiting impact).  Often, though, she's countered by the
script, which just isn't all that sharp.  Most of the subplots are so
gooey they ooze from one to the next, and they just keep coming . . .
even when you expect the disaster to finally arrive, you get more and
more "touching" scenes featuring teary-eyed people.</P>
<P>And I wouldn't mind, because, as I said, a lot of these scenes work
(try something a thousand times it's bound to come out right once or
twice).  But when the comet finally does hit, it just didn't grab me the
way I wanted to be grabbed.  It's nice-looking, true, and some of the
images are striking.  But many of the special effects look fuzzy (like
the water rushing over mountain tops), and the disaster overall isn't
gripping enough to warrant this much buildup.  </P>
<P>Deep Impact is an event movie, but it doesn't seem like it wants to
be.  It wants to be a self-conscious event movie with real characters
and situations to care about.  But there isn't enough real development
of the characters or enough horrific disaster footage to make the entire
package altogether smooth.  It's a moderately fun film as summer flicks
go, but it had potential to be a truly moving and frightening film. 
It's a little of both, but not quite enough of either.</P>
