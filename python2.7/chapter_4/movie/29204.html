<P>PLOT:
A brother and sister driving home through the countryside witness a man throwing
wrapped-up bodies down a chute. The two decide to go back and look into the
matter (don't ask!) and fall into a heap o' trouble. You bet!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A definite step in the right direction in respect to the horror genre in films
today, but not without its own set of pitfalls. I really dug the first half of
this film. It was creepy, it was methodically paced yet filled with tension, it
reminded me of films like DUEL and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and it placed the
audience into realistic situations with some damn scary thoughts. Unfortunately,
the second half of the film fell into the same ol' contrivances that have
plagued horror films from the beginning. We get the leads running out of gas,
having trouble starting their car, cops not believing their story, folks
standing around watching scary stuff go down when they should be running and
basically a lot of goofy decision-making on the part of the protagonists. And to
top it all off, they actually thought that it might be a good idea to toss a
psychic into the second half...that's right, you heard me correctly, a psychic!
Ugh. I hate when screenwriters take the "easy way" out and slap an all-knowing
character into these films, a person who comes into the story to explain the
entire thing to the audience and give the leads advice on what to do next and
tell us what is happening (don't you think we're a little smarter than that?).
This film didn't need that type of character, as its premise alone was a very
credible and scary one.</P>
<P>I mean, here are a couple of good ol' American kids driving through the
heartland and witnessing a creepy-looking man shoving, what appears to be, dead
human bodies down a drainpipe. Scary shit, right? Well, this film does an
excellent job of building up all of that tension early on and keeping the "bad
guy" hidden for the first half of the movie. You wonder what is going on, you
root for the two kids because you appreciate what they might be going through.
Credit director Salva for creating that extra-special strain in the film with
some interesting directing choices and an excellent score for even more creeps.
It's too bad that the second half of the film just doesn't pan out as well as
you might hope. I tend to lose interest in lead characters whenever they start
doing stupidities in horror flicks, like standing around watching when they
should be turning around and running! But there were also a couple of small plot
holes that bothered me here as well, like why the "bad guy" felt the need to
play songs when whacking out his victims (or making correlations to them) or why
he had a namesake license plate? I mean...did I miss something here?</P>
<P>But overall, the film was definitely a nice change of pace from all of the teen
slasher garbage that we've been getting of late, and I certainly appreciated its
"old school" mentality (no MTV soundtrack in sight!). So I would still recommend
that you check this movie out, just to see what will hopefully be the
continuation of more creepy, tension-filled horror movies (SESSION 9, THE
OTHERS, GINGER SNAPS). Oh yeah, and the final shot of this film is one that I
will remember forever. Brrrrrrrr...thank you Salva, for not going "Hollywood" on
us in the very end.</P>
