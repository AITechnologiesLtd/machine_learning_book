<P>I know it seems ungrateful to discuss a well-crafted, well performed movie
like A Simple Plan on the basis of its flaws, but there isn't another
honest way to do it, and anyway, there's only two of them.  The first one
isn't even anyone's fault.  Originally, director Sam Raimi had tried to
shoot the movie in Ohio, but the script called for there to be massive
quantities of snow everywhere, and it was too warm last winter for that in
Ohio.  Production was moved to Minnesota, where there was plenty of snow.
However, it was easier to change the setting than it was to change the
accents of stars Billy Bob Thornton and Bill Paxton.  As a result, A Simple
Plan ends up looking like Fargo but sounding like Deliverance.</P>
<PRE>And the other flaw...</PRE>
<P>I really don't want to talk about the other flaw.  Partly because it's a
spoiler, and I don't like putting spoilers in movie reviews or critics that
put spoilers in movie reviews.  Partly because you'd never know about it if
you hadn't read the book first.  And partly because, despite the flaw, A
Simple Plan turns out to be a pretty good movie nonetheless.</P>
<PRE>But oh, what a flaw.</PRE>
<P>The book and the movie both start out the same way.  Paxton and Thornton
play brothers Hank and Jacob Mitchell.  Hank is educated, intelligent, and
married, while Jacob is uneducated, dim, and lives alone in a filthy
hovel.  (Thornton's character is dim, but sweet and goofy, a world apart
from his character in Sling Blade.)  They are joined by Jacob's redneck
friend Lou (Brent Briscoe, also from Sling Blade) on a visit to their
parents' grave that turns into an impromptu hunting trip that turns into
the discovery of $4.4 million in used hundred-dollar bills found in a
downed plane.  The "simple plan" of the title is that Hank will hold the
money until the plane is found and it's safe to split the proceeds and
leave town.</P>
<P>A movie isn't a movie without conflict, and conflict soon develops.  Things
aren't helped when Hank's manipulative, pregnant wife Sarah (Bridget Fonda)
enters the picture and proceeds to scheme ways to protect her husband from
the incompetence of his cohorts in crime.  And then, one night, fueled by
booze and distrust, the situation explodes... and this is where the flaw
happens.</P>
<P>The novel, written by Scott B. Smith, is wonderful, but it's very
coldblooded and cruel, much more than the movie.  The filmmakers made the
decision to tone down some of the more evil and heartless aspects of the
novel.  I understand their reasoning, but I can't agree with it.  As a
result of a bad choice midway through the movie, the ending becomes painful
and false.  What should be gut-wrenching and powerful instead becomes
foolish and almost laughable.</P>
<P>I take nothing away from the principal actors.  When the casting was
announced, I thought that Paxton, Thornton, and Fonda were the best team
that could have been assembled, and I still think so.  Paxton does a
steady, workmanlike job in a steady, workmanlike part.  Thornton pulls
another Southern Gothic portrayal out of his repertoire and does his
customary, outstanding job.  Fonda has the most difficult role, changing
back and forth from a nurturing wife and mother to a calculating
conspirator in rapid-fire mode, and she's sharp and convincing.</P>
<P>The performances are enough to recommend this movie, especially accompanied
by the bleak Minnesota scenery which provides an effective backdrop to the
bleakness of the story.  But fans of the book will walk away feeling
disappointed and cheated.  The novel is a classic morality play,
illustrating the limits of greed and corruption, but the movie doesn't come
anywhere near close to reaching those limits.  The real crime in A Simple
Plan is that it isn't evil enough.</P>
