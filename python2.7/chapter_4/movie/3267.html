<PRE>                         THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Nigel Hawthorne, Helen Mirren, Ian Holm, Rupert Everett,
Julian Woodham, Amanda Donohoe, Jim Carter, Rupert Graves.
Screenplay:  Alan Bennett.
Director:  Nicholas Hytner.</P>
<P>     How do you market a stage-originated historical drama to an
American viewing public which forced a change in the film's title
when they struggled with the concept that THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE
III was not a sequel?  You could tell them that, like medicine or
"Masterpiece Theater," it was good for them, an approach which
rarely works.  Or you could try this truth:  THE MADNESS OF KING
GEORGE is thoughtful, funny, spectacularly staged and richly
performed.  Nigel Hawthorne's complex performance as George III
brings the humanity to the role necessary to raise Alan Bennett's
story of monarchy in decline to a work of rare insight.</P>
<P>     THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE opens in 1788, with the King
(Hawthorne) still bitter over the loss of the American colonies.
Always something of an eccentric, George soon appears to be growing
more and more unstable, a situation with profound political
ramifications.  The King's supporters, led by Prime Minister William
Pitt (Julian Wadham), realize that their fortunes are tied to his,
and try to keep him out of sight.  Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales
(Rupert Everett), bored with a life of "nothing to do," seeks to
have his father declared incompetent and himself named as regent,
and allies himself with Pitt's rival Charles James Fox (Jim Carter).
As support for Fox's bill grows, the King's supporters bring in
Willis (Ian Holm), an unorthodox "doctor" who intends to cure the
King's madness by any means necessary.</P>
<P>     Perhaps more than anything else, THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE is
about the dissolution of monarchy.  It takes place on the eve of the
French Revolution, during a time of social change throughout the
Western world, and presents in George III a king confronted for
perhaps the first time with his own humanity.  As he is subjected to
every possible indignity (including incontinence and the barbaric
treatments prescribed by his buffoonish cadre of doctors), George
III desperately and persistently pronounces his place as God's
annointed one.  Finally, as Willis straps him to a chair, his
statement that "I am the King" is greeted by a simple "No...you are
the patient."  From the opening sequence, which shows the King being
adorned for an a public appearance, it becomes clear that we will
see him stripped down to nothing, to the simple, sick man that he
is.</P>
<P>     If it appears from this description that Alan Bennett, who
adapted his own stage play for the screen, is baldly anti-royalty,
that isn't entirely the case.  He makes George a remarkably
sympathetic character, and casts an even darker eye on the
machinations of those whose only concerns about his well-being are
political.  Much of the credit for the success of King George as a
character goes to Nigel Hawthorne, who also played the role on
stage.  He is by turns comic, petulant, tender and infuriating,
crafting a performance so vivid that it is easy to forget that he is
playing a king.  His scenes of his private relationship with Queen
Charlotte (Helen Mirren) show a gentle and devoted husband who
refers to his wife as "Mrs. King," and they are quite affecting, but
his finest moment may be a scene with no dialogue.  With little more
than a lowering of his eyes and a swallow, he becomes a thoroughly
beaten man who has lost the last shred of his royal dignity.</P>
<P>     The most pleasant surprise in THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE may be
that stage director Nicholas Hytner, in his first screen directing
effort, demonstrates such an instinctive understanding of what makes
the two media different.  He opens up the play, taking advantage of
Ken Adam's superb production design, and he uses close-ups to
marvelous effect.  In fact, the only things wrong with the film
might be a few lackluster supporting performances and references
which require a bit too much knowledge of British political history
(notably a pun on "Pitt the elder and Pitt the younger").  As a
whole, however, THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE is a wonderfully realized
story of a turning point in the history of the world, when the head
that wore the crown became just the head of another man with very
human frailties.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 royal retainers:  9.</PRE>
