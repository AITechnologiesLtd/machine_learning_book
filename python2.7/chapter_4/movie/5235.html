<P>     Since its initial publication in 1947, THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK has 
sold more than 25 million copies.  It has been adapted for the stage, 
and, in 1959, made into a feature film.  As this new essay about Anne 
observes, she has become "Hitler's most famous victim" and "a symbol of 
10 million murdered", more than ten percent of whom were children.  
Director Jon Blair (who made the award-winning documentary, SCHINDLER) 
earned a best documentary Oscar for this, the only comprehensive motion 
picture chronicling Anne Frank's life.</P>
<P>     Those who have read the diary are aware of Anne's indomitable 
spirit, but, in terms of an historical perspective, her writings cover 
only two years.  Blair's film fills in factual gaps, providing 
previously-unrevealed tidbits about the Frank family.  More importantly, 
however, the movie extends the tale beyond August 1944, when the last 
journal entry was made.  During the second half of this film, we follow 
the ultimately-fatal journey that took Anne from her family's hiding 
place in Amsterdam to Gestapo headquarters to Auschwitz and, finally, 
Bergen-Belsen, where she died in February 1945 of typhus (one month 
before the camp was liberated by advancing allied troops).  Of the seven 
who went into hiding with Anne, only one survived the war -- her father, 
Otto Frank, who devoted the rest of his life to keeping his young 
daughter's memory alive.</P>
<P>     ANNE FRANK REMEMBERED interviews a number of people who knew Anne, 
either before or after she was sent to the concentration camps.  Miep 
Gies, one of the quartet who concealed the Frank family from the Nazis 
in Amsterdam for over a year, offers extensive recollections of Anne, 
her father, and the war.  Anne's lone surviving relative, Bernd Elias, 
expresses his feelings about his cousin.  Excerpts from 1976 and 1979 
interviews with Otto Frank (who died in 1980) are included.  Together 
with many other testimonials, these form a compelling picture of events 
not covered by Anne's diary. </P>
<P>     In making ANNE FRANK REMEMBERED, Blair obtained the cooperation of 
the Anne Frank House and Museum in Amsterdam, and was granted permission 
not only to film in the actual place where the Frank family was hidden, 
but to re-create the furnishings.  With the camera panning through the 
rooms and Glenn Close reading excerpts from the diary, Anne's presence 
is almost palpable.</P>
<P>     As is always true of movies involving the Holocaust, the most 
difficult part to watch takes place in the concentration camps.  Using 
eyewitness accounts, ANNE FRANK REMEMBERED pieces together horrifying 
images of Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen at the time when Anne moved from 
one to the other.  Despite all that has been written and filmed about 
Hitler's final solution, each new image or word serves only to add new 
dimensions to our perspective of this monstrous crime against humanity.  </P>
<P>     Perhaps the most remarkable piece of archival footage presented in 
this film is a small, one-second film clip of Anne on a balcony -- the 
only known moving picture ever taken of her.  It represents a tenuous 
link to a girl who is known to so many people through her diary.  Even 
Otto Frank admitted that he never really knew his daughter until he read 
what she had written. </P>
<P>     ANNE FRANK REMEMBERED is as important for what it will preserve for 
posterity as for the story it tells today.  The message emerging from 
the Holocaust has always been "Never Forget", and films of this quality 
make it impossible not to remember.  If the story of each of Hitler's 
victims was told with the sensitivity and power of ANNE FRANK 
REMEMBERED, there would not be enough buckets in the world to hold all 
the tears.</P>
