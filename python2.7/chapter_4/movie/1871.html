<PRE>                                 INDOCHINE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  There is human drama, political
     spectacle, and beautiful scenery in this DR. ZHIVAGO of
     Vietnam.  A story of a love triangle is told against the
     backdrop of the Vietnamese revolt against French imperialism.
     Recommended.  Rating:  +3 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     INDOCHINE is a DR. ZHIVAGO for Indochina/Vietnam.  Like DR. ZHIVAGO, it
is an almost melodramatic love triangle story set against the backdrop of a
country in revolution.  It is a story of people living through the death of
one world they knew and the birth of another world where they must survive.</P>
<P>     Eliane (played by Catherine Deneuve) is a very independent French woman
who runs a rubber plantation in French Indochina in the 1930s.  As the film
opens she is attending the funeral of two close Indochinese friends.  She
adopts their young daughter and tries to bring up young Camille (played by
Linh Dan Pham) in the ways of the French aristocracy.  Camille tries to be
French, but we see her as much more the same flesh as the workers that
Eliane occasionally beats.  Into this relationship comes Jean-Baptiste
(played by Vincent Perez), a handsome French naval officer.  Eliane falls
for Jean-Baptiste, having a short passionate affair with him.  Then Jean-
Baptiste saves Camille from a terrorist and mother and daughter discover
that they love the same man.  The tension tears the small family apart and
Camille runs away from home.  Traveling on foot on her own gives Camille a
chance to see what the French colonial power is really doing to her country.
Eventually she becomes a  pawn in the Vietnamese revolt against the French.</P>
<P>     Director Regis Wargnier has an eye for the stunning scenery of Vietnam,
both natural and in the native Vietnamese cultural costumes.  The film takes
its time, 158 minutes, to tell a story that covers a long span in the
characters' lives.  While the film's sympathies are obviously against the
French occupation, the political viewpoint is somewhat understated.
Wargnier's hand is considerably more subtle than Bernardo Bertolucci's was
in films such as 1900 and THE LAST EMPEROR.</P>
<P>     INDOCHINE is intelligent and entertaining, certainly one of the best
films of 1992.  I give it a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>[Seen at the Loew's Theater in Red Bank, NJ.]</P>
