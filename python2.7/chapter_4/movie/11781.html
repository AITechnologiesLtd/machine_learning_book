Les roseaux sauvages
---------------------
(France 1994)</PRE>
<P>Directed by André Téchiné;
With Gaël Morel, Elodie Bouchez, Frédéric Gorny, Stéphane Rideau,
Michèle Moretti</P>
<P>German title: "Wilde Herzen"; American Title: "Wild Reeds"</P>
<P>I want to start at the end. The camera seems to have lost its
orientation. It rotates, seeking young people whose search of their
place in life was described in the film. Maybe some spectators are
looking for orientation in their lives too, and possibly the film could
help them.</P>
<P>The scene of André Téchiné's convincing, prize-winning autobiographic
drama "Les roseaux sauvages" is laid in the France of 1962, short before
the end of the Algerian War. France had already consented to Algeria's
independence under an agreement, but this peace treaty was combatted by
the OAS, a nationalist organization of French living in Algeria.</P>
<P>The main characters in the film are four boarders.
François (Gaël Morel) and Maité (Elodie Bouchez), the daughter of the
French mistress Mme. Alvarez (Michèle Moretti), love each other, but on
a purely spiritual level. More and more François perceives a homosexual
inclination in himself. He falls in love for his class-mate Serge
(Stéphane Rideau). But the latter doesn't reciprocate his love. They
sleep with each other only once. Serge is heterosexual and feels
attracted by Maité, but she feels reservations against him.
In a noteworthy scene at a party François confesses Maité that he slept
with a boy, but she explains François that this doesn't alter her love
to him.
At the beginning of the film François, Maité and Mme. Alvarez are guests
at the wedding of Serge's brother, who was a pupil of Mme. Alvarez in
former times and who is now a French soldier in Algeria. Serge's brother
asks Mme. Alvarez, a communist, to hide him, because he doesn't want to
return to Algeria. But she refuses. Later Serge falls a victim to an
assassination committed by the OAS.
Serge angrily leaves the funeral. François induces Maité to follow Serge
in order to console him. François wishes that these two people he loves
shall love each other as well.
Mme. Alvarez has a breakdown caused by a sense of guilt. Serge for the
present looks upon the newcomer Henri (Frédéric Gorny) as an enemy,
because Henri is an Algerian-French adherent of the OAS. Mme. Alvarez
and Maité also feel reservations against Henri, and somehow so does
François. But nevertheless François feels also attracted by Henri in
some way, what entails discussions with Maité ...</P>
<P>One theme of "Les roseaux sauvages" is tolerance. The tolerance motif is
also verbally expressed, when François reads out Jean de La Fontaine's
fable "Le chêne et le roseau" in a French lesson. You can find the
tolerance motif in connection with the liaisons of the protagonists - as
in the above-mentioned confession scene. And you can also find it in
connection with their views of life and their political standpoints (for
instance their attitudes towards the Algerian War), that are different
because of different origin and personal living circumstances. The film
shows impressively, that political disagreements needn't be an
insurmountable barrier on the way of friendship or love, but can be
overcome by mutual respect and interest in the thoughts, feelings and
living circumstances of the other person. That becomes especially clear
in the presentation of the relation between Maité and Henri.</P>
<P>But Téchiné's film is not a pure discourse on tolerance. "Les roseaux
sauvages" deals sensitively and believably with the relations, problems,
yearnings, fears and views of life of its young protagonists in a time
of political and personal transition. It narrates of their search of
political, social, sexual and human orientation.
Téchiné found fascinating images for that. He succeeded in making an
important, extraordinarily multi-layered film that gets along without
sentimentality or big effects. Téchiné's direction is outstanding. And
the young leads impress by very fine performances. Elodie Bouchez in the
role of Maité is especially riveting.</P>
<P>In the above-mentioned final scene the camera finds the teenagers.
They're crossing a bridge. In their search of the right way in this
difficult time they have found a bit orientation.</P>
<P>Excellent films like this one and Jacques Doillon's "Le petit criminel"
(1990), which in a very different context also treats young people's
search of stability and love, got me to pay more attention to French
cinema.</P>
<P>I give Téchiné's film a ****½ rating on the scale of five stars.</P>
<PRE>(4.5 out of 5 = Outstanding)</PRE>
