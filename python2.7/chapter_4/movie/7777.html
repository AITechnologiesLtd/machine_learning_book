<P>     TRIAL AND ERROR is a clumsy reworking of MY COUSIN VINNY, with
director Jonathan Lynn staging another small-town trial with another
exasperated judge presiding over yet another courtroomful of colorful
personalities.  In this case, its Michael Richards out-of-work actor
impersonating his best-friend lawyer (Jeff Daniel), after a bachelor
party for the latter leaves him incapacitated.  Despite the Kramer-ish
antics of Mr. Richards, some fresh flustering by VINNY veteran Austin
Pendleton (as the judge), and one howler of a testimony from Rip Torn
(as the defendant), the courtroom shenanigans end up only intermittenly
funny.  Far more interesting is the romance that develops between
Daniels' character and a waitress (played by a glowing Charleze Theron)
and a late line of thought that asks each character to examine how the
issue of truth affects them.</P>
