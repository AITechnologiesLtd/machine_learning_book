<PRE>GOODBYE, LOVER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Roland Joffé's GOODBYE, LOVER is the old tale of cross and doublecross.
Although the movie is entertaining, it's rarely fresh or imaginative.
Ron Peer's script is quite predictable, once you realize that every
relationship will contain a twist.</P>
<P>In the picture's best performance, Patricia Arquette plays a sexy,
platinum blonde named Sandra Dunmore, who plans on sleeping her way to
riches.  She loves nothing better than engaging in risky sexual
adventures.  In the opening, she sticks a Bach diskette in the church
organ and then pins the organist to the floor.  As the choir sings in
the chapel, she has intense sex with her husband's brother, Ben (Don
Johnson).  A real estate sales agent, she likes to take Ben along on
house calls when the owners are out.  She handcuffs Ben to the furniture
and has her way with him.</P>
<P>Besides being erotic, Arquette is also wonderfully quirky.  She enjoys
hamming it up as she listens to cassettes.  She repeats Anthony
Robbins's advice with him, and she sings along with Julie Andrews in THE
SOUND OF MUSIC.</P>
<P>Dermot Mulroney plays Sandra's flaky husband.  The performances by both
Mulroney and Johnson are bland and unconvincing.  Mary-Louise Parker, in
a role slightly out of character for her, plays Ben's co-worker and
possible girlfriend, Peggy.  Peggy likes sex, but prefers old Joan
Crawford movies.  Mildred Pierce is her favorite.  The scene in which
she and Ben almost make love is one of the movie's more promising ones.
But, like the rest of the movie, it is only partially successful.</P>
<P>The story's comedic role is given to Ellen DeGeneres as cynical Sgt.
Rita Pompano, who comes to the Dunmore house to investigate some
possible foul play.  Sgt. Pompano badmouths everyone and doesn't believe
any story she is told.  This trait comes in handy since truth is not
something that comes easy to the Dunmores.</P>
<P>The story, which starts off as a promisingly erotic thriller, loses its
way by the end of the first act.  Degenerating into a cinematic retread
of many movies you've seen before, it earns that kiss of death summary:
It's kind of cute.</P>
<P>GOODBYE, LOVER runs 1:42.  It is rated R for violence, profanity and sex
and would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
