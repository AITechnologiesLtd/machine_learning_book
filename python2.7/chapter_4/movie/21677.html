Starring Humphrey Bogart, Katherine Hepburn
Directed by John Huston
Year Released: 1951
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Classics rarely translate through the generations. What may have been a
spectacular journey into the unknown for audiences in the 30s and 40s might
have seemed different for those in the 60s and 70s. But whatâ€™s really
frustrating (to me personally as a movie critic) is to not be able to see what
all of the praise was about in the first place. This is how I feel about The
African Queen, one of the later Humphrey Bogart movies, and (in my opinion,
donâ€™t sue me or anything) not one of his best. While Iâ€™m sure that it
played with a much different reaction when it was first released in theaters in
1951, this is a film that (for me) has failed to translate itself for my
generation.</P>
<P>Charlie Allnut (Bogart, definitely at a change of pace from his detective movie
work) is captain of a boat that delivers mail to African colonies during World
War I. One this particular day heâ€™s delivering to a brother and sister who
run a church for the Africans and try and convert them to Christianity. Rose
Sayer (Hepburn) is uptight and religious, quite accustomed to her nice, clean
way of life. When troops (I believe German) attack the camp she is forced to
flee and join Charlie as they sail down the river. She comes up with an idea to
attack an enemy warship that Charlie eventually goes along with.</P>
<P>All the usual sorts of plot cliches happen, at first they are afraid and argue
with each other, then they start to fall in love. There are many challenges to
greet them along the way. Rapids, leeches, enemy posts, itâ€™s like the
filmmakers went through a list of all the possible dangers and checked them off
one by one. Will they survive the horrible journey? Or will the boat sink and
the two of them be gone forever? Almost all of the goings-on seemed predictable
to me.</P>
<P>I think that I have a much different view of the film than anyone viewing it
around the original time that it came out would. The cinematography is just
beautiful. The entire movie was filmed on location in Africa and the shots of
alligators jumping into the river and flamingos hopping in the water make up
some of the best parts of the movie. I also think that the film was sort of
making a point by saying that women could go on adventures and survive right
along with the men. An interesting side fact (that proves my point), the
filmâ€™s tagline is, â€œThe Greatest Adventure Man Ever Lived...With A
Woman!â€? But for all of the praise surrounding it, (Iâ€™m really in trouble
this time. Number 77 on the greatest films of all time list on IMDB and I
didnâ€™t like it.) I didnâ€™t think that anything really happened in the story,
and therefore I didnâ€™t find the film very interesting at all. While Katherine
Hepburn does give a convincing performance, I didnâ€™t think that the film was
up to par with what it could have been. Obviously I have a different view than
when original audiences viewed it. Few people knew much about Africa then, and
not many people had ever been on such a grand adventure. Despite this, I still
canâ€™t give The African Queen too much credit, so it gets ** 1/2 stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film contains some slightly scary scenes involving rapids
and thunderstorms. There is also quite a bit of drinking and a gross scene that
has to do with leeches. Good Age 12 & Up</P>
