<PRE>THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat follows the lead set by Jackie Chan
and Hong Kong directors such as John Woo, Tsui Hark and Stanley Tong in
attempting to cross over to the American mainstream.  With The
Replacement Killers, he has a vehicle that captures the style of a Hong
Kong action-fest, but with none of the substance.</P>
<P>Chow Yun-Fat plays assassin John Lee.  He's indebted to a crimelord, Mr.
Wei (Kenneth Tsang), and must perform three hits or his mother and
sister will be killed back in China.  John performs two of his three
kills, but on the third the sight of a cop (Michael Rooker) playing with
his young son makes him reconsider, and he abandons his task.</P>
<P>This, of course, greatly angers Mr. Wei, who calls in replacement
killers to finish the job, and to finish Mr. Lee.  He, on the other
hand, has no intention on being rubbed out.  He sets off to return to
China, in order to save his family, but he needs forged papers to do
so.  To that end, he enlists the aid of rogue forger Meg Coburn (Mira
Sorvino), and when her lab is destroyed by Wei's henchmen, their fates
are intertwined. So, John and Meg set out to nullify the replacement
killers, protect their target, eliminate Mr. Wei, thereby saving Lee's
family.</P>
<P>The first problem with The Replacement Killers is with Yun-Fat.  His
hitman is a flimsy construct at best, and makes Clint Eastwood's Man
With No Name seem wordy.  We learn very little about him, but the worst
part is we don't want to know.  With less emotional range than The
Terminator, his hitman exists as merely a machine to expel bullets at
the bad guys. Mira Sorvino fares better, but only slightly.  She seems
out of place here, but at least she's given a meatier character than
Yun-Fat.</P>
<P>Director Antoine Fuqua applies plenty of stylistic touches to the action
sequences. Some of the setups, though, are too obvious.  When the camera
swoops majestically down a tile corridor and into some hybrid of a
warehouse and an automatic car wash, you just know that a gun battle is
going to take place on this terrain.  When the bullets unavoidably begin
flying, the resulting carnage is shot with relish. A wide variety of
angles, lighting and camera speeds are employed to enliven the action.
At some points, the technique works, but most of the time, the
overbearing style is layered on too thickly.  In the middle of an
exciting action sequence, you shouldn't be noticing the excellent use of
discrete surround channels or the appropriately mysterious lighting
used...those things should simply enhance the atmosphere. Here, they're
noticeable.</P>
<P>And the film is in serious trouble when it has to fall back on its plot
to redeem itself. I was hard pressed to fill two paragraphs above with a
plot summary.  There are no twists and/or turns.  Nothing unexpected
happens.  The plot is a vehicle to move from one shoot-out to another,
nothing more.</P>
<P>It's a pity.  The best Hong Kong action films have plots that put most
American actioners to shame.  It's not the most auspicious American
debut for Chow Yun-Fat, and he deserves much better than this.</P>
