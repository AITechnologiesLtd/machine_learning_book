<PRE>MADE
----</PRE>
<P>Bobby (Jon Favreau, "Swingers") is an aspiring boxer who's intensely loyal
to his boyhood screwup buddy Ricky (Vince Vaughn, "Swingers"), his stripper
girlfriend Jess (Famke Janssen, "Rounders") and her young daughter Chloe
(Makenzie Vega, "The Family Man").  Bobby works as Jess's driver, but hates
having to watch her work.  When a guy gets too grabby at a private party,
Bobby boils over and a brawl ensues.  He's called in by Max (Peter Falk),
the local mob boss both he and Jess work for, and is given one last chance.
Against his better judgement (and a grudge for stolen carpet cleaning van),
Max allows Bobby to talk him into letting him partner with Ricky, but only
if he'll vouch for him, in writer/director Jon Favreau's "Made."</P>
<P>Favreau brings together elements of his "Swingers" success and a good dose
of the cast of "The Sopranos" for his feature directorial debut, "Made."
While the sharp dialogue that made his "Swingers" script such a success
can be found in Bobby and Ricky's banter, the writer/director's story stumbles
for lack of character background.</P>
<P>"Made" is" a comedic buddy road movie where two disparate green guys are
sent to the Big Apple as hired thugs to play in the big leagues of what
they believe to be a major drug drop.  While Bobby is level-headed and
responsible, Ricky is an impulsive, none too bright, self-serving blow
hard who can only be counted on to screw up any situation in as spectacular
a manner as possible.</P>
<P>The first recipient of their Mutt and Jeff routine is their flight attendant,
who finally puts Ricky in his place when he attempts to have her round up
women for their first class convenience.  Driver Jimmy (Vincent Pastore, 
Big Pussy in "The Sopranos") amazedly keeps darting his eyes in the rear
view as Ricky plays with opening and closing the barrier between limo driver 
and passengers.  Jimmy acts big with their bell boy (Sam Rockwell, "Box of
Moonlight"), flashing money for a room upgrade.  He begins squandering 
their per diem by ordering room service - from Bobby's room, of course.</P>
<P>They're brought to meet Max' client Ruiz (Sean 'Puffy' Combs), whom
Ricky immediately riles.  Given a second chance, Ruiz' right hand man
Horrace (Faizon Love, "The Replacements") tries to help the duo out, but
is horrified when Ricky uses the inside info he's given him on their
drop 'the Welshman' (David O'Hara, "Braveheart"), making fools of them
all.  Eventually, they do all make their way to the final meet in
Brooklyn with surprising results, only to be met with even more surprising
results on their return home to Jersey.</P>
<P>Favreau and Vaughn reprise their "Swingers" personas and their banter is
always entertaining.  However, Ricky's character is such a total jerk and
so completely unreliable that it's nonsensical that Bobby would ever
vouch for the guy.  Favreau the writer never provides anything that would
explain why Bobby would be so beholden to Ricky, an essential flaw of
his story, unless he means to portray Bobby as a complete patsy.  This
last supposition isn't implausible, given how Bobby's other relationships
are resolved and while the final scene provides a funny wrapup, the film
itself becomes instantly forgettable.</P>
<P>Favreau's blessed with a supporting cast who can't be faulted for his
story flaws.  Sean Combs is surprisingly natural as Ruiz, smooth and
intimidating, but not too intimidating.  Faizon Love is likeable as
Horrace and Pastore has reassuring presence as Jimmy.  Janssen is as
good as she can be with her underwritten character.  Makenzie Vega is a
child actress to watch.  Falk is stern and little else.  The film also
features Federico Castelluccio (Furio in "The Sopranos") as a bouncer
and Drea de Matteo (Adriana in "The Sopranos") as a party girl.  Jennifer
Esposito ("Summer of Sam") is the girl who changes her mind about Ricky.</P>
<P>Favreau employed no less a cinematographer than Christopher Doyle whose
stylish work in Wong Kar Wei's "In the Mood for Love" is replaced by meat
and potatoes treatment here.</P>
<P>Bobby and Ricky's squabbling routine is funny stuff.  Too bad Favreau's
"Made" never gives them a reason for being together.</P>
