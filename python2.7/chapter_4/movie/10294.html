<PRE>"It's a scream, baby!"  Or is it?</PRE>
<P>Alright, let's talk horror flicks.  Or, more specifically, horror
sequels.  They suck.  You, I, or anybody could write a cheesy
1980s-style horror sequel.  Just remember all the key ingredients: an
attractive group of horny teenagers to kill off, an unstoppable
murderer, and lots of scenes where things pop out unexpectedly while
accompanied by loud noises (referred to as "jump scenes" by those in the
know).</P>
<P>Now let's talk SCREAM.  It came out almost exactly one year ago, to a
less-than-stellar opening weekend gross.  But word of mouth spread, and
in the end SCREAM made more than 100 million dollars here in the US of
A.  It's still praised by many overzealous teens and gen-xers as being
one of the great films of our (or any) time.  This basically functions
to make it one of the most overrated movies of all time.  It was pretty
fun for what it was, which is a shocker since most horror flicks
*aren't* nowadays, and the opening scene was honestly chilling
(something most movies can't pull off).  The comedic aspect of the film
was what made it most entertaining, as it worked much better than the
majority of the horror angle.  It even had some great characters (Jamie
Kennedy's film geek "Randy Meeks" will always be treasured).  But it
also had a few *major* flaws.  The main character, Sidney Prescott
(played by Neve Campbell) was probably the worst character in the
movie.  She pulled a lot of stupid stunts like having sex with a guy and
then, afterwards, telling him that she still suspected he was the
killer.  Oh, so she didn't care about her feelings that he could be a
mass murderer, she was just out to get laid?  Aside from her bad traits,
she basically *had* no personality, leaving us a female lead who was
essentially an obnoxious and annoying little bitch/slut.  Another
problem with the movie was the KEVIN WILLIAMSON CURSE (TM), or KWC. 
This is the problem with pretty much all films that are thus far written
by Kevin Williamson which makes it so that likable characters are often
killed off and the most easy-to-hate ones (like Sidney) tend to make it
to the finale.  When that happens, you just stop caring.  How can the
supposedly tense ending be tense at all when you want the main character
to just get what she deserves anyway?  The KWC (tm) is apparent in
various forms in SCREAM, his original treatment for HALLOWEEN 7, and
now, in SCREAM 2 (I'm told by a number of sources that he did it again
in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and once again damaged the movie by
it, but since I haven't seen that movie yet, I can't be certain).  It
really makes you wonder what kind of friends this guy has that he feels
the need to make the heros of his stories obnoxious human beings and
then kills off all the nice ones.  Anyway, despite all this, SCREAM was
still fairly fun, especially in its references to other horror films and
its attempts to do away with their old cliches, and it did leave enough
of the likable people alive in the end to make it finally all add up to
being about a *** film.  Nothing overly special, but definitely
something worth seeing.</P>
<P>Okay, now, let's talk SCREAM 2.  Basically, you're getting more of the
same here.  The story is that the survivors of the first film come
together along with their friends when a copycat killer appear in
Sidney's college town.  This happens just as "Stab," the movie based on
the book that Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) wrote about the first movie's
killings, premieres (providing us with some cute in-jokes for those who
saw the first one - Tori Spelling, anyone?)  Overall, the comedy is
actually stronger than it was in the original for about the first half
of the film, but the horror (at least what there was of it) is actually
somewhat lessened.  There's no scene that compares to the opening of the
last one that just sets your nerves on edge.  In fact, characters in
this movie don't simply mock horror cliches, some of them perpetuate
them!  For example, hasn't anyone been taught *not* to run up the stairs
when you could run out the door?  Didn't Sidney point out how foolish
this is in the first film?  Still, there are scenes that have more
tension than their closest counterparts in the original had.</P>
<P>Now I'll be straight for a minute here.  I read the script for SCREAM 2
a month or two ago, and I must admit, it was mostly pretty strong.  It
would've been downright excellent if not for a few things - an extreme
case of the KWC (tm) and an ending which was so positively horrid that
it came close to ruining the entire rest of the story.  Now, in light of
the movie, let's deal with these problems.  This flick's been changed
quite a bit.  The ending is different, and I do believe it's better. 
But it's still not great.  It's way too "Scooby-Doo."  You just wait for
the killer(s) to say "And I would've gotten away with it too, if not for
you meddling kids!" or something to that effect.  Anyway, because the
ending is different, many scenes earlier in the film had to be altered,
and some of the more dramatic ones seem less tense than they were in the
script.  However, if you want to view these scenes in light of *only*
the movie itself, which is probably the smart way to go, then these two
or maybe three scenes still do have tension and are still moderately
strong in that sense.  Okay folks.  Now let's deal with the KWC...</P>
<P>I'm getting worried about Williamson.  He comes close to making SCREAM
and SCREAM 2 into being almost *great* movies, but this KWC (tm) causes
severe damage.  It really kills him.  It's what sucks him down from
making "films" or "movies" to making "flicks."  Somebody's got to teach
this guy to have some common sense.  SCREAM 2 has got the worst case of
KWC (tm) that I could've imagined.  He manages to kill off the one
character who was probably *THE* most likable one in the movie, a
character who could've stuck with the viewers and loved for years to
come if not for this act of pure idiocy.  What purpose does it serve?  I
supposed you might be able to argue that it makes the later tense scenes
more effective, giving the viewer a feeling of "well if they killed that
person off, anyone could be next!" But that just doesn't cut it.  The
audience on opening night where I saw it here in St. Louis didn't
exactly feel the tension.  The reaction was primarily a large collection
of profanity from the primarily late teens/early 20s group.  Shouts like
"What is THAT s---?!", "F--- YOU, CRAVEN!!!" and yes, even "Williamson
will BURN for that sick s---, THE LITTLE F----R!!!" were rather common. 
Well, at least you can say that Williamson *did* get an emotional
reaction from his audience.  But, for God's sake man, do you think that
*now* you'll learn that people don't want to see their favorite
character bite it? </P>
<P>Well once this character died, the humor in the movie just about died
with him/her.  Comedic moments got kind of rare without his/her jokes
and insights.  There were occasional ones, but just not as many and
certainly not as good as you got from him/her.  The greatest moment of
humor after that came when the killer(s) was/were revealed.  Can you say
cheesy?  When the audience saw who was responsible for our little trip
into flick-land, the initial response was widespread laughter.  I've
checked on the reaction at other showings in other theaters, and it was
pretty much the same.  At my own showing, shouts once again came out of
the crowd, like "I don't even know who the F--- THAT IS!!!" and "It's
SCOOBY-F---ING-DOO!!!" Yes, I feel that the choice for who the killer(s)
was/were was a pretty goofy one.  And yet, it was certainly better than
the choice(s) in the original script, by quite a lot.  And of course,
this final scene is also not exactly tense, since we don't care much
about these characters.  </P>
<P>Overall, I think that the ending and the KWC (tm), along with the loss
in comedic quality as a result of that KWC act, knocks this film down to
a level below the original.  Neither is an excellent film in any sense -
these are glorified B movies people, pure and simple.  But the first was
probably the more fun.  At least Sidney doesn't do anything as bad in
this movie as what she did in the first movie, but the thing is, she
just plain *doesn't do much* anyway.  We don't get that much of an
insight into her character.  The closest we get is seeing that she tries
to remain strong despite what's going on again around her (ultimately,
she basically fails).  Sidney does get one of the (unintentionally)
funnier scenes though, when her college acting coach (she's a drama
major it seems) tells her what a good actress she is, prompting Neve
Campbell to do a bit of... questionable acting which the professor
actually approves of.  This was another scene that got a good amount of
laughs at the showing I attended on opening night.</P>
<P>Overall, I guess SCREAM 2 will be enjoyed by those who liked the
original.  It's moderately close to the first one in quality, despite
its glaring flaws.  In a world where horror movies and particularly
horror sequels suck, this is certainly above most sequels in the genre. 
Still, the comedy aspects of both these movies is stronger than its
horror angle.  Perhaps the third and (hopefully) final installment can
emphasize the humor more?  And maybe Kevin Williamson can prove to us
that he's not a hack by fighting off his curse.  In the end, SCREAM 2 is
fun for those who attend who like these kinds of movies, like the
original, or just attend a crowded screening with people who aren't
afraid to voice their opinions.  If you didn't care for the first one or
can't see it with many people... well, you're probably better off
checking out the latest exploits of Ellen Ripley or James Bond to get
your sequel fix.</P>
<P>Oh, my new rating system (which hopefully will work) just rates a movie
based on its overall quality (expectations no longer factor in).  It's
purely star based, with four stars most likely being the higest (I might
make it go to five someday if I change my mind) and zero beings the
lowest.  That being said, I give SCREAM 2...</P>
