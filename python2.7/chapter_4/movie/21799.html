<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Question:  What do you get when you blend Gone with the Wind and Glory?</P>
<P>Answer #1:  The cinematic equivalent of Viagra for your excitable high
school history teacher that still spends his weekends reenacting the
battles of the Civil War with other middle-age losers/fanatics.</P>
<P>Answer #2:  Ride with the Devil, a movie about the Civil War made by a
Taiwanese filmmaker.</P>
<P>A Taiwanese filmmaker?  Making a Civil War picture?  Why, that sounds as
preposterous as Spaniard Antonio Banderas directing a film about 1965
Alabama!  But Ang Lee is no ordinary filmmaker.  His resume is nearly as
diverse as indie icon John Sayles, knocking out movies about the frocky
(Sense and Sensibility), retro sex (The Ice Storm), cultural contrast
(Pushing Hands), the love of food (Eat Drink Man Woman) and taboo
relationships (The Wedding Banquet).</P>
<P>Although Ride with the Devil is a remarkably beautiful film, it offers
nothing that we haven't already seen in Gone with the Wind and Glory.
It's also a balanced movie, meaning that war buffs will have to wait for
extended periods between battle scenes.  The ending is weak and the film
is not nearly emotional as it could be.  Yet, somehow, Devil is still
entertainingly captivating.</P>
<P>Based on Daniel Woodrell's novel `Woe to Live On,' the film focuses on
one Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire, Pleasantville), the son of a pro-Union
German immigrant transplanted in Missouri.  Like other Southern boys,
Jake is eager to bear arms in order to maintain their Southern way of
life.  Jake and his best friend Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich, Chill
Factor), the son of a wealthy plantation owner, join a rogue group of
Confederate fighters known as `Bushwhackers.'</P>
<P>Banded together with rich boy George Clyde (Simon Baker-Denny, L.A.
Confidential) and ex-slave Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright, Basquiat), Jake
and Jack Bull pull off a particularly savage raid of a group of the
Union soldiers believed to be responsible for the murder of Jack Bull's
father.  After the attack, the men lay low by holing up for the harsh
winter in what is essentially a cave, with a young widow named Sue Lee
Shelley (hippie songstress Jewel Kilcher) supplying their provisions.
Later, the fabulously endowed Ms. Kilcher has a provocative
breast-feeding scene that ranks as one of the best ever.</P>
<P>Adapted for the screen by The Ice Storm scribe James Schamus, Devil is a
hypnotic combination of love and war that also has a great sense of
humor.  Behind the scenes, Lee's production team creates some of the
more lush scenes of the cinematic year.  Devil's graphically violent
battle scenes are extremely well done, as is the portrayal of the
evolving friendship between Jake and Holt.  Neither is completely
trusted by their cohorts, continually having their loyalty questioned by
fellow Bushwackers despite their obvious devotion to the Southern
cause.  Holt (played in Oscar-worthy fashion by Wright) is somehow still
sympathetic to the Confederacy despite a life of slavery, while Jack is
seen as a German first and a Southerner second.  They are both victims
of ethnic intolerance.  And, yes, Spike Lee will probably blow a gasket
over the use of the dreaded `n' word.</P>
<P>2:18 - R for graphic war violence, brief nudity, adult situations and
sexual content</P>
