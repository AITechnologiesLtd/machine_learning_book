THE MEXICAN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In Gore Verbinski's THE MEXICAN, Brad Pitt, as major screwup Jerry 
Welbachan, has been sent on assignment to Mexico to bring back an 
ancient pistol called The Mexican. A would-be ex-criminal, who was 
supposed to have already done his last job, he's forced to do one more 
since he botched what should have been his last.</P>
<P>In order to make sure that nothing "funky" happens, Jerry's employer 
hires a baby sitter for his girlfriend, Samantha 'Sam' Barzel (Julia 
Roberts). A psychotic hired killer named Leroy (James Gandolfini) 
accompanies Sam on her preplanned trip to Vegas. Along the way, Sam, who 
talks like a new age relationships author, complains about Jerry, with 
whom she had broken up just before being kidnapped by Leroy. As she gets 
to know Leroy better, she shifts her pop psychological analysis from 
Jerry to Leroy, telling him, "I'm sensing that you have trust issues," 
after he is reluctant to let her go to the bathroom alone. Not 
surprisingly, Leroy turns out to have a sensitive side, which Sam loves 
nurturing.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, down in Mexico, Jerry is having a hellacious time as he tools 
around in his rented El Camino pickup -- he's asked the rental car 
agency for something more Mexican than the Chrysler that he was supposed 
to get. He is shot at, thrown in jail, ... you name it. Accompanying him 
on his travails is a mangy mutt that is part loyal dog and part Cujo.</P>
<P>Perhaps the best part of this quirky tale is the old, sepia-tone, 
speeded-up footage showing us the history behind the gun. The 
elaborately crafted gun was made long ago for the hand of a nobleman. We 
learn not one version of his legendary story but many. Jerry, however, 
doesn't have time to appreciate the weapon's background. He's way too 
busy trying to stay alive. The actors, on the other hand, all appear to 
be having a great time. And if you were worried, as I was, that the 
director wouldn't be able to make the transition from his first film, 
MOUSE HUNT, a dark kids' comedy, to a second one aimed squarely at a 
more adult audience, don't. This film is much better than MOUSE HUNT. 
And, let's face it, THE MEXICAN is an explosive movie -- exploding with 
star power. Pitt, Roberts and Gandolfini prove to be a thoroughly 
enjoyable, crowd pleasing combination.</P>
<P>THE MEXICAN runs 2:03. It is rated R for violence and language and would 
be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
