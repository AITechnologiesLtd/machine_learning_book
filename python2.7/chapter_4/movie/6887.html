                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Albert Brooks' new film is aimed at anyone who has ever had, ever been
or is thinking of ever becoming a mother. While admittedly this is a
fairly large segment of the movie-going public and the film is often
extremely charming, "Mother" is not for everyone.</P>
<P>There are no explosions, car chases or visible big guns. Broad slapstick
comedy is at a minimum. There aren't even very many outrageous rolling
on the floor laughing scenes. What there is, is an abundance of wit and
humanity that produce knowing smiles and chuckles. Looking around, you
can see the thought balloons floating above the audience members, "Yeah,
my mom does exactly the same thing."</P>
<P>Brooks plays John Henderson, a science fiction author ("Planet Seven"
and "Planet Eight" -- care to guess the title of his next book?) hitting
his mid-life crisis head on as he concludes his second divorce.
Realizing that all of his relationships with women are based on the
first woman in his life, he decides to move back in with mom to try and
figure out what's wrong.</P>
<P>Mother (Debbie Reynolds in her first leading role in over 25 years)
doesn't exactly understand what John calls his "Experiment", but goes
along with it good-naturedly albeit with something of a suspicious
attitude. Emptying out his old bedroom which has become a sewing room
(read "storage shed", because mother doesn't really sew), sonny boy digs
out his posters and trophies from high school. Shortly it looks like a
typical teenager's room in the sixties.</P>
<P>Except for a small part by John's younger, more successful and still
tied to mommy, brother (Rob Morrow), the film belongs to Brooks and
Reynolds. One or both are almost constantly on-screen and they do their
characters wonderfully. Reynolds shines as the over-bearing mother when
she offers her son antique generic orange sherbet with its "protective
ice coating" and slices a piece of frozen cheese off a block big enough
to clog the arteries of an entire town.</P>
<P>Morrow's whinny brother is adequately performed, but the actor hasn't
captured a character with much enthusiasm since his days as Dr. Joel on
"Northern Exposure".</P>
<P>Occasionally you can see the ghost of Woody Allen in the background as
Brooks, who also directed and co-wrote, mines the same relationship
territory. Although Brooks doesn't have the same timing genius, he does
seem tapped into life outside the big city more than Woody. Set in
Sausalito, the ultimate Yuppie west coast village, the film feels more
open and universally accessible that Allen's New York geocentrism.</P>
<P>There are some rough points in the film. Part of the appeal is that many
scenes are underplayed, almost like real life; but at times you will be
disappointed that the bigger pay-off is missing. The ending is tied up a
bit too neatly and could have used a little more time. </P>
<P>The story explores the subtle and sometimes not-so subtle ways that the
mother and son treat each other as symbols and archetypes rather than as
people. John's revelation comes when he realizes that his mother is not
just someone who does things to him, but an individual with hopes,
dreams and disappointments. </P>
<P>The theme of seeing beyond the masks is food for thought. The film's
message is that until adult children can do this, every day of their
life will be "mother's day".</P>
