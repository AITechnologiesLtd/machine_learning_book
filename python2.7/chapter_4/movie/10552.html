<P>Sitting in the theater, waiting for WAG THE DOG to begin, I was struck
by the number of politically-themed films are about to be released
into theaters.  The previews showed numerous films about politics,
whether it ranged from John Travolta as the President to a AS GOOD AS
IT GETS-Jack Nicholson-type politician.  Why is Hollywood suddenly so
interested in politics?  Because of the controversy, and the obvious
interest of moviegoers.  However, of the two previews I saw, neither
of them looked very interesting.  In one, Travolta plays the
President, with grey hair and all, but he still looks too young for
the role.  The other preview showed a rude President who bashes people
whenever he feels like it (but not on purpose, of course).  Neither of
these films will be as good or as entertaining as WAG THE DOG.</P>
<P>To begin, what exactly does wag the dog mean?  It may sound a little
ridiculous, but it actually gives the film a connection to the
audience.  The opening scene explains to us: "Why does a dog wag its
tail?  Because the dog is smarter than the tail.  If the tail was
smarter, then it would wag the dog."  Throughout the film, director
Barry Levinson and writers David Mamet and Hilary Henkin continually
portray your average American as the dog.  The government is the tail.
WAG THE DOG contains a fair amount of ridiculous events, but none so
far as going beyond belief.  What it does is it plays with the
audience's thoughts of government procedure.  Many people have thought
that the government is lying (more than likely, everyone), telling us
stories to explain things otherwise unexplainable.  WAG THE DOG takes
that a step further, showing us what could possibly happen.</P>
<P>WAG THE DOG begins very quickly, with White House aide Winifred Ames
(Anne Heche) leading spin doctor Conrad Brean (Robert De Niro) down a
series of underground tunnels.  Why do they need Brean?  Because the
President was caught with is pants down.  The President is being
accused of offering himself to a "Firefly Girl," and an underage one
at that.  This may or may not be true, but it doesn't matter, because
once the story hits the television, it becomes fact.  Brean figures
that they need to find something to draw the attention away from the
sexual harassment deal; perhaps, by starting a war with Albania.
Start a war?  Well, not really.</P>
<P>Brean decides that he needs someone to produce his war, and where
better to find someone to do that than in the one place that
specializes in fabricating fictional events--Hollywood.  Brean comes
across Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman), a Hollywood producer whose lack
of acknowledgment for his films has discouraged him from continuing to
produce them.  At first, Motss is apprehensive about getting involved
with the scheme, thinking it's too immense for anyone to pull it off.
However, after seeing Brean's connection to the White House, and
realizing the enjoyment of pulling off such a radical event, Motss
accepts to produce the war.  "We can't tell anyone... it's a pageant,"
Brean remarks.</P>
<P>Most of the fun of WAG THE DOG is derived from the actual production
of war-based paraphernalia.  There's the short video of a young
Albanian girl (played by Kirsten Dunst) running through a destroyed
village.  This was produced using special effects ("The same method
was used in the last Schwarzenegger film.").  There's also the
hilarious production of the musical theme, written by Willie Nelson.
In probably the funniest scene in the film, Nelson makes up a song
about the President and little girls sitting in his lap.  However, the
opposing candidate for the President's chair (Craig T. Nelson) knocks
down rumors of war, and because he said it on television, it must be
true.  Brean and Ames both declare defeat, but Motss thinks the war
just needs a second act.  "We need a hero!" he exclaims.  That hero is
Schumacher (Woody Harrelson), a fictionalized member of the
fictionalized 3-0-3 squadron, who was left behind enemy lines.  This
sparks attention from America, and the President's numbers sky-rocket
when they learn he is being brought home.</P>
<P>For a film such as WAG THE DOG to work, everything must fit together
properly.  And at the top of it must be a good screenplay.  WAG THE
DOG's is among the best of the year, with some of the sharpest
dialogue of the year.  Based on the novel "American Hero," by Larry
Beinhart, it took David Mamet (arguably the best dialogue writer ever)
and Hilary Henkin to adapt it for the screen.  The screenplay is so
witty that a lot of the humor may just go over the heads of viewers.
Some of it went over my head, but I laughed anyway.  However, most of
the humor is very sharp and, directed at politics, makes it extremely
funny.  Heck, if you can't laugh at politics...  The premise of WAG
THE DOG is among the very best of satire, and probably the best of the
year.  It seems like a ridiculous idea (the government messing with
the media), but watching WAG THE DOG, a sudden fear overwhelms you:
it's just plausible enough to really happen.  The film points fingers
at everyday Americans as being too gullible.  Anything we see on TV
must be true, but WAG THE DOG shows it as being falsified by the
government in order to ensure the President's success.</P>
<P>This is Dustin Hoffman's second film this year about using the media
to gain attention for someone, but in WAG THE DOG, he gives the best
performance I have seen him give since TOOTSIE.  Hoffman has so much
enthusiasm in the film that it vastly contrasts the uptight De Niro.
De Niro also gives a very good performance, but much more subdued than
he normally is.  De Niro and Hoffman play well of each other, and to
add to that, there's a load of big-name stars in small roles.  Anne
Heche is wonderful as Winifred Ames, a colorful and vibrant character
whose hard outside persona hides a vulnerable side.  In smaller roles
are Kirsten Dunst (whom I would have gladly liked to see more of) as
the actress hired to play an Albanian, Wood Harrelson as "The Old
Shoe" hero (his psycho performance is entertaining, but very limited),
James Belushi, William H. Macy as an NSA official, Michael Belson as
the President (only seen from behind and out of focus shots), Jay
Leno, Craig T. Nelson, Denis Leary, and Willie Nelson.  All of these
performances are good, and the film shows that big-name stars will
take small roles just to be in it.</P>
<P>WAG THE DOG is rated R for language.  Director Barry Levinson has
produced a remarkably funny film on a remarkably small budget.  The
direction is tight and crisp, but never reveals itself.  The music by
Mark Knopfler was a little annoying at first, but quickly it took
ahold of my attention and gave the film an added bonus.  It's really a
catchy soundtrack.  However, there are some minor flaws in the film.
The cinematography occasionally draws attention to itself with strange
camera movements, and the ending is a little depressing.  I question
whether or not the screenplay ended correctly, but it ends with a
satirical approach to dark humor, and it ends up being funny anyway.
Overall, WAG THE DOG is probably the best bet for a comedy right now,
and definitely in the line-up for Oscar contenders.</P>
