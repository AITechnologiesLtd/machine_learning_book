<P>     Big-time Christmas Day releases have a history of disappointing 
(remember THE GODFATHER PART III?), so it comes as no surprise that THE 
EVENING STAR, the follow-up to James L. Brooks' phenomenally-successful, 
Oscar winning, 1983 feature, TERMS OF ENDEARMENT,  is a bust.  
Essentially, this is a big-screen soap opera that tries too hard, too 
often, and too ineffectually to open the tear ducts.  </P>
<P>     To start with, let me freely admit that I'm not a great fan of 
TERMS OF ENDEARMENT.  It's a little too manipulative for my taste, and 
even the flood of strong performances can't completely redeem the 
pedestrian story.  In many ways, THE EVENING STAR is cut from the same 
cloth, but there's one important difference:  the skill evident in 
crafting the first film is entirely absent here.  This time around, the 
performances are workmanlike, the screenplay (by STEEL MAGNOLIAS' 
screenwriter, Robert Harling, and based on the Larry McMurtry novel) is 
lifeless, and the direction (also by Harling, in his feature debut in 
this capacity) is confused. </P>
<P>     A lot of leftovers are served around the holidays, and THE EVENING 
STAR has its share.  Shirley MacLaine, looking suitably aged, is back as 
Aurora Greenway, as is Jack Nicholson as astronaut Garrett Breedlove in 
a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo.  A number of other characters have the 
same names, but different faces.  The three Horton children -- Melanie 
(Juliette Lewis), Tommy (George Newbern), and Teddy (MacKenzie Astin) -- 
have grown up, so it's natural that the actors have changed.  Patsy and 
Rosie, on the other hand, were adults in 1983, so it's a little harder 
to explain why Miranda Richardson and Marion Ross have replaced Lisa 
Hart Carroll and Betty King. (I'd like to think that the original actors 
had the good sense not to do the sequel; in reality, however, they 
probably weren't offered the parts.)  </P>
<P>     Unfortunately, returning characters aren't the only familiar aspect 
of THE EVENING STAR, because huge chunks of the storyline have been 
recycled from TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, right down to the central family 
struggle.  In the original, the love/hate relationship was between 
Aurora and her daughter, Emma (Debra Winger).  This time around, the 
participants are Aurora (once again) and Emma's daughter, Melanie.  The 
only significant difference is that Melanie doesn't have a terminal 
disease.</P>
<P>     The re-tread plot goes something like this:  Aurora is involved in 
an ongoing feud with Melanie, who's in a dead-end relationship with a 
would-be actor boyfriend (Scott Wolf).  Melanie moves out, but, when she 
discovers that her boyfriend is being unfaithful, she moves back in.  
Meanwhile, Aurora takes time out on a regular basis to visit Tommy, 
who's in prison.  And she watches with clenched teeth as Melanie pours 
out her heart to Patsy, rather than to her.  When she gets trapped by a 
bout of depression, Aurora's busybody maid, Rosie, tricks her into 
seeing a therapist (Bill Paxton) with a mother-fixation.  They sleep 
together, which leads to a series of contrived complications.</P>
<P>     The entire film consists of marginally-related and largely-
uninvolving episodes strung together.  None of these really go anywhere, 
but we're not supposed to care.  The film's producers think it's enough 
that we're with familiar characters in a familiar setting.  However, the 
men and women populating THE EVENING STAR are caricatures of those in 
TERMS OF ENDEARMENT.  Cheap jokes and mawkish sentimentality abound 
here, and calling these characters paper-thin is crediting them with too 
much depth.  The tacked-on ending, which takes place some six years 
after the main story, has only one aim:  bring out the Kleenexes and 
handkerchiefs.  It, like the bulk of the movie, doesn't work.  In fact, 
not one of the "emotional" moments in this film provides a satisfactory 
catharsis.</P>
<P>     For the most part, the acting matches the writing.  Shirley 
MacLaine, who won an Oscar as Aurora for TERMS, is almost unwatchable.  
Miranda Richardson is painfully over-the-top, and Juliette Lewis gives 
her typical one-note performance.  The normally-reliable Bill Paxton 
looks like he'd rather be chasing tornadoes.  By the time Jack Nicholson 
appears (about one-hundred minutes into the film) to liven up the 
proceedings, THE EVENING STAR is long past the point of resuscitation.</P>
<P>     Because of its poor construction and shockingly dumb script, even 
those who number themselves among TERMS OF ENDEARMENT's fans are likely 
to have serious reservations.  Anyone who disliked the original, or who 
is offended by tearjerkers in general, will find this motion picture 
unbearable.  </P>
