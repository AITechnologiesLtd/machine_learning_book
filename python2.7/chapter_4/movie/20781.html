<PRE>Blue Streak (PG-13) **
Starring Martin Lawrence, Luke Wilson
Directed by Les Mayfield
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>For being an early fall movie, Blue Streak strikes quite a few resemblances.
Obviously, there's the Beverly Hills Cop factor, which seems to supply most of
the action plot, and fast-talking bad-mouthed African-Americans to this movie.
Then there's Rush Hour who teamed up the unlikely pair of Chris Tucker (Martin
Lawrence in this picture) and Luke Wilson (an interesting choice.) While the
movie leans heavily on the success of these pictures, it isn't as funny or no
where near as good as the other two.</P>
<P>Miles Logan (Lawrence, jumpstarting his career again and making a big comeback)
is a jewel thief who happens to hide his rock while being chased by the police
in the third floor of a soon-to-be-constructed building. When he is released
from jail two years later, he discovers that the building he hid it in is now
the Los Angeles police department. When trying to sneak in as a pizza delivery
man doesn't work, he hires a friend to make him a fake badge so he can go in
and retrieve his prize.</P>
<P>But when he tries to enter the vent (where he hid it) through the ladies
restroom, he accidentially captures a criminal that was about to escape. The
chief notices his skills immediately and soon makes him the head of burglary.
Teaming him up with Carlson, (Wilson) a cop who he's supposed to help (he
recently got promoted) he must fight crime on the streets.</P>
<P>Eventually one things leads to another and Miles has to get his diamond from a
big package of heroin that an evil drug lord has. Will he save the day? Will he
get caught? These are all shocking questions...</P>
<P>You might as well just watch the trailer for Blue Streak, it shows everything
that's funny and action-packed in the movie. The rest is full of stupid scenes
that we're supposed to laugh at that are too much like the two films that I
mention earlier. The film's ending is not exactly a stroke of genius either.
Lawrence is good, I especially liked him as the pizza delivery man, and I'm
sure that he'll be appearing in more comedies soon. As for the rest of the cast
(including the usually good Wilson,) they are cast aside as this is obviously
Martin's picture. Just a so-so rating for Blue Streak, which gets ** stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: An incredible amount of language for a PG-13 movie and lots of
action and innuendo. Good Age: 13 & Up</P>
