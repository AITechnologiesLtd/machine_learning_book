<P>Neil LaBute is a talented writer and director and I noticed it right away when
I saw his directorial debut, "In the Company of Men," a lacerating black comedy
about man's inhumanity towards women, and men. I've seen the film twice and I
was both shocked and gratified by the film's depiction of its characters,
especially the insensitive, insulting Chad, marvelously played by Aaron
Eckhart. "Your Friends and Neighbors" is LaBute's second effort, and it is less
angry and less intoxicating than it should have been. I am shocked to say this,
but LaBute has crafted a fairly, dare I say, tame and flat film of little
consequence. </P>
<P>The film begins with people who have no interest in developing healthy
relationships with each other. We see the contemptuous, masculine, arrogant
Cary (Jason Patric) who prepares for a date by practicing his lines in bed
while writhing with faux pleasure. There's also Man (played by Ben Stiller) who
tries desperately to please his wife (Catherine Keener) but she doesn't like it
when he talks while copulating - "F---ing is not a time for sharing". When she
has an affair, she coldly states that the best part of sex is the silence. In
retribution, Man pursues another guys wife (a bland Amy Brenneman), who wants
desperately to find a man who can maintain an erection. Brenneman's husband
(played by a porcine, mustached Aaron Eckhart) can't seem to satisfy his wife
so he masturbates, even while she's in bed - he gets more pleasure from himself
than with anyone else. However, when they go shopping together, he insists that
the best method of resuscitating their sex life is to "treat each other like
meat". </P>
<P>"Your Friends and Neighbors" is LaBute's attempt to show that relationships
have no saving grace, and that the partners gradually grow bored with each
other. Unfortunately, his characters lack sting and depth - they are glamorous
nobodies wafting through their existence with no desire or interest in each
other. This is quite a cynical point to make, but LaBute infuses this tale with
a static charge that renders everything as flat and monotonous. The movie is
devoid of color and humor, and the characters emerge as vapid ciphers. Compare
this to Woody Allen's "Manhattan" and "Deconstructing Harry" and you'll see
that Woody goes well beyond the primary cynicism - he explores what makes his
characters tick. </P>
<P>As a writer, LaBute does have some witty, anarchic moments, though. There is
the running gag of an art-gallery assistant (Nastassja Kinski) who stares at
the same unseen art object with each of the main characters - they ask her the
same questions with the same exact responses. Then there's the undeniably
well-cast Jason Patric (doing some of his best work since "After Dark, My
Sweet") as the meanest, least likable character since Chad from "In the Company
of Men." Patric has two virtuoso scenes: one set in a locker room with his
friends where he confesses that a homosexual encounter in high school was the
best lay he ever had, and another scene where he mutilates Keener with such
piercing words that she is reduced to tears - an interesting scene because it
shows that Keener may not be such a frigid woman after all. </P>
<P>Beyond some frank sexual talk and manners, Your Friends and Neighbors is dull
to sit through and the characters are ill-defined and impossible to care about.
LaBute is still a talent to watch for but he needs to imbue his characters with
some degree of humanity so that his dialogue can cut some fairly deep wounds in
all of us. "In the Company of Men" could have been a sick joke about teasing a
deaf woman and then dumping her for the sake of revenge, but LaBute was after
bigger game and revealed some strong character personalities. "Your Friends and
Neighbors" is about people who screw each other with no rhyme or reason. It's
just a sick joke. </P>
