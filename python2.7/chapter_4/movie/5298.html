                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1988)</PRE>
<P>        What do you get when you cross A CHRISTMAS CAROL with GHOSTBUSTERS?
The answer: a confused and overblown comedy with an identity crisis, such
as director Richard Donner's SCROOGED.  Although SCROOGED aspires to be a
modern day version of Charles Dickens' classic tale, A CHRISTMAS CAROL, the
film seems as if it would rather be a GHOSTBUSTERS sequel.  The movie is
overwrought with big-budget special effects that look good but add nothing
to the story.</P>
<P>        SCROOGED stars Bill Murray as Frank Cross, the youngest network
president in television history.  Cross is a real S.O.B.; he is greedy,
mean-spirited, and merciless.  Following the general story line of Dickens'
novel, Cross encounters the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future,
who give him a chance to reevaluate his life and change his ways.</P>
<P>        Murray's performance in SCROOGED is adequate, but nothing special.
He is fine when his role calls for humor.  In the film's dramatic scenes,
however, Murray fails to give his character emotional conviction.  Perhaps
Donner is at fault for not pushing SCROOGED far enough in any one
direction.  The movie never really decides whether it wants to be a
dramatic, yet comic, re-telling of A CHRISTMAS CAROL or an all-out
slapstick parody of it.  The film's ambivalence prevents it from completely
succeeding either dramatically or comically.  Although SCROOGED is fairly
entertaining and funny, it is also extremely uneven.  The drama, for the
most part, is unconvincing and never catches fire.  And throughout the
film, the extravagant (but unnecessary) special effects distract from the
story.</P>
<P>        While Murray may be somewhat disappointing in his comeback role,
the rest of the cast in SCROOGED is magnificent; in fact, the supporting
performances and the unending string of cameos are almost enough by
themselves to make the film worthwhile.  Robert Mitchum, Bobcat Goldthwait,
and David Johansen are among the many actors who help to enliven SCROOGED.
Carol Kane almost steals the entire movie in her 25 minute sequence as the
petite, but physically abusive, Ghost of Christmas Present.  The cameos in
SCROOGED come fast and furious--so stay on your toes.  SCROOGED is also
worthwhile for its witty parody of television.  The programming on Murray's
network yields some of the funniest moments in the entire movie.</P>
<P>        Overall, SCROOGED is a mixed bag.  It does contain several
rewarding performances and genuine laughs, but you have to pay for them by
sitting through the movie's failed drama, low humor, and pacing problems.
SCROOGED came close to winning me over, but ultimately its rewards just
weren't enough to compensate for its frustrations.</P>
