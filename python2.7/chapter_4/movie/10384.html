<PRE>Jackie Brown (1997)</PRE>
<P>Director: Quentin Tarantino
Cast: Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Bridget Fonda,
Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, Chris Tucker
Rated R: Profanity, sex, drugs, violence</P>
<P>by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>    Only Quentin Tarantino can make violence, drugs, lust, and bad
people this appealing. There's something so witty and downright fun
about these evil people and the horrible things they do. They way they
talk to each other in profanity-laden inner-city dialect, the way they
can't even manage a sentence without some kind of mind-altering chemical
running through their veins, the way murder and sex are used as
thoughtless tools--these elements, though completely unpleasant in
theory, always manage to make themselves likable in a film by Tarantino.
Jackie Brown obviously is no exception to this observation. It's a two
and a half our character study on a bunch of people that, for the most
part, are rather despicable.</P>
<P>    First, there's Ordell, a drug-pushing criminal who kills people in
his sleep. Played by Samuel L. Jackson with that kind of volatile
hilarity that only Jackson can manage successfully, we laugh at Ordell
even though he's a psychopathic monster. Every bit of concern and
consideration he shows is ultimately for his own good--he cares for no
one.</P>
<P>    Ordell's partner in crime is Louis (Robert De Niro). Louis is slow,
probably because he takes in more marijuana smoke than air. Louis is
also a murderous psycho, but only out of instinct. The flashes of
violence he shows are clearly beyond his control, although he can't
express this disability of his because he has basically no control over
the English language.</P>
<P>    Ordell's "surfer girl" is Melanie (Bridget Fonda) whose existence is
limited mostly to smoking, watching TV, and having sex with whomever is
nearby. She also likes to make people mad by patronizing them, and she
has no loyalty to anyone.</P>
<P>    There are some nice people, though. Pam Grier plays the title
character, a luckless flight attendant who gets nailed by a couple of
cops (Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen) with $50,000 in her bag. She has
the money because she's a carrier for Ordell; she makes very little
money as a flight attendant, but Ordell pays her well. The cops try to
cut her a deal, but she resists. Ordell, of course, thinks she's going
to rat him out, so he tries to kill her and fails.</P>
<P>    From this point on, the characters engage in a twisted sort of tag,
in which everyone is out to get a certain sum of money from Ordell.
Jackie enlists the help of the other nice character in the film, Max
Cherry (Robert Forster, in the film's best performance), who is Ordell's
bail bondsman and an ex-cop, and they manage to play everyone else.</P>
<P>    This film is so entertaining and energetic that I found myself
completely submerged in its reality through the entire running time. The
characters all have such strong chemistry among one another that
watching them interact in this conniving, back-stabbing manor is
embarrassingly fun. The relationship between Max and Jackie is
especially well-done, and surprisingly moving towards the end.
Tarantino's characterizations are right on, and he never misses a beat
with his calculated direction.</P>
<P>    I've heard some people say this film is boring; others talk about
the fact that it centers around immorality and that none of the
characters have any redeeming qualities. If you find this film dull and
overlong, then there's not much I can say--you must have some kind of
resistance to well-written and fleshed-out characters. If you don't like
these people and despise their actions, then that's even more of a
reason to see this film. In the last ten minutes, Tarantino makes it
perfectly clear that he doesn't condone the actions of these people. I
felt pretty safe in his hands knowing that the people in the film that I
liked would come out of the situation unscathed.</P>
