<P>Q:  I've heard that "Toy Story 2" is better than the original.  Is this 
true?
A:  "Better" is relative.  The first edition did the work of establishing 
the characters, and the score was more solid.  "2" takes risks like adding 
new characters and sending nearly the whole cast on the road to rescue 
Woody.  The sequel has more action scenes, probably because Hollywood 
believes we viewers will surely be satisfied by more action.  On the whole, 
it's a very impressive film, and I wouldn't think an Oscar nomination would 
be far-fetched.</P>
<P>Q:  What was your favorite part?
A:  The animation never fails to amaze me.  I think the pioneers of cartoons 
would be fascinated by this technology.  Sometimes it's like seeing an 
exhibit of photorealist paintings:  you have to keep reminding yourself 
these images have been created!  I also like all the material put in for 
Boomers.  My wife was particularly impressed by the detail given to the old 
"Woody's Roundup" show - lunchboxes and record players and novelty toys, 
everything resembling kid stuff from 40 years ago.  So hype is not new.  My 
11 year-old daughter liked Woody's sidekick Jessie, the strong-willed 
cowgirl voiced by Joan Cusack.  And both my children liked the "Star Wars" 
and "Jurassic Park" allusions.  (When Mr. Potato Head - voiced by Don 
Rickles - threw his hat, I wasn't the only one to think "Oddjob.")</P>
<P>Q:  So what's the plot, basically?
A:  While he's rescuing a rubber penguin named "Wheezy" from a yard sale, 
Woody (Tom Hanks) accidentally ends up in the hands of a toy collector and 
dealer.  This slimy character, Al (voiced ably by Wayne Knight), actually 
steals Woody, after Andy's mom pulls the sheriff doll from the sale.  To sum 
up, the main plot consists of the main characters Buzz Lightyear (Tim 
Allen), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and Rickles as the 
potato, trying to locate and retrieve Woody.  The complications include 
Woody's discovery that he's a classic doll from the Howdy Doody era, worth 
much money to a toy museum in Japan, which is willing to pay the wily Al 
generously.  His reunion with Jessie, a sister-like pal, Bullseye the loyal 
and fleet horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammer) is 
intriguing, especially the grainy segments of the television show featuring 
the marionette-like dolls doing routines as simple as the ones Andy does 
with his dolls.  At one point Woody can't decide whether 'tis nobler to wear 
out in the hands of a loving child, or be preserved with his old-time 
buddies behind museum glass.</P>
<P>Q:  How about the non-animation aspects of the movie?
A:  The script is better written than many live-action movie scripts.  The 
dialogue is snappy and quirky, developing the characters easily.  It's a 
very kid-friendly film, a fact welcome in these days when most offerings in 
a mutiplex are R ratings.  There are probably fewer jokes per minute in this 
film, but as I've said, a little more action.  The music is still strong, 
but the two reprises of "You've Got a Friend" (one by Robert Goulet as 
Wheezy!) suggest the original movie has the edge in score.  Camera - or 
computer - angles are inventive and consistently clever, using the best 
options of the medium.</P>
<P>Q:  Tom Hanks or Tim Allen?
A:  Again, relative.  Whoever you like.  They are both so well cast!  Hanks' 
Woody seems natural with virtually any character he encounters;  there's a 
charming scene in which he puts Andy's real puppy through a series of 
tricks, and rubs the dog's belly until its leg waves in scratching.  Tim 
Allen is expert at Buzz's bravado;  the spaceman realizes he's a toy, and 
it's hilarious when he meets another Buzz doll, with the same voice, who has 
not been informed of the truth.</P>
<P>Q:  Here's an important question.  Will you buy the video?
A:  A sure thing.  It will be a great one to watch again and again, 
especially if you have kids.  It's as good as any Disney except, perhaps, 
"Beauty and the Beast."  John Lasseter and his co-directors have put scads 
of care and work into this production, and the jokes and cultural references 
alone are enough to qualify it as a classic.  Recommended for all ages, this 
movie is a sure bet to entertain parents and kids out for a nice afternoon, 
teens on a group date, or seniors, who will love a cameo by Geri of the 
chess cartoon "Geri's Game."</P>
