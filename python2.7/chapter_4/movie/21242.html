SANDS OF IWO JIMA
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Many years ago I used to watch television show hosted by
Irish comedian Dave Allen. One of the gags in that shows
parodied American WW2 movies, featuring tough sergeant,
determined to mold bunch of his soldiers into single combat
organism. The scene had been funny in its own sense, but
only after many years I managed to find the source of the
inspiration. If parody could be viewed as an ultimate form
of flattery, Allen must have liked SANDS OF IWO JIMA, 1949
war film directed by Allan Dwan and one of the best known
examples of that particular genre.</P>
<P>The movie plot deals with the platoon of US marines in the
Pacific Theatre of WW2. The year is 1943, and Sergeant John
N. Stryker (played by John Wayne), platoon leader and
battle-hardened veteran of Gualdacanal Campaign, receives
new group of fresh, inexperienced marines. He begins
training them for the upcoming battles in the island-hopping
campaign and he trains them very hard, bullying them at
every opportunity. Since Stryker happens to be embittered
man after his family leaving him, many question his real
motives. But Stryker's hard lessons become very valuable for
the men when they experience their own baptism of fire
during the landing on Tarawa Island.</P>
<P>This film is often referenced as an example of militaristic
propaganda in Hollywood. On the surface, it really looks
like the canticle for American military and the
scriptwriters Harry Brown and James Edward Grant spare no
effort to teach the viewers about patriotism, self-sacrifice
and other virtues that embody US Marine Corps. On the other
hand, they were subtle enough to allow characters to be more
than one-dimensional. John Wayne, who was often seen as
embodiment of American gung-ho militarism, gave rather
realistic performance here; his Sergeant Stryker is tough,
capable and very valuable to men in combat, but he is hardly
a superman nor a perfect human being. His "Oscar" nomination
for this role was well- deserved, although some scenes
contained unnecessary sappiness. The other actors are
shadowed by him, especially those playing stereotypical
ethnic characters that were obligatory ingredient to this
type of film. The real value of this film is not in the
acting, though. Director Allan Dwan did a really impressive
job in editing documentary war footage into the film, and
the black-and-white photography works splendidly, making
SANDS OF IWO JIMA one of the most realistic and exciting war
films of that era. On the other hand, Dwan's zeal towards
authenticity has hurt the film - some of the real life
Marines and heroes of Iwo Jima appear in cameo roles playing
themselves and their wooden, uninspired performances shatter
the illusion. Which is real shame, because this celluloid
monument to US Marines could have been as impressive work of
as the one made of bronze.</P>
