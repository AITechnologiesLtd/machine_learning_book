Modern Times (1936)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 92</PRE>
<P>"Modern Times" is Charlie Chaplin's last silent film.
It is my favorite of his movies, at least of those that I've
seen.  It has several outstanding sets, and a great score.
There are also many clever gags, and the Tramp character
is, as always, both funny and affecting, often at the 
same time.</P>
<P>"Modern Times" begins with the Tramp working in a factory.
Repetitive motion causes a nervous breakdown.  He loses his
job, and ends up in jail.  Released for good behaviour,
he befriends an equally poor but spirited young woman
(Paulette Goddard).  They dream of a better life, but their
actual efforts just seem to get them in and out of trouble.</P>
<P>The sets for this film are superb.  The factory has a
conveyer belt assembly line, leading to a marvelous 
conglomerate of gears and levers.  Chaplin, and later another
employee, get stuck in this immense set to great effect.
Another wonderful contraption is an automatic feeding device
that the Tramp is strapped to, and when this device malfunctions
it is the funniest part of the film.  A dilapated old house,
and various levels of a department store also make great sets.</P>
<P>One problem that most silent films have is that the original
score has been lost or replaced, if it ever existed.  Since
"Modern Times" is the last significant silent, falling well
inside the sound era, the soundtrack has been preserved, and
the score (by Caplin and Alfred Newman) is much better than 
anything John Williams has ever composed.</P>
<P>Goddard has a lot of energy, and makes an appealing sidekick
for Chaplin's Tramp character.  No wonder she also starred in
his next film, "The Great Dictator".</P>
<P>Surprisingly, "Modern Times" was not nominated for any
Academy Awards.  Perhaps the Academy was annoyed because
it was a silent picture.</P>
