<PRE>Cinema Uprising by Steve Evans</PRE>
<P>Dogma  Written and directed by: Kevin Smith. Starring Linda Fiorentino, Matt
Damon, Ben Affleck, Chris Rock, Alan Rickman, George Carlin, Salma Hayek,
Jason Mewes, Alanis Morisette, Smith and assorted surprise cameos.</P>
<P>The pitch: a woman suffering a crisis of faith must stop two fallen angels
from sneaking back into Heaven and thereby negating existence in this
ribald, raunchy and occasionally provocative satire of Roman Catholicism by
the director of Clerks.</P>
<P>By turns gleefully offensive, juvenile and, yes, even brilliant, this edgy
comic parable doesn't deserve the hail of criticism raining from some
(non-official) segments of the Catholic Church. A contingent of bishops,
meanwhile, is calling for a boycott. Verily, film fans, here is the gospel:
those who lose or even doubt their faith after seeing this film didn't have
a strong grasp on it to begin with. The director is clearly a religious man,
if not a devout Catholic in the traditional sense. And he knows the Bible
better than some of his critics. His intent here is to question the
machinations and politics of the church, not the underlying principles of
faith that members embrace for meaning in their lives. And Smith doesn't
push as far as he could have gone: his camera never even enters a sanctuary.
No blasphemy has been committed here, although the picture is assuredly not
for all tastes. Perhaps the greatest offense, though, comes from people who
would condemn Dogma without seeing it. We can't do anything about that,
since willful ignorance and hypocrisy are not crimes in this country. Then
again, neither is blasphemy. Smith's great success is he removes religion
from the holier-than-thou hands of official church spokesmen and turns
possession over to the clumsy and imperfect people who must live in this
world.</P>
<P>Fiorentino stars as Bethany, a world-weary worker at an abortion clinic. One
of the movie's quiet ironies is Bethany's infertility. Alone in bed, she
receives a message from God in the form of a fireball that turns into Alan
Rickman (recall the terrorist leader in Die Hard). The sensible Bethany
blasts a fire extinguisher at the intruder, then threatens to crown him with
a baseball bat. She cools off when Rickman unfurls his wings and tells her
to settle down. Affecting a fey English accent, he explains that Bethany
must stop a pair of fallen angels (Damon and Affleck) from passing beneath
the archway of a renovated church in New Jersey. These wicked angels once
were God's messengers of doom – the fiery Old Testament stuff - but they
fell from Her favor and She banished them to…Wisconsin. Eager to regain
entrance to the Kingdom of Heaven after spending millennia in the land of
cheese, they discover a loophole in Catholic dogma.  If Damon and Affleck
walk through the church in Jersey, they may have a plenary indulgence – what
Catholics call instant forgiveness for all sins – which entitles direct
admission into Heaven. Problem is, that would show God is fallible. And that
would trigger an outcome worse than the apocalypse - all would cease to
exist.</P>
<P>The cardinal of the church (George Carlin, having a blast) plans to
rededicate his sanctuary to God with a new marketing campaign endorsed by
the Vatican – Catholicism Wow! At a press conference, Carlin unveils a
statue of the Buddy Christ, a grinning, winking figure with a prominent
thumbs up. Buddy is a new totem for a new generation bored with the
traditional symbols and rituals of the church (The posture of Buddy Christ
also bears passing resemblance to Mr. Natural, the brain-addled philosopher
in Robert Crumb's underground comics. That, if anything, might rankle the
devout, assuming they are hip to the subreference).</P>
<P>Back in Wisconsin, Damon enjoys toying with the fragile faithful. Wandering
through an airport like some sinister Hare Krishna, he convinces a nun that
she has wasted her life. Soon the poor sister heads off in search of a
one-night stand and fashionable clothing. Damon and Affleck snicker at their
mischief.</P>
<P>Bethany seems a strange choice to stop a pair of rotten angels. She is a
reluctant hero, preferring to tithe her salary from Planned Parenthood to
the church. Only when her life is saved by two unlikely prophets, Jay and
Silent Bob (Mewes and director Smith), does she believe in the urgency of
her mission. Jay and Silent Bob are recurring characters in all of the
director's films. Jay is coarse and chatty, a stoner with a sharp, foul
tongue who cannot conceal his basic cluelessness. And he damn-near steals
the film. As Silent Bob, Smith has three words of dialogue in the entire
picture, but his range of facial expressions can bring down the house. They
hook up with Bethany after she is attacked outside the abortion clinic by
three teenage demons wielding hockey sticks. After Jay and Silent Bob
dispatch the thugs, Bethany wants to know why they're hanging around an
abortion clinic.</P>
<P>`We thought it would be a good place to meet loose women,' Jay declares.</P>
<P>Together, this triumvirate is joined by Rufus, the 13th apostle (Chris Rock)
who literally falls from the sky to help them.</P>
<P>Rufus says his role was left out of the Bible because he's black. He also
claims Jesus once told him the meaning of life during a wedding reception in
Cana, `but I got drunk and forgot it.'</P>
<P>They meet a stripper-muse (the delectable Hayek). She claims to be the
inspiration for 19 of the 20 top-grossing movies of all time. But she won't
take credit for Home Alone.</P>
<P>`Someone sold their soul to Satan to get the grosses up on that piece of
crap,' she declares.</P>
<P>Extending the metaphor, the heroes are soon attacked by an excrement demon
that rises from a toilet and, well…what's a Kevin Smith movie without a
little potty humor?</P>
<P>While Bethany and her holy helpers ponder how to fight the demon, Damon and
Affleck make their way across the country, spreading murder and mayhem. The
fallen angels crash a board meeting of The Mooby Corporation, a company
clearly modeled after Disney (which passed on distributing this film,
fearing the ensuing controversy). Damon berates the board members. Enjoying
the power of omnipotence, he chronicles their private sins and then
slaughters them all, splattering their blood on the corporate mascot -- a
golden calf wearing Mickey Mouse pants.</P>
<PRE>Well, we get the idea.</PRE>
<P>Smith's screenplay is crammed with pop-cultural references, both sly and
obvious, from Star Wars characters to ancient commercials for floor wax. At
times, we wonder if he might be trying too hard, especially during the
longish second hour when each character gets to deliver a speech (sermon?)
that earnestly explains the importance of faith – regardless of religious
denominations.</P>
<P>The director also wobbles at the climax, when Affleck and Damon lay waste to
a city block surrounding the church. These and other scenes of jarring
violence seem out of place in a comedy. The bloodshed throws off the tone of
the film – illustrating once again that, as with most art forms, less is
more. When the point is made, move on.</P>
<P>Perhaps Smith is struggling to maintain his momentum. Maybe he'll sustain
that high note in his next film. But in Dogma, after soaring completely over
the top with two hours of anarchic excess, he literally ends with a squeak
when Alanis Morisette arrives for her cameo as God. Morisette may be an
impassioned vocalist, but she's no actor. And a movie that wants to push the
satirical limit needs a climax that packs an ungodly wallop and an almighty
bang, not the thespian exertions of a rank amateur.</P>
<P>Rated R for constant foul language, scatological humor, brief (but potent)
violence.</P>
