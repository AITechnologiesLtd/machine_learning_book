'The Waterboy'</PRE>
<PRE>by Simon Calloway</PRE>
<P>Cast: Adam Sandler; Kathy Bates; Henry Winkler; Fairuza Balk</P>
<P> I have read numerous critical reviews on The Waterboy.  Enough negative ones
to rate this film the worst movie of the year.  Now, in my oppinion, I don't
think it is the worst.   More like the second to worst.</P>
<P> Yes, everything you've heard about Waterboy is true.  It is an unfunny,
jaw-droppingly stale piece of toast of a comedy, but, what did you expect from
the star of such other bombs as Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer. 
(Waterboy was likely dug up from script-reject hell after the success of
Wedding Singer.)</P>
<P> A huge hit within the male 10-12 category, Waterboy is a fairly simple movie. 
Bobby (Sandler) is a "waterboy"  for a college football team in his hometown. 
He lives with his mother (Bates; does she need work this bad?) in a small cabin
in the middle of a swamp, and is rather physically challanged.  Did I mention
he is, I think it was,  31 years old.</P>
<P> When the coach (Winkler, never looking more at home) finds out about Bobby's
enormous tackling abilities, he puts Bobby on the team, and they start to win
all their games.</P>
<P> That's it.  Not much else is circulating in this film, aside the ominous
sexual jokes and Bobby's slurred speech.  While in the theater viewing this
film, I heard laughing I had never heard before.  It was so loud and forced, it
made me wonder if that person was actually getting an hilarious response from
the movie, or if he was just a Sandler fan who felt bad for the actor and felt
he had to laugh at all the jokes, even the unintended ones</P>
<P> The Waterboy is very juvenile.  Only kids are likely to like this waterlogged
movie, yet they are hardly the right age for Sandler's frank blue humor.  But,
compaired to Happy Gilmore, Waterboy is Lawernce of Arabia.</P>
