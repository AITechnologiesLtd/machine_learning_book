Office Space **1/2
rated R
starring Ron Livingston, Gary Cole, Jennifer Aniston, David Herman, Ajay
Naidu, Stephen Root
written and directed by Mike Judge</PRE>
<P>"What would you do if you had a million dollars?" asks a character in Mike
Judge's awkward satire OFFICE SPACE. "Two chicks at the same time," answers
the other. Right from the start, Judge makes sure you know that this movie
is from the creator of the controversial animated TV program BEAVIS AND
BUTT-HEAD(and co-creator of KING OF THE HILL). But despite being at times
very funny and very entertaining, OFFICE SPACE fails to live up to it's
creator's potential.</P>
<P>Based on Judge's animated shorts "Milton", OFFICE SPACE tells the story of
Peter Gibbons(Ron Livingston), a young computer programmer at a large
corporation called Initech. Peter's job is slowly eating away at him. His
boss, played by Gary Cole, is defnitely a creation of Judge; he is a boss
who is always hinting at something else. A nearby secretary answers every
phone call with "Just a moment". The computer won't print. A nearby
stuttering employee(Stephen Root) is calling Peter on the phone to complain
about his desk being moved constantly. And Peter stays at his desk all day
and plays Tetris. One Saturday, Peter disobeys his boss and doesn't come to
work. From that point on, Peter is a crazed man who just doesn't care about
anything anymore. He comes into work without a suit on the day in which many
employess are being laid off. But instead of being fired, Peter is given a
promotion because of his frankness and laid-back attitude, and his
hard-working friends Samir(Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton(David
Herman)...yes you heard me correctly...have been laid off. Wanting to get
back at the corporation, these 3 friends decide to hatch a scheme that could
ruin the whole business without them even knowing. It is then that Peter
meets a pretty young waitress(Jennifer Aniston) with whom he begins a very
underdeveloped relationship(arguably the worst part of the film). </P>
<P>The whole "work is hell" message of OFFICE SPACE doesn't work nearly as well
as it did in last year's CLOCKWATCHERS. One of the reasons for this is that
Judge, like the Farrelly brothers, isn't above adding stupid subplots to
generate some laughs. The sign of a great comedic filmmaker is when they can
give you laughs without ruining a good plot. RUSHMORE is a fine example of
that kind of film. Judge, however, does show some signs of potential in his
first film. The script is occasionally smart, and he gets likable
performances from most of his actors(Aniston excluded), especially
Livingston, who had a small role in SWINGERS. OFFICE SPACE is also a bit too
short to make much of an impression, but for light comedic fare, this should
provide some harmless entertainment.
