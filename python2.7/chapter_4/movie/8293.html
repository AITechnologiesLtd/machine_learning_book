<PRE>The Lost World:
Jurrasic Park
REVIEW (C)1997 DAVID WILCOCK</PRE>
<P>Starring Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore and Pete Posthewilate 
A Universal Picture</P>
<P>So we finally get the long anticipated sequel to Jurrasic
Park. And it's better than the orinigal. It's far more
suspenseful, darker and scarier than the first one, and also
has some very good set pieces. But, of course, the plot and
writing is not really up to par. But the directing is
excellent.</P>
<P>The film starts with a horrifying incident with a young girl,
and then Sir Richard Attenbourough saying that there is a
second island. Goldblum and his girlfriend, plus another
guy and a photgrapher go over, to see how it's going.
Goldblums daughter smuggles onto the boat which is
taking them, so she ends up there aswell. </P>
<P>At the island, after the oohing and aahing at the dinosaurs,
they get down to buisness. But then, evil agents from
InGen come to the island, led by Pete, who want to
capture the dinosaurs and take them back to a theme park
in San Diego (which Hammond started but never finished)
So Goldblum and Co fight to save the dinos. </P>
<P>There are some incredible set pieces in the film. One,
involving a trailer hanging over a cliff, is way too long, but
is directed so well by Speilberg, that you have no choice
but to enjoy it. Also, the Raptor scene in the long grass is a
excellent piece of filmaking. To be honest, many of the
scenes are better than the ones in Jurrasic Park. Sure, the
plot has wholes big enough for a T-Rex to walk through,
but it IS great fun (much like Batman and Robin) If you
liked the original, you're going to love this. Highly
recommended </P>
<PRE>Overall Rating=***1/2 out of *****
