<P>     Welcome to cyberspace, the newest locale for the action-adventure 
film.  Borrowing heavily from Alfred Hitchcock and John Grisham, 
director Irwin Winkler reduces a potentially-fascinating premise to the 
spearhead of a routine thriller.  THE NET starts off strong but finishes 
weak, and if not for the presence of actress Sandra Bullock, who graces 
nearly every scene, this movie might have been a snoozer. </P>
<P>     For the third picture in a row (the other two being SPEED and WHILE 
YOU WERE SLEEPING), Bullock's simple, understated portrayal is 
noteworthy.  She draws the audience's sympathy like a magnet.  No matter 
how silly the plot contrivances get, we still have a vested interest in 
the fate of the main character.  This isn't just good acting -- it's an 
example of something far more rare and potent:  genuine screen presence 
and appeal. </P>
<P>     Bullock's Angela Bennett is an introverted computer analyst.  She 
sits at her keyboard, doing all her work by phone and modem.  When she 
needs to eat, she uses the Internet to order a pizza.  The only time 
Angela gets out of the house is when she goes on a vacation to Mexico, 
and even then, she has her laptop with her.  However, right before 
heading south of the border, Angela comes into possession of a disk 
containing information vital to the successful criminal activity of a 
group of cyber-bad guys, the Praetorians.  They know she has it, and 
will stop at nothing to get it back. </P>
<P>     While relaxing on a Mexican beach, Angela meets the dashing Jack 
Devlin (Jeremy Northam), a fellow hacker with the style and charisma of 
James Bond.  Unfortunately for Angela, he also has a gun, which he plans 
to use on her.  She escapes his clutches, but by the time she gets back 
to the United States, she discovers that the Praetorians have used their 
computer know-how to change her identity.  Suddenly, her name is Ruth 
Marx and she's wanted by the police.  Her mother (Diane Baker), 
afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, can't confirm who she is.  Only her 
ex-lover (Dennis Miller) recognizes her, and he thinks she's having a 
nervous breakdown.  In the meantime, someone else claiming to be Angela 
Bennett (Wendy Gazelle) has taken over the real Angela's job and life. </P>
<P>     The first hour of THE NET is engaging, but the movie runs into 
trouble slightly past the midpoint.  The kernel of originality pops, and 
we're subjected to a number of run-of-the-mill chases.  For the last 
forty-five minutes, it seems that Angela is always fleeing from someone 
with a gun.  As the quotient of traditional thriller cliches to 
innovative elements grows, THE NET becomes progressively more mundane, 
and the final resolution is too facile to be satisfying. </P>
<P>     THE NET can be seen as a cautionary tale to those who believe that 
complete reliance upon computers is a good thing.  Twenty years ago, 
this script would have been science fiction; today, significant portions 
are grounded in reality.  No computer security system is foolproof, and 
there is great power available to those who know how to tamper.  In THE 
NET, Big Brother isn't only watching; he's taking action as well.  It's 
too bad the movie gradually loses its awareness of this ominous danger.  
I guess car chases are easier to film. </P>
<P>     In the final analysis, however, Sandra Bullock is the trump card, 
and she keeps THE NET interesting.  While this film lacks the impact of 
a truly gripping thriller, it gives us a protagonist to root for and 
stick with, no matter how familiar certain aspects of the plot are.  
Fascination with the Internet may be the motivation for entering a 
theater showing this movie, but Bullock is the reason to stay to the 
end. </P>
