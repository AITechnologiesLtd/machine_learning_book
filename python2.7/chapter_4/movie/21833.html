THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN...
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Term "hidden gem" is usually reserved for films that were
unappreciated because they were unknown - small, low budget
films, made by filmmakers who never became popular or by
film industries that don't have reputation of winning
festival awards. However, one of the more blatant cases of
"hidden gem" is a film that doesn't meet all those criteria.
THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN... was 1970 big budget production by
respected Hollywood studio featuring big names and being
directed by respected director. More than quarter of century
later, this film is ignored and almost forgotten. I was very
surprised to see it, because THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN...
happened to be film that had left big impression on me when
I had seen it for the first time. I had to wait for almost a
decade to see this western comedy for the second time, but
the long wait really paid off. After that seeing, I began to
appreciate it even more and wonder why the other filmophiles
ignore it.</P>
<P>Protagonist of this film is Paris Pittman Jr. (played by
Kirk Douglas), bandit who is endowed with intelligence and
charm. However, those qualities can't save him from bad
luck; he is being caught and sentenced to ten years of
prison for the latest robbery. Conditions in the prison,
placed in the middle of desert, are hard, but Pittman could
endure those years simply by thinking about half a million
dollars of the loot that he had stashed outside. Pittman's
days in prison get even easier when the word about his
fortune spreads among the inmates and even some guards;
everybody starts doing him favours, expecting share of the
loot in exchange. That provides opportunities for the
jailbreak, in which Pittman could expect co- operation by
his picturesque cellmates. However, Pittman's plans would be
temporarily halted with the appearance of Woodward Lopeman
(played by Henry Fonda), new, idealistic and incorruptible
warden, more interested in improving prison conditions and
penal reform than Pittman's bribe.</P>
<P>Script for THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN..., written by Robert
Benton and David Newman, is a surprisingly good piece of
work. The plot is relatively simple, but it is laced with
interesting subplots and even more interesting supporting
characters. Each of those characters has an interesting
story, and those stories are often funny and very
entertaining. But the most important element of the film is
the acting talent, and this film had place for two giants.
Kirk Douglas and Henry Fonda have more than interesting
interaction as two completely opposite characters. Douglas
is splendid as totally immoral but intelligent and charming
villain. Fonda, on the other hand, uses minimalist approach
in more serious role of idealist Good Guy. However, that
seriousness and good old American values, in the context of
this film, provide comical effect. The dynamic duo of
Douglas and Fonda is accompanied with small army of
excellent character actors in equally impressive supporting
roles. Burgess Meredith is great as the oldest, most
experienced inmate, Warren Oates is good as strong but naive
bandit, but nothing can top the comic relief provided by
Hugh Cronyn and John Randolph as pair of two, old,
presumably gay, swindlers. Michael Blodgett is somewhat
shadowed by them in his role of young man sentenced to
death. The great script and many great actors provided good
material for Joseph L. Mankiewicz to make truly great film.
Mankiewicz did it for the most part; on the other hand, some
scenes are too repetitive or unnecessary, making this film
longer than it should have been.</P>
<P>The reason why this film failed to become instant classic
lies in the worldview it showed. That worldview uses
uncompromising and extremely cynical portrayal of Old West
in order to portray humans as greedy, lustful and entirely
amoral creatures, and all those who think that there are
some higher ideals in life, like Lopeman, are portrayed as
idiots. Critics at the time would probably appreciate a film
that was brave enough to show the film that undermines the
old American values by showing their dark side (the film
also shows racism towards blacks and Chinese in few scenes).
On the other hand, this film actually fails to bring any
alternative -THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN... lacks any positive
role models, and in their absence viewers are left with the
impression that the human beings are simply rotten and that
there is nothing that could be done about it. Such nihilism
was something that highly idealistic audience of late 1960s
couldn't swallow. Feminists would also be infuriated with
the way women are portrayed - as nothing more than whores
and amoral sex addicts, and even the implied gang rape is
seen as something quite funny. On the other hand, perhaps
the audience that had grown up on Tarantino would find way
to really appreciate this film.</P>
