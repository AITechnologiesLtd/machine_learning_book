<PRE>DO THE RIGHT THING (1987)</PRE>

<P>The 1980s, for me anyway, were a surprisingly 
splendid time in the world of film. The competition 
for the best film of the decade is an especially 
heated one: BLUE VELVET, David Lynch's searing, 
gut-wrenching "comedy" about the depravity that 
lurks in the house next door was one choice. 
Scorsese's RAGING BULL was another. BULL's power is 
somewhat muddied by the incredible critical 
response it recieved (I mean come on, is there one 
critic in America that _didn't_ call it the best 
film of the decade?). An "offbeat" choice that I 
could hardly disagree with is LESS THAN ZERO, a 
bleak, nihilistic portait of rich drug-addicts, 
that includes the best performance of the decade, 
by Robert Downey JR. Spike Lee's 
ultra-controversial DO THE RIGHT THING has my vote 
as best film. It seemed to capture a hot-ass 
Bed-Stuy day better than any movie could've, and 
its portrait of racial tensions between blacks and 
Italians was one of cultured thoughtfulness (the 
illiteracy of Pino, for example, which was never 
actually discussed, but easy to pick up by a 
careful watcher).</P>
<P>But the film was the work of a middle-class 
filmmaker (Lee) playing at being poor. While the 
film still has undeniably power, it never fully 
made me believe in Lee's comprehension of the 
lifestyle he was covering. Would a working-class 
twentysomething Brooklynite _really_ start a riot 
over "brothers on the wall"? Would another 
working-class twentysomething Brooklynite nearly 
kill an old man for breaking his radio?</P>
<P>Which brings me to another point. Mookie threw a 
trashcan though Sal's window because the police 
killed Radio Raheem. SAL lost his entire business 
-- his life -- because two asshole police officers 
killed a man in red hot rage. Lee has said that he 
pulled the film away from Paramount (to MCA) 
becasue the studio wanted it to end with "Mookie 
and Sal huging and singing 'We Are the World.'" 
That statement made me think: I felt angered by the 
ending of DO THE RIGHT THING, no only at the black 
rioters, but with the racist store-owners, Pino 
especially. Had the film ended as Paramount 
suggested, though, I would've felt gypped. The mark 
of a good film is that it can leave a bad taste in 
your mouth, but you'll watch it again in a second. 
DO THE RIGHT THING is one of those films.</P>
<P>While not a perfect film, it is as close as 
American film has come in the past 10 years. Spike 
Lee has yet to make a film better than DTRT, and I 
highly doubt he ever will.</P>
