<P>Spoofs have always been a favorite of mine in the movie genre. You go into 
the movie theatre and laugh until your side hurts. Movies like "Airplane" and 
"The Naked Gun" are some of my favorite spoofs. We haven't had many 
full-force spoofs of horror movies lately, and since "Scream" itself was a 
modest spoof why not spoof "Scream", one of the biggest grossing horror films 
of all time. Hey why not also spoof "Friday the 13th", "Blair Witch", "I Know 
What You Did Last Summer", "Matrix" and "The Sixth Sense", not to mention a 
ton of other films. "Scary Movie" is just that, a well-made horror movie 
spoof that isn't short on its laughs. </P>
<P>The movie starts out just like the movie it is spoofing, "Scream". Drew 
Becker is at home all by herself, popping popcorn when she gets a call from 
an all too familiar voice asking her if she likes scary movies. If you've 
seen scream, then you know the rest, except this time you get some comical 
twists and a clever opening title. The film then goes to B.A. Corpse High 
School where we meet Cindy Campbell  (Anna Farris) (notice a trend?) who has 
just informed her friends Buffy Gilmore (Shannon Elizabeth) and Jill that 
Drew Becker was killed last night. Gail Hailstorm (Cheri Oteri) is right on 
the spot as she tries to get some tidbits from Deputy Doofy. The killer then 
stalks Cindy and her friends, as she starts to think maybe her boyfriend is 
the killer. As they get comically killed off one by one, they must try to 
stop him before the movie is over! </P>
<P>The movie is chock full of sexually explicit jokes and sight gags, as well as 
prostethic organs, as well as some blood. The violence though played for 
laughs is surprisingly a bit strong, although never offensive or anything. 
The jokes are played out very well, and the dialogue is extremely smart. 
About 80% of the jokes work, but on occasion they get old and worn out, 
because it seems to go on and on. The film references to films are at times 
utterly hilarious, and the sight gags are extremely funny as hell. The scenes 
that were the funniest had me laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. </P>
<P>The cast plays the film out very well with Shannon Elizabeth the standout. 
Newcomer Anna Farris plays Cindy Campbell very well, and plays the victim 
very funnily. Marlon and Shawn Wayans who also wrote the film together, do a 
great job with their characters Shortie and Ray. Some of the jokes in the 
film are at times pretty risque, but always ride the line of never being 
offensive, except some of the prostethics in the film. The film's best spoof 
scene is of  "The Blair Witch Project" and even though I love that movie, I 
will admit it was a very funny scene. </P>
<P>The main problem with "Scary Movie" is that it follows "Scream" to a T with a 
few surprises here and there, with a clever twist at the end. The characters 
are all a standout, and the actors bring them out with full force, forcing us 
to laugh hard. The direction by Keenan Ivory Wayans is classic, and very well 
done. Horror fans and fans of the movies it spoofs will get alot out of this 
film, that might go down as a spoof classic along the lines of "Airplane" and 
"The Naked Gun". It's far from being a perfect film, but I could definatly 
watch it over and over and laugh each time at something new and funny. </P>
