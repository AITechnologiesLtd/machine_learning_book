<P>CLOCKWATCHERS (director: Jill Sprecher; cast: (Iris)Toni Collette,
(Margaret) Parker Posey, (Jane) Alanna Ubach, (Paula) Lisa Kudrow, 1998)</P>
<P>Just killing time, four female ' temps ' become workplace friends as
they try and cope with work and life in this disarmingly subtle movie,
that seems to grow more and more metaphysical by the minute. These '
temps ' are looking for something permanent in their lives. Each is
insecure and unhappy. They are looking for a way out of this rat trap.</P>
<P>Toni is introspective and passive. Parker is perky and rebellious. She
is very mischievous and depressed because she is not able to fulfill her
career ambitions. Lisa dreams about stardom, she is living in a fantasy
world. Alanna is in a mental stupor, obliviously going into a marriage
that has inherent danger signs to it. The dullness and pettiness of
office life matches their real life situations.</P>
<P>The plot develops around how tenuous such office friendships can be, and
how death-like is the atmosphere they work in, and how frighteningly
transient everything seems to be. It was eerie to watch everything break
down for these girls--- their hopes, friendships, and self-esteem. And
when it was the ' temps ' who were suspected of some office thievery,
they see for themselves how far down the ladder others in the workplace
really perceive them.</P>
<P>In the end, Toni comes off the best, gaining the most from her
experiences. She realizes that she should have spoken up when Parker was
in trouble, that it is important for the girls to stick together.</P>
<P>Their alienation is a national problem for both men and women. That
society can be repressive and authoritarian, is still true today, as
this film encourages you to see and think about what has really changed
after all the Women's Lib Movement agendas and all the other changes in
the workplace that have been accomplished, especially for women, and if
these changes have really made life better for them.</P>
<P>I was most interested in the Parker character because of her spunkiness
and her awkward attempts to form real friendships, as they all seemed to
be met with some disappointment, and the veneer she chooses to hide
behind is so easy to pull off her as a false mask, as she is the one who
gets hit the hardest, getting canned from a job that she only has
contempt for; and, she is the one who seems the most alone in the end;
she does not seem to have support from any of the following: parents,
lovers, friends, or even a roommate, who is always away. She seems to be
the one who, in actuality, is the least able to take care of herself,
which is in sharp contrast to how she conducted herself in the beginning
of the film; and Toni, of all people, realizes this, and becomes the
only one who comes to her aid, even if it is done indirectly, it is she
who writes a job recommendation for her when Parker's world has
completely crashed, and she does this by using the guile she evidently
picked up from Parker.</P>
<P>A gem of a small movie...  adeptly uncovering the need for positive
relationships and the need for solidarity in a hostile workplace, which
might as well be a metaphor for how to handle yourself in the world. The
inability of the girls to function in this modern society, is punctuated
by their need to question what they are doing and their need to belong
to something that makes sense to them. And even though, no smug answers
were given as how to accomplish this, one does have choices; at least,
you can start by facing up to yourself and your situation, and not just
marking time and staying put on a job that bores you. This movie
definitively brought up a topic a lot of people are concerned about, and
even if it said it in a low voice, its message can be heard above the
idle chatter in the office, if you are tuned in to the right cubicle.</P>
