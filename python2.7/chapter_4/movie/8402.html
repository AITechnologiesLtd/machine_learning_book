<PRE>                            NOTHING TO LOSE</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: 6.1 and $5.00</PRE>
<P>    Although very funny in some parts, Nothing to Lose often drags through
the filler.  Luckily, the scenes that work (mostly) make up for the ones
that don't. </P>
<P>    I think the main gripe I had directly with the acting was how forced
it seemed.  It often seemed that Martin Lawrence was straining to be
believable instead of just being his funny self, and that Tim Robbins was
reacting in the way he figured was expected by the audience, instead of
going with his comedic instinct.</P>
<P>    Much of the plot is farcical, but then this isn't a serious movie, so
the plot weaknesses can be overlooked for the most part.  The problems
arise, however, during the long gaps between the very funny scenes where
the movie drags on and on through poorly-delivered filler comedy. </P>
<P>    Don't let the occasional yawn discourage you, however!  The movie gets
better as it goes along.  All scenes with T. (Lawrence)'s family work
wonderfully, and the section of the movie with Henry (Patrick Cranshaw)
is roll-on-the-floor funny.</P>
<P>    So, if you can be patient, Nothing to Lose is a worthwhile matinee or
video experience. </P>
<P><HR>My #1 rule in reviewing is: NO SPOILERS.  Instead of discussing the
plot, I choose instead to discuss performances, believability,
entertainment value, etc.  If you want the plot, see the movie.</P>
<P>I give two ratings: An arbitrary scale of enjoyability (1 to 10) and
a maximum price I would pay to see the movie.<HR></P>
