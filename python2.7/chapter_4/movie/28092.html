<PRE>Shadow Of The Vampire 
a film review by Chad Polenz</PRE>
<PRE>WHAT IT'S ABOUT: </PRE>
<P>A quasi docudrama/quasi horror movie about the making of a classic vampire 
movie, "Nosferatu" in Germany in the 1920s. John Malkovich plays an obsessive 
director who goes for as much detail as you could possibly get out of dreary, 
grainy black and white film and no sound. Willem Dafoe plays Max Schreck, an 
"actor" playing the role of the Dracula character who isn't wearing making 
and isn't method acting - he really is a vampire! The story shows how Schreck 
is a lonely old man who just happens to fit the mold of the vampire cliche we 
know today. He scares the bejesus out of the cast and has a taste for human 
blood while Malkovich films him for authenticity purposes. You're supposed to 
wonder who's the bigger nut - the vampire pretending to be an actor playing 
the role of a vampire or the director for exploiting him. This is obviously 
meant to be a thinking man's horror film since the scariness is derived from 
these strange men's behavior but it never really comes across that way. </P>
<PRE>WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT: </PRE>
<P>The art direction and production design give a totally realistic, authentic 
look of the heydays of B&W silent movies and the equipment and sets the film 
crews had to work with at the time. When the scenes of the movie within the 
movie are shot the frame closes to a 3:2 ratio with a very grainy, dreary 
picture - the exact opposite of digital remastering. It's a poetic homage to 
the past and a gutsy technique to use in this day and age. Malkovich and 
Dafoe also give excellent performances but as good as they are, they can't 
carry the movie entirely by themselves. </P>
<PRE>WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD ABOUT IT: </PRE>
<PRE>In a word: boring! </PRE>
<P>I'm a big appreciator of ambiguity and the concept that true terror is based 
on what our five senses can't pick up on. "Shadow Of The Vampire" is meant to 
appeal to our sixth sense so that we're frightened by the fact a REAL vampire 
is playing the role of one in a movie and does things a real vampire would 
do. Yes, Dafoe is excellent in his role but he's not scary or disturbing, 
he's just weird. Maybe I'm just cynical because I'm used to more mainstream 
fare, but this movie only has a few good moments and isn't great throughout. 
There's not enough characterization of the supporting cast, there's a lot of 
details missing from the main plot, the suspenseful sequences are a little 
trite and the ending is forgettable. </P>
<PRE>OVERALL CRITIQUE: </PRE>
<P>The running time is only 85 minutes or so - that tells you a lot right there. 
For a docudrama to work you need to spend a lot more time with the characters 
- get to know them personally and intimately. We never do that with this 
troupe. Everyone's just kind of a tool to make the plot payoff. Throughout 
"Shadow Of The Vampire" there's many many hints of personal drama and inner 
demons to the characters but the screenplay can't balance the story with 
characterization. One minute we're on the set of the movie, the next it's 
some personal subplot that never comes to fruitation and doesn't have a lot 
of significance overall. </P>
<P>This is one of those movies where you know exactly what the filmmakers were 
trying to do and you still don't enjoy it. A mediocre product but a good 
effort nevertheless. </P>
<P>RATING: ** (out of **** = fair/below average) </P>
