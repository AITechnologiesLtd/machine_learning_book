<PRE>                              GODZILLA 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon

Screenplay: Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich</P>
<P>The thing that struck me most about this big monster movie was that it
was thoroughly enjoyable – much more so than JURASSIC PARK or THE LOST
WORLD, which I believe took itself much too seriously. With Godzilla,
the experience was different, not merely special effects … okay a lot of
it was special effects… somehow this monster is more intelligent and
interesting than a silly T-Rex running through the streets, not to
mention bigger in size.</P>
<P>There isn't a moment of boredom or tedium, with ongoing action and
dialogue to keep the viewer hyper-stimulated throughout the entire movie
experience. I can still hear the thumping of GODZILLA's big webbed feet
ringing in my ears, the whale-like-moan he makes before appearing, the
rattle of machine guns bouncing off concrete, the swish of flying
missiles flying through the air, the burr of helicopter propellers with
overheated engines, the screech of tyres skidding across the wet
landscape, the screams of numerous pedestrians trodden to death, the
shrillness of glass shattering as GODZILLA strolls past central park.</P>
<PRE>Are you getting the picture?</PRE>
<P>There is a plot, a reasonable one, although very much over the top
fantastic. Godzilla the giant aberrant mutation, is the result of
nuclear experimentation and so indirectly man made. He's the guy you've
come to see, and so overshadows the otherwise extremely well chosen
cast. Matthew Broderick as the weedy, geeky scientist, Jean Reno is
wonderfully humorous as the French secret agent, Hank Azaria is
colourful as a very American-Italian cameraman. But let's face it you
came to see the big guy have it out with the US airforce, navy and army
and what a wonderful spectacle it is. So just sit back and enjoy the
commotion.</P>
<PRE>Let's face it – size does matter.</PRE>
