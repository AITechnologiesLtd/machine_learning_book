<P>_Twin_Dragons_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>After Jackie Chan finally scored a U.S. blockbuster with last fall's
American-produced _Rush_Hour_, it comes as no surprise to see another of
Chan's relics from his large vault of Hong Kong productions unearthed for a
stateside release.  What is somewhat surprising, however, is the film
Dimension Films has chosen to release to capitalize on his
stronger-than-ever popularity.  While 1992's _Twin_Dragons_ delivers the
blend of high-flying martial arts and broad slapstick that has become
Chan's trademark, the film, while diverting, remains one of his more minor
efforts.</P>
<P>My guess is that Dimension chose _Twin_Dragons_ because of its precious
gimmick: as the title suggests, Chan plays twins.  Separated at birth, the
identical brothers have had different upbringings and thus live very
different lives.  Boomer was kidnapped by a crook in the hospital and was
found by an alcoholic but loving woman; he grows up into a street-smart
auto mechanic with exceptional fighting skills.  On the other hand, John Ma
remained with their parents, travelling with them to the States, where he
studied music.  Now a world-renowned conductor and classical pianist, he
has returned to Hong Kong for the first time for a concert.</P>
<P>Of course, it is only a matter of time before each brother learns of the
other's existence, and hijinks ensue.  Predictably, these hijinks revolve
around mistaken identity.  Boomer and John's respective female
friends--Barbara (Chan's favorite co-star, the amazing Maggie Cheung,
largely wasted) and Tammy (Nina Li Chi)--can't tell them apart, and neither
can Boomer's goofy (and very annoying) sidekick Tyson (Teddy Robin), nor a
group of baddies with a score to settle with Boomer.</P>
<P>As with all domestic releases of Chan's Hong Kong films, alterations have
been made to _Twin_Dragons_.  In addition to a new soundtrack, featuring
English language dubbing (Chan and, it seems, Cheung redid their own
dialogue) and a more polished score, certain edits have been made.
However, most of the pruning is actually for the better.  One idiotic,
overly cartoonish (yes, even for a Chan film) sight gag involving a doctor
is thankfully gone; and a heavyhanded fantasy scene with John and Barbara
has understandably been excised.  However, it must be said that with that
cut and a brief moment between those two in a car, whatever substance there
was to Barbara's already-thin character has been erased.  In the original
version, Barbara is a lifelong music afficionado with singing aspirations;
in the new cut, she's basically just a woman who happened to be seen at a
karaoke bar.</P>
<P>What did survive the editing process, of course, were the many fight
scenes.  From a wild karaoke bar scene (where Boomer uses everything from
light fixtures to speakers to dispatch bad guys) to the terrific auto shop
climax, the action scenes in _Twin_Dragons_ all display a creative abandon
absent in the entirety of _Rush_Hour_.  Those seeing _Twin_Dragons_ for an
action fix won't be disappointed; however, those looking for a bit more
inspired comedy like myself knows that Chan can do--and has done--better.</P>
<P>Dimension Films also holds American distribution rights to Chan's 
_Drunken_Master_II_, and I'm a bit surprised that the studio didn't release
that one now instead of _Twin_Dragons_.  Funny and full of fantastic
fighting (which would definitely play well in the wake of _The_Matrix_'s
HK-inspired derring-do), it is my favorite Chan film, and would likely
maintain Chan's new stateside heat, if not increase it.  With the release
of the middling _Twin_Dragons_, it appears that Chan's U.S. fortunes will
once again take a downslide--much like they did after the successful 1996
release of his _Rumble_in_the_Bronx_.</P>
