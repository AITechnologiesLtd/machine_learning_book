<PRE>THE SPANISH PRISONER
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Don't look for a Spanish prisoner in David Mamet's new film, The Spanish
Prisoner. There isn't one...but, that's the point.  In this intricate
thriller, nothing is quite as it seems...or is it?</P>
<P>Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) thinks he's on the verge of hitting the big
time.  He's just invented a complex financial formula called The
Process, which could mean huge profits for his company.  His boss, Mr.
Klein (Ben Gazzara), has promised him due compensation at the next
stockholder's meeting, but his friend George Lang (Ricky Jay), a company
lawyer, advises him he should get something in writing, or he might get
screwed.</P>
<P>Thus do Joe, George, Mr. Klein, and Susan Ricci (Rebecca Pidgeon), a
company secretary who has a crush on Joe, travel to a Caribbean resort
island St. Estephe to sell The Process. While there, Joe meets a
mysterious businessman, Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin), who befriends him and
begins to give him worldly advice.</P>
<P>But then, things begin to fall apart, and the overly-trusting Joe begins
to have doubts.  Is anyone really who they seem?  Is Joe being played
for a sucker?  If so, who is out to get him, and who can he trust?</P>
<P>David Mamet's complex plot is well constructed, and full of myriad
twists and turns.  The whole film is pleasantly reminiscent of
Hitchcock. However, under strict analysis, the film doesn't quite hold
up that well (there are too many convenient coincidences).  But it's
still leagues ahead of most thrillers.</P>
<P>Campbell Scott does an excellent job of pulling in the audience.  His
overly nice character could have been off-putting in a cynical world, or
even been seen as a weakness.  However, he manages to imbue Joe Ross
with a strong everyman quality which makes him likable despite his
flaws.</P>
<P>Steve Martin is the film's most welcome surprise.  In a mostly dramatic
role, he delivers a delightful performance, with just the right amount
of edge to be slightly unnerving.</P>
<P>Of the cast, the biggest disappointment has to be Rebecca Pidgeon. Her
stiff delivery is the film's most significant detraction.  Whether it
was either a conscious character quirk, or a result of
over-memorization, her flat and precise delivery lets you know there's
an actor at work... shattering the veil of disbelief.</P>
<P>Thankfully, she has a wonderful script (written by her husband, director
Mamet, no less) to build it up again.  There may be flaws here and
there, but for the most part, they work within the context of the film,
and only truly make themselves known during reminiscence.</P>
