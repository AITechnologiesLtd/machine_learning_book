<P>STARRING:  Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Stanley
Tucci, Calista Flockhart, Christian Bale, Anna Friel, David Strathairn,
Sophie Marceau, Dominic West
DIRECTOR:  Michael Hoffman
WRITTEN BY:  Michael Hoffman</P>
<P>William Shakespeare has been dead for almost 400 years now, but his
plays are truly immortal as a source of entertainment-- not to mention
trepidation for young English students.  His colleague Ben Jonson (in
one of whose plays Shakespeare acted) wrote, "He is not of an age, but
for all time."  The recent trend for film directors has been to put that
theory to the test by setting the Bard's tales in entirely different
historical eras, but leaving the dialogue intact.  In 1996, Australian
director Baz Luhrmann transplanted Romeo and Juliet into modern-day
Verona Beach, complete with guns, gangs, and Leo.  This year, Michael
Hoffman (One Fine Day, Restoration) takes Shakespeare's early comedy,
changes the milieu from ancient Greece to 19th-century Tuscany, and
throws in a few bicycles for good measure.  These conceits aside, there
are some good moments in the film, thanks to thoughtful set design and
engaging performances by Everett as Oberon and Tucci as the, er, puckish
Robin Goodfellow.</P>
<P>If you want to know how the plot of this thing unfolds, read the
frickin' play, because it's pretty convoluted.  Let's just say it
involves a love triangle complicated by political intrigue, an attempted
elopement by night, a female stalker, a troupe of low-rent actors, and a
jealous fairy king whose schemes cause the sort of multi-layered
misunderstandings that would go on to inspire any number of Three's
Company episodes.  It's a comedy, though, so everything turns out
happily in the end.</P>
<P>In the wrong hands, such exquisitely mannered stuff can be either
stultifying or just silly.  The actors have to understand it deeply
enough to make it accessible to the audience, yet also utter the lines
as though they'd never been spoken before.  After 400 years, both
requirements are tougher than ever, but some of this cast pull it off.
Rupert Everett (My Best Friend's Wedding) in particular, with his
brooding, English handsomeness, brings the fairy king Oberon to life
with equal parts bitterness and mischievousness.  As Puck, Oberon's
underling and errand boy, Stanley Tucci (Big Night) also demonstrates an
easy facility with the Bard's turn of phrase.  When he bemusedly says
"What fools these mortals be," it seems so natural that it takes a
second to register that he's just uttered one of the most famous quotes
in all of Shakespeare.  Together, the two actors give their characters a
depth of mutual familiarity one would expect from immortals.  Michelle
Pfeiffer, for her part, is a beautiful (if strangely virginal) Titania,
and Kevin Kline has great fun making an ass of himself as the aptly
named Bottom.  Less successful are David Strathairn and Calista
Flockhart.  Strathairn, whose Theseus sounds like something out of a
high school drama class, should have been reminded that it's okay to
break the iambic pentameter rhythm.  As the lovelorn Helena, Flockhart
tries too hard, with too much Ally McBeal melodrama, and thus fails to
convince.</P>
<P>With all these characters (and more) flitting from scene to scene,
Hoffman and production designer Luciana Arrighi wisely chose to create a
small but effective forest set rather than film on location.  It's
stagy, but that's the idea; it allows for an Elizabethan intimacy, but
still looks wild enough to harbor sprites and nymphs and such.  This
latter aspect also heightens the film's sensuality, both in the scenes
involving Lysander and Hermia and in Titania's languid pillow talk with
Bottom.  Backed up by special effects which for once aren't intrusive,
it's a cozy environment that never steals attention from the actors.</P>
<P>The film tends to drag at first, but picks up the pace by the third act
and finishes strongly with the troupe's hilarious production of "Pyramus
and Thisbe" and the all's-well resolution.  While Hoffman's more modern
setting doesn't really matter, he makes it work without awkwardness, and
he restrains his directorial caprice enough to leave the writer's
dialogue alone.  By the time Puck finishes his final whimsical
disclaimer, that dreaded 400-year-old ghost of English class past won't
seem so bad after all.</P>
