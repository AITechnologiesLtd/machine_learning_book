<PRE>'Private Ryan' mulls over the meaning of sacrifice'

<P>Every combat veteran knows something the rest of us will never -- can never
-- really understand ... what it was like. The vet will likely try to
explain, but no matter how vivid the stories, words eventually fail. 
This is the territory Steven Spielberg attempts to traverse in the
straight-no-chaser near-masterpiece called `Saving Private Ryan' ... what
it was like, not only the chaos and the carnage, but how combat exists on
an entirely different plane of experience where morality, purpose,
rationality and decency all take on a different shape.
The first half-hour of `Saving Private Ryan' is a bone-jarring experience,
so horrifying it sometimes feels like the movie screen won't contain it. It
is a rendering of the legendary invasion of Normandy, what we've grown up
calling `D-Day,' June 6, 1944, the most decisive campaign of World War II.
>From the first minute that the first personnel carrier empties on the
beaches of France, we are witness to a massacre of staggering proportion as
the lapping ocean literally turns red with blood.
The camera is at grunt's eye level, sometimes shaking with the frenzy of
fear, always recording the gut-shaking details, the sound of empty casings
falling to the ground or of a bullet ripping through the surf at GIs lost
in the chaos, hiding underwater. There's also waves of the kind of butchery
that war films have always had problems with showing convincingly: limbs
blown away, entrails spilling into the sand, fierce soldiers transformed in
an instant to so much hamburger.
In one of the most haunting scenes, our hero Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks)
watches in dazed horror as a GI carries off his right arm with his left,
his right shoulder a fraying bloody stump.
The tone thus set, we settle in with Miller and his eight-man squad as they
take on an unusual mission in the days after Normandy. They are to descend
into the French countryside, behind German lines, to retrieve one Private
James Ryan (Matt Damon of `Good Will Hunting'). The reason? Ryan is the
last surviving of four brothers fighting in the war and the Army has
decided that the Ryan family will not lose all their sons.
Of course, as one of Miller's men points out, they have mothers too and
thus begins an ongoing dialogue on the screwy ethical choices that war
brings forth. Is it worth it to risk the lives of eight men to save one
Iowa family?
Besides Damon, `Saving Private Ryan' features a number of youngish rising
stars who developed their chops on the indy-film circuit. Edward Burns, the
wisecracking writer/director of `The Brothers McMullen' plays Reiben, a
testy grunt who questions the wisdom of the mission. Giovanni Ribisi, who
`Friends' fans might recognize as Phoebe's doltish brother, plays the
squad's medic. Scrawny Jeremy Davies, the star of `Spanking the Monkey,' is
Upham, a well-read but skitterish interpreter who becomes the film's
conduit to explore questions of cowardice and courage.
Holding it all together is Tom Hanks, turning in another remarkable
performance as the enigmatic commanding officer disturbed only by a
shaking-hand condition that's getting worse as he gets deeper into enemy
territory. Hanks is emblematic of a kind of moral complexity you don't
often see from the director of `Jurassic Park.' Miller clearly thirsts for
victory over the Germans, but unlike the guts-and-glory war heroes of
Hollywood's golden age, his motives are murky. He just wants the ordeal to
be done with so he can get back to his wife. He's more Eisenhower than
Patton.
What's striking about `Saving Private Ryan' is the flinty, unsentimental
tone Spielberg establishes. There is a minimum of grandiose dying scenes
and deathbed speechifying. The death is cheap, sudden, merciless,
matter-of-fact. One scene of a dying soldier is characterized by a panicked
race to keep him from bleeding to death followed briefly by a helpless
yelping for his mother. No dewy, choked sentiments, just terror receding
into the abyss. This portrayal of the murderous violence of war gives the
film its integrity.
The exception to this hard-hearted realism is the film's frame, a
contemporary scene of an aging man in golf attire standing solemnly at a
military cemetery (Miller? Private Ryan?), a handsome family standing
respectfully behind him, a family we are reminded that one stray
battlefield bullet or grenade could have prevented from coming into
existence.
It's here where `Saving Private Ryan' addresses its most compelling theme:
the meaning of sacrifice and gratitude. The empty pandering of politicians
over the years has made such notions clichés, particularly falling on the
ears of the soft, jaded generation that by accident of history has been
excused from military service, to say nothing of combat. This picture
attempts to bring about a fuller understanding of sacrifice on the
battlefield and in that respect it is a moving and dignified salute to the
fallen.</P>
