<P>     Picture, if you will, the final moments of THE GODFATHER:  Michael
Corleone is greeted as the new Godfather by his underlings, and his wife
Kay, played by Diane Keaton, stands outside the door of his study.  As the
door closes on Kay and on the film, a voice-over by Keaton intones, "At
that moment I realized that there was a part of Michael's life I would be
shut out of forever."  Voice-over narration is a common cinematic device,
particularly in nostalgic period films, yet I can think of few narrated
films in the last thirty years which wouldn't have been better without it.
Narration tends to be a crutch, an attempt by a film-maker to be more 
"literary" which instead suggests that he lacks the patience to reveal
the characters' psychology without short-cuts.  INVENTING THE ABBOTTS is a
pleasant period drama for a while, until the episodic story grinds to a
halt as the actors sit around waiting for the narrator to tell us how they
feel.</P>
<P>     INVENTING THE ABBOTTS opens in 1957 in the fictional Illinois town of
Haley, and focuses on two families from different social circles.  Doug
Holt (Joaquin Phoenix) and his older brother Jacey (Billy Crudup) are
working class teenagers living with their widowed mother (Kathy Baker);
the Abbott sisters -- Alice (Joanna Going), Eleanor (Jennifer Connelly)
and Pamela (Liv Tyler) -- are the daughters of office furniture
entrepreneur Lloyd Abbott (Will Patton).  Though class divides the Holts
and Abbotts, family history connects them -- Doug and Jacey's father was
Lloyd's business partner, and Jacey believes that Lloyd cheated the Holts
out of their rightful share of the business.  Jacey's bitterness leads him
to a fling with the rebellious Eleanor, but Doug is also fascinated with
the "bad girl."  Further complications develop when Pamela confesses to
feelings for Doug, and when Jacey's obsession with the Abbotts leads him
into conflict with the protective Lloyd, as well as with his own brother.</P>
<P>     The opening half-hour of INVENTING THE ABBOTTS is by far its best,
energized by the awkwardness and buzzing hormones of its teen-aged
principal characters.  Doug is established as a good-hearted square,
showing up at a fancy Abbott party with a greased pompadour and India-ink
sideburns in honor of Elvis, while brother Jacey flirts confidently with
Eleanor.  It is Jennifer Connelly's funny, sexy and sly performance 
as Eleanor which provides the real spark to the first act of ABBOTTS, her
every scene punctuated by a wicked smile, a glimpse of underwear (her own)
or a grab of the crotch (not her own).  She is even a presence when she's
not on screen, her photograph acting as Doug's true objet d'amour while he
makes a clumsy pass at Pamela on her living room couch.</P>
<P>     Then, thirty minutes into the film, Connelly is banished from the
narrative, and the whole production goes into a stupor trying to figure
out what its about.  There are really two separate plot-lines in INVENTING
THE ABBOTTS -- Jacey's attempts to live vicariously through the Abbotts
and Doug's off-and-on romance with Pamela -- but once Connelly is out of
the picture, the episodic story is sluggish and rarely involving.  The
single predominant reason for that lack of involvement is the narration,
provided by an uncredited Michael Keaton to underline the action whenever
and wherever possible.  It becomes ever more obtrusive as the film moves
along, first providing merely background information but eventually
announcing the motivations of every character.  It is the narrator who
tells us how Jacey _really_ feels about Alice, not Billy Crudup's
performance; it is the narrator who make sure we understand how wonderful
Mrs. Holt is, not the interactions between the characters.  And, as though
aware that they are under no obligation to convey their emotions through
anything as mundane as acting, the actors simply don't bother.  Joaquin
Phoenix and Liv Tyler -- who needs to learn a different emotional shade
before she's too old to play "the virgin" -- make a perfectly nice couple,
but neither delivers a personality.  Both are pleasant to look at, and
they might as well be modeling for still photographs.</P>
<P>     Given the way Fox has marketed INVENTING THE ABBOTTS to focus on its
"hot young stars," it's not unreasonable to think of them as models in a
story.  It's not that they can't act; they're simply not given much of a
chance to do more than look as warm and inviting as the 1950s suburban
middle-America director Pat O'Connor (CIRCLE OF FRIENDS) creates.  The
audience isn't given much of a chance either, which ultimately may explain
more of my dissatisfaction with INVENTING THE ABBOTTS.  As artfully made
and sensitively plotted as it might be, INVENTING THE ABBOTTS ends up
insulting the audience with its over-reliance on narration.  TV's "The
Wonder Years" became a parody of itself when Daniel Stern piped up every
forty seconds or so to clarify significant details which required
absolutely no clarification, and that's the way INVENTING THE ABBOTTS
feels after 108 minutes.  AMERICAN GRAFFITI didn't need Richard Dreyfuss
in voice-over to explain his wonderful days of innocence; STAND BY ME got
that honor.  When narration makes a film feel more lazy than literary, as
happens in INVENTING THE ABBOTTS, it's time to shut up and follow the old
writer's rule:  show, don't tell.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 omnipresent narrators:  5.</PRE>
