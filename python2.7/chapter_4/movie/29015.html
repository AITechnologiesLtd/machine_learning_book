<PRE>"I'm not crazy! Aaaaaaaaaaaah!"</PRE>
<P>Starring Anna Faris, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans,
Regina Hall, James DeBello, Natasha Lyonne, Andy
Richter, James Woods, Chris Elliot. Directed by Keenan
Ivory Wayans. Rated R.</P>
<P>When I reviewed Scary Movie last year, I said that the
only litmus test for a movie like this is whether it's
consistently funny, making it exceedingly difficult to
review. While that film worked more times than not,
its obligatory sequel is far less consistent. Yes,
there are laughs in Scary Movie 2, but they're
sporadic, with a lot of the jokes being regurgitated
from the original.</P>
<P>The movie brings back those characters that weren't
offed in its predecessor. Anna Faris returns as Neve
Campbell... um, I mean, Cindy Campbell, who has now
gone on to college along with her friends Ray Maker
and Shorty Meeks (Shawn and Marlon Wayans). While the
first movie spoofed Scream and its slasher flick
rip-offs, this one bewilderingly sets its sights on
The Haunting, of all movies: a relative box-office
flop and a bad reviews magnet (though I liked it). Why
this alleged pop-culture parody focuses on a movie
that disappeared after a couple of weeks in theaters,
we may never know.</P>
<P>But the central "plot" doesn't begin until after the
opening sequence, a priceless take on The Exorcist. A
group of friends, including a priest, is gathered
around the piano singing old showtunes when, suddenly,
they break out into Mystikal's rap song "Shake Your
Ass." Shame when a comedy's first gag is its funniest.
But there's still some fun to be had when James Woods
shows up as Father McFeely, parodying Max von Sydow's
unforgettable Father Merrin.</P>
<P>It's mostly downhill from there. Director Keenan Ivory
Wayans is stuck spoofing what doesn't particularly
need to be spoofed, and winds up repeating his jokes.
Chris Elliot shows up as the creepy caretaker with a
mutilated hand and Tim Curry has the dubious privilege
of making fun of the Liam Neeson role in The Haunting.
Most of the jokes after the first 10 minutes miss
their mark, and those that hit are non sequiturs that
are funny by accident.</P>
<P>Dimension Films, hungry for a quick and easy cash cow,
refused to postpone the release date for Scary Movie
2, forcing Wayans to rush through production. Perhaps
that is the reason for the film's sloppy,
unprofessional feel. Then again, it's also credited to
seven -- count 'em -- screenwriters, and one of the
rules of moviemaking is that the number of scribes is
inversely proportional to a script's quality.</P>
<P>I'm at a loss for what else to write. See Scary Movie
2 if you have nothing else to do. It's not a complete
waste of time, but it doesn't quite work as the
laugh-out-loud culture parody it wants to be. </P>
