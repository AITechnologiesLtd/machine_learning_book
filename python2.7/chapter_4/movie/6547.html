<PRE>                                   SHINE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     In Hollywood, you just can't make a movie like SHINE.  Put simply,
it is just not allowed.</P>
<P>     This is our loss and Australia's gain, because SHINE comes off as
one of the upper-echelon films of the year, an ambitious and unflinching
look at that country's David Helfgott, a prodigy of a pianist driven
insane by his father, only to emerge again after 20 years of
institutionalization.</P>
<P>     The film tracks David's tumultuous life from young boy (Alex
Rafalowicz) to young man (FLIRTING's Noah Taylor) to adulthood
(Australian stage actor Geoffrey Rush).  David's father Peter (Armin
Mueller-Stahl) pushes young David so hard (his motto: "Win!  Win! 
Win!") that his mind slowly crumbles before our very eyes.  And while
Peter wants David to be The Best, he doesn't want him away from home,
and his overprotectionism, combined with Peter's insistence that David
master Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto (the "Rach 3," considered one
of the most difficult piano pieces ever written), eventually drives
David over the edge.</P>
<P>     Extremely compelling for a film that is essentially a character
study of one man, SHINE succeeds by leaving out no detail and by
masterfully using the camera to capture an inner turmoil that would be
impossible for us to feel otherwise.  Exquisite is the string of
five-star performances by Rush, Taylor (a favorite of mine),
Mueller-Stahl, and supporting players John Gielgud and Lynn Redgrave. 
Rush's frantic jabbering as the insane adult Helfgott so perfectly
captures the mood that he deserves (and is receiving) serious notice. 
And let me not forget the music, which is awe-inspiring (especially the
unbelievable Rach 3), and which makes you want to applaud after each
piece is performed.</P>
<P>     SHINE isn't flawless, though -- the biggest problem is a *serious*
defect in the sound quality, normally no big deal, but inexcusable in a
film about music.  The roundabout plot structure will not appeal to
every filmgoer, and when the movie was over, I felt a bit cheated by the
lack of a real ending.  (Helfgott has returned to sanity and is
allegedly going to play at the Oscars if SHINE is nominated -- an event
that the film, as it stands, would never portend.)</P>
<P>     I guess you can't have everything.  But maybe leaving the audience
hungry for more was the whole idea.</P>
