<PRE>THE LIMEY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Seeing a half-dozen guys lined up like statues outside the rich
American's front door, Wilson (Terence Stamp) figures that they must be
bodyguards.  Having just arrived in this country after a 9-year holiday
in her Majesty's prison, he's not used to LA ways.  The men, of course,
are not bodyguards, but valets, a prerequisite for parties of the rich
and famous in Southern California.</P>
<P>THE LIMEY is a stylish thriller by director Steven Soderbergh.  From his
original, groundbreaking SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE to last year's
acclaimed OUT OF SIGHT, Soderbergh has proved that he's a director who
has a knack for creating fascinating movies just slightly out of the
mainstream.</P>
<P>THE LIMEY continues in Soderbergh's avant-garde tradition.  Featuring
frequent jump cuts and fast action interlaced with moments of solitude,
the movie has a dazzlingly impressive style.  Layering as many as a
half-dozen time sequences on top of each other, the film is a tribute to
the director's talent since the movie remains lucid and easy to follow
no matter how often the time changes.</P>
<P>Wilson has come to America to investigate the death of his daughter,
Jennifer (Melissa George), who supposedly died in a car accident.  He
suspects foul play after learning of her death from a letter an American
ex-con, Ed (Luis Guzmán), sent him.  It seems Ed and Jennifer met in an
acting class -- remember it's LA, where everyone aspires to hit it big
in show biz.  Lesley Ann Warren plays Jennifer's voice coach.</P>
<P>When we first meet Wilson, a crook way past his prime, he acts like he
might not have it in him anymore.  He soon disabuses us of that notion
as he starts whacking guys left and right on the way to discovering the
truth about his daughter's death.</P>
<P>With a pensive and introspective demeanor and sporadically explosive
actions, Stamp gives his character an intellectual intensity.  Wilson's
a force to be reckoned with, even if he has trouble understanding the
mores and habits of the natives.</P>
<P>Although his accent is intelligible, his sentences are so full of
cockney slang that he sometimes seems to be speaking gibberish.  One
black cop listens to one of Wilson's particularly long and hyperactive
speeches and just stares at him.  "There is one thing I don't
understand," he tells Wilson.  "The one thing.  One #@$% you've said."
Lem Dobbs's script is full of wry, biting humor.</P>
<P>Soon, the paths all lead to Valentine (Peter Fonda, who was so wonderful
in ULEE'S GOLD), his daughter's last boyfriend.  Valentine, a music
producer with criminal connections, owns the big home in the hills with
the aforementioned valets.</P>
<P>Famous back in the 60s, Valentine explains that era to his current
conquest, a woman less than half his age.  "The 60s was just 66 and
early 67, that's all it was," he says in an explanation that goes right
over her head.</P>
<P>Ed, who accompanies Wilson as they crash Valentine's party, looks out
from the view high atop the smoggy LA mountains.  "You could see the sea
out there, if you could see it," Ed remarks, not used to such lavish
perks.</P>
<P>You can say one thing about those wealthy Angelenos.  They certainly
have class.  When Wilson kills a guy during the party in order to
frighten Valentine, the police and the firemen end up swarming all over
the place.  During the investigations, uniformed waiters offer everyone
drinks in elegant, long-stemmed crystal goblets.</P>
<P>THE LIMEY runs a fast 1:28.  It is rated R for violence and language and
would be fine for teenagers.</P>
