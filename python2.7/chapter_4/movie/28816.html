<P>    Hollywood movies are notorious for ignoring reality.  In almost
every thriller about greedy people who steal for a living, the crooks
get caught in the end.  What had always annoyed me at Alfred
Hitchcock's TV series was that even if the bad guys seem to have
been rewarded for their crimes, Mr. Hitchcock would show his face
during the final minute stating, "Mr. X was later apprehended by
the police and is now serving a long term in jail."  But those who
write stories about iniquity today are aware that in many cases,
the audience wants nothing more than for the cops to be shown
up as fools and for the bandits to make a clean getaway.   What
types of stories are they?  I'd say they are those in which the
brigand is charming, does not hurt anybody, and has a beautiful
woman waiting for him as he sails away with the loot.  It wouldn't
hurt if the heroic villain got dragged reluctantly into the scam. 
What if three people planned and executed a job...is it possible
that we in the audience would make distinctions and want, oh,
one or two guys to make off with the jewels while the other guy is
left stranded?  "The Score" is just that kind of caper movie, quite
an intriguing one at that because the usually obligatory car
chases, shoot-outs and explosions are shunned.  Director Frank
Oz--who must be a likable enough fellow no matter what Marlon
Brando thinks of him--lets us spend most of our time scrutinizing
the planning of a heist so that we knew just what goes on in the
minds of the truly professional swindlers--not those who rip off
people on a dare or on the spur of the moment but who carefully
scheme, weigh the odds, make demands on one another.  </P>
<P>   Like Jules Dassin's classic caper movie "Rififi" on which Mr. Oz
seems to borrow, the dialogue is kept to a minimum, though
unlike the predecessor there is no a long period characterized by
a complete absence of  talk.  The action centers principally on the
relationship between two pros, though the younger one is by
nature of his hormones more excitable than the calmer middle-
aged swindler.  Robert De Niro and Edward Norton star as Nick
Wells and Jack respectively, the former as the owner of a well-
appointed jazz club in Montreal's Vieux Carre, the latter as
assistant janitor on the graveyard shift in the heretofore
impenetrable Montreal Customs House.  Norton, among the finest
actors of his generation, turns rain man, acting the role of a
mentally challenged man named Brian with all the tics and
postures of a decent guy whose elevator doesn't get near the top
floor.  The two are brought together by Nick's longtime pal, Max
(Marlon Brando), a reliable guy who believes in the slogan that
there is honesty among thieves and convinces Nick to participate
in one more job.  Though Nick had sworn off dishonest labors, he
cannot resist six million bucks, his share of the undertaking,
notwithstanding the demand of his girl friend Diane (Angela
Bassett) that he walk a straight line or she's walking out.</P>
<P>   Because the major portion of Kario Salem, Lem Dobbs and
Scott Marshall Smith's clever script (which at times can rival David
Mamet's), rests on the blueprint for the robbery, the action that
takes place at the conclusion is all the more delightful.  This is not
to say that we're cooling our heels in our theater seats waiting for
a breakout: the details are what involve us.  We watch three top
stars, each representing a different generation of actors,
contribute their styles to the grand design: we see how the
interplay of these characters shapes the absorbing story.  Isn't this
what movies about jewel thieves should be like rather than the
same ol' formulaic tripe that has the audience a half hour ahead of
the performers?  </P>
