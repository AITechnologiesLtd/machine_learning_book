<PRE>MEET JOE BLACK (M).  
(Universal/UIP)
Director: Martin Brest
Stars: Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani, Marcia Gay Harden, 
Jake Weber, Jeffrey Tambor, 
David S Howard, Lois Kelly-Miller
Running time: 176 minutes.</PRE>
<P>The Grim Reaper comes to earth in the delectable form of Brad
Pitt in Martin (Scent Of A Woman) Brest's $90 million remake of the
1934 romantic comedy Death Takes A Holiday.  Pitt plays death, who
adapts a human form to learn more about what makes us mere mortals
tick.  He has ostensibly come to claim William Parrish (Anthony
Hopkins), a self-made millionaire, but decides to spend a week in his
company learning more about the human condition.  Parrish is the only
one aware of Pitt's true identity, and he introduces the enigmatic
stranger to his family as Joe Black.</P>
<P>It is the week of Parrish's 65th birthday, and his oldest
daughter Allison (Marcia Gay Harden, from Flubber, etc) is planning a
lavish party.  Parrish also has to deal with a take-over bid from a
business rival who wants to strip his global communication company and
sell off its assets.  He also has to deal with treachery from within
his own board.  Parrish has plenty of time to come to terms with his
own mortality and the legacy that he will leave behind.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Joe falls heavily in love with Parrish's beautiful
young daughter Susan (Claire Forlani, Sean Connery's daughter in The
Rock, etc).  As with his character in the recent Seven Years In Tibet,
Pitt's human incarnation of Death undergoes a spiritual
transformation, as he comes to learn about love, loss and the pain of
being human.  Inevitably, some hard choices will have to be made, both
by Joe and Parrish.</P>
<P>Meet Joe Black explores some wonderful themes and ideas, and
the climax delivers a superb emotional payoff.  Unfortunately, it
takes far too long to get there.  Brest's deliberately languid
direction perfectly suits the occasionally sombre tone of the
material, but, at nearly three hours long, the pace tends to drag and
many in the audience will tire of the film.  The 1934 version told
much the same story in half the time.  With judicious trimming of some
unnecessary padding, Meet Joe Black would be tighter and far more
enjoyable.</P>
<P>However, the film does have its compensations.  It looks
fabulous, thanks to the opulent production design of Dante Ferretti, a
favourite of Scorsese, and the warm cinematography of Emmanuel
Lubezki.  There is also the usual strong performance from the
dependable Hopkins.  And Pitt and Forlani make a handsome, attractive
couple - eye candy for the younger generation.  The camera loves Pitt,
and seems to caress his blue eyes, his seductive smile and his air of
boyish innocence.  If only death always looked this good then we might
be more willing to go quietly into that dark night.</P>
<P>Meeting Joe Black is not such a bad experience, it just could
have been so much more enjoyable and memorable!</P>
