                                 Bound (1996)
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>          Exciting? Yes.  Good story?  Yes.  Then what is my
complaint?  It is the gratuitous gore.  Do the directors really have
to show a pair of scissors, such as is used to cut twigs or small
branches, while the gangsters cut off the fingers one by one of a
suspected cheat?  His head is in the toilet and the blood is gushing
all over the place.  I could have done with that.</P>
<P>          Too bad because the story is a good thriller.  Two women
(Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly), in an attempt to outwit the male
Mobsters makes for an exciting film. The two, who happen to be
Lesbians, against the gangsters tosses in another angle in mobster
films.   But the film kept bugging me with all the shooting and blood
and the aforementioned scissors and kept me from enjoying the film's
story more.</P>
<P>          An odd thing was the acting of Ceasar (sic) who seemed to
be doing an imitation of Jack Nicholson right down to the whites in
his eyeballs whenever he looked upward, a distinct Nicholson
affectation.</P>
<P>          I don't know whether or not I liked the film well enough to
overcome the violence.  If that kind of mayhem does not bother you, you
will enjoy the rest of the film.</P>
