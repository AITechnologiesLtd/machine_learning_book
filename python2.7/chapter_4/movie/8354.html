<PRE>Men in Black
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of 4) MEN IN BLACK is over way too fast. </PRE>
<P>The movie is light and airy fun. It never drags and it's always
entertaining, so after a mere 96 minutes we're sorry to have to leave
the theater. </P>
<P>In case you haven't heard, K (Tommy Lee Jones) works for a secret
government agency, Men in Black (MiB, sort of like the interstellar
version of the INS). K recruits young J (Will Smith) to help him track
and control alien life forms living on planet Earth. </P>
<P>Soon after J joins up, MiB learns of a threat from a race of aliens who
threaten to blow up Earth if a certain galaxy (don't ask) is not
returned. Or something like that. As NEWSWEEK says, the plot doesn't
really matter in this movie. What does matter are outstanding comedy
performances, wonderfully cartoonish sets, and a smart, witty script. </P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones is the perfect straight man. His K has been favorably
compared to Jack Webb's humorless lawman Joe Friday. Everything in the
movie is absurd, but K takes it all in stride. And Will Smith plays off
of Jones with an overeager confidence that tests the limits of Jones'
deadpan. </P>
<P>Production designer Bo Welch has done some excellent work for Tim Burton
in the past. He designed EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, BEETLEJUICE, and BATMAN
RETURNS. That same bold cartoonish look is put to wonderful use in MEN
IN BLACK. The MiB testing room is designed for the 60's futuristic look
and not the functionality. The main foyer of the MiB offices is a giant
empty granite cube, its solitary features an industrial-sized blower and
return vent (the lone guard has dragged in a cheap office chair so he
can sit and work his crossword). Once inside, the offices of MiB
headquarters look like the exterior of Boulder's own mushroom house seen
in Woody Allen's SLEEPER. </P>
<P>The script keeps the jokes coming at a nice brisk pace. In fact, you may
have to see the movie twice to catch all the jokes in the background and
the jokes you missed because the audience was laughing. Continuing the
tradition, I will NOT reveal any jokes in this review; suffice it to say
that you should pay close attention lest you miss something funny. </P>
<P>Some of the fun in MiB comes from identifying its little winks at other
science fiction movies. I Found references to DR. STRANGELOVE, WAR OF
THE WORLDS, GHOSTBUSTERS, STAR TREK: GENERATIONS, and THE ADVENTURES OF
BUCKAROO BANZAI, to name a few. That's one more thing to keep your eyes
open for. </P>
<P>Though you will be rewarded if you watch closely, the movie does not
require much effort. It is a light and refreshing diversion, a perfect
way to spend a few hours of your summer. </P>
<PRE>They'll be gone before you know it.</PRE>
