<P>The characters in the Danish director Thomas Vinterberg's remarkable 
film, "The Celebration," are so full of hate, resentment, and 
unhappiness, that it sometimes grew nearly unbearable to watch them 
anymore. And yet, the film is such an emotional powerhouse without going 
for cheap dramatics that I couldn't turn my back on it.</P>
<P>"The Celebration," is set during a 24-hour period, in which an extended 
family has gathered at a country estate to celebrate the 60th-birthday 
of the family patriarch, Helge (Henning Moritzen). Right from the very 
first scene, in which, on his way to the party, Michael (Thomas Bo 
Larsen) spots his older brother, Christian (Ulrich Thomsen), travelling 
by foot, and subsequently throws his own wife and three children out of 
the car, we get a taste of how dysfunctional this family is. Early on, 
we also meet Helene (Paprika Steen), Michael and Christian's sister, and 
Pia (Trine Dyrholm), who has loved Christian ever since chilhood, but 
has not been able to connect with him since his twin sister committed 
suicide two months ago. All of these characters and story threads 
finally come together at the actual birthday celebration that night, in 
which everything begins to unravel and fall apart when Christian, giving 
a speech at dinner, unexpectedly reveals some brutal hidden secrets that 
he has kept bottled up for years about his father, Helge.</P>
<P>"The Celebration," is the first film to be released under Dogme 95, a 
Danish film agreement established in Copenhagen, which requires the 
director to make the film with a hand-held camera using natural light, 
and without any sort of special-effects or music score. The purpose is 
to give the Dogme 95 films a realism and aspect of spontaneity that 
could not be captured otherwise. Considering this, "The Celebration," is 
an interesting first experiment, but also an, overall, exceptional 
motion picture that, truth be told, gives off an air of instinctivity 
and nauralism that has never been caught in a fictional film before.</P>
<P>Aside from this truly unique aspect, "The Celebration," is a brutal, 
unbelievably stark motion picture about family wounds and secrets. It 
would be criminal to spoil the surprises within, but once Christian 
reveals his past to the whole family, I was in a state of shock and 
dread throughout the rest of the film. Prior to this fateful moment, I 
had pretty much decided what I thought of all of the characters---I 
liked Christian and Helge, but found Michael to be a despicable, abusive 
human being---but once that turning point came, the film forced me to 
question and judge the family again, as individuals and as a whole. And 
even as more and more striking plot developments occurred, I had a 
difficult time deciphering the good from the bad, and the truth from 
what could very well be dirty, unforgivable lies. </P>
<P>The actors, most of which appeared in Vinterberg's first, and lesser 
known film, "The Greatest Heroes," are all meticulous and unforgettable, 
from Ulrich Thomsen, as Christian, who feels it is time to get his 
miserable childhood out in the open, to Thomas Bo Larsen as the edgy 
Michael, to Paprika Steen, as Helene, who turns out to be hiding secrets 
of her own. Henning Moritzen was perfect as the father, Helge, who 
drifts throughout the film as being both touching and helpless, even 
though we sense he is capable of some very terrible things. Also making 
an impact is Gbatokai Dakinah, as Helene's black boyfriend who shows up 
unnanouced at the party, much to the disgrace of the rest of the family.
The camerawork and cinematography by Birgitte Hald, as in the Dogme 
rules, was done with a hand-held camera, which was a smart choice, since 
the shaky, unsettling movements reflect the family's gradually crumbling 
relationship in the film. The picture was also filmed in drab, 
yellow-brownish colors which also telegraphed the idea of a family 
off-balance. </P>
<P>Watching the picture, it felt more like a cerebral experience, than a 
normal film. In a decidedly weak year for movies, "The Celebration," is 
certainly one of the year's very best. It made me feel things deep 
inside myself, which caught me by an even greater surprise, when 
compared to the trivialities of most of the films being made in today's 
times. There was never a false moment to be had; not with the 
characters, or the writing, which is superb, or with the deep truths of 
the story. When, "The Celebration," ended, it left me with conflicting 
emotions about what had gone on between the family. On the one hand, I 
had the suspicion that maybe the family would be able to work things 
out, but that was only my own ideal thoughts. In actuality, I knew that 
when one person simply told the other, "you can go now," that was the 
definitive end to the family, and yet, the start of happiness and relief 
from some of the characters. Funny, how a harmless get-together between 
loved-ones can start out as a rejoicing of togetherness, and end as a 
rejoicing of separation between those who now hate each other. </P>
