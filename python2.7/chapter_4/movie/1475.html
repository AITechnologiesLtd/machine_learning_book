<PRE>                         BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>85 min., PG-13, Comedy, 1992
Director: Fran Rubel Kuzui
Cast: Kristy Swanson, Donald Sutherland, Paul Reubens,
      Rutger Hauer, Luke Perry</PRE>
<P>     Donald Sutherland goes to high school cheerleader Kristy Swanson
and tries to convince her that she is the chosen one to fight vampire
Rutger Hauer and his assistant Paul Reubens.  After he convinces her
that she is the chosen one he tries to teach her in the ways of vampire
slaying.</P>
<P>     If you are in the mood for a serious film or a horror film, BUFFY
THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is not for you.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is mainly a
teenager/college student comedy film.  Most adults, unless you are stuck
in the Peter Pan Syndrome, will find this film a waste of time, and
money.  I highly recommend this film to high school and college
students, but not to adults.  If you are a Peter Pan adult, I suggest
matinee prices only.  On a scale of zero to five, I give BUFFY THE
VAMPIRE SLAYER a four.   BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is rated PG-13 for
adult situations, explicit language, violence, and adult humor.</P>
<P>     I have always thought that Luke Perry, "Beverly Hills, 90210," had
no acting ability, and after seeing this film I have seen nothing to
change my mind.  The only reason that I can see that he was put in this
film was to attract teenage girls so they can "oh" and "ah" him when he
is on the screen.  Thankfully his part is well-written and he isn't a
key actor in this film.</P>
<P>     Paul Reubens, the famous Pee-Wee Herman (who I don't think will
ever work as Pee-Wee again), shows signs of becoming a real actor.  I
have never been a fan of Pee-Wee Herman and I hated Pee-Wee's Playhouse.
I also extremely disliked his acting in Cheech and Chong's NICE DREAMS.
He looks and sounds nothing like Pee-Wee, and thankfully, acts nothing
like him.  If he keeps it up he might have a future in films!</P>
<P>     Kristy Swanson does a good job as Buffy, and I think that she is
the cutest vampire basher you will ever see.  She does an exceptional
job in the beginning of the film as the "I'm better than everybody else
cheerleader."  Donald Sutherland, I think, has one of the best
characters in his career.  Usually I am not taken with his characters,
like the college professor in NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE, but I
liked his character in this film.   There isn't much to say about Rutger
Hauer.  He is not on for much time at all and never really got any
character development.  The film could have spent a little longer on
him.</P>
<P>     The film was well written, and towards the end Paul Reubens has one
of the best scenes in the film.  The film was not scary.   I will assume
that it was not meant to be.  If it was, they messed up.  Who ever wrote
the part for the principal must have just come out of high school.  His
"Don't look at me as administration, look at me as a party animal"
speech is very typical, at least in my high school, of those in power.
I wish that the film had been longer.  Just about the time I really
started to get into it, the film was starting to wind down.</P>
<P>     One last note, you should stay through the beginning of the end
credits because they contain a few funny scenes.</P>
