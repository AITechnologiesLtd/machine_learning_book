<PRE>                             THE MUMMY 1999
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
                 3 out of 5 for the curse from the grave</PRE>
<P>Cast:  Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Kevin
J. O'Connor, Oded Fehr.
Screenplay:  Stephen Sommers.
Producers:  James Jacks and Sean Daniel.
Director:  Stephen Sommers.</P>
<P>Cap: Unfortunately, this is not Indiana Jones, although Brendan Fraser
tries his best to fill his shoes; which is as near an impossible feat to
let's say raising a mummy from the dead.</P>
<P>The concept and feel of this movie is what draws a crowd. Drawn perhaps
by the romance and sands of Egypt, where long ago the forbidden love
affair between the High Priest and the Pharaoh's Mistress draws a curse
so great that it could destroy the world. Yeah Right! What is impressive
though, is the ensemble of special effects. Walls of sand, whirling
dervishes, mummified priests, death beetles that eat you alive – now
that's what we've all really come to see. And if that's what you're
looking for, then it comes more or less served as a ten-course meal.
With the rise of the mummy, returns the ten plaques of Egypt. Believe me
this is one very, angry, nasty mummy whose out for revenge. Where death
is only the beginning, he's back to suck the life force out of grave
robbers, steal the girl, sacrifice her to raise another girl, beat the
good guy to a pulp and just generally be big, mean and very nasty.</P>
<P>Overall, disappointing in the script and acting department. Particularly
disappointing was the heroine (Rachel Weisz), who was so British that it
almost made it impossible for the hero (Brendan Fraser), to get into her
knickers. In fact there was no chemistry between them at all. Perhaps,
and just perhaps, the only one who could have lit her fire was the
Mummy, but then only maybe. Even more annoying was her brother (John
Hannah), who was so annoyingly unfunny, as the side kick, they should
have hired a camel instead. But don't let all these setbacks spoil your
enjoyment of the otherwise thrilling Mummy.</P>
