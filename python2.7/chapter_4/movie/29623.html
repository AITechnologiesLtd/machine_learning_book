<PRE>HEARTS IN ATLANTIS
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The entire time I spent watching the latest Stephen King big-screen
adaptation Hearts in Atlantis, I had this nagging feeling in the back of
my mind that something was missing.  All the key elements of a
potentially great film were present -- authentic-looking 1960s Americana
scenery, great acting by Anthony Hopkins and newcomer Anton Yelchin
(Delivering Milo), an intriguing story line, and strong directing by
Scott Hicks.  And then, at the end of the film, it just hit me like a
sap across the back of the neck. </P>
<P>One common recurring narrative in many of King's better-known
novel-to-screen adaptations -- such as Stand by Me, The Green Mile, and
The Shawshank Redemption -- incorporates an older gentleman recalling
his youth or a life-changing incident of his life. Hearts in Atlantis
follows this to a tee.  After learning of a childhood friend's death, a
middle-aged photographer Robert Garfield (David Morse) ventures back to
his hometown for the funeral.  Upon arrival, Robert recalls memories of
youth and of one innocent, fateful summer when a mysterious man named
Ted Brautigan (Hopkins) entered his life and changed it forever.</P>
<P>At the beginning of summer, old Teddy rents the studio apartment on the
upper floor of his childhood home.  During his stay, Teddy displays the
usual, weird behavioral traits of all King characters.  He's a strange
gent who carries his belongings around in brown paper bags; says the
kookiest things about young love, life as a kid, and the pains of
growing old; appears as a mythical figure in times of crisis; and
carries the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Lonely little boy
Bobby Garfield (Yelchin) takes a liking to Teddy because his mother
(Hope Davis) is a workaholic who spends more money on dresses than
birthday presents and his father is dead.  During the summer, Bobby
falls in love and shares his first kiss with the neighborhood girl,
Carol Gerber (Mika Boorem), endures the trials of defending his honor
from the neighborhood bullies, pines for a bicycle in the local
convenience store, and discovers Teddy's mysterious gift of seeing
beyond the world.  Bobby is then entrusted with informing and somehow
protecting Teddy from the Low Men, dangerous ruthless faceless
characters who drive fancy cars and cast long shadows, who are hunting
for Teddy because of his unique "gift."</P>
<P>All of these circumstances would have made the film a success except for
one damning thing.  Everything -- from the unrequited love of two
childhood sweethearts to the emotional abuse of a lonely boy -- feels so
recognizable and indistinguishable from all of the previous works that
deal with these similar themes.  I kept catching myself remembering
parts from Stand By Me and even The Goonies.  It's a shame, because the
film looks great from a technical standpoint and both Hopkins and
Yelchin pull off great performances.  In the end, though, the film feels
cheap and used up -- like watching a two-hour Hallmark special.  You
feel guilty for even liking the good parts.</P>
<P>Even the message of Hearts in Atlantis becomes lost in the emotional
manipulation by both the characters and story.  Instead of giving the
audience the ability to develop its own emotional ties to the film's
narrative and personalities, the script dictates pre-defined moments of
trepidation, intrigue, anguish, sadness, loneliness, and frustration by
the obvious flow of the characters' dialogue and the film's plot
points.  One key example is when Hopkins details the story of a
once-great football player winning one last game for the home team.  So
much deliberation is given to this scenario that we all but expect the
main character of the story to have to overcome a challenging obstacle
in his own life.  It's a desperate manipulation, and it has a totally
opposite effect: In the end, you can care less what happens to Teddy or
his little friend.</P>
