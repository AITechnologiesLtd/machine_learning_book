<PRE>            WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO AND JULIET
                A film review by Bryant Frazer
                 Copyright 1996 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<PRE>                                     Directed by Baz Luhrmann
                           Written by Luhrmann, Craig Pearce,
                                 and, um, William Shakespeare
                               Cinematography by Don McAlpine
                                       Edited by Jill Bilcock
                    Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes,
                     Pete Postlethwaite, and Miriam Margoyles
                                                 U.S.A., 1996</PRE>

<P>Close to the conclusion of William Shakespeare's Romeo and
Juliet, as the kids seated around me murmured among
themselves, I found myself wondering how many in the theater
did not know how the story was going to end. And then, with a
mix of amusement and distaste, I was wondering if even the
ending would remain the same.</P>
<P>The film retains Shakespeare's monicker, which demonstrates
the film's backhanded fidelity to its source material and
gives it license to go completely nutso with its pretensions
toward modernization. This is modernized, alright, from the
digitally enhanced Mexico City backdrops to the silvery
firearms that take the place of the daggers and rapiers of
Shakespearean verse. What's not modernized is the dialogue,
which is lifted directly from the original text. The
resulting hodgepodge is more than a little daffy, with beefy
guys running around in Hawaiian shirts pointing guns at each
other and saying things like, "Do you bite your thumb at me,
sir?" Not surprising that it's occasionally silly -- what may
be surprising is that, at least as often, it really works.</P>
<P>Australian director Baz Luhrmann (Strictly Ballroom) can't be
accused of playing it safe. In the very opening moments of
the film, which is introduced by an anchorwoman on a TV set
that's dwarfed within the widescreen frame, his camera goes
on a vertiginous high speed tour of Mexico City, spiraling
and zooming above the roofs and in the streets. The supercool
shorthand of a film trailer is adopted for a sequence
introducing this hyperrealistic world with helpful captions
superimposed over screen-filling shots of various characters.
The whole sequence culminates in a gas station showdown
that's enervating in its hysteria -- the original dialogue is
worn here as a badge of courage, with noise and camera tricks
emphasizing hyperactivity above all else. Hell, we even get
the requisite shot of Tybalt (John Leguizamo) flying sideways
through the air blasting from two pistols, a rip-off from
John Woo by way of Robert Rodriguez.</P>
<P>A little later, we're invited to a party at the Capulet
place, where Harold Perrineau plays Mercutio as a drag queen
in a white wig. The cinema is so thick and the cuts so quick
that for a time it looks as though Oliver Stone has been
asked to direct Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. For the first
couple of reels, Luhrmann seems to be hoping that a sustained
mania can focus attention on the quite considerable
production design and divert it from the mouthfuls of
Elizabethan prose that his principals don't seem comfortable
with. It can't, quite, but the design is as impressive as the
conceit, and if you're not thoroughly turned off by either,
you may be hoping Luhrmann can actually make this stuff mesh.</P>
<P>Well, it's fortunate that Romeo Montague (Leonardo DiCaprio)
has been invited to this party at his rivals' den, because
it's there that he happens across the radiant Juliet Capulet
(Claire Danes). Love at first sight, and all that. But soft
-- a sweet, understated love scene that tumbles from balcony
into the blue-lit Capulet swimming pool gives the film a
much-needed emotional grounding, even though it remains
lighter than air. DiCaprio is an unassuming romantic lead,
and Danes a sweetly idealistic receptor for his young
passions. You believe that these kids like each other, and
you're rooting for them, which is key -- even if you know how
things turn out.</P>
<P>The world surrounding our two star-crossed lovers is meant at
every turn to illustrate and amplify the passions and pain
felt in their everyday lives. And so it is that gigantic
signs, one proclaiming 'CAPULET' and the other 'MONTAGUE'
tower above the city, flanking an immense statue of the
Virgin Mary. So it is that the familiar red-and-white "Enjoy
Coca-cola" logo is morphed into a sign reading "Wherefore
L'amour?" (Just for giggles, there's a hot-dog stand called
Rozencranzky's.) Romeo's beach retreat is the huge proscenium
of a ruined stage, towering next to a sea and sky that roil
with the turbulence of the storyline. This may all seem like
a little much, but I've got to admit that I love it.</P>
<P>The fashionable pop-song soundtrack is very much of the
moment, featuring tracks by such current flavors as Garbage
and The Cardigans. A little more adventurous is a
gospel-choir rendition of Prince's "When Doves Cry" that's
inserted into the film at exactly the right moment. Des'ree
contributes a pair of original numbers, but when a scene of
DiCaprio and Danes entering liplock on-screen is accompanied
on the soundtrack by a song titled, get this, "Kissing You,"
it's a little too literal for my tastes.</P>
<P>Of course, Shakespeare shouldn't really need a soundtrack,
and this film uses a sound-and-fury crutch to supplement its
drama. That's not to say Romeo and Juliet doesn't have great
moments, and my favorite is Mercutio, bleeding to death on
the beach: "A plague on both your houses!" At other times,
though, all this accessory stimulus tends to lessen the
emotion of the story. Luhrmann can't resist stretching the
sentiment in the final scene, which allows his lovers one
last look at one another this time around, but such maneuvers
only go so far.</P>
<P>One obvious shortcoming is that of our romantic leads.
DiCaprio and Danes are uncommonly good-looking, probably the
best pair of kids who could have been picked to play this
role. Their star appeal is undeniable, and they're both
earnest enough that they're easy to watch. But just about
everyone else in the cast is better at playing Shakespeare
than these two. To see Pete Postlethwaite bring such life to
the part of Father Laurence or to hear Miriam Margoyles make
the Nurse's Elizabethan dialogue sound for all the world like
plain English is to understand the rich wallop that Romeo and
Juliet could have packed in the hands of an abler cast.</P>
