<PRE>The Spanish Prisoner</PRE>
<P>Chad'z rating: **1/2 (out of 4 = OK/average)</P>
<P>1998, PG, 112 minutes [1 hour, 52 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[thriller/mystery]</PRE>
<P>Starring: Campbell Scott (Joe Ross), Rebecca Pidgeon (Susan Ricci), Steve
Martin (Jimmy Dell), Ricky Jay (George Lang), produced by Jean Doumanian,
written and directed by David Mamet.</P>
<P>Seen April 18, 1998 at 12 p.m. at the Ritz Bourse (Philadelphia, PA), theater
#1, with Ted Prigge for $4.50 [Theater rating: ***: good seats, sound, and
picture]</P>
<P>        Independent films thrive on their dialogue, storytelling, characterization
and other basic aspects while the big-budget Hollywood blockbusters use these
elements only as needed. "The Spanish Prisoner" seems to be an independent
film that tries to have it both ways, as it's a standard thriller that
attempts to substitute emotion and sympathy for special effects and production
design. </P>
<P>        The basic set-up to the story is rather simple, but explaining the
significant aspects is a complicated task as many details are pushed aside to
make room for the plot. We start out somewhere in the Caribbean where we meet
our four main characters: Joe Ross (Scott), a young man who is apparently
successful, as he has just finished some kind of mathematical or chemical
formula that will change the world; Susan Ricci (Pidgeon), Joe's new personal
secretary who adores him like a 5-year-old with a large vocabulary; George
Lang (Jay), Joe's co-worker and company lawyer who plays a role in how
successful he will become; and Jimmy Dell (Martin), a wealthy-but-mysterious
businessman who serves as the film's main catalyst (and only interesting
character).</P>
<P>        Right from the beginning it's clear the film is establishing all the key
elements which will crop up later. The pacing is slow, tedious, and often
boring and it's not due to overwhelming detail, but to lack thereof. Almost
nothing happens in terms of plot, only scene after scene of the generic
highbrow, 5th Avenue business rhetoric. When the Jimmy Dell character is
introduced, it's through a manner which is impossible to understand at the
time, and only minor details crop up later to explain the significance to the
rest of the plot.</P>
<P>        Mamet has often been called a master of characterization and dialogue, yet
the entire first act seems more like a novel acted out rather than a modern
film. The performances are mediocre and conflicting because the actors are
playing caricatures, not characters (i.e. Scott as the monotone loner and
Pidgeon as the happy-go-lucky extrovert). Most importantly, we don't learn
much about Joe, nor about "The Process" he has invented and its application.
The absence of that is probably one of the film's central themes, but since it
creates for a snowball effect of flaws, it's more distracting than anything
else.</P>
<P>        Although the first half tends to wander with little focus, everything comes
back into play as the second half turns almost instantly into a suspenseful
thriller. What had been a subtle, almost irrelevant sub-plot involving a
conflict and cooperation between Joe and Jimmy suddenly becomes the main focal
point of the film. Jimmy had always been an enigmatic character, and when Joe
realizes he has just been completely taken advantage of and framed into a
situation impossible of escape, a fantastic case of the perfect conspiracy is
evident.</P>
<P>        Throughout the second and third act the plot thickens as Joe becomes
entrapped by just about everyone and everything and it's impossible to tell
who's who and what's what. The "Batman Syndrome" (where by a seemingly normal
man is transformed into a brilliant detective and stunt man) takes over, and
it doesn't work because the atmosphere isn't gripping enough to believe. The
story is so involved with itself that everything that happens seems to take
place within a reality shared by only a few characters while no one else in
the world seems to notice the insanity going on (unless it creates for
suspense) [example of the former: Joe and Susan running from police and
villains through airports and boat docks while no one seems to notice the
chaos; example of the latter: everyone in the world noticing some blood on
Joe's hands as he rides the subway, giving the impression he is about to be
"caught"].</P>
<P>        Even if "The Spanish Prisoner" fails to be a thrilling adventure, it still
has an original hook, that is, an independent take on a tired Hollywood
formula. It's a valiant effort to be sure, but the net result is a bit too
sensational and thus the impact isn't as strong as it could be.</P>
