Starring Jeff Daniels, Harley Jane Kozak
Directed by Frank Marshall
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>The back of the video box for Arachnophobia is deceiving. It markets itself as
a horror movie with a comedic side and it's anything but that. What begins as a
cool idea for a horror movie (out in the tropical rainforest) trying to find
old species of spiders and other creepy crawlies (OK, I admit that word is
extremely hokey.) But once the film gets off to it's interesting start, and the
story is set up, it's all down hill from there.</P>
<P>Ross (Daniels in one of his non-comedic roles) and Molly (Jane Kozak) have just
moved to a lovely small town in California from San Francisco. But he's
frightened when his wife shows him a huge spider web in their barn because he's
an arachnophobic, someone who is afraid of spiders. He's destined to become the
local doctor when the town's current doctor retires, but when he decides not to
throw in the towel yet, his job is insecure. When a throws a party for everyone
in the town and someone is killed shortly thereafter he begins to wonder.</P>
<P>Naturally the spiders take over, killing and sucking the blood of all of the
surrounding areas from their house. A spider from South America and a domestic
house spider have bred a whole new deadly species who's headquarters is in
Ross's barn. It takes them more than three fourths of the movie to figure this
out, but the movie shows you the solution in minutes.</P>
<P>While having it's creepy moments, Arachnophobia isn't that scary. Hollywood has
once again easily taken something that's almost harmless and turned it into the
evil villain. Everyone in the film realizes that they are in a cheesy movie and
they pretty much play it to the limit. The film isn't funny at all (but the
video package won't tell you that.) If you enjoy a film that will have you
checking your bed, shower, or other household appliances for weeks, rent
Arachnophobia which gets * 1/2 stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film contains some brief graphic spider bites and related
goo and gore. It also contains some language. Good Age: 10 & Up, if they can
handle spiders</P>
