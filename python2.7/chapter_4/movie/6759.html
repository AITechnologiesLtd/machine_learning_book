<P>A viewer's background makes a lot of difference when it comes to judging a
movie. For example, if you have no particular interest in Argentina and its
history  (notably the Juan Peron era), if you like Andrew Lloyd Webber,
and Madonna, you may be all set to like Evita-the-movie. On the other hand,
if you have seen Evita on the stage, you might make comparisons that do not
flatter the film.</P>
<P>"Evita" uses a number of flashbacks, a technique that seems to be more and
more frequently used or misused. The film opens with the announcement of
Eva Duarte de Peron's death in 1952, cuts back to the provincial funeral in
1926 for Eva's natural father. She was the low-class, illegitimate daughter
of a married, philandering local bourgeois. The church service for him has
a big heavenly chorus soundtrack. Then we cut to Eva's colossal funeral
procession in Buenos Aires, also to a huge musical soundtrack.</P>
<P>You begin to suspect that the leading principle behind this work is that
Bigger is Better, a suspicion that takes no time in being confirmed. To
what purpose? To give us a musical biography of the young woman with a
shady past who climbs methodically the social ladder,sleeps with
increasingly important people, reaches the all-powerful military caste and
finally snares Colonel Juan Domingo Peron. They married in 1945. She was
26, he was 50.</P>
<P>If you've seen any documentaries about Eva Peron, you'll notice that the
film does not invent facts too much the way most older Hollywood biopics
did. Here several aspects of the couple's powerful partnership come
through: the rise of  Peron to his first Presidency (1946) and the
aftermath; the initial mistrust of Eva by the Army; the unrelenting scorn
by high society ; Evita's efforts to better the life of the masses; the
adulation of the lower classes and many in the middle classes; the fiasco
of her visits to Franco's Spain and to the Pope; and so on. It's all
sketchy but sufficient. The main troubles with the film are merely Madonna,
the music, the lyrics and the singing.</P>
<P>Much has been said about the parallels between Eva's and Madonna's rise to
fame and power. It's a superficial comparison. More to the point  is that
Madonna, who will soon be 40, shows her age. She plays Eva at 15, then from
ages 25 to 33. No matter how well the magic of makeup is used, it cannot
shave off more than a few years. (In some shots she reminds me of Judy
Holliday in bad hair days). Somehow Evita and Madonna never really merge,
especially for those who are familiar with photographs and movies of the
real Eva Peron. Still, it would be too much to ask of this kind of
"historical musical" to come up with fully developed characters.</P>
<P>I  suspect that Andrew Lloyd Webber is a composer whose works include very
few "real" songs. In "Evita,"  beyond "Don't Cry for Me Argentina," and
another tune that I forget, there's not much musical nourishment. The movie
becomes something like a mega-music video directed by a latter-day Cecil B.
De Mille. Its parts are interconnected by  minimally harmonious recitatives
that tell us the story. This makes the words more important than the music.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the lyrics are flat. Think of those in "My Fair Lady," "The
Music Man," "The King and I," all so charming, witty, so well adapted to
plots and characters, and you want to weep. Topping this, Madonna's singing
has none of the strong, semi-belting approach of other stage Evitas.</P>
<P>Talking of weeping, the picture does its utmost to manipulate the public,
to move it by building up big emotions (especially in the Casa Rosa balcony
scenes),to come up with a hagiography of Evita, warts and all. It doesn't
work for me. What does is the nice device of Chorus, played and sung by
Antonio Banderas, the best thing in the film. He keeps popping up as a
series of characters who make a running commentary and are quite critical
of  Evita. It comes, alas, to a final cop-out as Banderas joins the crowd
and kisses Eva's casket.</P>
<P>Banderas's voice may not be great but it serves the purpose well. Jonathan
Pryce's is small and insignificant, like his playing of Peron who looks
rather dumb (I was conscious of his fake nose too) as he takes a back seat
to Evita. The real Peron attained power through populism, through appeal to
the "descamisados," the shirtless people of the laboring classes. In the
film his big public moments are whenever he takes off his jacket, in a
silly equation of jacket and shirt. The other equation of Bigger with
Better is equally silly, but still, this munificent, lavishly staged, very
well shot production does have its striking visual moments.</P>
