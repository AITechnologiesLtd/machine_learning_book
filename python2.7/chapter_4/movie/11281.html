<P>   It has been suggested by some who have seen "Twilight"
that the picture is a rehash of standard private detective
conventions dating back to Raymond Chandler.  While Robert
Benton has indeed directed the movie in the noir style, it
would be a mistake to lump it together with standard-fare
detective tales.  "Twilight" conveys the California ambiance
during the wee hours, as the title suggests, the milieu 
furthered by Elmer Bernstein's moody, dissonant score.  But
while the film is built around a murder which at least one
retired member of the L.A. police force is trying to solve after
a score of years, screenwriters Robert Benton and Richard
Russo have a more universal intention in mind: aging and
mortality, particularly the need for folks in their twilight years,
strengths gradually diminishing, to recover the zest of youth
and to continue to find purpose and function.</P>
<P>   With this ambitious design in mind, Benton is fortunate to
have assembled a crackerjack team of veteran actors,
generally considered among the best in the field.  He
succeeds quite well, particularly given the chemistry between
Harry Ross (Paul Newman) and Catherine Ames (Susan
Sarandon), both over the hill in their fields, both grasping at
their newly-found passion despite considerable roadblocks in
the way of its satisfaction.  Benton is not so favored in putting
across other aspects of the story, particularly those dealing
with murder, blackmail, vengeance, and even a commentary
on social class resentments.</P>
<P>   The narrative begins in the resort town of Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico, where Harry, working as a shamus for wealthy former
Hollywood stars Jack Ames (Gene Hackman) and his wife
Catherine (Susan Sarandon), locates the couple's nubile 17-
year-old, jail-bait daughter Mel (Reese Witherspoon) in the
arms of Jeff Willis (Liev Schreiber).  While attempting to
escort her forcibly home, Harry is accidentally shot in the
groin by the young siren and, to keep the incident under
wraps, is taken into the Ames' luxurious home where he
earns his keep doing odd jobs.  </P>
<P>   Harry feels a growing lust for the witty and seductive
Catherine and enjoys a friendship with Harry, whose cancer is
no longer in remission and who has a year to live.  Asked by
Harry to deliver a package to one Gloria Lamar (Margo
Martindale), Harry suffers a series of ill-fated incidents, as he
is beaten and shot at by men with a variety of motives from
vengeance to frustrations at not receiving the blackmail
money they had been expecting.  Episodes of this kind lead
Harry into a complex, even convoluted assortment of
experiences which place him in a position to solve a murder
which had taken place 20 years earlier, while on a different
level he struggles with his feelings for his employer's wife and
his former girl friend, Verna (Stockard Channing).</P>
<P>   At times "Twilight" becomes far-fetched, particularly when
Harry's liaison with Catherine is interrupted by Harry's
suffering a seizure virtually in the next room, and even more
so in unfolding a comic episode involving the efforts of
Reuben (Giancarlo Esposito) to hook up with Harry in a
private-eye business.</P>
<P>  The picture features James Garner (as Raymond Hope) in
his typically avuncular role as a man who resents his role in
life, which is to clean up the messes of the rich.  What makes
his bitterness hard to swallow is that he has apparently been
paid very well by those he envies, living in a mountaintop
retreat.  It's a pleasure to watch Garner as the plot undergoes
a series of twists and turns, and while the movie is often
unconvincing and painfully slow, it offers valuable insights into
the cares of older people who no longer are given the
opportunity for career adventure and who therefore must rely
on themselves to make their own fun.</P>
<P>   Because of its accent on older people and Benton's slow,
conventional style of filming, the film will probably have little
appeal to a potential young audience, but should garner at
least adequate attention from folks who are at a stage in
which they realize that age does not particularly confer
wisdom but is noted principally by its partiality to physical
disorders (cancer, heart disease, vulnerability) and the
realization that life's chief adventures are past.  Rated R. 
Running time: 91 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
