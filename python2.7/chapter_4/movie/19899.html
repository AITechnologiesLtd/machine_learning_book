<P>Bruce Willis takes on a role strategically opposite to his usual macho,
wise-crackin', gun-tottin' beefcake, to star alongside a cute kid, in a part
that finds him leveled out as an insightful, caring, children's
psychologist. Could he go an entire picture and not make one wise-ass
remark? You bet!</P>
<P>PLOT:
A children's psychologist becomes strongly attached to one child's problem,
when the boy begins displaying strong signs of similarity with another young
kid whom the doctor once treated, and failed to cure. The boy claims to see
"dead people" walking all around him. In the meanwhile, the doctor's own
marriage begins to fall apart, as he focuses too heavily on the child in
question.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Wow. What an ending. I don't think I've been this moved by a film's
conclusion since the frighteningly shocking end of David Fincher's SEVEN
(9/10). Don't worry because I will obviously not ruin this film for anyone,
but suffice it to say that the end of this film allows you to see the entire
picture from an entirely different point of view, and that is simply a
unique achievement. In fact, I am more than willing to see this film once
again, just so that I could see it unravel within that other realm. Another
thing that stood out for me with this picture was the fact that unlike its
trailer, which sells this film as a chilling thriller, this movie is
actually a supernatural drama with plenty of tear-jerking scenes to boot.
And yes, even your faithful author crumbled under the emotional drainage of
the film's players, filling his eyes with a little bit of the ol' wetness. I
would rather compare it to elements of THE OMEN and GHOST, rather than any
thrill-seekers ride.</P>
<P>In fact, the film is deliberately paced very slowly, with plenty of time
given to the performers to grapple with the potent material at hand. Haley
Joel Osment does an excellent job as the confused young child who is going
through things that no child should ever go through, and even Bruce Willis
pulls off an impressive steady performance, without a single "yipee-kaya" in
the whole script. But once again, allow me re-iterate how much the twist
ending of this film allowed it to catapult onto another level. Even after
the film's credits had long been done rolling, my friends and I could not
help but discuss the various intricacies of the plot which were altered
through this amazing ending, and could not help but further our appreciation
for this film. Great acting, great style, great score, an instant classic
ending, and certainly worthy of being called one of my favorite films of the
year. And despite it not being an all-out thriller, believe me when I say
that you will be startled in a few scenes, and certainly touched in others.
Giant kudos go out to the writer/director of this film, M. Night Shyamalan,
for pulling off a very impressive film presentation.</P>
<P>Oh, and by the way, if this film interests you in the least, make sure that
you see it as soon as possible, before someone ruins the ending for you. It
truly is one to digest firsthand.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Ex-New Kid on the Block, Donnie Wahlberg, makes a powerful performance in
this picture, looking absolutely NOTHING like he used to in the days of
"hanging tough" with his now-defunct band. Such an immense physical
transformation, I have not seen in a long while. Donnie apparently dropped
30 pounds for his minimal role. Robert DeNiro would be proud. Donnie has
eight brothers and sisters, including his one other famous sibling, Mark
Wahlberg, another once-a-singer-now-a-want-to-be-serious-actor in his own
right. Donnie also has a son named Xavier by a member of his brother's band
Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.
Willis' wife in this movie is played by Olivia Williams, the apple of Max
Fischer's eye in last year's comedy hit, RUSHMORE (8/10).
You may remember child actor Haley Joel Osment from his roles as Avery
Brown, son of TV's "Murphy Brown", Matt Foxworthy son on TV's "The Jeff
Foxworthy Show", and Forrest Junior from, you guessed it, FORREST GUMP.
Actress Toni Collette is Australian. In 1994, she won the Australian
equivalent of the Academy Award for MURIEL'S WEDDING, a role for which she
gained 40 pounds in seven weeks, with the help of a dietician.
Pay close attention, and you will notice writer/director M. Night Shyamalan
in his role in this film as Dr. Hill. Mr. Shyamalan is born in Madras,
India, and wrote/directed his first autobiographical film, PRAYING WITH
ANGER, when he was only 22 years old. This is his third picture.</P>
