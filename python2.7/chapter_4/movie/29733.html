<P>What a delicious conceit that all the stars and fates and powers that be
have a hand in our destinies, so that we can stumble across the person with
whom we are meant to be through fortune alone.  It's definitely escapist to
be selfish, and what better way to be selfish than in the fictionalized
pursuit of true love?  This is definitely one of those movies where the
ending is in no doubt; the joy is in the journey. And thankfully, the
preview actually leaves us with some surprises! </P>
<P>The characters in this movie wisely suggest on more than one occasion that
leaving everything to fate isn't living at all, and they are correct.  It's
entertaining as well to watch people who generally are intelligent and
well-read and the type to scoff at horoscopy new agey kinds of intuitive
pseudo-science to also be utterly captivated by the magic of their
connection.  It is, after all, magic that appears in a non-magical world
that is the most wondrous.  Seriously, how many times can magic happen in a
fairy-world before it becomes mundane?  It's the same kind of acceptable
magic that made Sleepless in Seattle such a winsome film.  Amusingly, all
their rational, scientific machinations to force fate into finding each
other again are nothing compared to the witless, accidental
almost-path-crossings throughout this film.  It's a delight to watch two
charming people, charmed by each other, twisting in the fickle wind of
destiny.</P>
<P>It also doesn't hurt that Kate Beckinsale is a dreamy perfect girl, and
it's no secret that every woman at some point has objectified John Cusack
as the perfect man.  How could they not be perfect for each other?  Instead
of holding up the jam box outside Kate's window, however, John has to
really get down to some stalker nitty gritty...meanwhile, the ladies are
all charmed that he would go to so much effort.  That's what's romantic,
that passion despite all reason.</P>
<P>Plotwise, their interest/love/connection has to be immediate and
distracting, and perhaps it's a little unfair to so easily discard their
existing mates.  Kate's mate is pretty annoying, but Cusack's is not.  My
companion wished she had been more villainized, but I disagree.  Sometimes
someone can be perfectly wonderful but still not The One perfect one.  If
she's a villain, then he's an idiot for being duped by her.  If she's a
sweetie, then only his predestined soulmate can trump her.</P>
<P>In the meantime, it's also beautifully shot with lovely music and pretty
little running visuals.  We sit in the dark, watching the screen for clues
(like watching The Sixth Sense for the 2nd time) and wriggling in delicious
agony every time they have a near miss...very nice teases.  The supporting
cast includes the under-appreciated Jeremy Piven and Eugene Levy,
supporting and/or not condoning this mad quest, as well as Molly Shannon in
a surprisingly Joan Cusack-esque best friend role.  (That's a compliment).</P>
<P>I would only recommend it as a date movie for people who are totally
convinced that they belong together, their meeting was pre-ordained, all
that good stuff.  Otherwise you are just planting the seeds of doubt and
worry where Hollywood certainly did not intend for them to go.  But it's
worth the money.</P>
