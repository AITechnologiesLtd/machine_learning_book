<P>     Steven Soderbergh has fashioned one of those careers that movie
people always claim they want. He gets to make unconventional,
experimental films like KAFKA, SCHIZOPOLIS and THE LIMEY, while still
making a few bucks doing "mainstream" films like KING OF THE HILL and OUT
OF SIGHT. Yet "mainstream" truly belongs in quotes where Soderbergh is
concerned, since his approach to timeworn genres is as unconventional and
his conventionally unconventional work. Despite his popularity with the
art house set, he has found it difficult to cross over to a broader
audience, since he keeps baffling that audience by taking amiable
entertainments and putting meat on their bones. You might think you know
what to expect from a coming-of-age story or a crime caper, but did you
really expect what Soderbergh delivered in KING OF THE HILL and OUT OF
SIGHT?</P>
<P>     ERIN BROCKOVICH is another film -- a legal crowd-pleaser with a
tart-tongued heroine -- that looks like you should know what to expect. 
Leave it to Soderbergh to make even that kind of you-go-girl Hollywood
premise uniquely appealing. Julia Roberts stars as the real-life title
character, a twice-divorced single mother of three desperate for a job,
any job. She finds one at a small law firm headed by Ed Masry (Albert
Finney), where she bulldogs her way into a position doing filing. But Erin
stumbles onto something big when she investigates a real estate deal
pending in the California desert. It seems that families in the town of
Hinkley have been experiencing health problems at an unusual rate, and
that the local power company may be trying to hide its responsibility for
those problems.</P>
<P>     In most films of this kind, you would expect a combination of sassy
one-liners and courtroom theatrics. You do get some of the former --
courtesy a solid Susannah Grant script that gives Roberts plenty of
no-nonsense dialogue to bite into -- but there's a way Roberts plays a
line that keeps the film from degenerating into mundanely rabble-rousing
chick flickery. Roberts has her detractors, particularly when it comes to
her dramatic performances, yet ERIN BROCKOVICH finds her effectively
taming the glamour girl looks into a convincing character. Even when she's
snapping off one of Erin's saltier tirades against the lack of recognition
she's getting, Roberts never seems to be waiting for a laugh. She does one
of the hardest things anyone can do with a character like this: She
refuses to play Erin with a wink to the audience so we all know it's Julia
Roberts beneath the bitter exterior. She has the guts to play Erin with an
equally bitter interior.</P>
<P>     You also have to give Soderbergh his share of the credit for knowing
how Erin needed to be played, but it's no surprise to find him in control
of his material. In keeping with the less-than-sexy title of the film,
Soderbergh makes sure the case never overwhelms the character. While the
lawsuit against Pacific Gas & Electric makes for compelling drama, it's
not as compelling as Erin navigating the path towards self-respect. The
story features elements familiar from a hundred legal investigation dramas
in the Grisham era -- the nasty corporate monolith, gutsy underdogs,
saintly victims, etc. -- but ERIN BROCKOVICH always seems to find an
unexpected angle just when it's most necessary. When a PG&E attorney shows
up to throw some weight around, it's a youngster who squeaks out his
scripted threat in a barely-changed voice; when it's time to announce the
verdict, there's not a judge to be seen.</P>
<P>     ERIN BROCKOVICH does take its conventional turns, and -- not
coincidentally -- that's usually when it starts to meander. Erin's romance
with a soft-hearted biker named George (Aaron Eckhart) leads to a trite
"you care about your job more than your family" confrontation (think Sissy
Spacek's whine in JFK with a little gender role reversal), and there's one
moment of precocious sensitivity by Erin's son Matthew (Scotty 
Leavenworth)  that almost makes you want to shudder. Erin's relationship
with Masry (wonderfully played by Finney in one of his best performances
in 20 years) generates much more kick than any of her at-home
relationships, which leads to some sag during the domestic interludes. 
Still, Soderbergh and Roberts bring too much crackling originality to ERIN
BROCKOVICH for its study of character through hard work to suffer too
much. I'm not sure Steven Soderbergh's ERIN BROCKOVICH will set audiences
to applauding as they leave the theater. That would happen in another
director's version, one where the predictable doesn't have a way of
turning into the unpredictable.</P>
