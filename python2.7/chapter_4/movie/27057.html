"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Proof of Life is the second of three movies slated for release at the
end of 2000 containing actors that were or are in real-life
relationships.  First, there was the `are they or aren't they' duo of
Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow in the surprisingly good Bounce. Later
this year, viewers will be treated to Traffic, which, in addition to
being one of the year's best films, features newlyweds Michael Douglas
and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Sandwiched in the middle of these two strong
films is the decidedly lackluster Life, which boasts the presence of
current Hollywood cuddle-bunnies Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe.</P>
<P>Life opens in Russia, with a 10-minute, hyper-edited segment that
introduces Terry Thorne (Crowe, Gladiator) as the Kidnap and Ransom
Specialist (or `K&R,' for the hostage-savvy) for London-based Luthan
Risk International.  Basically, he's a negotiator who excels at bringing
home people who have been kidnapped - assuming, of course, that the
victim is employed by a business that is insured by Luthan.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, in Tecala, South America (it's Ecuador, although the film
never mentions the name of the country), a young American couple is
settling in after bouncing around between various other third-world
countries.  Peter Bowman (David Morse, Dancer in the Dark) is building a
dam to save villages from being flooded, and his company is being taken
over by a large oil company planning to build a pipeline around the
dam.  His wife, Alice (Meg Ryan, Hanging Up), is a chain-smoking flower
child whose hair is too perfect to even pick out Ecuador on a map, let
alone live there.</P>
<P>Long story short, Peter is kidnapped by rebel fighters, and Luthan's K&R
man Terry is called in to save the day.  But Luthan finds out that
Peter's company dropped their kidnapping insurance during their
corporate transition, and Terry is forced to give up the job, despite
his interest in both the assignment and Alice's cute button nose.  But
will the allure of the case and the nose be too much for Terry to
ignore?  What do you think, stupid?</P>
<P>The film follows two stories – one featuring Peter and his painful
ordeal (in which he actually turns into Tom Hanks in Cast Away), while
the other concentrates on Alice and Terry's attempts to rescue Peter
from the crazy rebels.  The trouble is that neither of the stories is
interesting enough to carry the film, although the former is, by far,
the more interesting of the two.</P>
<P>Many viewers will be watching Proof closely to see if they can pinpoint
the instant Crowe and Ryan fell in love.  I'll answer that question for
those people right now – you can't.  Not only is the chemistry missing
between the two actors, there isn't any between the two characters,
either.  When Terry and Alice finally kiss, it seems as forced as the
laughter at a taping of Hollywood Squares.  I almost forgot there was
supposed to be a romantic angle to the story, and wondered afterward if
it was added at the last minute.  The film's trailer and poster make it
seem like Terry and Alice will be doing a lot of running around together
to find Peter, but it never materializes.</P>
<P>The horribly paced Proof was directed by Taylor Hackford (The Devil's
Advocate) and was nicely lensed by Slavomir Idziak (Gattaca).  The
script was written by Advocate's Tony Gilroy, who based the story on two
different sources – a Vanity Fair article about K&R men, and an
autobiography from the survivor of a Columbian guerilla kidnapping. This
would explain the two separate stories, but it doesn't explain why they
were both such a bore.  Proof is as dull, routine and as eventful as a
trip to the grocery store.  It's a taut thriller that is neither taut,
nor thrilling, and it's unnecessarily long, too.</P>
<P>2:20 – R for violence, language and some drug material</P>
