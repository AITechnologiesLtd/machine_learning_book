<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Russian emigré Val Lewton produced this pulp fiction cinema about a
young girl searching for her missing sister who runs into a murder
amidst a group of NYC Satanists. Lewton's fingerprints are all over the
literary script that was made into an intelligent, well-crafted and
bizarre thriller. It is noirish in attitude and Gothic in tone, enhanced
by dark shadowy cinematography and Mark Robson's crisp direction, which
brings about a mixture of ominous danger and a feel for the offbeat. It
opens with a grim John Donne poem to set the stage for the upcoming
action, "I run to death, and death meets me as fast, and all my
pleasures are like yesterday...".</P>
<P>In an upstate boarding school, Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter) is told by the
headmistress
that she will have to leave school because her sister Jacqueline (Jean
Brooks) hasn't paid her tuition for months and can't be located. Mary
decides to go to NYC and see what's up with Jacqueline (Jean Brooks).</P>
<P>While searching for her missing sis, Mary is befriended by a couple who
own a quaint Greenwich Village restaurant and learns that Jacqueline
rented a room from the couple but hasn't been seen living in it.
Checking the room they discover a chair and a hangman's noose suspended
from the ceiling in an otherwise bare room. Mary gets further help from
the following individuals in her plight: Jason Hoag (Gage), a failed
poet, living in what goes for an impoverished poet's garret that has a
beautiful skylight (a place like that in the current Village real estate
market would go for a small fortune), who hasn't published in ten years
after writing a critically acclaimed first book, but who feels inspired
by Mary's innocence to help look for her sister. Irving August (Lou
Lubin), an ambulance chasing private eye, who is curious about the case
and decides to take it without his usual fee. He opens the wrong door
trying to get info for Mary and is stabbed to death by someone unseen.
Dr. Louis Judd (Tim Conway), a slick shrink treating and romancing
Jacqeline (certainly not ethical), has her hidden away on the pretext
that she's suicidal and deeply troubled, but helps Mary relocate with
her sister. Gregory Ward (Beaumont), Jaqueline's wealthy lawyer husband,
who is looking for his wife, even though the marriage is a failed one.
And then, there is Mrs. Redi (Mary Newton), a manager in Jacqeline's
cosmetic plant, who tells Mary that her sister sold her the business,
but Mary learned from August' investigation that Jacqeline handed the
business over to her without asking for a penny.</P>
<P>Mary is drawn into the strange world of Satanists when it is discovered
Mrs. Redi is a member of that cult, and that her sister joined because
she was bored and looking for kicks and was not really a believer in
such things, but didn't realize the dangers involved. The group had six
other cult members whom they considered as betrayers of their secret
world commit suicide, and Jacqeline is to be the seventh victim, unless
Mary and her friends can help.</P>
<P>It's easy to dismiss the film's flaws, such as cramming too much story
into such a short time frame of 71 minutes, but it is better to
concentrate on the artfully told B-film and all the personal touches
found that make the film so clever. When viewed that way, this
low-budget film is simply superb, equal to producer Val Lewton's "Cat
People" (42). For its time period of the 1940s, it bravely touches on
suicide as a necessary part of the plot and covers Satanic cults in a
mature manner, by showing that ordinary types can join such a cult. The
film hints at lesbianism and also reflects on characters with deep
repressions who are trapped by their psychological problems. The film
sold me as soon as I saw  Satanism prospering in the trendy confines of
bohemian Greenwich Village. "The Seventh Victim" caught in a poetic way
the arty Village atmosphere of the time and the feelings of doom the
characters all felt. There was also an eerie shower scene that predates
Psycho's, showing the threatening figure of Mrs. Redi wearing a hat and
the shadow she casts on Mary's shower curtain, which makes her look like
a Satanic figure.</P>
