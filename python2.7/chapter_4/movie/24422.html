<P>  When it comes to mockumentaries and comic
documentaries, no one can beat Michael Moore--whose
"Roger and Me" takes aim at the CEO of General Motors for
downsizing his workers and "The Big One," which further
exposes corporate greed and political corruption.  Perhaps
the best known mockumentary of the 1980s, "This is Spinal
Tap," has been digitally re-released with an expected
September 2000 delivery of a VHS and a DVD with extra
minutes of interviews.  But extra minutes of interviews and
TV appearances are not what this movie needs.  It could
instead use some pruning, because with its totally improvised
script, redundancies, and downright unfunny takes on the
rock music industry, some in the audience may feel like
taking an epidural to relieve the pain.  I am admittedly the
guy who is more irritated by the use of that awful speech-
filler, "you-know," than anyone else in the world, and this
expression is used by every musician in the cast--even by
the interviewer who is filming the comic action--more times
than I've heard it said in any other film.  Considering that 50
hours of celluloid was used to extract its 82 minutes of hardly
priceless material, you'd think that director Rob Reiner could
have paid his editor a little extra to delete some of these
inflaters, but flaws in speech are just one of the problems of
a movie that has only intermittent humor going for it.</P>
<P>   What does work in Rob Reiner's mockrockumentary is that
everything is played straight.  No one winks or grins at the
inanities and stupidities on display.  Instead all characters
speak in their own natural ways, oblivious to the vacuousness
of their homespun philosophies and analyses of the
ensemble's vision.  The characters, Christopher Guest as
guitarist Nigel Tufnel; Harry Shearer as bass
player Derek Small; Michael McKean as lead singer and
guitarist David St. Hubbins; David Kaff as keyboardist Viv
Savage; and R.J. Parnell as drummer Mick Shrimpton are all
musicians in their real lives, giving the film an added feeling
of integrity.  And since Rob Reiner, in the role of
mockumentarian Marty DiBergi, is the production's actual
director, the verisimilitude thickens.</P>
<P>   The waggery, which is sit-comish, relies on an ever-
increasing number of gaffes and misdirections by the rock
ensemble known as Spinal Tap, or just Tap, a group which is
seen in England just before it is to make a major North
American tour beginning in New York--where it receives a
rousing reception by the youthful, mostly male audience. 
Why the lack of women in the following?  One of the band
explains that their "equipment"--actually cucumbers placed
inside their pants at an appropriate location--scares the girls
away.  In one of the few situation gags that work, bass player
Derek Smalls is stopped at the airport check-in booth when
despite removing all the metal from his pockets, the
bewildered security guard needs to run a portable detector
across his body.  When the gadget hums at exactly the spot
that produces that sound on Tim Allen's body in Harold
Ramis's "Galaxy Quest," the offending cucumber, wrapped
presumably in tin foil, is removed, and the flight continues.</P>
<P>   As the aging group goes on a downward spiral, its
audience contracting from the 10,000 that would appear at its
apex and is now down to 1,500 at best, arguments break out. 
Artie Fufkin (Paul Shaffer), is blamed for non-existent
promotion while the record company owner, Sir Denis Eton-
Hogg (Patrick Macnee), objects to a sexist cover on the
album, depicting a greased girl on all fours being led by a
man with a leash who extends a glove to her to be smelled. 
An adolescent gag about one member's dying by choking on
vomit (not his own vomit, but since vomit is not dusted, no
one knows whose) is followed by yet another wisecrack,
allegedly written by music reviewer for a theologically-
decorated album cover, "On what day did the Lord create
Spinal Tap, and could not He have rested on that day too?"</P>
<P>   The movie, surprisingly enough, is best when the musicians
are allowed to strut their stuff, giving us entertaining music
with deliberately banal lyrics.  In the movie's most prescient
quip, Ian Faith (Tony Hendra), the group's manager,
dismisses the idea that the band is losing favor with the
masses.  "The fans are just becoming more selective," in
Faith's view.  "This is Spinal Tap" is likely to be picked up by
just such a "selective" fan base when it re-appears in
theaters on September 1.</P>
