TERMINAL VELOCITY
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>The outcome of the latest bloodbath in Balkans would
probably look like the ultimate humiliation for many
Russians. But, actually, the worst humilitation for that
former superpower lies not in the field of international
politics, but in the field of popular entertainment. Once
mighty empire is reduced to the source of stereotyped
villains and cheesy plotlines for uninspired and unoriginal
Hollywood filmmakers. One of such examples is TERMINAL
VELOCITY, 1994 action thriller by Deran Sarafian.</P>
<P>The movie protagonist is Ditch Brodie (played by Charlie
Sheen), maverick skydiving instructor who takes a flight one
day in order to give parachuting lessons to beautiful
stranger named Chris Morrow (Nastassja Kinski). During the
flight, he flirts with her, but simple glancing away is
enough for her to disappear from plane. The body is found on
the ground, but Ditch is convinced that he had put her
safety on. Faced with the manslaughter charges, he begins
investigation of his own that would lead him to Chris, who
seems to be alive and well. But it doesn't seem that it
would be for long, because both of them are involved in
conspiracy involving smuggling gold, and former KGB
operatives who want to overthrow Russian government and
restore Communism.</P>
<P>To be frank, I didn't expect much from this film yet I was
disappointed. It wasn't the preposterous formulaic plot
(certain mutant crossbreed between NORTH-NORTHWEST and Jan
de Bont's SPEED), nor the cardboard characters the viewers
don't care for. It wasn't even the not so original directing
(one particular action scene is actually literally borrowed
by Renny Harlin's DIE HARD 2). It wasn't Charlie Sheen,
whose charisma and couple of wisecracking lines actually
saved this film, turning it into unintentional comedy. The
biggest disappointment was Nastassja Kinski, who obviously
chose wrong film for her great comeback into the movie
industry. Although she looks charming, she is anything but
believable as tough intelligence operative, Russian to make
things even more interesting. Villains are more convincing,
as usual, although the main ones - played by James
Gandolfini and Christopher MacDonald - doesn't look like
Russian at all. However, although definitely and justifiably
forgettable, TERMINAL VELOCITY is a film that can provide
some entertainment for not very demanding audience.</P>
