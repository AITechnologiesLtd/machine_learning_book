<P>This film is being touted as the 90s version of PORKY'S or FAST TIMES AT
RIDGEMONT HIGH, and the conglomeration of last year's THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT MARY (7.5/10) and CAN'T HARDLY WAIT (7/10). It stars a bunch of
unknown teens in a raunchy script which actually talks about the main thing
that most kids talk about in high school: getting laid!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Four good friends, who all happen to be virgins, make a pact to get laid
before prom nite. Prom nite happens to be only three weeks away.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Finally, a high school movie that puts the "T" back in Teen flicks! Yes,
there is nudity in this film. Yes, there are masturbation scenes, oral sex
scenarios, intercourse montages, but nothing too graphic on the whole.
Mostly implied. Overall, the film features a few huge laughs (a la MARY),
featuring a doctored cup of beer, the by-now infamous apple pie sequence,
the Internet used to its full potential and a cute Mrs. Robinson vibe
nodding THE GRADUATE, and a lot of open talk about sex, masturbation, porn,
but nothing terribly insightful, shocking or hilarious for my taste. I was
personally hoping that this film would take more chances than it did, but
ultimately it seemed to go for the easy visual gag or toilet humor (one
pulled directed from the Farrelly's DUMB AND DUMBER (7.5/10)). Sure, I did
laugh at most of them, but the script seemed to play more like a few funny
sketches plotted against an average high school story, than a string of
laughs strategically laced through a unique script.</P>
<P>The couples in the film were also so-so, with one of them not really all
that interesting to keep track of, and another tapping into a sugary
fairy-tale ending. The few actors that did stand out for me included Jason
Biggs, who played the every-guy who we could all relate to (And yes, we've
all pulled a whack to scrambled TV porn!), Chris Klein reprising his
goofy-nice-guy role from ELECTION (7/10) (Two funny performances, but now
it's time to stretch, Chris) and Sean William Scott, as the jerk with all
the over-the-top insulting lines. Other than that, the film seemed to run a
little long, although they might cut it by release date, since our preview
was a "rough cut", and featured a decent teen soundtrack. Overall, I think
that the frank sexual content and dialogue in this film will be refreshing
to most teens, despite the script's lack of other innovative narrative
additions: it's still the nerds vs jocks, prom nite, kids lying about their
virginity, etc... A teen version of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY? Kind of.
But certainly not your average high school flick, and certainly eons away
from the safe teenage flicks bestowed upon us by the great John Hughes in
the 80s.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Big Ben Affleck's baby brother, Casey Affleck, makes a cameo in this film as
the "older, wiser brother".
Director Paul Weitz and producer Chris Weitz are brothers. They are known to
have co-written the screenplay for ANTZ (6.5/10). Born in New York, the
brothers are third generation Hollywood pedigree. Their grandfather was the
fabled agent Paul Kohner, who represented such legendary filmmakers as John
Huston, Billy Wilder and Ingmar Bergman and their parents are fashion
designer John Weitz and Academy Award-nominated actress Susan Kohner.
Californian punk-rockers BLINK 182 are featured on the soundtrack, and also
make an appearance in this movie. Their band name is derived from the number
of times Al Pacino uttered the F-word in SCARFACE (8.5/10).
This film was originally sold as the "Untitled Teenage Sex Comedy Which Can
Be Made For Under $10 Million Which Studio Readers Will Most Likely Hate But
I Think You Will Love". It then went through two other name changes, GREAT
FALLS and EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH. It also took this film four tries to get an
R-rating instead of an NC-17.
Actor Chris Klein got his big break in the acting world when he literally
bumped into director Alexander Payne (ELECTION) while he was scouting
Klein's high school as a possible shoot location for his film. Months later
when Klein was attending college at Texas Christian University, Payne cast
him in the co-starring role of Paul Metzler.
Actress Alyson Hannigan is best known to television audiences for her
regular role as Willow on TV's "Buffy, the Vampire Slayer".
Actor Thomas Ian Nicholas is also touring on the road with his band, "The
T.I.N. Men". Some of you may remember his girlfriend in this film, actress
Tara Reid, from her role as Bunny Lebowski in the Coen Bros' film THE BIG
LEBOWSKI (6.5/10).</P>
