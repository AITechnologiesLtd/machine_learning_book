<PRE>                              NIGHT ON EARTH
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>128 min., R, Comedy, 1992
Director: Jim Jarmusch
Cast: Winona Ryder, Gena Rowlands, Giancarlo Esposito,
      Armin Mueller-Stahl, Rosie Perez, Isaach de Bankole,
      Beatrice Dalle, Roberto Benigni, Paolo Bonacelli,
      Matti Pellonpaa, Kari Vaananen, Sakari Kuosmahen,
      Tomi Salnela, Lisanne Falk</P>
<P>     The film takes a look at five cab drivers, in five cities (Los
Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Helinski), in one night.  The first
city, Los Angeles, has cab driver Winona Ryder taking Gena Rowlands from
the airport to her house in Beverly Hills.  The second city, New York,
has cab driver Armin Mueller-Stahl, who has just come to the U.S. from
East Germany, who can't drive a cab, and who doesn't know New York, pick
up black Giancarlo Esposito, who takes over as the driver so he can
reach his destination.  The third city, Paris, has black cab driver
Isaach de Bankole, who picks up blind Beatrice Dalle, who complains
about everything.  The fourth city, Rome, has cab driver Roberto
Benigni, who picks up priest Paolo Bonacelli, and starts confessing to
him in the cab.  The fifth city, Helinski, has Matti Pellonpaa, who
picks up three drunks, Kari Vaananen, Sakari Kuosmahen, and Tomi
Salnela, and tells them a sad story.</P>
<P>     For the most part, NIGHT ON EARTH is a very funny comedy.  The
cities of Los Angeles, New York, and Rome are great.  Unfortunately,
the cities of Paris and Helinski are rather boring.  Thankfully, the
funny cities make up for the two boring ones making this film definitely
worth seeing.  On a scale of zero to five, I give this film a four.  It
would have gotten a five, if it hadn't been for Paris and Helinski.  If
this film was trying to be a drama, I guess Paris and Helinski would
have fit in to the film, but then the rest would not fit.  In my area at
least, the film was advertised as a comedy, and I really don't see how
Paris and Helinski fit into a comedy, unless they are some really black
segments that I didn't get.  Anyway, I highly suggest that if NIGHT ON
EARTH comes to a theater in your general area, and you like comedies,
that this film is worth full ticket price.  NIGHT ON EARTH is rated R
for explicit language and adult situations.</P>
<P>     I think that this film is completely original; at least I can't
remember any others like this one.  I also think that it was a great
idea.  I think that all the actors/actresses were well picked, except
for the blind girl, Beatrice Dalle, who was in the Paris segment.  The
rest of them do a great job.  Even though I didn't like the Paris
segment, I think that Isaach de Bankole did the best job in this film.
Winona Ryder had an interesting role as the tomboy taxi driver.</P>
<P>     Even though you didn't know any of the people's history when each
segment started, the characters were well enough written, for the most
part, that you became interested in them, and for some, like Armin
Mueller-Stahl's character, I found myself wanting to see some more of
their adventures.  Unfortunately, others, like Kari Vaananen, Sakari
Kuosmahen, Tomi Salnela, Matti Pellonpaa, Isaach de Bankole, and
Beatrice Dalle's characters I found to be so dry, boring, and sometimes
self centered (especially Dalle's) that I didn't care at all about them.
The drunks I especially hated, I really can't say why, but for some
reason I really disliked them (the cab driver too!).  Oh well, it was
still a good film.</P>
