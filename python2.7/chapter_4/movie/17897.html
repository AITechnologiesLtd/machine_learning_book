<PRE>The Matrix</PRE>
<PRE>[3.0/4.0]</PRE>
<P>Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker. He is talented, but he has a
general disrespect for authority. He is contacted by Trinity (Carrie-Anne
Moss), a mysterious fugitive who is connected to the infamous subversive,
Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). It seems that Morpheus wants Neo to join his
movement. At the same time he is being tracked by the authorities who want
his help in capturing Morpheus. It is no surprise that he chooses to join
the outlaws, and in doing so, he begins a surreal adventure, very similar to
"Alice in Wonderland".</P>
<P>At the core of the story is the distinction between perception and reality.
This is a very profound subject, and although it is not plumbed very deeply,
it is a much more intelligent foundation than can usually be expected from a
large-budget, special effects based action film. What the human mind
perceives as "reality" is the result of the signals that the human brain
receives from the eyes, ears, etc. However, it is well known that during
dreaming and with no sensory input, the mind constructs a very real world,
complete in all detail, which is obviously not part of the physical
universe. It would have been nice to see an engaging exploration of this
profound subject, but much more than what is attempted would probably
detract from the film's appeal to the mass market.</P>
<P>The narrative of the story is quite engaging. From the opening scene, it is
unclear what exactly is going on. This is very effective because it places
the audience in the same frame of reference as Neo, and only when Neo
understands the true "reality", does it become understandable. The film
mostly attempts to be intelligent and is usually successful, but sometimes
it cannot construct a seamless premise. The situation in which the humans
are placed is explained but does not fully make sense. There are often
inconsistencies in the powers accorded to different characters. There is
also the serious question of why an entity that defines the rules would not
be thus omnipotent and impenetrable. However, these weaknesses are mitigated
by the fast pace of the film and the unravelling of the mysteries. The film
is not meant to be a serious exploration of its philosophical elements, but
rather it is intended as a thrill ride, and it is quite successful in that
regard.</P>
<P>The acting performance are mostly unremarkable, but that is due mainly to
the writing and is not the fault of the performers. Considerable effort is
given in creating the story, but the drawback is that the main characters
are not fully developed, and the side characters are mere stereotypes.
Although Reeves is competent in the lead role, his performance is mostly
wooden, sometimes comically so. When Morpheus uses the term "AI" in
discussion with Neo, Reeves blankly asks "You mean Artificial Intelligence?"
in such a dry, moribund way that one cannot believe he is trying to portray
a computer hacker. To his credit, he performs well in the action sequences,
even paying homage to Bruce Lee in a Kung Fu fight.</P>
<P>The film cannot claim to be completely original. It borrows generously from
"2001: A Space Odyssey", the "Planet of the Apes" series, and it even has
many similarities to the recent "Dark City." It uses stock antagonists, and
other standard characters. However, the success of the film is that it
combines its sources into a balanced and cohesive result. It shows
remarkable restraint by not relying exclusively on special effects or action
to dazzle the audience at the expense of the story.</P>
<P>Recommended. It is definitely not a great film, but it is rather enjoyable.
It has an appealing mix of science fiction, Hong Kong style action, and
special effects that will appeal to a large audience.</P>
