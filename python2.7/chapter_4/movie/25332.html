<PRE>"Scary Movie" -- Getting Stabbed Is More Fun
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Since "Scary Movie" is nothing more than a silly
spoof, it would be unfair to measure it against the
same standards as you would any other kind of film. 
The plot, thin as it is, revolves around the myriad of
horror movies that have ever come out, and in
particular "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last
Summer."  In fact, one of the original titles
considered was "Scream If You Know What I Did Last
Halloween."  </P>
<P>In this parody, a mad slasher donning the frock and
ghost mask from "Scream" is plaguing a local high
school, and no one can figure out who it is or why
he/she is doing it.  But if you're even thinking about
trying to determine his/her identity or motive, then
you're completely in the wrong mind set.  Meanwhile,
the characterizations, shallow as they are, serve no
other purpose other than to usher us from one setup to
another.  The players in this film are a few of the
Wayan's brothers and a few other 20-something actors
who either fall victim to the mad slasher, scream at
the top of their lungs, and/or engage in heavy
tongue-kissing.  </P>
<P>Thus, the question that begs to be asked is: is this
funny enough to endure the 100-minute running time? 
In many ways, watching "Scary Movie" might remind you
of any recent installment of "Saturday Night Live." 
It starts off with funny material but then quickly
spirals downward as it becomes mired in unfunny
gross-out gags, jokes that are insulting rather than
irreverent, and a lineup of skits that strains for
laughs but instead is greeted by heads nodding in
disappointment.</P>
<P>The funniest, most clever, and probably least
offensive segment happens at the beginning of the
film.  Desperately trying to escape the masked killer
is a dumb, nubile blonde.  She comes across a table
loaded with a variety of powerful weapons...and a
banana.  Guess which one she picks?  Then, as she runs
outside, there are two road signs.  One points towards
safety.  The other points towards death.  Guess which
path she takes?  </P>
<P>There are some other funny tidbits including a take on
the "Wassup" beer commercials and a parody of "The
Matrix" (which would have been funnier if I hadn't
seen the movie trailer a dozen times), but the clever
ideas are at a bare minimum.  The tone of the movie
begins to shift.  Jokes become extravagantly gross
such as the butch, Swedish woman named Miss Mann who
has a secret that 'she' wants to expose.  This spawned
more "Ewwwws" rather than chuckles.  Gags also focus
heavily on sex.  There's a running theme about a
boyfriend who encourages her virgin girlfriend to
explore.  And there's another ongoing gag about an
effeminate jock who acts gay in every way possible but
constantly denies it.  The film also engages in heavy
stereotyping.  Admittedly, I was glad to see a movie
patron, who talked incessantly on her cell phone and
screamed at the onscreen actors as if they could hear
her, get what she deserved.  But the pleasures are
slim at best.</P>
<P>Juvenile, lewd, and only sometimes funny, "Scary
Movie" scores a 9 out of 10 on the Dumb-o-Meter, a 5
out of 10 on the Laugh-O-Meter.  And a 3 out of 10 on
the Whether-You-Should-See-This-Or-Not-Meter.</P>
