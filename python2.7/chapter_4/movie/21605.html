<P>   The state of Wisconsin has not fared well in the movies
lately.  Ralph Farnsworth gets laughed at for being from
"Wisconsin: the Party State," in "The Straight Story."  Susan
Sarandon can't wait to get away from Bay City in "Anywhere
But Here."  Matt Damon as a fallen angel is exiled to the
Dairy State in "Dogma."  And in "Wisconsin Death Trip,"
James Marsh exposes multiple cases of murder, madness
and mayhem in the Black River Falls, Wisconsin of the
1890s.  Now, in Scott Elliott's "A Map of the World," the
townsfolk in a rural Wisconsin burg misinterpret the words
and gestures of one of its outspoken residents, as Sigourney
Weaver, the urban transplant to a farm near Racine, makes a
painful transition from alien to outcast.</P>
<P>   "A Map of the World" confirms that of all the psychological
states you'll want to avoid, guilt is the real killer.  Of course,
you want to have a conscience--a sense of right and wrong,
as too many people seem to be adept at committing crimes
without the slightest compunction. But when you feel a sense
of dread for something you have done that has had tragic
consequences or for something you did not even do, be
prepared for the usual demons that send people running to
shrink their heads: depression, anxiety, nightmares, and self-
destructive acts.</P>
<P>   "A Map of the World," which opens for just one week in
December for Oscar consideration before commencing widely
the following month, is a picture that will boost Sigourney
Weaver's career several notches.  In fact, don't be too
surprised if the Academy will be juggling nominations that pit
Ms. Weaver against Tom Hanks, Kevin Spacey and Bob
Hoskins this time around.  She has the uncanny ability to
change her mood credibly from depression to a twinkling
blitheness, and back again to a tearful, near-breakdown
condition.  Watch her laugh almost hysterically when being
questioned by an investigator and you can sense her agony.
Don't be surprised if you do a double-take when she is put on
trial and answers a key question with a one word answer that
drives her own lawyer up a wall.  </P>
<P>   The film by long term Broadway actor and theater director 
Scott Elliott, from a novel by Jane Hamilton which was
adapted by Peter Hedges and Polly Platt, confirms Elliott as a
man who pays attention to visual detail and has a facility in
administering strong ensemble performances.  You may
wonder at the slow beginning, but will soon see that the
lengthy scenes of Alice Goodwin (Sigourney Weaver) juggling
the chaos of little kids in her farmhouse are there to show
how easy it is for a parent to be distracted for a moment, for
the twinkling that sets the stage for tragedy.  Alice and her
ditzy husband Howard (David Strathairn)--a guy who can
casually keep his hand in a cereal box while a panful of eggs
catches fire--are city people experimenting with life on a farm
outside Racine, Wisconsin (filmed north of Toronto).  The
Goodwins and their two children, the difficult eight-year-old
Emma (Dara Perlmutter) and five-year-old Claire (Kayla
Perlmutter), are recent arrivals, and in the tradition-bound
community they are considered outsiders.  Their one
friendship--with neighbors Theresa Collins (Julianne Moore)
and her husband Dan (Ron Lea)--is thrown into cataclysmic
jeopardy when the small daughter of the Collinses
accidentally drowns in the lake at the Goodwins' home while
Alice is distracted.  Racked with guilt, Alice is subsequently
accused by the sluttish Carol Mackessy (Chloe Sevigny) of
sexually abusing her child at the local elementary school
where Alice serves as nurse--the allegations presumably
encouraged by her neighbors' willful contempt for her as an
outsider and their attributing negligence to her for allowing
the little girl to drown.</P>
<P>   The choice scenes occur when photographer Seamus
McGarvey cuts back and forth from Alice's accommodations
in the Racine County jail, where the guilt-ridden woman puts
up no defense against the brutal sassing she regularly
accepts from fellow inmate Dyshett (Aunjanue Ellis), to the
setting at Theresa's home, where the distraught Howard
Goodwin comforts a disconsolate Theresa Collins to the point
of initiating an affair.  One detail made clear by the hostile
treatment Alice receives from many of her co-inmates is that
prison is hell largely because the inmates themselves make it
so.  Failing to bond, to see a common link to one another and
a class solidarity, they take out their frustrations on one
another, making their lives in close quarters an even more
damaging experience.  At Alice's trial, Arliss Howard turns in
a luminous, comical role as her clever lawyer, grinning his
way through the proceedings because, as he puts it, he
wouldn't want to be in the business if it were not fun.  </P>
<P>   Like "Anywhere But Here," a high quality movie made with
the same affection, "A Map of the World" is a searing yet
wholly believable journey of two people who are taken from a
closed, insular world into a new, unpredictable experience. 
Whether viewers have kids or not, they will likely be
immersed in the proceedings from the time that an innocent
child is drowned (evoking memories of "The Sweet
Hereafter"), through the remorse-ridden Alice's trial for sexual
abuse.  You'll think twice before deciding, like so many young
people during the sixties and early seventies, to uproot
yourself from an urban background, becoming an outsiders in
a stodgy, rural enclave.  The title comes from an imaginary
map which Alice had drawn of a fantasy world which
embraces a small, loving community.</P>
