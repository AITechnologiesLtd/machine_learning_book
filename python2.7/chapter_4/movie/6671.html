<PRE>                            DEFENDING YOUR LIFE
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Defending Your Life (1991) ***** out of ***** - C:Albert Brooks, Meryl
Streep, Rip Torn, Lee Grant, Buck Henry.</P>
<P>Albert Brooks is probably the smartest comedic talent working in films
today. He wrote and directed "Defending Your Life" which is one of the
brightest and funniest films of all time.</P>
<P>Brooks plays Daniel Miller, a business executive who is killed in a traffic
accident. He wakes up in Judgment City, a waiting grounds of sorts where you
have to "defend" your life on Earth. A trial is held for every person who
dies to see if they have evolved enough to pass on to the next step in the
universe. If they don't pass they are sent back to Earth to start all over
again and eventually if that person never evolves enough, they are "thrown
away". The trial is like a trial here on Earth with prosecutors, defenders,
and judges. During the trial, moments from the person's life are shown on a
big screen in the courtroom, while the two lawyers battle to prove if the
person has led a good life and overcome his or her fears.</P>
<P>This is a brilliant idea for a film and Brooks pulls it off perfectly. He
takes what people could consider a controversial subject (life after death)
and makes a film which I don't see how it could be offensive to anyone. It's
sweet, charming, romantic (during his stay, Brooks meets Meryl Streep and
they fall in love), it's clean (Rated PG), and most importantly, it's funny.
This is one of those rare films where every joke is a winner. The music by
Michael Gore is excellent. And the supporting cast does an outstanding job,
especially Rip Torn as Daniel's defender.</P>
<P>"Defending Your Life" is Albert Brooks' best film to date and those who
enjoy this film should also enjoy "Real Life", "Lost in America", "The
Scout", and "Mother".  All are written and/or directed by Brooks.</P>
