<PRE>                THIS IS MY FATHER (Canadian/Irish)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: An American schoolteacher (James Caan) travels to Ireland
to trace a father he never knew.  In uncovering the story he finds the
story of a good simple man and a tragic story of lovers kept apart by
prejudice and intolerance.  Aiden Quinn stars, his brother Paul
directs, and brother Declan photographs.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low +2
(-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Production of the Quinn Brothers based on the story of their own
     father.
   - Mournful score by Donal Lunny.
   - Kieran Johnson (James Caan) is an unpopular English teacher voted
     among the most boring by his class.  His life at home is equally
     bad with a rebellious son and a bed-ridden mother.  He decides to
     take time to go to Ireland and find out about his father Kieron
     O'Day (Aidan Quinn).  The story he is told puts his own life and
     his problems into perspective.
   - Kieron O'Day is a simple farmer with a hard life.  He romances
     Johnson's mother, played at this age by Moya Farrelly.  This
     arouses the ire of both the local priest (Stephen Rea) and of the
     mother of the woman he loves.
   - Priest is an intolerant man who curses O'Day from the pulpit,
     delivers fire and brimstone sermons, and chases a man from the
     confessional yelling after him "Get out and don't come back to the
     church until you stop doing that."
   - One happy night when out with is love on a beach,  Airplane lands
     with Life Magazine photographer (John Cusack) wanting to rest the
     night and looking for someone to play American football.
   - Nice representation of Irish village life.</P>
