<P>Poor Robert Forster.  He's responsible for two of the best onscreen
performances this year, but they're both in movies most people will never
see, even if audiences are lucky enough to have the films play in a theatre
near them. Forster's turn in the film adaptation of David Mamet's Lakeboat
is strong enough to be remembered at end-of-the-year award time, and his
latest, Diamond Men, might feature an even better performance from the
leathery veteran.</P>
<P>Forster plays widower Eddie Miller, a traveling diamond salesman approaching
60 like a school bus with no brakes.  After a heart episode leaves him
uninsurable and undesirable to his employer, Eddie is given a choice - break
in Bobby, his young, inexperienced replacement, or hit the road.  Because
he's worried about making the mortgage payments, Eddie opts for the former,
thus launching the tale of the older, wiser man and the young, brash dude
driving around Central Pennsylvania for several weeks.  You know they'll
dislike each other at first, but eventually warm up to one another. So why
bother?  The younger guy must be played by some hot, up-and-coming actor
like Mark Ruffalo, right?</P>
<P>Actually, no.  Bobby is played by Donnie Wahlberg, who, despite having
screen time in one of the biggest films of all-time (The Sixth Sense) is
politely referred to, at best, as either a washed-up has-been or Marky
Mark's balding brother.  But you know what?  He ain't bad, either.
Wahlberg's Bobby, an ex-vending machine supplier who scored well on the
psych portion of his test in diamond sales school, isn't so much brash as
naïve to the ways of the world.  He thinks he can just waltz into stores
owned by Eddie's clients and sweet-talk his way into boffo sales.  Unlike
Eddie, who has to be at the top of his game to stay afloat, Bobby sees sales
as something to do when he's not chasing tail.</P>
<P>Sure, there are the typical clashes between the two (over everything from
music to proper attire), but when Bobby shows a genuine interest in learning
the trade after a tough week on the road, Eddie takes him under his wing.
Bobby learns selling isn't an exact science, unlike the things he was taught
in training school.  "That's not what we learned in Providence" is a line he
repeats over and over again.</P>
<P>If Eddie has a mantra, it's "Protect the line."  He's referring to the
extremely valuable stash of diamonds the two men peddle, and because Eddie
takes so much care in guarding the stones, you know it'll somehow factor
into the film's last act.  What you don't see coming is how it happens.  I
won't go into the whole thing, but it involves another has-been (Jasmine
Guy, A Different World) and something called the Altoona Riding Club (which,
incidentally, was the original title of the film).</P>
<P>Men is a lot like Spring Forward, which featured another molasses-paced,
impeccably acted May-December relationship between two guys reluctantly
forced into friendship by their employment.  While I enjoyed Forward more as
a film, Forster's acting trumped the performances of Ned Beatty and Liev
Schreiber.  You hear Men is a film about an old salesman ready to be put out
to pasture and immediately conjure images of Willy Loman, but Forster's
Eddie is far from it.  Loman despised his job, but you can tell Eddie loves
it (especially the routine), even as he trains the man who will eventually
render him obsolete.</P>
