A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Stephen Sommers</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Stephen Sommers</PRE>
<PRE>Starring: 
Treat Williams, Famke Janssen, Wes Studi, Kevin J. O'Connor, Anthony
Heald, Djimon Hounsou</PRE>
<P>Ingredients: 
Giant growling octopus creature that attacks a luxury ship, small band
of armed travelers which includes elegant lady jewel thief and whiny
mechanic</P>
<P>Synopsis:
In the story, Finnegan (Treat Williams) is the driver of a rinkydink
boat and Joey is his whiny mechanic pal. Finnegan and Joey get captured
by well-armed DIEHARD-type commandos who plan to hijack and loot a big
cruise ship. The hijackers force Finnegan and Joey to boat them over to
the luxury liner, but in the process the little boat gets broken. And to
make matters worse, when they reach the cruise ship they find that
nearly all the passengers aboard the cruise ship have been devoured by a
nasty giant octopus that has mutant tentacles that have jaws on the tips
that open up to reveal smaller tentacles with more jaws that open up to
reveal even smaller tentacles with even smaller jaws! But not everyone's
dead. A beautiful jewel thief (Famke Janssen ) and the captain of the
ship (Anthony Heald ) also manage to crawl out of their hiding places in
the luxury liner to hook up with Finnegan and the hijackers. Now if they
can just beat the octopus and get out of there.</P>
<P>Taking a page from the ALIENS (1986) formula, the band of armed
passengers wages a running battle against the big sea beast as it lurks
in piping and ducts - - and picks off the hijackers one by one at
appropriate moments. Will Finnegan and friends be able to get to the jet
skis that conveniently happen to be stored on this cruise boat in order
to escape?</P>
<P>Opinion: 
What happens when you combine SCOOBY DOO characters (minus Scooby) with
a TITANIC ship and monsters the size of ALIENS and JURASSIC PARK? Then
you get DEEP RISING, an action spoof where a whiny pessimist, a pretty
lady, and a square-jawed young leader cross paths with a corrupt sea
captain and a giant octopus creature aboard a smashed luxury liner
overflowing with water. But right away you can tell it's not a serious
movie from the dialogue. When one of the panting characters barely
survives an octopus attack, he asks, "Do you just GET asthma, or do you
have to be born with it?" And as in SCOOBY DOO, the corrupt captain
would have gotten away with his plot, too, if it weren't for those
interfering young people. You've seen all the action scenes before in
other movies, but what they hey, it's a spoof.</P>
<P>Star Trivia:
Famke Janssen is a former James Bond girl and Dutch supermodel who is
said to wear size eleven shoes. Wes Studi is a Cherokee Indian who
played the bad Mohawk Magua in LAST OF THE MOHICANS. Djimon Hounsou is a
West African male model who played Cinque in AMISTAD, but in this movie
he's one of the mercenary bad guys. </P>
