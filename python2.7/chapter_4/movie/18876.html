**** SPOILERS ****</PRE>
<P>        I'll admit that what made me go see "Home Fries," an eccentric
romantic comedy that looked suspiciously like the gazillions of other
eccentric romantic comedies that have come out in the past five years,
was the name Vince Gilligan.  The man behind many of the greatest X-Files
episodes, a man known for his knack at combining humour with great
dialogue and in-depth looks at the Mulder/Scully relationship.  Quite
honestly, after viewing "Home Fries," I felt that the film was suspiciously
like the gazillions of other eccentric romantic comedies that have come
out in the past five years.  Suffice to say that I was disappointed, but not
really.  For what did I expect of Vince?  He got is start in 45 minute
episodic television.  In retrospect, this episode was exactly like some of
the episodes he's written: crazy, romantic, eery, right down to the
goofball murders and wacky townsfolk.  If I had looked really closely, I
might have seen some of the genius Vince has in writing about the sincere
and the genuine, the Southern Boy that he is.   Or it might just be a
figment of my biased imagination.  </P>
<P>        As much as I appreciate the morbid sense of humor the film has,
there's something that just feels not quite right about things.  Am I too
conservative, or does the romance between Dorian (Luke Wilson aka
Sheriff "Bad Blood") and Sally (Drew Barrymore) seem utterly contrived
and unconvincing?  Granted that it's a wacky world, but the way the script
was written it seems that those two fell in love because of a *La Maz
class*.  Not that I don't believe in rapidly developing romance, but not
under these circumstances, which are a little TOO morbid.  They're asking
us to suspend all sympathy we might have for a human being, and they
want us to believe in the "long shot romance."  I wish I had seen enough
movies or remembered as much so that I might cite a movie as a counter-
reference.  You never quite understand what the deal is with Dorian's
dysfunctional family, except that they're murderous and simple-minded. 
Hilarity ensues, romance develops, Sally and Dorian live happily ever
after.  Shot of cute baby.  Awww.  Add some moody songs and Addams
Family-ish score and you get your average ERC (Eccentric Romantic
Comedy).  Drew Barrymore is charming as Sally, if only because Sally is
simple, down-to-earth, not that hard to portray if you have a smile as
innocent and sweet as Drew's.  The same goes for Luke Wilson, whose job
is to look like the nice and sweet Southern Boy that he is.  An admirable,
entertaining effort by Vince Gilligan (and the other folks -- yes, I know
other people made this movie too <g>), but one that looks suspiciously like
your run-of-the-mill...  well, you get the gist.</P>
