<PRE>Sir Real, But Nice
Notting Hill</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Despite my lack of appreciation for Hugh Grant, "Notting Hill" rocks.</P>
<P>Hugh bumbles modestly, dropping clever leafy quips like a young Maple tree
in a light breeze. In the film, Julia Roberts plays a beautiful, mega-famous
actress of average talent. Ironically, reality holds the opposite to be
true: she's an average looking woman with fantastic talent as an actress.
Whether or not she's a "pretty woman" to you is a rather mute point since
she aptly plays the role.</P>
<P>Meandering into Hugh's travel bookstore, Julia and Hugh strike up a
passionate, but impossible romance. Hey, what is it with the bookstore
fascination in romantic comedies these days? ("Got Email," "The Love Letter"
to name just a two.)</P>
<P>This typical "complicated" romance vehicle is not what makes the picture
rock. Rather, it's the sharp, sometimes raw, British-fused humor -- most
apparent in the first 60 minutes. This half of the film taken alone deserves
5 stars, 2 thumbs. However, it being only 50% of the "big picture" ... would
that be 2.5 stars and 1 thumb? Hold the quotient, there's still the
remainder to factor in...</P>
<P>Like an off road 4x4 that eventually stumbles across the beaten path,
"Notting Hill" offers much less untraveled territory in the second half.
None the less, the crisp humor keeps familiar scenery from becoming stale.</P>
<P>Beyond the slight decline in intensity after its middle, the film has only
one other area barely in need of improvement. Anna Scott (Roberts) is most
often unpretentious and calm, but occasionally weilds a particularly selfish
temper. Falling victim, William (Grant) is shocked, but far less upset than
he has the right to be and not as much as we'd like to see him be.
Surprisingly light and fun overall, "Notting Hill" is good solid
entertainment.</P>
<P>Starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant.
Directed by Roger Michell. Written by Richard Curtis.
Produced by Duncan Kenworthy at Universal/Polygram/Working Title/Notting
Hill Pictures.</P>
