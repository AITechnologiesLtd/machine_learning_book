<P>     "I think the title [of LITTLE WOMEN] has been so off-putting for
men over the generations.  They feel this is a terribly 'girly' story.
But it's actually a wonderful epic tale about family where men's roles
are just as important and deeply involved in the story....  It is ...
full of heartfelt emotion and such memorable characters whose lively
appeal transcends the years."
          - Gillian Armstrong, director of LITTLE WOMEN</P>
<P>     This third, and most recent, film adaptation of Louisa May
Alcott's classic 1868 novel about family and crossing the barrier
between girlhood and womanhood, is a treatment for today's audiences.
As faithful to the original story as a two-hour production is likely to
be, LITTLE WOMEN is in ways similar and dissimilar to its two cinematic
predecessors (released in 1933 and 1949).</P>
<P>     This tale of four independent sisters of differing temperaments is
undeniably melodramatic, but it's very good melodrama, with an
accumulation of vitality and charm that elevates the movie to an
unexpectedly high level.  The basic plot of LITTLE WOMEN isn't terribly
original or invigorating; it's the effective realization of several
memorable characters that gives this film its strength.</P>
<P>     For those not familiar with the novel, it centers around the March
demesne of Orchard House in Concord, Mass.  With her husband away
fighting in the Civil War, Marmee (Susan Sarandon) is left alone to
care for her four daughters:  the volatile and imaginative Jo (Winona
Ryder), the sophisticated Meg (Trini Alvarado), the compassionate Beth
(Claire Danes), and the romantic Amy (Kirsten Dunst as a child and
Samantha Mathis as an adult).  The girls share a bond that no outsider
can penetrate, although there are some willing to make the
attempt--most of whom are men.  There's Laurie (Christian Bale), a
neighbor with a passion for the piano who becomes a friend to all the
Marches; John Brooke (Eric Stoltz), a poor tutor who is smitten with
Meg; and Professor Bhaer (Gabriel Byrne), a German immigrant who
develops a friendship with Jo.</P>
<P>     With rich, colorful cinematography (the Autumn scenes are
especially vibrant) and a fine score by Thomas Newman, LITTLE WOMEN is
technically accomplished.  It's the performances, however, that make
this movie special.  Winona Ryder fashions a near-perfect Jo, Alcott's
headstrong alter-ego in the fictional autobiography.  Had it been
demanded of her, the actress undoubtedly could have carried the entire
film.  However, this version allows the other sisters some development
independent of Jo, and all the actresses hold their own.  The only
hiccup comes as a result of the change in the aging Amy from the
energetic and charismatic Kirsten Dunst to the more sedate Samantha
Mathis.</P>
<P>     Christian Bale, after a couple of extremely weak performances (in
NEWSIES and SWING KIDS), finally displays some recognizable talent.  In
fact, Bale is so solid as Laurie that it's hard to credit this actor as
the same one who joined Robert Sean Leonard in the streets of Nazi
Germany.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the greatest fault--and some may not see it as such--is
that even the best-developed characters in LITTLE WOMEN display an
alarming lack of character flaws.  Everyone is almost always good,
kind, sweet, and pleasant.  Rare are the moments when someone says
something nasty or does something unsavory.  So much niceness
occasionally makes LITTLE WOMEN seem too sugary and scripted.
Nevertheless, the tale is engrossing enough, and the film put together
with such obvious affection, that it's not hard to dismiss those things
as necessary elements of a beloved period piece.</P>
