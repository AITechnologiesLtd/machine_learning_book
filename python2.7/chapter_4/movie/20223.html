<P>A Bug's Life
Featuring the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, David
Hyde Pierce and Denis Leary.
Rated G, 96 minutes long</P>
<P>A very cute and intelligent comedy that outshines its graphics, unlike most
Hollywood films.</P>
<P>   Disney has a way with animated features, otherwise known as cartoons.  Sure,
when we were young we loved cartoons.  "Inspector Gadget," "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles" being two prime examples.  But, as we grow older, we lose touch
with these cartoons.  But, Disney still keeps everyone coming back for more. 
Whether it be the starry eyed children or the frantic parents, a majority of
audiences leave Disney animated films with a positive mind.  In Disney's latest
feature, they turn to the folks at Pixar who brought us the dazzling Toy
Story.  Although A Bug's Life is not as good as its lofty
predecessor, it still provides a unique and entertaining experience.
   To get the familiarities out of the way, the voice casting is yet again
excellent.  Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey and especially Julia Louis-Dreyfus stand
out.  Their voice acting is superb, displaying all of the right emotions and
features.  Plus, Disney still gets some features of each actor/actress into the
looks of their characters.  I have seen this done by Disney for years, and yet
it still amazes me every time.  
   Pixar has done it again.  Despite the tremendous success of Toy
Story, Pixar still needed to come out and show the world it was not a flash
in the pan.  And they did a great job of it.  Overall, the film is not better
then Toy Story, although I doubted it would be.  But, the graphics are
better, and that was the job of Pixar.  In Toy Story, the animations
were groundbreaking.  But, they could have used improvement.  The one major
flaw was that a majority of the backgrounds were still.  However, A Bug's
Life called for lush and moving visuals due to the outside environment. 
Pixar delivered in a big way.  The lush graphics were tremendous with even
little details like grass blowing in the wind.  Simple details like this added
to the beauty of this film.
   The story is pretty basic, with no complexity.  Remember that this is still
a child's film and it needs to be reared for a child to view.  Disney has a way
with these films.  It is basically another David versus Goliath, dumbed down
for a child.  However, Disney is able to make it entertaining.  I know I gushed
on about the graphics, but I could do even more about the plot.  It has cute
humor and wonderful voice acting.  Despite being a children's film, it can be
viewed- and enjoyed- by anyone.  Which is why Disney is the reigning king of
animation.
   You rarely- and I mean rarely- find an animated film over an hour and a
half.  Which runs true with A Bug's Life.  But, that is usually what
makes the film enjoyable.  You can only take so much cuteness and
predictability in one film, no matter whom the film is geared towards.  That
also runs true in A Bug's Life.  The film, despite being short, still
runs its course too long.  The last twenty minutes are predictable, unless you
actually think Disney is going to kill off the main character in a G rated
film.  It drags on, but fortunately, ends with a perk and, fortunately, will
not leave a sour taste in your mouth.
   In conclusion, A Bug's Life is yet another critcal- and box office-
hit for Disney.  A Bug's Life is the perfect example of why Disney is
and always will be the king of animation.  And the help from Pixar certainly
did not hurt it.
