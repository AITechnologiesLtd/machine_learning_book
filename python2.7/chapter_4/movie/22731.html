<P> Next Friday (1999) Starring Ice Cube, Lisa Rodriguez, Don `D.C.' Curry
and John Witherspoon. Directed by Steve Carr.</P>
<P> "Next Friday" is a raunchy, innocuous little comedy relying mostly on
slapstick and scatology for its humor. The movie, a sequel to 1995's
"Friday," was written by Ice Cube, who also stars as he did in the
original.</P>
<P> The premise is simple: Cube's Craig, who only wants to survive in the
'hood, is sent packing to the suburbs to stay with his uncle after the
neighborhood bully he beat up at the end of "Friday" escapes from prison
and comes looking for him. </P>
<P> Craig discovers the ‘burbs can be just as wild as the city, as he
begins feuding with a Latino neighbor, smokes pot like it's becoming
scarce and falls for a beautiful woman -  a fetching Lisa Rodriguez, who
happens to be the sister of the Latino neighbors.</P>
<P> The entire affair is rather silly and slight. There is no attempt at
character development. Cube and director Steve Carr just want to pack
one joke on top of another, hoping the entire structure can hold. </P>
<P> And "Next Friday" is funny. If you enjoy lowbrow humor, it will afford
you several yuks.  And many of the characters are quite vaudevillian:
Craig's uncle, played by Don `D.C.' Curry, who lives in the suburbs
because he won the lottery; and Craig's dog-catching, taco-loving dad,
played by John Witherspoon. Ice Cube seems to be the ringmaster, playing
it straight while everyone around him clowns outrageously. </P>
<P> "Next Friday,"  at about 90 minutes, definitely will appeal to a
younger audience. </P>
