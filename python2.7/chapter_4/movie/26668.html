<P>_The_Legend_of_Drunken_Master_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>At long last, the American masses will get a glimpse of what Jackie Chan
can really do with the long-overdue wide release of his classic 1994 Hong
Kong production _Drunken_Master_II_, rechristened by Miramax as
_The_Legend_of_Drunken_Master_.  Considered by many Chan fans (including
myself) as the star's crowning achievement, _Drunken_Master_ compensates
for what it lacks in plot with hearty laughs and truly spectacular action
sequences--which still pack the same punch in this re-edited edition.</P>
<P>_Drunken_Master_, like all of Chan's Hong Kong efforts, has a plot that
is functional at best.  Chan plays Wong Fei-Hung (a character popularized
by the other HK martial arts superstar, Jet Li, in the
_Once_Upon_a_Time_in_China_ series), son of a doctor (Ti Lung) in
early-1900s China.  A master of the self-explanatory "drunken boxing"
style of martial arts, his skills come in handy when he inadvertently
stumbles upon a British scheme to steal Chinese artifacts.</P>
<P>A Chan film wouldn't be complete without comedy, and while he does some
great physical gags that emerge from the action scenes, the best comic
moments do not come from Chan but co-star Anita Mui.  A movie and music
sensation in Hong Kong--not to mention frequent Chan co-star--Mui is an
absolute riot as Fei-Hung's stepmother (a most welcome revision from the
original version, in which the visibly younger Mui played Chan's
biological parent).  As adept at tossing off verbal barbs as she is
selling broad slapstick that in lesser hands would be simply
preposterous, Mui has expert timing and darn near walks away with the
picture.  Thankfully, the surprisingly passable dubbing job does no
disservice to her work; likewise, neither does Miramax's subtle retooling
desecrate the Hong Kong cut: simple main titles as opposed to the lavish
credit sequences that are usually tacked on; a new score that actually
retains a strong Asian flavor; the wise excising of the original's
ludicrous coda.</P>
<P>Keeping Chan in full command of the film, however, is his amazing
fighting skill, which has never been showcased quite as well as it is
here.  Chan's Hollywood productions and his HK reissues tend to have a
big showpiece stunt, like the big fall he takes at the end of
_Rush_Hour_.  _Drunken_Master_, on the other hand, is a pure showcase for
his raw martial arts ability, which proves more dazzling than any huge
death-defying stunt could ever be (though, of course, said fighting is
dangerous in its own right).  From the exciting first fight--a
sword/spear battle that starts under a train--to the awesomely
choreographed, expertly staged final confrontation with a baddie played
by Ken Lo (Chan's real-life bodyguard), _Drunken_Master_ delivers action
goods that are sure to leave everyone absolutely breathless.</P>
<P>That is, everyone who shows up at the theatre--which, sadly, will likely
be a small group.  Thanks to some curious release choices
(_Twin_Dragons_?), reissues of Chan's HK work have suffered a steady
decline at the box office.  It's utterly baffling that Miramax waited so
long to release _Drunken_Master_; if released four years earlier to
capitalize on the heat of his spring 1996 breakthrough,
_Rumble_in_the_Bronx_, it would have surely sent Chan's stateside status
skyrocketing beyond the mid-level stardom he currently enjoys.   But if
there's any justice, the ever-dazzling _Drunken_Master_ should reverse
the trend of diminishing returns--if even for just this one film.</P>
