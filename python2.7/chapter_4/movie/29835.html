<P>Synopsis: Young policeman Jake Hoyt (Hawke) wants to join an elite 
narcotics task force run by Alonzo Harris (Washington). As a trial run, 
Hoyt accompanies Harris for a day, only to discover that Harris' tactics 
are scarcely better than those of the crooks themselves. As Hoyt descends 
farther into Harris' world, it soon appears that he will have to give 
himself over to his mentor's point of view -- or face the consequences.</P>
<P>Review: Despite its topical nature, "Training Day" is a movie likely to be 
remembered less for its storyline than for the performances which enrich 
it. Washington and Hawke are incredible to watch, crafting rich characters 
with little obvious effort. As Harris, Washington treads just close enough 
to outlandishness to be memorable, without losing his gritty real-world 
roots. He is a villain, but one borne of all the corrupt bureaucrats and 
civil servants which darken our places of power. Hawke, on the other hand, 
is comparatively naive, but not to the point of ludicrousness. Hoyt is 
appalled by Harris' actions, but is worldly enough to accept them and try 
to deal with them; the concept of a man like Harris is not completely 
beyond the bounds of his reality. To these proceedings, Fuqua brings a 
raw, snappy directorial style, favouring minimality over excess. When Hoyt 
is high on pot, Fuqua reflects this with little more than a sickly yellow 
haze onscreen, eschewing more flamboyant effects. Unfortunately, while 
Ayer's script is riveting at first, it goes somewhat off the rails in the 
final reel, burdened with a dubious chain of coincidences and an overblown 
Hollywood climax. Nonetheless, as a character drama and as a stark 
reminder that life on the urban streets -- be it as denizen or as cop -- 
is never black and white, "Training Day" is compelling.</P>
