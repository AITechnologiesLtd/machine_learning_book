<PRE>JOY RIDE
A film review by Blake French
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Ever make someone else the brunt of a practical joke -- only to learn
the joke is really on you?  The characters in Joy Ride have, and after
the lessons they learn, you can bet they'll never, ever tease anyone
else again.</P>
<P>Joy Ride has clearly learned from similar, high-octane road thrillers
like Breakdown.  It calculates every move, but seldom do we see the
surprises coming.  The film explores the misadventures of a college
student named Lewis (Paul Walker).  Lewis is a nice guy, having just
bought a used car to travel all the way across the country to help a
friend in need (Leelee Sobieski).  Along the way, he also stops to post
bail for his troublemaking brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn), and give him a
ride as well.</P>
<P>Fuller buys a CB radio at a gas station to chat with the truck drivers
who cruise the deserted highways of Nevada, and soon they receive a
signal from a man with a deep, scruffy voice who calls himself Rusty
Nail.  Fuller thinks it would be funny if Lewis pretended he was a woman
and sexually teased Rusty Nail.  Lewis reluctantly agrees and eventually
invites him to a hotel.  They will stay in room 18, while they tell
Rusty Nail to visit room 17, where a fat, grumpy man will rest for the
night.</P>
<P>Not a very nice thing to do, and Rusty Nail doesn't particularly
appreciate the prank.  So little that the police find room 17's lodger
on the highway the next morning, lying in a permanent coma with the
lower half of his jaw ripped off.  And this is only the beginning,
because Rusty Nail wants revenge, and he'll stop at nothing to get it.</P>
<P>Joy Ride builds an incredible amount of tension, then releases it with
some startling violent encounters.  This works, but eventually becomes
somewhat redundant after the third or fourth time around the track. 
That does not terribly injure the film, however, for several reasons. 
We don't know who is behind the voice of Rusty Nail or the steering
wheel of that massive semi, as the mystery and suspense always keep us
guessing.  We also care about the characters; the actors' performances
are believable, as is the terrifying reality of the situation.  As well,
the story continually raises the stakes, introducing new conflicts and
characters, and exploring new environments, thanks to a well-written
script by Clay Tarver and J.J. Abrams.</P>
<P>Thankfully, the film doesn't go overboard with needless gore and
violence.  The cinematography is also some of the year's most effective
work.  The characters' faces dimly lit by red neon hotel lights or the
soft glow of a fire, the mood contributes to the tension of the film.</P>
<P>Sadly, the ending an abuse of the old deus ex machina contrivance. 
Sure, we're on the edge of our seats, but really, it's a bit lazy.</P>
