                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Michael Biehn, Sam Elliott,
Bill Paxton, Dana Delaney, Powers Boothe, Stephen Lang.
Screenplay:  Kevin Jarre.
Director:  George P. Cosmatos.</P>
<P>     After a few decades when Westerns were about as easy to find as
Jimmy Hoffa, it seems like you can't sneeze at the movies these days
without hitting a horse.  The success of DANCES WITH WOLVES and
UNFORGIVEN has inspired a whole herd of giddyap yarns.  In 1993 we've
already seen POSSE and GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND, and now comes the
first of two Wyatt Earp projects set to hit theaters in a six month
span (a Lawrence Kasdan/Kevin Costner project is due in late spring).
TOMBSTONE is the name, ma'am, and surprisingly lively entertainment is
the game.  While no great piece of art, TOMBSTONE is a real
old-fashioned shoot-em-up, energetically staged and acted and featuring
a particularly memorable performance from Val Kilmer.</P>
<P>     TOMBSTONE opens in 1879 as Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) arrives in
Tombstone, Arizona to join brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan
(Bill Paxton).  Although a legendary lawman in Kansas, Wyatt insists
he's retired, content to run a small casino in the booming mining
town.  However, peace and quiet are not in the cards for the Earps.
The wild and violent Cowboys, led by Curly Bill (Powers Boothe) and
Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn), hold Tombstone in a perpetual state of
lawlessness, and eventually the violence escalates into the legendary
showdown at the OK Corral, with the Earps and gambler Doc Holliday (Val
Kilmer) facing a group of Cowboys including Ike Clanton (Stephen
Lang).  But even that battle is not the end, as Tombstone becomes the
nexus of a blood feud which won't end until one side or the other is
completely dead.</P>
<P>     Director George P. Cosmatos is best known for the ultra-violent
RAMBO, and TOMBSTONE shows many similarities.  There is a great deal of
montage-style violence, and an armory full of bullets fired.  It's
action that TOMBSTONE is about first and foremost, and it delivers big
time.  There are few slow stretches, and they usually build towards
something.  The big shootout at the OK Corral might be the least
effective of the action pieces; it's edited in a fairly confusing
fashion which may accent the chaos of the situation but doesn't always
make it clear who's shooting whom.  Otherwise the action is extremely
well-choreographed, backed up by a Bruce Broughton score a bit too
reminiscent of his work on SILVERADO.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, the action is where the comparisons to RAMBO end.
TOMBSTONE is well-acted by its ensemble cast, in spite of the most
distracting (if authentic) facial hair this side of GETTYSBURG.  Kurt
Russell, never the most versatile of leading men, does bring an intense
and reluctant heroism to Wyatt.  He's particularly good in a couple of
scenes where he uses his reputation to force other men to back down,
burning holes in them with his eyes.  Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton are a
bit more wooden in less-developed roles, but for the stoic and
civic-minded Earps it's not a distraction.  The lead Cowboys are
uniformly good, notably Stephen Lang as the cowardly Ike Clanton and
Michael Biehn as the icy Johnny Ringo.  However, the real star of
TOMBSTONE is Val Kilmer, who has a devilishly wonderful time with the
acerbic, sickly Doc Holliday.  Sure, his lines are campy and
anachronistic, but they are also quite funny.  He drawls out his quips
with a sly confidence, and turns in probably his best all-around
performance yet.</P>
<P>     TOMBSTONE's one glaring misstep is spending any time at all on the
relationship between Wyatt and a traveling actor played by Dana
Delaney.  Delaney is lovely, but her character is just a distraction
(as, unfortunately, are all of the female characters in TOMBSTONE),
never adding anything in particular to the story or to Wyatt's
character.  Their scenes together seem simply to be a nod to the
conventional wisdom that you need a love story to get women into the
theater.  While it's spending time wandering through the flowers,
TOMBSTONE is nothing special, but when it sticks to its guns it
generally finds its target.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 shootouts:  7.</PRE>
