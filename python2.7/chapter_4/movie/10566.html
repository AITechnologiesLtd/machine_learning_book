<PRE>                               THE BOXER
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     "You can't believe the relief it was to feel the pain," Danny
Flynn tells his ex-sweetheart, Maggie.  Danny, once an IRA terrorist
has been incarcerated for most of his adult life.  Released for good
behavior, his feelings have been bottled up inside until his recent
boxing match, when he was beaten to a pulp.  Although he was convicted
for his IRA activities, which he now renounces, his passion has always
been boxing.</P>
<P>     Daniel Day-Lewis in another of his meticulous performances plays
Danny in THE BOXER.  Emily Watson, whose 1996 performance in BREAKING
THE WAVES has been unsurpassed by any actor since then, plays Maggie.
In an underwritten role, she manages to shine with her intensity and
sincerity.  The chemistry between them is taut and real.  The
complication in their affair and the reason it has trouble getting
rekindled is that she is married to an IRA member in prison.  Even
dance with a prisoner's wife, and the IRA will blow your knee caps off,
or worse.</P>
<P>     A beautiful story with wonderful performances by an ensemble cast,
it suffers a single but all-encompassing problem, the over-restrained
tone set by the director, Jim Sheridan.  Sheridan, whose previous films
with Daniel Day-Lewis were MY LEFT FOOT and IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER,
normally brings emotional fire to his subjects, but this time he takes
a too cerebral approach to the material.  You can almost feel him
keeping his actors' emotions in check.  At certain points in the story,
when things are going most awry with Danny, the picture comes into its
full glory, but at others it just hints at what could have been.</P>
<P>     Sheridan's meticulous staging of the IRA activities at the time of
a truce has an almost documentary authenticity.  The details, including
the way they smuggle in Maggie's father, Joe (Brian Cox), since he is
an IRA big-wig, are fascinating to watch.  And when Joe, who wants to
negotiate a peace treaty, is challenged by Gerard McSorley in a
chilling performance as Harry, one of his lieutenants, the tension is
palpable.  Harry doesn't trust anyone, least of all someone from the
other side offering an olive branch.  Joe's peace negotiations are
prima facie evidence to Harry than Joe has sold out.  The result makes
for an unglamorized view of the IRA's inner workings.</P>
<P>     Danny sets up a "nonsectarian" gym ("The Holy Family Boxing
Club"), in which both sides of the struggle meet and box.  A radical
but subtle pacifist, Danny becomes a symbol of the struggle for peace
and thus hated by Harry and his men.  Against this backdrop, the
romance between Danny and Maggie tries to unfold but their constraints
are too strong.</P>
<P>     A disappointing show but a powerful one without a bad performance
in it, it never quite engages the audience.  The last third of the
story, especially the ending, where things don't go according to plan
brings out some of the strong passions that are rarely in evidence in
the rest of the picture.  Even given its flaws, its haunting images are
likely to stay with you for a while.</P>
<P>     THE BOXER runs 1:50.  It is rated R for violence and profanity and
would be fine for teenagers.</P>
