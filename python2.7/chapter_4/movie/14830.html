Gallo. Co-written by Alison Bagnall. Produced by Chris Hanley. Photography,

Corrigan, Mickey Rourke, Rosanna Arquette, Jan-Michael Vincent. A Lions
Gate Films release. 112 minutes. Not Rated (vulgar language, strippers, but
no sex)</P>
<P>Vincent Gallo, born 1961 in Buffalo, N.Y., has been a painter, rock
musician, poster boy for Calvin Klein, and an actor in well over a dozen
movies, several of them European, most of them not widely seen in the USA
except perhaps for The Funeral and Palookaville (and Arizona Dream?). Most
of his roles were supporting. His latest appearances are in:  Goodbye,
Lover (by the esteemed Roland Joffe), a thriller with comedy starring
Patricia Arquette, Dermot Mulroney, Ellen DeGeneres, Mary-Louise Parker,
Don Johnson, in which Gallo's credit comes as No 10; and L.A. Without a Map
(by Finland's Aki Kaurismaki) where Gallo is the second male lead.</P>
<P>In some ways, Buffalo '66 is an ego-trip, but an arresting one and
excusable in someone who is seemingly as interesting as Gallo. This is his
first feature as director and almost everything else (se credits above).</P>
<P>He plays Billy Brown, who is released after five years in jail. A
nondescript, hirsute, dirty-haired, intense man in ill-fitting clothes, he
may look at first like someone you'd hate to meet in a dark night, but on
short acquaintance you realize that he is no true aggressor, and on longer
acquaintance you understand that he is a fellow with problems, a sad sack
whose worst enemy may well be his own self.</P>
<P>Billy leaves a Buffalo prison on a cold, snowy day. As he shivers, he acts
like someone who does not know what to do next, except for one crucial,
immediate aim: to empty his bladder. His several attempts to do this may
look comical, unless you've experienced them yourself. He even tries to
seek warmth and urinary relief by asking to enter the jail. Whether
invented by Gallo or unconsciously derivative, this is the first of several
references to older movies (cf. Chaplin's Modern Times) or stories (cf.
O'Henry's The Cop and the Anthem).</P>
<P>Billy's vain search for an unloading site culminates in a tacky tap-dancing
school where he meets tackily dressed student Layla (Christina Ricci), a
buxom petite who'll have to watch her diet as she grows up. With his
bladder still full, Billy improbably finds time to call his Ma. The call is
both funny and pathetic. Then he kidnaps an unresisting Layla, orders her
to accompany him to his parents' house, to pretend she is his adoring wife
and confirm that he, Billy, is a CIA operative who, for reasons of secrecy,
has remained incommunicado for the last five years!</P>
<P>By now, absurdism, comedy and sadness have taken over.Their amalgam works
very well.
The Browns make up an abysmally dysfunctional trio. The parents obviously
couldn't care less about their son. Dad's (Ben Gazzara) sullenness and
flashes of paranoid ire show perhaps where the manic Billy got his genes.
Mother (Angelica Huston) vague and empty-headed, has a sickly passion for
the Buffalo Bills team. She spends all of her time glued to the TV,
watching re-runs of games. She still resents Bill for her having missed the
only game in her life, the 1966 Superbowl, because the child chose to be
born on the day.</P>
<P>Bill's motivation for visiting parents he doesn't love or even like, is not
explained. We can guess, however, that he is trying to come to terms with
his past and that he has a futile, unrealistic hope of belatedly gaining a
family that he never had. Or to show them that he has become someone. The
long section in that tacky home (a copy of the last place where Gallo
himself lived with his parents) is a splendidly inventive buffet of
grunginess,  somberness, comedy and ultimate hopelessness.</P>
<P>While neither Billy or his folks can even begin to relate with each other,
Layla takes her play-acting to heart. The film tells us nothing about her,
except for what we see here and now. It says nothing about her past, her
present, her character, her background, her family. Yet the subtext is
there: Layla dreams of better things and of love. The unreluctant kidnapee
finds herself inventing stories about her "husband," romanticizing him,
charming the parents, and finally announcing that she is pregnant, to the
joy of Pop and Mom who lavish maudlin affection on her while ignoring Billy.</P>
<P>The quartet of actors is excellent. Note that Ben Gazzara was part of the
repertory troupe of the late John Cassavetes, whose style had quite a bit
in common with Buffalo 66's. (I absolutely must plug here Saint Jack
(1979), a masterful, way underrated film by Peter Bogdanovich, with a
terrific Gazzara as a pimp in South-East Asia).</P>
<P>Having failed to get a family, Billy turns his attention to revenge on the
Buffalo place-kicker who, he thinks, had sold out a crucial game, cost
Billy $10,000 and eventually sent him to jail.  Several episodes take place
after this point. They deal with the relationship of Billy and Layla who
gradually falls in love with him; encounters at a Denny's; the slow
rounding up of Billy's psychic portrait; the unorthodox sharing of a shabby
room in what we might call a Motel 3;  a reluctantly happy finale.</P>
<P>Buffalo 66 combines hyper-realism with imagined points of view, wishful
thinking and grim facts, the present  tense with the past. I can find
nothing about Gallo's educational experiences, but watching his movie, I
was increasingly certain that his foreign films, including three with
French director Claire Denis, directly or indirectly gave him European
perspectives which he artfully (instinctively perhaps, but not artsily)
blended with his background in American movies. Repeatedly I was reminded
of several techniques used by the French New Wave.</P>
<P>He shot with reversal film, the kind used in home movies. Here it results
in saturated colors that , among others, capture with power the lonely day
or night in sights of desolate areas within an industrial city. In
flashbacks, somewhat a la Godard or Truffaut, Gallo uses effectively
squarish picture-within-picture inserts which focus the eye while stressing
drama or humor.</P>
<P>A scene in which Layla, out of a blue sky, tap-dances amateurishly, recalls
the equally amateurish. would-be seductive dance of Anna Karina in Godard's
My Life to Live. Also very Godardian are the repeated images of Billy and
Layla taking their pictures inside an I.D. photo booth, the constant
telephoning (see Breathless) and more. There are New Wave-ish dialogues,
abrupt transitions, non-sequiturs and more, but neither cloned nor
copy-catted.</P>
<P>With much of it based on Gallo's own unhappy childhood, the film plays as a
work of revenge on parents by a loser, not so much a born loser but a made
loser. This goes a long way toward explaining its caricatural aspects,
grotesque characters, over-the-top acting, all exaggerations which in
theory could have been liabilities, but in fact make the movie memorable.</P>
