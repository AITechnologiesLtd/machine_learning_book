<P> Like the wonderful 1990 drama, "Awakenings," starring Robin Williams and 
 Robert De Niro, "At First Sight, " directed by Irwin Winkler, is 
 inspired by a true story documented by physicFirst Sight, " directed by 
 Irwin Winkler, is inspired by a true story documented by physician 
 Oliver Sacks. Since "Awakenings" was so very good, and made my top ten 
 list the year it was released, "At First Sight" is not quite as strong 
 since it is not directed with as sure a hand as Penny Marshall, but is still
 an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama.</P>
<P> The film begins as Amy (Mira Sorvino), a stressed-out New York 
 architect, decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the 
 country. At the hotel she is staying at, she makes a massage appointment 
 and after a long, soothing session which ends with her crying as a 
 release of emotions, she strikes up a conversation with the handsome 
 masseur Virgil (Val Kilmer), only to find out later that he is actually 
 blind. Amy doesn't really care if he has a handicap or not, and begins 
 to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in 
 love. Once she has returned to New York, Amy begins to research on 
 Virgil's certain type of retinal blindness, which he has had since three 
 years of age, and out of a stroke of luck, comes into contact with a 
 doctor (Bruce Davison) who believes he can repair Virgil's sight, even 
 though there have only been thirty similar cases in history. At first 
 reluctant, Virgil finally travels with Amy to NYC and agrees to the 
 surgery, much to the hesitance of his overbearing, but loving older 
 sister (Kelly McGillis). Ultimately, the surgery is a success, but 
 problems arise since Virgil cannot relate to what he sees, since he has 
 never visually seen anything before, only touched objects. He moves into 
 Amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him, but Virgil's 
 maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship.</P>
<P> On the basis of the overall story, "At First Sight" is indeed a film 
 that has been done many times before, and owes a great deal to its 
 predecessor, "Awakenings." What will happen throughout the film can also 
 be easily telegraphed in advance. However, what helps "At First Sight" 
 rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent 
 relationship that develops between Virgil and Amy. Usually, romantic 
 pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort (the recent Tom Hanks/Meg 
 Ryan-starrer "You've Got Mail" immediately pops to mind), but with this 
 film, I grew to care more about the characters and their plight. </P>
<P> The film starts off noticably well as Amy travels up north and first 
 meets Virgil. The massaging sequences were strangely erotic, maybe even 
 more so than the later actual "love scenes," and as their romantic 
 involvement quickly developed, the film was both entertaining and sweet, 
 and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two. These joyous 
 moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their 
 relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles 
 that they have always known, with Virgil completely used to being blind 
 and having a comforting, peaceful life in the country to Amy's eventful 
 life in the "big city."</P>
<P> The other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly 
 flawless performances across the board. Val Kilmer, usually cast in the 
 "macho" type of role, was always believable as a blind person, and 
 playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears. 
 It was up to Kilmer to not come off as someone to pity, but to 
 sympathize with, and he pulled it off. Mira Sorvino, who made a 
 spectacular debuting splash in 1995's hilarious Woody Allen comedy, 
 "Mighty Aphrodite," for which she won a well-deserved Oscar as a 
 kind-hearted, but ditzy hooker, is a standout here. Although she has 
 made some mediocre film choices since then (1997's "Mimic," 1998's "The 
 Replacement Killers"), she always has managed to come out unscathed, and 
 it is with "At First Sight" that she finally has another juicy role to 
 play. In a truthful climactic scene set in Amy's apartment between she 
 and Virgil, Sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses 
 around today, and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces. 
 Kelly McGillis, who could have easily come off as the "bad," 
 one-dimensional sister, instead is also given an unexpectedly 
 multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective 
 but simply cares for her brother. Finally, Nathan Lane, who is usually a 
 little too over-the-top, is appropriately restrained as a vision 
 therapist.</P>
<P> The one misstep of "At First Sight" is in its treatment of the medical 
 procedure done on Virgil. Very little is ever said or discussed 
 concerning it, and when the surgery occurs, it is so briefly glimpsed at 
 that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes. Perhaps the 
 reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers 
 were afraid it would gross out audiences, but I would personally take 
 realism, even if it is graphic, any day over simply giving the 
 explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder. In "Awakenings," the 
 patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed.</P>
<P> Because of how strong the screenplay, written by Steve Levitt, is in the 
 way it deals with the main relationship, and because of the fabulous 
 performances from Kilmer and Sorvino, the film's few problems can be 
 swept over to the side. The adult way that the romance is depicted by 
 director Irwin Winkler is, no doubt, in respect to the real-life couple 
 that the film was inspired by, who are still together after many years 
 (even though the setting of the film was changed to New York). Since 
 January is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground 
 from bad movies, "At First Sight" comes as a refreshing and 
 sophisticated change of pace.</P>
