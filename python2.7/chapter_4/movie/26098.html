<PRE>DUETS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Bruce Paltrow's DUETS, a would-be comedy about competitive karaoke 
singing, is about as much fun to watch as a bad karaoke singer.  
Actually, it's worse, since the karaoke singers in the film aren't bad 
enough to laugh at.  Instead, too many of them are so good that you 
wonder if they're lip-synching.  With its low energy and its leaden 
script, the movie has almost nothing going for it except the presence of 
Bruce's daughter Gwyneth in the cast.</P>
<P>Watching the intelligent Gwyneth Paltrow trying to play a dumb character 
like Liv is at best disconcerting and at worst embarrassing.  Liv is one 
of many people in this road-trip comedy who are traveling to Omaha, 
Nebraska for the chance to earn the $5000 first prize at a karaoke 
contest.</P>
<P>The rag-tag collection making the journey includes a large cross-section 
of people who are down on their luck and trying to change it.  Suzi 
(Maria Bello, the bar owner in COYOTE UGLY) barters her body across the 
country.  Her price list includes oral sex in return for a car paint 
job.   Billy (Scott Speedman), a taxi cab driver whose last girlfriend 
was caught cheating on him with his pudgy, older partner, provides Suzi 
with transportation across country in return for her being "nice" to 
him.</P>
<P>The ditzy Liv first meets her father, Ricky Dean (Huey Lewis), at the 
funeral home where her mom's dead body rests.  Ricky and Liv become one 
of the story's many karaoke singing duets.  About the only part of their 
routine that's memorable is Liv's beatific smile.</P>
<P>The only interesting character, a middle-class revolutionary named Todd, 
is played by Paul Giamatti (BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE).  After his wife gives 
him the modern equivalent of "I've got a headache" -- "Honey, I'm 
on-line here," she tells him without looking up from her keyboard -- 
Todd flips out.  Shortly thereafter, Todd begins to look and act like a 
skid-row wino with violent tendencies.  Wearing a big earring, clothes 
that look rolled in dirt and a scruffy beard, Todd stays constantly 
drunk.  After he meets up with an escaped convict who sings like an 
angel (André Braugher from FREQUENCY), Todd uses his gun to shoot up 
several establishments who don't provide the level of service that he 
expects.  The movie's best on-going joke involves Todd's inability to 
use any of his 800,000 frequent flyer miles.</P>
<P>"What is karaoke?" Todd asks when he first hears about it.  "It's a rush 
like you won't believe!" replies one of its participants.  One of the 
many problems with DUETS, besides being a comedy that's not funny, is 
that this "rush" is never present on the screen.  </P>
<P>The movie leaves us with one question.  Why did Gwyneth Paltrow agree to 
do this movie?  Yes, her father undoubtedly asked her, but, at her age, 
she's old enough to be able to say no.  Sometimes even parents have 
really bad ideas.</P>
<P>DUETS runs 1:52.  It is rated R for language and some sexuality and 
would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
