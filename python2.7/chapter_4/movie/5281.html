<PRE>                                  LONE STAR
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     LONE STAR can be simply described as an incredible mess.</P>
<P>     John Sayles, darling of the indie film movement, has created
this picture, an epic study of racial tension in mythical Frontera,
Texas, a border town in the Rio Grande Valley.  (The film was
actually shot in Eagle Pass, quite a ways upriver from the Valley.)
Set against the backdrop of a son investigating his father's
involvement in the murder of a sheriff some 40 years earlier, Sayles
wanders, SHORT CUTS-like, through the lives of 15 or so major
characters. </P>
<P>     The film is full of excellent performances, including Chris
Cooper (Sam Deeds, the current sheriff and investigating son),
Matthew McConaughy (Buddy Deeds, his dad, in flashback), Kris
Kristofferson (the evil and long-dead ex-sheriff Charlie Wade),
Elizabeth Pe=F1a (Pilar, Sam's girlfriend), and Frances McDormand (in
a cameo as Sam's ex-wife).  The problem is that Sayles's script could
have used some work, as it meanders through 2 1/2 hours of plot that
is mostly irrelevant to the primary story line.  One of these
side-tracks involves Pilar's Mexican family, their prejudices, how
they want to teach Texas History, illegal immigration, and a host of
scattered other themes.  Another subplot involves the black
community, a closing Army base, a family drama between grandfather,
father, and son, and how this all fits in with the 40-year old murder
(answer:  very, very sketchily). </P>
<P>     Sayles's biggest problem is that he likes the sound of his
writing so much that he lets it go on forever.  In fact, he
continually prefers to *talk* about things that have happened than to
actually *show* them happening (thus violating the first rule of
screenwriting).  It's no wonder that your legs (and mind) are asleep
when the movie's over. </P>
<P>     Sayles also has a poor understanding of what the Valley is
really like, giving it a large black community that simply does not
exist there.  With LONE STAR, Sayles is trying to jam every racial
theme he's ever thought of into one movie, but he fails due to this
glaring inaccuracy (and interestingly, it's that very subplot which
is the poorest). </P>
<P>     By the time the engrossing final 15 minutes arrive, we're
already too bored to care too much.  Sure, there are a few nice
twists along the way, and as a director, Sayles's use of flashbacks
is well-done and breaks up the monotony of the script.  Also, the
aforementioned solid acting does a lot to give this otherwise
mediocre film some credibility.  A real editor (Sayles did that, too)
would have saved the picture, though, by trimming off 45 minutes. </P>
<P>     Finally, with this serious drama set in remote, rural Texas,
Sayles will achieve two things with certainty:  1) That most critics
will drool all over him with praise, and 2) that no one will actually
pay to see the film.  Sorry, John.  RATING:  ***</P>
