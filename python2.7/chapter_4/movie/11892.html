<PRE>Homicide (1991)

A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: One of David Mamet's most underrated and unseen movies; a
blunt-nosed and memorable story about a man waking up to the sound of his
own soul.</P>
<P>The criminally underrated HOMICIDE is one of David Mamet's best movies. It
is not as clever or devious as HOUSE OF GAMES or THE SPANISH PRISONER, but
it strikes markedly different notes than either of those films. Among many
other things, it's also one of the few recent movies that deals
intelligently with the notion of ethnic identity and the subordination of
same -- and the consequences of that subordination.</P>
<P>HOMICIDE features a cop, Bobby Gold (Joe Mantegna), who has tried to keep a
great deal about himself on the back burner. He is a Jew, but he has
developed a whole arsenal of reasons for closeting that part of himself
away. Case in point: when another officer calls him a "kike", he flinches
and cocks his fist, but we get the feeling that he's doing it more out of a
sense of obligation. Someone calls you fighting words, you fight. HOMICIDE
is not about the fight per se, but about the motives.</P>
<P>The plot centers around a candy-store murder. An old woman, the proprietrix,
was shot dead in a robbery, and her son, a doctor, more or less drafts Gold
into investigating the killing. The doctor assumes that Gold will give a
damn by dint of his own Jewishness, but he doesn't. Or, more accurately, he
tries not to, and has it blow up in his face. This is interwoven with
another case that Gold is trying to work on -- a drug dealer on the run --
and, like Gold, we don't realize that he can't resolve either case without
getting a few issues about himself straightened out. </P>
<P>The dialogue is vintage Mamet: fast, sharp, spattered with invectives and
expletives, but always at the service of the story and the characters.
There's one scene that perfectly dramatizes how ugly dialogue can be made to
serve the larger purposes of a movie: Gold is on the phone, ranting about
the fact that he's been yanked off the drug bust and put on this pathetic
candy-store shooting. Out of his mouth emerge words that he would consider
vile coming from anyone else, and it isn't until he's shown up later on that
he realizes what he has done.</P>
<P>Mamet fills the production with a gallery of actors he's familiar with and
lets them do their stuff, like jazz musicians who are in a tight ensemble
together: William H. Macy, long one of my favorite actors; Mantegna; J.J.
Barry, Ving Rhames. They all work, and they all convince us that there's a
lot more going on here than is only hinted at on the surface. Especially in
the case of Bobby Gold, who is a classic case of a man trying very hard not
to know who he is. Then one fine day, he catches up with himself.</P>
