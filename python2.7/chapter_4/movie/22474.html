<P>Add another title to the continuing, large number of French film 
remade as  Hollywood productions. The original was the 1960 thriller 
"Plein Soleil," (called "Purple Noon" in Anglo countries) by Rene 
Clement (The Battle of the Rails,  Forbidden Games, Gervaise,  Is 
Paris Burning? etc.)</P>
<P>In the early 1950s wealthy American Mr. Greenleaf, whose son Philip 
(Maurice Ronet, 32) was whooping it up in Italy, hires young Tom 
Ripley (Alain Delon, 24) to go to Italy and bring back the playboy. 
The film was the beginning of very good-looking Delon's stardom, 
reinforced by the Italian "Rocco and his Brothers," "The Eclipse" and 
"The Leopard." Swiftly he reached superstar/heartthrob status, and 
very rich. Ironically for the man who played a killer and mpostor in 
"Plein Soleil," years later he was more than suspected of connections 
with the French Mafia --and worse.</P>
<P>Patricia Highsmith (1921-1995), an American expatriate to Europe 
where she was much appreciated, wrote five Ripley novels. "The 
Talented Mr. Ripley" is the second of the series and the first to be 
filmed. Later came Wim Wenders's "The American Friend."</P>
<P>The talented Mr. Minghella is British of Italian extraction, wrote 
and directed the imaginative "Truly Madly Deeply,". which is 
wonderful; directed "Mr. Wonderful" which is not but still good; 
scripted and directed the triumphant "The English Patient."</P>
<P>The original movie's is excellent, though its leads are Frenchified. 
In the remake, the main lines are the same. Tom Ripley, a pianist who 
lives in poverty in New York as a men's room attendant, is mistaken 
by shipbuilder magnate Herbert Greenleaf for a Princeton schoolmate 
of his profligate son. His recompense for returning the errant Dickie 
to the USA is $1,000. In the late 1950's, the movie's period, this 
now paltry sum wenta very long way abroad toward La Dolce Vita  fun, 
games, fast Alfa-Romeos, fast everything and everybody.</P>
<P>Tom, who has no special looks, suntan, or overt sophistication, worms 
his way into Dickie's household through talented, confidence-man 
tricks. Dickie lives high on the hog, is reasonably dissolute, crazy 
about jazz, plays the saxophone, seems happy with his would-be writer 
girl Marge.</P>
<P>He does mock Tom for being rather rusticated, but he becomes 
friendly, treats Tom like a pet, buys him suits and stuff, takes him 
around, notably to a jazz club (excellent music) where Tom scores 
through his musicianship. He does not score with women. There is 
already a soupcon of gayness or bisexuality. It will get amplified 
but still treated with kid gloves.</P>
<P>Tom, having tasted the "good" life,  cannily plans and plots away. 
But his ultimate aim is not immediately apparent --probaly not even 
to himself, as he is something of a secret psycho. Still, friendship 
is good, but, in complex ways  it leads to a major dispute at sea, 
during which Tom kills Dickie. Next thing you know is that Tom 
impersonates Dickie.</P>
<P>I will say little about the plot, twists, complications and the other 
parties involved in it. The developments are interesting, the 
zig-zags good, the suspense quite effective. But not as effective as 
it might have been.</P>
<P>There are several reasons for this. In no order of priority: too many 
improbabilities, narrow squeaks; coincidences. Too much tight timing. 
Too many tricks by Tom, yet they work without any major glitches 
when, in real life there would have been several. Tom paints himself 
into corner after corner, yet he always manages to get out of them in 
"accelerando" tempo.</P>
<P>Much of the story is elliptical. Apparently, the film would have come 
to over four hours had it not been severely edited. I presume that 
the cutting down process came at the price of some abruptness and 
muddling.</P>
<P>There are several, discreet influences of Hitchcok, including the 
decision to make this a character-driven movie. Including also 
passing details, such as Bernard Herrmann-like sounds. I wish 
Minghella had looked more closely  at what King Alfred had wrought. 
He would have learned that Hitch kept everything clear and clean, so 
that the viewer would not be distracted and waste time wondering or 
puzzling -- at the expense of suspense. Minghella director should 
have studied Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train," which has several 
points in common with "Ripley" -- and was also based on a Patricia 
Highsmith novel, her first to be filmed.</P>
<P>The moral of "Ripley" is that, yes, you can fool all the people all 
the time. I will not get into the conclusion of the movie, but anyone 
who knows that other Ripley books followed can guess that Tom is a 
survivor.</P>
<P>In spite of my objections I find the movie taut (if not tight), 
gripping, colorful, even beautiful--in its many Italian settings. The 
supporting characters are interesting and effective. Small parts ( a 
young working-class woman, a deaf landlady); mid-parts (an Italian 
detective and an American detective; a likable choir master); major 
parts ( New York heiress Meredith and t  obnoxious American-abroad 
Freddie).  Gwyneth Paltrow as Marge is mostly decorative --and even 
then, seldom photographed through flattering lenses. Weaknesses 
notwithstanding, this is a three-star film</P>
