<PRE>                                GRUMPY OLD MEN
                       A film review by Sarah M. Elkins
                        Copyright 1994 Sarah M. Elkins</PRE>
<PRE>1993, comedy</PRE>
<P>PLOT/KICK-OFF:  A free-spirited teacher moves in across the street from
two old guys with an old feud, inspiring them to woo her and play dirty
tricks on each other.  The plot is a little contrived in a few places.</P>
<P>CHARACTERS/ACTING: Jack Lemmon plays John Gustafson, a retired teacher
alone except for his daughter (Daryl Hannah) and nasty neighbor Max
(Walter Matthau).  John's relationship with his daughter is a bit
strained, but Max gets along fine with his son (Kevin Pollack), who
tries to keep the guys from getting out of hand while campaigning for
mayor.  Ann-Margaret plays Ariel, the new neighbor.</P>
<PRE>CINEMATOGRAPHY/FX: okay</PRE>
<PRE>SCORE/SOUND:  A mix of good and okay tunes, some choices a bit
obvious.</PRE>
<P>VIOLENCE/GORE/LANGUAGE:  Some of the insults and sexual euphemisms are
a bit crude, but didn't seem out of character for those who said them.
One fight, but everyone's well-padded in winter clothes.</P>
<P>SKIN/SITUATIONS:   A kiss and Ann-Margaret in a leotard is the most we
see; more is suggested.</P>
<P>ANALYSIS:  The comedy in this movie is mostly, but not completely,
derived from the feud.  It ranges from insults to simple slapstick to
some tricks with clever set-ups.  Refreshingly, the movie doesn't
depend on a lot of pop-culture references to show how hip it is, and it
takes some time to develop its characters subtly instead of firing off
10 jokes a minute in the hopes that one will stick.  I'm a big fan of
Jack Lemmon so it's to be expected that I would like it as much as I
did  -- nice to see him in an entertaining comedy for once, instead of
all these deathly serious things he's done lately -- but my friend who
saw it with me is not a big fan and she laughed as much as I did.  If
you can roll your eyes to get past some of the crudities and
contrivances, you might enjoy this simple, unpretentious little
comedy.</P>
