LIFE OF BRIAN
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Monty Python, legendary British comedian troupe, usually
divides people into two very distinct camps. Some consider
them comedic geniuses and literally worship all their
incarnations - all episodes of BBC show, songs, books and
movies. Other simply can't digest their rather strange, dark
and twisted sense of humour and, accordingly, can't fathom
what was so special about them. The author of this review
belongs somewhere in the middle. I first encountered Monty
Python in late 1980s, when former Yugoslav television aired
BBC show. Initially, I was somewhat disappointed - some gags
were truly funny, some were hard to understand. Later, when
I watched the entire show for the second time, I learn to
appreciate their humour a little more, but I still don't see
them as undisputed kings of comedy. That notion is
strengthened with my experiences with Monty Python films
that turned to be disappointments. The only exception is
LIFE OF BRIAN, directed in 1979 by Terry Jones. Before
watching I had entire film spoiled thanks to my friend who
happened to be most enthusiastic Monty Python fan. The
resulting lack of surprises didn't prevent huge outbursts of
laughter when I watched LIFE OF BRIAN for the first time.</P>
<P>Interestingly enough, LIFE OF BRIAN is somewhat obscure
chapter in recent film histories. It could be explained with
the fact that it tackles subject which is rather sensitive
for too many people around the world - religion, or to be
precise, fundaments of Christian religion. The movie
protagonist is Brian of Nazareth (played by Graham Chapman),
ordinary bloke from Judea who just happened to be born few
blocks away from Jesus. He doesn't like the fact that he is
bastard son of Roman centurion, and his hatred of Romans
leads him to join People's Front of Judaeo, group of rather
idle revolutionaries. Their attempts to overthrow Roman yoke
are mostly unsuccessful and in the process, Brian not only
brings the attention of the authorities, but also of the
masses that see long awaited Messiah in him.</P>
<P>For me, LIFE OF BRIAN is the best Monty Python film because,
unlike in all the rest, Monty Python jokes are held together
with more or less coherent plot. But that doesn't mean that
the film is conventional in any other sense. For example,
all members of Monty Python team are playing different
characters, yet in doing so they give each of them something
unique, so even those viewers who are unfamiliar with Monty
Python's unconventionality won't notice it. It is hard to
single out the best one among that multitude of characters
and incredible performances, but Graham Chapman as Brian is
probably the best answer. His performance is especially
touching when we take into account that the actor died few
years after the finishing of the film. Other good episodes
also stand - like Terry Jones as Brian's mother Mandy, John
Clues as revolutionary leader Redge, Michael Pallin as
Pilate, Michael Pallin as Ex-Leper and Eric Idle as Stan who
wants to be called Loretta. Even Terry Gilliam, the least
recognisable part of the team, has impressive role of
Jailer, and the other actors are fine too, including Sue
Jones-Davies as Judith, the only real girl among
revolutionaries.</P>
<P>Jokes in this film aren't just verbal, but visual too. The
film is directed by Terry Jones, whose latter record wasn't
that impressive (ERIK THE VIKING). But, in the barren and
simple settings of Tunisia provide quite adequate setting
for the whole story, and Jones is doing fine job. Gilliam's
animation is used only in opening titles, so it is not too
distracting. Members of Monty Python team also used greater
creative freedom of feature film, and provided this film
with enough quantities of four-letter words, blood and gore.
Graham Chapman entered movie history as the main participant
in the most spectacular film scene that involves full
frontal male nudity.</P>
<P>Some Christians, naturally, didn't like this film. It was
considered blasphemous, theatres showing it became favourite
target of picketing Christians, and Norway banned it. Those
who see this film as an attack on Christianity and Judaism
may have some point, although the film authors defended
their work as satire not on religion itself, but the way
religion is presented to the masses. Some jokes in this film
are hard to understand without familiarity with biblical
movies; members of Monty Python team probably noticed that
people in such movies hardly talk in behave in the way
normal people would. Jesus (who appears in a cameo role
played by Kenneth Colley) is mostly left out of picture, and
film concentrates on his contemporaries, but some parallels
with biblical events are impossible to ignore (miracles,
crucifixion etc.). Movie could be viewed as an attack not on
religion itself, but on its most absurd and dangerous forms,
like blind faith and fanaticism that accompanies it. The
criticism of fundamentalism and traditionalism on the right
is nicely contrasted with the way this film takes stabs at
radicalism on the left side of political spectrum. People's
Front of Judaea and their rivals in the Judaean political
underground could be viewed as author's commentary on
various extreme left-wing groups drowned in self-destructive
factionalism and even more irrationalism acts of terrorism
that marked 1970s. Some humour in this film is less
ambitious, like farcical and surreal scene of UFO abduction,
which could be seen as authors' comment on STAR WARS
crazyness. But even in such jokes, humour is great, although
some, like the one involving wall graffiti, require benefits
of the classical education. Some jokes, on the other hand,
aren't very funny or that effective.</P>
<P>But, despite those flaws, LIFE OF BRIAN remains one of the
best underapreciated films made in last hundred years. Time
would silence its critics, and new generations would watch
it, laugh and think about its messages. Probably the best
homage to LIFE OF BRIAN happened in 1982, during Falkland
War. Same as the film's protagonist, surviving crew of HMS
Sheffield, sinking British warship, found comfort and
encouragement in the ending song and its immortal lyrics
"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life".</P>
