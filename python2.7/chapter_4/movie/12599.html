<PRE>THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Bart Freundlich
Starring: Rod Scheider, Blythe Danner, Julianne Moore, Noah Wyle, Michael
Vartan, Laurel Holloman, Brian Kerwin, Hope Davis, James LeGros, Arija
Bareikis</P>
<P>"The Myth of Fingerprints" is the "art house" version of every Thanksgiving
film you've ever seen, complete with a large disfunctional family, long
lost loves, new love found, bickering, sex, and even two parents who aren't
sure what to make of their grown-up kids.  It has everything that other
Thanksgiving films have except a sense of realism, a way of communicating
these fears to the audience, and even a bit of originality.  Hell, I even
swear I saw the house in every other Thanksgiving movie as well.</P>
<P>The story concerns itself with a New England family coming together for
Thanksgiving, and spending a couple of days at the big house with the
parents, and sadly, every child is either a cliche or a stereotype (or
sometimes neither, and not even a person).  There's Mia (Julianne Moore),
who's "the bitch who begins to wisen up thanks to someone else;" Warren
(Noah Wyle), who's "the disaffected guy who doesn't really get along well
with his parents and has a long lost love who's in town for awhile;" Jake
(Michael Vartan), who's just, like, there; and Leigh (Laurel Holloman, from
"The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love"), who's the "wacky
child."</P>
<P>And three of them have romances or significant others with outsiders.  Jake
has a girlfriend, Margaret (Hope Davis), who's basically just horny and a
tad too honest.  Warren's long lost love (Arija Bareikis) comes to see him
and they hit it off again.  And Mia has a boyfriend or husband, Elliot
(Brian Kerwin), who spends the entirety of the flick pissed of at Mia's
bitchiness, but ends up falling for an old school chum named Cezanne (James
LeGros), who starts off as being compeltely annoying and overbearing but
takes a 180 degree turn and becomes the intelligent guy she always wanted,
who's willing to discuss a book she tried to read but couldn't finish
because her father used the last 300 pages as kinling.</P>
<P>And last but not least, there's the parents, Hal and Lena (Roy Scheider and
Blythe Danner, respectively), who come out as the reason this film works
even slightly, partly because they're given a shade of mystery, and we
never completely understand them.  The film was obviously written from the
point of view of the younger generation, who are so young they don't yet
understand their parents, and this lack of knowledge actually works because
deep down, our parents are complex and shadowy figures who we will probably
never figure out completely.  Why did Hal kiss Warren's girlfriend when she
began sort of flirting with him?  And why does Lena still love him if not
more than she did before?</P>
<P>It's the parents that I was really intrigued with, partly because the
children were given such shallow roles.  Why should we really care if Mia,
a bitch, finds new love when we could be more intrigued with the parents
who act strangely but still love eachother?  Why should we really be
fascinated with a cliched story like the one about Warren getting aquainted
again with his ex-girlfriend when we see a mother and father dealing with
their kids growing up, and feeling more human instead of god-like beings?</P>
<P>If "The Myth of Fingerprints" had stuck with the concept of parents
becoming equals with their kids yet still remaining mysterious people, it
may have been a really amazing film.  Instead, we get cheap subplots that
were probably chalked up in a second to bulk up the storyline, and we end
up being distracted by them in the long run.  What saves the film from
being terrible is the concepts of the parents, and a good amount of acting
from the entire cast, with special mention going to Moore, Holloman, Wyle,
LeGros, Davis, and Danner.  Roy Scheider actually does amazing, as he's
being kind of bad as of late in films (did you see "Romeo is Bleeding?" 
okay, no one did).  He's actually given a scene where he sits on the edge
of one of his son's beds in the middle of the night, singing a song, and
looking more pathetic than crazy.  Not many actors can pull that off.</P>
<P>The film's final shot is something which makes this film seem more special
than it actually is: it's poetic, unnerving, sad, and realistic, all at the
same time.  When you see it, you'll understand.  If it had not tried to be
so much like a "families suck" picture and instead become a reflection on
kids growing up and parents just getting older, then this final shot would
have been even more meaningful, and probably worthy of the film it's now
stuck in.</P>
