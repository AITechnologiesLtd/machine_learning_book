<PRE>Patch Adams
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Mediocrity is a pox on civilization. In our heavily consumer oriented society,
there is an enormous demand to churn out "stuff." What would happen to our
economy if we didn't feel the need to have more things? To make us buy more,
businesses need to produce a ton of product. The sheer volume of items
necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality.</P>
<P>The film industry is like any other. In order for studios to survive, they
have to make money. The prevailing attitude is that more films equal more
profit. </P>
<P>Some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that,
less talented people are used. There aren't enough great directors and actors
to create the number of films necessary. For some reason, it's never crossed
anyone's mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit.</P>
<P>Often, mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous
ones. At you can have a good time making fun of bad movies.</P>
<P>I'm not suggesting that "Patch Adams" was tossed out just to rake in the
bucks. My guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel. It features an
accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story, but it's as dull as
could be.</P>
<P>Hunter "Patch" Adams' (Robin Williams) desire to become a doctor has an
unusual genesis. Checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide
attempt, he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around. </P>
<P>Patch could be a poster boy for co-dependency. He explains that he likes
devoting himself to others because then he doesn't focus on his own problems.
He decides that he wants to be a physician, leaves the place and a couple of
years later enrolls in the Medical College of Virginia.</P>
<P>As a med student, Patch's antics at the school's hospital catch the attention
of his soon to be arch-enemy, straight-laced Dean Walcott (Bob Gunton). The
dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants Patch kicked out of school
although he's one of the top students. He writes in Patch's academic file that
he shows "excessive happiness."</P>
<P>I walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its
odd mechanical pacing. There also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the
early seventies. Then it struck me. It must be based on a true story. The
movie is an adaptation of a book by Hunter Adams who founded the Gesundheit
Institute, a free clinic.</P>
<P>Robin Williams is an amazing actor. While he is adept at dramatic roles, his
forte is over-the-top free spirits. That's what makes his failure here so
remarkable. Patch is exactly the character he should be best at, yet even the
scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary
squirrels falls flat. Something holds him back.</P>
<P>Most of the rest of the cast is two-dimensional. For a film that champions
seeing patients as human beings, it's curious that the ones here are cardboard
characters. Peter Coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he
seems like a real person. Unfortunately he's in the film for only about two minutes.</P>
<P>The audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene.
We're not left to our own emotional decisions: we're hit over the head with
them. Shaved-headed children with cancer, an elderly woman whom Patch makes
laugh, a beautiful woman  who can't love because of her abusive history. When
a group of students fix up an old house to use as a clinic in the Andy Hardy
"Hey, let's put on a play! We can use the barn and my mom can make the
curtains!" mode, they laugh and roll around while painting each other.</P>
<P>There might as well be giant signs flashing: "Feel good now!" "Feel bad now!"</P>
<P>"Patch" is a good title for the film. It is a patchwork of every manipulative
scene you can think of. The full-of-life student fights stodgy establishment
types. There's a touching death. Then there's another. The film doesn't trust
us to get it the first time. The dean tries to kick Patch out and later he
tries again.</P>
<P>Worst of all is the final courtroom bit. Scary-looking old men sit in judgment
of a man who only wants to help people. The room is packed with Patch's
supporters. Williams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity
of all. It has as much emotion as his earlier statement "humans are the only
animal that kills members of its own species" contains truth.</P>
<P>Most of the blame must be placed with the director Tom Shadyac and
screenwriter Steve Oedekerk. Shadyac also directed the first "Ace Ventura"
movie. Oedekerk directed the second one. Need I say more?</P>
<P>The real Adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as
people rather than diseases. The film has a number of worthy messages about
the state of the modern medical business with HMOs and managed care. The
"doctors are not gods" theme will resonate with a number of people, but it's
so poorly produced that no one will care.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for over 23 years. After being
inundated with Y2K information, he thinks that Kevin Costner's "The Postman"
might have found a bigger audience had it been released late this year.
