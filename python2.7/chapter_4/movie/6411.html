<PRE>                            JINGLE ALL THE WAY
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1996 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sinbad, Rita Wilson and Phil Hartman.</P>
<P>Arnold Schwarzenegger's attempts at comedy have been pretty successful
with 'Twins' (1988) 'Kindergarten Cop' (1990) and 'Junior' (1994). 
'Junior' is certainly the least of these three films in the opinion of
this reviewer but Arnold has struck pure gold with 'Jingle All the Way.' 
This is an absolutely dizzying and rambunctious physical comedy which puts
Arnold in good standing with the genre of slapstick.  The big guy plays a
workaholic dad and husband who is always breaking promises he's made to
his young son and is now feeling the resentment not only from the boy but
from his wife.  To try and make up for things Arnie promises to get the
boy a Turbo Man action figure which is the hottest toy on the market.  The
only problem is that he procrastinates and on Christmas Eve day is forced
to rush all over town to find one which is practically impossible.  He is
in competition with Sinbad who is trying to find one for his own son and
Sinbad delivers some good physical comedy but lays on the laughs mostly
with his gift of gab.  Director Bryan Levant ('Beethoven') uses some very
unattractive characterizations which add an extra dose of laughing gas to
the formula of this already fast paced and loony looking farce which plays
like a cross between a comic book and Saturday morning cartoon with
delightful results.  Rita Wilson (Mrs. Tom Hanks) plays Arnold's wife and
Phil Hartman is Arnold's seemingly nice guy next door neighbor with a
hidden agenda for pursuing Schwarzenegger's wife in romantic fashion. 
>From devilish Santa Claus con men to a sadistic reindeer to a climax which
puts Arnold in Turbo Man's shoes, this is a sheer feel good and hilarious
film which had me laughing in all the right places and offers some
touching moments as well.  'Jingle All the Way' is the best escapist fare
Christmas film since 'Home Alone' and is far superior in every way.  This
movie's title doesn't only deliver but you will definitely find yourself
laughing all the way and if you don't then shame on you, Scrooge!</P>
