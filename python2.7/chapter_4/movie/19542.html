<P>        I was just on the Internet chatting with a friend of mine and fellow 
film critic Ian Waldron-Mantgani who's usually anxious to hear my verdict on 
most newly-released films since I get to see them before he does (he lives in 
England and most films don't open overseas until a few months after their 
American premiere). I told him `Eyes Wide Shut' is a lot like every other 
Stanley Kubrick film - weird. But when he asked me if it was `good weird' or 
`bad weird' I couldn't think of an honest answer, so I guess I would just 
have to say yes.
        How could a film that had undergone super-ultra-mega-secretive 
production for 18 months not have some kind of stigma attached to it? I, and 
the entire world for that matter, really didn't know what to expect from 
`Eyes Wide Shut.' All we'd been told officially is that it's a story of 
sexual jealously and obsession, but everyone (myself included) suspected it 
was going to be a twisted, surreal drama that would push sexuality in movies 
to another level (a la `Crash' or `The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her 
Lover' - two films which disgusted and offended me). 
        And now that the film is finally released as its auteur intended it 
to be (well... there is that controversy over 65 seconds of 
digitally-superimposed figures - more on this later), is the final product as 
extreme as the hype said or is it just the way Kubrick makes movies?
        Yes.
        It's hard to think of any other movie where I could tell you that 
probably everything you've heard about it is true and false at the same time. 
Yes, it is a surreal, sexual drama pushing the boundaries of mainstream 
movies. Yes, it does have outrageous sex scenes and innuendo. Yes, Cruise and 
Kidman endure a helluva lot to get through this picture. But it's not 
softcore porn for the masses and it really isn't that `sexy' per se. 
        Every Kubrick film is different from every other film in terms of 
genres and storylines, but the theme and mood to `Eyes Wide Shut' are in the 
same spirit of style of his complete filmography. It's weird, surreal, 
shocking, intriguing and bizarre - but it's up to the individual viewer to 
determine whether these elements work for them or not. The story is basically 
realistic and believable on some levels, but I don't think it expects us to 
believe it could take place in the reality we know (it better not).
        The first half of the film is told in classic Kubrick fashion - it 
slowly lays the foundation of the story and emphasizes the characteristics of 
the main players. It is also tricky in its delivery so that when the plot 
begins to boil, slowly at first but then very rapidly, we realize we've 
mistaken the obvious for the subtle and vice versa.
        We meet Dr. William Harford (Cruise) and his wife Alice (Kidman), an 
upscale Manhattan couple who may or may not be part of the higher social 
order among New York's wealthy and important people. They attend a huge party 
hosted by their friend Victor Ziegler (Pollack) and after separating we're 
led to believe they are either an unhappy couple or swingers. This scene is 
one of the most important parts of the film and also one of the strangest. 
Alice has a bit too much to drink and finds herself swept off her feet by an 
extremely dapper South American man who speaks in the kind of eloquent 
phrases you only hear in soap operas but with all the suaveness of James 
Bond. Meanwhile, William is charming two beautiful models  in the same 
overly-eloquent small talk which has kept his wife at bay. But just when you 
think you know where this is about to go a small emergency crops up and 
suddenly the tone is serious.
        The film then spends a long duration exploring the Harford's martial 
bliss and fidelity. They find themselves arguing over the other's actions at 
the party which then leads to even more exploration of their sexual 
curiosity. They do seem to be compatible and a few romance scenes back that 
up, but there seems to be something missing. During an argument Alice tells 
William, in explicit detail, about a fantasy she had about another man which 
she's convinced she could have followed through on and it would have been 
worth the repercussions at home.
        I'm not sure if married people ever have to deal with these kinds of 
problems, but the atmosphere here is so tight and so chiseled with the finest 
details that the drama definitely seems believable and goes a long way 
towards establishing William's character and what happens to him after the 
turning point in the story.
        And what that point is could be one of the strangest and most 
perverse in film history. Because William is so subconsciously outraged that 
his wife could possibly have such strong sexual desires he finds himself 
sucked into the New York underworld. First, he comes close to patronizing a 
prostitute and then visits his friend from medical school, Nick Nightingale 
(Field) who is now a piano player in a jazz bar, and amazingly (and 
coinincidentally) enough has connections to a secret society.
        This is the part `Eyes Wide Shut' will be remembered for. It involves 
a twisted, unsettling plot element which is also photographed in such a way 
to `set a new record' for a commercial motion picture. Considering that 
almost everything about the film has been about sex, sexuality and the 
various taboos associated with it, and the fact that Harford is about to 
crash a secret society's meeting, it's clear what's going to happen here. 
It's also wherein a controversy lies over the digital altering of 65 seconds 
of the film. Suffice to say that if you don't know what has been superimposed 
you probably won't be able to tell. 
        I really don't have a problem with this digital imagery, even if it 
was done against Kubrick's wishes (most say he would never approve of this 
form of censorship, but others argue he would have to get an R rating), what 
bothered me the most is just the idea of it all. The tone and the attitude of 
the society is scary because it seems to be a religion about sex, yet at the 
same time, once the ceremony is over it's not much different from a porno 
movie. Kubrick can be weird at times, but when he dabbles with sex it almost 
always comes off as gratuitous and completely unnecessary (one of the major 
reasons `A Clockwork Orange' falls short of true greatness). What's more, 
it's not what the society does that accounts for the turning point in the 
story, it's just their sheer existence. Since this is the case, why not stick 
with the secret religious cult aspect?
        From here the film takes a sharp turn towards a different mood, plot 
and storytelling form. It becomes an intense psychological thriller and an 
interesting mystery as Harford realizes he has been part of something so 
unbelievable he can't comprehend it and refuses to believe it. Especially 
after his life and safety and that of his family are threated by these 
strangers who somehow know everything about him. Like the viewer, he starts 
to look for logical answers but the more he uncovers the more paranoid he 
becomes. 
        The second half of the film is just the continuation of Kubrick's 
elaborate mind game. In some ways it's just as surreal and bizarre as all the 
sexuality explored during the first half. Not unlike `The Game' and `The 
Spanish Prisoner' we're suddenly feeling for a common man trying to figure 
out why the entire world suddenly seems against him and how he can fight them 
without much power of his own.
        Slowly the story begins to unwind and many answers are provided, but 
not all of them and especially not the most important ones. Is it because the 
screenplay is lacking? Possibly, but I'd suspect it's just Kubrick toying 
with us as he does so well.
        Aside from the direction and use of theme, many other aspects of 
`Eyes Wide Shut' deserve kudos: Cruise's performance which proves once and 
for all he's not just a pretty-boy (do I hear another Oscar nod?); the 
cinematography which manages to blast each frame full of glowing, rich light 
but simultaneously gives a sense of darkness, fear, and mystery; the 
outstanding set and production design which completely captures the essence 
of modern New York City (the film was not shot on location, everything was 
constructed on a sound stage!); along with some other subtlties such as its 
sense of humor, the score and soundtrack, etc.
        To answer Ian's question, I'd have to honestly say that `Eyes Wide 
Shut' is that the good weird parts outweigh the bad weird parts, but there's 
so much more that could have been done. Kubrick leaves us wanting more, but I 
have a feeling if we look at this hard enough we'll be content with what we 
have.</P>
