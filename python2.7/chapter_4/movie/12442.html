<PRE>**Speed 2**
Reviewed by Jeff Walters</PRE>
<P>Welcome to your oh-so typical sequel. It tries to be twice as big as
it's predecessor, yet ends up twice as shallow. </P>
<P>         Shallow....hmm...now there's an idea. Maybe if the ill-fated
cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things
may have turned out better. The first thing that struck me...and
surprised me, was that the camera work (for the opening sequence
anyway) was terrible. Looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept
tripping on their own feet......very different to the original movie.</P>
<P>         The characters? Well, not many of the characters actually
*had* characters, but here's a rundown. Annie, who was the highlight
of the the original, must have seriously banged her head in the train
crash at the end of the first movie. Why? Because something's got to
account for her losing that many IQ points. Even though Annie wasn't
exactly a rocket scientist in Speed, here  some of her actions just
make you want to beat your head against a wall. For instance, after
successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group
of people can escape noxious gases - she stands in the middle of the
opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the
people can't get ut till she get's the chainsaw out of their
faces....BANG BANG BANG <---- sound of head beating against wall.</P>
<P>     In point of fact Sandra's character is turned into little more
than one of those scantly dressed extras from Hercules, who constantly
has to be rescued.</P>
<P>     Jason Patric? All I can say is Bring Back Keanu. Keanu Reeves
might have the emotional range of a tree stump...but that's
one more tree stump than Jason has. I don't think he changed facial
expressions all movie - Jason, smile for the cameras!! Now
frown!...I said frown....oh...you are...BANG BANG BANG.. Wooden just
doesn't describe this guys performance, but it'll have
to do.</P>
<P>     The Bad Guy.....ahh...William Dafoe - there's a bright move. How
can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged
classic, Body of Evidence? (Yes, that is sarcasm). His wide eyed
maniac of a character doesn't start out too bad....but goes
steadily downhill as the movie progresses. In the end he degenerates
to chasing Annie around for a hostage, even though he
already has the money and can escape....BANG BANG.</P>
<P>     Though I'd like to give this movie a double thumbs down, there
were some nice sequences. Considering the movie cost
over 100 million dollars - you'd hope there'd be at least a couple.
The real eye-popper for me, even though it was given away in
the trailer....BANG BANG.....was the sequence where the Cruise Liner
sideswipes the oil tanker. This looks terrific and I was
very surprised to hear that the Cruise Liner in it was....completely
computer generated! Wow....I don't think I've ever seen a CG
model look so real before. The sequence where Jason Patric in trying
to disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific,
and the only time during the entire movie where you get that feeling
of....speed.</P>
<P>     This lack-of-speed problem affects many sequences. Such as the
oil tanker part.....it was - "Oh no, We're going to hit the
oil tanker!", 20 minutes later - "Oh no, We're going to hit the oil
tanker!" 20 min....you get the point. This movie failed simply
because it didn't live up to it's name....there was very little
feeling of speed. In the original movie, the lead characters had to
make split second decisions to survive.....in this movie it felt more
like - "Well people, we're gonna run into that there island in a few
hours - I think I might stroll over to Engineering and see if I can't
turn off the engines...I'm passing the cafeteria on the way, can I
get anybody anything?" </P>
<P>      The ending of this movie really is terrible. Even though it
features what I've since found out is one of the most expensive
sequences ever in a movie - it just doesn't work at all. The part
where the liner crashes through the town looks very realistic,
but....surprise surprise - it just takes waaaaay too long. It seemed
to go for 15 minutes before the ship finally stopped. One thing
that struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship
crashes through the harbour and town, around 25 people are
killed by the ship....and there's only 15 or so people left on the
ship. So when it stops safe and sound and the characters are all
cheering - the audience is sitting back and thinking - "wait a
sec...this is a happy moment because?" BANG BANG</P>
<P>     Then there was the dog.....I almost fell out of my seat when I
saw the bit with the dog dodging the falling debris. Putting a
dog in peril has become the ULTIMATE Hollywood cliche......every movie
seems to have a 'Dog-in-Danger' sequence - Volcano, Dante's Peak,
Independence Day, Daylight, Twister. Lost World......etc, etc.</P>
<P>     This movie is a perfect example of how NOT to make a sequel.
Director Jan De Bont should try watching the orignal
movie and this one back-to-back and see if he realises where he went
wrong.</P>
<PRE>1 1/2 stars out of 5</PRE>
