<PRE>                            DOUBLE JEOPARDY
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     DOUBLE JEOPARDY does not take place during the latter half of a
game show.  However, it has a similar amount of credibility.</P>
<P>     There's an old adage in screenwriting:  You can make something up,
and it doesn't have to *be* real.  It just has to be believable.  In
other words, you can make up the lines for a priest to read at a
wedding, as long as they sound plausible.  No one's going to know if you
miss a few `Amens.'  However, this liberty does not extend to making up
laws on which to base the premise of your film.</P>
<P>     DOUBLE JEOPARDY has the bizarre distinction of probably being the
first movie to completely rest its fortunes on the fact that you'll buy
make-believe legislation.  And if you believe the filmmakers, you simply
can't be tried for the same crime twice.  So if your husband (Greenwood)
fakes his death and frames you (Judd) for it, and then you get
convicted, and then six years later you stalk him down to kill him, then
you can't be found guilty of murder, because you were already tried (and
convicted) for that.</P>
<P>     Right?  Wrong.  Very wrong.  Wrong to the point that it's scary to
think that maybe the filmmakers maybe didn't realize it at any point
during the production.</P>
<P>     The plot of DOUBLE JEOPARDY is very plain and obvious (Tommy Lee
Jones chases vengeance-obsessed Judd for an hour while she tracks down
hubby, just like in THE FUGITIVE).  And while the thriller is pedestrian
and straightforward and otherwise dull, the theater erupts in laughter
every time that `double jeopardy' clause is trotted out.  You keep
expecting for *someone* on screen to explain to Judd how the law works,
but they never do, and Jones's character is an ex-law professor!</P>
<P>     Not that I should feel surprised.  Bruce Beresford hasn't made a
good movie since 1989 (DRIVING MISS DAISY).  While Jones is campy and
fun to watch, and I could be entertained watching Ashley Judd make toast
for two hours, the film does not redeem itself with these minimal,
guilty pleasures (see also: ENTRAPMENT).  This isn't Double Jeopardy.
It's a $100 warm-up question.</P>
