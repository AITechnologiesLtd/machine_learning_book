<P>Very Bad Things marks the new level in dark comedy, the twisted and bizarre
level in which nothing is sacred.  To hell with PC, to hell with morals and
decency and not witnessing gore: Very Bad Things shows everything.  That
said, don't see it on a full stomach.  That said, make it a point to see
Peter Berg's Very Bad Things next weekend.
Very Bad Things is the blackest black comedy since Curdled, and the most
intelligent since The Last Supper, and the most fun independent film to
watch since Reservoir Dogs.  The movie functions on three levels: one
sublimely funny as we watch the world go into complete chaos around five men
and their attempt to cover up the accidental death of a Las Vegas
prostitute, and the not-so-accidental death of a hotel security guard.  The
second level is a Hitchcock-level psychological thriller that tracks
everyone's descent into insanity as they all struggle to cover up the
murders.  Level three, ironically, is a moral message in the midst of this
immoral and psychotic world: all wrongdoers are punished for their sins.
The film follows five men (Christian Slater, Daniel Stern, Jon Favreau,
Jeremy Piven, and Leland Orser) on Jon Favreau's Vegas bachelor party.
Christian Slater, the ringleader of the group, hires a hooker for Jon
Favreau's last night of freedom and Jeremy Piven, whoops, kills her.  When a
hotel security guard comes up to investigate the noise, Christian Slater
kills him too.  They all agree to cover up the murders, bury the bodies in
the desert, and act like it never happened.  But, sadly, Daniel Stern has
one too many morals for that.
What follows is everyone's collapse into complete insanity as they try to
cover up the two murders, then try to cover up a third murder, then a
fourth, fifth, sixth … well, you get the point.
The actors do their finest in the serious parts of the movie.  Most notably
Daniel Stern, who has always shied from serious roles, adeptly handles the
only truly moral character in the movie.  Also (my personal favorite of the
movie), is Christian Slater, an anti-Semite psychotic who is so deeply
involved with self help that just isn't working.
The film's creativity is truly shown with it's ability to make anything
funny: cocaine, anti-Semitism, car crashes, murders, burial practices,
minivans, wives, kids, the handicapped, the paralyzed, telethons, oral sex,
and power tools, just to name a few.  There's nothing this film won't -- and
doesn't target.  And, friends, it hits the bullseye every time.
It's not a movie for the weak of heart, the weak of stomach, or the weak of
morals (don't get any ideas, folks), but it is the movie for anyone who
doesn't meet those criterion.  See it for the dark comedy, see it for the
thrills, see it for the morals.  By God, indulge yourself: see it for the
Very Bad Things.</P>
