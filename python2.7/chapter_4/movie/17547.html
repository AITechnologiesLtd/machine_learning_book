<PRE>                              TRUE CRIME
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: In a story that takes place almost
          entirely in one day a reporter covering a Death Row
          execution tries to prove the condemned man is
          innocent. Clint Eastwood stars, produces, and
          directs.  The mainline story is cliched melodrama,
          but the writing and especially the well-developed
          minor characters give the plot a royal treatment.
          Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Steve "Ev" Everett (Clint Eastwood) is a bad-boy reporter who
refuses to follow any rules.  Right now he is holding back on his
drinking, but he is smoking and, oh yes, sleeping with his editor's
wife.  This does not make for good relationships around the office, but
Ev carries on (in several different senses).  When a fellow reporter is
killed in a (gratuitously spectacular) car accident, Ev picks up her
responsibilities including the interviewing and writing a human
interest sidebar about Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington), a Death Row
inmate scheduled to be executed the next night at midnight.  But in
reviewing the trial from six years earlier Ev starts questioning
whether the story makes sense.  There appear to be problems in the
trial testimony.  But Ev now mistrusts his own once powerful talent to
"smell out" when there is something suspicious with a story.  And as he
traces the story he sabotages his own effectiveness by not following
anybody's rules but his own.</P>
<P>     Eastwood creates more believable characters for the minor roles
than the character he creates for himself.  But then going back to THE
OUTLAW JOSEY WALES he has frequently done the same thing.  Bernard Hill
plays the role of Luther Plunkett, the prison warden.  It would be
cliche to play him as officious and unfeeling.  Instead he turns out to
be a genuinely caring person.  On the other hand Isaiah Washington has
been getting some favorable press as the condemned Frank Beachum.  We
see a lot of him, but he plays the simon-pure innocent to the hilt.
Where an actor should have personality he has only virtue.  Though his
character was not always so, we see him he is the perfect husband and
father. The film intentionally contrasts his ultra-perfect family
values with those of Everett which have ripped apart Everett's family.
We feel for Beachum, but other than in his moments of greatest pain it
is more for his predicament than for his character.  His family is just
a little too wholesome.  James Woods plays Eastwood's boss at the
newspaper in a role only a little less slimy than his usual.  Woods is
one of the few actors who can steal attention away from Eastwood.
Other familiar actors include Anthony Zerbe and an almost
unrecognizable William Windom as a bartender.</P>
<P>     Clint Eastwood is really a very good director in a very controlled
film. However he has the same Achilles Heel that Woody Allen has.  He
has to paint himself as being the great lover.  His character seems to
be able to seduce any woman he wants.  The problem is that he is
getting on in years.  His youthful good looks have given way to an
older chiseled look.  Eastwood seems to be doing his locker room
bragging on the wide screen.  His even raspier voice is now a sort that
lost actors careers when sound came to films.  Perhaps Eastwood, the
gifted director, should consider if he needs a better star than
Eastwood, the actor.  On the other hand playing the character himself
thematically gives the film one big advantage.  Eastwood almost
invariably plays the outlaw.  He is Kurosawa's samurai Sanjuro, a law
unto himself, transplanted to America.  But in his younger spaghetti
Western and Dirty Harry days he has played that character as hero.  As
he has aged Eastwood has begun to look at that character more deeply
than Kurasawa ever did.  In UNFORGIVEN he began re-examining the hard
man who was this character he had created on the screen.  He began
questioning on film if the violence that was the former screen
persona's daily bread did not exact a toll.  Was the man with the big
gun not dehumanized and desensitized by carrying and using that weapon.
In TRUE CRIME Eastwood shows us how that character gets to middle age
and can no longer make his personal relationships work.  In this film
he clearly envies the man who, though once a criminal, has reformed and
built a strong family, even if that relationship turns out to be only
temporarily.</P>
<P>     Just as an aside, an interesting visual allusion is used.  When Ev
is interviewing Beachum, Eastwood has himself shot through the bars
recreating the poster from his ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ.  It is a reminder
of the days when Eastwood was building his reputation and his films
were just solid entertainment.  TRUE CRIME is certainly a good film,
but lacks the fun of his earlier work.  Still I would give it a 7 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
