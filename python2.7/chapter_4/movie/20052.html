<P>Who thought the revival of the horror genre laid within this relatively
small-budget slasher film released in 1996? Scream surprised audiences
upon it's release, because not only did it succeed in delivering the
chills, it also had a delightful self-mocking sense of humor. Unknown
scribe Kevin Williamson added a much-needed dash of humor and cleverness
to his screenplay, making Scream quite the hot ticket for young
audiences.</P>
<P>After the renowned popularity of Williamson's pet project, numerous
clones began production. But none captured the shining quality of the
original Scream (except, perhaps, Scream 2). So what's Williamson's
secret? It's actually fairly simple. He doesn't create clichéd
characters; he makes his characters aware. They've seen all the horror
movies and know all the trademarks of the genre, and when they're
unwillingly placed in a situation themselves, they know how to handle
themselves (or at least, to a certain point). Scream is not some kind of
miraculous breakthrough, but it is a breath of fresh air.</P>
<P>The story takes place in a small, US town populated with teenagers who
look strangely like twenty-something Hollywood actors. Neve Campbell is
Sidney Prescott, a likeable senior who has dealt with the death of her
mother in the past year. Skeet Ulrich is her boyfriend, Billy, an avid
movie buff who sneaks through Sidney's window every now and again. But
he is no match for the dedication of cinema applied by Randy Meeks
(Jamie Kennedy), an intelligent geek who works at the local video store.
Then there is Matthew Lillard as the intolerable, gloating jerk Stew and
his fashion-smart girlfriend Tatum (Rose McGowan).</P>
<P>When their little town of Woodsboro is overtaken by a horrific double
murder, everyone is on the look-out. The killer himself wears an attire
of a spooky Halloween costume, and is now often referred to as `ghost
face'. Williamson's clever script relies heavily on the unmasking of the
murderer, and the motive for his (or her) killings. But before you go
off guessing the killer's identity, there are more suspects to address.
Reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) is at the scene of the crime, and
she and Sidney have shared a complicated past. Then, of course, there's
the charming local deputy Dewey (David Arquette), a well-meaning doofus
and also Tatum's older brother.</P>
<P>The brisk comedic moments in Scream are often more refreshing than the
horror. The best scenes both involve Randy spilling all the details he's
learned from years of watching scary movies. The first takes place in
the video store, where he loses his composure and screams out
`Everybody's a suspect!!!', to the confusion of other customers. The
second (and best) occurs when he explains the rules of horror movies to
friends at a party (Williamson even capitalized on the greatness of this
particular scene, and revised it to an equally amusing effect in Scream
2). In case you've forgotten these rules, here they are:
1) You can never drink or do drugs.
2) You can never have sex.
3)You can never, ever, under any circumstances say `I'll be right back'.</P>
<P>The final bloodbath in Scream is where I started to lose some interest.
It's too excessive, gory and a little far-fetched. Campbell shows off
her strong lungs nicely, Cox is dynamite fun playing the insatiable
bitch who wants a top story, and Arquette does unexpected marvels with
his character, who is relatively low on brain cells but shyly attempts
to hide his inadequacies. For director Wes Craven, this was definitely a
wise career move. But, the real star is Kevin Williamson, who has
written a screenplay that has revitalized the horror genre. Even as his
characters make the same mistakes as regular fright film victims do,
they are doing so with a knowing awareness. This translates into a lot
of fun.</P>
