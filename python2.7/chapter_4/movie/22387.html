<P>`Man on the Moon' is a very entertaining documentation of the life of eccentric
comedian Andy Kaufman. Played with amazing accuracy by Jim Carrey, Kaufman is
portrayed as the man who broke all the rules to make people laugh, or in some
cases to make people extremely upset. In a series of hoaxes and controversies
concerning whether the audacious performances Kaufman put on were real or not,
we learn that Kaufman was a pure genius at what he did. The director, Milos
Forman, shows us that Kaufman's whole life was one big joke with twists at
every corner that left audiences surprised, embarrassed, and eventually wanting
more of him. We learn that Kaufman's ability to fool the public made him one of
the greatest entertainers in American history. Forman shows us act after act to
plaster this statement into our minds. What Forman does not inform the audience
is enough about Kaufman's life off of the camera or off the stage. There are a
few scenes examining his childhood and his later years in which he suffered
from cancer, but certainly not enough. The conclusion of  this film could be
the same from seeing a documentary on Kaufman. Both just focus on his
performances, the slight difference is that `Man on the Moon' has several shots
of the audience's reactions to Kaufman's shenanigans, from confusion to
drunkenness. This difference between the film and a documentary already made on
 Kaufman is very small and useless because it does not matter how the audience
reacts to it but rather how you, yourself, react to it emotionally. Another
problem with `Man on the Moon' is that it gives away too much information about
Kaufman's acts. Prior to this film, the acts had a perfectly ambiguous feel to
them because you never knew exactly what was going on or who was behind them.
This feel was mainly what makes Kaufman so amusing to watch and listen to. When
the film displays each act, later it inevitably discusses how they were done
and unfortunately takes a little away from the enjoyment of the actual Kaufman.
I do not know how Forman could have avoided explaining situations, so I am a
little confused about why this film was even made. Maybe because Kaufman's life
was a perfect formula for a Hollywood tale; he was funny, iconoclastic, and
died at an early age. But the film ruins some of Kaufman's mysteriousness and
it doesn't explain Kaufman's background, which is the only information not well
known by the older aged public.</P>
<P> Still `Man on the Moon' is entertaining nonetheless thanks to an incredible
performance by Jim Carrey who becomes Kaufman. His mannerisms and voices are so
incredible that it is obvious Carrey did a vast amount of research for his
role. This is by far Carrey's best role ever and with his previous film, `The
Truman Show,' Carrey is hushing critics who have once derided him. He is now
the master of dramatic comedies since Robin Williams has been lagging lately
with some unsatisfactory titles to his name. Another snub by the Academy Awards
against Carrey would be completely unacceptable. He should not only be
nominated but he should also win for best actor.</P>
<P> Jim Carrey is also helped  by some fine supporting actors in Paul Giamatti and
Danny Devito. Playing Bob Zmuda and George Shapiro respectively, they allow
Carrey to soar even more with some witty one-liners and some fine acting.
Courtney Love was unfortunately wasted in her role. It was simply too brief and
ineffective. It seemed like the movie would not have been any better or worse
without her. Also deserving credit are a number of actors playing themselves in
cameo roles. To see them as they did fifteen years ago was humorous, especially
a zany Christopher Lloyd doing his Taxi character with the hair and everything.</P>
<P> `Man on the Moon' is as entertaining as any movie this year. It is funny and
extremely accurate in its portrayal. It may be a great educational film for
younger generations not introduced to Andy Kaufman's strange world. They see
that this comedian was wilder and funnier than his time and maybe even the
present time. The world has yet to catch up to Kaufman's eccentricity. For
older generations however, the film presents nothing new. Kaufman's life
outside of the entertainment  industry is very brief. He was one of the great
introverts of entertainment and unfortunately remains one into the year 2000.</P>
