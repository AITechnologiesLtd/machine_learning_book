<PRE>                            SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     This is one of those reviews that's going to garner plenty of
nasty mail from disgruntled readers, but I feel it's my obligation to
let *you* know exactly what you're getting into with SOMETHING TO TALK
ABOUT.</P>
<P>     If you are a female, preferably married, preferably Southern,
preferably jilted by your husband, and preferably interested in horses,
you'll love this film.  If not, you're screwed.  SOMETHING TO TALK
ABOUT is the story of a married, Southern, jilted female, Grace (Julia
Roberts), who works for her father (Robert Duvall) at his
horse-breeding ranch.  When she finds husband Eddie (Dennis Quaid) with
another woman, she dumps him like week-old halibut and heads off into
the land of reckless self-indulgence, revenge, and wacky hijinks with
her dysfunctional family.</P>
<P>     Well, it ain't quite that simple.  I was expecting a romantic
comedy, judging from the marketing campaign.  Unfortunately, this is
*not* a humor-filled film.  It's a drama with some funny bits tacked
on.  Although Kyra Sedgwick (as Grace's sister Emma Rae) is the only
comic relief and a God-sent saving grace to the picture, SOMETHING TO
TALK ABOUT does exactly what its title says:  talk ... at length ...
for what feels like hours ... mainly about what scum the men in the
female characters' lives are.</P>
<P>     SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT soon becomes the movie that will not die,
which I started praying for after the first half hour.  Absolutely
nothing interesting happens to these characters.  They are almost
universally unlikable and underdeveloped--which is difficult to pull
off, considering the sheer mass of personal interactions in the
picture.  Everyone just moans a lot along the lines of "Whatever
happened to what we used to have?" and "How could you do this to me?"
The whole film comes off as a sad experiment in marketing--to see how
many women the movie could pack in the theater.  Sadly, it's a lot.
Let me tell you:  a knee to the crotch goes a long way for this crowd.</P>
<P>     And when it's finally over ... just when you think they aren't
going to slap on a Hollywood Ending and make a nice statement ...
*wrong!*  SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT sells out like tickets to a Streisand
concert.  I left the theater depressed.</P>
<P>     SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT is an especially painful letdown,
considering its cast and creators.  Director Lasse Hallstrom (MY LIFE
AS A DOG, WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE?) and screenwriter Callie Khouri
(THELMA AND LOUISE) have really taken a wrong turn here.  It looks like
everyone had the best of intentions, but the results were less than
stellar.</P>
<P>     Gentlemen reading these words, just remember to say this to your
girlfriend or wife after she drags you to the film:  "I thought it was
good!"  It'll be a lot less painful that way.  I promise.</P>
