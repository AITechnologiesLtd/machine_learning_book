<P>     Sally Potter's THE TANGO LESSON is a cold, antiseptic romance, a 
love story without a heart or soul.  Thanks to Robby Muller's striking 
black-and-white cinematography (occasionally interrupted by spectacular 
bursts of color), the movie looks great, but, on an emotional level, 
it's as stiff and unyielding as a slab of granite.  For a film that's 
supposed to be about one of the most passionate dances known to the 
world, THE TANGO LESSON comes across as flat and lifeless.  </P>
<P>     Watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of other recent 
pictures that use pairs dancing (as opposed to the FLASHDANCE variety) 
as an integral aspect of the story.  The first, STRICTLY BALLROOM, is a 
glib parody of the romantic comedy/sports genre, and the second, SHALL 
WE DANCE?, isn't a conventional romance at all, but an examination of 
the path to personal freedom.  And, while it's unfair to compare the 
intentions or plot of THE TANGO LESSON to those of either film, it's 
worth noting the differences in the way the dance numbers are presented.  
In both STRICTLY BALLROOM and SHALL WE DANCE?, they are genuine 
celebrations of life -- energetic, vibrant, and engaging.  In THE TANGO 
LESSON, they're nicely-choreographed, but cool and clinical.  Only one 
dance sequence (a number near the end, featuring four participants) 
works on a level other than the intellectual one.</P>
<P>     Potter's story, although rather thin for a 100-minute motion 
picture, contains some clever elements.  It's a fiction based on fact 
that uses real people, real locations, and real situations to spin off a 
narrative.  Sally Potter appears as herself, an independent director 
trying to decide on her next project during a trip to Paris.  While 
there, she sees an on-stage tango performance by the legendary 
Argentinean dancer, Pablo Veron (playing himself) and his partner.  
Inspired, Potter asks Veron for a lesson, and, when he learns that she's 
in the movie business, he agrees.  Over the next several months, as 
their lessons continue, they become romantically linked.  Then comes the 
deal:  Potter will put Veron in her next movie if he makes her into a 
dancer.  The apparent result of this pact, a canny mix of fact and 
fiction, is THE TANGO LESSON -- a film about tango that features Veron.</P>
<P>     One of Potter's most egregious errors is casting herself as the 
lead.  This is her acting debut, and it shows -- not only is she 
ineffective, but she has no screen presence whatsoever.  I'm sure that 
taking the top role in THE TANGO LESSON appealed to her vanity, but it's 
a huge misstep.  Behind the camera, with features such as the art-house 
hit, ORLANDO, the British film maker is a creative force; in front of 
it, she leaves little impression.  Pablo Veron, her co-star (also making 
his feature debut) is more lively but not more accomplished.</P>
<P>     THE TANGO LESSON is at its best not when the characters are 
dancing, but when it's exploring the creative process.  The last half 
hour, as Potter endures the difficulty of bringing her new film to life, 
is intriguing for the insight it offers into the difficulties of 
producing art, especially when it involves collaboration.  Some of the 
most inspired scenes are throw-aways, such as Potter's poolside meeting 
with a group of Hollywood executives who are debating whether or not to 
fund her latest project.  Sadly, there's not enough of that material to 
sustain the film, and sitting through the entire running length can, at 
times, be tedious.  THE TANGO LESSON doesn't make you want to get up and 
dance; it makes you want to go to sleep.</P>
