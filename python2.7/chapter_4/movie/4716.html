<PRE>                         ANATOMY OF A MURDER (1959)
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>ANATOMY OF A MURDER (1959) Directed by Otto Preminger. Written 
by Wendell Mayes from a novel by Judge John D. Voelker 
(writing under the nom de plume Robert Traver). </P>
<P>Still one of the best courtroom dramas made. Ben Gazzara 
(perhaps the ideal screen hypocrite) here in his second film, 
is an Army lieutenant accused of killing a barman, the 
presumed rapist (throughout,this, as well as the rape, remain 
presumptions) of provocative wife, (Lee Remick in her third 
movie role). He is defended by small-town lawyer James 
Stewart, prosecuted by nasty, big-city George C. Scott. </P>
<P>Preminger filmed in a real Michigan locale, with clever long 
takes. Clever too is the casting, as the judge, of Boston 
lawyer Joseph N. Welch, the avuncular hero of the 
McCarthy-Army hearings ("Have you no shame, Senator?") that 
had brought about the downfall of the dangerous and paranoid 
Senator from Wisconsin.</P>
<P>The "Anatomy" in question is less that of the trial--which 
remains ambiguous to the end -- than of the American judicial 
system, so that there are in-references, often humorous. Among 
them, a drunken lawyer (Stewart's assistant) is named Parnell, 
which sounds much like  a reference to J. Parnell Thomas who 
was, in a sense, McCarthy's predecessor as chairman of the 
House Un-American Committee of The Hollywood Ten notoriety -- 
and who later landed in prison for financial malfeasance.</P>
<P>The film was a sensation in its day, for its unprecedented 
discussion of sexual matters, rape and a pair of panties. Its 
performances are excellent as well as precise, down to minor 
figures. Note, for example, that of a hostile barman. </P>
<P>Preminger treats his movie with almost glacial objectivity. 
The visuals are realistic, the photography by Sam Leavitt is 
in creamy black and white with a full scale of shadings. </P>
<P>The movie made a star of Lee Remick after Lana Turner had 
declined the role. "Anatomy of A Murder" received eight 
Academy Award nominations: for Picture, Actor (Stewart), 
Supporting Actor (Arthur O'Connell and George C. Scott), 
Writing, Cinematography, Editing (Louis R. Loeffler).   </P>
<P>Though it won no Oscars, it was a major hit and high up on 
many Best Movie of the Year lists. The New York Film Critics 
gave it their Best Screenplay prize; the Venice Film Festival 
named James Stewart Best Actor.  </P>
<P>Aside from it other virtues, including a fine Duke Ellington 
score (Ellington has a walk-on role too),the film is something 
of a landmark in the undoing of Hollywood self-censorship. 
Otto Preminger had already breached its prudishness in 1952 
with the comedy "The Moon Is Blue," in which the female lead 
Maggie McNamara used then-taboo language (as when she asked 
William Holden :" Are you trying to seduce me?") or other 
no-no words like "virgin." It may seem ludicrous, in our 
current over-the-top times, that such matters created a furore 
then, but such are the facts.</P>
<P>Then, in 1955, Preminger's "The Man With the Golden Arm," 
about a drug-addict  (Frank Sinatra), heightened the 
controversy. As this was followed in 1959 by "Anatomy of a 
Murder," one might say that those three Preminger movies, 
albeit entirely different,were a kind of Code-breaking 
trilogy. </P>
<P>"Anatomy" runs 161 minutes, Seeing it on tape or on a cable 
premium channel without commercials is by far the best way. </P>
