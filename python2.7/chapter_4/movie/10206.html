<P>        Life is absolutely perfect for Nick Beame, he loves his wife,
he loves his job, he's well off. Nothing could be better, then he
comes home to find his wife in bed with someone. Next thing he notices
are his boss' cufflinks. Putting two and two together he assumes the
worst. Now if his troubles weren't bad, he gets mugged, well not
really mugged.. this is where the fun begins. The would-be mugger is
taken for a joy ride along with the audience. 
        This movie turned out to be surprisingly funny. I knew, I was
going into a comedy from the moment the ticket was purchased.  But I
was not expecting any intelligent conversation, not to mock either Mr.
Lawrence or Mr. Robbins I just wasn't expecting something this
amusing. Needless to say this is actually a funny comedy the plot is
fairly believable, there is little blood spilt, and unless my memory
has decided to fail me there was no explosions. It was refreshing to
see a movie come out of Hollywood that relied on the acting of its
cast to produce the desired effect as opposed to relying on special
effects like Jurasic Park 2 was inevitably forced to do. Tim Robbins
puts in a good performance as Nick Beame, and Martin Lawrence Tee(AKA
Terrence) also puts in a respectable and witty performance. 
        The actual storyline of the movie is believable although not
something likely happen, it is possible and that is what lends this
movie credibility.  Remarkably the movie shows us the two contrasts in
our lives the poor and the fairly well off as they truly are, Humans
above all else.  Although this movie is no revelation it did bring up
the point that people have a hard time getting jobs and in many cases
its not due to their skills but due to other factors such as sex or
skin color. It  pokes some fun at life, at the same time showing that
something's in life are brutally hard to cope with. This movie is a
movie that lets your take a break relax, kick back, have some fun and
get away from it for about 2 hours. What you get from it is time well
spent and in most cases a smile on your face.</P>
