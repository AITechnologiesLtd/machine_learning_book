<PRE>ROMANCING THE STONE (1984)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Same as the westerns in early 1990s, adventure movies -
another classic genre forgotten in modern times - made short
Hollywood comeback ten years earlier. Series of high budget
adventure films made in early and mid 1980s were, however,
less inspired by nostalgic feelings of Hollywood executives
- the real impulse was given by the success of first two
films of Spielberg's Indiana Jones trilogy. Not
surprisingly, the efforts to mimic Spielberg and his formula
usually backfired. The only successful attempt was made by
Spielberg's disciple Robert Zemeckis in his 1984 adventure
comedy ROMANCING THE STONE - great commercial hit that
managed to spawn a sequel two years later.</P>
<P>The heroine of the film is Joan Wilder (played by Kathleen
Turner), writer of trashy romantic novels, whose
professional success makes great contrast to the utter lack
of romance in her private life. Everything changes when she
receives mysterious package from her sister Elaine (played
by Mary Ellen Trainor) who lives in Colombia. The package
includes the treasure map and this is reason why Elaine gets
kidnapped by American gangster Ira (played by Zack Norman).
Since the gangsters demand the map in exchange for Elaine's
freedom, Joan travels to Colombia where she gets greeted by
Zolo (played by Andreas Katsulas), nasty local character who
wants the map for himself. She intentionally misdirects Joan
to take the wrong bus and travel to jungle where he would
easily take the map out of hands of helpless American woman.
His plan is foiled by the arrival of Jack Colton (played by
Michael Douglas), American bird hunter who saves her from
Zolo and reluctantly agrees to escort her back to
civilisation. Soon it turns out that the unforgiving climate
and wild animals aren't the only obstacles on their way -
they are pursued by Ira's cousin Ralph (played by Danny de
Vito), and Zolo reveals himself as the deputy commander of
Colombian secret police. During the journey, Jack and Joan
decide to take the treasure for themselves, and Joan slowly
realises that Jack is the exactly the hero she was
describing in her books.</P>
<P>We might get impression that the time has done great
disservice to ROMANCING THE STONE. Decade and half after the
premiere, the film looks terribly dated, but the problem was
already there in 1984 - while Indiana Jones movies had
period settings and therefore kept their timeless quality to
this day, ROMANCING THE STONE somehow failed to bring the
spirit of classic adventure films like THE AFRICAN QUEEN to
1980s setting (partially due to Alan Silvestri's score that
sounds unmistakably 1980s and thus disrupts the illusion)
and, as a result, the film looked anachronistic from the
beginning. Thankfully, the scriptwriter Diane Thomas (who
tragically died a year after the production of the film) was
aware of concept's limitations and filled it with the right
combination of action, romance and comedy. Some characters
and situations are extremely funny or interesting, while
other look lame. For example, character played by Danny de
Vito, which is supposed to work as "comic relief" is
actually irritating for the most of time (Alfons Arau as
drug dealer and Holland Taylor as Joan's editor are more
effective in that area), and the film might work very well
without him. Same goes for Zack Norman as his partner, while
Andreas Katsulas manages to transcend one- dimensionality of
his villain character with enough dosage of creepyness.
However, the best assets of the film are the two main
actors. Kathleen Turner was incredible in this film - she is
equally believable in the role of mousy romance novelist as
she was in the role of manipulative seductress in BODY HEAT.
She also has a great chemistry with Michael Douglas, whose
role of classic adventure hero is so different from the
roles he had played in late 1980s and 1990s. Zemeckis'
direction is more than fine, although some scenes seem
heavily influenced by Spielberg, and the pace of the film is
satisfactory. The end result of his efforts is slightly
flawed and somewhat old-fashioned film that nevertheless
kept enough of its entertainment value to be recommended as
fine example of 1980s Hollywood's craftsmanship.</P>
