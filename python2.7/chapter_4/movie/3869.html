<PRE>                                   THE NET
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     This just goes to show that not only can Sandra Bullock not act,
but she can't even pick decent projects, either.  Sucked from the
Hollywood buzzword list like a bottom-feeder looking for sludge, THE
NET is trite idiocy that is socially irresponsible and irredeemable.  I
puked out loud.</P>
<P>     I honestly can't believe a movie like this was made.  Basically,
it's the story of Angela Bennett (Bullock), a superstar computer hacker
who runs across something she isn't supposed to, then finds her
identity erased, her friends killed, and herself hunted down.
Obviously a rush job to beat the other impending computer movies to the
market, THE NET is one plot hole after another, with technological
impossibilities filling the space between.</P>
<P>     If you think for one second that Sandra Bullock is believable as a
systems analyst who hasn't left her house in four years, you probably
aren't mentally capable of reading this review.  I mean, she's got an
awfully nice body for someone who sits on her butt 24 hours a day.</P>
<P>     The story and acting are pathetic, the only exception being
comedian Dennis Miller, whose five minutes of screen time are more like
a welcome intermission than a part of the film.  Unfortunately, it's
much too little, too late.  THE NET is simply horrible in every
way--the writing isn't clever, the jokes are unilaterally flat, the
sound effects are silly (a wooden *carousel* horse actually brays) and
the "romance" scenes are funny because they're so pitiful.  Director
Irwin Winkler (NIGHT AND THE CITY, 1992) isn't exactly on a winning
streak here, either.  As Miller's character puts it in the film, "I'm
not buyin' the whole package."</P>
<P>     The sad thing is that a movie vaguely similar to THE NET was made
rather well in 1992 as SNEAKERS.  Unfortunately, the producers of this
film decided to make a "serious picture" about the dangers of a fully
computerized society, ripping off the message of SNEAKERS, but
forgetting to satirize it like that film did.  I pray that no one takes
this movie as a serious warning.  The last thing we need in this
country are more paranoid technophobes.</P>
