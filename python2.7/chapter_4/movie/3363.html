<P>     LOSING ISAIAH tries very hard to make its viewers cry--and
succeeds.  But the chance to shed a few tears is not all this
thought-provoking and dramatically-solid motion picture offers.  An
emotionally charged issue is handled with balance and care.  Excepting
circumstances, there are no villains here, and the case for each side
is presented in a compelling manner.</P>
<P>     The issue in question is whether a black crack child, abandoned by
a drug-addicted mother shortly after birth, is better off with that
now- reformed woman or with the white adopted family with whom he has
spent the first four years of his life.  Everyone loves little Isaiah
(Marc John Jefferies):  his birth-mother, Khaila (Halle Berry); his
white parents, Margaret and Charlie (Jessica Lange and David
Strathairn); and his adopted sister, Hannah (Daisy Eagan).  But love
often leads to pain, as becomes evident when Khaila goes to an activist
lawyer (Samuel L.  Jackson) to seek custody of her son.</P>
<P>     In LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD, Ken Loach took aim at the British social
work system and fired with both barrels.  LOSING ISAIAH, while dealing
with some of the same themes, approaches things from a vastly different
angle.  Here, both sides are treated equitably--for the drama to work,
this is a necessity.  Director Stephen Gyllenhaal manages to present
the two perspectives without displaying obvious favoritism for either.
Khaila starts out as crack addict, but we are shown her recovery and
reform and, through her interaction with the children she babysits, are
led to believe that she has become a fit parent.  On the other hand,
Margaret and Charlie have given Isaiah a stable, loving home in which
he is happy.  But they are not of his race and are not teaching him
about his culture or background.</P>
<P>     Much of LOSING ISAIAH is wrenching, and all of it is well-acted.
Here, Jessica Lange gives the kind of performance for which an Oscar
nomination is deserving (unlike her over-the-top caricature in BLUE
SKY).  Halle Berry is equally moving in a role that requires more
range.  Lange needs only to play the devastated mother; Berry must do
double-duty as an addict and a woman trying to regain her son.  David
Strathairn and Samuel L. Jackson, two actors who almost always impress,
are solid in less- visible parts.  Newcomer Marc John Jefferies is
amazingly believable and shows none of the awkwardness that often
accompanies the debut of a child actor.</P>
<P>     The end of LOSING ISAIAH is something of a cheat, but the eventual
resolution is neither badly handled nor overly-melodramatic.  However,
it isn't the final five minutes that display this movie's
strength--it's the other one-hundred.  Numerous scenes stand out, but
there is one image -- Jackson and Lange standing side-by-side under an
overhang during a rainstorm--that summarizes everything about this
film.  Brief in duration but undeniable in impact, that moment has
everything:  pain, uncertainty, and the unbridgeable gulf existing
between the issue--"black babies belong with black mothers"--and the
real people involved.  There is virtually no dialogue; it isn't
needed.  It's instances like this, which are scattered throughout, that
give depth and poignancy to a story that daringly probes a volatile
question for which there are no straightforward answers.</P>
