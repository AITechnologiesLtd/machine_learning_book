<P>     LEGENDS OF THE FALL is the sort of epic melodrama that only 
Hollywood can do this well.  It's a spectacle more than a show, with 
soaring moments of triumph and tragedy.  Words like "restraint" and 
"subtle" are meaningless in this context.  The latest offering from 
Edward Zwick, the director of GLORY, is the kind of movie that doesn't 
require much effort to surrender to and enjoy. </P>
<P>     At the center of Susan Shilliday and Bill Wittliff's script are the 
three Ludlow brothers:  Alfred (Aidan Quinn), the oldest and most 
straightlaced; Tristan (Brad Pitt), the middle child with a special 
affinity for nature; and Samuel (Henry Thomas), the youngest and most 
idealistic.  The family's patriarch is Col. Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins), an 
officer who left the U.S. army when he disagreed with the treatment of 
the Indians.  The four men, along with an assortment of friends, live in 
the Montana Rockies, away from the trappings--if not the presence--of 
civilization.   </P>
<P>     It would be difficult to find any more affectionate and caring 
brothers than Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel--until one woman turns all 
three lives upside down.  Hailing from Boston, Susannah (Julia Ormond) is 
engaged to Samuel.  However, the impending marriage can't prevent both of 
his brothers from falling for her, and she for at least one of them.   </P>
<P>     America's entrance into World War One--and the consequential 
bloody price--concludes the introductory portion of the film and 
unwraps the real meat of the drama.  Beyond this point, tangled passions 
rise in a tide of betrayal and jealousy.  Few crimes, whether of the 
heart or the body, are left unavenged.  There are deaths--some expected 
and some sudden--and births.  Lost opportunities give rise to mournful 
reflections on what might have been.  And, at the end of it all, exists 
one final catharsis. </P>
<P>     There is nothing deep about LEGENDS OF THE FALL.  Its few themes 
(such as the innate corruption of government) are kept in the background, 
giving prominence to characterization and storyline.  Needless to say, 
this is an extravagant production, with sumptuous visuals (credit 
cinematographer John Toll) and a rich score (by James Horner).  In look 
and feel, it is much like DANCES WITH WOLVES and THE LAST OF THE 
MOHICANS.   </P>
<P>     Brad Pitt, a modern-day James Dean, brings a wealth of melancholy to 
his role of Tristan, the fulcrum for at least three of the film's major 
tragedies.  The character's comings and goings represent the openings and 
closings of chapters.  Even when Tristan isn't on screen, the movie is 
invariably about him.  It takes little guessing to realize that his love 
affair with Susannah is central to everything that transpires. </P>
<P>     Supporting Pitt is a fine cast, including Anthony Hopkins, Aidan 
Quinn, and newcomer Julia Ormond, whose role here offers a taste of 
things to come (she's in a lot of upcoming films, including a remake of 
SABRINA and the latest Camelot retelling with Sean Connery and Richard 
Gere).  However, all of these actors, regardless of how respected, must 
(and do) surrender center stage to Pitt when he's on hand.  The spotlight 
is his. </P>
<P>     Manipulation is a part of any melodrama, and LEGENDS OF THE FALL is 
no exception.  In this case, however, the entertainment offered far 
outweighs any momentary recognition that the director is tweaking our 
emotions.  A film maker who can pull this off once--not to mention 
twice (here, as in GLORY)--deserves both respect and admiration. </P>
<P>     It seems that there are perennial attempts at this sort of grand-
scale motion picture, each with ambitions as big as the mountains that 
form the backdrop.  Because it's so easy to overdo melodrama, successes 
are rare.  Thankfully, there are few missteps in LEGENDS OF THE FALL.  
You don't have to be a critic, or even have a critical perspective, to be 
entertained by this film. </P>
