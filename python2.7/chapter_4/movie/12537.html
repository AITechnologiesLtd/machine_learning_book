<P>   Hal Hartley exhibits interests in "Henry Fool" that he
featured in his offbeat premiere movie, "The Unbelievable
Truth."  Combining melodrama with irony, Hartley's first movie
dealt with a mysterious man in black, often confused for a
priest, who called himself a garage mechanic and who
provoked discussion about his background all over town. 
Hartley now continues to explore the odd situation that occurs
within ordinary workaday lives with his current film--having
taken a wrong turn in his career three years ago with "Flirt," a
three-part tale telling the same dull story in three dull, similar
ways. Fortunately, "Henry Fool" is considerably more
entertaining and even accessible: almost.</P>
<P>   More theatrical than cinematic, "Henry Fool" is an ambitious
work, an attempt to pinpoint the American identity at this point
by use of a fable.  Hartley is influenced by sources as
distinguished as "Faust" and "Kaspar Hauser," and what's
more his latest work conjures up giants of the theater like
Harold Pinter and David Mamet as readily as Simon, a
nerdish and terminally shy garbage man, conjures up a
modern Mephistopheles.  While some viewers may have
reservations about its length, Hartley's subject matter and
imaginative treatment of several important themes justify the
time spent.  Surely, if "Godzilla" can hold its targeted
audience for over two hours, "Henry Fool" should have no
trouble doing the same for an intelligent constituency.</P>
<P>   Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan) is a charismatic personality
who appears in most scenes and serves as mysterious
mentor to a spiritually defeated trash man, Simon Grim
(James Urbaniak).  He shows up one day to rent a basement
space in the Grim household in much that a bum receives
shelter in an abandoned house in Harold Pinter's "The
Caretaker."  Both Pinter's and Hartley's creations are
frighteningly mysterious, making us curious about their
backgrounds and exerting a strong effect on those
who become parts of their circles.  Henry Fool immediately
senses his host Simon's lack of self-worth, though Simon is
a responsible person who takes care of two dependents: a
clinically depressed mother (Maria Porter) and a
nymphomaniac sister Fay (Parker Posey).  Despite his scruffy
appearance, Simon's new friend Henry speaks in a literary
style with a well-modulated voice, tells Simon that he is
completing a magnum opus called "Confessions," and
prompts Simon to get off his knees and begin writing.  No
sooner does Simon begin scribbling poetry furiously in a
notebook than Henry notices that his new pupil is spouting
iambic pentameter.  When Simon's poetry begins to find an
audience, Simon is reviled by some as a pornographer while
praised by others as a literary sage.  Henry urges Simon to
gain experience to bring further depth to the writing, but
Simon is already knee-deep in life, observing his promiscuous
sister's goings-on, his despondent mother's cynical
pronouncements, and his abusive neighbor's violence.  As
Henry's background is revealed, the movie loses some of its
edge.  As the enigma of the mysterious guest is bared, the
second half of the story waxes conventional.</P>
<P>   Like Jeremy Pikser and Warren Beatty's character
Bulworth, Hartley uses his people to satirize the family values
excesses that periodically threaten to take control of
America's political process.  Warren (Kevin Corrigan), who
regularly abuses his wife and stepdaughter, campaigns for a
reactionary Congressional candidate who uses his outward
decency to cloak his anti-immigrant views.  "Henry Fool,"
though, is not primarily a political tract but in the first instance
a fable that proves that we can reinvent ourselves while it
secondarily takes jabs at anti-progressive statesmen and the
culture of conformity.  Henry is a most likable villain, even
after we learn of his crime, a chain-smoking, serious man
given sympathetic depth by Canadian actor Thomas Jay Ryan
in his debut performance in a feature movie.  Long-haired,
bearded, and scruffy throughout, Ryan's Henry is a complex
individual whose psyche is carefully unravelled, fully exhibiting
his humanity as well as his flaws, while Hartley does likewise
for side characters like Father Hawkes (Nicholas Hope), a
doubter who advises Simon on financial dealings and the
ways of the world.  Parker Posey is striking as always, this
time in the role of a hard-assed, unhappy, unemployed but
attractive and chic siren who lives a love-hate relationship
with the title character.  James Urbaniak is just fine as a
nerdy trash man turned minstrel under the influenced of a
shady friend whose own background is irrelevant to his sway
over the young man.
   "Henry Fool" should be used by the dean of every liberal
arts college in America to show that there is far more to life
than being successful in a trade or profession.  The movie
lobbies for the potency of words, the ability of the rich, English
language to give life meaning even to the humblest of people
who subject themselves to its magic. Rated R.  Running time:
138 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
