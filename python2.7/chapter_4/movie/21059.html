<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>I admit it.  I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie.  A
snappy pothead comedy laced with dick and shit jokes.  Well, it turned
out to be not so snappy and, would you believe, not one mention of dicks
or shit.  What a disappointment.</P>
<P>This is the first pot movie since the heyday of Cheech & Chong and,
sadly, left me yearning for the days of Nice Dreams.  Half Baked tries
to double the fun with four stoners instead of the conventional two.
There's Thurgood Jenkins (Chappelle), a janitor at Frankensence & Burr
Laboratories, who narrates the story.  There's Brian (Breur) a burnt
record store employee and Scarface (Diaz), who works in a burger joint.
And don't forget Kenny (Williams), the sensitive kindergarten teacher.</P>
<P>After work each day, they meet at Jenkins house and light up Billy Bong
Thornton and then fight over which toker is on `munchie' patrol.  On
this fateful evening, Kenny goes out for the snack foods and happens
upon a police horse named Buttercup.  Kenny feeds the horse all of the
junk food and is horrified to see the horse drop dead.  Apparently,
Buttercup was diabetic and Kenny is arrested for killing an officer in
the line of duty.  The bail is set at $1,000,000 and, thus, the plot
comes to life: Sell enough pot to free Kenny!</P>
<P>Somehow, Jenkins has access to an unlimited supply of pharmaceutical
marijuana at work and the four hit the streets to raise Kenny's bail.
Of course, a film like this wouldn't be complete with out the following
stock characters: the love interest (named Mary Jane and played by
Rachel True), the rival drug lord (Clarence Williams III) and the
strange guy who's been asleep on the couch for years (Steven Wright).
OK, maybe that last one wasn't standard fare.  There were also a few bad
cameos (Snoop Doggy Dogg, Janeane Garofalo & John Stewart) and a few
good ones (Bob Saget, Willie Nelson & Tommy Chong). `David', the guy who
got thrown out of house on the second season of MTV's `The Real World'
also makes an appearance, but who cares?</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong, there were some very funny scenes.  There is a high
point when Thurgood takes Mary Jane on a date with only $8 in his
pocket.  As the date progresses,  a counter on the bottom of the screen
shows how much he has left.  Kenny's tearful avoidance of painful jail
ass sex is also amusing.  Hey, ass sex is almost like a dick and/or shit
joke, isn't it?</P>
<P>I expected better from this group of people.  Director Tamra Davis
worked on the hilarious Billy Madison and CB4.  Maybe it was the script,
which was co-written by Chappelle (The Nutty Professor).  In addition to
Jenkins, he also played rap star Sir Smoke A Lot.</P>
<P>Granted, this probably would have been a lot better if I burnt a big
fatty before it started and I'm sure that's what the target audience of
this film will probably do.  Maybe the theaters should hand weed out to
the patrons as they file into the theater.</P>
