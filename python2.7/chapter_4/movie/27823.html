<P>Behind his battered but professional  movie camera, Joe Morelli 
instructs his subjects: "Right profile. Left profile. Center 
profile." Center profile indeed! It makes as much sense as the 
streams of rural Sicilians who pose for what has been sold to them as 
a "screen test."</P>
<P>You know right away that they are all the victims of a fraud.  In 
postwar Sicily,  scam artist Joe covers villages and small towns. The 
phony talent scout arrives in a truck covered with Hollywood posters, 
its loudpseaker blaring come-ons. He sets up his equipment in a large 
tent, dazzles people with name-dropping ("great actors I have 
discovered") and especially with the astronomical earning of stars. 
He then offers to shoot screen tests that will be examined by a big 
film studio in Rome. " I promise nothing" says "Doctor" Morelli, but 
that won't kill any dreams.</P>
<P>He adds that a small service fee will be charged - 1,500 lire, which 
was about a dollar, not a trivial sum for impoverished Sicily around 
1950.</P>
<P>Naivete, ignorance, hopelessness propel the locals into Joe's tent, 
but there are as many diverse reasons as there are faces among the 
wannabees. And voices. Joe records them on what must have been the 
last of the wire-recorders. (Its high fidelity is astounding). He has 
them learn a sentence or two from "Gone With the Wind," which adds to 
the ludicrousness and comedy of the situation, one made even more 
enjoyable for those who know Italian and are aware of Sicilian 
speech. (When Joe thinks that the local cop is on to him, he is 
relieved to find out that the man just wants his own test, to recite 
The Divine Comedy" which he had translated into Sicilian).</P>
<P>Sicilan-born Giuseppe Tornatore's second big screen feature (he came 
from photography and then TV), was the splendid, Oscar-winning 
"Cinema Paradiso." It was a hard act to follow, but the next movie, 
the entirely different "Everybody's Fine," was a very good picaresque 
road film about a Sicilian widower. Tornatore then did an excellent 
episode in an omnibus film. Then, the 1994 "A Pure Formality" broke 
with the writer-director's Sicilianness, was an ambitious, 
semi-Kafkaesque failure. With "The Star Maker" Tornatore follows the 
hard act of "Cinema Paradiso" with  confidence and ease.  Not with a 
sequel but by working the downside of the movies'magic.</P>
<P>The film's early section is one of light irony and mockery. Yet in a 
tour-de-force that is not at all obvious, Tornatore's sensitive 
script and Castellitto's layered acting never allow condescension 
toward the subjects. Joe may be fleecing his customers, Joe sometimes 
mutters " Animals, dumb beasts, rednecks!" but at the same time he 
has soft spots and a  comprehension of the underprivileged. There's a 
duality here. Joe shoots his footage on outdated film, yet on the job 
he seems to have an odd sort of professional conscience.</P>
<P>Gradually, the film gets more serious as it goes from the amusing to 
the satirical to the pathetic. Joe is perceived as influential in the 
film trade. A penniless mother offers him her body, hoping to promote 
her daughter.  A man in a Mussolini hat, delivers a Duce-style 
harangue.  An aged veteran who never spoke after his return from  the 
Spanish Civil War,   suddenly finds his speech before the camera, 
and, in Spanish, speaks insultingly of Franco, lyrically of his 
"Fifth Regiment."</P>
<P>He is touching. Pathetic too is the gay hairdresser who states that 
all others, including bandits and women (sic) now have rights, but 
not the gays. Eventually though, this moment with Joe, this 
confession to the camera, result in courage and optimism, change the 
man's life for the better. Later too, Joe is reproached for hearing 
more confessions than any priest. But, like a priest,  he does nor 
intrude on privacy -- and some confessions may have a salutary effect.</P>
<P>The encounters are not mechanically plotted. Tornatore can go from a 
sad moment to an outlandish scene, as when, in an episode worthy of 
The Book of Chutzpahs,  bandits who rob Joe end up by paying him for 
screen tests. Or as when Joe must take pictures of a 
never-photographed, now dead, Mafia Don. The sendup of Mafiosi is a 
gem.</P>
<P>Pathos arrives again on the scene in the shapely form of Beata, 
convent-born and bred, age 15 or 18 (she doesn't know),a cleaning 
woman for many, including an older man who gives her the 1,500 lire 
for a screen test, in exchange of Beata giving him a look at her 
naked body. Joe, moved by her simplicity, shoots additional footage 
of her, as though -- in another key to the movie -- he himself took 
his scam for a reality. In intriguing ways, Beata now becomes, off 
and on,  part of Joe's life.</P>
<P>More travels through Sicily show the land's uniqueness and beauty, 
never postcardish,   never artsy,  but as glimpses on what is part of 
the action.</P>
<P>Joe's manipulation of his customers is a scaled down version of 
politics and exploitation.
He gives a ride to an educated doctor who tells him of a  whore who 
cheats villagers, as all others do, from the government to the local 
authorities. "We don't want those who sell dreams, like you, to take 
advantage of us." There's always a bigger fish that swallows the next 
size down. Soon, Joe himself uis victimized.</P>
<P>"The Star Maker," has superior photography  (especially in the tricky 
tent shots) and one of those scores in Italian movies that cleverly 
use American pop songs, "Stardust" in this case. Subtler, much less 
sentimental, nostalgic or audience-manipulating than "Cinema 
Paradiso," the new film will, for those reasons, not attain the 
earlier movie's popularity. A pity, since it speaks volumes on a 
specific society and its culture.</P>
<P>In a sense Joe's travels are like Gulliver's (but among the gullible) 
and even closer to the classic 1941 film "Sullivan's Travels"  which 
concluded  that the more miserable people are, the more they need to 
escape into fantasy. Like Joe's clients who have stars in their eyes 
and get their little moments of dreaming movie dreams.</P>
