<P>  South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Written 
by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Directed by Parker.</P>
<P> They will tell you it's only a cartoon. Wrong.  It is more  much more. 
It is an adult R-rated animated feature.</P>
<P> This 80-minute movie also is offensive, raw, uncouth, profane, raunchy, 
raucous, satiric and hilarious.</P>
<P> Going way beyond the restrictive bounds of television  even for cable's 
Comedy Central  South Park is a savage riff on parents, mores, morals, 
war, jingoism and patriotism.</P>
<P> Canadians, especially, will probably want to picket this movie.</P>
<P> Transferred from the small screen is that cute, crude group of kids, led 
by Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny.</P>
<P> The amazing aspect about the movie version of South Park is that Trey 
Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the series and writers of the 
film, have created a mirthful musical.</P>
<P> The movie contains about a dozen musical numbers, most of which spoof 
various musical movie and stage presentations.</P>
<P> The storyline is basic. The youngsters sneak into an R-rated movie 
starring their favorite performers, the potty-mouthed Canadians Terrence 
and Phillip. The profane-ridden movie influences the third-graders and 
the entire child population of South Park as the kids, after seeing the 
movie, develop mouths that constantly need to be washed out with soap.</P>
<P> Stan's mother goes on the warpath, and it leads to the arrest of the 
Canadian performers on The Conan O'Brien Show.  (Conan is so distraught 
about his part in their capture that he commits suicide by jumping out 
the window of his NBC studio.)</P>
<P> Things escalate. Poor Kenny is again killed, and he is sent to hell. 
There, he uncovers a plot by Satan and his new lover, Saddam Hussein, to 
take over the world after the execution of Terrence and Phillip.</P>
<P> The Canadian air force retaliates by bombing the Baldwin mansion, 
killing the entire acting clan.</P>
<P> OK, even writing this sounds surreal. So let's wrap it up by saying 
Parker and Stone set out to offend and shock as many people as they can. 
That they succeed in doing.</P>
<P> It is in-your-face comedy and satire. This is a movie that will have no 
middle ground. People will either see it more than once or walk out 
before the finale.</P>
<P> No nation, religious group or ethnic group is spared Parker and Stone's 
barbs.</P>
<P> The movie is tasteless, but it is done in such an artful way that all 
you can do is applaud the audacity of Parker and Stone. </P>
<P> South Park is an original, the funniest film of the year.</P>
