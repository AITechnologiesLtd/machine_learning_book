<PRE>                         THE GATE OF HEAVENLY PEACE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>              "On the night of June third of 1989, tanks
         and armored vehicles of The People's Liberation
         Army moved into Beijing and put an end to seven
         weeks of peaceful protest."</PRE>
<PRE>                           -The Narrator (Deborah Amos)</PRE>
<P>     The eye opening documentary THE GATE OF HEAVENLY PEACE by
directors Richard Gordon and Carma Hinton has the now famous 1989
Tiananmen Square tragedy as its central theme, but actually the movie
paints evil across a much wider canvas covering the entire Communist
Chinese era.  Even if you naively believe that you have kept up with
twentieth century Chinese history, I suspect that watching this movie
you will be like me and find yourself learning one fascinating incident
after another so that you soon lose count.  Let me skip to the
recommendation of this review and say that this is one of those films
that not only will people enjoy, but everyone should see it.  When it
comes to your area, it will probably pass through like a freight train
and then disappear into the night.  Keep an eye out for it.</P>
<P>     The movie starts with the now famous scene of the unknown student
blocking an entire line of tanks with merely his body.  This film is
about courage, not cowboy style bravado, but strong, dedicated and
steadfast determination to insist on democracy and nothing less than
democracy.  The documentary has a linear structure with flashbacks used
to put events in the proper historical perspective.</P>
<P>     The student protest movement is shown to have been a long Chinese
tradition until Mao came into power.  The old newsreel and other film
footage are mesmerizing.  You can see how natural student protest used
to be, plus you see the reverential way students viewed Mao when he
first came to power.  The irony is that in 1989 students gathered in
Tiananmen Square around a monument built by the Communists themselves
to celebrate a 1919 student protest at that very spot.</P>
<P>     Mao liked a society in constant turmoil declaring, "Chaos can't
harm us; it can only harm our enemies."  He kept the students churned
up against the bureaucrats which solidified Mao's position as the one
supreme power.  He expected students to stay dogmatically Communist.</P>
<P>     The film makes liberal but effect use of talking heads.  The
directors managed to locate a dozen or so of the key instigators of the
Chinese Democracy movement, and each of them prove both articulate and
thought-provoking.  You get to know these people and thereby empathize
with their plight.  Wu Guoguang, a former government official, tells us
that, "The only option for a pure idealist is to commit suicide."  He
rejected that approach and so worked his way into the government in
order to change it from within.  When China opened up to the West, its
leaders were hypocrites, explains the narrator (Deborah Amos).  "To get
rich is glorious said the leaders," but she said only the leaders got
rich.</P>
<P>     The whole Tiananmen Square episode is shown to be a tragedy of
Shakespearean proportions.  The students firmly, but humbly took their
requests to discuss with the leaders of the government, but even
kneeling in front of their doors did not help.  As student Chai Ling
put it, "When we saw our classmates there holding our petition with
raised arms, everyone cried."</P>
<P>     Not only was protest acceptable from an historical perspective, it
was also legal since their constitution specifically gives people the
right of freedom of speech.  The government, on the other hand, was
able to sentence people to seventeen years in prison if they did not
like what was being said, ipso facto it was therefore
counter-revolutionary and hence criminal.  As Wang Dan, who served
almost 5 years in prison for these thought crimes put it, "The crime of
counter-revolution is very unusual.  What is being punished is not your
actions but your intentions."</P>
<P>     This is reminiscent of the PC (politically correct) movement in
American Universities today where students possess complete freedom to
say whatever they like unless some group finds it offensive.  Students
speaking thus can be dealt with harshly and even expelled.  Thought
crimes are dangerous things and can not be tolerated as Winston Smith
learned in NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR.</P>
<P>     The People's Liberation Army was idealized and idolized by the
people.  The government churned out movies, ballets, and many other
propaganda devices to make this so.  THE GATE OF HEAVENLY PEACE shows
many of them.  The students believed that The People's Liberation Army
truly was their army, so when the tanks rolled and the bullets were
fired directly into the harmless crowds, the students were nonplused.</P>
<P>     Actually, many students were beginning to have doubts long before
1989.  As famous pop singer Hou Dejian put it, "Patriotism and
Collectivism are used to make the majority serve the few," and they had
stopped believing.</P>
<P>     I am not going to tell any more of what happens since the film
works as a mystery as well as a documentary.  I confidently predict you
will be constantly surprised.</P>
<P>     To make the film more accessible, it has no subtitles.  The people
start speaking in Chinese, and then their voices get lower and the
interviewer (Carma Hinton) begins to tell us in English what her
interviewee is saying.  The narration, based on the script by Geremie
Barme and John Crowley, is effective and moving without ever being
manipulative.  They use the story and the interviews to drive the
energy of the picture.  The careful and seamless editing by David
Carnochan and Charles Phied Churchill is beautifully done.</P>
<P>     THE GATE OF HEAVENLY PEACE runs 3:00, and as great as it is, it
would have been better and more focused at about a half hour less.
Movies must be careful when they approach the three hour mark.  Better
for the show to be widely seen by large numbers of people who know
little of the incident than be longer and end up only increasing the
knowledge of the already knowledgeable on the subject.  The film is
unrated, but would probably be PG-13.  Although there are some violent
scenes, I am strongly recommending the film to anyone old enough to
care at all about the subject.  Finally, I give it *** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
