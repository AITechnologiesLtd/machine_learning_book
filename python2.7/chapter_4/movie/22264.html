<P>It is a sin to waste one's talent.  And it is a sad pity to sit by and
watch someone else do it.  THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY tells a sad tale of a
capable but unhappy and deeply troubled young man who desires a life other
than the one he has been given.</P>
<P>Matt Damon (DOGMA) plays the sociopathic pianist/bathroom attendant Tom
Ripley who is quick to confess that his primary talent is in mimicry.
Mistaken for a Princeton graduate, he is hired by a frustrated father to
fly to Italy and convince his wayward son (and fellow Princetonian)  to
return to the United States.</P>
<P>Recognizing a good deal when one falls in his lap, Tom readily agrees.
Even before setting foot on Italian soil, he is already introducing
himself as Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law, EXISTENZ), the young playboy he was
sent to retrieve.  One taste of Dickie's lifestyle is enough to convince
Tom that this life is infinitely better than the one he left behind.
Little did he realize at the time the trap he was setting for himself.</P>
<P>After ingratiating himself to Dickie and his girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth
Paltrow, A PERFECT MURDER), Tom becomes inseparable from them.  Figuring
it is better to be "a fake somebody than a real nobody," he successfully
reinvents himself to fit in with the "manor born" crowd.  When Dickie
eventually tires of his continual company, it is no surprise to find that
Tom is not so agreeable to leave.</P>
<P>Upon Dickie's demise, Tom decides to adopt his identity and stay in
Italy.  This will present a bit of a problem as many already know him as
Tom Ripley and many know what Dickie Greenleaf really looks like.  Thus
begins a series of duplicitous hoops through which Tom must jump just to
keep his lies believable and his crimes undiscovered.</P>
<P>THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is more a character study than a genuine
thriller.  Mr. Damon does a fine (even if somewhat unnerving) job in
portraying a man with severe psychological problems.  Quick-witted and
even tempered, Tom's surface demeanor belies the turmoil and conflicts
raging within his heart.</P>
<P>Jude Law is well cast as a privileged rich child who completely and
totally disrespects the very source of his privilege.  Spoiled beyond
words, his character, Dickie, uses people as others might use old
newspaper. And yet his charismatic personality attracts people to him as
effortlessly as a light captures a moth's attention (oftentimes with the
same disastrous results).</P>
<P>  Both Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett (PUSHING TIN) lend their
considerable talents to the film but play relatively insubstantial
characters, serving as pawns in the misguided Ripley's mental chess game.</P>
<P>Writer/director Anthony Minghella (THE ENGLISH PATIENT) working from
Patricia Highsmith's 1955 novel, has set the film in the late fifties, a
dynamic time in Italy's history.  While focusing on the novel's concept of
changing one's life by stealing the more desirable life of another, he has
made a number of textual modifications to the original tale.</P>
<P>An added plot device which, for me, neither enhanced nor contributed to
the appreciation of the source material was the introduction of homosexual
elements.  Subtly introduced a quarter of the way into the film, the
homosexuality of certain central characters eventually  becomes a
dominant, driving force in the film's story.  It was not needed and served
to weaken the overall impact of this psychological study.</P>
<P>Ripley is a tragic figure.  He is made tragic by his inability to
recognize his own self worth.  Whenever we envy the life of another, we
fail to be thankful for all we already have.  Envy leads to discontent
which opens the mind's door for all kinds of devilish thought and action.</P>
<P>"For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil
work." James 3:16 [KJV]</P>
<P>When we live with the awareness that God is our sufficiency and that we
are uniquely created in Him, we are able to appreciate the lives of others
without being desirous of the lives they lead.  God would have you be
thankful for your own life.  After all... He is.</P>
