<PRE>DIAMOND MEN
A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Last year, Ned Beatty was given tribute by writer-director Tom Gilroy in
Spring Forward, inhabiting a beautifully written role as a weathered
park ranger.  Another true actor's actor, Robert Forster, is given his
full measure as aging diamond salesman Eddie Miller in Diamond Men. 
Forster, best known to younger audiences as laconic bail bondsman Max
Cherry in Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown, has quite a history behind
him.  His underappreciated body of work includes a hardcore television
journalist in Haskell Wexler's masterpiece, Medium Cool (1969), and his
debut as a quiet soldier who becomes the object of Marlon Brando's
desire in John Huston's complex Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967).</P>
<P>With Diamond Men, Forster effortlessly becomes one with his
surroundings.  Carrying a "live line" of diamonds (in a black briefcase)
on the road as he travels from one small-town business to another in
rural Pennsylvania, he's familiar with dingy coffee shops and cheap,
out-of-the-way motels, comfortable with the interior of his Lincoln Town
Car and his predetermined routine.  He's an older man with a heart
condition, 30 years peddling his wares, but Forster doesn't choose to
arouse pathos in this tightly wound curmudgeon.  Eddie's personality is
best described as an undisclosed poker hand: quiet, inconspicuous,
intense.  With his tough, wrinkled face and world-weary disposition,
Forster creates one of his most memorable characterizations and
writer-director Daniel M. Cohen wisely uses him to carry the movie. 
He's in almost every scene, and Diamond Men is graced by that weighty
presence.  (The other main character is Eddie's world of highways and
hotel rooms, photographed with unobtrusive sensitivity by John Huneck.)</P>
<P>Cohen finds an understated, assured tone of realism right from the
opening scene, where Forster collapses in a parking lot.  Eddie's a
professional who handles his work with the ease drawn from years of
experience, but after his recent heart problems he's no longer
considered "insurable" to carry a million-dollar line of jewels unless
he brings along his hotheaded young replacement, Bobby Walker (former
New Kid on the Block Donnie Wahlberg, a fine actor).  How is Eddie
supposed to train this kid?  Bobby can barely sit still for a minute,
rattles off at the mouth with a stream of obnoxious anecdotes recounting
sexual conquests, and is evidently more interested in getting laid than
studying the art of Eddie's trade.</P>
<P>Things don't look so good for this particular odd couple.  It's one of
those convenient pairings of opposites that defines so many movies. 
Diamond Men depends on strong performances and assured writing to pull
it off.  As a writer, Cohen brings firsthand experience of the diamond
business, emerging from three generations of roadside salesmen.  He
makes astute use of locations, particularly the seedy backwoods massage
parlor known as the Altoona Riding Club, where frumpy masseuses are
known to dole out special favors for the right price.  Bobby is able to
drag his new pal Eddie to this borderline house of ill-repute after some
tentative bonding, where the older salesman's self-imposed walls are
gradually broken down, opening him up to new experiences he'd never
dreamed of.  The scenes at this makeshift brothel feel emotionally
honest, both in Eddie's embarrassed resignation to undressing and the
women's unfocused, workaday attitude to strange men from The Road.</P>
<P>There's a threat of danger from some young hoods that catch wise to
Eddie's live load of diamonds.  It's a plot point that has destroyed
other independent films: L.I.E. suffers from a climax of violence after
developing an unforced, discreet relationship between the child molester
and his young prey; Ulee's Gold loses interest in developing Peter
Fonda's rich beekeeper characterization by tossing in a clumsy robbery. 
Diamond Men almost falls into the same trap, touching on this pedestrian
subplot and almost running off the rails with the threat of violence. 
Cohen thankfully doesn't stray too far from his character-driven story,
using the robbery device to unfurl his true climax, one that tests the
values Eddie Miller has stood behind for years.  Less Quentin Tarantino
than Arthur Miller, Eddie is asked to face up to his own life, something
that might never have happened if fast-talking Bobby hadn't drawn him
out of his shell.  The potential robbery doesn't figure in as the
climax; Diamond Men has larger, more personalized issues at stake.  The
finale proves as elusive as it is satisfactory.</P>
<P>Like Spring Forward, Daniel M. Cohen has created what might be
considered a "small" movie about everyday characters taking cautious
steps toward (or away from) wisdom.  It's lightweight, if the discovery
of friendship can be considered "lightweight," but there's a place for
movies that exist in much the same manner as the quaint corner store in
an emerging (or dying) town.  You'd rather go there than the shopping
mall, if only for the character and personality.  Diamond Men is small,
but certainly assured.</P>
