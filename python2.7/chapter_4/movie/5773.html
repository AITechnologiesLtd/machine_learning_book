<PRE>                            PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM

<P>        I never thought I'd see Woody Allen imitating Humphrey 
Bogart, and doing such a bad job to boot. But that's the premise of 
PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM -- that Woody Allen can't pick up girls with 
the flowery CASABLANCA dialogue or even act tough when he 
wants to. This is the guy who says he's been beaten up by Quakers 
and this time two bikers who pick up one of his failed dates. Most of 
PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM focuses on Woody's quest for love, going out 
on one disastrous blind date after another, little realizing the woman 
he really wants is his best friend's wife (Diane Keaton).</P>
<P>        Woody is helped along in his journey by the ghost of 
Bogart, who pops up every once in awhile to give him advice on 
masculinity, which none of us would argue he needs. But obviously, 
the charm of Woody Allen has always been his "loser" alter ego who 
ponders endlessly the value of sex, death and God while trying to 
gain and hold onto a meaningful relationship with the opposite sex. 
PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM is hardly a deep comedy like CRIMES AND 
MISDEMEANORS, though, with much of it playing like a sitcom 
from heaven, especially the extended blind date scene in Woody's 
apartment that has him going painfully out of his way to impress 
his date while Keaton and her husband (Tony Roberts) look on in 
a mixture of sympathy and disgust.</P>
<P>        This film is a fun mix of comedy and romance while still 
not being overly optimistic like MIGHTY APHRODITE. The ending 
parallels the "If you don't get on that plane, you'll regret it; maybe 
not today, maybe not tomorrow but soon -- and for the rest of your 
life" finale of CASABLANCA but isn't just a ripoff of that movie. 
PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM offers beginning and ending bookends of 
homage to CASABLANCA as tribute (and of course the Bogart's 
ghost device) but is 100% Allen, even if it wasn't directed by him. 
Though Woody scripted (from his Broadway play) and starred in 
it, Herbert "Steel Magnolias" Ross did the directing honors.</P>
