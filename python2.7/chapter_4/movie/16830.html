<PRE>Little Voice</PRE>
<P>Jane Horrocks, relatively unknown in the United States, has an
incredible talent.  She can mimic any number of famous vocalists-- Judy
Holiday, Ethel Murman, Marilyn Monroe--and she sounds exactly like them.
This one ups the talents of former HBO regular Rich Little; when she
sings, we have to pinch ourselves in recognizing that she doesn't just
mimic those famous voices, but sings with an extraordinary range,
remarkably on pitch.</P>
<P>It is a talent that prompted her friend to write a stage show, and now a
screenplay, just to show off her talents.  The story is how an extremely
timid person living under her mother's floozy shadow, is discovered.
It's rags to riches, a star is born, and then some.</P>
<P>I must emphasize, with a gloomy forboding,  "... and then some."  Start
trembling.</P>
<P>What's heartbreaking about a film like this is what the filmmakers, over
the guise of what can only be assumed as artistic "originality", did.
There are about ten minutes in this film where Horrocks takes the stage
with a confidence that matches the best performers.  To fully feel the
impact of this is to suffer, mildly, through the story, her overly shy
demeanor, her overly abrasive mother, the grating accents, and the
oddballs of a supporting cast that are given little to do except flaunt
their eccentricies, as if that would compensate for charm.  Only one
scene beforehand generated big laughs, but it's very clear that
particular scene was tagged on at the last minute, if anything as a
showcase for Brenda Blethyn.</P>
<P>But when that climactic scene arrives, its impact is so strong that it
qualifies as a genuine movie _moment_.  Had the film ended at that
moment, I would have liked it, and would have heartily recommended it.
It is that scene where Horrocks finally breaks through, and, with full
band, a full awe-struck screen-audience, delivers the goods.  It+s
magical.</P>
<P>Do yourself a favor.  If you see this film, once you come up to this
point, LEAVE.  Afterwards, a series of events occur of such a moronic
nature that it overshadows every bit of pleasure I had attained from
that one phenomenal, pivotal climactic scene.</P>
<P>I will not give away the truly awful ending, but I can+t help but
comment on the filmmakers+ apparently schitzophrenic intentions.  In one
minute, the filmmakers dictate: "isn't Jane Horrocks a wondrous talent!"
The next minute, the filmmakers slap our faces, as if we should be
guilt-ridden in enjoying her gift, as if we were the ones exploiting
her.   But then the credits come, finally, and then back to the
accolades; "Jane Horrocks used her own voice!"  Why bother trumpetting
the miracle, if we can+t fully enjoy it on its own merits?</P>
<P>Granted, this is different from a typical, feel-good "Star is Born"
vehicle.  It attempts to be original.  Believe me, I enjoyed it far
better the first time I saw it... the Warner Brothers+ cartoon starring
Michigan J. Frog.</P>
