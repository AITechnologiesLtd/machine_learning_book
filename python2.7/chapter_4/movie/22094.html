<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>`Have you ever confused a dream with life?' asks Susanna Kaysen in the
opening line of Girl, Interrupted.  It's tough to say whether she asks
this question before or after her recuperative stint in the nuthouse.</P>
<P>Winona Ryder (Celebrity), who also executive-produced the film, stars as
Susanna, a suburban, chain-smoking writer-wannabe that almost kills
herself by chasing a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka shortly
after her high school graduation in 1967.  She is sent to Claymoore, a
mental institution for young women, after one brief meeting with a
psychiatrist friend of her father's.  Since she is over eighteen,
Susanna must voluntarily check herself into the home, despite not
believing that she has any actual mental problems.  We learn later that
her diagnosis is Borderline Personality Disorder, an ailment with
generic symptoms that basically means that a person is lazy and
self-indulgent.</P>
<P>After taking a tour of the facility with Nurse Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg,
How Stella Got Her Groove Back), Susanna begins to unpack but is
sidetracked by the arrival of recent escapee Lisa (Angelina Jolie, The
Bone Collector), a willowy, whacked-out, alpha-female sociopath that
manipulates the other girls in Claymoore.  Within moments of her
entrance, Lisa does enough screaming to land Jolie her first Oscar
nomination.  She oozes crazy like she oozed sex in Pushing Tin.  She's
criminally insane, yet also an intelligent, self-absorbed button-pusher
that doesn't feel crazy as long as she is able to maintain control over
a situation.  Apparently, this could get you locked up in the ‘60s, but
this describes more than half of the people that I've ever known.</P>
<P>Susanna and Lisa hit it off almost immediately, the latter goading the
former into not taking medication and rallying against the
establishment.  She's the devil on Susanna's shoulder – Tyler Durden to
Susanna's Jack.  They dream of escaping from Claymoore and getting jobs
at the new DisneyWorld in Florida but settle for breaking into Dr.
Melvin's (Jeffrey Tambor, Teaching Mrs. Tingle) office and reading their
clinical diagnoses with fellow nutcases played by Clea DuVall (The
Astronaut's Wife), Brittany Murphy (Drop Dead Gorgeous) and Elizabeth
Moss (the First Daughter on The West Wing).</P>
<P>Ryder is decent enough as Susanna, but how long is she going to continue
to play teenage roles?  She even keeps a journal here like she did in
Heathers.  One of the problems that I had with the film is that at the
beginning, Susanna seemed to dwell on flashbacks of integral moments of
her life.  The flashbacks stop almost as soon as she hits Claymoore.
Does that mean she's cured?  I dunno.  Does it mean she was never
crazy?  I dunno that either.  Susanna never seems to make any real
progress until she meets with Claymoore's head head-shrink, played well
by Vanessa Redgrave (Mrs. Dalloway).  The hapless Jared Leto (Fight
Club) also has a small part as Susanna's draft-dodging boyfriend.</P>
<P>Based on a book by the real Susanna Kaysen, Girl, Interrupted is
directed by James Mangold (Copland), who adapted the script with debut
screenwriters Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan.  Some of Mangold's
flashbacks early in the film were done pretty well, but, like I said,
they stopped pretty quickly.  Like any film set in that era, the use of
music is of particular importance and Mangold doesn't shortchange us
here, using gem after gem – from Simon and Garfunkel's `Bookends' at the
opening to Petula Clark's `Downtown' during the closing credits.</P>
<P>2:05 - R for strong language and content relating to drugs, sexuality
and suicide</P>
