<PRE>            Review: Virus (1999) -- By Robert B. Marks</PRE>
<P>     Virus is a movie with a great deal of potential.  The idea
of an alien being, composed entirely of energy, coming to Earth
is one which could be developed in any number of interesting and
intelligent ways.  Unfortunately, in this movie, it isn't.</P>
<P>     What could have been an interesting piece of science-fiction
quickly becomes sci-fi (the SF writer's word for "crap").  When
the alien life form beams itself into the computer of a Russian
research vessel in an odd electrical storm (somehow managing not
to short out the computer in the process), it immediately begins
to build robots and tries to take over the ship, killing the
crew.</P>
<P>     And then the crew of a small tugboat, commanded by a wooden
Donald Sutherland (who looks almost embarrassed at his role),
finds and decides to salvage the deserted Russian ship.  Ignoring
the obvious signs that something is wrong (such as bullet holes
and blood splattered all over the place), they restore the power
and are soon set upon by the evil intelligence which sees mankind
as a virus to be removed; an idea obviously used only to provide
an excuse for it to want to kill people.</P>
<P>     What follows is a very poor impression of _Star Trek: First
Contact_.  Supposedly horrific cyborgs stalk the crew, wanting to
turn them into spare parts.  And, just to show off the FX, each
new monstrosity is revealed before it actually begins to do
something even remotely frightening, destroying what little
suspense remains.</P>
<P>     The movie, like most Hollywood sci-fi horror flicks, is also
filled with stupid characters.  Donald Sutherland's Captain
Everton manages to ignore every single rational idea available,
and comes off looking like an idiot.  Crew members routinely
disobey simple instructions, resulting in several entirely
predictable results.  And, to make matters worse, there is not a
single two dimensional character present, much less a three
dimensional one.</P>
<P>     In the end, _Virus_ is an uninspired waste of money and
time.  While it is slightly amusing in some places, for the most
part it is predictable and almost boring.  It is one of those
movies that is best watched as a TV rental.</P>
<P>     So, the final score: 1.5/5.  Sometimes amusing, but not even
worth a half-price show.</P>

And I am but a lonely wanderer, / With time as my only home.
