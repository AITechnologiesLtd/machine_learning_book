<PRE>DEEP IMPACT
Review by David Wilcock (C)1998</PRE>
<P>(DREAMWORKS SKG)
RUNNING TIME: 2 HOURS
STARRING ROBERT DUVALL, TEA LEONI AND ELIJAH WOOD
DIRECTED BY MIMI LEDER
The first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year (the second is the
macho Armageddon) is actually a dull affair. Elijah Wood plays Leo
Biederman, who during Astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is
heading for earth. Tea Leoni plays a (rather crap) news reporter, Jenny
Lerner, who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded
and boring way, and Robert Duvall plays the leader of a space crew, Spurgeon
Tanner, who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of Earth. Also
featuring is Morgan Freeman as the President, and Maximilian Schell and
Vanessa Redgrave as Jenny's father and mother.
While many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects
fest with the asteroid blowing everything up (as the trailers seem to
promise), the film is actually more of a character study, if a very poor
one.</P>
<P>The main problem is that there are too many characters in the film, and not
enough time to explore them all. Only the space crew are given any depth,
Jenny Lerner, Leo and the president are surprisingly 2D, and we never get to
know these characters. And because I couldn't care for them, I didn't really
give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not. The script by Bruce Joel
Rubin and Michael Tolkin is horribly simple, and never really makes any
interesting statements.</P>
<P>Mimi Leder, the former ER director and director of the average The
Peacemaker (1996), again directs in a ho-hum style, and never really gets
any emotion out of a scene, which is a shame. The cast are seemingly on
autopilot, although Tea Leoni does gives a rather good performance, even if
she acts a bit too dorky for her own good. She seems uncommonly stupid for a
journalist. Robert Duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role, he just
seems to be in this film for the money. Elijah Wood, one of the best child
actors working today, is surprisingly average, although his choice of roles
lately haven't exactly been brilliant (i.e. Flipper, 1996). His role is also
vastly underwritten.  Morgan Freeman, again, is utterly wasted with a
ridiculously underwritten role. Like Duvall, he just seems to be in the film
for the money. The supporting cast are all O.K, none making much of an
impression.</P>
<P>OK, so Deep Impact may have messed up character wise, but surely the special
effects are good? Well, yes and no. Although the special effects should be
impressive, with a massive tidal wave destroying New York, the special
effects look like, well, special effects. Sadly, the waves looks like it's
been drawn on computer, and doesn't look too good at all. Surprising really,
when the effects are done by Industrial Light & Magic, who did the effects
for The Lost World and Twister.</P>
<P>In the end, Deep Impact is a wasted opportunity. What could of been a moving
movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and
effects. The 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater
effect. Once again, Dreamworks has churned out another average movie. Let's
hope Armageddon is a bit better.
OVERALL RATING= ** OUT OF  *****
