<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>In a way, I have a lot in common with Charlie Baileygates. I consider 
myself, all things considered, a nice guy. I'm polite. I do favors 
without expectation of reward. I could count on one hand the number of 
times in the past five years that I've gotten really, blood-boiling, 
vein-in-the-neck-throbbing angry. Sometimes, I'm probably a bit of a 
pushover. I've often wondered what would happen if, one day, I just... 
snapped. The new comedy "Me, Myself & Irene" is devilishly entertaining 
wish fulfillment.</P>
<P>Charlie, played by Jim Carrey, is a Rhode Island state trooper. The film 
opens with a flashback to eighteen years ago, when Charlie married his 
sweetheart Layla (Traylor Howard). On their wedding day, Charlie became 
involved in an inadvertent fracas with Shonte (Tony Cox), a black midget 
limo driver who, like Layla, was a card-carrying Mensa member. Soon, 
Layla and Shonte were having an affair, and nine months later she gave 
birth to triplets: three African-American baby boys. Outwardly oblivious, 
Charlie raised the kids as his own (despite the fact that one is actually 
named Shonte Jr!).</P>
<P>Fast forward to the present. Charlie is rearing the boys by himself, 
Layla having run off with Shonte years earlier. His "sons" (Anthony 
Anderson, Mongo Brownlee, and Jerod Mixon) have grown into brilliant but 
foul-mouthed prodigies -- witness their hilarious, profanity-laden 
quantum mechanics study session. But gullible Charlie has become the 
state joke, and one day all his pent-up rage externalises itself... as a 
split personality, Hank, a gruff-talking, aggressive, no-nonsense jerk.</P>
<P>There's more to the plot than this, of course, as Charlie/Hank becomes 
involved with Irene (Renee Zellweger), who is being hunted by corrupt New 
Jersey cops because of her involvement with a crooked golf course owner. 
Or something. Frankly, the specifics of this whole storyline are made 
murkily clear at best, and really don't matter anyway. The point is just 
to keep Charlie/Hank and Irene together for an extended period of time, 
and embroil them in a series of wacky encounters.</P>
<P>"Me, Myself & Irene" is a funny movie, but it is in many ways a victim of 
its own publicity campaign. So much of the set-up has been revealed in 
trailers and in print that a lot of the humor which could have arisen 
from the unexpected and improbable scenario has been defused by our 
familiarity with the material. Imagine, for instance, directors Bobby and 
Peter Farrelly's last picture, "There's Something About Mary", if you 
knew Chris Elliott was Woogie. Few comedies can sustain the laughs no 
matter how well-acquainted we are with them ("The Philadelphia Story" 
does it for me; so does "Mystery Science Theater 3000"). "Me, Myself & 
Irene" is no exception.</P>
<P>There's also something of a miscalculation in the script by the Farrellys 
and Mike Cerrone. Hank starts off as an amusing character -- consider his 
revenge against a woman who skips ahead of Charlie in the supermarket 
line-up, for example -- but then the writers seem to assume that Hank as a
concept is good enough. However, Hank himself isn't funny; he's 
grotesque, really. To work, Hank needs to be doing funny things, but for 
much of the middle third of the film, he doesn't, and this contributes to 
long stretches of comparative tedium. There are also some really bizarre 
moments, like the late introduction of another companion for Charlie and 
Irene, the weird albino Whitey (Michael Bowman), whose inclusion seems 
almost an afterthought. Or the inexplicable cameo appearance by tennis 
star Anna Kournikova, which seems to exist just so we can realise, "Hey, 
that's Anna Kournikova!"</P>
<P>Fortunately, things pick up heading into the home stretch, especially 
once Charlie and Hank start to coexist simultaneously. It is these scenes 
in particular that really give Carrey a chance to shine, and he makes 
exhaustive use of his rubber-faced, marionette-limbed repertoire. Carrey 
also does a good job playing Charlie and Hank as truly different yet 
fundamentally interconnected, and it's a shame his material wasn't more
consistent. His interaction with the boys, for instance, is priceless, as 
he slips effortlessly into urban slang: "That be whack!"</P>
<P>Zellweger is also enjoyable, and gives Irene enough strength to hold up 
against the human onslaught that is Carrey. But Irene is a poor successor 
to Cameron Diaz's character in "Mary", because whereas Diaz was both the 
instigator and victim of comic moments, Zellweger is usually just left to 
react to Carrey's antics.</P>
<P>There has been some controversy surrounding "Me, Myself & Irene", and the 
erroneous association of the term "schizophrenic" with Charlie's split 
personalities. Although the term "schizo" is used on occasion in the 
film, it is never employed by someone who should know better -- instead 
they spit out "advanced delusionary schizophrenia with narcissistic rage" 
like it rolled right off the tongue. The purported "controversy" is a 
non-starter.</P>
<P>Indeed, I was surprised to find that the subject of multiple 
personalities is not just used as ammunition for jokes, but instead earns 
some serious consideration as well. There is a theme running throughout 
"Me, Myself & Irene" that many people assume fabricated identities, be it 
for profit, or escape, or just to cover up a mistake. This is true not 
just of Charlie, but also Irene, Whitey, the corrupt cops, even Shonte 
the limo driver. "Me, Myself & Irene" being the kind of movie that it is, 
the idea is not pursued to any great lengths, but I appreciated its 
inclusion nonetheless.</P>
<P>I had great hopes for this reteaming of Jim Carrey and the Farrelly 
brothers (they first worked together on "Dumb And Dumber"), and in the 
final analysis I'll admit to feeling a little disappointed. "Me, Myself & 
Irene" is not the best comedy for either, trying but failing to be as 
funny and outlandish as superior entries in their respective
filmographies. But it is very entertaining all the same -- and if it 
doesn't appeal to the Charlie in you, maybe there's a little bit of Hank 
lurking inside that will enjoy it instead.</P>
