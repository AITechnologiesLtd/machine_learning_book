<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A very familiar crime story, one that has been often done in recent
times, about a rough Irish neighborhood and the hoods who can't escape
from it. "Southie" is about such residents in South Boston, an old
blue-collar Irish neighborhood. First-time director John Shea has made
this independent low-budget film, that is long on gritty atmosphere
but short on substance. It's a violent film, where action speaks
louder than words. The climax between the two rival Irish Mafia gangs
is settled with guns not words. There doesn't seem to be a point to
this film, except to show some tough guys in action, and how difficult
it is to stop old habits. The acting is good enough and the background
music, a mixture of rap, rock, and Celtic sounds, evokes a sense of
Irish doom.  But, the story fails to build any drama into it, and
everything seems too bleak. It is an easy film to take on its terms,
if you want to take a look at such a dead-end of possibilities and
watch a dysfunctional family spin out of control. It reminded me of
"Monument Ave.," which covered the same territory.</P>
<P>Danny Quinn (Donnie Wahlberg) comes back to his old stomping grounds
in South Boston after running away to New York City for the last three
years to detox from alcohol and to turn over a new leaf from his old
roughhouse ways. The last time he was in town, he was in a drunken
stupor and held a gun to the head of a rival Irish gang leader's son,
Joey Ward (Cummings).</P>
<P>Danny comes home to a close-knit but dysfunctional family that is in a
crisis situation. Anne Meara is his widowed mother, suffering from
stress due to a heart condition, who is trying to hold the troubled
family together without a father-figure present. She has been in and
out of the hospital for the past few years due to all the family
stress.  Kathy (Rose McGowan) is Danny's alcoholic sister, who is
taking a walk on the wild side. His two brothers are unemployed and
have incurred big gambling debts to the Irish Mafia.</P>
<P>Mrs. Quinn looks upon Danny as the savior of the family, glad that he
now drinks soda instead of whiskey, and that he wants to be a
construction worker not a gangster. He tells his ex-girlfriend
(Amanda) that he's a changed man and everyone else in the neighborhood
who would believe him. The weakness in the script, is in how fast this
changes when he can't get a job and he quickly gets back with his
low-level mobster friends. Whitey (Arnett) has plans to open an
illegal after-hours casino and talks Danny into becoming a partner,
but he fails to tell Danny that his other partner is Joey Ward. It was
just too difficult to understand how that could happen considering the
hatred between these two is known throughout the community and how
Danny swore he wouldn't do anything dishonest anymore.</P>
<P>This casino partnership starts all the fireworks between Powers' Irish
gang, the one Danny has close ties with, and the upstart Butchie Ward
gang. A predictable shootout occurs between the two gangs and Danny's
past is relived, as he is drawn into the conflict. There are no
surprises here, everything goes down a path to nowhere. Since the film
has no final note to end on, it uses the St. Paddy's Day parade to
have its final shot--which is tantamount to waving the flag to
indicate patriotism, or in this case, Irish pride.</P>
