<P>Jackie Chan is one of the biggest movie stars on Earth, except in the 
United States, where he has only a fiercely devoted cult following. 
Determined to achieve the mass-market success that offerings like "Rumble 
in the Bronx" and "Mr. Nice Guy" failed to provide, the 44-year-old Hong 
Kong native put himself completely in the hands of Hollywood for his 
latest shot at becoming an American superstar. "It's not for the money. 
It's for the face," he said in an Associated Press interview. "You know 
Chinese, always face." </P>
<P>His current efforts to save face include fighting less and allowing 
himself to be plugged into the formulaic mismatched-cop action/comedy 
"Rush Hour." "Now, if it doesn't work," said Chan, "that means American 
audience do not accept my kind of action, or my kind of personality, or 
me." </P>
<P>Luckily for Chan, it works. "Rush Hour" is a lot of fun, thanks to flashy 
action scenes, sharp one-liners and the chemistry between Chan and 
motormouth comedian Chris Tucker. Sure, it's just another cookie-cutter 
cop flick, but this particular cookie tastes pretty good.</P>
<P>Like "Lethal Weapon 4," "Rush Hour" uses the cop movie format merely as 
an excuse to showcase its stars and pyrotechnics. "Every so often we have 
to let the general public know that we can still blow shit up," says one 
cop, perfectly voicing the mind-set of most Hollywood producers. Unlike 
"Lethal Weapon 4," "Rush Hour" has a plot which, while not particularly 
original, is at least coherent. </P>
<P>The story begins on the eve of the historic 1997 transfer of Hong Kong 
back to the Chinese (it's a miracle the filmmakers didn't trip over the 
electrical cables of other movie crews, since both "Knock Off" and "The 
Chinese Box" are also set in the same city on the same day). Detective 
Inspector Lee (Chan) raids the lair of a legendary crime lord, recovering 
a huge cache of stolen artwork.</P>
<P>Cut to Los Angeles, where LAPD Detective James Carter (Tucker) annoys 
every officer within a ten mile radius with his reckless techniques and 
non-stop babbling. When the Chinese consul flies in Lee to assist in the 
search for his kidnapped daughter, the FBI asks the LAPD to provide a cop 
to ''baby-sit'' Lee so that he doesn't hinder their investigation. 
Carter's chief happily assigns him to the task and, quicker than you can 
say "movie cliché," a maverick mismatched cop team is born.</P>
<P>But it works, because Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan really click together. 
Tucker slightly tones down his hyperactive, helium-voiced, in-your-face 
chatter, making his character humorously abrasive rather than 
insufferable. He's actually quite fun to watch as he talks his way in and 
out of trouble, periodically breaking into a bizarre urban-Egyptian form 
of dance and using leering effeminate movements to challenge other males. 
I have no idea how Tucker developed his alien-on-amphetamines shtick, but 
he's certainly one of a kind.</P>
<P>The wonderful Jackie Chan, a martial arts hybrid of Buster Keaton and 
Gene Kelly, is the absolute master of ingenious escapes, and he displays 
some of his remarkably adroit artistry here, scrambling up walls and 
trees, skittering across a very high beam, disarming bad guys and 
tumbling from great heights in dazzling style. He has less stunts than 
usual, but remains a wonder to behold. As always, his physical gifts are 
complimented by his comedic skills and geniality. Chan is one of the most 
likable performers in the business and it's a pleasure spending time with 
him.  </P>
<P>Together, Chan and Tucker are an appealing sweet and sour team, with 
their contrasting personalities providing a lot of laughs, even as 
culture clash jokes fly fast and loose in all directions. Personally, I 
found a number of Carter's Asian one-liners to be borderline racist, but 
if Jackie Chan didn't find the jokes offensive, I suppose I can be a good 
sport about it as well.</P>
<P>With its tired premise, superfluous supporting cast, cheesy dramatic 
moments and painfully obvious plot twists, "Rush Hour" should have been 
just another buddy cop throwaway, but instead the film is light, fast, 
breezy fun. It just goes to show that the right stars can make even the 
most pedestrian material shine. If this film doesn't finally make Jackie 
Chan a major star in the United States, blame the American public, 
because Chan is certainly delivering the goods.</P>
