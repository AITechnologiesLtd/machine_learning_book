<PRE>APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX
Rated R, 196 minutes
Directed by Francis Ford Coppola
WHEN, WHERE:
Now playing at the Grand Illusion
 </PRE>
<P>As America reels under the agony of terrorism and Washington rattles its
saber at Afghanistan, and CNN unfurls the banner of `AMERICA'S NEW WAR' across
our television screens, it's as good a time as any to remember another war in an
inaccessible land halfway around the world.  After 22 years, Francis Ford
Coppola has finally completed his Vietnam epic, `Apocalypse Now'.  When he
introduced it at Cannes in 1979, the director described it as `a work in
progress,' and complained of critics carping at a picture that wasn't even
finished, though it was coming out in theaters.  He was 100% over budget (a
then-scandalous $31 million), more than a year over schedule, battered in mind,
body, and spirit from massive production disasters of God's making and his own,
and under intense pressure to deliver a movie that would not tax the attention
span of its audience.  Sounding a little unhinged by the strain, he declared at
a press conference `This picture isn't about Vietnam.  It is Vietnam.'</P>
<P>Now, working with his original editor Walter Murch from the original
dailies, he has remixed and re-edited, and restored some 49 minutes from the
cutting room floor.  He calls this revisited version `Apocalypse Now Redux'.  
Now that it's finally ready for the critics, how is it?  It's extraordinary. 
Coppola, who's now in the wine business, has learned a little something about
letting things age and ripen.  At 2 ½  hours the original release was hardly
rushed, but the restored footage expands and enlightens the director's Dantesque
vision of a world gone mad with war.</P>
<P>The story, briefly, is a Vietnam adaptation of the Joseph Conrad novella
Heart of Darkness.  Marlow becomes Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), a Special
Forces assassin who is given a mission to go up river, locate a rogue American
colonel named Kurtz (Marlon Brando), and `terminate him with extreme prejudice.'
 As he studies Kurtz's brilliant résumé, and as he draws closer to his quarry,
Willard comes to understand and even admire the man, and becomes increasingly
aware that the darkness is not just in the mad Kurtz, but in the system, in the
war, and in himself.  </P>
<P>The war in `Apocalypse' is a war without a real enemy presence.  It is not
filled with  pitched battles against enemy troops.  The primary thrust is the
American Willard on a mission to destroy the American Kurtz, with a few almost
incidental skirmishes en route, most of them involving civilians.  It is, in
effect, a war with ourselves.</P>
<P>The biggest chunk of restored footage is a scene at a French plantation,
where Willard puts in to bury a slain crewman (Larry Fishburne), and stays for
dinner and a bit of romance amid the ruined elegance of a lost colonial world
unmoored from reality.  Cut originally because it was thought to distract from
the upriver momentum of Willard's quest, it now opens a ghostly window onto the
experience of the French in Vietnam, a cause already lost but not yet learned
from.  `You Americans,' says the French planter (Christian Marquand), `you are
fighting for the biggest nothing in history.'  </P>
<P>Another resurrected scene has Willard bargaining fuel for sexual favors for
his men from a stranded USO troupe of Playboy bunnies.  This scene doesn't work
as well as it should, and smacks of pandering, but it has a point to make about
exploitation.  The rest of the additions serve to deepen the sense of place and
character.</P>
<P>The intervening years have given `Redux' a deeper resonance.  Many of the
lines of dialogue and narration vibrate like lost chords.  Those young actors
have grown older, but in the movie they're like soldiers thawed from memory on
the battlefield.  Martin Sheen was a down-the-ladder choice for the role of
Willard.  Coppola had wanted Pacino, Caan, Nicholson, even Clint Eastwood.  He'd
hired Harvey Keitel, then fired him, and settled at last on Sheen.  Looking at
it now it is apparent, as it was not to me then, that Sheen mustered a
heroically intense performance that is both wild-eyed and understated, nearly
killing himself with a heart attack in the process.  That he survived and is
now, in our hearts and television sets, the President of the United States,
gives that youthful military assassin an extra dimension.</P>
<P>Robert Duvall's celebrated Col. Kilgore is as vivid as ever, swaggering
through smoke and bullets, destroying a village to make a beach safe for
surfing, and relishing `the smell of napalm in the morning.'  But added moments
showing Kilgore compassionately helping wounded Vietnamese children, only to
drop them without a thought when the surf comes up, give a new insight to his
character, and ours.  Duvall has said in interviews he feels the added footage
shows that Kilgore is more than just a madman, but Coppola seems to me to be
making a different point – that we Americans enjoy our moment of compassion, but
we're easily distracted.  </P>
<P>Brando, who demanded and got the obscene sum of one million dollars (a
figure now tinny with irony, like Dr. Evil's world ransom) for playing Kurtz,
shocked the filmmakers and the public in '79 with his corpulence.  Coppola
swathed him in heavy shadows to conceal it, but with  today's huge Brando for a
point of reference, the man looks trim.  Anyway, why shouldn't Kurtz have been
fat?  He was living deep in the jungle, without a military regimen, deified by
Montagnard tribesmen who catered to his every whim.  Like Brando's in Tahiti,
Kurtz's situation is conducive to weight gain.  Brando is said to have toyed
with his young director, improvising dialogue, playing mind games, and behaving
arrogantly.  Whatever hell he put Coppola through, it works – Brando's
megalomania infuses Kurtz with a freakish truth that a disciplined, scripted
performance might not have accomplished. </P>
<P>They don't make movies like this any more.  One has only to compare this
summer's big war movie, `Pearl Harbor', to see what accountancy and digital
gimcrackery have wrought on the genre.  Of course, they didn't make movies like
this back then, either – or perhaps only then, in that brief blaze of youthful
talent fueled with funds that seemed limitless, that produced `The Deer Hunter'
and `Apocalypse Now' and a few other works of impassioned, lunatic genius.  `The
way we made it was very much like the way the Americans were in Vietnam,'
Coppola said then.  `We were in the jungle, we had access to too much money and
too much equipment, and little by little we went insane.'</P>
<P>And now, we're back at war again.  As Kurtz observes, `the horror.'</P>
