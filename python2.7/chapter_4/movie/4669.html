<PRE>DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (1971) ***1/2</PRE>
<P>        One of the most entertaining James Bond outings, with Sean 
Connery in his last appearance as 007, is filled with the best of the 
usual Bond gimmicks--the supervillains, death traps, chase scenes, 
helpless women, killer women (Bambi and Thumper... Bambi's mad 
because her mom was killed and Thumper just wants to lash out 
because her foot won't stop twitching) and high-tech gadgets. Q even 
invents one for his own amusement that makes slot machines pay off.</P>
<P>        Yes, Bond's gone to Las Vegas this time to get to the bottom 
of a diamond caper headed by a villain who's perfected a cosmetic 
surgery technique that makes face-cloning possible. Then there are the 
evil homogenized two, Mr. Kidd and Mr. Play... Okay, the other guy's 
name isn't Play, but I've seen way too many Bond movies in way too 
short a time to remember the names of all the criminals. All I 
remember is one of the two looks a lot like Sonny Bono.</P>
<P>        Thankfully, the leading lady doesn't look like Sonny or Cher. 
It's Mrs. Robert Wagner, Jill St. John, who also guest-starred on the 
first episode of the "Batman" TV show as a villainous discotheque 
dancer who was vaporized in the Batcave's nuclear power generator. 
("What a terrible way to go-go," Batman laments.) If you haven't 
figured it out yet, it's my duty to interject a tidbit about "Batman" in 
roughly a tenth of the reviews I write.</P>
<P>        St. John also inspires the best line in the movie. Bond is 
making out with her when a group of bad guys burst into the hotel 
room. "Gentlemen," he says, "I'm afraid you've caught me with more 
than my hands up." Now that's The Man!</P>
