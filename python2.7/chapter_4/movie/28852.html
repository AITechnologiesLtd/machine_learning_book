<PRE>AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS
A film review by Christopher Null
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Would you believe -- in real life, I mean -- that if you were Julia
Roberts, that you'd be the ugly underdog to your sister, the creepy
Catherine Zeta-Jones?</P>
<P>Let me tell you what reality is.  Reality is that you are megastar Julia
Fricking Roberts and your brother is Eric Roberts, and he picks up
whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across
the sky in a golden chariot.</P>
<P>That's reality.  America's Sweethearts is the opposite of reality, a
train wreck that tries to sell Julia as a scruffy also-ran, presumably
because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight
(uh-huh).</P>
<P>The plot follows two married, mega-movie stars, Gwen and Eddie
(Zeta-Jones and poor, poor John Cusack, whose material gets worse every
year), on the eve of their new star vehicle's release, a film called
Time Over Time.  The only problem: Gwen and Eddie have gone through a
nasty separation, and the press and public have not been forgiving
(think Meg and Dennis).  Gosh, and the director has vanished with the
film, holding the only print hostage.  Veteran PR agent Lee (Billy
Crystal) is called upon to clean up the mess, throwing a press junket in
the Nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible
reconciliation between the Gwen and Eddie, presumably distracting the
stupid, stupid film critics into forgetting they haven't seen the movie
at all.  (Note to Sony: Any studio executive that thinks this plot is
going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab.)</P>
<P>And did I mention Gwen's sister Kiki (Roberts) is along for the ride? 
And that she and Eddie just might fall in love along the way?</P>
<P>Oh Billy, you're a scamp!  The script you've co-written with Peter Tolan
(What Planet Are You From? and Bedazzled -- need I say more?) is a roast
of Hollywood and celebrity, sure, but it's not a funny one.  Yes,
Crystal tells us, Hollywood is lying to our faces!  If you are surprised
by this, you might want to check on your subscription to People
magazine.  It's about to expire.</P>
<P>Aside from a scant few zingers (Yeah, Señor Winces rules!), America's
Sweethearts' jokes aren't funny, its pace is choppy, and the whole
affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star Julia
Roberts -- but for Billy Crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines
that he wrote himself.  I didn't time it (the movie's not that bad), but
it's Crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal
focus of the film.  Bad move, Billy -- your jokes suck.  The crotch
humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie's gags -- and with
unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene, how this movie
earned a PG-13 rating is a mystery to me.</P>
<P>Julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make My Best
Friend's Wedding into a winning film, but not even that 90-tooth smile
can save her here.  Obviously aware of the ugliness before him, director
Joe Roth turns to goofy supporting characters like Hank Azaria (as a
lisping Spaniard), Christopher Walken (the insane Time Over Time
director), and Alan Arkin (a New Age guru in a fright wig) to crack
wise.  None of the stereotypes is successful except for Walken; Azaria
comes off as a preening queen when he's supposed to be macho.  As for
Roth, in case you don't know, went from direcing Revenge of the Nerds II
to launching his own movie studio, Revolution, which produced this
work.  He's back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years. 
It'll probably be another 11 before he's back again.</P>
<P>I could drone on about how America's Sweethearts will only appeal to the
mouth-breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies,
but that would get old.  Instead, I'll settle for discussing the movie's
worst sin: that Sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly
unbelievable, not just in its plot but in its sentiment.  Every single
character in this film (with the arguable exception of Kiki) is simply
hateful, and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of
villains.  When you leave the theater, you'll ask yourself, too: Why
would I want any of these jerks to be happy?</P>
