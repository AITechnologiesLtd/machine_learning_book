<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A classic adventure tale about greed set in the Mexican wilderness. A
good story is infused with too much symbolic pretentiousness, yet the
overall effect is absorbing. The film won an Academy Award for Best
Screenplay and Director for John Huston, while his father Walter Huston
won for Best Supporting Actor. It was nominated for Best Film, but lost
to Hamlet.</P>
<P>Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is a disheveled drifter, down and out in
Tampico, Mexico, where he spends his last few pesos on a lottery ticket.
Curtin (Tim Holt) is another drifter who teams up with Dobbs after the
two get cheated out of their wages by their hustler boss (MacLane), who
ditches them after the job and the two get paid only after they find him
in town and work him over. While staying in a flophouse shelter they
hear Howard (Walter Huston), a toothless old buzzard, tempt them with
stories about prospecting for gold. When Dobbs wins the lottery the
three pool their money together for supplies and become partners,
heading for the isolated hills of Mexico to look for gold.</P>
<P>Following Howard's knowledge in prospecting, they find gold but are
warned by Howard that gold can change a man's soul. The three characters
are archetypes: Dobbs is the bad one, suffering from paranoia. Howard is
the wise old man. Curtin is the level-headed innocent.</P>
<P>The men have trouble adjusting to their new wealth, as Dobbs becomes
unnecessarily leery of the others and insists they split their share now
before they reach the town of Durango.</P>
<P>When Curtin goes to town for supplies, he will meet an American in town
he couldn't shake, who follows him back to the campsite. The nervy
stranger, Cody (Bennett), wants to be cut in as a full partner in their
prospecting and refuses to leave. The men decide they have three
choices: 1-Cut him in as a partner. 2- Kick him out and let him go back
to town; or, 3- Kill him. They decide on the last choice, but before
they could plug him, they are approached by bandits who intend to rob
them, led by the notorious train robber Gold Hat (Alfonso Bedoya). In
the shootout, Cody gets killed but the bandits flee.</P>
<P>Heading to Durango to cash in their gold dust, some Indians come to
their campsite and request that one of them help save a young boy's
life. Howard succeeds and is honored by the Indian community, as the two
other partners go ahead to meet him in town. But in leaving the two
alone without Howard's wisdom, Dobbs becomes increasingly more mentally
unstable and his greed takes hold of him, which results in tragedy.</P>
<P>The film plays as a morality story, showing that the deadliest dangers
to man are in his soul and not from the external dangers. This black and
white film is very well acted, especially by Bogie and Walter Huston,
but is not as gripping and intriguing as John Huston's masterpiece --
"The Maltese Falcon."</P>
