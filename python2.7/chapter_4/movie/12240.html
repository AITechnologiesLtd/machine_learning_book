<P>Review:  The Man in the Iron Mask (1998)</P>
<PRE>by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<PRE>2 and a half stars out of 5</PRE>
<P>The Man in the Iron Mask is one of those indulgent, corrosively funny films with
one liners that send cheers from the audience and genuinely pointless scenes
that receive sniggers and snorts a plenty.  Theres just one problem  its not
a comedy.  Or at least, it doesnt intend to be one.</P>
<P>You cant say that new comer director Randall Wallace couldnt have seen it
coming.  The international cast of Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, John
Malkovich, Girard Depardieu and Gabriel Byrne makes the film constantly sound,
look and feel strikingly different.  Surely, the films greatest achievement is
showing the audience how laughable A grade actors can be if placed in the wrong
situations.</P>
<P>King Louis (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the ruler of France in 1660, but hes not
exactly a wise and thoughtful leader.  He gives rotten food to his people, sends
soldiers to their death so he can have their wives, and locks up his own brother
in a prison for 6 years just so he can claim the crown by himself.  Three of the
four main musketeers (Irons, Malkovich, Depardieu) that faithfully served his
father decide that they have had enough of Louis evil ways, and devise a scheme
to replace the King and bring justice to the people of France.  Their plan: to
dig up Louis identical twin brother (wearing an iron mask) and make a royal
swap.  The only remaining loyal-to-the-thrown musketeer, DArtagnan (Gabriel
Bynre) attempts to foil their plan of treason against the King.</P>
<P>Amused yet? It gets worse.  Without giving too much of the rest of the story
away, let me just say that if you can imagine the most likely possible ending,
then the chances are youd be predicting it very well (with the exception of
some very silly plot twists towards the films completion).</P>
<P>The Man in the Iron Mask is at times a reasonably entertaining film, and if you
re excited about the promise of musketeers in shiny uniforms then you perhaps
you will enjoy it a little (or a lot) more than I did.  But really, what we have
is a film that takes itself so incredibly serious all you can do is laugh  both
at the dialogue and the execution in general.  And, of course, the fact that we
are supposed to believe that these musketeers come from the same part in the
world.</P>
<P>On the up side, some of the battle scenes are genuinely entertaining.  And, may
the truth be told, I liked looking at Leonardo DiCaprio a lot better when he had
that mask on.</P>
