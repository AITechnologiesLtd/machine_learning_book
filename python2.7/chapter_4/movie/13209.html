<P>GODZILLA
Rating: ** (out of four)
PG-13, 1998
Directed by Roland Emmerich. Screenplay by Emmerich and Dean Devlin.
Starring Matthew Broderick, Maria Pitillo, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria.</P>
<P>GODZILLA, as I'm sure you already know, is a movie about destruction
wrought by a giant lizard created through genetic mutations due to nuclear
fallout in the South Pacific area. I'm no biologist, but I'm pretty sure
this is pure nonsense. But that kind of thing isn't what makes or breaks a
monster movie. I'm more than willing to turn my brain off and watch a giant
lizard destroy New York City and lay its soon-to-hatch eggs all over the
place as long as the script and logic manage not to actively annoy me.
Well, bad news: GODZILLA annoyed me often, and in many ways.</P>
<P>First off, there's the World's Most Incompetent Military Strike Force.
These guys plow into New York City with lots of high-tech weapons to fire
at the lizard...and they MISS!  Not once, not twice, they miss OVER AND
OVER AND OVER AGAIN. They fire missiles into the side of the Chrysler
Building, as well as several other skyscrapers, but they can't hit
Godzilla. As the city's Mayor Ebert (played by Michael Lerner in an obvious
parody of film critic Roger Ebert--he has an assistant named "Gene") points
out, the military causes even more destruction than Godzilla does. Why did
director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin, who co-wrote the
screenplay, make these guys into such idiots? Did they need a catalyst for
another ten minutes of destruction? (Hey guys, here's an idea: there's a
GIANT LIZARD on the loose.) Was it supposed to drum up sympathy for the
monster ? (Not a bad idea, but if that was their goal, the follow-up was
hardly adequate.) In any case, the result is puzzling at best.</P>
<P>The characters in this film are at best one-dimensional and at worst boring
and irritating. Matthew Broderick does okay as an expert biologist, as does
Jean Reno as a French secret service agent (who is involved in this
because--don't laugh--the French government supposedly feels guilty about
its nuclear tests in the South Pacific). Hank Azaria is, I guess, intended
as comic relief as a TV cameraman nicknamed "Animal," but his humorous
moments are ill-conceived. I realize that disaster movies have to tone down
the pure panic that would likely occur in a real giant lizard attack, but
honestly, do you know anyone who would wag his finger at a rampaging
400-foot-tall lizard and declare, "Now I'm really pissed!"? Maria Pitillo,
playing a reporter wannabe who was once engaged to Broderick's character,
is stuck with the role of a complete ditz. She's not ditzy in an endearing
way, nor would she even work as an object of mockery. She's just grating to
the point that you want her off the screen as soon as she opens her mouth.</P>
<P>This movie is full of misfired attempts at humor. There are times when the
script seems to be in some sort of contest with last year's BATMAN AND
ROBIN for bad one-liners ("This lizard reproduces asexually." "Where's the
fun in that?"). The Siskel and Ebert parodies were mildly amusing at first,
but obvious takes on real people are a risky form of comedy that belong to
the realm of spoof or of cameo appearances, and these two wear out their
welcome by a long shot. Then there's a scene of a taxicab inside Godzilla's
mouth, which miraculously results in no one biting the dust but does give
Azaria cause to scream "You're going the wrong way!" at the frantic driver.
Add this to some pure silliness like Broderick managing to trip up some of
Godzilla's babies by throwing ball candy on the floor in their path, and I
was occasionally left wondering if I was watching a Zucker brothers parody
of Godzilla movies.</P>
<P>GODZILLA isn't even a great example of a simple action movie. The conflicts
between these characters are for the most part shallow and uninteresting,
and this is one case in which the filmmakers would have done better to just
accept their one-dimensionality and get on with the explosions, monsters,
and general chaos. Instead, we're treated to long, boring scenes in which
they exchange cliched dialogue. Up until the second half of the movie, the
destruction and mayhem is surprisingly lifeless, running the gamut from
repetitive, mediocre imitations of INDEPENDENCE DAY, the Devlin/Emmerich
team's previous film, to downright laughable when the military manages to
hit everything in the city with the exception of the 400-foot-tall giant
lizard. Finally, as if to suck even more dramatic tension out of the action
scenes, Devlin and Emmerich telegraph most of them a mile away. "Did you
hear that?" one character whispers to another as they track Godzilla's
babies through underground tunnels. "What?" the other responds. Gee, you
think something's about to jump out at them?</P>
<P>After all this ranting, you may wonder why I gave GODZILLA any stars at
all. First of all, the action is fairly well executed towards the end of
the movie as the four principal characters are trapped inside Madison
Square Garden with hostile Godzilla babies. Yes, it's a JURASSIC
PARK ripoff, and yes, it's interrupted with dumb jokes like Broderick
opening an elevator door to find the monsters right outside and announcing,
"Sorry, wrong floor," but it still managed to keep me entertained even
though I knew Steven Spielberg had done it better. The final romp through
the city with the big guy himself is also quite good, ending with an
exciting chase on the Brooklyn Bridge. The movie also gains points for
portraying Godzilla not as an evil monster bent on destruction but as
nothing more than an animal trying to find a habitat. In this scenario, the
humans are not morally upstanding beings defending their rights, but simply
a competing species. This is slightly more thoughtful than simple
"Aaaaahhh, it's a big scary monster, kill it!" logic, but none of the
characters seem to think or talk about it very much, and the filmmakers do
little with this aspect of the story other than to portray the attempts to
down Godzilla with a certain amount of regret.</P>
<P>For about half of its excessive two-hour-plus runnning time,
GODZILLA provided some good edge-of-the-seat thrills, so I suppose it's a
partial success as a monster movie. Still, it's saying something about a
film that its best moments are when the filmmakers start unashamedly
ripping off other movies and reduce their characters to stick figures who
exist only to run around. If Godzilla comes back for a sequel, as the
ending indicates he probably will, I have a few suggestions: scrap these
characters, quit trying to be so cute, and find some more original ways to
create mayhem.</P>
