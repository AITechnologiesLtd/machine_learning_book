<P>     Eight boys, led by Benjamin Rodriquez (Mike Vitar), make up a
sandlot baseball team in Southern California during the late fifties.
When Scotty Small (Tom Guiry) moves into town, he doesn't know how to
catch or throw, despite the best efforts of his stepfather to teach
him.  That all changes, however, when Ben befriends him.  Now, with
their ninth man, the sandlot group is a full team.  However, although
their little field is a great place to play ball, it has its dark
secret, for beyond the home run fence lurks The Beast, some kind of
fearsome dog about which frightful stories abound.</P>
<P>     Kids and adults will enjoy THE SANDLOT, but for different
reasons.  Children will find in it an adventure with a sense of humor
that they can both relate to and find in an escape from the real
world.  Writer/director David Mickey Evans hasn't forgotten what it's
like to be a boy in the middle of summer with nothing to do but swim in
pools, pal around, and play ball.</P>
<P>     Adults, especially men, will find in the movie a sense of
almost-poignant nostalgia.  The story is told WONDER YEARS-style, with
a modern day baseball announcer looking back on his childhood (the
narrative is at times too reminiscent of Kevin Arnold's ramblings).  As
is frequently the case when we look back on our past, things are tinted
by a pleasant glow that leaves behind only the better parts of the
memories.  This is the feel that THE SANDLOT strives for, and mostly
succeeds in attaining.</P>
<P>     The common theme bridging the age gap in the audience is
baseball.  This is a world where the game means everything.  There is
no arbitration, no salary disputes, no 8 million dollar contracts.  In
the world of THE SANDLOT, baseball is still America's number one
national pastime, and, in the closing scenes with James Earl Jones,
it's easy to get a sense of the greatness that underlies playing ball.</P>
<P>     Those that have a distaste for baseball will probably find little
to like in this movie.  While it isn't necessarily written just for
fans of the game, enjoying baseball--as well as having some memories
of playing on any level--will enhance the pleasure of watching THE
SANDLOT.  Sure, the movie gets silly at times, and the second half
isn't as engaging as the first, but since the entire story is a fond
collage of memories made more grand by the passage of time, it's easy
to forgive such faults.</P>
<P>     To classify this picture as a "male film" is to do it a great
disservice.  THE SANDLOT is no more a movie for men and boys alone than
FRIED GREEN TOMATOES is just for women.  Even though all the main
characters (except Scotty's mom, played by Karen Allen) are boys
doesn't mean that women can't appreciate what happens on screen.
Memories of childhood are frequently gender-independent.  Men might
have the inside track of some elements of nostalgia touched on by THE
SANDLOT, but they don't have a monopoly.  And humor, as well as the
love of baseball, are universal.</P>
<P>     There will be those who will find this film a too-silly fantasy,
but they have either missed or chosen not to feel the magic that THE
SANDLOT weaves.  With the exception of some mild profanity, there's
little in this movie capable of offending.  THE SANDLOT is an excellent
choice for a family night at the movies.  The previews for it may look
bland, but this is one occasion when clips are unable to do more than
scratch the surface of the mood and story from which they have been
extracted. Predictable as the movie is, the FIELD OF DREAMS quality is
not the only thing to like about THE SANDLOT.</P>
<PRE>             Rating: 8.4 out of 10 (B+, *** out of ****)</PRE>
