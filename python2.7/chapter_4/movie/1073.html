<PRE>                                QUEENS LOGIC
                       A film review by Ann Hodgins
                        Copyright 1991 Ann Hodgins</PRE>
<P>     It has been compared to DINER and THE BIG CHILL, and there is some
truth in that claim.  Like DINER, it is about boys becoming men, but in
QUEEN'S LOGIC the women and less oppressed, stronger and more supportive
of each other.  Like THE BIG CHILL, it is about a get-together --
occasioned by a wedding in this case, not a funeral - that decisively
changes the lives of the participants.  But QUEENS LOGIC is funkier
than BC and concerns itself with a different class and type of people.</P>
<P>     I appreciated QUEENS LOGIC more than either of the other two
movies.   I enjoyed the performances more and somehow warmed to the
characters more.  I particularly delighted in Tom Waits as a gorgeously
dressed, switchblade-wielding aesthete, and John Malkovich as a gay man
who never met another gay man he could like.</P>
<P>     Most of all I enjoyed the party scenes in QUEENS LOGIC.  Earlier
in the movie, a character announces enigmatically: "An event is about
to take place that may or may not result in a wedding."  During the
party, this prophesy is strangely and wonderfully fulfilled.</P>
<P>     I found the plot of QUEENS LOGIC unpredictable and the characters
original.  I enjoyed it and I recommend it to people who like movies
about people and their relationships.</P>
