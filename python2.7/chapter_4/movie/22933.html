<P>[LIGHT SPOILERS - Nothing here you shouldn't read]</P>
<P>When I become a significant enough celebrity to be interviewed (not
too long now...), inevitably I will be asked how I wound up where I
am. And when that happens, I'll sit back in my flower-encircled
chair... contemplate the ceiling for a moment... and say, "Oh, let's
seeeee..." sigh... "Well, gee, I'd say it's gotta be my strong family
ties, all the common goals and interests I share with my friends... my
unflinching determination... my charismatic smile and humble
modesty... and a sense that, darn it, I know who I am and where I
belong..."</P>
<P>Or, maybe I'll say, "Oh, let's seeeee... it's gotta be a bus ride
twenty-five years ago in Washington DC, a passing compliment to a
stranger about a nice hat, the mechanics of alphabetical order, and a
3 a.m. emergency room visit a couple Januarys back."</P>
<PRE>Either way. So goes Magnolia.</PRE>
<P>With his stunning third film, writer/director P.T. Anderson has
composed a beautiful symphony of human interaction. This is a rich and
insightful study of the invisible forces that bind us together even as
they seemingly alienate us.  The story darts between the lives of
nearly a dozen lonely people that are all tangentially
connected. Weather patterns are used as both a recurring metaphor for
the fragile, forceful, seemingly chaotic connections between human
lives, as well as a bit of foreshadowing for a scene that I will
continue to marvel at until the day they stop making these moving
picture shows.</P>
<P>Some may ask: "Do we really need to sit through a three and a half
hour movie to find out that we don't have complete control of our
lives? I could have told you that when I was eight." My answer is,
well, no, I suppose you don't have to - but Magnolia never pretends
it's letting us in on something we don't already know.</P>
<P>P. T. Anderson proves here what he hinted at with Boogie Nights - he
is a gifted and talented filmmaker. I once read a book which argued
that entering the mind of another person would be like landing on an
alien shore - strangely familiar, mostly incomprehensible. Anderson
knows this too, it seems, as every character in Magnolia has a unique
history, personality, and drive.</P>
<P>The remarkable cast plays no small part in bringing these people to
vibrant life. There isn't a single off performance here, although in
this crew of standouts, Tom Cruise somehow manages to shine as the
repulsively charismatic Frank T.J. Mackey, a wreck of a human being if
ever there was one. His role requires dynamic personality changes, and
Cruise handles each one precisely right, delivering a complete and
complex character sketch. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, whose recent work
in Boogie Nights and Happiness (among a handful of others) have shown
us he is well on his way to becoming one of the all-time great
character actors, plays a nurse who lives vicariously through those he
takes care of. William H. Macy can do no wrong in my book, and his
role here as a former child game show star Donnie Smith is one of his
finest, as a man with a ludicrously tragic obsession that serves as a
poor placeholder for absent love.  A young kid named Stanley Spector
(Jeremy Blackman) is now on the same game show that made former quiz
kid Donnie Smith what he is today. As we watch the young Stanley, we
feel as if we are witnessing a re-creation; then we wonder what would
have become of ol' Donnie if the length of a commercial break and the
size of a child's bladder had somehow managed to intervene in his life
thirty years ago. John Rielly's good-hearted police officer and Melora
Walters' nervous drug addict have an eerie chemistry together - as I
watched I couldn't decide whether they're the perfect match for one
another or exactly the opposite.</P>
<P>Magnolia manages to sustain as relentless and dizzying a pace as this
sort of drama can for the first two hours. I was both completely
engaged and exhausted by the time some welcome calm finally crept in
at the beginning of the third hour... in this case, the calm before
the storm. A remarkable scene, in which the majority of the characters
come to the same realization at the same time - is made more powerful
by one of the best uses of a soundtrack song (Aimee Mann penned the
majority of the songs) in my film-going memory. Moments of eerie
coincidence like this recur throughout and serve to strengthen the
idea that you can never be alone in a crowd.</P>
<P>This is the kind of movie that reveals itself slowly; it was four days
before I finally sorted everything out. Some things still leave me
puzzled, including the title. I made a wild guess that Magnolias
blossom slowly in the morning, but my knowledge of flower behavior is
sorely lacking these days... or perhaps, as the poster would seem to
indicate, each petal on a flower is independent, yet connected to the
whole... or, perhaps still, it's just a cool thing to name your
movie-that-dodges-conventional-naming. I sure as hell wouldn't know
what to call it. There's also a strange and indecipherable (well, to
me, anyway) rap delivered to Reilly's cop character by a potential
prophet - either it contained every answer I was looking for in one
neat little rhyme and I missed it, or it was just superfluous. I'd
have to see it again to figure that one out.</P>
<P>There is nothing timid about Magnolia. It is daring and bold as any
other film in this year of wonderful originality. (You've probably
heard about the brashness of the ending, but I dare not discuss it
here for fear of being drawn and quartered... though oh how it pains
me to hold my tongue...) Magnolia is melodramatic and shameless. It's
one of the best movies I've seen this year.</P>
