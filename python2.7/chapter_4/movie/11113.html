<P>Summary 
        Eight year old Ellie Arroway (Jena Malone) and her father, Ted (David
Morse), are very close. Her mother died while giving berth to her and her
father never remarried, bringing up Ellie on his own. She is a very
intelligent girl and her hobbies include such things as short wave radio
and telescopes, hobbies she shares closely with her dad. Tragedy strikes
her life when her dad dies that year.
        Flash forward to present time where Ellie (Jodie Foster) has pursued a
scientific career, becoming an astronomer. She listens intently to sounds
emitted by the universe, hoping to make contact with other intelligent
life.  She has a bumpy road ahead as her boss, Dr. Drumlin (Tom Skerritt)
informs her that her department is getting shut down. She refuses to give
up, and successfully interviews for an investor to back her project on her
own.
        Ellie's dreams come true when she eventually hears what she believes is an
intelligent signal from outer space. It is indeed confirmed to be so, and
the signal is decoded to reveal a shocking image. It is video footage of
Hitler giving his speech before the 1936 Olympics. That is not all. It also
appears that the signal contains thousands of pages of text, which turn out
to be blueprints for a machine. What exactly the machine will do is a
mystery, although it appears like it will act as a transport.
        Ellie finds that her troubles have only begun. She now has to deal with
many problems, including 
a brash, unfriendly military advisor (James Woods), her former boss who
returns to stake his claim, her lover (Matthew McConaughey) who questions
her non-religious motives, the overall media frenzy that the machine
causes, and bizarre dealings with the mysterious S.R. Hadden (John Hurt),
the owner of the company backing her project. 
All is not lost for Ellie, as she is eventually chosen to be the sole
person who will "pilot" the machine for its incredible journey into the
unknown, a journey into history.</P>
<P>Commentary
        I read many reviews for this film when it came out last summer and found
that people either loved it or hated it. There was no in between. I can
honestly say I fall in the "in between" category. 
        I liked some of the plot threads, such as the accurate depiction of the
media frenzy and radical religious groups. There are some good
performances, most notably William Fichtner who, I thought, had been
typecast to play psychotic killers, John Hurt as the eccentric millionaire,
and Angela Bassett as the White House Aide. Jodie Foster does her usual
fine job also.
        What I did not care for was the relationship between Foster and
McConaughey. They did not have much chemistry together, and I felt their
relationship was predictable. I could accurately guess every time the
McConaughey character was due to pop up in Ellie's life again, and I knew I
should have bet the farm on whether or not he would betray her at some
critical point during her quest. If anything, I felt Ellie had more
chemistry with John Hurt (of all people), considering both of them were
outcasts and a bit eccentric.
        There has been much talk about the ending to Contact, and this is where
most critics are divided. I felt that the ending was a major letdown.
Without giving away too much, lets just say that I felt that there could
have a been a lot more done with Ellie's destination and who she sees when
she gets there. The special effects are nothing special either.
        I have seen some good films with sub-par endings before ("Swimming With
Sharks" and the alternate ending to "Clerks" come to mind), and some of
them can be forgiven because the overall effect of the movie escapes
unscathed. But because the entire point of Contact relies on its ending,
and that ending is so poorly done, I cannot recommend the film.</P>
