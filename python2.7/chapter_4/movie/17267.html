<PRE>HOME FRIES by DeWyNGaLe    * * *</PRE>
<P>Drew Barrymore has had a very good year.  First, she did The Wedding Singer
with Adam Sandler, and then she carried her own movie, Ever After.  Both were
huge winners at the box office.  Now she brings us Home Fries, a romantic
comedy costarring Catherine O'Hara and Luke Wilson.  Luke Wilson isn't the
biggest name in Hollywood or anything, but he is still a good actor.  He and
Barrymore are dating in real life, after meeting on the set of this cute movie.</P>
<P>Barrymore stars as Sally, a worker at a restaurant called Burger Matic.  She is
pregnant from the affair she had with a man named Henry.  Henry's son, Dorian
(Luke Wilson), and his other son, Angus (Jake Busey), accidentally kill their
father by giving him a heart attack.  Their mother put them up to this because
he had an affair with another woman.  On the radio in the helicopter, they hear
fast food workers on interference and figure that they know.  So, Dorian gets a
job at Burger Matic, the same place where Sally works, the woman who had an
affair with his father.  OK, right now, you are probably very lost, but so was
I.  As the movie goes on, Dorian and Sally fall in love, not knowing that Sally
is also in love with Dorian's father.</P>
<P>When Dorian's mother (Catherine O'Hara) commands Angus and Dorian to kill
Sally, (she finds out from pictures who the woman is) Dorian must stop them
before the love of his life is killed.  Home Fries has a very weird and
original plot, not like any other movie I have ever seen.  That really boosts a
movie to a high level.  Drew Barrymore gives an outstanding performance, her
best since Scream.  This movie should boost Luke Wilson to a star level. 
Catherine O'Hara gives a very fake performance that was hard to believe.  Jake
Busey was very annoying and I wanted him to  go away.  Shelley Duvall did
great, and you really believed how her character was feeling.  Home Fries was
also suspenseful in it's own way.  I wanted certain things to happen and I
couldn't tell if they were going to or not.  </P>
<P>There were a lot of laughs in Home Fries, but not crack up funny ones.  Home
Fries is a cute, small movie, which should make some pretty good money at the
box office, but it wont be a blockbuster.  It should keep some people just
entertained.  It is a very simple movie, nothing really complex about it
(except the plot).  Home Fries was a really nice movie to watch on
Thanksgiving, and I enjoyed it a lot.</P>
