<PRE>THE WHOLE NINE YARDS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Who says Hollywood has run out of ideas?  How about a comedy about the
mob?  That's pretty fresh, right?</P>
<P>Jonathan Lynn's THE WHOLE NINE YARDS features a convoluted plot about
ever-changing mob factions that are trying to whack each other.  Add to
that lots of slapstick with guys running into doors and letting off gas,
and you can see the creative juices flowing like molasses going
upstream.  Mitchell Kapner's script, of course, has been done many times
before and usually much better (ANALYZE THIS and GOODFELLAS being just
two examples).  While THE WHOLE NINE YARDS is frequently cute, it's
rarely more than that.  The infrequent laughs are forced, and the movie
feels as stale as a month-old focaccia.</P>
<P>Bad accents are prominently featured, and none is worse than that of
Rosanna Arquette, who plays the obnoxious wife of a Montreal dentist,
whom she's trying to get murdered.  Matthew Perry, an actor with a
highly limited comedic range, is appallingly bad as her husband, Nick
"Oz" Oseransky.  Perry's numerous physical comedy routines are more
embarrassing than funny.</P>
<P>One day, Jimmy Jones a.k.a. Jimmy the Tulip Tudeski (Bruce Willis) moves
in next door to Oz.  In a complicated plot, the Chicago mob, led by
Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak with a repulsively bad accent), wants Jimmy
dead.  Jimmy in turn wants Yanni wasted.  And Jimmy's wife, Cynthia
(Natasha Henstridge), also has murderous intentions, although she's
somewhat more negotiable on exactly who dies.  Who will kill whom, and
who's on whose side changes constantly.</P>
<P>The humor is so droll that it usually isn't funny at all.  "It's not
important how many people I've killed," Jimmy tells Oz.  "It's how I get
along with those still alive."  Jimmy is so tough that he grabs flies,
sucks them into his mouth and spits them out as little corpses.</P>
<P>The film's only real enjoyment comes from two members of the supporting
cast.  Michael Clarke Duncan (THE GREEN MILE) plays Frankie Figs,
Jimmy's lovable bear of a sidekick.  When Duncan comes on the screen, he
has so much charisma that you want to stop the movie and hug him right
then and there.</P>
<P>The best character, Oz's receptionist, Jill, is played by Amanda Peet
from last year's atrocious BODY SHOTS.  Jill is a toothy brunette with
enthusiasm to burn.  A hit man groupie, she worships Jimmy like a rock
star.  When he invites her to help him, it's like Mick Jagger asking her
to come on stage and join him singing at a gig.  She's ready, literally,
to give Jimmy the shirt off of her back to help him with his plans.</P>
<P>Movie goers -- both of them -- who've never seen a Mafioso comedy will
probably find this picture funny.  Everyone else will leave wishing that
they had stayed at home and rented something like GOODFELLAS instead.</P>
<P>THE WHOLE NINE YARDS runs 1:39.  It is rated R for some violence,
nudity, sexual situations and language and would be acceptable for most
teenagers.</P>
