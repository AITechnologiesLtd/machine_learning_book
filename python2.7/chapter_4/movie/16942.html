<P>starring Robert DeNiro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow, Chazz Palminteri
screenplay by Peter Tolan, Harold Ramis, and Ken Lonergan
directed by Harold Ramis</P>
<P>Robert DeNiro is not a comedian. He used this to his advantage, in
what is arguably his best performance, as Rupert Pupkin in The King of
Comedy. In Scorsese's 1982 media-age satire, which becomes more
relevant with each passing year, Pupkin is a struggling comic obsessed
with talk show host Jerry Langford (a self-parodying Jerry Lewis) and
the thought of appearing on his program. Pupkin's routines, however,
are painfully unfunny-and he is blithely unaware of his own
mediocrity. That his jokes don't sound like they were written to bomb
(they're liked warmed over Henny Youngman one-liners that a Catskills
veteran could elicit a chuckle or two from) is because of DeNiro's
desperate delivery; the actor has awful timing in his bones. </P>
<P>As Paul Vitti, the head of a mafia family in Analyze This, DeNiro
sends up his Goodfellas and Casino characters mostly by playing it
straight: when plunked into veritable comedy, we realize just how
goofy the whole mobster attitude can be. Vitti is having anxiety
attacks over his station in life and an upcoming meeting with the
heads of all the families. He seeks counsel from Dr. Ben Sobol
(Crystal, redeeming himself in this post-City Slickers 2/Forget
Paris/Father's Day/My Giant era), a psychiatrist engaged to be married
to reporter Laura (Kudrow). Vitti, who is the movie equivalent of John
Gotti, panics Ben at first. Ben loosens up and agrees to help after he
realizes they share common neuroses over their fathers, but Vitti's
request that he be "cured" in two weeks naturally puts a wrench in
Ben's nuptials. </P>
<P>Analyze This takes more intelligent potshots at the gangster sub-genre
than, say, last year's Mafia!, but it doesn't attempt to mimic the
baroque visuals of The Godfather films or Once Upon A Time In America.
(One reason I so adore Mel Brooks' hilarious Young Frankenstein is
that it actually looks and feels like a Universal horror picture.)
Stuart Dryburgh's cinematography is full of missed
opportunities-Vitti's world should appear tantalizing, elegant,
and slightly foreboding to Ben. Even the Italian restaurant used in a
sequence that pays homage to the original Godfather looks like as
generic as the pizza parlour on TV's "Everybody Loves Raymond." </P>
<P>The film's screenplay has similar problems. The concept is so good, so
utterly "pitch-able," that someone else got there first: the film
bears remarkable resemblance to HBO's weekly smash "The Sopranos."
Unlike that show, Analyze This makes the mistake of anchoring its
whole story on an amusing but thin premise. It lacks meat on its
bones: that's why the film is half over before Dr. Sobol officially
agrees to take on his special patient; that's why there are not one
but two wedding sequences, both involving Ben and Laura (!); that's
why Chazz Palminteri's role consists mainly of shouting "I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch Vitti!" every few scenes. (He's a crashing bore
(er, boor)-Palminteri (Hurlyburly) is a good actor in dire need of new
schtick.) The movie really falls apart in its final third, because it
has relied on up to that point the surprisingly excellent chemistry
between Crystal and DeNiro to carry it through, and the climax has
Crystal flying solo in a flat and endless impersonation gag. Academy
Awards aside, Crystal is always funnier playing off an able co-star. </P>
<P>(Aside: the relationship between Crystal and his intelligent son sadly
remains mostly unexplored at the expense of plot; Kudrow, alas, is
also wasted in the "girlfriend" role she's too damn good for these
days.) </P>
<P>Yet I'll remember Analyze This as being a fun movie because of DeNiro
and Crystal's rapport. Crystal, who truly gives zingers their zing, is
granted genuinely witty comebacks to DeNiro's numerous threats. (One
can practically hear the ba-bum-ch! drumbeat after his one-liners.)
Surprisingly, they both begin the film playing caricatures but
end up flesh and blood protagonists. The film also features
outstanding supporting work from Joe Viterelli as Vitti's right hand
man Jelly. Lastly, though the script has its flaws, it's at least as
profane as the genuine mob movie article-"Larry Sanders" refugee Tolan
surely must have been the one who liberally peppered Analyze This with
"fucks." Hearing DeNiro use the word is old hat, but hearing Crystal
repeat the word is a scream. </P>
