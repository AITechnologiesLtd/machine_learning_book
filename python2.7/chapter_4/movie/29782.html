<PRE>Serendipity – Good Things Happen to Those who Wait 
by Homer Yen 
(c) 2001 </PRE>
<P>Did you ever make eye contact with a total stranger 
and feel that a mysterious connection had been 
established?  Do you think that fate has a funny way 
of bringing people together (or keeping them apart)? 
Do you believe in magic?  If you've answered "yes" to 
all of these questions, then you'll be happy to 
discover "Serendipity" at your local cineplex.  It's a 
delightful romantic comedy about two lovable people 
destined to be with each other. </P>
<P>When Jonathan (Jon Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsdale) 
first met, they had felt that mysterious connection. 
They first bumped into each in the days before 
Christmas.  With the holiday cheer wafting through the 
air, a lively Louis Armstrong soundtrack in the 
background, and their instant chemistry, audience 
members immediately want them to get under the 
mistletoe.  She writes down her name and number on a 
scrap of paper.  But as she hands it to him, a sudden 
wind carries it away.  Jonathan says to ignore that 
occurrence, but Sara says that it's a sign.  </P>
<P>Indeed, fate has a funny way of keeping people apart. 
To her, this means something.  Still, she's willing to 
give it one more chance, and writes her number inside 
the cover of a book.  Tomorrow she'll sell it, and 
maybe one day he'll find it somewhere at a local 
bookstore.  Meanwhile, she asks him to write his 
number on the back of a $5 bill.  She spends it but 
says that if things are meant to be, the bill will 
wind up in her hands again.  "How can you leave it all 
to chance," Jonathan asks incredulously?  "Have faith 
in destiny," she replies.  Sadly, the two separate and 
the chances of them ever finding each other are as 
likely as winning the Powerball. </P>
<P>Years later, we see Jonathan engaged.  But he still 
looks through used bookstores every now and then. 
Meanwhile Sara is also engaged.  Yet she occasionally 
flips through her wallet for $5 bills.  Even apart, 
these two exude undeniable romantic tension.  And, 
when both of them realize that they need to find each 
other, the audience (those who believe in romance and 
magic) is ready to follow them to the ends of the 
earth. </P>
<P>Fate begins to play funny tricks on these two as they 
begin an Agatha Christie-like pursuit for one another, 
tracking down years-old leads and falling back on gut 
feelings. They experience a series of cosmic 
coincidences, parallels, and agonizing near-misses. 
Maybe they are destined to be with each other…maybe 
not. </P>
<P>While this so-close-yet-so-far setup will strike a 
chord with the romantic-at-heart, most would still 
appreciate the film's other element about best 
friends.  When times are confusing, best friends help 
to provide light.  Sara's friend, down-to-earth Eve 
(Molly Shannon), tries to convince her that she's on a 
wild goose chase to find a stranger that she only met 
briefly.  Jonathan's friend, 
I'll-do-anything-in-the-name-of-love Dean (Jeremy 
Priven), encourages his friend because this element is 
missing from his relationship.  We can all relate to 
Eve and Dean; we all need more friends like them.  And 
we can enjoy this pleasant film because it makes us 
believe that there is someone out there for all of us. 
 Ain't the universe grand? </P>
