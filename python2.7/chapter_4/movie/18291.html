<P>THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN (M).  
(Columbia/Manadaly/Village Roadshow)
Director: Ulu Grosbard
Stars: Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams, Whoopi Goldberg, Jonathan 
Jackson, Ryan Merriman, John 
Kapelos, Cory Buck, Alexa Vega, Michael McGrady, Tony Musante
Running time: 108 minutes.</P>
<P>Writer Stephen Schiff (Lolita, the recent True Crime, etc) has
done a good job of adapting Jacquelyn Mitchard's best-selling novel
for the screen, and he turns the film into a compelling study of the
psychological damage a family can inflict upon itself under times of
great emotional stress.</P>
<P>The film opens in 1988, when photographer Beth Cappadora
(Michelle Pfeiffer) heads off to a school reunion in Chicago with her
three young children in tow.  In the hotel lobby though her son Ben
mysteriously disappears.  Despite an intense police search and
investigation, the boy is never found.</P>
<P>Nine years later, the family has got on with their lives,
although the tensions, guilt and doubts are still simmering away just
beneath the surface.  The Cappadoras have permanently moved to
Chicago, where Pat (Treat Williams, from The Prince Of The City, etc)
has opened a restaurant with his father and Beth has re-established
her career as a photographer.  Then one day a boy knocks on their
door, offering to cut their lawn.  Beth immediately recognises him as
Ben.</P>
<P>At first, The Deep End Of the Ocean's premise reads a little
like that of Olivier, Olivier, the 1993 French film in which a teenage
hustler tries to convince a family that he is their missing son.
However, in this solid and touching drama, the twist is the boy is
really the Cappadora's missing son.  Ben, or Sam as he is now known,
has been raised by his adoptive father George (John Kapelos), who was
unaware of his origins.</P>
<P>Sam's return brings with it a whole new set of complications,
and the emotional ripples further threaten the family.  Sam's presence
also begins the healing process between Beth and her strangely
disturbed teenage son Vincent (Jonathan Jackson, a star of tv soap
General Hospital), who is consumed by his own guilty secrets.</P>
<P>Another intriguing aspect of the film is the way in which the
characters have changed during the decade.  The only member of the
family who seems unaffected by these events is daughter Kerry (Alexa
Vega), who is given little screen time anyway.</P>
<P>Pfeiffer delivers an unusually strong and emotionally
demanding performance as Beth, who grows stronger and more confident
and controlled.  Jackson is excellent as Vincent, while Williams is
also surprisingly good as he portrays Pat's slow disintegration.
Whoopi Goldberg brings unusual restraint to her smaller role as a
sympathetic detective who befriends the Cappadora family.</P>
<P>Hailing from a theatrical background, Ulu Grosbard is a
director known for his solid character driven films (Straight Time,
Georgia, etc), and he brings a deep emotional resonance to this study
of a family in crisis.  He explores this emotionally complex and rich
material without becoming too manipulative, and keeps the mood
deliberately restrained and understated.  While Grosbard effectively
pushes a number of buttons, The Deep End Of The Ocean is never quite
the tear jerker that it could have been.</P>
