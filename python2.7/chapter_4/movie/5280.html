<P>     "Blaxploitation" heroes Fred Williamson, Jim Brown, and Pam Grier
reunite in ORIGINAL GANGSTAS, a rousing urban western about a trio of
former gang members in Gary, Indiana (homicide capital of the country)
who return to "take back the streets" after one of their sons is killed
in a drive-by.  Played mostly straight, O.G. is a rousing festival of
tough talk and vindictive violence.  Expect plenty of big words,
punctuated by cracked limbs, broken jaws, and crushed testicles.  (Not
to mention a few thousand or so rounds of automatic weapons fire.  Hey,
this is the nineties.) </P>
<P>     The film is engaging-- and, at times, inspirational-- for about an
hour, until the gun battles begin.  They go on forever.  Williamson,
Brown, and Grier look great these days and have a good chemistry
together.  Other familiar faces include Paul Winfield, Isabel Sanford,
Richard "Shaft" Roundtree, and Ron "Superfly" O'Neal.  (Lest we take
things *too* seriously, Wings Hauser is also on hand.  He plays an aide
to the mayor.) As much fun as this reunion is, the moral message behind
ORIGINAL GANGSTAS is rather dubious.  Too bad that director Larry Cohen
couldn't make a stronger statement on values.</P>
