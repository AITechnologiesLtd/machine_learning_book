<PRE>                              RED ROCK WEST
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1992) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        The only gimmick this movie has going for it is that it has 
more twists and turns than the Coney Island Cyclone. In RED 
ROCK WEST, the movie never moves in one direction for long, 
and you discover something new about each of the characters 
every few minutes that puts a complete spin on everything. It's 
musical chairs without the one person having to sit out after every 
round. No, everybody participates in everything here, and there 
are plot twists on a basis regular enough you could set your watch 
to it.</P>
<P>        At the beginning of the movie, Nicholas Cage, having just 
driven more than a thousand miles for a job he was immediately 
fired from, walks into a bar and is immediately offered a job by the 
owner (J.T. Walsh), who mistakes him for someone else. Cage 
expects some kind of busboy or bartender position but instead 
becomes Head Hitman as the owner gives him five thousand in 
cash and a gun, with instructions to kill his wife. Cage doesn't feel 
himself in a position to refuse, but soon finds himself warning the 
wife (Lara Flynn Boyle) of what's coming. The wife immediately 
turns around and gives him ten thousand to kill her husband.</P>
<P>        Cage soon comes to the conclusion that he is better off 
taking the money and running, but on his way out of town, he hits 
a pedestrain and has to turn around and take the guy to the hospital. 
(He may accept money for killing people, but that doesn't make him 
any less humanitarian.) At the hospital, he meets the town sheriff, 
who also owns the town bar. The sheriff is understandibly mad that 
his hitman was about to skip town, and takes him out to the woods, 
where he tries to hunt Cage down. But Cage makes it to a nearby 
road, where he is picked up by a visiting cowboy (Dennis Hopper), 
who is driving into town on business.</P>
<P>        The cowboy learns he and Cage are both ex-Marines and 
insists on buying a Cage a drink. So where do they go? J.T.'s bar, of 
course, where Hopper tells the bartender he needs to see the owner 
about a job he's late for. Cage puts one and one together and realizes 
Hopper is the hitman, which is about the same time J.T. walks in. It 
may seem like I've given the movie's entire plot away, but this all 
happens in the first twenty minutes. The back of the video box tells 
that much.</P>
<P>        RED ROCK WEST keeps the same pace for the next eighty 
minutes, through countless other twists and surprising character 
revelations, until it all ends in a graveyard where half a million 
dollars is buried. This is a decent action thriller, but it takes on a 
camp value with the overacting and unrelenting plot twists. You 
can't take the movie seriously for a second even though it seems like 
it wants to be. And after about an hour of endless manipulation on 
behalf of the writers, it gets completely tiresome.</P>
