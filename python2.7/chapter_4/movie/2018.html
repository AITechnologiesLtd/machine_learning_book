<PRE>                             ANOTHER STAKEOUT
                   A film review by David N. Butterworth
        Copyright 1993 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<PRE>     Picture the scene. </PRE>
<P>     A Hollywood production office--plush, swank, business-like.
Interior.  Day.</P>
<P>     Writer Jim Kouf is pitching his idea.  He draws an imaginary
theater marquee in the air and announces proudly, "STAKEOUT II.  It's
perfect.  Think.  It's six years later.  We'll pick up the story where
the first one left off.  We'll get Richard back, and Emilio.  And maybe
even John would be willing to direct again.  The thing'll write
itself."</P>
<P>     Producers Cathleen Summers and Lynn Bigelow look skeptical. </P>
<PRE>     "Is it supposed to be funny?" </PRE>
<P>     "Hell yes.  We'll stick Rosie O'Donnell in it.  Anything she
*does* is funny.  We'll blow up some real estate at the beginning and
blow away some people at the end to satisfy the action fans.  It'll be
something new, yet something familiar.  Audiences loved the first one.
It can't fail."</P>
<P>     The producers seem sold.  "Just one thing," says Bigelow.  "That
title.  It has to be punchier.  How about...  How about ANOTHER
STAKEOUT?" Kouf agrees.</P>
<PRE>     "Let's do it." </PRE>
<PRE>     And do it they did. </PRE>
<P>     ANOTHER STAKEOUT is the sequel to the 1987 film, STAKEOUT.
Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez reprise their roles as Chris Lecce
and Bill Reimers, two Seattle police detectives who once again pull the
worst assignment on the duty roster.  This time they are joined by
Assistant District Attorney Gina Garrett (Rosie O'Donnell), and the
three pose as an average American family in order to locate a key
witness in a Las Vegas mob trial who has gone underground.  It's a
dubious domestic arrangement at best, with Lecce as Dad, Garrett as
Mom, and Reimers as their grown son.</P>
<P>     A comic battle of wills ensues as this dysfunctional trio attempts
to play house whilst keeping an eye on the home of their unsuspecting
neighbors.</P>
<P>     What made the original STAKEOUT so popular was a combination of
two things.  First, the on-screen magnetism of its two male
leads--likable characters that shared a believable chemistry.
Secondly, a deft blend of comedy and real suspense contributed to
making the film a surprise hit.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately all those elements are missing from the sequel.
Because he assumes we know these two characters, writer Kouf never
takes the time to develop them, and they spend most of their time
mugging shamelessly to the camera.  There is very little tension, and
the film plays more like NATIONAL LAMPOON'S SEATTLE VACATION than a
comedy/drama about undercover cops.</P>
<P>     After a promising opening scene that is truly explosive, ANOTHER
STAKEOUT quickly deteriorates into childish physical humor and stilted
wisecracking.  Lecce battles a crook in a dumpster filled with rotting
vegetation and winds up with a mackerel in his gun holster.  Ha ha.
After having to shave off his moustache, Reimers whines about how he
has a special relationship with his facial hair.  Ho ho.  Garrett's
stupid-looking rottweiler chases a rabbit through the pine trees and
drags her after him.  Hee hee.  It's yuck-a-minute kind of stuff.</P>
<P>     Dennis Farina and Marcia Strassman play the O'Hara's, the couple
whose palatial family home is under surveillance.  They play things
pretty straight, but there is one hysterical scene in which they
attempt to leave a dinner party early.  Too bad it's the *only*
genuinely funny scene in the film.  Cathy Moriarty, who looks
strikingly like Faye Dunaway in this picture, plays Lu Delano, the key
witness in question.</P>
<P>     The film seems to have had its share of production problems.
Madeleine Stowe, who played the object of Richard Dreyfuss' desire in
the original film, has a fairly substantial part as Maria, but her
appearance is uncredited.  Then there's a scene with another neighbor,
Barbara Burnside (played by Sharon Maughan), involving a baseball and a
broken window that ends abruptly.  Her son Ronnie, presumably the
culprit (and a role attributed to Taylor Estevez in the closing
credits), never appears in the finished film.</P>
<P>     ANOTHER STAKEOUT is director John Badham's first sequel, and he
should have left well enough alone.</P>
