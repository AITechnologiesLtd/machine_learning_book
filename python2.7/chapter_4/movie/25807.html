<PRE>COYOTE UGLY</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: David McNally
Written by: Gina Wendkos</PRE>
<P>Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) has just reached an important decision. She's 
going to leave her small New Jersey town where she's lived her whole life, 
and move to New York city so she can become a song writer. Violet's father, 
Bill (John Goodman), is less than pleased by the idea, but wishes her luck. 
So Violet heads off, finding that the music industry isn't quite as easy to 
break into as she expected and winds up searching for a job. She hears about 
a bar called Coyote Ugly, where the waitresses pull in several hundred 
dollars a night. After speaking with the owner, Lil (Maria Bello), Violet 
gets a job working with the flirtatious Cammie (Izabella Miko); the 
practicing lawyer, Zoe (Tyra Banks); and Rachael (Bridget Moynahan), who 
hates Violet's guts from the start (for reasons which are never explained). 
Violet also meets a slightly goofy Australian, named Kevin O'Donnell (Adam 
Garcia), who she falls for immediately. Violet tries to fit in at the bar, 
working as a coyote, but at the same time all she wants to do is write her 
songs. The problem is, in order to get her songs published, she has to sing 
them herself, and she finds she has the worst case of stage-fright 
imaginable.</P>
<P>I know that plot summary may have sounded involved, but the film is 
basically two things: girls dancing on a bar top; and sappy, coming of age 
melodrama. One of the biggest problems with "Coyote Ugly" is that, like all 
teen movies of the past ten years, it is so bogged down by cliche after 
cliche that it saps any enjoyment out of the movie. It's hard to have fun at 
a movie when you know exactly how everything is going to turn out well in 
advance. In fact, the lack of any surprises is really the only thing holding 
"Coyote Ugly" back. It has a decent enough cast, a somewhat interesting 
premise, a soundtrack I'm sure some audience members will love (though I'm 
not one of them), and the sort of cheesy romance that teenagers fawn all 
over. Yet glancing around the audience at my showing, I noticed that most of 
the teenagers this movie was directed at seemed bored out of their minds. 
Granted, when the girls were dancing on the bar, the guys in the audience 
were at full attention; but between these scenes, when the action was away 
from the bar and the melodramatic elements set in, peoples' eyes seemed to 
become heavy (I know mine did) Chatter would start up amongst members of the 
audience until the action returned to the bar. So the breakdown is: girls in 
bar, movie is somewhat entertaining; girls out of bar, movie is a bore.</P>
<P>Piper Perabo, previously seen in the horrendous "The Adventures of Rocky and 
Bullwinkle", seems to have a bizarre dilemma facing her. In Bullwinkle she 
was just about the cutest actress I'd ever seen, but she seemed incapable of 
acting. In "Coyote Ugly" some of her cuteness seems to have vanished, but 
she managed to gain some acting talent. Maybe someday she'll reach an 
equilibrium. The supporting actresses, save Maria Bello, are never given 
enough screen time to make much of an impression. Maria Bello turns in an 
okay performance, but she was far more entertaining as Rosie in "Payback". 
Newcomer Adam Garcia, on the other hand, delivers quite a good comic turn as 
the requisite boyfriend from the big city. He actually seemed to possess 
quite a good sense of comic timing, and I hope a better future script will 
allow him to shine. Finally, we have the great John Goodman. Goodman has 
proven, time and again, that he is one of the best, most underrated comic 
actors working in Hollywood (see "The Big Lebowski" if you want proof). 
Whenever he's on screen in "Coyote Ugly" (which happens a lot less often 
than it should have), the movie shines. Whenever he's gone, you'll find 
yourself checking your watch, waiting for him to come back (either that or 
checking it, waiting for the movie to end. I always get those two confused).</P>
<P>As I sat and watched the girls' activities in the bar, several questions 
continuously ran through my mind. First, and perhaps most important, how do 
these girls serve anyone when they seem to do nothing but dance on the bar 
and humiliate the customers? Second, is this actually the kind of place that 
would be popular? Don't get me wrong, watching the girls dance is nice, but 
they also do things like spray water in peoples' faces, cut peoples' hair 
off, knock the occasional customer out, and other humiliating activities. 
Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't want to hang out there. Third, how can 
they afford to stay open when more alcohol seemed to end up on the bar, on 
the girls, or on the customers, than was actually paid for. Finally, how 
could this bar be allowed to stay open when there were constant brawls 
breaking out, fires being lit in a building filled with alcohol, and far too 
many people inside for it to be considered safe by public officials (such as 
the cops and fire marshals who stop by). These types of plot inconsistencies 
probably won't bother everyone, but they sure grated on my nerves.</P>
<P>Obviously, one of the primary elements to "Coyote Ugly" is going to be the 
music, since the film purports itself to be about girls dancing. While the 
music wasn't to my liking, being comprised entirely of popular songs by 
people like LeAnn Rimes. I prefer my music more like the kind found in 
"Gladiator", but that wouldn't have been quite appropriate to this film. 
Still, the audience seemed to be enjoying the soundtrack (though they could 
have just been enjoying watching the girls dance), and I'm ashamed to admit 
that I caught my foot tapping at one point near the finale. By the way, what 
are the odds of "I Will Survive" being a major song in two movies released 
within a week of each other? Weird, huh? One thing I was most worried about 
after seeing the previews was the movie's dialogue. Thankfully the dialogue 
was bad ("So what do you do when you realize all your dreams have come 
true?" ouch), but usually not painfully so (for painful dialogue, see "The 
Perfect Storm"). There's an "R" rating hiding behind the "PG-13" stamped on 
the front of "Coyote Ugly", but Jerry Bruckheimer keeps things carefully 
restrained, most likely so as not to lose any audience that can't attend an 
"R" rated film (not that that stopped anyone from going to the stupid "Scary 
Movie"). "Coyote Ugly" runs 100 minutes, but it shouldn't have been any 
longer than 90. I'd recommend the film to fans of teen movies and give it a 
slightly generous three out of five stars.</P>
