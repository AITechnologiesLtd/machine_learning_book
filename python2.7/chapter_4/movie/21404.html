<P>More of a soft-core porno than a sci-fi thriller, Species II fails to
live up to its predecessor in terms of story, direction or amount of
nudity.  And let's face it, the bar wasn't really set that high to begin
with.  Errr…except for the latter.</P>
<P>The whole idea of the story is so implausible that it makes David Lynch
easy to understand.  It seems that the government has recreated the
alien from the first film – the one that they destroyed – in an attempt
to evaluate potential vulnerabilities on the off chance that they ever
choose to attack Earth.  This time, she's called Eve (Natasha
Henstridge, Maximum Risk) and is isolated in a high security lab far
away from the men that she needs to procreate.  This babe gets all moist
when she sees Michael Madsen, so you know she's just aching for it.
Like Banky says in Chasing Amy, `Chicks need dick.  I mean, they just
plain NEED it' and Eve is certainly no exception.</P>
<P>The dick is Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard), the astronaut son of a
successful Senator (James Cromwell, Babe).  We are introduced to Patrick
as he becomes the first man to walk on Mars, in a mission to collect
dirt from the red planet.  Why a three-man crew needed to do this, I
will never know.</P>
<P>In this dirt is some very unfriendly space goo that thaws and runs about
the floor of the spacecraft.  As it reaches the unsuspecting trio, they
suddenly lose about eight minutes of time.  This is fine with me because
it's eight less minutes that I have to suffer through on the screen.</P>
<P>Did I mention that the ship is plastered with advertisements for various
companies that really exist?  I was relieved to find out that Microsoft
doesn't take over the world in the future, but my contentment was short
lived because I think that Species II actually takes place in the
present.  My evidence is twofold – the presence of a Bill Clinton photo
behind Senator Ross' desk and the Clinton-esque Richard Belzer
portraying the leader of the free world.</P>
<P>Anyway, the space goo gets all into Patrick's head and somehow turns him
into an alien.  This means that every time he bangs some girl, she
becomes instantly pregnant and gives violent bloody birth in a just a
few minutes.  Since Patrick is a national hero, he's getting all kinds
of hot action - including two sisters - and soon has a whole pack of
creepy Village of the Damned type kids following him around.  In other
news, Patrick's blood can also morph into an alien.  I don't even know
what this means.</P>
<P>The government, led by fathead Marilyn Manson twin Colonel Carter
Burgess (George Dzundza, Basic Instinct), hires the fathead who helped
save the planet in the first picture, Press Lennox (Madsen, Reservoir
Dogs).  Together, they track down Patrick and find an unlikely ally in
sickle-cell anemia.  Now that's a strange twist.</P>
<P>On a positive note, Species II is mercifully short and boasts a
collection of at least five pairs of naked breasts.  It is the latter,
not the former, that results in the PLANET SICK-BOY rating.</P>
