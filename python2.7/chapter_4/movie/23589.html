<PRE>                              THE OPERATOR
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Exhibit A in why you shouldn't be rude to telemarketers, no matter
your mood.</P>
<P>     Indie flick THE OPERATOR is a hybrid black comedy/Hitchcock
thriller about a real cad named Gary (Michael Laurence) -- a lawyer,
quite naturally -- who "reaps what he sows" after telling off a vengeful
telephone operator.  Gary cheats on his wife (and his mistress),
gambles, spends the savings on a fancy car, and represents dirtbags at
the office.  When the stress of his life gets too much to bear, he lets
a poor Ma Ball employee we known only as Shiva (Jacqueline Kim) take the
brunt of his wrath, which she turns back upon him in spades.</P>
<P>     Soon enough, thanks to the apparently unchecked power of the phone
company, Gary is out of the house, his credit cards are cancelled, and
he appears to be headed for unemployment.  The bulk of the movie
consists of Gary trying to ferret out his tormenter and coming to terms
with the notion of karma.</P>
<P>     In this regard, THE OPERATOR has some of its best moments, and
newcomer Laurence shows some excellent dramatic range as he eventually
welcomes the pain being visited upon him.  Set in Dallas,
writer/director Jon Dichter (who introduced his film at South by
Southwest) repeatedly called THE OPERATOR a "quintessential Texas
movie."  I'm not sure it speaks to the common fears of most of Texas,
though most of the characters do sport southern accents (although "Drew
Carey" star Christa Miller's is pretty over the top).</P>
<P>     In the end, THE OPERATOR is a pretty good time, especially
considering its obvious budget constraints.  My only real beef is with
the whole idea.  I pray to god the phone operators can't really transfer
funds from my account, charge things to my credit cards, and get my car
repossessed.  Hell, I doubt they can balance their checkbooks.</P>
