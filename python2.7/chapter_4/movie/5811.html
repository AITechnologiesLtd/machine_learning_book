<PRE>                                 PINOCCHIO
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<P>     After seeing the new live action Pinocchio movie, THE ADVENTURES
OF PINOCCHIO to which I gave ***, we decided to watch the Disney
original 1940 classic animated movie PINOCCHIO since it is the
reference standard.  Directors Hamilton Luske and Ben Sharpsteen's 1940
PINOCCHIO is wonderful - full of beauty and tragedy.  The writers
(Aurelius Battaglia, William Cottrell, Otto Englander, Erdman Penner,
Joseph Sabo, Ted Sears, and Webb Smith using Carlo Collodi's book)
fashion a morality tale that describes horrible results for any boy who
strays from the straight and narrow.</P>
<P>     The short version of the story is that a puppet maker named
Geppeto (voice by Christian Rub) creates a puppet called Pinocchio
(voice by Dick Jones).  He wishes Pinocchio could come alive and his
wish is granted by The Blue Fairy (voice by Evelyn Venable).  The Blue
Fairy assigns the role of Pinocchio's conscience to Jiminy Cricket
(voice by Cliff Edwards).  Pinocchio goes to work for the evil
Stromboli (voice by Charles Judels) and generally gets into a lot of
trouble in the show.</P>
<P>     The moral lessons come fast and furious.  The Blue Fairy tells
Pinocchio, "Remember: Always let your conscience be your guide."  This,
of course, has a double meaning given that she has delegated that role
to Jiminy Cricket.  She promises Pinocchio that he can be a real boy
and not just a live puppet if he is good.  The carrot.  He also finds
that when he lies, his nose grows so long that leaves, flowers, bird's
nests, and birds grow on it.  The stick.  She admonishes him that "a
lie keeps growing and growing until it's as clear as the nose on your
face."</P>
<P>     Unlike the remake, the original is much darker and more
frightening.  Stromboli is extremely sinister.  He calls Pinocchio his
"little wooden gold mine" and throws him into a bird cage when he
doesn't obey.  If the thought of some diabolical man bend on locking
them up doesn't scare little kids, not much will.  The show has more
insidious characters like Honest John.  Overall, the movie is a panoply
of the inherent horrors of childhood and much more so than the remake,
the 1940 original does not pull any punches in illustrating the
consequences of immorality.</P>
<P>     The piece de resistance is Pleasure Island.  There the boys get to
smoke cigars, destroy model homes, play pool and drink beer.  The
consequences of this degeneracy are near fatal as Pinocchio soon
learns.  All and all, this is a troubling but extremely well crafted
film.  In typical stereotyping, notice how the quintessential bad kid,
Lampwick (voice by Frankie Darro), has a Brooklyn accent.  Reminds me
of how movies, even today, stereotype people with Southern accents like
mine as being poor and stupid.</P>
<P>     There is so much more right with the movie that it is hard to know
what all to include.  Just the infectiously happy and uplifting voice
of Jiminy Cricket is certainly worth a mention.  The animators (lead by
Shamus Culhane) use a simple style in the drawings.  Most scenes have
little detailing and yet, the colors of the warm browns remind us of
the wooded nature of the protagonist and the warmth suggest that
redemption is his for the taking.</P>
<P>     The music (Leigh Harline, Paul Smith and Ned Washington) is
soothing, dreamy, and nostalgic.  The songs are all memorable and
great.  My favorites are "Give a little whistle," "When you wish upon a
star," and "An actor's life for me."</P>
<P>     I have only one major criticism of the film.  The whole Monstro
sequence runs way too long, especially the search for the whale.  If
they wanted to make the film longer, they could have added more in the
front part.  Finally, I must be honest.  As much as I like the
character of Pinocchio in this movie, I liked the character in the
remake better.  His movements are more interesting and the way he deals
with some of the situations more imaginative.  On whole, however, the
remake is not near as good as the original.  The main problem with the
remake is that they downplay the morality issue which is the heart of
the story.</P>
<P>     PINOCCHIO runs 1:28.  It is rated G, but little kids may be
frightened by the caging, the whale, and many of the darker images.  I
always include Jeffrey's (age 7) mini-review in my review.  I forget
this on the remake, THE ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO.  He loved it and gave
it two thumbs up.  For reasons, which he was not able to articulate, he
liked it better than the original PINOCCHIO to which he gave only one
thumbs up.  Go figure.  Personally, I give my strongest recommendation
to PINOCCHIO and rate it a full ****.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
