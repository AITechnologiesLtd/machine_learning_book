<P>Susan Granger's review of "HOLIDAY HEART" (Showtime/MGM TV Entertainment)</P>
<P> Don't let the subject matter discourage you from watching
Ving Rhames ("Mission Impossible 2") deliver an Emmy-caliber
performance in this unusual, made-for-television movie about an aging
drag queen who helps a young girl and her mother discover the true
meaning of family. The story begins as Holiday Heart (Ving Rhames), a
night club performer/choir director, mourns the death of his longtime
lover, a highly respected member of the Chicago police force. One
night, en route to a costume party, he's begged by a 12 year-old named
Nikki (Jessika Quynn Reynolds), to help Wanda, her battered,
drug-addicted mother (Alfre Woddard), and discovers two people who are
desperately in need of his love and attention. Generously, he moves
them into an empty apartment in his duplex and an unusual, but
effective, family unit develops. But their temporary tranquillity is
shattered when a flashy drug dealer (Mykelti Williamson) entices
Wanda, who sort of fantasizes herself as Mary J. Blige, into using
again. What makes this Tribeca Production (Robert DeNiro's company)
rise above its inherent melodrama is Robert Townsend's perceptive
direction of Cheryl L. West's well-written, touching, unpredictable
script, based on her play which had its New York premiere at the
Manhattan Theater Club - and Ving Rhames' amazing, poignant portrayal
of a strong, loving man who, despite overwhelming odds, is at peace
with himself. On the Granger Made-for-Television Movie Gauge, "Holiday
Heart" is a risky, intriguing 8, rising far above the usual network
fare. Rated TV-14, "Holiday Heart" premieres on Showtime TV on Sunday,
Dec. 10, at 8 PM with additional playdates on Dec. 13 at 8 PM and
Dec. 23 at 5:45 PM. It's truly worth jotting down these dates and
times on your TV calendar.</P>
