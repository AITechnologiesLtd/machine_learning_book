<PRE>                                  THE SAINT
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>[REVIEWS TAKE A NEW, SHORTER FORMAT BEGINNING WITH 'THE SAINT']</P>
<P>     The Next Big Franchise hits theaters this Friday, with all the
trappings of a sequel-destined event.  Infused with a backstory to set
up the past of its nameless hero (Val Kilmer) as something of a "rogue
James Bond with a guilty conscience and a Volvo," THE SAINT is as
improbable as it is entertaining.  With a plot revolving around a
successful cold fusion experiment developed by miniskirt-clad scientist
Emma (Elizabeth Shue) and the Russian Mafia's enlisting of the Saint to
"steal the formula," it would be easy to sit back and laugh at the
film's goofiness.  However, Kilmer comes off as so engrossing and
delivers his wryly hilarious lines with such precision that you end up
forgetting the bad techno soundtrack and the series of unlikely
coincidences that drive the picture to its inevitable end.  And while
that obviously-altered-to-make-it-happy ending is truly annoying, it's
THE SAINT's combination of action and comedy that make it a worthwhile
trip.</P>
