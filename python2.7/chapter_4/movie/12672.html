<P>When Bulworth ended, I allowed myself a sigh of relief:  it is possible
for me to enjoy political satire.  There have been several recent
political films that didn't do a whole lot for me -- Wag the Dog, for
instance, I found to be an intelligent but heartless film, while Primary
Colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness.  Bulworth is a
far better film than these, both in its execution and lasting
impression.  It's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture, but it
also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star Warren Beatty
allows the audience to identify with his character, and, in turn, we
like him and actually care about the story.   </P>
<P>Beatty plays incumbent Democratic Senator Jay Billington Bulworth; the
film opens and we see Bulworth sobbing as he watches his television
spots over and over again.  He hasn't slept in days, nor has he eaten,
and, almost instantaneously, he goes insane.   He's not stark raving mad
(not outright, anyway), but he's definitely bonkers.   It's the final
weekend of his campaign, and his assistant, Murphy (Oliver Platt) has
written him a speech to feed to a group of Black people in a church in
the ghetto.   Bulworth begins the speech, but suddenly goes off track
and just starts being honest.  "You mean," one lady asks, "the
Democratic party doesn't care about the African American community?" 
"Well," he shouts, laughing, "isn't that obvious?"</P>
<P>The story is propelled by a device in which Bulworth puts out a
contract on his own life (he muses later that it's a bad thing to make
decisions when you're suicidal); he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses
(Graham Beckel) whom he believes to be the hitman.   Bulworth also meets
Nina (Halle Berry) with whom he becomes infatuated.   Suddenly, in the
short span of this weekend, Bulworth's no-nonsense "truth in politics"
methods become a national sensation, and he shoots ahead in the polls
despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes
and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences.</P>
<P>Beatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent.  His script and
direction are both extremely sharp, as is the surprisingly strong
characterization of Bulworth himself.  Here is a man who's reached his
limit, and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire
political structure.  I like that the film doesn't take a clear shot at
any of the political parties or affiliations, but at politics in general
and how everything is run by the rich (although the anti-rich sentiments
do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film).  Some of the segments are
simply hilarious, such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon
dedicated to him.  </P>
<P>Much of the film is completely absurd, but that's the fun part about
it.  It's an angry, serious film at the core, but the package that
Beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in
the genre.  What adds to this feeling is Beatty's portrayal of Bulworth;
this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale.  
Beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he's always funny, but he's also
subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely
noticeable actions.   Beatty is so good that Bulworth, despite his
shortcomings as a human being, is an entirely sympathetic and likable
character almost from the beginning.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is vast and colorful.  Berry is luminous, as
always, and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles.  Don
Cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to
do his dirty work.  Oliver Platt is an actor who should be careful, for
someday I fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his
acting (though he's very funny to watch).  Paul Sorvino adds the
Southern accent to his list of mastered inflections.</P>
<P>Is Bulworth offensive?  I suppose some may see it that way.  I wasn't
offended by the film, but then again, I hardly care about politics.  I
think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided
by the honesty of the story.  The film isn't perfect, of course -- the
ending didn't quite work for me, and the a few of the scenes between
Bulworth and Nina feel forced (although the eclectic dance sequence is
fantastic).  But these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant
film.  Bulworth is a smart, uproariously funny picture that proves to me
that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface.  </P>
