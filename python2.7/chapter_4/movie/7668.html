<P>The Lost World: Jurassic Park gives the distinct impression of
being part sequel and part remake. I think it is largely
disappointing in either respect, although it does noticeably
worse as a sequel than as a remake. Let me explain. </P>
<P>There are, of course, no fixed criteria according to which a
movie constitutes a good sequel to another one, but TLW does
meet the minimal requirements. Many of the same characters
(or their equivalents) from Jurassic Park return to face the
results of that film. But aside from story continuity, one might
expect a sequel to develop some of the themes raised in the
original, or introduce some new ones. Any such development
in TLW is purely incidental. In the original JP, the dinosaurs
of Isla Nublar served both as a cautionary example of the results
of greed and crass commercialism, and as reminders of how to
lead a life in accord with the dictates of nature. The result was
not really a convincing lesson so much as a warm, fuzzy
feeling, but at least these themes were used aptly to tie the
narrative together into a coherent whole. In TLW, Spielberg
picks up these themes again, but in a purely repetitive way. The
crass commercialism has been transfered from John Hammond
to his shifty nephew Arliss Ludlow, while the exposure of
nurturing talents is transferred from Dr.s Grant and Sattler to
the dinosaurs themselves (most notably the T-rex) which have
been running loose on Isla Sorna (Site B) the whole time. Dr.
Malcolm makes a return visit, and some attempt is made to
explore the nurturing side of his nature, but this element drops
out abruptly around the middle of the movie, after his daughter
drop kicks a Velociraptor (shades of Gymkata)! Of course, no
one expects much themewise from a big budget, effects picture,
but the attempts made in this picture are notably haphazard and
half-hearted. Sequels don't have to be played from the same
hand as their predecessors; something more original would
have almost certainly been an improvement. </P>
<P>In other respects, TLW works best where it almost constitutes
a remake of the original. The first act of the movie revisits
much of the look and feel (and story - with some insertions
from the original novel) of JP and seems to land Spielberg in
his element, with the result that he recreates much of JP's
suspense and excitement. The timing, direction, and special
effects were generally very good and fastened all eyes on the
screen. (The sound was a bit of a drawback - more on that later.)
Spielberg clearly realized that he could not draw out the
exposure of the audience to the dinosaurs as much as in JP, so
he switched to presenting more dinosaurs doing more things -
good move. Scenes were smoothly and deftly linked by simple
but effective use of visual continuities, and the frequent facial
closeups made the events more involving than they might
otherwise have been (although this last technique started to
look mechanical later in the film). This first part of the picture
works well at the level of an amusement park ride (in fact, I
believe the Universal Studios ride based on TLW is already up
and running), with the humans going from chasing the
dinosaurs to being chased by them. Lots of suspense, some
action, no drama. Ok. </P>
<P>But with the exit from Isla Sorna, the movie completely
changes tone and coasts home. Roland Tembo, the big game
hunter who leads Ludlow's dinosaur salvage operation, bows
out; a shame, as he was the most interesting and best rendered
character in the film. Two live T-rex (a juvenile and its parent)
are shipped to San Diego to be part of a glorified carnival
exhibit. Suspense goes out the window in favor of a comic
carnivorous romp through various neighborhoods of San
Diego. The comedy works at a superficial level: The audience
recognized and laughed at the car crashes, the fleeing humans,
and the numerous little movie in-jokes. In the first half, people
were marked for death due to their moral failures; now they die
for a quick laugh. This aspect of the TLW is the biggest
letdown compared with JP. In JP the comedy was subtler and
fundamental to the development of the plot, whereas here it is
manufactured and attached with duct tape. But even without
considering JP, the second act of TLW succeeds perhaps too
well as a burlesque of the first act, and inadvertently plants the
suggestion that TLW is just like any generic B movie, but
distinguished by a monster budget. </P>
<P>As a sideline, I should add that I saw TLW in a cineplex
without the DTS sound system. Unfortunately, it appears that
Spielberg is distributing the movie in only this sound format,
with the result that the sound as I got it lacked some depth. In
an effects picture, this is an important consideration.
Moviegoers should either seek out cinemas with the DTS
system, or take umbrage at this odd (grasping?) commercial
tactic and avoid TLW altogether. </P>
<P>Anyway, although TLW features lots of technically excellent
effects and direction, it also features a story that lacks basic
coherence and eventually even undercuts itself. TLW does
best where it recreates the sense of menace and spectacle from
JP, but fails as its attempts at independent development simply
turn into diversions. </P>
