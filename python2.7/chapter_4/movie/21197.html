<P>Rob Reiner's "The Story of Us," the new comedy-drama about the highs and lows 
of a couple's rocky 15-year marriage, is a film that gets so many of the 
details exactly right, that it comes as a disappointment to find that the 
denouement arrives about twenty minutes too early, apparently due to either 
numerous cuts made prior to its release, or a promising, if uneven, script 
that wasn't ready to be put onto film. The talent is all in place, it seems, 
but its snappily-paced structure in which it goes back-and-forth in time only 
causes the proceedings to feel episodic and strangely disjointed.</P>
<P>Ben (Bruce Willis) and Katie Jordan (Michelle Pfeiffer) have been married 
fifteen years, and to most, give off the appearance of being gloriously happy 
with each other. At dinner with their children, 10-year-old Erin (Colleen 
Rennison) and 12-year-old Josh (Jake Sandvig), each night, they like to play 
a game called High/Low, in which they go around the room and each family 
member must state their highest and lowest point of that particular day. Once 
alone, however, Ben and Katie's exteriors transform from marital bliss to 
their plans on what they are going to do when the kids leave for summer camp 
the following day--they will leave together, for the children, but Ben is 
then going to start packing up some clothes for his stay at a nearby hotel, 
without Katie. Once separated by everything but the telephone (they construct 
artificial excuses just to call up each other because they do secretly long 
to be together again), both sides of the progressively-drifting-apart couple 
reminisce about what their life has been like since they first met each 
other. Will they realize that fifteen years is simply too much time for them 
to throw their relationship away, or will they come to terms with the fact 
that they'll most likely be better off apart? I'll leave the particulars of 
the answer to this question up to the viewer to discover, but let's put it 
this way--had the more subtle, skilled Woody Allen have made the picture 
(and, for the most part, it really is reminiscent of his work), the outcome 
probably would have been a little different.</P>
<P>As it should be, the two people that are front-and-center for the entirety of 
the brief 96-minute running time are Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer, both 
of whom have never been better (aside from Pfeiffer's marvelous role as 
Catwoman in 1992's "Batman Returns"). Willis, usually burdened by an 
unknowing smirk plastered upon his face, throws the majority of his usual 
acting mannerisms to the wind to create a character we have never seen him 
play before, and his performance here--and it hits all of the right notes, 
mind you--is even superior to his delicately poignant turn in the recent 
box-office smash, "The Sixth Sense."    </P>
<P>Michelle Pfeiffer, an engaging actress who, nonetheless, makes frequent 
missteps in her film choices (just take a look at her work in the otherwise 
mediocre 1999 drama, "The Deep End of the Ocean," and 1997's painfully 
overwrought "A Thousand Acres"), is Willis' match in every way. Bringing off 
an astute believability to the premise, Pfeiffer, more than even Willis, 
makes her character someone who creditably appears to be longing for a 
reconciliation with the man whom she still loves deeply. And her final, 
tearful monologue is a real winner, evoking the distinct feelings of joy, 
pain, sentimentality, and frustration that, no doubt, comes with any close 
marriage. Despite being instructed to scream at one another a few too many 
times for my taste, the marital woes of Ben and Katie are effectively and 
realistically brought to life, as we find ourselves truly caring about what 
happens to them. </P>
<P>It's not so much that there is anything distinctly wrong with what appears in 
the finished product of "The Story of Us," as there is merely a sensation 
floating overhead that tells me the film could have been remarkably better 
had the screenplay, by Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson, been more 
fully-written. The flashback-laden construction of the plotting is 
smoothly-done, but for it to really work to its fullest potential, the film 
calls for itself to be of epic proportions, a motion picture about the truths 
of marriage and love/hate relationships, similar to Ingmar Bergman's 1973 
drama, "Scenes from a Marriage." As is, there are many on-target moments that 
hold just the right tone, while several montages are included to rush us 
through protracted periods of time. The problem is, the montages seem like 
nothing but advertisements for the actual film, and, I swear to you, one 
montage late in the picture is almost exactly like the theatrical trailer, 
with even the same music score, by Eric Clapton, in the background.  </P>
<P>The supporting cast is chock-full of recognizable thesps that are 
unfortunately all wasted. Rob Reiner and Paul Reiser briefly appear as Ben's 
friends, and ditto for Rita Wilson and the severely underrated Julie Hagerty 
as Katie's. Tim Matheson has nothing to do but play the potential guy that 
Katie is considering having an affair with, and there is no attempt to turn 
him into anything more than a one-dimensional figure whose purprose is to 
cause a conflict. Really, the only supporting performance that is worth 
noting is that of Colleen Rennison as Erin, Ben and Katie's young daughter. 
The 12-year-old Rennison (last seen in a pair of 1996 bombs, "Carpool" and 
"Unforgettable") proves to be a naturally-gifted actress who is touching as a 
girl who suspects something is wrong with her parents, but hopes only for the 
best.</P>
<P>In its depiction of a marriage on the rocks, "The Story of Us" is successful 
in its ideas, but not necessarily in its treatment. There are many wonderful 
moments, including an interlude midway through in which Katie and Ben decide 
to take a trip to Venice in an attempt to rekindle their flames, and a 
particular scene that shows them dancing along the water is simply magical. 
Its major fall, however, comes in its generally crowd-pleasing conclusion 
that, to be sure, leaves things on an uplifting note, but feels like a cheat 
when considering the validity of the situations that had come before. It has 
been widely reported that Willis filmed this movie around the same time his 
own marriage with actress Demi Moore was coming to an end. Perhaps in staying 
with the film's truthfulness, Willis should have suggested a less-neat finale 
that remained faithful to its characters and their plight, without going into 
what could basically be described as fantasy territory. </P>
