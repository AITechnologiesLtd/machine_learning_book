<PRE>                            NEVER, AGAIN, FOREVER
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     NEVER, AGAIN, FOREVER is a feature length documentary about the
Jewish Defense League (JDL).  I saw it as part of San Jose's Cinequest
film festival.  [The punctuation of the film's title is a bit strange,
but that is what is printed in the official program.]</P>
<P>     I love documentaries, and I am fairly flexible about their content
and composition.  I do however have certain minimal standards.  I
expect a documentary to be more than just a collection of film stock,
and although I do not count on a big budget look, I do want a picture
that it is clear and bright enough to be visible.  NEVER, AGAIN,
FOREVER fails both of these tests.</P>
<P>     In any documentary, even mediocre ones like this one, there are
some interesting moments.  I did learn that at least some people in the
JDL are obsessed with hate.  One woman quotes the slain Meir Kahane as
saying, "You have to hate first before you can love."  Whether he
actually said this or not, is open to question.  In fact, the whole
documentary is so one-sided that I began not to believe anything in it.
It may all be true, but documentarians Danae Elon and Pierre Chainet,
by sticking to a single theme and approach, caused their whole thesis
to be laid open to question.</P>
<P>     The technical aspects of the picture are abysmal.  The film is
sometimes out of focus, but more often there is not enough light to see
the subject.  Many interviews are done in a car with the bright lights
of the background causing the iris of the lens to close down.  This
meant we had to watch a talking shadow.  Only when another car would go
by and block the sun would we get a glimpse of the subject.  When you
realize that you could have done a much better job with the camera than
the camera operator, you know a picture is in trouble.</P>
<P>     The director appears never to have storyboarded what he wanted to
do with the film he had shot.  The editing seems almost random.</P>
<P>     I left the NEVER, AGAIN, FOREVER more confused than when I went
in.  Documentaries should enlighten and involve the audience.  This one
did neither.</P>
<P>     NEVER, AGAIN, FOREVER runs 58 minutes.  The film is not rated.
Although the subject is potentially quite interesting, I do not find
this documentary worth recommending.  I give it a single *.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
