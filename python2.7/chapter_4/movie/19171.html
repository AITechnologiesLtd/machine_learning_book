<P>        I expected South Park:  Bigger, Longer, & Uncut to be offensive,
raunchy, and extremely funny, but I didn't expect it to be as
intelligently satirical as it is.  I can honestly say that no movie has
ever made me laugh harder than this one.  While walking out of the
theater, my friend, who is a South Park fan, told me that I probably got
more out of it not being familiar with the series (I've only seen one
episode).  Perhaps that's true; I was certainly laughing louder than
anyone in the audience.  And often I couldn't believe what I was
laughing at.</P>
<P>        The story has our four young heroes learning an assortment of
expletives from a Canadian movie; naturally, this leads to a heated
anti-Canadian climate, and a vicious war against them into which Satan
intervenes.  Created almost entirely by comic geniuses Trey Parker and
Matt Stone, the film attacks everything it can, including the MPAA, the
U.S. Military, social intolerance, small-town mentality, and Bill
Gates.  South Park overflows with profanities used in ways most of us
have probably never heard.  </P>
<P>        The film is so biting, so amazingly funny (I could *not* stop laughing
after the general shoots Bill Gates), that it comes as an immense
disappointment that the last twenty minutes are so bland.  Parker and
Stone focus too much on a strange homosexual relationship between Saddam
Hussein and Satan, and don't find the funniest way to end their film. 
But it's still a quick 80-minutes -- 80 of the funniest and most
culturally in-tune minutes I've ever sat through.  </P>
