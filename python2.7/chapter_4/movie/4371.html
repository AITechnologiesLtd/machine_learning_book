<PRE>                           SENSE AND SENSIBILITY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     On first hearing about SENSES AND SENSIBILITY, written by Jane
Austen 200 years ago, (her first novel), the screenplay by Emma
Thompson (her first screenplay) and directed by the Taiwanese Ang Lee
(THE WEDDING BANQUET, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN), one could not help but
wonder what the film might turn out to be.  Put away your fears.  The
combination, along with some fine acting, has emerged as probably the
best film of the year.</P>
<P>     Lots of things have changed in 200 years.  They had no cars, no
TV, etc., and their lifestyles were very much different than is ours
today.  But emotions have not had a metamorphosis.  Then, as now,
there were good people and bad, the selfish and the generous, and
through it all was "love" and desire and decorum.</P>
<P>     SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is essentially about two sisters and the men
they desired and those who wanted the sisters to be their wife.  That
was not as easy as it sounds.  Money and station in life are here looked
upon very carefully by both the sisters, the men, the parents.</P>
<P>     All of this is carefully laid out in a complex but orderly
fashion.  Thompson wisely stuck as closely to Austen's book as film-
making would allow and, with a fine director, we have a masterpiece.</P>
<P>     Very briefly, the story is that the law in England at that time
said that the estate of the father went to his son.  When the father,
Henry Dashwood, (Tom Wilkinson) was dying he told his son by his first
wife.  John (James Fleet), how he wanted the estate handled.  The elder
Dashwood had been married before.  By his second wife, (Gemma Jones),
he had three daughters.  From John, he extracted the promise that the
widow and her three daughters would be well taken care of but it was
not long before John's wife, Fanny (Harriet Walter) began, after the
death of her father-in-law, to minimize the amount John had been
intending to give the widow and daughters, and helped to make their
life miserable.</P>
<P>     At the first opportunity, the widow and her children, with little
money of their own, moved away but before that happened, the eldest
daughter, Elinor, (Emma Thompson) had fallen in love with Fanny's
brother, Edward (Hugh Grant).  While it seemed as if they were
engaged, when Elinor moved with her mother and sisters, the expected
visits from Edward did not occur.  Elinor was hurt but took things as
well as she could.  The film's other love story is that of the younger
sister, Marianne (Kate Winslett) and the several men who fell in love
with her.</P>
<P>     Faithful to the period in every respect, the movie depicts the
lives, the yearnings of the people involved.  How far does one go in
declaring one's love?   Is a man 35-years-old too decrepit to marry a
27-year-old?   Is a woman in her late twenties "over the hill?"  These
and many other questions are encountered and resolved in a most
proficient manner, aided by such fine actors as Alan Rickman, Robert
Hardy, Elizabeth Spriggs, and Emile Franois and others.  All have
important roles and all do well by them.</P>
<PRE>     This is a film you absolutely must see.</PRE>
