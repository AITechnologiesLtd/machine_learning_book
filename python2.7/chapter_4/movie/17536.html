<PRE>[3.0/4.0]</PRE>
<P>Rushmore Academy is a prestigious private school and is also the main
passion of one of its worst students, Max Fischer. The reason Max is a bad
student is not because he lacks intelligence or because he cannot apply
himself. Rather, it is because he has devoted all of his energy in
participating in a multitude of extracurricular activities to the extent
that his grades are sagging. Max's most focused talent is as a playwright,
and it was his proficiency with drama at a young age that was the basis for
his admittance to Rushmore, not wealth like most of the other students. Just
as Max is being threatened with expulsion unless his academic performance
improves, he meets Rosemary Cross, a second grade teacher, and is instantly
smitten. Although a romance between the two would seem impossible to anyone
else, Max's unbounded determination and self confidence compel him to pursue
her. Age never appears to be a barrier for Max, as his best friend in school
is much younger than him, and he has established a friendship with an older,
wealthy Rushmore alumnus, the industrialist Herman Blume. However, Max's
friendship with Herman becomes a rivalry because Herman has also become
romantically interested in Rosemary. Herman's age and wealth does not
necessary give him an advantage over Max, because Herman is married, and he
is also a jaded man with a stiff personality.</P>
<P>The setup for the story is not an original one. Countless films have been
made about the misfit teen who pursues love and stumbles through many
obstacles along the way. Usually these films provide a skeleton plot and an
overdose of sophomoric humor. This film, thankfully, is a different entity
entirely. The characters are more than stereotypes, the humor does not
insult the viewers intelligence, and the plot is never predictable. In fact,
it is not really even a "teen comedy" as it initially might appear to be.
Although the humor is based mostly on the quirkyness of the characters, it
does not resort to cheap jokes for easy laughs. The drama provides plenty of
substance. The younger children characters, which are usually relegated to
cute comedy sources, are developed as full characters.</P>
<P>Bill Murray gives an exceptional performance as Herman, who is different
from the manic characters that Murray usually plays. Herman exists most of
the time with a blank, world-weary expression. This is a difficult role to
play, since body language and timing need to be utilized properly, and a
lesser actor would not have been able to pull it off. Newcomer Jason
Schwartzman is also successful as Max. He is able to express Max's youthful
zeal without going overboard.</P>
<P>Recommended. This is a fresh, entertaining story that shows that films based
around high school students need not be moronic. It has involving drama and
is also a consistently funny comedy.</P>
