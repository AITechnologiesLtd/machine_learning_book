<P>     THE RICH MAN'S WIFE is one of those overplotted thrillers that 
works best if you're unfamiliar with film noir.  Nothing here is 
remotely original (a fact that shouldn't be unexpected), and, for a 
seasoned movie-goer, watching the film becomes a guessing game of which 
movie is going to be "borrowed from" next.  Bits and pieces of 
everything from FATAL ATTRACTION to THE USUAL SUSPECTS appear here, with 
little more than a few capable performances and a silly script to hold 
them together.  As for the ending... well, I'll get to that later, but, 
suffice it to say, it's the biggest problem of all.</P>
<P>     The Rich Man of the title is Tony Potenza (Christopher McDonald), a 
big-wig executive at the PBC Broadcasting Network.  He's a forty-year 
old workaholic who drinks too much and regularly engages in extramarital 
affairs.  Despite all that, however, he loves his young wife, Josie 
(Halle Berry), and she loves him, even though she too is unfaithful.  
When the couple vacations at an out-of-the-way lakeside cabin, things 
turn sour.  Tony is called back to Los Angeles for an important meeting 
and Josie is left behind, bitterly contemplating a prenuptial agreement 
that leaves her with nothing if she files for a divorce.  While on her 
own, she meets the mysterious (not to mention scary) Cole Wilson (Peter 
Greene), and, as they converse in a bar, she casually mentions that she 
sometimes wishes her husband was dead.  Cole takes her a little too 
seriously, however, and soon a pair of L.A. police detectives have a 
homicide to investigate.</P>
<P>     Much of THE RICH MAN'S WIFE is too hard to swallow, especially for 
those who are used to the typical contrivances of the genre.  The film 
opens with Josie being arrested on suspicion of murder.  After she is 
read her rights, she promptly declines the assistance of a lawyer, 
saying, "I don't want to speak with an attorney.  I just want to tell 
the truth."  Now, I don't care how innocent or naive a person is, 
they're not going to respond that way when facing a murder rap.  Such an 
inexcusable credibility blunder, coming so early in the film, 
immediately puts the viewer in a cynical frame of mind.  </P>
<P>     The bulk of the story is told as a long flashback, with Josie 
relating her side of things to a pair of incredibly stupid police 
officers.  Strangely, there are at least a half dozen scenes in "Josie's 
account" that she isn't involved in.  Details are revealed that she 
couldn't be privy to, yet, somehow, they become part of her narrative 
(maybe she's omniscient and we just don't realize it).  This sort of 
sloppy storytelling is evident throughout.</P>
<P>     For the "surprise" ending, writer/director Amy Holden Jones (MAID 
TO ORDER) has taken a cue from THE USUAL SUSPECTS.  However, the major 
difference is that, while everything in Bryan Singer's 1995 feature 
built logically to the big revelation, here, the "shocking" twist feels 
like a cheat -- something intended to throw the viewer off balance and 
obfuscate several of the movie's plot deficiencies.  Believe me, this 
particular device works a lot better with a well thought-out script like 
THE USUAL SUSPECTS than something silly and derivative like THE RICH 
MAN'S WIFE.</P>
<P>     Whatever its faults, THE RICH MAN'S WIFE is nicely-photographed.  
Veteran cinematographer Haskell Wexler (WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?) 
crafts an effectively dark and edgy mood.  A lot of this film takes 
place at night, and Wexler uses this to his advantage, capturing several 
memorable shots on small, moonlit country roads winding through a 
brooding forest.  Alas, John Frizzell's melodramatic score frequently 
spoils the effect.</P>
<P>     As Josie, Halle Berry is appealing, which is the most desirable 
trait for an "innocent victim" character.  Peter Greene, who has been 
typecast as a sicko/psycho with appearances in CLEAN, SHAVEN, PULP 
FICTION, and UNDER SIEGE 2, isn't required to explore virgin territory.  
There's an unpleasant scene where Cole slashes open his palm then licks 
the blood out of the wound.  Christopher McDonald is suitably abrasive 
as Tony, but, like Greene, the material doesn't challenge him.  Clive 
Owen plays Josie's ineffectual British lover, and Clea Lewis gives an 
intentionally irritating performance as his goofy, betrayed wife.</P>
<P>     THE RICH MAN'S WIFE is the sort of movie that should have gone 
straight to video.  It's not fundamentally all that different from the 
Andrew Stevens/Shannon Tweed thrillers that are popular with the rental 
crowd.  And, although this picture aspires to be a serious film noir, 
all it does is remind us how easily a formulaic premise can be 
transformed into a hopeless mess.</P>
