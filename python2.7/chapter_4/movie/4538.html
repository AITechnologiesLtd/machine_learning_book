<PRE>                              BATMAN FOREVER
                       A film review by Andy Jacob
                        Copyright 1996 Andy Jacob</PRE>
<P>S: Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, Nicole Kidman, Chris O'Donnell
D: Joel Schumacher</P>
<P>        I've been putting off watching this movie for a long time. 
When it was in the theater I opted to watch Apollo 13 instead. One reason 
was that many reivews said the film stunk, so I stayed away from it. But 
having watched it, I realized that I had missed a pretty good movie.</P>
<P>The latest Batman flick differs quite a bit from the other Batman movies. 
For one thing, the role of Batman has been passed along from Michael 
Keaton to Val Kilmer. Gothem City has changed from a dark and dreary town 
to a hip, modern town. And once again, Batman's foes have changed. Some 
of the changes were good, but there were some minuses to the movie, too.</P>
<P>On the plus side, Val Kilmer. I think that he made a much better Batman 
than Michael Keaton. But the way he spoke in the film was almost comical; 
he always had a deep, almost fake superhero voice. </P>
<P>Also a big plus was Tommy Lee Jones (who plays Twoface, Batman's main 
enemy in the film). He was probably the best actor in 
the film. I've seen him in many other films, and this just proves once 
again how diverse of an actor he can be. The way he plays the "bad guy" 
is just right: He acts just right when trying to catch Batman and acts 
just right when he fails. He also (to my surprise) added a lot of humor 
to the film. </P>
<P>Nicole Kidman (who played Dr. Chase Meridian) was absolutely gorgeous,
as she usually is. Definately a plus on that level. However, she really
didn't serve much of a purpose in the movie other than to drag out a
soap opera of sorts (the saga of herself and Bruce Wayne). She's a very
good actress in addition to her good looks, but she really wasn't given
a very good part to work with. So she was both a plus and a minus.</P>
<P>Jim Carrey (who played The Riddler)  was good, but was a disappointment to 
me. He was given a perfect "Jim Carrey" part and he pretty much blew it. 
There were certainly some funny parts, like the scene where he and 
Two-Face are trying to blow up the Batboat by playing a game of 
"Battleship" that triggers bombs in the water. When Two-Face got a hit 
that destroyed the boat, The Riddler exclaims in a dorky kind of voice 
like the commercial for the game Battleship: "YOU SUNK MY BATTLESHIP!" 
Overall, he wasn't as funny as he could have been.</P>
<P>Chris O'Donnell was the biggest disappointment. He played Robin, Batman's 
sidekick. His acting was terrible, and the plot of his parents getting 
killed by Two-Face was also very corny. There is one good scene were he 
pokes fun at the earlier T.V. series of Batman. He's walking along and he 
says "Holey rusted metal, Batman!", meaning that literally (He was 
standing on rusted metal full of holes, thus "holey").</P>
<P>The plot was different enough from the other movies to be interesting. 
Batman is trying to destroy Two-Face, the Riddler joins Two-Face as 
another enemy to Batman, meanwhile Chase dumps Batman for Bruce Wayne and 
soon finds out that Bruce Wayne is Batman. The bad guys discover this at 
the same time, though, and capture Chase and Robin. Then Batman has to 
save them. Personally, I liked the little bits of humor in the movie the 
best. In addition to the things I've already mentioned, I like the part 
at the beginning when Alfred, the butler of sorts for Bruce Wayne, asks 
him as he's about to leave as Batman to fight a crime: "Could I persuade 
you to take a sandwich with you, sir?" To this, Batman responds: "I'll 
get drive-through.</P>
<P>The special effects both added a lot to the movie and took away from the 
movie. The effects were excellent, but they were used too often. When 
this happens, the whole movie becomes boring because you have Batman 
kicking and punching bad guys and things blowing up as a result every ten 
minutes.</P>
<P>Despite all it's minuses, this movie was pretty good. The little things 
made it ok. It adds yet another chapter onto the Batman story, and there 
will no doubt be another one in a couple years. This is a pretty good 
movie that had the potential to be a great movie but blew it. 
Nevertheless, it's always nice to watch a good old fashioned good guys 
versus bad guys movie. And even after all the changes to Batman, the 
good guys still won.</P>
<P>Rating Scale:
* - Terrible. Don't see it; it's a waste of time
** - Not very good at all, probably not worth seeing
*** - Average. Plusses and Minusses
**** - A very good movie. Worth seeing.
***** - Excellent. Don't miss it!</P>
<PRE>Rating for "Batman Forever" - *** 1/2</PRE>
