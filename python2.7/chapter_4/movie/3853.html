<PRE>                        THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Generally fine special effects almost
          bring to life this children's film with an
          intriguing premise but with little idea what to do
          with it.  It finally needs some contrived plotting
          to infuse some danger and excitement.  The film has
          nice moments and even some allegory, but not enough
          of anything to make a great children's film.
          Rating: +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Omri gets some unusual gifts for his ninth birthday.  His (Asian)
Indian friend Patrick (Rishi Bhat) gave him a toy (American) Indian.
And his brother found a two-foot-high wooden cupboard and gave that to
Omri.  Neither is so great a gift by itself, but together they form a
lot more than the sum of the parts.  Omri locks the Indian in the
cupboard and when morning comes he finds that strange noises are coming
from the cupboard.  When he opens it, there in place of the toy Indian
is a real living Iroquois, just about three inches tall.  Little Bear
(played by Litefoot) is bewildered to find himself plucked from 1761
and the French and Indian Wars.  Even stranger, he is so small and ina
world he does not understand.  Now Omri finds he has responsibility to
do what is right for Little Bear, a miniature Indian who thinks Omri is
a god.  Omri quickly figures out that locking a toy in the cupboard an
odd number of times brings the toy to life; an even number of times and
the toy is just a toy.  The boy wants to keep the magic cupboard a
secret until he know better what to do with his new tiny friend.  But
he tells Patrick, and Patrick is quick to turn a toy cowboy into Boone
(David Keith) a real, but somewhat goofy, cowboy.  Now the two boys
find they must protect the cowboy and Indian from the real world and
from each other.</P>
<P>     This is an adaptation of the popular children's book by Lynne Reid
Banks but the screenplay by Melissa Mathison (THE BLACK STALLION, E.T.)
needs more of a spark to get going.  There is potential in this story
for some interesting relationships.  Omri is, after all, huge compared
to Little Bear, while Little Bear is a warrior and a mature adult,
albeit from another world.  Each could draw on the other's strengths.
But Omri never seems to profit much from the wisdom of Little Bear and
the child remains father to the man.  Little Bear is treated more an
interesting pet than an intelligent adult.  Instead the plot is tied up
with the over-acted Boone, wild and weird, who never becomes much more
than a caricature.  The personalities of the solid and intelligent
Little Bear and the silly Boone never mesh on the screen.</P>
<P>     Seeing this film on the same day I saw the 1957 film THE
INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN, I found it clear that visual effects have
come a long way since the 1950s.  Most of the scenes combining
characters of each scale are utterly believable.  There is some problem
with Little Bear being more in focus than his background, but I think
Jack Arnold would have loved to have the effects technology for his
film.  Yet Arnold was able to give far more interest value to his
characters than Frank Oz ever manages here.</P>
<P>     THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD wastes opportunities to use its clever
premise in any but the most superficial ways.  This is a film that
shows more technique than imagination.  I give it a +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
