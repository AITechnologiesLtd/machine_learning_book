<P>I've lived up and down the Midwest, a.k.a. "The American Heartland", all of
my life. Although I have interacted with different races throughout my life,
I have never been around or confronted by issues of racism. Racial hatred
and injustice was something I saw in the paper or reported on the evening
news.</P>
<P>That isn't to say that I haven't lived around or interacted with different
races; I have. Chalk it up to blessed surroundings or naiveté, but wherever
I've lived, races have intermingled with warm friendship and equal respect.
In some segments of our society, however, racism is alive and well.</P>
<P>Even though there are rural elements of bigotry like the KKK, the majority
of racial tension and aggression in contemporary America is taking place in
our nation's inner cities. I've never seen this life and culture first-hand.
I've never fully witnessed the racist extremes of both blacks and whites. I'
ve never been to these subcultures of anger, hatred, and violence. "American
History X" brought me there.</P>
<P>"American History X" is the story Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), a smart
young man who is corrupted by hatred of anything or anybody that isn't
Caucasian. After   committing a brutal crime of violence under the guise of
self-defense, Derek lands in jail. This begins a personal journey for Derek
Vinyard, one that forces him to confront his venomous hatred and racist
beliefs and see them for the lies that they really are.</P>
<P>First time feature director Tony Kaye and screenwriter David McKenna have
created a very powerful story here, with much of the dramatic evolution
coming from the way in which they structured the story itself. The events of
"American History X" are not told chronologically. Rather, the story goes
back and forth between the present and the past. In doing this, the story
continues to grab our attention as it slowly develops and reveals the
dimensions of each of its characters, particularly Derek.</P>
<P>I love films that do this because they don't show all of their cards up
front. We see each character act a certain way in the first part of the
story, but only through the course of the film do we slowly come to realize
why they have become the way that they are. It is also a precarious balance
to continue to go backwards and forwards in time, but credit Kaye and
McKenna for always making it clear and seamless.</P>
<P>One of the ways this is accomplished is that Kaye filmed every event from
the past in black and white. But when we return to the present, everything
is in color. Not only is this a good artistic way to express symbolism, but
it is also an effective method to use when telling a story in a non-linear
sequence.</P>
<P>By seeing either color or black and white, we immediately know two things:
A -- when the particular scene is taking place. B – the psychological,
mental, and emotional state of each character. This aids the viewer in
helping them to easily switch back and forth between the different emotional
perspectives that each time period depicts.</P>
<P>Most films that broach the issue of racism are afraid to confront the
complexities that the subject possesses. It's rather brave indeed to have a
main character back up his opinions with statistics and facts that are hard
to refute. Granted, Derek's philosophical conclusions to these facts (as wel
l as his solutions to them) are horrifically wrong and come from a
destructive motivation. But most movies depict neo-Nazi Skinheads as
brainwashed rednecks with no intellect or reasoning. And whereas many of the
Skinheads in this film are exactly that, Derek is much more complex.</P>
<P>Many of the Skinheads get some sort of perverted fun out of being
hate-mongering fascists, but Vinyard takes it very seriously. There is more
than senseless hatred involved; Derek has been hurt and destroyed by certain
elements of society. Empowered with great intelligence, he uses his
intellect to distort complex issues into misguided racist opinions.
"American History X" is able to maintain the correct moral perspective while
challenging us in a very politically incorrect yet honest way.</P>
<P>"American History X" has a stellar cast, led with a powerhouse performance
by Edward Norton ("Primal Fear", "Rounders"). Over the last two years,
Norton has never failed to impress. But his portrayal of Derek Vinyard is
the best of his career. Having beefed up for the role, Norton embodies the
role of an embittered young man who sees hatred and violence as the only
solution to society's ills. We never sympathize with Derek in his racist
incarnation, but we do understand him.</P>
<P>This is a phenomenal job of characterization by Norton as he is able to
humanize Derek without taking it to a level of empathy. It is a responsible
acting effort, one where sympathy is eventually evoked but not to the extent
of absolving responsibility for Derek's actions. With this performance,
Norton emerges as one of the very best actors working in film today. Be very
surprised if he is not recognized with an Oscar nomination next February.</P>
<P>Up until now, I have not been a fan of Edward Furlong ("Terminator 2:
Judgment Day"). Most of the characters he has played have been
one-dimensional rebellious punks. He's still a punk in this film, but the
difference is that Furlong's Danny Vinyard is a fully developed,
three-dimensional person. As Derek's hero-worshipping younger brother Danny,
Furlong delivers a sad, poignant performance of a young impressionable kid
caught in racism's crossfire.</P>
<P>Danny shows as much scholastic promise as Derek did, but sells himself short
as he struggles to live a life according to how he thinks Derek wants him to
live it. Having idolized Derek for most of his life, Danny's world is turned
upside down when Derek denounces his racist past. Furlong's vulnerability
allows us to see the upheaval that Danny experiences.</P>
<P>Beverly D'Angelo is impressive as a mother destroyed by her family's hatred.
Stacey Keach offers a subtle evil as Cameron, Derek's facist mentor and
organizer of the Skinhead faction.  Avery Brooks provides the film's moral
center as an African-American teacher who refuses to give up on Derek and
Danny. But it is comedian Guy Torry who provides the film's greatest
surprise as Derek's fellow prison inmate Lamont. Torry's performance is both
overtly funny and quietly direct. Through Lamont, Derek is finally able to
see an African-Americans as a real person for the first time.</P>
<P>It is also through Lamont that one of the film's central themes is
communicated. While many people of color (as well as Caucasians) are serving
appropriate jail sentences, there are those who are victims of the system.
Lamont is one of those victims. And as much as we may not want to face this
particular cancer that appears from time to time in our judicial process, it
is something we must be willing to face if we are to honestly address the
racial injustices that come into play from time to time.</P>
<P>Director Tony Kaye also serves as the film's cinematographer. As one of the
most respected commercial directors of the last decade, he has made a name
for himself with creative visuals. His talent is very apparent here as he
unintentionally establishes himself as the dramatic John Woo. Kaye, like
Woo, has a penchant for slow motion. But like Woo, Kaye's use of this effect
always seems to fit.</P>
<P>The main thing that impressed me was Kaye's fearless use of the close-up. I
am a big fan of close-ups and believe that directors don't use them nearly
enough. Kaye does in this film, allowing us to peer into each characters
eyes and give us a sense of what they are really feeling. Kaye has the
high-quality acting talent that enables him to do this. Wisely, he takes
advantage of it.</P>
<P>Be warned: "American History X" contains very graphic content throughout the
film. From constant profanities to sexual content, as well as brutally
graphic violence including a male rape in prison, this film is extremely
disturbing to watch. While the message of the film is timely and important,
there will be those who simply can't take the package in which it is
delivered. If these elements sound troublesome, you may need to carefully
consider your decision to see this film.</P>
<P>If "American History X" has a flaw, it comes in some of the plot elements
that it asks us to accept and believe to be possible. Derek is given a scant
three years in prison for the two murders he commits. Granted, the thieves
he gunned down were carrying guns themselves. As a result, Vinyard's charges
of murder are reduced to manslaughter via self-defense. This might happen
for your average Joe, but for a Swastika-brandishing Skinhead who
excessively brutalized one of his victims, it seems too lenient.</P>
<P>Also, the film tries to resolve a couple of its issues and characters too
quickly (roughly a day and a half time period within the film). This seems a
little forced given that the hatred and bigotry has been built up over many
years. But having said that, I credit "American History X" for not tying
this film up in a pretty bow. If anything, the story does not allow the
characters to escape their past even when they may want it to simply go
away. Powerfully and tragically, this film shows the reality of reaping the
harvest of evil seeds sewn, even when you've repented and changed.</P>
<P>But for me, these criticisms are minor because they had a minimal negative
affect (if any at all) on me. In spite of these stretches in realism, the
film never loses its power. It will anger you, move you, shock you, and
change you. It will also stay with you. "American History X" is one of the
best films of 1998. It is a film sure to cause debate, controversy and
discussion. If you can stomach the graphic nature of the film, you will
witness the most honest depiction of modern American racism since Spike Lee'
s "Do the Right Thing". It's a tough, sometimes sickening journey, but one
well worth taking.</P>
