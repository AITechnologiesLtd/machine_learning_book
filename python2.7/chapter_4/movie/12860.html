<PRE># [film] "City of Angels"
A Postview, copyright 1998 p-m agapow</PRE>
<P>One of the multitude of angels that looks over Los Angeles (Cage) 
falls in love with a surgeon (Ryan) who is facing personal and career 
turning points.</P>
<P>"City of Angels" is not a bad film, but it is a poor remake of Wim 
Wenders' "Wings of Desire".  For those who came in late, the central 
conceit is that angels walk amongst unseen amongst us.  They do not 
interfere, just witness, eavesdropping on thoughts, marvelling at the 
travails of humans, silently offering solace.  Given the growing 
popularity of angels as (strangely secular) icons of optimism and 
spirituality, it was perhaps inevitable that the aloof, (largely) 
monochrome and very European "Wings" be remade in the Hollywood mode.  
This apparently involved the use of a Waring blender to edit the 
script into an appropriately dumb form.  Where "Wings" was ponderous, 
"City" is frothy.  Where "Wings" is remote and oblique, "City" is 
superficial.  Where "Wings" is romantic, "City" is a romance.  In 
short, where "City" diverges from "Wings", it mostly does so for the 
worst.  But the result is not all bad.</P>
<P>It is a trifle ludicrous though.  Instead of Bruno Ganz struck with 
wonder at the dissolute acrobat Solveig Dommartin, we have Nicholas 
Cage lust-struck with idealistic heart-surgeon Meg Ryan.  (Hey, it's a 
romance.  It needs - nay, requires - Meg Ryan.)  Subtlety has quietly 
been thrown out the window.  When the angelic Cage reveals himself to 
Ryan, she gasps "You're beautiful!".  This is not - repeat, not - a 
great moment in cinema.  Cage's male pattern baldness and (ahem) 
excess of chest hair are distracting, to say the least.  A celestial 
chest wax and toupee would go a long way.  Slap in some trite 
aphorisms about the wonder of the world and love (which could only be 
uttered in a wealthy city like Los Angeles, and not one like Berlin 
wedged between two warring military powers), add an intrusive 
soundtrack, and there is every reason to expect "City of Angels" to be 
irritating.</P>
<P>But, for the sentimental viewer (which I confess to be), there is 
worth even in something as potentially trite as "City of Angels".  
Much like "Faraway, So Close", the somewhat mundane sequel to "Wings 
of Desire", there are moments when it beautifully flares to life.  
Angels crowd the beach, in rapture at the sunset and dawn.  A dead 
girl nostalgically remembers pyjamas.  A robber is agitated by self-doubt 
and guilt during a holdup.  A fallen angel rejoices in the mundane 
sensations of life.  Despite its lumbering gait, these ideas shine 
through and save a simple movie from becoming simple minded, and 
admitting both the wonder of complexity of life.  This mission is 
aided by the competence of some its components.  There is some 
genuinely beautiful photography in this film.  Cage and Ryan, who have 
both at times turned in cliched performances, here give two 
restrained and humane portrayals.  "City of Angels" may not be high 
art, but it is worthwhile.</P>
<P>"Is this God punishing me?"  whimpers a character.  "You know better
than that," his colleague answers.  And that's not a bad thought to 
take away from a movie.  [**/ok] and "Everything I Needed To Know, I
Learnt In Kindergarten" on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
