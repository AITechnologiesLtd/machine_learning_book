Return To Me (7/10)</PRE>
<P>Thank goodness for Return To Me. My mother came to visit and this was
the only film showing on any of the sixty screens in Bristol that I
thought my mother would enjoy. The film choice is restricted to avoid
anything remotely scary or exciting, as she's easily overwhelmed by a
big screen and a good sound system - I thought she was going to pass out
during the trailer for The Perfect Storm.</P>
<P>On reading the review in Empire magazine, I discovered that Return To Me
concerns a widowed man who falls for a young woman without realising
that she's the recipient of his dead wife's heart. My eyes rolled.
Sheesh... give me break... there must be something else I can take her
to see. Gladiator? U-571? Final Destination? Hmmm... maybe this heart
thing doesn't sound so bad... actually it's not at all far-fetched... it
could happen...</P>
<P>The guy - Bob (David Duchovny) and the girl - Grace (Minnie Driver) are
perfectly sweet and nice, as is virtually everyone in this film, and
even the bad stuff that happens to the characters is only there so they
can come out the other side even sweeter and nicer. Grace lives with her
father (Carroll O'Connor) and works in his restaurant. She also hangs
around with his gang of elderly friends, and much of the warmth and
humour in the film comes from the loveable old folk trying to help
romance blossom between Bob and Grace. (Did I mention that these good-
naturedly meddling senior citizens are very sweet? And nice?)</P>
<P>In Return To Me, director and co-writer Bonnie Hunt (who also appears in
the film as Grace's friend) has produced an unashamedly old-fashioned
weepy romantic comedy, and Duchovny and Driver are appealing enough to
just about pull off this unfeasible confection. It pushes the right
buttons, but occasionally the button-pushing is just a bit too obvious.
The film is also let down its bland cinematography - a point only worth
mentioning because the film was shot by the usually-reliable veteran
lensman Laszlo Kovacs. </P>
<P>Despite a lack of publicity for the film, it attracted a good crowd, so
such lightweight feel-good movies seem to have a sizeable audience who
are not currently being well served. (If anyone wants to fly me or my
mother out to Hollywood for consultancy services, they can e-mail me.)</P>
