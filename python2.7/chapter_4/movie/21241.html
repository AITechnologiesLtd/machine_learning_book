<PRE>                              FIGHT CLUB
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: People may be discussing for years
          the meaning of this strange absurdist black comedy
          set in a near future.  The unnamed narrator is a
          man who habitually crashes medical support
          encounter groups feigning diseases that he does not
          have.  He meets two enigmatic characters, one a
          woman who also fakes disease to go to encounter
          group meetings, the other a strange anarchistic
          genius.  With the latter the narrator founds a sort
          of fraternity where men can come and connect with
          each other by fist-fighting.  A dark film both
          figuratively and literally, FIGHT CLUB is a real
          go-for-the-throat satire tracking the rising tide
          of rage in America.  Eventually it starts to run
          out of steam if not anger, and perhaps could have
          been trimmed from its 139-minute running time.
          Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     On the heels of AMERICAN BEAUTY, one dark satire of American
suburban life, comes a far grimmer satire of lower class society and
anger.  Chuck Palahniuk's premier novel is brought to the screen as a
howl of rage by David Fincher, director of ALIEN 3, SE7EN, THE GAME,
and the upcoming RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA. FIGHT CLUB is about a subculture
of men who have turned their backs on soft supportive philosophies and
meaningless consumerism and have replaced it with hard knuckles and
covert terrorism.</P>
<P>     As the film opens, the narrator of the film (Edward Norton) has
someone unseen holding a gun in his mouth.  He begins to think back
over the previous six months to how he came to this pass.  In flashback
he has been a man suffering from insomnia, living in a constant
netherworld between awake and asleep.  He complains of the malady to
his doctor.  His doctor belittles him and suggests that if he wants to
see what real pain is he should visit a testicular cancer support
group.  Under an assumed name, the narrator pretends to be a fellow
sufferer and soon finds he really enjoys going to and giving support to
the patients.  He begins going every night a week to a different
disease encounter group.  Then he notices Marla Singer (Helena Bonham
Carter) who shares this voyeuristic hobby.  They begin to barter which
support groups each may cover. In a different setting, he meets Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt) a soap salesman and film projectionist who is
fighting his own war guerilla against society.</P>
<P>     When a mysterious explosion destroys the narrator's apartment, he
arranges an invitation to stay with Durden who asks for one thing in
return.  He wants to fight the narrator.  The narrator surprises
himself by enjoying the experience. This becomes a frequent habit
replacing encounter groups.  As other men come to watch the two fight,
they want to fight also, forming a common bond.  Durden and the main
character found a secret society that stages fist fights.  Eschewing
the old life of soft self-sacrificing support of others, membership in
the macho fighting society starts changing all of the narrator's
perspectives.  All that is real is the world where men fight
emasculation and prove their strength by the friendly beating of each
other.  They then wear their injuries as proof they are manly.
Eventually this underground counterculture will add to its agenda the
sowing of chaos and anarchy.</P>
<P>     Jim Uhls's script is frequently bitterly funny, but fails to
connect the various themes together.  The catalog-buying consumer
culture seems so little to touch the lifestyle of Tyler Durden that his
rage against it seems unmotivated and almost could have been added by
the writers as an afterthought.  Even if Durden is to use it as a
symbol of what he is fighting the film needs to tell us why that symbol
of superficiality rather than, say, architecture or vacation homes. The
text chillingly examines the bestial impulses in man and suggests that
we are a long way from breeding them out of the species.  The main
character is saddled with opposite impulses "to comfort the afflicted
and to afflict the comfortable."  In theme and even somewhat in plot
this film could be compared to, of all things, THE STRANGE CASE OF DR.
JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE.</P>
<P>     Jeff Cronenweth's photography features an agile and dizzying
camera flying the viewer around and through holes where Orson Wells
would fear to go.  Virtually every scene in the movie is underlit to
reflect the theme and create a repressive tone.</P>
<P>     This film seems a not entirely directed howl of anger.  It is
technically flawed, but coming in the wake of rage crimes like
Littleton it could not be more timely.  I rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10
scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
