<P>It happened with Jackie Chan and John Woo. It happened with Director
Ringo Lam. It even happened with Hong Kong's answer to Steven Spielberg,
Tsui Hark. Hong Kong filmmakers making their first projects for
Hollywood are having a hard time finding projects worthy of their
talents. Columbia / Tri-Stars latest release of "THE REPLACEMENT
KILLERS" is unfortunately no exception to this trend.
The plot opens with a stake-out, let by Detective Stan Zedkov (Michael
Rooker -'Harry: Portrait of a Serial Killer', 'Rosewood') to capture
Chinese drug lord, Wei Tong. Things go bad when the gangsters are tipped
off by the early arrival of a police helicopter. A shoot out ensues,
ending with Tong being killed by Detective Zedkov. 
This sets up the films multi-layered revenge plot. At the funeral for
his son, Triad Boss, Mr. Wei confronts Det. Zedkov. Zedkov defends his
actions by saying that "Tong had made his own choice". Mr. Wei counters,
saying  "Some choices are out of our hands." 
John Lee (Chow Yun-fat) is brought in to perform a hit in retaliation
against the Detective. John is a cold and calculated assassin. A man
"who is perfect in his work". John is not an assassin by choice. He is
in servitude to Mr. Wei for some undisclosed debt. John is told that
after this last job, his debt will be paid in full.
John takes the job, but with a sense of reservation. Positioning himself
on a hillside near the Detective's home, John assembles his weapon. He
sights his target.. but finally cannot bring himself to perform the hit,
his eyes reddening with anguish and guilt, (an absolutely marvelous
piece of physical acting, done without the use of optical effects).
This act of defiance sets John at odds with his boss. Mr. Wei orders
that John and his family in China, be killed. John is now a fugitive
from both the law and the lawless. He arranges to meet with a person who
can supply him with a fake passport so that he can leave the country and
return to China in an effort to protect his Mother and Sister. He meets
with Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino), a young woman who has made a living on
the opposite side of the law. She is now a forger, expert in creating
false ID's. Unfortunately, John has been traced to her hideout. A
blazing gun-fight erupts, with Meg and John forming an uncomfortable
alliance.
"The Replacement Killers" is one of the more visually stunning films to
come out of a major Hollywood Studio since the '60's. The look of the
film is sumptuous. Almost every frame is a painting, with diffused and
bold colors used to infuse scenes with emotion and mood. Unfortunately,
the film itself is void of those same qualities. Not to take anything
away from the film, the film is generally entertaining. The problem is,
is that there is an emotional distance in the film. There is no feeling
of dread, no feeling of threat, no sense of danger. It's almost as if we
were watching a music video. Director Antoine Fuqua is a marvelous
stylist, his handling of the visual look of the film and his staging of
action scenes is very promising. The film has a tempo and a rhythm that
is remarkable in and of itself. But that also serves to point out the
films biggest failing, his handling of his actors is almost
non-existent. 
Mr. Chow is a marvel to watch .You haven't seen this kind of screen
presents since Steve McQueen. Every time Chow Yun-fat is on screen, your
eyes immediately lock on him. His style and screen presents is the most
riveting thing in the film. No one handles a gun with more flair. Chow
Yun-fat has the grace of Gene Kelly. For the first time in an American
film, you believe that using two guns at once is physically possible.
While having been a major star in Asia for the past 15 years, the U.S.
has not really had the chance to experience this fine actor. It is a
testament to his talent and ability that the film is as captivating as
it is. 
Ms. Sorvino is poorly represented in the film. The character of Meg
Coburn is bereave of any development. She has no arc to her. That is
purely the fault of the script, which places more meaning on the action
than on the characters. But it is still a shame that as talented an
actress as Sorvino can be wasted like this. The scenes between Chow and
Sorvino have a forced, almost staged quality, there is no chemistry
between them. Chow Yun-fat's rescue of Sorvino during a car wash
shoot-out is remarkably forced, as he has no reason to save her life
other than to get his forged passport. There must obviously, be others
in Los Angeles that can perform that duty, so the reasoning behind the
rescue is sorely lacking.
Michael Rooker as Det. Zedkov is given the most ridiculous and out of
place facial hair that any law enforcement officer has ever had. Det.
Zedkov would look more at home being one of the hired assassins that
being an officer of the law. His character is also giving short shift by
the script. We know nothing about his character other than he is a
Detective with the Los Angeles Police Department, and that he has a son
that he adores. While we do see his wife (through the scope of Chow
Yun-fat's rifle) we are not introduced to her, therefore we are given
nothing to identify with. Det. Zedkov becomes a character servicing the
plot, nothing more.
Kenneth Tsang ('The Killer', 'Supercop') as Mr. Wei carries his role as
well as can be expected. All the script gives us is a man of immoral
power and corruption. Again, we know nothing about this man; why he is
respected or feared, what his exact illegal business is, and why as a
Triad leader, he has hired so many Europeans to work for him. J|rgen
Prochnow is completely wasted in the role of Wei's Enforcer. His
character is so lacking in development that he doesn't even have a name
(no one in the film calls him by name, unless his name is YOU!).
Going back to the look of the film. Cinematically, the film has a grand
an expressive feel. The use of color to dictate the emotion of the film
is nicely developed. The Cinematography by Peter Lyons Collister is
remarkable, and the sole essence of the film to show depth and
character. With a more developed script and more character development,
this technique would have giving us possibly the first post forties
'film noir'. 
The basic plot of the film has the makings of a fascinating crime drama.
The family loyalty / revenge motif that runs through the film is
interesting and should have been fully developed. The idea of taking
revenge against another by taking the lives of their loved ones is a
powerful plot construct. The most glaring disappointment is that John
Lee's family is only identified by a faded photograph. There are no
conversations with the family via phone or letter, no feeling that John
is alone in a foreign land. While it's possible to accept that John Lee
is a man who accepts his fate, the film does little to inform us of
that. 
All said, 'The Replacement Killers' is only a serviceable action film.
It supplies the requisite gunfights, car chases and explosions one
expects from the genre. But the lack of tension and drama severely
hamper the film, leaving one with the feeling that they've only seen
half of a finished film.</P>
<P>Rated **1/2 out ***** stars. A disappointing debut from Chow Yun-fat,
but one that does leave you wanting to see more.</P>
