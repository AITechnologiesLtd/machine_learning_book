<P>     TECTONIC PLATES is an incredibly painful motion picture experience 
that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie.  The film 
(which opened in Canada during 1992 but was never released in the United 
States) is based on a 1988 stage play by Canadian auteur Robert Lapage, 
and, while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live 
production, the translation to the screen is a creative disaster.  
Enduring TECTONIC PLATES is like sitting through a filmed version of 
performance art -- lifeless and tedious.  The qualities that make it 
captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture 
medium.</P>
<P>     TECTONIC PLATES has a storyline, although the narrative is 
developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion, with shots of the 
stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences.  It's 
not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie (despite the 
valid complaint that it is pretentious, all-but-screaming, "Look!  
Art!"), although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters.  
Because we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a 
movie, it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than 
mouthpieces for the writer's ideas.  They're not real, sympathetic, or 
believable.  I'm willing to give director Peter Mettler credit for 
trying something different, but this particular experiment is not a 
success.</P>
<P>     TECTONIC PLATES opens by introducing us to Madeleine (Marie 
Gignac), an art student studying in Montreal who has fallen in love with 
her professor, Jacques (Lapage).  One day, he disappears, and, fearing 
that he left because she was undeserving of his love, Madeleine travels 
to Venice to kill herself.  While preparing to commit suicide, she 
encounters drug addict Constance (Celine Bonnier), who causes Madeleine 
to re-think her decision.  Meanwhile, Jacques has moved to New York 
City, where he starts cross-dressing, calls himself Jennifer, and 
becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host.  With settings that 
shift from Paris to Venice to Montreal to Manhattan to Scotland, 
supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute, 
and cultural references that point to Chopin, George Sand, and Jim 
Morrison, TECTONIC PLATES is unique, if nothing else.</P>
<P>     However, as interesting as the film sounds (and I was excited to 
see it because the synopsis is promising), it never really delivers.  
The tone is soporific, the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and 
uninteresting, the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner 
(although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the 
story is largely unimportant), and the symbolism is obvious.  TECTONIC 
PLATES is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as 
unpredictable as the shifting of the Earth, but it takes one-hundred 
minutes to get across this transparent point.  There are some worthwhile 
moments, such as a silly sword fight between Jacques and the topless 
goddess and an entertaining discussion in both French and English about 
the differences between the two languages (although the fine points will 
certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual).  The only people 
likely to enjoy TECTONIC PLATES are those who feel a strong need to 
praise something this rootless and boring because (a) it's different, 
(b) it's not like anything they've seen before, and (c) it's 
pretentious.  For everyone else, it's not only a waste of time, but a 
poor introduction to the work of Robert Lapage.</P>
