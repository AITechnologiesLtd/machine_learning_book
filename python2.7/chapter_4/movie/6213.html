                      High School High (1996)
                   A film review by Ben Hoffman
                    Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>          It is not bad enough that our schools are in bad shape.
It is not bad enough that illiteracy in the United States is so high.
What we do not need is a movie that lays it on in thick globs that
demean everyone.  In addition it is a boring film.</P>
<P>         I never liked Jon Lovitz whom I compare to Chevy Chase.  Both
have sneers that turn me off.  Lovitz, in addition, affects a dumb
look as his idea of being a comic.  In HIGH SCHOOL HIGH, he is a
teacher at a private school who opts to leave in order to teach at an
inner city school.  There he encounters every kind of mischief and
worse.  There he finds a principal (Louise Fletcher) who uses a
baseball bat to keep the "students" in line.   That this is the same
Fletcher who was so good in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, is hard
to believe. . . and it is very sad that she cannot get a better role.</P>
<PRE>          Also starring in the cast are Tina Carrere and John Neville.</PRE>
<P>         I would have liked to review more of the film but after one
half hour of this disgusting display I left.  It has been several
years since I walked out before a screening was over but that
happened twice in this one week.   Baaaad.</P>
<P>          This was supposed to be a NAKED GUN type of movie, or
AIRPLANE, but it fell flat on its face because it lacked the wit that
the other films had.</P>
<PRE>          Directed by Hart Bochner in his first feature-length film.</PRE>
