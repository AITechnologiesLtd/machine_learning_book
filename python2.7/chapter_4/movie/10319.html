<P>     The new romantic comedy from James L. Brooks (BROADCAST NEWS, TERMS
OF ENDEARMENT) is a hoot.  Jack Nicholson sinks his fangs into yet
another role of a lifetime as Melvin, an obsessive-compulsive Manhattan
writer whose cranky, cursing, confrontational tendencies are in grave
danger of being humanized by three beings:  a struggling single mom
(Helen Hunt), a wounded gay artist (Greg Kinnear), and said artist's
small dog.  Politically incorrect hilarity ensues, but also a few tears,
as Mel can break a heart as quickly as he warms one.  In fact, the film
covers a range of emotions that's arguably *too* wide for it's own good.
The big (but not crippling) problem is the tone, which is susceptible to
the same split-second shifts that Nicholson's character is.  (Yeah, it's
fun to see him turn on a dime; it's another matter entirely when the
movie wants to.)  Then there's the story, which feels more than a little
contrived.  We're asked to believe a whole lot in this one, the least of
which is the grave age (and experiential) difference between Mel and his
love interest, well-played by Ms. Hunt.  How odd, I must say, to enjoy a
romance that has you rooting for the two to stay *apart*.  With Cuba
Gooding Jr., Shirley Knight, and Skeet Ulrich.  And, the song sung at
the piano by Jack is, indeed, Monty Python's "Always Look On The Bright
Side of Life."</P>
