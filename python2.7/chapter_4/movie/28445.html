<PRE>"Atlantis: The Lost Empire"</PRE>
<P>Young Milo Thatch (voice of Michael J. Fox) has the heart of an adventurer.
When a long lost and very old journal, once found by his explorer
grandfather, surfaces, the cartographer/linguistics expert becomes the key
to unraveling an ancient mystery in Disney's latest animation, "Atlantis:
The Lost Empire."</P>
<P>Disney Studios has played the release of "Atlantis" very close, too close,
to the chest for a potential animation blockbuster, so I had mixed feelings
of anticipation when we attended a Saturday morning kids' screening. Then,
the MPAA rating came up on the screen - Rated PG. What's this? A Disney
summer anime with a PG rating? I suspected, at this point, that something
good was up.</P>
<P>The movie starts with our soon-to-be hero, Milo, lecturing his "colleagues"
on the existence of the lost continent of Atlantis. It turns out he's just
pretending as he prepares to present his theory to his doubtful boss, Mr.
Harcourt (voice of David Ogden Stiers). Unfortunately for Milo, Harcourt
considers the theory - Atlantis is in Iceland - absurd. But, when a
gorgeous blonde, Helga (voice of Claudia Christian), sets up a meeting with
eccentric billionaire Preston B. Whitmore (voice of John Mahoney), Milo
finally finds someone who will listen to him.</P>
<P>Not only does Whitmore listen, he has already invested enormous sums of
money preparing for an expedition to find lost Atlantis and has been
waiting for someone with Milo's unique talents to join his team. In charge
of the mission is the burly Commander Rourke (voice of James Garner) who
leads his crew, in an enormous submarine, to the map coordinates dictated
by Milo from the ancient journal.</P>
<P>When the team reaches the undersea entrance to Atlantis, Leviathan, a huge,
metal, lobster-like guarding the doorway to the lost land, attacks them.
Rourke orders an attack on the beast and launches a phalanx of mini-subs.
They are only partly effective in stopping the metal monster and most of
the crew of 200 is lost. As the remaining explorers journey, heavily armed
and equipped, into Atlantis, Milo and the rest soon learn that they are not
entering a dead archaeological site but a living, breathing land teaming
with life, including the Atlanteans, and Milo is the only one who speaks
the language.</P>
<P>It's at this point that the story shifts gears from adventure and a search
for the ancient culture to one of intrigue. The mythical power source that
allowed the advanced evolution of the Atlaneans comes to the attention of
Rourke and his henchmen and they plan to take the treasured crystal for
their own gain. At the same time, Milo falls for a beautiful Atlantean,
Princess Kida (Cree Summer), and learns that the land and its power supply
are slowly dying. Only he can read the ancient runes and save Atlantis, but
is it too little, too late in the face of the invaders?</P>
<P>Much in the tradition of Jules Verne adventures, "Atlantis: the Lost
Empire" melds past period setting with the futuristic. Such adventures as
"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and "Journey to the Center of the Earth"
come to mind as the high-tech action of "Atlantis" kicks in and animated
splendor of Disney comes to the fore. This is, visually, one of the most
advanced animation works to come out of the industry giant. The deep canvas
background animation developed for "Tarzan" is used liberally, giving the
proceeds a live action look and feel. The combination of traditional cell
animation and computer-generated imagery (CGI) is seamless, with fluidity
of movement that, too, harkens to live adventure/action films.</P>
<P>There is a big cast of vocal talent accompanying Michael J. Fox - who gives
naïve, boyish charm to his intelligent, kind Milo. James Garner gives a
good twist as his Commander Rourke shifts from benign leader to ruthless
mercenary, along with his babe henchlady, Helga (Christian), who is one
tough chick. There is an ample supply of comic relief provided by the other
vocal cast and their characters. The late Jim Varney lends his drawl one
last time in the guise of Cookie, whose idea of nutrition is meat along
with great quantities of grease. Don Novello (Father Guido Sarducci) lends
his vocal talent as the sardonic, carefree explosives expert, Vinny
Santorini. Florence Stanley (TV's "Barney Miller" and "Fish") is a riot as
the chain-smoking, curmudgeon communications office, Mrs. Packard, in a
vocal perf that would have made Thelma Ritter proud. Vocal talent Corey
Burton provides and outrageous French accent to his character "Mole"
Moliere, the team's earth digger. Leonard Nimoy provides dignity to the
voice of the king of Atlantis.</P>
<P>The production owes a great deal to other animations that have preceded it.
Elements from such films as Ralph Bakshi's "Wizards," "The Iron Giant" and
"Beauty and the Beast" are evident, as are the aforementioned Jules Verne
adaptations to the screen. These various antecedents may have influenced
"Atlantis," but the makers take these elements and spin them into a fresh,
rip-roaring action/adventure that will please older kids through to the
adults. Younger kids will be left behind with this more adult-oriented
Disney animation, so send them to see "Shrek" instead.</P>
<PRE>I give it a B+.</PRE>
