<P>JURASSIC PARK (Universal Pictures / Amblin Entertainment)</P>
<PRE>Certification: PG-13
Genre: Action/Science fiction
Cast: Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, 
Bob Peck.
Directed by Steven Spielberg</PRE>
<PRE>My personal rating: 5 out of 6</PRE>
<P>JURASSIC PARK captured the world when it came. For the first time, 
truly realistic dinosaurs had been created and shown on the screen.
Although the dinosaurs in THE LOST WORLD were even more realistic,
the sequel suffers from too much stupidity, but we will come back to
that in another review.</P>
<P>JURASSIC PARK does work. It does the same for dinosaurs that STAR WARS
did for space-fantasy. We begin with a "teaser" that does nothing more 
than establish the fact we already have guessed: there are live 
dinosaurs on the earth now. The question is just how and where. An
eccentric millionaire, John Hammond (Attenborough), has created an
amusement park on an island not far from Costa Rica, and the attractions
there are to die for, as we shall see. He needs a couple of experts to
endorse the park in order to please the authorities so that he can
complete and open the park for the public. Doctors Grant, Sattler and 
Malcolm (Neill, Dern, Goldblum) are taken to the island to spend some 
days there and investigate the possibility for an amusement park where 
the attractions are ... live dinosaurs, recreated from DNA found in 
mosquito fossils. Unfortunately, one of the employees attempts to steal 
dinosaur DNA from the lab and sell them. By doing this, he causes the 
park system to break down and the dinosaurs are able to break out, 
especially the nasty carnivores, Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptor. Now 
there is Man against Nature in an astonishing action adventure that 
causes adrenalin rushes all the way to the end.</P>
<P>One interesting aspect about the movie, is the low age recommended to
watch it. Actually, JURASSIC PARK is a horror movie, but Spielberg
probably did what he could to make it a grown children's movie. I 
haven't read Michael Crichton's novel upon which the movie was based,
but I would expect it to contain more actual science than the movie.
There are certain scientific goofs in JURASSIC PARK, and I wonder if
Crichton was aware of this.</P>
<P>JURASSIC PARK should NOT have been followed by a sequel (no matter if
the novel was there). Spielberg ruined the "awesome dinosaur image"
by attempting to make them twice as heavy and so on. But JURASSIC PARK 
is in its own right a great movie with marvelous special effects (at 
least in 1993), and the screenplay by Crichton and Koepp is quite good. 
There does seem to be some holes in it, however, and you probably
shouldn't attempt to think too much about continuity and understanding
of the entire story. Just relax (which is impossible in the long run)
and 
enjoy JURASSIC PARK as an action/science fiction movie. Perceived that
way, JURASSIC PARK works best. If you are into the science, read the
novel.</P>
