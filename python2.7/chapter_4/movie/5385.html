                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>(1995) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        It almost seems like the title of a porno movie, doesn't it? 
But the friend I saw it with, who knows infinitely more about music 
than I do, assures me an opus has something to do with symphonies. 
He started to explain it, but after having just sat through a 145-minute 
epic melodrama, my attention span was too far gone to listen. MR. 
HOLLAND'S OPUS covers thirty years in the life of a high school 
music teacher and, believe me, you feel like you've aged along with 
him.</P>
<P>        Richard Dreyfuss plays Glenn Holland, a composer working 
on a symphony that he believes will earn him riches and fame. He 
spends thirty years on this symphony, which lasts only two and a 
half minutes when played at the end of the movie. The same musician 
friend I saw the movie with assures me that symphony would never 
make anyone rich or famous. "It sounds like something Yanni would 
play live at the Acropolis," he remarked. Even I didn't believe anyone 
would spend a third of a century working on something I'd swear I 
heard the last time I was in an elevator.</P>
<P>        Holland is sick of the wedding/bar mitzvah life of a man in 
a traveling band, and decides to take a job teaching, just for a few 
years, to have more time to spend with his wife (Glenn Headly) and 
his symphony (Elle Vator-Muzik). Principal Olympia Dukakis 
assures him it won't just be a job "to fall back on" and gym coach Jay 
Thomas scoffs at the notion of a teaching job giving anyone free time. 
Mr. Holland hates the job at first, but soon discovers that interactive 
Hollywood teaching style we've all seen. You know, where the 
actor/actress makes teaching fun and the whole class goes crazy 
about learning. Never mind that this has never once happened in real 
life, where school is a boring necessity that motivates few, including 
the smart kids. But nothing in MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS has any 
bearing on reality.</P>
<P>        This is a movie where you know every single character 
they introduce will fall victim to some melodramatic tragedy, whether 
it's the football player who has to join the band to keep his grade 
point up but has no rhythm (a black guy with no rhythm -- told you 
the movie wasn't believable) who is later killed in Vietnam, or the 
girl who took up clarinet playing because everyone else in her family 
was good at something and she felt like an utter failure, or the young 
singer who wants to follow her Broadway dreams but is held back 
by her father. Speaking of the believability factor, we're supposed to 
believe this girl wants Mr. Holland to run away to New York with 
her for a life of free-swinging sexual euphoria. What is it about 
Dreyfuss that attracts the teenage girls, the liver spots or the 
bifocal glasses?</P>
<P>        The biggest dramatic obstacle for Dreyfuss to overcome 
is his own son, who is born deaf, the ultimate irony for a father who 
wants his son to live and breathe music. But the most emotional the 
movie gets on this issue is having Dreyfuss sing John Lennon's 
"Beautiful Boy" (not one of his hundred best, let me tell you that) 
to him at a recital. It's more awkward and laughable than touching, 
and is just one of the many gratuitous musical numbers in the film 
that add to the eternally-long running time.</P>
<P>        MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS spends most of its time in two 
years -- 1965 and 1980, the first year showing Dreyfuss' first teaching 
days and the second year introducing the struggles with their son 
and the temptations offered by the young singer. Then we finally 
flash-foward to 1995 and the ending of the film, which is more than 
suiting for a movie that's been absurdly far-fetched and handled the 
dramatic issues in ineffective ways.</P>
<P>        Every student he's ever taught shows up for a surprise 
ceremony in the gym, where his symphony is finally played. So we 
get a bunch of testimonies about how his teaching style changed 
their lives (the clarinet girl, it turns out, is now the state governor), 
though for some reason the fate of the singer is never mentioned. 
This ending seemed ridiculous to me because I don't think there's 
ever been a teacher who's altered my goals or beliefs in any way. 
There have been plenty I've liked and now miss a little, but nothing 
life changing, especially from a music teacher. My old Sex Ed. 
teacher, on the other hand...</P>
