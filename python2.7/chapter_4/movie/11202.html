<PRE>THE APOSTLE (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>The Apostle is a leisurely film.  It is leisurely in the way that it brings
us into the story.  It is leisurely in the way that it conveys to us the
story.  And it is leisurely in the way that it introduces us to the main
character, Euliss "Sonny" Dewey (Robert Duvall).</P>
<P>The Apostle is an independent film written by, directed by, and starring
Robert Duvall.  This film is Robert Duvall's labor of love.  The film opens
with an unforgettable shot: a swinging door and two pairs of legs-one of a
large African-American lady and the other of a young small white kid.  This
opening shot introduces us to Euliss Dewey and shows us how Euliss got
introduced to God.</P>
<P>So far this sounds like a typical Hollywood movie.  Will it take on the
typical against-the-church route?  Or will it take on the
super-religious-lets-convert-the-audience route?  Surprisingly, it takes
neither and this is what makes The Apostle so enjoyable.  The Apostle
focuses on Duvall's character.  His Sonny is not a flat movie character,
but is subtle and as human as the rest of us.  Duvall's script does not
falter when portraying Sonny.  Sonny always stays true to his humanity and
never slips off into the realm of just another movie preacher.</P>
<P>One night while on the road, Sonny sits in his bed.  He's thinking things
over and it dawns on him that his life is falling apart.  Another thing
dawns on him: his wife (Farrah Fawcett) is cheating on him.  So, he picks
up from the motel and drives back to town and finds his house empty.  He
then drives to the house of the new young preacher in his church and tosses
a baseball through his window.  Later the next day Sonny finds out that his
wife wants a divorce and to top that off she has secretly and legally
stolen his church from under him.  In a fit of rage, and under the
influence of alcohol, Sonny explodes and attacks his wife's new boyfriend
at a Little League game.  After this incident Sonny is forced to flee his
home state and change his name.  He takes up the name "The Apostle E.F."</P>
<P>E.F. travels for a while until he finds a small town and settles down to
start his new Pentecostal ministry.  E.F. needs some help though, and he
finds it in a retired preacher (John Beasley).  The church grows quickly
because of E.F.'s energetic revivals.  E.F. knows that he has done
something awful and he knows that he'll never escape from it.  So, he is
going to try as hard as he can to redeem himself and to help make people's
lives better.  He, and the audience, knows that he can do the latter, but
the former will eventually catch up with him.</P>
<P>Robert Duvall is one of the best actors alive and with The Apostle he shows
that he can do more than just act.  His performance in The Apostle is one
of his best yet.  But, it is his work behind the camera that is so amazing.
 His film relies not on camera tricks to bring us into the film; rather it
uses the characters to bring us in.  The film itself feels down to earth
without that slick Hollywood feel to it.  It's not the type of film that
makes you want to change yourself, like Good Will Hunting, but it makes you
think of what you can change about yourself.  Duvall's Apostle E.F. is an
unforgettable character.</P>
<P>Among the cast there are other performances worth mentioning.  Farrah
Fawcett gives a good performance as Apostle E.F.'s
angel-on-the-outside-but-sinner-within wife.  John Beasley gives a good
performance as the subtle preacher Blackwell.  Don't blink or you'll miss
Billy Bob Thorton's role as a racist ready to get rid of The Apostle E.F.'s
church.  And one of the most understated but memerable performances was by
Walt Goggins as Sam, the quiet young man who unconditionally accepts The
Apostle E.F. and helps him with the church.</P>
<P>The Apostle grows on you because of its leisurely pace.  In the first
half-hour things move a little slowly but stick with it; the reward is a
great character study.  What you don't get with The Apostle is standard
Hollywood fare.  This film is not embarrassed to do what it likes when it
likes.  The twists and turns in the film show up unexpectedly and the film
is not clichéd or predictable in any fashion.  Don't Miss The Apostle.
When the credits start to roll and the screen fades to black at the end,
don't pick up and leave; stay for a minute or so and see what makes the
character of Apostle E.F. so powerful and great. </P>
