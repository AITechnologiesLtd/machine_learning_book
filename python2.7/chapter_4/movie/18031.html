<PRE>LE FRANC
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>If you've never seen films made by African filmmakers before, LE FRANC
provides an interesting introduction.  Written and directed by Senegal's
Djibril Diop Mambéty, LE FRANC presents a Capraesque, good-spirited view
of humanity.</P>
<P>As the story opens, Marigo (Dieye Ma Dieye) wakes up in his tiny room.
Marigo is a dirt-poor musician with a big hangover.  He uses his one
pitcher of water to serve multiple purposes as he washes up.  As he is
trying to get ready for the day, his landlady starts yelling at him
through the wall.  He's six months behind in his rent, and she wants her
money.</P>
<P>After sneaking out, his fortune finally turns.  Picking up money that a
guy drops on the ground, he uses it to buy a lottery ticket since today
is the day of the big lottery.  The rest of the story concerns his
troubles in attempting to collect the big prize that he wins.  Full of
visual humor, the best is the door to which he has stuck the ticket.  He
carries the door all over town, including on the top of a bus.</P>
<P>The movie works on the level of a simple, short story as well as a
travelogue to a poor area that few tourists will ever visit.  You leave
feeling that you know the people a little better even if the tale is a
fairly universal one.</P>
<P>The most enjoyable part of the movie is unique.  An instrument called
the congoma provides the film's lovely Senegalese rhythms.  Looking like
an extra large shoebox, the brightly painted instrument has a dual
purpose -- it also provides sanctuary for the local birds.  Now, what
other country would have such a charming instrument, serving as both
birdcage and musical instrument?</P>
<P>LE FRANC runs 45 minutes.  The film, which has almost no dialog, is in
Wolof with English subtitles.  It is not rated but would be a G since it
has nothing to offend anyone.</P>
