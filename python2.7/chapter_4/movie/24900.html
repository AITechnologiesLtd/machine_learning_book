                    A film review by Christopher Null

<PRE>     Who's the bad mutha -- shut yo mouth!</PRE>
<P>     That's right.  Just talkin' 'bout Shaft.  The remake.  Er, the
sequel that is -- in what might very well be the first and only time a
sequel has been given the same title as the original.  And believe me,
that's just where the stupidity of Shaft begins.</P>
<P>     Samuel L. Jackson is obvious casting for the role of John Shaft,
the nephew of that other John Shaft (Richard Roundtree), the man who
popularized New York's baddest cop in three films during the early
1970s.  While John Shaft is certainly a piece of pop culture, it's also
important to remember that the Shaft films were little more than classic
examples of blaxploitation.  And the Shaft of today does embarrassingly
little to change his image.</P>
<P>     It's a pity, because the update could have been a lot of fun -- a
modern-day John Shaft as tragic hero in a corrupt and oppressive NYPD.
Alas, no, the movie degenerates after 10 minutes of foot-tapping to
Isaac Hayes' classic "Theme from Shaft," with the audience left merely
to wonder: How long it will be until Roundtree makes his obligatory
cameo? (Answer: about 30 minutes.)</P>
<P>    The plot, what there is of one, is an utter throwaway.  Involving a
rich yuppie psycho (American Psycho's Christian Bale, now making a
living playing rich yuppie psychos) who bludgeons a black man to death
-- and the hush scheme to silence the only witness (Toni Collette) --
Shaft is so derivative as to be laughable, if only it didn't take itself
so seriously.  With Shaft's ridiculous beard trim, a joke-busting
sidekick (fittingly played by Busta Rhymes, the only real treat in the
film), and a whole army of bad guys, none of whom can shoot worth a damn
(though Shaft never misses), Shaft is a parody of itself but doesn't
even realize it.  Ultimately, the story serves simply to usher Shaft
from fight to gun battle to car chase, over and over and over again.  If
it wasn't called Shaft, no one would see this film.</P>
<P>     I tell you what.  Let Spike Lee direct Shaft instead of blood-happy
John Singleton.  Hell, let Spike Lee direct and star!  Now that'd be a
movie.  But what am I saying?  Shut yo mouth!</P>
