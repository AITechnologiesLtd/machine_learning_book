<PRE>rating: 6.32 (of 10)</PRE>
<P>        LAST MAN STANDING is essentially a rehash of Kurosawa's YOJIMBO with
some additional western-film cliches and fanciful cinematography thrown
in for good measure.  That said, I found LAST MAN STANDING a thoroughly
entertaining means of wasting two hours.  There's more than enough
gunplay and visual stimulation to wash away any empty feelings left by
the cookie-cutter script.  If you don't take this film seriously (no
easy task when planning to write a review), you'll likely find yourself
enjoying it, as it does get more interesting towards the climax. 
Through a critical eye, however, LAST MAN STANDING is a fun but
forgettable mixed bag.
        The film's biggest downfall is the plot, pulled right from the
Hollywood recycling bin.  A remake of YOJIMBO, but borrowing heavily 
from every western and gangster film ever made, the script offers
little or no new ideas.  The story is simple:  in a typical lawless
town on the Texas/Mexico border in 1931, two rival gangs face off to
control the illegal liquor trade.  In this town, the line between good
and evil is eternally blurred, and the very streets fester and ooze
with police corruption, moonshining, and prostitution.  Sound vaguely
familiar?  It's been used in nearly every western since the days of
John Wayne.  The seedy bar (yes, even in the prohibition), the cheap
hotel, the dusty, beaten street, the sheriff's office... all echoes of
films past.  The film begins when common picture-show tough-guy Bruce
Willis drives into town, not expecting to stay.  Some local thugs smash
up his car, and he sees a girl walk by (love at first sight, of
course).  As any vigilant viewer can predict, Willis sticks around to
rescue his damsel-in-distress and get revenge on the bullies who
damaged his precious automobile.   It doesn't take a psychic to know
how the rest of the film goes.  In fast, LAST MAN STANDING probably
sets a record for film predictability: it's the only one I've seen yet
where the ending can accurately be predicted simply by hearing the
title.  Of course, there are some plot twists, but ultimately there's
nothing new to be seen here.
        The actors all try hard, with some success.  Willis is truly adept at
these roles.  In some recent efforts (PULP FICTION, the third DIE
HARD), Willis' tough-guy aesthetic is so natural and believable, he
scarcely seems to be acting  at all.  Soon, he won't even need a
script.  Willis adds some much-needed life to this film, certainly. 
The other most notable actor is Christopher Walken, playing his usual
over-the-top nut job role, this time as Chicago gangster Hickey. 
Hickey has a big scar running down his face (call the cliche police...)
and sometimes shoots his tommy gun for no apparent reason.  The rest of
the cast is mostly average, although I did enjoy seeing the underrated
R.D. Call as Joe McCool, another of the Irish gang.  The other gang is
Italian (at least LAST MAN STANDING can't be accused of political
correctness), but too stereotypical to be either realistic or
interesting.  The performances are among the film's high points,
though.  The dialogue was very well written, too, considering the
script.  LAST MAN STANDING contained some excellent stunts as well. 
        Another good point is the cinematography and direction.  Every scene
has a life and kinetic movement all it's own, a trait not shared by
most earlier genre entries.  The way gunshots go off in a dark room, a
roadhouse burning to the ground with people trapped inside--the camera
works with a certain artistry and grace that adds most of the
excitement and freshness to this otherwise stale movie.  A certain
flourish and verve exists in all the visual elements of LAST MAN
STANDING.  The principal visual element is dust, which adds to the
atmosphere and visual style of the film.  Some of the sets are stunning
as well, especially the abandoned church.  Visually, the movie is
colourful and interesting.
        The music is atmospheric and highly appropriate, but not really
anything special.  Needless to say, a soundtrack is available, but why
anyone would buy it is beyond me.  The sound effects are well done,
especially the gunshots (and there certainly are quite a few of them). 
Both the music and sound are passable efforts helping to save the film
from being below average.
        I maintain that LAST MAN STANDING is, despite a lackluster plot, an
entertaining and enjoyable movie experience.  The pace is fast enough,
and the action is nearly constant: there seems to be a deadly gunfight
in nearly every other scene.  The acting is good, and the plot is...
familiar.  Although the film is not among the best of the year, or even
the best of the movies currently in theatres, it provides suitable
entertainment for its running time.  Ultimately, the unoriginal plot
does not haunt the viewer in every frame of film... the visual style
does.</P>
