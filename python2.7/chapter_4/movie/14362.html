<PRE>Titanic...the movie that just won't sink!        
Written on March 25, 1998

<P>As of March 22, 1998, the movie "Titanic" was unanimously declared the
number one biggest money grossing movie of all time! Its domestic
ticket sales sailed through the $492 million mark, leading the old
box-office champ, Star Wars, to a darker side finish in second place.
It just gathered eleven Academy Awards to add to its incredible
success, and appears to be headed towards a worldwide box-office gross
of close to $1.5 billion worth of ticket sales. So why has this movie
turned into the biggest money-making film of all time? Hmmm...let's
investigate.</P>
<P>A mere six months ago, Titanic was being nastily compared to another
great water-based film that was over-budgeted, ran long and over-rated,
Waterworld. That film cost Sony Pictures close to $175 million to
produce, with dire financial results across the world. With Titanic's
enormous budget cradling the $200 million mark, many studio executives
had also begun to shake in their soggy boots, and hope for a miracle
from above. And as the movie's shooting schedule continued to go past
its original set date, the studio begrudgingly had to settle the film
into its late fall release schedule. This was not a decision it wanted
to make, as the summer season was without a doubt the greatest
money-making season for all Hollywood studios. But the director of this
ambitious film, James Cameron, would not succumb to the studio's
pressures, and even surrendered his own salary for the project, in
return for more time to film the movie that he had intended. </P>
<P>And the rest, as they say...is Hollywood history.</P>
<P>Released on December 18, 1997, Titanic immediately gained the top spot
in the box-office ranks of that weekend, and has stayed in that
position ever since. It's currently in its 14th week of release, and
its prime spot at the head of the charts has yet to be rivaled
(Leonardo DiCaprio's other film release, The Man in the Iron Mask, was
the closest rival to Titanic last weekend, as it grossed only $300,000
less than Titanic). The Titanic album is also at number one on the
music charts, and the Titanic book has consistently remained in the top
ten since it embarked on its literary sendoff back in December.
Worldwide movie grosses are forecasted to balloon past the $1.5 billion
mark by the time the movie ends its run in theaters, and only then,
will the home video market begin to cut into its share of the Titanic
money pie. Titanic is no longer just a movie, it's a phenomenon.</P>
<P>But as I gathered my facts and figures about this triumphant film, I
started to ask myself about the reasons behind this movie's phenomenal
success. I personally saw the picture as nothing more than a decent
movie with some great special effects and a good love story. But that
was all. Why were others going ga-ga over this "big boat movie"? Why
had many gone to see all of its 197 minutes over and over and over
again? I had to know. The answer ran deeper than I had anticipated.</P>
<P>The nineteen-nineties began with the average budget of a film being
shot around the meager $20 million mark, and ended with Titanic's
gigantic cost of over $200 million. This rise in budgets led Hollywood
into a new genre of film-making that relied more on its special
effects, explosions, big name stars, and superb action sequences,
rather than the actual plot line of the film. When you look at the
highest grossing pictures over the past few years, Men in Black,
Independence Day and Jurassic Park, you will notice a singular thread
that passes through each of these films. </P>
<P>That thread is firmly tied to the fact that each of those stories
lacked any kind of real emotional plot line. The special effects were
always good. The sound effects were monstrous. Even the creation of
these new and wonderful fantasy worlds left many of us in awe. But the
obvious lack of humanistic feelings and values had become openly
acceptable, common and regrettably absent.</P>
<P>With Titanic, director James Cameron was able to successfully mesh the
two worlds of special effects and human emotion, as to make this
picture unique within the sea of heartless big-budget movies that had
been propagating themselves over the past few years. People have liked
this movie because they liked the special effects, they liked the
story, but most of all, they liked the characters of Jack (Leonardo
DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They liked the love story.</P>
<P>Within the great, big, so-called technological advancement of the 20th
century, the Titanic, two socially incompatible people were able to
fight all odds, overcome all obstacles, and find one another. And as
the end of this century nears, and the dawn of the next millenium
creeps up and into our mental horizon, it is obvious that many people
have begun wondering about their own places in this highly
technological world of ours. </P>
<P>The fast-paced lifestyles of so many North Americans has reached such a
mechanical stage at this point, that many have blindly adopted the
anti-social tools of this technological age. They've readily accepted
the notion of communicating via electronic mail with their friends and
family, researching their hobbies and interests in front of a 17-inch
computer screen, and even shopping by a click of a button. These events
used to exemplify the pinnacle of human and social interaction when our
times were simpler, but nowadays...they're just more tasks to add to
our Personal Digital Assistants. </P>
<P>Are people happy travelling through this web of technological
advancements from year to year? Not according to the APA (American
Psychiatrists Association), which has claimed a steady rise in the
number of depression cases in the 1990's, and predicts an even higher
number as the new millenium approaches.</P>
<P>And when you superimpose the "Titanic" experience with many of the
anxieties that people from this decade are currently experiencing, the
answer to my original question, becomes a whole lot easier to solve. </P>
<P>People see hope. They see love. They see the need to appreciate every
day to its fullest. They see Titanic, and they recognize these factors
as the most important things in their daily lives. Forget the daily
planners. Forget the emails still sitting in your inbox. Forget the TV
show that you felt you "had to" tape. See your family. See your
friends. See the love and hope and dreams that inhabit your mind from
day to day, and from month to month. Subside your disillusionment of
this crazy world we're living...just for a moment.</P>
<P>I believe that director James Cameron's timing was impeccable with this
project in regards to the times in which we are now living. People see
the future and they are scared. They aren't sure if they are going to
sink or stay afloat. The optimistic destiny that falls upon the two
main characters in this film, is a fate to which every audience member
would love to subscribe. And as the world's day to day operations
continue to retract us from the more important aspects of our lives as
human beings, this film allows us to breathe a certain air of optimism
into the future of our society. The hope and love that's resolved by
the characters in this film, allows everybody in the audience to
believe in their own chances of survival in this unpredictably,
evolving world of ours, and restore some of their own lost faith in
humanity.</P>
<P>These lessons are the ones that the next few copycat producers should
mimic as they attempt to cash in on similar movies over the next few
years. They shouldn't zone in on the Leonardo DiCaprio factor, the
gigantic budget, or even the great special effects. The real human
emotions is what they should be studying. The lost emotions of an
audience that has long been ignored by Hollywood movies. Movies that
exemplify hope, love and humanity. Movies that have a meaning to their
audience. Movies with a heart... </P>
<PRE>Just like their audience.</PRE>
