TOTAL RECALL
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>One of the most popular concepts in 1990s science fiction is
virtual reality. Rapid development of computer technology is
most evident in more and more realistic special effects in
Hollywood movies and television. Future world where
computers would be able to fool other human senses doesn't
require much imagination. In such world it would be very
hard, almost impossible for humans to distinguish real world
from those created in computer simulations. There were many
novels, comic books, movies and TV shows based on such
concept, MATRIX being most successful of them. However, such
concept isn't new; it used to be explored many decades ago
in the works of Philip K. Dick, one of the most important
and influential science fiction writers of 20th Century.
Dick in his stories and novels often wrote about different
realities created with supertechnology of the future, and
consequent loss of the identity among human beings. Some of
those fears found the way to manifest themselves into
extraordinary films. Dick was one of few giants of science
fiction literature lucky enough to have not one, but two
great science fiction films. First one is BLADE RUNNER, 1982
cult classic, and another, that stood in its shadow for the
past ten years, is TOTAL RECALL, 1990 film directed by Paul
Verhoeven.</P>
<P>Plot of the film is loosely based on Philip K. Dick's short
story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale". The year is
2084 AD and Doug Quaid (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger)
seems to have everything he needs in life - a good home,
steady job of construction worker and beautiful wife Lori
(played by Sharon Stone). However, his idyllic life is
troubled by dreams he has each night; in those dreams he is
on Mars, in company of beautiful and mysterious brunette.
Because of such dreams, he wants to travel to Mars, but he
can't afford it. Such problems are usually solved by
"Rekall", company specialised for inserting false memories
into people's minds. Quaid goes there and orders two weeks
of false memories about his being on Mars. Routine procedure
goes terribly wrong because somebody had already implanted
false memories into his mind. Quaid is suddenly being
attacked by his friends, co-workers and even his wife; they
are all operatives of all-powerful Agency, whose top
official Richter (played by Michael Ironside) spares no
effort to kill him. It seems that Quaid used to be secret
agent of Vilos Kohaagen (played by Ronny Cox), ruthless
governor of Mars colony, and had his memory erased after
betraying him for the sake of Mars freedom fighters. Quaid
must travel to Mars in order to solve the mystery of his own
identity and find the girl of his dreams.</P>
<P>Filmmakers took great liberty with original story, but,
luckily Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, experience writers
of science fiction cinema classics, were members of
script-writing team. As a result, TOTAL RECALL has an
original, exciting, intelligent and thought-provoking
script, one of the best produced in Hollywood in the last
few decades. Most interesting aspect of the film is the idea
that the sufficient level of technology can erase any
difference between objective reality and subjective
perception of the world. For most filmmakers today, the best
mechanism is virtual reality. For Dick in the story, and
screenwriters in this film, such mechanism was somewhat more
primitive technique of implanting false memories. Such
technology, although crude, exists today (at least, if we
are to believe reports about alleged alien abductees being
manipulated into fabricating their stories under hypnosis),
so it isn't hard to imagine its widespread use in the next
hundred years. Suspension of disbelief is even easier when
it comes to that technology being misused for some nefarious
purposes, like in this movie. But the most disturbing
consequences of such practices is human inability to
distinguish reality from fantasy - if memory can be
manipulated, and people can't trust their own past, they
consequently can't trust their present. The hero of this
film is constantly faced with such dilemma - are
all-important events in this film real or just his fantasy?
Movie leaves this question unanswered, forcing the audience
to watch it many times in order to find subtle clues. This
unanswered question could have spawned the very same endless
debate as the Android controversy in BLADE RUNNER.</P>
<P>Unfortunate thing for the reputation of TOTAL RECALL (and
good for its quality), was the fact that execution of this
script had been left to Paul Verhoeven, author of ROBOCOP,
another hidden gem of science fiction, made three years
earlier. Verhoeven was never associated with cult science
fiction, at least not with science fiction as infantile
entertainment, dominant trend in 1980s. Verhoeven always
used Hollywood resources to paint subversive picture of some
disturbing trends of contemporary America, always disguised
as standard commercial films. TOTAL RECALL, perhaps, wasn't
so radical or obvious like ROBOCOP. However, some elements
of 1980s are still present in Verhoeven's vision of the
future - some unknown yet recognisable variation of Cold War
is still fought somewhere in the background, corporate greed
at the utter expense of Have Nots still dominates the
economy, raw consumerism still dominates the culture and the
killing of helpless civilians and summary executions are
normal modus operandi of the legitimate government. This
grim picture is, on the other hand, well hidden with the
huge amounts of action, and consequent huge amounts of
violence. That violence is most graphically depicted - few
films are able to show people literally stepping over dead
bodies to achieve their goals. Verhoeven even manages to
insult feminists with scenes of nudity and with almost
all-important female characters being portrayed as whores.
The audience, however, barely has time to think about that,
because Verhoeven turns the film in one big roller-coaster
ride, using non-stop action through superb editing.</P>
<P>Verhoeven did great job not only in directing very good and
memorable action scenes, and neatly tying them with
thought-provoking and intelligent plot. He also managed to
create specific atmosphere of the film, which was supposed
to make huge Dickian contrast between bright
supertechnological future and its grim consequences for
human beings. Production settings of futuristic Earth and
Mars colony are quite believable, and special effects, still
good after having to compete with CGI for almost a decade,
provide many memorable scenes, especially at the spectacular
end of the film. Verhoeven obviously took great care about
details, providing some amusing product placements (ads for
"Mars Today") and interesting in-jokes and pop culture
references. Always reliable Jerry Goldsmith provides another
very good musical score, quite appropriate for this film,
quite in rank with his previous classics like ALIEN and STAR
TREK.</P>
<P>Some critics were led to disregard TOTAL RECALL because its
lead actor was Arnold Schwarzenegger, until that time always
associated with brainless action films (or, to be more
precise, what mainstream critics used to call "brainless
action films"). In this film he again plays unstoppable
killing machine with almost superhuman abilities, but there
is difference; this time the machine happens to be very
human. Quaid is man who is suddenly forced to swap his
boring, but safe existence with constant life for life and
the struggle to find his true identity, and, above all, he
is never sure whether he lives in a dream. Such trials and
tribulations were nice opportunity for Schwarzenegger to
show some of his, usually unused, acting abilities. His role
shadowed everyone else, mostly because they had limited
screen time. That happened even with great character actors
like Ronny Cox (who actually replayed his role of corporate
villain in ROBOCOP), Michael Ironside and even with his
nominal partner Rachel Ticotin. Some, on the other hand,
provided great episodes - Ray Baker was nice as sleazy
"Rekall" executive and Mel Johnson Jr. gave quite humorous
performance as Martian cabby. But the most memorable
supporting role was played by Sharon Stone; her portrayal of
Quaid's treacherous wife prepared her very well for the role
of Catherine Trammel in BASIC INSTINCT, the most ultimate
Bad Girl of 1990s cinema.</P>
<P>Of course, there are some that aren't pleased with TOTAL
RECALL for quite different reasons. Most obvious flaw in the
movie could be found by subjecting the movie to the basic
scientific nit picking. The ending, although spectacular,
seems unrealistic and as well as some scenes in Mars colony.
However, those who like to defend TOTAL RECALL might
disregard those nit-picks by seeing scientific
implausibilities as quite believable in the context of
Quaid's dream. All in all, TOTAL RECALL is well paced,
entertaining and thought-provoking piece of science fiction
cinema, a truly superb, yet disregarded gem of that
particular genre.</P>
