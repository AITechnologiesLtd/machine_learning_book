<P>     This year's Best Documentary is about rhythm.  The rhythm of the
blues.  The meter of soul.  The cadence of verse, fist, and dance.
Director Leon Gast journeyed to Africa in 1974, to film a festival of
music that was to accompany the championship contest between Muhammad
Ali and George Foreman.  The fight was postponed for six weeks, the
festival went ahead as scheduled, and Gast stuck around, becoming
increasingly interested in both the politics and the personalities
involved.  He shot some great concert footage and also pinned down the
fighters, the promoters, and, even, Zaire's dictator, President Mobutu
Sese Seko.  Two decades passed before Gast could finish his film.  To
the hundreds of hours of footage, he added interviews, including writers
George Plimpton and Norman Mailer, both of whom were originally
ringside.  (And both of whom get a little too much screen time.) The
result is an immensely entertaining time capsule that rocks with an
electrifying rhythm.  And it's funny!  From Ali's rhyming rants to
Mailer's description of Don King's hair, there's a hearty sense of humor
here.  In fact, all that's missing is a modern-day encounter with the
champs.  What we saw at the Academy Awards should've also happened in
this movie.</P>
