<PRE>A Night At The Roxbury (1998)
*
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp

<P>Look no further than A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY for evidence of the decline of
two institutions: "Saturdy Night Live", which hasn't managed to be funny in
over a decade and a half, and American comedies in general.  ROXBURY is so
wan, so thin and juiceless, that it barely classifies as a movie.  It also
commits the cardinal comic sin: it's not funny.</P>
<P>ROXBURY gives us the Butabi brothers, Steve and Doug (Will Ferrell and
Chris Kattan), who are in themselves clones of an earlier SNL routine, the
"Wild and Crazy Guys".  The post-high-school Butabis are still stuck in
their parents' house, work for dad's flower shop, and head out when the sun
goes down in futile attempts to get into upscale nightclubs and score with
the ladies.  After countless rejections (in a movie like this, anything
that happens so much as twice feels "countless"), they get lucky and wind
up weaselling their way into the ultrahip Roxbury as part of the entourage
of a TV star (Richard Grieco).  All along the way we get a barrage of
hit-and-miss gags -- the best of which have already been played to death in
the trailer.</P>
<P>It's a little distressing how the movie manages to play host to many
different pieces of action without making any of them funny, or even
interesting.  F'rinstance, Father Butabi (Dan Hedaya, they guy who looks
like Harry Dean Stanton's weaselly brother) and Mom (Loni Anderson, of all
people), are barely milked for a single joke.  Their function is to stand
there and look bewildered.  A neighboring businessman's daughter, Emily
(Molly Shannon), gets a mad crush on Steve -- as part of a larger plan to
manipulate them into mergingin their businesses as well as their bodies --
but they dimness of the boys is so absolute that we hardly care they're
being suckered.  What fun is that?</P>
<P>Lacking a story, or even a real moment of comic invention, the ROXBURY
creators threw everything else they could think of at the screen, and hoped
some of it would stick.  Fights, weddings, Wayne-and-Garth antics, and on
and on.  For some reason I was reminded of the equally lamentable TOMMY BOY,
which featured SNL alumns Chris Farley and David Spade, landlocked in a
script that was equally barren of entertainment, and equally overstuffed
with things to attract, but not keep, our attention,</P>
