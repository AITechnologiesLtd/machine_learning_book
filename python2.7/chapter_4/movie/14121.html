<P>Susan Granger's review of "DANCE WITH ME" (Columbia Pictures: Sony Releasing)</P>
<P>
It's curious that the dethroned 1984  Miss America, Vanessa L. Williams,
has probably made a more memorable career for herself than the majority
of bland, pretty faces who have worn the Atlantic City crown. (She lost
her title after nude photos were published in "Penthouse" magazine.)</P>
<P>In her new movie, "Dance With Me," she does the older woman/younger
man samba with Puerto Rican pop singing sensation Chayanne. She plays
a sulky single mom who, having been dumped by her abusive professional
dancing partner (Rick Valenzuela), teaches two-step classes to Texans
at a Houston studio owned by Kris Kristofferson. Along comes sensuous
Chayanne, as an ambitious Cuban immigrant (think young Desi Arnaz),
and Vanessa's inner rhythms start beating Babaloo! Little does she
know that this sizzling handyman from Havana is really Kristofferson's
son - of course, no one else knows it either. The muddled,
cliche-ridden soap opera story, written by choreographer Daryl
Matthews and directed by Randa Haines ("Children of a Lesser God"),
revolves around losers becoming winners as the competitive beat goes
on, culminating in the predictable, show-stopping dance-contest
finale. And there's a brief homage to the late, great Gene Kelly as
Chayanne dances through lawn sprinklers a la "Singing in the Rain."
But, if you want to see this kind of film even better made, I
recommend "Strictly Ballroom" (1992), a witty, spirited, Australian
musical, directed by Baz Luhrmann ("Romeo and Juliet"). On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Dance With Me" is a spicy, schmaltzy 6 with a
tangy salsa beat.</P>
