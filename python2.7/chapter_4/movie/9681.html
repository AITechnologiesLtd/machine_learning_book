<PRE>                                       BEAN</PRE>
<P>Rowan Atkinson who has the title role in BEAN was supposed to have
been an electrical engineer but somewhere along the way he had more
of the slapstick comedian in him, the silent stars type, and in 1970
made his debut as a performer.   Despite being around since then,
and despite being famous in England as well as having been in the
films FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, NEVER SAY NEVER
AGAIN, THE TALL GUY and THE WITCHES, he is not as well-known
 in the States except for cable TV.    BEAN will change all that.</P>
<P>Bean is silent.  The only sounds to come out of his mouth are weird
grunts.  The other actors, plagued by BEAN, do not remain silent.
How could they?   Bean's job as a guard in an art gallery requires
that he just sit in a chair.  Unfortunately, that is too much of a
chore so the alternative is to fire him.   However, Bean has a
friend, a benefactor to the museum, whom the Board of Directors would
not want to offend.   One of the board members conceives the idea of
getting rid of bean, at least for a while, by commissioning him to
deliver a $50 million painting (Whistler's Mother) to a new gallery
in the United States.   Further, he is passed off as an art expert.
Needless to add, the painting does not quite make it to its owner in
its original.</P>
<P>Atkinson pulls out all the comic stops in BEAN.  Falling off a chair
in the art gallery, making himself in a unique manner some real
instant coffee for breakfast as he is late to work, and shaving with
an electric razor his whole face including his tongue are
hysterically funny.   A most difficult trick is to sustain that kind
of humor throughout an entire film.  At that, the film is not
entirely successful despite other antics that pop up throughout the
movie.     However, it is still great fun.</P>
<P>Others in the cast include the art historian of the U.S. gallery
(Peter MacNichol), his wife (Pamela Reed) and their daughter
(Tricia Vessey) and son (Andrew  J Lawrence).   It is in their home
that BEAN stays during his Los Angeles visit.  Not since THE MAN 
WHO CAME TO DINNER was a family so harassed and made
 furious by their guest who was only trying to help.</P>
<PRE>A very funny movie.</PRE>
