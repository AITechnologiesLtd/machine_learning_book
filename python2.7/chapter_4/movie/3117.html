<PRE>                            THE LAST SEDUCTION
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule: Even without a good story, this film would
          be fascinating if only for the characterization of
          Bridget Gregory.  Linda Fiorentino plays a
          brilliant, calculating, manipulative woman.  Steve
          Barancik has written a taut, steamy murder thriller
          that has already played on cable and is now getting
          only a tiny theatrical release.  THE LAST SEDUCTION
          is worth seeking out.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Last year RED ROCK WEST, directed by John Dahl, went directly to
video, then got a small theatrical release based on very good word of
mouth.  It fact, it was a nice little thriller that deserved much
better treatment.  That was unfortunate.  But when Dahl's THE LAST
SEDUCTION got the same treatment this year it was nearly criminal.  I
am sorry I missed it on HBO, but it was worth paying to see in a
theater.  This steamy crime thriller with tight and fascinating script
by Steve Barancik is far better than the average run of theatrical
films.</P>
<P>     Bridget Gregory (played by Linda Fiorentino) is as cold and
calculating a woman as has ever has been shown on the screen.  She is
as quick-thinking and amoral as a computer.  Gregory instantly sizes up
situations and subtly manipulates people and events to her own
advantage.  She works for insurance companies as a "lead generator,"
someone who is able to find potential customers for her company.  And
she must be good at her job based on the sampling we see.  Just as a
demonstration of her abilities she takes a credit history database and
in a chillingly logical manner generates a list of women who would be
anxious to have their husbands murdered.  The method makes sufficient
sense that one almost worries that some viewer will copy the method in
real life.  This is a female Hannibal Lecter whose fixation is making
money rather than on cannibalism and mutilation,  And because her
desires are so normal, she is much harder to catch.</P>
<P>     As the film opens Bridget does her thing for a New York City
insurance company while her physician husband, Clay (Bill Pullman)
pulls off a dangerous but lucrative drug deal that Bridget has master-
minded.  Hubby comes home with lots of cash, only to have his loving
wife take the money and run.  She is headed to Chicago, but to avoid
thugs hired by her husband, she lays low in Beston, a suburb of
Buffalo.  She picks up one of the locals, Mike Swale (Peter Berg) as a
bedmate to use with approximately the same consideration she would give
a vibrator.  Under Dahl's direction the sex scenes are often explicit
and erotic.  Some of the violence scenes are also fairly graphic.</P>
<P>     Fiorentino plays Bridget like a breed of spider.  She is purely
cold and calculating, the epitome of sang froid.  Peter Berg seems
sufficiently young and naive to fall into her web.  And Bill Pullman,
who was pushed around by the woman in his life in RUTHLESS PEOPLE, here
plays someone a lot smarter but still totally out-classed.
J. T. Walsh, who has becoming a very familiar screen heavy, plays a
crooked lawyer who can only look on with envy at what Bridget can do.</P>
<P>     Fiorentino makes this film as exciting a thriller as we have seen
this year.  This is film noir with a vengeance with a femme fatale who
could give lessons to Stanwick in DOUBLE INDEMNITY and Turner in BODY
HEAT.  Watch for it.  I give this film a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
