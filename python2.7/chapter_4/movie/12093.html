<PRE>THE SPANISH PRISONER (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: David Mamet
Starring: Campbell Scott, Rebecca Pidgeon, Steve Martin, Ricky Jay, Ben
Gazzara, Felicity Huffman, Ed O'Neill</P>
<P>There's a scene towards the middle of David Mamet's "The Spanish Prisoner"
where the protagonist, Joe Ross (Campbell Scott, sans Stanley Tucci for a
change), discovers that everything he did in the first half of the film
will get him in a whole lot of trouble he may not be able to squirm his way
out of.  The big deal with this is it took me off guard as well.  Viewing
this film is like viewing two films which work hand in hand: one's an
interesting film where we see a working man get the taste of hobnobbing
with a rich yet somewhat creepy businessman; the second is like something
out of a Kafka story.</P>
<P>In fact, "The Spanish Prisoner"'s second half really resembles last year's
amazing David Fincher flick, "The Game," where a cynical business man had
his life toyed with by an unknown assailant.  I remember that film as being
incredible fun, yet having so many plot holes that it could not be taken
seriously (just for the record, I'm not holding that against it at all: it
was more like artistic liscence than some really bad slip-up on the
writers' part, and it was one of the best films of last year).  "The
Spanish Prisoner" is a lot like that film, although its first half is so
subtle that the second half comes off as a huge shock, almost as much as it
is for the character.</P>
<P>"The Spanish Prisoner" is an art house, low budget thriller, as much as I
can see, that deals with several frightening nightmares, such as knowing
that what you've done in your past will doom your future, not being able to
escape evidence of something you did not commit, feeling like everyone is
against you, and not being able to wash blood off of yourself.  Mamet, as
the screenwriter (as well as director) picks a totally innocent character
as the poor guy to take the big gradual fall, and surorund him with a wide
assortment of characters who may or may not be working against him,
although it's impossible to detect until it's too late.  It's a film that
twists and turns and leaves the audience leaving with a big smile, knowing
that you've survived an intelligent rollar coaster ride of a flick.</P>
<P>But before I go on, let me recap the plot: a hard-working business man,
Joe, travels to a Carribbean island with his working pal, George (Ricky
Jay, who was recently the cameraman from "Boogie Nights"), and his new very
blunt secretary who has a thing for him, Susan (Mamet's wife, Rebecca
Pidgeon), and there runs into a mysterious rich man, Jimmy Dell (Steve
Martin, in a performance so eerily subtle that it just may be his best
acting in a film), who befriends him, and carries on the friendship later
on in New York.</P>
<P>After about an hour of this, the film takes a weird 180 degree turn, and
the film suddenly becomes frightening and crazy.  It's nothing like the
events that happen to Michael Douglas in "The Game," like being shot at, or
being trapped inside a runaway taxi.  It's more like things that seem so
subtle that it's pretty understandable that Joe would not be able to see
them ahead of him.  And there are no plot holes (or "artistic liscences"
for the plot), giving this film a more realistic and scarier feel, mostly
because the events could happen to anyone,  which is extremely effective in
creating tension.</P>
<P>But the really amazing thign about this film is how the first half, which
seems kind of boring while you're watching it, never gives any sign of the
second half coming along.  Some may call this being choppy and dock points
from the film; others (like me) realize that this was essential in creating
an effective second half.  This is not like "The Game," but is really an
intelligent, realistic, and playful film which attempts to toy with the
audience the same way that Joe is being toyed with by showing no one's
perspective but his, and thus taking us off guard as well as him.</P>
<P>If you don't know who David Mamet is, he's one of the best writers working
today, not only writing films (his most recent jobs where for "Wag the Dog"
and "The Edge," and he has directed other films of his own, like "House of
Games," to which this has been compared), but also award-winning plays like
"Glengarry Glenn Ross" and "American Buffalo" (both which have been made
into films).  His dialogue is some of the best written, not because it
sounds realistic, but because it is so playful and easily defines the
characters who speak them.  Here, his dialogue is in tact (some lines are
definite intelligent quotables), but he also shows that he's a master at
plotting.  "The Spanish Prisoner" unfolds brilliantly, shocking us at every
twist and turn, and never insulting our intelligence (it should also be
noted that this film is PG, which shocked the hell out of me, especially
after seeing the "fuck"-fest that was "Glengarry Glenn Ross" - guess he's
trying to expand his horizons or something).</P>
<P>And as with many other Mamet films, the acting is superb.  Campbell Scott
is stiff, but so's his character, and he's easily sympathetic.  Rebecca
Pidgeon delivers a witty performance, all the more admirable as the film
goes on.  She has several scenes where she's so straight forward that it's
comical.  Ricky Jay, who's becoming more and more prominent in films lately
(in addition to "Boogie Nights," he also played a small role in the latest
Bond flick, "Tomorrow Never Dies," as a computer hacker), perfectly speaks
the language of Mamet (which is like a whole other kind of dialogue, kinda
other-worldly).  Also, look for Al Bundy himself, Ed O'Neill, in a one
scene role which is surprisingly effective.  Glad to see him working again
since the cancellation of his, um, show.</P>
<P>But shockingly enough, the actor who really steals the show is...Steve
Martin.  As the subtlely creepy Jimmy Dell, he oozes with a shocking
greatness, and a knack for really fleshing out Mamet's dialogue.  Martin's
an excellent comic actor, but, like Robin Williams, he seems to also want
to show that he can do very effective dramatic leg work as well.  And like
Williams, he's amazing, restraining all his wild and crazy antics, and
turning in a performance which is just plain fun to watch, and even comical
in a different way than he's used to.  He's not great because he's Steve
Martin doing drama; he's great because he's amazing.</P>
<P>But the real star of the film is Mamet, who designs the film so well that
it's probably the most effective and just plain entertaining films of the
year thus far.  It's the kind of film where you shake with the protagonist,
experience all their scares, and come out just as drained as the hero does.
 And when a character nightmares become the audience's nightmares, well
that's a film that has really become effective.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
