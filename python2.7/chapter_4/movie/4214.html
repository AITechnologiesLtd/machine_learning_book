<PRE>                                  COPYCAT
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Released too close to SEVEN and
     suffering heavily by comparison, this is the story of
     another serial killer with a theme to his killings.  In
     this case the killer is imitating famous serial killers
     of the past.  But here the killer's personal theme is
     more McGuffin and less the driving force of the plot.
     Too much of this film falls into the realm of "woman in
     distress versus stalker" cliche.  Over-rated
     performances by Weaver and Hunter are sufficient, but
     not memorable.  Rating: low +1 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     As serial killer films go, COPYCAT is above average in gloss and
suspense, but it was disastrous to release it just a few weeks after
SEVEN.  What this film does best, SEVEN did even better.  Both were
about serial killers whose crimes formed a pattern.  In SEVEN that
pattern really drove the plot, in this film the theme makes the
killings more interesting, but it is much less essential to the plot.
While that film had a dark atmosphere of impending evil, this film is
slick and wastes the viewer's time with familiar sequences of the
killer stalking and terrorizing his victim in traditional fashion.</P>
<P>     Popular crime psychologist Helen Hudson (played by Sigourney
Weaver) is severely traumatized by an all-too-close encounter with
killer Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick, Jr.).  She has retreated into
her overly-gorgeous apartment and refuses to leave.  A little over a
year later there is another serial killer and hard-as-nails police
detective M. J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) reluctantly enlists Hudson's
help to hunt down the killer.  Unfortunately the killer has decided
that Hudson is the victim he most wants to see as a trophy.  While he
recreates the crimes of the great serial killers of the past he is also
zeroing in on Hudson.  Like Rex Stout, Hudson tries to solve the crime
without ever leaving her apartment but her agoraphobia also makes hera
sitting target for the killer.</P>
<P>     If it sounds too much like every other serial killer film on
cable, the story is a bit more complex, but not a lot.  There is some
interest value in Hunter's performance as the tough cop.  If it were a
man in the role it would not merit a second glance, but the casting of
Hunter gives this film a bit more attention than it really deserves.
This story of a formula killer is written by Ann Biderman and David
Madsen, themselves no slouches in following formulae.  How do they
express that Hudson has a sterile intellect?  She listens to opera, of
course.  How do they turn up the tension?  Well, have the killer stalk
Hudson while she is vulnerable in the shower.  How do we make the
killer a formidable opponent?  Well give him any talent or ability he
needs to carry the plot.  This is a man who is a technical expert, an
expert housebreaker, a terrific computer hacker, and someone who can
arrange convenient coincidences as the occasion requires.  He seems
clever by mandate of the scriptwriter, not because he impresses us with
his thought processes.  Director Jon Amiel is not known for suspense
work in the past, his best known work being TV's "The Singing
Detective" and SOMMERSBY.  His first foray into suspense just pushes a
lot of familiar buttons.</P>
<P>     COPYCAT may not be a copycat film, but much too much has been done
before and much too much of the tense climactic sequence is
telegraphed.  This is a disappointing low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
