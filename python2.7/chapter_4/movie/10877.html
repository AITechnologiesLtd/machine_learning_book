<PRE>                               PHANTOMS
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: An evil older than life on Earth
          takes possession of a Colorado town in a horror
          film featuring Peter O'Toole.  The popular horror
          novelist Dean R. Koontz adapts one of his most
          enjoyable novels, but it loses a great deal on its
          way to the screen.  All of the gunfire is here, but
          the intriguing possibilities are sadly toned down.
          Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to +4)  A Heavy
          Duty Spoiler follows the review, but I really want
          to discuss the ideas.</PRE>
<PRE>          New York Critics: 1 positive, 5 negative, 0 mixed</PRE>
<P>     If you are going to take a long novel and adapt it for the screen,
you are essentially cutting it to the length of a novelette.  Something
has to go.  It must have been a painful task for Dean Koontz to cut
down the scope of his novel.  He had to make a lot of choices as to
what would play to a horror film audience.  I remember consciously
thinking when I read the novel PHANTOMS that I would have been willing
to go through everything in the novel up to this point, all the horror,
if I could just be in on this one conversation between a human and...
well... something that was definitely a long way beyond human.  That
moment--chapters long in the book--either did not make it to the film
or passes by so quickly that it is hardly noticeable.  The moments when
something violent or repulsive is happening seem to go on forever, but
my little moment with its sense of wonder seems to have been pushed
aside.  Shame on you, Mr. Koontz, for not recognizing what was really
unique powerful about your own novel.  Instead we have one more horror
film with grisly gore and in-your-face special effects.  On the other
hand, at least it is played seriously.  This is all material that could
have been played for laughs and perhaps the film's greatest strength is
that it was not  If anyone is going to treat Koontz's ideas seriously,
it is going to be Koontz.</P>
<P>     Dr. Jennifer Pailey (played by Joanna Going) lives in the high
Colorado town of Snowfield.  She brings her sister Lisa (Rose McGowan)
to the town for a visit and to get her away from the corrupting
influence of life in Los Angeles.  She does not imagine that what she
is bringing Lisa to is far worse than what she is leaving. Their first
discovery on arriving is that Jenny's landlady is lying dead on the
floor of her home, her skin having turned strange colors.  It is quite
a shock, and it is only the first.  When they go to report it to the
police, the officer on duty is dead with identical symptoms.  Most of
the town is empty and those that are still there are dead.  This
explains why the streets seem so quiet.  As in ANDROMEDA STRAIN they
find that whenever it happened, whatever "it" was, some people died
immediately and some went slowly insane. Finally after wandering the
museum of horror that had been Snowfield, they find three living
people, the sheriff (played by Ben Affleck) and his two deputies, also
returning from out of town.  As they investigate they find the
telephones will connect them only with a mumbling presence, but
whatever killed the town is still present and still a danger.  More
exploration turns up no new survivors, but a cryptic message "Timothy
Flyte the Ancient Enemy."  It is on this clue that the whole
understanding of the nature of the menace will hinge.  Eventually the
military is informed of what has happened and they enter the town to
find out what has happened.  The Army brings in a scientist (Peter
O'Toole) with an oddball theory as to what happened to Snowfield, tying
it into previously unexplained historical incidents.</P>
<P>     The cast is of lesser-known actors, all but Ben Affleck and, of
course, Peter O'Toole.  Frankly, great actors are not really needed
here, though the script calls for some, the doctor and the sheriff,
perhaps to be a little older than the very young actors featured in
this film.  Under the direction Joe Chappelle the principles give their
lines but add little to the film beyond acting menaced.  There is only
one actor who has to go beyond that.  Peter O'Toole has to act the role
of a latter-day Dr. Van Helsing, a joke in the scientific community but
with the spark of an idea that might explain a lot of history.  He has
to walk a gentle tightrope between being wise and being a little
unstrung.  That is the same tightrope that O'Toole had to walk in
LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and in spite of my initial skepticism on seeing him
in the role, perhaps he was just what it needed.</P>
<P>     PHANTOMS runs its good ideas past the viewer much too fast, but at
least they are there.  It feels like a very much scaled down version of
the novel.  I give it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and high +1 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
<P>     Spoiler...Spoiler...Spoiler...Spoiler.. .</P>
<P>     What is nicely done in the film but far better in the book is how
the theories of the nature of the enemy change in the course of the
book.  It starts seeming like some sort of disease, a la THE ANDROMEDA
STRAIN.  Then it appears more malevolent and seems like some sort of
shape-changer.  Then the characters realize they are in contact with,
and talking to, the force of evil going back to the beginning of time.
They are essentially in conversation with the Devil and it is affably
talking to them.  Think of what an opportunity that would be.  The film
sort of flashes over it, but what if you really could discuss history
with the force behind all evil.  Suppose you could discuss history with
a being that has been here since the beginnings of time, marshaling the
most powerful side in the battle between good and evil.  What would you
ask first?  I mean this would be better than getting Saddam Hussein on
MEET THE PRESS.  Finally the concept transforms again to come up with a
science fictional explanation for the Devil through the ages and even
that concept is intriguing.  It is much muted in this adaptation, but
even in the film some intriguing possibilities come through.</P>
