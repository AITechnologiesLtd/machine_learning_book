<PRE>                           AIRFORCE ONE</PRE>
<P>You must know that you are in for a thrill when the director of
one of the best films ever made, DAS BOOT, is in charge.  No one
compares to Wolfgang Petersen when it comes to making superb
films.   Witness, in addition to DAS BOOT, IN THE LINE OF FIRE and
OUTBREAK. Petersen, assisted by a great cast, does not disappoint.
AIRFORCE ONE, from beginning to end, is one frantic, tense action
film.</P>
<P>President John Marshall (Harrison Ford) has frequently proclaimed
that to give in to terrorists only invites more terrorism.  If he
is ever faced with a decision about terrorists, his message is
clear.  But what happens when his wife (Wendy Crewson) and teen
aged daughter (Liesel Matthews) are being held hostage aboard the
supposedly secure Airforce One, the President's plane? Perhaps not
quite as easy to be objective. That is exactly what faces President
Marshall.</P>
<P>Aided by a traitor on the staff of the President's security team,
a group of terrorists is allowed on the plane. They are supposed
to be a camera crew.   Soon after takeoff, they hijack the plane
and take everyone prisoner, except for the President himself who
is in hiding.   Leader of the terrorists is Ivan Korshunov (Gary
Oldman with a very, very thick Russian accent) who wants the
President to get the release of Gen. Alexander Radek (Jurgen
Prochnow . . . who was the captain in DAS BOOT).  Radek is a
tyrant who has been taking advantage of the chaos in Russia since
they were freed of the Communist yoke.   Gen. Radek is in a
Russian prison.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, back in Washington, D.C., Vice President Kathryn Bennett
(Glenn Close) is trying to find out what is happening.  When she
becomes aware of the demands, she phones Russian President Petrov
(Alan Woolf) to release Radek so President Marshall will not be
harmed. . . but Petrov says he is unable to do that.</P>
<P>But this is an action thriller and President Marshall is a capable
opponent of terrorists as he has served with distinction in Viet
Nam and knows how to handle himself in tough, dangerous
situations.   Harrison Ford is utterly believable as he hides in
various parts of the huge plane, shoots automatic weapons at the
enemy when he has a chance, wrestles with the terrorists while
hanging near an open hatch.  A little humor (very little) is
injected when Marshall throws one of the terrorists out the hatch,
exclaiming, "Get off my plane."</P>
<P>Exciting film.  Great cast.  You will not want to miss this one.
Other supporting roles are by Paul Guilfoyle, Xander Berkeley.
Wm. H. Macy, Dean Stockwell, Tom Everett and many others too
numerous to mention.</P>
<PRE>        Directed by the one and only Wolfgang Petersen.</PRE>
