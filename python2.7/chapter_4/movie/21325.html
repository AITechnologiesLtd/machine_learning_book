<PRE>DUST IN THE WIND (1987)
by George Wu
Rating: **** (out of 4)</PRE>
<P>The Hou Hsiao-hsien retrospective at New York's Walter Reade theater is
doubtlessly one of 1999's movie-going highlights.  The Taiwanese Hou is
perhaps the greatest director of the past two decades, yet because of the
state of foreign film distribution in the United States, none of his films
have received commercial release here.  Instead, we cinephiles have been
left to discover his extraordinary works at museums and festivals.  I had
seen about half of his repertoire before this retro, but it was still
revelatory.</P>
<P>In Hou's work, one can visibly trace his cinematic influences, and in turn,
he has influenced many others.  Hou has a style somewhere between
Michelangelo Antonioni and Yasujiro Ozu enhanced by Hou's own striking
sense of camera placement and framing.  His mostly provincial subject
matter would also do Italian Neorealists such as Vittorio De Sica and
Roberto Rossellini proud.  Like De Sica in his earlier films, Hou uses
mostly nonprofessional actors.  Some of Hou's most verbal supporters
include directors Olivier Assayas and Kore-eda Hirokazu, both of whom have
shot documentaries on him.  To be more like his Chinese filmmaking idols,
Hou and Edward Yang, Hirokazu now inverts his name so that his surname
appears first in credits, which is contrary to Japanese convention.  Along
with Hirokazu's beautiful Maborosi, Tsai Ming-liang's Rebels of a Neon God
and Bruno Dumont's La vie de Jesus are particularly obvious descendents of
Hou's work.</P>
<P>Given American ideology's emphasis on individuality, this country's
filmmakers put the camera's focus on the character above all else.  Hou,
however, with his careful framing, long takes and long shots accentuates
space and environment while depicting character.  This greater sense of
place shows how characters are inextricably bound to their surroundings
which contribute as much to who and what they are as their own actions.  In
Dust in the Wind, for example, in one take, long shot with no camera
movement, Hou shows us some old men sitting on the front steps of a house
during a sudden electrical black out.  A loud bang comes from within the
house puzzling the men.  The wife of the house hysterically enters frame
left and rushes up the steps inside.  We hear her talking to old Grandpa,
who appears in the doorway cursing about how he mistook a firecracker for a
candle.  Not only is this funny, but it feels more real as Hou keeps us
detached in our role of observer yet involved in caring for what happens to
these people.</P>
<P>Dust in the Wind is about Wan and his girlfriend, Huen, who quit their jobs
in their small mining town of Jio-fen and move to Taipei to find work.  Wan
becomes a delivery boy while Huen assists a seamstress.  Wan is a little
too proud for his own good, but is earnest in taking care of the
introverted Huen.  He can barely take care of himself however.  Hou makes
an apparent reference to De Sica's Bicycle Thief when Wan finds his
motorcycle stolen.  His resulting depression leads him to wander in the
rain, getting him a case of bronchitis.  Then he finds himself drafted by
the army.</P>
<P>Hou collaborated with Chu T'ien-wen, who has written or co-written all of
Hou's films, to give Dust in the Wind marvelously vivid details.  Upon
first moving to Taipei, Huen asks Wan what he thinks about various shoes in
a store.  After selecting a pair they both like, Wan finds that Huen is not
asking for herself but for her family.  She pulls out pieces of paper with
the outlines of her family's feet traced on them so she can buy them the
right sized shoes.  Dust in the Wind is filled with these little vignettes
revealing the struggles as well as the savored moments of everyday life in
Taiwan.  The film never romanticizes or sentimentalizes though it is filled
with beauty, even of the ugly sort.  Many images -- the characters marching
up to their hillside home next to a mountain cast in the shadows of passing
clouds, a Buddhist ritual in front of a raging ocean, soldiers silhouetted
against an overcast sky -- are breathtaking.  Dust in the Wind, being more
diffuse and directionless than its predecessor The Time to Live and the
Time to Die, ultimately doesn't equal that film's impact.  It is
nevertheless, one of the best films of the 1980s.</P>
<P>Hou's films have only now finally found video distribution in the U.S., but
they will have none of their impact on the big screen.  The travesty is
that most will never have the opportunity to view them as they should be
seen.  This Lincoln Center retrospective helps to correct that a little
bit.</P>
