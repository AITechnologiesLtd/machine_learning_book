<P>Instinct is a good movie trapped in a gorilla suit of derivative clichés
and plodding ideas. The result is an occasionally powerful, extremely
well acted movie that never finds a confident emotional center.</P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins is a marvelous actor, with a screen presence that
commands all of the viewer's attention toward him. At first glance of
his role as Ethan Powell, a mentally disturbed anthropologist, you may
think Hopkins is reprising his role as Hannibal Lector from The Silence
of the Lambs. The character does have some of the same grisly
mannerisms, but there is one big difference: he doesn't eat people.
Still, Powell has killed two park rangers and wounded three others,
while studying gorillas on location in the jungles of Rwanda.</P>
<P>Called in to investigate is a young, idealistic shrink named Theo
Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.), who (predictably) goes at the assignment as
if it were a walk in the park. From here, Instinct relies on the study
of human behavior for interesting material. It's unfortunate that the
movie never displays it's own humanity that strongly. There are isolated
moments of sheer power, care of Hopkins and his dedicated performance,
but the film's heart is rarely in the right place at the right time.
Instinct is too uneven to be rightfully enjoyed.</P>
<P>The material here may have been rendered laughable if it weren't for the
acting abilities of the two leads. Anthony Hopkins is excellent, and
Gooding Jr. shows fierce optimism for scene after scene of his demanding
role. Another disappointment is the lack of background supplied for the
character of Theo Caulder. We're told that he's a hot shot shrink on the
way up, but we never find out if he has a family, nor are we informed of
his roots in the psychiatric business. Donald Sutherland has a minor
role as Gooding's mentor and boss.</P>
<P>Even if the acting in Instinct is exceptional, it still cannot salvage
the rest of the film. The storyline is similar to countless others, like
Tarzan and The Shawshank Redemption, just to name a few. Scenes in which
we learn the explanation for Powell's psychotic behavior are undoubtedly
the most effective moments, but the presentation leaves much to be
desired.</P>
<P>Another conventional sub-plot involves Powell being reunited with his
daughter (Maura Tierney). But even as the film hovers around this
subject for a large portion of running time, the meeting at the end
lacks all the emotional potential that we were hoping for.</P>
<P>Instinct is not a bad film, but the misguided direction disables it from
shining through. Once you get past the powerful performances from the
two very capable actors, what you're left with is a troubled project
with no driving force whatsoever.</P>
