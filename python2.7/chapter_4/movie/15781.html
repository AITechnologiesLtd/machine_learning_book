<P>THE PRINCE OF EGYPT
A film by Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, and Simon Wells
With the voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helen 
Mirren, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Steve Martin, 
Martin Short, and Patrick Stewart</P>
<P>    THE PRINCE OF EGYPT, the long-awaited foray by Dreamworks Animation 
(and its head, Jeffrey Katzenberg), is an ambitious, enthralling epic 
whose faults don't undermine the power of the film.  Despite its 
mediocre songs and its rushed story, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT has much to 
recommend, and is an overpowering addition to the animated genre.  </P>
<P>The story is relatively simple.  During the Egyptians' killing of 
all newborn children, a young child is sent down a river, in hopes that 
he will find a home that will care for him.  The young child grows into 
a man, Moses (Kilmer), and together with his brother Ramses (Ralph 
Fiennes), is quite a palace troublemaker, until lhe sees two people who 
remind him of his past.  From that moment, Moses leaves the palace, and 
goes to find his true self.  On the way to that, he finds a little more 
than that: a burning bush, and the voice of God himself.  Moses is given 
a mission: to free the Hebrew slaves from the grasp of the Egyptians.</P>
<P>The story is developed rather a little too quickly.  This film, more 
than any other, deserved the full movie treatment of animation.  I found 
myself asking why didn't Jeffrey Katzenberg take animation to the next 
level by making his movie 2 hours long?  It would have been a better, 
more complete story.  Instead, the miracles of God are rushed into a 
compact 20 minutes.  I found myself looking at my watch midway through, 
wondering when the Red Sea was ever going to be parted.  The first half 
is quite good.  The chariot race sequence between Ramses and Moses is 
excellent, and the animation throughout the entire movie is top-notch.  
It is certainly a gorgeous movie to look at.</P>
<P>The voices are superb, but the only two that register are the two 
that matter.  Kilmer and Fiennes are great, as are Goldblum, Bullock, 
and Pfeiffer.  The relationship between Kilmer and Fiennes is essential, 
however.  It has to work for the film to work, and the development is 
exquisite.  The film adds the guilt on Moses as Ramses' son dies.  Moses 
knows he had to go through his ordeals, but he sees his brother suffer, 
and it is difficult to watch.  It is a great moment in animation.  There 
are in fact many of those moments, the best probably being the burning 
bush, which is a great piece of work.</P>
<P>The score is actually pretty good, although the songs are pretty 
mediocre.  The first song, "Deliver Us",wasn't too bad, and neither was 
the second, "River Flow Gently".  Much of the latter half of the film, 
beginning with Moses' departure from Egypt, is told in episodic fashion, 
like Martin Scorsese's KUNDUN, in the sense that songs are merely 
episodes, and the movie moves from episode to episode, in almost blocks 
of 5 minutes, telling the story by visuals instead of dialogue.  It 
works for the most part, although some of the songs don't.  The big 
number by Martin and Short is a failure, mostly because it feels like 
something out of ALADDIN.  The song sung by Danny Glover's character, 
and Moses' future father-in-law is also something that didn't exactly 
sit well with me, although the sequence was very well done.  Come the 
last, rushed third of the film, there are merely glimpses of things I 
wanted to see more.  All of God's plagues are told in one 4 minute 
sequence, the plague of the frogs and locusts.  These were truly 
frightening and scary.  Yet, it felt rushed.  I wanted more of this, I 
wanted more of this terror, because that was what God was inflicting 
upon the Egyptians, and Pharoah himself.  Certainly, visual wise they 
were exquisite, but if more had been available, the film would have been 
even more devastating as far as impact.</P>
<P>Certainly, the Red Sea sequence, the Burning Bush, and the sequence 
where God takees all of the Egyptian first born, are all spectacular.  
There is some true uneasiness when God kills so many.  There is a 
strange dichotomy during all of PRINCE OF EGYPT.  On one hand, the film 
wants to extend the borders of animation.  It wants to be so great, that 
it often is.  The terrorizing sequences attest to that fact.  The 
character development between Ramses and Moses (the only two characters 
that are developed) is sensational, and the effects are magnificent.  
This is meant to be a very serious movie, and it delivers at the end.  
But throughout the film, there is a sense of making this one "for the 
kids".  As a result, things like Martin Short's and Steve Martin's 
characters, their ridiculous production number, some of the songs, and 
MIchelle Pfeiffer's character (who looks a little too much like Disney's 
POCAHONTAS), are really annoying, and angered me deeply. If Dreamworks 
had stuck to its guns instead of competing with Disney, they could have 
made the greatest animated film of all time.  Add about 1/2 hour to an 
hour to it, show what happens to the Hebrews with the Ten Commandments, 
and take out about half the songs, and this is one hell of a movie.  
Still, the mature last half, and the spectacular last 20 minutes make 
this a damn good film.  Dreamworks could have done more, but what they 
did was pretty good itself. </P>
