                       A film review by Bryant Frazer

<P>MARIANNE, which world premiered at the "Rendez-Vous With
French Cinema Today" series in New York City March 15, is a
lithe adaptation of an unfinished novel by the French writer
Marivaux, an 18th century observer of courtship rituals and
the human emotions involved. But what's remarkable about the
film -- and what drew a sell-out crowd to the Walter Reade
Theater on opening night -- isn't so much its literary
pedigree. Rather, it's the pairing of director Benoit Jacquot
once more with Virginie Ledoyen, the hottest young thing in
French cinema and the star of Jacquot's LA FILLE SEULE (A SINGLE
GIRL), released last year to limited audiences but
wide acclaim. Taken together, the two movies seem nearly to
be companion pieces, a strong affirmation of the status of a
film's star as artistic collaborator with the director. The
differences between the two films are interesting, but the
similarities run deeper and give both pictures more distinct
meaning.</P>
<P>The footage that eventually became MARIANNE was actually shot
in 1994 and shown in a three-hour-long version on French
television, bearing Marivaux's original title of LA VIE DE
MARIANNE. But that version of the film is superseded, in the
director's eyes, by the 90-minute distillation that was shown
in New York. Jacquot agreed to make the film on the condition
that it would eventually make its way to a theatrical release
-- but in order to secure funding, he agreed to script a
longer television version at the same time. Jacquot told the
audience that he made no distinction between shooting for the
television screen and shooting for film -- if he wound up
with two different versions of the same shot, he kept the
superior one in reserve for the theatrical version and used
the inferior take for television.</P>
<P>Indeed, it's hard to imagine how this loveliest of movies
would be appreciated on the small screen. First, there's the
issue of Ledoyen's abiding beauty, which is magnified to
superhuman proportions on the big screen. My favorite example
is a scene which cuts between close-ups of her face and that
of the actor playing her suitor, Valville (sorry, no press
notes). Both young performers are handsome ("It's the face
that's important," Jacquot will snap later, when asked about
the challenges of shooting costume drama), but what's more
striking is the clarity of the image. Valville's face is
angles and ridges, sharply defined with only a hint of
menace. And Ledoyen's is all rich, gentle curves, the whites
of her eyes impossibly smooth and clean, like pools of milk.</P>
<P>Ledoyen's Marianne is an orphaned child whose story we follow
after she turns 15. Marianne has no idea who her parents
were, but believes she is of noble lineage and carries
herself with the bearing of an aristocrat who feels distaste
at the thought of consorting with the lower class. (It's to
Ledoyen's credit that she can bring this off without playing
a petulant brat.) She's taken in by an older man who, like
everyone in this film, is taken with her beauty. He puts her
up at the home of a linen merchant, where she finds some
degree of contentment. But soon he's confessing his love and
suggesting that she accept his offer of a private apartment
and a monthly paycheck. The thought of becoming a kept woman
both shocks and shames her, and instead she takes up
residence in a nearby convent. In the meantime, Valville has
also fallen in love with her, and while those attentions are
more to her liking, they will prove to make her life ever
more complicated.</P>
<P>While I could imagine where the television version probably
fleshed situations out a bit more, this story moves along at
a surprisingly lively clip. Costume dramas are rarely notable
for their brevity, but this one is imbued with a spirit and
humor that highlights the fogeyism of, say, your typical
Merchant Ivory production. Jacquot's direction, which is here
very theatrical and there distinctly cinematic, has a lot to
do with the film's airy tone. One scene between Marianne and
her would-be benefactor is played nearly as stagebound farce,
with the camera panning to and fro to catch the two
characters tugging each another this way and that. Elsewhere,
Jacquot's camera will lurch suddenly toward a character's
face in a tracking move worthy of a Spielberg or Scorsese.
The end result is eminently watchable and hardly dull.</P>
<P>The effortlessly lush cinematography is its own pleasure, but
also augments the fine performances of everyone involved.
There's not a false note, even as men and women alike trip
over themselves to sing Marianne's praises -- how lovely she
is, and how pure of heart -- and even as the story treads
into the potentially maudlin territory of jealousy,
duplicity, and revenge.</P>
<P>But MARIANNE is truly accessible because of Ledoyen's
immensely appealing presence. Ledoyen plays her character as
an apparently guileless young woman with smarts in reserve.
More than a pretty face, she is, as Valville's mother
describes her early on, "alarmingly" beautiful. The camera
dances with her here the same way it does in A SINGLE GIRL.
It follows her down the street as men spin on their feet to
look her up and down and it lingers behind her, evoking the
stare of villagers admiring her in church even as we gaze
upon the nape of her neck, 30 feet high, from our moviehouse
seats.</P>
<P>It's because her performance is as striking as her luminous
good looks that we do care what finally happens to Marianne.
The film may best be described as an anti-romance. Offers of
marriage come at our protagonist seemingly from all
directions, but we wind up rooting against her acceptance of
any of them. The story does finally culminate in a wedding --
but of Jacquot's invention, not Marivaux's.</P>
<P>"Marriage is a nightmare," the director told his audience
after the screening, with just the hint of a rakish grin
creeping onto his face. Whether you want to argue that or
not, it's hard not to notice that Jacquot's two most recent
films paint matrimony as something to be feared. But taken
together with A SINGLE GIRL, the basic moral of this tale
seems to be that a woman's independence is something for her
to cherish. In fact, those of us who believe in reincarnation
-- in the cinema, at least -- will likely get the distinct
feeling that A SINGLE GIRL functions in part to help set
Marianne free.<HR>Directed by Benoit Jacquot
