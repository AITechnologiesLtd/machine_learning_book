<PRE>SECRETS AND LIES</PRE>

<PRE>Written and Directed by Don Roos</PRE>
<PRE>With Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Affleck</PRE>
<PRE>PG-13 102 min.</PRE>
<PRE>2-1/2 chiles</PRE>
<P>One of the most enduring sub-genres of the romantic movie is the one 
where the relationship is entered into by one of the parties under false 
pretenses, and a secret hangs over the proceedings like a dark cloud 
which is going to have to flash some lightning and rumble some thunder 
and get everybody wet before the skies clear and the lovers kiss and 
make up. Often it's a bet the guy's made that he can woo and win (or 
these days, bed) the girl. Sometimes it's something darker and more 
personal, as in this year's "Return to Me", where Minnie Driver keeps 
putting off telling David Duchovny that she's wearing his late wife's 
heart.20</P>
<P>Writer/director Don Roos, the indie auteur of the quirky "The Opposite 
of Sex", has chosen to fly these friendly skies in his second outing, a 
formulaic weeper that waffles between clever charm and awkward writing 
and is largely rescued by its two stars, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben 
Affleck. Their job is made more difficult by some contrived situations, 
a few tin-eared speeches, and an end game with the subtlety of a rubber 
boat full of explosives. But these two have the talent, appeal, and 
chemistry (reinforced by real-life tabloid gossip) to almost pull it 
off.</P>
<P>It is a rule of movies that if somebody gives you his seat on a plane, 
that plane will surely go down, a rule Tony Goldwyn would have done well 
to brush up on. He doesn't, the plane does, and the result is a grieving 
widow in L.A., and a guilt-ridden ad exec, the guy who gave up the seat, 
watching the news in the Chicago airport hotel with a shapely stranded 
fellow traveler.</P>
<P>The air disaster sends Buddy Amaral (Affleck) into a downward spiral of 
alcoholism. He's part owner of "the hottest little ad agency on the 
coast," for whom he's just closed a contract with Infinity Airlines 
before their plane crashes. (Roos shows a weakness for meaningful names 
- Amaral is amoral, and infinity is just where the passengers go.) Heavy 
drinking leads Buddy into some inappropriate behavior vis-vis the 
client, and his partner/boss (Joe Morton) steers him into a rehab 
clinic.</P>
<P>When he gets out, it's been a year since the crash, and in running over 
his 12-step AA manual he is struck by #9, which enjoins him to make 
amends wherever possible. So he looks up the widow Abby (Paltrow) to see 
if there isn't something he can do for her, and it turns out there is. 
They meet cute, if you can find cuteness in the jaws of an attack 
Rottweiler, and he manages to throw some real estate business her way. 
(The dog's name is also Buddy, which raises complications, but none as 
great as those inherent in the name itself: a line like "What is it you 
want, Buddy?" hits the ear differently than it would if his name were, 
say, Howard.)</P>
<P>The movie takes pains to show the pains he takes not to get involved 
with her after his 9th step intervention, but the centrifugal force of 
true love is too strong. And soon we're in a Situation. Roos handles it 
well, with a slick romanticism reminiscent of the golden days of 
Hollywood when romantic clichE9s had a good name, when stars like Grant =
and Stanwyck and Stewart and Davis stamped their indelible personae on 
contrived smiling-through-the-tears material. Affleck and Paltrow are up 
to that standard. He makes a credible transition from glib, shallow jerk 
to sensitive male, and she handles her role with remarkable subtlety, 
rejecting easy sympathy while managing to show an irresistible 
vulnerability. It's a beautiful performance that confirms her 
Oscar-winning talents.</P>
<P>Movies are easier to begin than to end, but there's no excuse for the 
depths to which this one sinks in its plot-resolving scene, which 
involves courtroom testimony and Court TV. There have been problem 
moments before in the story, but after this clunker, even the winning 
grace of the actors can't keep it aloft, and the worn places begin to 
show like threadbare patches of carpet when the furniture is moved. 
There is also a sense of things inserted as plot devices, and of parts 
of characters and situations that may have been jettisoned to keep the 
bounces a little more buoyant.20</P>
<P>Still, for most of its modest length "Bounce" lopes along with the 
smooth, easy ride of a polished genre picture. On the whole Roos is 
better at the high points - when he goes for the tear ducts he falls a 
little short. The movie benefits from a solid supporting cast. Caroline 
Aaron is all knowing sympathy as Abby's best friend, the usually 
villainous Tony Goldwyn has a chance here to show his nice side, and the 
always-welcome Joe Morton is gruff but caring. Johnny Galecki as Buddy's 
brash recovering alcoholic gay assistant almost steals the show, except 
that his alcoholism and gayness, inserted as if meaningful, are never 
revisited.20</P>
<P>When the shoe falls, as it must, just before Buddy summons the courage 
to confess his secret, it falls with the kind of timing God leaves to 
screenwriters. But after all, it is a movie; and for all its failings, 
it's one that almost rises above pleasant to achieve the level of good.20</P>
