<P>     Bette Midler is not the star of THAT OLD FEELING, and neither is
Dennis Farina.  Actually, that's not entirely true.  Midler _is_ a star,
which is why she gets lead billing, and Farina is at least a recognizable
face, which is why he gets second billing.  THAT OLD FEELING isn't really
about Midler and Farina, however, which is why is needs some kind of
warning for unsuspecting audiences.  Call it the A TIME TO KILL Memorial
Disclaimer:  "The big star getting lead billing is actually playing a
supporting role, and the previews are remarkably deceptive."  Instead of
getting a brassy broad starring in a brassy broad farce, viewers will find
a surprisingly mellow comedy starring someone named Paula Marshall.  It is
only because Marshall is so charming that THAT OLD FEELING doesn't fall
flat on its mellowness.</P>
<P>     Marshall plays Molly DeMauro, a young woman who has just gotten
engaged to aspiring politician Keith (Jamie Denton).  It should be a
blissful time for Molly, except that she knows the wedding will mean
getting her divorced parents -- actress Lilly Leonard (Midler) and
novelist Dan DeMauro (Farina) -- together in the same place.  Dan and
Lilly's divorce was anything but amicable, and the expected shouting match
causes quite a spectacle at the reception.  Unexpectedly, the shouting
becomes smooching, as the feuding ex-spouses find their animosity turning
into animal attraction.  This development causes no end of trouble, as
Keith fears the scandal will harm is Congressional campaign, and Dan and
Lilly's new spouses -- interior designer Rowena (Gail O'Grady) and
self-help author Alan (David Rasche), respectively -- fear they will
become exes themselves.  It is left to Molly, accompanied by a tabloid
photographer named Joey (Danny Nucci), to track down parents who have had
the nerve to commit adultery with each other.</P>
<P>     The first half-hour certainly fosters the expectation that THAT OLD
FEELING is going to be a tart-tongued parade of family quarrels,
exaggerated characters and physical comedy.  The opening scene trots out
the familiar "woman swallows her surprise engagement ring in a desert"
scenario (seen most recently in Woody Allen's EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU),
but it is still goofy fun.  The wedding gives the sniping Dan and Lilly
some clever insults, and also introduces the one-dimensional characters
of their second spouses.  David Rasche is particularly funny as the
incessantly jargon-spewing touchy-feely therapist, who talks himself
hoarse and makes terribly sincere pronouncements about how important it is
"to dialogue and to language."  Director Carl Reiner keeps all these
elements under control, never allowing scenes to degenerate into pie
fights or prat-falls, while still keeping THAT OLD FEELING lively and
sharp-witted.</P>
<P>     That sharp wit is dulled, however, once Dan and Lilly run off
together, drastically reducing the level of comedic tension and shifting
the focus to Molly's quest for her parents and for her own romantic
happiness.  The story ends up emphasizing Molly's ambivalence over her
marriage to Keith, but the script by Leslie Dixon gives us no reason to
expect any problems between them until the plot arranges to separate them.
THAT OLD FEELING needs to lay more foundation for their incompatibility --
more early scenes of Molly's playful streak, more sense of Keith's stuffy
careerism and hypocrisy -- so that we understand the story is really going
to be about Molly.  As it stands, THAT OLD FEELING often seems disjointed.
The reunion of Dan and Lilly has little meaning besides as a plot device
to get Molly on the road with Joey, and Keith's drunken seduction of
Rowena becomes an afterthought to justify our distaste for him.  There is
too little conflict for too much of THAT OLD FEELING as we wait for Molly
to make her choice between Keith and Joey.</P>
<P>     Thank heavens Paula Marshall is such a find.  She is the kind of
actress who seems to be comfortable in any kind of scene, combining an
intelligent sexiness with a willingness to look completely silly; the
single funniest moment in THAT OLD FEELING may be a depressed Molly
drowning her sorrows in a mouthful of spray whipping cream.  There are
some very nice scenes between Marshall and Danny Nucci, whose photographer
begins as a supreme annoyance but gradually develops an adorably scruffy
puppy-dog quality, and Molly's romantic dilemma becomes interesting only
because Marshall makes her such a flustered sweetheart.  While Bette
Midler goes about the business of playing Bette Midler (including singing
a song) and Dennis Farina enjoys the chance to play against career-long
type-casting as a hoodlum, THAT OLD FEELING quietly becomes a showcase for
a talented young performer.  If you find yourself entertained by THAT OLD
FEELING, it may not be in the way you expect, or by whom you expect.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 side Bettes:  6.</PRE>
