<PRE>                            SINGIN' IN THE RAIN
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is film directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley
Donen and produced by Arthur Freed.  It was written by Adolph Green and
Betty Comden, based on a song by Freed and Nacio Herb Brown.  The film
stars Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, and Jean Hagen.
Choreography is by Kelly and Donen, the songs by Freed.  It was first
released on April 10, 1952.</P>
<P>     SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is simply the best movie musical ever made.  It
has started a Fortieth Anniversary revival run with a brand new 35mm
print.  You must see it.  It is like seeing it for the first time with
the brilliant, jewel-like Technicolor fresh and glowing, the print free
of scratches, up on the big screen, and Gene Kelly breaking your heart
with the pure innocent joy of his dance in the rain.</P>
<P>     If ever the word classic applied to a musical number, it applies to
the "Singin' in the Rain" number.  It starts off with a happy adult man
and ends with a little boy splashing in the flooded street and then
skipping off with not a care, free even of his umbrella.  Not only is
there a physical joy to watching Kelly dance in the rain, but it is a
revelation when you can distance yourself enough to watch the narrative
strength of the choreography, the detailed climb from adultness to
childishness.  If that cop hadn't shown up, Kelly would still be dancing
there; it's one number you want never to end, but when it does you are
as transformed as the dancer/singer.</P>
<P>     The song, according to one story, was inspired when Arthur Freed,
who had just graduated from Broadway High School in Seattle and opened
his own music store on Pine Street, watched a man one gloomy, rainy
Seattle afternoon outside his shop "just singing and dancing in the
rain."  He wrote the song with Nasio Herb Brown for one of the first big
movie musicals, THE HOLLYWOOD REVUE (MGM, 1929).  It has also been used
in LITTLE NELLIE KELLY (1940) and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971).</P>
<P>     Freed, later a top producer of musicals (THE WIZARD OF OZ, MEET ME
IN ST. LOUIS), hired Green and Comden (ON THE TOWN) to build a movie
around his song, now a standard.  It took them a month to nail down the
unifying concept: showcasing Brown and Freed songs against the
background they were written in, namely, Hollywood's transition to the
talkies.  The script was finished in April, 1951, Freed having selected
"Fit as a Fiddle," "You Were Meant for Me," "Good Mornin'," and nine
others.  Kelly created the fifteen-minute Broadway Melody ballet and
agreed to star in and co-direct.  Production closed Nov 21, 1951.  It
cost $2,540,800 to make ($620,996 over budget).  It previewed at the De
Anza Theater, Riverside, California, on December 21, to a rave audience.
It premiered at Grauman's Egyptian Theater instead of the more
prestigious Grauman's Chinese Theater, where the opening and closing
scenes were shot.  Apparently, the studio was not terribly supportive of
the film.  It turned out to be the tenth most popular film of 1952,
grossing $7,665,000.  However, it was received only two Oscar
nominations and won neither.</P>
<P>     Some other trivia about it: Green and Comden had originally seen it
as a vehicle for Howard Keel as a bit player in silent movies who
becomes a singing cowboy star.  This, of course, survives in the
stuntman sequence.  The song "Make 'em Laugh" was plagiarized from Cole
Porter's "Be a Clown," used in the Freed musical THE PIRATE.  Donen has
acknowledged that was "100 per cent plagiarism."</P>
<P>     A lot of you know that Jean Hagen, the screechy-voiced bimbo,
dubbed Debbie Reynolds, who is supposed to be dubbing Jean Hagen.  One
of the things I noticed this time around was how impressed I was by
Hagen's performance.  She was nominated for an Oscar for the role and
deservedly so.  It is easy to dismiss the part because she does such a
good job of making us dislike the character.</P>
<P>     Gene Kelly had a bad head cold during the filming of the Singin' in
the Rain sequence and was afraid, terrified, of developing pneumonia
during the two day shoot.  I noticed his voice was a little hoarse when
he says goodnight to Reynolds at the beginning of the sequence, but
otherwise one would never guess.</P>
<P>     The uncredited cameos include silent comedian Snub Pollard, "Our
Gang" kids Baby Patsy, Dale Odell, Roberta Williams, and Gerald
Carpenter, and 1930s star Mae Clark (of grapefruit fame).</P>
<P>     (A lot the above information I cribbed from William Arnold in the
Seattle P-I.)</P>
<P>     This Fortieth Anniversary tour is a rare opportunity to see one of
the great films of world cinema as it was meant to be seen.  In 1988 a
poll of world film critics placed SINGIN' IN THE RAIN fifth among the
world's best 100 films--CITIZEN KANE ranked ahead of it, but CASABLANCA
came in ninth.</P>
<PRE>     See this movie. Pay whatever it takes, but see it.</PRE>
