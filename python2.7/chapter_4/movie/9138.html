<PRE>SHALL WE DANCE?</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  ***1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>The opening narration of SHALL WE DANCE? informs us that Japan is a
nation of people who shy away from public or sometimes even private
displays of emotion.  Holding hands or saying "I love you" is a
blatant and shameful deed.  It is therefore that dancing, a pastime of
holding hands, touching, and bodily expression is looked down upon
with disdain.  A regular man in the professional world should have no
such desires.</P>
<P>So it is for Mr. Sugiyama.  He is an accountant in his forties,
married, and a father.  What possible role could dance have in his
life?  However, one day, while traveling home on the train, he happens
to notice a beautiful woman gazing from the window of a dance studio.
He is captivated by her.  Over the next few days he sees her
repeatedly at the same time, gazing outward.  One evening, he works up
the courage to enter the studio and meet her.  Instead of finding the
woman of his dreams, he finds a wonderful new world, the world of
dance.</P>
<P>When I approach foreign films, I never quite know what to expect.  I
suppose the stigma is that they are deep or aloof, and you may not be
able to understand it all.  Even though I've seen my share of foreign
films, and know that this is not always the case, I was still stuck
with this preconception going into SHALL WE DANCE?.  Having seen
PILLOW BOOK a few weeks previously probably didn't help.  However,
much like Mr. Sugiyama, what I found was something I didn't
anticipate.</P>
<P>SHALL WE DANCE? is one of the funniest movies I have seen in quite
some time.  Not a lot of the humor is intelligent, and much of it is
sheer physical comedy, but you quickly realize that as a viewer, you
must give yourself to the feeling of the movie and not spend too much
time analyzing it - much like dancing.  Koji Yakusho, as Mr. Sugiyama,
plays the straight man in this movie, but just watching his mannerisms
and awkwardness in the dance studio is more than mildly amusing.  His
sincerity through otherwise strange situations reminded me a lot of
Jimmy Stewart's earlier performances.  More outrageous are the
characters Mr. Sugiyama meets in his dance class:  A pair of
mismatched dance beginners and an office worker with the alter ego as
the king of the Latin dance.</P>
<P>Although the plot of SHALL WE DANCE? follows a general formula from
beginning to its inevitable ending, the plot does take a few twists
along the way.  For example, Mr. Sugiyama's wife, unaware of her
husband's dance lessons, hires a private investigator to find out what
he's been doing with his Wednesday nights. Rather than taking the
wrong-conclusion-then-have-a-zany-confrontation route, this thread
went in a surprising and decidedly more enjoyable direction.</P>
<P>Director Masayuki Suo presents the viewer with some excellent imagery,
especially during musical interludes which feature classical, jazz,
Latin, and pop music.  One problem, however, is that at times too many
things are happening on the screen at once.  In long shots of the
dance floor, I sometimes noticed several hilarious actions happening
at the same time, but was not able to draw all of them in.  Actually,
I'm not sure I could label it a total drawback, as trying to see it
all was a little fun.</P>
<P>At a hair under two hours, the film is well paced enough that the time
seems to fly.  Although the film finishes with a satisfactory finale,
I had so thoroughly enjoyed the ride that I was sorry to see it end.</P>
