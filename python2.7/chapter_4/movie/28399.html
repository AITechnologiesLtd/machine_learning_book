<PRE>THE KING IS ALIVE
-----------------</PRE>
<P>A missed plane changes the itinerary of a small group of European and American
tourists so they're put on a bus to make their next connection.  Liz (Janet
McTeer, "Tumbleweeds") frets that the journey is taking too long and is fed
comforting words by her husband Ray (Bruce Davison, "X-Men").  But when night 
turns into day, they discover that the compass bus driver Kanana (Peter 
Kubheka, "The Air Up There") has been relying on doesn't work.  Stranded in an 
abandoned mining town 500 miles from anywhere, English actor Henry's (David 
Bradley, "Prick Up Your Ears") idea of staging 'King Lear' sets the stage for 
the full range of human emotion in "The King is Alive."</P>
<P>Cowriter(with Anders Thomas Jensen)/director Kristian Levring is
the fourth founder of Dogme 95 (along with Lars von Trier, "Breaking the 
Waves;" Thomas Vinterberg, "The Celebration;" and Soren Kragh Jacobsen, 
"Mifune"), making his feature directorial debut with "The King Is Alive."</P>
<P>The ensemble cast create unique and complex characters that form a
microcosm of society.  Jack (Miles Anderson, "Cry Freedom") is the adventurer,
who gives the group the five rules of surviving in the desert before setting 
off for help.  Henry is the artist whose exercise of writing out the roles of 
King Lear from memory casts him as the group's director.  Drawn to him is 
Catherine (Romane Bohringer, "Colonel Chabert"), a young French woman who 
fancies herself an intellectual yet turns down the offer of 
Cordelia's part.  That goes to Gina (Jennifer Jason Leigh), an
American vamp disdained by Catherine but looked upon fondly by Henry (and 
lasciviously by the other white males).  Paul (Chris Walker) is a coarse, loud 
Englishman accompanied by mousy wife Amanda (Lia Williams) on a trip designed 
to bond with father Charles (David Calder, "The World is Not Enough").  Ray and 
Liz are a married couple whose suppressed accusations don't withstand the 
first evening's alcoholic blowout.  Ashley (late character actor Brion James, 
to whom the film is dedicated) is the initial Lear, done in by the DTs.  
Local Kanana is the object of scorn, lust, revenge and racism.
Moses (Vusi Kunene, "The Air Up There") is a hermit found in the village who 
acts as the story's narrator.</P>
<P>Levring and Jensen use 'King Lear' as a springboard for alliances,
cliques, divisions, betrayals and ultimately madness.   Yet for all the 
fascinating behavior so finely created by the cast, the screenwriters 
overindulge with several melodramatic sexual alliances - lust in the dust 
indeed.  These people may have something to prove, but Levring so ably 
makes us feel his characters discomfort ('I feel like a pig! I want
a bath!' proclaims Liz) that sex seems an unlikely outlet for them.  Gina's 
sacrifice for her 'art' via a most unlikely pairing plays especially false 
despite the actors' craft.  Still, the dialogue is often devastating.  Newly 
awakened Amanda tells Paul 'I knew you were nothing special but I 
didn't let that bother me because I wanted a peaceful life.'</P>
<P>Using three handheld digital video cameras, Levring achieves a
rich, color-saturated look at his exotic location of Kolmanskop, Namibia which 
is truly the star of his film.  The ever shifting sands provide texture, Gina's 
lip gloss and chartreuse satin shirt reflect light and splotches and streaks of 
paint on interior concrete walls provide both character definition and a 
modern art background.  Editor Nicholas Wayman Harris makes offbeat, 
unusual choices.  A one second cutaway of a woman's midriff from a
closeup of her face punches up the montage.  The sudden lack of sound during 
aerial shots intensify the utter isolation while allowing us to soak in the 
spectacular beauty of the terrain uninterrupted.</P>
<P>"The King Is Alive" attempts to encompass the human condition via a
woefully off course tourist bus.  Despite a couple of wrong turns, it takes us 
to places both known and uncharted.</P>
