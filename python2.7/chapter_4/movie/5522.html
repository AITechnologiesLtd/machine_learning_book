<PRE>                          CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1989) ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        In the vein of his earlier HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, 
Woody Allen's CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS covers the familiar 
territories of adultery and integrity and the spectrum of compromise 
between the two. The film centers around a doctor (Martin Landau) 
who has been carrying on an affair with Anjelica Huston (and won't 
Gomez be pissed?) but now wants to break it off. She's suddenly 
been acting obsessive, threatening to blackmail him with not only 
the news of his unfaithfulness but also the knowledge of Landau's 
embezzlement.</P>
<P>        A guy like this would never consider something so serious 
as murder, but when his Mafioso brother Jack (Jerry Orbach) tells 
Landau he could have her bumped off with one phone call -- one 
very lethal phone call. The only voice of reason is a rabbi patient 
of his (Sam Waterston), but would you listen to a man with curly 
sideburns? Neither would he, and soon Huston has made her last 
threat... and yes, Gomez is pissed.</P>
<P>        On a lighter note, Woody plays a documentary director 
(probably the only media occupation he hasn't portrayed yet... 
Coming soon: Woody the Gaffer!) who is so hard up for work 
that he agrees to do a biopic of producer-of-TV-trash Alan Alda 
(translation: Aaron Spelling), a man Woody completely abhors. 
In a movie where everyone is guilty of some crime or misdemeanor, 
Woody's character's transgression is a more symbolic murder of 
his artistic integrity.</P>
<P>        On location for the documetary, Woody meets one of his 
co-producers, omnipresent Allen movie favorite Mia Farrow, and 
falls in love with her. But he's in competition with Alda, who's 
committing a crime or misdemeanor of the heart by trying to add a 
Farrow notch to his bedpost through deception and seduction. 
Never mind that Alda has been using and losing twentyish women 
through the entire movie and is now after menopausal Farrow, she 
falls for him even though a woman with her character and strength 
should obviously be with Woody.</P>
<P>        All these characters are tied together through some sort 
of blood or marriage lines and by the end Landau is getting advice 
from Woody, which is about the point I'd say bite the bullet and 
pay a therapist two hundred bucks an hour. In CRIMES AND 
MISDEMEANORS, Allen explores meaningful life questions about 
how some people can get away with murder and virtue isn't always 
rewarded. He also shows how guilt can trip up an otherwise perfect 
crime all the while adding in his usual perfectly hilarious one-liners. 
One more great film from Woody Hitchcock.</P>
