<PRE>A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)
*1/2 out of *****</PRE>
<P>Cast: John Saxon, Ronee Blakley, Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund,
Amanda Wyss, Nick Corri, Johnny Depp,
Charles Fleischer, Lin Shaye, Mimi Craven
Written and Directed by: Wes Craven
Running Time: 91 minutes</P>
<P>My first exposure to the Nightmare on Elm Street series of films was
not this one, but in fact the third installment (it was the first to
gain a national theatrical release).  I didn't see the first film
until much later.  So looking back, the original didn't hold a lot of
great memories for me, since I didn't think too much of it when I
initially saw it.  Watching it now for a second time confirmed that
it's an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense
whatsoever.</P>
<P>You all know the story by now: child murderer Freddy Krueger (Robert
Englund) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children
of those who burned him alive years before.  This first installment
does an adequate job with it's low budget, but there's some absurd
dialogue and conceptual problems with the story.  Plus the movie's
ending (understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the
film to have a "hook" for a sequel) renders the rest of the film
pointless.  And does anyone understand what happens to Nancy's mother
at the end of this film?</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong though... it's not as if a new generation of horror
films have spurned me away from the classics.  Most horror movies
released today are just as inane as this film is.  Horror is a
difficult genre to pull off credibly, and A Nightmare on Elm Street
just doesn't cut it.</P>
<P>A Nightmare on Elm Street is available on DVD from New Line Home
Video.  It is available both as a single disc and as part of the
Nightmare on Elm Street Collection box set.  The film is presented in
both pan and scan and it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.78:1
(although on the disc that comes in the box set, only a widescreen
transfer is provided).  The film has been digitally remastered and
includes two options for audio: a mono mix and a new Dolby Digital 5.1
mix.  Also included on the DVD is a full-length audio commentary track
with writer/director Wes Craven, stars John Saxon and Heather
Langenkamp, and the film's director of photography.  Other extras
include the "Jump to a Nightmare" feature (I'm sure you can figure
that one out), the usual cast and crew bios (which are from the film's
original press release kit, and notably leave out Robert Englund and
Johnny Depp!), and the film's original theatrical trailer.  Some
DVD-ROM features are also included, but since I don't have DVD-ROM
capabilities I can't really get into that.</P>
<P>The commentary track is entertaining and informative, but nothing
spectacular.  The first thing of note is that it's the same commentary
track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago.
I'm not saying that's a negative thing, just pointing it out.
Everyone seems enthusiastic about being there, with the possible
exception of John Saxon, who just doesn't say much at all.  Most of
the time you'll forget he's even there.  Everyone else talks really
quietly though for some reason, as if because they're commenting on a
scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible.</P>
<P>The bonus disc with the boxed set called The Nightmare Series
Encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to
the first film of the series.  Also included is the original
theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film... however
you can only access one easily.  The other is hidden in what's called
"the labyrinth", which might possibly be the most annoying feature of
a DVD ever created.  Basically, it's an interactive game of sorts
where you wander through different Nightmare locations looking at
objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage,
interviews, etc.  Somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate
ending to the film.  Finding it though is both a chore and a bore.
