<P>Starring Richard Farnsworth, Sissy Spacek. Rated G.</P>
<P>Sometimes I think Hollywood no longer knows how to make real movies.
Not everything has to be slam-bang and in-your-face. How quickly we
forget that eloquence and quiet tenacity can be far more satisfying
than disturbing images and big time special effects. As great as
American Beauty was, I'm not sure I would want to live on a steady diet
of pessimism and angst. As transporting an experience as The Matrix
was, there's only so much room in my brain for mind-blowing kung fu.
What I want -- and what I haven't seen much of lately -- is a film that
is beautiful, good-natured, powerful in its own quiet way without
getting in my face with its morals.</P>
<P>David Lynch's The Straight Story is just such a movie. In the best
Lynch tradition, it's an eccentric but approachable true story about
growing older and shooting for the stars. Corny stuff? You betcha. But
only the best stalks are used.</P>
<P>79 year-old Richard Farnsworth plays 73 year-old Alvin Straight, a
crippled old man living in Iowa with his slightly "slow" daughter Rose
(Sissy Spacek). One day Alvin gets word that his brother Lyle, whom he
has not talked to for decades has just had a stroke. Alvin makes up his
mind to go see Lyle, who lives in the neighboring state of Wisconsin,
300 miles away. Trouble is, Alvin does not have a driver's license
because of his poor vision, and his daughter can't drive. But Alvin
isn't ready to give up so easily. He takes his 1964 John Deere tractor
lawn mower and sets of on a pilgrimage at 5 miles an hour.</P>
<P>Along the way, Alvin meets Midwestern eccentrics. Some are in awe at
his mode of transportation, some are impressed at the distance he has
covered, many think he is just plain crazy. When his mower breaks down,
a benevolent couple offers to drive him the rest of the way to his
brother's house. But he refuses. He wanted to finish this trip himself,
his own way, to round out his life with an achievement which would give
him a sense of self-satisfaction, a feeling that he has done something
truly valuable, something he will be remembered for long after he
passes away.</P>
<P>The Straight Story claims to be based on real events. It shouldn't
have. Such a claim, in retrospect, cheapens this magical movie,
detracting from the sense of wonder that it inspires in us. It's better
to think of this as a glorious fantasy. But either way it's a great
film. The epitome of pleasantness, it will be a hit with those
audiences wise enough to seek it out. But aside from being a crowd-
pleaser, it's also a profound, touching drama.</P>
<P>With his sad eyes and intelligent face, Richard Farnsworth can be
credited with bringing pathos to the screenplay. Sissy Spacek, probably
best known still for her role in Carrie, is just as good; her role is
poignant and, speech impediment and all, she plays it for devastating
effect.</P>
<P>But the film's brilliance doesn't really lie in the performances,
excellent as they may be. You've heard critics call other movies "The
antidote to summer blockbusters," I'm sure. Nonsense. All nonsense. If
you see this movie, you will agree. If this isn't the antidote to
Hollywood blockbusters, such a thing does not exist. By its very
nature, it's anti-Hollywood. Its pace, its atmosphere, its plot all
bear no resemblance to anything I have seen come out of Hollywood
previously. It's a surprise to me that Walt Disney, the distributor,
agreed to even touch this film. It never had a chance of making any
real money. That doesn't make it any less extraordinary or refreshing.
Often the best films are acknowledged as definite future box-office
flops as early as pre-production.</P>
<P>Technically, this is as adept a film as I've seen this year, with a
gorgeous score, deft camerawork and beautiful cinematography. David
Lynch manages to make the sight of cornfields and a guy riding a lawn
mower genuinely breathtaking. The soothing soundtrack, composed by
Angelo Badalamenti (who also scored Arlington Road, another of my
favorites this year), adds to the gloriously docile atmosphere; the
same theme repeats over and over, becoming more hypnotic each time
around. By the end of The Straight Story I was not only involved in the
characters, I was also mesmerized by the film itself.</P>
<P>Above all, this is a family movie, one to take your kids to and then
talk about with them afterwards. Don't expect excitement, action or big
laughs. It's not that kind of movie. Instead, expect wholesome
entertainment for all ages, a heartwarming, touching story about aging
and following your heart. This is truly an antidote to the Hollywood
blockbuster.</P>
