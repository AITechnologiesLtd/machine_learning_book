<PRE>THE VISIT
---------</PRE>
<P>Alex Waters (Hill Harper, "He Got Game") is in prison for 25 years for a rape
he swears he didn't commit.  As members of his estranged family visit him,
he dreams of each relationship in a musical interlude.  He also dreams of
travelling on the trains which pass by the prison walls, gradually opens up
to prison psychiatrist Dr. Coles (Phylicia Rashad, TV's "The Cosby Show"),
and prepares for his first meeting with the parole board.  As if Alex didn't
have enough to cope with, he also must face AIDS in "The Visit."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Adapted from Kosmond Russell's stage play by director Jordan Walker-Pearlman,
"The Visit" is actually a series of visits, beginning with Alex's older
brother Tony (Obba Babatunde, "Life") whom he hasn't seen in ten months.
Alex demands that Tony get their parents to visit him and admonishes him
for not bringing his family (although later their Dad turns the tables on
Alex, when he's not able to name is niece and nephew).  Alex dreams of disco
dancing with Tony is his cell.  </P>
<P>Next, Henry and Lois Waters (Billy Dee Williams, "Lady Sings the Blues" and
Marla Gibbs of TV's "The Jeffersons") appear, both nervously twisting their
wedding rings as they await Alex.  Father and son clearly have serious
issues, the stern Henry disapproving of Alex's lifestyle even before he
was jailed.  Motherlove is strong though and Alex dreams of dancing with his
mother to "For All We Know."</P>
<P>Meetings with Dr. Cole are intriguing as the psychiatrist pushes Alex to
confront himself.  Rashad makes some interesting acting choices, putting
a real spin on the tough-as-nails, but ultimately supportive doctor.  Harper,
as Alex, frequently recalls Denzel Washington's demeanor and delivery.</P>
<P>The film's strongest scene, however, comes when Alex's childhood friend
Felicia (Rae Dawn Chong, "Commando") comes to visit, apologizing for not
having spoken to him in twenty years.  As a child, Alex witnessed the sexual 
abuse Felicia suffered at the hands of her father and her guilt made
her unable to face Alex anymore.  Now a born again Christian, Felicia begins 
to push many of Alex's buttons, challenging and angering him, before finally 
presenting her deep empathy with his past - she was a crack addict who sunk 
even lower than he, selling herself to support her habit and bearing a severely
handicapped child.  These three broken people form a family, inspiring
all around them.  Rae Dawn Chong delivers a powerhouse performance here
that should garner strong Best Supporting Actress consideration.</P>
<P>Alex's parole board (Talia Shire, David Clennon, Glynn Turman, Efrain Figueroa
and Amy Stiller) functions almost as a Greek chorus, asking Alex searching
questions and debating the merits of Dr. Cole's recommendation behind
closed doors.</P>
<P>"The Visit" features tight shots which frequently fade to black after
snippets of conversation and jump cuts which make the film feel
self-consciencely stylish.  Lighting is anything but natural (as is
evidenced when Alex refolds a positively glowing piece of tissue) and
sound editting is a bit ragged.  Some of the fantasy sequences play like
a Hallmark Hall of Fame production, as does the overly sentimental ending.  
Yet the story works strongly when it does, aided by the terrific performances 
from Rae Dawn Chong and Phylicia Rashad.</P>
