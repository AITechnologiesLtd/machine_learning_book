<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"The Funeral'' is a thinking man's "Godfather," where the gangster
brothers try to analyze their motives in simplistic intellectual terms
as they try to understand why their lives are so twisted. The film is
set in the late 1930s in New York, as it opens with the slain youngest
Tempio brother, the 22-year-old Johnny (Gallo), being shown in a casket
in his older brother's house. Ray (Walken), as the eldest, is the
methodical leader, who is always serenely calculating in his approach to
life, accepting the fact that he is already doomed to rot in hell and
that there is nothing that he can do about it. Chez (Penn), the
bartender brother with the hot-temper, who gets hysterical by the side
of the coffin and has to be calmed by Ray, has severe mood swings and
acts at times as if he were mentally unbalanced.</P>
<P>The women of the brothers act with quiet dignity and will be the
counterpoints to the evil men: Jean (Annabella) is the religious wife of
Ray, who proudly says she reads books and went two years to college
before she married him and raised their two kids. Clara (Rossellini) is
the loving wife of Chez, who always looks for the good qualities in her
violent husband. Helen (Mol) is the girlfriend of the womanizing Johnny,
who says little but acts as if she really cares that Johnny got shot.
The family is more complex than a mob family has a right to be, and the
philosophical lines they spout, in this slow-moving, almost actionless
film for this genre, sometimes seems bizarre but has a strange pull to
it, one that keeps you wondering what's going on with these dangerous
criminals, as their lives begin to unravel during the funeral.</P>
<P>Ferrara employs a puzzling flashback style to the film, which begins to
use flashbacks upon viewing Johnny's body, covering the recent events
that led up to his death. It also goes back to Ray's childhood, and
shows how he had little choice but to follow in his father's gangster
footsteps, as he is asked at thirteen to prove his manhood by executing
a man his father says needs to be taught a lesson. This family is doomed
a priest tells them, unless they change their ways and learn how to pray
to God. They seem to twist the religious experiences and rituals around,
to fit morbidly into their way of life.</P>
<P>Revenge is on the mind of Ray, as he ignores his wife's pleas to forget
about his brother's killing. But, before he gets his revenge, he wants
to know what happened to Johnny. In the flashback, we see Johnny
attending a communist meeting, where he works for the commies by
intimidating the bosses and hijacking their trucks and stirring up
unrest over the workers being fired. The only difference between him and
his brothers, is that he sympathizes with the workers, while they will
work for whomever pays them the most.</P>
<P>Johnny's taste in women is shown to be strange, as he is seen in a
whorehouse choosing a fat, elderly, overweight madam, rather than one of
the good-looking prostitutes.</P>
<P>Chez also has his quirks. He feels genuinely sorry for a young
prostitute, and offers to give her $5 to walk away from this life and
save her soul, but she greedily asks for $10 and he  gives her $20,
telling her she will be a prostitute the rest of her life, that she has
just sold her soul. He, thereby, has rough sex with her, as he has lost
interest in saving her life.</P>
<P>In the obscure flashbacks, we learn of another mobster the brothers have
business connections with, Gaspare (Benicio). He killed Johnny's
womanizing friend Ghouly (Hipp), over a macho insult in Chez's bar. He
has hired the brothers to protect one of the bosses, as Johnny resisted
the idea of working for the bosses and openly stated this, telling his
brothers they sold their soul to get that contract. On top of that,
Johnny is screwing Gaspare's wife three times a week. So, naturally, Ray
suspects that Gaspare had Johnny whacked and his men bring him over for
questioning, as he stands over him with an ax. He soon realizes that
Gaspare couldn't have done it, but his criminal instincts tell him to
kill him anyway, that the man would never forget this insult if he
spared him.</P>
<P>The film refuses to have a traditional type of gangster payback, as the
one who killed Johnny is stuffed in a freezer by Ray's men, until Ray
arrives to question him. The youngster is a mechanic and claims that
Johnny raped his girlfriend, but Ray is not satisfied with that answer
and before killing him, he has a driving need to find out the truth.
This is the most powerful scene in the film and it is brilliantly
accomplished.</P>
<P>But the film can't end on that prosaic note, this film is heading down a
more philosophical and Catholic path, as the end is so unexpected and
makes so little sense, no matter how you try to explain it, that we can
only guess what the director means. The picture works despite the
bizarre ending, because it is gritty and seems real, in the sense that
so many families are dysfunctional in America, that there is no reason
why a long-standing mob family shouldn't also be plagued with family
problems.</P>
<P>Chris Penn's performance earned him the "Best Supporting Actor" award at
the 1996 Venice Film Festival and the film won the special jury prize.
But I didn't think he was something special, as much as he gave the film
energy. The Gallo character, despite a lot of attention placed on it, is
never uncovered, and his performance only seemed adequate. He has a
great line, though, where he says, "Life is pointless without the
movies." I thought the glue to this film, was Walken's mesmerizing
performance, who is able to say with a straight face, that the flaw in a
criminal's character, is that he is not trustworthy. He and his wife are
the only characters that I really felt for, who seemed to be touching
something deep down and bringing it up for examination. Annabella
Sciorra descries her life, wallowing in Catholic guilt, saying that
these criminals should not be glorified, they have never risen above
their heartless and limited upbringing. That is the message Ferrara
brings with this anti-gangster gangster film, who digresses to talk
about other topics such as capitalism and sexual kinkiness, but only in
a cursory way. The film has a black humor to it and a dark side that is
darker than the typical 1940 noir films were. The emotions here are
allowed to run over the screen and, all the diversions to the plot and
even the plot itself, are not as important as delving into the emotional
make up of the lead characters. It is an engrossing film, one of the
better gangster films, even though it is flawed by the director's
inability to stay in focus and maintain a coherent narrative.</P>
