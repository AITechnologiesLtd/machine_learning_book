 Hard Rain
 Directed by
 Mikael Salomon </PRE>
<P> Apparently, now that they know how to film in water, they're doing it with a
 vengence, first `Titanic,' and now this. Blubity blub-blub blub.</P>
<P> It's raining. The river, it doesn't matter which, is rising Hank(Wayne Duvall)
 is manning the dam and trying desperately to keep it from blowing. The Sheriff
 (Randy Quaid), who's been defeated for reelection, is evacuating the town. He
 is not a happy camper. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, other people are making preparations for the disaster that will
 surely come. Henry(Richard Dysart) and Doreen(Betty White), the comic relief,
 are setting bear traps to deter looters, Karen(Minnie Driver) is trying to
 protect the church and those stained glass windows she's been restoring from
 the upcoming deluge. One of the banks in the state is sending an armored car
 manned by Charlie(Ed Asner) and his nephew Tom(Christian Slater)
 to pick up the money and keep it from getting wet.</P>
<P> ...And in a local bar, Jim(Morgan Freeman) is waiting with his cohorts
 Kenny(Michael Goorjian),Mr. Mehlor(Dann Florek) and Ray(Ricky Harris) to steal
 it.</P>
<P> The concept of a caper movie taking place in the middle of a natural disaster
 is a new one. It's one of those things where you take an idea and take it to
 it's most ridiculous and extreme. It usually doesn't work, but in this case it
 does.</P>
<P> The reason is character. The characters are allowed to grow and change during
 the melodrama, and the changing coalitions within frame of the film are
 fascinating. Except for Driver and Slater, you're not one hundred percent sure
 who to root for, something that  director Mikael Salomon well understands.
 Freeman has to remind the audience every now and then he's one of the BAD
 guys.</P>
<P> This also allows the deputies, Phil(Peter Murnik)  and Wayne(Mark Rolston), to
 show dramatic internal conflict.</P>
<PRE> Gobs of gooey fun...</PRE>
