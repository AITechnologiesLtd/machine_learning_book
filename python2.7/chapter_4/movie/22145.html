<P>What we experience in watching Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" is a modern 
treatment of an eighteenth-century tale.  As such, it is very slick and 
rather fast-paced.  It is not, however, anything close to Washington 
Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."</P>
<P>Instead of the gangly schoolmaster Icabod Crane, Johnny Depp portrays Crane 
as a mildly buffoonish constable whose ambition is to be a criminal 
investigator.  In New York City proper, he complains of the brutal and 
backward police work he sees all around him.  Thus a burgomaster (played by 
Christopher Lee) sends him up the Hudson River to a village called Sleepy 
Hollow, where three people have been murdered, their heads sliced cleanly 
off.  Arriving to a rather cold welcome, Crane begins to practice his 
version of the scientific method, exposing all the evidence he can.  
Immediately we meet four leading citizens of the town, men who may or may 
not be involved with the grisly crimes.  Michael Gambon as the rich Baltus 
Van Tassel, Richard Griffiths as Magistrate Phillipse, Ian McDiarmid as 
Doctor Lancaster, and Michael Gough as Notary Hardenbrook - these character 
actors are masterful choices of casting.  Unsavory and gruff, these titled 
citizens support one of the film's themes, that appearance is very different 
from reality.</P>
<P>One aspect already given away in the trailers for the film is that the 
horseman is no legend.  Differing from Irving's scenario, in which we think 
the horseman is probably Brom Bones - the jealous boyfriend of Katrina Van 
Tassel - Burton's version gives a very frightening physical incarnation to 
the specter.  When the doubting Ichabod encounters a fake horseman - Brom 
with padding and a cape - we run up against a red herring that is one of 
many flaws in the script.  But when we see the real spectral Hessian, the 
narrative abandons Irving's ideas.</P>
<P>Why is the ghost of a Hessian mercenary keeping the heads he lops off?  Is 
there a pattern or a reason in the selection of his victims?  Andrew Kevin 
Walker's screenplay tries to cover these possibilities, but it is only 
partly successful.  Although the ghost's motivations are conveyed rather 
clearly, we don't quite understand those of Ichabod Crane, or even of the 
young woman with whom he falls in love, Katrina Van Tassel (Christina 
Ricci).  The film begins to weave a sort of subplot consisting of a series 
of disturbing nightmares.  It seems the 7 year-old Ichabod had a beautiful 
mother who is an "innocent."  What happens with her and Crane's father 
amounts to a failed search for motives, and a third-rate attempt at 
emulating the supernatural plot threads of a director like Ingmar Bergman.  
Here, the thread unravels.</P>
<P>As usual, Burton's film is beautifully photographed.  The sets are 
appropriate, often painted by special effect that capture New York of 1799, 
as well as pastoral landscapes captured on canvases of that time.  As might 
be expected in a horror film, there is a lot of imagery - in this case 
involving darkness, fire, smoke and blood.  Burton displays a morbid 
penchant for showing not only on-screen decapitations, but other wounds.  We 
spy angry-looking yet bloodless wounds on a few characters' hands and 
bellies and shoulders, aside from the cauterized necks of several victims.  
Several times we witness a bizarre, womb-like image in the place from which 
the horseman springs before galloping across the western woods in the next 
murderous venture.</P>
<P>Johnny Depp's acting is usually solid, and here Burton's pal does a nice job 
of depicting his character.  This Crane is, like Irving's, shaky and often 
unsure of himself.  But the very nature of the newer Crane calls for an 
amount of courage the original Crane would never exhibit.  Depp's Crane is 
an aspiring pathologist who actually brings bits of dark comic relief to the 
autopsy-like procedures he practices.  His being squirted with blood becomes 
a running joke.</P>
<P>As Katrina Van Tassel, Christina Ricci is underused.  Her character 
increases in importance as the narrative advances, though her true role is 
kept obscured by the filmmakers.  She and her  stepmother (Miranda 
Richardson) both appear to dabble in the black arts (though Crane calls 
Katrina's magic "white").  Richardson actually plays a double role, as she 
did in "Merlin" she and her twin play interesting roles in the intrigue.  
Richardson's acting is believeable and smooth.</P>
<P>The supporting cast contributes much to the tone and direction of the story. 
  In an uncredited appearance as the horseman-with-a-head, Christopher 
Walken is wild-eyed and menacing, his teeth filed to devilish points.  But 
even he seems baffled in one scene, when he has no lines but must only 
breathe with hatred.  Ray Park is one of the doubles for the headless rider, 
and his fight scenes are sharp and deadly.  The accoutrements of ghostly 
murder work well in his hands:  a saber and a battleaxe were never so 
expertly wielded in a Revolutionary War-era film.</P>
<P>So many of the action scenes are fascinating, their ILM-buffed special 
effects amazing and transparent.  The background for these scenes is 
memorable and truly gothic - something of which Burton is no doubt proud.  
But the script falters so many times, and the main plot - though gripping - 
is not supported well either by explanations or subplots.  I question the 
need for so many graphic beheadings, and also the frequency of characters 
practicing witchcraft or magic.  Do modern audiences really require such 
dark meanderings into the subhuman parts of humanity?  Or is this what it 
looks like to see another film falling far short of greatness?</P>
