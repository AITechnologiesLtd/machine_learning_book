<PRE>                            PLANET OF THE APES
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1968) * (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        "You damn dirty apes!" That's just one of the inadvertenty 
hilarious lines from PLANET OF THE APES that's taken on a comedic 
context over time. No one back then seemed to realize how over-the-
top Charlton Heston's acting style was, but it shows now, particularly 
in this "Mystery Science Theater 3000" wannabe that was taken for a 
film masterpiece in its time, actually winning one Oscar (for makeup, 
no less) and being nominated for a couple others. It also spawned 
multiple sequels like Beneath the Planet of the Apes, 
Escape From the Planet of the Apes, Return of the 
Planet of the Apes, Beneath the Escape from the 
Return of the Planet of the Apes, Planet of the 
Apes: The Next Generation, Police Academy of the 
Apes... the list goes on.</P>
<P>        Heston is an American astronaut who spends a few thousand 
light years in space with his three companions and ends up on a planet 
not too dissimilar from Earth. The thing is, on this planet humans 
can't talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant 
species. Heston's companions are killed or turned into vegetables by 
the apon is imprisoned. He surprises them all with his 
gift of speech, making two primate scientists (Roddy McDowall and 
Kim Hunter) believe Heston is the missing link between ape and man. 
Believe me, we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for 
years.</P>
<P>        When the two apes present the idea before a judicial 
counsel (the head ape being Shakespearean actor Maurice Evans), 
it is received as heresy, for all good monkeys know God "created ape 
in His image." But Heston has already seen a cave that contains 
evidence that humans were originally the dominant species, before 
apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president. And he 
takes them there, holding up a baby doll and yelling, "If humans 
couldn't speak, then how do you account for this TALKING DOLL?!" 
And how do you account for your acting ability, Mr. Heston?</P>
<P>        The absolute most laughable scene comes with the movie's 
surprise conclusion. I won't reveal the details except to say it involves 
Heston falling to his knees on a beach and yelling "God damn you all 
to hell!" several times in succession. The movie is atrocious and 
should only be viewed by those members of society who like to 
watch bad movies and laugh at them.</P>
<P>        What makes PLANET OF THE APES even more amusing 
is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony, a 
condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution. 
But let me tell you, if Darwin could see the ape masks and hear the 
rotten dialogue exchanges (HESTON [to female ape]: May I kiss you 
before I go?  APE: But... you're so... ugly.), he'd convert to creationism
on the spot. Luckily for us, science-fiction movies have evolved over 
time to the point at which some of them are actually good.</P>
