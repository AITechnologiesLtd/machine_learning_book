<PRE>TOMCATS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In TOMCATS, writer and first-time director Gregory Poirier, whose 
scripts have ranged from the superb (ROSEWOOD) to the pathetic (GOSSIP), 
sets a raunchy tone from the get-go, trying, as so many have, to turn 
out the next THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.  In a long-running testicle 
scene, which will have the men in the audience squirming, he gets large 
laughs that do approximate those produced by the now classic zipper 
scene in MARY.  Ah, if all of this hit-and-miss movie were just that 
crudely funny, TOMCATS could have some hit potential.  Of course, 
without name stars like Diaz, Dillon and Stiller, a big success is hard 
to pull off.</P>
<P>The plot concerns some happy bachelors who are reluctantly wedding 
bound.  In order to encourage each of these self-proclaimed tomcats to 
remain single as long as possible, they form a pool, which gets invested 
in a go-go mutual fund.  Apparently the movie was wrapped pre-crash 
since the cash in the account soars to half-a-million dollars.  The last 
man standing unhitched gets to take home the loot.</P>
<P>The possibility of riches becomes essential to Michael Delaney (Jerry 
O'Connell) after he loses it all at the craps table.  A disreputable 
casino owner gives Michael four weeks to come up with what he owes, or 
he will be killed.  Since there is only one other unmarried man among 
his buddies, all he needs to do is convince him to the tie the knot with 
someone.</P>
<P>Kyle Brenner (Jake Busey), a man who once vowed to nail every woman on 
the planet with the exception of his mother and his grandmother, is the 
man that Michael must convince of the joys of marital bliss.  A man with 
an ego and a libido the size of Montana and a brain the size of a 
rabbit's, Kyle gives bad taste a bad name.  Among the bizarre sexual 
pleasures he has discovered is the titillation factor of having sex with 
a barfing woman.</P>
<P>Michael, however, discovers Kyle's weakness.  The one memorable woman in 
Kyle's life is a police officer named Natalie Parker (Shannon 
Elizabeth), although he only had his traditional one-night stand with 
her.  Offering to split the earnings with her, Michael gets Natalie to 
entice Kyle to say "I do."  Kyle's perfect woman is a "cosmetics counter 
girl," since they are subservient and smell good, so Natalie poses as a 
perfume pusher in order to turn Kyle on.  The trouble, of course, is 
that the commitment-phobic Michael falls for Natalie.</P>
<P>Along the way, the jokes come fast and furious.  Most are as lame as the 
old out-of-control water hose gag.  Some, however, are quite funny, 
including one in which all the wives of Michael's old buddies are 
nursing their babies at a restaurant.  This over-the-top lactating scene 
will undoubtedly turn off as many viewers as it will amuse.</P>
<P>Although the uneven TOMCATS isn't quite worth recommending, it does 
produce some nice laughs.  And somehow, the little romance between 
Michael and Natalie does have some surprising charm.  Oh well, at least 
the film's a lot better than last week's crude comedy, SAY IT ISN'T SO, 
although that isn't much of a compliment.</P>
<P>TOMCATS runs 1:32.  It is rated R for strong sexual content including 
dialogue and for language.  It would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
