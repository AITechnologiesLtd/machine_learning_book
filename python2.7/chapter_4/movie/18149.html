<PRE>Grade: 61</PRE>
<P>HBO has a reputation for making the best made-for-TV
films.  "When Trumpets Fade" won't change that
evaluation.  It is an intense, grim war drama based
on an obscure World War II battle with the Germans
that cost 24,000 American lives.  Continuing recent
interpretation, war is depicted as a grisly, evil
force in which there are no heroes or villains,
only the dead and survivors.</P>
<P>It is late 1944.  American GIs are pushing into
Germany, but are overextended, and the Germans are
putting up stiff resistance.  The casualties are
devastating: Private Manning (Ron Eldard) is the
only survivor from his squad.  Promoted to sergeant
over his own objections, he is now forced to share his
battlefield survival skills and experience, putting
his life at increasing risk.</P>
<P>Manning's character is open to interpretation.  He is
not exactly a coward, but he certainly prefers some other
guy to get shot instead.  This extends to his field
leadership; he has fresh-faced recruit Sanderson (Zak Orth)
take the risks as point man, and in the assaults on the
tanks and 88mm guns he waves the other soldiers forward.
This is perhaps as it should be, since the other soldiers
must be trained, and their lives are less valuable to
the Army.</P>
<P>"When Trumpets Fade" succeeds in its depiction of battle
scenes.  However, Manning's heated conversations with
his superiors aren't as credible.  Officers generally come
off poorly.  Captain Pritchett (Martin Donovan) prefers
to remain in safety while ordering his sergeant to lead
raw troops to their certain death.  Lt. Lukas (Timothy
Olyphant) comes off even worse, turning into a shell-shocked
coward on the battlefield.</P>
<P>"When Trumpets Fade" is a minor but respectable entry in
the crowded genre of war films.  While perhaps not worth
tracking down, it is worth seeing if it happens to be on
and your other cable movie channel is busy showing
"Bride of Chucky".</P>
