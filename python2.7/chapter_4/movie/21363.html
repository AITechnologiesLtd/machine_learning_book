<P>`Fight Club' is the kind of breathless experience that chews you up,
spits you out, and leaves your senses jaded and disorientated with
exhilaration. It's a sublimely bizarre, starkly hilarious tale of an
underworld group of men who beat each other to a bloody pulp. But that's
certainly not the limit that director David Fincher and screenwriter Jim
Uhls have propelled the film to. The trailer would have you believe it's
merely a dark, disturbing guy movie.  Really, `Fight Club' tackles so
much more.</P>
<P>Fincher's astounding ascent begins right off the bat, when he takes us
through the barrel of a gun during the opening credits. The director has
showed incredible visual style in each of his previous efforts,
including his most recent, the labyrinthine puzzle thriller `The Game'.
Fincher has a knack for establishing mood and atmosphere, and in `Fight
Club', he breaks any and all barriers that could have previously
confined him. This is one wild and crazy ride; an adrenaline rush with
maniacal camera work that zips ferociously through the contents of a
trash basket, an apartment complex, and various other household
appliances.</P>
<P>This is the story of the socially-challenged Jack (Edward Norton), a
30-year old man suffocated by his job and badly suffering from a serious
bout of insomnia. Attending a self-help group for testicular cancer,
Jack is heartened at the fact that people feel sorry for him. He begins
appearing at these self-help groups on a frequent basis, until he spots
another `tourist': the ragged, chain-smoking drug kitten Marla (Helena
Bonham Carter). It just doesn't work any more for Jack. That is, until
he meets the glorified soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a plane
trip, and new possibilities are opened in his mind.</P>
<P>`Fight Club' is Jim Uhls' adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's acclaimed
novel of the same name. For the majority of it's lengthy 2 hour, 20
minute running time, Uhl's script has a delightful screw loose - one
that keeps the audience on edge as it twists and turns in several
unexpected directions. There are many details explored before Uhls
introduces the movie's central premise. During these moments, Tyler
introduces Jack to his method of personal liberation: old fashioned
hand-to-hand combat. After a while, this `fight club' begins to catch
on, and several new members are awaiting their turn to join in the
no-holds-barred face pummeling. There are only 8 simple rules. The first
rule: `You do not talk about fight club.' The second: `You DO NOT talk
about fight club.' Any questions so far?</P>
<P>At around the two-hour mark, just as `Fight Club' appears to have
exhausted every capably fresh idea in it's deranged little head, a
creative little plot twist comes into play. Is this twist at all logical
in any way? Certainly not. It's goofy but moderately resourceful, adding
fuel to a tired formula and ensuring enough palpable steam for an
appropriate finale. Some may compare this to the mind-bender of a climax
in `The Sixth Sense', but I beg to differ. Unlike that previous
late-summer smash, I was able to predict the unexpected `surprise' in
this entry (or at least detect a sign that things were not as they
seemed). Still, it's an interesting and strategic contortion of the
plot, and I admired the elaborate complexities of it all.</P>
<P>Around Oscar time next year, expect a nomination handed out to at least
one member of the lead ensemble in `Fight Club'. I vote for Norton, who
displays the perfect regulated amount of emotions, causing the narrator
Jack to aggressively appear as just a regular, average joe. But the
memorable centerpiece of the film is easily the offbeat, energized
character of Tyler Durden. Make a note: Brad Pitt has now shed his
pretty-boy image indefinitely, or, at least until he appears as a
typical pin-up hunk in his next film. Bonham Carter approaches the dazed
role of Marla with expertise, and there is also a modest supporting turn
from none other than Meat Loaf (who is credited as `Meat Loaf Aday').
The Loaf plays an overly obese man with gigantic breasts. Just thought
you'd like to know.</P>
<P>There is a graphic amount of violence in `Fight Club', but none seems
entirely inappropriate due to the nature of the subject matter. Fincher
corners the audience with darkly disturbing material, and the reaction
is - laughter? Yes indeed, and a healthy bit of it; the highlights
include a scene where Tyler and Jack smuggle several bags of human fat
from a liposuction clinic, with the intended purpose of using it as a
secret ingredient in the soap. If you think that sounds disgusting, wait
until you experience it in all it's fatty glory. Right from square one,
`Fight Club' is startling and darkly hilarious.</P>
<P>Of course, there is `inner meaning' hidden behind all the bloody
hi-jinks. For instance, why condemn yourself in the ugly barracks of an
average, everyday existence? Live freely, Tyler cautions. Few of these
moral messages successfully got through to me. But `Fight Club' delivers
a delectable helping of visual brilliance, original storytelling and
exhilarating action. This alone provides a prominent reason to see it.
So do it, before I get angry.</P>
