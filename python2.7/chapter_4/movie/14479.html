<P>One True Thing, based on the novel by Anna Quindlen, tells the story of
an average small-town family afflicted with a crisis.  The film stars
Meryl Streep and William Hurt as Kate and George Gulden; Kate is your
typical housewife, calmly cooking dinner each night and participating
cheerily in her clubs, while George is a stoic literature professor at
the local university.  The story is actually told through the eyes of
their daughter, Ellen (Rene Zellweger), who comes home for Thanksgiving
in the beginning of the film.</P>
<P>It is at this point that Ellen learns that her mother has cancer. 
George insists that Ellen come home and stay with Kate, despite Ellen's
intense journalism job in New York City.  Ellen obligingly obeys her
father's orders; initially, she hates what she has to do, and resents
her mother for it.  We learn that the two women weren't terribly close
as Ellen was growing up, and that neither of them feels that they can
get along with the other.  Subplots arise when it becomes clear that
George is more concerned with his work than his family life, and soon
Ellen suspects that he's having an affair.  </P>
<P>There are two types of goo:  there's bad goo, in which the characters
are weakly defined, weakly acted, and take part in a story that only
wants to make you cry (and usually fails).  Then there's good goo, in
which the characterizations and acting are strong, and the story is at
least marginally interesting and not completely contrived.  One True
Thing, for the most part, fits securely in the second form of goo.  It
is sentimental, and made many people in my screening cry profusely.  But
it's admirable in its triumph of characterization over manipulation, and
ultimately it's a worthwhile bit of goo.</P>
<P>What really sets apart the film are the three terrific lead
performances.  Streep is a pro, and while it's clear that she can play a
role like this without a lot of stretch-work, she's immensely appealing
and always endearing.  Hurt is also a well-seasoned performer, and is a
rare screen presence who manages to rise above his familiar face and
create a character worth watching.  Oddly enough, One True Thing gets
its real burst of life and emotion from Rene Zellweger (Jerry Maguire). 
It certainly helps that she's luminous and smart, but this alone isn't
enough:  her performance here is deep; it resonates and holds the film
together on an emotional level.  We endure all of Ellen's experiences
through Zellweger, and this makes most of the difference between One
True Thing and its bad-goo siblings.  </P>
<P>The film isn't perfect, of course.  Director Carl Franklin keeps the
story at a good pace, but there are a few too many scenes that want to
make us cry.  I counted about six, spread out at even intervals through
the second half of the film.  That's not to say that these scenes aren't
moving, for they are -- none of the sentimental moments in One True
Thing reach that unbearable level of cloying insincerity.  By the end,
though, I felt like Franklin had tried to manipulated me too much.  A
little is okay, but I was exhausted from fending off an emotional
response.  </P>
<P>A film like this doesn't need a compelling story to be successful, but
there are a lot of interesting themes explored in One True Thing.  The
bonds between mother and daughter, and also between father and daughter,
are well-described (even if they aren't universal truths), and the
family unity is very well executed by Franklin and the actors.  It's so
much easier to wimp out and make a film of bad goo that might
superficially please audience members; I was glad to sit through One
True Thing and find that my heartstrings hadn't been yanked by big heavy
chains.  </P>
