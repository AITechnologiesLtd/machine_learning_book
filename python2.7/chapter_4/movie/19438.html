<PRE>                            ENTRAPMENT 1999
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
              3 out of 5 for a love affair between thieves</PRE>
<P>Cast: Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames, Will Patton.
Screenplay: Ron Bass and William Broyles.
Producers: Sean Connery, Michael Hertzberg and Rhonda Tollefson.
Director: Jon Amiel.</P>
<PRE>Trends of this movie state …</PRE>
<P>1. It's all right to date women forty years your junior, as long as it
looks good on screen. Don't ask me how, but Sean Connery, with his
undeniable lasting charm, gets away with a kiss from the lovely
Catherine Zeta Jones and nobody squirmed!
2. The idea of stealing billions from the world exchange bank on top of
the K.L. Twin Towers is a good idea, but I hear that the bank is
actually imaginary. In fact, the world's tallest building now stands
mostly half empty thanks to the recent SE Asia recession.
3. A story about professional thieving is exciting, and there hasn't
been one of this calibre and quality for awhile. My personal favourite
was a Sidney Sheldon mini series ‘If Tomorrow Never Comes.' My only
complaint is that towards the end, the ability of these professional
thieves becomes too magical when they somehow start jumping trains
mid-motion in heels and dress.
4. This movie will be remembered for some very sensual and sensational
body movements from Zeta Jones, as she twists her firm, slim body
through some tight motions when navigating a maze of laser beams. And
WOW, what a body!</P>
