<PRE>                             THE AGE OF INNOCENCE
                       A film review by Vijay Ramanujan
                        Copyright 1993 Vijay Ramanujan</PRE>
<PRE>Cast:  Daniel Day-Lewis   -   Newland Archer
       Michelle Pfeiffer  -   Countess Ellen Olenska
       Winona Ryder       -   May Welland</PRE>
<P>Plot: Newland Archer is torn between a promise to marry Mary Welland,
and a love for her more worldly and passionate (but also married)
cousin, Countess Olenska.</P>
<P>     By now, I'm sure all have heard of the lush settings, beautiful
dinners, and of the directorial genius of Martin Scorsese.  It seems
that little praise is left to write, but here goes.</P>
<P>     This is not a ground-breaking film in the conventional sense.
Scorsese doesn't take large chances, nor many chances at all.  What he
has done is to perfect film-making.  He has raised the level of the art
instead of redefining its boundaries, the way Francis Ford Coppola or
Tim Burton try to do.  But his attention to detail and his feel for the
material make this one of the most seemless and timeless movies ever.
He is helped, in no small part, by a superlative cast.</P>
<P>     Miriam Margolyes is wonderfully eccentric as Welland's Grandmother
Mingot, a character oddly reminiscent of Brando in THE GODFATHER.
Stuart Wilson is equally engaging as the scandal prone businessman,
Julius Beauforte.  But the stage really belongs to the three main
actors.</P>
<P>     Daniel Day-Lewis is solid in his performance here.  He is in prime
form, playing the exact opposite of his character in THE UNBEARABLE
LIGHTNESS OF BEING.  Here he is torn by the love of two women, not
spurred on by it.  He is constrained by societal norms, not oblivious
to them.  It is hard not to feel the pain of his predicament.  However,
I still found myself feeling that Archer was a hopelessly, if
unknowingly, selfish individual, and Lewis came just short of convincing
me otherwise.</P>
<P>     Michelle Pfeiffer, on the other hand, was magnificent.  She
alternated pained selflessness with manipulative gamesmanship so easily
that they seemed one and the same.  She has a myriad of voiceds, from
engaging to pained, to hypnotic, and rotates swiftly between them,
bringing out every facet of Olenska's personality.  Her eyes showed a
vitality behind her broken spirit, letting us know that however
horrible the count might have been, he hadn't managed to crush her.
When she dismisses Archer's complaints of the pains he can't endure, by
calmly saying "I've endured it," you can see she has.  She is is total
control, not only of herself, but of Newland, her family, and the
entire movie.  This is as much her story as the story of Newland
Archer.</P>
<P>     And Ryder?  With May billed as a docile bore, nothing more than a
pretty mantelpiece, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of her
performance.  "If looks could kill they probably will."  The look, as
she questions Archer's reason for postponing a business trip, shatters
the misconception of ignorace.  And she reveals a certain nobility and
insight when she questions why Archer wants to hasten their marriage,
and then warns him that she cannot find happiness as the cost of
another--the lover all were sure she was unaware of.  She effortlessly
lulls both characters and audience into a false confidence, then snaps
them awake with a subtle look or an unexpected insight.</P>
<P>     The only complaint I had was with the narration, provided by
Joanne Woodward.  She brings Wharton's words to the screen with a touch
of class and a good pace.  It was crucial at times, even humorous.  It
was at its best in a scene introducing guests at a dinner party, each
with their peculiarities and weaknesses.  But at other times, it
intruded on the characters, telling us what they were thinking and how
they had changed since we saw them last.  The actors in this movie were
good enough to convey such subtleties of spirit without the help of
narration.  It often seemed to interfere with the flow of the movie.</P>
<P>     Overall, a nearly perfect movie.  Humble in breadth, but deep
enough and strong enough to make it the must-see movie of the nineties
so far.</P>
<PRE>(A solid, but not overwhelming)
4 out of 4</PRE>
<PRE>.
