<P>>From almost its beginnings, Hollywood has remade more French films that
products of other nations. As is the rule, remakes of any sort suffer in
the process. Think of the current "Sommersby" and "The Vanishing."</P>
<P>"Point of No Return" however fares much better. For one thing, its 1990
modish French model was already filmed "a l'americaine" by movie junkie Luc
Besson. More importantly, "Point of No Return" is not, as its credits
state, simply "based" on "Nikita" ("La Femme Nikita" in this country). It
could, instead, be called the first fac-simile film of the FAX era, since
it is mostly a scene-by-scene copy of the original -- with some shifts to
transpose the story from France to the U.S.A.</P>
<P>In "Nikita," Anne Parillaud plays 19-year old Nikita, a member of a gang of
crazed, murderous junkies. In a stupor during a shootout with a SWAT team,
she blows out the brains of a cop and is condemned to life.</P>
<P>A mysterious government agency fakes her death and, for logic-defying
reasons, makes of the unwilling Nikita a political killing machine. Held
for a long time within a center of operations, she is trained in weaponry,
martial arts and other procedures. She is groomed and metamorphosed from
super-violent slattern to chic lady.  Given a new identity, Nikita is
molded into a lethal Jane Bond and let loose with Terminator assignments.</P>
<P>In quality "Point of No Return" is on a par with the original. Some parts
are a little better, others a little worse, yet most of its strengths and
weaknesses correspond to those of "Nikita."</P>
<P>Bridget Fonda (called Maggie) replaces Parillaud; Gabriel Byrne, as Bob, is
her Pygmalion-like control; Anne Bancroft plays her finishing-school
teacher; Dermot Mulroney plays J.P. who becomes Maggie's lover after her
release from the compound.</P>
<P>The first parts of both films are the strongest and the most alike: the
opening violence, the woman's defiance, her relationships with Bob and her
Miss Manners mentor, and the climactic "graduation exercise" in which
Nikita-Maggie, in a posh restaurant,  pumps bullets into a man and his
bodyguards.</P>
<P>It is in the restaurant sequence that some differences begin to emerge.
John Badham directs with extra energy the fracas, makes it longer and
deadlier than the French, and close to Westerns where the protagonist's aim
in unerring, while he/she remains unscathed. This adds to the disbelief,
but also to the pleasure of gun battle fanciers.</P>
<P>In the French film Nikita is headquartered in Paris. Her first assignment
has her helping with the termination of some unseen people in a Paris
hotel; her second is in Venice, Italy; her third, back in Paris.</P>
<P>"Point" relocates Maggie from Washington to Venice, California, the place
where more people glide than walk. This may be a cute conceit (one Venice
for another) but the facile Hollywood overuse of Venice, CA. (cf."Falling
Down") is a cliche in itself.</P>
<P>Maggie's first assignment however, in a Los Angeles hotel, is more graphic
and detailed. It includes a spectacular explosion that, I am sure, the
French film skipped not out of delicacy but because of its cost.</P>
<P>In "Point"'s Assignment Two, New Orleans replaces Venice (Italy). The plot
nicely folds in some actual Mardi Gras footage, while it can't resist a
short addition of kick-boxing. Hollywood won't leave well enough alone, but
no harm (to the film structure, that is) is really done.</P>
<P>In Assignment Three (Paris and California respectively) incredibility grows
exponentially in both versions. "Point" has a slight edge, as the French
episode was very confusedly plotted. On the other hand, California's
sunnier and airier setting diminishes the mood of "Nikita"'s somber Paris,
a tone also present earlier in the French Center's more realistic blend of
high-tech and grunginess.</P>
<P>In neither film does the intensive social training of the girl (such as
lessons on table etiquette, and for Maggie, also learning French and
improving her English) get sufficiently worked into the plot. But it is
amusing to have Bancroft enjoin her pupil : " Say  'I feel badly, not 'bad'
-- 'bad ' is an adjective. And remember to say ' It remains a  secret
between her and me, not she and I." Non-killers, note.</P>
<P>Bridget Fonda's Maggie, first monstrously wild, then tamed but sad, is
quite effective. And her parallel physical transformation -- bad skin,
yellow teeth and all -- into fashionable glamor, is a good illustration of
the movies' magic through makeup.</P>
<P>On the debit side, while Fonda is very good as a killer, she makes a pallid
"normal" person. In the interludes of her enjoying life and love, mixing
ravioli and sex (a vulgar addition), doing fun things with her boyfriend
in a bad, cliche montage of short scenes, yet desperately wanting to quit,
Maggie becomes insipid and the movie gets tedious along with her.</P>
<P>The original's romance and pathos were better in their understatement,
vulnerability and, oddly for a French film, in their sparser dialogue.
Worse yet, in "Point", Bob and J.B. are flat and colorless. J.B. especially
lacks the underplayed sensitivity of "Nikita"'s Marco. You win some, you
lose some.</P>
<P>In the opening sequence, film buffs will recognize character actor
(generally a villain) Geoffrey Lewis, as the gunned down drugstore owner.
They may deplore his very early demise.</P>
<P>If you liked "Nikita" and bought its outlandish premise, execution and
executions, and if you are intrigued by fine points of difference between
twins, "Point" is a quite watchable curiosity. First-timers too may find it
entertaining. It's essentially a mainstream fantasy-action film camouflaged
by soulful and stylish twists.</P>
