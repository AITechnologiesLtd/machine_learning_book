<P>Disney Studios' latest full-length animation film is delightful.   It
tells the story of a colony of ants that work and slave to provide food
for the dreaded grasshoppers that descend upon them each year and take
their harvest.  Then, after the grasshoppers have left, the ants can
gather the remaining food for themselves.  Unfortunately, as the
grasshoppers arrive, their food is accidentally destroyed by Flick, a
well-meaning but accident-prone ant.    </P>
<P>Flik ventures off the `island' to look for other bugs who can help the
ants defend themselves against the `hoppers' who have promised to return
for their allotment. </P>
<P>He goes to the Big City where he finds a group of circus bugs, from a
Flea Circus, who agree to go with him thinking that it is a booking to
entertain the ants.  The theatrical troupe is almost as inept as Flik, but
somehow they manage to pull it all together.</P>
<P>When I was a child, there was a Disney comic book that featured the lives
of the Bug family.  This movie reminds me of it.  They use the discards of
human beings to furnish their homes.  An animal cracker cookie box becomes
the circus wagon.  It's fun to watch for those treasures in the background.</P>
<P>There is humor for everyone.  There are jokes aimed at children, and
others aimed at the adults, but none of them are improper for the kids. 
It was wonderful to hear the children laughing out loud and then, to hear
adults catching a clever double entendre.</P>
<P>Identifying the voices is a game unto itself.  Some belong to old,
familiar actors, others to total unknowns, and some in between.  Most of
us had to watch to see who they were. </P>
<P>Some of the cleverest footage comes at the end of the film as those
credits roll by.  There are some very enjoyable `out takes', even more so
when you realize that there's no such thing as an animated `out take'.</P>
<P>I do want to see this again, probably with my grandchildren.  I give it a
solid B.</P>
<PRE>SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES.</PRE>
