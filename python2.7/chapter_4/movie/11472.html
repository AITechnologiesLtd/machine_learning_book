<PRE>The Birdcage
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>This remake of "La Cage aux Folles" features a gay couple pretending to be
straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son's future
in-laws. The couple (Robin Williams and Nathan Lane) are about as archetypal,
or as the less kind might put it – stereotypical, gays possible. Williams owns
a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured
star. They live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a
heterosexual abode.</P>
<P>Williams is excellent as should be no surprise. Gene Hackman as right-wing
potential father-in-law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles. The
real star is Lane. His attempted transformation from one of the most obviously
gay men in the world to the straight-shooting uncle is hilarious.</P>
<P>Perhaps it is a personal failing on my part, but the crying and screaming drag
queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of
this film are filled with it. Luckily (for me at least), it doesn't last long
and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men, their
son and the deception.</P>
<P>The question of stereotypes is a touchy one. These guys personify the
homophobic gay image. You can almost hear the swishing. If you think that they
are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world, you'll be
outraged. But if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay
individuals, you'll love it. Your choice.</P>
