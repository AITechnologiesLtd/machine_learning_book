<PRE>THE WINGS OF THE DOVE</PRE>

<P>   During the working week, the subways of New York City--
and presumably those of other urban centers--are filled with
people of all types.  "Suits" are conspicuous enough: those
middle-class executives and salespersons hustling around
town making their appointments; while more youthful students
boisterously ride the rails with an assortment of panhandlers,
and preachers. And yet to see Kate (Helena Bonham Carter)
straphanging in the British Underground circa 1910 as the
opening scene of "The Wings of the Dove" is nothing short of
astonishing, serving quite well to set the tone for the entire
work.  Kate is dressed as a member of London's upper crust. 
She appears immediately to be "slumming"--as though curious
about the manners of the lower orders, even eager to arrange
a liaison with one of its constituents.  The initial minutes of
this genuinely satisfying film of class and caste are its most
startling, as Kate catches the eye of a handsome lower
middle-class fellow, Merton Densher (Linus Roache), follows
him silently up the lift leading to the street, and spontaneously
embraces and passionately kisses the object of her lust.  We
know from that point that we're in for a thoroughly
contemporary adaptation of this, one of James's lesser,
novels, which takes flight with Hossein Amini's reworking and
Iain Softley's comeback direction.</P>
<P>   As portrayed deftly by the excellent Helena Bonham Carter,
Kate is caught between passion and security.  It's the old
story, perhaps one of the six basic themes of all literature. 
The alluring young woman has one foot planted in the 19th
century, a twenty-something plotter who has been taken in
after her mother's death by her fabulously rich and socially
conservative Aunt Maud (Charlotte Rampling).  Her other
foundation is purely twentieth-century, a liberated female
determined to follow her appetites even when her lusts
threaten her new and very appealing social standing.</P>
<P>   In essence, we are shown a high-minded, intelligent version
of the Eternal Triangle.  Kate is loved by Lord Mark (Alex
Jennings), a bored, alcoholic, albeit witty member of the upper
echelons whom Maud has chosen for Kate's future husband. 
Kate, however, is in love with a commoner, however
intelligent, one Merton Densher (Linus Roache), who argues
for class reform and publishes opinion pieces in a London
newspapers about such matters as the evils of the medical
profession.  Their clandestine meetings take on new meaning
upon the arrival of Millie (Alison Elliott), a gorgeous and very
rich young American, who is on a grand tour of Europe and is
condoned by Maud's circle of snobs as one of them, a woman
who would be "Queen of America" is that country had such a
position.  When Kate learns that Millie--also in love with
Merton--is dying, she conspires to arrange a marriage
between Millie and Merton, assuming that the latter would
inherit a fortune upon the death of his new wife.  Kate and
Merton could then marry and live happily ever after, their
need for love and money both entirely satisfied.</P>
<P>   To the film's credit, the surprising conclusion is in no way
prettified, an ending which is altogether Jamesian in capturing
the irony of the situation.  We are reminded immediately of
this year's other highly successful adaptation of the Henry
James novel of "Washington Square," in which a suitor,
having flown from the affections of a shy and trusting partner,
returns years later upon hearing that his former steady has
accumulated a satisfactory inheritance.  </P>
<P>   Linus Roache and Helena Bonham Carter, both exceptional
performers, make the sparks fly and in one explicit sexual
situation, Carter poignantly exhibits her torn feelings about a
man she is no longer sure she trusts.  The key figure of Millie
is played with American gusto by Alison Elliott, whose
exuberance despite illness contrasts auspiciously with the
jaded manner of a declining Eurotocracy.  "Wings of the
Dove" is more satisfying than "Washington Square," even
while a bit less accessible to an American audience, given
director Softley's ability to communicate the more intricate
complexities of life among the pre-World War I elite.
