<P>     In my review of John Sayles' 1996 film LONE STAR, I wrote that my
initial frustration with the film must have meant that I missed something.
Such was my confidence in Sayles' storytelling that I was convinced I
could find the unifying thematic thread if I just pondered long enough.
In that particular case, I was right.  Sayles' new film LIMBO presented me
with the same initial frustration, and the same determination to find the
one piece that would turn the merely intriguing into the truly brilliant.
And it just wasn't there.</P>
<P>     For the first hour, there are plenty of reasons to believe LIMBO
could be the latest thematically rich cinematic Sayles novel.  The setting
is Port Henry, Alaska, a remote fishing town in the Southeastern islands.
Among the residents is Joe Gastineau (David Strathairn), a former
fisherman turned jack-of-all-trades after a long-ago trauma.  He becomes
interested in new arrival Donna de Angelo (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), a
singer who has her own problems dealing with moody teenage daughter Noelle
(Vanessa Martinez) and a string of bad romantic choices.  As Joe and Donna
grow closer, they begin to break out of their protective shells and face
their demons.</P>
<P>     As he has with the settings of most of his recent films -- THE SECRET
OF ROAN INISH's coastal Ireland, LONE STAR's Texas border town, MEN WITH
GUNS' unnamed Latin American interior -- Sayles turns LIMBO's Alaska into
a character as carefully drawn as any of the people.  Here, Alaska has at
least two faces: the raw, blank-slate wilderness that provides escape and
opportunity for new beginnings, and the tourist attraction that provides a
sanitized version of that wilderness.  Sayles offers plenty of local color
with his supporting characters, but it's the way those characters interact
with the place that gives LIMBO weight.  For half the film, LIMBO sets a
tentative romance against a backdrop of civilization trying to claim one
of the few remaining frontiers, even as residents who should know better
keep searching for a predictability that just isn't there.</P>
<P>     I suppose you could see the second half as Sayles' attempt to show
just how far civilization has to go, if you were feeling particularly
generous.  An abrupt twist in the proceedings finds our three principal
characters in trouble, stranded on an uninhabited island after a botched
drug deal by Joe's hustling half-brother Bobby (Casey Siemaszko).  The
metaphorical connections to the three characters' respective troubles are
a bit too tidy -- Joe has two people to save after being responsible for
two deaths, Donna is stuck with a guy she can't run from, and Vanessa has
to confront her sense of isolation.  Even worse, the links to the first
half's portrait of Alaska at a cultural crossroads become tenuous at best.
The second half is solid enough, but it's a jarring shift.  Instead of a
novel, Sayles has written two short stories slammed together in an
uncomfortable fit.</P>
<P>     John Sayles' films are always comparative pleasures in the bigger
picture of filmmaking, with their smart dialogue and attention to human
detail.  Strathairn, Mastrantonio and Martinez all do fine work, with
Mastrantonio providing the added pleasure of performing her own songs in a
beautiful smoky voice.  Sayles has also become a more visually interesting
director with every film, turning in at least one hypnotically beautiful
sequence of Joe returning to fishing (another triumph for cinematographer 
Haskell Wexler).  He can say fascinating things both with his dialogue and
his camera.  In LIMBO, all those fascinating things just don't add up to a
fascinating, unified story.  LIMBO isn't a disappointment because he
doesn't say enough, as in the ambiguous final shot.  It's a disappointment
because he tries to say too much.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 overbaked Alaskas:  6.</PRE>
