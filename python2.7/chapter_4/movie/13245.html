A Movie Review by David Sunga </PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Betty Thomas</PRE>
<P>Written by: Nat Mauldin and Larry Levin</P>
<P>Starring: Eddie Murphy, Kyla Pratt, Oliver Platt, the voice of Chris
Rock as a hamster</P>
<P>Ingredients: Physician who talks to animals, dog, hamster, tiger</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
When he was a kid John Dolittle could talk to animals, but as the adult
Doctor John Dolittle, the memory is completely repressed. One day, after
he drives his little daughter off to camp, John suffers a bump on the
head that revives his ability to understand what animals are saying.
When people don't understand Dolittle's strange new behavior, it leads
to a lot of comedic situations - - like getting put in the looney bin,
hiding a circus tiger within his health clinic, giving CPR to a rat, and
being chased by the police. </P>
<P>Meanwhile, other situations are complicating Dolittle's life. For
example, a big, unethical HMO is trying to buy out his humble health
clinic. And DoLittle's smart little daughter is being cruelly shunned by
kids at camp. </P>
<P>Can the good doctor straighten out the situations and also cope with the
emergence of his peculiar talent? </P>
<P>Opinion: 
There's a scene in this movie where Eddie Murphy, as Dr. Dolittle, is in
his car, and he blasts the radio and overspeeds to drown out the sound
of a hamster's voice because he doesn't want to believe that the hamster
is talking to him. The loud car comes peeling into his daughter's camp,
and we all get a big laugh because dear old "Dad" is all of a sudden
acting so nutty. Yet just a few years ago, Murphy seemed typecast to
play wisecracking macho characters (METRO and BEVERLY HILLS COP) who
always blasted the radio and sped down the street. </P>
<P>When saw that scene in DOCTOR DOLITTLE, I was impressed because Murphy
plays a such believable dad, not to mention the acting job of having to
pretend to talk to animatronic puppets and look credible. This summer
must be Murphy's year, because he's doing a fantastic job in both DOCTOR
DOLITTLE and MULAN. Wow!</P>
<P>Some of the humor is low brow (burps, farts, dogs complaining about
enemas, etc.) but the overall theme ("we should accept people as they
are") of DOCTOR DOLITTLE is heartwarming. </P>
