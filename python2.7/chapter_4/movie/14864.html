SUPER FEATURES:         THE ART, and that hand.....</PRE>
<PRE>      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>I can only think of two countries where film is treated as pure literature,
and very often allowed to live as such.  RUSSIA has a history of film that
is always in the neighborhood of three hours long.  And FRANCE.</P>
<P>And the reason why these films are long, is because both of these countries
have a fascination with the artist's thoughts at its deepest....what drives
them, to create.  Or, as is the case in many Russian films, the character
studies always have to live out their
life, be it in pain, or in sweetness.  A little of the Dostoyevsky  style to
their film, if you will.</P>
<P>Jacques Rivette, has never made it as big as Francois Truffaut, or Jean Luc
Godard, or Claude Chabrol, or Eric Rohmer, but if LA BELLE  NOISEUSE is any
indication, he is better than those ever were.  To be  perfectly honest with
you, LA BELLE NOISEUSE is not a film, but really a special work in progress,
and you should only sit through the four hours, if you enjoy the suspension
of disbelief ( and belief ) to watch a film maker that allows the hand to
paint at its own pace, and an artist ( and model ) to go through their inner
changes... with the inevitable result at the end as a finished
piece.  THE FILM IS JUST THAT.  And even as the aging Frenhofer says
himself, it has no meaning, it just lives, there are no rights or wrongs,
just moments, where the sparks fly and the canvas is on fire, or nothing
happens.</P>
<P>And there is more open moments for ad libbing in this film than Godard ever
created.  It strikes me that the dialogue was set amid ideas, and the actors
were allowed to flow with it until a result was achieved.  And the director,
of course, has the same dilemma as Fronhofer, because he has to find those
moments. And indeed, HE DOES.</P>
<P>The story is really simple, and has nothing to tell us.  An aging artist
named Frenhofer ( Piccoli ) who has been living with Liz ( Jane Birkin ),
has stagnated for ten years since his relationship to Liz either has
softened, or lost its spark.  Before that he painted with wild abandon, and
spent much time with her.  And in many ways, the film immediately suggests
that it is the fact that they were involved which hurt his art, since now it
is
personal, intimate, and there is a tendency to be protective  so not to hurt
it ( which could have happened before ) along the way.  In comes a 'student'
who wants to learn, but it is his girlfriend  ( Emmanuelle Beart ) that ends
up being asked  to pose for the aging painter, much to the chagrin of her
lover.</P>
<P>And the film starts the process in motion.  We follow the hand as it draws
its very first lines in years, and it is shy, and unsure of itself.  And the
next two and a half hours are an incredible array of images of painter at
work, and resetting his model, in search of a special moment in time.  Just
about intermission time, the real battle shows up.   There is a certain
point where many artists have been, that can be a bit dangerous. And that is
called the 'point of no return' with a model, and the effect can be
invasive, and uncertain, and often extremely un-nerving to those involved.
Here, either the two continue the  work, or they get involved.  And the
consequences can destroy the work in progress.  The emotional bond
diminishes the work, or so it seems, and Frenhofer makes a point of saying.
It isn't her body he is after, and neither her ideas.  When he admits that
he is afraid of hurting his model, the young woman immediately jumps out and
demands that he continue.  She is not enamored with the job, but has come to
allow, and appreciate a little of his nature.  And in the end, when he has
found something, the model takes a look at it.  And she doesn't like it.
Here it could be
inferred that it showed the real 'her', and that she didn't like it at all.
He has succeeded.  But she is an internal mess. And totally unsure of
herself, not because she does not know anything, but because she has to
evaluate herself.  And she proceeds to do so.  She dissolves her
relationship with the student, the young man who wanted to learn from
Frenhofer, but didn't have the courage to go beyond a certain point in his
work.  The happy artist has done his job.  The frustrated artist ( the young
one ) , still can't figure out his job, or his relationship to it.</P>
<P>Using the hand of a real artist ( Frenchman Bernard Dufour ), doing  work in
real time, the life in the canvas begins to grow, from mere sketches to a
real piece of work.</P>
<P>STUNNING FILM.
IT WILL KEEP YOU THINKING THE WHOLE TIME.
BEAUTIFULL ART, and a chance to see an artist at it.
( If you get bored easily, forget this film ... )</P>
