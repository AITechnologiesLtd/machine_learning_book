<P>  Jakob the Liar (1999) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Robin Williams, Alan
Arkin, Bob Balaban, Michael Jeter, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Liev Schreiber</P>
<P> "Jakob the Liar" unfolds like a Sholemcq Aleichem story: Through a
misunderstanding, an unimportant little man suddenly gains stature and
influence that he neither wants nor deserves.</P>
<P> However, instead of some turn-of-the-century shtetl in Russia, this story
is set in an unnamed Polish city's Jewish ghetto during World War II.</P>
<P> Jakob (Robin Williams), like everyone else in the ghetto, lives with death
on a daily basis. People are shot at random, put into cattle cars or commit
suicide.</P>
<P> Jakob only wants to stay alive and away from the Nazis.</P>
<P> One night, though, near curfew he is accused of trying to escape from the
ghetto and is sent to the office of a Gestapo official.</P>
<P> There he hears a radio broadcast and sees a map that pinpoints Russian
troop deployments, indicating they are only 400 miles away and closing fast.</P>
<P> This information bolsters his spirits, and when he is allowed to return to
the ghetto, he determines to spread the information among his friends, thus
giving them hope.</P>
<P> But, like the story that is passed around the campfire, changing from
person to person until it is barely unrecognizable, the other ghetto
residents come to believe that Jakob has a hidden radio and begin pestering
him for more news on the war's progress.</P>
<P> Despite his various protestations, no one believes Jakob when he insists
he has no radio. Situations begin to escalate in comic and tragic turns.
People begin treating him with respect and he becomes a reluctant leader in
the community.</P>
<P> Jakob seems like a role created for Williams. He is funny, yet subdued as
the circumstances demand. His asides and mutterings to himself are pure
Williams, and that is the flaw in his performance. He doesn't come across
as a poor, simple, scared former potato vendor, but as a big-time actor
doing a star turn with an affected Eastern European accent.</P>
<P> The movie, directed by Peter Kassovitz with a screenplay by Kassovitz and
Didier Decoin, struggles to blend comedy with the horror of the Holocaust,
while also trying to keep an reverent tone concerning that nightmare.</P>
<P> They succeed partially. Kassovitz is able to convey the casualness of the
brutality and death the Jews were forced to endure. It seems so impersonal
that it lacks any emotional resonance or shock.</P>
<P> Despite a strong cast, including Alan Arkin, Bob Balaban, Michael Jeter,
Armin Mueller-Stahl and Liev Schreiber, Jakob the Liar feels cold and
impersonal. The performances by all concerned are good, but a spark,
something to ignite the audience's emotions, is lacking.</P>
<P> "Jakob the Liar," unlike "Life Is Beautiful" - to which it will be
compared mostly - and "Schindler's List," fails to touch  our hearts and
souls concerning the plight of these unfortunate people persecuted simply
because they are Jewish.</P>
<P> Like the film's setting, "Jakob the Liar" is cold and gray. It neither
inspires nor shocks. It just sits like a cold, day-old potato pancake.</P>
