eXistenZ (director: David Cronenberg; cast: Jennifer Jason Leigh
(Allegra Geller), Jude Law (Ted Pikul), Ian Holm (Kiri Vinokur), Don
McKellar (Yevgeny Nourish), Sarah Polley (Merle),Willem Dafoe (Gas),
Callum Keith Rennie (Hugo Carlaw), Kris Lemche (Noel Dichter), 1999)</P>
<P>This escapist movie is sponsored in part by Sega, influenced in part by
the death threat on Indian author Salmun Rushdie, and it sure feels like
a '60s bad acid trip ala video game that the twelve game players in the
film are into. The battle that takes place is between the dreaded
realists and the creative ones. The film takes on the theme of fighting
censorship and finding out who the real you is.William Burroughs
influenced Cronenberg with the idea that what you create as an artist
becomes a living thing, it goes out into the world and has a life of its
own but is still connected to you.</P>
<PRE>So far, so good.</PRE>
<P>Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is the creator of the newest and
most innovative virtual reality game, eXistenZ. It is pronounced with
philosophical pretensions as "eggs is tense." As the game starts, she is
attacked by a realist with a gristle gun, that is made of mammal flesh
and bones, and shoots human teeth instead of bullets. The security guard
Ted Pikul (Jude) is really a marketing trainee from the company that
sponsors the 38 million dollar game, who comes to her rescue and they
flee, prepared to trust no one from now on but only to take pleasure in
the game they are in.</P>
<P>A game is only a game. And two heads are better than one. These could be
some slogans for a game that has no explanation or purpose for its
existence. You get to know about it only when you play it.</P>
<P>To play the game, means you have to penetrate the body by means of bio
ports, which are  openings in the spine. They must be lubricated before
being penetrated with ersatz umbilical cords being connected to
"metaflesh game pods." That's a fleshy lump with several nipples,
and it's meant to be stroked by game players. You see the obvious
allusions to sex in the game's foreplay.</P>
<P>All this game stuff is really not that interesting to see. The two stars
are only mildly diverting, arousing no particular warm feelings for
their plight. Their aim is to provide suspense and a dark sense of
humor, which they do on occasion. But they fail in achieving any depth
in their characters; therefore, they are seen only as being the game
figures they are portraying.</P>
<P>The main supporting cast includes Willem DaFoe as Gas and Ian Holm as
Kiri. Both in minor roles. Gas operates a gas station (natch) where the
fleeing couple stop to get Ted a bio port he needs to be in the game;
his new pod will also help Allegra repair the pod she had damaged during
the attack on her.</P>
<P>Dafoe, who claims to have had his life saved by Allegra's game, must
take credit for having the funniest line in the movie. It comes about
when Ted asks, "Why do you still run a gas station?" He replies, "Only
on the most pathetic level of reality."</P>
<P>Kiri is a game character who talks with a thick European accent. As a
scientist living in a remote sking village, he will operate on Allegra's
diseased pod, which is a result of Gas trying to ruin her pod for a
rival game company... For Allegra, her pod is vital, as it holds the
only formula to the game in it.</P>
<P>The film sinks downhill from here on. It becomes about squishy "mutated
amphibians" and double-crosses by rival game company spies, and realists
who feel threatened by the escapists. The characters act out who they
are in the game, until they can't tell if they are playing a game or if
what is happening to them is real. Most of the action scenes take place
in a trout farm and a Chinese restaurant. But much of the story just
didn't add up and the virtual reality didn't look so hot, either.</P>
<P>The only thing left to be accomplished was a surprise ending, and that
comes as sure as a heart attack. The only thing is, that the surprise
ending really came too late too save the film, and if you thought about
it, it didn't make sense, unless you believe that the two best game
players were ironically the one's who were really anti-gamers; that is,
inspite of their negative energy they were still able to excel in the
game.</P>
<P>After a belated assassination when the game is supposedly over, the film
ends on this conversation between the two game winners, Allegra and Ted:
As Ted asks, "Are we still in the game?" He said, "Tell me the truth,
are we still in the game?"</P>
<P>Cronenberg needs more than ideas for his next film, he needs a good
script and actors who are more suited for their roles.The biggest
mistake was in the casting of Jude Law as a romantic hero. He didn't
have the charisma to pull off his part...This virtual reality story left
me thinking that it could have been done with more fluidity and feeling.</P>
