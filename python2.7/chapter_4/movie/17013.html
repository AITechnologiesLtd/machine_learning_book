<PRE>                     THE OTHER SISTER
                A movie review by Joe Barlow
                    (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:   Juliette Lewis, Diane Keaton, Tom Skerritt,
                Giovanni Ribisi, Poppy Montgomery,
                Sarah Paulson, Hector Elizondo
DIRECTOR:   Garry Marshall
WRITERS:    Alexandra Rose and Blair Richwood
RATED:      PG-13
RELEASED:   1999</PRE>
<PRE>         RATING: * 1/2  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        There is a scene early in "The Other Sister" which
demonstrates the kind of film it could have been.  Carla Tate
(Juliette Lewis), a slightly retarted young woman in her late
teens, has just come home from an institution.  Sitting at
the dinner table with her family for the first time in a decade,
Carla proudly eats her meal with a fork, something she was
unable to do the last time they saw her.  No one at the table
notices, or offers any sort of positive reinforcement.
Undeterred, Carla continues to eat her food, though her eyes
register a subtle look of hurt and disappointment.</P>
<P>        It's a thoughtful scene, indicative of a movie that
plans to take an honest, unabashed look at the world of the
mentally handicapped and the challenges and triumphs
contained therein.  Unfortunately, it's the only such moment
in the film.  "The Other Sister" rapidly plummets to the
level of crowd-pleasing formula, cheerfully abandoning the
opportunity to say anything worthwhile.  Worse, director
Garry Marshall and his screenwriters seem to be laughing
at the concept of retardation, and encouraging, no,
*begging*, the audience to do the same.</P>
<P>        Carla has a difficult time adjusting to home life,
thanks to her mother, Elizabeth (Diane Keaton), a stuffy,
overbearing woman who seems determined to shape her
daughter into something she has no interest in being.
Although her father Bradley (Tom Skerrit) is loving
and supportive, Carla's mother seems determined to
prevent her from doing anything that might indicate
normality, such as going to college or moving out on
her own.  Eventually, however, our heroine meets
Daniel McMann (Giovanni Ribisi), a retarded student
at a nearby technical school.  His sense of adventure
and independence impress Carla; soon the pair are
romantically linked, allowing the film to set up scene
after scene of standard romantic fare.</P>
<P>        There is barely a moment in "The Other Sister"
that deviates from convention or shows any independent
thought whatsoever.  Some examples: we have a "falling
in love" montage.  We have the required "couple has a
big fight and split up, only to get back together again"
scene.  We have an overbearing parent, which is standard
issue for any film that centers around a teenager.  And
when Carla's mother angrily announces that she doesn't
want Carla to have anything to do with Daniel, I was able
to predict the moment of reconciliation within three
seconds of when it actually appeared on the screen.</P>
<P>        An adherence to cliche is to be expected in films
of this nature, though, and it's not why I disliked the
movie.  I was offended and annoyed by the fact that "The
Other Sister" exists in a perpetual state of contradiction
with itself.  Carla understandably gets furious any time she
thinks people are laughing at her; indeed, one such scene
which occurs near the story's climax is heart-wrenching.
But despite this, the film continuiously gives Carla and
Daniel ridiculous dialogue that's clearly intended to be
funny:</P>
<PRE>        CARLA: I wonder who thought up sex in
                 the first place.
        DANIEL: I think it was Madonna.</PRE>
<P>        Why does Marshall want us to laugh at the
ignorance of the same people the film is supposedly
championing?  Why does the movie abandon the more
thoughtful issues it raises without so much as a
backwards glance (such as the scene in which a young
Carla pushes a little boy down the steps and severely
injures him, and another in which Daniel is being
evicted by his father for flunking out of school)?  Why
can't it devote more thought to a subplot involving
Carla's gay sister Heather (Sarah Paulson)?  As it
stands, the Heather character seems to included for no
other reason than lesbianism is "in" at the moment.</P>
<P>        The acting is acceptable, although neither Lewis
or Ribisi are completely convincing in these challenging
roles.  Again, I blame the script more than the actors:
their lines make them come off not as mentally retarded,
but as stand-up comedians with funny voices, rather like
Adam Sandler in "The Waterboy."</P>
<P>        From beginning to end, I despised "The Other
Sister," a movie which tells us not to laugh at the
disadvantaged... then conveys them as loveable goofballs
continuously spouting sitcom-tinged dialogue.  It tries
to convince us that the mentally handicapped are valiant
people, struggling in the face of adversity and deserving
our respect (a sentiment I agree with), then makes them
appear so "cutesy" that one is reminded of trained
animals performing tricks at the circus.  This is a film
that didn't need to be made, and doesn't need to be seen.</P>
