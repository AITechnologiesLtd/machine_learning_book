Reviewed by Christian Pyle
Directed by Howard Deutch  
Written by Vince McKewin 
Starring Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Brooke Langton, Jack Warden, Jon 
Favreau, Rhys Ifans, and Orlando Jones
Grade: C+</PRE>
<P>Once upon a time, the professional football players went on strike with four 
games left in the regular season.  The owner of the Washington Sentinels 
(Jack Warden) orders his head coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) to find a 
team of replacement players.  His choices:  quarterback Shane "Footsteps" 
Falco (Keanu Reeves), who was headed for the pros before an embarrassing loss 
in the Sugar Bowl; defensive player Daniel Bateman (Jon Favreau), a psycho  
SWAT cop; kicker Nigel Gruff (Rhys Ifans), a Welsh soccer player; wide 
receiver Clifford Franklin (Orlando Jones), who runs like the wind but can't 
catch the ball; two gigantic guards (Faizon Love and Michael Taliferro); a 
deaf guy (David Denman); a preacher (Troy Winbush); a convict (Michael Jace); 
and a sumo wrestler (Ace Yonamine).  Meanwhile, head cheerleader Annabelle 
Farrell (Brooke Langton) is looking for a new squad and finds exotic dancers. </P>
<P>"The Replacements" provides many good laughs.  My favorite is a scene where 
Franklin leads the team in a chorus of Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive."  The 
mixture of backgrounds and personality quirks among the players leads to some 
hilariously unconventional plays, made all the funnier by the running 
commentary from announcers John Madden and Pat Summerall.</P>
<P>Favreau steals the show.  He plays the psycho to the hilt, charging wild-eyed 
like a furious bull into the other players.  Jones, a veteran of "MAD TV" and 
the star of the "Make 7-UP Yours" commercials, also is a reliable 
laugh-factory.  The rest of the cast is considerably weaker, and several of 
the characters are barely developed.  I generally hate Reeves, but in 
"Replacements" he doesn't give me an excuse; he plays it straight up the 
middle:  no stoner dude, no cyberpunk messiah.  Hackman seems to be enjoying 
his vacation from real acting, and he dispenses nuggets of wisdom with 
authority.  </P>
<P>I wasn't too far into "The Replacements" before I began to compare it to 
1989's "Major League."  Although they're about different sports, the plots 
are the same (a bunch of misfits have to merge into a team in order to make 
it to the championship).  Of the two, "Major League" is by far the better 
movie because it devotes more time to developing not only the characters but 
also their relationships.  In "The Replacements," for example, there's an 
animosity between Favreau's cop and Jace's convict because of their career 
choices, but the filmmakers don't take it any farther.  However, in "Major 
League," Corbin Bernsen's snob hates Charlie Sheen's ex-con, and the tension 
is advanced when Bernsen's wife seduces Sheen.</P>
<P>On the other hand, "The Replacements" is much better than either of the 
sequels to "Major League."  </P>
<P>Bottom line:  In a laugh-free summer, this may be your only relief.</P>
