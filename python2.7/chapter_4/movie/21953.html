<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Actor Tim Roth's directorial debut has already garnered incredible
reviews and multiple awards/nominations during its European run.  But as
The War Zone is set to open in North America, it lacks both a major
distributor and the buzz necessary to propel the film through the award
season.  The reason is simple - the theme of the film (incest) is just
too disturbing.  When the director describes his feelings toward the
subject matter as "disgusting and evil," marketers and potential viewers
tend to back away.  The last film that shook me up this much was
Anjelica Huston's Bastard Out of Carolina (ironically, another actor
making a directorial debut), which went straight to cable because of the
premise (child abuse).</P>
<P>The War Zone opens in an isolated part of North Devon, where a family of
four has just moved from London.  They appear to be a happy, cohesive
unit - wisecracking, blue-collar Dad (Ray Winstone, Nil By Mouth),
pregnant Mum (Tilda Swinton, Orlando) and their two teenage children
that miss the bustle of London: 18-year-old Jesse (Lara Belmont) and
15-year-old Tom (Freddie Cunliffe).  Other than being a little open with
nudity, the family seems to be as normal as can be.  But, then again,
the Burhams seemed pretty normal on the surface of American Beauty, too.</P>
<P>After the birth of his baby sister, Tom begins to suspect something
devious is going on between his dad and Jessie.  He thinks they may have
been in the shower together and he finds naked pictures of his older
sister in a dresser.  Tom confronts Jessie, but she denies everything. 
As his suspicion grows, you can almost feel the emptiness in Tom's
stomach when he watches Dad play with the new baby.  Then, one day in an
old military bunker near their home, Tom stumbles onto a situation that
will forever change the family.</P>
<P>The film is brutal to watch, even for a hardened viewer like myself.  At
the screening I attended during the Toronto International Film Festival,
many film fans walked out during the bunker scene.  One man shouted "Is
this really necessary?" at the screen before loudly chastising the
remaining audience for "just sitting there."  His ranting could still be
heard as he stormed through the lobby and out the door.  The scene is
that powerful.  It seems to go on for ages and was uncomfortable enough
before the outburst.</P>
<P>Roth's (Hoodlum) filmmaking debut is as good as they come, purposefully
leaving many questions open after the credits roll.  He refused to
answer many questions during the Q&A session after the screening, often
responding "Well, what do you think?" to queries about characters.  He
appeared visibly nervous, saying that the book (written by Alexander
Stuart) made him weep, while the subject matter "disturbs the f--- out
of him."  Roth, who alluded to the fact that he too was a victim of
similar abuse, said that he tried to be honest and respectful to the
subject matter that obviously hit close to him for him and a surprising
portion of the audience.</P>
<P>During the Q&A, Belmont was standing off in the shadows near the
theatre's exit.  As people began to leave, they would see the amazing
actress, approach her and, unable to vocalize their feelings, touch her
hand before hurrying out the door, their eyes brimming with tears.  Her
performance is beyond incredible and, amazingly, The War Zone is her
first acting gig.  Ditto for Cunliffe, in a portrayal of a young teen at
an age when he should be discovering his own sexuality, but instead
finds a nightmare beyond words.  Roth explained that he cast these roles
with the intention of using unknowns.  In addition to the fine acting
and direction, cinematographer Seamus McGarvey (The Winter Guest) helps
to apply a bleak, cold feel to the film.  Like it wouldn't have been
anyway.</P>
