<PRE>SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE
Rating: *** (out of four)
R, 1998
Director: John Madden
Screenplay: Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard
Starring Cast: Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes</PRE>
<P>SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is a story built out of one of those "what-if"
scenarios. In this case, it's "What if William Shakespeare had a romantic
relationship that came to an unfortunate ending around the time he was
writing 'Romeo and Juliet'?" Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow star
respectively as The Bard and Viola De Lesseps, an upper-class woman doomed
to a marriage she despises. Screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard
deftly weave elements of Shakespeare's style, such as disguises, mistaken
identities, and mistakenly attributed guilt, into this story, creating what
was probably the favorite film of all English professors across the
country. "Cute," "clever," "funny," and "charming" are all words I would
use to describe this entertaining trip through 16th-century England as
Shakespeare probably knew it. Words I would not  use to describe it,
however, are "best film of the year" or "worthy of thirteen Oscar
nominations." Yes, it's a lot of fun, and yes, it's intelligently written,
but I'm afraid I don't see much more to it than that: the story is
essentially a prolonged gimmick, and some of the most poignant dialogue is
not the screenwriters' but Shakespeare's, when Fiennes and Paltrow end up
playing the parts of Romeo and Juliet on the afternoon of the play's
premiere. Still, I was never bored for a second, and SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is
refreshingly devoid of the clichés and melodrama that plague many a
romantic comedy.</P>
