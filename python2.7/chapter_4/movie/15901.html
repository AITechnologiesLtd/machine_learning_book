STEPMOM
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Director Chris Columbus's STEPMOM, which would have more appropriately
been titled MOMMY'S DYING, wants to be two movies.</P>
<P>As seen in the film's light-hearted trailers, STEPMOM wants to be a
comedic look at the perils of being a stepmother, and, indeed, the
movie's first act sticks to that plan.</P>
<P>After this breezy start, the movie quickly slips into bathos with scenes
of CAT scans, chemotherapy, and a mother's dying.  Rather than examining
the relatively unexplored territory of stepmothering, the movie wants,
most of all, to be another terminal illness picture, of which we have
one a month.  The maudlin script, by a committee of no less than 5
writers, expects you to bring extra tissues and use every one of them.</P>
<P>In a stellar performance, Susan Sarandon plays Jackie, the obsessively
prepared and sanctimonious mother.  Jackie has her two kids' lives as
perfectly organized as the rigidly positioned post-its on her
refrigerator that specify their monthly schedules.  Whenever they go
out, she packs them a first-aid kit so complete that doctors would envy
it.</P>
<P>Jackie's kids are a cloyingly sweet 7-year-old, Ben (Liam Aiken), and a
smart-mouthed with a heart-of-gold 12-year-old, Anna (Jena Malone).  As
Luke, their busy father, Ed Harris is the show's wallpaper in front of
which the two female leads enact their drama.</P>
<P>Julia Roberts plays Luke's live-in girlfriend and soon-to-be wife,
Isabel.  Isabel is an efficient and talented fashion photographer whose
beauty outshines all of her models.  The treacly script has a throwaway
and not credible subplot about her being fired for trying to mix a
career with parenting.  Anna hates her and fires cheap insults at her at
every opportunity.  Ben is more flexible about his treatment of his
stepmother.  "Mommy, if you want me to hate her I will," he tells Jackie
with a sincere innocence.  Think the kids will eventually fall in love
with the stepmom they hate?  Well, duh!</P>
<P>The film is at its best when it tries to grapple with the issues and
conflicts surrounding divorce and remarriage.  Luke tries to explain to
Ben that one of his parents had to move out since they were constantly
fighting.  "I fight with Anna all the time," Ben retorts.  "Can I move
out?"</P>
<P>The sudsy movie got some of the best response from our audience when
Isabel finally stopped stifling her emotions and told the pompous mother
to shove it by laying into her with some carefully chosen expletives.</P>
<P>The by-the-numbers plot has Isabel taking the kids to Central Park while
she conducts a photo shoot.  One of the kids - surprise! - gets lost,
which makes Isabel feel very bad about not being a dutiful parent like
Jackie.  And Jackie gets to rant and rave and generally feel superior.</P>
<P>The body of the movie has Jackie getting sicker and sicker, while trying
to hide her terminal cancer.  Jackie and Isabel eventually, of course,
bury the hatchet and become bosom buddies.  (We know that they are soul
mates at heart since they each independently lead the kids in a
sing-a-long and lip-synch to their favorite song, Marvin Gaye's "Ain't
No Mountain High Enough.")</P>
<P>Try as hard as they can, the superlative acting by Sarandon and Roberts
can not overcome the schmaltzy material.  Manipulative to the end, the
movie prolongs Jackie's dying as long as possible.  It wants to wring
every last tear possible out of the audience.</P>
<P>STEPMOM runs too long at 2:04.  It is rated PG-13 for profanity,
thematic elements and dope smoking and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
