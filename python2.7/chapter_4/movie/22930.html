<PRE>LIFE OF BRIAN (1979)</PRE>
<P>Director: Terry Jones
With: Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin,
Terry Gilliam</P>
<P>In the BBC's satirical show "Not the 9 o'clock news", there was a sketch in
which an anglican bishop has to defend himself from accusations that the
general synod's latest movie "Life of Christ" is a blatant parody on Monty
Python. The Life of Brian stirred up some controversy when it first came
out, in Norway it was initially banned for blasphemy, and only released in
1982. What was all the fuss about? The second full-length motion picture
from the English comedy-group Monty Python (Chapman, Cleese, Idle, Jones,
Palin and Gilliam). </P>
<P>Their first film, "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" tackled the Arthurian
cycle from the Middle Ages. For this one, they turned to the new testament.
A brilliant idea, and one certain to raise controversy. Some people will
always think that the Bible simply shouldn't be a topic of comedy. Monty
Python thought differently, and the result was a hilarious movie that is -
at least to my mind - free of any real blasphemy. Christ himself is never
treated with disrespect, indeed he is only a peripheral figure in this
film. The comedy is mainly at the expense of ordinary people, in high
places or in low, and the things that they do. And some of it is just plain
crazy.</P>
<P>As one would expect, the film is basically one long sequence of sketches,
tied together by the story of Brian (Graham Chapman). Brian is born in a
stable in Bethlehem in the year 0. (Not _the_ stable though, that's the one
next door!) His life is completely ordinary, until he joins the People's
Front of Judea, an extreme terrorist organization, devoted to driving the
Romans out, toppling the Roman Empire and then taking over the world.
Romani ite domum! Eventually he is captured by the Romans, escapes and,
completely randomly and involuntarily, gains a large following of people
who believe he is the Messiah. And all he ever wanted to do was make an
impression on the beautiful Judith...</P>
<P>Monty Python's style of comedy is one that you either love or hate. More
precisely, you either become a fanatical devotee, and start tracking down
tapes of all the TV-shows and movies, or you just don't understand what's
so funny. The latter group seems to be in a minority though, and
understandably so. Monty Python's comedy has something for all. One part
physical comedy (John Cleese hopping, Terry Jones naked), one part verbal
humour and word-plays, ("Blessed are the cheesemakers. Well, he was
obviously referring to makers of dairy-products in general!") gently
sprinkled with Terry Gilliam's crazy animations. And the diversity of
characters: everything from the snobbish Romans to the dominating mother,
to the haggling shopkeeper, to the would-be revolutionaries - all
character-types we can instantly recognize from our own lives or our own
societies.</P>
<P>Who should see this film: Anyone who has ever laughed, or wanted to laugh,
at a comedy. A note to Christian fundamentalists: Remember that crucifixion
_was_ a common punishment in the Roman Empire.</P>
<PRE>My verdict: 6 (out of 6)</PRE>
