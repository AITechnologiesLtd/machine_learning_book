<PRE>                              ESCAPE FROM L.A.
                       A film review by Steve Kong
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>In the year 2000 Los Angeles is flattened and separated from mainland US by a 
large earthquake. The President of the United States predicted this incident. 
And after the earthquake, the President makes it possible for the term of 
office to be life-long. This is no regular President either, he flies in the 
Air Force Three and is a very religious person. L.A. is turned into a prison 
island, where the murderers, rapists, thieves, and atheists are sent for the 
rest of their lives.</P>
<P>Snake Plissken, a well known military man and now criminal, is caught and 
given an offer. The offer comes from the President. His daughter after 
spending some time, together with a bad gangster on L.A. island, in a virtual 
reality world, has now run away. She's run away with a very dangerous weapon, 
and the President's offer to Snake is to get the device back. Snake would then 
be forgiven for all his past wrongdoings. Snake doesn't really want to do it, 
but is convinced into it after learning that he has a deadly virus coursing 
through his system. And, using a classic movie device, the virus is a timed 
virus. Snake on has less than a day to get the device back before he dies. If 
he gets the device back, he gets the antidote.</P>
<P>Escape From L.A. is a grand escapist film. It takes us to the Island L.A., 
which looks like sets from Blade Runner after a large earthquake. The action 
in Escape is wildly over the top and satisfyingly fun. The action ranges from 
underwater submarine rides to surfing a tsunami. Kurt Russell's Snake is a 
tough guy with a low grumbling voice and a dark sense of humor. 
I have not seen Escape from New York, which was the "prequel" to Escape From 
L.A., so I cannot give a comparison to it. </P>
<P>Escape From L.A. is an awesome two hours that tries to be nothing more than 
what it is, an action film. There is a large dose of violence in the film that 
makes the film unsuitable for the younger crowd and the squimish. If you like 
action films don't miss Escape From L.A.</P>
