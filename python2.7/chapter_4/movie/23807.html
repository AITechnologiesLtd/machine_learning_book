Susan Granger's review of "PRICE OF GLORY" (New Line Cinema)</PRE>
<P>Jimmy Smits has a lot riding on this picture; it's the movie for 
which he killed off his character in TV's "NYPD Blue." Written by sports 
columnist Phil Berger and directed by Carlos Avila, who developed the concept at the Sundance Institute, it's the story of a Mexican immigrant, Arturo Ortega (Smits), a pushy retired boxer who is trying to instill the prizefighting spirit in his three sons, Sonny (Jon Seda), Jimmy (Clifton Collins Jr.), and Johnny (Ernesto Hernandez). Like Don Corleone and his three sons in "The Godfather," it's a cultural heritage saga - with boxing 
being the primary way for Latinos to break out of the Arizona barrio.  The film opens with the ill-fated match that dashed Arturo's dreams of being a champion in the late '70s. Then there are glimpses of the boys growing up, being trained to be boxers, so the scene is set for the primary drama, which takes place in the present. According to Arturo's plans, two of his sons will fight; the third will go to college. Only things don't always go as planned.  Jimmy Smits captures the universality of the well-intentioned but ill-advised father-figure ("Everything I've ever done is for you boys!") with Maria Del Mar as a persuasive counter-balance as the mother. In melodramatic, cliche-ridden characterizations, Clifton Collins Jr. is cocky and rebellious, while Ernesto Hernandez is obedient and eager-to-please. But it's Golden Gloves alum Jon Seda (TV's "Homicide") who delivers the knockout performance as a man whose dreams extend far beyond the ring. In supporting roles, Ron Perlman !
is a ruthless promoter with Paul Rodriguez as a greedy insider. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Price of Glory" is a solemn, sweat-stained 6. Essentially, it's an old-fashioned, tough-love family drama set within the realm of boxing.</P>
