<P>Consider Runaway Bride the film equivalent of a ten year reunion of the
folks who made Pretty Woman (it's a couple of months short, but close
enough for rock n roll). Rather than retread old ground -- high-powered
successful businessman plays Prince Charming to a hard-working working
girl whose Chosen Profession would indicate a deep seated aversion to
commitment -- The Runaway Bride ups the stakes by making our principle
characters, a nationally syndicated newspaper columnist and the
hard-working woman he wrongs in his column, natural enemies.</P>
<P>Richard Gere is Ike Graham, whose problem meeting deadlines finally
brings him down when he runs with a storyline picked up at his local
bar. Target of the column, as usual, is a woman (Graham so irks his
femme readers that they all slap him on sight). Maggie Carpenter (Julia
Roberts), who lives in Hale, Maryland, has run from the altar at least
three times and her misadventures have made her the laughingstock of the
community. Thus the film title. Ike's ex-wife Ellie, also his editor at
USA Today (Rita Wilson), fires him when a letter from Maggie points out
seventeen factual inaccuracies in the column. Ellie's new husband Fisher
(Hector Elizondo), also Ike's best friend, finds an assignment for him
at another magazine, to cover Maggie's fourth attempt. If Maggie runs,
Ike is vindicated.</P>
<P>But when he hits town,  Maggie recognizes Ike. She and best friend Peggy
(Joan Cusack) do their best to humiliate and otherwise ignore the man,
who still manages to befriend almost everyone in town, including
Maggie's family and fiancee, Bob (Chris Meloni). The friendlier Ike
gets, the more frustrated Maggie gets, until she realizes it's just
better to cooperate with his research and  story and prove that, yes
indeedy, she can make the walk down the aisle without bolting for
freedom.</P>
<P>Which is where the star chemistry kicks in and I'll leave you hanging.</P>
<P>Face it folks,  you know how it's going to turn out, when all is said
and done. The part we all want to see is that moment when Gere and
Roberts look at each other and know this is it. Getting there is a
fairly average dateflick. That moment, when it arrives, is absolutely
perfect and electric.</P>
<P>But this flick ain't over. heh heh heh.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Runaway Bride, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$5.00</PRE>
<P>It's a date flick, and a pretty average one, until the star power kicks
in. From that point, things pick up mightily.</P>
