<PRE>                        MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY
                       A film review by Jon Webb
                        Copyright 1993 Jon Webb</PRE>
<P>     This is a solid Woody Allen film, not unlike some of his earlier
comedies (ANNIE HALL and PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM come to mind, though this
is more realistic).  Woody and Diane Keaton are a bored middle-aged
couple, drifting towards divorce, when Keaton gets interested in
the--to her--strange actions of a neighbor.  She decides that a murder
has occurred, and that she will solve it.  Woody, of course,
disbelieves everything and worries incessantly.</P>
<P>     Angelica Huston and Alan Alda also play significant roles, and do
it well.  Given Allen's recent problems, it's apparent that his friends
rallied to help him make this film, which must have been a relief from
the trial and the accusations in the press.</P>
<P>     You can really see Allen reaching to reconnect with his
traditional audience her.  He does his nervous variations on
Chaplin-esque moves, like constantly rearranging his cards while
playing poker.  The scene in the elevator is a classic.</P>
<P>     The movie includes the jerky hand-held camera style he explored in
HUSBANDS AND WIVES but it is not so annoying here.  There's only one
scene where the effect is really noticeable, and even there it is not
so bad as to make one dizzy, as in his last film.</P>
