<P>     Sometimes, a movie just can't live up to its advertising campaign
(or its name, for that matter).  DUMB AND DUMBER is one such case.
Take the newspaper ad, for example, filled with all those fake, witty
quotes.  That's rather clever (although not original).  Unfortunately,
the same kind of humorists weren't involved in writing the script.
"Dumb" actually overestimates the film's intelligence.</P>
<P>     At its best, DUMB AND DUMBER is like an Ernest movie with a
scatological bent.  Of course, there's as much a place in motion
pictures for lowbrow humor as there is for philosophical morality
tales, but that assumes the jokes actually work.  While I won't claim
to have gone through this entire film without laughing, there are some
long periods between chuckles.  It's frequently like that with
flatulence humor--you find it amusing the first time you're exposed
to it (at the age of maybe five or six), but it quickly gets tiresome.</P>
<P>     The thin plot thread upon which DUMB AND DUMBER hangs (not that
anyone is seeing this picture for its storyline) has limo driver Lloyd
Christmas (Jim Carrey) retrieving a briefcase left behind in an airport
by a beautiful client (Lauren Holly).  Along with his best friend and
roommate Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels), Lloyd starts the long drive west
from Providence to Aspen to find his dream woman and return the locked
briefcase, which just happens to be filled with money.  The
cross-country trek isn't easy, however.  Not only are the intrepid duo
lumbered with IQs barely into the double-digits (they make Forrest Gump
look like a genius), but they're being pursued by a pair of crooks
(Mike Starr and Karen Duffy) who want the money.  Fortunately for Lloyd
and Harry, the bad guys aren't exactly Valedictorian material, either.</P>
<P>     While I found Jim Carrey tolerable (and, at times, even likable)
in THE MASK, here he's back to his ACE VENTURA worst.  If you
appreciate Carrey, his first movie, or anything featuring Jim Varney's
cinematic alter-ego, DUMB AND DUMBER is likely your sort of
experience.  Everyone else will either be offended, bored, or both.</P>
<P>     And has Jeff Daniels' career really come to this?  With GETTYSBURG
and SPEED, things had been looking up.</P>
<P>     For a movie that, with some reworking, could have come close to an
extended MONTY PYTHON-type skit (and there is a bit about a dead
parakeet), DUMB AND DUMBER ends up aiming a whole lot lower.  This is
more BENNY HILL territory.  Then again, that's probably being unkind to
the late British gentleman, since he did that kind of humor long before
this tiresome screenplay came along.</P>
