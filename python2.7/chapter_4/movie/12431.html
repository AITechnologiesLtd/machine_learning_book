<P>   Japan may have problems accepting western-style
feminism, but we all believe that it's a land of balance and
harmony, with virtually no crime, with divorce unthinkable. 
But Takeshi Kitano upsets the popular stereotype in
"Fireworks," known also by the Japanese title "Hani Bi"--which
means "flower" and "fire."  There are fireworks aplenty in
Kitano's picture but also a great deal of gentleness, two
virtues which are combined in its principal character, Kitano,
who also wrote and directed.  As a genre-bender, the movie
can confuse viewers who can't place it in the category of
police/action-adventure but also feel uncomfortable calling it a
comedy or a family melodrama.  It's all of these, and in a way
the contrasting assets of its principal performer can be taken
as a metaphor for Japan itself--a country known for the
utmost in etiquette and politeness but one which is no
stranger to the unspeakably cruel wartime acts.</P>
<P>   Handsomely photographed by Hideo Yamamoto and
creatively edited by appropriate flashbacks by Kitano and
Yoshinori Oota, the film--which played at the 1997 New York
Film Festival--centers on Yoshitaka Nishi, a tough guy toward
his many enemies, a sentimental dope when considering his
wife and friends.  Placed at a crossroads by a series of
tragedies which seem to have piled up all at once, Nishi is
exceptionally violent because of feelings of guilt, a kind and
tender husband to his wife when she needs him most.</P>
<P>   Known as a top-grade police detective, Nishi snatched
some time off to pay a visit to his hospitalized wife who is
dying of leukemia on the very day that his partner, Horibe
(Ren Osugi), took a paralyzing bullet in the back.  Confined to
a wheelchair, Horibe is left without a job and, perhaps even
worse, his wife and child have deserted him.  With little to do
to occupy his time, he takes up painting and, in one of the
movie's thrusts at deadpan comedy, he receives a paint set
and beret from his remorseful ex-partner, Nishi.  Nishi has
also left the police force, has borrowed money from a loan-
shark in the yakuzi (organized crime, Japanese style), and
has dedicated himself to caring for his wife during her final
weeks.  His preoccupation is interrupted several times during
the course of the story as the gangsters make incessant
demands on him to pay his debt with interest.  In the picture's
most dramatic scene, he suddenly takes out the eye of one of
the harassing hoodlums with a chopstick while putting the
other hoodlum away with appropriate force.  In a bloody
flashback, director Kitano recreates a scene in which two
detectives are shot by a criminal followed by Nishi's furious
burst of gunfire to the perpetrator's head. For good measure,
Nishi empties his revolver into the corpse.</P>
<P>   Kitano's specialty is shocking the audience, which he does
not only by displaying buckets of blood but by taking us off
balance with Nishi's surprising sensitivity.  In one scene that
could be used by the Japan Tourist Office to enourage winter
vacations in that country, Nishi is shown bringing laughter to
his depressed wife Miyuki (Kayoko Kishimoto) in a lovely
resort overlooking Mount Fuji.  Nishi lights fireworks for her
and helps a child they met on the beach to fly her kite.</P>
<P>   Kitano avoids the cliches of the American-style police film
by stylizing the violence, presenting it without sounds in one
take and in slow motion in another.  His camera does not
dwell on the detached retina of the unfortunate fellow whose
eye is taken out by Nishi's chopstick, but rather cuts away
quickly when the ex-cop makes his jab without a split-
second's warning.</P>
<P>   Nishi is psychotic.  Like many men, he wants to be left
alone.  When he is disturbed, he does not react the way
civilized people to, but strikes out with loathing yet without
fear and without a thought to the consequences of his act. 
When he tells the broken-down owner of a junkyard that he
wants to buy a car and a flashing police light so that he can
rob a bank, he means exactly what he says.  (Incidentally,
Kitano may have spent considerable time on the junkyard with
its array of miscellaneous parts, its burly, slow-minded owner
and his disturbed daughter as a metaphor for a part of
Japanese society which is fraying at the edges.)</P>
<P>   "Fireworks" does not take much time to develop its
characters and explain the actions.  We really have no idea
why Nishi borrowed money from the yakuza or why he robs a
bank with no attempt to hide his identity.  If anything Kitano
reinforces a stereotype that westerners may have about the
inscrutability of the Japanese people, but among his primary
aims is to convey a macabre atmosphere.  He does this with
assurance. Not Rated.  Running time: 103 minutes.  (C)
