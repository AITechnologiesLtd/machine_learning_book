<P>In the opening moments of "Hollow Man," a rat scurries across the floor,
then hesitates as it hears ominous growling sounds. Suddenly, the
twitching rodent is hoisted into the air by an unseen force and we watch
as something takes a huge chunk out of the hovering animal's body. The
scene is lurid, technically stunning and quite viscous, perfectly
setting the tone for what is to follow.</P>
<P>"Hollow Man," a thriller about an invisible maniac, is a fascinating
piece of work despite its flat, obvious script; thanks to top-notch
special effects and the skewed perspective of director Paul Verhoeven,
the Dutch filmmaker who brought the world "Robocop," "Total Recall,"
"Basic Instinct," "Showgirls" and "Starship Troopers." Verhoeven is to
directing what Spinal Tap is to rock and roll, enthusiastically turning
the control knob up to 11 while assaulting viewers with heavy-handed
bursts of sex and violence. As with most Verhoeven films, "Hollow Man"
is simultaneously campy and creepy. This is a guilty pleasure with the
accent on guilty. After the closing credits, I felt an intense need to
wash my hands.</P>
<P>Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a cocky, but brilliant scientist
trying to perfect an invisibility formula for his backers at the
Pentagon. SPOILER ALERT: THE FOLLOWING REVEALS BASIC PLOT POINTS. After
a successful experiment with a gorilla, Caine decides to skip protocol
and try the process on a human being, using himself as the guinea pig.
Without the knowledge of government liaison Dr. Arthur Kramer (William
Devane), Caine convinces his teammates – ex-girlfriend Linda McCay
(Elisabeth Shue), stud muffin Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin) and
casualties-waiting-to-happen Sarah Kennedy (Kim Dickens), Carter Abbey
(Greg Grunberg), Frank Chase (Joey Slotnick) and Janice Walton (Mary
Randle) – to strap him to the table and inject the serum into his veins.</P>
<P>Within seconds, Caine is writhing in agony as he slowly begins to
disappear, a layer at a time, in a spectacular visual sequence. His skin
fades first, followed by muscles, internal organs and finally his
skeleton. After recovering from the trauma, Caine joins his comrades in
celebrating their success, but their giddiness turns to dread when
attempts to return him to visibility utterly fail.</P>
<P>While his fellow scientists struggle to find a restoration formula,
Caine's behavior takes a drastic downward turn. He begins indulging his
secret urges; copping a feel from a sleeping female teammate and spying
on Linda in the sack. When he makes a trip to the apartment of a
voluptuous neighbor, things take a violent, deeply disturbing turn.
Whether the serum or his own megalomaniacal tendencies trigger the
change is uncertain, but his crew must face the fact that their leader
has gone crazy, and their lives may be forfeit if they can't find a way
to stop him. END SPOILER ALERT.</P>
<P>Story-wise, "Hollow Man" is just a formula horror flick. In fact, Andrew
Marlowe's screenplay fumbles obvious opportunities by mostly confining
Caine to the group compound instead of unleashing him on the public.
Character development is sketchy at best; the supporting players are
one-note and Caine merely slides from being a relatively sophisticated
creep to becoming a much more dangerous one.</P>
<P>While the press notes for the film feature impressive quotes about the
corrupting nature of power, the movie never addresses them. Make no
mistake, "Hollow Man" is simply an exercise in special effects and
grisly cheap thrills. But the special effects are knockouts and it's
fascinating to watch Paul Verhoeven (to paraphrase Monty Burns from "The
Simpsons") wallow in his own directorial crapulence.</P>
<P>Verhoeven grew up in occupied Holland during World War II and witnessed
the ravages of war from a child's point of view. During a recent
interview, he acknowledged (almost grudgingly) that there is goodness in
the human spirit, but made it clear that his interest lies in the dark
side of souls.</P>
<P>Boy howdy! Verhoeven movies are veritable orgies of violence and sex,
with glossy settings and superhuman characters that treat the death of
loved ones lightly (when a scientist's body falls out of a locker, her
friends shriek in surprise, but display no sadness whatsoever) and
handle grave wounds with remarkable ease (one character sticks her
fingers deeply into the stomach wound of a colleague, announces "It
didn't cut any organs," and patches him up with duct tape (!!); then the
pair continue their very strenuous adventures).</P>
<P>It would be easy to mock or dismiss Verhoeven for the cheesy overkill.
In fact, I've done so before, particularly with "Showgirls" and
"Starship Troopers." But this time, I kept thinking of that little boy
in Holland, forced by German troops to look at piles of dead bodies on
the streets. All grown up, he copes with the memories by creating
violent films where sexy, extraordinarily powerful humans fight operatic
battles against the forces of evil. My interpretation could be wrong, of
course, but it sure makes comic book gore-porn like "Hollow Man" a lot
more interesting.</P>

<PRE>Paul Verhoeven: The Un-Hollow Man</PRE>
<PRE>By Ed Johnson-Ott</PRE>
<P>As reporters gathered in Los Angeles to interview the cast and crew of
the invisible man thriller, "Hollow Man," the topic repeatedly drifted
from the spectacular special effects in the movie to the mindset and
behavior of its director, Paul Verhoeven. The 62-year-old Dutch
filmmaker, best known to American audiences for "Robocop," "Total
Recall," "Basic Instinct," "Showgirls" and "Starship Troopers," is
dismissed by detractors as a temperamental auteur preoccupied with
juvenile displays of lurid sex and graphic violence.</P>
<P>But Verhoeven enjoys a fiercely devoted fan base as well and has
received many positive notices from critics, although some are
admittedly of the backhanded quality. For example, Andrew O'Hehir of
Salon Magazine recently comparing the director favorably to Alfred
Hitchcock, stating "Like Hitchcock, Verhoeven is an ice-veined European
expatriate whose sleek filmmaking style cannot conceal the fact that
he's not in control of his own obsessions. For both directors, male
sexual anxiety is at the center of their aesthetic universe, and both
have been accused of hating women."</P>
<P>"Hollow Man" star Elisabeth Shue went into the film aware of Verhoeven's
reputation, but left the set impressed. "I had a great experience with
him," she told me. "He was very supportive of me. He's very demanding
and I think some people misinterpret that side of him. But for me, he
was demanding in a way that made me feel challenged to do really good
work. He's very passionate and I respect that he cares a lot about the
films he's done. I would much rather deal with somebody who was mad
about their film than somebody who could care less."</P>
<P>Kevin Bacon, the Hollow Man himself, said of Verhoeven, "He has a
mercurial kind of personality, he explodes at any minute. He's
incredibly passionate. He has a tremendous kind of single-mindedness
when it comes to the execution of this movie, to getting the job done.
Being a director is a consumptive kind of job ands it requires an
amazing amount of focus, which he has. But the people who work with him
work with him a lot. The crew, for instance, has done picture after
picture with him. He is devoted to them and they are just as devoted to
him. Throughout the process, we eventually were able to establish the
relationship I like to have with a director, where they respect my
opinion about things, about character. I loved working with him."</P>
<P>When Paul Verhoeven finally entered the room for his interview, the
energy was palpable. With scraggy white hair and a pleasantly weathered
face, he speaks in a thick accent; cordial, but commanding. Verhoeven is
quite comfortable holding court, with his booming voice punching every
sentence.</P>
<P>The first thing we had to do was clear up an earlier conversation. While
promoting "Starship Troopers" with phone interviews three years ago,
Verhoeven had insisted to me that the wildly over-the-top feature was
absolutely not a satire. It was simply a war movie set in outer space.
The only satire was in the film's news broadcasts and propaganda ads, he
told me at the time. Now, he wanted to amend his remarks.</P>
<P>"I think there was a misunderstanding," he said. "What I meant was that
during the war scenes I am not commenting on it in any, let's say,
ironic or satirical way. I'm just basically showing them as they are;
they are shot like real war scenes. It's just because of the context,
and the juxtaposition with other stuff, and the structure of the movie,
that you start to feel… the idea was to put you into the war in a
realistic way and then be subversive, to show to you that you were,
basically, an idiot and a fool to cooperate. That was the idea. I pull
you in and then ask yourself 'Am I an idiot? What is this society and
why did I participate in this? Why did I go along with these people?'"</P>
<P>Fair enough. But why do his films always seem to end up dealing with man
at his most grim, with death and destruction everywhere? He answered
fast, obviously having dealt with this question many times before. "Am I
fascinated with showing the dark side? I would say so. In American
culture, there is always a tendency to look on the positive side, which
is great, but I'm not sure that's the full truth. I think there are a
lot of things hidden under the surface in this country, in any country,
and sometimes it breaks to the surface. The shadow is there. We all have
to deal with the shadow in everybody. How strong and how dominant that
will be, probably that's a character thing or an environmental thing.
But I've always been interested in that aspect of humanity because you
see it displayed in the universe or on Earth in such a brutal way.
Especially in the century we just left – I think 70 million people got
killed, you know? More than anything you could ever imagine."</P>
<P>Verhoeven spent several minutes rambling on about the brutality of
nature, often referring to an article he had read about two galaxies
colliding with each other, and the indescribable destruction that must
result from such an occurrence. He seemed simultaneously horrified and
thrilled while describing the cataclysm. Eventually, his fever pitch
softened and he dropped from the nether reaches of space to his own
childhood. There was no hint of self-pity as he spoke. He simply got a
little quieter.</P>
<P>"I grew up in occupied Holland," he said, "and I saw… there were a lot
of people got killed by bombing, or resisters that were shot on the
streets by Germans. I was about seven when the war stopped. When I was
five, six, seven, we lived in the Hague and were constantly bombed
there, not by the Germans, but by the English. Our house was about a
mile from the rocket launching pads, where they launched the B-1's and
B-2's to England, and the English and Americans were constantly bombing
that area. The area around us, with the exception of the street we lived
on and a couple of others, were completely destroyed. I remember the
flames and the people being killed. And the Germans – one evening I
remember walking with my father and suddenly we were held by Germans and
they said 'You cannot walk there, you have to walk here and look at
something.' And we walked there and saw 20 people they had taken out of
prison and shot. They put them against the wall and shot them and made
sure that everyone going home passed them. Dead bodies there, yeah, I
remember all that. So you may be more optimistic than I am."</P>
<P>Ladies and gentlemen, meet Paul Verhoeven.</P>
