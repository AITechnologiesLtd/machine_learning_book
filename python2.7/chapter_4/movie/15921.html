<P>There is a scene in Patch Adams in which Patch is in the center of a
courtroom, surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing
ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors.
When I noticed that the audience with whom I saw this film was
reacting the same way, I realized that I was going to have a hard time
finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture.</P>
<P>You see, Patch Adams revolted me beyond all boundaries. I hated this
movie for every second that I sat watching it, and I actively hate it
now, days later, with the simpering, superficial, nauseatingly
sentimental images forever plaguing my memories. I hate every element
of the film, beginning with Tom Shadyac's shameless direction, and all
the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay
wants so desperately to convey. The badness of Patch Adams is
stupefying. It's confounding. I can't believe a film can be this bad.</P>
<P>And yet, it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to
make.  In the film, Patch is played by the undefeatable and
indefatigable Robin Williams, in a performance of such insulting pathos
and sledgehammer sympathy that I wonder now if he is even human.  In the
beginning of the film, Patch commits himself to a mental institution
because he doesn't want to kill himself.  While there, he notices that
the doctors don't care about the patients, and that the best way to get
through to the patients is to treat them like human beings.</P>
<P>So, Patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to
his patients.  He goes to medical school, where he meets Truman (Daniel
London) and convinces him that it's good to help people.  He also meets
Carin Fischer (Monica Potters), the anti-male med student who just wants
to go through the motions and be a successful doctor.  Naturally, the
dean of the medical school (Bob Gunton) hates Patch, and wants to thwart
his plans, even though Patch gets the highest scores on all of his
exams.  So Patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the
middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have.</P>
<P>And that, my friends, is the synopsis for what is easily the most
abhorrent picture of 1998.  On a superficial level, the film is not
particularly bad:  I wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me, and
most of the performances seem to be exactly what Shadyac was aiming for
(I actually liked Potter's performance, even if she is wasted).  But the
film fails fundamentally in execution.  Every scene swells with grand,
"emotional" music, played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry
real hard.  Take, for instance, the first scene, which shows Patch
sitting on a bus.  We don't know Patch yet, but there's sad music, and
it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad.  Later on, Patch
makes a lot of progress:  he helps a dying patient (Peter Coyote) to
enjoy the last days of his life, and the music as Patch is pushing the
patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively. 
And when that patient finally dies (spoiler alert!), the music is very
very sad.</P>
<P>But the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the
center of the emotions.  Real drama is character-based.  You grow to
like someone, and then something bad happens, and you feel it.  We don't
ever grow to know the dying patient; he's simply a vehicle for Patch's
greatness.  Real drama doesn't seem forced, or present just to make the
audience cry.  That's why Patch Adams is not real drama.  It goes for
every cheap tear imaginable, wringing tired and overbearing
sentimentality out of every scene.  Even scenes that have very little
impact on the overall film are drowning in Marc Shaiman's sickening
musical score.</P>
<P>Sentimentality like this is indeed bad.  But it's not as bad as
half-baked, simplistic themes.  You see, Patch is a really great
student.  He aces his tests without studying, and does it so effectively
that people think he's cheating.  But Patch doesn't think that
memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor.  "Why don't we see
patients until the third year?" he bursts out every three seconds. 
Well, Patch, that might have something to do with the fact that you need
to LEARN SOMETHING before you go treating patients.  Not everyone has
the capability of memorizing facts with no effort.  Most of us have to
study.  And a doctor who really wants to help, but doesn't know a toe
from a finger, probably won't be too successful in preventing death.</P>
<P>Oh wait, I almost forgot:  the point of doctors is not just to "prevent
death," but to "improve the quality of life!"  Yes!  That is true!  And
you can not do that without studying.  You can not do that without going
to medical school.  What Patch never seemed to understand was the
possibility that maybe, just maybe, it is a good idea to study first and
talk to patients later.  Follow the rules?  Bah!  Who needs the rules! 
Only uptight doctors follow the rules.  The real saviors are the ones
running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and
sporting baggy yellow pants.  </P>
<P>And then there's the free clinic issue, which I find shockingly,
frighteningly idealistic.  A free clinic.  In the middle of the forest. 
Where patients can be taken to be helped.  For free.  How will patients
be transported to the free clinic?  Will it have an emergency room?  Or
is it just for mental patients?  And who, may I ask, will pay for it? 
The film does give some token attempts to question Patch's motives (I
think another character asks him how he's going to pay for it, in
addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about HMOs and medical
insurance), but they certainly don't explore or challenge Patch's ideas
to any meaningful extent.</P>
<P>Reader, please understand this:  I am not making any kind of judgment
on the real Patch Adams.  I know nothing about him.  If his beliefs
mirror those of this film character, then I might like to have an
intelligent discussion with him about them.  But regardless of what the
real Patch Adams believes, the themes put forth in this film are
simplistic and phony.  And in the last scene, the big, obligatory
courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus, Patch does
a lot of shouting.  Actually, Robin Williams does a lot of shouting.  He
shouts a lot about helping people, and a lot of people cry because they
are moved by his words.  I won't tell you that you can't be moved by his
words, because I, too, was moved by his words.  I was moved in such a
profoundly negative way that I was reminded of how cheap and phony a
cinematic experience can be.  Patch Adams is the cheapest of them all.</P>
