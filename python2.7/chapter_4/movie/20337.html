Reviewed September 1, 1999.</PRE>
<P>`Been there, done that.' Despite the, albeit malnutritious, entertainment 
value of the new action-comedy, `Chill Factor,' directed by Hugh Johnson, 
making his feature-film debut, those four words constantly were ringing into 
my ears. Cliched, far-fetched, and basically `Speed 3' with a twist, the 
kicker this time isn't a bus or cruise ship that can't slow down below a 
certain speed, but a deadly biological weapon that must stay below fifty 
degrees, or else it will mean the end of the whole state of Montana. Where 
the original 1994 `Speed' rose above its overbaked genre, thanks to non-stop, 
expertly-shot action scenes that kept audiences on the edge of their seats 
throughout, `Chill Factor' unfortunately only includes a twenty-minute 
set-piece right in the middle of the film that even remotely equals up to its 
birth mother, and then it stops in its tracks for the remainder of the 
102-minute running time. Luckily, it doesn't overstay its welcome, and 
remains a solidly diverting, if generic, way to spend a few hours.</P>
<P>Jumping right off with a frighteningly realistic prologue in which the 
malicious Major
Andrew Brynner (Peter Firth) is the cause of the destruction of a whole 
military island, and deservedly is shipped off to prison, the picture 
fast-forwards ten years, when Brynner is released and immediately sets a plot 
into motion that includes selling the lethal chemical for $100 million to 
some international baddies. Stalking the scientist/creator (David Paymer) at 
his lab and shooting him, they discover that he has escaped with the 
chemical, nicknamed `Elvis.' To make a long story short, `Elvis' falls into 
the hands of Tim (Skeet Ulrich), a short-order cook, and Arlo (Cuba Gooding 
Jr.), an ice cream delivery man, who are instructed to transport it to Fort 
McGruder before Brynner and his nasty henchmen can catch up to them. And, oh 
yeah, Tim and Arlo have no choice but to keep "Elvis" below the magic 
temperature of 50 degrees, or KABLOOM!</P>
<P>`Chill Factor' is the exact type of film that, like clockwork, is always 
released on the first weekend of September each year. Last year, we were 
blessed with the godawful
Jean-Claude Van Damme no-brainer, `Knock Off,' and in September of 1997 was 
the
mediocre, if better-than-expected, Steven Seagal film, `Fire Down Below.' At 
least
sparing us with the overall badness of `Knock Off,' `Chill Factor' is still 
nothing more
than an unoriginal, professionally-done action movie. No attempt is made to 
raise above this sub-par level, and that is part of its slight charm. It's 
doubtful director Johnson or screenwriters Drew Gitlin and Mike Cheda 
expected greatness to come from this film and, therefore, it gains a sort of 
innocent quality whose only purpose is to entertain the viewer for the 
remainder of its running time. Sure, more suspense could have been injected 
into the pacing in order for it to really take off, but you can't expect 
everything when you're dealing with such an obvious studio effort.</P>
<P>The question remains, though. Why has Cuba Gooding Jr. fallen on such 
blatantly
desperate hard times? A Best Supporting Actor Academy Award Winner for 1996's
`Jerry Maguire,' Gooding Jr. has followed this career high point up with last 
year's
thought-provoking `What Dreams May Come,' which stuck him in a minor role, 
and this past summer's cinematic snooze-fest, `Instinct.' Now, with `Chill 
Factor,' he has
resorted to playing the type of stock jokester black man role that is often 
seen with rising stars (Eddie Murphy in 1984's `Beverly Hills Cop,' Chris 
Tucker in 1998's `Rush Hour'), rather than someone who long-since established 
his talent and wide-range with 1991's gritty, touching, `Boyz N the Hood.' 
Gooding Jr. too often appears on autopilot here, and you can't help but feel 
bad for him, since he clearly is capable of doing far more challenging work. 
Together, with Skeet Ulrich, they make a reasonably likable heroic duo, and 
are fun to watch most of the time. Ulrich alone, however, is as bland as 
could be, nowhere near as effective as he was in 1996's `Scream,' and only 
sells a single one-liner for maximum laughs: When Brynner comes into 
Darlene's Diner, Tim's place of employment, he asks him if he owns the 
restaurant. `Yeah,' replies Tim, `everyone calls me Darlene.'</P>
<P>`Chill Factor' sets up its basic premise in the first half-hour, which is the 
most
well-written section of the film, then turns into an adrenaline-pumping 
actioner for the
middle thirty minutes, and then drags itself out in the final one-third 
simply to qualify as a full-length feature. From beginning to end, we watch 
the characters, story, and screenplay go strictly through the conventions of 
an ordinary action film, hoping for the moment when a twist or abrupt spark 
of intelligence will occur. They ultimately never come, but those fans of 
mindless action movies won't be disappointed. After all, you could do a lot 
worse in the early-September movie season. You could also do a lot better.</P>
