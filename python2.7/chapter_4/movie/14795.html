<P>There's a certain category of romantic comedies that critics and
commentators like to call "feel-good" movies. (Some might say that
feel-good movies are the only romantic comedies which ever achieve any
measure of success; the rest are typically passed on by audiences and
deep-sixed by critics.) These spirited flicks have a moderate amount of
emotion involved - more than your average film but not as much as a
tearjerker; the cast of characters is usually a fun-filled bunch that's
very sympathetic to the audience; and the plot is a formulaic rag that
has us cheering for the characters by movie's end. And although it's
certainly nowhere near the caliber of last year's Academy Award
feel-gooders (e.g. AS GOOD AS IT GETS and GOOD WILL HUNTING), HOLY MAN
might rightly be termed the first feel-good movie of '98. </P>
<P>The casting is not spectacular, and really, Jeff Goldblum is the only
one at least semi-suited to the job. He - like David Duchovny - does the
straight-faced humor with talent and in HOLY MAN he works the crowd
well. Unfortunately, he never manages to land a solid baseline for the
role and it comes off feeling unfulfilling. That's unfortunate, because
his role is central to the success of the entire movie and without
gravity, both Kelly Preston and Eddie Murphy have a tough time deciding
where to go. It's not entirely Goldblum's fault, because the Tom
Schulman (DEAD POETS SOCIETY) script isn't particularly well-written.
Preston and Goldblum also can't develop any romantic chemistry, and that
side of the movie doesn't really shine either. If not for Goldblum's
ability to adapt well and Murphy's mirthful countenance, the acting
corps would be in the red for this movie. </P>
<P>With what they've got, however, they managed to pull off a darn cute
movie. Goldblum plays shopping network exec Ricky Hayman, a man who's
under constant pressure from the boss to boost sales. He's teamed up
with attractive co-worker Kate Newell (Preston), who, although initially
cold to Ricky's not-so-suave advances, eventually comes to like the
fellow. The two discover latter-day prophet "G," a grinning,
good-natured dude played with skill by Eddie Murphy. G does many things
well, including making people feel good about buying things off of a
shopping network. Ricky and Kate exploit this until Kate gets second
thoughts; she backs out and eventually leaves Ricky because he's too
power-minded. It's up to Ricky, then, to do the right thing and try to
get the girl back. (And, since it's a romantic comedy, the ending is
never really in doubt.) </P>
<P>The humor content is not outrageously hilarious, as it was in the action
comedy RUSH HOUR. Most of the one-liners are average, and there's no
extended comedic setups to speak of. But Schulman and Director Stephen
Herek (MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS) manage to overcome the quality problem with
quantity. The jokes are at least semi-funny, and the whole lot promotes
a sort of tongue-in-cheek atmosphere that makes the movie more
watchable. None of the specific elements really work in HOLY MAN on an
individual basis, but as a whole they come together nicely and make this
movie worth the price of the ticket. The only people who'll have
problems with it are those that expect an outright laugh-fest and don't
watch the movie for its more humanitarian qualities. Indeed, watching
this movie should end up being a very enjoyable experience for all who
attend.</P>
