SNATCH
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Blood and guns.  SNATCH is the second feature film by writer and 
director Guy Ritchie, who blasted onto the film scene a couple of years 
ago with his audacious LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS.  His latest 
movie is a hyper-violent, screwball comedy that doesn't pull any 
punches.  And it's fun for a time until the repetition factor sets in.  
Coming from the more-is-always-better school of filmmaking, Ritchie 
tries to fill every fast-paced scene with maximum violence and mayhem.</P>
<P>SNATCH, which has more characters and overlapping stories that you can 
count, never has a slow moment.  Most of the main stories revolve around 
an 86-caret diamond stolen by Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) 
from Antwerp diamond dealers.  After stealing it, he keeps the diamond 
in a briefcase, which is always attached by a chain to his arm.  In the 
predictable script, you can probably guess exactly how he will be 
relieved of the stone.  </P>
<P>The other major story involves an illegal, no-holds-barred boxing 
matching featuring an unintelligible gypsy named One Punch Mickey (Brad 
Pitt).  One of many links between the two stories is an indestructible 
Russian gun dealer named Boris The Blade (Rade Serbedzija).  Many of the 
characters, like Boris, can take more bullets than the agents in THE 
MATRIX and still keep on coming.  The make-up department for SNATCH must 
have had to buy fake blood by the barrels.</P>
<P>Individual incidents are cute although few rise to the level of 
laugh-out-loud funny.  Typical is the gag involving a trio of two-bit 
crooks, played by Robbie Gee, Lennie James and Ade.  They have a pesky 
dog who swallows a toy, which causes him forever after to squeak rather 
than bark.</P>
<P>Rising to the top of the list of the characters who quickly get tiresome 
is Brick Top (Alan Ford), a nefarious boxing promoter who has man-eating 
pigs.  Animal rights people may find many of the fighting animal scenes 
more than they can stomach even if the movie undoubtedly promises that 
no animals were harmed, etc.</P>
<P>As the ending credits roll, the song it plays has the constant refrain, 
"Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha."  The movie is like that -- way too 
repetitive.</P>
<P>SNATCH runs 1:43.  It is rated R for strong violence, language and some 
nudity and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older.</P>
