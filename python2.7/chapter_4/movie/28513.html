<P>You can't blame writer/director/producer/star Edward Burns for not looking
back at his last feature film, the commercial and critical flop No Looking
Back.  After becoming the darling of American independent cinema with 1995's
The Brothers McMullen and following it up with the underappreciated She's
the One the following year, Burns grounded out in 1998 with Back, a gloomy,
critically maligned film about a love triangle that didn't even begin to
recoup its $5 million budget at the box office (it grossed under $200k).
Since then, the quadruple threat has landed significant acting roles in two
major motion pictures - Saving Private Ryan and 15 Minutes - but with
Sidewalks of New York, Burns should feel like he's kickin' it all the way
back to the mid '90s.</P>
<P>Sidewalks is set in - big surprise - New York City and focuses on the lives
of six characters who stagger through their lives searching for love (mostly
in all the wrong places, too).  The film begins with faux man-on-the-street
interviews with each of the six describing their first sexual experiences
before launching into the story proper.  Burns does two things that make the
film interesting:  He uses a handheld camera to shoot most of Sidewalks, and
he has each character hail from a different borough of the city (only one is
an outsider).  Hey - let's meet them right now, shall we?</P>
<P>- Tommy (Burns) is a reporter for an Entertainment Tonight-type show (a bit
of an inside joke, as Burns worked for ET until he slipped Robert Redford a
tape of McMullen) and has just been kicked out of his Queens apartment by
his girlfriend.  Tommy temporarily stays with his boss (Dennis Farina,
Snatch), who is quick to provide over-the-top advice about how to score with
chicks.  Then, one day, Tommy meets...</P>
<P>- Maria (Rosario Dawson, Josie and the Pussycats), a native of Staten Island
who teaches the 6th grade in a ritzy area of Manhattan where her salary is
dwarfed by the allowances of her students.  Maria is recently divorced and,
though she's attracted to Tommy, is leery of getting involved because she
just can't seem to get rid of...</P>
<P>- Benjamin (David Krumholtz, The Mexican) a struggling musician from
Brooklyn who pays the bills by working as a doorman.  He's still in love
with the beautiful Maria and doesn't see anything wrong with dropping by her
apartment in the middle of the night.  Benjamin thinks he still has a shot
with his ex, but, in the meantime, becomes infatuated with...</P>
<P>- Ashley (Brittany Murphy, Girl Interrupted), a guitar-playing NYU student
from Iowa (and the only character who hasn't lived in the Big Apple their
entire life).  She's having an affair with an older, married man who swears
he's going to leave his wife to be with her.  Should she try to find
somebody her own age to frolic with, or simply be content with...</P>
<P>- Griffin (Stanley Tucci, Joe Gould's Secret), a once-divorced Bronx dentist
who has remarried a sweet, young honey yet insists on stepping out with
Ashley on a regular basis despite his fear of the stigma that twice-divorced
men can carry.  Griffin is the only unlikable character in the film, which
makes you wonder how he landed...</P>
<P>- Annie (Heather Graham, Say It Isn't So), a WASP-y real estate agent from
the Upper East Side of Manhattan who foolishly believes she has the perfect
marriage.  The story comes full circle when Annie shows an apartment to the
recently homeless Tommy.</P>
<P>If any of this sounds familiar, it must be because you've seen Woody Allen's
Husbands and Wives, which had a similar (yet much more downbeat) story about
doomed relationships, faux interviews with the main characters, shaky,
handheld camera work, and a comparable setting.  I'm usually against the
idea of lifting ideas from other films, but if you're going to do it, why
not swipe 'em from something as wonderful as Wives?  Copying Rocky to make
Driven...now that I've got a problem with.</P>
<P>Sidewalks is much dirtier than Wives, with gags about dick size and various
private-part odors.  It also helps to perpetuate several myths that
outsiders to New York City have come to accept as reality - Jews are really
cheap and black people don't exist.  But Burns fleshes out his characters
with enough quirky sexual hang-ups and various fears (like loneliness and
disease) to keep things more than interesting.  Nothing really exciting or
surprising happens, but it doesn't need to.  And that's the sign of a good
film.</P>
<P>1:43 - R for sexual content and language</P>
