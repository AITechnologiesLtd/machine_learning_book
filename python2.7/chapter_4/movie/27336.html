<P>   Given the extent to which the television industry--
particularly its enhancements by cable and video recording
equipment--has cut into potential theater box office receipts,
it's only natural that the studios would strike back by
parodying the shows that have distracted us from the big
screen.  Game shows have been a popular genre for satire,
and no film has done a better job of mocking their corruption
than Robert Redford's 1994 "Quiz Show," which focused on
the scandals of the 1950s programs particularly the then
fascinating $64,000 question--in which answers were given to
the contestants beforehand.  Daniel Minahan's derisive view
of both game shows and, in a larger sense, the growing
violence within American society, is by contrast adolescent,
literal-minded and virtually humorless, spotlighting a mostly
unattractive cast of people who are so unsympathetic and
banal that we in the theater audience have a difficult time
caring about them a whit.  The entire production seems to
have been conceived, directed and performed by a group of
college kids knocking out a project that they believe could get
them into NYU film school rather than invented by the fellow
who co-wrote the far more engrossing "I Shot Andy Warhol."  </P>
<P>   Spoofing the current trend toward reality programs as well
as game shows, "Series 7" is a 24/7 TV marathon in which
six contestants are chosen by random from a smiling lottery-
type woman gazing closely watching the spinning balls.  The
aim of each contestant is to outsmart the other six not in the
ability to guess the identify of the country's ninth vice
president by the competence in killing the others before they
can nullify him or her.  The last gladiator standing is the
winner, who gets to compete in the next marathon.  The
prize, other than permission to live and continue firing rifles
and pistols, is not reported.</P>
<P>  The current champion, the very pregnant Dawn (Brooke
Smith), is pitted against a religious nurse, Connie (Marylouise
Burke); Tony (Michael Kaycheck), an overweight man with
family difficulties; Lindsay (Merritt Wever), an eighteen-year-
old who is encouraged throughout her mission by her parents
(one of which is played by New York's own Donna Hanover);
Jeff (Glenn Fitzgerald), Jeff (Glenn Fitzgerald), a young man
dying of testicular cancer; and Franklin (Richard Venture), a
chap who gets little development, who uses a metal cane to
kill rather than a gun.  The gimmick in this story is that
neither Dawn nor the now-married and dying Jeff can bear to
pull the trigger on each other since they were lovers back in
high school in the small Connecticut town in which the action
takes place.</P>
<P>   As killing follows legalized murder, I couldn't help thinking
not so much of the reality exhibitions or quiz shows that are
being set up for parody but of Jules Feiffer's far more
sophisticated and witty play which was adapted for the screen
thirty years ago by Alan Arkin, "Little Murders."  That black
comedy about life in nightmarish New York City evokes a
frightful ambiance which has citizens gunning down their
fellows at random for no particular reason--an intense,
devilishly amusing foreshadowing of the chaos enveloping
parts of the world as gangs become the invisible government
of prosperous urban areas.  Notwithstanding the modest
budget of "Series 7," the film could have been saved by a
greater lyricism in the writing, but though the scripting is said
to be tight, the action appears improvised with Mr. Minahan
seeming all too often to settle for a first cut of each scene.</P>
