<PRE>                                 QUICK CHANGE
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  The clever heist story fades into a
     Murphy's Law sort of getaway.  Three thieves find out just
     how unfriendly New York City can be.  There are several
     well-defined characters created, but unfortunately the three
     main characters are not them.  Rating: +1.</P>
<P>     There are really two stories to QUICK CHANGE.  The first story is about
twenty minutes long and is the story of "The Bank Robbery."  The second
story is the story of "The Getaway."  The idea behind the robbery is clever.
It is done in a way that has not been done in heist films before it.  I
figured the gimmick out in advance, but I am told that puts me in a
minority.  Word-of-mouth indicates that many viewers are taken by surprise
by the gimmick of the robbery.  The Getaway is also well done but in a very
different vein.  All the clockwork planning falls apart as three partners in
crime try to get from a New York bank to JFK airport.  Here no new ground is
broken.  Several films have been made about what a hostile and frustrating
place New York City is.  Notable examples are THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS and AFTER
HOURS.  QUICK CHANGE is slightly lower key and more believable than those
films, but it too is a compendium of the irritating frustrations and rude
people in New York City, woven together by a connecting story.  The attempts
to get to the airport become more frantic as more and more obstacles fall
into the intrepid gang's way.</P>
<P>     Bill Murray co-produced, co-directed, and co-starred.  Howard Franklin
co-directed as well as wrote the screenplay based on a book by Jay Cronley.
Murray plays the absurdly laid-back Grimm.  Murray sacrifices much of the
absurd gamut of frustrations by maintaining an even keel throughout.  As a
counterpoint, Randy Quaid plays Loomis, who constantly walks the narrow line
between panic and hysteria.  Of the three thieves, the only character who
has any depth is Geena Davis's Phyllis, who is re-evaluating her future
while they fights their way to the airport, pursued by the slightly too
intuitive Chief Rotzinger (played by Jason Robards, Jr.).</P>
<P>     QUICK CHANGE does have a few belly laughs, but it is not trying
constantly to be uproarious as so many current comedies are.  More often it
contents itself with being whimsical and sly.  This approach would normally
require a much better definition of the three main characters than  Franklin
was able to provide, but ironically it is not the main characters he
develops.  Instead he develops the minor characters and then lets them
upstage the stars, We better understand a bank guard (played by Bob Elliot
of the Bob and Ray team) than we do either if the two male leads.  The
audience has less sympathy and interest invested in them than in a cabbie
who speaks and understands no recognizable language.  An officious bus
driver (played by Philip Bosco) is as well developed as Randy Quaid's
character with far less screen time.  By blurring the foreground characters
and focusing on the background, New York City becomes the real main
character of the film until the script falters near the end and Murray once
again reclaims the audience's attention.  I rate the film a +1 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
