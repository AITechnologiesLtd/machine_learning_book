<PRE>                            EDWARD SCISSORHANDS
                       A film review by Laurie Mann
                        Copyright 1990 Laurie Mann</PRE>
<P>     Yep, I'm catching up on my movie-going.  I have to, with both
HAMLET and AWAKENINGS opening up on the same weekend here next month!</P>
<P>     Anyway, Leslie and I went to see EDWARD SCISSORHANDS today, the
modern fable about the manufactured boy with scissors for hands.  It was
a fine movie, made with intelligence and wit.  Tim Burton scores another
winner.  It won't make nearly the money that BATMAN did, but at least
BATMAN gave him the clout to continue making off-beat films like Edward.</P>
<P>     Like all the other Burton movies, the film dances between the real
world and someplace else entirely.  The "real world" here has the look
and feel of California in the mid-60s.  Peg, the friendly Avon lady,
played by Diane Wiest with just the right amount of Girl Scout, finds
Edward, abandoned, in a creepy old castle surrounded by wonderful
topiary.  She takes Edward home, and, in the tradition of Chance, the
gardener from BEING THERE, he agrees.  Edward is played by Johnny Depp,
and he gives a marvelous performance, balancing his need for love
against the fact he's been left alone for much of his life.  Like most
movies of this type, the "alien" has the biggest heart, and displays the
most humanity.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast is kind of a "Greek Chorus" to the proceedings,
and act in concert throughout the movie.  Most of the supporting cast,
led ably by Kathy Baker and Conchetta Ferrell, are bored 1960s housewives
who spend their time entrenched in one another's lives.  Other members
of the cast include Alan Arkin as Bill, the archetypal 1960s Dad, and
Anthony Michael Hall (remember when he was the skinny dweeb back in 16
CANDLES?) as Kim's menacing boyfriend.</P>
<P>     Kim is played by Winona Ryder, Peg & Bill's all-American daughter.
She is horrified by Edward at first, but eventually becomes his friend.
Ryder is literally transformed in this movie, from being a vacuous
teenager early in the movie to taking enormous risks for Edward by the
end of the film.</P>
<P>     When you go see this movie, remember that it is a fairy tale, like
"Beauty and the Beast."  Tim Burton makes his points about humanity and
isolation without beating you over the head with them.  This is one of
the best movies I've seen this year.</P>
<P>     Kid rating---Leslie hid at some of the parts where she felt Edward
was going to be embarrassed (you can see most of these moments coming).
The language was a little strong at times, and there were some fights
but no gore.  The movie may be a little slow for kids who need action to
keep them interested in a film.</P>
