<PRE>Tea With Mussolini **1/2</PRE>
<P>rated PG
MGM/G2 Films
starring Cher, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith, Lily Tomlin, Baird
Wallace, Charlie Lucas
based on the autobiography of Franco Zeffirelli
screenplay by John Mortimer and Franco Zeffirelli
directed by Franco Zeffirelli</P>
<P>In the past year or two, there has been no shortage of World War II
based films. Viewers have now seen the war from many unique
perspectives, and can form their own account of what happened. This
time around, acclaimed director Franco Zeffirelli, who is best known
for his 1968 black-and-white version of "Romeo And Juliet", shares
with us his true story of being raised in Italy during World War II.</P>
<P>In the film, Zeffirelli goes by the alias Luca (Charlie Lucas as a
child, Baird Wallace as a teen).  Luca's Italian father has remarried
to a woman who for some reason despises the child, and Luca is sent
off to live with his English caretaker, Mary (Joan Plowright). Mary is
part of the Scorpioni, a group of mostly arrogant, wealthy, conceited
English women who happen to be living in Florence for the time
being. Hester (Maggie Smith), the leader of the clan, has recently had
tea with Mussolini, the leader of Italy, and he has assured her that
the women will be kept safe in case of any war.</P>
<P>When Elsa (Cher), an elegant, audacious American Jewish woman arrives
into the city, the threat of war seems to come with her. But the women
keep their poise and the oncoming war seems to do nothing to stop
their rich lifestyle. Luca is then sent to Austria by his father so
that he can learn the Nazi ways, and the Englishwomen are told that
they are no longer welcome in Italy. The orders work to no avail.</P>
<P>"Tea With Mussolini" starts off nicely, but the pace soon slows and
the film becomes less interesting as it succumbs to World War II
cliches instead of telling Luca's own story. The livelier moments are
dragged down by the dry patches.</P>
<P>The film does feature a first-rate cast, including Cher (in her first
film role since 1996's "Faithful"), Academy Award Winner Judi Dench,
and Lily Tomlin. All the actresses bring life to their characters, and
despite a clunker of a script, "Tea With Mussolini" at least has its
heart in the right place.</P>
