<PRE>HUMAN TRAFFIC
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to
master.  Any meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the
dumbing-down of the experience to make it "more accessible" to the
general public.  Or the film is produced and directed by people that
have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to
work as production assistants for VH1.  Human Traffic, a new film
exploring the British underground party/rave scene and the people
immersed in the world of clubbing, pubbing, drugs, sex, and the
beautiful, beautiful music, is an example of how it really ought to be
done.</P>
<P>The film follows five Brits in their young twenties during a wild
weekend of parties, drugs, dancing, sex, pop culture discussions,
relationships, and wanking off in front of a mirror while mum
interrupts.  The cast of character consists of Jip (John Simm), our
narrator, who has a bit of a problem with his willy, known as Mr.
Floppy.  Koop (Shaun Parkes), our black DJ maestro, who has insecurity
issues, afraid his girlfriend Nina (Nicola Reynolds) is shagging other
men.  Nina herself can't stand her McJob and longs for the freedom of
the weekends.  Lulu (Lorraine Pilkington), Jip's best mate, is tired of
her cheating boyfriends.  And Moff (Danny Dyer) can't seem to escape the
black hole of his awful life.  The film follows these five individuals
during one weekend as each of them discovers love, friendship, and
self-fulfillment, all against the raging party background.</P>
<P>Human Traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while
being visually alive, as director Justin Kerrigan's subtle use of the
camera lets the audience become part of the action.  The use of direct
communication to the audience by the collection of characters works
well, making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters.
Dialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace, and the acting is
confident.  However, the two females leads tend to promote their
relationships and dialogue with a bit of unneeded urgency that shows
through when poignancy is needed.</P>
<P>Human Traffic does not try to explain the rave scene.  Instead, it gives
the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it, letting you
choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that
brings together strangers, friends, and lovers for one blissful night of
music and peace.</P>
