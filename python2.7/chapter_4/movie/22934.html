<P>eXistenZ (**** out of ****)
Starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Ian Holm
Directed By David Cronenberg
Mirimax/Dimension Films, Rated R, 1999
Running Time: 1 Hour 38 Minutes</P>
<P>Part One of "The Strangest Movies Ever Made" Series at www.mediajunkies.com</P>
<PRE>by Scott Watson</PRE>
<P>[LIGHT SPOILERS, nothing you shouldn't read]</P>
<P>eXistenZ has been called "a gooey Matrix", and while this is a correct
description in some ways, in others it is completely off. The only
thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality
that is indistinguishable from normal, "real" reality. A major
difference is that "The Matrix" has a base reality that is obviously
the true reality, while eXistenZ does the impossible and makes us
accept the most bizarre reality ever as true. And oh what a reality it
is. David Cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create
strange movies (Naked Lunch, Crash), but this one is one of the
strangest. Maybe it's because of how the mundane is mixed with the
bizarre. Technology is organic, but only some of it. Cars are
normal. Gas stations are the same. Cell phones are glowing bug like
appendages. You jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering
pink gooey animal like apparatus (referred to simply as a "pod").
High technology has been replaced with organic creatures, and it
provides a truly surreal setting for the characters.</P>
<P>A famous game designer, Allegra Geller (a fine looking Jennifer Jason
Leigh), flees a demonstration of her latest game, eXistenZ, after an
assassination attempt. She is on the run (from who, I'm still not
sure), and has to save her pod by playing her game with "someone
friendly". That someone friendly is her dubious companion and security
guard, Ted Pikul (Jude Law). Unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental
requirement for playing, a bioport. Sort of a hole in your spine (ok,
exactly like a hole in your spine), a bioport allows you to plug the
vaguely entrail-looking wires from the pod into you, allowing you to
play the game. Luckily a bioport can be installed easily (they install
them in malls), so off they go to get one. After a crazy series of
events at the local country gas station, they are able to plug in and
play eXistenZ.</P>
<P>The plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies, reality
distortion, Chinese restaurants, and multi appendaged amphibian things
("It's a sign of the times"). But the plot, while cohesive in it's own
creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is
going on in this universe.  Cronenberg just slaps this weird
organic-tech world into the viewers lap, and it's up to you to figure
out how all these things work. And that's the true joy of this film,
entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which eXistenZ takes place.
You learn a little bit piece by piece (oh, they make pods out of
those), and it's just enough to get you to accept the world that is
presented to you.</P>
<P>There are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander
around, including a fantastic scene in a Chinese restaurant that will
leave you trying to assemble something out of your Moo Goo Gai Pan for
months afterwards.  Also the bioports are occasionally used for things
other than porting into eXistenZ , the specifics of which I will leave
for you to discover. There's lots of little things that set off the
weird-o-meter, like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video
game store, the two headed amphibian creature, and why that guy at the
gas station's name appears to be "Gas". It all adds up to a supremely
far out trip, and given the choice I think I would rather live in The
Matrix's virtual world... oh wait, I already do.</P>
