<PRE>                                 LIE DOWN WITH DOGS
                        A film review by Christopher Null
                         Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     "When you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas."  This chorus is
the unifying theme of Wally White's new feature, LIE DOWN WITH DOGS, a
disappointing film about the letting go of guilt and, basically, the
embracing of promiscuity and shallowness.</P>
<P>     The film starts out as an odd "get inside my mind" piece about a gay
man named Tommie (played by White himself), who decides to head off for one
last summer of frolicking in Provincetown, Massachusetts ("the ultimate gay
resort").  Leaving the big city of New York behind, Tommie casts his worries
aside, whips out a few credit cards, and, badda-bing, it's party time.</P>
<P>     Tommie embarks on what starts out as a promising voyage of self-
discovery, but after about five minutes, the film sadly degenerates into an
over-the-top quest for nonstop, meaningless sex.  And Tommie is only one of
a large ensemble cast of totally unlikable characters, all of whom are
carbon copies of one another: shallow, stupid, and unbearable.  The
ostensible point of the film, ultimately, is that you should live your life
to the fullest and without any shame or guilt, but I have to believe that no
self-respecting person would take things to the extremes promoted here.</P>
<P>     The production values are, well, strange.  White breaks down the
"fourth wall" and spouts a number of droll monologues about how crummy his
life is, directly to the camera.  And when he's not talking, the director of
photography is generally experimenting with new camera tricks like a kid
with a new toy.  I can't begin to count how many times the "spinning camera
shot" was used, but after the first 15 times, you'll be too dizzy to care.
In the end, the only saving graces are a couple of good jokes and a few of
these camera tricks that are actually clever.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, there's no big payoff at the finale; Tommie has no
sudden realization that he's a nimrod.  The end result is 80 minutes of film
that seem like 160--with no socially redeeming value whatsoever.  White was
correct on one count, though: When you lie down with dogs like this movie,
you do get up with fleas.</P>
<PRE>RATING:  *1/2</PRE>
<PRE>*     Unquestionably awful
**    Sub-par on many levels
***   Average, hits and misses
****  Good, memorable film
***** Perfection</PRE>
