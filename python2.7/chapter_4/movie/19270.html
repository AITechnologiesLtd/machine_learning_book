<P>Although "film noir" more or less died off as a genre in the 1950s, it
continues to reverberate in such conscious homages as Roman Polanski's
"Chinatown" and the work of the Coen brothers ("Fargo," "Blood
Simple," etc.) We can now add to this body of work Sam Raimi's 1998 "A
Simple Plan."</P>
<P>In the classic noir film we encounter desperate men and women who turn
to crime because society allows them no other outlets. Since radical
politics never appears as an option, the only way to escape class
oppression might be to rob a bank as depicted, for example, in "Odds
Against Tomorrow". The themes of such films are actually traceable to
the great naturalist novels of the late 19th century, which also
depict an underclass struggling against a web of formidable economic
circumstances. </P>
<P>Film noirs would almost inevitably make their debut during the Great
Depression, when the inescapable reality of economic hardship would
inspire screenwriters such as Abraham Polonsky to depict the opposite
side of a Tom Joad. While Tom Joad, ever the idealist, declares his
intention to change America in the final moments of "Grapes of Wrath,"
a typical film noir character ends up in the clutches of the law only
regretting having been captured.</P>
<P>It was almost inevitable that the long, economic decline of the 1980s
and 90s would eventually spawn a neo-noir genre. Although I doubt if
Sam Raimi's "A Simple Plan" is the first such film, it certainly is
one of the most explicit. It tells the story of three men living in
the rural farmland of the northern United States who stumble across a
downed small airplane in the forest in the dead of winter. The plane
contains the pilot's corpse and a duffel bag containing over four
million dollars. On the spot they decide to keep the money to
themselves. They convince themselves that their "simple plan" can not
go wrong and as we expect from the classic noir films, everything does
go wrong.</P>
<P>Two of the men are brothers. Hank Mitchell (Bill Paxton) is an
accountant at a feed mill, while his brother Jacob (Billy Bob
Thornton) oscillates between low-paying odd jobs and welfare. Jacob's
best friend is Lou (Brent Briscoe), the town trunk, who resents the
college-educated Hank. You know that there is going to be tension
between the two when in the early scene when they discover the loot,
Lou accuses Hank of using high-falutin' words like "insinuate." Why
the fuck couldn't he use a simple word like "hint".</P>
<P>Although Hank has the trappings of a successful man, he too is barely
scraping by, like a clerk in one of Dickens' novels. His pregnant wife
Sarah (Bridget Fonda) is expecting her first child and when she learns
of their discovery not only encourages him to keep the money, but even
resort to further crimes in order to cover their trail. At one point
when he complains to her about the risks involved, she lashes out at
him. Is he going to be satisfied working at the feed mill his entire
life, waiting until his boss dies in order to get a raise? What about
their child? The other kids would laugh at her in school when she is
forced to wear hand-me-downs. And, finally, what about her? Sarah
knows that there is a better world out there and the only keeping her
from it is the lack of money.</P>
<P>Even though Hank is close to the bottom, his brother Jacob is even
lower. He lives in a cheap apartment and dresses shabbily. His
eyeglasses are kept together by adhesive tape. He is too poor to date
and spends most of his time alone or getting drunk with Lou. This is
not the bounteous farmland depicted in television commercials, but the
real one in which farms collapse and their owners are reduced to
poverty, just like Jacob. In a poignant scene at their abandoned
family farm, Jacob tells Hank that his dream is to buy back the farm
and start it back up. With millions available, he simply wants to
return to his roots. We discover that one of the reasons the farm
collapsed was that their father could no afford to keep it going while
Hank remained in college. Finally facing foreclosure, he drove his
truck into a tree and killed himself.</P>
<P>Their "simple plan" unravels almost from the beginning. Lou is at odds
with Hank and Jacob is torn between the two men. Raimi's direction is
superb as he captures the bleak and desperate mood of men trapped in a
situation which allows them to neither return to their original
innocence before discovering the money, nor a successful realization
of their criminal dreams.</P>
<P>Raimi is an odd figure. His best known film was "Darkman", a feverish
treatment on a comic book character who, after being disfigured in a
fire, seeks revenge against the criminals who were responsible. He is
also the producer of the highly successful tongue-in-cheek mythology
TV shows "Xena" and "Hercules". I was surprised to discover him
capable of such a nuanced film. Highly recommended.</P>
