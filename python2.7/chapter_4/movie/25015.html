<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A breezy, screwball comedy about police, with a slightly different
twist, it is about NYC's Bureau of Missing Persons. A scrawl flashed
across the screen notes that there were 27,000 missing people in NYC
last year. It is based on a book by a former police captain, John H.
Ayres. Bette Davis was just a year away from stardom in her breakthrough
film "Of Human Bondage," therefore she reluctantly settled for Warner
Bros. giving her second billing to Pat O'Brien.</P>
<P>Two-fisted Butch Saunders (Pat O'Brien) is unceremoniously transferred
out of the robbery division and into Missing Persons because of his
rough tactics and too many unnecessary arrests.</P>
<P>He meets with Captain Webb (Lewis Stone), who tells him in his
department it is not force that counts but brainwork. The captain is the
wiseman on the hill, conducting his department in a humane and
considerate fashion, as he shows a healthy tolerance for the human
condition and an ability to circumvent the bureaucratic way of doing
things in favor of common sense. A series of on-going cases are briefly
targeted, by showing the other detectives on the job. Joe (Jenkins) is
looking for a missing husband who has run away with another woman.
Detective Conlin (Adrian) tracks down a missing boy via a chase
involving an airplane and a carrier pigeon. Detective Slade (Hugh
Herbert) is comically in pursuit of a husband looking for his wife
Gwendolyn through the entire film and finally finds her right under his
nose. A 12-year-old concert violinist runs away from home and is
returned to his pushy parents who won't let him play with the other
children. A woman is mercifully not told by the captain that her missing
daughter is in jail, figuring that would break her heart even more.</P>
<P>Halfway through the film, Bette Davis pops into the Bureau to report her
husband as missing. Butch, who is separated from his wife, falls
immediately in love with Bette and tries to help her find her husband.
The tough-guy's heart goes out to her, but he is in shock when the
Chicago police accuse her of murder. Left with the choice of arresting
her or giving her a chance to explain what happened, he chooses the
later, and she plays him for a sucker and disappears.</P>
<P>Belle (Glenda Farrell) comes calling on her 'Butchie Wootchie' every
payday to get her allowance, as Butch tries to hide from her. Glenda
lightens up the crowded bureau offices with her shrieks of Butchie
Wootchie, as she chases after her unhappy husband.</P>
<P>O'Brien comes up with an ingenuous plan to find Bette: he takes a "dead
body" from the morgue, tells the newspapers that the body is Davis's,
and stages "her" funeral. He figures she can't resist attending her own
funeral. His plan works, but Bette when caught again tells him that she
is innocent and explains to the puzzled O'Brien, who is willing to do
almost anything for her, even take her word again.</P>
<P>Bette tells him she was a secretary to a guy named Therme Roberts
(Dinehart), who is a Chicago broker accused of embezzlement and he has a
twin brother who is daffy, that no one knows about. She says that was
not Therme who died, he ran away after killing his brother, knowing the
police would think that was him who was killed. When the police came in,
she just discovered the body and was holding the murder weapon. She
thought the best chance she had for clearing herself was to come to NYC
and get the Missing Persons to help her locate him... . Her chance to
prove herself correct comes when Therme is also spotted at the funeral.</P>
<P>So the story's not perfect! But this was a fun programmer, fast-paced
and a typical Warner Bros. potboiler of that time period.</P>
