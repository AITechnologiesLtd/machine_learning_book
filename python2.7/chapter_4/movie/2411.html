<PRE>                            DRUNKEN MASTER 2
                       A film review by Eric Tend
                        Copyright 1994 Eric Tend</PRE>
<P>     One of the most impressive and entertaining "realistic" martial
arts films to grace our shores in recent years is Jackie Chan's DRUNKEN
MASTER 2.  It marks his triumphant return to the roots that made him
famous: a period costume drama featuring ultra complex adrenaline
filled fight and stunt choreography (where the "Ooohh, aaahh, and
oowwchh" factor is *very high*!), likable characters, simple plot, and
trademark Chan humor sprinkled throughout.</P>
<P>     The story, which has no continuity nor relation to its 1978
predecessor DRUNKEN MASTER, follows the further exploits of the Wong
Fei-Hong family.  Chan plays a more vulnerable and modern Fei-Hong,
contrasting Jet Li's slightly older, wiser, and almost invincible
incarnation.  Ti Lung (doesn't this guy ever age?) and Anita Mui
(wildly over-the-top) play his parents.  This time out, Fei-Hong gets
caught up in another conspiracy involving foreigners stealing and
smuggling China's artistic treasures out of the country.</P>
<P>     While trying to avoid a train tax for some Ginsing purchased by
his father, Fei-Hong hides it among some foreign dignitary's luggage.
When he retrieves it, he has a run in with an apparent thief who is
stealing another item wrapped identically to Fei-Hong's Ginsing box.
While they both exit the boxcar to avoid capture, a fight insures
between them underneath a train station (showcasing tight-courters
spear vs. sword ... a long weapon is usually very ineffective if you
don't have a lot of room to use it, but not in this case).  After a
hasty resolution, Fei-Hong returns to the train with the wrong box ...
containing the stolen Emperor's Jade Seal Stamp.</P>
<P>     Most of the comedy relief revolves around a complex cover up for
the missing Ginsing and its aftermath when they return home with
classic comedic interaction between Fei-Hong and his parents which
eventually threatens the family honor and name.</P>
<P>     The foreigners set up shop at the British Conselate and take over
the local town steel mill as a front for their smuggling operations.
They also want to extend their power by expanding to town ownership.
As the film progresses, secondary characters as well as villains are
introduced as the catalyst to showcase Fei-Hong's amazing drunken fist
style of martial arts.  This style combines flexibility and acrobatics
with the appearance of looking drunk and off balance to throw an
opponent off and draw them in closer.</P>
<P>     During one confrontation, Fei-Hong learns that alcohol increases
his drunken style power by taking away feeling and he easily dispatches
five opponents at the same time.  He learns the hard way from his
father that if not used in moderation, it can cloud one's judgement and
control.</P>
<P>     The theft and smuggling conspiracy is brought into the open when
the thief from the train shows up to correct the box mixup.  The thief
turns out to be a high-ranking and decorated Manchu officer who is
trying prevent the lost of China'a treasures.  The foreigners enlist
aid of some corrupt Chinese counterparts to retrieve the Jade Seal and
kill the Manchu officer in the process.  As a result, Fei-Hong vows to
go after them and shut down their operation.</P>
<P>     Jackie shines in fine form and proves to the world once again that
he still has it.  DRUNKEN MASTER 2 easily outshines his last four film
efforts and combines the best qualities of all of his previous period
dramas (DRUNKEN MASTER, FEARLESS HYENA, YOUNG MASTER, etc.) with
elements from both PROJECT "A"s and POLICE STORY 2.  Since this is a
pure martial arts film, he pulls out all the stops and creates a roller
coaster ride jaw-dropping stunts and vintage trademark Jackie Chan
weapons and hand-to-hand sparing choreography that will leave the
average viewer numb and jaded.  In addition to his physical acrobatic
hand forms, Jackie also shows his skill in weapons including the
single-edge sword, fan, double sawhorse stools (at the same time!),
staff pole, and an improvised weapon that has to be seen to be
believed.  Jackie's opponents are always equally skilled and provide a
contrast to his unique drunken style.  The final confrontation in the
steel mill was a burning experience ... literally.</P>
<P>     This film is more modern than most Wong Fei-Hong's produced so
far.  No one in the film has a ponytail or shaved head hair-style.  The
Wong Fei-Hong character, who was traditionally a Hung Gar stylist is
showcased as using a completely different style ... but ... who
cares ... it was awfully entertaining !!!  What a welcome change from
the overabundance of flying-by-wires stuff proliferating traditional
martial arts films lately.</P>
