<PRE>                              THE RUNNING MAN
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1987) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Somewhere along the line, Arnold Schwarzenegger actually 
developed a passable acting technique, but THE RUNNING MAN 
comes before that time. His wooden performance is just one of the 
reasons this movie will never be more than a mediocre movie 
experience for people who don't have the sense of humor to 
appreciate just how dismal the 80's action formula was working 
by this point in Arnold's career. This movie, like the far superior 
TERMINATOR and TOTAL RECALL, provides a science-fiction 
backdrop for the mindless violence, in a more extreme, futuristic 
version of "American Gladiators."</P>
<P>        In the year 2019, we read at the beginning, America has 
become a police state where the only thing citizens care about is 
television. And the most popular game show is "The Running 
Man," where convict contestants are promised great prizes if 
they can escape the "stalkers," bohemoths like Subzero (the 
hockey killer), Buzzsaw (the chainsaw biker), Dynamo (the 
operatic electrocutioner) and Fireball (blaxploitation star Jim 
Brown with a flame thrower).</P>
<P>        Schwarzenegger is the only contestant to ever offer the 
stalkers a serious challenge, and he is of course an innocent man 
fighting for his freedom. The savage media has edited a newsreel 
video of Schwarzenegger in such a way that it frames him. It's up 
to Arnold to fight for his life against the stalkers so he can draw 
attention to the deceptions of the media (because, obviously, 
savage violence is the only way to bring about truth). We all know 
the Reverend Wildmon would be twice as successful in his crusade 
against TV violence if he'd put on a lyrca jumpsuit and kick some 
Gladiator butt.</P>
<P>        Adapted from a Richard Bachman (a.k.a. Stephen King) 
book, THE RUNNING MAN at least has a sense of humor about 
itself, making game show host Richard Dawson into a celebrity. 
As for the serious parts, well, they don't seem so serious anymore. 
Pretty much the entire movie is laughable at this point, and it's safe 
to say the best place to preach about people's lives being influenced 
by what they see on TV is not a violent Arnold Schwarzenegger 
movie.</P>
