<PRE>READY TO WEAR (1994)
PRET-A-PORTER (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>For the author of this review clothing is primarily the
invention that protects human body from the natural
elements. In some occasions clothes can be the source of
aesthetic pleasure, but such instances are too rare to
justify the phenomenon of modern fashion industry. Teen
models that promote anorexia, bulimia, self-mutilation and
heroin use; outfits that can be worn only by masochists,
exhibitionists and other sexual perverts; instant stardom
for people who create clothes that average person can't
afford; and billions of dollars that could be spent for
things like sheltering cyclone victims in Bangladesh - all
that can be seen as a symptom of decline of Western
civilisation and, in light of it, people might even have
some understanding for Bin Laden and his ilk. So when Robert
Altman made satirical attempt on fashion industry in 1994
film READY TO WEAR, the author of this review greeted that
effort with enthusiasm.</P>
<P>Like in most of the best known Altman's films, there isn't
anything resembling clear plot. Just like in NASHVILLE or
SHORT CUTS, there is a series of loosely connected subplots
dealing with large number of characters that happen to be
one place at a particular time. In this case, the place is
Paris, where crcme de la crcme of fashion industry - models,
designers and media - gather for one of two annual fashion
shows. This is an opportunity for Altman to show us whole
variety of unusual characters and present hypocrisy,
depravity and pointlessness that rule supreme in that world.</P>
<P>For many people, including the author of this review, READY
TO WEAR was a disappointment. Script by Altman and Barbara
Schulgasser is at times really mean towards fashion
industry, but the edge, that used to be so effective against
Hollywood in PLAYER, is missing. Perhaps this is due to the
fact that Altman and Schulgasser had less knowledge of
fashion industry than of Hollywood. Loose structure of this
film works against it - some subplots and characters are
effective, and some aren't and only makes this film longer
than it should be. Some characters (including celebrities
playing themselves in cameo roles) appear for no apparent
reason. The stories are often interrupted with
quasi-documentary footage of fashion shows and,
consequently, film looses its pace. The thing that saves
READY TO WEAR are the actors who seem to have great deal of
fun playing outrageous and often pathetic characters
(especially Richard E. Grant and Forest Whitaker as two gay
designers or Marcello Mastroianni and Sofia Loren as old
lovers). The other thing is ironic, not so subtle but
nevertheless very effective ending that would undoubtedly
please some male members of the audience. In any case, READY
TO WEAR, despite being a disappointment, still presents us
with an interesting look towards one of the most visible
phenomena of modern culture.</P>
