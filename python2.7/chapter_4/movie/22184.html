The Cider House Rules</P>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"Cider House" cuddles itself around you like a sixty year old afghan.
Seemingly a heartwarming yarn of a cynical, yet loving, orphanage caretaker
(Caine) and one orphan that's been adopted twice and returned twice
(Maguire); this crochet comforter eventually becomes more of a patch work
quilt. Caine narrates this much of the tale even before the opening credits
finish. Though the first act blankets the screen with the warm
cinematographic look and against-all-odds optimism of "October Sky," "Cider
House Rules" never quite leaves the ground.</P>
<P>Caine grooms Maguire for his position as caretaker/obstetrician at the St.
Cloud orphanage, but instead, the good-natured, intelligent young Maguire
seizes a sudden opportunity to see the world. This is where the movie
changes its tone. No longer about the Caine/Maguire (promising son leaving
his possessive, but loving father) relationship, "Cider House" becomes a
soap opera platform for a pro-choice/pro-life debate eventually favoring the
former.</P>
<P>An attempted metaphor for society's meaningless out-of-date, out-of-touch
traditions/rituals/morals, "The Rules" serve as a constant pain in the butt
to those "real" (in-touch) people in the film. But, since these rules have
never been demonstrated to mean a darn thing to our endearing main
character, all the fuss about them at the end doesn't mean much to the
viewer. It could have worked, had Irving re-written Maguire's already
lovably indifferent demeanor.</P>
<P>The photography is grand and the acting solid all the way through with
special cudos to Delroy Lindo as the apple picker crew boss. Though each
scene stands strong on its own, the film as a whole falls short, trying hard
to condense just too much of the novel's material into a little over two
hours of cinema time. New threads start too far from where the old ones
finish, leaving "Cider House" with more patches than a quilt despite its
sincerely fine beginning.</P>
<P>Though two other John Irving books have been made into films ("World
According to Garp" and "Hotel New Hampshire"), the "Cider House" screenplay
is the first to have been penned by him as well.</P>
