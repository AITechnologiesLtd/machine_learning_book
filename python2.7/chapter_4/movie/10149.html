A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: 
Wes Craven</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: 
Kevin Williamson</PRE>
<P>Starring: 
Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Laurie Metcalf, Jerry
O'Connell, Timothy Olyphant, Liev Schreiber</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Slasher at large. Whodunit mystery that spoofs the horror genre. Young,
hip, heroes who spout pop culture witticisms.</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
This fun movie is the sequel to SCREAM (1996), a gore spoof and slasher
parody which pitted heroes Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David
Arquette against an anonymous, masked movie enthusiast/marauder whose
murderous style was based on horror genre cliches. Since SCREAM 2 picks
up where the original SCREAM left off, let's take a moment to remember
the original. In SCREAM the running gag is that the mysterious masked
killer always follows film cliches, but luckily the killer's prey are
movie buffs who try to predict the killer's next move based on the same
cliches. High school girl Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is stalked by
the movie enthusiast/killer. But she turns the tables, and tries to
solve the mystery of her masked stalker's identity. Also in on the hunt
is sleazy, catty, tabloid reporter Gail Weathers (Courteney Cox), and
lawman Deputy Dewey Riley, (David Arquette) a baby-faced, inept
investigator. In SCREAM 2, Director Wes Craven and Writer Kevin
Williamson team up again to create another whodunit that follows the
further adventures of hapless SCREAM characters Sidney, Gail, and Dewey.
This time, Sidney is a theater student in a college town when a series
of SCREAM copycat murders occurs. Sidney becomes the next most probable
victim. Soon enough she is joined by reporter Gail and friend Dewey, and
they all try to figure who the new masked slasher is. The problem is,
people keep conveniently arriving just as the masked attacker leaves, or
leaving just before the killer appears, making everyone a possible
suspect. Sidney and friends trade hip and witty barbs about movie and
pop culture trivia as they wrack their brains trying to figure out the
killer's pattern. Who is the slasher really? The boyfriend? Another film
student? Gail, Dewey, Sidney, the roommate, the sorority girls, the
cops, the recently released jailbird, or an unknown wacko? Find out. </P>
<P>Opinion:
The thing about any sequel is the question: "Is it as good as the
original?" In this case the answer is yes. If you liked SCREAM, then
chances are, youll think that SCREAM 2 is at least in the same
ballpark. One thing I like about SCREAM 2 is that it spends some time
developing the characters from SCREAM so that you come to know more
about them and like them. If you intend to see this movie, I highly
advise seeing SCREAM (on video) first, because SCREAM 2 assumes that you
remember all the characters and events of SCREAM. It can get slightly
confusing if youre not up on the original story. Here's an example: In
the original SCREAM, one of the characters talks about a movie being
made. "I see myself as sort of a young Meg Ryan. But with my luck, I'll
get Tori Spelling." In SCREAM 2, sure enough, the characters are
watching a movie called STAB, based on the events of SCREAM. Tori
Spelling plays the STAB actress!</P>
