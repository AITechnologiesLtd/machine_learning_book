<PRE>                              BOYS ON THE SIDE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Whoopi Goldberg, Mary-Louise Parker, Drew Barrymore.
Screenplay:  Don Roos.
Director:  Herbert Ross.</P>
<P>     I have nothing against that ever-growing sub-genre of American
filmmaking known as the "chick flick;" however, I do have a problem
with the idea that women will flock to any slapdash attempt at a sob
story, any muddled mess which happens to include female friends,
mothers and daughters and truckloads of tragedy.  Hollywood knows a
lot about how to market films to women, but it has done a pretty
miserable job of making them.  Fortunately, BOYS ON THE SIDE is that
rare creation, an emotional film that actually takes the time to
develop characters, although it goes a bit overboard in its third
act.</P>
<P>     BOYS ON THE SIDE begins in New York, where night club singer
Jane DeLuca (Whoopi Goldberg) is experiencing something of a career
downturn.  She decides to try her luck in Los Angeles, and looks for
someone to share a ride.  She finds Robin Nickerson (Mary-Louise
Parker), a prim real estate agent looking for a change of scenery,
and the very odd couple begins their cross-country trek.  Along the
way they are joined by Jane's friend Holly (Drew Barrymore), who is
fleeing from an abusive relationship, and the three women take to
the road.  But circumstances force them to stop before L.A., and the
relationships between the three friends are complicated by love,
illness, pregnancy and a murder trial.</P>
<P>     The first half of BOYS ON THE SIDE is surprisingly funny and
effective, thanks largely to three winning performances by Goldberg,
Parker and Barrymore.  Goldberg has coasted quite a bit lately,
playing the same hipper-than-thou character with a perpetual furrow
in her brow as she deals with dopey white folks, but she is quite
good here.  Her Jane is more layered, a lesbian with an unfortunate
habit of falling for straight women, and Goldberg is solid in a more
emotional role than any she has tackled since THE COLOR PURPLE.
Parker is a more subtle actress, and she has to be in a role that
easily could have become a fussy stereotype; instead, Robin is an
extremely sympathetic and appealing character.  But it is Drew
Barrymore who steals every scene she is in as the hopelessly
flirtatious Holly.  There is a positively infectious energy in her
performance, and the scene in which the three women subdue her drug
dealing boyfriend includes several hilarious highlights.</P>
<P>     BOYS ON THE SIDE is very funny, but there is more to it than
that.  Director Herbert Ross (who previously covered similar ground
in STEEL MAGNOLIAS) makes some interesting choices which add real
depth to the characters and play against expectations.  In one early
scene, Robin sprays disinfectant on Jane's headphones before using
them, and Goldberg gives us a "you've got to be kidding" reaction
shot.  But that moment takes on a different resonance when it is
revealed that Robin has AIDS, and might be taking basic precautions.
Similarly, it is a surprise when Jane refuses to hold Robin's hand
after learning of her illness, since we expect a nearly divine level
of understanding from gay characters, but that moment is complicated
by the realization that Jane might be falling for Robin, and that
pulling away is just a way of expressing her fear of those emotions.</P>
<P>     There are numerous surprises like that, both funny and
touching, throughout the first half of BOYS ON THE SIDE, but the
second half is much more uneven.  Once the women stop in Tuscon,
much of the film's energy stops with them, and humor inevitably
gives way to bathos.  The relationship between Holly and an earnest
young cop (Matthew McConaughey) is fairly silly, and the
relationship between Robin and a bartender (James Remar) is hampered
by his complete blandness as a character.  Most frustrating is a
murder sub-plot, which is largely unnecessary and symptomatic of
screenwriter Don Roos' tendency to pile far too much into far too
little time.  This is a film about the friendships between these
three women, and it seriously falters when those friendships are not
the focus of the story.  When they are the focus, BOYS ON THE SIDE
does exactly what it sets out to do:  it makes you laugh, it makes
you sad, and it makes you care.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 boys on the side:  7.</PRE>
