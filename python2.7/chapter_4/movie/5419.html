<P>     Five liberals invite various right-wing extremists over for Sunday
dinner and death.  That's the premise of this heavy-handed black comedy
from up-and-coming director Stacy Title.  The liberals-- grad student
housemates, of course-- are played by a quintet of appealing young
actors.  Cameron Diaz, Annabeth Gish, Courtney B.  Vance, Jonathan
Penner, and Ron Eldard are an enjoyable ensemble, until their characters
become too smart-alecky for their own good.  The roles of the victims--
one per meal-- are relegated to (mostly) star cameos.  Look for Bill
Paxton as a racist redneck, Charles Durning as a homophobic priest, and
so on.  Paxton, as the first addition to their tomato patch, makes the
strongest impression of the lot.  However, by the time we get to Jason
Alexander's brief appearance as a meat-eating anti-environmentalist, the
joke has become extinct.  THE LAST SUPPER isn't nearly as funny as the
set- up suggests.  The characters all but bludgeon the audience with
their extreme political viewpoints.  Comedy has no room to breathe and,
by the turnabout-is-fair-play end, the heavy-handed narrative makes the
final transition from unbearable to just plain boring.  For this, talk
radio exists.</P>
