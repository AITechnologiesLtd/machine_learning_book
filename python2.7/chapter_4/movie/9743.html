<PRE>                                A LIFE LESS ORDINARY
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
                        Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: **1/2 (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>"In the old days, you just had to introduce a man and a woman and nature
did the rest."</P>
<P>So laments Jackson (Delroy Lindo), an angelic bounty hunter of sorts who,
along with co-operative O'Reilly (Holly Hunter), has been ordered back to
earth by "Chief of Police" Gabriel (Dan Hedaya) to help unite an unlikely
couple in "A Life Less Ordinary."</P>
<P>Robert (Ewan McGregor) is a janitor who has just lost his job to
automation.  Celine (Cameron Diaz) is the needs-to-be-indulged, spoiled
little rich girl who also happens to be the boss' daughter.  When Robert
bursts into Dad's (Ian Holm) office demanding his job back, Celine provides
for some spontaneous kidnapping material.  Robert, a bit of a dreamer,
hasn't thought this out very well, but he'll be damned if he'll be replaced
by a bloody robot, and the chase is on!</P>
<P>Sounds like something from the Coen brothers you're thinking.  Well, funny
you should say that...  "A Life Less Ordinary" contains a scene of a car
parked by the side of a freshly-plowed field with our protagonist
scrambling for his life in a ditch (see: "Blood Simple").  It's got a man
being walked through a thicket of silver birches to an imminent, grisly end
(see: "Miller's Crossing").  And it's got an attractive, slightly wacky
couple being hounded by some not-of-this-earth malevolence (see: "Raising
Arizona").</P>
<P>Could the casting of Coen alums Hunter and Hedaya simply be coincidental?</P>
<P>As it happens, the team that made "A Life Less Ordinary" isn't Joel and
Ethan Coen but rather the British threesome responsible for the black
comedy "Shallow Grave" and last year's transatlantic junkie hit,
"Trainspotting" (both of which starred McGregor): producer Andrew
MacDonald, writer John Hodge, and director Danny Boyle.  For their first
foray into the American mainstream, if you can call it that, what better
way to pay homage to the Coens' wild and whacked-out style than to try to
duplicate it?</P>
<P>For a good proportion of the film, they succeed.</P>
<P>The film is not as satisfying as it might be, however, due to some basic
miscalculations.  Diaz has already proven she can't sing (in "My Best
Friend's Wedding"), and the remarkably similar "dream sequence" in a
Karaoke bar just doesn't work.  The soundtrack, so well synchronized in
"Trainspotting," is all over the map here, with some songs actually
drowning out the actors' dialog in places.  Lindo and Hunter are oddly
peripheral in this picture, with Hunter resembling a strung-out Sarah
Jessica Parker, adding to her increasing roster of eccentric, unstable
women you'd be afraid to take home to Ma.  And what's with that cutesy
claymation bit over the end credits?</P>
<P>In "A Life Less Ordinary," writer Hodge does comes up with some very funny
scenarios, especially those involving the honest, naïve Robert hopelessly
attempting to pass himself off as a ruthless tough guy.  His love for
Celine might turn out as obvious as the trashy novel he plans to write, but
that's a cracked American romance for you, even as envisioned by a trio of
Brits.</P>
