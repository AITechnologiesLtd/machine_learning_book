<P>There is something about Erin Brockovich that makes it virtually impossible
for the film not to please. Perhaps it is Julia Roberts' overflowing
cleavage, perfectly round nostrils or famously plump lips that have made her
the quintessential movie star of our time. Perhaps it is director Steven
Soderbergh's deft guidance and meticulous attention to reality. Perhaps it
is the compelling story that demands the audience's respect with its early
claim of truth.</P>
<P>`I'm great with people' begs a desperate Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) in
a job interview. She doesn't get the position. But that's nothing new; this
30-something super mom has grown accustomed to raising her three youngsters
while trying to simultaneously shield their eyes from her $16 bank account.
So when from
out of nowhere a speeding doctor's high-priced Jaguar strikes her car, a
lawsuit looks to be the answer to her problems.</P>
<P>Brockovich is ridiculed on the stand as her unemployment and two failed
marriages are
brought to light and the jury is convinced she's an irresponsible woman
trying to sucker a good and honest doctor out of his money. But fate works
in mysterious ways and soon Brockovich has a job . . . working for the
lawyer who lost her case.</P>
<P>Erin Brockovich isn't so much about the life of the woman's name it shares
as the thrilling legal battle that she wages working for the aforementioned
attorney. In filing some papers for a pro-bono real estate case, she
stumbles onto oddities that lead her to investigate mass contamination in a
small community's water supply and the multi-billion-dollar corporation that
is trying to cover it up.</P>
<P>The movie's only substantial flaw is that rather than dedicating all of its
time to the intriguing lawsuit, a fair amount of attention is given to
Brockovich's personal life and the old-fashioned cliché of her being married
to her job and putting her family second. The film simply doesn't need these
scenes. There is already an emotional angle as Brockovich becomes
sympathetic and friendly to the sick and dying families that have had their
life ruined by the local water supply (she even professes to know all 600 of
their phone numbers by heart). The most enjoyable scenes of the movie take
place in a back office where strategies are discussed and a conference room
where settlements are negotiated - not the bedroom where her kids complain
about her not being home for dinner.</P>
<P>Erin Brockovich has the potential to be a major Oscar candidate as its style
plays to the Academy's liking. What doesn't, however, is the release date.
Oscar voters traditionally love true stories like Quiz Show, A Civil Action
and, more recently, The Hurricane as well as brilliant lead female
performances like the one Roberts turns in. But the Academy's memory is
notoriously non-existent so a March release normally means a shutout on
Oscar night.</P>
<P>For Steven Soderbergh this might be his best work to date. Having previously
overseen sex, lies, and videotape, Out of Sight and, more recently, The
Limey, all to critical acclaim, the director seems more confident than ever
in his ninth film. Other than Roberts and teh notable Albert Finney,
Soderbergh had no major actors to work with but still manages to get mighty
performances out of his supporting cast while still keeping an appropriately
bright spotlight on his diva star.</P>
<P>America seems to be very interested in its own laws and how they are upheld.
John Grisham's books fly off the shelves, O. J. captivated television
audiences for over a year and Rodney King sparked riots. America is equally
fond of grade-A crowd-pleasing movies with the local cinema being a key part
of our culture. Erin Brockovich is the perfect combination of both.</P>
