<P>     David Cronenberg's eXistenZ may be as thematically dense a film as
we'll see all year.  It touches on the nature of reality, and the ways we
seek to escape it and embrace it at the same time.  It addresses issues of
violence in the media, as well as the nature of constructing a work of
fiction.  It's a cautionary tale, and a caution against excessive caution.
It's a social satire, and even a self-satire.  It's also, ultimately, a
sinkhole for narrative and characterization.  Cronenberg has created an
emotionally weightless intellectual exercise that's fun to parse but
little fun to watch.</P>
<P>     eXistenZ begins with what amounts to a preview screening for a new
cutting edge virtual reality game called eXistenZ, designed by reclusive
gaming genius Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh).  Before she can begin
the first demonstration, however, Allegra is the target of an
assassination attempt by a radical anti-virtual reality terrorist.
Accompanied by Ted Pikul (Jude Law), the game company's marketing intern,
as her impromptu bodyguard, Allegra heads into the countryside to see if
her eXistenZ prototype game module -- damaged in the assassination attempt
-- can be saved.  The only way to test that, of course, is to play the
game, leading Allegra and Ted to discover a world almost too similar to
the "real world" to tell the difference.</P>
<P>     If you know your Cronenberg (VIDEODROME, THE FLY, CRASH) at all, you
know that you're entering a decidedly freaky realm.  The world of eXistenZ
includes pseudo-organic game pods that plug into the users' spines through
a "bio-port" and a big umbilical cord; it features a pistol made of flesh
and bone that fires human teeth (all the better to escape detection).
Those who got off on the head-trippy kinkiness of CRASH will find
themselves quite comfortable with a film in which characters get frisky
with the holes in each other's backs, and where a meal in a Chinese
restaurant consists of mutant amphibians sucked right off the skeleton.</P>
<P>     Those same viewers may also find themselves wrapped up in
deconstructing Cronenberg's various messages.  The design of the game pods
-- which none-too-subtly resemble a compilation of erogenous zones --
turns into a poke at the masturbatory nature of video games, while
Allegra's writhing response to "plugging in" adds drug addiction to the
metaphorical layering.  The story treats us to characters who commit
violence in the real world while thinking they're still in a game world
-- a creepy, timely commentary on the influence of pop culture violence --
then takes a swipe at the actions of the neo-Luddite anti-game faction.
Perhaps most amusingly, eXistenZ plays with how characters behave in a
fictional world, extending by implication to the plot-advancing
conventions in film itself.  There's enough sub-text in eXistenZ to keep a
viewer well-occupied for its 97 minutes.</P>
<P>     If only Cronenberg had bothered to bring along any actual text to
flesh out that subtext.  eXistenZ plays out like a scholarly analysis of
itself, a cinematic Cliff's Notes for a novel that doesn't actually exist.
Leigh and Law are as purely functional in their roles as their characters
are in their game-roles, and while Cronenberg may find that little
meta-joke amusing, for a viewer it's merely distracting.  By the time the
plot of eXistenZ starts folding in on itself (leading to a revelation
that's not at all revelatory if you've been paying attention), you may
find yourself wondering why you should care about any of it.  Cronenberg
is as stylistically distinctive a film-maker as we have in this
cookie-cutter era, but he's locked himself into a rut of message-filled
visions with no human connection.  eXistenZ plays out like a hallucinatory
letter to the editor.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 eXistenZial angsts:  5.</PRE>
