<PRE>                           MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>102 min., R, Drama, 1991
Director: Gus Van Sant
Cast: River Phoenix, Keanu Reeves, James Russo, William Richert,
      Rodney Harvey, Michael Parker, Flea, Chiara Saselli, Udo Kier</P>
<P>     River Phoenix is a narcoleptic (a disorder in the brain that causes
the person to go into a temporary coma-like state at times) street
hustler.  River Phoenix decides to try to find his mother, who he hasn't
seen for years.  He goes on the journey with his friend Keanu Reeves,
who is the son of the mayor.  Along the way the two have a problem
trying to locate River Phoenix's mother because she moved around a lot.
Also along the way they are  followed, it seems, by gay Udo Kier.</P>
<P>     I saw MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO several weeks ago and am just getting
around to writing my review on it.  I have found out that it is coming
to video around April 22 and would like to discourage people from
wasting their money renting this film.  I found both the story and the
acting to be pitiful.  By the end I hated River Phoenix's character and
hoped that he never met his mother just because I wasted my time sitting
though the film.  MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO is rated R for explicit language,
adult situations, and female nudity.  On a scale of zero to five, I give
MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO a one.</P>
<P>     The only redeeming quality that this film has, and the only reason
this film even received a one, is the cinematography -- especially the
Idaho sequences.  Those I found to be impressive to watch, but,
unfortunately that wonderfulness will be lost on a small screen.  So, if
you must watch this film, which I highly don't recommend, then watch it
in a theater, but in a relatively cheap theater so you don't waste too
much of your money.  The acting, I found, in this film was crude.  It
looked like the actors called in the performances instead of really
being there.  I felt no sympathy for any of the people in the film, not
a bit.</P>
