<P>   Neither a commercial nor a critical blockbuster, "The Young
Girls of Rochefort" was a disappointing finale to Jacques
Demy's early-career trilogy.  "Rochefort" is a far cry from
Jacques Demy's earlier "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg," a
smashing musical which in which every syllable is sung and
which spotlights a bittersweet romance between the precious
Catherine Deneuve and handsome Nino Castelnuovo. 
"Rochefort" sank quickly in 1967,  allegedly because it was
neither here nor there--a Hollywood musical made by a
Frenchman who adored the genre.  Spike Lee once said that
movies about the black experience should never be made by
white directors.  Steven Spielberg et al prove him wrong, but
perhaps American musicals should remain domestic category
unsullied by the inspiration of composers from lands across
the sea whose love for this all-American invention will usually
exceed their proficiency.</P>
<P>   The plot of "The Young Girls of Rochefort" is contrived, but
that's no problem.  This is the fate of many an opera and
musical as well.  The real flaws, however, appear early on. 
For one thing, Michel Legrand's music may be grand enough,
but it's repetitive.  You may leave the theater humming his
melodies, but that's only because a single air dominates
virtually every song.  When a film bursts with tuneful energy
almost throughout its over two-hour length, redundance is
lethal.   For another thing, Demy loses focus repeatedly. 
Whereas a romantic work by Comden and Green, or Lerner
and Loewe, or Rodgers and Hammerstein will center on two
characters, Demy's cinematographer, Ghislain Cloquet, is all
over France's southwest provincial city of Rochefort, spending
most of his time displaying the color of the townspeople--
whose women all have bell-shaped figures and whose men
can dance like Gene Kelly.  Granted: the director is in love
with the coastal towns of France, principally Nantes,
Cherbourg, and Rochefort, but to keep such a piece on a
human scale demands a fix on two, or three, or four
individuals at most.</P>
<P>   "The Young Girls of Rochefort" seemed an unlikely
candidate for restoration, that honor belonging in recent
months to classics like "Gone With the Wind," and "8-1/2." But
Jacques Demy's widow, filmmaker Agnes Varda,  pays
homage to her husband in restoring the print and digitalizing
the sound track.  The colors appear faded after thirty-one
years but the voices and music come across just fine.</P>
<P>   As with "Umbrellas," Jacques Demy gives the lucky town
the appearance of a Grimm's fairy tale. light on the grim. His
Rochefort is a happy place filled with people who are 90%
young and all dreaming of love love love, but only if they can
share it with their ideal men and women: a Cinderella and
Prince population.  The principal characters have not found
partners and given their good looks and pure souls, we can't
help wondering why not.  The middle-aged Yvonne (Danielle
Darrieux) had once rejected a lovely man simply because she
thought his name, Simon Dame, was laughable (think
"Messieurs dames," a greeting one gives when he enters a
public place).  Her daughter Delphine (Catherine Deneuve)
teaches dance, has just broken up with an overbearing artist,
and seeks an unknown painter who has done a portrait
likeness of her.  Delphine's fraternal twin sister Solange
(Francoise Dorleac--who was Deneuve's real-life sister) awatis
her prince while artist Maxence (Jacques Perrin), an incredibly
handsome painter, seeks the woman whose face he has
painted purely from his imagination.  When two workers with a
traveling fair, Etienne (George Chakiris) and Bill (Grover Dale)
offer to drive the women to Paris, they inadvertently lead the
title characters to the men of their dreams.</P>
<P>   Deneuve and Dorleac are both heavily made up and come
across like kewpie dolls ready for immortalization in Tussaud's
wax museum.  One critic describes Deneuve's appearance as
that of "a novice on her way to a brothel."  "Rochefort"
features also Michel Piccoli in the role of the jilted Simon
Dame, who now owns an impressive music shop in the town,
and Gene Kelly as Dame's American friend Andy--who bumps
into Solange on the street and falls instantly in love.  No
matter that Kelly is 55 years old and Dorleac is 23.</P>
<P>   As the plot is not ample enought to exploit the substantial
length of the movie, Demy spends a good deal of time fixed
on the residents of the town who are so cheerful and
wholesome that we don't wonder that the girls want to leave
the place for Paris.  They dance and sing, they sing and
dance, one dance like every other, each song a recap of the
previous one.  Over and over, Deneuve and Solange croon,
"We are twin sisters born under the sign of Gemini/
mi,fa,sol,la,mir,re,re,mi,fa,sol,sol,sol,re,do.  The second verse
pretty much describes the extent of the film's variety.</P>
