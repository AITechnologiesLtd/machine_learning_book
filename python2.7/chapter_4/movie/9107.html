<P>     This one left me a bit cold.  Director Curtis Hanson's acclaimed
adaptation of James Ellroy's neo-noir novel is overripe with all sorts
of wonderfully sordid stuff:  dirty cops, corrupt politicians, drug
smuggling, sex scandals, sleazy journalists, racism, murder, and, last
but not least, high-priced hookers surgically altered to look like movie
stars.  Fabulous art direction, a handsome cast, and a level of violence
that actually shocks (for a change) are the stronger selling points.
The overly-complicated script, however, ultimately short changes the
characters.  Nearly every incident relates, in some way, to the bigger
mystery.  And, with precious few asides-- chances for the characters to
simply *be*-- individual scenes become difficult to appreciate as
anything other than pieces to the larger puzzle.  (As in THE GAME, your
brain is busy working ahead.  And even *then* some things don't add up.
Such as a sudden outburst of sexual aggression from one of the main 
characters.)  Admittedly, part of the problem is in front of the camera.
Two of the three leads are non-stars:  Guy Pearce (PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF
THE DESERT) and Russell Crowe (VIRTUOSITY, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD).
They're very good, but neither commands the screen to the extent that
you can't take your eyes off of them.  Same goes for Kevin Spacey, who
we *know* can muster more dramatic weight than he does here.</P>
