<P>A Bronx Tale reminds me a lot of Goodfellas. It stars Robert De Niro who
also directed. It also has a cameo by Joe Pesci. I thought I even saw
Martin Scorsece as a priest at a confessional. I began to think that
this movie took it's style and grace from Goodfellas. Then it hit me
that it reminded me of
Goodfellas because A Bronx Tale is almost as great.</P>
<P>Lorenzo (Robert De Niro) is a working man. He has a city job as a bus
driver and makes enough to let his wife and son live well in an
apartment in the Bronx. He never got in the popular gangster business
that ruled the area. The apartment he lives in in near a busy bar that
is home to many of these
gangsters. He tells his 9 year old son Calogero (Francis Capra) to never
go in there and to stay on his stoop in front of the complex.</P>
<P>In a discussion earlier Lorenzo talked to his son about talent. Calogero
asks him who was the best baseball player of all time. Lorenzo tells him
it was Joey D(iMaggio) because he has class and talent. Calogero asks if
he has any talent. Lorenzo says that he has all the talent in the world
and just needs to
use it wisely.</P>
<P>Calogero witnesses a shooting while sitting on the stoop commited by the
local main gangster Sonny (Chazz Palminteri who also wrote the script).
When confronted by a police officer who is shown a line of suspects and
asked who shot. The lineup consists of some of the workers and some
gansters who were the bar. Sonny is in the lineup. Calogero walks past
the line saying that none of the men commited the murder.</P>
<P>Lorenzo takes him upstairs to get him ready for bed. Calogero asks his
father if he did the right thing. Lorenzo says "You did a very good
thing for a very bad man."</P>
<P>Cut to the late 60s. Calogero (now nicknamed C by Sonny and played by
Lillo Brancato) now is 17 years old and one of Sonny's "men". Lorenzo is
shocked that his son has not listened to anything he has said through
the years. C now has become everything Lorenzo hates. A gangster who
wants
his money the second he asks.</P>
<P>A Bronx Tale is actor Robert De Niro first directed film. He does a
great job directing himself and others. Some of the scenes such as a
fight in the bar are very nicely edited and staged to music that sets
the mood. Palmenteri also does a great job as Sonny and is both
frightening and fatherlike in the same instant. Lillo Brancato is a
great find and plays his part very well. He is a charming young actor
who I hope has a good career.</P>
<P>The film is also suprising funny. It is probably the most upbeat ganster
picture if you don't count Jonny Dangerously (which I don't). There is a
great scene in the first 20 minutes where C narrates the people young
Calogero meets in the bar. Some has nicknames like Coffeecake (the look
of that man's
face) and Whispers (everything's a secret to him).</P>
<P>The film ends suddenly and makes me ask for more. It is noticably very
short considering Goodfellas was about 20 minutes longer. Still A Bronx
Tale fills it's tight 2 hours with as much as it can. I wanted to spend
more time finding out what happens to C. I doubt a sequel will be made
but I'd still like to know.</P>
