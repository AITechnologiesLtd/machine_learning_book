<P>Susan Granger's review of "SESSION 9" (USA Films)</P>
<P>   Sometimes you just get more than your bargained for...like when
Boston-based Hazmat Elimination, run by Scottish actor Peter Mullan and his
trusty assistant, David Caruso, assures a town engineer (Paul Guilifoyle) that
they can remove insidious asbestos fibers from a Victorian hospital facility in
a week. Erected in 1871, deserted and decomposing since 1985, the Danvers Mental
Hospital, is one of the most malevolent "locations" ever chosen for a film. The
structure is so massive - with its labyrinth of rubble-strewn corridors,
collapsing floors, stagnant pools of water, isolation cells, and ominous
surgical chambers where experimental pre-frontal lobotomies were performed -
that their task seems impossible within that time frame. And each member of
their inexperienced crew (Stephan Gevedon, Brandon Sexton III, and Josh Lucas)
is coping with his own personal demons as, one by one, their minds seem to be
affected by the grim areas in which they're working. The film's title is derived
from salvaged reel-to-reel audio-recorded sessions involving the demonic
possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities. By the
time Session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters.</P>
<P> Filmmaker Brad Anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome
chainsaw-massacre-type ghost story but the script lacks structure and isn't
particularly scary. The conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Session 9" is a dark, gloomy 4. Silly me...at
first, I thought that the original name of the Danvers Lunatic Asylum bore some
reference to Mrs. Danvers, the creepy housekeeper played by Judith Anderson in
Alfred Hitchcock's truly terrifying "Rebecca" that also involved a cavernous
mansion called Manderley.</P>
