<PRE>                                   THE SAINT
                       A film review by Joshua McAdams
                        Copyright 1997 Joshua McAdams</PRE>
<P>        Boy, what can you say about a movie like the Saint? Did I say
movie? I apologize. I should have referred to this Val Kilmer vehicle
as an experience ---  an experience that I will now attempt to relate
to you. It was four in the afternoon on a rainy Sunday  when I pulled
into the parking lot at the Carmike Six Theater. As local movie houses
go the Carmike is easily the best in Charlottesville; the screens are
the right ratio, the sound is DTS, and the place is generally showing
big budget  films with mass appeal. Case in point, last week Carmike
was screening four different Harrison Ford movies in five  theaters.
Talk about over-exposure.
        The first thing I noticed was the line that generated from the
box office and spilled into the parking lot to block traffic. Strange,
I thought, there must be a debut this week other than "The Saint."
Quickly I scanned the posters hanging outside: it was definitely too
late for  Star Wars mania and word of mouth had pretty much killed
"The Devil's Own." It turned out that two other features, both low
concept romantic comedies,  were going heads-up with Val this very
weekend. Still, even taking into account the weather and the sizable
student population, I got the errie feeling that these carbon drones
were really waiting in line to see a cheap Mission Impossible rip-off.
        Now don't get me wrong, I thought Mission Impossible was an
James Bond rip-off, but at least it was expensive. I'd seen the
trailers for "The Saint" --- lots of Kilmer in disguises, Elizabeth
Shue acting vulnerable, and machine guns in every third shot.  Enough
of the plotline had trickled out to let everyone know that communism
may be dead but those crazy Russians were up to something again. As
contrived as it was,  Mission Impossible killed Emilio Estevez in the
first reel and then dusted Voight in the climax! The most one could
look forward to with "The Saint" is allot gunplay and generic villains
delivering cornball lines. Yet here I was locking my car door and
strolling toward the theater.
        I walked quickly up the sidesteps and examined the lobby. The
"Help Wanted" sign had been taken down so I had to assume the theater
was no longer under-staffed. No matter. Two guys, both high school
age, were grabbing cash and handing out tickets like trained seals at
the box office. The concession stand was absolutely buried under five
different lines of hungry movie-goers eager to pay the 300% markup for
artery clogging popcorn.  Quickly I counted out anyone at these two
stations, they were too busy to notice me and hadn't batted an eye
before when I did my thing. The assistant manager was a different
story however. 
        Standing in his red-vested monkey suit at the portal to the
screens, he was mechanically ripping tickets and giving directions to
the public. The Jedi Mind Trick had never worked on him, he took it
way too personal to be influenced with any slick talking.  The
"backdoors", two wide corridors for exiting patrons that can be
accessed from the front of the lobby,  looked like the best bet.
However, they were not without risk. If spotted by Monkey Boy
assistant manager there would probably be a confrontation. The rest of
the staff were getting paid 4.25 an hour and doing their level best to
avoid bumping heads with anyone; especially someone that looked like
they would make them feel stupid for even questioning. Monkey Boy was
a different story, he had actually thwarted me and comrade just the
day before at a four oclock showing of Star Wars.
         I opened the door and walked inside, finding a place at the
back of a food line.  Slowly drifted sideways, pretending to examine
the Titanic hanging poster, and tried to scope the manager. I hadn't
seen him here in weeks but I knew that he would be on-premises for a
triple debut weekend. But where?  There he was, coming out of the
"Employees Only" door with a roll of greenbacks  in his hand, looking
flustered, annoyed, and constipated all at once.  The day was going
bad for him, he was probably scheduled off but had to show up when the
place was swamped by unexpected interest in "The Saint." As he crossed
to the ticket booth I made my move, sliding behind a tall potted plant
just as Monkey Boy looked down to rip  tickets and proceeding down
the one way open corridor. The exposure time was less than three
seconds but the familiar juice was still there - a hot rush that
generated in my upper spine and flowed through my head until it began
to resonate behind my eyes. 
         I made a b-line for the theater where "The Saint" was playing
but DAMN! ---there was a chick taking tickets right in front of the
double doors. It was to late, having already committed I held my
breath and just jump right in and walked straight past her. She didn't
even acknowledge me. Once inside the viewing area my prediction was
realize; the place was packed. I stood against the wall for a few
minutes then sat it the last seat on the left in the last row. A few
minutes after the designated start time the lights dimmed and the
projector whirred to life.
        The movie began erratically in flashback. The weakest title
card I have ever seen in my life tells us its: The Far East -
Yesterday. Cool idea about the ambivalence of the timeline but the
delivery is fundamental screwed by a generic block font that
completely clashes with spirit of a spy adventure film. It turns out
that The Saint is was once a nameless orphan with a gift for picking
locks. He wreaks havoc at the orphanage and escapes one night but not
before: (A) naming himself Simon Templar and (B)watching his first
love dashed to pieces on a hardwood floor when she is knocked off a
balcony by a couple of German Shepherds lead by the Evil Priest!
Attack dogs hunting down away children? In a Catholic orphanage? It a
little extreme even for the Far East. They couldnt expect us to buy
that, could they? Yes, they actually did feel you would buy it
because after that  "The Saint" ventures into fields of ludicrous
absurdity hitherto untrodden. Certain things can be bad but tragically
comic at the same time. See Daylight and recently released Devils Own
for examples of such camp.  The Saint is so screwed up that you have
to dig deep in the cluttered rough to find even the most tarnished
chunk of iron sulfide. Needless to say the plot is Hollywood fools
gold on a level of such utter banality that a I could spend hours
peering into, and shining the light of day through, each and every
plothole. 
        The second title card fades in the words :Moscow - Tomorrow.
Then some  Russian oil magnate is shown goading his rebellious
countrymen by mimicking Mark Anthony in his famous Caesar funeral
dirge: "Friends, Countrymen, Russians!" The crowd assembled cheers and
the screenwriters figured the crowd in the theater would shiver at the
thought of yet more anarchist Russians controlling the power of
nuclear life or death over us. Hell, Muscovites cant even feed
themselves, so I aint worried about them too much; but i guess it's
better than Islamic terrorists.
        Enter the orphan who has fashioned himself into a high-end
thief who  can scale walls, crack safes, and  deliver cheesy
one-liners with the best of them.  Mr. Templar steals a important
"microchip" from the Bad Russian Industrialist but not before creating
a "jealous son" subplot that is never explore during the rest of the
movie. Bad Russian Industrialist then hires The Saint to steal  a new
formula for creating free and endless energy. 
        Enter Elizabeth Shue as, get this, a scientist who invents
said workable cold fusion theory! In here first scene she stands,
complete with schoolgirl skirt and bobby socks, and answers some
questions posed by her colleagues on her invention. A vacuous actor
playing a equally vacuous-looking rocket scientist queries "Could you
explain the process of cold fusion?"  All he left out was the part
about "for the audience." 
        Immediately Simon falls for the hot bookworm and has a moral
dilemma when he steals the formula from his new found love.  Should he
turn the plans over to the Bad Russian Industrialist? Should he give
it back? 
        Before any of these questions can be explored the story once
again degenerates into endless shots of Russian thugs running after
Kilmer, Russian thugs shooting machine guns at Kilmer, or Russian
thugs chasing Kilmer in a Range Rover. Did I say this movie was beyond
bad?  It gets worse. Example: the hip-hop, one-two-one soundtrack that
makes you feel like you are attending some under 18 rave sponsored by
Diet Pepsi. I must have checked my watch on at least a dozen different
occasions. 
        When the plot dragged to the point where it became painful I
sat in on Jedi for a few minutes to try and remember what good,
creative filmmaking was all about.  As much as I'd like to have stayed
and watch the Emperor try to turn Luke to the Dark Side of the Force I
had to go back. After all, I had burn too many synapses plotting my
ingress strategy to not see the majority of the flick I came to judge.</P>
<P>        Back in cinematic hell I began to notice that the special
devices, pre-requisites in an spy caper, were exceptional low budget
and impractical. Though few of the gadgets worked miracles via
blinking lights alone, apparently Templar still had the functionally
inaccurate Macintosh laptop issued by the IM Force.  Unfortunately old
Simon should have considered what a better move it would have been to
back up Ethan Hunt instead of going solo. Sure the money is  better
playing the field but the chance of a sequel are completely ruined. 
        On a closing note I would like to say that Val Kilmer is
pretty much my ideal Hollywood actor.  I would cast him for one of my
leads any day. Hes been Jim Morrison and Deniros sidekick (the only
one to escape in "Heat"). Hes played an FBI agent  and Batman with
equal measures of aloof coolness. However in "The Saint" I fear that
the idea of headlining has gone to his head; he executes with the
carelessness and egotistical grandstanding of a bullfighter. Maybe it
was the director or maybe the lines he was given affected the
performance but I really expected more from the Iceman.  Elizabeth
Shue is a wasted completely and the Russian heavies were more comical
than anything.  
        All togather a bad, bad movie.</P>
<P>Rating:  Kilmer arches his eyebrows and Shue bats her lashes. People
fire machine guns endlessly with impunity. Fifty thousand dollar
automobiles explode. Is it action or romance? Do you care?</P>
