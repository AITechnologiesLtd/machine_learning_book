<PRE>                          LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  A whimsical shaggy-dog tale of a love
     story.  It is not much like anything you have seen before.
     Light fantasy mixes into a forty-year story of denied love,
     vengeance, and even a ghost or two.  We rarely see Mexican
     films in the art market, but this one is worth seeing.
     Rating: +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Relatively often we see Canadian films in the United States.  With the
length of the border we share with our neighbor to the south, it is
surprising that so few Mexican films ever get seen in this country.  With
the exception of some low-budget horror and science fiction films, few
Mexican movies ever make it north of the border.  Many that do come north
are popular only to make fun of.  Films like THE WRESTLING WOMEN VS. THE
AZTEC MUMMY or SHRIEK OF THE MUTILATED can hardly represent the best that
Mexico has to offer.  A reminder of that fact is LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE, a
pleasant shaggy-dog romance story told in the genre of magical realism.  In
magical realism, bizarre fantasy mixes with the everyday and is taken very
matter-of-factly.</P>
<P>     The story takes place in northern Mexico and southern Texas and centers
on Tita (played by Lumi Cavazos), her mother (played by Regina Torne' John),
and her two older sisters.  Tita grew up in the kitchen as a master cook.
The time comes when Tita falls in love with Pedro.  But Tita's mother
forbids Tita to marry then or ever.  Family tradition is that the youngest
daughter cares for the mother until the mother's death.  This arrangement
precludes any personal life for the daughter and reduces the daughter to
involuntary servitude.  At the insistence of the willful mother, Pedro
cannot have Tita, so he settles for Tita's older sister Rosaura.  But the
marriage is at first only a ruse.  Pedro is really using the marriage as an
excuse to remain close to Tita.  Tita is forced to prepare the wedding feast
for Pedro and Rosaura.  But the supernatural shows its hand in Tita's
cooking.  Tita expresses herself in her exquisite cooking only too well.
Eat what Tita has prepared and you will feel what Tita was feeling when she
made the dish.  The misery she feels while making  the wedding feast is
inexplicably spread to all the guests.  But its when Tita cooks a REALLY
happy meal that things start to happen.  Told against the background of a
Mexico in revolution in the first third of this century, this is a story of
anger and vengeance, yet it never loses its whimsical feel.</P>
<P>     At 144 minutes, LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE may be a bit long to sustain
interest through its entire length.  Still, the style is refreshingly
different from anything the American film industry is turning out.  It is
directed by sometime-actor Alfonso Arau with a screenplay by Laura Esquival
based on her own novel, which combines magical realism and recipes for the
dishes around which her story is built.  The title, incidentally, refers to
an anger as hot as the boiling water used for hot chocolate.  I can
recommend this one and give it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
