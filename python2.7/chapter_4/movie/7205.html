<PRE>                                THE CHAMBER
                                [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>The Chamber (1996) ** out of ***** - Cast: Chris O'Donnell, Gene Hackman,
Faye Dunaway, Raymond Berry, Lela Rochon, Bo Jackson. Written by: William
Goldman and Chris Reese. Directed by: James Foley. Running Time: 110
minutes.</P>
<PRE>                 *** This review does contain spoilers. ***</PRE>
<P>There are two characters that for the life of me I cannot figure out
Hollywood's fascination with: the President of the United States and
convicted murderers. "The Chamber" makes the FOURTH film in less than two
years about someone trying to save a GUILTY person from the death penalty.</P>
<P>Chris O'Donnell stars as Adam Hall, a fresh young lawyer who travels to
Mississippi to appeal the case of Sam Cahall (Gene Hackman), a convicted
murderer whose racist beliefs cause him to blow up a building containing a
Jewish lawyer and his two young children. We find out early that Hall is
actually Sam's grandson, which is why he has requested the case. He doesn't
seem to care for his grandfather, and it certainly seems like he hates
racism, but I guess he hates the death penalty even more. He must save his
mean old granddad from that mean old gas chamber.</P>
<P>Now knowing that this was the fourth movie in the last few months to do the
exact same story, stupid me, I figured that this was a mystery and was
trying to figure out who really planted that bomb so that mean old racist
Hackman can get out of jail. As I said, stupid me. Hackman is guilty. And
none of the characters make any sense. Hackman (who does give a good
performance, even with an illogical character) is mean, racist,
cold-hearted, yet forgiving, sympathetic, and kind. How is that possible?
And I already explained O'Donnell's paradox, I see no reason why he is
trying to save this man's life.</P>
<P>Another main problem is that Hackman's (and other's) racist speeches go
completely unanswered. While he's spouting his racist views we might see a
shot of someone rolling their eyes or whatever, but no one speaks up to put
Hackman in his place. It's as if the filmmakers think that all of society
has matured so much that everyone will also just roll their eyes and
realize, "Hey, racism is stupid". This can be dangerous. A great many people
who feel the way characters do in this film are still out there, and these
unanswered comments can make strong impressions on those weak-minded people.</P>
<P>I didn't get to see "The Chamber" in the theaters, it was gone too quickly.
That surprised me. John Grisham movies have always been blockbusters. After
seeing it however, I understand why. Attention Hollywood: the movie-going
public has no desire to see movies about people trying to save the lives of
convicted murderers! It just doesn't interest them. Go figure. [R]</P>
