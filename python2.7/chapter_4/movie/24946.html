<P>"Gladiator" is silly, overblown, and shallow. Perfect. It's highly
flawed, with many glaring defects immediately visible. Lovely. It
represents the worst kind of Hollywood excess, great sums of money
thrown at something ultimately pointless. Yee-haw! At the risk of
having my "serious film critic" certification revoked, I'm also going
to have to say that "Gladiator" is fun. It kicks ass. It totally
rules, dude. This movie forced itself on me; it made me have fun in
spite of myself. That's not supposed to happen -- I'm supposed to be a
serious, studious, jaded film critic! I did not think that "Gladiator"
was the greatest movie ever, but I suspect many critics are having the
same reaction I did (and some to a much greater extent): "Gladiator"
is greater than the sum of its parts. It turns critics into
hypocrites. Cool, huh?</P>
<P>This is the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe), top general in the Roman
Army and favorite of the current, aging emperor (Richard
Harris). After a major victory, the emperor calls Maximus in and tells
him that he, and not the emperor's cowardly son Commodus (Joaquin
Phoenix), will be named heir to the throne. Maximus is stunned by this
news, but he requests to return to his family once his military duties
are over. The emperor begs him to think about the offer before making
a decision, and Maximus agrees.  Unfortunately, he never gets to make
that decision, because Commodus kills his father upon hearing the
news, and by making it look like a natural death, is able to claim
innocence. Since no one else knew about the late emperor's offer, the
throne goes to Commodus, and the new emperor's first decision is to
order death upon Maximus and his family. Maximus manages to escape his
execution and is sold into slavery, eventually ending up in the hands
of Proximo (Oliver Reed), a trainer of gladiators. Maximus vows to get
his revenge by fighting his way to Rome and killing the emperor, but
he must stay alive long enough to do so.</P>
<P>"Gladiator" can easily be nit-picked to death. There are a lot of
little things wrong with it. The dialogue, for example, is usually
functional and unassuming, but the odd unintentional knee-slapper does
sneak in. (The early "emotional" scene between Commodus and his father
elicited a few chuckles from the audience, though I don't think it was
supposed to.) Sometimes the heroism gets a little overblown: Does
everyone need to react in overblown emotional fashion to everything?
And the characters mostly remain shallow archetypes; there's not a
whole lot of development here. Maximus is a good, honest man with a
short fuse, while Commodus is a slimy, cowardly snake who calculates
behind closed doors. The screenwriters make a few lame attempts at
developing these two, but their attempts generally fall flat. A family
for Maximus? Great, but we never really get to know them. Commodus
shows signs of an incestuous relationship with his sister Lucilla
(Connie Nielsen)? That wasn't necessary; we already know he's a bad
guy.</P>
<P>But despite all these problems, "Gladiator" still manages to be an
enjoyable ride, and I think part of the reason is Crowe. He has easy
charisma, which is instantly perceivable to the audience as soon as he
steps in front of the camera. We *want* to root for him. Crowe has
that elusive Mel Gibson quality: He's attractive to both men and women
(for sometimes different -- and sometimes similar -- reasons), he has
a voice that can make even the most banal lines sound sincere, and the
more he gets beaten and bloodied, the more we love him. Even when the
script gets preposterous, Crowe keeps it grounded in humanity with his
naturally honest performance, bringing his character more sympathy
than the script afforded him. If the early audience reaction to
"Gladiator" is any indication, Crowe could have a long and prosperous
career ahead of him.</P>
<P>Ridley Scott directs the film with some efficiency; his only real
missteps are some befuddling decisions he makes on how to film
transitions. Shots of clouds moving rapidly across the sky look great
-- but they belong in another movie. Most of "Gladiator" is grimy,
earthy, and grounded. This means that when Scott tries for an ethereal
feel between scenes, it's jarring. But that's okay; the battle
sequences deliver the goods.  Desiring to create whirling dervishes of
action, Scott does away with long establishing shots here; you get a
quick set-up detailing who's fighting who, and then the camera starts
spinning. Some may find this disorienting, and I can't really blame
them: Sometimes it is hard to tell what's going on.  But that's pretty
much the point. Real gladiator battles probably weren't carefully
choreographed dances. They were ugly, brutal, and short.  Scott's
accomplishment is in finding split-second pauses in the chaos to
center on one beautiful image, suggesting everything that has gone on
before it, before moving on to the next bit of jumbled action. You get
a shot of a gladiator raising his spear, some whirling movement, and
then a shot of an impaled foe. Put the pieces together.</P>
<P>It's hard to figure out what makes "Gladiator" so darn fun to watch.
It's not particularly original; the story and events have largely been
stolen from "Spartacus" and "Braveheart." The acting, while good (I
particularly liked the supporting turns from Oliver Reed and Derek
Jacobi, as a sympathetic senator), doesn't really stand out. The
battle scenes are exhilarating, but nothing new. The political
intrigue does provide some points of interest, especially in the
comparisons of the gladiator games to modern spectacles, professional
wrestling in particular. For example, the central conflict could
parallel any number of recent WWF storylines, with Maximus the popular
anti-hero and Commodus the reviled heel who cannot defeat the hero
without first winning over the crowd. Scott even seems to be making a
point here about the whole spectacle: Marx's famous quote about
religion being the "opiate of the masses" fairly describes Scott's
attitude towards spectator sports. Commodus uses the games to keep the
people complacent while he seizes power for himself. At one point,
Maximus screams to the bloodthirsty crowd, "Are you entertained?!" Is
Scott suggesting the audience question their own responses to his
bloody battle scenes?  Perhaps.</P>
<P>But even the political intrigue and contemporary references aren't the
real focus of the film; "Gladiator" is plot-driven, not
theme-driven. And that brings up the same question: What makes
"Gladiator" good? Considering that no one single part of it really
stands out, it ought to come off as a fairly mediocre film. But for
some reason, it doesn't, and I think I know why: "Gladiator" is an
*epic*, in every sense of the word, making liberal use of modern
technology to produce a movie in the Old Hollywood style. Sure, it's
no "Spartacus." It's not even "Braveheart." But all the right elements
are here: A hero who falls, only to rise again. A villain who thinks
he has the upper hand, only to have his one mistake come back to bite
him. Romance, politics, action -- what more could you ask for?
"Gladiator" isn't groundbreaking, but it's good old-fashioned
entertainment.</P>
