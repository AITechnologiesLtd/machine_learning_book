<P>     For fans of the ALIEN trilogy, SPECIES would have to do, at least
for now.  It is a good `alternative' ALIEN movie.  The creature, SIL, was
designed by world-renowned artist H. R. Giger who also incidentally
designed the original creature in ALIEN and also the variant in ALIEN
3.  If you simply can't get enough of the ferocious Xenomorph from the
ALIEN trilogy, well, SIL will definitely live up to your expectation,
except its much sleeker and not to mention smarter too.</P>
<P>     The movie does not wait.  SIL, a product of human embryo and alien
DNA is to be terminated due to some complications to the secret alien
research project.  What seems to be a normal young female, escapes the
facility, thanks to her superhuman abilities due to the alien genes in
her veins.  A trail of blood and gore follows from then on, with a
group of researchers, led by Kingsley hot on her trail.  There are a
lot of suspenseful situations (things jumping out etc.), sometimes, a
bit too much for comfort, your truly here did jump a bit on several
occasions so those with pacemakers, keep a backup just in case.
SPECIES also showcases some really good special effects, with Sil
transforming from human to alien and also all those tendrils which
explodes out from inside of her (yech!).</P>
<P>     The characters though, are as two dimensional as they can get but
hey, it is not as if those looking for some action and entertainment
even care.  Ben Kingsley gives his worst performance yet, in this film
(Maybe he's trying to break into the mainstream market in the likes of
DUSTIN HOFFMAN in OUTBREAK).  The star of the show without a doubt is
Sil herself.  The young girl who played her when she was a child was
quite memorable, thought short in duration but it is newcomer NATASHA
KENTSRIDGE who fared the best.  Granted that her role was not exactly a
tough one but she did manage to potray
the-beautiful-woman-with-that-deadly-secret very well.  Her Sil will
make men think twice before making out with a beautiful women, watch
and see!  She looked a bit like Schiffer if you ask me.  I would have
liked it even more if only they dealt more into the human-alien
conflict within Sil.</P>
<P>     Sad to say, the Singaporean version of SPECIES is about ten minutes
shorter, no thanks to the censorship board here.  The PG rating has
really taken its toll on the film.  Much of the explicit killing scenes
were butchered and Sil, who was practically topless 50% of the time,
was 100% clothed in this version.  Damn, should have given it an R(A)
rating; it isn't exactly a movie kids should watch anyway.
Nevertheless, I still found the movie enjoyable and is definitely one
of the better entertainment-film for this summer.</P>
