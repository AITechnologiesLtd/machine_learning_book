<P>INSPECTOR GADGET (PG).  
(Walt Disney Pictures/Buena Vista International)
Director: David Kellogg
Stars: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Michelle 
Trachtenberg, Dabney Coleman, Rene Auberjonois, Michael G Hagerty,
voice of Don Adams.</P>
<P>This pedestrian and largely unfunny adaptation of the popular
children's cartoon series joins those other woefully miscast,
misguided live action adaptations of animated series (The Flintstones,
Mr Magoo) in the cinematic wasteland.</P>
<P>A strangely uncharismatic Matthew Broderick (remember his
glory days as Ferris Bueller?)  steps into the shoes of the robotic
sleuth with more gadgets than a hardware store, but he is clearly out
of his depth.  Broderick plays John Brown, a security guard who dreams
of becoming a police officer in Riverton.  His wish comes true in a
most unexpected way after he is severely injured while attempting to
stop a break in at the laboratory where he works.  Brown becomes the
guinea pig in a revolutionary experiment conducted by the beautiful
scientist Brenda Bradford (Joely Fisher) aimed at creating a robotic
cop.  He ends up looking like a cross between the Six Million Dollar
Man and Robocop, without the inventive genius of either!</P>
<P>Gadget's first case involves trying to solve the murder of
Brenda's father, which brings him up against the villainous
industrialist Claw (Rupert Everett, in a complete contrast to his
recent role in An Ideal Husband, etc), who creates an evil version of
Inspector Gadget and sets about creating havoc in the city.  The less
than cluey Inspector Gadget gets plenty of help from his inquisitive
and intelligent niece Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg, from Harriet The
Spy) and her dog Brains.</P>
<P>David Kellogg's direction is ham fisted and unsubtle, and the
film has plenty of flat moments, especially for older audiences or
those who fondly remember the '80's cartoon with some affection.  The
special effects are occasionally quite good, but more often than not
they are distinctly second rate and unconvincing.</P>
<P>The performances are suitably camp and unconvincing.  Everett
hams it up nicely as the arch villain of the piece, and almost steals
the movie.  Some of the film's best lines belong to the gadgetmobile,
the wise cracking, talking car with attitude, whose antics will
probably delight younger audiences.  Don Adams, who provided the voice
of Gadget in the original series, gets a brief cameo here providing
the voice of Brains, the dog, in some nonsense during the final
credits.</P>
<P>Admittedly, Inspector Gadget is comic book stuff, but still
some effort should have been made to accommodate those audiences older
than eight years old who will inevitably be dragged into the cinemas.
The biggest problem lies with the uneven script, which can't seem to
make up its mind whether it should be over the top comic book fantasy
or not.  There are a few clever in-jokes throughout the film (such as
the Godzilla send up) that provide a few chuckles.  Unfortunately, the
best and most inspired moments come too late, during the final
credits.</P>
<P>Sadly this disappointing film is a case of no go gadget!</P>
