<P>Because of last year's horrendous, excruciating "The Rugrats Movie," one 
honestly could only expect the worst from this recent animated feature 
film adaptation of the popular children's show, "Doug's 1st Movie." As 
the film played itself out, I noticed one vital difference between the 
two: while "Rugrats" was one of the most boring, junky family films to 
come along in some time, I couldn't help but be swept up in the spell 
that "Doug's 1st Movie" put me under, which was one of great, unexpected 
sweetness. Though I have never seen the television series, I now have a 
reason to actually give it a chance, where it airs on Nickelodeon.</P>
<P>Doug Funnie (vioced by Thomas McHugh) is an average 12-year-old living 
in the small, generally peaceful town of Bluffington, with all of the 
usual ordeals of any pre-teen, as he must constantly fight not only for 
respect from some of the older, more popular kids in his school, but for 
the girl of his heart, Patti Mayonnaise (Constance Shulman), whom he 
wants to ask out to the Valentine's Day Dance. At the same time, Doug, 
along with his friend, Skeeter (Fred Newman), have a chance encounter 
with the legendary monster of the local Lucky Duck Lake, and is 
surprised to find that the creature, named Herman Melville after his 
favorite book, "Moby Dick," is actually friendly, and trying to gain 
solace from the severely polluted lake, due to the company, Bluffco, 
releasing harmful chemicals into the waters. When Doug is encouraged to 
keep the monster a secret so as to protect him from the community, this 
poses a problem with Patti, since she mistakenly believes he is lying to 
her, and starts to hang around with the Doug's bullish nemesis, Guy (Guy 
Hadley).</P>
<P>To be clear about things, "Doug's 1st Movie" is only the second animated 
feature in the last sixteen months that I have enjoyed, the other being 
the spectacular, far superior "The Prince of Egypt." "Doug" is certainly 
more minor and slight fare than "The Prince of Egypt," but that isn't a 
bad thing, as I was pleasantly proven wrong about my low expectations. 
The characters in "Doug's 1st Movie" were all likable and well-written, 
and the complicated relationship between Doug and Patti was genuine and 
far more involving than what is usually seen in a film aimed at the 
young kiddie market. Although this aspect of the story was definately 
the strongest element, the main plot involving the kind-hearted 
creature, a la "E.T.," was also pleasant enough.</P>
<P>The merits of the animation could be debated, but I thought, for this 
film, at least, it worked. The colors were always vibrant and bright, 
and although the drawings were simple, they were also visually 
stimulating, something the recent dreary animated film, "The King and 
I," cannot attest to. Another interesting thing to note is that there 
are several overshot views of the whole town of Bluffington, including a 
shot of a map, and in the film, the locations were actually explored and 
accurate in their placement that we had previously seen them in. 
Bluffington, believe it or not, is a town I'd actually like to visit, if 
it actually existed.</P>
<P>Not only is "Doug's 1st Movie" more mature in its treatment of a 
children's pic (thankfully, there are no potty jokes in sight), but it 
also included an often sly screenplay, as well as some in-jokes that 
only adults might "get." For example, when discussing the town while 
looking at the map, Doug mentions that right behind Lucky Duck Lake is 
Crystal Lake (a reference to the slasher series, "Friday the 13th"). </P>
<P>While watching the movie, I was also taken aback at how effective the 
voiceovers were, especially Constance Shulman, as Patti Mayonnaise, a 
fetching young girl with a delightful southern accent. Adding several 
laughs was Beebe (voiced by Alice Playten), a wealthy, spoiled friend of 
Doug's who is always commanding her father and servants to do anything 
she asks.</P>
<P>At a scant 78 minutes, "Doug's 1st Movie" is short and entertaining 
enough to never overstay its welcome, and I was in constant enjoyment as 
I watched it. After the end credits appeared, the earth didn't shake, 
but I was in a slight state of shock at how much I really did like it, 
with the wonderful last scene, set on the dock of the lake between Doug 
and Patti, only confirming my enthusiasm. Released by Walt Disney 
Pictures, "Doug's 1st Movie" is one of their lesser efforts in terms of 
how high its profile is, but is actually their best film since 1996's 
"The Hunchback of Notre Dame," which only proves that flashy, stylish 
animation isn't the only key to a successful film: you also need to have 
a diverting, original story and characters you care about. You do not, 
however, need a non-stop string of elaborate, corny musical numbers.</P>
