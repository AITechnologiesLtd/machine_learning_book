<PRE>                           EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     You say you got hungry at BABETTE'S FEAST?  Your mouth watered at
LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE?  Then you are in for another feast treat with
this Taiwan film by the same director who gave you the hilarious THE
WEDDING BANQUET.</P>
<P>     Mr. Chu (Sihung Lung), Taiwan's greatest chef, will make your
mouth water as you see him prepare the food in a large restaurant with
dozens of helpers scurrying all around.  Listen to the pots sizzle as
he drops in his scrumptious delicacies and makes his wondrous dishes.
Get ready to watch a master chef prepare great Chinese food and be
prepared to get hungry immediately.</P>
<P>     Ah, but Mr. Chu, a widower, despite his being a food wizard, finds
he is having trouble at home managing his three pretty daughters,
Jia-Chien, a self-sufficient airline executive; Jia-Jen, a high school
teacher who may never find the right man; and Jia-Ning, the youngest of
the three and a confirmed romantic.  As if he needed more problems, Mr.
Chu is losing his taste buds; a deaf Beethoven.</P>
<P>     Sunday family dinner is a ritual to keep the family together but a
small torture for the daughters who would rather be elsewhere.</P>
<P>     One of the funniest and endearing scenes in the film is that
involving the lunch brought by Mr. Chu to a friend's daughter at
school.  You will "eat it up."</P>
<P>     Then there is the widow, Ms. Liang (Ah-Leh Gua) who has returned
from America and who has her eye out for Mr. Chu while she checks out
her newly divorced daughter, Jin-Rong (Sylvia Chang).</P>
<P>     Throw all that into the pot and let Director Ang Lee stir things
up and you come up with the most delicious foreign film of the year.
For good measure there is a delightful surprise.</P>
<P>     Finally, about the title.  EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN.  That is what
people need to survive: food and sex.  Need we say more?</P>
