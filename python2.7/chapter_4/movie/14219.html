<P>                                SIMON BIRCH
                         Reviewed by Dennis Lewis
     If you had to dab away a few tears at the conclusion of "Titanic,"
you may want to take along a full box of Puffs if you go see "Simon Birch."
     "Simon Birch," which opens nationwide on Sept. 11, is a movie that can
bring a smile to the face of the most jaded viewer -- or tears to the eyes
of the most cynical.
     Simon, the title character, is an exceptionally compact individual.
At birth he was "no bigger than a baby bird," according to the movie
synopsis, and he remains unusually small as he approaches adolescence.
     Simon's best friend, Joe, is a tall, athletic teenager from one of the
wealthier families in the Maine village in which he and Simon live. Yet Joe
feels like an outsider among the other teenagers in his community because
his mother Rebecca bore him out of wedlock (and has never married).
     The two "outsiders" -- Joe, the "town bastard," and the diminutive
Simon -- form a bond that, as it turns out, has enough strength to
withstand the most serious strain.
     Simon has a belief that God made him small for a reason, to fulfill a
special mission.
     One of the movie's key themes concerns Simon's quest for his "special
purpose" in life. The other deals with Joe's search for clues to the
identity of his father, who he believes still resides in their village.
     Joe is played by Joseph Mazzello, whose previous credits include both
"Jurassic Park" and its sequel, "The Lost World."
     Mazzello manages to infuse his character with the blend of maturity and
youthful innocence necessary to generate audience interest in his quest to
identify his father.
     Ian Michael Smith brings a self-reliance to the character of Simon. As
we watch him on the screen, we're not thinking "poor Simon" because of his
physical limitations; rather, we're cheering his pugnacious approach to
life.
     David Straithairn (most recently of "L.A. Confidential") plays the
Rev. Russell, rector of the local Episcopal church, the congregation
attended by Joe's family and Simon. Straithairn's cleric isn't the
charismatic spiritual leader we're used to seeing on screen. Repeatedly we
sense that Russell is trying, but failing, to connect with his
parishioners.
     (Simon Birch is a reunion of sorts for Straithairn and Mazzello -- the
two played father and son in 1994's "The River Wild.")
     Saturday Night Live veteran Jan Hooks, who did a "church lady"-type
character on Ted Turner's TBS Superstation at the beginning of her career
in the early 1980s, is divine in her role as teacher of Joe and Simon's
Sunday School class. Hooks plays her character as a frustrated woman who
possesses a lot of insecurity and just a dash of menace.
     The main cast is rounded out by Ashley Judd, who plays Joe's mother
Rebecca with an endearing charm that never ventures into the saccharin, and
Oliver Pratt as Ben Goodrich, Rebecca's beau, a drama teacher who has a
remarkable knack for child psychology.
     Simon Birch originally began as a project to adapt John Irving's novel
"A Prayer for Owen Meany" to the screen. The resulting script diverted from
the novel to such a degree that Irving requested the film have a different
name.
     One title considered for the film was "Angels and Armadillos," a quirky
name but one with a significance evident to those who've seen the movie.
     Jim Carrey has a cameo in the bookend scenes that frame the movie.
But this isn't a Jim Carrey movie or a "big name" movie; it's a film that
relies on acting and script quality, rather than star power, to attract an
audience.
     If any film this year merits at least one Oscar nomination, it's
"Simon Birch."<HR>                                SIMON BIRCH
              "Destiny has big plans for little Simon Birch."
               A Hollywood Pictures/Caravan Pictures Release
                       Opens nationwide on Sept. 11.
                                 Rated PG
