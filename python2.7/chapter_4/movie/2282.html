<PRE>                              PHILADELPHIA
                       A film review by Greg Bole
                        Copyright 1993 Greg Bole</PRE>
<P>     Wow, what an experience.  Tonight I got to see what I suppose
could be considered the world premiere of PHILADELPHIA, the new
courtroom drama about AIDS by Jonathan Demme.  The official premiere of
the film will be in a week or two (also in this city) but there was a
special free sneak-preview of the movie at the International House on
the campus of the University of Pennsylvania.  The place was *packed*,
people were sitting on the floor about four rows deep in front of the
first row of seats.  It was a thrill to watch the opening of the film,
which consists of shots of this city, and listen to the wild applause.
Plus of course everyone went nuts whenever Penn was mentioned (Tom
Hanks plays a gay lawyer who graduated from Penn's law school and is
dying of AIDS) and when shots near the campus were shown (there is a
very important scene supposedly in a law library that was filmed in
Furness, our library of Fine Arts ... I may have messed up the spelling,
I've never been in there, but it looked great).</P>
<P>     Okay, enough about that, let's get to the movie itself.  It was
very powerful.  It was the first movie that brought tears to my eyes in
a long time.  (I haven't seen THE JOY LUCK CLUB or SCHINDLER'S LIST yet
however) It really was a very fine film.  Most of it centered around
the actual trial (Tom Hanks' character hires Denzel Washington's to sue
his law firm firm when they fire him for having AIDS).  There are also
quite a few scenes documenting Hanks' experiences before and after his
being fired, and some excellent scenes showing more about Washington's
homophobic character.</P>
<P>     The movie isn't strictly about AIDS or about the fact the main
character is gay, but does focus on what these things mean to him and
his family, partner, and friends.  There are problems with the film; I
think Demme went a bit overboard here and there, one scene in
particular turned me off because of its heavy-handed approach, but over
all the movie was excellent.</P>
<P>     The performances were top-notch, Hanks was absolutely incredible
in the main role, Washington was excellent, but his character could
have used a bit more investigation.  Jason Robards did a fine job as
the head of the law firm who took Hanks in, then completely turned his
back on him.  I thought too many of the "negative" characters were
drawn a little strongly negative, but Demme certainly wanted to bring
out all the elements of society's feelings towards gays, especially
those who are HIV-infected.</P>
<P>     The movie really makes you think, and feel, and puts you into the
middle of what I feel is a very important topic.  I give it my full
recommendation.  (Also go to see some beautiful shots of my home city,
one I really feel will benefit from the exposure)  It really makes one
appreciate life and those you care about.  (A big hug to the one I
really care about.)  Go see it and enjoy.</P>
