<P>Gary Burns (Kitchen Party) may not be trying to establish himself as the
Canadian Kevin Smith, but his quirky humor, fast-paced dialogue and
dirt-cheap production values can't help but make me think of Silent Bob's
alter-ego.  His latest is a terrific blend of Office Space and the legendary
Seinfeld episode known as "The Contest" (it's the one with the bet to see
who can hold out the longest).</P>
<P>The competition in waydowntown involves four Calgary office drones who each
kick one month's salary into a kitty that will be claimed by the person who
can go the longest without venturing outside.  Like many large cities,
Calgary is full of underground tunnels and gerbilesque tubes that connect
residential apartments, office buildings and retail shops, so a person can
literally never go outside...unless, of course, they want to experience
things like fresh air, puppy-dog breath and whatever else happens up there
in Canada.</P>
<P>We're introduced to the game on Day 24, and each of the four contestants are
slowly going insane from the mind games they're playing with each other.
Sandra (Marya Delver) is convinced the recycled air is poisoning her and
thinks sniffing perfume ads from magazines is the key to keeping her lungs
all spiffy and clean.  Smarmy Curt's (Gordon Currie) fiancée won't have sex
with him until they're married, so he targets a vulnerable co-worker
(Jennifer Clement) to get some sweet release.  Randy (Tobias Godson) keeps
tabs on his competitors by befriending a nerdy security guard (James
McBurney), allowing him to watch surveillance cameras like he was Big
Brother, and the brooding Tom (Fab Filippo) becomes infatuated with a
superhero and his suicidal cubical-mate, played by the hysterical Don
McKellar (eXistenZ).</P>
<P>The rest of the plot revolves around a party being thrown in honor of the
company's decrepit founder, who turns out have some pretty serious social
flaws of his own.  waydowntown is narrated by Tom, who keeps an ant farm on
his desk (a not-so-subtle reference to people spending their lives trapped
in a big, glass structure).  Burns shot the film with a digital camera and
blew the finished product up to 35mm for use in theatres.  The result is a
dark, grainy, colorful mess, but there's no denying that Burns is a
filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him.</P>
<P>1:27 - R for language, drug use and some sexuality</P>
