<P>Note: Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers.
      Be forewarned. </P>
<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   At the end of the day, those reflecting upon the debacle that is THE
   AVENGERS would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on
   the horizon for the project well before Warner Bros. made the
   contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped
   plans for a gala premiere.  This highly-anticipated film rendition
   of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early June
   opening, where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival
   studios' heavy hitters; its eventual demotion to a less potent
   mid-August opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's
   lack of confidence with the picture.</P>
<P>   And with good reason.  This is a joyless exercise of a film, held
   together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of
   excitement, thrills or wit.  Remarkable in its banality and brutally
   uninvolving, THE AVENGERS is a catastrophic mess which immediately
   invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over
   substance, Joel Schumacher's much-loathed BATMAN & ROBIN.  (Indeed,
   both films even feature appalling, ridiculous sequences which find
   central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes.)</P>
<P>   Uma Thurman, who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad,
   karate-chopping Emma Peel immortalized by Diana Rigg, was the only
   bright spot in the aforementioned Schumacher disaster, imbuing her
   Poison Ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences
   something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage.  Unfortunately,
   the same can't be said here, where she and cohort Ralph Fiennes (our
   new John Steed, taking over for Patrick Macnee) demonstrate no
   appreciable chemistry whatsoever, fatally crippling the picture as
   they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade
   double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully
   aware that they're on board a sinking ship.  At this rate,
   usually-splendid actor Mr. Fiennes may never make the transition from
   Arthouse Apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will
   make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the
   regrettably-neglected Kathyrn Bigelow film STRANGE DAYS.</P>
<P>   The duo *look* the part -- and admittedly THE AVENGERS is, more than
   most, heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch,
   and I found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the
   lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they
   navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot.  When not checking
   my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat, I began to alleviate
   the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the
   filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile EMMA as our Mrs.
   Peel -- no, not Kate Beckinsale (although the notion now intrigues
   me), but Gwyneth Paltrow, who was originally in the running for the
   part and can veritably handle a spot-on English accent.  If nothing
   else, it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight
   of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt.</P>
<P>   The story, such as it is, involves the ever-bemused tandem of Steed
   and Peel combating the malevolent Sir August de Wynter (Sean
   Connery), an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the
   nation with his climate-controlling contraption.  (They also sip a
   lot of tea.)  Overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky
   hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors, it sounds far better
   than it plays, and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant
   post-production tinkering; it's clearly evident that the picture has
   been cut to shreds.  THE AVENGERS was never about gripping drama, and
   our heroes accordingly never take villainous Sir August very
   seriously, but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of
   menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac, it's all decidedly
   uncompelling.  Mr. Connery, who's onscreen barely long enough to
   register an impression, approaches the role like a man fulfilling a
   contractual obligation, simultaneously chewing the scenery while
   unable to hide his disinterest.</P>
<P>   At least it all looks good.  This is a genuinely handsome production,
   with fine costume design by Anthony Powell and crisply shot by Roger
   Pratt.  In particular, the gleaming production design by Stuart Craig
   commands attention, adeptly drawing elements both old and new in
   order to depict this Great Britain.  There are a handful of striking
   visual moments in the film, including an attack by a swarm of giant
   robotic bees and a nice shot of Steed and Peel finding a way to walk
   on water, but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these
   instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates.  By the time
   the film's climax had arrived, my interest was not with the sight of
   Steed and Sir August slugging it out amidst crashing waves and
   thundering rain, but with the quickest escape route from the theatre.</P>
<P>   Not coincidentally, the enticing bits of visual bravura were the
   shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer, a savvy piece of
   work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature
   film itself; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is
   probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year.  It's
   everything that THE AVENGERS is not -- saucy, clever, engaging, and
   entertaining.  A crushing disappointment, the film is one of the
   worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as
   gleefully bad, too polished to overlook its deficiencies.  There may
   be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than THE AVENGERS,
   but I sure hope not.</P>

"...a first screenplay unaccompanied by a powerful agent or industry
 sponsor is generally a pathetic fetus of a film, nothing more."
