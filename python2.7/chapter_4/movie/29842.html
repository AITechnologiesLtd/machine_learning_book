<P>`Vengo' is a concert movie from which a vendetta plot keeps trying to break
out.  When it faces the music, it dances.  When it wanders into plot, it gets
hopelessly lost.</P>
<P>It's not that the plot is so complex.  You've got two clans of Spanish
gypsies who keep killing each other; and forgive and forget are not words that
you'll find in your English-to-Gypsy dictionary.   Caco (Antonio Canales) is the
head of one clan, and the rival Caravaca family wants the blood of his brother
for having killed one of theirs.  The brother is hiding out in Algiers, so
they're willing to settle for his son Diego (Orestes Villasan Rodriguez).  It
appears the Caravaca clan may have killed Caco's beloved daughter.  She's dead,
anyway, and Caco makes many grieving visits to her grave.  Caco realizes the
futility of this never-ending cycle of retribution, and wants to find a way to
end it; but the Caravacas are implacably bent on revenge.  </P>
<P>Caco's nephew Diego, on whom he dotes,  has something that could be
cerebral palsy.  It causes him to lurch when he walks and contort his mouth when
he talks, but he does not seem to be mentally handicapped – the things he says
makes sense, and would fit perfectly well into the mouth of an ordinary
sensitive young man.  Rodriguez plays him with energy, but I never had any
trouble believing that it was an actor putting on the trappings of affliction. 
Canales, who is a celebrated flamenco dancer in Spain, drags around as Caco with
the weight of the world on his shoulders, and doesn't get to do a lick of
dancing, which is like casting Elvis in a musical in a non-singing role.  It can
be done, but what's the point?  Canales is an arresting-looking man, but you're
more aware of what he's not doing than what he is, and you keep waiting for that
flamenco boot to drop.</P>
<P>Aside from Caco and Diego, it's pretty hard to figure out who anybody is in
this vast and wild assortment of darkly-dressed gypsy clansmen, and harder still
to care.  What we do care about is the music.  Director Tony Gatlif ("Latcho
Drom", "Gadjo Dilo") has enlisted the talents of some of the great contemporary
flamenco artists: Tomatito, Sheikh Ahmad al Tuni, La Caita, Gritos de Guerra,
and La Paquera de Jerez.  If he doesn't have much of a feel for story, he does
have a gut sense of what the music is about, and the alertness to step aside and
let it rip.  Sitting around in bars singing, breaking into dance on a flatbed
truck, the musicians seem to live the music which springs spontaneously out of 
centuries of intense feeling – rage, laughter, passion, cruelty, anguish, love,
and death. It's raw, it's transfixing, and it feels completely authentic, a
music not shaped for the cabaret or the concert hall, but protected and
preserved for the cathartic release of the people who make it.  With his bona
fides in the gypsy world, Gatlif has been able to persuade some of these
reclusive and limelight-shunning artists to venture out into the glare of lights
and camera, and has caught something remarkable on film.</P>
<P>The movie looks good.  Gatlif and cinematographer Thierry Pouget set a
handsome screen, with barren desert vistas of Andalusia, and dark, shadowy night
clubs and back alleys of Seville.  The uninspired storytelling and hackneyed
plot don't really matter so much, except that they take up our time and tax our
attention.  The story came to him, Gatlif says, after a night of tossing and
turning: `I slept little, and in the morning, everything was clear…I knew that
vengeance was what the film was about.'</P>
<P>He's got a great handle on the music.  Maybe next time, with a bit more
sleep, he'll get the rest of it worked out.</P>
