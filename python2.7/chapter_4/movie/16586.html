<PRE>`She's All That' – Mildly Cute, But It Ain't All That
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>As Valentine Day approaches, it'll be natural for all of us to start
considering what movies we might want to see that will make us feel
good, feel happy, and of course feel a bit more romantic.  And for the
teenybopper set, this film does manage to accomplish its goals of
delivering a cute, albeit goofy, romantic comedy.</P>
<P>In `She's All That', we meet up with Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr.) an
admired student whom everyone else wants to emulate.   Good-looking,
loaded with charisma, and an all-around athlete, he has a good future
ahead of him.  But his popularity and perceived greatness may be in
jeopardy when his airy but sexpot of a girlfriend, Taylor (Jodi Lyn
O'Keefe), leaves him for another guy.  So, like all self-deluded, high
school seniors who believe that they are irresistible, he starts
bragging to his friends that he can have any girl in the school. 
Moreover, with a little guidance on his part, he can turn that girl
into the next prom queen.  Of course, this line of talking eventually
evolves into a wager.  And the one that has been chosen for Zach's
challenge is Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook), a bespectacled, mousy
art student whose oeuvre of work seems to represent only despair and
hatred.  `No way,' says Zach.  `She's scary and inaccessible.'  But at
the expense of suffering another setback to his ego, he begins the
process of turning the mouse into a queen.</P>
<P>The transformation process offers no surprises.  She's wary at first
but is curious as to why he's paying so much attention to her.  And
once she takes off those thick-rimmed Lisa Loeb-like glasses, gets a
new makeover and haircut, and develops an ounce of confidence, she is
actually very attractive.  Zach eventually sees something in her that
he's never noticed before, and she feels a never-before-felt sense of
attachment.  But whether they eventually wind up with each other or
not isn't as interesting as the peripheral elements of the movie.  </P>
<P>This film adds some very funny moments about high school life.  There
are the well-defined cliques such as the one whose most vital items
are lipstick and beepers.  There's the prom queen race between Laney,
who relies on the old-fashioned method of posters versus the filthy
rich Taylor, who gives away free samples of Latte.  The high school
seems located in a wealthy enclave of California.  I found it amusing
seeing how all of the students drove exotic cars and had parties in
houses that could hold 500 people.  And watching the climactic prom
scene, I couldn't help but grin as all of the students (who all look
like they're at least 23) broke out into a choreographed dance number.
 It certainly put my high school prom to shame.  Yet despite these
goofy moments, `She's All That' is a very, very lightweight movie. 
Zach was just too nice for us to doubt that there would ever be a
problem breaking into Laney's world.  And as we moved closer to the
prom queen elections, it seemed that there should have been more
showdowns between Laney and the bitchy Taylor.  But I guess as
February 14th approaches, no one really wants confrontation.</P>
