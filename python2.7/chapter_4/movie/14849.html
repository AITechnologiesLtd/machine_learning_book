<P>Plot: In the afterlife a group of workers deal with an assortment of 
newly arrived dead. Each of the new arrivals has one week in which to 
select their single favourite memory so that the afterlife workers might 
reconstruct and then videotape it and the arrivals can then pass on and 
inhabit that memory. But many of the arrivals have some difficulty 
choosing a memory.</P>
<P>This marvellous little Japanese film has a quiet effectiveness that kind 
of creeps up on you afterwards. The whole film comes with a sublime 
simplicity to it. It's vision of the afterlife is conducted with a 
wonderful minimalism - this entire afterlife takes place not in Grecian 
palaces in the sky or even the grandiose visions of classical artwork 
come to three-dimensional life as in the recent ‘What Dreams May Come', 
but rather in what looks like a disused schoolhouse. There is almost 
nothing to the film other than a series of vignettes with various people 
standing about being interviewed - and almost despite which, the film 
manages to be an absolute delight.</P>
<P>The interview scenes are conducted with an endearing sense of humour - 
the old lady who says nothing and simply looks out the window, the 
teenage girl who wants her trip to Disneyland recreated, the young punk 
who immediately announces he is refusing to choose anything. Director 
Hirokazu has a genuine affection for the banality and foibles of the 
people's lives and the film manages to paint each of its subjects with 
considerable amusement yet also a quiet dignity.</P>
<P>Unlike ‘What Dreams May Come', ‘After Life' makes no pretense to any 
profound insights into the afterlife or human spiritual condition. But 
the two films, each in their own way, both manage to offer unique and 
thoughtful humanist revisions of classical afterlife imagery . Although 
quite the opposite of ‘What Dreams', ‘After Life'‘s  vision of the 
hereafter comes with an enchanting banality, one where the afterlife 
volunteers have as many clues as to why they are as anybody else does. 
The latter quarter of the film is highly amusing when it comes to the 
recreation of each person's memory and in the sheer mundanity of the 
afterlife volunteers' attempts to get the details right - not having the 
right plane for one memory scenario and having to saw the wing off the 
plane they do have and then send pieces of cotton wool past on wires to 
represent clouds; or a tram scenario being revealed as a mockup being 
rocked by two of the volunteers. Quite a charming film.</P>
