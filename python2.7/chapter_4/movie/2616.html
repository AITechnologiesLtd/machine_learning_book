<PRE>"This is the wrong bus."
                - unnamed passenger on bus.</PRE>
<P>     Can you really take "too far" too far?  The producers of SPEED
don't think so.</P>
<P>     Audacious action doesn't get any better than SPEED, a non-stop
nail-biter about a SWAT-team specialist (Reeves), a brilliant bomber
(Hopper), and a bus rigged to blow when it slows below 50.  Cross DIE
HARD with AIRPORT and you're got the idea.</P>
<P>     SPEED stars Keanu Reeves, trying to look tough after his recent
upgrade from Most Excellent to Most Enlightened.  The dude can't do
drama, no duh, but he's nimble enough for the job. (From BUDDHA to
Bruce and he even does his own stunts!)  Bullock is a better bet as the
poor passenger with driving duties.  She showed her strength in
DEMOLITION MAN and, here, she's the best bargain on board.</P>
<P>     Dennis Hopper plays Dennis Hopper, chewing on scenery while
spitting out sentences like "Do not attempt to grow a brain." (Good
advice if there ever *was* any.)  Bill Pullman-lookalike Jeff Daniels
has a modestly meaty role as The Partner, while TERMINATOR 2 alumni Joe
Morton plays the commanding officer.</P>
<P>     The script, by Graham Yost, has enough humor to keep you smiling
while you're sweating.  Even better: the story never turns Reeves into
a wisecracking hero.  Thank you for small favors.</P>
<P>     Of course, the best bursts of SPEED are those without words.</P>
<P>     First-time director Jan DeBont--a former cinematographer who
handled such heavies as LETHAL WEAPON 3--gets everything right, from
the credits to the close.  And those details! Watch for the reflection
of a burning bus on a pay phone.  Or a banner beside Reeves that reads
"To avoid personal injury, do not stand in stepwell."</P>
<P>     As the stunts get bigger, the film only gets better.  Collisions,
explosions, and big-things-sent-flying.  Even the throwaway stunts are
spectacular.  Blink and someone's stepping from a speeding vehicle.
Blink and someone's dangling from an elevator car.</P>
<PRE>     Implausible-as-hell, but it works.</PRE>
<P>     Credit a pace that keeps you from thinking; credit some stunts
that just can't be faked.  Let ILM just *try* to duplicate the
simplicity of Reeves really jumping from car onto a moving bus.</P>
<P>     (If nothing else, SPEED is a *great* exercise in wish
fulfillment.  Who *hasn't* wished that they could barrel a bus around
slow drivers and through busy intersections?)</P>
<P>     SPEED could be reduced.  Earlier scenes run a bit too long and the
ending is clearly too much.  But, that's the joke.  The producers know
that *everything* in the film is too much and so they damn the torpedos
and take over-the-top right over-the-top.</P>
<P>     Nitpickers can enjoy the plot-holes, while the more, ahem,
"retentive" viewers will have a field day finding the continuity errors
that occur in nearly every scene.</P>
<P>     Except for the ending, all technical credits are tops.  Obvious
minatures and mangy mattes undercut the film's next-to-last scene.
But, by that point, who cares?  SPEED is a full-scale tinkertoy set
that makes the beginning of THE FUGITIVE look like a little Lionel
train.</P>
<P>     Twenty years ago, SPEED would've starred Charleton Heston, and
Karen Black, and George Kennedy.  No guns would've been needed--but a
plane would crash, and a nun would sing, and the girl would get kissed
at the end.</P>
<P>     But this is the Nineties and, with DIE HARD dollars still fresh on
the brain, set-piece *is* plot.  Add some fireworks, and blow a few
bombs, and it's Jennings Lang all over again.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  The best ride of the summer, so far, is SPEED.  Fast,
              funny, and furiously far-fetched, this ballsey no-brainer
              is the best reason, to date, to avoid public
              transportation.  Bring extra deodorant.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: A-</PRE>
