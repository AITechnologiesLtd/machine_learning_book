<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A rather mild comedy/mystery, filmed in B&W, featuring the bumbling
comic antics of Jack Lemon and the ravishing beauty of Kim Novak. Under
Richard Quine's laborious direction, the film plods along until it perks
up for its surprising ending, which is a takeoff on those slapstick
silent comedies. The film failed to catch my interest even though the
actors seemed to be giving an all out effort to make this turkey have
legs. The main problem lies in the ridiculous script. Poor Fred Astaire
comes off the worst of all the actors, he's stuck as a fawning American
embassy chief, afraid a scandal would ruin his career. His part was so
wooden, you could have thrown it into the fireplace for kindling wood.</P>
<P>After William Gridley (Jack Lemmon) lands in London as a low level
American diplomat, he rents a flat in the exclusive Grey Square section
from fellow American Carlye Hardwicke (Kim Novak). What he doesn't know,
is that six months earlier she was suspected of killing her husband, but
since there was no body found, Scotland Yard has not charged her with
the crime but are keeping her under close observation.</P>
<P>Gridley finds this out from his boss Franklyn Ambruster (Astaire), who
arranges with Inspector Oliphant (Lionel) for him to cooperate with
Scotland Yard and act as an undercover agent. The conflict for Gridley
is that he fell in love with her and only wants to snoop on her if he
can prove her innocence.</P>
<P>The hilarious moments come, as Lemon bumbles around while courting the
mysterious Kim. There are a few frantic ha-ha's here, as he nearly burns
her flat down while lighting the outdoor grill, which gives him the
publicity in the newspapers his boss said would remove him from serving
in England, an assignment he covets since coming from Saudi Arabia. The
mystery develops as we try to figure out what Kim is doing by pawning
her expensive candelabra.</P>
<P>Spoiler to follow in the next paragraph.</P>
<P>It all comes clear when her husband turns up alive and she shoots him
accidently as he tries to kill her for the pawn ticket, as they wrestle
for the gun. She is about to be convicted of the crime when a witness
Mrs. Brown suddenly appears and clears Kim of the murder. But it turns
out Mrs. Brown had an ulterior motive for doing so, she knows Kim's
hubby was a jewel thief and hid the jewels in the candelabra. Which
results in the slapstick climax, set in an old age resort by the sea.
The funniest moment is when the one who could truly clear Kim of any
crime, the wheelchair-bound Mrs. Dunhill, is being pushed down a cliff
by Mrs. Brown and Lemon is running after her to stop her fall.</P>
<P>Its offbeat comedy just didn't resonate with me. I found the production
too dry and hardly on par with those Buster Keaton vehicles it tried to
emulate and the mystery story was too lame-brain an effort to cause any
fuss over. This one's watchable only for those fans of Kim or Lemon. I
do not count myself as being one of those fans.</P>
