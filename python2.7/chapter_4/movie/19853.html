<PRE>IN TOO DEEP
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Like an actor who can't get out of character, rookie cop Jeffrey Cole
(Omar Epps) has gone so deep undercover in the projects that he has
trouble remembering where his allegiances lie.</P>
<P>Supposedly based on a true story, Michael Rymer's IN TOO DEEP tells a
conventional and predictable undercover story that requires frequent
suspension of disbelief.  After his first bust, Cole, for instance,
walks away so that everyone in the neighborhood can see he is a cop.
Normally, once your cover is blown, you give up the undercover life.
Not in this story.  And -- surprise! -- this mistake will come back to
haunt him.</P>
<P>As in the recent, abysmal DEEP BLUE SEA, the best thing about the movie
is LL Cool J, who gives humanity and a chilling reality to a role that
frequently is reduced to caricature.  Here he plays God, an aptly named
drug lord.  God, who controls eighty percent of the crack cocaine in the
city, loves to do things like throwing parties for his current and
potential customers.  He treats everyone in the ghetto to a Thanksgiving
Day feast.  He also likes to beat disrespectful employees to death,
using a pool cue to sexually abuse them first.</P>
<P>Michael Henry Brown and Paul Aaron's script wants to make the story into
a sentimental one, looking compassionately at the plight of the poor
undercover cop.  To foster this mood, Cole is sent for a long sabbatical
of sorts in the middle of his investigation.  Living in a pastoral
setting in a farmhouse, he spends his time taking a photography course
and photographing a lovely nude model, played by Nia Long from LOVE
JONES.  Of course, they will fall in love, and he will spill the beans
about his life as an undercover investigator of a big-time drug lord,
God.</P>
<P>BIG NIGHT's Stanley Tucci, plays Cole's sympathetic supervisor in the
police department.  Cole disobeys his direct orders and verbally abuses
him without any consequences other than the aforementioned free vacation
in the country.</P>
<P>The dialog can be unintelligible at times, and there are only a few
sympathetic characters in the story, yet the movie somehow manages to
rise slightly above the hackneyed storyline.  Still, there's little to
recommend the movie.  You've seen this story before.  And better.</P>
<P>IN TOO DEEP runs too long at 1:44.  It is rated R for strong, pervasive
violence, drug usage, sex and language and would be acceptable for
teenagers only if they are older and mature.</P>
