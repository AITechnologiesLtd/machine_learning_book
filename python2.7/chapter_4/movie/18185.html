<PRE>BLOWN AWAY (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in
Hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject, or, to
be precise, same "high concept". In Summer 1994, that "high
concept" was "mad bomber action thriller". In few weeks,
"thrillride of the summer" actionfest SPEED was followed by
rather action thriller BLOWN AWAY, so disappointing that
most of the people these days associate the title with the
1992 thriller in which Nicole Eggert did few nude scenes.</P>
<P>The movie begins in the prison in Northern Ireland, where
Gaerity (Tommy Lee Jones), IRA terrorist with the great
talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any
material, escapes from prison. He comes to Boston, where he
accidentally notices Jimmy Dove (Jeff Bridges), dedicated
bomb disposal expert within Boston police. Few people except
Gaerity know the Dove's violent past, when he used to be IRA
terrorist before becoming sick with violence, betraying
Gaerity and emigrating to America where he changed the name
and started using his experience for good purpose. Gaerity
holds Dove personally responsible for his captivity and
begins the campaign of bombing terror, directed specifically
at Dove's colleagues, friends and relatives. Dove, who is
just going to retire and start family, now must confront the
mad bomber.</P>
<P>While SPEED doesn't even try to bother with plot and
characters, using them only as an excuse for long and
spectacular action scenes, BLOWN AWAY tries to be more
conventional and provide the action with some back story.
And that is the main reason why it is inferior to SPEED.
Badly written plot and badly written characters are
sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all.
Screenplay by John Bateer and John Rice, barely touches the
complicated issues of Northern Ireland, using the tragedy
only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama. The plot
is, of course, full of implausibilities. The main one is the
fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual,
no matter how brilliant he is, can produce thousands of
deadly devices and hold entire city at bay. Those questions,
same as in the case of SPEED, could be forgotten while the
action goes on, but the pauses between action scenes are
filled with cliched and predictable situation that should
provide some background to the characters. Because of them,
movie seems a little bit too long, and boring at times. The
most annoying element of the film, however, is Tommy Lee
Jones in the role of mad bomber. His acting is so
over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into
pathetic caricature of himself. This role is in painful
contrast with the strong performance given by that same
actor in FUGITIVE. The film have few bright points, though.
Some of the action scenes are fine, which should be credited
to director Stephen Hopkins (PREDATOR II, JUDGEMENT NIGHT).
And Forrest Whitaker really shines in minor role of Dove's
colleague. But, all in all, BLOWN AWAY is a film that was
justifiably shadowed by its more famous, yet hardly
unforgettable competitor.</P>
