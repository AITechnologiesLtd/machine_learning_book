<P>   How strange that Halloween occurs each year during the
fall season when everyone knows that ghosts much prefer
the steamy summer nights for their hauntings.  Kids whose
parents need a rest are sent to camp in July where they sit
around the campfire on Sunday night listening to stories of
goblins and ghosts and monkeys' paws and witches.  If they
don't have their share of such tales, their counselors fill them
in on Tuesdays after the canteens are loaded and blankets
are drawn in the cool mountain air.  Those not fortunate
enough to be in the country or to be eight or nine years old
settle into the seats at the local megaplex, giving what little
imagination they have left in the TV age to the literalness of
the movie screen.  There the fanciful phantoms and spirited
scepters glide across huge Gothic estates or suburban ranch
homes, seen only by those of us still young enough to
possess inventive intuition.  In Jan De Bont's "The Haunting,"
nothing is left to the resourcefulness of our own minds as a
purgatory as literal as a medieval painting passes before our
eyes.  Apparitions of children drift across bedsheets while a
gruesome old man comes to life from a picture to continue
tormenting the wage slaves he drove to their deaths.  In
Myrick and Sanchez's "The Blair Witch Project," the special
f/x guy takes a break as three 20-somethings roam across a
sylvan expanse followed and presumably devoured by
invisible entities that no one ever sees.  M. Night Shyamalan
takes a middle ground in "The Sixth Sense," a story about an
eight-year-old lad with paranormal powers that seems to be
have been made not so much to scare the audience but to
provide a testing ground for Bruce Willis.  Will this actor,
already among the highest paid in history for his profession,
be able to parlay his against-type role as a passive,
shellshocked, reclusive Kentucky uncle in Norman Jewison's
"In Country" into yet a broader range of portrayals?  </P>
<P>   Unfortunately Willis--who enjoys a role as child
psychologist that could have been imbued with resonance
and even transcendence--confuses enervation with kindness
and understanding.  A lame, rambling script and weak
direction from M. Night Shayamalan--whose "Praying with
Anger" deals with a U.S. exchange student who returns to
India as a stranger in his own land--sucks the potential vigor
out of this film, giving it about the same makeup and density
as the sickly looking, watery glass of skim milk that makes its
gruesome appearance twice in the 114-minute tale.</P>
<P>   The one arresting concept in Shayamalan's screenplay is
the role reversal.  Recalling the notion, "physician, heal
thyself," what ultimately materializes from the long sessions
between psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and the
little guy who seems to be his sole patient, Cole Sear (Haley
Joel Osment) is a counter-transference.  As disturbed and
fearful as the psychic boy may be, the mature adult analyzing
him is plagued with guilt for ignoring his lovely wife Anna
(Olivia Williams), seemingly driving her into the arms of her
co-worker Sean (Glenn Fitzgerald).  At one point, he has
even forgotten his anniversary date with his wife in a plush
Italian restaurant: when he turns up, she has already finished
her dinner, signed the check, and leaves without speaking or
even looking at the poor man.</P>
<P>   Just as Willis's character, Uncle Emmett, has become a
passive loner in Norman Jewison's "In Country," in "The Sixth
Sense" his life takes a bad turn when he is shot in the
stomach by an intruder, Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg),
whom he recognizes as a patient he was unable to help. 
Though he has soon recovered from his wound, he is scarred
emotionally and determined to relieve his guilt by helping little
Cole.  Cole sees dead people everywhere, people he insists
do not even know that they're deceased.  In one case he
uses his psychic sixth sense to discover that a young girl,
Kyra (Mischa Barton), has been slowly poisoned by her
mother.  In another, he is riding in the family car with his
perpetually distracted mother, Lynn Sear (Toni Collette), and
informs her that a woman two blocks ahead has been killed
in an accident.  While his apparent powers frighten his
mother, who believes the kid simply has a vivid fantasy life,
they do not win him friends at school.  He drives his civics
teacher, Stanley Cunningham (Bruce Norris), off the wall by
reminding him openly that when Cunningham was a kid, he
was called "stuttering Stanley."  Nor can the teacher accept
Cole's knowledge of history when the boy insists that
centuries ago, the building in which the school is now housed
was the scene of a hanging.</P>
<P>   The movie springs to sudden life during its final fifteen
minutes, too late, of course, to redeem the screenplay which
plods along at a torpid pace as if Willis wants to show his
public that he can be more arty than he was in the "Die Hard"
series.  He does not play one of those non-directive
therapists who sit and say nothing for entire sessions, but in
fact conducts a great deal of amiable conversation with his
patient--becoming the only person the kid believes can help
him.  Despite this verbal activity, he appears to sleepwalk
through the role as he tries to reclaim the kid, as though a
low-key operation is coincident with serious acting. </P>
<P>   Haley Joel Osment, who has been a thesp since the age of
five, is unusually perceptive, pursuing his character with a
serious face and morbid demeanor throughout.  His
relationship with a mother who is so busy with her two jobs
that she absentmindedly tosses her dirty laundry over the
family Husky tugs at the heartstrings.  You feel for the boy
and mother who are trying every so much to connect, if only
little Cole can reveal to her a particular secret that no one
else grasps.  But the movie, devoid of terror, a palpable
sense of torment, and just plain energy, fizzles along,
becoming effervescent too little too late.</P>
<PRE>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 114 minutes.  (C) 1999
