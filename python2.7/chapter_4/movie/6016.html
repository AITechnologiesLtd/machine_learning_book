<P>     In many ways, it's hard to believe that the Allison Anders who 
burst onto the movie scene with GAS FOOD LODGING, a compelling and 
compassionate look at the trials of single motherhood, is the same woman 
who penned and directed GRACE OF MY HEART.  Don't misunderstand me -- 
GRACE isn't a bad movie, and its theme of female independence fits in 
with Anders' other work, but this film doesn't take any chances.  It's a 
safe, shallow motion picture that doesn't challenge the viewer.</P>
<P>     The film starts out pleasantly enough, introducing us to a young 
Edna Buxton (Illeana Douglas) circa 1958.  Living in a huge mansion just 
outside of Philadelphia, Edna isn't an ordinary young woman -- she's the 
sole heir to the Buxton Steel fortune.  But money and marriage aren't on 
Edna's mind.  She wants to sing professionally, much to her parents' 
dismay.  And, when she wins a singing contest where first prize is a 
recording contract, she's off to New York to forge her future. 
Unfortunately, the contract never materializes, and Edna's financial 
situation becomes so dire that she can't even afford a phone.</P>
<P>     Over the next eleven months, Edna's attempts to find work in the 
recording industry meet with failure.  "We already have someone like 
you" is the popular refrain of refusal until Joel Millner (John 
Turturro) hears one of her demos and falls in love -- not with her voice 
but with her songwriting talent.  He hires Edna, changes her name to 
Denise Waverly, and sets her up in a tiny office in the Brill Building, 
New York's sixties hit factory.</P>
<P>     For the rest of the movie, we watch as Edna struggles to launch her 
own singing career while continuing to turn out top-selling singles for 
others.  Her personal life is in turmoil.  She first becomes involved 
with a fellow songwriter, Howard Cazsatt (Eric Stoltz), whose child she 
bears.  Then she has a fling with a married man (Bruce Davison).  
Finally, she falls for Jay Phillips (Matt Dillon), a record producer and 
the lead singer of the Beach Boys-like Riptides.</P>
<P>     One of Anders' problems is that, in trying to span twelve years of 
pop music history and chronicle one woman's life over that period, she 
overextends her script.  Two hours isn't enough time to cover this much 
material, so Anders frequently takes the easy way out by skimming over 
important scenes and fast-forwarding at awkward moments.  By the time 
GRACE OF MY HEART was over, I felt like I'd watched a filmed version of 
the CLIFFNOTES edition rather than the real thing. </P>
<P>     The movie pays lip service to issues of discrimination (both sexual 
and racial) and female empowerment, but doesn't do much with either.  
They're background elements that are given cursory screen time only when 
they impact upon the main story.  Also, GRACE misses numerous 
opportunities to explore the main character's inner struggles.  For 
example, when Edna finally records her first single, "God Give Me 
Strength", we're privy to the recording sessions, but, when they're 
finished, we're perfunctorily told that the song fails and she marries 
her producer. We see a quick snapshot of the wedding photo and a press 
clipping.  By reducing this critical juncture in the main character's 
life to such cursory exposition, Anders leaves us feeling cheated.</P>
<P>     Then there's the final half-hour, which almost seems like it 
belongs in a different movie.  With the time period moving into the 
late-sixties and early-seventies, we bear witness to the psychedelic 
breakdown of Matt Dillon's character.  For more than twenty minutes, 
GRACE's focus shifts from Edna and her music to Jay's deteriorating 
condition.  This prolonged  sequence of events is disruptive to the 
overall tone.</P>
<P>     Actors are GRACE's most obvious strength.  Illeana Douglas (CAPE 
FEAR, TO DIE FOR) is charming and likable in her first lead role.  I've 
always thought of her as a capable performer, and she reinforces that 
belief here.  John Turturro is excellent, stealing scenes left and right 
as Edna's boss (I'm not sure if it's Turturro's acting or his bizarre 
choice of wigs that captures our attention most forcefully).  The 
supporting players are all solid:  Eric Stoltz, Bruce Davison, and Matt 
Dillon as the three men in Edna's life; Patsy Kensit as her rival-
songwriter-turned friend; and Jennifer Leigh Warren as the Diana Ross-
clone who hits it big with a song written by "Denise Waverly."</P>
<P>    GRACE OF MY HEART's songs are, without a doubt, the film's 
highlight.  Penned by the likes of Elvis Costello, Burt Bachrach, and 
Larry Klein, they effectively recapture the sounds of the sixties.  The 
soundtrack will probably sell, regardless of how the film does at the 
box office.  However, while Allison Anders has certainly made a comeback 
from her horrific FOUR ROOMS episode, her return isn't complete.  GRACE 
OF MY HEART possesses certain charms, but those hoping for an in-depth 
character study, a autopsy of the recording industry, or an exploration 
of songwriters' angst, will be disappointed.  Lightweight and 
undemanding, this GRACE is a little less than amazing.</P>
