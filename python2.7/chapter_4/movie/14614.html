*********************************</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson</P>
<P>Written by: Todd Alcot, Chris Weitz, Paul Weitz</P>
<P>Starring: Voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman</P>
<P>Ingredients: Animated ants, bored worker ant seeking more to life</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In an animated underground ant colony consisting of millions of ants,
all of the ants are workaholic conformists except two individualistic
ants. One is General Mandible (voice of Gene Hackman), a military
megalomaniac who secretly plots to destroy the ant colony and create a
master race. He plans to take advantage of the conformist ants by
getting them to unwittingly carry out his orders.</P>
<P>The other individual is the humble Z, a likable, scrawny, nerdy worker
ant (voice of Woody Allen), who decides that there must be more to life
than fulfilling a prescribed role. Z secretly wishes for free choice,
and rails against conformism in his loquacious monologues. </P>
<P>A series of adventures ensues when Z falls in love with the Princess
Bala (voice Sharon Stone), and the two find themselves outside the
colony in search of a paradise called Insectopia. Later, Z and Bala must
thwart General Mandible's plot to destroy the colony. The moral of the
story is that unthinkingly accepting authority could turn you into
somebody else's pawn, unless you learn to think for yourself.</P>
<P>Opinion:
One of the fun things about watching animated movies is trying to guess
the voice behind the character. ANTZ features the recognizable voices of
Woody Allen (nerdy ant), Sharon Stone (princess ant), Sylvester Stallone
(buffed middle class soldier ant), Gene Hackman (megalomaniac general
ant), and Christopher Walken (flying ant). If you're good at this sort
of thing, see if you can spot Dan Aykroyd or Jennifer Lopez.</P>
<P>The good news is that ANTZ is an animated movie that adults can watch.
The computer effects are superb and there is no shortage of sardonic wit
or cultural references. The bad news is that ANTZ is not a kids movie
since the Woody Allen-style social commentary isn't intelligible for
young children. If forced to sit through it, they get antsy. </P>
