                     Secrets & Lies (1996)
                 A film review by David Cowen
                  Copyright 1996 David Cowen</PRE>
<P>"Secrets and lies!" spouts Maurice (Timothy Spall) at a family 
gathering with the most terrific sense of combined contempt and 
concern of any outburst I've ever heard in a film.  The title is 
what the film is about: the ways that people hold things from the 
people who are close to them, and how those things can burst 
back to the surface at any moment, disrupting everybody's lives.</P>
<P>If only viewing the first third of SECRETS & LIES, one would be 
tempted to call the film "Smiles and Frowns" -- the film darts between 
shots of Maurice doing his business (photography, eliciting strange
and artificial expressions from his clients) and the rest of his
immediate family who he is not able (except, on a picture hanging
on his mantle from 16 years ago) to elicit smiles from: his wife
Monica (Phyllis Logan) who works on stencilling their house, his
sister Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), a factory worker who appears to 
be suffering from a nervous breakdown, his niece Roxanne (Claire 
Rushbrook) who is just turning 21 and never speaks with Cynthia, 
and Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), who is just about to become 
part of the family.  The contrast of the artificial smiles and 
the sulking, brooding nature of everyone in the family is striking
and occasionally very funny.  </P>
<P>As in other films by director Mike Leigh, it's the performances 
that hold SECRETS & LIES together.  Brenda Blethyn's nervy, love-
starved Cynthia strikes just the right note: a scene in which she 
tries to get a hug from her brother Maurice is touching but truly 
pitiable, and her first encounters with Hortense are filled with
a shaking and trepidation that I've never seen portrayed quite 
so realistically in film.  In a role such as Cynthia's, it's hard
to create just the right balance of sympathy and disgust to 
understand the other characters actions toward her, but Blethyn 
hits the target dead-on.  The other actors, especially Jean-Baptiste,
do an admirable job, and a family barbeque scene which under 
lesser actors could be maudlin, in SECRETS & LIES can tear your 
heart out.  </P>
<P>SECRETS & LIES is a realistically bleak picture, but not as much so 
as Leigh's last film, NAKED.  The characters move through a flux 
in which their actions and revelations can either be heartwarming
or heartbreaking, moving from anguish to contentness in the kinds
of surprising but smooth transitions that we see in real life.  
Mike Leigh's celebrated style of storytelling has always struck 
me as being amazing in its own right: the concept of starting with 
a basic idea and then having the characters improvise the parts until
the characters become fully developed and a script can be written 
seems tremendously risky -- but Leigh's work is nearly invariably 
brilliant, and his films end up painting a much more full portrait
of his characters than any other directors' film could.</P>
<P>SECRETS & LIES is one of the rare films that ends on a happy note 
that doesn't seem contrived, as though the characters had purged
themselves of all of the underlying anxieties gnawing at them
and causing the conflicts present throughout the rest of the movie.
SECRETS & LIES is a film of wonderful realism, and is definately one 
of the best released this year.</P>
