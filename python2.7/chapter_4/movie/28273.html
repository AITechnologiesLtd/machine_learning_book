<PRE>SPRING FORWARD
--------------</PRE>
<P>When ex-con Paul (Liev Schrieber, "A Walk on the Moon") begins work as a
municipal parks worker, he's full of self doubt.  He's partnered with the
much older Murphy (Ned Beatty, "Cookie's Fortune"), a most unconventional
blue collar worker.  Over the course of a year and the change of the 
seasons, a deep and moving friendship will form between the two men in
writer/director Tom Gilroy's feature film debut "Spring Forward."</P>
<P>Paul and Murphy begin to bond when the uppity son of a gardening supply
store (Campbell Scott, "Big Night," perfectly capturing the unctuous manner 
of a man born to wealth unused to being challenged) tries to manipulate them 
into shovelling the manure his father's donated to the city.  Paul, emboldened 
by Murph's refusal to back down to Frederickson, calls Frederickson a vicious 
name and is rebuked by Murph for his language.  Frederickson claims Murphy's
reaction is because the term could be applied to Murphy's son, a gay man.
Paul is devastated that he's caused Murphy hurt.</P>
<P>"Spring Forward" progresses through six additional, real time scenes each
punctuated by a seasonal interlude in the author's home town of Ridgefield, 
Connecticutt.  Paul and Murph discuss religion and get high.  Murph
takes Paul to a house where there are puppies for sale by a woman who
might need companionship as much as Paul does ('Frasier's' Peri Gilpin).
Murph tells Paul about the hurt caused by a lifelong neighbor who refused
to stand up for his son, then the two meet that same neighbor (Bill Raymond)
at Murph's son's wake.  The two find a hysterical woman and her terrified
daughter by the side of the road.</P>
<P>"Spring Forward" is above all an actors' showcase, particularly for Beatty
and Schreiber who are simply sublime together.  Beatty's Murph looks like a 
blue collar everyman on the verge of retirement, but has an unexpectedly 
sensitive soul and Beatty never once makes us doubt this unconventional
package.  Schreiber's Paul has more beneath the surface than one would
expect, having substituted voracious reading for institutional education.  
He too, seems like a potential redneck who's instead opened his mind
beyond where his background should have led him.  Their verbal sparring and 
generational gap give the film a gentle humor.</P>
<P>Gilroy has provided these character riffs in his writing.  Murph has a
habit of making bakery allegories rather than use foul language ('I'd have
been frosted too,' 'He's got a cupcake mentality').  Paul expounds on
Asian spiritual concepts, and, just when he thinks he's flown over Murph's
head, Murph sums up his ideas with a simple cliche - the concept of karma
is translated into 'What goes around, comes around.'</P>
<P>Gilroy's playwright background is stamped all over his film debut to its
detriment, however. Gilroy's decision to film over the course of a year
was a plus for the actors, allowing them to form their bond gradually. 
Yet, every moment is jam packed with a philosophical or heavy moment, never 
giving his characters a chance to breath or his film to form more naturally.  </P>
<P>Director of photography Terry Stacey captures the beauty of his locations,
a rural New England utopia.  Composer Hahn Rowe's score features a folky,
yet plaintive fiddle, accentuating the film's bittersweetness.</P>
