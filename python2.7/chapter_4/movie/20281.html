<P>         Here's further proof Hollywood's powers that be have no sense
whatsoever: Last week, the trade paper Variety reported we'll soon be
treated to a "Starsky and Hutch" movie.</P>
<P> Yes, "Starsky and Hutch," that utterly vapid 1970s cop series
featuring David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser as undercover cops who
regularly cruised discos with their sidekick Huggy Bear (Antonio
Fargas), a dopey would-be pimp. Has anyone even thought about "Starsky
and Hutch" since it left the air 20 years ago? It's just the latest sign
that absolutely anything can be turned into big-screen fodder these
days, provided it's been done before.</P>
<P>  Take, for example, "The Astronaut's Wife," in which pixieish
schoolteacher Charlize Theron begins to suspect her husband is not the
man he used to be. Although writer-director Rand Ravich doesn't
acknowledge as much in the credits, the movie is essentially an update
of the 1958 drive-in classic "I Married A Monster From Outer Space,"
which, like "Invaders From Mars" (1953) and "Invasion of the Body
Snatchers" (1955), utilized the prevailing fear of Communism and loss of
individuality in a sci-fi context.</P>
<P> In "Monster," newlywed Gloria Talbot is spooked by spouse Tom
Tryon's aloofness and the way he and the other men in town gather down
at the bar every night simply to talk, not to drink. Eventually, she
learns Tryon and most of the other local guys are actually
alcohol-intolerant creatures from the planet Andromeda who have stolen
human bodies. Their plan is to impregnate women and repopulate Earth
with monsters like themselves.</P>
<P> In "Wife," Theron's Jillian becomes pregnant with twins shortly
after her husband Spence (Johnny Depp) returns from a space shuttle
mission during which he lost contact with mission control for two
mysterious minutes. Although joyous at first, Jillian is unnerved by
Spence's strange behavior -- including the odd faces he makes after
tasting a drink at a party -- and begins to think something might be
horribly wrong.</P>
<P> Jillian makes this assumption so early on in the story one
might expect Ravich has a big twist up his sleeve, a la "The Sixth
Sense." But no. Once it has set its course, the languorous "Wife"
lumbers to a wholly predictable conclusion made worse by Ravich's
attempt to throw in an unsurprising surprise at the very last minute.</P>
<P> The movie is also handicapped by its casting. Theron, in a role
almost identical to her part in "The Devil's Advocate," tries terribly
hard but she's not a skilled enough actress to carry a film on her own.
She can manage one emotional state per scene, usually tearful shock,
which doesn't make for a particularly fascinating character.</P>
<P> Although the always edgy Depp might seem the perfect choice to
play a man who may or may not be under an alien influence, the actor has
little to do here but stand around looking ominous. He's stifled by the
script; Ravich shows us so little of the early Spence it's difficult to
determine exactly how much the man has changed.</P>
<P> The other key figures in "Wife" are as run-of-the-mill as they
come, including a possibly crazy former NASA exec (Joe Morton),
Jillian's hard-luck kid sister (Clea DuVall) and an understanding
veteran astronaut's wife (Blair Brown) who counsels Jillian. Only DuVall
shows any signs of life, putting a nasty spin on such lines to her
sister as "you landed Johnny Rocket Boy and I keep getting different
versions of Throws Up On Himself Elmo."</P>
<P> Ravich tries to disguise his well-worn material with bursts of
stolen style, having the camera do Brian DePalma-style circles around
Jillian in moments of stress or throwing in a weird little MTV-ish
episode with Jillian standing perfectly still in a school hallway while
children run around her at lightning speed. Perhaps Ravich was so
concerned with making the movie look good he forgot about coherence:
Those who like to pick out continuity errors will particularly enjoy the
sequence in which our heroine ducks into a subway station in the middle
of the night and emerges minutes later in the light of day. James
