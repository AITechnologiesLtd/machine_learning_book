<PRE>MERCY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Ellen Barkin, as the toughly resolute Detective Catherine Palmer, is
investigating the second of what will prove to be a series of gruesome
murders.  Lying before her in the opening sequence is the nude body of a
female executive who has been brutally and ritualistically killed.</P>
<P>As the body count mounts in MERCY, the link between the victims will
prove to be a predilection for sadomasochistic sex among females.  The
movie, written and directed by Damian Harris, is based on David L.
Lindsey's novel.  As the director and one of the film's leads, Peta
Wilson, told us at the screening, both the book and the movie were
thoroughly researched.  Lindsey spent 2 years in S&M dungeons, and Peta
said that she visited 36 S&M parlors of pain.  All of this
notwithstanding, the story's weakness is that part of it seems too
outlandish to be credible.  On the other hand, most viewers will not
have frequented such palaces of pain and so will have no real idea as to
the story's accuracy.</P>
<P>Starting off with the normal detached professionalism that you would
expect from a homicide detective, Catherine quickly goes astray.  When
she picks up a stranger (Stephen Baldwin) at a bar for a one-night
stand, complete with some heavy slapping, you can see that Catherine may
possess her own wild side.</P>
<P>The common link among the dead women is an alluringly tall, blond
lesbian named Vickie Kittrie (Peta Wilson).  Although Vickie at first
resists giving Catherine any information, she reveals more as she sets
her eyes on Catherine as her next sexual conquest.  Vickie explains that
sex for her is like putting your head in the mouth of the most vicious
lion at the zoo.  A mixture of sex, secrecy and seduction runs through
the film as does the commonality of child abuse as an underlying cause
of many of the characters' actions.</P>
<P>The director puts a firm stamp on his picture.  Scenes move with a
deliberate slowness, accentuated by mesmerizing music and handsome
cinematography.  Sometimes the editor switches to a slightly slowed
motion to further enhance the mood.</P>
<P>The intriguing film is at its best when it sticks to its roots as a
crime drama with the investigation parts being the picture's highlights.
The sexuality works at times, but too often dissolves into a kind of
psychobabble. Julian Sands plays an especially bizarre psychiatrist
whose performance is unnecessarily detached.</P>
<P>In a film without a lot of laughs and one in which the S&M world
frequently looks too glamorous, Catherine's second in command, Lt.
Fritch (Beau Starr), pokes fun at it all.  "Doesn't anyone have good
old-fashioned sex anymore -- missionary position, then watch television
afterwards?" he asks.  Not in Vickie's world since they're only
interested in sex if it's laced with as much danger as possible.</P>
<P>MERCY runs 1:55.  It is rated R for language, drug use and perverse
sexual behavior including violence and nudity.  It would be acceptable
for high school seniors.  (The director told us that they had to go
through 4 submissions to the MPAA before they got the film an R rating.
In a picture with much gruesome violence, it was the brief hint of oral
lesbian sexuality that caused them the most trouble. Wilson though it
was stupid since she said that she clearly just kissed Barkin's hip.)</P>
