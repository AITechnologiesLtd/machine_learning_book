LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND (director: Richard Kwietniowski; cast:
John Hurt, Jason Priestley, Fiona Loewi, Maury Chaykin, 1997-UK)</P>
<P>Without John Hurt's magnificent performance, he appears in every scene
and is very apealing, this film would have fallen flat on its face. He
plays a reclusive, stuffy Londonite, scholarly writer, in scorn of
modern society, living in an immaculate library-like house that has none
of the modern everyday technology most people take for granted in
America and Great Britain, such as a TV, VCR, microwave, computer, and
so on. He is stubbornly set in his ways. And as we are introduced to
him, we find him to be a bit arrogant, as well as someone who is out of
touch with reality.</P>
<P>He goes by the name of Giles De'Ath, which fits the prudish image this
recent widower conveys, his name also comes awfully close to being
pronounced as death is. Oddly enough, he never goes to the cinema (I
could not even imagine anyone living without going to the cinema). But
his life changes drastically after he gives a BBC interview and begins
to open up a bit; and, after talking with a colleague, he daringly goes
to see a film based on an E.M. Forster novel that is playing in a
multiplex theater. Since he has no clue about how these theaters
operate, he mistakenly ends up seeing something called HOTPANTS COLLEGE
11. Lo and behold, he at first thinks he is watching the Forster movie
and is disgusted with it, but as he is about to exit he suddenly falls
in love with one of the male stars of this soft core porn film, an
aspiring actor (Ronnie Bostock), engagingly played by Jason Priestley.
This changes his life, as he decides to become the foremost expert on
Bostock's life, researching all the films and magazine interviews he has
done. It is like he becomes a teen-ager again, hiding the filthy
magazines from his housekeeper and somehow managing to buy a VCR to
watch these films. It is amusing to see that when he gets home, he
doesn't realize that he has to have a TV to see the videos.</P>
<P>But this is not enough of a challenge for him, so he decides to fly to
Long Island where Bostock lives with his girlfriend, the glamorous
model, Audrey (Fiona). He uses his charm to get to meet her, and will
soon meet Bostock when he returns from L.A.. We get a tour of Long
Island (ugh!). And we watch how Giles changes, seemingly becoming a more
gentle and sensitive person, but his love is not returned by Bostock in
the physical way he wishes it returned, who handles himself with dignity
over Giles's mistaken advances. What remains interesting to ponder
further is the relationship between the two males. It is the old
opposites attract syndrome; in this case, it is trashy pop star meets a
scholar from a former century, and only the scholar falls madly in love,
as the trashy pop star is only interested in the class and knowledge
that the scholar exudes.</P>
<P>The comic effects of the film seem light enough, that is until the
homo-erotic pulsations become overbearing, and we are left, in the end,
with a rather awkward drama being played out, that is somehat unnerving
to behold, made plausible only by Hurt's presence as a commanding
performer. Yet it is tastefully done, but not as biting as Thomas Mann's
film version of  the same theme, DEATH IN VENICE. The message of LOVE
AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND could fit either pop or aesthetic culture,
coming to the conclusion that love is strange. I believe Mickey and
Sylvia had a 1950s hit song about that theme.</P>
