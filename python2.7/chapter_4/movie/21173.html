<PRE>HARD
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>
<P>When a film sinks to the level of making jokes about pedophilic rape,
you know it's in big trouble.  HARD, directed by John Huckert and
written by the director and John Matkowsky, is a disgusting movie whose
only possible saving grace is that it's sometimes laughably bad, if you
get over the disgusting, gratuitous violence.  There was some laughter
at our screening, but the most frequent expression heard afterwards is
that you felt like you needed to take a bath, it was so repulsive.</P>
<P>This movie could be exhibit A in what's wrong with many indie films.
The acting and writing have all the sophistication expected from a first
year student at a junior college.  To compensate, one suspects, for the
lameness of the production, the director layers on a pornographic level
of violence and sadism.  If the movie can't be interesting, it will at
least try to shock us into appreciating it.</P>
<P>Jack, a gay serial killer of other gays, is played by Malcolm Moorman in
the only almost passable performance in the picture.  Noel Palomaria
plays new promoted Detective Raymond Vates, an in-the-closet gay.  His
eventual coming out makes for the least believable part of a ridiculous
story.  As the wise, older Detective Tom Ellis, Charles Lanyer is
Raymond's partner.</P>
<P>Most of the disgusting scenes are indescribable.  One, for example,
features a prostitute whose nickname is Lockjaw and who suffers from
epileptic fits.  You can probably guess out where the writers are going
with that setup.</P>
<P>The movie works only if you assume it's a parody, but few scenes are
intentionally funny.  Most are so sickening that you'll be looking for
plenty of opportunities to visit the concession stand and the restroom
-- anything to get away from the movie.</P>
<P>Then there's the dialog.  "I've spent more time here washing out my
jockey strap than you have being a detective," Tom tells Raymond so as
to put him in his place.</P>
<P>Another choice selection of lines occurs after the second murder.  "You
thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?" Raymond asks.  "What are you thinking?" Tom
replies.  "Serial," Raymond says taciturnly.  "Need three to make it
serial," Tom corrects him.  End of scene.</P>
<P>Jack, who knows within a nanosecond whether a guy is gay or not, comes
on to Raymond.  "You're inclined; I'm inclined," Jack tells Raymond
after Jack has lured him to a bar late one night.  "We're a cut above
the rest."</P>
<P>When Raymond does admit his sexual preference, the treatment he receives
from his fellow officers is horrific.  Among other things, they'd rather
see him and his partner die than show up when backup is formally
requested.  The cops' actions are as shameless as the movie itself.</P>
<P>HARD runs a long 1:42.  It is not rated but would be NC-17 for strong,
graphic violence, rape, torture, nudity and language.  It is not
acceptable for teenagers.</P>
