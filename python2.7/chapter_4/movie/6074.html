<PRE>                            MAYBE...MAYBE NOT
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>

<P>My best friends are Inuit, but among the other best 
friends some are German, of the post W.W.II generations. I 
don't want to hurt them, but it is a well-known fact that, at 
least in the area of cinema,  "German Humor" is an 
oxymoron. The dictionary definition of this word is "A 
rhetorical figure in which incongruous or contradictory 
terms are combined, as in a deafening silence and a 
mournful optimist." Or, as some slanderers put it "military 
intelligence."</P>
<P>Given the huge historical role of pre-Nazi German cinema 
and, starting in the 1960s, the quality of the New or Young 
German cinema, it is amazing that German comedy has 
been so low on the international totem pole. There have 
been very few exceptions, and even then nothing that 
could place German comedy at a rocket's throw of 
American, U.K., Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Yugoslav, Czech, 
Hungarian, Irish, Senegalese, Australian, etc. comedies.</P>
<P>Now comes "Maybe..." which opened in Germany around 
September 1994, became a monster hit there, made 
locally a cult figure of its main actor Til Schweiger ... and 
took two years to cross the Atlantic. Will it finally break 
through the humor barrier for Germany?</P>
<P>The movie opens charmingly. In a cabaret, couples are 
dancing to songs of the 1920s and 1930s, including "Arme 
Gigolo." The sounds, style and ambiance almost fool you 
into thinking that the setting is way back when. Then 
comes the shock of modernization. </P>
<P>Axel, a hunk of a waiter, exchanges glances with a dancing 
woman.As soon as that song is over, the two of them are 
found in the toilet, copulating with energy. (Interesting 
how the other film I review this week, "Feeling Minnesota," 
has an almost identical scene at the start).  </P>
<P>In the next cubicle, Doro, Axel's live-in girlfriend, hears 
the commotion, stands up on the seat and tells Axel, who 
has cheated on her repeatedly, that this is the end and 
that he's out of her apartment.</P>
<P>Seeking a temporary lodging, Axel fails repeatedly.  His 
quest ends at a homosexual acquaintance's apartment 
during a bull-session of a gay study group discussing 
female sexuality. </P>
<P>Their talk is graphic, explicit, specific and detailed to an 
extent that I cannot recall from any other film. It also 
Teutonically serious, which, depending on your attitude, 
can make this funny, ludicrous or plain coarse. The movie 
is interspered with very frank language which includes a 
minute descripton of a gay man's one and only experience 
with a woman. The R-rating means a hard R, but on the 
other hand, there are no same-sex visuals anywhere.</P>
<P>Straight Axel becomes immediately the 
not-at-all-obscure object of the gays' desire. Doro, in 
revenge, tries to make out with a man, but cannot (an ugly 
scene where the man insults Doro). Axel is taken to a 
party of drag queens gotten up to the limit.  He becomes 
everyone's dream-boy, takes everything in stride, is not 
especially shocked. On the contrary, he looks around 
amusedly but not ironically, even strikes a friendship with 
quiet, sweet and rather timid Norbert.</P>
<P>The party, like much of the film, is shot in those garish 
colors that German cinema often favors. Drunk by 
evening's end, Axel accepts Norbert's hospitality until he 
finds something. There is no sex between the two. When, 
the next morning, Norbert and his other apartment 
-mates are shown, it's a total transformation. In their 
business suits, and without any queer mannerisms, they 
are just ordinary citizens.</P>
<P>Axel's peregrinations continue while Doro finds out she is 
pregnant by Axel and won't have any of her co-workers 
advice to get rid of the baby. Axel and Norbert go to pick 
up Axel's stuff from Doro's apartment. In an intricate way 
that cannot be described simply,  the two men find 
themselves respectively semi-naked and fully naked. 
Doro's impromptu return (how dumb can the man be?) 
panics the new friends. Discovering Norbert in a closet 
and in his birthday suit, she concludes the inevitable. Yet, 
what with Axel's fumbled protests, the nagging doubt 
remains. Is he bisexual, gay or straight? Maybe... maybe 
not.</P>
<P>This theme is carried to the end. The comics that are the 
source of the film had a gay point of view. The movie 
changed this into making Axel a straight who gets 
embroiled in a sexual farce. In the hard-to- translate  
German title, "bewegt" means "moved," as when someone 
crosses and recrosses the boundary between straight and 
gay. </P>
<P>The plot thickens in classic bedroom-farce fashion, with 
coincidences,  confusions and quid pro quos that we 
accept willingly. It leads to a reconciliation and to the 
wedding of Axel and 9-month pregnant Doro. New 
complications arise when Axel and former high school 
lover Elke meet and make a date that eventually moves to 
Norbert's apartment. Axel pretends it is his but says 
things like "The bathroom? It is over there -- I think." </P>
<P>More farce involves vegetarian Norbert's new companion, 
a butcher who justifies the saying "Never ask how sausage 
is made," and other inventions. Predictably, the birth of 
the child (with additional comic mix-ups), brings a happy 
ending. </P>
<P>The movie has a valid subject, the possibility of 
friendship between straights and gays. It also deals in 
almost documentary, wild but sympathetic fashion, with 
gay life, treated with relative naturalness. But the 
story-line is uneven and meandering, the humor is 
adolescent bathroom stuff.  The new darling of the German 
masses, Til Schweiger, as Axel is pretty much of a dimwit 
stud.</P>
<P>The movie lacks anything approaching subtlety. Acting, 
situations and most characters are broad, done bluntly 
and heavily. Where calming pauses are needed, we get 
near-hysteria. Where mood would do, we get a mysterious 
sexual spray. Where wit is called for, we get a mix of lead 
and concrete. Whether all this is compensated by a 
number of laughs and insights is for each viewer to decide.</P>
