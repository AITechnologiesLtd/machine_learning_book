HEAVEN WITH A GUN</PRE>
<PRE>Gunslinger: 'I am burying a man.'</PRE>
<PRE>Cowpoke:                'That's a sheepherder.'</PRE>
<PRE>Gunslinger: 'I know.'</PRE>
<P>This small dialogue exchange is the opening sequence of "Heaven With a Gun," 
a strange western that somehow manages to work even if it shouldn't. The 
parts of the film do not make a cohesive whole but they do make a watchable 
film, if nothing else. </P>
<P>"Heaven With a Gun" stars Glenn Ford as the gunslinger in that sequence, a 
man named Jim Killian who certainly doesn't like to see sheepherders, 
particularly Hopi Indian sheepherders hanged. Nonetheless, after burying the 
man and forcing two cattle cowpokes to make wave, Jim arrives in the town 
Vinegaroon, populated by the usual kinds of characters such as drunk cowboys, 
genial storekeepers, loose prostitutes who demand prompt payment for their 
duties, and so on. And, as always, there is a poker game involving high 
stakes with the former cowpokes Jim had confronted earlier. One of them is 
Coke (David Carradine), "the wild mustang," who is ready to kill Jim. And we 
get the obligatory scene of an impending act of violence at a poker table 
interrupted by the owner of the saloon/bar (known as the "Road to Ruin"). In 
this case, it is a breath of fresh air named Madge (the fabulous Carolyn 
Jones), who knows Jim from the past. </P>
<P>Jim's intention is to start a church in town called "The Mission Church of 
the Good Shepherd." That's right, he is not only a gunslinger, he is a 
preacher! He is heaven with a gun, similar to the character Eastwood would 
later play in "Pale Rider." He hopes to bring faith and communion into the 
town, and also hopes that the sheep herders and the cattle herders will agree 
that both animals can graze on the same range. Naturally, Jim's plan is met 
with plenty of disapproval from the cattle herders, including the grizzly Asa 
Peck (John Anderson). And there are also other obstacles, such as a Hopi 
woman named Leloopa (an unrecognizable Barbara Hershey), who wants to cook 
and clean for Jim since he buried her father. And perhaps Madge is a little 
jealous of this woman, considering that she thinks Jim is the man for her. </P>
<P>"Heaven With a Gun" does have its flaws. The introduction of a man named Mace 
(J.D. Cannon) who served prison time with Jim simply marks time - the 
character is evil yet has charisma and yet you wish there was more of him. 
Also there is a rape scene in the film that also feels extraneous, not to 
mention a near scalping of another character. The violence is so heavy and 
the sheep herders are so clearly without redeeming value that you wish there 
was something more than the ending that is given. It all feels anticlimactic 
but I will say this - it is a rare kind of ending for a western and must have 
been placed there because of the pacifist times in which it was made. </P>
<P>On the plus side, Glenn Ford is in fine form, exuding toughness, sweetness 
and a tinge of humor - he also makes the character of Jim soulful and 
forgiving. Ford's scenes with the lovely Carolyn Jones are wonderful if 
short-lived. I also like Barbara Hershey, despite the fact she looks too 
pristine to be a Hopi Indian (check out those sparkling white teeth!). Scenes 
of a barn being turned into a church and a nude woman sitting outside a house 
are rarities in this genre, not to mention the ending. "Heaven With a Gun" is 
fine, two-fisted entertainment but it does ring a little hollow. Nonetheless, 
the cast makes it as close to heaven as a western could ever be. </P>
