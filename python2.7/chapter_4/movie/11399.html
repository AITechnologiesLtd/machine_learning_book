<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        When I watch films like Hush, I wonder what kind of pitch the film
makers made to the producers to make the project look appealing.  I
think about what the intended target audience is, and what the intended
genre is, and how much money they expected to make with the film.  I
think about these things because the film itself does not answer the
questions.  </P>
<P>        It's a film staring a talented actress who appeals to adults (Jessica
Lange), a beautiful babe who appeals to younger males (Gwyneth Paltrow),
a hot hunk who would probably appeal to most women (Jonathan Schaech),
and stuffs them into an overblown, tedious thriller about a crazy
Southun' mom on a sunny Connecticut horse ranch.  The highest paid
lawyers in the country shouldn't have been able to sell this premise,
but someone did, and the film was produced.</P>
<P>        Of course, lousy test-screenings caused TriStar to change the name from
less interesting titles including Bloodline and Kilronan (one of which
is generic, the other senseless to those who haven't seen the film). 
Apparently, the movie has been sitting on a shelf somewhere for over a
year, just waiting to be released to suspense-thirsty audiences.  And
now, thank heavens, it is here!</P>
<P>        It's about Helen (Paltrow) and Jackson (Schaech).  Jackson takes Helen
out of New York for a weekend to meet his mother, Martha (Lange) in
Connecticut; she lives on a huge horse-breeding ranch called Kilronan
(now you know what that other title means!).  As the all-powerful
audience, we know immediately that Martha is jealous of Helen, but
neither Helen nor Jackson notice this until much, much later in the
film.  The weekend ends, and they return to their home in New York.  </P>
<P>        Helen gets pregnant.  Jackson asks her to marry him.  Someone breaks
into the apartment and attacks Helen.  Helen gets upset and wants to
move to Connecticut so they can fix up the ranch and have a child in the
nice, country atmosphere.  And Martha slowly goes crazy as she begins to
develop delusions about Helen's child being her own.  From there, the
film is unthinkably absurd (up to that point, it is imaginably absurd).</P>
<P>        The movie is just poorly made.  The script is disorganized; as I
watched, I noted that it felt like a first draft of a practice script. 
I would not have structured the film in this clumsy, back-and-forth
manner (from New York to Kilronan to New York to Kilronan, over and over
again).  There isn't even any suspense; Martha is clearly insane from
the get-go, and we all know what's going to happen just from seeing the
preview.</P>
<P>        The story itself is not pleasant.  Writer/director Jonathan Darby
apparently wanted to make a film that observes the complicated bonds
between a mother and her son, and what happens when that bond is in
jeopardy, but there is no depth in this story.  Everything here is for
shock value, and what isn't intended to be shocking is boring.  The
story lends itself to only one kind of conclusion (which we can all
guess because this is a mainstream film), and it just doesn't ring true.</P>
<P>        Gwyneth Paltrow almost holds the film together with her no-nonsense
approach, but one actress typically can't counter an entirely bad script
and execution.  She plays her part well, but Helen is a flat, often
unbelievably mean character, and what concern I manifested for her
spawned only from my liking of the actress.  Schaech, who I last saw in
the loathsome The Doom Generation, is bland an unnoticeable here.</P>
<P>        Lange is the strangest part of the film.  Her performance is
overwrought, but often mildly amusing to watch.  The character she plays
is so deeply psychotic that I just wanted to grab her by the shoulders
and shake her violently, screaming, "Why are you so crazy!?"  When
Martha coolly tells her lies, It seems that she actually believes what
she says.  As an observer of a character whom I've known for
approximately thirty seconds, I would like to think that the characters
in the film--who have supposedly know her for years--would be able to
read her just a little bit.  No, Jackson is not very observant.  In
fact, he's totally in the dark until the very last scene.</P>
<P>        I understand why TriStar procrastinated with the release of Hush.  It
is a bad film.  It has very little to offer anyone, mostly because it's
the wrong kind of story from which to make a thriller.  Unfortunately,
it really doesn't matter when a film this bad gets released, because
almost no one will go see it anyway.  Thrillers should contain serial
killers or deep mental anguish, and they should never, ever take place
on a sunny horse ranch in Connecticut.  </P>
