<P>   I guess most of us think we've had weird childhoods, parents
who did not understand us, but Eva Gardos's coming-of-age story
is an unusual one because not many of us were in her
predicament. One example of what people like her went through
was seen in the documentary "Into the Arms of Strangers," about
10,000 Jewish children in Nazi-dominated Europe who were
whisked to England where they were adopted, some never seeing
their biological parents again.  Not that Eva Gardos was a
member of some hated minority in her native Hungary, and in fact
she never even felt a need to leave her homeland.  In "American
Rhapsody," which is a dramatization of her early and adolescent
years, she is seen singing songs in praise of the fun she has in
Communist Hungary during the 1950's, nicely decked out in a
white uniform with other genuinely smiling girls.  But her parents
faced a different set of circumstances, which is why Ms. Gardos
gives us a labor of love with a movie depicting her bewilderment
as a kid and later, her rebellion as an unhappy adolescent.</P>
<P>   Eva, who in this story is named Suzanne and is seen at the age
of one, again at six, and yet again at age fifteen, could scarcely
have known what impelled her folks, Margit (Nastassja Kinski) and
Peter (Tony Goldwyn) to risk everything by leaving the country of
their birth.  Peter's publishing house was closed down by the
repressive Communist regime governing the East European
nation and, as we later learn, someone happens to his wife Margit
that is quite a bit more gruesome.  Writer-director Gabor takes us
through the risky escape, as Margit and Peter, dressed as
peasants, are put on a train heading toward the Austrian border
under the supervision of whatever they call a Coyote in the
Budapest area, crawl under barbed wire, find themselves in
Vienna and later go to Los Angeles.  The trouble is that they have
to leave their infant daughter Suzanne behind because of a stupid
error by the little girl's grandmother.  Suzanne grows without her
real folks but stays in Budapest with foster parents, the kindly
Jeno (Balazs Galko) and Teri (Zsuzsa Czinkoczi), inhabiting the
middle of the story at age six where Suzanne is played by the
marvelous and adorable Kelly Endresz Banlaki.  Suzanne is
wrested from the foster folks whom she loves by her grandmother
and whisked to L.A. to join her biological parents where at first she
digs the hamburgers, the Elvis records, and the lovely, if sterile,
suburban landscape.  By the time she reaches the troubled age of
fifteen, however (as played by Scarlett Johansson--formerly of
"The Horse Whisperers" and "Ghost World"), she's homesick for
the old country and the kindly people she leaves behind.</P>
<P>   I rarely want to throw tomatoes at the screen but I did in this
case--and this is not a criticism of the film.   Margit, who felt so
oppressed during the Soviet occupation of Hungary and was
itching to get out of there, now becomes a bit a Red Fascist
herself, just like the occupations forces in 1950's Budapest. 
While praising the land of  liberty, she suddenly does not like the
freedoms that her daughter wants to enjoy with a handsome boy. 
Seeing the teen kissing the lad, she has bolts put on Suzanne's
bedroom door and locks installed on the windows--to the chagrin
of the poor teen who by then wants to escape to freedom--back to
Hungary!</P>
<P>   The question that keeps us, oh, in the middle of our seats by
this time is: will she bolt for good and stay with her kindly
Hungarian folks, where she can find equally handsome boys and
be serenaded by gypsies?  Or will she sell out and realize that
America is her real home after all?</P>
<P>   Gardos wears her heart on her sleeve. After all, this is her story
and she must be proud indeed to share it with movie buffs
everywhere.  The film played first at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival
in the Czech Republic, then headed west to Nantucket, and is
now scheduled to open August 10 in NY and LA and later in the
rest of the country.  Aside from being an absolute labor of love for
Gardos, "An American Rhapsody" falls short of its title--a fairly
ordinary picture told in a conventional style albeit with canny
lensing especially in Budapest by Elemer Ragalyi, backed up by a
Hungarian crew in the city of bridges and an L.A. team here in the
States.  Though arthouse fare, the plot is schematic.  Important
gaps make us want to know more about, say, how the Red Cross
managed to sponsor Suzanne's solo trip at the age of six from
Budapest to L.A. via London.  Tony Goldwyn plays the kind of dad
we all wish we had--understanding, gentle, often at a loss to calm
down his neurotic wife.  And Natassja Kinski blinks quite a bit. 
But oh, that Kelly Endresz Banlaki--that's the little actress whose
notable performance will survive in our memory after the
predictable plot is forgotten.</P>
