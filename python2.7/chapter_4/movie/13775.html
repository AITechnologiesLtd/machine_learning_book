<PRE>The Accused (1948)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 61</PRE>
<P>"The Accused" is a crime drama and character study.
The film has a good script and a competent cast.
There is a reasonable amount of suspense, although
one can easily guess where the plot is headed next.</P>
<P>"The Accused" is Loretta Young, playing a college
Psychology professor.  One of her students is brash
playboy Douglas Dick, who is determined to score with
her prim but attractive teacher.  Young stupidly
goes on a date with Dick, and ends up killing him
in self-defense.  She then tries to make it look
like a suicide.</P>
<P>Soon, police inspector Wendell Corey (whom you may
remember in a similar role in "Rear Window") is on
the job.  Dick's lawyer, Robert Cummings, becomes
romantically involved with Young.  Student Suzanne
Dalbert (who has a terrible foreign accent) is the
prime suspect, but eventually the focus is turned on
Young.</P>
<P>The career of Loretta Young was at its peak in 1948.
She had just won the Best Actress Oscar for "The
Farmer's Daughter" and would be nominated next year
for "Come to the Stable".  Her character in "The
Accused" is tense and sexually repressed, and the
glamorous, graceful Young is a bit miscast.  When
Young changes her clothes and hairstyle as part of
the cover-up of her crime, the difference is not
strong enough, perhaps because the studio felt it
would hurt her image if she were less attractive
in the first half of the film.</P>
<P>The best role, although a small one, is given to
Sam Jaffe, who plays a colorful forensics examiner.</P>
<P>The script is intelligent, perhaps too much so,
throwing in psychology jargon.  The script controls
the direction, which rushes the story along.  The
pace does maintain dramatic tension, but perhaps
the impact of key scenes would be greater if
cinematography was used more often to tell the story.</P>
