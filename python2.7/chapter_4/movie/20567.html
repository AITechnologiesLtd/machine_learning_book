<PRE>RUN LOLA RUN
Rating: ***1/2 (out of four)
R, 1999
Director/Screenplay: Tom Tykwer
Starring Cast: Franka Potente</PRE>
<P>RUN LOLA RUN should be required viewing for all Hollywood 
action-movie directors. Here is a film that is as fast-paced and 
exciting as anything I've seen the past couple of years, and not only 
does it establish its breakneck pace without blowing anything up or 
dropping giant pieces of CGI on the screen, but it even creates a 
couple of sympathetic characters and offers some clever bits of 
commentary and insight along the way.</P>
<P>The premise is about as simple as they come. Lola (Franka Potente), a 
young woman living with her parents, receives a frantic telephone 
call from her boyfriend Manni, who has misplaced 100,000 deutschmarks 
of drug money only twenty minutes before he was supposed to deliver 
it to a gangster. Certain that he will be killed if he shows up 
without the money, he plans to rob a grocery store. Lola begs him to 
wait and promises to come up with the money--somehow. Since her 
bicycle has been stolen, she has to run from one location to the next 
as she tries to come up with the cash.</P>
<P>All of this exposition occurs in the first ten or fifteen minutes. 
Following that, writer/director Tom Tykwer shows us three different 
scenarios for what will happen in the next twenty minutes. Suffice it 
to say that all of them involve Lola scrambling between several 
locations, and that in each case it goes right down to the wire 
before we see whether Lola and Manni will escape their predicament or 
not. I would estimate that at least five to seven minutes of each 
scenario are spent on Lola running through the streets, yet these 
scenes do not grow tiresome in the least. Tykwer has a particularly 
flamboyant visual style: his camera rarely sits still, and when it 
does, it's usually watching from an unusual angle. More often, it's 
following Lola on one of her mad dashes, circling rapidly around a 
character in crisis, or even taking a swooping dive
towards the scene. But his methods are varied enough to avoid 
overkill, and the combination of his hyperactive camera work and the 
film's energetic techno score make for a brand of frenetic action 
that is rare even in today's world of hi-tech filmmaking.</P>
<P>The most interesting aspect of RUN LOLA RUN is the way in which 
Tykwer uses the differing scenarios to reflect his ideas about fate 
and chance. In each, there are at first only minor variations, but 
they soon lead to larger ones. For example, in both the first and 
second scenarios, Lola goes to her father's bank to try to get the 
money, but in the second, someone trips her as she runs down the 
stairs. As a result, the timing of her later collision with a 
passerby varies by a second or two, and when she gets to the bank, 
she arrives at a somewhat more uncomfortable moment in her father's 
conversation with his illicit lover. Thus his reaction to her sudden 
appearance is much more immediately hostile, which dramatically 
alters everything that follows. Tykwer also employs a clever gimmick 
whereby he momentarily cuts away from Lola to someone whom she has 
just passed, then shows a quick series of photographs that detail the 
rest of the person's life. These are also sometimes dramatically 
different between scenarios, depending on what exactly happens when 
Lola passes the person.</P>
<P>I've grown somewhat tired of movies that establish their hip 
credentials by making criminals their protagonists, but RUN LOLA RUN 
gets away with it because it manages to portray its characters 
sympathetically without whitewashing their actions. It is when Lola 
and Manni abandon their criminal impulses that they are most 
successful in escaping their predicament, and in one case divine 
intervention even seems to play a role. Two wrongs don't make a right 
in this film, and when Lola or Manni starts threatening violence or 
attempting robbery, things tend to go even further awry as a result.</P>
<P>This is not to say that RUN LOLA RUN is some sort of philosophical 
masterpiece, just that it can lay claim to a certain amount of depth 
underneath its high style. It isn't the most intelligent film of the 
year, but it might be the most entertaining, and it reaches that 
plateau without falling into the category of a guilty pleasure.</P>
