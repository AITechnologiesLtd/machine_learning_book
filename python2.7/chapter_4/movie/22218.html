<P>         One of the strangest ironies in the history of entertainment is
the popularity of the movie musical during the Depression era. At a time
when much of America was unemployed, teetering on the edge of
destitution, filmgoers flocked to see lavish fantasies about
ultra-wealthy sophisticates who, when they tired of their New York
penthouses, would fly off to look for love on the Riviera or to peruse
the Parisian fashion houses for some new styles. With "Everyone Says I
Love You," writer-director Woody Allen attempts the Herculean task of
reviving this kind of escapist cinema in contemporary terms.</P>
<P> Allen has put his own twist on the musical genre, however, by
casting actors who are not exactly renowned for their singing: Julia
Roberts, Goldie Hawn, Tim Roth, etc. As these stars valiantly try to
deliver such standards as "I'm Through With Love" and "Just You, Just
Me," it becomes apparent Allen's stunt serves a purpose by humanizing
characters who often seem closer to being stereotypes than real people.
They may be living large and running wild, but at heart these are just
everyday folks who can't carry a tune any better than most of us.</P>
<P> At the center of "Everyone" is an Upper East Side family headed
up by softhearted activist Steffi (Hawn) and her second husband Bob
(Alan Alda). Steffi's daughter Skylar (Drew Barrymore) is preparing for
her upcoming marriage to lawyer Holden (Edward Norton), but she's also
tempted by a charming ex-con (Roth). Meanwhile, Steffi's other daughter
DJ (Natasha Lyonne) succumbs to passion with a gondolier while touring
Venice with her dad Joe (Allen). She's not the only one swept away by
the romance of the canals: Joe has become obsessed with fellow
vacationer Von (Roberts) and schemes to win her over.</P>
<P> It's the kind of material that would have seemed effervescent
60 years ago, with RKO producing and Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Edward
Everett Horton and Lucille Ball starring. But in Allen's sweaty palms,
"Everyone" often strains itself trying to entertain. Even when the movie
hits its mark, you're usually aware of how much work it took to get
there.</P>
<P> Allen's own performance is particularly unsteady and sometimes
downright squirm-inducing. Now past 60, he continues his tradition of
pursuing babes. But while his romances with Mariel Hemingway in
"Manhattan" (1979) and Juliette Lewis in "Husbands and Wives" (1992)
could have been dismissed as typical mid-life flings, his courtship of
the sparkling Roberts invites snickers about whether he's robbing the
cradle or she's robbing the grave. Allen's script actually forces
Roberts at one point to describe him as "sexy and magical"; that she
delivers the line without choking proves she's an underrated actress.
Poor Roberts is also called upon to sing "All My Life," which proves to
be a severe trial for her. On the other hand, Hawn, Alda, Norton and
Roth seem to take to this kind of froth quite naturally. Norton is
particularly winning as he romps through a jewelry store to the tune of
"My Baby Just Cares For Me" and attempts to surprise Skylar with an
engagement ring hidden inside her meal at a chic eatery.</P>
<P> Interestingly, considering the movie's desire to go for big
effects, its best moments are its quieter ones, such as the truly
hilarious resolution of the conflict between liberals Steffi and Bob and
their ultraconservative son (Lukas Haas) or the genuinely sweet
unresolved relationship between Joe and Steffi, which is unfortunately
ignored until the last minutes of the film.</P>
<P> It should also be noted the movie's ridiculously harsh R-rating
derives from one word, used as a joke. The rest of "Everyone Says I Love
You" is every bit as wholesome and squeaky clean as any given Ruby
Keeler vehicle. James Sanford</P>
