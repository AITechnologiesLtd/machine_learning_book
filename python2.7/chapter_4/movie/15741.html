<P>_You've_Got_Mail_ (PG) **** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Of all the delights to be had while watching the enchanting romantic
comedy _You've_Got_Mail_, none gave me more joy than the performance of
co-lead Meg Ryan.  The reigning queen of romantic comedy, Ryan, not so
surprisingly, delivers another turn of irresistible charm as bookstore
owner Kathleen Kelly.  But what I paid conscious attention to this time
around was the ease with which she tackles the deceptively simple-looking
job of romantic comedienne.  It's no easy task to project a natural blend
of sweetness, strength, wit, and genuine, hard-earned heart, yet Ryan has
effortlessly pulled it off year after year, in movie after movie--without
ever receiving her rightful recognition from the critics.</P>
<P>Sadly, _You've_Got_Mail_ will likely not change that, but that's mostly
because so much of the film is so good.  The film reunites Ryan with her
_Sleepless_in_Seattle_ partners Tom Hanks and director/co-writer (with
sister Delia) Nora Ephron in a plot that, not so coincidentally, appears to
be a variation of that 1993 blockbuster.  Ryan's Kathleen owns the small
children's bookstore The Shop Around the Corner, whose long life as a
Manhattan neighborhood staple is threatened by the nearby opening of a
Barnes and Noble-like superstore called Fox Books, owned by wealthy Joe Fox
(Hanks).  Naturally, it's hate at first sight for Joe and Kathleen, but
little do they know that appears to be their first meeting really
isn't--they have anonymously been conducting a romance over the Internet as
"NY152" (Joe) and "Shopgirl" (Kathleen).</P>
<P>Now, it would have been easy--and completely understandable--for the
Ephrons to completely mirror _Sleepless_'s proven formula to the letter,
but they manage to come up with some wrinkles that are often as
unpredictable as they are funny.  The biggest deviation from _Sleepless_ is
the increased interaction of Hanks and Ryan, who spent most of their last
collaboration apart--which called into question if the two truly had any
chemistry.  _Mail_ proves once and for all that Hanks and Ryan are a screen
duo for the ages, equally convincing trading comic barbs or longing
glances.  Their sparring sessions have real bite, and their more mellow
moments are so warmly tender that only the coldest hearts won't be at least
slightly moved.</P>
<P>This isn't to say that the film doesn't make a concession to what has
become the Ryan romantic comedy formula--namely, a man she is already
attached to, here in the form of Greg Kinnear's politically-minded reporter
Frank Navasky.  The new rub here is that Frank, while a bit stuck on
himself, is a nice guy and a much more appealing romantic choice than
ruthless businessman Joe, who, in turn, already has a partner of his own:
Patricia Eden (Parker Posey), who works at a publishing house.  While the
nice and perky Kathleen is clearly better than the ever-frantic Patricia,
it is easy to see why Joe would be with her; her high social station makes
for a "comfortable" choice, and it is in line with his hard-as-nails
attitude--which, of course, hides the truly gentle soul that he bears only
to "Shopgirl."</P>
<P>Similarly, Hanks does a bang-up job playing (to use Joe's term) a "pill,"
but he has a natural gentleness that he buries just deep enough and
gradually brings to surface as the film progresses.  Ephron has said that
_Mail_'s central question is "Can Mr. Wrong turn out to be Mr. Right?" and
that evolution is made involving and convincing by Hanks, who instead of
making Joe's progression from black to white, makes it a more realistic
shift between opposite shades of grey.</P>
<P>Again, though, _Mail_ is ultimately the glowing Ryan's show.  Her Kathleen
is fun and more than a little (hilariously) pathetic at times, but her
flightiness is grounded in real, complex emotion.   This is especially the
case in one late shot of her face, which displays surprise, disgust, anger,
and ecstatic, teary delight--all in a matter of seconds.  If that's not a
difficult acting task, I don't know what is--and it comes to Ryan as second
nature.</P>
<P>Cynics will probably dismiss _You've_Got_Mail_ as disposable fluff for
suckers for shamelessly romantic hokum.  If that truly is the case--and,
admittedly, there's no evidence to suggest otherwise--then I wear the title
of "sucker" with pride.</P>
