<PRE>                       ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     Ace Ventura, a guy with an outlandish Hawaiian shirt and long side
burns, has nothing but bad hair days.  Without any of the refinements
he has shown in some of his latter films, Jim Carrey, as Ace Ventura,
keeps the humor in this one insufferably crude.  The first Ace film in
hopefully a short series is called ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE.  Never
has a film been less in need of a sequel than this one, but after
making over a hundred million dollars in 1994, there has, regrettably,
already been one sequel.</P>
<P>     In need of a better script than the one by Jack Bernstein, Carrey,
and the director, Tom Shadyac, Carrey struts his stuff without
restraint.  The director lets Carrey run wild, which in Carrey's case
is a dangerous thing to do.  Carrey is an undeniable comedic genius but
one in need of control.  As proof of how good Carrey can be, consider
his relatively more restrained performances in LIAR, LIAR and THE MASK.</P>
<P>     Typical of the crude bathroom humor in ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE
is a scene of Ace bending over and manipulating his rear in a sick form
of ventriloquism. The rest of the movie is the same, ad nauseam.</P>
<P>     To the extent that the movie has a plot, it involves Ace, loud
mouthed, pet detective extraordinaire, in search of a professional
football team's dolphin mascot, which was stolen two weeks before the
Super Bowl.  The team uses Ace to track down the animal.</P>
<P>     The script is devoid of ideas, and the movie plays as if it were
one long ad lib routine by Carrey.  Sean Young, who, since her one
excellent part in NO WAY OUT, gives her usual forgettably bad
performance, this time as a police detective.  She and all of the other
actors provide little more than a backdrop for Carrey's showing off.
ACE VENTURA has one memorable scene -- the ending credits, which bring
blessed relief.</P>
<P>     ACE VENTURA PET DETECTIVE runs 1:26.  It is rated PG-13 for
profanity, nudity, and crude sexual humor.  The movie would be
acceptable for most kids ten and up.</P>
<P><HR>     My son Jeffrey, age 8 1/2, said he really liked it and especially
thought Ace was funny.  He volunteered that he believed the movie
should be for kids 10 and up because of the sex stuff in it.</P>
