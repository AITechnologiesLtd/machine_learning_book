<PRE>                                 FINAL ANALYSIS
                       A film review by Sunil Ramchandani
                        Copyright 1992 Sunil Ramchandani</PRE>
<P>Starring Richard Gere, Kim Basinger, Uma Thurman, Eric Roberts,
         and Keith David</P>
<P>     Take two of the hottest stars in Hollywood today, throw in some
steamy moments between them, add a dash of deception, some wry humor,
some violence, all to a base which is distinctly Hitchcockian in flavor,
and you have Final Analysis.  No, no it isn't all that simple as it
sounds.  What starts of as a very pretentious and seemingly over
sophisticated film shifts into just the right gear midway and doesn't
stop till the finish.</P>
<P>     Richard Gere plays a Bay Area psychiatrist who while treating one
of his patients (played by Uma Thurman) falls in love with her sister
(played by Kim Basinger).  As Gere plays hooky for the first time in a
couple years,  and courts Basinger around the scenic Bay and in a
deserted, crumbling  lighthouse, things seem picture perfect, save for
the fact that Basinger  is married to an insanely jealous Eric Roberts,
a role played very adroitly.  In this cameo as Jim Evans, Roberts
displays a great flair for panache, and comes across as a very ruthless
and chilling character -- just right.</P>
<P>     Some scenic shots of the Bay were craftfully done, good
cinematography.  The background score was excellent, especially towards
the end.  Of the performances, Richard Gere sleepwalks through most of
his role (I still feel that his *best* performances to date were in the
films BREATHLESS, INTERNAL AFFAIRS, and AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN -- in
that order).  Uma Thurman as the mentally disturbed patient is
appealing, very vulnerable at most times, quite impulsive and morose
during others, and extremely pretty.  Basinger is a brilliant surprise,
and Keith David as the detective is excellent.  Unfortunately though,
the screenplay has some holes and lacks spirit and creativity, very
uninspiring.</P>
<P>     Overall, the movie makes for an entertaining evening.  See it, if a
suspense thriller is your cup of tea.  </P>
