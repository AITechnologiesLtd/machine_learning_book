<PRE>SPHERE
RATING:  6.5 / 10 --> So-so</PRE>

<P>Three big name actors, Hoffman, Jackson and Stone, one big name author,
Michael Crichton, and one big name director, Barry Levinson, get
together and create an underwater science-fiction movie called SPHERE.
Just imagine THE THING (8/10) meeting ALIEN (7.5/10) in THE ABYSS.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Underwater spacecraft in uncovered by the U.S. government, and four
relevant experts in their respective fields are sent down to
investigate the unknown entity. Once beneath the ocean, the group makes
contact with a source from within the vessel, and attempt to piece
together the mystery that is the sphere inside the unexplained
discovery. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Cool premise and eerie buildup from the first hour, ultimately
downshifts into an unsatisfying film that drags long past its bedtime,
and turns into a gobbledygook of psychological head games and
illusions. Add to that the loss of coherency about halfway, and a major
anticlimactic ending, and I can't really say that I thoroughly enjoyed
this two-hour plus piece of celluloid. Which is all too bad, because I
really liked the first hour, especially the whole claustrophobic feel
of the group underwater with the unknown swimming all about them. </P>
<P>The actors all play their cards real well, with Schreiber pulling off a
good performance as the egghead astrophysicist, and Sam Jackson coming
through as the hairless mathematician with the uneven glimmer in his
eye. Stone was also pretty good, but nothing special could be said
about Hoffman's by the numbers "nervous dude" character, whose
umpteenth performance he seemed to be calling in from his home. And
despite Levinson creating some real suspense early on, the overall feel
of the picture was quite uneven, along with the absence of a gentleman
by the name of style.</P>
<P>Overall, this movie did offer some suspenseful and potentially potent
scenes early on, but by the end of this overly long picture, I just
felt like a kid who'd been staring at a nacho plate all evening, only
to have it taken away at the last minute by a grumpy old man with a
crutch. The ending is lame and confusing, the payoff from the early
decent premise never really comes through, and the clock ticks at least
thirty minutes past its due time. Having said that, the performances
are decent, and the early tension and suspense of the film is enough
for me to recommend it for at least one night of dark, moody
strangeness and confusion. </P>
<P>Note to nacho-platers: Don't waste your salsa on this one. Slap some
sour cream on the side, and you should be okay.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
In the 1970's, Barry Levinson wrote for "The Carol Burnett Show", and
won two Emmies in three years. Levinson also co-wrote the script for
Norman Jewison's Al Pacino vehicle ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL with his
then-wife Valerie Curtin. Interesting to note that in all of his films,
Levinson has featured character actor Ralph Tabakin in a small role.
Did you know that Sharon Stone's IQ is 154, and that she is a member of
MENSA? In 1986, Sharon was in a TV commercial for Seagrams 7 Golden
Wine Cooler with fellow struggling actor at the time, Bruce Willis.
Sharon also appeared on TV's "Star Search" as a contestant in the
spokesmodel category in the mid-80's. Her payday for her breakthrough
hit BASIC INSTINCT (7.5/10) was $750,000. 
Dustin Hoffman stands 5"5, and made $17,000 for his breakthrough
performance in THE GRADUATE (6/10).
Peter Coyote's real name is Peter Cohon.</P>
