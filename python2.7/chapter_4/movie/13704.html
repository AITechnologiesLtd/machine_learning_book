<PRE>Saving Private Ryan (1998)
7/30/98
Review by Billy Newsom</PRE>
<P>This movie gave me a headache!  The photography, I must tell you, is unique. 
The camera is never still during battle scenes.  It made me nauseous watching a
70' screen shake as the cameraman follows soldiers around a battle scene. 
Spielberg purposelessly made the camera vibrate rather than damping it, a la
Shaky Cam.  If Spielberg likes this effect, I don't.  Not for every single shot
in every single battle.</P>
<P>Besides poor camera work, the plot was somewhat thin.  It was a complex plot for
a war movie, but it was still lacking.  I would give the screenwriting a "C"
only because there was some good comic relief.  But the entire movie was so
predictable, that the length (over two hours) made the movie languish.  Toward
the end, all I wanted was for the men to find Ryan, finish their little war
game, and send him home -- so I could go home.</P>
<P>The characters, well, what can I say.  They are stereotypes, what the movie
script writers call "composite" characters.  The guy who freezes up.  The guy
whose every other line is a half-audible prayer.  The intellectual.  The guy
who's the gung-ho no-frills ground-pounder.  The guy everyone looks up to.</P>
<P>I could almost see the script as I watched the film.  It was because the
characters, even though they are well-developed, are still one dimensional. 
They are almost completely static, too.</P>
<P>Outstanding directing, average screenwriting, excellent realism and effects,
average music, and superb sound make this movie one of the best of 1998.  But I
watched this movie the same day as I saw Gone With the Wind, and I'm sorry,
there's just no comparison.  7 out of 10.  Go see Vivien Leigh again.</P>
<PRE>Post Review addition:</PRE>
<P>This movie is going to be awesome on DVD.  I hope that I can get used to the
shaky camera tricks on a 4' screen.  But I'm really looking forward to those
booming artillery shells -- I want to make my neighbors think that a war is
going on in my house!  But to be honest, this movie must be seen and heard in a
movie theater to get the full effect.  Just bring some Dramamine or Tylenol.</P>
<P>People seem to think that the gore in this movie can make up for its weak
storyline.  Sorry, it just can't.  The gore didn't keep me interested like a
plot would have.  A bad trade-off, in my opinion.</P>
