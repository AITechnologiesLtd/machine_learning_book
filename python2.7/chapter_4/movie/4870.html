(inoffensive sexual language)</P>
<P>In 1978, Edouard Molinaro, a French journeyman director, had
his biggest international hit with the gay-themed "La Cage aux
Folles." In 1980 he made a lesser sequel. A third "La
Cage...," weak, irrelevant and directed by Georges Lautner,
came out in 1985. </P>
<P>The milking of the cash-cow through remakes and sequels is
common in the world's film industry but nowhere as frequent as
in US cinema. Hollywood, first and foremost re-does its own
movies. In second place, far outdistancing the rest of foreign
sources, comes a long list of American versions of French
movies.</P>
<P>It is axiomatic that, with rare exceptions, remakes and
sequels are artistically far inferior to the originals.
Box-office profits can be high, however.</P>
<P>This said, "The Birdcage" does a good job of Americanizing and
updating "La Cage aux Folles," and following the original's
plot almost step-by-step, down to details.</P>
<P>In both movies a longtime gay couple run a gay nightclub,   
respectively in St.Tropez ("La Cage") and in Miami's South
Beach ("The Birdcage").</P>
<P>The American pair are Armand (Robin Williams) who owns and
runs the club, and drag queen Albert(Nathan Lane),its star
performer. An unexpected big rock disturbs the peace of the
high-pitched but essentially contented pond when 20-year old
Val--Armand's accidental (and straight) son from his one and
only sexual experience with a woman,--announces that he will
marry 18-year old Barbara. It happens that she is the daughter
of Senator Keeley (Gene Hackman), R-Ohio, the very rightist
co-founder and Vice-Chairman of the Coalition for Moral Order.</P>
<P>The Senator is running for re-election. Suddenly he is all
over the media. His sidekick Senator Jackson, the Coalition's
President and other founder, has dropped dead in the bed of an
underage black prostitute. "Black!" exclaims Senator Keeley,
as this were the straw that broke the camel's back.</P>
<P>(For the French viewers of "La Cage" it was a clear reference
to the notorious case of a President of the French Republic.
In 1899, Felix Faure suddenly died in his bed while exerting
himself with a habitual guest, an upper-level courtesan. To
make matters worse, the bed was at the Elysee Palace, the
Presidential residence. The scandal, fanned by politicians,
had major repercussions--but this did not prevent a major
street of Paris and a Metro station to be named after
Mr.Faure).</P>
<P>Fleeing the press, Mr., Mrs. (Dianne Wiest) and Miss Keeley
drive to Florida to meet the family of Val, whose father is
vaguely described by Barbara as "a cultural attache'."</P>
<P>Val is the apple of the couple's eyes. He loves his father and
his "mother"(Albert) and is totally at ease with their
homosexuality and lifestyles. But the senatorial visit calls
for drastic measures, for an impossible job of camouflaging
the gays as straights. The deceits become the center of the
movie, complete with mascarades, confusions, double-entendres,
gags, jokes, and quid pro quos.</P>
<P>"The Birdcage" is a funny film. It opens cleverly with a long,
swooping shot that takes us from the sea, past the beach, to
the street and inside the club. Those places teem with people,
mostly minimally clad. More street shots will are added
throughout the film. They baffled me at times as South Beach
is supposed to be a gay hangout yet it gave me the impression
of being laden with straight couples too. Was this done in
order not to alienate a conservative public? To single out the
protagonists? </P>
<P>After this good start comes the interior of the club, with a 
dancing drag chorus singing the interminable and dull "We are
Family." In the subsequent early parts, the tempo drags
compared to what I remember of "La Cage" but picks up fairly
soon and keeps its energy.</P>
<P>I felt rather uneasy with the portrayal of gays, mostly the
flamboyant, self-absorbed and self-pitying Nathan Lane as "a
screaming queen"--his own words. Think how "un-queenly"
Terence Stamp was off-stage in "The Adventures of
Priscilla..." and the cliches or caricatures in "The Bird
Cage" jump out at you. However,Lane does his shtick very well. </P>
<P>There was also much more feeling and warmth in "La Cage,"
especially between the two partners/lovers and in their
rapport with Val.</P>
<P>The US version will no doubt delight a public that's looking
for something other than screen mayhem or dumb and dumber
comedies for mindless teens. Almost certainly it will cause an
outcry in some quarters. The first salvo has already been
fired in an interesting article by cultural critic Bruce
Bawer, in the New York Times of March 10: "Why Does Hollywood
Continue to Get Gay Life Wrong?"</P>
<P>Though disinclined to add fuel to the fire, I must point out
that "The Birdcage, "while true to the events of "La Cage,"
deviates in spirit. It takes something away from the French
matter-of-fact and affectionate mood, replacing it with over
the top political satire. Curiously, the understanding of gay
life in the less "evolved" and more "in the closet" days of
1978 had empathy that the 1996 "Bird" lacks. It is as though
the dates had been switched.</P>
<P>The no-holds-barred mocking of Senator Keeley is a
diversionary tactic that could not have been better timed,
given the nature and hollow speeches of politicians on the
campaign trail in the pre-election, 1996 United States. The
ridicule is far stronger and more topical than in the original
since in Europe, then as now, the Moral Order thing has been
seen as a risible quirk rather than the force it is in this
country.</P>
<P>The gap between gays and the Keeley couple is made even wider
because we seem to have dirtier minds than denizens of many
other lands. There, ordinary people leer much less than we do.
Think of the casualness with which nudity has been treated for
decades in European life and media, as opposed to the
prudishness of our film ratings, while at the same time sex is
blatantly exploited in the media for selling products and
services.</P>
<P>Note too than in "Bird" the outrageous Agador (the Latino male
maid) and Albert are shown as quite dumb. Still, they are
small potatoes compared to Mr. and Mrs. Keeley who, in plain
language, are plain idiots (she doesn't even know what a
cultural attache' is)... and very funny in their naivete'.</P>
<P>It's all most unreal, always at someone's expense. Yet here
comes the big BUT. As the Birdcagers are preparing for the
Senator's family (in impossibly record time), Val instructs
Armand on heterosexual procedures from changing the decor to
changing behavior. In turn Armand instructs Albert. Scenes
that could be or are offensive can also be very comical, as
when Albert is schooled in how to speak or how to put spread
on toast. A hilarious moment is the illustration of John
Wayne's walk, which, we realize, is weirder than we ever
suspected. </P>
<P>Then, in the key scenes of the meeting of the two families,   
scripter Elaine May reaches comedic heights simply with the
Senator's attempts at small-talk. Another telling touch comes
when  Keeley learns that Val's parents are gay ...  and Jewish
to boot. His reaction: "You can't be Jewish!!!"</P>
<P>Verbal and physical farce distract the viewer from the movie's
more reprehensible aspects. So does the outrageous,
well-orchestrated ensemble acting. The hardest role belongs to
Robin Williams. This once, he acts well below the top, in 
rather sober, straight-man fashion. He does not conceal from
us his gayness,but he does not flaunt it.</P>
<P>No matter what the resistance to "The Birdcage" might be, the
movie's key and kernel lies in one fleeting sentence. Speaking
to Armand about his plans and college life, Val says:"I have a
role model. I'm the only guy in my fraternity who doesn't come
from a broken home." I wish this had been underlined by the
remake, as in the French model. </P>
