<P>   The Danes--God bless 'em--put most of Nazi-occupied
Europe to shame during The War by cheerfully delivering all
their country's Jews from Hitler's morons.  It's difficult to see
that these marvelous people with their wonderful, wonderful
Copenhagen might have flaws.  But as Lars von Trier and
Thomas Vinterberg have already apprised us with their "The
Kingdom" and "Celebration," simply erect walls around
people, call the units families, and they suffer from the same
dysfunctionality as America's own Lester and Carolyn
Burnham.</P>
<P>   Soren Kragh-Jacobsen takes on the role of a melancholy
Dane as he relates a story that's as darkly humorous as
"American Beauty" but perhaps more attuned to a Danish
audience--which can catch the subtleties of their own
language rather than having to depend on a decent but
unpoetic set of English subtitles.  Anders Thomas Jensen and
Kragh-Jacobsen's tale embraces two themes: one is that you
can take the farmer out of the country, but you can't take the
country out of the farmer.  The other, more resonant, is that
the best relationships occur when two people know about
each other's sordid pasts (and we all have them, don't we)
and yet accept each other for what they are.  "Mifunes sidste
sang," which translates as "Mifune's Last Song," takes its title
from a character played by the late great Japanese actor,
Toshiro Mifune, in Akira Kurosawa's monumental "The Seven
Samurai."  Mifune performs in the role of a man who
assumes the title of samurai despite his peasant background. 
Similarly Kresten (Anders W. Berthelsen), an upwardly mobile
man of about 30, marries the boss's daughter Claire (Sofie
Grabol) and, passing himself off as a middle-class resident of
Copenhagen, conveniently hides from her his own ignoble
background.  </P>
<P>   Not that Kresten is a bad guy.  It's just that he comes from
lower-class stock in the sticks of Denmark, having been
raised in a run-down farmhouse with a few scrawny hens and
a mentally challenged brother, Rud (Jesper Asholt).  That's
not all. His mother had committed suicide without leaving a
note, but we can bet that her surroundings played no small
part in her decision.  Just days after his marriage he gets a
call to return home.  His dad had died.  He must arrange for
a decent funeral and, more important, decide what to do with
his retarded brother--all the while keeping his wife in the dark
about where he was going.  Hiring a beautiful housekeeper,
Liva (Iben Hjele) to take care of his sibling, he is similarly in
the dark about her own background as a hooker.  When
Liva's snotty brother Bjarke (Emil Tarding) is kicked out of
school and joins the group of misfits, the plot get more
complicated: funnier and sadder in equal proportions.</P>
<P>   "Mifune" is a well-acted tale which purportedly follows the
Dogma collective founded by Thomas Vinterberg and Lars
von Trier--a film theory that eschews the use of artificial
lighting, heavy cranes and equipment, artificial sets, and even
music on the soundtrack (unless the music is part of the
scene).  The philosophy holds that "we can't beat the
Americans anyway, so we Europeans should head in another
direction."  Fortunately, Kragh-Jacobsen doesn't take the
dogma ideas too seriously, thus avoiding what could have
been the film equivalent of the socialist realism school of the
1930s in the Soviet Union.  We do get music, at least one
birds'-eye shot, and most important a convincing
representation of the madcap adventures of a poor,
handsome guy who discovers that lying to your partner leads
only to divorce.  Find yourself a partner who doesn't care that
you got breakfast directly from your own hens or that you turn
tricks to help put your brother through a fancy prep school.  </P>
<P>   "Mifune" shows a bit too much of Rud the rain man, who
doesn't have a heck of a lot of variety to his expressions and
vocabulary, but aside from that this is an intelligent,
passionate, occasionally violent film that throws in some real
surprises--like the strange farmhouse visitor who plays
flamenco guitar like Carlos Montoya.  The picture illustrates
an off-again, on-again relationship between Liva and Kresten
that will have you rooting for their final get-together while
thumbing your nose at the bourgeois wife back in
Copenhagen--who's going to miss the massive orgasms that
her soon-to-be-divorced husband is graphically shown
providing for her. "Mifune" is Denmark's entry into the
upcoming Oscar competition for best foreign language film.</P>
