<P>There are two kinds of people in this world: those who like Adam Sandler
movies and those who don't. I dig his humor, have enjoyed most of his films
and consider HAPPY GILMORE as my personal favorite. I don't believe him to
be the messiah of comedy or anything, but the man makes me laugh, and that's
the bottom line. What I've never seemed to understand is all of those people
who claim to hate him but still go to see his movies. Uhhhhm, what's up with
that?! If you don't like the music, change the station, right? But crappy
trailer and initially annoying voice aside, this film continues the Sandler
tradition of comedy, so if you know that going in and enjoy that type of
thing, you might as well check this one out as well. And if you don't like
Sandler, well...just stop reading this right now.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Satan has three sons. Two of them betray daddy dearest and take their
evilness to Earth. The third son, the shy, timid boy, must now go to Earth
and bring back his siblings before they take over their father's reign.
While in New York, the third son meets a nice girl and begins to feel a lot
more human.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Some of the juvenile, over-the-top, stupid humor in this movie is very
funny, and some of it is not. If you have never been a fan of "Adam Sandler"
movies, don't bother seeing this one, because it certainly won't make you
change your mind about the man or his humor. I personally enjoy most of his
films and his persona, and would rate this film as one of his more ambitious
endeavors, but far from his most entertaining. Add to that the fact that
this film has obviously been written by a few guys smokin' a lot of weed,
and you've got the added bonus of many major "head trip" scenes. In fact,
there are many things in this movie that are just so over the top, that
you're either gonna laugh your head off or dismiss it all as crap on a
stick. A man who grows breasts on top of his head. Adam Sandler breaking
apart and transforming into a million little spiders with little Adam
Sandler heads on all of them. A dog shown "doggying" another dog. For me,
some of it was pretty hilarious, and some of it...so-so. Overall, the film
did entertain me enough to recommend to Sandler fans looking for a little
variety from the guy. Here he's taken his sweet, man-child character that he
plays in all of his movies, and placed him inside a preposterous plot
involving his father Satan, a talking dog and the greatest product placement
advertisement ever used in film! But unlike all of his other films, this one
focuses much more on the special effects, which is why it might have lacked
more of the big laugh-out scenes.</P>
<P>Another aspect of the film which others may not like as much as I did, is
the soundtrack, which was filled, and I mean filled with heavy tunes. Not
everyone's taste, I know. I also really liked all of the cameos in this
movie, and boy, were there ever a bunch! It seemed as though almost every
member of the Saturday Night Live cast from Christmas past made an
appearance somewhere in this film (including Chris Farley, who gets a nice
posthumous homage near the end of the flick), and even some characters from
previous Sandler films. Rodney Dangerfield was tops as the father of Satan,
"Even in hell, I get no respect!" For the most part, I went with all of the
over-the-top stuff, but some of it just didn't work for me. I didn't think
the Quentin Tarantino character was funny at all, and the talking dog also
didn't pie my piper. I did really like the angels in Heaven, which was a
great scene, with kudos to Reese Witherspoon for taking such a small role
and having a lot of fun with it. She played it perfectly. So overall, I
guess I'm torn here, folks. I would definitely not suggest that any
non-Sandler fans see this movie, because deep down, it's still the same ol'
Sandler humor, but I would mildly recommend it to fans of the goof.</P>
<P>One thing that will definitely help you appreciate some of the more
outrageous happenings in this movie is the addition of Mary and Jane to your
person. The film is just soooooo out there at times! But sober or chemically
"enlightened", this film does have enough funny to make for some good times
for most Sandler fans. By the way, am I the only one who is hungry for some
Popeye's chicken right about now?</P>
