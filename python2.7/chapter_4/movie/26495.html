<P>You can't help but go into a movie like this one with low expectations. Here
we are, up to our umpteenth "devil" thriller of the past two years, and
still, Hollywood keeps churning them out like there's no tomorrow. But with
this film, we have reason to expect even less. It was originally supposed to
be released in October 1999, and has basically been sitting on the shelf
ever since. So is it as stinky as many of the others? Does it provide for
any type of entertainment value whatsoever? Stick around...</P>
<P>PLOT:
A best-selling author has apparently been chosen by Satan to become his
physical vehicle to return to earth. A young woman, who herself once went
through an exorcism of her own, takes it upon herself to try and convince
the skeptic writer of his oncoming doom. Will they be able to save the young
man in time or will Satan come back to earth and kick mighty human ass?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Despite its lame title, general feeling of deja-vu and somewhat slow pace, I
enjoyed this film based on its interesting script, abundance of creepy
atmosphere, grungy look and neat-o ending. Yes, I'm as sick of "satanic
thrillers" as the next guy, but all things considered, this movie kept me
interested pretty much the whole way through, and that's a mighty big chore
at this point. It didn't have any major plot holes, it had a very believable
character in the lead, one Ben Chaplin, and it didn't bog the story down
with all kinds of biblical mumbo jumbo. The one thing that did surprise me
about this film was its lack of MTV-ness. I say that only because its
trailer makes it look like yet another thrill-a-minute, split-second edited,
soundtrack enhanced disposable horror movie, but that is far from what we
have here. This movie doesn't have any fake scares. It doesn't play the
latest "teen band" on the soundtrack and it doesn't feature any nutballs in
masks. It's eerie, features a dark look and muddled cinematography, saddled
up to an appropriately brooding score and exorcisms galore (nice timing on
the release, guys...just as THE EXORCIST is scaring up the youngens in the
theatres).</P>
<P>I liked this movie because it was able to pull me into its world and make me
a believer. Forget BLESS THE CHILD and END OF DAYS, movies featuring name
actors hopping around plot holes left and right. Ben Chaplin won me over in
this film. He turns out to be the poor chap who is about to be taken over by
Satan himself, and as you would expect, he's quite distraught by the
thought. A couple of scenes from this film even managed to stick in my mind,
especially one really great scene early on featuring a bathroom which
suddenly becomes...well, possessed of sorts. A highly stylized film. I
suppose that the story could've benefited from a few more "thrilling"
moments, and certainly been cut by about ten minutes in the middle, but all
in all, this late entry into the satanic world of Hollywood thrillers,
generally held my attention. Winona Ryder, I could've done without, but
kudos to Chaplin for convincing me of the possibility of his dilemma. I look
forward to seeing what director Janusz Kaminski will take on next. Not a
film that will win over the MTV generation, but definitely a decent creepy
thriller that'll keep you on your toes while cuddled under a blanket, late
at night, all by yourself. Far from being a classic, but decent as a
stylishly passable concoction.</P>
<P>Little Known facts about this film and its stars:
This is director Janusz Kaminski's directorial debut. He is best known as a
cinematographer. His previous work on SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and SCHINLDER'S
LIST have won him Oscars in cinematography. He is currently doing the
cinematography for Steven Spielberg's next project entitled A.I. He was also
the cinematographer on JERRY MAGUIRE, LOST WORLD and AMISTAD.
This film was originally slated for an October 1999 release but was held
back due to concern over too many similarly themed movies coming out around
that same time (STIGMATA, END OF DAYS, BLESS THE CHILD).
Alfre Woodard has an uncredited role in this film as the head nurse of the
prison.
Actress Meg Ryan is one of the producers of this film. How that happened is
beyond me!</P>
