<PRE>                            MOULIN ROUGE
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: MOULIN ROUGE begins with a sensory
          overload of images and fast cutting to create an
          exuberant and viscerally exciting view of the
          bohemian life in Paris of a century ago.  The
          flush and excitement of experiencing 1900 Paris
          is surreally exaggerated.  After thirty minutes
          or so the pace slackens a bit, but much of the
          style remains.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor
          star as an expensive courtesan and the young
          writer who loves her.  The film is hypnotic and
          entrancing.  The first half-hour is worth the
          price of admission all by itself.  Rating: 7 (0
          to 10), +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     In making love or in making musicals, you must never doubt your
own abilities.  Once you become self-conscious about how to do it,
you probably cannot any more.  The United States once was unexcelled
at making musicals, from Busby Berkeley to Rogers and Hammerstein
this made lots and most of the best.  Now the feature-length musical
has nearly died in the US except for some weak efforts in recent
years to bring it back.  Woody Allen's EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU was
really a feeble attempt at dabbling in the genre.  More recently
there have been somewhat more successful attempts at the edges of
the genre with SOUTH PARK and O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?  On the
other hand, in Australia when it seems appropriate to make a musical
they just dive into it with the apparent natural ease of Rooney and
Garland saying, "Hey, let's put on a show."  Baz Luhrmann, with the
musical STRICTLY BALLROOM under his belt already, dives in with not
just ease but gusto to make the fabulous musical MOULIN ROUGE.  Set
in 1900 Paris, the beauty of the women, the weird characters, the
glamour the fin-de-siecle exuberance are presented in an explosion
of sensory overload.  Luhrmann does some really extraordinary things
with this film.  I like a director who does something unusual those
now boring studio banners at the beginning of the film.  It is a way
to announce that this will be a creative film from the very first
frame.  Luhrmann has some fun with the Fox logo and theme and right
away the viewer realizes this is a film that will have his eyes
glued to the screen.</P>
<P>     The plotting is somewhat familiar, but then most musicals do
not have a really strong plot.  Luhrmann, who both co-writes and
directs, opens the film with a half-hour or more of high-energy
excitement.  We start with fledgling writer, Christian (played by
Ewan McGregor) coming to Paris over his father's objections.  Almost
immediately he has an unconscious Argentinean fall through his
ceiling and in moments is embroiled in writing for the film's title
nitery a show called "Spectacular. Spectacular."  The star of the
show will be singer, courtesan, and toast of Paris, Satine (Nicole
Kidman).  The new show has been created by a small team of artists
led by the diminutive giant Toulouse Lautrec (John Leguizamo) under
the control of the impresario Zidler (Jim Broadbent having a field
day).  This first night Satine is scheduled to seduce the possible
producer for Spectacular Spectacular, the Duke of Worcestor (Richard
Roxburgh), but through a mistake in identity she seduces Christian
instead.  Being young and impressionable he stays seduced and in
love.  But the duke expects that he will get Satine as part of the
deal of producing the play.  From there the story borrows several
plot highlights from Alexander Dumas's CAMILLE.</P>
<P>     The film is marvelously inventive throughout, though after the
first half-hour it slows considerably.  Touches of that first rush
include a terrific visualization of the Green Fairy said to live in
bottles of that green (and literally toxic) intoxicant, absinthe.
The film remains a tribute to Paris and the extravagant musical
throughout, popular in Paris in the 19th and early 20th Century.
Luhrmann uses music not from the period but more modern and familiar
melodies choosing as the centerpiece a peculiar choice, "There Was a
Boy" from the film THE BOY WITH GREEN HAIR.</P>
<P>     The film features a standout performance by Nicole Kidman in a
role that seemed made for her.  She is an icon playing an icon, and
playing it to the hilt.  Ewan McGregor, of TRAINSPOTTING and the
screen's new Obi-Wan Kenobi is more than passable as the film's
lead, though his singing is obviously overdubbed.  Kidman does her
own singing and does it as well as any professional.  Jim Broadbent
is delicious as the strutting and high-stepping impresario Zidler.
Even the frequently irritating John Leguizamo does nicely as
Lautrec.  He does not seem French, of course, but then nobody else
in the cast does either.</P>
<P>     I can list on the fingers of one hand the set of musicals I
actually like as musicals.  I like FIDDLER ON THE ROOF, ROCKY HORROR
PICTURE SHOW, CABARET, and very few others.  Most musicals I bide my
time and wait for the singing to be over.  This is a bide-my-time
sort of musical, but it has its share of other rewards.  Even I can
appreciate its tributes to the stage and screen musical.  I rate it
a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
