                    "THE BIG HIT" (USA, 1998)
                 A Film Review by James Kendrick
                         * (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Director: Che-Kirk Wong || Screenplay: Ben Ramsey || Stars: Mark
Wahlberg (Melvin Smiley), Lou Diamond Phillips (Cisco), Christina
Applegate (Pam Schulman), Avery Brooks (Paris), Bokeem Woodbine
(Crunch), Lela Rochon (Chantel), China Chow (Keiko Nishi), Sab
Shimono (Jiro Nishi), Robin Dunne (Gump) || MPAA Rating: R</P>
<P>There are scenes in "The Big Hit" that are so awful, they simply
defy description. The movie is infected with the same kind of
blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made "Last
Action Hero" (1993) such a chore to sit through.</P>
<P>Presumably, "The Big Hit" is an action-comedy, a difficult but
not impossible genre to pull off. Movies of this sort require a
fine balance and careful tone, and the comedy is usually meant to
work as catharsis for the violence. "Lethal Weapon 2" (1989) is a
perfect example of an action thriller that was also very, very
funny. Unfortunately, in "The Big Hit," it seems that comedy is
the main motive, and the violence is only intended to punctuate
the laughs. Unfortunately, there are no laughs.</P>
<P>The movie resembles some of the goofy, throwaway ridiculousness
of early Jackie Chan films, but it doesn't benefit from Chan's
incredible stunts and goofy, charismatic presence. Instead, we
are left with a lot of digital effects and Mark Wahlberg, who
must have considered himself invincible after his
critically-acclaimed performance in last year's "Boogie Nights."
However, if he wants to maintain a decent career, he had better
start selecting his projects more carefully - movies like this
are a sure-fire recipe for a long career in the straight-to-video
market.</P>
<P>Wahlberg plays Melvin Smiley, an amiable guy who also happens to
be a professional hitman (see "Grosse Pointe Blank" for the same
character, much better developed). The movie wants us to think,
"Gee how clever and ironic - a guy who can kill without any moral
implications, and yet he can't stand for anyone not to like him."
The fact is, Melvin is so desperate to keep people from not
liking him, that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee
(Christina Applegate, with a horrendous New York accent) and an
abusive girlfriend (Lela Rochon ) who is only using him for his
money. His constant bending over backwards to please people makes
him a complete patsy at best, and a thoroughly unbelievable
character at worst.</P>
<P>Melvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named Paris (Avery
Brooks) as part of a team of hitmen, which also includes Cisco
(Lou Diamond Phillips) and Crunch (Bokeem Woodbine). One day,
Melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with Cisco by kidnapping
the teenage daughter of a rich Japanese mogul named Jiro Nishi
(Sab Shimono) for a million dollar ransom.</P>
<P>However, not only has Jiro Nishi lost all his money producing a
big Hollywood movie (inside joke, get it?), but his kidnapped
daughter, Keiko (China Chow), also happens to be Paris'
goddaughter. So, when Paris finds out she's been kidnapped, he
takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did
it. Not knowing the Cisco is actually behind the whole scheme,
Paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper. Of course
Cisco blames the whole thing on poor, innocent Melvin.</P>
<P>Along the way, there are several obligatory gunfights,
explosions, and car chases, plus a literal cliffhanger inspired
by "Jurassic Park," and a completely unconvincing romance between
Melvin and Keiko (who looks like she's barely pushing fifteen).
What the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny
jokes about overweight Jewish mothers, hara-kiri, drinking
problems, leaking body bags, and a running gag about how Crunch
has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation, and now
spends all his time doing hand exercises. Not to mention the
pimply video store clerk who is always calling Melvin and
screeching about how he needs to return his copy of "King Kong
Lives," which is two weeks overdue.</P>
<P>This mess of a movie was helmed by Che-Kirk Wong, the latest Hong
Kong director imported by John Woo ("Face/Off"), who also served
as executive producer. Woo needs to stop acting as a conduit for
other directors, and start making more of his own films. Wong,
who directed such films as "Rock'n'Roll Cop" back in Hong Kong,
is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy. Maybe jokes
about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are
funny across the ocean, but they're not here, at least in the
manner Wong handles them.</P>
<P>Many of the problems can be traced back to the script, which was
penned by obvious freshman writer Ben Ramsey. In addition to his
vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences, Ramsey's
script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the
vulgar, poetic rhythms of Tarantino or Mamet-style dialogue. What
he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather, most of
which spews from the lips of Lou Diamond Phillips (whose favorite
phrase is "It's all love") and Robin Dunne, who plays Cisco's
stuttering, black-wannabe assistant. The irritation factor of
Phillips and Dunne combined is almost off the scale, which can
pretty much describe the film as a whole.</P>
