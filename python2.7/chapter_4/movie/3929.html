<PRE>                                APOLLO 13
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     Things don't get much better than APOLLO 13.  In the sure hands of
director Ron Howard, several dozen actors hit pure notes in capturing
the essence of the American spirit without being sentimental, mawkish,
or melodramatic.  That's a triumph, considering what might have been
done with the subject of a military program in pursuit of public
relations.</P>
<P>     When John F. Kennedy assumed the burden of playing catch-up with
the Russians by announcing in 1960 that America would put a man on the
moon within a decade, NASA delivered with Neil Armstrong and his crew
in 1969.  By the following year, when Apollo 13 lifts off for follow-up
work on the moon, the feel of anticlimax envelops the mission.  In
crass dismissal of the effort, the networks refuse to cover it.  What
could match last year's feat?</P>
<P>     What more than matches it is a three-pronged probe into the
American psyche.  Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton), and
Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) rocket into space on the ill-fated mission
that will suddenly rivet national attention when an oxygen tank
explodes and puts them in jeopardy.  They are trapped in a freezing
tank that is filling slowly with lethal carbon dioxide.</P>
<P>     On the ground, Mission Control struggles to save them. In superb
confirmation of American resourcefulness, Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise)
and the ground team devise a way to put a square peg in a round hole
with canisters and duct tape that are already aboard the ship.  They
hand the crew a million-to-one solution. Even after Mattingly solves
the oxygen problem, the heat shield and parachutes loom as probable
catastrophes.</P>
<P>     All this unfolds in the early days of the celebrity culture, when
the media begins to hound the victims of catastrophe, sharks to blood,
the worse the better.  It also reveals the paradoxical American
reverence for a single life.  As much as Americans can kill each other
on the highways at the rate of 50,000 a year and shoot each other by
the hundreds in schools, when one life, or three in this case, jumps
into public jeopardy, the collective national psyche heaves up as
savior.</P>
<P>     And they did it by talking simply and directly. These astronauts
would surely have died if their fate had lain in the self-righteous,
self-absorbed verbosity of the 90s. If the images are of puffy space
suits and weightless games, the stuff of it is courage and
resourcefulness.</P>
<P>     The extraordinary rescue is delivered without a false note by
Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and a fine supporting cast.  Tom
Hanks simply has a direct line into the souls of the characters he
plays. Kathleen Quinlan conveys beautifully the twin mandates of a 60s
woman: support and perform.</P>
<P>     In these talented hands, this tale becomes a real white-knuckler
that manages also to capture the best of our national essence without
waving the flag.  It's moving, and it's good.</P>
