<PRE>               A film review by Walter Frith</PRE>

<P>The teenaged no brainer duo of Beavis and Butthead are not for all tastes but
they're kind of like Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar a.k.a. 'Wayne's World' in
the fact that once you get to know them they grow on you and are definitely
an acquired taste.  I would describe 'Beavis and Butthead Do America' as one
of my guilty pleasures and I have no problem admitting this because I
actually admire in many ways the message that their creator Mike Judge is
sending out.  He has obviously fashioned these characters after the real life
situations many teenagers become involved in namely ignorance, sexual
curiosity and just being naive of the world around them.  Some clever visions
are realized by Judge who serves as this film's director and the sub text of
his movie is to be realized as an underlying message of recognition for young
people in these situations everyday throughout the world.  Judge of course
takes it one step further for the purposes of entertainment and makes the
plot of 'Beavis and Butthead Do America' one in which the comic duo become
involved with an estranged couple of involved in crime (voiced by Bruce
Willis and Demi Moore) who have murder and espionage on their minds.  B+B
quickly become the two most wanted men in America by federal law enforcement
agents and they float through the situation unknowingly all the while hoping
to finally lose their virginity.  It will be an outrageous and intolerable
film for many to accept especially those over the age of 25 but if you go
with what it's intended to be you will be entertained and its crude and
sometimes vile presentation is a sign of the times for the 1990's in the way
'The Simpsons' and 'Ren and Stimpy' are.</P>
