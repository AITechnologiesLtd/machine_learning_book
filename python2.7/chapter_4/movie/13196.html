<PRE>The Third Man (1949)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 96</PRE>
<P>"The Third Man" is one of the best films of the 1940s.
It is an outstanding film, with a script so dense that
its quality cannot be fully appreciated with a single
viewing.  The quirky score, featuring a zither, puts
a light touch on what would otherwise be a very tense
film.  The cast is first-rate, and there is some fine
cinematography of Vienna's bombed out buildings and
underground sewers.</P>
<P>Joseph Cotten stars as potboiler author Holly Martins,
who has come to Austria to work for old friend Harry Lime
(Orson Welles).  Postwar Austria is politically divided
into sectors controlled by the U.S., England, France
and Russia.  A black market thrives, and there is much
political intrigue.  Upon arrival, Cotten learns that
Lime has died in a suspicious car accident... was it
murder?  Lime left behind other loose ends: he was
wanted on multiple counts of murder for profiteering
from diluted penicillin.  Cotten also falls for Lime's
devoted girlfriend, lovely but unhappy Alida Valli.</P>
<P>"The Third Man" isn't exactly a forgotten classic,
but it still has not received its due recognition.
This may be because it was a British production,
and filmed on location in Austria.  The film is
also in need of preservation: the sound quality was
low on the print that I saw.  Which is a shame, since
every word of the dialogue deserves to be heard.</P>
<P>There are two versions of the film.  The British print
is 104 minutes.  Producer David O. Selznick carefully
pruned 11 minutes for the American version, replacing
the opening narration by director Carol Reed with that
of Joseph Cotten.</P>
