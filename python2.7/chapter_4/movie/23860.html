"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Bret Easton Ellis' novel American Psycho was so disturbing and
controversial that it had to scramble for new publisher at the last
minute when Simon & Schuster backed out after having second thoughts
regarding the murderous tale of an ‘80s yuppie that adorns his posh
apartment with the body parts of his female victims.  Ellis' book was a
detailed satirization of uninhibited materialism and decadence in
post-Last Days of Disco New York City.  But like Disco, this picture is
tough to enjoy because there really isn't anyone to root for.</P>
<P>Christian Bale (William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream) plays
Patrick Bateman, a twenty-seven-year-old Wall Street hotshot whose
biggest problems in life are limited to getting a bad table at a trendy
restaurant, discovering that someone has better business cards than he
does, and trying to find a dry cleaner to get the blood stains out of
his sheets. Bateman admits that he is incapable of feeling any emotion
other than greed and disgust, a fact he demonstrates by killing hookers,
the homeless and an occasional co-worker.</P>
<P>Bateman's world is full of name-dropping co-workers and acquaintances
that can barely remember each other's names but have total recall when
it comes to knowing who wears what kind of suit or who ate at what
restaurant last Wednesday.  He has an unfaithful fiancée (Reese
Witherspoon, Election), a sterile white apartment and a job that seems
to consist of reading porn, watching Jeopardy! and listening to his
Walkman.  As the film opens, Bateman gives a detailed list of name-brand
toiletries that he uses to prepare himself for a hard day of murders and
executions (a bimbo mistakenly thinks he says `mergers and
acquisitions').</P>
<P>You may be wondering about the story right about now, but there really
isn't one.  Bateman hops from home to work to bar to restaurant acting
like a jerk and randomly killing people.  The closest Psycho comes to
any semblance of plot is when Bateman offs a co-worker played by Jared
Leto (Black & White) and is questioned several times by a police officer
(Willem Dafoe, eXistenZ).  Much will be made about Bateman's long,
pre-killing diatribe on ‘80s music, but by the third time he does this,
it's boring.</P>
<P>An overrated actor, Bale does little with Bateman that we haven't
already seen in Michael Douglas' Gordon Gecko or, more recently, Tom
Cruise's Frank `T.J.' Mackey.  But he's much better than Leonardo
DiCaprio would have been (he was originally slated to play the part but,
like Simon & Schuster, backed out at the last minute).  Witherspoon does
a good job at acting like the girl on Stark Raving Mad, who in turn
seems to be doing an impression of Witherspoon.  Leto is as dim-witted
as ever (who keeps casting him?).  Samantha Mathis (Broken Arrow) and
Chloë Sevigny (Boys Don't Cry) co-star, the latter of whom could be
playing the same part as her monotone Last Days of Disco character.</P>
<P>Psycho is a real indie affair, which doesn't help explain why it's
playing multiplexes with a national release date instead of a platformed
art-house run.  Director Mary Harron, who helmed the far superior I Shot
Andy Warhol, as well as episodes of Homicide: Life on the Street and OZ,
doesn't bother to show most of the story's carnage. The film, co-written
by Harron and Go Fish scribe Guinevere Turner, isn't nearly as graphic
as you would think.  Ex-Velvet Undergrounder John Cale (Warhol) provides
a handsome score, and Andrzej Sekula's (Pulp Fiction) camera work is, at
times, breathtaking.</P>
<P>1:37 – R for violence, nudity, strong sexual contest and adult language</P>
