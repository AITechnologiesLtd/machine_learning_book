<PRE>Aria (1987) 90m.  </PRE>
<P>This collection of operatic arias as interpreted by nine different 
directors (ten if you count Bill Bryden's linking story) was producer 
Don Boyd's personal project.  He was understandably anxious about its 
reception but should have realized that only the idea behind his film 
can be deemed a success or a failure - as a work itself, it is so 
diverse in nature that it can only be evaluated piecemeal: it becomes 
just as interesting an exercise in criticism as it is in film-making.</P>
<P>To summarize: Nicolas Roeg's segment replays an obscure moment in 
European history and comes of as nothing much more than a curiosity; 
Charles Sturridge's images of children trapped in an adult world 
complement the numinous aria accompanying them; Godard is just as 
irritating as ever, though he at least should be commended for proving 
that a professional piece of film can be created with a minimal 
production crew; Bruce Beresford's contribution, in which virtually 
nothing happens, is probably the most disposable entry; Julien Temple 
choreographs a bedroom farce to Verdi's 'Rigoletto'; Robert Altman, in a 
moment of pure perversity, shows us not the theatrical event but the 
audience watching that event (the joke wears thin pretty quickly); Franc 
Roddam expertly transplants the doomed lovers Tristan and Isolde into 
contemporary Las Vegas; Ken Russell takes us into a mystical mindscape; 
and Derek Jarman's clip is so generic that almost any piece of pop music 
could be dubbed onto it to much the same effect.</P>
<P>To view Boyd's project as a whole, we must really locate where its 
different directors agree about the essence of opera.  In this instance, 
it's pretty straightforward - sex and death.  It's also fun to see where 
they differ, in any number of binary choices: e.g., popular arias versus 
the esoteric; the adherence to or departure from the context of the 
original libretto; the refusal or indulgence of directorial trademarks 
(to this end, we can see evidence of Jarman's music videos and 8mm film 
paste-ups, Roeg's use of wife Theresa Russell, Godard's use of 
intertitles and soundtrack jumpcuts).  Surprisingly, it is from the two 
least expected sources, Sturridge and Roddam, that the potential of 
Boyd's concept is best realized - their sequences are as evocative and 
emotive as we would hope for.  But it is Ken Russell, who has always 
been adept at this sort of thing, where ARIA really coalesces in terms 
of concept, visuals, and music.  To say more would spoil it for you.  
Film is unlikely to produce imitators, so it may well remain one of a 
kind.  Sumptuous photography and superb music make it ideal theatrical 
fare.</P>
