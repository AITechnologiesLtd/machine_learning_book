<PRE>                               DOLORES CLAIBORNE
                       A film review by Thomas Skogestad
                        Copyright 1995 Thomas Skogestad</PRE>

Reviewed at Landmark's Shattuck Cinemas, Berkeley</P>
<P>     Castle Rock has a knack for turning out well
made--excellent--adaptations of Stephen King novels (STAND BY ME,
MISERY).  Last year brought us the sadly little seen, but terrific
THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.</P>
<P>     So it's sad to say that DOLORES CLAIBORNE is a bit of a letdown.
The plot seems to be the problem--as it's quite thin and at 131 minutes
a lack of a strong plot becomes a bit tedious.</P>
<P>     Saving the film is an excellent performance by Kathy Bates, a
fitting score by Danny Elfman and some cinematography that's excellent
in parts.</P>
<P>     Kathy Bates as the title character perfects on her performance as
a loony fan in MISERY.  Yes, she even runs around with an ax, but we
never loose sympathy for her since she truthfully portrays an
"ordinary" woman who is sometimes pushed too far.  Jennifer Jason Leigh
is a bit hard to take at times, at times she seems to be too distant;
and redoing her accent from THE HUDSUCKER PROXY and MRS. PARKER AND THE
VICIOUS CIRCLE only distracts more.</P>
<P>     Since the movie is released by Sony's Columbia Pictures, the movie
is also available in SDDS.  Save your bucks and don't travel too far to
see a movie that rarely uses the system.  In fact all instances of SDDS
seem to have added by the foleys long after the movie wrapped up its
shooting.  The best use of the system is hearing an upstairs doorknob
being turned!  Often I kept thinking, had the director filmed this
scene from a different angle, we would have a perfect SDDS moment....</P>
<P>     This is after all a Stephen King movie, so there are a few plot
twists here and there.  Perhaps one too many, the ending doesn't quite
feel right.  Sadly, it seems to have been heavily influenced by the
"convenience city syndrome" found in OUTBREAK.</P>
