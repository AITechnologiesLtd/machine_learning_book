<PRE>                                FIRST WIVES CLUB
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>You know, this is a film that must have sounded like a no-brainer in the
meetings. Mix equal portions of two financial and critical successes,
"The Big Chill" and "9 To 5" and  toss in three of the best female
comedians in the business today. Shake vigorously and serve.</P>
<PRE>Where did it go wrong?</PRE>
<P>Brenda (Bette Midler), Elise (Goldie Hawn) and Annie (Diane Keaton) were
best friends in their college years but havent kept in touch since
then. Brought together by the suicide of the fourth in their group, they
discover that they have all reached "that" age. All have been dumped by
their husbands of decades for a younger, newer and more pert model.</P>
<P>As the three bond, they become more empowered and plot to get even via
their exs billfolds. Using a group of enjoyable cronies including
Maggie Smith, Bronson Pinchot, Jennifer Dundas and Philip Bosco; they
get the goods on the guys and begin to blackmail them.</P>
<P>The subjects of "Trophy Wives" and womens worth as they age, the
possibilities for cutting satire and any opportunity for engaging the
audience disappear out the window as the film never tackles any of these
head-on and doesnt rise above a television movie of the week level.
Every moment I was waiting for the three stars to explode out of the
plodding doldrums.</P>
<PRE>It doesnt happen.</PRE>
<P>Part of the problem is that director Hugh Wilson comes from a television
and "Police Academy" background. Hardly cutting-edge stuff and little
experience available as to how to handle this type of film.</P>
<P>Hawn and Keaton are two long-time personal faves and both give as much
as possible to the film, but get dragged into the mire. Midler often
turns in dynamic performances although here she is the least of the
three.</P>
<P>The husbands and their bimbo girlfriends are icons of people as opposed
to real humans. The only sincerely likable character in the film is
Dundas as Annies lesbian daughter.</P>
<P>The movie attempts to deal with a number of stories. It takes a very
extended amount of time in the beginning to even tie together the lives
of the women, giving us a slow start. Something that this film does not
need.</P>
<P>The dumped wives are difficult to relate to on a personal level. They
are all wealthy, even though they're no longer remarkably rich. With the
exception of Midler, they live in spacious Manhattan apartments, run
with the society set and appear to be extremely financially comfortable.
Their ex-husbands are writing checks to them with amounts close to a
quarter million dollars.</P>
<P>The women were injured in psychologically and it would have made the
film much more interesting if they had gone after the men in the same
way. Instead we get to watch money exchange hands from one person who
has tons of it to another person who doesnt have quite as many tons.</P>
<P>There are so many other problems with the movie, but there are equal
numbers of bright spots. You cant put this cast into a film without
coming up with some comical scenes, even if just by dumb luck.</P>
<P>The film isn't atrocious. In fact, it's pleasant, but cant we expect
something better than just __pleasant__?</P>
