<PRE>PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A MISERABLE OLD MAN
by Kristian Lin</PRE>
<P>At one point in DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, Harry's wife, Joan (Kirstie Alley)
has discovered her husband's infidelity with one of her psychiatric
patients.  She screams at him until her anger is temporarily spent, and
now she's lying on the floor in tears.  That's when Harry says, "You're 
overreacting."  He's not being intentionally cruel; Allen gives the line
in his patented irritated defensive whine.  Harry's in denial, but Allen
lets us know that Harry's response is somehow worse than deliberately 
crushing her with the admission.  He's not only being dishonest with
himself and her, but he's causing her even more pain.  You feel like
cheering when she gets up and tries to strangle the little bastard.</P>
<P>Since HUSBANDS AND WIVES, Woody Allen has been in a new and frequently
startling phase of his career.  With his latest film, his take on the
relationship between art and life appears to have gone baroque. 
HUSBANDS AND WIVES had its obvious autobiographical elements, but
BULLETS OVER BROADWAY played the difference between being a great artist
and a great person to wonderful effect.  EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU
demonstrated the artificiality of movie musical conventions (while
paying them tribute) by using actors whose musical talents were, ahem,
closer to those of ordinary people than those of characters in
musicals.  DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, though, is like a hall of mirrors, with
auteur and characters constantly interacting.  Somewhere, Pirandello and
Borges are having a good laugh over this one.</P>
<P>Harry Block (Allen) is a lousy human being who's revered as a great
writer.  He's recognizable as the Woody Allen persona, but with all the
ugly sides in full bloom.  He cheats on his wives and girlfriends, likes
to be beaten by hookers, and treats the women in his life so abominably
that they wind up hating him.  Moreover, he puts their exploits into his
novels and short stories and thinly disguises their characters so
they'll all recognize themselves.  The movie's plot revolves around his
trip to upstate New York to receive an honorary degree from a college he
was expelled from as a student.  Lonely, he asks a hooker (Hazelle
Goodman) to accompany them, forgetting that he has already invited a
friend (Bob Balaban).  He then kidnaps his son from day care to see Dad
get his honor.</P>
<P>For the first time since ZELIG, Woody Allen has written a compelling
role for himself.  Through his writing, Harry gives pleasure to millions
of people as long as they stay the hell away from him.  But they only
hurt the people they're based on - his sister Doris (Caroline Aaron) who
married an Orthodox Jew, is painted as a harridan (Demi Moore) who 
insists on following the Torah to the letter.  His adulterous escapade
with his ex-wife's sister Jane (Judy Davis) is fodder for a farcical
story that breaks up Jane's marriage.  He repeatedly tells his
girlfriend Faye (Elisabeth Shue) not to fall in love with him, then he's
flabbergasted when she doesn't.  Instead she runs off with his best
friend (Billy Crystal), and Harry gets revenge by casting him in a story
as Satan.</P>
<P>The women in Harry's life are continually furious with him, for which
you can scarcely blame them.  Aaron, Davis, and Alley all have their
turns blowing up at him, and they're magnificent in their anger.  I 
realize that sounds like the villain in a melodrama ("My dear, you're
beautiful when you're angry,"), but it's true.  They're painful, but
Allen finds their raging, wounded outbursts funny, and he invites us to
do the same.  Sexist?  No, because these episodes would be sordid and
unfunny if Allen didn't also invite us to empathize with their pain. 
Davis is fantastic when she's overwrought, and at one point
hyperventilates until she passes out.  Alley's even better - her
crash-and-bang style of acting has never been put to better use than
here.</P>
<P>DECONSTRUCTING HARRY is purposely ragged, with plot digressions and
filmed fantasy sequences.  Some of these are just funny stories that
Woody Allen wants to show us.  It takes a while to realize that 
the movie's form cagily resembles that of a literary anthology or a
short story collection, like one Harry Block might have written.  The
movie ends in impressive fashion, as we see Harry being saluted by all
the characters he has created.  We can imagine Woody in some similarly
exalted state, surrounded by Annie Hall and Leonard Zelig and Cheech and
Linda Ash, and being serenaded by dancing Grouchos.  But Allen doesn't
end the film on this note.  Instead, the dream fades, and Harry Block is
left alone, pounding away at his typewriter.</P>
<P>I suspect that even if DECONSTRUCTING HARRY weren't around, AS GOOD AS
IT GETS would still feel like the piece of Hollywoodized fabrication
that it is.  Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson), like Harry Block, is a great
writer and horrible person.  He's not only obsessive-compulsive, but he
spews racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic and misogynistic insults at
anyone in his path.  His salvation arrives at the hands of Carol
Connelly (Helen Hunt), a thoroughly winsome waitress without whom Melvin
can't eat at the restaurant where he has to dine.  It also comes from
Simon (Greg Kinnear), a gay neighbor whose career as an artist is
paralyzed when he's brutally attacked.</P>
<P>AS GOOD AS IT GETS is directed and co-written (with Mark Andrus) by
James L. Brooks, and Brooks is in his movie-length sitcom mode.  All the
characters are here to win you over, and the minor ones like Cuba
Gooding, Jr.'s art dealer and Shirley Knight as Carol's mother are there
to provide spurious dashes of color.  The movie's supposed to be about a
misanthrope who emerges from his shell, but it's apparent from the
beginning that Melvin's an old softie - 15 minutes in, he has gotten
attached to the little dog that he originally threw down the garbage
chute (yes, this movie will stoop low enough to use a cute little dog). 
We may think it's daring to make a romantic comedy about a guy who says
such horrible things, but Melvin's bigotry doesn't manifest itself in
any deeper way, which makes the shock value of his insults seem
calculated and cheap.</P>
<P>The casting, though, seems to be a deeper problem.  You can understand
why Nicholson's here.  He's always had this great ability to make an
audience understand his motives - we wouldn't have sympathized with
McMurphy's attempted murder of Nurse Ratched if he'd been played by
Pacino or De Niro or Beatty or any of Nicholson's other brilliant
contemporaries.  Brooks must have felt that he'd need all the famous 
Nicholson charm to counteract Melvin's sourness.  The problem is that
while Jack has the right attitude for delivering his outrageous
dialogue, he never finds the character's essence.  He was a plausible
man of letters in WOLF, but he's too busy investing all his energy into
getting in people's faces to give off the proper writerly aura.  If
Melvin had had Dustin Hoffman's less showy and more neurotic egomania,
it would have improved matters.  Regardless, Nicholson never settles
into the part, and he's left to fuss and leer his way through the
picture.  His problem spreads to Greg Kinnear, who looks uncomfortable
even before his character is thrown into physical and mental anguish.</P>
<P>Worse off is Hunt, that incredibly deft and irresistible comic actress. 
I've seen episodes of "Mad About You" that left me in awe of her skills,
but as a working-class single mother in a dead-end job, Hunt is too
perky, too young, too beautiful, and way too polished.  With her crisp
diction and appearance, I didn't believe her when Carol needed help
spelling the word "conscience."  The part needed Susan Sarandon's 
brainy middle-aged sensuality.  Or, if they wanted someone younger,
Minnie Driver or Anne Heche could have provided their brands of
unconventional beauty and keen wit while looking convincingly careworn. 
Michelle Pfeiffer would have brought the whole package.  As welcome as
it is to have Helen Hunt starring in a romantic comedy, she's wrong for
this part.</P>
<P>Woody Allen has taken criticism from some quarters for becoming morose
and isolated in his post-SHADOWS AND FOG years, but DECONSTRUCTING HARRY
still feels far more real than AS GOOD AS IT GETS.  Harry Block is a man
whose artistic flame burns everyone around him, and there's no 
redemption for him, even if he is a great writer (nor does Harry have
the saving grace of Melvin's mental illness).  Such a dedicated artist
may have a lighter side, but inevitably he's hell to deal with.  Of
course, it's possible to be a great artist and a semi-decent human
being, but when it comes to depicting this kind of person, we know we're
in the presence of the genuine article with Woody Allen.  AS GOOD AS IT
GETS is only Woody's vision domesticated and made safe for consumption
by sitcom audiences.  It gave me a good idea, though.  Maybe Jack
Nicholson should replace Paul Reiser on "Mad About You."  Instead of 
Paul's hypochondria, let's see how Jamie Buchman deals with a guy who
makes Jerry Seinfeld look like the world's biggest slob.  There's the
new cornerstone of Must See TV.</P>
