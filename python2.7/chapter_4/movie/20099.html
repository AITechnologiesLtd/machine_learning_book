<PRE>[comedy]</PRE>

<P>Seen July 27, 1999 at 7:30 p.m. at Crossgates Cinema 18 (Guilderland, NY), 
theater #18, by myself for free (see review for explanation). [Theater 
rating: ***: good sound, picture and seats]</P>
<P>"Drop Dead Gorgeous" was a movie I didn't really want to see. I had sat 
through its trailer dozens of times assuming it was another idiotic comedy 
meant to appeal to teens and those who enjoy lowbrow, b-movie humor (the 
marketing campaign focused only on the slapstick comedy, the film's 
mentally-challenged character and teenage girls shaking their booty). I went 
in fully prepared to be bored and offended and came out pleasantly surprised 
and I am now shocked at how poorly it has performed at the box office. I'll 
still review it anyway.</P>
<P>I was standing outside the cineplex at the local mall looking at the big 
board of titles and times when a woman came up to me and asked if I wanted to 
see a sneak preview of "Runaway Bride" because she had won some passes to it 
through one of those radio contests and she couldn't go. I thought it would 
be a good idea because then I'd be able to review that movie before it was 
released nationally, but when I got in line the manager said the theater was 
overbooked and those who couldn't get in could go see whatever else was 
playing for free. There weren't any other good movies playing until late and 
I had to get up early the next day for work and since "Drop Dead Gorgeous" 
was playing at the time I decided to see it. I heard really bad things from 
some of my fellow Internet critics and actually thought it'd be a good idea 
to see a bad movie because I haven't ripped into a film in a long time.</P>
<P>So I went in and had my watch set to clock the time it would take before I 
found something good to laugh at (hoping I could say "I didn't laugh until 
45:15 into the running time"). Boy was I surprised when big laughs came 
during the film's first few scenes.</P>
<P>An opening title card tells us that a major cosmetics company has sponsored a 
national teen beauty pageant at the local and state level for 50 years and to 
celebrate the anniversary a documentary crew was sent to the small town of 
Mount Rose, Minnesota to show what the pageant means to average high school 
girls, their parents and the communities they live in (they don't say WHO 
sent the film crew). Fortunately for this filming team, Mount Rose is the 
kind of town that only exists in a comedy movie, but that's okay because 
funny is funny.</P>
<P>We start with a shot of the town's welcome sign pointing out the fact it is 
home to "The Oldest Living Lutheran in Minnesota," which is a good indication 
of how this little town takes pride in anything. The joke is extended even 
further when the town's mayor says the sign isn't accurate because that 
person actually died and every year he asks the Shriners to "take down that 
goddamned sign but they never do." Maybe that's a little crude and lowbrow, 
but it probably wasn't what you expected to hear from a small town mayor, 
especially the way the comedy is delivered here.</P>
<P>The entire film is meant to be a real documentary on the town's beauty 
pageant which is a technique rarely used by mainstream comedies, but works 
well here because it allows the townsfolk to talk directly to the camera and 
say what they're feeling and makes them seem a bit more realistic. It also 
works as a regular fiction story in that it's easy to tell what the 
characters actually mean when they speak to the camera and when they're lying.</P>
<P>The first third of the movie is quite funny in its setup and depiction of its 
characters, who are all exactly that - characters. The pageant contestants 
each have their own trait that gives them their comedic hook. There's a girl 
who has a frightening love of dogs, one who wants to teach the world sign 
language through ballet-style dancing, one who thinks "Soylent Green" would 
make a great dramatic monologue, one whose brother is a drag queen in New 
York City and thinks it's the coolest thing, one who was adopted by an Asian 
family and thinks she's Asian, and one who can't stop making out with her 
boyfriend and fulfills the generic slutty blonde role. The two real 
contestants of the film are, not surprisingly, complete opposites, the 
best-looking and the only real names the film has to market.</P>
<P>Kirsten Dunst stars as Amber Atkins, a homely, good-natured and high-spirited 
girl who works part time as a mortician while she dreams of becoming a famous 
journalist like her idol Diane Sawyer. Amber is pretty bright and right away 
she has a lot of appeal thanks to Dunst making her cute and sweet in a 
cartoony way. Amber's nemesis is the rich snob Becky Leeman (Richards), whose 
mother, Mrs. Gladys Leeman (Alley) just happens to be the organizer of the 
pageant and whose father (Sam McMurray) is the wealthiest businessman in town 
(he runs a small furniture store as if it were a cut-throat car dealership). 
If it's easy to tell Amber is our hero, it's even easier to tell Becky and 
her mother are the antagonists who we love to hate.</P>
<P>And so we have this subtle battle between Amber and the Leemans who will stop 
at nothing to ensure Becky will win the pageant even though they have 
obviously rigged it anyway. Many of the jokes and the sub-plots involve 
mysterious actions occurring meant to thwart Amber's rise such as a few 
deaths here and there. That might seem cold and cruel but the comedy never 
comes across as mean-spirited despite these instances. For example, Amber's 
trailer explodes with her mother inside and when we catch up with her at the 
hospital we see she has a beer can singed to her hand!</P>
<P>Yes, that's lowbrow comedy but it works effectively here. But instead of 
giving the film an ugly, connotative atmosphere you'd get with a b-movie that 
uses many of the same jokes, it works just the opposite here to keeps things 
lighthearted and humorous. We're always laughing at the characters, but 
because they're so blatantly over-the-top in every way it doesn't feel bad to 
derive pleasure from it. It's that kind of comedy that you laugh at and 
repeat out loud not knowing whether you're laughing because it's so dumb or 
because it's actually funny.</P>
<P>A few examples of this: one of the judges is named "John Dough" and is 
clearly a pedophile, but one who is quite bad at hiding his secret (if his 
name doesn't already make that clear) and tends to ramble on about how normal 
he is, such as when we see him watching the girls practice and notice that 
he's carrying a camcorder which he claims is for insurance purposes, "in case 
of accidents." There's also a huge mentally-challenged young man who is the 
brother of one of the judges (who isn't much smarter). The two fight with 
each other and it's funny to laugh at the antics the "retard" performs 
because he doesn't know any better, but it's also funny to laugh at the way 
the others react to him because it's so politically incorrect.</P>
<P>There isn't much more to elaborate on the film's plot, which is probably its 
weakest point. It's filled with continuity errors galore and is predictable 
to the extreme, but really, how else could they have done it? It's  similar 
to "Titanic" in that it realizes it's placating to the audience and doesn't 
apologize. You can't possibly take the things as zany and stupid as this 
seriously so don't bother. "Drop Dead Gorgeous" is a comedy meant to be 
laughed at, so go ahead and indulge yourself.</P>
