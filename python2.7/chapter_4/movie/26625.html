Lucky Numbers (2000) 2 stars out of 4. Starring John Travolta, Lisa
Kudrow, Ed O'Neill, Tim Roth and Michael Rappaport. Written by Adam
Resnick. Directed by Nora Ephron.</P>
<P> Every town and small city has its Russ Richards. He's the local
ìcelebrity,î the TV anchorman, weatherman or pitchman who everyone knows
and adores.</P>
<PRE> Heís the big fish in the small pond who basks in the adoration of his
fans.</PRE>
<P> Russ Richards is the star celebrity weatherman at a Harrison, Pa., TV
station. And it is his story that is the focus of Lucky Numbers, a broad
and sometime strident comedy about greed and its consequences.</P>
<P> Set in 1988, Lucky Numbers is loosely based on a real incident from
1980 in which someone tried to fix the daily number drawing in the
Pennsylvania state lottery.</P>
<P> Screenwriter Adam Resnick and director Nora Ephron have fictionalized
this scandal, creating an almost slapstick style comedy, which moves in
starts and spurts.</P>
<P> Richards (John Travolta) is the king of Harrisburg. His life, as far as
he is concerned, is a joy. He has his own parking space as well as his
own table at the local Dennyís. Fans, waiters and waitresses fawn over
him.</P>
<P> However, Richardsí life is about to start that long painful downhill
slide. His snowmobile business is causing him to go broke, costing him
his house and his prized possession  his Jaguar. It seems a warm spell
has gripped Harrisburg so there is no call for snowmobiles during the
winter of '88.</P>
<P> Richards turns to his friend, Gig (Tim Roth), who gives him several
suggestions none legal  on how to obtain some quick cash.</P>
<P> The first, an attempted burglary of his dealership, is thwarted but an
overzealous employee.</P>
<P> Then Gig suggests a way to fix the $6.4 million lottery drawing. This
plan works, but then everyone who knows about the scheme wants a piece
of the action.</P>
<P> Pretty soon, Russ again owes more than he has.</P>
<P> And while all this may sound hilarious  and parts are Lucky Numbers has
a mean-spiritedness to it. These people  who also include Lisa Kudrow as
the sluttish lottery number girl and Ed O'Neill as the slimy head of the
TV station  are venal, unethical and greedy.</P>
<P> None of them are really worth caring about. It is difficult to like or
root for any of them. Even while you laugh, you don't want to see them
succeed.</P>
<P> As a paean to avarice, Lucky Numbers is a textbook study. It doesnít
rank, though, with a comedy such as Outrageous Fortune. Lucky Numbers it
is too long, too broad and features too many characters and too much
double dealing.</P>
<P> Travoltaís performance, while rather hammy, is not bad. His Russ
Richards is one of those self-centered, spoiled people who believes
their status entitles them to whatever they want.</P>
<P> Kudrowís Crystal Latroy is an immoral co-conspirator who uses her body
to get what she wants and what she thinks she deserves.</P>
<P> Lucky Numbers has several funny moments, but as a whole the film leaves
you dissatisfied. Maybe it is because I don't care about bad things
happening to these unredeemable characters. I think these people all get
what they deserve.</P>
<P> And I donít like spending two hours dwelling on their flaws and
shortcomings.</P>
<P> No, Lucky Numbers has its hilarious moments, but overall these people
are not worth anyoneís time.</P>
