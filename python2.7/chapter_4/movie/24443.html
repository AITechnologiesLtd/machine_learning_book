<PRE>GUINEVERE (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Audrey Welles</PRE>
<PRE>Screenplay: Audrey Welles</PRE>
<P>Starring: Stephan Rea, Sarah Polley, Jean Smart, Paul Dooley, Gina Gershon,
Sandra Oh, Jasmine Guy, Francis Guinan, Carrie Preston</P>
<P>When Robert Redford courts Kristen Scott Thomas in THE HORSE WHISPERER, the
dynamics of age are conspicuously absent from the proceedings. They're ignored
or accepted for the purposes of fantasy, but GUINEVERE does neither. The most
refreshing bits of the film center on how and why these relationships come to
fruition. It gives us some low key humor and dollops of the kind of gloomy
romantic angst that those French seem to enjoy so much (yes, that is a broad
generalization). But it also rather refreshingly challenges the male half of
the older man\ younger woman equation. Unfortunately it loses focus when it
isn't dealing with that issue.</P>
<P>In Tinseltown it's expected that aging hunks like Warren Beatty and Sean
Connery romance women young enough to call them grandpa. Though whenever we see
such a couple on the street we immediately assume that the man in question must
be a damn Rockefeller and the women in question must be a gold digging tart who
would gladly appear on WHO WANTS TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE? Only in Hollywood (a
mythical region where hotties like Lara Flynn Boyle throw themselves at baldies
like Jack Nicholsen) is such an oddity looked upon as normal. As I type this
Katie Holmes is wooing Michael Douglas (a man so old his wrinkles have
wrinkles) in multiplexes everywhere. Interestingly enough after filming WONDER
BOYS (in case you were curious) Douglas gets to enact the fantasy that Katie
Holmes presented by going home and banging the stunning (and just of diapers)
Catherine Zeta Jones. (Though I'm assuming the fantasy ended when Douglas
accidentally, again my own interpretation, impregnated the mighty Zeta. Oops).</P>
<P>In GUINEVERE's most effective scene, an effete snob (well played by Jean Smart)
confronts her 21-year-old daughter's middle aged lover: "What do you have
against women your own age?" she snarls. Connie, the middle aged man in
question, is photographed beneath her as if shamed by her bluntness. She
doesn't let him answer; instead the woman provides a contemptuous monologue
that's also painfully correct: Connie seeks out young, inexperienced women
because they look up to him as a noble savant. He's like rogue artist with much
wisdom to impart, a man who ever so romantically shuns the rich and lives for
his art in a ratty little apartment. And he believes in them, pushing them to
their full potential the way nobody else cared to do. But he wants something
from them in return. Connie wants more than respect, he wants them gaze upon
him with gooey eyes full of awe, and they do. He draws these pups in by giving
them the adoration that they've lacked in their lives. Connie is a predator,
though too sad to be malicious, he's the kind who rationalizes his faults by
"helping" his prey while simultaneously hurting them.</P>
<P>Harper (Sarah Polley) is a rich, shy young woman, unfairly picked on by her
family of elitist snobs. She isn't as out going, charming, or obedient enough
to be loved by them. Harper is like a modern day Cinderella with her presumably
more beautiful sister getting all the adulation. She finds the parental love
she lacks in Connie (Stephan Rea), the middle aged photographer who fancies
himself an artist. He treats her like a goddess (Queen Guenivere he calls her).
For her, this is new; nobody has ever given her this much affection. And before
long she has moved into his apartment and become his assistant as well as
lover. And Connie is in ecstasy. He is a man that enjoys the act of falling in
love rather than being in love and clearly this is the start of a new cycle.</P>
<P>The scene between Connie and Harper's mother is so psychologically captivating
that I wish the film had retained more of that edge. GUINEVERE's biggest flaw
is its reluctance to follow through on its most enthralling bits. However it
provides some nice understated psychological moments between Connie and Harper.
At one pont he somberly asks her "Whose my good little girl?" to which she
replies (after a stunned glance) "Me". It's sadly touching that her need for
that kind of affection puts her in the position of a helpless little child. If
someone asked me if I was a good little boy (or a good little girl for that
matter) I doubt that I would stick around after my stunned glance no matter how
down on myself I felt. Harper not only stays but basks in his misguided love.
She is his good little girl.</P>
<P>Sarah Polly, as Harper, is extraordinary at playing a self-conscious young
woman just as effectively as she played a wild child in GO. Her face is a
myriad of simplistically complex expressions; facile looks and gestures take
you inside her character's mind. At other times she's less subtle, but just as
effective. In scenes where Connie tends to become overly intense she breaks
into giddy fits of laughter. It reminds us that for all the grown up postures
she attempts that Harper is still an insecure child.</P>
<P>Stephan Rea is stoic, appearing like an emotionless brick of a man, too
self-conscious to let any emotions bleed through his sturdy exterior. Though
his guard is pummeled down in one scene where an angered Harper rapidly snaps
off pictures of him, using her Nikon camera like a weapon. Rea is the kind of
actor who tends to fade into the background. He isn't commanding (at least not
in a typical movie star way) but understated which sometimes both helps and
hurts his roles. Rea played the lead in THE CRYING GAME, where he appeared in
nearly every scene with the same placated self he presents here. As such I
found it difficult to get into his character (a character that lingered in the
background when he should have been in the foreground) in that film. In
GUINEVERE his minimalist style works more effectively because he's playing a
cerebral character who expresses himself through photographs, not outward
charm.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the screenplay lacks the edge that the film's actors bring. It
feels a little too safe. Writer director Audrey Welles (she wrote the
screenplay for THE TRUTH ABOUT CAT'S AND DOGS) has clearly tapped into
something personal but I don't think she had the balls to take it further into
darker places. She also flounders a bit in a silly denouement that feels
awfully forced (and one that steals liberally from ALL THAT JAZZ). It includes
a supposed sisterly connection that is formed between all of the various
Guienvere's Connie has cultivated (or maybe they cultivated him), and an absurd
fantasy sequence that's both poignant and, well, absurd.</P>
<P>At its best GUINEVRE is a thoughtful exploration of why these
O'Keefe\Streiglitz relationships begin (and how they end), at its worst it's a
Lifetime Television Special gloss on the obsessions of Woody Allen. I seriously
doubt Michael Douglas would recommend it.</P>
