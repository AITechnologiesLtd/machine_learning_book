<P>Think of "Hoosiers," with a science fair subbing for a basketball game as 
the grand finale, and you'll have an idea of what to expect from "October 
Sky," an earnest, inspirational throwback to the pre-ironic days of 
filmmaking. How refreshing to watch idealism and sentimentality presented 
onscreen without the usual cheap manipulative tricks so beloved by 
Hollywood schlockmeisters. Admittedly, "October Sky" is at times a bit 
too pat, but given the sheer good will engendered by the movie, that flaw 
is easy to take.</P>
<P>The story, based on Homer J. Hickam Jr.'s memoir, "Rocket Boys," begins 
on a brisk night in 1957, when the residents of Coalwood, West Virginia 
watch the Russian satellite Sputnik glide across the starry October sky. 
Inspired by the sight, and the U.S. efforts to keep up with their Cold 
War rivals, young Homer Hickam decides to start building rockets of his 
own, much to the dismay of his father, the mine superintendent for the 
company town's only industry. Along with a few friends, Homer forms the 
"Big Creek Missile Agency" and pursues his dream, encouraged by a teacher 
who believes the boys might have a chance of winning the National Science 
Fair in Indianapolis and securing the college scholarships necessary for 
them to escape life in the mines. </P>
<P>The film has two story arcs, both well-traveled but satisfying 
nonetheless. One is a tale of perseverance, chronicling the boys' dogged 
efforts to succeed through study, experimentation and hard work. The 
other eloquently details one young man's quest to be his own person, even 
while he continues to desperately crave the approval of his father. In a 
letter to his former high school, the real Homer Hickam stated he wrote 
his book "for all of us who watched our parents sacrifice in a million 
ways every day so that we might have a better life. It was written for 
all of us who observed by deed every day how much our parents loved us 
but never experienced it through touch or word." If you found that 
statement corny rather than moving, this may not be the film for you. </P>
<P>"October Sky" captures the look and feel of a tiny '50s coal-mining town 
so well that the golden-oldies soundtrack seems unnecessary and intrusive.
 The cast does fine work making the town come to life. Laura Dern is 
effective as the boy's teacher and Natalie Canerday gives a great 
performance as Elsie Hickam, a fiercely devoted mother and wife who hates 
Coalwood. Even while battling for her family, she paints a beachside 
mural on the kitchen wall, a small act of defiance against this town of 
soot, hacking coughs and lives of resignation. </P>
<P>As Homer, Jake Gyllenhaal nicely straddles the line between wide-eyed boy 
and fiery young man. He makes Homer a 20th Century Huck Finn, with a 
personality born of his mother's dreams and his father's backbone. Chris 
Cooper, in the film's most crucial role, plays John Hickam with grit and 
intensity, tempered by a hint of sadness in his eyes. As a superintendent,
 husband and father, John Hickam is firm and not always fair, but he 
truly believes himself a reasonable man operating in the best interests 
of those around him. While you will certainly understand Homer's 
frustration with his father, you'll also realize why he cherishes him so. </P>
<P>After watching "October Sky," I bought and read "Rocket Boys," partially 
because I wanted to spend more time with the Hickams, but also to check 
the accuracy of the film, which seemed almost too slick to be true. 
Indeed, the movie makes some changes. The six rocket boys in the "Big 
Creek Missile Agency" are condensed into four characters. Homer's mother 
was considerably more assertive, and his father quietly more helpful, 
than portrayed in the film. An incident with the law which casts a pall 
over the boys for a goodly portion of the movie was actually resolved in 
one afternoon. And as for one of the few images in the film that looked 
contrived, a shot of a defeated young Homer gazing upwards at Sputnik 
while a mine elevator lowers him into the bowels of the earth, well, 
let's just call it poetic license and leave it at that.  </P>
<P>The liberties taken by the filmmakers didn't really bother me, though. 
The movie is true to the essence of the book and, most importantly, it 
does not dishonor Homer's parents, John and Elsie Hickam. That matters, 
because it shows that the people behind "October Sky" adhere to the 
values they espouse. As with "Hoosiers," "October Sky" may move some 
facts around and throw in a fictional subplot, but it maintains the 
integrity of the true story behind the celluloid. </P>
