<P>Although the picture of Adam Sandler raising a child is a frightening
thought, he is acting as a father figure in his newest comedy. Big Daddy
gives us an impression of what the spawn of Sandler may appear as, and
the result is much sweeter than suspected.</P>
<P>As his newest character, Sandler plays an incomparable slob named Sonny
Koufax, a law-school graduate who works one day a week at a toll booth
and spends the other six on the couch. That's when a five-year old
problem walks up to his door, in the form of a child who claims to be
his roommate's long-lost son. Unfortunately, the lucky father (Jon
Stewart) is on his way to China for a business trip. Sonny, for reasons
unknown at the time, takes the kid into open arms and decides to give
him a dose of the real world.</P>
<P>Young Julian is played by the tag-team acting duo of Cole and Dylan
Sprouse, two irresistibly cute twins who show a minimal stretch in
acting talents, but constitute perfectly for the demands of the role.
Sonny gives Julian a taste of his regular afternoon schedule, which
consists of going to the park and watching the roller bladers tumble to
their doom. Of course, the two lonely souls become attached to each
other, and Sonny begins to raise the little demon as his own.</P>
<P>But Sonny insists on teaching Julian the basics of  being a proper,
well-mannered young lad. He shows him that any and all spills can be
soaked up by a well-placed sheet of newspaper. He instructs him to dent
their cans of Alpha-Getti at the supermarket so that they can get the
discount price. He gives him a handy-dandy slingshot and a bag full of
marbles to slaughter innocent pigeons on the back deck. But despite the
fact that Sonny is offering Julian a completely misguided view on
growing up, it's obvious that he cares about the kid. And Sandler, the
king of naughty toilet humor, appears to be showcasing some charm here,
much the way he did in The Wedding Singer. Big Daddy does have a wider
range than something like The Waterboy, which appealed to only 13-25
year-old males in dire need of physical humor. But don't misread, this
is not his Truman Show. Big Daddy has the regular quotient of pee-pee
jokes and Sandler-orientated vulgarity, only toned down with sprinkles
of sweetness carefully mixed into the solution.</P>
<P>And he never did have a better chance of getting the girl either. There
are three respectable leading ladies in Big Daddy. Kristy Swanson plays
Sonny's original girlfriend Vanessa, until she runs off with a man twice
her age (or `Old Man River' as Sonny so eloquently puts it). Leslie Mann
plays Jon Stewart's stressed out fiancee, who is unable to socialize
because she once worked as a waitress at Hooters restaurant. The most
shimmering performance of all comes from Joey Lauren Adams (Chasing Amy)
as Mann's sister Layla, who falls head over heels for Sonny. Well,
mostly because of the cute child he's dragging around.</P>
<P>Big Daddy has plenty of funny moments; no gargantuan laughs, but a few
dozen hearty chuckles spaced evenly throughout. The finale in a
courtroom is played too seriously, and the premise gets drowned in
sentimental goo as it goes along, but the result is still rather
charming and entertaining. Adam Sandler movies are not intended to be
art. They exist to give people a good laugh, and Big Daddy manages just
fine.</P>
<P>It's also nice to see a jump in maturity for Sandler and company here,
even if it's just a marginal one. There are still bizarre supporting
characters, but no one truly annoying. Rob Schneider is funny as an
illiterate delivery man, as is Steve Buscemi in a small role as an Egg
McMuffin craving homeless man. Watch for some of Sandler's Waterboy
co-stars to appear as a few of his business partners and beer-guzzling
friends. But sorry, no Farmer Frau.</P>
<P>It's commendable of Adam Sandler to be attempting a change of pace. But,
fans of the big goof aren't going to be disappointed with Big Daddy.
Perhaps Sandler isn't so much an embarrassment to Hollywood as he is a
savior to the movie-going public. I feel I'm ready to finally accept the
comedian for what he is. And after this makes 200 million at the box
office, I'd bet your money on more projects to come.</P>
