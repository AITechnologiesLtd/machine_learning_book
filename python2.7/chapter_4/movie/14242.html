                                     PI
                          A movie review by Joe Barlow
                              (c) Copyright 1998</PRE>
<P>STARRING:   Sean Gullette, Mark Margolis, Ben Shenkman, Pamela Hart
DIRECTOR:   Darren Aronofsky
WRITERS:    Darren Aronofsky, Sean Gullette, Eric Watson
RATED/YEAR: R/1998</P>
<PRE>                   RATING: *** (out of a possible *****)</PRE>
<P>        "Pi," the highly-touted debut film from writer/director Darren
Aronofsky, is the second movie in as many months to draw me into its
embrace, dazzle me with flashes of brilliance, then fumble the ball so
badly in the final act that many of my positive vibes were squashed.
("Snake Eyes" was the other, for those of you keeping score.)</P>
<P>        Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is a mathematician driven almost to the
point of madness by his passion for science.  He firmly believes that the
entire universe is governed by the laws of math, and that these laws
leave traces of their presence in every aspect of reality; as such, if
one can decipher the code, one would then be able to predict anything and
everything: the way creamer will swirl around in your coffee cup, the
shape of snowflakes, the price of stocks, the secrets of creation... even
the true name of God.</P>
<P>        With assistance from his friend and mentor Sol (Mark Margolis),
Max is attempting to find and decipher this code.  One afternoon, while
processing Max's latest mathematical theory, his computer crashes and
blinks a 216-digit number on the screen.  Max is aghast at the loss of
his data, but as he begins to examine the strange numerals generated by
the crash, other possibilities occur to him.  The fact that this number
has exactly 216 digits is especially interesting, since his friend Lenny
(Ben Shenkman), another mathematician, firmly believes that the true name
of God is a 216-character string, numerically embedded in the Torah.</P>
<P>        The first half of the film, dealing with the construction of
the plot, is fascinating.  I'm not a stupid person, but my knowledge of
mathematics does not extend beyond some basic trig; as such, I found the
simple, concise way in which the script explains complex math theory to
be exceptionally well-done.  The details were JUST complicated enough
that I had to concentrate, but never so difficult that I got left behind.
A film that actually made me THINK!  What a pleasant surprise!</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, writer/director Aronofsky is unable to sustain the
sparks of brilliance he shows in the first part of the story.  After
setting up such an intellectual premise, he unfortunately allows the
second half of his film to generate into "Conspiracy Theory."  Max gets
chased a lot (See Max.  Run, Max, run), and a lot of evil people slap
him around for a bit inbetween the sprinting sessions.  Then Max is
confronted by Rabbi Cohen (Stephen Pearlman), who begs Max to give him the
number, explaining that "his people" need it to find the sacred chest
which was initially used to carry around the original Ten Commandments.
Huh?  Is this "Pi" or "Raiders of the Lost Ark?"  Why not throw in the
Holy Grail or Atlantis while we're at it?</P>
<P>        In addition, the final quarter of the film is basically a re-
telling of Arthur C. Clarke's famous short-story "The Nine Billion Names
of God," in which (surprise!) a mathematician helps a religious
organization decipher an ancient text to unearth the true name of the
One Deity.  The last scenes of "Pi" seem like such an obvious rip-off of
Clarke's story that I can't believe (1) there has not been a lawsuit over
it, and (2) no one else has noticed it, considering that the tale is one
of Clarke's most famous short works.</P>
<P>        But the first half of "Pi" is so intelligent and believeable that
I'm willing to cut it some slack.  Aronofsky has injected some excellent
touches into the movie.  First of all, the film is shot in black and
white, which, although done for budgetary reasons, gives a certain
dramatic flair to the production that color could not have generated.  The
acting is consistent and quite strong.  Max is clearly a man obsessed:
apart from a single chair, there are no pieces of furniture in his
apartment.  Every niche is filled with scribbled calculations and computer
equipment; in fact, during one scene I noted that Max's home resembles
nothing so much as the interior of H.A.L., as seen in "2001: A Space
Odyssey" (another Clarke reference, incidentally).  The music (primarily
techno) fits the mood well, and Matthew Libatique's cinematography is
truly groundbreaking.</P>
<P>        The film also teases the entire sci-fi genre; whereas most
directors would've filled Max's apartment with high-tech computer
equipment that would be outdated six months after the film came out,
Aronofsky has chosen a "retro" appearance for the production.  Look
closely: Max's Supercomputer Interface looks suspiciously like a
Commodore PET, with parts from other equally obsolete systems tossed in
for good measure.  It's a nice jab at contemporary sci-fi.</P>
<P>        Aronofsky has crafted a remarkable film for cinematic pocket
change (the entire movie cost around $100,000... or 1/2000th the budget
for "Titanic").  Had the tone remained cerebral, we may well have had
one of the year's best films; as it stands, this slice of "Pi" is
occasionally tasty, but not particularly filling.</P>
