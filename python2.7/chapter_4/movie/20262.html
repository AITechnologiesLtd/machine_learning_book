<P>Bowfinger Review
Starring: Steve Martin, Heather Graham, Eddie Murphy</P>
<P>  Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy are generally known as comic geniuses, but each
have had their hits and misses. During the 90's however, there has been more
misses. Thankfully, that streak has been broken, and it's just happened in the
nick of time.</P>
<P>  In this funny comedy, Bowfinger (Steve Martin) is a lousy director who's only
goal is to make the film "Chubby Rain". The only way it can be distributed
however is if Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) is cast. With a budget of only $2000
there is no way  he is going to be able to cast Kit. So he rounds up a film
crew, and cleverly films the actors going up to Kit whenever they see him.
Unfortunately Kit disappears, so they cast a look alike named Jeff (also played
by Eddie Murphy) to help finish Kit's scenes. This is where the film starts
flowing. It's so outrageously funny the way Bowfinger will literally do
anything to get this film done, even if it means breaking the law, stealing
etc. It really shows how starved some directors are to make a film, at any
cost.</P>
<P>  The whole idea itself is very witty. The type of film Bowfinger was creating
was so ridiculous, it could have passed for an Ed Wood film.  It really shows
how desperate people are for entertainment. Actually in a way, Bowfinger was
like the Ed Wood films. He would steal props, beg on his hands and knees for
the script to get a go-ahead etc. The film's humor though, can't match Ed
Wood's. Bowfinger was witty , and wasn't particulary concerned with anything
besides humor, but even some of the humor was rather amateurish at times. It
was as if the script was desperate for any type of laugh. Ed Wood however was
based on a true story, and that made it all the more stylish and amusing.</P>
<P>  The film started out generally slow, but when Kit's brother appeared, the
film picked up pace. The guy was so nerdy and clueless, you coudln't help but
like him. Without his character, the film would have suffered, because Kit had
too many moronic things revolving around him. The whole Mind Head thing fell
flat, and was not needed. Steve Martin gave a nice enthusiastic performance.
What better actor could create an obsessed director striving for his film to be
finished? Heather Graham was a waste. All she did was sleep around to get her
way, but she was mainly there to look nice, and that's what she did.</P>
<P>  Despite some of it's tiresome humor, the film really gets the general message
across, and for that, it is inspiring. Young directors will appreciate the
film's power, because I'm sure many, like Bowfinger are going through the same
experience, minus
the comedic situations. </P>
<PRE>2 1/2 out of 4 stars
