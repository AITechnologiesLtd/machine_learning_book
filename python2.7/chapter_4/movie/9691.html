<P>Gunbuster / Toppu o nerae! ("Aim for the Top!") (1989)
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</P>
<P>CAPSULE: Transcends its juvenile source material to become a really unique
and powerful anime about love, growth and loss.</P>
<P>GUNBUSTER started silly, then grew and grew until it reached a climax that
knocked the wind out of me. The audience I was with expected a lightweight
girls-and-big-robots story, but they got seriously rocked back on their
psychic heels during the three-plus hour course of this remarkable anime.</P>
<P>GUNBUSTER tells the story of Noriko, a young girl hellbent on piloting mecha
for Earth's space navy. From the opening scenes, she has a long way to go:
she barely even knows the controls -- it's like one of those war-movie
sequences where the novice pilot has a crib sheep taped to the windscreen).
But the coach -- named, appropriately enough, Coach -- sees that she has
determination, and nourishes that thoroughly. Noriko eventually befriends
two other pilots: Yuriko, who plays a "big sister" role to her, and Jung
Freud, a Russian girl who is at first a rival, and then an incredible pillar
of strength in the later part of the movie.</P>
<P>As they get into the thick of combat, a new element comes into play: time
dilation. A mission which takes only five minutes subjectively causes six
months to elapse on Earth. This isn't new, but the way the movie handles it
is unique: the time-dilation effect causes Noriko to remain the same age
while the others, especially "big siser" Yuriko, age relativistically.
Ultimately it's Noriko who becomes the big sister, in a perversely brilliant
set of psychological twists, and has to summon her own strength to save the
ones who helped her before. This is the movie's greatest asset: it takes
cliched notions and then slowly turns them inside out over time, revealing a
genuine core of emotion we didn't suspect was even possible.</P>
<P>The long, drawn-out final chapter of the movie is some of the most
emotionally harrowing time I've spent in front of a screen. The filmmakers
letterboxed the final third and filmed it in *black and white* -- extremely
unusual for anime, of course, and with the net effect that we concentrate on
the characters and their climaxing dilemma, and not the pretty scenery.</P>
<P>And then we come to the coda scene, which is almost as jaw-dropping as the
closing shots of 2001 or PLANET OF THE APES. I will not describe it -- but I
will say that it must be seen in context, after the agony and anguish of the
previous segments and the cosmic upping of the ante have come and gone.</P>
