<P>    A dramatic, full motion, animation epic is always a bit risky, and
will bring, a couple of sniggers from the mouth's of audiences who are
unaccustomed to the likes. So it is not surprising that The Prince of
Egypt, runs a difficult and lonely race against the dominating likes of
cute Disney animation flicks. But the fact it dares to be different pays
off, and those familiar with the story of Moses and the word Exodus,
will not be alienated by the plot, because it does not stray very far
from what is actually recorded in the Bible.
      There are odd moments of humour thrown in amidst the drama, but
these are so off beat that one is unsure whether to laugh or not. An
example is Moses post-sandstorm - a scene more reminiscent of a
Roadrunner cartoon. Besides these slight hiccups, the heavy score
composed by Hans Zimmer and Stephen Shwartz is well suited to the grand
scale of the story. And the special effects are bigger, better and
badder than the Cecil B. DeMille version of the same story, The Ten
Commandments. Of particular note are the burning bush and the parting of
the Red Sea. In fact, the parting of the sea, can be more accurately
described as the parting of an ocean – take my word, there's a lot of
water!
     As for the cast, Ralph Fiennes' wonderful accent lends Pharoah a
kind of British air that would have been missing from the original, but
is otherwise in character. Val Kilmer loans more of a humble tone to the
modest, troubled Moses. Michelle Pfeiffer sings well as Tzipporah, watch
for her part in the movie, which is sung by Mariah Carey in the hit
single We Believe. You will also recognise many other famous names in
the other lead roles, but in particular Steve Martin and Martin Short
lend their talents to one of the few, in synch, humorous parts of the
movie as the high priests, Hotep and Huy. Overall this is an immense
achievement from Dreamworks who have worked hard to develop an animation
epic that is worth watching.</P>
