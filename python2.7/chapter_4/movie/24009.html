<P>It's astounding, how many of us turn into lawyers when we get wrapped up in 
cases. I remember the Louise Woodward affair, for example, when I knew all 
the evidence from the courtroom pictures on TV, and was able to reel off 
detailed arguments crushing people who had just looked at her and assumed she 
was guilty. Passion about justice is what makes people consider law careers; 
it chills me when I see sell-outs trying to condemn obviously innocent 
people, or using dishonest tactics to help the guilty.</P>
<P>Stephen Soderbergh's "Erin Brockovich" is a brilliant story of anger turning 
into courtroom skills; a David versus Goliath-style exposé in the great 
tradition of "Silkwood", "A Civil Action" and "The Insider". At its centre is 
a woman with no judiciary training or expertise, whose mind was not 
complicated with red tape or histories of statutes, and whose discoveries and 
simple logical interpretations helped small-time lawyers win one of the 
biggest lawsuits in American history.</P>
<P>Her name, of course, is Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts), and when we meet her 
in the opening scenes of this film, she's just a struggling single mother who 
has failed to win a personal injury settlement. Soon after, she hustles her 
way into a filing job at the firm of her solicitor. The boss, Ed Masry 
(Albert Finney), objects, but Erin makes her services hard to refuse: "I need 
a job. Don't make me beg. If it doesn't work out, fire me."</P>
<P>When handling the real estate documents of a town in California, Erin notices 
something odd -- they all include medical records. Researching this further, 
she stumbles on the information that the area's water supplier, Pacific Gas & 
Electric, has been using a dangerous chemical known as 'hexavalent Chromium 
3' in their pipes. 'Chromium 3' can penetrate the body to cause pretty much 
any illness, including all forms of cancer.</P>
<P>What's especially horrific is that PG&E knew about the hazards of their water 
and misinformed its customers that chromium was good for them. The people 
took the company's word, even when they all started to get sick, until Erin 
Brockovich revealed her findings, and used her common touch to encourage the 
folks to stand up and take legal action.</P>
<P>Brockovich is not always a likeable character. At the start of the movie, 
when no job interviewers will look past her lack of a resumé or 
qualifications, her feeling of victimisation is preposterous. She seems to 
think anyone who isn't stuck in the poverty trap must be some sort of snob. 
And she displays gross arrogance when defending her wardrobe, which is made 
up of mini-skirts, tight boob tubes and high-heeled boots. "As long as I have 
one ass instead of two," she tells Masry when he points out that his office 
has a dress code, "I'll wear what I god damn well please."</P>
<P>But none of these flaws take away from her achievement, which is that she 
worked hard, taught herself some tough skills, became a great friend and 
advocate for victims of an abominable crime, and managed to raise a family at 
the same time. This is one of Roberts's most impressive performances, her 
best since "Pretty Woman" (1990), because she really does look affected by 
the pressures her character has to cope with. She allows herself to be 
vulnerable, with a voice that can quiver and stumble. She doesn't always have 
the answers, and could break down at any minute. There are one or two 
irritating episodes of grandstanding, where she rattles off snappy, heroic 
speeches that probably took the screenwriter hours to write; but that's kind 
of obligatory, and I'm just glad that such moments don't dominate the film.</P>
<P>"Erin Brockovich" is not necessarily better than the films I previously 
mentioned, but has advantages over each of them in one way or another. It's 
more fast-paced and accessible than "Silkwood", angrier about its subject 
matter than "A Civil Action" and less sidetracked than "The Insider". I'm 
starting to love director Soderbergh's new visual style, too, which he also 
used in "Out of Sight", and mixes the colour palette and star power of big 
studio movies with the documentary camera and quiet pacing of realistic 
independents. Sounds distracting. But it's oddly compelling.</P>
