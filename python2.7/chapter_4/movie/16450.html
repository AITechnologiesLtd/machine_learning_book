<PRE>THE LAST DAYS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In the waning months of World War II, when Hitler would naturally have 
been expected to marshal his forces in the German homeland to protect 
its citizens, he sent his troops in the opposite direction to invade 
Hungary.</P>
<P>Over and above his dreams of world domination for his "Reich that would 
live a thousand years" was his dedication to the infamous "Final 
Solution."  By the last 6 months of the war, Hungary had the largest 
remaining Jewish population in Europe.  By conquering one last country, 
Hitler planned the mass extermination of the Jews that lived there.  In 
a record 12 brutal weeks, he rounded most of them up and sent them off 
to concentration camps to be annihilated.</P>
<P>James Moll's lucid documentary, THE LAST DAYS, tells the little known 
story of horror and courage of this final Jewish purge of the war.  
Interviewing a few of the Hungarian Holocaust survivors and avoiding the 
overlaying of a supercilious narrator, the story has a quiet and 
unmanipulative power.  (To those of you who are thinking that you 
already know the story, you probably don't know this one.  Even if you 
are one of the few that do, you'll gain fresh insights and see some 
chilling footage that you almost certainly haven't seen.)</P>
<P>Moll makes an inviting and intriguing documentary by weaving lush color 
scenes of Hungary today with black and white images of it in the height 
of the Nazi occupation.  One gets a genuine appreciation for what the 
Jews lost when they were forced out of their homes.</P>
<P>Chief among the stories you may know is that of the courageous Swedish 
diplomat Raoul Wallenberg.  He came to Budapest and obtained middle 
class apartment complexes where he housed Jews.  Giving them fake 
Swedish passports, he claimed that these Jews were on their way to 
protection in Sweden and therefore could not be captured by the Nazis.  
That he got away with these audacious acts is a miracle, but these phony 
ids saved thousands from the gas chambers.</P>
<P>Most Jews were shuttled off to the camps to be experimented on and to 
die.  Upon their arrival, families were divided into 2 lines - those who 
would live and those who would die.  The young and the old, as in those 
over 50, were routinely exterminated.  By the time those chosen to live 
had been processed into their barracks, their less fortunate loved loves 
were already dead.</P>
<P>The massive terror that the concentration inhabitants had to endure is 
hard to fathom so the film sticks to a few examples.  One woman talks of 
the eye experiments conducted on them.  They were given eye drops and 
stuck in a pitch-black basement for days with nothing to eat or drink.  
Standing in water the whole time in the flooded basement, they drank the 
same water into which they had to urinate and defecate.  When they 
emerged, some of them were blind for days.</P>
<P>The movie's most shocking new scene will undoubtedly evoke a strong 
visceral reaction in audiences.  We have all seen images of emaciated 
victims of the Nazi's cruelty, but they are usually black and white 
pictures of barely moving near-corpses.  THE LAST DAYS has some color 
footage of a half dozen naked men waddling away from the camera.  With 
malnourished bones and basically no fat, these men are reduced to a 
state where each step looks like it could be their last.</P>
<P>The movie ends with one of the women going back to her old home in 
Hungary for the first time since the war.  She finds their holy 
synagogue stripped of its Stars of David and now used as a secular 
concert hall.  She meets one old neighbor who remembers her.  He says he 
knows about the Holocaust because he's seen the movies.  He asks her 
casually if it really was as bad as the movies made it appear.  
"Unfortunately, it was worse than the movies," she replies with a look 
that suggests that she knows that he will never come close to 
understanding.</P>
<P>THE LAST DAYS runs a fast 1:28.  It is rated PG-13 for graphic images 
and descriptions of Holocaust atrocities and would be an excellent film 
for teenagers.</P>
