Only in New York
The Out of Towners</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Road trip movies have one thing in common -- the concept of getting there.
Perhaps that's why I get antsy; awaiting the delayed arrival, most of the
movie seems ... well, pending. You might not expect a movie named "Out of
Towners" to spend a lot of time on the road, but it does.</P>
<P>With their son off to Europe, Henry (Martin) and Nancy (Hawn) can no longer
ignore the creaky sounds of their crusty rutty marriage. (Witnessing Goldie
and Steve bicker like your parents might make you feel prematurely gray.)
However, a 10 AM job interview for Henry, sends this average Ohio couple New
York bound. A painful array of mishaps prevents them from making the trip in
a straight line. Somewhere among the obstacles, they rediscover their
marriage. But it's the flea circus of calamity, that brings us from the
beginning of the film to the end and balances us like a spinning plate on
the pointed edge of tedium.</P>
<P>That said, Steve and Goldie are brilliant and hilarious, despite the working
conditions. This is the more wild and woolly Steve of "Planes, Trains and
Automobiles" from which "Out of Towners" borrows the infamous car rental
scene. A big Steve fan myself, I enjoyed his performance in this picture.
Goldie was rock solid as well, and John Cleese is 100% stand-up British
pomp.</P>
<P>It's the star power that gravitates this rather aggravating plot from the
depths it would surely have found without them. Seldom mediocre, "Out of
Towners" toggles between the tedious and the hilarious -- fortunately
capturing the latter more often than the former.</P>
<P>Starring Goldie Hawn, Steve Martin and John Cleese.
Directed by Sam Weisman. Based upon the screenplay by Neil Simon. Rated
PG-13
Produced by Robert Cort and David Madden, Robert Evans and Teri Schwartz at
Paramount/Robert
Evans/Cherry Alley and Cort/Madden.</P>
<P>Grade..........................B</P>
