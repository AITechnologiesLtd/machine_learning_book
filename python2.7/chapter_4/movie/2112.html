<PRE>                               BOXING HELENA
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  No, it's not a sports film.  This
     macabre and erotic story story of frustration, obsession, and
     revenge could almost make an episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT.
     It will probably turn off many viewers, but for others there
     will be a certain fascination.  This is a moderately well-
     done film if somewhat selective in its appeal.  Rating: low
     +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Dr. Nicholas Cavanaugh (played by Julian Sand) has overcome his unhappy
childhood--mostly.  The neglected son of a great surgeon is himself a great
surgeon.  He has a beautiful house, an attractive mistress, and a king-sized
obsession.  The object of his obsession is Helena (Sherilyn Fenn), a
stunningly beautiful woman with whom he has had sex once (as apparently has
just about every able-bodied man available) and who now wants nothing to do
with him.  Forget his status, his position as chief surgeon of his hospital,
he cannot stop himself from thinking about and even stalking Helena ... even
to the point where he is climbing the tree outside her bedroom window in
order to watch her love-making.  Nick tries to invite Helena to his home
only to be treated with contempt when she comes to a party he is throwing.
He lures her back to the house the next day only to have her escape, running
from the house and into the path of a hit-and-run driver.  Nick could take
her to the hospital, but decides to treat her in his home, amputating both
her legs and  making her his prisoner.  Eventually, when she tries to
strangle her captor, Nick will amputate her arms also.</P>
<P>     What we have then is a rather ghoulish variation on John Fowles' THE
COLLECTOR and at the same time an erotic fantasy.  Nick lives out his dream
of having his beloved Helena dependent on him and at the same time at his
mercy.  She obviously has objections to him personally, but he hopes if he
is sufficiently disarming she will be left without a leg to stand on.  The
ending of the tale will be disappointing to some, but one that has a time-
honored tradition, particularly in early film.</P>
<P>     BOXING HELENA is directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch, daughter to David
Lynch.  Her father probably would have done the same story every bit as
weirdly but it also would have been full of images that would be meaningful
only to him.  His daughter's style is at least comprehensible.  Perhaps as
one allusion to her having a famous father, incidentally, Lynch includes on
the soundtrack the aria "O mio babbino caro" ("Oh my dear little papa") from
Puccini's GIANNI SCHICCHI.  Speaking of Puccini, to convey the upper-class
feel of Nick's house Lynch uses as background music to scenes in the house
no less than four arias from Puccini and also fills the house with Greek
statuary--indicating she does know high class when she encounters it.  Of
course the primary piece of statuary, a reproduction of the Venus di Milo,
does fit thematically into the film.</P>
<P>     There are some problems with this story, but it does show promise for
Lynch.  My rating is a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
