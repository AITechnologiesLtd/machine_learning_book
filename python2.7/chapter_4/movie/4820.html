<P>     DOWN PERISCOPE is the big screen's answer to MCHALE'S NAVY.  With 
Kelsey Grammer in command of the USS Stingray, you can be sure that this 
isn't a drama.  Unfortunately, it's not much of a comedy, either.  There 
are occasional laughs, but, as with most movies that think they're 
funnier than they actually are, most of the jokes fall flat.  What we're 
left with is the tired, overused storyline of a bunch of mismatched 
underdogs coming together as a team in time to overcome their 
adversaries.  </P>
<P>     The best thing about DOWN PERISCOPE (in fact, just about the only 
good thing) is Kelsey Grammer's relaxed performance.  Although best 
known for his role as TV's FRASIER, Grammer exhibits a big screen 
presence.  He doesn't appear to be a great actor, but, unlike so many 
stars making the TV-to-movie switch, his likability doesn't get lost in 
the transition.</P>
<P>     Grammer plays career Navy man Thomas Dodge, the proverbial loose 
cannon.  After serving his country for more than twenty years, Dodge is 
finally awarded his first submarine command -- the old diesel rust 
bucket USS Stingray.  His crew is comprised of the usual misfits, 
including a female officer (Lauren Holly, whose film career has taken 
off), a hyperactive second-in-command (Rob Schneider, looking a lot like 
Emilio Estevez), an electrician with an affinity for getting shocked 
(Toby Huss), and a sonar operator who does a credible whale imitation 
(Harland Williams).  Many of these characters have personal and 
professional problems that are resolved during their stay on the 
Stingray.</P>
<P>     Dodge is supposed to lead his boat on a mock assault of two East 
Coast targets.  It's the Stingray against the U.S. Navy.  One admiral 
(Rip Torn) thinks that a diesel sub can still pose a threat to the 
United States, while another (Bruce Dern) is convinced that today's 
nuclear vessels represent an impenetrable barrier.  The war games are 
designed to decide the issue.  At stake for Dodge is his future in the 
Navy -- if he succeeds, he gets a permanent command; if he fails, he 
gets a desk job.</P>
<P>     Undoubtedly, the most entertaining part of DOWN PERISCOPE comes 
during the end credits, when various cast members "let down their hair" 
to join the Village People in a lively, campy rock video for their '70s 
hit, "In the Navy."  There's a lot more energy in this four-minute 
segment than in the hour-and-a-half that precedes it.</P>
<P>     There are quite a few submarine movies available -- certainly 
enough to provide material for a decent satire.  Unfortunately, DOWN 
PERISCOPE is more interested in regurgitating formulas that we've seen 
literally dozens of times before.  (THE BAD NEWS BEARS under water?)  
Other than briefly lampooning the XO's mutiny from CRIMSON TIDE, this 
picture fires duds, relying on cheap sex jokes and slapstick gags to 
garner laughs.  Down and out with DOWN PERISCOPE.</P>
