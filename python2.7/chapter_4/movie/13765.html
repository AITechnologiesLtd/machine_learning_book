<PRE>                        Godzilla (PG) - UK Review.</PRE>
<P>Based on the infamous Japenese legend, Godzilla is a tale of a huge lizard,
it's mutated size caused by French nuclear testing.  It's taller than the
Empire State Building and has a huge appetite! What's worse, is that
Godzilla has suddenly turned up in New York and is causing loadsa chaos as
it tramples around, it's purpose unclear.</P>
<P>Naturally, the authorities are somewhat distressed at a huge lizard
wrecking buildings and doing untold damage, so the chase is on to destroy
this monster before it flattens the city. Add to the affray Matthew
Broderick, a nuclear scientist and Jean Reno, a French secret service agent
and you have a mix for two hours of fun.</P>
<P>Performances are quite good all round. Jean Reno (Leon) although underused,
is excellent.  There are some unexepected digs at the expense of the
Americans, courtesy of chewing gum and coffee (you'll see) and Broderick
gives some occasional, fine, comic deliveries.</P>
<P>Naturally, the real stars of Godzilla are the special effects.  Seen before
in Independence Day, they are provided again here to provide some quite
spectacular scences of chaos and destruction.</P>
<P>On the downside, the story isn't really strong enough to sustain the two
hours and I felt my attention occasionally wandering.  Some scences in
Godzilla will strongly remind you of Jurassic park and this film could have
been easily wrapped up in 90 minutes.</P>
<P>Putting these flaws aside, Godzilla is a fun romp.  The effects are quite
something, there are some great chase scences and even some quite tense
moments.  Worth seeing, especially for kids, they'll love it.</P>
