<PRE>                              MILLER'S CROSSING
                      A film review by Evelyn C. Leeper
                       Copyright 1991 Evelyn C. Leeper</PRE>
<P>     Since the movie reviews are normally handled by the more hirsute member
of the Leeper Consortium, it is rare indeed that I take pen in hand (or in
this case, keyboard in lap) to review a film.  But circumstances compel me
to do so for MILLER'S CROSSING.  What circumstances?  Well, if I don't, you
won't know to drop everything and go see this movie.</P>
<P>     Of course, for many of you, just the statement that this is another
movie from Joel and Ethan Cohn (RAISING ARIZONA, BLOOD SIMPLE) is enough.
And if I say Albert Finney is in it, that will drag a few more of you down
to your local cinema (or not-so-local cinema--this film is not exactly in
what might be termed wide release).  But if that isn't enough, how about the
following:</P>
<P>   - Excellent acting, especially by Gabriel Byrne (as Tom Regan) and Joe
     Polito (as Joe Caspar).</P>
<P>   - Wonderful cinematography by Barry Sonnenfield</P>
<P>   - Beautiful Irish-inspired score by Carter Burwell, including the most
     perfect rendition of "Danny Boy" I have ever heard (special screen
     credit was given to tenor William Preston Robertson for this).</P>
<PRE>   - Well-written script by Joel Cohn.</PRE>
<P>     Regarding the script, you should be warned: buy your popcorn and make
your rest stops *before* the film starts.  If you leave the theater, even for
five minutes, you will never figure out what's going on when you get back.
This is a very dense plot, and much of what is important about the
relationships between the various people is given in "toss-away" lines.
This, of course, is a lot like real life, where people generally do not say,
"Well, ever since Tom passed Bill over for that promotion, Bill has had it
in for Tom," but rather things like, "You shouldn't be surprised at what
Bill did; after all, remember that promotion."</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, this film has come and gone in most areas (or, more
likely, not come at all).  Luckily, this means that it will probably be on
videocassette in a few months.  While the wide screen is better for the
appreciation of the technical details in this film, the ability to pause,
play back, and in general analyze the script may make up for that loss.
This is a definite "must-see" film.</P>
