<P>****
1994, R, 92 minutes [1 hour, 32 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Brian O'Halloran (Dante), Jeff Anderson (Randal), Marilyn
Ghiglotti (Veronica), Jason Mewes (Jay), Lisa Spoonauer (Caitlin),
produced by Kevin Smith, Scott Mosier, written and directed by Kevin
Smith.</P>
<P>        "Clerks" is really a landmark in film history, although I don't
think anyone will recognize it as such. This is a film that cost about
$25,000 to make, yet it is much more enjoyable and better written than
most commercial films costing a thousand times as much. This is a film
about Generation X slackers hanging out in a convenient store talking
about their lives and little idiosyncrasies in a way that is so mundane,
yet so unique and sometimes vulgar, but still brilliantly hysterical. We
don't get a story with characters trying to overcome a conflict, we
essentially get a fictional documentary that really captures the essence
of dialogue, especially modern dialogue. Many non-Gen Xers may find it
rather offensive and unrealistic at times, but those of us who are
essentially the same as the characters in the film can relate all too
well.</P>
<P>This is a film about two buddies hanging out in their place of
employment. There is Dante (O'Halloran), the clerk who tries to do his job
and get on with his life -  "I don't bother them and they don't bother
me." Dante hates his life but somehow finds a way to deal with it, he
comes to work and does his job just hoping that tomorrow will be a better
day. And then there is Randal (Anderson), the rude, but very funny slacker
who represents the attitude that we Gen Xers think, but don't say aloud.
He speaks his mind, he poses questions that we don't really think about
(one involving an extremely detailed, but very hilarious analysis, of the
"Star Wars" films), he also refuses to be nice to customers, nor swallow
his pride just for the sake of etiquette and courtesy. </P>
<P>Dante and Randal are both 22, work full time at minimum wage jobs
serving the public, are not in school and may never go back. They hate
everyone and everything, and this tension is often relieved on their
customers. The entire atmosphere of the film is so campy and almost
"realistic" in a way, as it was shot in a very grainy black and white and
does not feature a celebrity, which only makes the tone more suited for
the story. These bare essentials are what force us to pay attention to the
basic elements of theme, mood, and dialogue.</P>
<P>I can relate to this film so well because I have had experience in
very similar occupations. There are conversations in this movie that are
almost word-for-word duplications of conversations I have had with
co-workers. For example, when Dante and Randal start to complain about
customers and their stupid questions, I was dying laughing because it was
just so true for me. There is a very funny scene in which Randal beats a
customer at their own game, as he blatantly admits that he doesn't care
for them and that it feels good to point out the shortcomings of others,
ahh... how true that is. Even if you are not, or never have been in a
position like this, it is still hysterical because of the genius knack of
dialogue that Kevin Smith has, and his sense of character for Gen Xers. </P>
<P>Dante and his girlfriend Veronica (Ghiglotti) constantly argue
over the importance of college, the differences in the requirements to
make men and women come to orgasm, and deciding who and what is most
important in a relationship. Specific examples are not given, but the
entire atmosphere of the film really gives one the sense of what modern
relationships are based on, that is, nothing. </P>
<P>At some points "Clerks" can get rather crude, but the dialogue did
not seem unbelievable to me. Even though the actors are not professionals,
they are able to deliver a credible and very entertaining performance.
There are many scenes where it is obvious that they are reading cue cards,
one scene even shows the actor admitting that he messed up the line, but
the improvisation is still funny and does not break our concentration at
all. </P>
<P>I still think that "Clerks" is truly a landmark of sorts, as it is
somewhat following a trend of telling funny stories about "nothing" as
this story is the epitome of that idea and does not become commercial at
all, as it relies upon its originality and comical genius to provide for a
very funny, very entertaining, and very unique film unlike any you will
ever see. Kevin Smith has basically exploited my generation, and for that
I thank him. [other films by Smith: "Mallrats"] (3/19/96) (12/18/96)</P>
