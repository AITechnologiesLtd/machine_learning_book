<PRE>NO WAY TO TREAT A LADY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>As a jolly Irish priest, Christopher Gill (Rod Steiger) charms the
lonely woman in her small apartment.  Telling her funny stories, he
begins to tickle her, and, as her laughs turn into convulsions, he
reaches over and strangles her to death.  He leaves her, his first in a
series of victims, in the bathroom with his trademark lips painted on
her forehead using her own lipstick.</P>
<P>In town to receive a tribute from San Jose's Cinequest film festival as
a maverick motion picture legend, Steiger chose 1968's NO WAY TO TREAT A
LADY to show as one of his personal favorites.  I asked him about the
movie, and his mixed emotions about it showed.  He complained bitterly
that, since the studio never got behind the movie, it did poorly at the
box office.  It later became very popular on television, which helped in
rejuvenating his career.  Opening as it did with the controversial scene
above, one can partially understand why the studios back then were
nonplussed.  Still, the delicious black comedy has such appeal, it is a
shame that it wasn't more aggressively marketed.</P>
<P>The killer's nemesis in the story is a detective named Morris Brummel,
who lives with his complaining Jewish mother.  A good-spirited George
Segal gives a likable and inviting performance as Detective Brummel.
The detective is taunted by the killer, who likes to call him after each
murder.  "Remember, I'm smarter than you," Christopher admonishes the
detective.</P>
<P>Steiger clearly had great fun with his part.  He told me that he was
cocky back then.  "Who is this guy Peter Sellers?" he said, referring to
Sellers's fame for being able to play multiple parts in a single movie.
Steiger wanted to outdo him.</P>
<P>Steiger gets to really chew up the scenery in NO WAY TO TREAT A LADY,
and he has the time of his life doing it.  Skirting the fine line of
overacting, he doesn't go over it until the last scene, in which his
pent-up energy explodes in an over-the-top scene in which director Jack
Smight should have restrained him some.</P>
<P>The movie wasn't just a vehicle for Steiger to dazzle us with his acting
feats.  It also contains a credible and sweet, little love story between
Segal and a very sexy Lee Remick, as Kate Palmer, a woman who saw the
killer briefly at the first crime scene.  Segal has all the shy
giddiness of a man unaccustomed to love.  Setting her sights on the
detective, Kate flirts with him in a beautiful display of womanly
charms.  He remarks on their second meeting about her spending a lot of
time getting "dolled up."  Shaking her head she explains, "Getting
dolled up is easy; looking natural takes time."</P>
<P>Kate is pleased to be taken seriously.  Her previous boyfriend, who only
liked her body, made fun of her mind.  "What mind?" he mocked her.  "A
thought of yours would die of loneliness."</P>
<P>The audacious killer enjoys taking risks as much as developing new
accents and disguises.  On one call to the detective, he phones from his
table at a busy, upscale Manhattan restaurant.</P>
<P>John Gay's intelligent script has the detective develop a clever
stratagem for stopping the serial murderer.  When the killer's finally
trapped, we feel a bit sorry for him.  Steiger's characterization of him
has won our hearts.  As black comedies go, this is one of the sunniest.</P>
<P>NO WAY TO TREAT A LADY runs 1:48.  It is not rated but might be an R
for, mainly off-screen, violence and mature themes and would be fine for
teenagers.</P>
