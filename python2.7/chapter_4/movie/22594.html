<P>Any Given Sunday: all the longest yards</P>
<P>Any Given Sunday opens tight on the ball, pre-snap, and if it wasn't in
widescreen we might think it's really just Sunday afternoon again. But then
there's the tribal music pounding in, which, along with all the fancy
camerawork, is a giveaway that this is Oliver Stone football. Meaning lots
of stylized slow-motion and upbeat sounds, working contrapuntally to lend a
little magic to the gridiron. It's the same kind of opening Speilberg uses
with Saving Private Ryan, where we're on the beaches of Normandy for the
first twenty-five minutes or so, getting lost in the battle, (i.e.,
acclimatized to WWII) only here the battle is between men wearing regulation
pads, coaches chewing high-blood pressure meds like candy. It lasts just as
long as Spielberg's Normandy, though, if not longer, and, as that opening
game is rendered so well, so indulgently, our critical faculties are dulled
the littlest bit, just enough to where we won't necessarily question all
that comes after. It's a common trick, (Ludivico Treatment, yes) though only
the big-name directors seem to have enough pull with the studios to get away
with it. The rest have to do as The Last Boy Scout does, and try to compress
it all into one five-minute sequence. Which results in things like Billy
Cole using a pistol on the playing field, which, yes, illustrates the kinds
of pressure these guys are under quite effectively, but at the cost of other
things best not sacrificed.</P>
<P>Once things get started with Any Given Sunday, however--and in spite of all
the camerawork--it's all pigskins and dollar signs, (and cameos) or, better
yet, the friction between pigskins and dollar signs. As Coach D'Amato
(Pacino, still hoarse from The Insider) says, football irrevocably changed
the first time a time-out was called for a commercial. As he sees it, TV is
killing the game, but then, too, the game he's talking about is the game of
his youth, all tinted with Lombardian nostalgia, 'pure,' not at all the same
game his third-string 'star' quarterback Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx) is
playing, which caters to the cameras. As any good hero must be, too, he's
more or less alone in his thinking: neither do his players seem to agree
with him, nor does his boss, hard-driving owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron
Diaz). Yet he's got a season to win. And if that wasn't enough stacked
against him, he also seems to be dealing with it in all the generic
self-destructive ways (bourbon, Elizabeth Berkley).</P>
<P>And yes, his dilemma is the crux of the movie upon which everything else
turns, but to understand it you have to look away from him, not to Jerry
Maguire or Love of the Game or any of the other sports-type vehicles, but
deeper into Any Given Sunday itself, the minor characters whom Stone uses
very effectively, for a change. Specifically, the little dynamic going on
between Dr. Mandrake (James Woods) and Dr. Powers (Matthew Modine), a
dynamic wherein the younger slowly becomes the older, in spite of his
efforts not to. Stone just slips this in as if it's happenstance, filler,
but it's anything but: instead of just distracting us for a few moments with
good acting (Woods and Modine) or venting the tension of the previous scene
or anything like that, the Mandrake/Powers dynamic presents in its barest
terms what's fundamentally going on in the rest of Any Given Sunday: the
ritual torch-passing. This is Stone, after all; ritual does comes first,
last, and in the middle. And not just for Mandrake and Powers, but for
Pagniacci and her dead father; for Beaman and aging quarterback Cap Rooney
(Everybody's All American Dennis Quaid, still making faces like Doc
Holliday); and last, for D'Amato and his idol, the venerable Vince Lombardi.
Everybody's slowly (170 min.) turning into someone else, on-screen, and, to
Stone's credit, it works, though it might have worked better without the
redemptive coda. But so be it. At least Any Given Sunday never falls into
the pit of hero worship, never tries to deal head-on with the social issues
involved with gladiator sports. And yes, it is a seriously long movie, but
it had to be, too. Otherwise all the music wouldn't have fit.</P>
