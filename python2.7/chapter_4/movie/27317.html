<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A very good sequel to "The Invisible Man (33)," though not as
imaginative as the original. Vincent Price plays Geoffrey Radcliffe, a
wealthy owner of a mining company and sponsor of a humanitarian
research-medical facility on the premises. He has been framed for
murdering his brother nine years ago and is about to be executed in two
hours. He is visited in prison by Dr. Frank Griffin (Sutton), the
brother of the original Invisible Man genius scientist who invented a
formula to become invisible, and he uses his brother's serum to inject
his benefactor Geoffrey Radcliffe so he can escape from prison
undetected. He will now try to find the real killer and in a
race-against-time, Frank will try to find an antidote, as one of the
side effects of the invisible serum, is that if he can't be returned to
visibility, madness will occur at any time.</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoilers to follow.</PRE>
<P>Geoffrey's beautiful fiancée Helen Munson (Nan Grey) meets him in the
reclusive gamekeeper's house where he can be seen because he is dressed
with sunglasses and bandages wrapped around his head and is wearing
clothes that Frank gave him. He bemoans his fate and vows to get the
killer, and she reaffirms her unrelenting love for him. A barking dog
gives away the hideout, as a snooping policeman uncovers that there is
someone in the house. When Scotland Yard Inspector Samson (Kellaway)
arrives at the scene, he already knows about the scientific work of
Griffin's deceased brother and his experimental serum, and realizes that
he is after an invisible man. In an amusing scene, despite the use of
cigar smoke, Geoffrey escapes undetected from the house and the police
are reduced to putting a tail on Helen and Frank.</P>
<P>Geoffrey's cousin Richard Cobb (Hardwicke), sporting a villainous
mustache, while secretly pining for Helen, comforts her and tells her he
wants to help, if he only knew where Geoffrey was he will send him
money. He benefited from the death of Geoffrey's brother and Geoffrey's
prison sentence and his expected execution means that he will not only
run the mining company but upon Geoffrey's death will officially inherit
it. Under Cobb's rein, the miners are disgruntled, as a former watchman
in the mining company, a Mr. Willie Spears (Napier), now is the cruel
and ignorant supervisor, chosen by Cobb to oversee the workers.</P>
<P>The search for the killer was too obvious to be interesting, but the fun
to be had was when the side effects to the serum kicked in and Geoffrey
became egomaniacal. In a supper scene with Frank and Helen, he declares
"I want worshippers not friends -- I will reward them for their
loyalty." There is also a great special effects scene, where the police
have him trapped in Cobb's house and use smoke bombs to try and detect
him. The film received a nomination for a Special Effects Oscar in 1941.</P>
