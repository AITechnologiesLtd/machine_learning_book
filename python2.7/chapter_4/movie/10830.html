<P>by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>    Desperate Measures is a film that takes an interesting idea, adds
two great actors (Andy Garcia and Michael Keaton), a director who knows
what he's doing, and ends up giving the audience a lot of action film
cliches. There is so much potential here that it is a little upsetting
to see that the script misleads the film into a by-the-numbers formula.
As standard as it is, the execution is professional, and the acting
superb. I recommend it based specifically on these merits.</P>
<P>    Garcia stars as Frank Connor, a San Francisco cop whose son, Matt
(Joseph Cross), has leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant. Through
a few illegal maneuvers, Connor learns that the only available donor
that matches his son is Peter McCabe (Keaton), a brutal mass-murderer
with an IQ of 150. McCabe agrees to the transplant, but only to be given
the chance to escape. Naturally, he does escape, and then Connor is
forced to fight against the local police (they are trying to kill
McCabe) in order to save the criminal and ultimately save his son.</P>
<P>    I've read that the story for this film is silly, but I
disagree--during a time of the year in which films bankrupt on new and
clever ideas are dominant, it's kind of nice to see something that is
high-concept. The problem here lies in the regression from good ideas to
overused action cliches. What begins with enticing dialogue between the
hero and the villain ends in car chases and roof-leaping mayhem. It's
not that these elements are purely bad, it's just that we've seen it all
before. There isn't anything new about these particular chase sequences
or roof-jumping stunts.</P>
<P>    I observed another large problem in character motivation. Most of
the film takes place in the hospital, after McCabe escapes. However,
instead of getting out of the building (which doesn't seem like it would
be as hard as getting away in the first place), McCabe sticks around and
takes hostages, almost as if he's trying to give Connor a chance to
catch him. Later, despite his high intelligence, McCabe does some things
that don't quite add up. Nonetheless, Keaton does a good job with the
character (he can say lines like, "I am immortal!" without sounding
dumb).</P>
<P>    Garcia is also good here, but he's given very little to do. Frank is
not an interesting character. The interactions between this man and his
son (Cross does an excellent job as the child) are moving, but Frank as
a character is little more than something to drive the plot. In the end,
we're rooting just for Matt. Marcia Gay Harden, who plays Matt's doctor,
has some good scenes but is ultimately not very interesting because of
the script. Near the start there's also a moment that bothered
me--McCabe warns Connor not to try and get inside his head. This scene
reminded me of The Silence of the Lambs, but neither the dialogue nor
Keaton can recreate the magic of Anthony Hopkins in the role of Hannibal
Lecter.</P>
<P>    There is, however, a lot to like about Desperate Measures; what I
liked most is the cinematography. Barbet Schroeder (Single White Female)
does some interesting things with camera angles and lighting, and the
set production is sharp and ominous. The film feels tight and organized,
but almost too organized, and often predicable. Because of the nature of
the film, it's possible to predict the outcome of the story after just
seeing the preview, although getting there is still entertaining.</P>
<P>    So, Desperate Measures becomes another entry in the long line of
thrillers. And, like most of them, it doesn't have a lot to set it apart
from the crowd. The execution is good, and the magnetic performers do a
lot to help it out, but these elements end up just keeping the film from
being unwatchable. Someone out there needs to make a shocking,
unpredictable film like this. With a sharper script, Desperate Measures
could have easily blown away the competition.</P>
