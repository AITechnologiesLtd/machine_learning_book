 Reviewed May 1, 1999.</PRE>
<P> For anyone who has caught on to my overall taste in movies, you know 
 that, while I give everything a chance, espionage/spy/thief action 
 pictures are definately not my cup of tea. They all seem very much the 
 same, and I find the large majority of them either dull or crushing 
 bores. But with that said, I liked "Entrapment," in a kinda-sorta way, 
 thanks to the wonderful repartee of Sean Connery (in his first good film 
 in a long time) and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is a sparkling new talent 
 that I have instantly fallen in love with. Sure, she's absolutely 
 beautiful, but she also has a sneaky way with words and is able to 
 modify her mildly underwritten character into a wholeheartedly 
 believable, not to mention likable, creation.</P>
<P> Virginia "Gin" Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a New York insurance 
 investigator who has tracked down and been following the expert art 
 thief, Robert "Mac" MacDougal (Sean Connery). After spying on him on one 
 occasion, she is awaken in the middle of the night by Mac, who reveals 
 that he is one step ahead of her. Posing as a thief herself, Gin makes a 
 proposal to him: help her steal an ancient Chinese mask worth millions. 
 As the last days of 1999 close in, which will inevitably cause a 
 "millenium bug" in all of the computers, Gin also forms another plan, 
 this one with the stakes heightened: steal $8-billion from the largest 
 and tallest bank in the world (located in Malaysia) and they will split 
 the money, but the theft has to be done during the last ten minutes 
 before the new year.</P>
<P> "Entrapment," like the similar, but in my opinion inferior, James Bond 
 films, spans across the globe from the already-mentioned Nfrom the 
 already-mentioned New York to Malaysia to Scotland, where Mac's castle 
 is located. As Mac and Gin get deeper and deeper in over their heads, 
 Mac grows suspicious of Gin's possible false identity and her motives, 
 while Gin fears that she, through all of their bickering, might actually 
 be falling for him. In case this subplot is unbelievable, don't worry. 
 Although Zeta-Jones is 28-years-old and Connery is 68, this is the least 
 to worry about when you're dealing with such a preposterous, but 
 admittedly entertaining, story. Besides, Connery has aged very well 
 (like Warren Beatty and Robert Redford), and so their budding romance 
 isn't quite as much of a stretch as the downright ragged Clint Eastwood 
 and his near-laughable womanizing character</P>
<P> Although never a particular fan of Connery's (who played James Bond 
 himself, primarily, in the '60s and '70s), he is very charismatic and 
 enjoyable here, even when we aren't sure if his character of Mac should 
 be trusted. Matching, and actually surpassing, his performance is 
 Zeta-Jones, who was last seen in "The Mask of Zorro" (which I opted to 
 skip when it was in theaters) and will be appearing in "The Haunting" 
 this July. She has a lovely, innocent, but at the same time experienced, 
 face that you could stare at for hours on end, and a fetching 
 personality to play. I loved, for example, the scene in which Mac asks 
 her if there has ever been someone she hasn't been able to seduce, and 
 without a moment's thought and with a sly grin, replies, "no." Without 
 Connery and Zeta-Jones, and without the fun that is had concerning the 
 tension between them, "Entrapment" wouldn't have been nearly as 
 successful, and it is their casting that, to me, was the most vital 
 element in making the whole picture.</P>
<P> The two action set-pieces, one in which they attempt to steal the 
 Chinese mask, and the climactic sequence in which they set out to steal 
 billions from the bank, are stylishly and expertly crafted. Back at 
 Mac's Scottish castle, he trains Gin to be able to slink through the 
 invisible criss-crossing laser beams in order to get to the mask, and a 
 great deal of suspense is stirred up in this scene. The climax, also, is 
 breathtaking, with Mac and Gin being spotted stealing the billions and 
 in their desperation to escape, must crawl out onto an unsteady wire 
 seventy stories in the air, above a prestigious New Year's celebration.</P>
<P> When all is said and done, "Entrapment" is a fun and completely amiable 
 precursor to the upcoming onslaught of Summer movies. There's nothing 
 extraordinary about it, it isn't likely to stick in your mind as some of 
 the best films do, and the plotting leaves several holes. The supporting 
 characters are all wasted, including Ving Rhames as a friend and 
 gadgetry-supplier of Mac's, but that was fine with me since the heart of 
 the film belongs to the delicate and nicely-acquired relationship 
 between Connery and Zeta-Jones. "Entrapment" isn't a particularly 
 fulfilling experience, but it easily gets the job done.</P>
