<PRE>The Great Dictator (1940)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 76</PRE>
<P>Charlie Chaplin's films always had their share of social
commentary, mixed in with a large dose of humor.
"The Great Dictator" is a very good film that accomplishes
both its goals: it is often hilarious, and it effectively
lampoons Hitler and his oppressive policies.</P>
<P>"The Great Dictator" was apparently written prior to
Hitler's invasion of Poland that triggered World War II.
Chaplin's targets are Hitler, his henchmen, Mussolini,
Hitler's treatment of Jews, and the acquisition of Austria.
Stormtroopers are invariably portrayed as bullying,
stocky and stupid.</P>
<P>Chaplin plays the story's hero, a Jewish Barber who has spent
the past twenty years unconscious in a hospital.  Upon
recovery and release, he is unaware of the changes to German
society and the new plight of the Jews.  He has no problem
getting a girlfriend (Paulette Goddard) but makes enemies with
the stormtroopers.</P>
<P>Chaplin also plays a Hitler clone.  The satire is very cleverly
done.  Hitler's fiery speeches are ridiculed, as is the
ubiquitous salute (famous statues such as "The Thinker"
are shown saluting).  Hitler's schemes to conquer the world
and install a master Aryan race are also mocked.  A Mussolini-like
character eventually arrives to argue with Hitler about
who will control Austria.  Mussolini is hilarously played
by Jack Oakie as a swaggering egotist, complete with an
exaggerated Italian accent.</P>
<P>"The Great Dictator", in addition to its heavy political
messages, marks several changes in Chaplin's career.  Although
there are many silent scenes (Hitler dances with a globe,
Jews eat puddings laced with coins that they try to put on
another's plate) this is Chaplin's first talkie.  Chaplin
does not play his Tramp character, and allows another actor
(Oakie) to upstage him.</P>
<P>While "The Great Dictator" was not the masterpiece that
his previous film ("Modern Times" from 1936) was, it
remains a fascinating film that makes an important statement
and marks an era.  It flags only in the final scenes, when
the Barber makes an uncharacteristic (and overlong)
impassioned speech.</P>
