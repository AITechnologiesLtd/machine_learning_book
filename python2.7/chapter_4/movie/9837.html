<P>     Finally, there's a legitimate challenge to Disney.  And, while it's 
unlikely that Twentieth Century Fox's ANASTASIA will break the Mouse's 
stranglehold on animated films, it's a good place to start.  ANASTASIA 
is easily the best non-Disney animated movie in recent memory, and it is 
good enough to rival such titles as THE LION KING and ALADDIN.  The key 
is enjoyability and appeal to both adults and children.  This degree of 
magic and energy has been noticeably absent in movies like POCAHONTAS, 
THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, and HERCULES.  Maybe with another studio to 
push them, Disney will get back on track.</P>
<P>     The first thing to note about this delightful animated adventure is 
that it should not be confused with an historical account of the Russian 
revolution.  Aside from borrowing a few names, facts, and dates, this is 
pure, unadulterated fantasy.  Someone expecting even a loose reliance 
upon history is going to be horrified, but then anyone who falls into 
that category probably doesn't belong at this movie in the first place.  
Even moreso than POCAHONTAS, ANASTASIA uses reality as nothing more than 
a convenient backdrop.</P>
<P>     The story opens in 1916 Russia, just before the revolution, and 
depicts the fall of Czar Nicholas II as the result of a curse placed 
upon him by the evil monk Rasputin (voice of Christopher Lloyd).  Every 
member of the Romanov family is killed, except Nicholas' mother, Marie 
(Angela Lansbury), who escapes to Paris, and the Czar's youngest 
daughter, Anastasia (Kirsten Dunst), who is missing.  Rasputin is also 
slain, but, because his curse was not fulfilled, he ends up languishing 
in limbo.</P>
<P>     Fast-forward ten years.  Marie has offered a 10 million ruble 
reward for anyone who finds her granddaughter.  Back in St. Petersburg, 
a pair of con artists, Dimitri (John Cusack) and Vladimir (Kelsey 
Grammer), are holding auditions for an "Anastasia" to take to Paris.  
When they discover Anya (Meg Ryan), little do they realize that the 18 
year old young woman is actually the real princess.  Together, Dimitri 
and Vladimir teach Anya how to act like royalty, preparing her for an 
audience with Marie.  Meanwhile, Rasputin finds a way out of his nether-
domain and plots Anastasia's demise.</P>
<P>     While the animation in ANASTASIA still doesn't quite match up to 
that of Disney's recent features, it's light years ahead of the likes of 
THE LAND BEFORE TIME, BALTO, and even AN AMERICAN TAIL (also by 
ANASTASIA's director, former Disney animator Don Bluth).  There are 
times when the characters' lips don't perfectly synch up with the 
vocals, and other occasions when the background detail is lacking, but, 
on the whole, ANASTASIA's visual pallet is quite rich.  Many of the most 
complex sequences are majestic, and effective use is made of computer 
generated effects and background paintings.  Consider, for example, an 
impressive view of a shining St. Petersburg as Anastasia approaches it 
from over a hill.</P>
<P>     Story-wise, ANASTASIA is every bit as strong as any new wave Disney 
film except BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  There's a little adventure, a little 
romance, a little mysticism, and a little drama.  The lead character is 
easily the strongest, most independent animated female to grace the 
screen, surpassing even Belle for spunk.  Meg Ryan is perfect for this 
role.  Anastasia's love interest, Dimitri, isn't very interesting, 
although John Cusack gives him a spark of personality.  The villain, 
Rasputin, looks hideous, but his nastiness is relatively generic.  In 
fact, most of the time, he's just a diversion from the real story, which 
is about Anastasia's quest to find her family.  There are two "cute" 
animals:  a voiceless dog named Pooka and a bat called Bartok (Hank 
Azaria), who is very talkative.</P>
<P>     Musically, ANASTASIA is better than anything from Disney since 
death deprived them of their key lyricist, Howard Ashman.  All of the 
big production numbers in ANASTASIA have their roots in Broadway 
musicals, with a lot of well-choreographed dancing and singing.  The 
songs themselves (there are six from Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens) 
are lively, and several, including "A Rumor in St. Petersburg", "Once 
Upon a December", and "Paris Holds the Key", stick in the memory.  It's 
interesting to note that, of those who have speaking parts, only Kelsey 
Grammer, Bernadette Peters, and Angela Lansbury are allowed to do their 
own singing.  Liz Callaway doubles for Meg Ryan, Jonathan Dokuchitz 
fills in for John Cusack, and Jim Cummings replaces Christopher Lloyd.</P>
<P>     The whole process of watching ANASTASIA is a thoroughly enjoyable 
one, and it proves that any studio willing to put forth the time, money, 
and effort can match Disney.  In fact, understandably, a lot of kids 
will mistake ANASTASIA for the Mouse's latest offering.  Twentieth 
Century Fox should consider this a compliment, not a slight.  If every 
non-Disney animated film in production or on the drawing board is as 
good as ANASTASIA, the executives at the Magic Kingdom have good reason 
to worry.</P>
