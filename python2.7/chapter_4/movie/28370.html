<P>   The creationists had it wrong and now I'm not so sure
about the Darwinians.  We human beings did not simply
evolve from animals: we ARE animals.  If the silly but often
funny comedy from Joe Roth's Revolution Studios has any
major idea to convey, it is the well-worn verity that beneath
our thin layer of civilized skin lies a thick mess of animal
instincts itching to emerge but kept down, so to speak, by the
rules of polite society.  In Tom Brady's screenplay--which is,
thank goodness, only mildly vulgar, always remembering that
polite society has dropped into the theater with kids to watch--
Marvin (Rob Schneider) represents both the nerdy exterior so
common to many of us and the libidinous urges that we
sublimate and compensate for whenever we go to work or
play a quick game of pick-up (basketball).    </P>
<P>   Marv's with forensics in the police force of a small town and
though he's not a uniformed cop, he dreams of becoming
one.  After going beyond the call of duty in pursuit of felons,
he has a terrible accident which knocks him out, but his life is
saved by a mad scientist, Dr. Wilder (Michael Caton), who
patches him up with the organs culled from his lab collection
of goats, dogs, cats, horses and chimps.  After detecting
heroin by sniffing the rear of a passenger at the airport,
Marvin is lionized, inducted into the police force as a full
officer, and now possesses the confidence to introduce
himself to a cutie running an animal shelter, Rianna (Colleen
Haskell in her debut role).  From then on, Luke Greenfield
directs the human beast into a series of skits that could have
been gleaned from Saturday Night Live, giving Schneider a
chance to show off his considerable comedic talents.</P>
<P>   Besides proving that we people are all animals, the movie
demonstrates that human beings are not at all superior to our
brothers and sisters in our own kingdom.  When Marv takes
on the dimensions of a seal, he saves the mayor's son; a
dog, he sniffs out drugs and runs sixty miles per hour; a
chimp, he swings from branches like Michelle Yeoh, eluding
the cops, particularly his hostile and envious partner Sgt. Sisk
(John C. McGinley).</P>
<P>   If you like girl-next-door types as I do (Renee Zellweger for
example,) you'll fall big for Colleen Haskell and in general
you'll realize that when physical comedy stays within the
bounds of reasonable decency, it can begin to approach the
merits of the screwball comedies of the thirties that make the
world forget the Depression for a while.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 83 minutes.  (C)2001,
