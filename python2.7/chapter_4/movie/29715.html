<P>PLOT:
A dude and his brother are driving cross-country and decide to fool around with
a trucker on their CB radio. It isn't long before their little prank gets
someone put into a coma (long story) and the next thing you know, the trucker is
following them too. Lotsa nuttiness ensues and then, they pick up their other
friend, Venna, a girl who the dude has a crush on. But what's this...? The
trucker is still on their tail and is now harassing all three of the young
whippersnappers...? You bet! Buckle up, Dorothy...this is gonna be one bumpy
ride!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A good ol' time at the movies! Here's a film that actually gives away most of
its plotline in its trailer and doesn't really bring anything "new" to the
forefront (if you've seen flicks like DUEL and BREAKDOWN, you've crossed this
path before), but still manages to entertain you gangbusters, with realistic
situations, believable characters, funny moments, thrills, chills, the whole
shebang. Let's give it up for director John Dahl, who continues to put out solid
films every other year (if you haven't seen RED ROCK WEST, do yourself a favor
right now, and jot it down on a piece of paper and rent it at your earliest
convenience). And much like that film, this one has an excellent premise and
sets everything up at an even pace. It gives you a little bit of background on
each of the main three characters, and then shows you how one small prank, can
lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone! Paul Walker really surprised me in
this movie, since I've never much thought of him as anything more than a pretty
face (and damn, is it ever pretty or what?!) But here, he actually manages to
put some depth behind the looks and that's always appreciated in films in which
you are so closely tied to the main characters. Sobieski is also good, but she
isn't in the movie for as long as you'd think, but the man who really takes this
film to another level, is Steve Zahn.</P>
<P>If you've loved this guy as the "goofball" in most of his previous roles, you'll
appreciate him even more here, as the dude who starts off as one of the most
manic and excited human beings I've seen in quite some time ("This is so
awesome!!"), only to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of the
flick. And speaking of the ending, boy, does this movie deliver some chilling
moments during its final 15 clicks or what?!? The Arrow and I were practically
in each others arms (well, maybe I'm exaggerating, but you catch my drift) as
each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn, took it all to
an even higher level. Once again, kudos to director Dahl for being able to
generate that type of intensity, suspense and tension, with a great score,
editing, style and camerawork. Plot-wise, I too did wonder how the "bad guy" was
able to track them so well, but it didn't really bother me all that much (you
can assume that he had bugged their car?). But pretty much everything else in
the story stuck like glue and I couldn't help but put myself in their shoes and
appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance. A great movie with an even
cooler ending, this film will likely be remembered as one of the better
thrillers of the year. "This is amazing!!!"</P>
