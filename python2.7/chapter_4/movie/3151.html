                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1994 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>You Tarzan, me Nell.  December is here and that means we have hit the
peak of the Academy Award hunting season.  The latest contestant trying
to grab some Oscar statues is NELL, the new movie starring Jodie
Foster and Liam Neeson.</P>
<P>     Deep in the forest, in a small cabin, hidden away from the rest of
society by a  reclusive mother, lives Nell (Jodie Foster).  When a
delivery boy accidentally finds her mother dead,  Dr. Jerome Lovell (Liam
Neeson) and the local Sheriff hike to the cabin where they discover
this mysterious woman who speaks in her own language and is terrified
of strangers.  Curious and anxious to help her, Lovell approaches Dr.
Paula Olsen (Natasha Richardson), a behavioral scientist, to help him
diagnose Nell's condition.</P>
<P>     Nell proves enigmatic at first and soon Olsen and Lovell are at
odds about what is the best solution for her welfare.  Interested in
advancing her academic career, Olsen wants Nell in a hospital while the
compassionate, slightly obsessive Lovell wants her left alone, afraid
that she will become the guinea-pig of the month and then forgotten
about in a little cell.  A court tells them to observe her for three
months in her natural environment to find more facts before a decision
is made as to whether Nell should be taken from her home.  The film
then moves back to the mountains where Lovell and Olsen learn about
Nell and come to terms with each other.</P>
<P>     Not afraid of challenging roles, Foster has given herself a tough
one in this film.  It is a fine line she must walk to make her
character mysterious and not laughable.  Indeed, there are times where
it is tempting to giggle out loud at her Nell-speak, but she overcomes
it with her sheer commitment to the character.  Her performance would
have been more effective with a less is more approach because it is her
non-verbal communication that is most expressive.  Foster has very
revealing eyes, a gift that all the best actors seem to have.  It is
through her eyes that we feel her happiness, her sorrow and her fear
the most, not the ga-ga-goo-goo Nell-speak.  While Foster doesn't hit
the bull's-eyes, her portrayal of Nell works overall and it is more
than likely that she will end up in the best actress category at
various upcoming award shows.</P>
<P>     Equally committed to his role, Neeson is proving once again that
he is a very powerful actor.  His Lovell character as written by
screenwriters William Nicholson and Mark Handley (based on Handley's
play "Idioglossia") is thin on the development and motivation side but
Neeson's warm-hearted performance fills in the gaps and allows us to
buy Lovell's gentle obsession with Nell.  Neeson may also find himself
with some nominations but the best-actor field is going to be far more
crowded this year than the best-actress competition.</P>
<P>     Natasha Richardson's Dr. Olsen feels more like a story device than
anything else.  The sub-plot of NELL (like most movies) is will the
leading man and the leading woman fall in love.  I won't answer that
although I bet you can guess, I'll just say that their relationship is
not that interesting.  Olsen has other story functions.  She is needed
so that Lovell and Nell's relationship will not be construed as
perverse and she is also vehicle that involves the film's antagonists,
the scientific community.      Richardson, with a decent southern
accent,  makes the most of what she has to work with but it is too bad
that her relationship with Nell and Lovell could not have been more
interesting.</P>
<P>     Director Michael Apted (GORILLAS IN THE MIST, BLINK) makes the
right choice of  not pulling too hard on the heart-strings and making
the film overly sentimental.  If anything, he erred a too much on the
subtle side.  He and cinematographer Dante Spinotti  show off the North
Carolina countryside with some beautiful mountain vistas.  Production
designer Jon Hutman's sets are full of character and costume designer
Susan Lyall dresses everyone authentically.  The editing is by Jim
Clark and the score was composed by Mark Isham.</P>
<P>     NELL is the type of movie that has high aspirations.  It wants
to make profound statements about defying categorization and the folly
of pre- judgment.  However, it is the imperfect relationships between
the characters that keep this film afloat, not its grand messages.
NELL aims high and even though it falls short of its goals, there is
enough good acting and picturesque scenery to keep it from crashing.</P>
