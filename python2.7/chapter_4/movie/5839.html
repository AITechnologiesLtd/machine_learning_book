<PRE>                             BORDELLO OF BLOOD
                       A film review by Joe Blenkle
                        Copyright 1996 Joe Blenkle</PRE>
<PRE>(** out of ****) Rated R</PRE>
<P> I wasn't too excited about the first "Tales From the Crypt" movie -
Demon Knight. That's why the latest installment - Tales From the
Crypt: Bordello of Blood was a surprise to me. I've never been a real
"Crypt" fan with the goofy ghoul "The Cryptkeeper" who introduces each
tale, a little too much for my tastes.</P>
<P>Fortunately in this movie his parts were held to a minimum and were
much better done than in the first movie. But the real surprise in
this movie was a halfway interesting story that was entertaining in
spots, as well as funny.</P>
<P>Of course a big part of this was due to the fact that it starred
Dennis Miller, who spent six years honing his comedy skills on
"Saturday Night Live." Miller's part of Rafe Guttman, a down and out
private investigator, made the film. I don't think this role would
have worked without him.</P>
<P>Tales From the Crypt: Bordello of Blood is simply dumb fun, but it is
well done dumb fun. Of course with "Bordello" in the title, one can
expect nudity - and you won't be disappointed - but surprisingly none
of it is by lead actress Erika Eleniak, who has bared it all in
Playboy and appeared in a number of movies including Under Siege, A
Pyromaniac's Love Story, and The Beverly Hillbillies. Eleniak plays
Katherine Verdoux, an assistant to TV bible thumper Reverand Current
(Chris Sarandon) and Guttman's prospective love interest in the movie.</P>
<P>To briefly outline the plot, after Verdoux's punker borther Caleb
(Corey Feldman) disappears, she hires Guttman to find him and the pair
track him to a funeral home that is really a bordello - filled with
vampires - including evil personified in Lilith (Angie Everhart), an
ancient blood-sucker who will stop at nothing to get what she
wants.</P>
<P>The movie becomes too predicatble of course, for anyone who watched
the "Crypt" shows on TV. The good guys win, the good guys lose, the
good guys win...or did they? It's still fun though and Miller has got
some great lines in the movie that has the audience just short of
rolling in the aisles. </P>
<P>Be warned, however, there is lots of blood and gore, including ripping
hearts and other assorted body parts out of bodies. But for you
conniseurs of beautifil and scantily clad women, there is also a
liberal dose of them in the movie.</P>
<P>Again, if you're looking for just dumb fun, this movie is for you, but
otherwise wait for it to come out on video. It's fun enough to watch a
few times and may make a worthwhile addition to your collection.</P>
<P>Tales From the Crypt: Bordello of Blood is a Universal Pictures
presentation Dennis Miller, Erika Eleniak, Angie Everhart, Chris
Sarandon, Corey Feldman, William Sadler and John Kassier (voice of the
Crypt Keeper). Produced and Directed by: Gilbert Adler. Screenplay by
A.L. Katz and Hilbert Adler. Running time: 87 minutes.</P>
