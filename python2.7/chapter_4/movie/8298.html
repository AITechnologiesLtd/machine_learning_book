<P>     The "new" Jackie Chan film has one ingenious, arguably brilliant
sequence.  It happens at the end of the movie, in an old WWII wind
tunnel, built by the Nazis and buried somewhere in the Sahara, along
with a fortune in stolen gold.  (240 tons worth, if you can stand it!)
Chan's character, a super-spy adventurer with the code name Condor, is
squaring off against a pair of mercenaries, two of several villains who
want the gold for themselves.  The three combatants get tossed and
turned and slammed against walls and sucked toward giant propellers and,
at times, appear to hover in midair.  It's a great bit that's better
lit, better paced, and more meticulously edited than any other action
sequence in the film.  Alas, the rest of OPERATION CONDOR is strictly
lower-grade J.C.  Wacky dubbing and frantic editing are the chief
culprits, both of which may be attributable to the repackaging process.
(Chan, who also directed, trimmed some 13 minutes from the original,
which was released as ARMOR OF GOD II in 1991.) His sense of humor is
still a strong selling point and, with a "story" that takes place on
three continents, the accompanying scenery is quite nice.  I just wish
he'd staged that motorcycle sequence better.  I couldn't tell if that
was him in every shot or not.</P>
