<P>     Following graduation from a small school in Midwestern America,
Rebecca Warner (Carla Gugino) opts for a change.  Instead of sticking
close to home, she wants to go to college in Southern California.
Although her father Walter (Lane Smith) and mother Connie (Cindy
Pickett) are uncertain about the idea, they agree that it's Becca's
life, and make the two-day drive to her new school.  There they
encounter her Residential Advisor, Crawl (Pauly Shore).  The next time
the Warners meet Crawl, it's when he comes home for Thanksgiving with
Rebecca.  The person who gets off the plane isn't the same shy,
reserved girl that left three months ago, but her change in attitude
and appearance isn't the only surprise she has in store for her
family.  In order to get out of marrying an old boyfriend (Dan
Gauthier), she pretends to be engaged to Crawl.</P>
<P>     Some people like Pauly Shore (mostly teenagers, I suspect).  After
all, if those people didn't exist, SON-IN-LAW would have never been
made.  Clearly, the role of Crawl was scripted specifically for him.
Oddly enough, with someone marginally less annoying, this could have
been a somewhat charming, albeit predictable, film.  But to put Shore
in a romantic comedy is asking for trouble.</P>
<P>     There are times when it almost works, but most of those occasions
are when he abandons his stupid stage personae and does something that
approaches acting.  Unfortunately, there are too few of those moments
and, as soon as they pass, the aggravating side of Mr. Shore quickly
re-surfaces.  There are times when it becomes exceptionally difficult
to accept--not to mention like--the character of Crawl.</P>
<P>     The film has its humorous scenes, but these are formula-driven and
lacking in originality.  Perhaps the most inventive moment of
SON-IN-LAW comes as the result of a cameo by Brenden Frasier, reprising
the role he played in last summer's dud, ENCINO MAN.  It says something
about the rest of this film to site that as one of SON-IN-LAW's
highlights.</P>
<P>     The plot is stock romantic comedy material, complete with the
usual misunderstandings, break-ups, and resolutions.  The ending of
SON-IN-LAW is so sickeningly sweet that I almost went into sugar
shock.  This gives an entirely new meaning to the term "happy ending."
Blech.  I'm not against happy endings in general, but this kind of
sappiness is impossible to stomach.</P>
<P>     Carla Gugino, who has the somewhat thankless role of Rebecca, does
a fine job with the material she's been given.  In many ways, she
reminds me of Kimberly Williams (Steve Martin's daughter in the remake
of FATHER OF THE BRIDE).  Both have a certain freshness that's
enjoyable to watch.  This is especially true of Gugino in this film,
where she mercifully gives us a stable counterbalance to Shore's
idiotic antics.</P>
<P>     Since SON-IN-LAW takes place on a farm, there exists the usual run
of city-boy-out-of-his-element gags.  Of course, there's a cow milking
scene, and Shore gets to feed the pigs, pluck a turkey, and try his
hand at fishing.  It's all pretty routine stuff.  The few laughs
garnered by this line of tried-and-true humor aren't worth sitting
through ninety-five minutes of lame drivel.</P>
<P>     SON-IN-LAW is a singularly unexceptional comedy, the content of
which is well-represented by the theater trailers and TV ads.  It's
perfect fare for watching on cable, but not worth the time or effort of
making a trip to a theater.  Those who can't stand Pauly Shore would do
well to stay away, and those that love him will go regardless of what I
say.  So, for those who don't care one way or another, be aware that
SON-IN-LAW gives exactly what you expect:  a dumb, predictable romantic
comedy that has more animals than laughs.</P>
