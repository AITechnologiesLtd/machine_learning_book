<PRE>More than a few Bones to Pick
The Bone Collector</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Yes, it's thrilling, suspenseful and at times even bone-chilling. One
woman's scream becomes a crying siren of emergency vehicles rushing to save
her from being boiled alive. That's an effective scene change. In fact, "The
Bone Collector" is a pretty good movie right up to the end where it makes a
clean break into not being a very good movie -- fractured, as it were, in
several places.</P>
<P>The on and off Denzel, is more on in this movie than off while Jolie is
simply radiant. Denzel plays a paralyzed homicide investigator for whom the
rookie cop Jolie becomes the eyes, ears and body. There's a killer loose,
he's leaving all kinds of TV movie clues for Denzel to decode. The
production, direction and acting work as a team to keep this film alive and
kicking; unfortunately the poorly scripted climax overwhelms them all with
stale anti-drama and ultimately leaves the picture itself somewhat hog-tied
and whimpering.</P>
