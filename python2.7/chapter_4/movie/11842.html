A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Harold Becker</PRE>
<P>Written by: Ryne Douglas Pearson, Lawrence Konner, and Mark Rosenthal
(from a novel by Ryne Douglas Pearson)</P>
<P>Starring: Bruce Willis, Miko Hughes, Alec Baldwin, Kim Dickens</P>
<P>Ingredients: Autistic kid, disgraced FBI agent looking for redemption</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
A nine-year-old Chicago autistic boy named Simon (Miko Hughes)
accidentally breaks a top secret government code that was placed in a
dime store puzzle book. The problem is that Lt. Colonel Kudrow (Alec
Baldwin) of the National Security Agency has a lot of money invested in
the code. Kudrow reasons that if the kid can crack the code, then he's a
security hazard that must be terminated. Soon Kudrow's hired assassin
wipes out Simon's hapless parents.</P>
<P>Meanwhile down-in-the-dumps outcast FBI agent Art Jeffries (Bruce
Willis) is assigned to find Simon. He finds Simon and then, while on the
run, must figure out who's trying to murder the boy and why. In the
process, he bonds with Simon.</P>
<P>Opinion: 
The premise of MERCURY RISING sounds promising. After all, what audience
can resist feeling for a handicapped kid in trouble, hounded by
sinister, big bad government forces? Unfortunately MERCURY RISING
suffers from two major movie turnoffs: a passive hero and a contrived
plot. </P>
<P>Ideally in a movie you want a hero to be actively searching for clues or
nosing around for ways to conquer or circumvent a terrible dilemma. But
Art Jeffries - - the FBI hero of this story - - doesn't do this. He gets
chased and finds he can't trace the killer. Then he basically hangs out
and doesn't know what to do until the end of the movie, when an NSA girl
contacts him.</P>
<P>The plot? It leaves you asking questions such as "How did the dead guy
with a bullet in his brain manage get up and dial 9-1-1? And why would a
beautiful single woman wake up and willingly open her apartment at 2:00
AM to a strange man? And if the nerds knew the bad guy was a killer, why
did they just sit there and wait for the killer to kill them?" The
actions seem contrived.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the dramatic strategy behind MERCURY RISING is to
develop audience sympathy for the autistic kid and the disgraced FBI
hero and then give us a happy ending for them. MERCURY RISING does this. </P>
