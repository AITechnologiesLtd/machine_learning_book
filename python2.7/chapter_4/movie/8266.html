<PRE>                            OPERATION CONDOR
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     The easiest put-down of the ever popular Jackie Chan movies is
that if you've seen one, you've seen 'em all.  Although the statement
has an undeniable truth, Jackie has so much charisma that seeing him
again can be a delightful little diversion.  Afterall, the James Bond
films have a remarkable sameness, but a legacy that appears endless.</P>
<P>     Jackie's skills are many and his energy is boundless.  His shtick
can best be described as an action ballet played to the physical limits
of endurance and always firmly rooted in comedy.</P>
<P>     His more recent releases, JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE and RUMBLE IN
THE BRONX, take themselves somewhat seriously.  His 1990 film,
originally titled ARMOUR OF GOD II: OPERATION CONDOR and rereleased as
simply OPERATION CONDOR, has a more innocent looking Jackie, if that is
possible.  This film, unlike his more recent ones, stays firmly in the
campy vein.  All of the actors have the word "farce" written at the top
of their contracts, especially the bad guys, of whom there are legions
for Jackie to confront.</P>
<P>     Jackie has played in over fifty films and directed thirteen with
this one being the last he directed.  For someone as young looking and
hard driving as Jackie, one wonders how he does it.  Cloning?</P>
<P>     This movie finds Jackie in the African dessert where he has been
commissioned to find buried Nazi gold.  It starts with a scene that
seem lifted out of INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, which was
released the year before, but director Jackie stages it for much
broader humor that Steven Spielberg did.</P>
<P>     The carefully choreographed, non-stop action sequences sometimes
go awry as shown in the crazy outtakes at the end.  But in the final
cut of the movie proper, they would get near perfect scores from any
Olympic judge.  A typical scene has Jackie, riding on his motorcycle,
being chased by a convoy of villains in identical black sedans.  When
he gets trapped in a narrow alleyway, he flips the bike around and
drives over them, breaking all of their windshields.  And then of
course the chase continues.</P>
<P>     Jackie's attractions are many -- his teddy bear demeanor, his
intense likability, his seeming vulnerability and most of all, his
mastery of the delayed reaction.  He does all of his own stunts, and it
is a miracle that he is still alive.</P>
<P>     What OPERATION CONDOR lacks is a compelling story and a credible
script.  ("Stop hitting me," Jackie politely requests of the guys
beating him to a pulp.  "Stop hitting me, okay?")</P>
<P>     After innumerable fighting sequences we come to the film's big
conclusion set in a wind tunnel.  This admittedly clever idea, goes on
so long it far overstays its welcome.</P>
<P>     This fun little show, which has no pretenses, will amuse most
people, but Jackie's true fans may view it as a kind of masterpiece of
the genre.  For those of who are not fans, its laughs will be forgotten
minutes after we exit the theater.</P>
<P>     OPERATION CONDOR runs a fast 1:30.  It is in jarringly dubbed
English.  The film is rated PG-13 for the constant, but campy martial
arts action.  The show would be fine for kids around eight and up.  I
give it thumbs up and ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
