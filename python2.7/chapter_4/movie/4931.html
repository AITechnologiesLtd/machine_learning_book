<P>     Woof!  DIABOLIQUE reminds me of those activity-book pages that I
used to love-- the ones titled "what's wrong with this picture?" So many
problems surface in this failed French-film remake that it's difficult
to know where to start!  The tone is the worst-- an overly oppressive
mood that lands with an almost-audible thud.  The characters then play
too close to camp, which is probably the best way to take this tabloid-
worthy tale of a wife (Isabelle Adjani) and a mistress (Sharon Stone)
who conspire to kill their husband/ lover (Chazz Palminteri).  Try this
for dialogue:  "If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not hang for
fried chicken." No, not as good-bad as SHOWGIRLS, but close.  Very
close.  The defining moment comes at the end, when Stone and Adjani are
finishing some business in the shallow end of a swimming pool.  Cut to
an underwater shot of their struggle and both actresses are still
wearing heels.  Ouch.</P>
