(Paramount/UIP)
Director: Brian Robbins

Lester, Scott Caan, Richard 
Lineback, Thomas Duffy
Running time: 105 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Dawson's Creek resident hunk James Van Der Beek goes from
playing a sensitive school kid tackling some of life's riddles on the
small screen to a sensitive kid tackling some of life's ironies on the
big screen in his first major feature film role.</P>
<P>On the surface Varsity Blues is another movie about football
and the pressures of competing. However, director Brian Robbins (Good
Burger, etc) and writer W Peter Iliff (Patriot Games, Point Break,
etc) give the film a more human aspect that will appeal to those not
normally attracted towards sports oriented movies.  Varsity Blues also
deals with teenage angst, the problems of parental expectations, and
the decisions they are often forced to make that will shape their
lives forever.</P>
<P>Everything in the small Texan town of West Canaan revolves
around the local high school team.  Disillusioned fathers live
vicariously through their son's achievements on the football field,
while the whole town basks in the glory of their triumphs.  Even the
town sheriff overlooks many of their high-spirited pranks.</P>
<P>However, for Jon Moxon (Van Der Beek), football has lost that
element of pure fun that he and his team mates enjoyed as children.
He doesn't buy into the football as a metaphor for life angle espoused
by ruthless coach Bud Kimble (Jon Voight).  Kimble is a legend in the
town for his on field success, although that has come at a high price.
Mox believes that there is life beyond football, and that winning is
not everything.  Of course, Mox's indifference towards football brings
him into conflict with the arrogant Kimble.  We don't learn much about
Kimble's personal life, as we only see him in his office, cluttered
with trophies, and on the field.  Then we realise, somewhat sadly,
that, for him, football and coaching is his life.</P>
<P>While reluctantly warming the bench awaiting his chance to
play, he reads Kurt Vonnegut.  Kimble's star players are forced to use
pain killing injections to prolong their time of the field.  After
Lance breaks a leg after a fierce tackle, Mox is promoted to
quarterback, and becomes the new star of the team.</P>
<P>At first, he has trouble coping with the instant fame and
adulation, and loses direction for a while.  His new found fame also
threatens his relationship with Julie (Amy Smart), who doesn't like
football jocks.  Eventually, Mox manages to put everything back into
perspective and attempts to remain true to his own values.</P>
<P>Varsity Blues has plenty of bone crunching football action,
but it is Mox's off field struggle with some of life's complex
questions that will sustain the interest.  The hunky Van Der Beek will
obviously be one of the main attractions for audiences.  However,
veteran Voight weighs in with another intense, oily performance as the
obsessed and driven coach, and brings some bite to the clichéd
part.  Relative newcomers Scott Caan and Paul Walker are also solid as
two of Mox's team mates.  Ron Lester (from Good Burger) brings a
poignant touch to his role as the overweight but genial giant Billy
Bob.</P>
<P>Varsity Blues is a strong and unusually sophisticated film for
adolescents that delivers some important messages.  It also proves
that teen movies are capable of more than just ribald comedies and
slasher flicks.</P>
