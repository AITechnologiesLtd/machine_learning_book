<P>American movies are fascinated by the idea of violent lovers on the 
run.  BONNIE AND CLYDE, WILD AT HEART, NATURAL BORN KILLERS: they are 
repelled by their heartless, cruel anti-heroes, but they are also 
seduced by them, because underlying their violence is the romantic 
myth of the outlaw, an American myth if ever there was one.  DEEP 
CRIMSON is a mordant black comedy about a pair of violent lovers on 
the run, but it is a Mexican movie, and apparently Mexicans are less 
inclined to to romanticize their outlaws, because what we get is a 
portrait of homicidal loners rather different from the one we're used 
to--a portrait that is, I suspect, closer to the truth.</P>
<P>The lovers/loners in DEEP CRIMSON are Coral and Nicolas (Regina 
Orozco, Daniel Giménez Cacho).  She's a pathologically lonely single 
mother of two children, somewhat overweight but convinced that she is 
monstrously obese; he's a balding would-be Lothario, convinced that 
he's a freak because of his baldness, which he conceals with a 
hairpiece and a fedora.  She fantasizes about Charles Boyer (the time 
is the 1940s) while she reads Lonely Hearts columns in search of 
eligible men; he romances and then robs lonely women, meeting them via 
ads in Lonely Hearts columns in which he claims to look like Charles 
Boyer.</P>
<P>And so, of course, they meet.  They have an awkward first encounter; 
he leaves; he returns and they make love; he robs her and goes home.  
She, fully aware of his crime, follows him to his home, her children 
in tow, and demands that he let her live with him.  He says he can't 
have her in his home because he cannot afford to keep two children.  
She abandons the children, and--it's that kind of a 
relationship--touched by this act, he acquiesces to her demands: she 
will be his lover, and his partner in crime, helping him to select his 
victims.</P>
<P>They attempt to choose rich widows and then divest them of their 
wealth.  Unfortunately, Coral and Nicolas are not particularly good 
criminals: they manage to kill the widows, because Coral is jealous, 
but they turn out to not be so wealthy after all.  Soon the couple are 
fleeing from one backwater to another, disposing of the evidence as 
best they can after each failed scam.</P>
<P>DEEP CRIMSON has no illusions about Coral and Nicolas.  They are not 
young, beautiful, and coolly amoral.  There is nothing remotely noble 
or heroic about their anti-social stance.  Their fate is not tragic; 
it is pathetic.  The murders they commit are messy and complicated.  
And while American movies of this kind usually find the criminals more 
interesting than their victims (who tend to be rednecks, buffoons, and 
non-descripts), here each victim has a personality.  The final victim 
(Verónica Merchant), in particular, is shown to be a decent, 
hardworking, admirable young woman.  What Coral and Nicolas do to her 
is unforgivable; what they do right after that is even worse.</P>
<P>The film would be relentlessly bleak if it didn't have such a wicked 
sense of humour.  During their initial 'date,' when Nicolas notices a 
picture of Coral's children on the wall, he remarks that she failed to 
mention them in her ad.  Oh, she says, "it's just that they're so 
well-behaved that sometimes I forget they exist."  Indeed.  And in 
what may be the best scene, the murder of the couple's second victim 
(Marisa Paredes), an act of sudden and appalling brutality becomes 
laugh-out-loud funny because of the choice of murder weapon and the 
way in which its staged. </P>
<P>Arturo Ripstein directs the film with verve, although scenes do tend 
to drag on too long.  The camera lingers on each setting, giving us 
plenty of time to take in every detail; the movie is seduced by its 
own production design.  Granted, the production design is terrific--be 
it a desolate exterior shot of brown, sere grassland or a cluttered 
interior shot of a widow's homely parlour where, inevitably, a 
figurine of the Virgin Mary stares down from the mantelpiece--but the 
pacing could have been faster, if only to direct our attention away 
from the realization that, despite the fresh approach, the story 
itself is nothing new (quite literally, since it's based on a true 
story previously filmed as THE HONEYMOON KILLERS).  There's a fine 
line between inevitability and predictability, and the plot of DEEP 
CRIMSON stays on the right side of that line, but only just.</P>
<P>Happily, aside from its morbid wit, the movie brings a great deal of 
insight to the story.  It understands that the Bonnies and Clydes of 
the world are few and far between, and murder is usually committed by 
desperate, lonely, confused people who probably never thought they 
were capable of killing, but one day they were pushed over the edge by 
factors that remain incomprehensible to them, by some insignificant 
event, and there was no turning back.  And then, if they're like Coral 
and Nicolas, they cling to whomever they can for as long as they can, 
and pray that someone, somewhere, will forgive them, although they 
know it's not bloody likely.</P>
