<P>Talk about ironic titles! Although the phrase "Return To Paradise" 
conjures up images of a tropical romance, the film is actually an intense,
 harrowing drama focusing on friendship, sacrifice, ethics and personal 
responsibility. Director Joseph Ruben has crafted a riveting morality 
play you won't soon forget.</P>
<P>It begins in Malaysia, where three buddies are wrapping up a hedonistic 
vacation. Sheriff (Vince Vaughn) and Tony (David Conrad) head for home, 
while their pal Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix) stays behind to pursue his work 
with animals.</P>
<P>Cut to two years later, when Beth (Anne Heche) visits Sheriff and Tony in 
New York. Introducing herself as Lewis' attorney, she lays out the 
nightmarish scenario. Minutes after the men departed, police raided their 
cabin and found enough hash to convict Lewis of possession with intent to 
sell, an offense punishable by death. </P>
<P>Beth wants the men to go back and accept responsibility for their share 
of the stash. If they do, the charges will be reduced to simple 
possession and Lewis will eventually be freed. If both men confess, 
they'll receive three years each. If only one confesses, he'll be jailed 
for six years. And if they both refuse, Lewis will be led to the gallows 
and hung. His execution date is a mere eight days away. </P>
<P>What would you do? Would you save the life of your friend by voluntarily 
subjecting yourself to a sentence in a hellish third-world prison? Or 
would simply say no and go about your business, with the burden of his 
death on your shoulders for the rest of your life?</P>
<P>There isn't a simple solution and thankfully, the story doesn't opt for 
easy answers. Based on the 1989 French film "Force Majeure," "Return To 
Paradise" keeps its focus on the gut-wrenching situation. Although the 
screenplay occasionally becomes sluggish during the New York scenes, 
director Joseph Ruben never lessens the intense feel. By the time the 
film reached its unexpected climax, I was left emotionally drained.</P>
<P>While all of the performances are strong, Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche 
deserve special mention. Vaughn, who became a star with his electrifying 
turn in "Swingers," gives depth to Sheriff, a likable young man 
accustomed to going through life on cruise control, always ready for a 
quick exit when things get dicey. Vaughn makes the callow youth's crisis 
of conscience seem credible. </P>
<P>Anne Heche gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as the desperate and 
determined Beth, whose character starts off strong and becomes even more 
engrossing as the movie goes along. Over the last couple of years, Heche 
has made an impact that handily overshadows her high-profile personal 
life. From her engagingly loopy cameo in "I Know What You Did Last 
Summer" to her delicate comic work as the romantic lead in "Six Days 
Seven Nights," Heche has proven herself one of the most versatile and 
talented actors working today.</P>
<P>"Return To Paradise" could easily have turned into "Midnight Express Jr.,
" but the writers have more integrity than that. Just when you're ready 
to dismiss the Malaysians as ruthless barbarians, one of their judges 
delivers a blistering indictment of the United States approach to social 
problems that is jarring because it contains so much truth. </P>
<P>Likewise, the American media takes some heavy shots, as their bullying, 
morally superior stance towards the policies of foreign nations 
exacerbates an already horrible situation.</P>
<P>Despite the slow spots and periodic lapses into melodrama, "Return To 
Paradise" succeeds because it makes us squirm. Long after leaving the 
theater, the film's central question stays with me. What would I do in 
that situation? I still don't know the answer.</P>
