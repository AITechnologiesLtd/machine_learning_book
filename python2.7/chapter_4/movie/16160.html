<PRE>The Last Supper
As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>What if you could go back in time to Austria, 1909, and eat lunch with an
Austrian art student named Adolf. Do you kill him? Is the death of another
for the greater good worth the act of killing? Therein lies the premise of
the dark dramity/thriller The Last Supper.</P>
<P>Five liberal grad students invite someone over to dinner every Sunday to
talk. About religion; about politics; about sex; about anything and
everything. But when they end up killing (in self defense) one of their
dinner guests -- a psychopath who believes that Hitler was right -- things
change. The liberals decide to stop talking and start taking action: in the
form of a series of murders of hard-line conservatives.</P>
<P>The five get almost addicted to the murders: they form their outlet to
political frustrations in life. They right wrongs, they prevent murders, but
is what they're doing right?</P>
<P>The film is obviously an essay, but is one of the beautiful essays so open
to interoperation that it is nearly impossible to not interpret towards an
outcome you desire. You could say that it is an endorsement, flat-out, of
conservatives: if liberals are killing people, then conservatives should be
the saner group by default. Others could say that the film endorses
liberals. You can believe the ones who died did so for the greater good.</P>
<P>On a raw critical aspect it lacks in performances or skillful direction but
makes up for it in creative genius. I have never seen a film be so political
without saying a definitive word one way or the other. Nor have I seen such
a quirky plot come off as believable. Also, never has a film crossed my eyes
that has been so satiric without screaming its metaphor in your face. It is
a world in which almost nothing is sure. One thing, however, is for sure:
the film has a definitive message, but it is sheltered so in as much
ambiguity as the plot.</P>
