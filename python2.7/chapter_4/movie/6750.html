                       A film review by Bryant Frazer

<P>I should first mention that I've never read the Henry James
novel on which Jane Campion's version of THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY is
based. I should further confess that I never cared at all for
THE PIANO, Campion's 1993 study of a similarly hapless
character. And so it was that, having absorbed a handful of
rousing critical hosannahs (from Amy Taubin, Sheila Benson,
Film Comment's Kathleen Murphy, and Sight and Sound's Lizzie
Francke), I made a reluctant opening weekend pilgrimage to
the theater, propped my eyelids open with toothpicks, and
tried my best not to slouch in my seat. I found my efforts
rewarded -- paced at the bare threshold of monotony, THE
PORTRAIT OF A LADY certainly demands rapt attention, although
viewers' response to the picture seems to vary wildly. Once I
had made it through to the very end, I had decided it was at
least a moving experience if a languorous one.</P>
<P>That was more than three weeks ago, and I've been fighting
off a nasty virus with a New York attitude ever since. But
now that I'm finally sitting down to write, I'm surprised at
how quickly the essence of Isabel Archer comes rushing back
at me. If you do choose to give two-and-a-half hours of
scrutiny to this carefully drawn character study, you may
want to avoid thinking too much about the movie when it's
over and consider it instead a long-term investment. Weeks or
even months later, who knows if you might not flash back on
your movie-theater memories of Isabel Archer's pale blue
eyes, Gilbert Osmond's affected disdain for "dingy people,"
or the romantic notions of the giggling teenagers who open
the film, a cautionary bridge between past and present.</P>
<P>THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY is the story of Isabel (Nicole
Kidman), a beautiful American abroad who seems to have her
choice of eligible bachelors. As the film opens, she's
baffling friends and family by declining the marriage
proposal of the rich Lord Warburton (Richard Grant) and
rebuking the advances of Caspar Goodwood (Viggo Mortenson),
who has followed her from New York. Her sickly cousin Ralph
(Martin Donovan), himself more than a little enamored of her,
is looking forward to seeing where her willful independence
will lead her. And when her uncle (John Gielgud, briefly)
dies and wills her a sizable fortune, it looks as though the
entire world is spread out before her.</P>
<P>Despite her intentions, Isabel's fine life is derailed by
Osmond (John Malkovich), who schemes after her newly acquired
fortune. Isabel is introduced to Osmond by Madame Merle
(Barbara Hershey), who we come to suspect has her own reasons
for luring Isabel into his lair. Believing the rather sour
Osmond to be a man driven by his lofty tastes and refined
sensibilities, Isabel becomes engaged to him against the
warnings and protestations of Ralph, who contends that Osmond
just wants Isabel's money. As it turns out, Osmond wants more
than her money. He's a self-important sadist who wants to
control her and to own her, to add her to his expansive hoard
of arty trinkets. What ensues is a sort of psychological
horror story, as Isabel slowly comes to bear the crushing
weight of her decisions.</P>
<P>As the woman who gets Isabel into this mess, Hershey is fine,
but there's a striving intensity to her performance that
constantly reminds you that it's just that -- a performance.
Malkovich, meanwhile, plays to the cheap seats as Isabel's
seducer and obvious adversary (is anyone else constantly
reminded that Malkovich and Malevolence share so many letters
in common?). His casting has come under some criticism, but
there's a delicious (if inappropriate) melodrama inherent in
the scenes where he and Hershey play off one another that
adds a little vinegar to the proceedings. The supporting
players are uniformly fine, with the exception of Mary-Louise
Parker as Isabel's journalist friend. The less said the
better, perhaps, though *shrill* isn't quite the right word and
*irritating* doesn't begin to cover the bases. So poorly does
she reflect on Campion's direction that I thought I'd have to
leave the theater.</P>
<P>Some critics have held that Isabel is at best inscrutable and
at worst unappealing as the object of all this attention
(from her suitors as well as from the audience), but
Campion's film has to be approached as a study of interiors,
not of exteriors. A fantasy sequence near the film's
beginning where Isabel imagines making love with three
different men helps establish the film largely as Isabel's
subjective experience, not as the story told by some
omniscient narrator on whose head falls the burden of proof.
Fortunately, Kidman's performance invited me right inside the
lady's head, where I simply felt her motivations rather than
deducing them. As misguided as her decisions are, they make
emotional sense in terms of her well-meaning determination to
give her life over to only the most extraordinary of men.
When she falls for Malkovich's cruel, pseudointellectual snow
job of a courtship, it's tragic but in keeping with a
character who's trying far too hard to do the right thing at
the expense of her mortal soul.</P>
<P>It's worth noting that the audience -- an upscale Manhattan
crowd, supposedly the perfect demographic for a new Campion
outing -- had far less patience with all this business than I
did. The restlessness in the auditorium was palpable, and
every so often a heavy sigh -- or, worse, a giggle -- drifted
through the air. Campion's least effective when she's the
most self-conscious -- utilizing a statue with its stone
penis snapped off, posing Hershey in front of a gigantic
crucifix as she plays Judas, or tilting a street scene at an
awkward angle and then *rotating the damn camera on its axis.*
(Snickering is certainly a valid response.) Stuart Dryburgh's
cinematography, as insistently expressive as Wojciech Kilar's
score, keeps the picture interesting (he does snow very well,
which suits the chilly atmosphere) but, like Hershey's
performance, calls too much attention to itself.</P>
<P>Still, I can't deny that I walked out of the theater oddly
satisfied. Campion is a confident enough filmmaker that she
can entertain flashes of mad brilliance. Witness the
surrealistic black-and-white interlude that marks the film's
halfway point, during which Isabel meets both the Lumiere
brothers and Luis Bunuel -- Campion has her heroine dreaming
in the language of the movies, which of course didn't yet
exist. I was particularly fond of one breathtaking cut that
occurs in the sequence where Malkovich consummates his
careful seduction of Isabel -- the camera is suddenly
trucking around a curved wall inset with human bones before
finding Kidman and Malkovich again. Finally, see what you
make of the exquisite, enigmatic final shot, which snaps a
picture of Isabel at the moment she realizes that she's
finally and fatally trapped -- or that the world has, once
again, opened up before her.<HR>Directed by Jane Campion
