<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Maybe… maybe! It's just a "me" thing. Maybe my view of movies is warped,
changed to a static antipathy by reel after reel after reel, only
relinquished every once in a while. Then again maybe the general view of
movies is an adulteration upon the actual quality of standard: the old weary
critc's question "Do people like good movies or do people like bad movies?"</P>
<P>I always get like this when I have to tell someone something that wouldn't
rather hear. I say this in as light of a way now as I can, like a doctor
over a dead patient. "The Man in the Iron Mask" isnt' worth the price of a
ticket.</P>
<P>The film, which I thought originally would be bad by Rule From the Critic's
Bible #126, An actor never has two critically great movies in a row (of
course that one is crap, but …), started to surprise me right off the bat,
honestly impressing me with a re-do of Versailles, which so many other films
about France failed utterly in accomplishing. It then delved itself into a
rich tapestry of life and made me think, honestly think that the movie would
be the surprise of '98, bringing this terrifying start to a bad year to an
end (although on repute I have heard that the movie "Dark City" is the one
to see if you are interested in breaking the Bad Movie Binge). Then you
brought in the main plot element: The Man in the Iron Mask.</P>
<P>After that it just becomes this dull and repetitious movie, with stupid item
after stupid item. You realize how poor the dialogue is, how sadly done the
movie is, and how bored out of your gourd you are. This takes about an hour
and a half.</P>
<P>But then why, you ask, are so many people coming away from it with a smile
on their face? Because the movie is a feel-good movie with a feel good
ending, and, as cheap as it is it will end up a hit due to the raw star
power of the Oscar-robber DiCaprio, who's new $20 Million a movie salary
matches his power to draw female audiences, should he want, to salivate
pavlovian like over a Banana Split at a Governer's in Maine. Hey, no one
ever said an actor couldn't make two hits in a row (Rule from the Critic's
Bible #127).</P>
