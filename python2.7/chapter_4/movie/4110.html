<PRE>                               TO DIE FOR
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Buck Henry's script from the novel by
          Joyce Maynard cuts a wide swath, lambasting
          lookism, the media, the sensation-hungry viewing
          public, and the triumph of style over substance.
          The film begins with a bang with on-target humor
          but loses its oomph in the mild final chapter.
          Rating: +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The screen has had a lot of smart and beautiful but cold and
calculating women.  They lurk in films like DOUBLE INDEMNITY, PRETTY
POISON, and THE LAST SEDUCTION.  Gus Van Zant's TO DIE FOR suggests
that most of us in the TV generation can no longer detect smart and it
is enough just to be beautiful.  The film is in large part a portrait
of Suzanne Stone (played by Nicole Kidman), who is a breathtaking but
pompous and clueless woman with the personality of a spider.  The film
opens with the media swarming over a sensational, sex-related crime in
the aptly-named backwater town of Little Hope, New Hampshire.  In
scatter-shot scenes we see a montage of interviews with Suzanne, with
her sister-in-law, and one with her parents and in-laws all discussing
a combination crime and sex scandal.  Eventually we start seeing the
pieces of the story in flashback.  Suzanne, the beautiful daughter from
a WASPy family marries the cutest boy in town (Matt Dillon), the bar-
tending son of a restaurateur.  Both families had misgivings over the
marriage, but Larry is awestruck by the china-doll beauty and Suzanne
is hard to say no to.  When Suzanne gets a job as the weather girl at a
local cable station, she has visions of becoming another Barbara
Walters (whom she slyly puts down for being Jewish).  When Larry, her
husband, starts hinting that it is time to have children, Suzanne
decides she has married unwisely and begins planning how to correct the
situation, perhaps with the help of three scruffy, disaffected teens
she is interviewing for a documentary.</P>
<P>     Nicole Kidman has to play Suzanne Stone as a difficult combination
of stupid and savvy.  She spouts naive pop-philosophy and empty
aphorisms and yet is able to succeed at what she wants, mostly because
of her good looks.  I would hope it was a difficult combination for
Ms. Kidman to play.  Matt Dillon glides through his role as her
husband without much apparent effort.  Standing out considerably more
are Illeana Douglas and especially Dan Hedaya as Larry's sister and
father.  There are few actors who can express suppressed rage (and
occasionally unsuppressed rage) as well as Hedaya.  Also a particularly
good casting decision was to have Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck, and
Alison Folland as the three not-too-bright teenagers.  All three, but
particularly Phoenix, look like real teenagers on the street rather
than actors, and that is a much needed effect to make the story work.
In fact, Phoenix and Folland prove to be actors more talented than one
might expect from their new-comer status.</P>
<P>     The telling of the story starts very strong and its jibes are both
on target and laugh-out-loud funny.  But the tone of the film subtly
alters during the course of the film and while the plot is tied up at
the end, the climax is just a bit quiet and under-powered for the rest
of the film.</P>
<PRE>     In the end TO DIE FOR has gotten in some good punches, but the
fight is a draw.  I give this one a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
