Starring: Heath Ledger, Shannyn Sossamon, Mark Addy, Rufus Sewell, Alan Tudyk,
Paul Bettany</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Just avoid it. It's that simple. `A Knight's Tale' is a new medieval jousting
comedy/drama that molds itself into whatever the story requires, with little
regard for plausibility, time, reason, or feeling. The movie is like a young
child that's just discovered clay. It is juvenile, and severely lacking in form,
content, and consistency.</P>
<P>That said, Heath Ledger is awfully good as William Thatcher, a squire who takes
over his dead master's position in of-noble-blood-only jousting matches across
Europe. William has trained since childhood, and has the skills and sheer gut
for competition. He just needs some practice. As he rises to prominence, he
gains a rival (Rufus Sewell), and goes after the heart of a fair maiden (Shannyn
Sossamon). Also showing up are two annoying actors, Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk as
`humorous' sidekicks. </P>
<P>The film opens with a crowd of bloodthirsty jousting patrons hungrily awaiting
carnage, and simultaneously clapping and singing along with Queen's `We Will
Rock You'. The modern rock hit fun continues throughout, with Thin Lizzy, David
Bowie, and Heart eventually getting in on the action. The scoring gives the film
a modern effect it doesn't need. Just when writer/director Brian Helgeland
manages to get his production back on track, he derails with another song. Let's
give them Eric Clapton and sword fighting! No! Let's do Robbie Williams and
medieval slaughter!</P>
<P>It doesn't help that jousting really isn't that exciting, and Helgeland doesn't
attempt to make it so. He does, at least, explain the rules of the game, which
are helpful to the non-history-oriented, but to this 21st-century eye, the game
just comes off as silly. Thousands of years from now, I'm sure the creatures
living on Earth will think the same thing of beach volleyball.</P>
<P>After supporting roles in two other Columbia productions, `10 Things I Hate
About You' and `The Patriot', Heath Ledger gets his first starring role. He does
his best, and brings a mix of boyish charm and ruggedness often associated with
the likes of Matt Damon or fellow countryman Russell Crowe. The other
performances are passable, never quite meeting satisfactory.</P>
<P>`A Knight's Tale' tries desperately to be a younger, hipper version of
`Gladiator', and it fails. It doesn't matter that the story veers nowhere, and
the supporting actors need medical help, but that Helgeland has no, even vague,
point to this whole mess. Add that the film is almost never entertaining or
funny, and its quality, even as airplane entertainment, becomes highly
questionable.</P>
<P>But what about Heath Ledger, the smiling, good-looking Australian star? Well, he
has better things ahead of him, hopefully. He's talented, and gives this summer
movie masses of deceiving credibility. Better luck next time.</P>
