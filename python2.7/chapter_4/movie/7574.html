                       A film review by  Dr. T. White
                        Copyright 1997 Flying Inkpot</PRE>
<P>Director: Michael Hoffman Screenplay: Terrel Seltzer and Ellen Simon
Producer:Via Rosa Productions / Fox 2000 Pictures
Running Time: Approx. 108 minutes.
Cast: Michelle Pfeiffer, George Clooney, Mae Whitman, Alex Linz
Rating: ***1/2 out of *****</P>
<P>OK, I admit I had a bad attitude about this film from the start. A romantic
comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents? With a
couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure? Yuck.</P>
<P>But it's not really too bad. It has a lot working against it, for me at
least. In addition to the above, it is typical of a lot of recent movies
in that it is really just a glorified made-for-TV movie, but longer and
with bigger stars, and you have to pay to see it. It does win you over,
though, even if it is painfully predictable.</P>
<P>Just think about it: Two single parents, with their cute kids, are
thrown together due to a missed field trip. Through a day of near
disasters, they cont inually meet, get in one another's way, cause
trouble for one another, and generally insult one another at every
opportunity. In fact, they hate each other so much that we know that
they are, or soon will be, in love. The only people who hate each other
more than lovers are married couples.</P>
<P>So this film is predictable, just as the screwball comedies of the
classical Hollywood cinema were predictable (and the screwball genre is
obviously Hoffman's model for this film). Will they get fired from their
yuppie jobs? Will they make the big soccer game that is so important to
their kids? Will Pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex-husband, a drummer
for Bruce Springsteen, really is (aren't they all?)? Will they finally
kiss? Well, what do you expect?</P>
<P>But there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations
fulfilled, especially when it is done with as much humour, along with a
lack of sticky sentimentality, as it is in this film. Pfeiffer and
Clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming,
and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal
the show.</P>
<P>One word of caution, though. This film is being billed in some places as
a "family" movie. Don't let that stop you. However, I think most kids,
especially boys, would be pretty bored by this move. After all, nobody
gets killed and there are no explosions.</P>
<P>All in all, a good, non-offensive date movie.</P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
* Wait for the TV2 broadcast.
** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
*** Pretty good, bring a friend.
**** Amazing, potent stuff.
***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
