<P>   The ad for "Wide Awake" notes, "First kisses.  Outrageous
pranks.  A teacher with a killer fastball.  To survive this year,
Joshua Beal will have to stay wide awake."  Don't be fooled. 
There is quite a bit of drama in the film but most of it is
internal.  One of the teachers may indeed have had a killer
fastball, and if two lips touched, the intimacy happened so
quickly that no one in the audience saw it.  The pranks in
"Animal House" might have been outrageous but the most
abominable undiscipline here is a tie between a kid who rides
a mop and pail through the halls of the Catholic grammar
school and another who takes a picture of the Pope out in the
rain.</P>
<P>   "Wide Awake," unlike other coming-of-age stories, is not
about a kid's fears of not fitting in or not getting a date or of
needing to escape from abusive parents or an intolerable
school.  It deals with a ten-year-old's search for God, no less,
and the principal suspense it generates is, "Does he or does
he not find Him?"  Suspense, however, is no more writer-
director M. Night Shyamalan's concern than is physical action,
and the only resemblance to disease-of-the-week activity is
one young man's suffering an epileptic fit, a contrived gesture
that does nonetheless serve to put the central figure in touch
with the fragility of human existence at all ages.  </P>
<P>   Ten-year-olds, however gifted, do not often spend much
time pondering metaphysical issues.  What prompts the
adorable Joshua Beal's search for God at such a young age
is his closeness with his grandfather, a man who had recently
died of bone marrow cancer and who enjoyed a few heart-
tugging scenes with his grandson that made his condition all
too identifiable.  At one point in Joshua's memory the aging
Grandpa Beal (Robert Loggia) is in church with Joshua
(Joseph Cross), allowing the little one to play with his face,
when the priest calls for all sick members of the congregation
to step up to the pulpit to receive wafers.  At another time,
Joshua is competing with his classmates in a hundred-yard
dash, falls down, and observes his grandpa at the finish line
prodding him to get up and finish the event--as if to say that
this would be the last time the two would enjoy an athletic
event together.</P>
<P>   "Wide Awake" takes a few obligatory pokes at the nuns, but
this is no diatribe from the pen of a Christopher Durang.  The
ladies in habits do not physically abuse their charges, save in
one case in which a kid is dragged back to the classroom by
his ears.  On the contrary they are understanding and even
enjoyed by a bunch of boys who act so unlike some cliques 
in a tough urban school that a cynical city teacher in the
audience would laugh out loud if she were not already
shedding tears over the plight of the sensitive and loving
Joshua.  Rosie O'Donnell as Sister Terry tries to get her class
involved in Jesus' problems by situating him on a blackboard
behind the pitchers' mound hurling the sphere toward Judas
at the plate.  She discusses Joshua's search for God face to
face with the boy, not at all shocked that the fifth-grader has
briefly tried exercises of other religions in his desperate
attempt to locate Him.  Denis Leary fights hard to play a
normal, hard-working dad who, together with his wife played
by Dana Delaney looks with adoring eyes at everything his
son does, and the ensemble of boys in the school play out
their roles without sneaking a look at the camera.  Joshua's
introduction to romance is a fleeting one, but one in which he
observes himself getting "a biological reaction" when a pretty
girl flirts with him and offers him a rose.</P>
<P>   Writer M. Night Shyamalan, whose first movie feature
"Praying with Anger," is about an East Indian living in the U.S.
and making his first trip to India, must have decided he did
not want a G rating, so he threw in the "s" word four times--
which shouldn't bother anyone.  It's good to see a
heartwarming film so well realized that deals not with the
estrangement between generations but with the natural love
that the old and young can share.  Rated PG.  Running Time:
90 minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten</P>
