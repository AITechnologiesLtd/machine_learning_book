<P>     "It's my considered opinion that in the fullness of time, history 
will record the greatness of [Michael] Collins and it will be recorded 
at my expense."
          -- Eamon De Valera, President of the Republic of Ireland, 1966</P>
<P>     Of the more than five dozen films to be released this Fall, none is 
likely to generate more controversy than Neil Jordan's MICHAEL COLLINS, 
a biopic of the man who co-founded the IRA and signed the 1921 treaty 
that partitioned Ireland and provoked the 1922 civil war.  Even before 
its release, the film has fanned passions in the United Kingdom, where 
it has been tagged with such diverse labels as "ammunition for IRA 
recruiting sergeants and fund-raisers" (Ruth Dudley Edwards) and "as 
important a film as ever to be made in Ireland about Ireland" (Art 
Cosgrove).  Opponents are as vocal in their condemnation of the movie as 
supporters are in their defense of it.  Not unexpectedly, 
writer/director Neil Jordan has been obligated to affirm the picture's 
integrity, stating at the Toronto Film Festival that "Most of the people 
who accuse me of inflaming the peace process have no interest in the 
peace process whatsoever."</P>
<P>     In truth, while MICHAEL COLLINS does distort elements of history, 
most of the changes and compressions are dramatically effective.  
Certain characters are combined, a few deaths happen differently from 
what history records, and events have been streamlined.  The usage of 
such "dramatic license" is not uncommon in the development of reality-
based movies, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that it exists in this 
case.  Perhaps the most suspect element of MICHAEL COLLINS' script is 
the negative portrayal of Irish hero Eamon De Valera.  Without any real 
facts to back him up, Jordan hints that De Valera may have known about 
the assassination of Collins.  Partisans of the late President will not 
react favorably to such speculation, even though, in the context of this 
narrative, it works.</P>
<P>     Putting aside all the controversy, however, viewers are left with 
an expertly-directed and well-acted historical epic that disappoints 
only in its shallow perspective of the Irish/British and Irish/Irish 
conflicts.  For, in truth, MICHAEL COLLINS is as much the story of the 
birth pangs of the torn, troubled state as it is of one man's rise and 
fall.  This is a case where the era not only defines the character, but 
the character defines the era.  It's impossible to tell the tale of 
Michael Collins without delving into the beginnings of the IRA and the 
dramatic upsurge in support for Sinn Fein, yet there's a sense that 
important issues have been glossed over.  However, Jordan's view of 
characters and circumstances is remarkably even-handed -- he shows both 
the brutality and sensitivity of Collins' nature, turning the man into 
the central figure of an almost-Shakespearean tragedy.</P>
<P>     Strong acting is a key reason why MICHAEL COLLINS is as effective 
as it is.  Irish-born Liam Neeson, after playing a German (SCHINDLER'S 
LIST) and a Scotsman (ROB ROY), finally gets a chance to come home.  His 
portrayal of Collins is the most passionate, powerful work he has ever 
done, easily eclipsing his Oscar-nominated presentation of Oscar 
Schindler.  For well over a decade, Neeson has been carefully honing his 
talents, and the results are apparent here.</P>
<P>     Although Neeson's forceful performance drives the movie, he is 
assisted by an able supporting cast.  Aidan Quinn does his usual, solid 
job as Collins' best friend, Harry Boland.  Alan Rickman, best known for 
playing flamboyant villains (DIE HARD and Kevin Costner's ROBIN HOOD) 
gives a surprisingly low-key and introspective interpretation of De 
Valera.  Jordan veteran Stephen Rea (THE CRYING GAME) plays Ned Broy, 
Collins' spy inside British Intelligence.  And, despite a variable Irish 
accent, Julia Roberts is more than capable in the small role of Kitty 
Kiernan, the woman who brings Collins' human side to the fore.</P>
<P>     MICHAEL COLLINS opens in 1916 Dublin, with the infamous Easter 
Rising, where the better-organized British troops rout the Irish 
Volunteers.  From there, the movie progresses rapidly through the next 
two turbulent years, tracking Collins' rise in power and popularity and 
De Valera's ascension to the head of Sinn Fein.  Then, while De Valera 
is in America drumming up support for an independent Ireland, Collins' 
campaign of urban guerrilla warfare against the British proves to be a 
spectacular success.  Rejecting conventional tactics, he uses an 
"invisible army" that strikes unexpectedly with whatever means are 
available.  Informers are shot and England's Irish intelligence 
operation is brought to its knees.  By late 1921, Churchill and Lloyd 
George are willing to talk peace, and De Valera sends Collins as the 
Irish representative.  The resulting controversial treaty, the best 
Collins felt he could get at the time, fuels the drama of MICHAEL 
COLLINS' final act.  Because the agreement still requires that the Irish 
pay fealty to England's king and because it divides the country in two, 
De Valera rejects it, labeling it as a betrayal.  Civil war ensues, and, 
on August 22, 1922, Collins is assassinated while in his home district 
of Cork.</P>
<P>     Even for those who know the whole story of MICHAEL COLLINS, the 
movie is still a riveting piece of film making, capable of holding an 
audience's attention for more than two hours.  Jordan not only does an 
exceptional job recreating the Ireland of the 1920s, but presents us 
with an entirely human protagonist who's flawed yet sympathetic.  
Collins is not the brash hero of the traditional historical epic -- he's 
a tormented individual who knows that his chief talent is for creating 
mayhem, but who wants peace so desperately that he's willing to die for 
it.  Leeson's portrayal of Collins' agony during the civil war is so 
real that, at times, it's almost painful to watch.</P>
<P>     In tone and spirit, if not in time and place, this film shares a 
great deal with last year's Oscar-winning BRAVEHEART.  Michael Collins, 
like William Wallace, fought for independence, and, in the end, was its 
victim.  Neil Jordan felt that this story was so important that he 
nurtured the script for thirteen years until he had the clout to command 
the actors and budget he wanted.  The ultimate result may not quite 
match his ambitions, but it will still be one of 1996's most talked-
about motion pictures.</P>
