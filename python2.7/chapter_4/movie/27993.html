EXIT WOUNDS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>What happens if you single-handedly save the life of the Vice President, 
killing dozens of bad guys in the process and risking your own life?  If 
you're Steven Seagal, you will, of course, get in trouble with your 
superiors for using excessive force.</P>
<P>EXIT WOUNDS, by director Andrzej Bartkowiak, a cinematographer whose 
only other directorial assignment was on ROMEO MUST DIE, is a standard 
issue Steven Seagal picture.  With plenty of car crashes, loud 
explosions, noisy guns and corrupt cops, the script follows the usual 
formula.  Only in the brief introduction of a dot-com subtheme does the 
film vary from the standard recipe.  Why they needed two screenwriters 
(Ed Horowitz and Richard D'Ovidio) and one novelist (John Westermann) to 
come up with the canonical story is the only mystery.</P>
<P>The story opens hypocritically with the Vice President lecturing on the 
evils of guns in our society.  After this sop to morality, the 
hyperviolence begins.  Too bad they couldn't have gotten Quentin 
Tarantino to do a cameo as the Vice President.  Now, that would have 
been funny.  </P>
<P>Tom Arnold provides the movie's humor, playing controversial television 
host Henry Wayne.  Officer Orin Boyd (Seagal) meets Wayne in a 
rageaholic meeting.  Boyd is sent to the therapy session by his new 
commander, played by Jill Hennessy ("Law and Order").  Watching this 
intelligent actress being completely wasted in such a mindless role is 
embarrassing.  One only hopes that she collected a sizeable paycheck for 
the part.</P>
<P>The plot involves drugs, with Latrill Walker (DMX) being the flashiest 
big-time dealer around.  Going to a new car dealership, Latrill plunks 
down almost three hundred thousand in cash so he can drive away with the 
fastest and most expensive car on the showroom floor.</P>
<P>If you have a high tolerance for violence and like lots of stunt work, 
EXIT WOUNDS delivers.  Sit on the front row so that you can get the 
maximum adrenaline rush.  The movie is like a roller coaster ride at an 
amusement park, so you might as well go for maximum thrills.  Those 
wanting a bit more substance for their entertainment dollars would be 
well advised to pick another theater door.</P>
<P>EXIT WOUNDS runs 1:40.  It is rated R for strong violence, language and 
some sexuality/nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
