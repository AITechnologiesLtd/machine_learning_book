<P>The makers of 1993's 'In the Name of the Father'  have re-united for this
project fashioned in the same manner involving the Irish Republican Army.
 Helen Mirren and Fionnula Flanagan portray Kathleen Quigley and Annie
Higgins, two mothers whose sons went on a hunger strike to protest treatment
in prison under British rule.  Their sons Gerald Quigley and Frank Higgins
(Aidan Gillen and David O'Hara) are associates of Bobby Sands whose name was
made famous around the world when he went on a hunger strike in prison in
1981 and died.  Bobby Sands is played by John Lynch who played Paul Hill in
'In the Name of the Father' and was one of the Guilford Four sent to prison
for bombings they never committed.  'Some Mother's Son' is directed by by
Terry George who co-wrote 'In the Name of the Father' with Jim Sheridan and
the two of them collaborate on this film which is not as good as 'In the Name
of the Father' but it is compelling and well made and has historical
importance in conjunction with events still being played out to this day by
the British government and the IRA.  Helen Mirren recieved an Oscar
nomination two years ago for 'The Madness of King George' and could find
herself nominated again for this movie.  Her character is one wrestling not
only with the will of her son and the laws of Britain but with her own
conscience and her compassion for her family is uncompromising and this is a
richly textured and multi-dimensional job by Mirren for what is the best role
of her career.</P>
