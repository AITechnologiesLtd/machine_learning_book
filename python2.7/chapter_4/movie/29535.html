<PRE>John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars (2001)

<PRE> "Damn, girl! I like you already."</PRE>
<P>Starring Natasha Henstridge, Ice Cube, Pam Grier, Clea
DuVall, Jason Statham, Liam Waite, Joanna Cassidy,
Wanda DeJesus, and Richard Cetrone as "Big Daddy
Mars." Directed by John Carpenter. Rated R.</P>
<P>I haven't kept up with John Carpenter over the years.
Previous to this, my experience with the notorious
horror director has been limited to Halloween and the
much-maligned (but not by me) 1995 remake of Village
of the Damned. Now, after seeing John Carpenter's
Ghosts of Mars, I think I'll rent Starman this
weekend. His latest is exactly what I've been missing:
mindless, schlocky, well-made science fiction that
entertains without condescending. Modern sci-fi tends
to come in two varieties: thoughtful and lofty, or
downright bad. Though I always welcome the former,
it's good to see someone subvert the trend of the
latter.</P>
<P>There's a difference between a simple plot and a
stupid one. Carpenter's is a no-brainer, but it's
executed with flair, talent, and few lapses in logic.
It deals with a team of policemen in a distant-future
Mars, who are sent by train to a secluded penitentiary
to transport a prisoner - "Desolation Williams (Ice
Cube) - back to civilization for trial. The film is
framed so that we learn of the mission's only
survivor: Melanie Bradford (Natasha Henstridge). What
follows is a story told by Bradford to a group of
justices trying her for narcotics use.</P>
<P>Her team finds the prison all but abandoned; those who
are left have, for the most part, been overrun by
ghosts who possess their victims and control them,
making them mutilate their bodies and stick weird
things in their faces. Soon enough Melanie, her crew,
and the few remaining prisoners (including Williams),
barricade themselves in one of the prison buildings,
to defend against the planet's former inhabitants who
have no plans to let humanity take over.</P>
<P>After the super-accelerated set-up, Carpenter goes
into overdrive with pretty much one action sequence
after another. These are almost indescribably chaotic,
but so masterfully filmed that there is never question
about what's going on. There are scenes where just
about every character is fighting in the same frame
and everything remains clear and lucid. There's a
temptation to bash these kinds of movies; it's hokum,
yes, but what hokum.</P>
<P>I've liked Ice Cube since I saw him in Three Kings> --
where he was the most likeable character - and he
comes through as an action hero in Ghosts of Mars. He
and Henstridge have an undeniable chemistry, and even
though their
enemies-who-must-depend-on-one-another-to-survive
relationship is clichéd, I believed it. Henstridge
herself had all but disappeared after her supposedly
star-making turn in Species, and she returns to
stardom in a role that I liked, even if it's unlikely
to earn her the right to ask for a $20 million
paycheck.</P>
<P>I sat back, relaxed, and watched with an ever-present
smile on my face. I had a good time. A.I. this isn't,
but it's good, solid science fiction in the vein of
the Alien series. But whatever its shortcomings, I
refuse to give a grade lower than a B- to any movie
that ends with the exchange: "Let's go kick some
ass."/"That's what we do best." </P>
<PRE>Grade: B</PRE>
