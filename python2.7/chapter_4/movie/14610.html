<P>Touch of Evil is a lurid, enjoyable B-movie thrill ride</P>

<P>It's a moment that still thrills film buffs. Near the end of 1958's `Touch
of Evil,' Orson Welles, corpulent and slurring, looks to Marlene Dietrich,
playing a seedy border-town fortune-teller. `Tell me my future,' he says.
She looks at him contemptuously, `You haven't got any. Your future's all
used up.'
That moment, of course, resonates far beyond the plot of this lurid,
gripping and satisfying B-reel film noir, newly re-released 40 years later.
>From that point, Welles himself had no future, at least not as the
filmmaker of importance he was destined to be after `Citizen Kane' in 1941.
>From the time he descends into a dark, dirty river in the last minutes of
`Touch of Evil,' it was a long slide into voice-over narration for someone
else's forgettable movies, embarrassing talk-show appearances and kitschy
wine commercials.
The re-release of `Touch of Evil' marks a redemption for Hollywood's most
famous fat man (Saturday marks the 13th anniversary of Welles's death).
This new artifact is not merely a 40th anniversary marketing ploy. It is,
subtly but fundamentally, a different movie. Bay Area sound man and film
editor Walter Murch, one of the most admired figures in the film industry,
actually re-cut the original `Touch of Evil' according to the wishes of its
long deceased director/writer who was denied a final cut on the original.
More on that later.
`Touch of Evil' is a pop culture landmark mainly because it remains one of
the finest examples of art emerging from trash. Using the streets of Venice
(that's LA; not Italy) to resemble a scuzzy, sinister Mexican border town
called Los Robles, Welles tells the story of Mike Vargas, an upright, newly
married Mexican law enforcement officer (Charlton Heston) dealing with a
double homicide, which compels him to lock horns with his opposite number
on the U.S. side of the border, a vicious, candy-bar-chomping,
turf-conscious autocrat named Hank Quinlan (Welles).
Vargas interrupts his honeymoon to investigate a fatal car-bombing. The car
explodes on American soil, but it's clear the bomb was planted on the
Mexican side, giving Vargas justification to claim jurisdiction. But
Quinlan and his cronies are interested in a quick frame-up to put the case
to rest. Vargas then turns his attention to Quinlan's corrupt methods (such
as routinely planting evidence) and as he seeks out allies to bring down
the embittered police captain, his comely young bride (Janet Leigh) is
sucked into a vortex of danger fueled by sex, drugs and organized crime.
Potentially delicious, certainly. But such a plot can also describe
boilerplate film noir, which is apparently what Universal had in mind when
the studio barred Welles from the set after seeing his first cut and then
released its own version, complete with re-shoots of added material. It was
harsh treatment for the one-time boy-wonder filmmaker and Welles responded
in kind with a 58-page memo to Universal, outlining to the smallest detail
what he had in mind for the film.
It is from that remarkable document that Murch (the editor of such films as
`Apocalypse Now' and `The English Patient') re-assembled the picture
according to Welles's wishes. Most notably restored is the famous opening
shot, the astounding, three-minute-20-second continuous shot that begins
with an anonymous figure planting the bomb in the trunk of the car, swoops
skyward to show the layout of Los Robles and to follow the ill-fated car as
it moves through the border checkpoint, finally settling on the startled
faces of Heston and Leigh, just about to kiss, the moment the car explodes.
(That technique has been copied several times over the years, most recently
in the opening to last year's `Boogie Nights'). The philistines at
Universal had slapped opening titles all over the shot much to Welles's
chagrin. The removal of the titles was the largest of about 50 changes
Murch made to the film -- the smallest included things such as adding
off-camera grunts to the soundtrack (Welles was nothing if not a
fetishist).
All that stuff is terrific, but what makes `Touch of Evil' such a kick is
how the characterizations blend so well with their murky, menacing
surroundings. Welles especially is transfixing as the toad-like, malignant
Quinlan. When we first see him, struggling out of his car at the site of
the car bombing, his bulk, his dyspeptic expression and the small, diseased
eyes that hint at a dead soul are striking. At the time, Welles wasn't the
eminence he was later in life and he needed considerable padding and
make-up to become such a monster. To underscore the fact that Quinlan has
slipped into an abyss of self-loathing, there's a scene near the beginning
when he walks into Marlene Dietrich's salon. The two obviously have a
history, but she doesn't recognize the man he's become. Pitifully sucking
on a candy bar, Quinlan explains away his size saying `It's the hooch
mostly,' then, almost tenderly, `I wish it was your chili I was getting fat
on.'
The other major change in the film has to do with intercutting Vargas's
struggles against Quinlan with his wife's desperate straits at a desert
hotel where she is threatened by a gang of toughs under the direction of a
sleazy crime boss out to intimidate Vargas. Previously, the plotlines were
offered separately, but here the stories are woven together to create
parallel suspense.
The scenes at the remote desert hotel, where Vargas had put his wife in the
mistaken belief she'd be safe there, are by today's explicit standards
almost corny. But they are also vividly surreal, like snatches from an
interrupted nightmare. Lounging in her hotel room in her unmentionables,
Janet Leigh, who just a few years later was to participate in cinema's most
famous shower scene, radiates a disturbingly sexual kind of vulnerability
who by her very ripeness seems to invite corruption (That corruption comes
in the form of drugs, not sex). Also unforgettable is a young Dennis Weaver
as the googly-eyed, maniacal hotel manager babbling incoherently from fear
and menace. All these characters tend toward the grotesque, reminding us
that `Touch of Evil' is after all a B-movie. Still, the manner in which
they are framed is low pleasure at its most intoxicating.
Only Heston, as the film's avenging hero, fails to connect. For one thing,
he's about as convincing as a Mexican as Garrison Keillor would be. He
seems to abandon a tentative Mexican accent half way through. He also seems
free of the demons that drive the characters around him. Even when Vargas
realizes that his wife has been kidnapped, his rage simply doesn't have the
same dimension as the dark emotions that run through the rest of the film.
Walter Murch, the man who carried out Welles's wishes from beyond the
grave, is a sound man at heart. And it is the sound innovations, coupled
with the director's dark, contrasty images, that give `Touch of Evil' such
a perverse vibe. In that famous opening shot, Henry Mancini's opening theme
is jettisoned in favor of an impressionistic swirl of street music,
squawking out of cheap tin speakers and swelling and fading as the
characters move through the set.
As any writer can tell you, what happened to Welles during `Touch of Evil'
can hardly be seen as merely a sad irony of history. It happens every day,
in TV and cinema, where writers routinely lose control over their
creations, eventually seeing the germ of their ideas warped and
misrepresented by non-writers with big money at stake. This is not always
the high crime against art that artists would have you believe. Some
auteurs could use some judicious collaboration (Have you seen Joel and
Ethan Coen's `The Big Lebowski'?).
But the larger-than-life Orson Welles gives screenwriters an example to
follow: write everything -- yes, everything -- down and leave it in a
prominent place where someone will find it 20 years after your death when
presumably your genius will finally be recognized. If this catches on, it
may spawn a whole generation of re-interpreters seeing in nearly every
finished movie a better one struggling to break free.</P>
