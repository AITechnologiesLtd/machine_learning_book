Julia (1977)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 78</PRE>
<P>"Julia" is a film about the relationship between two lifelong
friends, and the lengths that one will go to for a valued
friend.  The script is excellent and intelligent, and most of 
the characters are very well defined.</P>
<P>"Julia" takes place in the years leading to World War II.
Lillian Hellman (Jane Fonda) is an aspiring playwriter, 
living with retired novelist Dashiell Hammett (Jason Robards).
Lillian longs to visit childhood friend Julia (Vanessa Redgrave)
who is involved with espionage against the Nazis.  Lillian
is eventually involved in Julia's activities.  Their lives are
endangered.</P>
<P>"Julia" was showed with Academy Award nominations, including
Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Script.
Redgrave and Robards copped supporting actor awards.
Redgrave's is particularly deserved.  Julia's passion
for life and fearless hatred of repression comes through.
There is also an excellent supporting role by
Maximilian Schell, playing one of Julia's contacts
in the resistance.  Also watch for Meryl Streep playing an 
affected socialite.  This was her screen debut.</P>
<P>One thing that bothered me about the film was that two
male supporting characters (played by Hal Holbrook and 
John Glover) are incredible drunken jerks.  Send them
first to a rehab center, then to charm school.</P>
<P>Jane Fonda was given a Best Actress Nomination, but something
seems to be missing in her that is needed for her character.
Lillian's emotional range is limited to nervous and angry.
Julia is almost a maternal figure to her.</P>
<P>Still, "Julia" is a very good movie, well plotted, 
with many moments of genuine suspense (and horror).</P>
