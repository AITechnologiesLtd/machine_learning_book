<PRE>High Art (1998)
Reviewed by Larry McGillicuddy</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (of 4)
Directed by Lisa Cholodenko
Starring Ally Sheedy, Radha Mitchell, Patricia Clarkson</PRE>
<P>When reviewing low budget films, critics often tend to be too 
forgiving. They sometimes forgive obvious technical flaws because 
it's an independent film. Well I don't care what kind of film it is. 
If it has technical flaws, then I can't ignore that. Don't get me 
wrong, I'm not saying a technically proficent film is automatically 
superior to a low budget effort. I wouldn't take the slick, bug 
budget FX laden Armageddon over the atrociously acted poorly filmed 
Clerks mind you. Because Clerks was damn funny and Armageddon was a 
mind numbing bore. But I would never call Clerks a great film, just a 
good one.</P>
<P>Anyways, High Art is a film from first time director Lisa Cholodenko. 
 Radha Mitchell stars as an art magazine editor who runs into 
upstairs neighbor Syd (Ally Sheedy), who is a high profile 
photographer a while back and then suddenly disappeared. The movie is 
about Syd's attempts to break free from her dangerous social life, 
Mitchell's attempts to showcase Syd photography once more, and how 
the two of them fall in love.</P>
<P>High Art has been praised by many critics and it's easy to see why. 
It features two very strong performances from Ally Sheedy and Radha 
Mitchell, and it's an indie film with a distinct personal feel to it. 
It's also at times erotic, heartbreaking, and even ocasionally 
humorous. But the film does have some technical problems and poor 
performances that detract fromt he quality and a fatal flaw in it's 
concluding scenes that prevents me from recommending it.</P>
<P>One of my main problems witht he film was the character of Greta. As 
played by Patricia Clarkson, she is one of the most annoying 
supporting characters in recent memory. Greta is a german actress who 
is Syd's lover. She is the dark side that Syd must break away from. 
Unfortunately, there is very little credibility in their relationship 
to begin with. I assume Clarkson's slurred speech and odd mannerisms 
were intentionally annoying. I still hated them.</P>
<P>Even worse than Clarkson are the numerous random supporting 
characters in the film. While Clarkson was extremely annoying, at 
least she was doing something. The rest of the supporting cast is 
filled with amateurs that would have trouble getting roles in a high 
school production. Most of them don't even have one dimension to 
speak of and they wander around the screen like zombies. Where is Tom 
Savini when you need him?</P>
<P>Then in the conclusion comes the final breaking point for me. There 
is a shot at a crucial emotional moment that instead of focusing on 
Radha Mitchell, which would seem obvious, focuses on one of the 
zombie supporting characters. I simply don't get it. Was Cholodenko 
trying to put us in Radha's shoes in that moment? Not a good time for 
an odd stylistic touch. Were we supposed to understand the pain of 
the random supporting guy  better than we would understand Radha 
Mitchell's? Whatever the reasoning, it's a gaping flaw that 
ultimately kills the film.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong though. This is far from a terrible film. As I 
said, the two lead performances are wonderful. Mitchell displays a 
rare natural presence in front of the camera. I found her performance 
to be quite compelling. Ally Sheedy is quite credible as the drug 
addled, depressed Syd. Her performance isn't quite as compelling, but 
it's still very good. And the two of them develop a strong chemistry 
together. I would've preffered more of them and less of the annoying 
Greta and her band of zombies.</P>
