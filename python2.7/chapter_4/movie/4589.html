<P>     Few will argue that THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN is the silliest of 
all the James Bond motion pictures (CASINO ROYALE excepted).  From the 
return appearance of Sheriff J.W. Pepper (Clifton Davis) to the 
ridiculous martial arts fight where two schoolgirls best dozens (while 
Bond stands by and looks amused), this 007 adventure consistently skirts 
self-parody.  Yet, after the dreariness of LIVE AND LET DIE, the upbeat 
change-of-pace is refreshing.  And, while million-dollar-a-shot hitman 
Scaramanga (Christopher Lee) isn't a typical Bond villain, he's closer 
than anyone from the previous film.  </P>
<P>     This is Roger Moore's second outing as Bond (and the ninth film in 
the series), and, while he still hasn't fully grown into the role (that 
doesn't happen until THE SPY WHO LOVED ME), he's more comfortable here 
than in LIVE AND LET DIE, showing signs of a unique characterization.  
All the regular supporting players are back:  the humorless M (Bernard 
Lee), the crusty Q (Desmond Llewelyn), and the ever-faithful Moneypenny 
(Lois Maxwell, starting to look a little too old to engage in playful 
sex jokes with Bond).</P>
<P>     THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN has two parallel plots that eventually 
dovetail into one.  The main story deals with Bond's attempts to find 
ace hitman Scaramanga before the elusive assassin fires a bullet with 
"007" on it.  Meanwhile, Scaramanga and the British government are both 
in pursuit of a vital component for a solar energy converter.  Hundreds 
of millions of dollars are at stake, since whoever builds this converter 
will have carte blanche where solar power is concerned. (Remember that 
this movie was released in the midst of the '70s energy crisis, when a 
worldwide push for alternative energy methods was underway.)</P>
<P>     Christopher Lee, the consummate bad guy from Hammer's horror films 
(he was always the monster opposite Peter Cushing's protagonist), 
infuses Scaramanga with a sinister demeanor.  In fact, although THE MAN 
WITH THE GOLDEN GUN is overflowing with campiness, Lee never 
participates. Scaramanga is played straight:  an egotistical hermit who 
kills for sport and harbors a secret admiration for 007.</P>
<P>     There are two Bond girls:  Britt Ekland as Mary Goodnight, 007's 
inept assistant, and Maud Adams as Andrea, Scaramanga's mistress.  Herve 
Villechaize ("The plane!  The plane!") is on hand as Nick Nack, right-
hand man to Scaramanga.  Soon Taik Oh is Hip, Bond's local contact (this 
film's Felix Leiter role).  Clifton James makes an encore appearance as 
the buffoon J.W. Pepper, this time vacationing in the Far East.  He 
joins Bond in one of the film's best sequences, a spectacular car chase 
that ends with Scaramanga literally flying away.</P>
<P>     Rarely does THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN take anything seriously.  
Mary Goodnight is as clumsy as they come.  Pepper and Nick Nack are 
cartoonish.  There are more jokes-per-minute than in any other Bond 
film.  Even John Barry's score is less earnest than usual, and the 
opening song is ridiculous.  Regardless, and despite an unnecessarily 
protracted denouement that had me wondering if the film was ever going 
to end, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN is still fun.  It's about as far 
from Ian Fleming's vision of the superspy as the filmed interpretations 
have ever gotten, but for those who expect light, totally-unbelievable 
escapism, this movie does its part.  Yes, it's a weak entry in the 
series, but there's enough good, totally silly stuff here to keep it 
from the absolute bottom.  THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN certainly isn't 
worth $1 million, but it's fine for the price of a video rental.</P>
