48 HRS.
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>Let me introduce you to an average cop movie of 1980s. The
main hero is a rogue macho cop, who never goes by the book
but whose success in taking out bad guys saves him from the
wrath of his superiors, mostly embodied in black captain. At
the beginning, our hero sees his partner/colleague/friend
killed by the main bad guy, so his job becomes personal. His
one-man-show investigation is strenghtened by the presence
of another cop/friend/helper who must win his trust, often
in a series of embarrassing "buddy buddy" incidents. Their
mutual quest almost always gets into dead end, before they
get their act together and manage to take out bad guys in a
final showdown. Overuse of such formula in previous decade
is probably the reason why 48 HRS., action thriller by
Walter Hill, doesn't look as original and refreshing as it
did during its premiere in 1982.</P>
<P>The plot follows the formula noted above. Violent and
dangerous criminal Ganz (James Remar) escapes from the
prison farm with the help of his Indian friend Billy Bear
(Sonny Landham). Their next stop is San Francisco, where
they murder one of their old associates, thus bringing
attention of the police. Detective Jack Cates (Nick Nolte)
takes part in their arrest, but the action ends
disastrously, with two of the cops dead and Cates' own gun
in the hands of brutal murderer. Feeling personally
humiliated, and with the reluctant approval of his bosses,
Cates begins the manhunt on the city streets, but he
desperately needs some inside information about Ganz. Such
help comes in the form of Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy),
black and smooth-talking convict who has some personal
interest in seeing his old buddy Ganz behind bars. But, in
order to assist Cates, Hammond demands to be on the streets.
Cates reluctantly agrees to bring Hammond out of prison for
48 hours; during that time two men must find the criminals,
before they kill each other over black/white and cop/convict
issues.</P>
<P>Although many times re-used by less talented filmmakers
(including Hill himself in disappointing RED HEAT six years
later and with even more disastrous results in the 1990
sequel ANOTHER 48 HRS.), the plot works very well. That is
hardly surprising, since the screenplay was written by
authors like Steven E. De Souza, Roger Spottiswoode or  Jeb
Stuart - many of them would later earn a lot of respect by
providing scripts for popular action movies of the 1980s.
Walter Hill, one of the screenplay co-authors, was still at
the prime of his directorial career and he utilised the
script to the fullest extent. His editing techniques and
perfect sense for the movie pace (ideal combination of
action scenes and "buddy buddy" dynamic) overcome the genre
clich‚s. Even the overused San Francisco scenery works very
well in this film, together with the good music soundtrack
(although the main theme by James Horner would later be
recycled by the composer in some 1980s movies).</P>
<P>However, the most appealing thing about 48 HRS. is one of
its two leads. Eddie Murphy, although second-billed, simply
outshone any other cast members - even such capable actors
with previous Hill experience, like James Remar, David
Patrick Kelly and Brion James. In this movie Murphy clearly
established his on-screen personality of clever,
fast-talking and self-confident urban black that would later
help him to dominate the box-office and even keep afloat
some movies that would otherwise sink. Watching Murphy
deliver such personality - rarely successful combination of
an action hero and comic relief - is a real joy; especially
in the most memorable scene when he, pretending to be a cop,
shakes down an entire racist redneck bar. The scene looks so
natural for Murphy, that the viewer could easily forget that
it was staged. His partner and nominal lead, Nick Nolte, is
so inferior and passive in that scene, and that impression
would remain with him for the rest of the film. So, thanks
to the domineering presence of his emerging lead, 48 HRS.
was bound to be remembered more as an Eddie Murphy vehicle
than good action movie by its merit. Perhaps without Murphy,
this movie would be easy forgotten and all of his flaws and
clich‚s (like completely unnecessary subplot involving
Cates' girlfriend) more easily revealed. But, whether it
owes its quality to Murphy or something else, 48 HRS.
deserves to be praised anyway.</P>
<P>(Special note for "trekkies": Denise Crosby, later known as
Lt. Tasha Yar in STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION could be
seen in 48 HRS. in the role of bat- wielding roommate).</P>
<PRE>RATING: 7/10 (+++)</PRE>
