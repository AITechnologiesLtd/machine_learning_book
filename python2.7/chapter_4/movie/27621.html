<P>PLOT:
A down-and-out girl moves in with some over-the-top models and falls in love
with a goofy-but-loveable guy from across the street. Aaaaaaaaah! Then one
day, she sees him knock a woman upside the head with a baseball bat.
Ooooooooh! She must then join together with her model-friends to find out
whether or not this guy is really goofy-but-loveable, or a psycho killer.
Aaaaaaaaah!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Completely idiotic. Okay, so maybe I'm being a little too nice. This movie
starts off dumb, moves into the ridiculous and eventually graduates to
idiocy. There...that's more like it! And how, you may ask? Well, it's simple
really. Four of the dumbest stereotypical models in the world (oh my God, I
just found out that the actresses playing the parts are models in real
life...yipes!) join Monica Potter (in a role which can only be described as
an obvious cry for help) and Freddie Prinze Jr. (not the actor, but the
character better known as Freddie Prinze Jr.), in a plot so stupid and
far-fetched, that you have to wonder once more, how crap like this gets by
the Hollywood bigwigs. This thing stinks to high-heaven. It's just plain
embarrassing for everyone involved. I even felt my IQ dip below its usual
low as toilet humor somehow worked its way into this so-called
romantic-comedy-action movie? Ugh. What a pile of dung. Hey, I'm actually
starting to sound a little like Harry Knowles here, but I guess I could see
where his frustration comes from time to time. It's sad really. A movie
which actually had quite a few people in my audience laughing at its idiocy,
including the over-used "folks hiding in the bathroom while someone else
comes in to take a crap and fart" gag <insert guffaws here>. And how about
that dumb blonde model who keeps running into things. Pure hilarity! Or
maybe I'm just too jaded, too much of a critic, not relaxed enough to enjoy
this fluff-piece...uuuhhmmm...naaaaah!! This movie sucks the big one.</P>
<P>It's chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting
snuggly into a preposterous plot. This is the kind of movie that has one
character inserting another character into a car headfirst to the floor only
because...well, it's supposed to be funny, see? You see, that person then
has their legs swinging in the other person's face as they drive and that
distracts the driver, see, and well, that's kinda funny, no? Harumph...yeah,
well...you get the picture! Anyhoo, Freddie Prinze Jr....nuff said. Monica
Potter, a bad career move, but we might forgive you if you keep up the Julia
Roberts bit. The rest of the model girls...well, thanks for being there so I
had something to look at, but please apologize to the entire modeling
community as a whole, for making them all out to be complete imbeciles!! So
why the three points out of ten, you may ask? Well, it's simple really. One
point goes to the Russian model girl and that cool accent (don't ask me why,
but it actually turned me on). One point goes out to all of the model girls
for being in the movie (nice window decoration...natch!). And one last point
goes out to the makers of this film, who spared us any long sorted story,
and made sure to give us the opportunity of leaving the theatre after only
90 minutes of manufactured garbage, so that we could run out as fast as we
can, grab the next person that we see walking down the street and warn them
of the devil that is...Freddie Prinze Jr...I mean, HEAD OVER HEELS. You've
been warned, good people.</P>
<P>PS: Didja notice how I didn't even mention REAR WINDOW once in my entire
review? I didn't want to taint the memory of the classic flick by having it
uttered alongside this thing, but then again, I just did mention it, but I
guess it doesn't count in the PS section...or does it? Ooooh, whatever...I
have a headache! (I think my brain is coming back to life)</P>
