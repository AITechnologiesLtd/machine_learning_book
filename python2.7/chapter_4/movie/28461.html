<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A fair remake of the 1930 and 1920 versions of this film. This is a
pleasant action adventure story about a convicted murderer who escapes
to prove that he was framed. He assumes the identity of the Mountie who
pursues him. It is set in the rugged wilderness of Alberta, Canada.</P>
<P>It's 14 months after John Keith (Dennis Morgan) escaped from the court
house after being sentenced to hang for the murder of Roger Cass.
Sergeant Conniston (Morgan) has been asked by Inspector McDowell
(Stephenson) to track the fugitive down and he finally locates him in
the remote wilderness of Canada, but the severe winter weather takes its
toll on him and he's dying. Keith tries to nurse him back to health and
when the two get to talking, Conniston is convinced that Keith is no
murderer. Since the two men look almost alike, Keith takes on the
identity of Conniston upon his death just when Constable Jeffers and
Kentish arrive.</P>
<P>Back in town Keith is accepted as being Conniston. He immediately
contacts his best friend
Andy Dijon (Tobias) and they plan to find the real murderer. They
believe he is Norman Talbot (Jory), who was partners with Cass in a gold
mining business. Keith got framed for the murder when he came to collect
the money Cass owed him and found him already dead. Talbot lied on the
witness stand saying that Keith threatened him, and he was convicted on
just that testimony. Keith believes the cause of the murder was because
the partners had a falling out over money.</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoiler to follow.</PRE>
<P>Hearing that her brother is safe, Linda returns to stay with him and
because she hasn't seen him for 6 years fails to notice that he is not
her brother. She is one dull-witted chick! To make matters worst, the
attractive girl whom Keith is smitten with falls for Talbot and plans to
marry him. That's too much for Keith and he tells her that he's not her
brother and that Talbot is a murderer. But she runs to Inspector
McDowell and he arrests Keith. But his sidekick Andy comes through and
beats a confession out of Frank Crandall, who provided the false alibi
that Talbot was in the barber shop at the time of the murder. He also
implicates Balt as being an accomplice of Talbot. McDowell thereby
releases Keith, who tracks down Talbot as he is running away by buggy to
marry Linda. In a fist fight in the moving buggy, Keith overcomes the
criminal and brings him to justice.</P>
<PRE>A very conventional film.</PRE>
