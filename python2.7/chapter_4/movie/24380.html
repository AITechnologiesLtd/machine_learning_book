Turco, Megan Dods, Gabriel Olds, Samuel Ball</P>
<P>  The thirty-seven year old Dan Futterman, who is known
principally to audiences that favor indie films like "Shooting
Fish," has the look and smirk of a young Ben Gazzara.  He
appears in every scene of Jon Shear's adaptation of Daniel
Reitz's play "Urban Folk Tales," a surreal, nihilistic journey
into the netherworld of Manhattan's dark streets.  Mixing
flashbacks with intentionally comic and quick scenes from
urban legends (such as the woman who microwaves her
poodle to prevent its catching a cold and the man who wakes
up in an ice-cold bath minus a kidney), "Urbania" is the story
of a traumatic incident in a young man's life and the
redemption he ultimately gains.  Shane Kelly's Super 16 film
gives this mysterious, sometimes opaque but always
challenging tale the obligatory grainy look of a noir yarn while
Marc Anthony Thompson's editing flashes back and forth
from reality to imagination furiously, adding to the intensity of
the central character's passion.  </P>
<P>   As Charlie (Dan Futterman) walks the streets of downtown
Manhattan we recall Robert De Niro's perambulations through
the hazy metropolitan byways, steam pouring from the
sewers.  Charlie's world is hopefully unlike any we have
seen.  The man is filled with a simmering rage resulting from
an incident about which we gain a brief hint early on, as he
recalls the pleas of a bloodied dying person, the victim of a
homophobic beating.  Though Shear keeps us wondering how
the pieces fit, we soon discover that Charlie's companion
Chris (Matt Keeslar) is the unhappy victim of a hate crime
and that Charlie is intent on restoring his peace of mind while
at the same time he combs the area looking for distractions.</P>
<P>   As he wanders about the town, through hidden tunnels and
a neighborhood bar like a landlubbing ancient mariner, he
runs into a number of people, each with a story to tell.  Some
are old friends, such as Brett (Alan Cumming), a friend
whose sensuous eyes reveal the ardor he feels for the young
man, while a far different sort is a stuttering homeless man,
Bill, (Lothaire Bluteau), whom Charlie treats compassionately
as though he were chatting with a pet.  </P>
<P>   After allowing us to eavesdrop into a host of stories by
diverse people including a friendly bartender, a ditzy blonde
who has established a relationship with a man Charlie knows,
Shear gets down to business in the final segment as the film
turns raw and pungent.  Charlie ultimately meets and toys
with the man whom he believes responsible for his torment
and, after meting out justice has a final reunion with the
object of his passion.</P>
<P>   "Urbania," which was featured at Sundance and later at the
GenArts festival, demands our attention in every scene,
forcing us to suspend not so much our disbelief but our urge
for immediate gratification.  Shear takes his time in putting
the segments of Charlie's trauma together but once done, we
witness the appropriate cathartic touch.  Our patience is
rewarded as we are convinced that this likeable fellow is able
to get wholly in touch with his remorse and to take action to
rehabilitate himself and shuck off the anxiety that wears him
down.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 107 minutes.  (C) 2000
