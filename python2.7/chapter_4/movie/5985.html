<PRE>                               FLY AWAY HOME
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Anna Paquin's first starring role after stealing an Oscar for THE
PIANO is the harmless family movie FLY AWAY HOME.  Following in the
footsteps of countless family movies before it, FLY AWAY HOME tries too
hard to appeal to both children and their parents and ultimately loses
much of its appeal to everybody.</P>
<P>     In case you missed the movie's trailer, which provides a nice plot
synopsis, FLY AWAY HOME is about a teenage girl (Paquin) from New
Zealand who moves in with her Canadian father (Jeff Daniels) after her
mother dies.  The young girl is utterly bored and lonely until she finds
a family of young goose eggs (eventually geese) to take care of.  After
she becomes the geese's mother, she finds happiness, and the whole
family bands together to figure out how to take care of the geese.  This
ultimately leads to the decision to have young Anna fly the geese down
south for the winter.</P>
<P>     The first problem with this film comes in trying to understand why
Anna's mother packed her up and moved to New Zealand of all places.  The
answer is of course that the studio execs wanted Anna in this picture,
and everyone knows Anna Paquin is from New Zealand.  Hence, the rewrite.</P>
<P>     The second problem comes with trying to understand how important
the death of Anna's mother actually is.  Presumably since the filmmakers
show us the whole car crash in the first scene, the mother's death is
important, but after this scene she is not really discussed again for
the next hour.  Because of this, Anna's moping and whining for the first
half of the film seems to have little motivation and Anna's character
comes off as basically obnoxious.  This is just about the kiss of death
for a family movie, when the child star begins to become unlikable.</P>
<P>     The rest of the characters, however, fit very well into the
stereotypes they are trying to fill (and because they do, they help
Anna's character fit into hers):  Jeff Daniels plays the caring father
trying to get through to his depressed child, Dana Delany is the
terribly nice father's girlfriend who has an even harder time trying to
make friends with Anna, and supporting characters fill out the various
other good guy and bad guy roles.  The character arches also fit nicely
into the stereotypical family movie fare.  Those being that as the story
goes on, the bad guys get worse, forcing Anna to turn to the good guys
for help, where she finds it.  Of course, the story's development is not
quite this simple, but it might as well be.</P>
<P>     As I mentioned at the outset, FLY AWAY HOME is a family movie. 
This being the case, the filmmakers have thrown in plenty of cute things
(baby geese) and silly things (Anna making funny faces) to keep the kids
occupied.  What hurts it though is that they have also tried to build
rounded characters and a complex plot.  In trying so hard to do both
however, they have accomplished neither.  The film jumps continuously
from cute scene to mature scene resulting in 1) an emotional film that
never quite lives up to its potential and 2) a lot of distracted
children.  FLY AWAY HOME is an on-and-off movie founded on the
philosophy that it is better to please all of the people some of the
time, which doesn't really work with children.</P>
