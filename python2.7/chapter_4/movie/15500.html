<P>It is refreshing to see a film made from a slightly different perspective
from what is usually seen in its given genre. It may not be completely
different, but it stands out amongst similar efforts. "Elizabeth" is such a
film. It takes the art house, period costume piece and skews a dark edge to
it. This is not a revolutionary feat by any means, but it is a unique vision
that sets it apart from many historical dramas of recent memory. This dark
look, in coercion with a gripping story and bold performances, makes
"Elizabeth" one of the more enthralling cinematic ventures of the year.</P>
<P>Set in mid-1500s England, "Elizabeth" is the dramatization of Queen
Elizabeth I's rise to power and the daunting opposition she faced once
having ascended to the throne. It is a cloak-and-dagger tale where loyalties
are always in question; one that climaxes to a conclusion that could be
classified as Britain's version of "The Godfather". Director Shekhar Kapur
has assembled an impressive piece of cinema here with his keen artistic eye
and restrained, suspenseful character exposition.</P>
<P>The story of "Elizabeth" is essentially a power struggle with a ribald
streak. In spite of threatening enemies, Queen Elizabeth chooses to rule and
abide by Protestant teachings as opposed to the Catholic reign that preceded
her. As a result, a potential Holy War looms over England as influential
members of the Catholic Church join forces with coup-minded Royal advisors
in an attempt to overthrow Queen Elizabeth, whom they see as heretical and
blasphemous.</P>
<P>Coupled with this, there are foreign countries that look to capitalize on
what they see as weakness in England, creating a truly daunting wall of
opposition that surrounds Elizabeth on all sides. It is a tricky endeavor as
people tend to say one thing while meaning another, with every conversation
depending not on truth but rather the company of people assembled. With the
exception of a few individuals, director Kapur keeps the motives of his
characters veiled and uncertain. From this uncertainty rises gripping
suspense and surprising revelations that keep the viewer glued in
anticipation.</P>
<P>The cast is first-rate, displaying some of the year's best performances.
Leading the way as Queen Elizabeth I is Cate Blanchett ("Oscar & Lucinda",
"Paradise Road"). Blanchett commands the screen with power and nobility. It
is a multi-layered performance as Blanchett allows us to see Elizabeth's
weaknesses and fears; but while in the company of both loyal subjects and
threatening foes, she only reveals an intimidating resolve and
uncompromising strength. Blanchett excels in every regard. Expect to see her
name on next spring's Oscar ballot.</P>
<P>Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush ("Shine") is the other standout with his turn as
the mysteriously sinister Sir Francis Walsingham. A security advisor
assigned to protect the Queen, Walsingham is the story's greatest enigma.
Rush's subtle portrayal is chilling and ominous.  From one scene to the
next, we never really know where his loyalties lay. Are they with the Queen?
Her enemies? Or just himself?  Walsingham's actions eventually tell the
tale, but the fact that we don't have a clue prior to those actions is a
testament to Rush's performance and Kapur's direction. Walsingham is the
polar opposite of Rush's frenetic portrayal of trouble pianist David
Helfgott in "Shine", making his Oscar win for that performance seem all the
more worthy.</P>
<P>Joseph Fiennes is impressive in his American debut. Over-shadowed in the
past by his more famous brother Ralph Fiennes ("Schindler's List", "The
English Patient"), Joseph puts himself on the cinematic map with his
portrayal of Lord Robert Dudley, the charming Earl of Leicester who has won
the heart of Elizabeth. Like his brother Ralph, Joseph has a strong screen
presence as he exudes romantic passion and quiet strength through Lord
Robert. These walls eventually give way to vulnerability, allowing Fiennes
to showcase his range in this complex role.</P>
<P>Acclaimed director Sir Richard Attenborough ("Gandhi", "Shadowlands")
moonlights as an actor once again (with previous roles including the
"Jurassic Park" films) with his portrayal of Elizabeth's most trusted
confidante Sir William Cecil. His is the only character whose moral
uprightness is apparent throughout. Attenborough's Cecil is a noble servant
who humbly submits all that he is to the Queen and her Kingdom. Christopher
Eccleston's Duke of Norfolk is a rare cinematic villain in that he actually
acts from personal conviction, not caricaturized hatred or anger. He is
intense without being over-the-top as he allows his passion to rise from his
beliefs, not mere prejudices. Eccleston's performance adds a level of depth
to the story that could have been so easily missed.</P>
<P>"Elizabeth" is a sumptuous visual spectacle. The costumes designed by
Alexandra Byrne (Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet") are arguably the best seen all
year. Rich in color and astounding in detail, Byrne's elegant costumes are
truly impressive creations. John Myhre's ("Immortal Beloved") production
design is a medieval gothic realm. High arches of cold gray stone embody the
castles seen here, also replete with strong pillars and ornate decoration.
All of this is captured quite well in Remi Adefarasin's ominous photography.
With sweeping overhead shots and candid close-ups, the camera work by
Adefarasin (assistant DP on "The English Patient") creates moods of
oppressive power and mysterious darkness. The combination of these talents
result in the most visually breathtaking period film since 1995's
"Restoration".</P>
<P>Composer David Hirschfelder ("Shine", "Sliding Doors") provides a music
score that is powerful and haunting. With full classical orchestrations and
spiritually dark choral voices, Hirschfelder's bold compositions are as much
of a force as the film's passionate performances and arresting imagery.</P>
<P>Michael Hirst's screenplay is an excellent mix of historical overview and
dramatic complexity. As alluded to in earlier segments of this review, Hirst
's screenplay never shows its full hand until the very end. This poker face
storytelling always keeps us guessing.  People's loyalties and motives
seemingly change from one scene to the next without their actions ever
appearing disjointed or out of character. One scene we may think a person is
good, then we're not so sure the next (with the converse also being true).
This mysterious complexity of characters makes up for the few lulls within
the story itself.</P>
<P>Shekhar Kapur has shot and assembled this story to near perfection. Most
directors forecast a characters motives right off the bat, holding on
lengthy close-ups so that we can "tell" if a person is bad or not. Kapur
doesn't stoop to this amateurish level, therefore we cannot label most of
the characters as "good" or "bad" until the film's final quarter.  But even
so, Kapur shows wisdom with his inclusion of the ethically sound Sir William
Cecil. In doing so Kapur doesn't leave us completely adrift, giving the
story a moral center as well as someone solid and trustworthy for us (the
audience) to look to.</P>
<P>"Elizabeth" is an epic film that showcases one of the most courageous
heroines to be seen on film in many years. It is a stirring account that is
sure to engross those far beyond its core audience. To flippantly
characterize this as "middle-aged Girl Power" would be to sorely
misrepresent this film and the moral challenges that Queen Elizabeth faces.
With depth, ambiguity, visual spectacle and sheer emotional power,
"Elizabeth" is one of 1998's most captivating experiences.</P>
