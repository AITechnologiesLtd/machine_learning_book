<P>---Those of you in the Portland, Maine area can hear Mac VerStandig's 
movie reviews every Friday on the 98.9 The Point morning show---</P>
<P>It comes as little surprise that Woody Allen, one of great filmmakers of 
the our time, has created another gem in Sweet and Lowdown. It ain't 
Manhattan or Annie Hall, but it is at the top of 1999's  class, a strong 
statement about the filmmaker's talent.   </P>
<P>Allen has previously ventured into risquE9 territory when he had =
characters break role in Annie Hall and made Celebrity, a 1998 film, in 
black and white. Here he has created a mockumentary that is infinitely 
more realistic than The Blair Witch Project and might even create some 
consequent believers.</P>
<P>The film opens with Woody Allen being interviewed about a jazz guitarist 
named Emmet Ray who briefly flourished in the 1930's but is mainly 
remembered only by aficionados. Soon Allen and other interviewee's 
stories are acted out in segments by a typically recognizable Woody 
Allen cast including Sean Penn, John Waters and Uma Thurman. These bits 
are intertwined with continued interviews.  </P>
<P>The assumption made is that this guitarist, Emmet Ray, was a major 
insider influence and Allen has decided to make a movie paying tribute 
to him. Ray was an oddball who got kicks out of watching trains, 
shooting rats and performing drunk. But he was the finest guitarist in 
the world and he knew it. . . "except for this gypsy guitar player in 
France," as he always had to insert. The gypsy in question was Django 
Reinhardt and Emmet twice fainted in his presence. The film follows 
Emmet through a couple of women, including one mute girl, and his 
experiences as a musician, hustler and part time pimp.</P>
<P>There is absolutely no reason that any of the things in Sweet and 
Lowdown couldn't have happened. But they didn't. Emmet Ray is work of 
pure fiction, although there was, undisputedly, a major jazz scene in 
the 1930's and a great guitarist named Django Reinhardt. Allen follows 
through with this fantasy to the point of even having the experts being 
interviewed disagree on certain issues. There is little doubt that at 
least one moviegoer will embarrass him or herself in the near future by 
requesting an Emmet Ray album in Sam Goody.</P>
<P>Emmet's personality is well expressed even beyond dead rats and speeding 
trains. He is also a kleptomaniac, something that probably serves to 
feed his monster sized ego. He won't allow himself to ever fall in love, 
but doesn't mind having girls live with him. Yet the guitarist also 
manages to justify all his wrongs in his own sick and twisted head. His 
extremely undesirable traits makes the supposed documentary all the more 
insightful.</P>
<P>Woody Allen's films, more often than not, mirror himself. In many ways, 
Emmet Ray is just an exaggerated reflection of the brilliant filmmaker. 
He has odd female companions in the aforementioned mute girl and other 
cartoon-like companions, works a small but appreciative music scene and 
is one of the best at his trait. Allen certainly has an abnormal female 
life that has come to light recently, continues to make independent 
films for an appreciative art-house crowd and is, indisputably, one of 
the greatest at what he does.</P>
