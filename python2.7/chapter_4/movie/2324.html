<PRE>                               GRUMPY OLD MEN
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is a trite and formulaic comedy
     for people who think it is funny to see old men acting like
     naughty children.  Good actors cannot save this thin script
     with shallow characters facing straw crises.   Better films
     than this are being made for TV.  Rating 0 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     The town of Wabasha, Minnesota, has seen for years the battle of two
now crotchety next-door neighbors, friends from youth and at the same time
enemies since not long after.  John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau)
seem to live to play nasty jokes on each other.  In their 70s, there now is
little in either's lives but watching television, ice fishing, and
tormenting the other.  Then a likable, sexy kook moves in across the street.
Now the two old men have a new activity, stairing out the window at Ariel
(Ann-Margaret).  And they have a new conquest to be rivals for.  Ariel is
someone who lives life rather than retreating from it the way John and Max
do.  Ariel is like a mystical force in Max and John's lives.  Her presence
in Wabasha is never very well explained, nor is what she lives on, nor even
her interest in Max and John.  But her presence will transform them.</P>
<P>     Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are almost a classic comedy team after
THE ODD COUPLE, THE FORTUNE COOKIE, and THE FRONT PAGE.  But director Donald
Petrie seems at a loss as to how to tap into that comic potential.  The
fault is not his and is certainly not his actors' but that of a poorly
written screenplay by Mark Steven Johnson.  At its best, the screenplay
makes palatable some trite points about living life and taking risks.  But
the film indulges itself too much in showing old men cussing and using
sexually explicit language as if that was in itself supposed to be
hilarious.  Actually we get to see that Lemmon and Matthau really do have a
chemistry together still as we see them joking with each other in the
outtakes run under the final credits.  But when the cameras were rolling for
real and they had to follow Johnson's script, somehow all the chemistry
evaporates.  Petrie did much better with MYSTIC PIZZA a much more keenly
observed regional comedy.</P>
<P>     GRUMPY OLD MEN is over-powered with a very good cast who just are not
needed in the parts they have gotten.  At 52 Ann-Margaret is starting to
lose her figure but little of her appeal.  And in addition somewhere along
the way she has learned to act to the point I would almost classify her as
under-appreciated.  Burgess Meredith is incredibly wasted as a foul-mouthed
nonagenarian.  Daryl Hannah and Ossie Davis are around in smaller parts than
they deserve and ones they should have let go to less familiar actors.</P>
<P>     GRUMPY OLD MEN is a very fluffy film people who think it is funny to
see old men fighting like children and repeatedly calling each other "putz"
and "moron."  If you list ten crises that old men might face, two of them
will probably be in this film.  This one has a moment or two, but the rest
fails to click.  I give it a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
