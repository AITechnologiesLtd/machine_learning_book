<PRE>The Chamber (1996)
* * * 1/2
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Starts off as a legal thriller, but mutates into something much
closer to the heart -- and features Gene Hackman in a typically excellent
performance.</P>
<P>Some movies lead you wrong, and that's a good thing. THE CHAMBER, adapted
from the John Grishamn novel, starts off as a typical
legal-thriller-with-a-twist, but then slowly turns into a different sort of
story, about one man trying to find the truth about the past and another man
trying to find the truth about himself.</P>
<P>The two men are Adam Hall, a young Chicago laywer, and his grandfather, Sam
Cayhall. Cayhall is a product of the worst breeds of Southern racism, in
whose fold he built and detonated several bombs. "I never meant to kill
anyone," he repeats angrily, but bombs are generally not designed to do much
else, and three trials and countless appeals later, he is now on death row.
Hall, his grandson, has decided to take on the eleventh-hour defense.</P>
<P>Hall and Cayhill do not like each other. Cayhill has no use for lawyers --
most of the reasons, it seems at first, are blatantly racist, and don't bear
repeating here (even though they are delivered with consummate skill by
Hackman). Hall doesn't like the bitter old man, but he smells a great deal
is being held away from a lot of people's noses here, and digs. He finds a
lot.</P>
<P>As the movie unwound, I felt it could have gone one of two ways: either it
could have developed the plot to the point where the human story became more
irrelevant and therefore could be resolved with a mechanical flourish (the
way the dreadful A TIME TO KILL ended up), or it could pay closer attention
to the people in the story. It takes the second road, and is all the better
for it. And be warned: as a result, we don't get a nice, tidy conclusion --
a lot of threads are left dangling, probably deliberately, since the real
conclusion of the movie is in the way Hackman's character handles his
oncoming fate. Eventually we see that his racism is not so much a philosophy
as a way of warding off terrible grief and hurt, and self-hatred (as is the
case with most virulently racist people, they compensate violently for not
having what they feel should be simply given to them gratis).</P>
<P>Hall (played by Chris O'Donnell with maturity and grace) also has a
transformation of his own, but a smaller one: sometimes it's not possible to
use the law as a way to repair what has gone wrong, just to comment on it.
He resents his grandfather for using the same tired excuses, but at the same
time batters patiently at the man's defenses, knowing that it's only a
matter of time before the imminence of the clock will get him to say
something true to his heart. He does.</P>
<PRE>A lot of people have criticized THE CHAMBER as being unfocused, but I think
the focus is deceptive. It's not really about its plot; it's about the way
the people tangled up in it deal with it -- or do not deal with it, as the
case may be. On that level, it's a very different movie, and a better one,
than we might have been initially led to <A HREF="mailto:believe.<HR>syegul@ix.netcom.com">believe.<HR>syegul@ix.netcom.com</A>                                       EFNet IRC: GinRei
