<PRE>                             PETER'S FRIENDS
                       A film review by Andrew Hall
                        Copyright 1993 Andrew Hall</PRE>
<P>     After someone dies, a group of old college friends reunites after
many years to deal with the problems of their adult lives.</P>
<PRE>     What's that?  Has THE BIG CHILL just been rereleased?</PRE>
<P>     No, but Kenneth Branagh's new film PETER'S FRIENDS is sort of a
British BIG CHILL.  Branagh (DEAD AGAIN, HENRY V) also stars, along with
Emma Thompson, Rita Rudner, and Stephen Fry.</P>
<P>     After the death of Peter's (Fry) father, the friends reunite at his
father's mansion in rural England to spend New Years together.
Promiscuous Sarah arrives with her latest love, Brian, who happens to
have a wife and child.  Neurotic Maggie (Thompson), an author and reader
of self-help books, has a secret crush on one of the friends.  Andrew
(Branagh), a writer who has left England for Hollywood, finds that his
American television star wife Carol (Rudner) is driving him nuts.  Roger
and Maggie, a husband-and-wife jingle-writing team, find their marriage
endangered after the loss of their son.</P>
<P>     Coming to Peter's house seems to allow everyone a chance to come to
terms with life, in one way or another.  Everyone, it seems, has a major
crisis or a resolution of one except Peter, who appears mysteriously
immune to such problems.  But Peter drops his own sobering bombshell on
his friends at the end of the film.</P>
<P>     The characters in PETER'S FRIENDS are wonderful; we get to know
them quickly.  Many of the scattered laughs in the film come from
laughing at the characters.  I liked the women best of all.   Rudner, a
wonderful stand-up comedienne who also co-wrote the script, is
delightful here as the vain appearance freak.  Thopmson is also
endearing as the hopeless neurotic who, with Rudner's help, suddenly
blooms.</P>
<P>     My biggest complaint with PETER'S FRIENDS was the ending, which
comes too soon after Peter's revelation.  I felt as though I were
waiting for something else to happen.</P>
<P>     This is a good film, especially if you like films with real
characters.  Perhaps the British element will put a few people off.  But
I hope PETER'S FRIENDS gets distributed more widely than it has been in
Phoenix (only one theater).  It is certainly better than many of the
comedies coming out of Hollywood these days.</P>
<P>     Though PETER'S FRIENDS is not laugh-a-minute - there are periods of
intense drama between the laughs - I recommend seeing it.</P>
