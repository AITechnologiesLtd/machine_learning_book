<P>"I'm going to do something really outrageous. I am going to tell the 
truth." So proclaims John Travolta in his last film, Primary Colors. 
Kind of ironic that he went from that role, to playing a lawyer in his 
new film, A Civil Action, don't you think? Oh, but worry not Travolta 
fans because he gives what is his second Oscar caliber performance of 
the year in this remarkable film. And his acting, no matter how great, 
is little more than one of the many achievements in this exceptional 
film that is based on a true story.</P>
<P>Jan Schlichtmann (John Travolta) is the type of personal injury lawyer 
that makes you disgusted with the American legal system. He is as much 
an ambulance chaser as the next lawyer, and doesn't seem to have, well, 
morals. His theories are real simple: a dead child is worth very little, 
a dead woman or minority is worth very little, but a dead middle aged 
man is what he thrives off. And thrives he does, he wears a custom made 
suit, drives a Porsche, and seems to be at the peak of his legal career. 
And then he stumbles onto the lawsuit that could make him millions and 
earn him immortality. A company that makes billions of dollars every 
year, and seems to have all the money in the world, has been polluting 
the water supply in Woburn, Mass. This had lead to the pre-mature deaths 
of numerous children, and their families are looking for an apology.</P>
<P>To Schlichtmann an apology is a very simple thing: money. He sees a gold 
mine and seizes the opportunity, despite his long-standing belief that 
children don't equal money. Working with him in his firm are Kevin 
Conway (Tony Shalhoub) and James Gordon (William H. Macy). The 
opposition consists of 2 very different lawyers. On one side there is 
William Cheeseman (Bruce Norris) who seems to be the inexperienced, over 
excited, and incompetent one in the mix. Then there is the wise, 
educated, relaxed and overall brilliant Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall) 
who is as much a Red Sox fan as anyone else in Boston. It will be these 
2 men vs. Schlichtmann and company in what will be the case of their 
careers.</P>
<P>The brilliance to this plot is that it is real. (WARNING: PLOT GIVEAWAY) 
And, as in real life, the story doesn't have a happy ending. It is a 
tragic courtroom film, which is something that is very rare for 
Hollywood. It is also one of the few courtroom films that does not 
involve a female love interest, another rarity. And, because of that, 
this movie really does shine.</P>
<P>The acting is nothing less than brilliant. John Travolta gives the 
second great performance of his career (Primary Colors, where he also 
had the task of portraying a real person) and has finally given reason 
for people to stop asking about his capability. And Robert Duvall gives 
what is just another spectacular job from an actor who is among the 
greatest. But the real treat is William H. Macy who seems to be giving 
role after role of great acting. He gives this movie a whole different 
angle through a unique blend of comedy and drama that only he is capable 
of. You will also find a very good job by John Lithgow as Judge Skinner, 
and a wonderfully charming cameo by Kathy Bates at the end of this 2 
hour film.</P>
<P>When all is said and done, you walk out of a spectacular film that stuns 
you as much as it entertains. Through great acting, a spectacularly true 
story, and an overall willingness to dare, A Civil Action is a great 
achievement. May it be marked as one of the few films of 1998 that was 
truly great.</P>
