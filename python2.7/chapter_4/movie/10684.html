<P>Ang Lee, (b. 1954) studied theater in his native Taiwan, came to the U.S.
in 1978 where he continued his theater studies at the University of
Illinois (Urbana), before going on to the Film Department at New York
University. During a recent Lee retrospective and visit at the University
of Illinois, some of his former teachers remembered both Lee's eagerness
and his then-opaque English. In one play production which Lee was anxious
to be in, the linguistic problem was solved by the Solomonic decision to
cast him as a spear carrier, a non-speaking role.</P>
<P>Five years after his arrival to the U.S. Lee was already directing
pictures. At first shorter ones: "Dim Lake" (Best Taiwanese Film Award),
"Fine Line" (NYU Festival, Best film and director).Then came three features
that Lee also scripted: "Pushing Hands" (Best film, Asian Film Festival);
"The Wedding Banquet" (US-Taiwan) (Golden Bear in Berlin, many other
awards); and the Oscar-nominated "Eat Drink Man Woman,"(Taiwan).</P>
<P>In a radical shift, Lee filmed with huge success the very British novel by
Jane Austen "Sense and Sensibility" which had seven Oscar nominations and a
win for the scenario by its star Emma Thompson. This confounded the notion
of directors being unable (or at least uncomfortable) with subjects on
"alien" cultures. But then people forget that hordes of very American
movies were made in Hollywood by Europeans who spoke with thick foreign
accents. Think (among many) of Ernst Lubitsch. Or of Billy Wilder whose
scripts are full of U.S. vernacular, including the linguistically-oriented
comedy "Ball of Fire."</P>
<P>There should be no surprise that Lee adds to his repertory as entirely
American-with-a-vengeance feature as "The Ice Storm." Or that the film
continues Lee's brilliant career.</P>
<P>"The Ice Storm" is set just before, during and after Thanksgiving (an
ironic choice) in 1973 (a year of transitions) in New Canaan, Connecticut,
among the affluent WASP bourgeoisie. It concentrates on two families of
friends and neighbors. Ben and Elena Hood, their children Wendy, 14 and
Paul, 16; Janey and Jim Carver, their boys Mikey and Sandy.</P>
<P>The early 1970s are the inheritors and often the extension of the 1960s
upheavals, sexual and political revolutions, hippie-ism, pot and drugs. But
the film's characters are not all alike in conforming to non-conformism.
The kids are of that in-between adolescent  age that in all decades has
known rebellion, confusion and sexual exploration. The most notable is
Wendy who tries to experiment  with both Carver brothers. She also has a
political conscience, which seems to lack in others. 1973 is a year of
national problems and of political corruption underlined by a defensive
Richard Nixon who is much in evidence on TV as he alternates with weather
reports.</P>
<P>If the young ones acts like adolescents, so do the children's parents and
other grown-ups. They are the embodiment of the 60's slogan "Never trust
people over 30," having settled for a materially "good life," have no
interest in ideals, politics or causes. But they have retained the sexual
sea-changes of the earlier years. Ben is having a "just sex" affair with
Janey, whose husband is often on business trips. Other "adults," must have
also opted for coveting their neighbor's wives (or husbands). While this is
not shown at first, it becomes explicit when, after Thanksgiving Day, a
dozen or more couples attend a "key party." For the uninitiated, that's
when the male guests throw their car keys in a bowl. At evening's end,
after some people leave, each woman fishes out a key and goes home with it
owner.  (Sign of the times: a hip, long-haired new clergyman leaves the
party early but with strong hints that he has his eye on Elena).</P>
<P>The night of the party is also that of the worst ice storm in memory.
Things happen, including a tragedy that sobers up many in several ways. The
storm is beautifully photographed (with artificial ice), and exceptionally
good too is the period reconstruction of sights and sounds, artifacts,
clothing, paraphernalia.</P>
<P>The film's tone is one of ice-cold observation of people and mores, with
several touches of humor and irony that illustrate how dysfunctional both
generations are. Without heavy underlining
how the uneasy relationships of adults and their essential egotism affect
the children, there is a lack of rapport that is pin-pointed by details and
by indirect symbolism. Ben has what he thinks is a heart-to-heart talk with
his son but is in reality ludicrous. Wendy coolly shoplifts candy in a
drugstore, and separately, her rich but disoriented  mother lifts lipsticks
there. In play, young Sandy, without understanding the causes, blows up toy
airplanes and whips a flowering bush.</P>
<P>The problem with the young people is the older people , at least in part.
The problem with the older people is that they are hollow men. The adults
may be salacious, but are unfeeling.  In "Something of Value," the Robert
Ruark novel set in troubled Kenya and in the 1957 film, the epigraph says,
more or less, "If a  people lose their gods, they must replace them with
something of value."</P>
<P>In Ang Lee's previous films about Taiwanese, old values and new values
coexisted or else some new ones replaced older ones. But among the "The Ice
Storm"'s characters there are no visible values of any sort. The people are
hollow men, dead souls, running on empty. Yet the movie does not look at
them in a reprimanding way but rather with a cool kind of pity. This makes
for an absence (I am not saying "a lack"--there's a difference) of the
dramatic tension that we have been conditioned to take for granted. It's no
defect. Nor is the fact that the adults are shown as unidimensional
stereotypes, since that's what they really are. And what they are is seen
with a sharp eye for descriptions within a rapid succession of episodes.
Many episodes.</P>
<P>The actual ice storm is a fine metaphor for the essential coldness of the
grownups and their actions, transparent and brittle like ice, ice that
breaks relationships as it breaks trees.  The tragedy that concludes the
movie is a bit too neat as divine punishment or nature's retribution, but
at least the film has the good sense not to wrap up with simple sadness
rather than fake, sentimental cliches of people forever changed for the
better.</P>
<P>I have seen "The Ice Storm" twice, at Cannes and here, just the other day.
Abroad, I worried about the viewers thinking that Yanks have it all over
the French in the casual sex department. In real life the Gallic attitude
is far more tolerant than in the States. The reaction to carnal sins by
politicians and celebrities elicits shrugging shoulders and no headlines.
As for French cinema, physical relations go more often than not with grand
passions. In the U.S. I worried lest the movie be taken as a wholesale
indictment of the 70s rather than what it is, a view of a given segment of
the population.</P>
<P>Both times I suspected that "Ice" is overloaded with sign-post scenes to
reinforce its themes of dysfunctionality, with too much cross-cutting
between the young and the older.  Another small  quibble is that for those
who stay (that is, almost no one) for the end credits, the overall very
good music concludes with a mood-cutting vocal.</P>
<P>In a film with unusually sparse dialogue, the acting bears a heavy burden.
It is superior, especially Kevin Kline's, Wendy Hood's, the other
youngsters' and Sigourney Weaver's. Ms Weaver, with less screen-time than I
wished for, looks gorgeous as an icy spider-lady and has the  movie's best
line. In bed with her, Kline post-coitally rambles on about being forced
for business reasons to play hated golf, and about a rival colleague taking
lessons. Sigourney turns to him coldly : " Ben, you are boring me. I have a
husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another."</P>
