<PRE>JURASSIC PARK III
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2001 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>        I lost track of how many times someone yells "Run!" in "Jurassic Park III."</PRE>
<P>        As Dr. Ian Malcolm so succinctly put it in "The Lost World: Jurassic Park"
(the second go-round of the trilogy-to-date ... and there's absolutely no
reason why they should call it quits with this one), "Oooh!  Ahhh!  That's
how it always starts.  Then later there's running and screaming."</P>
<P>        There's a lot of running and screaming in "Jurassic Park III."  What there
isn't is the afore-referenced Dr. Malcolm (a sorely-missed Jeff Goldblum,
who perked up the first two installments no end with his Chaos theorizing,
cool attire, and utterly sarcastic humor) and the sure hand of Steven
Spielberg who, perhaps wisely, has abdicated directorial duties to
"Jumanji" man Joe Johnston.</P>
<P>        For the third time running (and running, and screaming) the dinosaurs
alone are worth the price of admission--this time we get big nasty
spinosaurs with long snouts and huge finned backs, flying pteranodons with
vicious little babies, club-tailed ankylosaurs, noble brachiosaurs,
galloping herds of nanosaurs and, of course, a lot more razor sharp
velociraptors (although this time out *communicative* ones that can
vocalize better than their human prey).  Each time out the huge reptiles
get more and more convincing as technological advances bring them closer
into contact with the prix-fix beauzeaus that either wittingly or
unwittingly stumble onto their Isla Sorna.</P>
<P>        There seems to be some unwritten rule that future chapters of Michael
Crichton's dino-saga must feature cast-offs from a P.T. Anderson picture.
In 1997 it was Julianne Moore; in "Jurassic Park III" it's the turn of
William H. Macy (who, in the film's scariest realization, is the spitting
image of Homer Simpson's good neighbor Ned Flanders).  Moore is "replaced"
by Téa Leoni, naturally enough, which at first consideration seems to be a
sound casting decision ... until you witness Ms. Leoni trying to out act
the special effects.  Sam Neill is back as paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant as
is Laura Dern in a brief bit as Dr. Ellie Sattler; she does the only smart
thing and stays the heck off the island.</P>
<P>        The plot?  "Good dinosaurs, bad people."  OK, the real plot: Mr. and Mrs.
Kirby (Macy and Leoni) con Dr. Grant into helping them find their son Eric
(Trevor Morgan), who has accidentally parasailed onto a Costa Rican island
teeming with large, hungry carnivores.</P>
<P>        The "Jurassic Park" franchise will always be worth seeing for Stan
Winston's mesmerizing creature effects (if you like that sort of thing I
suppose--I almost hated "America's Sweethearts" and would have were it not
for the lovely Julia Roberts and her genuinely fetching smile, so I guess
it's all a matter of taste).  But if it's dumb humans crashing through the
undergrowth you're after, rent a Rambo movie instead.</P>
