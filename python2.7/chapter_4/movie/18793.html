BETRAYAL OF THE DOVE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>There are exploitation movies and exploitation movies. Some
exploit lowest desires of the audience and do it by
delivering huge amounts of senseless violence, gratuitous
erotica or tasteless jokes. But they aren't most despicable
form of exploitation films. Most despicable are those who
exploit the audience naivete, those filled with couple
decent stars or names that should convince viewers that they
would actually see something good. But the sad reality tells
us that Los Angeles happens to be cruel, competitive place,
and often great, good or decent actors are forced to work on
projects that are bellow their standards. In case of Helen
Slater, the actress that the author of this review likes,
BETRAYAL OF THE DOVE, 1993 thriller directed by Strathford
Hamilton, was one of such films.</P>
<P>In this film Helen Slater plays Ellie, young professional
woman faced with many agonising problems in her life. Her
young daughter is having nightmares, her former alcoholic
husband is constantly harassing her, while her matchmaking
co-worker makes thing even more unbearable by introducing
her to her dorky cousin Norman (played by David L. Lender).
Her friend Una (Kelly Le Brock), on the other hand, offers
real treat in the form of young and charismatic doctor Jesse
Peter (Billy Zane). However, soon her life is in danger and
she is forced to question her new friends.</P>
<P>BETRAYAL OF THE DOVE is a lame thriller with complicated yet
nonsencial plot, and characters we actually don't care
about. Even if the actors like Helen Slater, Kelly Le Brock
or Billy Zane worked really hard, they would hardly make us
care for them. The only exception is David L. Lander whose
character, that should have served as some kind of comic
relief, gets brutally eliminated too early in the film. What
we are left is an incoherent mess of subplots (some of them
including parapsychology) and many of the loose ends not
getting tied up in the bloody, Elisabethan and utterly
unconvincing finale. Viewers should do themselves a favour
and skip this one.</P>
