<P>     FRANKIE STARLIGHT is ambitious, and, as is often true of movies
that attempt too much, it's only partially successful.  The film tries
to follow multi-character stories in three different time frames, using
a voiceover narrative to connect everything.  Parts work; parts don't.
Individual enjoyment of FRANKIE STARLIGHT will largely depend upon which
aspects of the film you choose to focus on.</P>
<P>     The wraparound story tells the tale of a modern-day Irish author,
Frank Bois (Peter Dinklage), who is submitting his manuscript,
NIGHTSTALK (as in NIGHTS TALK, not NIGHT STALK), to an editor.  The book
is immediately snapped up by Penguin Press for publication.  An
overnight success, Frank can't help but wonder whether his good fortune
is due to the quality of his work or to his physical stature--he's a
dwarf.  So he spends long hours in his hovel of a home, drinking wine
and stewing in his loneliness.</P>
<P>     According to Frank, NIGHTSTALK is an intermingling of astronomy
with the stories of his and his mother's lives.  FRANKIE STARLIGHT's
ambitious agenda is to transform the events of NIGHTSTALK from text to
screen images by means of lengthy flashbacks.  These forays into the
past start out with promise, as we first meet Bernadette (Anne
Parillaud), Frank's mother, in Normandy, days before the Allied
invasion.  The setting soon changes to Ireland.  Unfortunately, once the
shores of France are behind Bernadette, the story starts glossing over
key plot elements.  Characterization becomes spotty as the film gropes
for an anchor.  Ultimately, FRANKIE STARLIGHT is saved from incoherent
oblivion by the birth of Bernadette's son.  While Parrillaud's character
continues to be paper-thin, the young Frank (Alan Pentony) quickly
asserts himself.  Soon, our attention--not to mention our sympathy--is
vested exclusively in him.  Bernadette becomes an almost unwanted
distraction.</P>
<P>     The last third of the movie is by far the best.  Taking place in
the present, it brings together several loose threads from the past and
weaves them into a touching love story.  There's more emotional depth to
Frank's relationship with his soul mate than is initially obvious, with
director Michael Lindsay-Hogg handling this aspect of his film adeptly.
The actors give heartfelt performances and the script avoids the trap of
emotional artifice which ruins so many screen romances.</P>
<P>     Throughout the entire picture, stars are a key symbol.  Frank
eventually becomes an amateur astronomer, and many of the film's best
sequences take place on a rooftop with thousands of points of light
twinkling in the darkened canopy above.  It is there that father-figure
Jack Kelly (Gabriel Byrne) first teaches young Frank stories about the
constellations, and there that the film draws to a close.  More scenes
like these would have been welcome.</P>
<P>     Connections, both made and missed, and the vagaries of life that
lead us to react differently to the same people in diverse
circumstances, form FRANKIE STARLIGHT's thematic backbone.  As with most
of the film's other aspects, these are generally successful as they
pertain to Frank, but rarely work with Bernadette.  Parillaud's acting
is too flat, and the sketchiness of the screenplay, which follows her
life in broad strokes with few details, doesn't help.  We're sure how
and why Frank connects with others; the same can rarely be said about
his mother.</P>
<P>     FRANKIE STARLIGHT is more satisfying taken as a whole than when its
individual parts are examined.  The film is flawed, but there's still
enough magic and genuine emotion to make for a pleasant movie-going
experience.  Affability is perhaps FRANKIE STARLIGHT's strongest
quality.  No matter how many problems you uncover along the way, when
the final credits roll, you're more likely to be smiling than frowning.</P>
