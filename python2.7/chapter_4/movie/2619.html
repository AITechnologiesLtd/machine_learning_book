<PRE>                               THE COWBOY WAY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Woody Harrelson, Kiefer Sutherland, Ernie Hudson,
           Dylan McDermott.
Screenplay:  Bill Wittliff.
Director:  Gregg Champion.</PRE>
<P>     At some point, when our collective back was turned, Woody
Harrelson became a box office draw.  All right, I'm not saying people
flocked to WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP or INDECENT PROPOSAL thanks to his name
above the title.  Nevertheless, Harrelson has demonstrated an enviable
talent for picking hits, even if that has been the only thing he has
really demonstrated in his fledgling big screen career.  THE COWBOY WAY
is in for a much harder ride towards success, facing stiff summer
competition, but whatever its box office take, there might be more in
it for Harrelson to be proud of personally than any of his previous
films.  Given the challenge of carrying a film for the first time, he
takes a tedious formula picture and singlehandedly makes it at least
moderately endearing.</P>
<P>     THE COWBOY WAY stars Harrelson and Kiefer Sutherland as Pepper
Lewis and Sonny Gilstrap, two New Mexico rodeo champions and longtime
friends.  That friendship is currently strained at best due to Sonny's
lingering resentment over a championship event at which the gleefully
irresponsible Pepper was a no-show.  The two reluctantly re-connect
when an old friend disappears and the trail leads to New York City.
There Pepper and Sonny encounter Stark (Dylan McDermott), a shady
character running a coyote operation bringing in illegal immigrants and
forcing them to work in garment sweat shops.  Among the victims is the
daughter of Pepper and Sonny's friend, leading the two and their
newfound friend on the New York police force (Ernie Hudson) to try to
save her the cowboy way.</P>
<P>     I could easily name fifty variations on this particular theme
which have graced the screen since I have been a regular movie-goer;
fish-out-of-water comedy is as venerable a genre as the Western
itself.  We all know the required elements: a plot point landing the
hero in the strange locale (usually a kidnapped or murdered friend); a
few scenes of the hero interacting with the locals, oblivious to his
own faux pas; a patient local to befriend the hero; a hissably arrogant
bad guy.  THE COWBOY WAY fits every one perfectly creating that
comfortable familiarity filmmakers seek much more frequently than
originality.  The tweaks to that formula THE COWBOY WAY incorporates
run from the obvious (the friendly cop has a romance with cowboy
mythology) to the mildly interesting (Dylan McDermott's insecure
villain), but let's be frank.  THE COWBOY WAY does not, nor was it
meant to, dazzle with its inventiveness.  In fact, there are long
stretches when it's a crashing bore.</P>
<P>     The showpiece here is the energetic performance of Woody
Harrelson, who has a great deal of fun with the lovably oafish Pepper.
In many ways, THE COWBOY WAY plays like little more than a series of
setups for Pepper to do something stupid, which could have been a
nightmare if so many of those stupid things weren't so funny.  His
motor-mouthed cross-country commentary, interrupted by a long silence,
is a delight; Pepper's brazen advances towards a cellist in a posh
restaurant is even more so.  Harrelson makes Pepper an eager-to-please
puppy of a guy, his every movement an ill-fated attempt to impress.
There is even a great throwaway moment near the climactic chase when
Harrelson gets out of Sutherland's pickup truck and asks, "Lock up?"
then proceeds to push the button down through the open window.  As long
as Harrelson was on the screen, THE COWBOY WAY kept me smiling.</P>
<P>     If only there was one interesting person for him to interact
with.  Kiefer Sutherland continues to show that screen presence is a
recessive Sutherland family trait, reading every line as though he had
something on the stove that he really needed to get back to.  Sonny is
supposed to be level-headed, but Sutherland interprets "level-headed"
as "comatose," much as he did in last year's THE THREE MUSKETEERS.
Marg Helgenberger of TV's "China Beach" has a pointless role as a New
York socialite who drags Pepper to a party straight out of MIDNIGHT
COWBOY, and poor Carlos Guzman adds to his resume of hoods.  THE COWBOY
WAY is a tired premise filled with tired-looking actors, but Woody
Harrelson was able to lasso me by the neck and take me along for the
ride.  I'd like to see a home video version where the plot is edited
out entirely; it just ends up getting in Harrelson's way.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 fish out of water:  5.</PRE>
