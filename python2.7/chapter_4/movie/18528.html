<PRE>BY AARON MICHAELS</PRE>
<P>Dark City is a dark, dark movie. It deals with a group called the
Strangers who have taken over a city and are using the locals as
experiments. They have an ability to "tune" which causes people to sleep
and buildings to move. They imprint thoughts into people's brains to see
what makes them tick while they are asleep.</P>
<P>John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), a young man who is your everyday guy, wakes
up the middle of being imprinted. His memory is lost. He stumbles around
and notices a dead prositute horribly murdered near him. How could he
have done this?</P>
<P>He gets a phone call from a excentric doctor Dr. Schreber (Keifer
Sutherland) telling him to get out the building because the Strangers
will find him. He travels around the city for the next 90 minutes being
chased by an Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) and the Strangers lead by
a pale-faced man named Mr. Head (Richard O'Brien) while peacing together
the story.</P>
<P>Dark City is a technically well made film. Proyas along with
cinematographer Dariusz Wolski, composer Trevor Jones, and the art and
set direction teams have created a very interesting world for the
activities to exist in. Towering buildings and city streets are a marvel
to look at. The script by Proyas, Lem Dobbs, and David S. Goyer is also
good and features a new suprise constantly. It plays out like a dark
comic book that was made picture by picture into a movie.</P>
<P>The cast does a fine job with Sutherland and Hurt being the standouts.
Sutherland has always been a sub-par actor in my mind with has
villianous turns in The Lost Boys and Freeway but in this film he plays
a not good, but not bad guy very well. He seems to be having fun gasping
for air constantly
just to sputter out fast dialogue. Hurt has always been a good actor and
he is a great choice as the inspector due to his charm and intelligence.</P>
<P>Almost all films that use visual effects extensively overuse them and
use them for stupid reasons. CGI is almost always just used to create
beasts or fake looking stunts but in Dark City it is used correctly. It
adds to the film very well and is a must have. The "tuning" scenes
highlight the greatness of the technology.</P>
<P>I do have a complaint with the film though. Jennifer Connely has never
been a good actress. She always plays a girl who every guy goggles at
and seems to just be eye candy. In this film she plays Murdoch's
girlfriend and I didn't feel that she was a character. She wasn't
interesting even though she had to be to pull off the character. She
looks out of place in an science fiction film.</P>
<P>With my complaint aside, Dark City is one of the better science fiction
to come out of Hollywood (actually the film was shot in Australia) while
other films are just gory space pictures. Proyas continues his streak of
comic book scripts that are put to screen that he started with The Crow
and I am anticipating his next book on film.</P>
