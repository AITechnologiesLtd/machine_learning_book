<PRE>_Autumn_in_New_York_ (PG-13) ** </PRE>
<P>        With such odious films as _Battlefield_Earth_ and _Coyote_Ugly_
meriting advance screenings for critics, speculation could not help but
reach a fevered pitch when MGM opted not to screen _Autumn_in_New_York_. 
Could this romantic drama featuring two established stars (Richard Gere
and Winona Ryder) and a very capable director (Joan Chen) be a big-name
bellyflop?  Or is it the gem whose plot "secrets" needed to be protected,
as according to the studio's official reason?  The answer, however, is
not nearly as intriguing as either of those extremes.  The genteel and
benign _Autumn_ is hardly the disaster cynics have dreaded, but this love
story is also hardly the all-stops-out tearjerker it strives to be.</P>
<P>        The latter fact stems from a fundamental conflict between the
sensibilities of the screenwriter and director.  Chen's auspicious debut
film, the stunning _Xiu_Xiu:_The_Sent-Down_Girl_, was an intrinsically
powerful story that packed an intensified emotional wallop through its
subtlety--which is not exactly the best match for the shameless
button-pusher that is Allison Burnett's script.  Will Keane (Gere) is a
restaurateur with a well-known reputation for womanizing.  When the
nubile young Charlotte Fielding (Winona Ryder) catches his eye and
expresses interest in return, Will doesn't see any reason why this affair
will be any different until his many others--that is, until she confesses
her terminal illness.  It seems like an ideal arrangement, the ladykiller
 who loves 'em and leaves 'em hooking up with a woman who has no
long-term prospects nor expectations.  But, of course, Cupid will not be
denied.</P>
<P>        Chen is able to give _Autumn_ some of the lyrical understatement
that she lent to _Xiu_Xiu_.  The tasteful love scenes do have a romantic
air; the images (captured by cinematographer Changwei Gu) are lush and
inviting, as is Gabriel Yared's score; and the big emotional moments are
not histrionic.  But this is, as written, a broadly formula exercise in
manipulation, and for it to achieve its desired weepy effect, there needs
to be a more forceful hand at work.  The material simply isn't strong nor
convincing enough on its own to wring tears by itself--and how could it,
given some of the awkward dialogue ("I can smell the moonlight!  When did
I learn to do that?" rhetorically inquires Charlotte before the first big
kiss).</P>
<P>        At least the script is brave enough to address the vast age
difference between Gere and Ryder, making for some of the film's more
amusing repartée.  Together, the pair neither smolder nor fizzle; there
is a compatibility, but not one overwhelming enough to make Will's
inevitable changes completely believable.  Individually, though, they
fare better: Gere can do the cocksure bit in his sleep, and Ryder
displays her natural incandescence (though it ultimately contradicts her
character's condition--she maintains a healthy glow even as things
gradually become more dire).</P>
<P>        Perhaps MGM's no-screening decision on _Autumn_in_New_York_ was
simply a way to get it more publicity than it otherwise would have. 
After all, it is still the season of larger, louder films, and something
this quiet--and unexceptionally so--would barely register with anyone.</P>
