The Truman Show (PG) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>>From the moment he signed his name on the dotted line, _The_Truman_Show_
has been touted as Jim Carrey's big dramatic breakthrough (never mind that
he won numerous critical kudos for his work in the Emmy-nominated TV movie
_Doing_Time_on_Maple_Drive_).  Carrey indeed does a fine job in Peter
Weir's clever fantasy, but to focus all attention on his refreshing
change-of-pace turn is to discount the superior accomplishment of those
behind the scenes--and to give Carrey a bit _too_much_ credit.</P>
<P>Carrey's Truman Burbank has a nice house, white picket fence and all, in
the idyllic oceanside community of Seahaven; a loyal wife, Meryl (Laura
Linney); an even more loyal best friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich); and a
cushy desk job.  If it sounds like a pretty picture from the TV screen,
that's because it is.  Unbeknownst to Truman, the entire life he has lived
is mere programming for a 24-hour television network.  Seahaven is one
large soundstage, where all events are scripted and all the inhabitants are
actors--that is, except for Truman, who was adopted as an infant by the
Omnicam Corporation, and has had every step of his life traced and molded
by _The_Truman_Show_'s creator, Christof (Ed Harris).</P>
<P>In addition to having an inventive plot hook, Andrew Niccol's screenplay
is expertly structured.  In its first minute, the basic outline of the
complex premise is made perfectly clear through a faux television credit
roll and soundbites from Meryl, Marlon (or, rather, the actors who play
them), and Christof.  For about the next hour, Niccol and Weir thrust the
audience directly into Truman's world, allowing them to experience for
themselves the surreal, synthetic way of "life" in Seahaven before going
into a more detailed backstory that fills in the few holes.  In the
process, the viewer is given a much more vivid and entertaining picture of
Truman's situation.</P>
<P>Truman is not as dumb as Christof or other crew members think, and he
begins to catch on to the grand charade that is his life when no one will
let him leave town.  The resulting conflict, within himself and with
everyone and everything around him, provides Carrey ample opportunity to
stretch while staying within comfortable acting bounds.  He gets to cry
(and convincingly at that) onscreen and play a fairly earnest character as
a whole, but he does make concessions to his core comedic audience.  When
Truman's suspicions grow, the more unhinged he gets, setting the stage for
some funny rubberfaced antics (no butt-talking, though--thankfully).</P>
<P>However, his performance is not the Oscar-baiting tour-de-force that a
number of sources would lead you to believe.  Carrey's shortcoming is most
clearly brought to light in one key subplot.  Although he likes Meryl, the
love of his life is Sylvia (Natascha McElhone), a fetching young woman whom
he barely knew in college.  Like the rest, Sylvia was an actress playing a
part, but when she broke script and actually fell for him, she was hastily
removed from the Seahaven set and the _Truman_ cast.  Truman was told that
she and her "father" moved to Fiji, and it's his longing for her that makes
him want to leave town.  This thread is supposed to be _Truman_'s emotional
hook, but it doesn't quite work for a couple of reasons.  The character of
Sylvia, who goes on to be the leader of the "Free Truman" movement, is
sketchily written, as are the reasons behind her deep feelings for Truman;
and, as evidenced in _Liar_Liar_, Carrey just isn't that convincing when it
comes to sentiment.  Granted, _Truman_ is nowhere near as sappy as that
film (not to mention the sap felt out of place there), but, while he is a
likable presence, Carrey doesn't have much of a natural emotional rapport
with the audience or, for that matter, his co-stars.  As such, one may
empathize with Truman's desire to break free, but not necessarily feel for
the romantic plight that motivates that desire.</P>
<P>Hence, the bravura work on display in _The_Truman_Show_ is that of Niccol
and Weir, who have crafted a subtly layered, perceptive, and pointedly
truthful commentary on the media and its and our own voyeuristic
tendencies.  While the ostensible villains of _The_Truman_Show_ are
Christof and his crew, coming off every bit as guilty is the viewing
audience, which is shown eating up every second of Truman's pre-packaged
"life" as their own lives idly waste away.  As outlandish as the entire
premise may seem, isn't _The_Truman_Show_ (in which one's life is
completely exploited as an entertainment "escape" for others) but just one
logical, merging step away from the current likes of _Jerry_Springer_'s
ongoing parade of dysfunction and those real-life "caught on tape" video
shows?</P>
