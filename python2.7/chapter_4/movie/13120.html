<P>     No previous adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel -- and there have
been a couple of pretty good ones recently in GET SHORTY and JACKIE BROWN
-- has captured the author's unique flavor as effectively as OUT OF SIGHT.
Though Leonard usually writes about criminal characters, he doesn't
exactly write crime novels; though his stories are often quite funny, he
doesn't exactly write comic novels; though his narratives always come
together in a way that makes sense, he doesn't exactly let tight plotting
get in the way of an amusing tangent.  Leonard is his own literary animal:
sometimes sordid, sometimes smirking, always sly.</P>
<P>     You'll find every one of those contradictions and then some in OUT OF
SIGHT, a marvelously meandering caper with rhythms all its own.  The story
focuses on the aftermath of the Florida prison escape of career bank
robber Jack Foley (George Clooney).  In the wrong place at the right time
is U. S. marshal Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez), who ends up sharing a
cramped trunk ride with Jack when his friend Buddy (Ving Rhames)
commandeers Karen's car for the escape.  Surprisingly, the ride proves
intriguing to both parties.  Karen manages to free herself and gets on the
case of re-apprehending Jack, though she isn't sure whether she wants him
for business or pleasure.  Jack, meanwhile, prepares for his next big
score, though he isn't sure whether he's more interested in scoring cash
or Karen.</P>
<P>     OUT OF SIGHT certainly works best as a quirky comedy, with
screenwriter Scott Frank (who also adapted GET SHORTY) providing great
material for a superb supporting cast.  Steve Zahn steals every one of his
scenes as Jack and Buddy's perpetually stoned accomplice Glenn, channeling
Crispin Glover with considerably more appealing goofiness.  Also on hand
are Albert Brooks as the white collar crook whose home is our heroes' next
target, Don Cheadle as edgy partner-in-crime Maurice "Snoopy" Miller, and
Dennis Farina as Karen's protective father.  There are even a couple of
sharp unbilled cameos, including Michael Keaton reprising his JACKIE BROWN
character and a final-scene appearance by another veteran of a previous
Leonard adaptation.  Good scripts make even mediocre actors look better;
Frank's script in the hands of these actors is a hilarious gem.</P>
<P>     But OUT OF SIGHT isn't just a comedy.  It's also a love story, if a
very odd one.  The relationship between Jack and Karen is the heart of the
film, a dangerous set-up since the two characters share exactly two scenes
for all practical purposes.  Both scenes, however, are perfectly executed:
the trunk-trapped initial conversation (photographed by Elliot Davis in
seductive tail-light red), and a meeting in a hotel bar which fluidly
shifts to a closer encounter.  Clooney has never looked more comfortable
or charismatic on the big screen, nor has Lopez, for that matter.  With a
clever nod to the fast-attraction nature of film romances (in a reference
to the Redford-Dunaway thriller THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR), OUT OF SIGHT
gets maximum mileage out of the pairing of its stars in a believable
fast-attraction film romance.</P>
<P>     There are also plenty of crime caper elements mixed in with the
comedy and romance, including no small amount of bloodshed, but even then
the film seems entirely cohesive.  Credit director Steven Soderbergh with
crafting a distinctive, unifying look and feel from Frank's deftly
back-tracking script.  Most frequently he employs an abrupt freeze-framing
device, usually to mark transitions between scenes and locations.  In
Soderbergh's capable hands the freeze-frames never feel gimmicky, instead
playing as chapter stops on Leonard's snappy punch lines.  There's nothing
particularly deep or intensely memorable about OUT OF SIGHT -- indeed, the
pace flags a bit at times as it tries to keep up with all its characters 
-- but it's the kind of film that punches holes in the notion that
"entertaining" and "smart" are mutually exclusive adjectives for a summer
film.  This is pure pulp pleasure, the cinematic equivalent of great beach
reading... and what better way is there to describe the work of Elmore
Leonard?</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 SIGHT plans:  9.</PRE>
