<P>Starring David Duchovny, Minnie Driver, Bonnie Hunt, James Belushi,
Robert Loggia, Carroll O'Connor, David Alan Grier. Directed by Bonnie
Hunt. Rated PG.</P>
<P>A new meaning is given to the expression "matters of the heart" in the
farfetched, graceful new romantic comedy Return to Me. It stars
David "Agent Mulder" Duchovny, in his second non-X-Files lead role (his
first came in 1997, in the gigantic flop Playing God), who impresses
with his charisma and comic timing, and Minnie Driver, whose smile is
simply contagious. This is an exuberant but non-manipulative fairy tale
about love prevailing over the most bizarre of circumstances.</P>
<P>The wife of architect/construction worker Bob Rueland (Duchovny) dies
in a tragic car accident. We don't see it happen because director
Bonnie Hunt wanted to preserve the gentle PG rating and because it
doesn't really matter how it happened, only that it did. She was an
organ donor. Her heart was healthy; it is given to Grace Briggs
(Driver), a woman who has lost almost all hope for getting one. The
transplant goes well, and although Grace is destined to live with a
visible scar on her chest, her prognosis is excellent.</P>
<P>Things aren't so hunky-dory with Bob, however. He hasn't stopped
grieving. He doesn't go out. His veterinarian friend (David Alan Grier)
is desperately trying to get him to live again, but it doesn't seem to
be working. The one time Bob does go out on a date, it's a disaster.
Even his dog hasn't gotten over its master's demise; every day when Bob
enters the house, the dog remains at the door, waiting for Mrs. Rueland
to come in after him.</P>
<P>Bob and Grace meet, of course. They both have the feeling that they've
seen each other before, which they really haven't. They fall in love.
Neither have any idea how they are related to each other. For once,
it's a relationship based not on a mood swing or a passionate desire
based on appearances. Instead it's two people who genuinely like each
other -- that is, each thinks the other is a nice person who is fun to
be around. It's genuine: we really feel that these two people may have
a future together.</P>
<P>The idea at the movie's core is farfetched, even ludicrous. The chances
that these two people would actually meet and fall in love without
realizing the situation are negligible. But it doesn't matter. First-
time director Bonnie Hunt, who also stars as Grace's wise-cracking
girlfriend doesn't linger on the specifics. The heart-transplant
subplot is a means to an end rather than an end in itself. After the
first 20 minutes, when the plot is set in motion, Return to Me is about
its characters rather than the situation they are in. The result is a
sweet love story, far more affecting than the average romantic drivel
because it's so much less phony.</P>
<P>The surprise here is David Duchovny. Until now, the X-Files star has
failed miserably on the big screen (except, obviously, in the X-Files
movie) and I was ready to consider him incapable of playing anyone
other than the obsessed Agent Mulder. In Return to Me, we discover his
penchant for comedy. I wouldn't star him in a slapstick extravaganza
but his everyday Joe appeal turns out to be perfect for the sort of
sentimental shtick that abounds here.</P>
<P>Here's the ultimate pitch for Return to Me: you'll laugh, you'll cry,
you won't have the temptation to puke. The biggest problem with movie
love stories, perhaps, is that some of them are sappy and fake, their
emotions exaggerated to the point where we cringe, not believing a
frame of what we're seeing. Granted, a man probably wouldn't fall in
love with a woman who has his dead wife's heart. But the emotions here
are true.</P>
