<P>     Cross LAWRENCE OF ARABIA with CASABLANCA and, say, THE BRIDGES OF
MADISON COUNTRY and you get this tedious, big-scale bodice-ripper about
a man (Ralph Finnes), a married woman (Kristin Scott Thomas), and their
adventurous romance in North Africa during World War II.  Director
Anthony Minghella (TRULY MADLY DEEPLY) adapts the prize-winning novel
that, in film form, begs the question:  how do you treat a movie fairly
that's so obviously overlong?  Especially one that's told in flashback,
meaning that the audience has way too much time to figure out what
happens before it happens.  There are *some* surprises to keep you
awake: an exciting sandstorm, a tense bomb-defusing sequence, and a very
cool airplane crash.  Ms. Thomas gives a passionate, bare-all (and I
mean, bare *all*) performance that miraculously resonates through the
entire almost-three-hour running time.  (Believing the early attraction
between her and Ralph Finnes is another matter.  But, hey, they do
generate some steam!)</P>
<P>     At the packed screening that I saw, butts were growing numb by the
second hour.  A steady stream of survivors knocked knees and sent beer
bottles barreling as they bee-lined for the lobby, or the bathroom, or
the nearest store selling No-Doze.  Oh, sure, there's probably a lean
masterpiece in here, somewhere.  A two-hour quickie that retains the
epic scope, exotic flavor, and big, boo-hoo pay-off.  (Or, perhaps, a
four-hour version with easy-to-follow time shifts and characters who
don't disappear five minutes after we meet them.) Bottom line, THE
ENGLISH PATIENT is a long sit.  The viewer has too much time to think
about other stuff, such as, say, why Willem Dafoe's character doesn't
have anything to do, or if Ralph Finnes might make a good Indiana Jones,
or how the filmmakers kept a straight face while recording those swel-
ling, smothering strings?</P>
