<P>"Do I see it or do I skip it?" I suspect that many readers of reviews 
check this out by cutting to the chase and just checking the critics' 
ratings by stars or letters.  Sometimes this tactic is valid, but it 
does not work for unusual items like "Titus." What's  needed in such 
cases is the equivalent of computer-dating -- matching the movie and 
the personality of the movie-goer.</P>
<P>"Titus" is not the kind of Shakespeare that one would rush to see on 
the stage. Its screen progenitor Julie Taymor has done the next best 
thing: making it a wild sight-and-sound spectacle. Her challenging, 
hugely idiosyncratic production is unlike anything else. It stands on 
its own feet, Roman sandals or Gucci shoes. At three hours minus 
eighteen minutes it is not recommended to the mainstream  public or 
the faint of heart,  but for cognoscenti there is a definite 
enrichment.</P>
<P>Ms. Taymor, admired for her fanciful theater-staging of Disney's "The 
Lion King,". also did a quirky "Titus" off-Broadway around 1994. 
"Titus-the-movie" is a specialty picture. It is for those who follow 
no-holds-barred experimental avant-garde. For Post-modernists who 
specialize in Shakespeare and are curious to see what Ms. Taymor did 
with, and to, the Bard. For some of the many students who never read 
"Titus Andronicus," a work which always been at the bottom of the 
pile of assigned Shakespeare -- assuming it was placed on the list at 
all.</P>
<P>The story revolves around Roman General Titus who returns after a 
great victory over the Goths. He brings prisoners, QueenTamora among 
them. (Her name looks like a version of "Taymor"). Hewing to a jolly 
tradition, he executes her oldest son.</P>
<P>Titus declines to be crowned Emperor. Instead, he nominates foppish 
Saturninus. But the  General modesty and generosity are repaid with a 
maze of political plots, counter-plots, machinations, assassinations, 
rivers of blood and cut-off body parts.</P>
<P>The play, a very early one by William S., is his most gory and 
violent. The film's extra-vivid visuals make it even bloodier. To 
mention merely three gruesome occurences,  Titus's daughter who gets 
raped by two young men before they cut off her hands. Titus's 
self-mutilates.. He cooks up the now-butchered rapists as meat pies 
served to unsuspecting Bad People.</P>
<P>The over-the-top play becomes a topping-the-topper movie. Not a sight 
for sore eyes but a sight to make the eyes sore. Ms.Taymor takes 
Shakespeare's feverish imagination and keeps adding to it. The "less 
is more" principle of the Weimar Republic's Bauhaus ushered in 
modern, simple, functional design. The slogan for this movie should 
be "more is more."</P>
<P>"Titus" was shot in Italy, with some parts in Croatia.. Its 
production credits are a Who's Who of abundantly imaginative, 
audacious collaborators. They are  mostly Italian. The main exception 
is a French woman: veteran, international and eclectic editor 
Francoise Bonnot. She has been cutting films since 1962, including 
six by Costa-Gavras (down to his latest, "Mad City"). Among the 
non-Gavras pictures are  "Black and White in Color," "Un Amour de 
Swann," Polanski's "The Tenant," "The Year of the Dragon." "Titus" is 
a big stretch for Ms. Bonnot, with its surrealism at opposite poles 
to the realism of her past labors.</P>
<P>Julie Taymor's tactics are something like "Anachronism as Art." In 
the demented sights of her film we get automobiles brushing against 
Roman legionnaires, toga-clad people smoking cigarettes, modern 
priests among breastplated warriors, a T-shirted boy,  tuxedo-wearing 
adults among ancient garb, a huge modern bank safe, helmets with 
delirious ornaments, modern jazz, boogie woogie, sundry methods of 
torture, assault rifles, revolvers and poniards....</P>
<P>That's just a sampling. There's also the make-up such as that for 
centurions with  ash-covered faces who march like computer-made 
creatures. Additionally, shots or scenes may remind you of Federico 
Fellini's outlandish faces and bodies; or of his streetwalkers in 
"Nights of Cabiria."</P>
<P>What obviously Ms. Taymor had in mind was to modernize Shakespeare 
while showing his undiminished relevance. She establishes many 
parallels to contemporary (and eternal) politics, maneuvers, tricks 
but no treats. Her references run from the non-glory that was Rome to 
Italian Fascism, dirty deeds, inhumanity, and other such niceties of 
our times</P>
<P>Fantasy has no limits.. And there's the rub. The uncompromising 
excesses are --for what they are -- spectacular, perhaps admirable, 
certainly novel. But they also distract. You don't concentrate as 
much as you wonder whilst the layers of visuals often cover up the 
language.</P>
<P>Above all, Shakespeare is words. His text for "Titus Andronicus" is 
not while not as stupendous as that of  his mature plays, yet is 
still replete with great lines and verse. But I could not always 
catch them. For several reasons.T he one mentioned above. The 
unfamiliarity with the play, even if one has read it before. The 
torrent of words delivered with    rat-tat-tat speed. The accents of 
players who are British, Americans trying to sound British, or Brits 
trying perhaps to sound un-British.</P>
<P>I miss my beloved Oxbridge or BBC accents, especially the amazing 
clarity of Laurence Olivier's euphonious, sonorous, mesmerizing voice 
in his Shakespearian plays and films, in fact in everything else the 
man performed. Also in his narrations, as for "The World at War." For 
that matter, I miss too the voice and delivery of Orson Welles.</P>
<P>In counter-argument to myself I'll admit that while "Titus" needs 
state-of-the art sound equipment, acoustics and audio balance, these 
were not available at the auditorium where I saw this work.</P>
<P>In the audiovisual orgy that is "Titus,":the players range from good 
to excellent in their peculiarly styled roles. Cast leaders Anthony 
Hopkins and Jessica Lange do not sound traditionally 
"Shakesperean,"only semi so. This fits the staging. For Lange  (who 
becomes the new Emperor's consort) and for many of the actors, the 
defining word is "malevolence." Tamora paves the way for Lady 
Macbeth, who by comparison is almost  a sweetie.</P>
<P>The grandest schemer-plotter of them all is Aaron the Moor, played by 
black actor Harry Lennix. He is also Tamora's lover and, in a modern 
way, the main hater of the Establishment and its prejudices. I 
suppose that Shakespeare had a change of heart later when, way ahead 
of his time, he championed minorities such a Jews and blacks. In 
"Othello," the great soul is the Moor of Venice, while the villainous 
Iago is a nasty white man who in some ways inherits Aaron's 
trickeries and treacheries..</P>
<P>Influences or inspirations last to the very end..The last shot is a 
freeze- frame, the kind that Francois Trufaut's "The 400 Blows" made 
so very popular that it became a cliche. Here however, this deja vu 
is mitigated by a clever aural trick. "Vivere," one of the many songs 
by the famous Cesare Andrea Bixio is heard over the end- 
credits..There is no Italian alive who does not know  all Bixio's 
compositions, no Italian tenor who has not sung or recorded them, 
from Tito Schipa and Feruccio Tagliavini to Luciano Pavarotti..The 
singer here is Carlo Buti, in an older, original recording.. All this 
may sound like a detail, but for Italian audiences, "Vivere" which 
means "To Live," makes a melodiously ironical "finis."</P>
<P>NOTE  for lovers of popular Italian music.  Bixio (1896-1975) was 
prolific, had major hits throughout his whole life. Starting with the 
first Italian sound movie "La Canzone dell'Amore" (1930) most, 
perhaps all of his songs were introduced in films. His best period 
was 1930 -1940, with tremendously popular pieces at home and in most 
of Europe:  "Parlami d'amore, Mariu," "Violino Tzigano," "Torna 
piccina mia," "La mia canzone al vento,"  "Mamma,"  "Vivere" and 
others.</P>
