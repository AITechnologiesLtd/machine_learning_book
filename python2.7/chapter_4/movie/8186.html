<PRE>A SIMPLE WISH
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     This year New York City is hosting the annual NAFGA (North
American Fairy Godmothers Association) convention, and, of course,
every self-respecting fairy godmother wants to be there, including the
lone male fairy godmother Murray (Martin Short) and one gone over to
the dark side, a witch named Claudia (Kathleen Turner).  For
companionship, Claudia brings along her recently humanized dog Boots
(Amanda Plummer).</P>
<P>     It must have sounded promising to Mara Wilson's parents when her
agent pitched her proposed part in A SIMPLE WISH.  After Mara's success
in a featured role in MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET followed by a starring
role in MATILDA, she would get to work with two big name stars,
Kathleen Turner and Martin Short, in a film with a promising plot.</P>
<P>     Perhaps her parents should have studied the script by Jeff
Rothberg (THE AMAZING PANDA ADVENTURE) to see if it contained more than
some cute magic tricks - it doesn't.</P>
<P>     Probably more apropos would have been for them to view director
Michael Ritchie's collection of films including such forgettable ones
as his last three, THE FANTASTICKS, COPS AND ROBBERSONS and THE SCOUT.
Ritchie spends all of his creative energy in A SIMPLE WISH in clever
staging of the wishes, and allocates no time for directing the acting.
If Turner and Short have insulted their viewing public with more
pathetic acting in other movies, the names of the films do not come to
mind.</P>
<P>     A SIMPLE WISH has one of the most inauspicious beginnings on
record.  Murray, looking extra weird with his large front teeth caps,
is taking his fairy godmother qualifying exam.  For five long and
tedious minutes, Short demonstrates how to overact while doing
slapstick.</P>
<P>     We then switch to the Greening family.  Single dad, aren't they
all in the movies today, Oliver (Robert Pastorelli) drives a
horse-drawn carriage around Central Park, but he wants to be a Broadway
singer in the musical TWO CITIES.  His son Charlie (Francis Capra) is
the typical obnoxious movie teenager.  His daughter Anabel, played
sweetly by the gifted actress Mara Wilson, has a brand new and highly
incompetent fairy godmother, Murray, to help her.</P>
<P>     "One wish per customer and no wishes for more wishes," explains
Murray.  "They plugged that loophole up years ago.  In past years there
were abuses."</P>
<P>     There are about a half dozen wishes in the show and Murray screws
up most of the them.  My favorite is when Murray transports Anabel and
himself to the fleabag Plaza Motel in Nebraska instead of the luxurious
Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.  When the tobacco chewing redneck who owns
the place draws a bead on them with a shotgun, Murray tries to turns
him into a little rabbit.  Ops, big mistake.  An angry giant rabbi
starts attacking them.</P>
<P>     Prophetically, Anabel says at one point, "This stinks."  To which
Murray concurs, "I know, it's bad."  And how.</P>
<P>     A SIMPLE WISH runs 1:30.  It is rated PG for perhaps a few bad
words that I missed.  The show would be acceptable for all ages.  My
son Jeffrey, age 8, thought the show was "excellent," and his buddy
Matthew, age 8, said that the film "goes up there among my favorites."
I found most of the film pathetic so I give it thumbs down.  For the
imaginative wishes and for poor Mara Wilson's nice performance in a
terrible picture, I give it * 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
