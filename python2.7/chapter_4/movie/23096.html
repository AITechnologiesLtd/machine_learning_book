<PRE>FILM TITLE:  The Children of Chabannes
SUPER FEATURES:  Magnificent story of one of many heroic stands during WW2
         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P> While this is not a feature film at all, and showing in a Foreign Film
Festival, there is one ting that this has going for it, that is subtle,
imaginative and totally engrossing. The compelling beauty in this film is
really the same survival instinct that has spawned so many other film
directors and creative artists, whose lives had been affected and destroyed,
during WW2. One might mention right off the blocks the likes of Andres
Wajda, or Roman Polanski, or Volker Schlondorf, and many others, but
comparing their emotional work, to this film, is something that is difficult
to bypass, and leave alone. This fine documentary film, even though it has
personal connections for Director Lisa Gossels, is a whole lot more.</P>
<P> There is not much to say about Chabannes. Like many villages, and many
other people whose stories are still untold, both horrific or simply heroic,
some not so great, but no less valid in the context of things, this so
special of a film, makes a track that is difficult, that is exciting, and
almost makes one wonder why is it that many of these are not honored as they
should be. Not so much as a group of people that saved many Jewish lives,
but also as a group of people that believed in things far larger and wider
than simply a who's who of a religious world. Something that is still found
today, in so many places.</P>
<P> Chabbannes, was a remote location that had the fortune of having some good
teachers and a feisty and energetic school administrator, that had more
passion for the same children that he supervised, and did what he could to
ensure he could do well for them. And when, in the unoccupied part of
France, this deteriorated with decrees that denied Jewish people a part in
their daily lives amidst others, this school and many of its teachers, some
of whom could have easily snitched, did more in the way of helping a lot of
children, be they Jewish or not, that is still remembered fondly, and
deservedly so, today. Films like this, do the one thing that allows this to
be stapled as one of the many monumental events. Saving 400 refugee children
may not have sounded like many, but considering the odds and the political
climate, it is a massive undertaking, that constitutes fortitude, heart, no
sleep, love, and above all an astuteness of personality that must always be
a step ahead of the pursuers and those in charge of making sure these things
do not happen, as did a befuddled Chief of Police, who from his quotes, must
have known what is going on.</P>
<P> Of special attention in this well written and directed film, with
magnificent continuity, is the lively interviews with three or four of its
instructors who were alive at the time, and still are today. Their energy
and desire to do something more, was not what they were after. It was their
dedication to the children alone, Jewish or not, that shows up immediately,
and one can easily reminisce our own school days, today, to notice that
there were a lot of instructors that have never had an inch of heart
anywhere near these. The athletics instructor that made sure they all had
strength where others will not. The other instructor that told them all that
the cold could not beat them to win, and the other teachers that made sure
that many of these boys and girls survived, against horrible odds, in a
country where their livelihoods and rights had been revoked for political
reasons and gains.</P>
<P> If there is a bit of a sad thing in this film for this reviewer, it is a
personal one. I was born in 1950 in Portugal, and these kinds of films were
ingrained in our minds as youngsters, and we were pretty much told a fairly
good sense of right and wrong. It helped that my own father was becoming a
well known name in Portuguese literature along the way, and his armada, was
not exactly Jewish children, but the arts, movies, paintings, the music,
that has marked the 20th century. By the time I was 10 and we had moved to
brazil, we had already met, house, and fostered friends and other teachers
and professors that had many connections to many events in Europe, some in
various concentration camps, some involved in other resistances, and some
that simply hid for a long time, and fought their own war. Their stories,
like this one at Chabannes, still remains vivid in my heart and mind, and
still the most scary part for me to tackle. It is not a fear, it is not a
love, it is not a life. It is something that people raised under the mantle
of a Walt Disney, and a yellow brick road, have a hard time understanding,
or really having much compassion for. Their guilt is only measured in the
acceptance of a Spielberg film or two, not in the people around them. I have
found that day in and out, many of the people around me, are far too distant
to have any sort of direct knowledge (and mine is indirect) about these
things and what they constitute to one's life. Vietnam came close, but the
denial of what happened then, or understanding of what it has done for many
lives, is not any different for me. People around me still play war games in
their life, and play war games in their computers as if nothing mattered and
it was fun. Quake and Doom and Half-Life still rule. I, personally, have
never enjoyed that attitude, since my own family was involved in the war in
these endeavors, still unspoken to this day, while they were under a Fascist
government not unlike the one in Spain. And I still do not know what it is
they did ... probably never will.</P>
<P> It is wonderful to see that there are believers in the true human spirit,
that knows and understands that war is sick, and that people make a
difference. I wish I could say the same thing to many others today, who
still engage in conflicts with their neighbors, petty materialistic crap
that has so little to do with real life, that turns into sad destruction for
others. I imagine this to be a fault in the internal constitution that has
room for a God in a book, but no action in one's heart. If anything, the
thrust of this film, which can hardly be measured in the scale of human
dignity -- the one that is least discussed -- is that the future is always
in our hands, and that those who are most innocent are the ones that will
need it, and will have to live in it.</P>
<P> Magnificent film, about something that many of us will never experience, or
fully understand. Well done, Lisa Gossels.</P>
