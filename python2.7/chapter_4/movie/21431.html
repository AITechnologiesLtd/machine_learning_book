<PRE>Review by Donlee Brussel</PRE>
<P>In case you didn't know by now, "Meet Joe Black" is a remake (rip off)
of the the 1934 film "Death Takes A Holiday." There are a couple of
differences between the two. One, which is mentioned by most critics
and people, is that "Meet Joe Black" is unduly extended at 2 hours and
59 min.  With their 3 hours of film, I got to listen and watch insipid,
prosaic dialogue and situations involving lamb sandwiches, peanut
butter, and party arrangements.  I got to hear banal one-liners come
out of the characters that seemed to be from the last Pauly Shore
movie's cutting floor.</P>
<P>The other thing "Black" had that wasn't used to its advantage was a $95
million budget that was wasted on... Hell, I don't think anyone knows.
Maybe it was on the 8 writers who gave this film six sub-plots.  Maybe
it was on the CGI of all the actors and actresses besides Anthony
Hopkins in the film (There's no way real people are that cardboard).</P>
<P>Don't interpret this as me saying this film has no saving graces.
Anthony Hopkins gives a respectable performance here, and as always,
Martin Brest directs a few good scenes in `Meet Joe Black.'  However,
the only real thing that could've saved this movie is spending more
time in the editing room.  Avoid this and go see the 1934 original
that's much better than what I saw.</P>
