<P>Before going to see The Thin Red Line, I had heard that the film was
nothing but a visually impressive look into Terrence Malick's own ego. 
I heard that it was bloated, impenetrable, and thematically weak.   I
didn't hear that it was a bad movie -- no, I simply had heard that it
wasn't going to be as good as I hoped it would be.  Times like this
remind me of why I shouldn't listen to word of mouth.</P>
<P>You see, The Thin Red Line is a wonderful film.  It's at once the most
visually stunning picture of 1998 and the most thematically layered. 
Malick's loose interpretation of the James Jones novel is also a hugely
ambitious picture --  it brings us a frightening, surrealistic vision of
war.  It shows us the way World War II affected individual soldiers.  It
shows us the way war destroys nature and the physical world.  Malick
does all of this in one, three-hour package that can not possibly be
fully understood with just one viewing.</P>
<P>One problem I heard is that the film doesn't have much of a narrative. 
This is true, though I don't think it's a problem.  The picture centers
around a group of soldiers and their advance on Guadalcanal.  As the
film opens, we meet Private Witt (James Caviezel), living among a group
of peaceful natives.  The first twenty minutes of the film are slow and
pensive -- Malick is clearly focusing on the simple lifestyle of the
natives, the way they happily live in and among nature.  One of the best
shots in the film occurs early on:  after several minutes of the serene,
colorful images, an American ship emerges in the distance.  It's a
jostling image, and one that strikes us simply because technology, when
compared to nature, is ugly.</P>
<P>The next act of the picture has the soldiers advancing on Guadalcanal. 
They land on the island with no casualties, but they soon find Japanese
resistance on the rolling hills inland.  Lt. Col. Gordon Tall (Nick
Nolte) is in charge of the operation.   Beneath him is Captain James
Staros (Elias Koteas); Tall wants the men to charge straight up the
hill, but Staros has a problem sending his men in to die.  There are
many soldiers in these scenes, but only a few get notable screen time: 
Private Witt, with his constant introspections about the meaning of
life, and Private Bell (Ben Chaplin), who can not stop thinking about
his wife (Miranda Otto) back home.</P>
<P>Malick's most apparent success is in the battle scenes.  They are truly
frightening, and flawlessly photographed.  For several minutes, Malick
focuses on the lush, verdant hills, covered in tall grass, intertwined
with the gales that slide through the rolls.  Then, without warning,
bombs explode, defacing the stunning image.   The soldiers run through
the landscape like ants, getting picked off by by Japanese soldiers,
invisible in the mountainsides.  Hans Zimmer's musical score pounds
mercilessly in the background.  Malick is unflinching here -- people die
instantly, without big, Hollywood death scenes.  Characters that he
introduces to us suddenly lose their life, and Malick doesn't
apologize.  He perfectly captures the unrelenting chaos of war.</P>
<P>But the war scenes are not all that Malick does perfectly.  The slow,
contemplative character moments are equally powerful.  The film has a
lot of voice-over narration; we can't always tell who's talking, and
that's a sobering statement on Malick's part -- he seems to suggest that
none of these soldiers have any life beyond war.  Frequent shots of the
serenity of nature provide jostling evidence that Malick finds humanity
and war a cancerous force on earth.</P>
<P>The Thin Red Line is also a showcase for the actors involved.  I
normally find Nick Nolte repulsive, but he is the shining performance
here.  There is so much in his character -- from the reasons he wants
the soldiers to head right into death, all the way down to the
disappointment he has in his son -- and Nolte handles all of these
layers with ease.  Caviezel is also wonderful; I've never seen him in
anything else, but I found his character the most interesting.  Chaplin
(Washington Square) is another standout; watch carefully the scene in
which he reads the letter from his wife.   Both Koteas and Penn have
significant roles, and both handle the burden effortlessly.  There are
also interesting cameos from John Cusack, John Travolta, and George
Clooney.</P>
<P>Until now, I've resisted mentioning Saving Private Ryan.  And while I
appreciate the reviews that have not made a comparison between the two
films, I'd like to address it here.  Saving Private Ryan was a film that
affected me initially, and gradually lost its power as I thought about
the numerous contrivances in the story.  Frankly, The Thin Red Line
makes Spielberg's film look like a cartoon.  Malick's picture is far
superior in every way -- he doesn't apologize for war the way Spielberg
does.  He avoids every kind of Hollywood cliche (including the hideous
bookends that Spielberg couldn't resist using).   Saving Private Ryan,
by comparison, looks like it was shot on a soundstage.  The Thin Red
Line never feels that way.  I'm not saying that Spielberg's film is bad
-- no, I think it has a lot to offer.  But Malick's film is more
satisfying in each aspect.</P>
<P>However, I will admit that Saving Private Ryan is easier to approach. 
I don't think The Thin Red Line is for everyone (there were, after all,
numerous walk-outs during my screening).  It's long.  It's slow.  It's
extremely pensive.  But it's also a profound film, both thematically and
visually.  It takes energy to watch it, and it will drain you.  It might
even make you feel dehumanized.  But I don't think anyone can ignore the
power that Malick harnesses here.  I've never seen a better war film
than The Thin Red Line, and, for some reason, I don't think I ever will.</P>
