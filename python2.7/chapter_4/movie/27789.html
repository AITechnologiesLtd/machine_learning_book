<P>PLOT:
A cartoon artist falls into a coma and drifts into a nether world of
nightmares. In this place, the cartoonist meets the character that he
created, called Monkeybone, and attempts to return to the real world.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Take one part annoying monkey, one part Brendan Fraser playing his "goofy"
character once again, one part cool nightmarish visuals and one part lame
story and you pretty much get the gist of this picture. But let's not forget
to mention Whoopie Goldberg as the character of "death" (or should I
say...the "kiss of death"? hehehe). Anyway, it all adds up to something
that's generally pretty interesting to look at, but ultimately unsatisfying
and a little schytzophrenic. One of the film's main problems seems to be
that it doesn't really know what it wants to be. Is it a movie for adults,
kids, a tear-jerker, romance, comedy...a little bit of everything? Probably
the latter, and trying to please everyone at the same time is generally not
the best way to create a solid picture. For me, the whole thing just seemed
a little off-kilter (and not necessarily the way in which they were trying
to achieve off-kilterness). The first half of the film didn't particularly
reserve any laughs for me or anything, but did display many an eye-catching
item in the "nightmare" world (oh yeah, and Rose McGowan, too...growl!). But
the second half of the film moved away from all that, and tried to slip some
romance and broad comedy bits in there, and despite some of it being
somewhat amusing, the general nature of it was pretty hum-drum.</P>
<P>And ironically, one of the last scenes from the movie featured one of the
worst blue screen effects that I've seen in any film for some time. How is
that even possible? It's almost as if they ran out of ideas or money in the
second half, and relied more on Fraser's over-the-top monkey acting and
Fonda's tears to keep things going (and I'm not insulting him here,
dudes...he's supposed to act like a monkey!). Granted, Chris Kattan was
really funny during his few moments on-screen (think D'Onofrio from MEN IN
BLACK), but the overall product was just too confused and unsubstantial.
It's especially sad when you consider that the movie does obviously have an
original concept, a great visual style and a pretty cool soundtrack, but the
characters aren't very developed and the story rather thin, so you really
aren't left with much to chew on. Of course, if you like to smoke the cheeba
and watch this kinda stuff, this might just be the movie for you, or even if
you just wanna see one of the coolest rollercoaster rides in any movie, but
for most, this picture will likely not entertain. An altogether dark movie
or a lighter, fluffier all-out comedy might've worked, but as the film
stands now, it's just too diluted to be appreciated by anyone.</P>
