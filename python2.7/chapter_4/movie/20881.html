<PRE>DRIVE ME CRAZY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Every other week of late brings another generic teen comedy to our local
movie theaters.  With interchangeable plot points and photogenic young
actors, most of them share the same remarkable blandness.  This week's
entry is John Schultz's DRIVE ME CRAZY.  Lamer than most, it does manage
to rise above the worst of the genre, flicks such as the unbearable
JAWBREAKER.</P>
<P>In my generation it was silly surfer movies that the studios put out by
the dozens in order to attract those lucrative teen audiences, flush
with cash and ready to spring for lots of refreshments at the concession
stand.  The latest slew of teen movies is no worse than the old surfer
ones and no better.  Think of them all as representative of a class of
movies that are the cinematic equivalent of elevator music.  They pass
the time and rarely offend.</P>
<P>DRIVE ME CRAZY takes place at a high school about to celebrate its
centennial year, which means -- are you sitting down? -- the movie will
end in a -- surprise! -- big prom.  There have been so many proms this
year that one feels underdressed in the theater without a tux or a prom
dress.</P>
<P>The story concerns two next-door neighbors, Nicole (Melissa Joan Hart)
and Chase (Adrian Grenier), who used to share the same tree house when
they were little.  Now seniors, they don't like each other anymore.</P>
<P>When Nicole isn't asked to the prom as planned by the school's hottest
jock, she asks the disheveled Chase to help her out.  If he'll go with
her, she suggests she'll treat him to some sex as a reward.  To make it
look genuine, he'll have to get cleaned up, and they'll have to act like
they're an item.</P>
<P>Think they'll end up falling in love for real?  Well, duh!</P>
<P>And will there be several scenes of underage drinking and binging?  Of
course.  This movie tries to make it seem more harmless by having one
kid, Dave (Mark Webber) be the school's designated driver.  He provides
free taxi service to all of those too drunk to drive.  Poor Dave gets
ridiculed for taking such a demeaning job.  Being considered a loser,
Dave, you can be sure, will eventually be fixed up by the script with a
gorgeous girl as his compensation.</P>
<P>The completely predictable and uneventful story ends with a small twist
that would have provided a good starting point for a more substantial
comedy.  But it might have demanded some intelligence on the part of the
viewers, something Rob Thomas's significantly underdeveloped script
avoids like the plague.</P>
<P>This much can be said.  Even if their acting in this movie isn't much,
Hart and Grenier seem to be having a good time.  Too bad the same can't
be said of most of the audience.</P>
<P>DRIVE ME CRAZY runs 1:34.  It is rated PG-13 for teen alcohol and drug
use and for language.  It would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
