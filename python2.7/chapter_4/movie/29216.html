<PRE>"Apocalypse Now Redux"</PRE>
<P>Everyone knows about the Oscar-winning 1979 film "Apocalypse Now" and, if
you're a film nut like me, also about the trials and tribulations of that
problem plagued production. Years in the making, the film was released, to
both critical and popular acclaim, in a 150 minute version. It is a film
that is easily a member of the top 100 films of all times club. But, as
with anything that has dollar signs attached to it, the filmmakers decided
to re-cut the film, restoring footage that fell to the cutting room floor
more than two decades ago and, like the phoenix rising from the ashes,
giving Francis Ford Coppola the chance to show us his "real vision" in
"Apocalypse Now Redux."</P>
<P>Longer does not necessarily make better and, sometimes, there is a reason
for scenes to be dropped in the editing process of a film that is an
artistic achievement like "Apocalypse Now." The original movie  - which, by
the way, ended with a B52 strike, an ending the was deleted after the
film's first run, a decision by the director because he felt the audience
would not understand his intent. I, personally, preferred the original
original - was not a perfect movie. The flaw lay in the theatricality when
Colonel Kurtz (the notorious Marlon Brando) enters the picture. Prior to
that, the road trip (well, river trip) that brings Captain Willard (Martin
Sheen) to the renegade colonel's lair is a varied, violent journey that
uses the backdrop of the failing American effort to stop Communism in
Vietnam.</P>
<P>The film, even the '79 version, is made up of a series of interludes
involving Willard and the crew of the Navy motor patrol boat assigned to
his secret mission, the kind of heavily-armed, plastic-bottomed boat that
prowled the rivers in search of Charlie on Vietnam's massive Mekong Delta.
We all remember the unforgettable Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his
Ride of the Valkyrie attack on the heavily-armed Viet Cong compound - "I
love the smell of napalm in the morning...it smells of victory" is a movie
line that is up there with "In all the gin joints in all the towns in all
the world she had to come into mine." Then there's the Playboy Bunny bit
and the last outpost scene and sampan sequence and more. So, with this
wealth of well done, beautifully shot (cinematography by Vittorio Storaro)
scenes that put a unique spin on the Joseph Conrad story, "Hearts of
Darkness," can it be made better? In a word, no.</P>
<P>The makers, led by Coppola and long-time collaborator, editor Walter Murch,
have reassembled the film from original unedited raw footage and included
not only missing scenes, but reedited and repositioned existing scenes, as
well. In my honest opinion, I liked the restructuring of the original movie
scenes the makers made. They give the individual sequences more clarity.
But the added, previously unseen, scenes do not work. The Colonel Kilgore
sequence is extended with Willard and company stealing the mad commander's
favored surfboard, introducing a mirth in Willard that doesn't fit the
character. The much-discussed French plantation sequence resolves some
things that were at loose ends in the original, but, overall, the added
footage is completely out of context to the rest of the film except to
narrate the past, war-ridden history of Vietnam and its colonization by the
French. Most of it feels like a personal travelogue that belongs in an
another film entirely.</P>
<P>An expanded Playboy playmate sequence that has Willard trading diesel fuel
for sexual favors for his crew goes against the grain and is introduced, I
think, because they had the T&A, so why not use it now? Otherwise, the
scene does not belong. An additional progression with Kurtz reading a Time
magazine to the captive Captain Willard helps to show the "normal" side of
the colonel following an insane, brutal act and it fits well.</P>
<P>Coppola and company have made a bigger, but not better, movie that does
have to be seen, especially on the big screen. If you extract the bloated,
additional stuff and keep the restructuring you might come up with
something that really is an improvement over the original. This version
isn't. The '79 "Apocalypse Now" gets an A and "Redux" diminishes with a B+.</P>
