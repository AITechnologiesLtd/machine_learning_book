<PRE>HE GOT GAME
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Spike Lee got game.  Ain't no two ways about it.  Should anyone
tell you otherwise, consider this for starters:</P>
<P>The music for Lee's latest film, "He Got Game," is by the late 20th
Century composer Aaron Copland, he of the sublimely obnoxious opus
"Appalachian Spring."  Now I've never liked Copland, especially
"Appalachian Spring."  But in "He Got Game," Copland works.  Majestically.
Even the snatches of "Appalachian Spring" on the soundtrack didn't cause me
any discomfort.  Not at all.  In fact, I loved it.  The brass; the
cacophony of sound--it just worked.  Coupled with prominent rap songs by
Public Enemy and "He Got Game" exhibits one of the most esoteric song
scores in recent memory.  Credit that to filmmaker Lee, the man with--among
other talents--game.</P>
<PRE>Game with a capital g, that is.</PRE>
<P>Lee's latest film takes two complex themes and expertly blends them
into what appears, on the surface, to be a relatively straightforward
story: if incarcerated felon Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington) can
convince his basketball-playing, high school hot-shot son to opt for the
Governor's alma mater, his stay in the state penitentiary will be
curtailed.  The themes, as presented, seem simple enough too: the high cost
of fame, and the even higher price of having accidentally destroyed
something you loved.</P>
<P>"He Got Game" reveals the surprising sadness of being wooed by both
slick professional agents and countless universities promising assurances
of the good life, and how that pressure can sometimes be too enormous a
burden to bear.  And with startling honesty, this profound difficulty is
contrasted with Shuttlesworth's own personal tragedy.</P>
<P>At the beginning of "He Got Game" it's not clear why convicted
Attica inmate Shuttlesworth is doing time,  And that's another strength of
Lee's film; the story details unfold with precise, revelatory specificity,
like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle snapping into place.</P>
<P>Washington, if not already, should be deigned a national treasure.
His work here is superlative, surpassing almost anything he's done before.
His portrayal of Jake, a loving, supportive family man at odds with his
son, is by turns sensitive, tough, and ultimately human.</P>
<P>The supporting performances in "He Got Game" are worthy of mention
too: Milla Jovovich ("The Fifth Element") as a strung-out Coney Island
hooker; Lonette McKee as Jake's wife, Martha; Zelda Harris as their
resilient daughter, Mary.  All are commendable.  And last but by no means
least, NBA star Ray Allen, a brilliant acting debut as Jesus Shuttlesworth,
the son torn by promise, prestige, and conflicting family loyalties.</P>
<P>Stylistically, Lee's film is a marvel, covering the court with a
variety of cinematic techniques: documentary-style commentary from famous
college hoop coaches (such as Temple's John Chaney); kinetic, solarized
jump-cut sequences that play like a Nike commercial; slow-motion basketball
montages that will make even a non-believer sit up and take notice--all
backed by Copland's blaring horns and harmonics.</P>
<P>I don't doubt for a minute that this accomplished director could
make even a game of cricket appear exciting.</P>
<P>"He Got Game" is, pure and simple, one slam dunk of a motion picture.</P>
