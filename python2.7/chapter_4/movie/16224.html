<P>Susan Granger's review of "HI-LO COUNTRY" (Gramercy Pictures)</P>
<P>Leave it to an English director, Stephen Frears ("The
Grifters," "Dangerous Liaisons," "Mary Reilly'), to combine American
idealism with fading cowboy credos. Adapted by Walon Green ("The Wild
Bunch") from a 1961 novel by Max Evans, the story, set in a prairie
town called Hi-Lo in rural New Mexico, revolves around Woody Harrelson
as Big Boy Matson. He's still into hard livin' - drivin' cattle,
drinkin', fightin', and chasin' women - but - in the post W.W. II era
- he's out of place. He's like a demented Peter Pan, a boastful kid
who won't grow up. The story begins with Billy Crudup sitting in a van
with a shotgun across his lap, saying, "I once set out to kill
someone." Utilizing flashbacks, we learn the circumstances which led
up to his dilemma. Pivotal to the problem is his obsession with
flirtatious Patricia Arquette, who is unhappily married to a spineless
wimp and hot for his rough-and-ready best friend and business
partner. "A good woman is like a good horse 'n she's got bottom" is
the way Big Boy puts it.  Then there's wily Sam Elliott as a
cold-blooded, land-grabbing, wealthy rancher, an obvious
villain. "Trust is everything" is Big Boy's motto but, nevertheless,
their friendship is at stake.  All of this violent, macho turmoil is
set against Oliver Stapleton's magnificent big sky cinematography and
to the music of Carter Burdwell's evocative score.  It's no wonder
that the late Sam Peckinpah struggled for years to try to get this
picture made. Acting-wise, Harrelson and Crudup are bold and me
morable but Ms. Arquette is, at best, insipid. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Hi-Lo Country" is a simmering 7, a lusty homespun
homage to the traditional Old West of John Ford and Howard Hawks.</P>
