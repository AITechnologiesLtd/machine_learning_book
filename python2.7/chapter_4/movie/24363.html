<PRE>                          I DREAMED OF AFRICA
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Kim Basinger has gone off to Africa on safari, in search of a
follow-up Oscar to the one she landed for L.A. Confidential.  Looks like
she'll be coming home empty-handed, I'm sad to say.</P>
<P>     Drawing comparisons to such Man vs. Nature films as Out of Africa,
A Far Off Place, and The Ghost and the Darkness, I Dreamed of Africa
tells the true story of Kuki Gallmann (Basinger), an Italian divorcee
who upends her life to move to Kenya with her second husband Paolo
(Vincent Gallo), who, ahem, dreams of buying a 100,000 acre cattle ranch
in the middle of nowhere.</P>
<P>     Life in Africa, Kuki finds, is hard.  Though her son Emanuele (Liam
Aiken; later Garrett Strommen) loves it, she has a tough time adapting
to the "different rhythm" of the wilderness -- mainly because that
rhythm involves fighting off elephants, snakes, lions, poachers,
bandits, bad weather, and Kuki's frou-frou mother Franca (Eva Marie
Saint, returning to the big screen).</P>
<P>     Kuki and Family survive one disaster after another -- until the
wilds take their toll, none of which seem to faze anyone very much.
Usually, Kuki will shed a brief tear, make a speech, and then move on
with life.  Two hours of this and the movie is over, and we've borne
witness to a largish chunk of Kuki's existence... but to what end?
Ultimately the movie becomes The Mosquito Coast, only set in Africa and
without an ending.</P>
<P>     I Dreamed of Africa sounds suspiciously like the adaptation of
Kuki's autobiography, which, of course, is what it is.  And as a book
adaptation, the story feels strangely abridged, as if the screenplay is
based on every other page of the book, willy-nilly.  The plot bounces
around without much cohesiveness, and few of the characters are
developed enough to become lovable.  This might all have been redeemed
if Basinger had turned in a tour de force performance, but ultimately
you don't get a real sense of what Kuki is all about.  You don't even
get a sense that Kuki is supposed to be Italian.</P>
<P>     In the end, we learn little more than the fact that Africa is both
beautiful and difficult.  Oddly, just like the movie.</P>
