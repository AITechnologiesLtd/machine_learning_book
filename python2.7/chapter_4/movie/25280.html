<P>Playwright, novelist, short story writer W. Somerset Maugham 
(1874-1965) was in his lifetime as known and as read an 
English-language author as anyone, especially for his short stories. 
Crisp, unfussy writing, a cosmopolitan life,  and sharp observation 
led to a host of movie adaptations --over 50 -- from "Rain" (made 
four times) to "The Razor's Edge" (made twice) to autobiographical 
spy thrillers, to international manners and/or intrigue, to the 
British at home or abroad.</P>
<P>"Abroad", for affluent Americans and for Brits who could afford it, 
more often than not meant "Italy." In 1940 Maugham published the 
novella which this film adapts. That was  during the first year of 
World War II which began in September 1939. The story tells mostly of 
British expatriates in Italy, with a light seasoning of Americans. 
Its background included the Fascist Mussolini regimes. but this 
aspect was attenuated. It is underlined and expanded in the movie 
version which starts after September 1938, that is, after the 
infamous Munich agreements were signed by Hitler, Mussolini, British 
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French PM Edouard Daladier.</P>
<P>There's no more blind a person that the one who does not want to see, 
goes a saying. The depicted English in Italy were among those who, 
whether because of delusion, inertia or stupidity did no return home 
to the British Isles, but instead took Chamberlain's foolish "Peace 
in our time" at face value.</P>
<P>The movie's little colony in and around Florence (where the film was 
shot, as well as partly in Siena), go through their small, effete, 
even stultifying social life.</P>
<P>The picture's center is Mary Panton, about 40. A widow with no 
palpable funds, she is staying at a villa loaned her by friends. Her 
confidente (in some ways) is the colorful, cynical, flamboyant 
doyenne (in rank and fortune) of the colony, also a widow, the 
English Principessa San Ferdinando, played with the gusto that Anne 
Bancroft can command so effortlessly. I am not sure whether the 
Princess is a Brit or an American. Her accent sounds like stage 
English, reinforced by her repeated addressing Mary as "duckey."</P>
<P>The other Brits are by and large pallid, dull types, with the 
exception is Lucky Leadbetter, a gay and indigent artist (Derek 
Jacobi) who is also queenishly flamboyant, but merely on the fringes 
of the local high society. His presence is really not needed in the 
story. It is something of a conundrum. I read Maugham's novella ages 
ago, could not find a copy in a hurry, so that I don't know whether 
this character was in the source text or was added in the script</P>
<P>At one of the regular, society dinners, American newcomer Rowley 
Flint meets Mary. He is a playboy whose wife is not around. It looks 
as if that all spouses,whether dead or alive, were or are negative 
entities. Flint immediately starts his seduction number on Mrs. 
Panton. But, though attracted to him, she is hesitant. Having been 
left fortune-less, she is considering a match with Sir Edward Swift, 
a civil servant who is 25 years older than she, properly proper --in 
fact almost comically so,-- in love with Mary, an old friend forever, 
and a candidate for Governor of Bengal. (It was unclear to me whether 
he is a widower or an old bachelor).</P>
<P>He proposes. She needs a few days to think it over. He leaves for a 
short time -- during which Mary a) rebuffs Flint's advances and b) 
meets again by chance Karl Richter, a young (and overly grungy, 
unkempt and gauche) refugee from Austria. Frustratingly, we never 
learn why he is a refugee? Is he anti-Nazi? Is he a Jew? Why has he 
not a Teutonic accent, even a mild one?</P>
<P>Mary, for reasons unclear and somewhat improbable --libido? pity? a 
passing fancy? -- has sex with the awkward youth in "her" bedroom at 
the beautiful villa. The next day madly amorous Karl shows up, is 
politely informed by Mary that "basta is basta," and it was only a 
one-night stand. His reaction is as unforeseen as it is radical.
Major things happen which now throw Mary into the company of Rowley 
Flint who helps her and.....</P>
<P>This film is heavy on accents and dialogues. The clearest English 
accent belong to Italian performer Massimo Ghini who plays the local 
political top dog, as Secretary of Florence's Fascist Party. He too 
desires Mary, which complicates matters.</P>
<P>The movie loves local Italian color, meaning interiors, architecture 
and nature. It also loves to talk. There is much stress on lovingly 
elaborated Tuscan details--which please the eye but slow down the 
action.</P>
<P>No true three-dimensional characters rise up. The improbable casting 
of Bad Boy Penn as a man of the world, a classy womanizer, is hard to 
swallow,both in part and in whole. If you reflect on the fact that 
Penn's was once married to Madonna, his sophistication becomes even 
less likely.  The electricity between him and Scott Thomas is about 
like that of two AAA batteries.</P>
<P>Ms. Scott Thomas is not particularly appealing in any sense of the 
word. What a pity! After the full or part failure of her last two 
films ("Random Hearts" and "The Horse Whisperer") she deserved a 
better role. She is a very special case. Her filmography is far 
larger than most viewers suspect, but it is also obscure, in that the 
majority of her films (mostly European) have not been released in the 
USA. I first saw her in the Rumanian "An Unforgettable Summer" (1994, 
by Lucian Pintillie), a gem where she gives a four-star performance. 
Get it if you can. Or else the interesting "Angels and Insects" 
(1995) by the same husband and wife team that made "Up at the Villa."
