"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>If movies about slapping inebriated mules is something that gets you
off, then have I got a film for you.  I don't think the
drunk-mule-abusing demographic is too hot on films from Iran, which is a
shame because A Time for Drunken Horses is really a great film.</P>
<P>Horses is set in an Iranian village near the Iraqi border.  Because of
the ongoing conflicts between the two countries, the snowy area is
littered with landmines, making passage extremely difficult.  This is
bad news for the Iranians who make their living smuggling goods to Iraq
via pack mule.  These smugglers give their mule alcohol, based on how
low the temperature is supposed to be.</P>
<P>Horses focuses on a family of five orphaned Kurdish children who have
lost their mother during childbirth and their father in a landmine
explosion.  The oldest children, Ayoub (Ayoub Ahmadi) and Rojin (Rojin
Younessi), have quickly assumed the roles of mother and father and
feverishly try to keep the younger kids healthy and happy.  They do a
good job, but 15-year-old Madi (Madi Ekhtiar-dini) is crippled and
requires pills and injections on a regular basis.  Madi also needs an
operation or he'll die.</P>
<P>Horses is partially narrated by Madi's younger sister, Amaneh (Amaneh
Ekhtiar-dini), who helps out however she can – whether it's wrapping
glasses in newspaper for strangers or helping brother Ayoub load their
mule with supplies to smuggle over the border.  The film has a great
opening scene, where Amaneh is asked a series of questions that help to
develop all of Horses' characters.</P>
<P>The film follows the struggles of the family to keep Madi in good
spirits while they try to find money for his surgery.  The children in
the film, who are all non-professional actors from the village Horses
was filmed in, all do an amazing job at making your heart break when you
watch their futile efforts bear little fruit.  Horses goes out of its
way to show that people and horses are in pretty much the same boat.
Actually, the horses get liquor, so they actually might be better off.</P>
<P>Horses is the directorial debut of Bahman Ghobadi, and the film won him
the Golden Camera Award (for best first feature) at the Cannes Film
Festival.  Those of you familiar with Iranian cinema may recognize
Ghobadi as the ditch-digger (and second unit director) in Abbas
Kiarostami's The Wind Will Carry Us.  Those of you really familiar with
Iranian cinema won't recognize him because the ditch-digger was never
actually seen in The Wind.</P>
<P>1:20 – Not Rated but contains men slapping drunken horses</P>
