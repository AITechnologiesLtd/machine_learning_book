<PRE>"Town & Country" </PRE>
<P>Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn and Gary Shandling star as a pair 
of married couples whose complacent lives are about to be shaken up in 
director Peter Chelsom's version of the classic romantic, screwball comedy 
in "Town & Country." </P>
<P>The drawing room farce of the 30's dealt with sexual innuendo and relied on 
wit and a great deal of commotion and noise to place the viewer in the 
thick of the duplicitous romantic action. Back then, impossibly wealthy 
scions of society, with too much free time, would get themselves wrapped up 
in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers, only to have 
everything come out all right in the end - see "The Philadelphia Story" for 
a great farce. "Town & Country" has the impossibly wealthy protagonists 
with too much free time - the kind of people that have jobs but never seem 
to work - and sexual misconduct on several levels. But, there is almost no 
life to original script by Michael Laughlin and Buck Henry and this is 
"T&C's" downfall. </P>
<P>There is, obviously, a great deal of Hollywood talent, in front of and 
behind the camera, involved in "Town & Country," but, without a likable or, 
at least, interesting story to carry through their efforts, it is all for 
naught. And, that's what we get here - naught. </P>
<P>Porter Stoddard (Beatty) is a high-powered New York architect with a very 
good life indeed. His 25-year marriage to Ellie (Diane Keaton) appears, on 
the surface, to be perfect. But, there are cracks just below this pristine 
surface. His wife is suspicious of his whereabouts, his kids don't need him 
and his best friends, Griffin (Garry Shandling) and Mona (Goldie Hawn), are 
in the midst of a divorce. Porter tries to get control of his life before 
it is too late, but like a man fighting against quicksand, his struggle 
just sinks him deeper. </P>
<P>At the 90-minute mark of "Town & Country" I asked myself, "What's the 
point?" I wasn't entertained, I laughed three times - over silly little 
pratfalls - and spent most of the film marking time 'til the end. Warren 
Beatty wanders around with his character in a bewildered fog, making 
problems for himself by thinking with a part of his anatomy other than his 
head. Keaton's Ellie is an empty headed flake who can't see the obvious as 
Porter screws around on her. And, as you get to know them, who would want 
friends like Griffin and Mona? </P>
<P>The supporting cast is given nothing to do and, sometimes, does harm to the 
film, given the material they are forced to use.  Nastassja Kinski plays a 
cellist with whom Porter has a fling. The actress, who has, eerily, failed 
to age over the years, is miscast as the air-headed musician and the 
character doesn't belong, anyway. Jenna Elfman is a sweet, but smart, ditz 
who joins Porter and Griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures. Andie 
MacDowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress (is there any 
other kind in this movie?) who comes on to Porter.  The saving grace is a 
pair of quirky perf's by Charlton Heston and Marian Seldes as MacDowell's 
very strange parents. </P>
<P>Glib rationalization of infidelity, like, "If he doesn't speak English, it 
doesn't count," are a staple for the screenplay. The morality of the film 
seems to be, if you can get away with it, go for it. The cast of characters 
are mostly people you wouldn't want to know, never mind befriend. The 
actors do their best, but are hamstrung by the weak material. Helmer 
Chelsom, who made the outstanding, offbeat comedy "Funny Bones," is mired 
in the mess of a script and never puts his imprint on "Town & Country." </P>
<P>The production values are high, as one expects from a big budget Hollywood 
film. But, the opulent sets by Caroline Hanania, lavish wardrobes by Molly 
Maginnis and top-notch photography by William Fraker cannot save "Town & 
Country." The film has had a long list of production and distribution 
problems and it might have been better, for me anyway, if Hollywood just 
said no to this movie. I give it a D. </P>
