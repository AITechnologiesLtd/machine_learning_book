A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Edward Zwick</PRE>
<P>Written by: Edward Zwick, Lawrence Wright, and Menno Meyjes</P>
<P>Starring: Denzel Washington, Tony Shalhoub , Annette Bening, Bruce
Willis </P>
<P>Ingredients: FBI lawman, terrorism, US Constitution issues</P>
<P>Synopsis:
An honest and upright FBI lawman named Hub (Denzel Washington) is in
charge of fighting Middle Eastern terrorists bombing New York. But Hub
loses his authority when the President allows a power hungry US Army
general (Bruce Willis) to declare martial law over the city in response
to escalated bombings. The general abuses his powers. With the help of
his partner Frank (Tony Shalhoub) as well as a CIA agent named Sharon
(Annette Bening), Hub continues his investigations in a bid to solve the
bombings and regain his rightful authority. </P>
<P>Opinion:
After watching this movie, I found an orange paper on the front
windshield of my car, on which was printed: "The stereotyping of Muslims
as terrorists ... leads to prejudice, hate, and bigotry."  Good point.
THE SIEGE plays suspenseful, sinister music during Muslim prayer, and
has bad guys perform a Muslim ritual prior to putting on white shrouds
and running amok trying to bomb innocent city folk. </P>
<P>THE SIEGE tries to entertain us on a number of different levels, and
succeeds in one. As a drama about the plight of innocent Americans being
put in concentration camps, THE SEIGE doesn't develop much sympathy for
the victims because none of the victims are main characters. For
example, when a character shouts, "I must get my son out of the
concentration camp," it comes as a relatively emotionless surprise
because we don't even know his son. It would have been more dramatic if
the movie had thoroughly introduced us to the son, so that the audience
could bond and feel for the family's plight on a sympathetic level.
Similarly, when Hub yells at the general about the inhumane treatment of
Tariq, who is Tariq? A vicious terrorist? Or an innocent patsy fingered
by the real villain? Tariq's identity hasn't been developed, nor do we
know by the end of the film. He's just some unfortunate stranger. If
you're going to do a film about injustice, then "victim" parts should be
allowed to develop emotional "tug," rather than just provide surprise
material for Hub's power struggle with the army. </P>
<P>On the intellectual level, THE SEIGE leaves a few things murky. Annette
Bening gets a huge part as Sharon, the CIA's sole expert. But it's not
clear whether Sharon is acting alone or on behalf of the CIA's present
goal, which is not explained either. In one scene, CIA Sharon acts as an
Army translator, so what's her actual mission?  In the movie there is
also a lot of wrangling back and forth about the fate of a mysterious
shake (sheik). But the discussion peters out, and we never get to see
the sheik. </P>
<P>On the good side, the acting is done well, and there are a few scenes
with some chasing around and or featuring fancy spy hardware. As a drama
about Hub's authority struggle with the army, THE SEIGE does okay.</P>
