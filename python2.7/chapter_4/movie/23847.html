<P>   If you've ever held a job with a large company, private or
public, you can testify to this: if your boss screws up, guess
who will bear the onus?  Your supervisor will hang you out to
dry.  You accept the censure: your overseer gets off the
hook.  In "Rules of Engagement," director William Friedkin,
using Stephen Gaghan's adaptation of a story by a former
Secretary of the Navy (and Marine infantry commander)
James Webb, takes this concept writ large.  If the United
States is about to go down for an alleged screw-up
somewhere in the world, the United States will try to pin the
blame on an individual.  Perhaps Lt. Calley's situation in My
Lai is the not the best example, but when that officer gunned
down unarmed civilians in Viet Nam, the lieutenant and not
the United States government was to be be held up to
rebuke.</P>
<P>   "Rules of Engagement" depicts a situation similar to that in
My Lai, however, except that in this circumstance, the
commanding officer who issues an order to gun down a
group of civilians in Yemen is justified.  Friedkin takes us
inside the Yemeni capital of S'ana (actually
filmed in Ouazazarte in southern Morocco) to show us a
fierce demonstration by about two hundred civilians plus
several rooftop snipers determined to gut the American
embassy and kill all personnel found therein.  The kicker is
that most of the Arab civilians, including at least one nine-
year-old girl and several black-robed women, are firing pistols
and automatic weapons in addition to flinging stones and
Molotov cocktails on what is sovereign United States territory
in that small country on the Saudi tip.  When Marine Col.
Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), seeing some of his
fellow Marines killed by the bullets while the others troops in
his company are observing the snipers and not the crowd
below, he gives the order to "waste the m-f's."  The entire
group of demonstrators are hit by Marine bullets resulting in
83 dead and about 100 critical injuries.  Determined to get
the U.S. government off the hook by disavowing the action
and blaming an overzealous career military officer, National
Security Adviser William Sokal (Bruce Greenwood) arranges
to court-martial Childers and assigns Major Mark Biggs (Guy
Pearce) to prosecute the case.</P>
<P>   The final part of the movie involves the trial of Col.
Childers, who is defended by the accused's old wartime
buddy Col. Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), with whom he
fought side by side thirty years previously in Viet Nam.  Much
is made of Hodges's inexperience as a lawyer--that he has
had a long-standing drinking problem, that he graduated
sixty-seventh in his class at Georgetown Law, and that he is
divorced.  But while given the sort of movie that this is we
may expect even an inept attorney to clear Childers despite
the lawyer's ineptitude, Gaghan's script subverts the
presumption and allows Hodges to mount a fiery defense.</P>
<P>   In this high-budget, slickly commercial movie, Friedkin
keeps the pace moving at a swift pace, becoming frenetic in
scenes involving battle.  The Moroccan extras performing as
Yeminis on a jihad against America are so fired up by their
role in storming the embassy that we don't wonder at the
ease with which the fundamentalists in the Arab world are
able to pitch fervor into the hearts of their recruits.  The
stones fly wildly, battering the shabby structure of the
embassy as though flung from battering rams determined to
bring down a Scottish castle.  We almost expect a Marine
guard inside the embassy to call out, "Hang out our banners
on the outward walls;/ Our castle's strength/ Will laugh a
siege to scorn."  Some of the Viet Nam battle scenes that
open the movie are taut, realistic, and could have been
directed with pride even by Oliver Stone.  While the colonels,
Hodges and Childers, are not developed characters, they
need not be.  All we need to know is that they were Marine
buddies who fought side by side, dependent on each other
for their very lives, to see the depths to which Hodges would
go in defending the highly decorated and now beleaguered
soldier.</P>
<P>   Once again, the U.S. government is portrayed as the bad
guys.  As National Security Adviser William Sokal, Bruce
Greenwood comes across as the epitome of evil, his bland
and mellifluous voice signalling us that this is the sort of con
artist we must all watch out for.  Guy Pearce is a strange
choice for prosecutor though.  With hair closely cropped even
for a military officer, Pearce has lost any trace of his native
accent and substitutes a strange brogue that combines a
Brooklyn dialect with New England vernacular.  Putting aside
the saintly roles to which he is accustomed, Ben Kingsley
makes the perfect cowering ambassador, a high official who--
together with his iniquitous wive (Anne Archer)--suddenly
forgets the debt he owes to the heroic Childers for getting
him out of Yemen alive when his career is spuriously
threatened by Adviser Sokal.</P>
<P>  "Rules of Engagement" may be a feel good movie that lacks
the imaginative thrusts of David O. Russell's "The Three
Kings," but for what it is this is one of the better examples.  =</P>
<P>William Friedkin directs us to a man who successfully stands
up to the heinous machinations of a U.S. eager to cover its
own rear.  What lies open to future judgment, though, is the
danger faced by our government as a result of this court
martial.  Does the U.S. risk even greater militancy from the
fundamentalists in the Middle East?  Even more crucial, can
America prevent the withering of its support among the
moderate states of the area, including Egypt, Morocco and
even Turkey?  These are not questions that the typical movie
fan is going to bother with.  "Rules of Engagement" is, after
all, a rah-rah film whose cinematography makes up for its
domestic drabness in Washington scenes with a ravishing
array of North African colors, and supplies us with
two heroes who fight against the odds to make a crucial
point: if you're not under combat, do not assume that you can
always find a diplomatic solution when unreasonable people,
powered by fanatical beliefs, are determined to do you in.</P>
