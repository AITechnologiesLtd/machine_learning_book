<P>PLOT:
A bunch of guys make a bet that would score the last remaining bachelor
among them a pile of money. When one of the buddies falls into a large debt,
he tries to get his last friend married, so that he could win the loot.
Hilarity ensues?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
The funniest scene in this movie involves a man chasing a testicle down
hospital hallways...'nuff said! I personally thought that was a funny
sequence, but unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't attain that level
of "high-brow" humor, with flat jokes for the most part, lame sketch pieces
and plot holes the size of my big ass!! Okay, okay, so we don't exactly go
to see these movies for the story lines...that's a given. So what about the
T&A, you might ask? Nada! What the hell's up with teen T&A flicks nowadays,
when the only asses we get to see are those of Jerry O'Connell and not
Shannon Elizabeth?! C'mon people...I get enough teasing in my personal life,
when I go to see these kinds of movies, I wanna git what's coming to me, for
God's sakes!! Alright, alright...I'm gonna calm down now. Harumph, okay back
to the movie. Basically, this film is exactly what you'd expect: stupid,
mindless and at very few times, funny. Unfortunately, most of the film is
lame, with idiotic scenes of guys jerking off in sperm banks, a sweet
librarian turning into a S&M mistress (a scene that went on for waaaay too
long) and unrelated parody scenes of MI2 and AMERICAN BEAUTY.</P>
<P>And don't bother trying to make sense out of the story, since the filmmakers
are more interested in showcasing over-the-top sexual situations which go
nowhere, than filling out the gaping holes in the plot line. I mean, they
actually try and build up Shannon Elizabeth's character at one point, only
to have her disappear for about twenty minutes midway through the film. What
the &*#@? Anyway, I might still recommend this sucker extremely reluctantly,
but only on video, and even then, only if someone else pays for it, and even
then, only if you're drunk! At that point, I think you might enjoy the movie
for what it is. Admittedly, I did dig Garry Marshall's small but funny cameo
appearance, the energetic opening credits and the outtakes during the
credits, which were actually funny for once. And no matter how much I tried,
I couldn't help but see the actual fun that Jerry O'Connell was having in
this role, and I guess that's gotta count for something, right? Uhhhmmm,
then again, it's your money you'd be wasting on this dog, so maybe not. So a
quick recap says that there is no actual T or A in this movie, practically
no big laughs, a lame story line and lotsa cleavage? I don't know, this
movie doesn't try real hard to be much, so I guess maybe I shouldn't try so
hard to dissect it so much.</P>
<P>So let's end it on this note: are you ready to spend your hard-earned cash
on a film whose high point involves a testicle chase? Well, if your response
is a big hearty "yes", then this movie is made for you. If not, skip it and
go jerk off instead...you'll feel a whole better, trust me! BTW, what the
hell was Bill Maher doing in this thing?? Ugh.</P>
