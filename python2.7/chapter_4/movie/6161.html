<PRE>The Trap (1966) 106m. </PRE>
<P>There are at least half a dozen other films with this title, but this
is the one in which Canadian trapper Oliver Reed shows up in town with
a mind to take a wife back to his log cabin in the mountain
wilderness.  He buys mute Rita Tushingham for a thousand dollars, and
the expected scenes of conflict and resolution ensue.  Film's premise
relies heavily on the convention that the audience must witness - and
indeed, expect - change in the two lead characters in order to make
the story worthwhile (Personally, I'm not that worried by films which
refuse to change or develop their protagonists).  Reed, playing
against a character who is mute, seems to make it his duty to act
enough for the both of them, stamping through the scenery and barking
in a nearly unfathomable accent.  It's a very cartoony performance -
by the film's end he virtually becomes Pegleg Pete - but it's obvious
he's playing it broadly to give Tushingham ample material to react to.</P>
<P>Reed doesn't see Tushingham's muteness as a handicap, just as he fails
to recognize any other quality in her besides the immediacy of her
companionship.  The bearlike Reed understands only nature, red in
tooth and claw.  His business and existence revolve around the
hunting, trapping, and killing of animals:  he is the king of the
mountain, and all others, including Tushingham (who he refers to as
`rabbit') are subservient to him.  It's not surprising that his
surname is La Bete (`The Beast'), and indeed many parallels to the
story and situation of `Beauty and the Beast' can be drawn.  The
isolated wilderness might well be the far-off mysterious forests of
any fairy tale.  But they are the `trap' of the title, along with the
`marriage', the snowbound cabin, the inhibitions of the characters,
and of course the ever-present animal traps Reed carries with him.  It
is Tushingham that makes the more significant escape from these traps,
but I don't believe her newly-developed independence or
self-sufficiency are as important as her action to make a lifestyle
choice of her own.  By the film's conclusion it is not so much her
decision as her confidence that matters.</P>
<P>Pace of film doesn't flag and manages many dramatic moments for a
two-character piece.  The exciting (though improbable) scene where
Reed is being stalked by wolves could easily have been lifted from a
horror movie - this isn't wholly unexpected considering  Sidney Hayers
was director.  Composer Ron Goodwin cites this score as being his most
popular with concert audiences (how could it beat out 633 SQUADRON?). 
Reed would end up in a very similar situation twenty years later,
partnered with the considerably less inhibited Amanda Donohoe in
Nicolas Roeg's CASTAWAY. </P>
