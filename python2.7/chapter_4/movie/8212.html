<P>Unstrung Heroes
Chad'z rating: *** (out of 4 = good)
1995, PG, 93 minutes [1 hour, 33 minutes]
[lighthearted drama/comedy]
Starring: Nathan Watt (Steven/Franz Lidz), John Turturro (Sidney Lidz), Andie
McDowell (Selma Lidz), Michael Richards (Uncle Danny), Maury Chaykin (Uncle
Arthur), produced by Susan Arnold, Donna Roth, Bill Badalato, written by
Richard LaGravenese, directed by Diane Keaton, based on the novel by Franz
Lidz.</P>
<P>"Unstrung Heroes" is another one of those coming-of-age films that are
intended to touch your heart and make you feel good, and films does that
without becoming sappy or contrived (well... maybe a little bit). It's a
interesting story about characters we don't usually get to see, yet they seem
very recognizable.</P>
<P>Everyone thinks their family is strange, but Steven Lidz (Watt) may actually
have the claim to that fame. His father, Sidney (Turturro), is a strange
inventor who believes science can solve any problem. His mother, Selma
(McDowell), is a beautiful, chain-smoking housewife who is slowly dying of
cancer. But these elements are not played upon too heavily, which allows us
to get closer to the characters without being distracted by the tense
situation and their basic eccentricity.</P>
<P>Steven's uncles are even more bizarre than his immediate family. Uncle Danny
(Richards) believes someone is constantly following him, especially
anti-Semites. There is also Uncle Arthur (Chaykin) who lives with Danny and
is just as strange because he has the mindset of a child. He is amused by
simple things such as balls, old newspapers, and garbage. He's a fascinating
character because of his sense of innocence.</P>
<P>Steven ends up staying a summer with his two uncles because his home has
become such a cold place. He has no bond with his father, and he cannot see
his mother because of her condition. He learns about the outside world
through his uncles, who don't even live in the "real world" themselves. He
accepts their strangeness as truth since it seems to make more sense than the
complicated, scientific rhetoric his father constantly spews. </P>
<P>There is also a sub-plot involving a philosophical battle of faith versus
science. Steven starts to learn about his Jewish roots, as he was denied them
by his atheist father. He is renamed Franz and refuses to go by his old name.</P>
<P>I'm not really sure who the "unstrung heroes" of this movie are supposed to
be. Maybe the uncles because of their innocence, or perhaps Steven/Franz
because of his exposure to so many different aspects of life. Maybe even Mr.
and Mrs. Lidz who love Steven and care for him, but just don't know how to
express their love. </P>
<P>Although there isn't much to "Unstrung Heroes," thankfully, it doesn't make
the mistake of becoming too sappy like most other stories of the sort. It's
want you're looking for in a disposable drama - but I'm not sure if that's
good or bad.</P>
