<PRE>The Opposite of Sex (1998, R)</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by Don Roos (Single White Female)</P>
<P>Starring Cristiana Ricci (The Adams Family), Martin Donovan (The Portrait of
a Lady), Lisa Kudrow (Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion), Lyle Lovett
(Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas), Ivan Sergei (John Woo's Once a Thief)</P>
<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Deedee Truitt (Ricci) is a narcissist. She's a sex-addicted, nyphomanical
user and abuser. She's blaring, she offensive, she's witty, she's brilliant.
She packs a gun while pregnant and swears every other word. And, like all
anti-heroes, you love her by the end of the movie.</P>
<P>She's not going to grow a heart of gold (or so she says) and she's not going
to change her ways. She goes around stealing ashes from urns, seducing gay
men, running off with one-balled hicks from Louisiana, and basically living
her life without consequences. Then, of course, she gets pregnant and
reality begins to set in quickly.</P>
<P>Basically, her realization of reality comes around basically like this:</P>
<P>1) Stepfather dies. She leaves Louisiana with Randy, the one-balled hick,
and keeps on running to Illinois, where she holes up with her homosexual
half-brother and his lover, Matt. Matt and the half-brother are locked in a
relationship based upon sex, which Matt readily admits but the half brother
will not (his previous boyfriend died of AIDS).</P>
<P>2) Deedee seduces Matt. In a crazy world where anything can happen, anything
does, with her working her unique charms to bed a homosexual.</P>
<PRE>3) Deedee gets pregnant. She splits.</PRE>
<P>What follows is a politically incorrect story of her learning that life
isn't so easy. It's a wake up call: a rude one. The movie, for liberals like
me, is both riotously funny and blatantly offensive. But in the strange
world of film it was just the dark comedy I was looking for.
It offers an insight that no politically correct movie can. It doesn't worry
about what you think about her, or what you think about it. This, as anyone
who reads my reviews knows, constitutes my very favorite thing: ARTISTIC
BOLDNESS.</P>
<P>Yes. A movie this flagrantly offensive is not only art but quite intelligent
art at that. Instead of worrying, like everyone else does, about wording
their answers to the questions of life in a kind way, The Opposite of Sex
doesn't care.</P>
<P>The strange thing is, by the end of the movie, you will.</P>
