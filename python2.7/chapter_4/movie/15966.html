<PRE>WHAT DREAMS MAY COME (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Vincent Ward
Writer: Ronald Bass (based on the novel by Richard Matheson)
Starring: Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra, Cuba Gooding Jr., Max von
Sydow, Rosalind Chao, Josh Paddock, Jessica Brooks, Werner Herzog</P>
<P>Watching "What Dreams May Come" is really one of the more bizarre
evenings (or, in my case, afternoons) I've had at the movies in quite
some time, and I mean that positively.  It's unlike any big budget
mainstream I've seen since "Dark City," and while they share the same
brilliance in artistic and technical design, they also share a true
hypnotism: sitting back and really taking everything this film has to
offer in is like getting totally lost in a movie, and any real short
comings, the amount of which may be the real difference between these
two films, are easy to ignore until afterwards, the best time for
problems to surface anyway.</P>
<P>The protagonist, Chris Nielsen, is played by none other than Robin
Williams, the actor who has made an entire career out of playing
bigger-than-life characters in bizarre fantasy worlds.  This time, in
what seems to be his current attempt to be taken more seriously as an
actor (and by god we do, Robin), he plays it straight, as the entire
story is a serious bit of pondering on what may happen after one dies.
But the film is not necessarily about death, and when it begins, it's
about Chris meeting his soon-to-be-wife in a Meet-Cute scene that turns
into a joyfully happy marriage.</P>
<P>Although Chris and his wife, Annie (Annabella Sciorra), are happy and
have two kids (John Paddock and Jessica Brooks), they are soon struck
with tragedy when their kids are killed in a car accident.  This sends
Annie into a mental institution and somehow, Chris gets her out of it,
nurses her back, and gets her into painting as a form of therapy...then
he dies in a car accident.</P>
<P>The rest of the film, following this short exposition, is mostly
following Chris as he learns more and more about what happens after one
dies, like how we get our own heaven in which all of our desires come
true.  Personally, Chris ends up in one of Annie's paintings, a gorgeous
landscape of where they first met, which at first is actually made up of
acryllic paints, so when, for example, he picks up a flower from the
ground and crushes it, it turns into acryllic right in his hands.  As he
learns more, it turns into a real landscape, and he soon learns all the
other major perks of being dead: you can fly, you can breathe under
water, and everything you wish is at your command, more or less.  In
other words, it's like a much more controlled and more stable acid
trip.  Glad to know I have something to look forward to.</P>
<P>Along for the ride is Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), the Virgil to Chris'
Dante.  More or less, he explains things for him, though not everything
and usually after he's already discovered things.  And while he hangs
with them and another Oriental woman, Leona (Rosalind Chao), who takes
him to another heaven for a special emotional meeting, Annie is
meanwhile suffering emotional breakdown, but still desperately trying to
hang on.  Although Chris is able to communicate with her partially
before he ascends to his own heaven, it only destroys her more.  By the
mid-point, she has committed suicide, and has not wound up in heaven but
in hell, which is reserved not for the morally wicked but for those
who've committed the greatest sin: not being able to forgive one's self.</P>
<P>Chris ends up deciding to travel to hell to go find her, with the help
of a mysterious man dubbed The Tracker (and played by the great Max Von
Sydow, who with this, "The Seventh Seal," and "The Exorcist" - not to
mention "Needful Things" where he played Satan himself - has fully shown
he's a master of death, or something like that).  This may sound like a
typical Hollywood film from this point on, kinda like "Ghost" with
unstubtle Orpheus undertones (all Chris needs is a harp), but strangely
enough, this just seems to nicely blend with everything else as a
magical excursion to a foreign land never tred in other movies.</P>
<P>Visually, "What Dreams May Come" is outstanding, and is undoubtedly the
recipient of a nice Oscar nomination for Art Direction (too bad this and
"Dark City" had to come out in the same year).  The image of Chris'
heaven is like living inside components of Renaissance paintings, the
land of Myst, Angel memorablia, and Hallmark Greeting Cards.  Hell is
equally magestic, filled with an entrance that is as fiery and
frightening as we all imagined it would be (like the use of a lake to
surround the entrance to hell, as well as the use of Cerberus), while
the main part is instead a sea of faces buried into the ground, a sight
that is breathtaking and unnerrving.</P>
<P>This is all well and good, and luckily the rest of the movie is
wonderful as well.  The film, though obviously designed into a
traditional three act format, actually flows together quite nicely.
Each large sequence is like a mini-masterpiece unto itself of bizarro
introductions and amazing sights, and there doesn't seem to be any
filler.  This makes for a film that just pulls us right into the moment,
and works us over so much with bringing a brand new vision of the
afterlife to us that we damn near forget about plot advancement.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, "What Dreams May Come" has come under some serious
admonishment from other critics, who have been blasting it for its new
age thinking, such as how we can control everything in our lives and our
after-lives if we only concentrate.  While some of this is true, it's
sadly enough superfluous to the entirety of the film.  The point of this
film is not to invoke this kind of thinking onto you, unless you're so
anal that you actually pay attention to some of Albert's perplexing
explanations (did you really understand all that?), but to really take
us on a journey that's a treat to the senses, and later on the emotions.</P>
<P>I will say that it does have its share of problems, though, especially
in the emotion department.  For most of the film, it's a pretty
emotional experience, what with everyone in the family being dead, and
Annie left to rot out her existence, feeling unfairly guilty that she
didn't drive her kids to school the day they died and make Chris do an
errand the day he did.  In the early scenes, we really do feel a sense
of love between Chris and Annie, and some of the jokes they tell aren't
so much funny as they are sweetly romantic.  And when Chris announces he
will go get her from hell, it really has justified that decision, and
we're right along with him the whole way.</P>
<P>In the finale, it does get in a bit of snag, coming up with an ending
which is way too easy and chipper for a film that is so hypnotic and
complex up until that point.  With Chris seeing Annie, who doesn't
recognize him at all, and desperately trying to get her to get over the
distraught she has put herself in, it perhaps couldn't have come up with
an ending that was either very satisfying or very logical (I will give
it this, though: at least it didn't have Chris telling her "It's not
your fault.  It's not your fault.  It's not you fault," etc. etc.
etc.).  It's as if it pulls us right up to the crevice, turns right
around, and walks in the opposite direction.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, "What Dreams May Come" is a substantial success.  Its
power is that it hooks us in to its story emotionally and
psychologically, and pleases all of our senses with imagery and scenes
that are not to be believed.  Maybe it's because of the technical
reasons that I'm really recommending this, but at least I'm not stupid
enough to take into any major consideration the new age thinking that it
partially touches upon.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
