<P>     Several days after having seen this movie, I'm still trying to 
determine what director Christopher Guest, a man whose sense of humor I 
usually appreciate, found funny in either the concept or the execution 
of ALMOST HEROES.  This is a dreadful motion picture – a lowbrow example 
of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an 
exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio.  There's a kind of desperation 
in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' 
uncertainty about how entertaining the material is; the manic style 
betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed 
script.</P>
<P>     The premise doesn't sound especially amusing to begin with – ALMOST 
HEROES tells the tale of two explorers, the effeminate Leslie Edwards 
(Matthew Perry) and the uncouth Bartholomew Hunt (Chris Farley), who are 
racing Lewis and Clark on the trip to the American Northwest.  Edwards 
and Hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies 
(albeit of the early-19th century variety), including a Frenchman named 
Guy Fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages (none of which 
prove to be useful), a pretty Indian maiden who turns into the 
obligatory love interest, and a bizarre man who suffers a series of 
debilitating injuries.  Along the way, the intrepid explorers encounter 
bears, bald eagles, aging Native American warriors, and a conquistador 
named Hildago (Kevin Dunn) who raves about his beautiful hair.  The 
explorers' trek takes them through forests, across the snow-capped Rocky 
Mountains, and over a waterfall.  </P>
<P>     This setup leads to a lot of shouting, a great deal of lunacy, and 
very few laughs.  Farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and 
bellowing, but, aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with 
an eagle, his heart doesn't seem to be in it.  Matthew Perry, one of the 
stars of TV's FRIENDS (who had some modest success in the romantic 
comedy, FOOLS RUSH IN) is badly miscast.  As a foil for Farley and an 
antidote to his runaway energy, Perry lacks the necessary edge of the 
proverbial straight man.  I'm not a big fan of David Spade, and I didn't 
like TOMMY BOY, but at least he and Farley worked well together.  As far 
as the supporting players go, none of them makes more than a fleeting 
impression.  Eugene Levy is wasted, and Kevin Dunn is about as 
interesting here as he is in GODZILLA.</P>
<P>     Frankly, it's a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly 
come from Christopher Guest, the brilliant comic force behind such films 
as THIS IS SPINAL TAP, THE BIG PICTURE, and WAITING FOR GUFFMAN.  
Although Guest gets the costumes right, this nearly-inconsequential 
success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution.  The 
special effects, such as they are, are execrable.  For an example of 
some really poor blue screen work, look at the scenes where the 
characters are shooting the rapids (they're obviously getting buckets of 
water thrown on them) and where Farley is being carried off by an eagle.</P>
<P>     Even though Farley didn't have the most stellar of acting careers, 
he doesn't deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by ALMOST 
HEROES.  While some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a 
few guffaws from 12-year old boys, the level of comedy in ALMOST HEROES 
falls far below the level of sophomoric.  Farley fans who see this film 
as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty, since it 
takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this 
cinematic torture session.</P>
