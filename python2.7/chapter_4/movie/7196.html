<PRE>                             THE DEVIL'S OWN
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>Catholic Northern and Protestant Southern Ireland have been engaged in
a monstrous killing civil war for longer than one can remember. (Some
800 years!)  Northern Ireland wants to be separated from England but
the latter is not about to allow that and so have supplied troops to
quell the guerrilla warfare in which the North is engaged.  It is
difficult to reconcile that both antagonists are Christians and yet
hate each other to the point where they kill without qualms.  Frankie
McGuire (Brad Pitt) is a Northerner responsible for the death of many
British soldiers as well as Irish citizens. How the British would love
to capture him!  Frankie's whole life has been devoted to killing as
many of the enemy as he can.  As a youngster, he saw his father shot
to death at the dinner table just as he had finished saying Grace.</P>
<P>Back in New York City lives Tom O'Meara, an honest, dedicated cop
whose mission in life is to make  New York City a peaceful place and
who believes he himself must practice peace in order to live up to his
credo.  When someone recommends that he take in as a boarder a young
newly-arrived Irish immigrant he does not hesitate nor does he inquire
about his background. .  . The young man is Frankie who has taken on a
new name, Rory Devaney.  He is in NYC to get money from supporters so
that he can buy bigger and better weapons to smuggle back to Northern
Ireland.</P>
<P>Tom and Rory hit it off immediately.  Tom has never had a son, only
daughters: Bridget, Morgan and Annie (Julia Stiles, Ashley Carin and
Kelly Singer.)  Sheila (Margaret Colin) is his lovely wife;  Edwin
Diaz (Ruben Blades) is his sidekick and chauffeur in the police car..
Billy Burke, (Treat Williams) is a vicious arms dealer.</P>
<P>When Tom's home is invaded by masked gunmen, where he and his wife
seemed about to be killed, the gunmen suddenly leave.  Tom, looking
over the torn upholstery, the open drawers, realizes the invasion was
because someone was searching for something. . . and he discovers the
something is money in a bag belonging to Rory.  He now realizes Rory is
not who he thought and a confrontation takes place.</P>
<P>The film is a dandy thriller.  What I did not like is that it takes
sides rather than letting the movie speak for itself.  I am reminded
of the excellent BATTLE OF ALGIERS, with the Algerians trying to drive
out their French imperialists.  When the leader of the guerrillas is
caught, he turns out to be a cultured person.  "How," he is asked,
"could you let women carry bags with bombs into theaters, dance halls,
ice cream parlors?"  To which he replies, "If we had your planes, your
bombs, your army and navy and tanks, we would not be using ladies,
either."  That is what this film fails to show and that is its
weakness..</P>
