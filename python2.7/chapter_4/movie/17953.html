<P>PLOT:
A bunch of GenX kids hang around a convenience shop for the night, while
they await the return of their friend from the past, who is now a big-time
drummer for a popular band on MTV. They talk, talk some more, and then talk
some more.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Originally a play by Eric Bogosian, I could see how this idea might've
worked in the theatre, but on the big screen, it does little more than
perpetuate the ill-founded theory that most kids of our generation are
without direction, plagued with problems, and most importantly, boring and
self-important. The dialogue in this movie was pretty good and believable,
and Giovanni Ribisi sure comes out of it smelling like a solid acting rose,
but the rest of the cast was so-so and unsympathetic, the set seemed too
clean and contrived for the circumstances, and the plot, far from
compelling. I also hate films that don't "close themselves up" real well,
and this one decided to take that ol' "you figure out what might've happened
to these characters" approach. Listen pal, I just invested two hours of my
time into these cheesy characters, so the least that you could do it give me
a decent payoff! Didn't happen. Anyway, I hope to God people don't see this
movie and imagine our generation to be this lame and annoying (Could the
"fly-girl" Sooze with the earrings all over herself have been any more
irritating?!!?). All in all, a generic dialogue-intensive film with no plot,
uninteresting characters (save for Ribisi) and an open ending.</P>
<P>One saving grace: Giovanni Ribisi shows the whole world what his ding-dong
looks like. Congratulations Giova, you've officially been knighted
Keitel-Jr.  :)</P>
