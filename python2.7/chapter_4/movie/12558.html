<PRE>Saw "He Got Game" - the Spike Lee movie. It didn't quite work
for me. </PRE>
<P>I'm afraid Spike can do comedy ten times better than evoking
sympathy or tears. It certainly wasn't better than "Hoop 
Dreams." A pity considering how much potential his story-line
had -- the father (Jake Shuttlesworth) of the nation's top 
basketball prospect is given a secret furlow from Attica, so 
he can convince his son (Jesus Shuttlesworth) to go to the 
governor's alma mater.</P>
<P>I don't know why Spike underplayed it. Perhaps he's not hungry 
anymore. He's got the exposure. He's got the reputation. He's 
got the undivided attention of black movie-goers. Maybe he's 
got too many "yes men" around him now. Success has a way of 
filing down a person's sharp edges. </P>
<P>Not much politically correct stuff in the movie. Interestingly,
Spike scripts in more subtle affection for Italians than they 
deserve. And the Hispano-black lead in the movie -- Jesus's 
girlfriend -- has the curious name "Lala Bonita." Funny, but 
kind of slap. Kind of like naming the lone blackman in a 
movie "Nappy Hamhock." _Boricua_ is thrown all over the flick 
as I guess the Puerto Ricuenos are beginning to shape 
black/inner city culture. And one of Jesus' gangsta friends 
is a very white looking Puerto Rican. Jesus' mother looks 
whiter than Lena Horne. </P>
<P>I get the sense that Spike has turned the corner on his 
racial animus, if he ever had any. I know he disapproved of 
his father's second (white) wife. And then again maybe it was 
more complex than that. After all, I remember the racial "hype"
surrounding Spike Lee and "Do the Right Thing" and rap groups 
such as Public Enemy. </P>
<P>Maybe I should have been suspicious when this film got a 
white-media 3+ stars. Traditionally, they used to show up on 
my TV screen to protest some of his best work -- "School Daze,"
"Do the Right Thing," "Jungle Fever" -- thereby elevating those
films to "must see" status. Hey, any black man causing 
consternation among the whitefolk, while producing good 
entertainment and yielding provocative racial dialogue is a 
"must see" in my book. Yet, there was nothing even redeemingly
risky in this venture.</P>
<P>The movie's failure all made sense to me by about 30 minutes
into the overdone Nike Ad. Think about the promo, all the 
cameos and the Public Enemy soundtrack, I understand what 
Spike Lee is into now -- making money off the presentation 
rather than the substance. His film had a quintessentially 
American/multi-cultural sheen to it, but jazz always seems to 
sneak into his movies. And whereas I've almost always found 
his movies having something in them for everybody, this 
effort fell short. Simply, it tried too hard.</P>
<P>I bet Spike hoped this film would end up being a "cross-over" 
bonanza. Yet, all it signalled to me is that he ready to 
"sell-out." Way too much Aaron Copeland in the soundtrack. 
Way too many slow-pans over meaningless pastoral settings. 
One wheat-field shot is too much! All the P.E. tracks used 
classic-rock riffs as the back-beat. The first scene, in fact, 
had a farm boy with corn-colored hair shooting a basketball. 
C'mon! Basketball might be American, but really, any more 
genuflecting to the whitefolk in a sport mostly dominated 
blacks is just a few steps above pan-handling.</P>
<P>As for the drama, Spike left all the dramatic material wrapped
up in its unopened box. Jesus remains the same as when he 
began, his father, virtually unchanged -- save his 70s 'fro 
that the furlow produces. Other characters remain the cardboard
cut-outs they are introduced as. I know Spike's been criticized
of this before -- no character development -- but at least in 
his earlier works, he used these cartoons for comic effect and 
some important social commentary. </P>
<P>Perhaps there's a lesson drawn from his film and its artistic 
failure. In one scene, when an Italian agent tries to court 
Jake's son into jumping right into the NBA, Jesus says he's 
going to pick a "brother" as an agent. The agent quickly pulls 
out a wad of greenbacks and says something like "I'm white, 
you're black and the only thing that matters is green...this is
green." Well, now I know what Spike's grabbing for and you 
better believe it ain't the soul.</P>
