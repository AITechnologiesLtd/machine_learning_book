Rating(out of 10): 8.5 (10 if you live for action flicks)</P>
<P>I think that every summer there are a lot of disappointments in the
big budget action/thriller movie genre. It even gets a bit tedious
to go to a bunch of films, only to say, "Well, at least the air-
conditioning worked."  Fortunately, some good nail-biters come along
to make the summer a bit more exciting.  I wanted to endorse AIR FORCE 
ONE as being the best action/adventure film I have seen this summer.  
The action seens were good, the pace never slowed down, and the actors
were decent in their respective roles.  In fact, at one time, I thought
that starring in an action flick did not require all that much acting
talent (just look tough, stay out of the way of the special effects, and
deliver one catchy line).  However, I am starting to think that Harrison
Ford is a brilliant actor who can make us believe that he is scared 
sh**less one second, and then a moment later believe that he has 
forgotten that he could get killed if he attacks the guy with the gun.</P>
<P>Other reviewers may tell you that this material has been done, the
actors a and b were stiff or over the top, etc.  I don't disagree with 
them, but as a package, if you enjoy action films (like Die Hard), and 
don't care if this is the 3rd airplane thriller this year, then you will 
enjoy AIR FORCE ONE.  It is the best action film I have seen this year, 
not the best film overall, but easily the best of its genre.</P>
