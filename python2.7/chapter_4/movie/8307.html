<PRE>A film review by Adam Joyce</PRE>
<PRE>Con Air</PRE>
<P>Jerry Bruckenheimer and Nicolas Cage, respective producer and star of The
Rock, team up again for an all action thrill ride titled Con Air.</P>
<P>Cameron Poe, played by Cage, with a newly found muscle-bound physique, is
about to be released on parole to see his wife and 7 year old daughter -
whom he has never before met. He has been counting down the days to his
release from prison since being convicted of manslaughter for defending
himself. Coincidentally his release date is his daughter's birthday and
again, coincidentally, of course, he lands a ride home on a special plane
for the transportation of criminals, with psychopaths, rapists and an
assortment of the nastiest guys on Earth as his fellow passengers. This
effectively sets up what is to follow.</P>
<P>The aircraft is inevitably captured by the criminals after take-off, with a
particularly clever but evil character called Cyrus "The Virus" Grissom,
played solidly by John Malkovich, acting as the ring leader. All the
criminals, Poe included, are released from their shackles, and the guards
locked up. Although quite a few characters, guards and criminals inclusive,
are killed in the exciting chaos of the capture - violence is what drives
the narrative. Poe's only aim is to get home to see his wife and child, but
stays on board the aircraft when given a chance to leave in order to save a
friend. </P>
<P>Poe is the (stereo)typically heroic character, the wholly good saviour of
the day, who acts in-line with the other criminals in order to save his
friend. Meanwhile, the long arm of the law follows the aircraft. John
Cusack plays Vince Larkin, the US Marshal who has the responsibility of
looking after the aircraft, and finds himself trying to convince the DEA
agent, Colm Meaney, not to have the plane shot down, but to spare it in the
hope that Poe will help them.</P>
<P>Con Air supplies its audience with a very generous amount of action and
violence. This is combined with a touch of comedy and those essential
dramatic moments. The performances are convincing, especially from the lead
actors, Cage, Cusack and Malkovich. It's particularly interesting to
discover the histories and backgrounds to each of the criminals, one can
even develop a peculiar fondness for some, and unlike some films, follow
their individual efforts as opposed to a mass of unknown characters
fighting the good guys.</P>
<P>The story is somewhat (to put it kindly) predictable and cliched, with a
most unoriginally happy ending. Most of the characters are also heavily
stereotyped, but what else would one expect in an action movie of this
calibre? However, these seeming negatives detract nothing from an exciting,
involving action packed film. Once Con Air gets flying, the action and
interest doesn't stop. Essentially an entertaining film, one of the best
action adventures of recent times (if you don't judge the script and plot).
As impressive, if not moreso, than The Rock.</P>
<PRE>4 out of 5</PRE>
