<PRE>A PERFECT MURDER (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Andrew Davis</PRE>
<P>Writer: Patrick Smith Kelly (based on the play "Dial M For Murder" by 
Frederick Knott)</P>
<P>Starring: Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, Viggo Mortensen, David 
Suchet, Sarita Choudhury</P>
<P>"A Perfect Murder" is, of course, lifted from "Dial M For Murder," the 
play that was later transformed into a terrific Hitchcock movie starring 
Ray Milland and Grace Kelly, thus this film belongs in the elite 
sub-sub-genre of films known as Hitch Remakes. Hitchcock is commonly 
referred to as the Master of Suspense, and rightly so, but he was a 
quaint director and liked to deal more with character development and 
set pieces rather than dump thin characters in a silly plot - he made 
his stories believable and involving by major use of directorial tricks 
and the like, but never corrupted his films. And his fims were his own; 
no one has ever been able to immitate his filmmaking abilities because 
he had such a gentle, unique touch when it came to movies. Why directors 
are so arrogant to think they can imitate him is beyond me (Gus Van 
Sant, that was directed towards you), especially since thrillers just 
aren't made like that these days, and that's why I'm just a little more 
open-minded towards Andrew Davis for making "A Perfect Murder" almost 
nothing like the original. The plot - a millionaire hires an assasin to 
kill his cheating wife - is the same, more or less, and the (attempted) 
assasination involves a distracting (for her) phone call.</P>
<P>But that, refreshingly, is where the similarities end. Why refreshing? 
Like an adaptation of a novel, why can't remakes be exactly the same, 
changing as little as possible? Or at least you'd probably think that 
was my thinking, but alas, that isn't as of now. Over the summer, just 
hearing the fact that the lover is hired to kill her drove me nuts; 
nowadays, after hearing the spectacle de crap that was the "Psycho" 
shot-for-shot remake (to be fair, though, I still haven't seen it), I've 
had a change of heart, basically because if a film (or an adaptation of 
a novel) is exactly the same, why should I watch that and not the 
original, which is the authentic one? Well, "A Perfect Murder" changes a 
whole lot from the original play and subsequent film: the assasin is 
changed, as I said; it takes place all over the city, instead of mostly 
inside an apartment; it does immensely less with the detective (David 
Suchet, limited to merely being a sporadic visitor), involving the 
characters more; and the ending is changed incessantly, as well as other 
smaller details (the wife is given a friend and a UN job, etc.).</P>
<P>On paper, it looks pretty good: it makes it more of a morality play, 
dealing with the villainy and evil of each of the characters, at least 
in some way. Not only does the husband wreak evil-incarnate, but the 
boyfriend is given a twisted other-side, and the wife even gets to do 
her own evilness (at least it appears so in an unused, alternate ending 
I was priveleged to see). Some not bad ideas, here, and the ingredients 
for a twisted little thriller. Alas, it isn't really so. While there is 
a lot to like about "A Perfect Murder," mostly of what's above, it's an 
overall disappointing and run-of-the-mill thriller, not too suprising as 
it comes to us courtesy of Andrew Davis, who, yes, directed the terrific 
"The Fugitive" a couple years back, but if you also remember has 
directed a cheapo Steven Seagal movie or two (well, I almost liked 
"Under Siege," but "Above the Law" blew and you know it), as well as a 
couple other disappointments (do you even remember "Steal Big, Steal 
Little?"). Sure, Michael Douglas gives another great, chilling 
performance, the kind he's best known for (read: George Gekko), adding 
mounts upon mounts of tension into such simple scenes of saying hello to 
his wife after a day at work. And he's our protagonist, thankfully, 
ensuring that we'll be front row for some Machiavellian instances of 
gusto.</P>
<P>But instead of being truly twisted, "A Perfect Murder" tosses him into a 
series of twists and turns that slowly become so manufactured and 
questionable that the film soon loses all credibility and descends into 
yet another generic thriller that Hitchcock would have never made 
without a full frontal labotomy. At first, the first big twist, 
concerning the lover (Viggo Mortensen, so marble-mouthed that the film 
should require subtitles when he speaks) works, and it continues to work 
throughout, but the implausibility gear kicks in after awhile, and a 
twist towards the end is so cliched and questionable that I couldn't 
believe the surviving character was so cool about it afterwards. He 
loses his edge along the way, as well, occasionally treated like a 
Richard III-esque anti-hero, as we follow him along with his numerous 
schemes to be the surviving character in this charade, and then treated 
like the supreme villain of the piece because the film's not sure what 
to do with him. It's afraid to go all the way and accept Douglas as our 
anti-hero, like the original film did, and in turn, deceives its own 
protagonist and even we the audience. It only hurts more that his 
character is saddled with such a pathetic excuse for an ending; I'd 
almost like to make a movie law about the use of gunshots to end 
thrillers - they're merely half-assed ways of finishing a conflict when 
they could be finished with a much more complex and much more satisfying 
finale (unforunately, that's not going to be the alternate ending I 
saw).</P>
<P>I'd be willing to look over this (I did with "The Cook, The Thief, His 
Wife, and Her Lover") if it had been satisfying up till then, but sadly 
enough it's only marginally satisfying up to that point anyway. 
Throughout, the script takes numerous easy-way-outs amongst the clever 
twists of the storyline, and instead of being a gleefully twisted duel 
between Douglas and Mortensen, both of whom are greedy, it adds on 
maudlin sympathy involving the wife (played nicely by Gwyneth Paltrow), 
who is seen as a whole other section of the movie as the big 
distraction: she may uncover some cheap truths about Douglas (why can't 
it be more about his wounded ego and NOT about mere greed), but she also 
ends up as the Achilles Heal to Mortensen, a huge detractor for the 
film. This ends up taking us out of the film, and doubting the film's 
handle on his character: is he changing from his past self, and if he 
is, then why is he at the same time not - I mean, what gives, man? 
Throughout, Davis directs with a mistaken amount of distance from the 
situation, as if he's not sure whose story this actually is. In the 
original, Hitchcock gave some sympathy for the husband, and later on, 
made it about wife and the husband. But Davis isn't sure who to 
highlight at any time, and we never feel for any of them, not even 
Paltrow's wife character. A great thriller would have us identifying 
with all of them, and then slowly and subtlely closing in on all of them 
as they play off one another.</P>
<P>I'm not much of a fan of Davis, save for his work on "The Fugitive," and 
I'm again not a fan after this film: his use of suspense is too slick 
and shock-loving. He even mucks up the assasination scene: in the 
original, the most memorable image was Kelly on the phone, oblivious to 
the assasin behind her (it's even on the cover of the tape, folks); 
here, it's another forgettable, in-the-moment jump into frame 
assasination, never more frightening than a quick jump in your seat, 
forgettable seconds later (though I have to applaud its replacement for 
the scissors - nice touch). Not that I'm wishing it were more like the 
original; I'd just like to see it as the competent, chilling film that 
it apparently wants to be but isn't. Instead, it's a film filled with a 
couple smart aspects, some nice twists, and a good jump or two, but 
absolutely nothing that you'll remember more than a week after seeing 
it. Here's to hoping someday someone will be able to make a Hitch remake 
that can successfully stand up on its own. Or, rather, how about just 
abandoning remakes altogether and instead coming up with a wholly 
original thriller, huh?</P>
