<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>It's the Y-13 experimental flight for reaching outer space that is navy
test pilot Lieutenant Dan Prescott's (Edwards) mission. He is the best
pilot on the base, but he is wild and unreliable, taking too many
unauthorized risks according to his brother, Commander Chuck Prescott
(Marshall), who heads the project. This B&W sci-fi film benefits from
the public's interest in space travel, whose interest was aroused
further by the recent launch of Russia's Sputnik satellite.</P>
<P>On this mission, Dan disobeys the order from control to commence his
turn and thereby forges his way ahead into unsafe altitude zones,
thereby becoming the first man into space, moving 250 miles into the
unknown. After running into trouble in outer space, his spacecraft will
crash land in New Mexico, but he can't be found in the craft. There are
reported cattle slaughterings in the area of the crash landing, and then
some brutal murders are reported. A blood bank is ravaged and a nurse
brutally slain, and Commander Prescott begins to suspect that the
monster doing this is his brother. With the help of the state police, he
finds clues of space dust on all the victims and he discovers near the
cattle the oxygen tank straps from his astronaut brother. With the help
of Dr. Paul von Essen (Jaffe), who does the lab work and has worked
closely with Dan on the project, it is determined that the dust
particles found are indeed from outer space and match those found on the
crashed spacecraft.</P>
<P>Dan's scientist girlfriend Tia Francesca (Landi) is concerned about what
happened. She berates Chuck by stating "People matter more than
machines." Chuck maintains that his brother knew the risks involved and
lived for such dangerous assignments. He also states, "When configuring
a new world, dangers have to be faced."</P>
<P>Dan has returned to Earth as a meteor dust-covered, blood-drinking
monster. He needs blood to survive, as his blood supply has been drained
and his metabolism severely altered. He is left with no memory- only an
instinct to stay alive. The film is done almost documentary-like, and it
almost seems believable, as the actors are all straightfaced about what
is happening.</P>
<P>Dan is tracked down, as the police realize bullets can't penetrate his
outer surface, and they let him head back towards Dr. Paul von Essen's
lab. He wants to return, driven by his instincts to report what he
observed in outer space. The doctor talks Dan into going into an
atmosphere control machine, where it is hoped that by feeding him
rarified oxygen, it could get his system working properly again. But
when he can't operate the controls because of his outer coating, his
brother goes into the chamber with him and heroically tries to save him
by working the controls.</P>
<P>I've seen a lot of sci-fi films that didn't make as much sense as this
one does. That doesn't mean that I think this B-film made too much
sense. But it was bearable and it didn't try to sensationalize the
monster's killing spree, and if you are not too fussy about the flat
dialogue and the phony Mexican accents heard, one might even find this
film to be easy to take on a rainy Saturday afternoon.</P>
