<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A terribly unreal end of the world film, even though it is laced in the
everyday world of a family drama. It's a thriller stressing supernatural
shocks and fuzzy apocalypse dramatizations, that has the cast trying
hard to be convincing about all the hokum presented of bloody rivers in
Nicaragua, dead fish in Haiti as the sea boils, of birds falling from
the sky, the earth shaking, ice in the Israeli desert in the same place
as Sodom, and hailstones on Fairfax Ave. in L.A., as all are part of the
seven signs from God as noted in the biblical prophesies. The signs mean
that he's come to judge the world and only a pregnant Demi Moore through
her self-sacrifice can stop him from destroying it. If I said hard to
believe, I really mean this film was so ludicrous, that it was
impossible to believe. It's a biblical nightmare turned into a
connection with other horror movies, as Demi thinks she's having
Rosemary's Baby.</P>
<P>Abby Quinn (Demi) is the expectant mother who has lost one child during
pregnancy and is now fearful of losing another. She is living in Venice,
California with her lawyer husband Russell (Biehn). He's working on an
appeal to stop the execution of Jimmy (Taylor), a youngster who killed
his parents because God ordered him to do it. In order to get some extra
money, they rent a small room over their garage to David (Jürgen
Prochnow), who looks like he's straight from Lee Strassberg's Method
Acting School, but there's a more logical explanation for his strange
behavior, ghost-like presence and fiery eyes -- he's God's messenger,
The Christ, and has come to witness the destruction of the world unless
Abby would give the world hope by sacrificing herself to save the child.
David's a busy messenger, he's been all over the world breaking the
seals of the seven signs, as he is finding no hope for the world to
become a peaceful place worth saving.</P>
<P>What arouses Abby's suspicions about this strangely quiet guy or rather
this supernatural character, is that she discovers ancient Hebrew
manuscripts in his room - with the date of her child's expected birth of
2/29 on it, and with script written in an ancient Hebrew language. She
also was suspicions about the Guf story he told her, of sparrows singing
when a child is to be born and of how the last sign before the
apocalypse, is that the first soulless child will be stillborn, and the
sparrows won't sing anymore when they encounter a pregnant woman. She
got help in translating this from a Talmudic student (Manny Jacobs).</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoilers to follow.</PRE>
<P>The film was so dreadfully out of touch with its own story, that it kept
piling on different situations which only made its far-out story even
more implausible. Lack of clarity became the only clear thing about the
film. There are dream-nightmare sequences that go back to ancient Rome
that Abby keeps having, there is a mad priest (Friedman) who is the
Vatican scientist confirming true miracles, but is really the Roman
gatekeeper who struck Christ and is now working to make sure the world
is destroyed while pretending to be working for Christ, and if that
weren't enough hokum, there is a series of natural disasters that the
population doesn't seem to be too concerned about but are really the
seven signs being enacted by God, and then there is Jimmy being thought
of as the last martyr, that his death will surely get the wrath of God,
which seemed to make no sense as to what God has to do with him killing
his parents. If this is what the filmmaker thinks God is, he has made
God out to be a lunatic.</P>
<P>The film lacked a decent script, meaningful acting, and credible
direction. It is a silly film --  but not one that was funny in a campy
way. The film's moral message that the world can be saved with hope,
seemed like mush.</P>
