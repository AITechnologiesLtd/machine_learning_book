<P>     December 30, 1999:  the penultimate day of the penultimate year of
the century (the 20th century doesn't officially end until the close of
2000).  In Los Angeles, the "biggest party of all time" is already
underway.  Crime is flowing as freely through the streets as champagne
at the high-class galas.  Ex-cop Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is in his
element:  a world where his former colleagues are too busy with serious
matters, like the roadside shooting of rapper/black activist Jeriko One
(Glenn Plummer), to harass small-time dealers like him.  What Nero
sells, however, isn't traditional dope, although it's just as addictive
and arguably more dangerous.  He's the magic man, not the candy man,
and his bag of goodies contains disks full of memories and
experiences.  Once plugged into the appropriate player, one disk allows
the user to re-live its contents, which could be something as innocent
as taking a shower, something as raunchy as participating in an orgy,
or something as grotesque as committing a murder.</P>
<P>     This is the premise of James Cameron's script for STRANGE DAYS,
the technologically slick action/thriller directed by his ex-wife,
Kathryn Bigelow (POINT BREAK).  Where TOTAL RECALL underused a similar
concept, STRANGE DAYS takes the subject matter and runs with it.  The
picture does not attempt to mix, mingle, or confuse fantasy and
reality.  Instead, it uses these ideas as a launching pad for a murder
mystery conspiracy that involves a car chase, shoot-outs, and a
fight-to-the- death climax--all the things expected from this sort of
motion picture.</P>
<P>     One of the most fascinating elements of STRANGE DAYS is the
subculture that has developed around Superconductor Quantum
Interference Device (SQUID) users.  Even though it's illegal to buy or
own these machines, their availability has created a thriving black
market for disks to run in them.  There's big money involved for those
who deal in memories, and for anyone willing to allow a part of their
life to be recorded.  Oddly, though, for all the dollars being traded,
no one seems to be getting rich.  Lenny has a run-down apartment and
always wears the same ratty wardrobe.  His street contact is in even
worse shape.  Only his friend Mason (Angela Bassett), who won't use a
SQUID, appears to have a financial foundation, and she's far from
wealthy.</P>
<P>     Only five years into the future, LA is a poverty-stricken city
seething with racial tension that STRANGE DAYS brings bubbling to the
surface.  This film can be seen as a two-pronged cautionary tale:  what
happens when drugs become the only escape from a grim reality, and what
could occur if attempts aren't made to heal the racial fissure.  A
Rodney King-inspired scene with LA cops beating an unarmed black woman,
and the riot that follows, underscores the volatility of the situation
in 1999--and it's not that different from recent history.  STRANGE DAYS
may be a dark fantasy, but its subtext never strays far from a reality
we can all understand.</P>
<P>     If the premise is the most fascinating element of the film, and
what draws the viewer in, Bigelow's tight pacing keeps the audience
involved.  The most recent two-and-one-half-hour film to move this
quickly was PULP FICTION.  Since there's no let up, viewing STRANGE
DAYS becomes an exhausting undertaking, and the unrelenting tone
doesn't allow a moment's relief.  Combined with the sensory overload
created by a throbbing soundtrack and stylish cinematography, this
makes for an intense movie-going experience.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the greatest assets of STRANGE DAYS are its lead
performers.  Ralph Fiennes (SCHINDLER'S LIST, QUIZ SHOW) continues to
impress with his range and ability.  After roles as a vicious Nazi and
erudite quiz show contestant, he returns to the screen as a seedy
techno-drug dealer "calmly backstroking along in the big toilet bowl of
life."  Angela Bassett plays the latest--and best-acted--female action
hero to emerge from Cameron's pen (following in the footsteps of
Sigourney Weaver in ALIENS and Linda Hamilton in the two TERMINATOR
flicks).  The supporting cast, which includes Tom Sizemore (DEVIL IN A
BLUE DRESS), a slimy Michael Wincott (THE THREE MUSKETEERS), and
Vincent D'Onofrio (HOUSEHOLD SAINTS), is solid.  Even Juliette Lewis'
spacy, one-dimensional performance doesn't damage the film--Bigelow
uses the actress to her best, albeit limited, ability.</P>
<P>     While STRANGE DAYS is accomplished in choreographed action,
character development, pacing, and visual effects, it displays serious
flaws as a murder mystery.  Not only is the killer's identity
telegraphed far too early, but one of the worst cliches of the genre is
reproduced here:  while holding the good guy at gun point, the bad guy
describes his entire plan.  Even the slight twist Cameron employs isn't
enough to camouflage this contrivance.  Overall, however, STRANGE DAYS
is a thriller first and a mystery second.  It's big, explosive
entertainment and, although not directed by Cameron, is very much in
the vein we've come to expect from him.  STRANGE DAYS may not be the
best movie to hit screens during the Fall, but it's likely to be the
brashest.</P>
