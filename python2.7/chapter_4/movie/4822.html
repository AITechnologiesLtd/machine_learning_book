<P>     UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL, the new film from director Jon Avnet (FRIED 
GREEN TOMATOES), is a splashy, beautifully-framed, nicely-photographed 
soap opera.  Taking its inspiration from the life of news anchor Jessica 
Savitch (as told in Alanna Nash's biography, GOLDEN GIRL), UP CLOSE AND 
PERSONAL presents a sanitized version of a gripping, tragic tale.  The 
true facts of Savitch's life are far more interesting than what's 
presented in this film, but Avnet wanted something more upbeat than the 
story of a woman who pursued success like a bloodhound, then self-
destructed when she achieved it.</P>
<P>     Like all good soap operas, UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL puts romance 
first.  As a love story, this film is affecting; as a look inside TV 
news, it's diverting (although not in the same league as BROADCAST 
NEWS);  but as a drama, it's weak.  Avnet is interested in manipulating 
the audience, not presenting any really arresting or thought-provoking 
material.  The director enjoys orchestrating tearful moments.  He did it 
in FRIED GREEN TOMATOES; he does it here again, and there's not much 
subtlety in his methods.</P>
<P>     UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL starts out in Miami, where Tally Atwater 
(Michelle Pfeiffer) has just been hired as an assistant to news producer 
Warren Justice (Robert Redford).  After several months of desk work, 
she's given a one-shot on-air chance as WMIA's weatherperson.  While 
giving five-day forecasts clearly isn't her forte, Warren is impressed 
by the way "she eats the lens", and promotes her to reporter.  Soon, 
she's on camera every night, even moving up to co-anchor.  Meanwhile, 
Tally and Warren become romantically involved.  But, when Tally's agent, 
Bucky Tarranova (Joe Mantegna), gets her a job in the nation's #4 
market, Philadelphia, Warren elects to remain behind in Miami.  In his 
words, he's been where Tally is going, and he has no desire to return.</P>
<P>     The core story of UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL -- Tally's maturation as a 
newswoman -- is rendered blandly and without color.  Frankly, if the 
romance wasn't appealing, this movie would be dreadfully uninteresting.  
Avnet attempts to add some tension by placing Tally in the middle of a 
prison uprising, but most compelling aspect of these scenes isn't how 
she responds to the situation, but how Warren reacts -- juggling news 
feeds and phone calls from the network while worrying that Tally might 
be killed.</P>
<P>     Even though he's showing his years, Robert Redford is still 
charming and charismatic as a romantic lead.  He and Michelle Pfeiffer 
develop an agreeable rapport that enables us to accept their 
relationship in spite of the age difference.  Their scenes together 
don't smolder, but they are warm and pleasant, and we find ourselves 
rooting for these two to find some way to be happy together.  Alas, in 
this land of predictable melodrama where A STAR IS BORN meets BROADCAST 
NEWS, there's always some plot contrivance designed to keep them apart.</P>
<P>     There are some worthwhile elements floating around in Avnet's soapy 
water.  Some of the behind-the-scenes newsroom bickering is 
entertaining, and Karl Walter Lindenlaub's camera manages to capture a 
few memorable shots, including one of Pfeiffer and Redford enjoying a 
quiet moment with the darkened Philadelphia skyline as the backdrop.  
Mostly, though, UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL is about Warren and Tally's 
relationship, and, if there's a reason that this film doesn't gel 
completely, it's because neither character is absorbing on their own.  
While mining for gold, UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL unearths bronze -- still a 
shiny metal, but not nearly as rare.</P>
