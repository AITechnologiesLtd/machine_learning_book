<PRE>                                GOLDENEYE
                       A film review by Sue Roberts
                        Copyright 1996 Sue Roberts</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Martin Campbell</PRE>
<P>Starring Pierce Brosnan, Izabella Scorupco, Joe Don Baker, Sean Bean,
Judi Dench, Famke Janssen.</P>
<PRE>Review by Sue Roberts.</PRE>
<P>The EVIL plot- to steal the "Goldeneye," which controls a space ray 
capable of  knocking out electric's for a thirty mile radius on earth. 
Can Bond find it before they cause terminal damage to all those 
computers? And just how many satellites are there?</P>
<P>Best opening graphics ever- fab. montages! I could have sat through two 
hours of just that. And don't you just love that theme music?</P>
<P>All the glamour and sweeping scale of the best 007 movies is on display.
However Brosnan is an entirely new kind of Bond, who views his opponents
with a hint of boyish amazement, (I mean, how could the cads behave like 
that?) And , of course, he charms the sox off the ladies!</P>
<P>Scorupco is excellent and plays the heroine, Natalya, using wide eyed 
innocence to disguise her intelligence. A beautifully judged parody of 
this role. </P>
<P>They play the "Brit" card for all its worth. M's upstairs entourage 
stiffly maintain a facade devoid of panic, no matter how serious the 
situation, while downstairs in the gadget department the mask slips and 
we see a more genuine U.K. response to a crisis from Q, in a great cameo 
from David Llewelyn, and his backroom boys. </P>
<P>The photography is excellent and in the second half we really get the 
benefit with all those great vehicles and effects. Cute helicopter, 
smashing train, and best of all, a car chase which is an absolute 
CLASSIC. "St. Petersburg" looks devastating..Anyway, the movie is worth 
seeing for that alone.</P>
<P>Oh, and I loved the "Post- Stalinist" graveyard. Totally surreal. I felt 
these touches worked best of all and were a nice contrast to the high 
tech. interiors.  </P>
<P>They stick to the formula, but manage to get plenty of variety into 
their locations.</P>
<P>What the heck this is all good Saturday night stuff. And the complexity 
of it! But come on guys- live dangerously! Just remember, we LIKE to be 
blinded by loads of scientific jargon. When you do the video, how about 
running some of that dialogue at 27 frames a second? It'll then match 
the momentum your SFX team have worked so well to create. It looks 
wonderful, but pace was always the hallmark of a Bond.</P>
