<P>     In the 1990's, the art of filmmaking is balanced, if not stifled,
by the business side of the industry.  Films are not produced on the
basis of their intellectual or artistic value, or by their political or
social importance, but instead by the projected net income of the studio
producing the film.  The only exception to this rule is the work of
independent filmmakers who choose to release their work via small
studios which are willing to take risks to make themselves more
well-known.  Gus Van Zant is such a filmmaker, and Fine Line Productions
is such a studio.</P>
<P>     Van Zant's MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO is the story of two male hustlers,
Mike Waters and Scott Favor, who meet in a bad section of Portland
Oregon, befriend each other for some time, and then separate.</P>
<P>     Mike Waters (River Phoenix) is a young man who suffers from
narcolepsy; a condition characterized by brief attacks of deep sleep,
brought on by a chemical change in the brain which occurs during periods
of stress.</P>
<P>     Scott Favor (Keanu Reeves) is a well-mannered, upper-class
individual.  He is in the hustling business mainly to bother his father
who is overwhelmingly rich.  His long-term goal is to become an
important member of the community, and to eventually become mayor.</P>
<P>     The film begins with a young man, Mike Waters, standing on an open
stretch of highway in Idaho.  Nothing can be seen but fields and hills.
Mike experiences a narcoleptic seizure, falling asleep in the middle of
the highway.  In the next scene, he is in Seattle serving to the wishes
of a customer.  Later, he moves on to Portland, and is picked up off the
street by a woman who takes him to a large mansion in the suburbs.
There are already two hustlers here, one of which is Scott Favor.  Mike
and Scott had met each other before, however they didn't really get to
know each other until now.  Mike has another attack, and Scott stays
with him until the morning.</P>
<P>     Back in the slums, living in a condemned hotel, Mike and Scott
become good friends.  Scott introduces Mike to his friends and
acquaintances.  In particular, there is Bob Pigeon (William Richert) who
is an overweight, alcoholic, old man who has a fondness for young men.
Bob is the leader of the group living in the hotel.  It is later
revealed that Bob was once in love with Scott, and Scott used him as a
teacher.</P>
<P>     Mike decides to begin a search for his "long-lost" mother, who was
last heard from somewhere in Idaho.  Mike accompanies him.  The two
acquire a motorcycle, and their journey begins.</P>
<P>     During the nighttime while sitting around a campfire, the two have
an involved conversation which tries to define their friendship.  Mike
tells Scott that he loves him without getting paid for it.  Scott tries
to tell him that "two guys can't love each other," but Mike disagrees.
Mike begins to cry, and he then kisses Scott.  The two lay down to
sleep.  The next day they learn that Mike's mother has traveled to
Italy.  They go to the airport and board the next flight.</P>
<P>     Scott falls in love with an Italian girl, leaving Mike alone and
broken-hearted.  Scott and the girl return to Portland, and Mike returns
separately, never finding his mother.</P>
<P>     The story is believable to anyone who has grown up in a city or at
least has been exposed to city life.  The scenes of bums and vagrants
living in abandoned buildings should not seem odd to most people, and
the idea of hustlers should not be too hard to accept.  The story of
Mike searching for his mother is totally natural and not forced in any
way.  The longing for a missing family member should be believable to
anyone who is not a cold-hearted product of asexual reproduction.</P>
<P>     The plot outlined above is primarily expository, however he entire
plot is not apparent until the film is nearly ended;  Mike is in Idaho,
standing on the exact same stretch of highway.  He experiences another
narcoleptic seizure, passing out in the middle of the road.  He is
exactly where he was when the film started.  After viewing this scene,
it is quite obvious that the film actually possesses an in medias res
dramatic structure.  </P>
<P>     Throughout the film we are subjected to flashbacks which reflect
the inner-workings of Mike's mind.  They contain images of peaceful
mountain rivers, fish, buildings which fall to the ground, shots of a
woman (Mike's mother) and a ranch-style house, and other incidental
material.  This reinforces the in medias res style.  It is important to
realize that the theme of this film is that Mike is searching for his
mother, and the incidents which occur during the film are, for the most
part, external to the actual story.</P>
<P>     Both internal and external conflict are present in MY OWN PRIVATE
IDAHO.  Internally, Mike is dealing with the fact that he cannot find
his mother.  This causes much grief for him, and is most likely a
contributing factor in his narcolepsy.  Externally, there is the
friendship between Scott and Mike which is abruptly placed on hold when
Scott falls in love while visiting Italy.  There is also the rocky
relationship between Scott and his rich father.  For some reason, Scott
finds it necessary to annoy his father by avoiding him and participating
in activities his father would never approve of.</P>
<P>     MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO is not a genre film, per se, but it is a
formula film in the fact that there is a main character (Mike) who is
searching for a long-lost relative.  Generally formula films are simply
reworkings of cookie-cutter stories, but director/screenwriter Gus Van
Zant has decided to work a formula story into a product which contains
unconventional ideas and characters, and forms of sexuality which are
not appealing to the general public.  These ingredients make for a very
unpredictable film, yet it is a formula film nonetheless.  MY OWN
PRIVATE IDAHO is certainly not typical Hollywood fare.</P>
<P>     It can be said that Gus Van Zant is a graduate of the auteur school
of filmmaking.  He wrote the screenplay for and directed MY OWN PRIVATE
IDAHO, as he did with his two previous feature films.  His first film,
which he made with $20,000 of his own personal savings, was named 1987's
best independent feature by the Los Angeles Film Critics' Association.
This film, MALA NOCHE, was photographed in grainy 16-millimeter black
and white.  His second feature, DRUGSTORE COWBOY was also met with
near-universal critical acclaim.  He has also directed two music videos,
one for David Bowie and more recently one for the Red Hot Chili Peppers.</P>
<P>     Gus Van Zant is a quiet man himself, such that an assistant
sometimes has to repeat cues that he has mumbled into the megaphone.  He
keeps to himself, hidden behind a veil of deep thought.  Van Zant has
been called eccentric, as he asks that his actors perform the scene
several times before the camera even begins rolling.</P>
<P>     Characterization is very important to Van Zant, and he prefers that
his actors try to remain in-character while they are not being filmed.
By doing this he feels that they will appear more natural when they are
in front of the camera.  This is easy for Phoenix and Reeves, as both
are personality actors.  Van Zant employs several methods of
characterization in MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO.  The characterization of those
living in the slums is primarily by external action and appearance, as
they are typically flat characters added simply to help the story along.</P>
<P>     Bob's character is developed by appearance and dialog, but
primarily through the reactions of other characters.  The main
characters, Scott and Mike, are established through dialog, appearance,
and external action.  Another important technique used by Van Zant for
River Phoenix's character is characterization by internal action.
Throughout the film we are presented with brief clips which indicate his
thoughts and feelings.  This can also be thought of as a form of
symbolism.</P>
<P>     Another form of symbolism, which is never explained, is the use of
the "smiley face."  At the beginning of the film, and when Mike returns
to the Idaho highway, he looks off to the distance and comments about
how the mountains and clouds look like "a ... face."  In another scene,
Scott lies down on a bed, staring up at a ceiling lamp which is
decorated with multicolored smiley faces.  At the end of the film,
previous to the credits, the legend "have a nice day" is displayed on
the screen.  For those who were raised in a cave, the phrase "have a
nice day" as often accompanied by the image of the smiley face.</P>
<P>     Another use of symbolism I noticed, which is probably totally
unrelated to the smiley faces, is the oddly frequent appearance of fish.
A shot of fish swimming in a river is shown twice, and decorative brass
fish appear as a part of one character's home.  Again, this is never
explained.</P>
<P>     Gus Van Zant's three feature films are not very similar in
directional style; however they do have a few similar traits.  Van
Zant's films contain serious stories which appeal to one's intellect.
At first, MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO seems to be a simple and straightforward
story, but as previously mentioned it is quite complex and involved.
The subject matter that Van Zant works with is unique and original, as
most directors would not be willing to work on such projects as he.
During the height of Nancy Reagan's "Just say No!" campaign, Van Zant
completed DRUGSTORE COWBOY, a film whose primary characters are drug
addicts.  MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO contains prostitution and shades of
homosexuality, and was made during a time when one of the most deadly
diseases in the world can be transmitted by sexual contact.  For
whatever reason, AIDS simply does not exist in this film, and the
omission is so obvious that it must have been intentional.</P>
<P>     When referring to Van Zant's cinematographic style, it should be
noted that he tends to use the objective camera; that is, the audience
views as a remote spectator.  So remote, in fact, that the viewer should
not find it odd to find himself looking down upon a scene as if he was
hanging from the ceiling, complete with a light bulb in the foreground.
The only exception to this rule is that Van Zant tends to use the
subjective style in scenes where Scott and Mike are not the central
focus.</P>
<P>     In most scenes Van Zant uses high-key lighting.  This is most
notable during scenes which take place outdoors at night.  It is very
rare that the characters are hidden in shadows, unless it is integral to
the plot.  When Van Zant desires obscurity, backlighting is used.  This
is most obvious when Scott and Mike leap out from behind the rock during
the robbery scene.  On the indoor hotel sets, Van Zant creates the
appearance of sunlight streaming through dusty windows; the gloom is
pierced by a warm glow, and the rooms are lit brightly enough that all
details are visible.</P>
<P>     The title MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO was inspired by the B-52's song
"Private Idaho," although the film has little in common with the song.
The "Private Idaho" in the film is the visions that Mike occasionally
sees in his mind.  Therefore it can be said that Mike is "living in his
own private Idaho"--and Idaho which is visible only to him.</P>
<P>     The music selected by Van Zant for this project consists primarily
of old American Folk tunes.  Therefore it is not incidental in nature,
rather it provides a continual background "mood music" effect.  This is
totally incongruous to the typical Hollywood style, where the story is
punctuated by orchestral music.  The style of music used in MY OWN
PRIVATE IDAHO perfectly suits the smooth, unobtrusive editing and
chronological narrative structure.  MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO has a very
slow, leisurely pace.  Scenes flow at an almost standstill rate,
focusing on small details.  Sometimes this is beneficial, as the dialog
seems to be written as though it were a literary masterpiece and not
natural speech.  The slow pace gives the audience time to contemplate
what the characters are speaking of.</P>
<P>     The first time I viewed MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO, at RIT's Talisman, I
found it quite confusing.  Only after attending the second screening did
it make some sense to me.  MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO is a very complex film
which ends without resolution of the story.  It deals with "taboo" ideas
which are not generally dealt with in the American cinema.  One reason
for my initial confusion may have been I was uptight about what I was
seeing on the screen, and this distracted me from the story at hand.
During my second viewing I knew what to expect, and devoted my attention
to the story.</P>
<P>     I found MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO to be a very depressing film.  River
Phoenix's character never does find his mother; and to make matters
worse, he loses Scott to a woman.  His narcolepsy is uncontrollable, and
this makes him an oddity to most people.  Without Scott, it appears that
he has no one to turn to at a time when he seems to need help the most.</P>
