<P>        ``The Butcher Boy,'' adapted by director Neil Jordan and
author Patrick McCabe from McCabe's novel of the same name, probes the
mind of young Irishman Francie Brady, a free-spirited kid whose
initially harmless mischief takes on an increasingly violent and
finally murderous bent as his surroundings grow darker and darker.</P>
<P>  Tales of troubled youth are easy to come by these days -
unfortunately this week you need look no further than the front page
of the newspaper - but Jordan doesn't handle this unsettling subject
matter in a traditional, cautionary way.</P>
<P>  Instead, he uses Francie's story as the launching pad for a
sometimes surrealistic portrait of working-class Irish life in the
early 1960s.  ``The Butcher Boy'' is a wildly uneven work, veering
from broad gross-out comedy to subtle observation, but its anchor is
Eamonn Owens' fascinating performance as young Francie. In looking for
his lead actor, Jordan has said he wanted to find a young James
Cagney. His search proved successful.</P>
<P>  As Francie's disillusioned alcoholic father, Stephen Rea (a
staple in most of Jordan's films) is quietly sensational, and so is
Aisling O'Sullivan in her brief appearance as his deeply depressed
wife.</P>
<P>  His Da's deterioration and mother's suicide are two of the
circumstances that put Francie on the road to trouble, but the chief
culprit is the pretentious Mrs. Nugent (Fiona Shaw). She's a
classier-than-thou type whose feud with Francie escalates into
startling physical violence. Jordan and McCabe aren't wholly
sympathetic to either party, but Mrs. Nugent's rampant Anglophilia
causes the Irish-born authors to paint her in a less flattering light
than she may deserve.</P>
<P>  Although it would appear that McCabe had in mind to write a
coming-of-age story, many of Francie's trials play out in an overly
familiar fashion, complete with faithless friends, workhouses not too
far removed from Dickens and priests who prove to be anything but
celibate. The filmmakers chronicle Francie's journey in a stream of
colorful, dreamy visuals, and too often ``Butcher Boy'' engages the
eye rather than the heart.</P>
<P>  Still, Jordan has never made a wholly uninteresting film -
even ``High Spirits,'' his misquided romp with Daryl Hannah
desperately trying to play an Emerald Isle ghost, has a certain
curiosity value - and there's just enough in ``Butcher Boy'' to make
it worthwhile. Besides, any filmmaker daring enough to cast
controversial singer-songwriter Sinead O'Connor as a foul-mouthed
version of the Virgin Mary deserves credit for pure chutzpah.</P>
