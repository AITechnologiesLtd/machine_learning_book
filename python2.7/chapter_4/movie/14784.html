<PRE>            THE SLEEPWALKER (Argentina with subtitles)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: In a distopic future in which a disaster has wiped out
memories of 300,000 people, one of the amnesiacs has memories from
another time.  They may be the key to finding a fugitive revolutionary
leader.  Toward the end there are a lot of interesting ideas
introduced.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Directed by Fernando Spiner who co-authored.
   - Fairly prosaic totalitarian society.  Plot of secret rebel person
     or place is fairly familiar.
   - Photography in monochrome with some objects in color to call
     attention to them as in SCHINDLER'S LIST and ZENTROPA (a.k.a.
     EUROPA).
   - Main character Eva awakes in a cathedral and is arrested by
     security forces.  No memory but an accident with amnesia gas has
     left 300,000 people without memories.  Nobody knows who was
     married or related to whom.  (Did none of these people carry
     identification in this totalitarian state?)
   - New state draws the letter "K" backwards wherever it appears.  How
     did this come about?
   - Government can look at tapes of main character's visions,
     memories, and dreams.  Not well done since main character sees
     herself in the third person in her own dreams.
   - The State is looking for Gauna, a poet and resistance leader.
     Agent Kluge chasing main character decides to join her.  Cross
     country chase.
   - Matte work not good by some countries' standards.  But artwork is
     good.  Some interesting ideas about the future.
   - Toward the end there are a lot of ideas.</P>
