<P>PLOT:
One-time 50's teen phenom crooner Frankie Lymon has his life immortalized
via the recollections of three women who all claim to be his wives and the
rightful heirs to his estate.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Interesting, highly stylized movie featuring a groovy soundtrack packed with
many of the funnest hits from the 50's, with some decent performances from
its four stars (despite some obvious prosthetics for their "older" looks)
and an overall authentic feel of the era. Afterwards, I will say that I was
somewhat disappointed to find out that some of the events taking place near
the end of the film were slightly dramatized for effect ("made up" for us
lay people, see Little Known Facts below), but still enjoyed its quick pace,
sometimes heavy-handed but generally creative directing style, and great
rockin' tunes. This film should definitely be seen by all those who are
interested in the music of that era, and/or anyone excited about any of the
film's main stars. Laurenz Tate specifically gives an exceptionally
well-rounded performance as the ill-fated Frankie Lymon.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Word on the street is that the wives never really bonded in real life as
shown in the film.</P>
