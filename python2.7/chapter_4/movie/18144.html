<PRE>                               THE MUMMY
                      A movie review by Joe Barlow
                          (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:  Brendan Fraser, Arnold Vosloo, Rachel Weisz,
                John Hannah, Kevin J. O'Connor
DIRECTOR:  Stephen Sommers
WRITER:    Stephen Sommers
RATED:     PG-13
RELEASED:  1999</PRE>
<PRE>                 RATING: **  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        Whether we like it or not, it has become standard practice for
Hollywood to remake classic films for modern audiences.  Stephen
Sommer's new cinematic retelling of "The Mummy" marks the first time
Universal Pictures has revisited one their most popular (and
profitable)
characters since the 1950s, a decade dominated dominated by cinematic
werewolves, vampires, and aliens.  Thanks to the popularity of the "B"
movie during this time period, the Mummy developed a loyal and
dedicated fan base.  The fact that he's back in theaters in '99 is not
nearly as surprising as the amount of time it took to get him there.
Is
the wait worth it?</P>
<P>        Early indications looked good-- the film has been receiving
favorable write-ups in entertainment magazines for a while now, and
innovative TV ads and a great trailer have only served to whet the
appetite of horror fans.  The thought of seeing a new story about one
of
the genre's premiere villains seemed like a great way to spend a
couple
of hours, and my expectations were high as the theater lights dimmed.
But alas, this movie won't go down as a classic, as some have
suggested; nor is it a modern "Raiders of the Lost Ark," although
portions of this movie are clearly inspired by it.  "The Mummy"
suffers
from a pace that borders on laconic, characters that are the epitome
of
cardboard, and a formulaic plot that's a little too neatly (ahem)
wrapped
up.</P>
<P>        The story opens with a splendidly filmed flashback.  Nearly
two
thousand years before the birth of Christ, an Egyptian priest named
Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) tempted fate by doing the unthinkable: falling
in
love with the Pharoah's mistress.  For this act of trechery, the
priest
was buried alive, and, for reasons I'm still not sure I understand,
imbued
with a curse: if his tomb is ever disturbed, the mummified priest will
come back to life and bring ten mighty plagues (the usual stuff:
locusts,
fireballs, turning water into blood, etc.) to Egypt.  (Why?  I have no
idea.)  But the Egyptians are so concerned that the priest will one
day
rise from his grave that they appoint a group of soldiers to guard his
temple (rather like the Holy Grail society in the third Indiana Jones
film).
This elite group is maintained over the millenia, with sons taking
their
father's places as they die.</P>
<P>        Flash forward to 1925, as Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and
his partners Johnathan (John Hannah, Gwyneth Paltrow's boyfriend in
"Sliding Doors") and Evelyn (Rachel Weisz, who looks like she's
desperately trying to be Kate Winslet) undertake an archaeological dig
in
the city of Hamunaptra.  No points for guessing what they find and
accidentally unleash while they're there.  Soon the locusts are a
buzzin'
and the sores are a runnin' as our explorers try to defeat the
reincarnated
Imhotep, who plans to imbue his mummified lover with Evelyn's spirit.</P>
<P>        With me so far?  Good... then perhaps you've already noticed
some
of the same problems that I did.  Let's start with the 'Guardians of
the
Priest's Tomb' concept.  Look, if the Egyptians are so concerned that
a
dead mummy might one day come back to life that they actually bred
generations of soldiers to guard his tomb, why not just burn the body?
For that matter, if this particular curse is such a dangerous one, why
cast it in the first place?  If the guy is that evil, why didn't they
just
kill him back in B.C. times and be done with it?  If they hadn't
cursed
him, he couldn't have come back to life later, and there'd be no need
to
breed generations of guards.  It seems like a silly loophole to me.
Or if
they simply *must* curse the poor guy, is it really wise to bury the
tools
needed to bring him back to life within easy reach of anyone who
should
happen to find the tomb?  Ever think about storing them somewhere
else,
guys?</P>
<PRE>        Never mind.</PRE>
<P>        I have no problem with films that require little or no
thought;
indeed, if "The Mummy" hadn't caused me to think at all, I could at
least
have enjoyed it as a strictly visceral experience.  As it stands, I
spent a
lot of time mentally cataloguing the numerous plot inconsistencies and
contradications (of which the above paragraph is only the tip of the
iceberg) when I should've been paying attention to the eye candy and
special effects.  Spotting the various plot holes gave me more
enjoyment
than the movie itself.</P>
<P>        It's not all bad, though.  Much has been written about
Universal's
complete overhaul of the Mummy character, and I must admit that
they've
succeeded in making him pleasantly creepy.  Gone is the moaning,
slowly-walking man in the white bandages, replaced by a formidable (if
obviously computer-generated) opponent with complete mastery over the
elements.  The Mummy actually succeeds in becoming an interesting
character!  (Now that's a sentence I never thought I'd write.)  Too
bad he
appears in so little of the movie-- the film is halfway over before he
puts in his first appearance; hence the laconic pacing I referred to
earlier.  Brendan Fraser also does fine work in his first
"action-hero" role.
Although the script attempts to paint the character as an Indiana
Jones
clone, Fraser succeeds in rising above mediocre material and being
genuinely likeable, just as he did in "Blast From the Past."  This is
a
man who knows how to play up to a camera, and the audience absolutely
loved him.</P>
<P>        The second half of "The Mummy" is actually kinda fun, though
it's not extraordinary-- it's standard popcorn fare, with a lot of
action,
great special effects, and some audience-pleasing quips and humor.
The
tedious opening scenes, however, go on far too long and don't contain
enough relevent information to justify their length.  People don't go
to a
movie called "The Mummy" because they want to see people sitting
around a table talking; they go because they want to be scared, have
fun,
and root for someone (be it hero or villain).  The movie's second half
realizes this, and it's no surprise that it's the more rewarding of
the two.</P>
