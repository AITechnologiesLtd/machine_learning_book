<P>"Killer: A Journal of Murder" is a laborious, clear-studied case in excess: it
is relentlessly overdone with bad acting, bad direction, and laughably
pretentious dialogue to boot. All I could keep asking myself was: why did
Oliver Stone serve as one of the executive producers of this junk? </P>
<P>The "killer" of the title is Leavenworth convict Carl Panzram (James Woods), a
real-life murderer who killed every person or thing that crossed his path
without hesitation. Carl is a thoroughly repellent, remorseless, amoral human
being with no redeeming values or virtues whatsoever, except that he's a
brilliant writer and an intellectual. Oh, really? Apparently, a Jewish prison
guard (Robert Sean Leonard) takes an interest in this killer, and brings him
writing supplies and a notepad so that Carl can write his life, er death,
stories. Harold Gould plays the prison guard as an old man as he narrates the
story of Carl, who in turn tells us his side of the story, the basis for the
"journal," in amateurish flashbacks complete with badly edited newsreel
footage. </P>
<P>Director Tim Metcalfe has no idea how to steer such unpleasant material so he
takes the Peckinpah approach: he throws everything up in the air without
sorting any of the details or characters (Metcalfe dedicates the film to Sam
Peckinpah). For instance, why would a Jewish prison guard be interested in a
character like Carl? What about the other inmates? And why is Carl depicted as
devoid of human feeling only to turn into a compassionate, saintly figure by
the end of the film? And why is Lili Taylor's cameo so much more effective than
anything else in the movie? </P>
<P>"Killer" is ambiguous, dull, and uninteresting; the narrative structure is so
sloppily fragmented that it will give you a migraine. The actors give forced,
listless performances, especially the unconvincing Robert Sean Leonard ("Dead
Poets Society"). For a look at Woods's more subtle, less maniacal roles, check
out "True Believer," "Cop" and "The Boost." Anything's better than this tripe.</P>
