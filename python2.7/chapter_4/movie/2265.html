<PRE>                              A PERFECT WORLD
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Kevin Costner, Clint Eastwood, T.J. Lowther, Laura Dern.
Screenplay:  John Lee Hancock.
Director:  Clint Eastwood.</P>
<P>     Let's face it, Kevin Costner hasn't become one of the most popular
movie stars in the world because he can act the hell out of a part.
Sure, he's been charming enough in light fare like SILVERADO and BULL
DURHAM, but he's done little to prove that his ideal dramatic role
wasn't as the corpse in THE BIG CHILL.  It therefore might not seem to
mean much to say that A PERFECT WORLD features Costner's best
all-around performance yet, and indeed it's nothing earth-shattering.
However, it's more than solid, and coupled with an impressive turn by
7-year-old T. J. Lowther creates a haunting story that packs a real
punch even through its superfluous subplot.</P>
<P>     Costner stars as Butch Haynes, a recidivist criminal who escapes
from a Texas prison with his cellmate on Halloween 1963.  In the course
of their escape, they take as a hostage young Philip Perry (Lowther), a
fatherless boy raised in a strict Jehovah's Witness household.  In
pursuit is Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), a veteran lawman
forced to team up with young criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern).
Soon Butch and Philip are on their own, and begin to form an
attachment, Butch acting as a surrogate father to Philip and Philip
reminding Butch of his own troubled youth.  As the unlikely pair head
out of Texas, they head also for a showdown with Red, and with Butch's
confrontation with his own tortured past.</P>
<P>     Screenwriter John Lee Hancock makes one big mistake, and that's
spending so much time and the tired and uninteresting subplot focusing
on the law enforcement in pursuit of Butch.  It seems in the early
stages that he's setting up a parallel, or is interested in creating a
hunter-hunted conflict a la THE FUGITIVE, but neither reall proves
true.  Instead we get cliche'd characters in cliche'd conflicts.
There's an icy Fed to get on Red's nerves, and plenty of pithy good ol'
boy wisdom dispensed.  Eastwood and Dern toss off token lines of
good-natured antagonism, but neither one is interesting enough to make
their story at all significant.  A tighter, potentially classic drama
might have come from chopping their segments entirely, because the main
plot is a gem.</P>
<P>     The relationship between Butch Haynes and Philip Perry is one of
the most unique and interesting explored in recent years.  While at
first glance Butch might seem to be a simple "victim of a negative
environment" type, he's more complicated than that.  The picture that
develops of his father is far from clear, making Butch a less than
reliable narrator.  His attachment to Philip is based on the worst
memories of his father, yet it is his father he seeks throughout.  A
PERFECT WORLD plays out like an extended therapy session for Butch, as
he attempts through Philip to create the perfect childhood he could not
have for himself.  Costner captures a surprising amount of nuance in
his portrayal of Butch, one minute the doting father, the next an edgy
psychotic.  It's a radical change of pace for Costner, and he pulls it
off.  Perhaps the larger credit for A PERFECT WORLD's success is T. J.
Lowther.  He's not asked to say much, but his expressive face becomes
one of the most vital elements in the film.  The relationship between
Butch and Philip is the heart of A PERFECT WORLD, and it's nearly
perfectly executed.</P>
<P>     Director Eastwood's first outing since his Oscar for UNFORGIVEN is
a similarly dark piece about a struggle for redemption, and while the
whole may not be as strong as last year's Best Picture winner, some of
the moments are even better.  The opening sequence is instantly
gripping, and a long shot of Butch and Philip walking through a field,
the boy repeatedly attempting to hold the criminal's hand, is
wonderful.  The best sequence comes near the end, as an idyllic waltz
quickly turns into a remarkably intense confrontation.  Eastwood draws
out the ending a bit too long, but by that point I was more than
willing to stick with Butch and Philip.</P>
<P>     A PERFECT WORLD is really two films.  One is mediocre at best, but
the other is one of the best films of the year.  Together, they still
add up to one of the better films of the year.</P>
<P>     A note to inside joke watchers: look for a billboard for "Bull
Durham Tobacco" in the sequence at Friendly's store.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 fathers and sons:  8.</PRE>
