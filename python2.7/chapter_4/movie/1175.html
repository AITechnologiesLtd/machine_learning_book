<PRE>                                  CAPE FEAR
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  How can you go wrong with a crime
     thriller directed by Martin Scorsese, photographed by Freddie
     Francis, with credits by Saul Bass and a score (virtually) by
     Bernard Herrmann?  You do it by trying too hard to make the
     ultimate thriller and taking things just too far.  Had this
     film been tied up twenty minutes earlier, it would have been
     rated better than a low +2 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     There seem to be a lot of different groups who were involved with
making CAPE FEAR.  There was Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, there
was Cappa Films, and there was Tribeca Productions.  Martin Scorsese
directed.  But somehow at the heart of this film is Steven Spielberg.
Though his name appears no place in the credits, what is good about this
film and what is bad about it has Spielberg's name written all over it.
Spielberg seems intent on going from one genre to another making the
ultimate film of that genre and then overpowering it with excess.  What 1941
was to wartime comedies, what RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was to action
adventures, what POLTERGEIST was to the ghost story, that is what CAPE FEAR
is to the crime-suspense film.  This was supposed to be a tense suspense
film in the tradition of NIGHT OF THE HUNTER and the original CAPE FEAR.
And it succeeds beautifully.  Robert DeNiro's Max Cady is a brilliant and
implacable stalker.  For maybe eighty or ninety minutes, this is one of the
great suspense films.  Then some place--I'd say it is a trick Cady is able
to pull off with a belt--CAPE FEAR crosses the line from tense but realistic
film into monster movie.  And if a monster movie has tension at all, it is a
different kind of tension.  From that point on, the identification value is
gone and the viewer just watches two opposing forces chew away at each
other.  This is one film where less would have certainly been more.</P>
<P>     Fourteen years ago public defender Sam Bowden (played by Nick Nolte)
intentionally hid evidence that could have freed his illiterate client Max
Cady.  He had known his client was guilty of rape and did not want to see
Cady go free.  Sent to prison for fourteen years, Cady taught himself to
read, then educated himself to understand the law.  He also built his body
into a tower of strength.  And once he learned of his lawyer's betrayal, he
dedicated himself to making Bowden pay for hiding evidence.  In fourteen
years, Cady has made himself a supreme strategist preparing for the war with
Bowden that Cady knew was coming.  Cady's attacks will tear apart Bowden's
family life and will destroy Bowden's career.  While Sam Bowden flounders to
find the best way to defend himself, Cady will make one brilliantly
considered move after another.</P>
<P>     Robert DeNiro's Max Cady is an excellent screen villain.  Behind the
hair slicked back with black grease and the big obnoxious cigar is the agile
mind of a chess master.  He can be vicious like a force of nature or he can
be seductive like a snake.  In the longest scene of the film he turns his
seductive power on fifteen-year-old Danielle Bowden.  This is a particularly
powerful and disturbing scene.  It is the centerpiece of the film and it
shows how Cady manages to turn every human frailty to his advantage.</P>
<P>     Another example of the excesses of this film, incidentally, are Cady's
religious tattoos.  A nice touch from NIGHT OF THE HUNTER (and perhaps from
the original CAPE FEAR--I do not remember) is that Robert Mitchum covers his
psychotic behavior with a veneer of fundamentalist religious piety.  We are
never really sure whether or not he really believes his viciousness is
fulfilling God's will.  However, he takes the piety to the point that he has
tattooed himself with religious messages.  In this film, DeNiro's Cady has
the same religious fervor and has become a veritable illustrated man, with
more than a dozen religious tattoos.</P>
<P>     This is a film that spared little expense to create its effects.  On
top of a good cast--Robert DeNiro, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, and Joe Don
Baker--the film throws in cameos of three actors from the original film--
Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, and Martin Balsam.</P>
<P>     Technical credits are equally well cast.  Title sequences are done by
Saul Bass.  For those unaware, Bass really pioneered the idea of making the
titles into films that stand on their own and comment on the rest of the
film.  Many of the classic films that had striking credit sequences show his
work.  These include AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS, VERTIGO, THE BIG
COUNTRY, ANATOMY OF A MURDER, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, and NINE HOURS TO RAMA.
The tension and the bizarre visual effects start in the opening credits,
which are superbly crafted by Bass.</P>
<P>     From there the visuals are carried by Freddie Francis--also one of the
greats in his field, moody photography.  Francis's work includes THE
INNOCENTS, THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMAN, THE ELEPHANT MAN, and DUNE.  This
year he did THE MAN IN THE MOON.  To have both Bass and Francis on the same
film seems to indicate someone went out with a very large wallet and a
determination to buy the best.  The one visual out of place is the use of
super-dramatic storm-cloud skies, uncharacteristic of Francis, but almost a
trademark of Spielberg.</P>
<P>     The original CAPE FEAR and many of the best of Alfred Hitchcock's
thrillers had scores by the late Bernard Herrmann.  Herrmann, of course,
could not do this score, so Elmer Bernstein was hired to rework Herrmann's
original themes from the first CAPE FEAR and in general to write in
Herrmann's style.  So one more expensive but tasteful decision was made.
The new CAPE FEAR essentially has a Bernard Herrmann score, full of the
master's dramatic dissonances, even if Herrmann was not around to write it.</P>
<P>     Of all the choices of who would work on the film, the only one that was
really questionable is Martin Scorsese to direct.  And it may have been the
biggest mistake.  Scorsese's forte is realistic crime.  His one foray into
horror fantasy, AFTER HOURS, works mostly because it needed exactly what
Scorsese could give it: a feel of realism.  Here that same feeling of
realism stands him in good stead as long as it can, but when Cady crosses
the line into monster and super-villain, Scorsese has mothing more to
contribute.  The film goes into auto-pilot and Scorsese just films his
scenes.  The film shows Freddie Francis's art but loses any Scorsese feel.
One more reason that the last part of the film was ill-considered.</P>
<P>     CAPE FEAR is a very good thriller that saves almost all of its mistakes
for the last part of the film.  I would give it a low +2 on the -2 to +2
scale.</P>
