"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>There is one particularly thought-provoking moment in the new
professional wrestling documentary Beyond the Mat.  The setting is just
before a World Wrestling Federation extravaganza called `The Royal
Rumble,' where two competitors calmly discuss the choreography of their
well-scripted WWF title match scheduled for later that evening.  The
wrestlers are defending champ Mick Foley (a.k.a. Cactus Jack [a.k.a.
Mankind]) and The Rock, but that's not what makes this moment
noteworthy.  It's the fact that these two gentlemen are responsible for
the #1 and #2 slots on the current New York Times list of the country's
best-selling books.  I couldn't help but wonder if Ernest Hemingway and
William Faulkner had a similar conversation before their steel cage
match.</P>
<P>That is one of the few memorable interludes from Barry W. Blaustein's
film.  Blaustein, a screenwriter on several Eddie Murphy films
(including The Nutty Professor and its forthcoming sequel Nutty II: The
Klumps), describes himself as a lifelong fan of professional wrestling.
He knows it's fake, but still loves the theatrical pageantry and
athletics involved.  Once Blaustein declares his adoration of the faux
sport, you know that this isn't going to be a hysterical look at the
inbred legions of wrestling fans throughout the country (like
Trekkies).  That approach would have made for a much more substantial
and less one-sided film.  Mat is more of a fluff-piece.</P>
<P>Experienced documentary fans may assume that since Blaustein avoided the
mocking nature of Trekkies-style films, Mat must be a carefully
composed, beautifully lensed picture with a compelling score, like the
works of Errol Morris (Mr. Death).  Wrong.  Mat isn't even shot on
film.  It's like watching somebody's homemade video of a family
picnic…if their family consisted primarily of clinically insane,
middle-aged, overweight wrestling uncles.</P>
<P>Mat begins promisingly enough, with Blaustein and his crew filming
within the posh confines of the WWF world headquarters.  Before the film
shows WWF honcho Vince McMahon interview an ex-footballer that can vomit
on command, a Senior Marketing Vice President of the billion-dollar
company compares the WWF to the Muppets – with a straight face.  He says
they're both family-owned businesses, but fails to provide any other
evidence of similarity.  I must have forgotten about that puking Muppet
on Sesame Street who kept bashing Snuffleupagus with a chair.</P>
<P>The documentary then downshifts into a wrestling school run by an
accountant as wide as he is tall.  Specifically, this portion of the
film focuses on two up-and-comers – WWF hopefuls that get a huge break
when they're allowed to fake-fight on the undercard of a WWF tour stop.
So far, so good.</P>
<P>Mat loses steam by telling the tale of Terry Funk, a `living legend'
(a.k.a. washed-up has-been) from Amarillo, Texas.  Funk still wrestles
despite warnings from his doctor and pleadings from his family.  Using
his two bad knees, Funk helps support a fledgling wrestling group called
Extreme Championship Wrestling land their first pay-per-view event.
It's fun to watch the looks on the faces of Funk's wife and children as
he wrestles.  Is it embarrassment or genuine concern for the welfare of
a close relative?</P>
<P>Mat's next subject sucks the remaining life out of the film.  Another
wrestler in the twilight of his career – one Jake `The Snake' Roberts –
recounts a life story that would make Jerry Springer drool.  His saga
includes incest, murder, rape, kidnapping and crack addiction.  Roberts
really brings the film down, not so much with the content of his story,
but rather the way he (and Blaustein) tells it.  He doesn't move his
mouth much, which made me think that it would have been better to use
photographs of a younger Roberts instead.  But then I realized that you
would still be able to hear his monotonous, sleep-inducing tone.</P>
<P>Things pick up a bit when Mat shows Foley/Cactus/Mankind getting a wound
on his head that resembles a woman's private parts after being
repeatedly beaten by a folding chair brandished by The Rock.  This
beat-down is as real as the horrified looks on the faces of Foley's
teary-eyed wife and sobbing kids that watch from the front row.  But
then Blaustein goes back to the much less interesting Roberts.  The
result is a film that's choppy, uneven and practically screams `Jesus,
show wrestlers and their fans as deranged carny folk and freaks of
nature that evolution passed by!'  That's the film that I wanted to
see.  Instead, Mat is a biased story of a billion-dollar industry that
must have tons of skeletons in its closet.  But it didn't even open the
closet door.</P>
