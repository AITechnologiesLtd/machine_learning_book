<PRE>Election
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Far too often when we step into the voting booth, we are forced to choose the
lesser of evils. It's a fact of jaded modern life that we rarely feel there is
a "best person" we want to win. It's no different in high school.</P>
<P>At George Washington Carver High School (with hardly a person of color in
sight), Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is destined to win the student body
election. There is no one running against her.</P>
<P>Her error is reminding faculty advisor Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) that
when she wins, they will be spending a lot of time together. Remembering the
previous year when the beautiful teen took a colleague of his into the
darkroom to see what developed and thinking of his secret collection of
cheerleader porn, McAllister can see the ominous writing on the wall.</P>
<P>Determined to avoid his fate, he convinces star jock Paul Metzler (Chris
Klein) to run against Tracy. Paul stumbles into trouble when his sister
Tammy's (Jessica Campbell) supposed lesbian lover jumps into his bed. Tammy
decides to run against Paul for revenge.</P>
<P>The issues are gray rather than black and white. There are no demons or
saints, just people. Director Alexander Payne must remember what high school
was really like.</P>
<P>Even better, it's hilarious. When prim and proper Tracy is wearing an
over-sized campaign button and giving away cupcakes, all saying "Pick FLICK",
it's a reminder of why her last name is a typographer's nightmare and
broadcasts her secret attitude.</P>
<P>The actors are in fine form. It's fun to watch Broderick on the other side of
the desk from his Ferris Bueller role. Witherspoon is flawless as the
pursed-lipped and driven over-achiever. The film is something of a satire of
the 1992 elections and her character is loosely based on Bill Clinton
(Campbell is Ross Perot), but she seems more like potential contender
Elizabeth Dole. Klein and Campbell are perfect in their roles.</P>
<P>Unlike any other teen film of recent years, "Election" is both humorous and
thoughtful. A fine combination.</P>
<P>[The appeared in the 6/3/99 "Bloomington Independent", Bloomington, Indiana.
