A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Stuart Baird</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: John Pogue</PRE>
<P>Ingredients:
Fugitive federal agent, ace U.S. Marshal and his competent team, plot to
sell government secrets</P>
<P>Starring: 
Tommy Lee Jones, Wesley Snipes, Irene Jacob, Robert Downey Jr.</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this sequel to THE FUGITIVE the great U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy
Lee Jones) meets his match when he and his team of deputies are assigned
to catch a dangerous fugitive federal agent named Mark Sheridan (Wesley
Snipes), who is suspected of killing two federal agents and selling
American government secrets.</P>
<P>Marshal Gerard immediately gets suspicious when he notices that, for a
ruthless killer on the lam, how come Sheridan keeps going out of his way
not to hurt anybody? And why have the Feds assigned a suspicious federal
agent (Robert Downey Jr.) to keep tabs on Gerard's team and trail the
marshals wherever they go? </P>
<P>Will Gerard catch Sheridan? Will Sheridan be able to evade the cops?
Will everyone finally figure out what's really going on?</P>
<P>Opinion:
This is a passable chase movie, following the formula of THE FUGITIVE.
There's a great plane crash in the beginning (it was an overturned bus
in THE FUGITIVE), and a spectacular scene where Sheridan is chased by
the Marshals to the top of a tall nursing home (it was the top of a tall
dam in THE FUGITIVE) and must make a breathtaking escape. Gerard and
Sheridan have a good fist fight as well.</P>
<P>The dialogue is sharp, and even side characters such as the airplane
pilot are well acted. The chases are exciting, and the special effects
are good. I especially loved Sheridan's daring escape from the top of
the nursing home.</P>
<P>There are some glitches in the story. For example Sheridan's girlfriend
Marie (Irene Jacobs) goes to a locker at Chicago's O'Hare  Airport,
removes a dark, important-looking bag and sneaks it to Sheridan, but the
bag's mysterious contents are never revealed. Another time, a captured
crook implies that someone higher up is behind the selling of government
secrets, but he refuses to reveal who the mastermind is. And we still
aren't sure if the real mastermind is caught by the movie's end.
Finally, U.S. MARSHALS would have a sharper dramatic edge to it if - -
as in THE FUGITIVE - - the plot allowed us to know right away that some
grave injustice were about to be done.</P>
<P>These nagging details take away from an otherwise entertaining movie,
but you know what they say about sequels.</P>
