<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>The funniest moments in Jackie Chan's American movie Rush Hour happen 
when cultures clash.  </P>
<P>There's a scene in which impetuous Detective Carter (Chris Tucker) 
points his pistol at wise Hong Kong Inspector Lee (Chan).  Watching the 
gun-happy could-be crooks, a cabbie pulls out a gun of his own and makes 
them freeze.</P>
<P>There's Lee's conflict with FBI agents, who get Carter assigned to 
actually keep Lee off the case.  The premise of the film, of course, 
relies on the failure of Carter's baby-sitting;  the action becomes 
hilarious when Lee gets away from Carter and outwits a houseful of 
federal agents.</P>
<P>Finally, there's the running joke of the Chinese detective who is 
repeatedly confused by African-American culture.  The audience gets many 
chuckles from the initial tension between the two cops.  Whatever 
egotistic ruse Carter tries out, Lee thwarts or shames or betters him.  
Chan is at his best when his comic skills run on naiveté;  it's even 
better when his innocence gets him into big trouble, as it does in a 
pool hall.  Oh, how quickly Chan charms us with humor and veers into 
well-choreographed violence!</P>
<P>The reason Inspector Lee visits the States is to assist in a kidnapping 
case: the daughter of the Chinese Consul Han (Tzi Ma) has been taken. 
What's moving is that Lee takes the crime somewhat personally; he's like 
an uncle to her, good-naturedly taking punches from the girl as she 
departs China.  It is Lee's connection as strong family friend that 
motivates his relentless battling of kidnappers as well as other 
officers.</P>
<P>Tom Wilkinson does a passable job in his role, though his character 
could have been made more round.  As the evil Sang, Ken Leung combines 
the right amount of sour stares and shakiness;  he's also a horrible 
shot with a machine pistol.  It's unclear why Elizabeth Pena appears as 
a partner - and sometime foil - to Tucker's loud-mouthed Carter.   She 
is always likable, but here fails to convince us she is a demolitions 
expert.</P>
<P>Jackie Chan's closing credits usually show out-takes from the shooting.  
Once again we get an idea about how rigorously the cast worked to 
produce the slick and athletic mayhem that is a trademark of Jackie 
Chan.  How many takes were needed to produce the fight in the Chinese 
restaurant?  In the abandoned building?  Did Jackie break or sprain 
anything during the shoot, we wonder?  </P>
<P>Originality is the key element in these slugfest sagas; let's face it, 
plots in Chan films can be found in Kojak or Beretta episodes.  But 
director Brett Ratner has created a film with smooth transitions and 
spots of characterization that actually make us care about Lee and 
Carter and some of the people they work with.  In seeing Rush Hour, what 
gave me my money's worth?  First, my son and I had the theater to 
ourselves.  OK, it was a small auditorium, but still it was like viewing 
a video on an extra large private screen.  Bottom line, I laughed out 
loud at Jackie's over-the-top stunts and martial arts gimmicks.  The man 
knows the power of exaggeration, and he knows that the audience is smart 
enough not to take him too seriously.</P>
