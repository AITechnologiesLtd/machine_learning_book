<P>     In THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, Robert Louis 
Stevenson examined the nature of good and evil by externalizing a 
normally-internal struggle.  Similarly, in THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, 
H.G. Wells explored the differences between man and beast by taking a 
battle that normally occurs deep in the heart (the civilized aspect of 
one's nature versus the bestial one) and realizing it in a concrete 
manner.  There's also a none-too-subtle message about the dangers of 
letting the advancements of science outstrip corresponding ethics.  As 
originally envisioned by Wells, THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU is a tale of 
great substance; as re-invented by director John Frankenheimer (THE 
MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE), it's disappointingly shallow and pointless.  </P>
<P>    This is, in fact, the third time the H.G. Wells story has been 
brought to the screen.  The first, called THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, was 
made in 1933.  Filmed in black-and-white with Charles Laughton as Dr. 
Moreau, it's a chilling (if somewhat outdated) look at what happens when 
a man plays god.  44 years later, with Burt Lancaster in the title role, 
a color version of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU opened in theaters.  
Arguably better than the original, this uses state-of-the-art makeup to 
augment an adventure that still has time to consider the philosophical 
implications of its subject matter.  Now, in 1996, we are saddled with 
another remake.  And, while it might have been possible to argue the 
merits of this version of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU if it had offered 
something more than the others, the sad truth is that it offers much 
less.  For, while the creatures look better than in even the 1977 
version, the heart and soul of the story have been gutted, leaving 
behind a hollow, chaotic nightmare.</P>
<P>     Somewhere under the debris left by a script credited to four 
screenwriters lie the remnants of Wells' story, but the original tale is 
distorted and diluted not only by the need to "modernize" it, but the 
desire to emphasize visual effects and pyrotechnics over drama.  (So 
what else is new this summer?)  When the movie opens, we're introduced 
to Englishman Edward Douglas (David Thewlis), the lone survivor of a 
plane crash.  He's drifting around on the ocean in a life raft when a 
ship captained by an American named Montgomery (Val Kilmer) rescues him.  
Then, as he's being treated for dehydration, he's taken to the isolated 
island of Montgomery's mentor, the Nobel Prize-winning Doctor Moreau 
(Marlon Brando), to await transportation back to civilization.  Almost 
immediately, Edward becomes aware that some very strange things are 
taking place there.  Moreau is experimenting with splicing animal and 
human DNA.  In trying to engineer the perfect creature, an entity that 
is "pure, harmonious, and free of malice", he has created a gallery of 
grotesquely malformed "beast-men".  The prize of his collection is his 
"daughter", Aissa (Fairuza Balk), a real "pussycat."</P>
<P>     THE ISLAND DR. MOREAU gets off to a promising start.  Steeped in an 
atmosphere that grows more ominous and eerie with each scene, the first 
half hour promises far more than what the rest of the production 
delivers.  The film's middle portion, while watchable, makes us aware 
that the script wasn't written for thinking viewers.  It's during the 
concluding half hour, however, that the movie's house-of-cards storyline 
collapses.  Nothing much makes sense, and the climax seems to exist 
solely as an opportunity to show off a few reasonably impressive 
explosions.  </P>
<P>     The acting varies from bad to awful.  During the last fifteen-plus 
years, Marlon Brando has been in the habit of taking small roles for 
obscene sums of money.  His cameo performances are typically terrible, 
and his interpretation of Moreau follows the pattern.  He's only on 
screen for about fifteen minutes, and, while there, his amazing girth is 
far more likely to capture our attention than his acting.  Meanwhile, 
David Thewlis and Val Kilmer seem to be in a contest to see who can ham 
it up more.  To be fair, Fairuza Balk (GAS FOOD LODGING) does a credible 
job of mixing kittenish and human qualities, but, although she creates 
the only sympathetic character in the entire film, she is underused.  
Other members of the cast, including Ron Perlman (THE CITY OF LOST 
CHILDREN) and Temuera Morrison (ONCE WERE WARRIORS), are unrecognizable 
beneath Stan Winston's makeup.</P>
<P>     Insultingly, Frankenheimer concludes the movie with a short sermon 
about the fine line that separates man from beast.  If the director 
actually wanted to get this point across, he should have worked it into 
the film rather than tacking it on as an afterthought.  It is, after 
all, an integral aspect of the source material.  That it has been so 
thoroughly excised from the main plot isn't THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU's 
only problem, but it's symptomatic of the flawed mindset that went into 
planning this occasionally incoherent and ultimately disappointing 
motion picture.</P>
