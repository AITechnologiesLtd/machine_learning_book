<PRE>                           MY FELLOW AMERICANS
                       A film review by Paul Miller
                        Copyright 1997 Paul Miller</PRE>
<P>My Fellow Americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little
substance (or a movie that we've all seen a million times), two lifetime
rivals thrown together and then the fun begins.  This is exactly what
happened in this movie, but fortunately, they managed to do it in an
interesting and funny way.</P>
<P>The movie starts with a quick (and I do mean quick) glance of two
presidents Russell Kramer (Jack Lemmon) and Matt Douglas (James Garner).
William Haney (Dan Aykroyd) and Ted Matthews (John Heard) are the new
President and Vice President.  There is a scandal that arises involving
a kickback from a contractor and Haney is positive that he buried that
years ago.  He finds a scapegoat in Kramer and now everyone wants Kramer
and Douglas dead.</P>
<P>This movie was exceptional for many reasons.  One being that they found
people (Lemmon and Garner) that have good chemisty together.  They
worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly, one
being a ladies man and one being the old man (I'll let you fiqure which
is which).  Also, they found people that know their parts as govenment
officials well.  It seemed to me that Garner played almost exactly the
same role that he played in The Distinquished Gentleman (except then he
was a Congressman).  Experience counts for a lot!!</P>
