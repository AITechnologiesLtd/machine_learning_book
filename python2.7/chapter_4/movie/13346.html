SUPER FEATURES:  Is the film about perfection in dance, or love...?</PRE>
<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>Danzon is one of those films that is actually pretty nice, although you
wonder what it is getting at.  It dedicates much time and attention to the
little things that make a good dance, or dancers, and to the
sensuality necessary to make it work between two partners.  But Julia, has
not only lost that partner, she has also lost what could be her one and only
special love, although it isn't clear that the lost
partner is her lover at all, although she would wish him to be.</P>
<P>After winning many dance contests with this man, she is now troubled because
he has disappeared.  And she starts looking for him.  And gets teased
miserably by her friends in the process.  Her chase
leads to a different town where she ends up caught up in a small  pair of
lies, and also has an affair with a younger man, who works in one of the
boats, she thinks her lover has gone, or has he.?</P>
<P>When the time comes for her to accept that she is running out of funds and
can no longer stay in this town, she leaves her younger  love, leaving him
in the same predicament that she was left with before she came here.  And
when she returns, her partner is there, and silently takes her and they
dance, what is obviously a very smooth combination..... still not clear
wether he is her lover or not, but it is clear that they move very well
together.</P>
<P>The film is slow, and the music is the Mexican variety used in the dance
halls, and is not what we might like to appreciate, but it is the
background, with very nice and romantic touches of what
appears to be a very well designed film about dancing..... though we wonder
if the chemistry is about sensual pleasures, or more than that.... Julia is
about more than that, as is her partner, even if they are not connected.</P>
<P>Very interesting film, slow at times, and very subtle.... all the ship names
at port have a hopeless ideal in love, and the lyrics in the many songs in
the film are shown in the sub titles as a meaningful
way for Julia to think.  Not a great film, but a very nice film that is very
slow developing, but the main character's desire and acting ability just
keeps us tied to it... and curious to find out what will
become of it all.</P>
