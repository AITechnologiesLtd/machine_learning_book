<PRE>                                DUMB AND DUMBER
                       A film review by Andrew Abramson
                        Copyright 1995 Andrew Abramson</PRE>
<P>Starring: Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels</P>
<P>     DUMB AND DUMBER was pretty good.  It wasn't as good as Jim
Carrey's first movie, ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE, but it was better
than his second, THE MASK.  Carrey plays Llyod Christmas, a really dumb
person who is poor, and goes across the country to return a suitcase to
a woman who he brought to the airport, but little does he know, the
suitcase was meant to be left there because it was full of money that
the woman put there to pay off someone who kidnapped her husband.
Daniels (Speed) plays Carrey's friend who goes across the country (to
aspen) with him.  They bring the suitcase, not opening it because Carrey
doesn't think that's polite.  By the time they reach Aspen, there poor
and out of money.  So Daniels is so fed up that he decides to open the
suitcase.  But Carrey jumps on top of him trying to stop him, but it
flies open and they see all the money.  So Carrey says "Let's just
borrow a little."  Well, they borrow just a tad bit more than they said.
They take the whole thing.  After that, there living large!!  An awesome
car, the richest hotel around, weird suits, about the best they can
get.  So they find the girl, but little does she know they have the
suitcase.  Until finally Carrey tells her and when she opens it, there's
no money.  Just little papers that say I.O.U. 1 thousand dollars, or
I.O.U. 20,000 thousand dollars.</P>
<P>     What keeps the money going, is the dumb things they do.  It's
about the dumbest humor you can get.  Toilet humor!!  If you thought
some of the thing's Carrey did in ACE VENTURA was stupid or sick, DUMB
AND DUMBER is *not* the movie for you.</P>
