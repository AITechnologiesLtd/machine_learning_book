<PRE>The Party (1968) 99m.</PRE>
<P>Peter Sellers and director Blake Edwards decided to take the Inspector 
Clouseau concept from their Pink Panther collaborations and run with it in 
this simple but funny cult comedy.  There is no real story, just a series of 
gags and routines that unfold within the confines of a swanky but dry 
Hollywood party.  Sellers removes the bumptious aspects of Clouseau and 
keeps the walking one-man-disaster premise for his creation Hrundi V. 
Bakshi, an Indian actor who finds himself accidentally invited to a 
producer's party after wreaking havoc on the set of his GUNGA DIN remake (he 
literally only gets three steps from the front door before things start 
going wrong).  Why Sellers elected to make his character Indian is a bit of 
a mystery as there is no reason for it in the story other than to make him a 
complete foreigner amongst the Hollywood set (you can spot the lines that 
were inserted to give his nationality some 'relevance').  I'd say that 
Sellers wanted to utilize his gift for mimicry and accents in a way he 
hadn't tried before, at least not for the length of a feature - for those of 
us raised on THE GOON SHOW his choice of role comes as no surprise.  It may 
be an odd choice but it works beautifully and we do not question it: if 
anything, it helps cement the notion in our mind that he and fellow outsider 
Claudine Longet (playing an aspiring French actress) belong together by the 
film's end.</P>
<P>Film has many funny gags but slides in a couple of places.  Sellers is best 
when he is on the move and liable to get himself into trouble - when he is 
seated at a dinner table halfway through the movie the action instead must 
transfer to a tipsy waiter.  Similarly, the slapstick gets more hysterical 
and less effective when Sellers disappears for much of the movie's final 
quarter - having characters repeatedly take pratfalls into a swimming pool 
is just plain lazy.  That's not to say the film still can't be enjoyed - 
it's just that you have to switch gears from watching a Peter Sellers film 
to watching a 60s time capsule (the finale has go-go dancing, a 
brightly-painted baby elephant, and a sea of soap bubbles).  Film isn't just 
for Sellers fans - kids will enjoy the gadget-laden house and relate to his 
child-like reactions to the problems he causes (he tries to hide the 
evidence or disappear from the scene).  The party hosts' house may remind 
you of the tacky, modernised home in Jacques Tati's MON ONCLE, just as 
Sellers may remind you of Tati's creation Monsieur Hulot.  Regular Edwards 
composer Henry Mancini provided the music, and yes, pop singer Longet - 
remember her kitsch-but-cute 'Love is Blue'? - does get to sing in her 
distinctive, sugary style.</P>
