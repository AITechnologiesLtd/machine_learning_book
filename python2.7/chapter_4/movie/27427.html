<PRE>                                SNATCH
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Madonna's new husband, Guy Ritchie, couldn't have timed his recent
marriage any better.  Intentional or not, it came a mere week before the
opening of his new film Snatch, the follow-up to his Lock, Stock & Two
Smoking Barrels.  With Madonna as a willing shill, you couldn't ask for
better publicity.</P>
<P>     Turns out you didn't need it, Guy.  Snatch is a film that stands
perfectly on its own merits while it shoots bullet holes in everything
in sight.</P>
<P>     A more violent film you aren't likely to see this year (and yes, I
realize it's only January).  In the vein of Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting,
and Fight Club, Snatch is a gritty dance with the criminal element,
revolving around a stolen 86-karat diamond that any good crook would
give his right arm for.  (And in one case, I mean that literally.)</P>
<P>     After a boggling series of double-crosses, triple-crosses, and
multi-crosses, Snatch becomes a game of who will end up with the gem --
and how will they get it?  Ritchie keeps us guessing at every turn, with
Russians hiring mercenary crooks to steal the jewel, hit men sent to
kill the mercenaries, mobsters trying to outwit the hit men, Jewish
jewelers scheming to undermine the mobsters, a crazed bare-knuckled
boxer looking for his payday despite the chaos, and one dog who's lost
his bark.</P>
<PRE>     And every one of these stories is hilarious.</PRE>
<P>     It's Ritchie's incredible, perfectly matched cast that makes the
film work so well.  It's hard to say who is best: Alan Ford's menacing
Brick Top, who feeds his victims to his pigs when they cross him; Vinnie
Jones (Gone in 60 Seconds) as Bullet Tooth Tony, a hunter/assassin who
chills his prey with deadly stares; Benicio Del Toro's
caught-in-the-middle robber/gambling addict; Dennis Farina's Anglophobe
jeweler; or any of two dozen other apt actors who fully own their
roles.  In the end, though, you have to give a hand to Brad Pitt, still
buff from Fight Club, as a mush-mouthed Gypsy boxer who always manages
to get one step ahead of the crowd.</P>
<P>     Cut these guys together with a zippy story (that doesn't always
feel like it makes sense, but no matter) and a jazzy-techno soundtrack
(plus Mrs. Ritchie's "Lucky Star"), and there's nothing to dislike
here.  Even Ritchie's over-aggressive filmmaking never gets that
tiresome, though he runs through the entire pantheon of MTV camera
tricks: slow motion, fast motion, stop motion, reverse motion, low
angles, high angles, upside down camerawork, and more.</P>
<P>     Of course, Snatch does not secretly harbor a touching tale of
redemption, a theme of crooks who go straight, or any other sort of guts
that might make us think differently about the world when we leave the
movie theater.  In fact, it's not really about anything.  Unlike
contemporaries like Pulp Fiction and Trainspotting, with their messages
hidden away amongst all the action, Snatch is just a good time.  That's
not a bad thing, just don't try telling me that Snatch is deep.</P>
<PRE>     Er, you know what I mean.</PRE>
