<PRE>                           MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  This could have been a story about
     racism, it could have been a film with historical scope, it
     could have been a film about courage in wartime or an anti-
     war movie, it might have been about an engaging love triangle
     story, it might have been a study of contrasting cultures,
     but in trying to be all those things this murky film is not
     enough of any of them.  (Warning: this review tells more plot
     than I usually do as the film is otherwise difficult to
     describe.  For most readers I don't believe I will be
     damaging the enjoyment of the film.)  Rating: 0 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     With THE NAVIGATOR, New Zealand director Vincent Ward showed he had an
unusual photographic style, some interesting ideas, and an occasional
mystical impulse.  They all worked fairly well in that small film.  MAP OF
THE HUMAN HEART is a big film, but Louis Nowra's screenplay from Ward's own
story assumes it is bigger than it actually is and that Ward's direction can
deliver more than it actually can.</P>
<P>     Avik (played by Robert Joamie as a child and Jason Scott Lee as an
adult) is an Inuit--or as he says, an Eskimo--who meets a cartographer and
tells him his life story.  As a boy in 1931, his life was changed when
another cartographer, Walter Russell (played by Patrick Bergin) came to his
people's land to survey for maps.  Russell is impressed with the boy's
curiosity and deeply affected when he discovers that the boy has
tuberculosis.  Russell arranges to take to take the boy to a Montreal
Catholic hospital and school, flying the boy in the open biplane the
cartographer came in.  One taste of flying and the young Inuit is hooked for
life.</P>
<P>     At the hospital Avik is traumatized by all the scientific equipment.
He is mistreated by the nuns, who are portrayed as extremely bigoted against
Protestants and "half-breeds."  Avik forms a close relationship with
Albertine (played by Annie Galipeau as a child and Anne Parillaud as an
adult).  He is half white, half Inuit; she is half white, half Indian.  They
are torn apart by the nuns.  In 1941 events draw Avik into the RAF and he,
Russell, and Albertine will cross paths again.</P>
<P>     This is a film with at least two or three very memorable scenes--one
over the Albert Hall, one involving a barrage balloon, and a horrifying
sequence set in Germany--but it still leaves loose ends and is unsatisfying.
Patrick Bergin's last scene comes totally out of left field and seems to
belong more to a surrealistic satire.  The scenes of air warfare are of a
unique style that perhaps gives them the feel of real Army-Air Force World
War II documentaries: the scenes are murky and more than once scenes seemed
out of focus.</P>
<P>     This was a film I was anxious to see and tried very hard to enjoy, but
I have to say that it really did not work for me.  This British-Australian-
French-Canadian-Japanese co-production is a hodge-podge of too little of too
much.  I give it a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
