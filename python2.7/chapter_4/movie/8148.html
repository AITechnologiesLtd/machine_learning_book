<PRE>                             MEN IN BLACK
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: MEN IN BLACK is a smart, funny
          tabloid-paranoia comedy about the hard-boiled G-men
          who keep a lid the government's biggest secret.
          That is the "fact" that not just one but many alien
          races visit the Earth--mostly New York City--and
          use it as an interstellar border-town and duty-free
          shop.  Humor and (impressive) special effects
          rarely mix this well on the screen.  Rating: +2 (-4
          to +4), 7 (0 to 10)</PRE>
<P>     Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment has turned a dubious
premise into a delightful science fiction comedy.  Taking much the same
premise as TV's DARK SKIES, but handling it very differently, MEN IN
BLACK tells the story of special, super-secret government agents
charged with the responsibility for keeping the secret that at any
given time there are about 1500 space aliens running around on Earth,
natives of hundreds of different inhabited worlds.  Most are friendly,
but of course wherever there are lots of aliens there will always be a
few rotten apples who want to vaporize the planet Earth for the greater
glory of someone with a name like Zordalg.  New York cop James Edwards
(played by Will Smith) knows nothing of this, of course.  He just knows
that something is strange when he runs down a felon with funny eyes.
This feat earns him a candidacy for some unspecified government job
that turns out to be joining the Men in Black.  Once chosen he is re-
dubbed Agent J working with the experienced and cagey Agent K (Tommy
Lee Jones).</P>
<P>     Ed Solomon's script, based on the comic book by Lowell Cunningham,
is a barrage of funny lines and scenes of just how strange things can
be dealing with aliens.  But all that is about the background for the
real plot.  The actual story gets very little screentime comparatively.
The film is short as it is at 98 minutes and most of that time is taken
up with the background.  The actual story deals with two alien races
fighting over the fate of a galaxy.  One race is represented by an old
Jewish man controlled by good-guy aliens.  The other is an evil giant
bug who possesses the body of the redneck Edgar.  Vincent D'Onofrio
plays the possessed Edgar, but like most people would be the first time
behind the wheel of an 18-wheel truck, the creature just cannot get the
hang of the controls.  D'Onofrio is usually a serious actor, as he was
in THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD, but here he shows a real genius for physical
comedy.  He manages to walk his human body around, but not one body
part moves naturally.  Because so much of the film is taken up with
introduction to the premise this feels like the first film of series or
perhaps a pilot for a film series.  And if public enthusiasm remains
high, sequels of some form seem inevitable.  Director Barry Sonnenfeld
is best known for directing the two Addams Family films and GET SHORTY.
His Addams Family series was cut short by the death of Raoul Julia, but
he now has another chance in much the same vein with MEN IN BLACK.</P>
<P>     A manic film deserves a manic musical score, and manic scores are
a specialty of Danny Elfman.  It combines with good special effects and
Rick Baker makeup and effects.  In sum, MEN IN BLACK may well be one of
the best films of this summer's fly-weight class.  I give it a +2 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
