Reviewed July 6, 1999. </P>
<P>Period movies set south of 1940 rarely ever interest me. Most of them seem 
very similar, with lots of fancy costumes and characters who always say one 
thing but mean another, or don't even say something to begin with. Some 
certainly work (Martin Scorcese's ravishing 1993 drama, "The Age of 
Innocence" and 1998's Best Picture Oscar winner, "Shakespeare in Love"), but 
most of them end with me more often than not saying to myself, "so what?"</P>
<P>Leave it up to director Oliver Parker's "An Ideal Husband," based loosely on 
famed 19th-century writer Oscar Wilde's play, to prove that all a period film 
needs to jump vibrantly to life is a remarkable cast. This picture sure has 
lucked out with this group of actors, who make up one of the most flawless 
and talented ensembles I've seen at the movies in a long time. Luckily, the 
screenplay, adapted by Parker, has also translated Wilde's token charm and 
wit to the screen successfully, even if the particulars of the story have 
been slightly altered.</P>
<P>Set in England, circa the 1890's, the prominently wealthy politician (Jeremy 
Northam) is paid an unwelcome visit by Lady Cheveley (Julianne Moore), 
visiting for a week from Vienna, who reveals that she has obtained a letter 
that reveals the untruthful way in which he got his large sum of money: he 
once passed on key information to a German count concerning the Suez Canal. 
Not only would this info, if it were to get out, destroy Sir Robert, but it 
would also devastate his lovely wife, Lady Chiltern (Cate Blanchett), who 
believes she is married to a completely honest man. An ultimatum is given by 
Lady Cheveley, however: if he will endorse a highly controversial upcoming 
waterway project in Argentina, she will give him back the letter. Coming to 
his aid is Sir Robert's best friend, Lord Goring (Rupert Everett), a 
self-involved, but alluring 36-year-old man whom has an admirer in Robert's 
younger sister, Mabel (Minnie Driver), and who, secretly, was once engaged to 
the scheming Lady Cheveley. </P>
<P>The complicated premise of "An Ideal Husband" might have been needlessly 
daunting for such a lightweight comedy, but somehow it never once becomes 
confusing, as we instantly are absorbed into this group of characters' lives 
and relationships. And every character, by the way, is genuinely fascinating 
and likable, even the "bad girl" of the piece, Lady Cheveley. At first 
playing as simply the catalyst that spins the plot into motion, Cheveley 
could have easily become the stock villain in the film, but is eventually 
revealed to possibly have a warmer heart than we first may have anticipated. 
The always-radiant Julianne Moore doesn't miss even the most subtle nuance 
throughout, obviously having a lot of fun with her character. Moore certainly 
had a difficult task of turning Lady Cheveley into someone who wasn't wholly 
despicable, but amazingly, she never is. </P>
<P>The main character in the film, Lord Goring, who seemingly doesn't have much 
to do with the predicament at hand but somehow becomes more deeply embroiled 
in the conflict than anyone else, is played to the classy, eloquent hilt by 
Rupert Everett, a wonderful talent who deserves more richly textured roles 
like the one he has in this film. Playfully showing off his own infatuation 
for himself, Goring says in the scene in which we first meet him, "To love 
oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance." Even when Goring is saying 
such conceited things, none of the characters can do anything but be swept 
off their feet by him, even though that never is his true intention.</P>
<P>After her Oscar-nominated role in 1998's Elizabeth" (which was the only 
saving grace of that mediocre film) and her truly diverse turn in last 
spring's "Pushing Tin," Cate Blanchett is quickly becoming one of our 
biggest, freshest talents. Her Lady Chiltern clearly cares for her husband 
(also well-played by Northam), but sometimes evidence comes before us that 
questions just what she loves about him. Does she really love the real him, 
or is she enamored more by the thought of his perfect innocence and idealism? 
Aside from the hidden complexities of her character, Blanchett also is given 
ample chance to show offer her comic talents, and is particularly funny, 
especially in a late scene in which she herself must hide something from her 
husband.</P>
<P>Finally, Minnie Driver is glorious as usual, looking more like Minnie Mouse 
than usual. This isn't an insult, believe me, but merely an observation of 
her unique, but certain, beauty. Driver, at first, is asked to do nothing 
more than give admiring glances toward Lord Goring, but instantly comes into 
her own despite this, and is especially given more substantial things to do 
in the last half-hour.</P>
<P>Entertaining is the perfect adjective to describe "An Ideal Husband." Since 
the story and, subsequently, the winning screenplay are cleverly designed and 
written, and the actors demonstrate such a delight in their respective 
performances, the film breaks out of the usual mold of "period movies" to 
become a picture that, more or less, could be set in any decade of any 
century. Aside from there being at least two or three false endings too many 
that left me getting ready to see the end credits only to have another plot 
development form, "An Ideal Husband" is an absolute joy from start to finish. 
In a summer filled with many flashier, bigger, and more brainless films, this 
is one to seek out.</P>
