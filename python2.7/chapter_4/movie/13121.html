<P>   It may not be better after all to have loved and lost than
never to have loved at all.  The stunning Russian movie,
"The Thief," swept the 1997 NIKA Awards (that's the
Russian Oscars) and was the nominee of that country for a
1997 American Oscar.  In it a young man recalls a series of
incidents which occurred when he was six years old, an
episode which transformed his existence and would leave him
a lifetime of emotional scars.  Set amid a backdrop of Russian
towns shortly after World War 2 during the regime of Josef
Stalin, "The Thief" focuses tightly on three people--an
adorably expressive six year old boy, Sanya (Misha
Philipchuk), his beautiful young mother Katya (Ekaterina
Rednikova) and a dashing stranger who comes between
them, Tolyan (Vladirimir Mashkov).</P>
<P>   As a result of the war, twenty million Russian died while
many who survived on the home front had to make do leading
hardscrabble lives without a breadwinner in the home.  Katya
and Sanya are two such unfortunates, essentially homeless
people who aimlessly ride the rails in 1952, just one year
before Stalin's death.  When a charismatic soldier, Tolyan,
appears as a seatmate, Katya is immediately captivated by
his looks and charm while seeing him as well as a future
provider for her and her six-year-old child.  For his part
Sanya, who has no memory of a father who died before he
was born, at first resents the attention the stranger draws
from his mom but shortly grows to idolize this substitute dad. 
Save for a single flaw, Tolyan is the ideal lover and father. 
He teaches the boy how to fight while presenting the young
woman with jewelry, a place to stay, and an outlet for her
considerable passion.  But the title character is a con artist--a
thief who uses his ersatz family as a front to gain entry to
other people's apartments in order to rob them blind.</P>
<P>    "The Thief" is in the tradition of Jan Sverak's glorious 1996
movie "Kolya," about a bachelor who finds himself suddenly
entrusted with the care of a precocious five-year-old boy and
matures under the process.  In the case of the Russian
movie, the title character seems to change not at all while the
impressionable blond boy takes in and is recast by everything
that passes his line of vision and then some.  But it is Katya
who is put to the test, and director Pavel Chukhrai achingly
evokes the conflict which torments her.  She unearths her
lover's true profession and is determined to leave the
scoundrel, but finds that she is as unable to uproot herself as
Samuel Beckett's iconic characters, Vladimir and Estragon.  </P>
<P>   Beautifully photographed by Vladimir Klimov and utilizing
Victor Petrov's strikingly authentic set to resemble a railway
car of the 1950s, "The Thief" provides us with a broad sweep
of Russian everymen as well as its principal performers.  The
residents of the communal apartments are a motley crew of
plump old landlady types, attractive ladies who might have
come out of an American movie of the 40's, and mustachioed
caricatures of men. Most possess so little opportunity for
entertainment that they glory in a performance of the circus or
in a concert of two silly-looking vocalists backed up by a small
band.  All the action of "The Thief" leads to an inevitable,
unhappy payoff, one which sensitive viewers in the audience
might wish had never occurred.  </P>
<P>   The Black Sea resort area in which Russian workers were
given free vacations by the state compares favorably to petit
bourgeois places in American and Europe, the small towns
with their decaying monuments reflecting a culture whose
entire budget seems to have gone into the war effort.</P>
<P>   The picture is told from the point of view of young Sanya
who is played by the then eight-year-old Misha Philipchuk,
who was chosen in an open cast call from his school.  He's
the sort of kid everyone wishes he had, but beware!  Cross
him, and you'd better watch your back.  A lovely lovely
picture.</P>
