<PRE>                             BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Disney's animated feature films are, in
     my opinion, over-rated.  They lack plot and complexity.
     Their emotional impact is limited.  The usual excuse is that
     they are only supposed to be simple children's films.  BEAUTY
     AND THE BEAST demonstrates that a lot more can be done in
     this medium.  It beats BAMBI, CINDERELLA, SNOW WHITE,
     SLEEPING BEAUTY, and all of the other classics, including
     FANTASIA.  Parents should go with their kids.  If you don't
     have kids, go anyway.  This one may not be on cassette this
     century.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     I rather surprised myself with BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  When I was young,
I liked the Disney feature cartoons as little entertainments, but after age
ten or so I found the stories a little uninteresting.  Eventually I could
respect the detail in the technique, but even then I was rarely impressed
with their imagination.  Yes, they had attention to detail and if I knew
what to look for, I liked that.  But, with the exception of the dragon
sequence from SLEEPING BEAUTY and the "Night on Bald Mountain" sequence from
FANTASIA, there was not much beyond lukewarm imagination.  And the stories
were really uninteresting.  And being a realist about my own looks, I have
long been a little irritated at the subtext that equates physical beauty and
ugliness to evil.  With all that to set up my attitude, it is hardly
surprising that I would come away from BEAUTY AND THE BEAST genuinely
believing it is the best animated feature film ever to come from Disney
Studios.  And that includes that beloved intellectual fraud FANTASIA.</P>
<P>     The plot of the film maintains Disney's usual standard for fidelity to
the original story.  This means, of course, that if you read Madame de
Villeneuve's story and then saw the film, you would be likely to see
similarities and probably would believe that the story did somehow inspire
the film.  (Those anxious to read the story faithfully told can find it in
Andrew Lang's BLUE FAIRY BOOK.)  Some bits were more likely inspired by Jean
Cocteau's film LA BELLE ET LA BETE.  Belle, if not a real intellectual, is
at least a reader.  In fact, she seems to love books more than boys, so is
thought to be weird.  (Bravo for her!)  But Belle has a semi-secret admirer.
Gaston is handsome, big, and strong.  He is also obnoxious, insufferably
conceited, sexist, and selfish.  Gaston is supremely macho and the film
subtly makes the statement that to be macho is to be beastlike.  All of
Gaston's virtues that he tells us about are really just descriptions of a
beast.  He is big, he kills animals, he is covered with hair.  There are a
bevy of young women from the town who swoon over the beastly qualities of
Gaston.  Belle, however, is unimpressed and wants nothing to do with Gaston.
Then events conspire (or contrive) to make her the prisoner in an enchanted
castle ruled over by a real beast--or at least an apparently real beast.  He
has all of Gaston's qualities in a more extreme form.  The Beast is super-
macho, but knows that it is a curse both literally and figuratively.  Belle
wants no part of the Beast until he starts to win her over.  How does he
start to win her over?  In a manner--time-honored in Disney films--for
beasts to win over people.  I won't say how, but anyone who has seen OLD
YELLER will find the situation familiar.  The story is well-told, though
almost entirely revisionist.</P>
<P>     Some mention should be made of the castle's enchantment, since many of
the film characters exist as a direct result of that enchantment.  Once
touch that Cocteau put in his film version that was not in the original
story was that the walls of the castle had ornamental torch-holders that
looked like human arms holding the torches.  These ornamental holders have a
life of their own.  The Disney film extends this to most of the furnishings
of the castle, giving them also voices and personalities.  At moments this
almost has a Philip K. Dick sort of horror, when someone drinking from a tea
cup finds the cup is talking to him.  The personalities are genial, however,
and the potential horror is quickly muted.</P>
<P>     Visually this film is at least up to and probably better than what we
think of as the classic Disney feature cartoons.  Snow White and Sleeping
Beauty were drawn as sweet and cheerful as a bluebird but perhaps not quite
as smart.  They were characters for years when innocence was prized over
intelligence.  Belle has apricot-sized eyes and high cheekbones, but also a
range of facial expression far greater than the classic animation heroines.
There is clearly more going on in her head than in those of her previous
counterparts.  Whether it was done before without acknowledgement, or is a
new approach, a different team animates each of the major characters.  James
Baxter headed the team which animated Belle and Paige O'Hara voiced the
characters.</P>
<P>     The Beast is a strange concoction combining elements of a mandrill, a
bison, a lion, and the American werewolf in London.  Glen Kean was is chief
animator for the Beast.  The voice casting director (I am sorry I do not
have his name) listened on tape to several dozen voices for special
characteristics.  He said in an interview that he himself was surprised to
hear the qualities he wanted in the voice of Robbie Benson.  I share his
surprise and his conviction that Benson's voice does work for the Beast.</P>
<P>     In general, the art and animation are impressively done.  These days
effort goes into every background painting.  One place I noted poor
technique and it took me some time to get the joke.  While Disney artists
usually take pains to make each character different, the three village maids
who fawn on Gaston are really one character drawn three times.  They were
then animated in a perfunctory two-dimensional style.  Perhaps the
filmmakers were subtly saying that women impressed by macho are just not
worth much effort.</P>
<P>     The songs are by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who also wrote the
songs for THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS (one piece is reminiscent of a piece
from LITTLE SHOP) and THE LITTLE MERMAID.  Overall, the music is better than
that of THE LITTLE MERMAID.  The remainder of the film's music was by
Menken.  Ashman served as executive producer.  A note at the end dedicates
the film to Howard Ashman, who died of AIDS eight months before the release
of the film.</P>
<P>     There is some irony in the fact that Don Bluth left Disney animation
studios because they were not doing animation films in their own grand
tradition and now they may be doing them better.  In BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
Disney Studios has given me something it has not given me in a long time: an
animated feature film I want to see again.  I rate it a +2 on the -4 to +4
scale.  Amazing.</P>
