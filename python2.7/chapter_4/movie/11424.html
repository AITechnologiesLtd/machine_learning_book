<PRE>The Snapper (1993)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 78</PRE>
<P>"The Snapper" is a BBC made-for-television production.
The depiction of a contemporary Irish family has an
excellent (and surprisingly graphic) script by obscure
novelist Roddy Doyle, and there are enough plot complications
to keep things interesting.</P>
<P>"The Snapper" is Irish slang for a baby.  The film stars
Colm Meaney (best known for his work on two "Star Trek"
series) as the blustering head of an Irish household that
includes his wife and several children.  Tina Kellegher
plays his daughter, an unmarried young woman who has become
pregnant.</P>
<P>The small town delights in gossiping about who the father
is, until it is revealed that he is an aging, overweight
milquetoast.  The resulting derision causes stress between
father and daughter, that may compel Kellegher to leave home
against her family's wishes.</P>
<P>Judging from the script, Ireland is much more relaxed
than America about the subject of sex.  A group of young
women harass a younger male waiter, and frankly discuss
their sexual adventures.  The word "bitch" is so frequently
used that it can be taken as a compliment.  When the
unwed Kellegher becomes pregnant, her popularity actually increases.
She is only ostracized when the father turns out not to
be a sleek local stud, but a married man nearly old enough
to be her grandfather.  When Meaney finds out, his first
reaction is "Jesus, that bastard's older than I am!"</P>
<P>Another cultural difference is that the Irish seem
to drink heavily.  Meaney visits the pub nearly every
night, and Kellegher gets plastered at a bar even though
she is nine months pregnant.  When her brother pukes in the
kitchen sink (filled with dishes) after a binge, all
father has to say is that he expects him to do the dishes
afterwards.</P>
<P>I enjoyed all the petty squabbling and selfishness among the
family members.  Unlike "The Waltons", this is likely how most
larger families behave.  "The Snapper" is a drama that succeeds
even more as a comedy.</P>
