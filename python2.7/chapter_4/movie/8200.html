<PRE>Contact (1997)
Viewed Friday,  July 11 1997</PRE>
<P>I have been reading the postings on the new film Contact in this
newsgroup over the past few days. They sparked my curiosity to such an
extent that I decided to see the film. When I heard some comparing
Contact with 2001: A Space Odyssey I knew that I would without a doubt
be in the theater on opening night. I've just returned home after
seeing it and decided to sit down at my computer and give my own
thoughts on the subject. </P>
<P>One thing that surprised me was the audience's reaction to Contact.
For the entire two and one half hours it was so quiet that you could
almost hear a pin drop. I had not witnessed such a reaction in a
packed house since I saw Oliver Stone's JFK in a theater a few years
ago. Regardless of what the rest of the audience thought of the film
after it was over, I know for a fact that it held their undivided
attention for its entire running time, which is no small
accomplishment in this day and age.</P>
<P>My personal reaction to the film is very positive overall. It is not
the science fiction masterpiece that 2001 is (then again, what is?),
but it is an intelligent hardcore science fiction film. In this
post-Star Wars age of fantasy science fiction, it is very refreshing
to see a well made hard science fiction film. I would place Contact on
the same level as the original Planet of the Apes or perhaps The
Andromeda Strain for example. None of these films are cinematic
masterpieces, but they are all significant films in the genre of hard
science fiction, and this is how I feel Contact will ultimately be
viewed when all is said and done. For those who need a rating scale, I
give it a seven out of a possible ten.</P>
<P>One of the criticisms I read before seeing the film was that many
characters in the movie were one dimensional cardboard cutouts, pure
types rather than actual people. This is indeed true. I do not wish to
argue the aesthetic worth of such characterizations, but I do believe
that they are in the story to make certain points. Points I believe
that Carl Sagan was trying to get across in his original novel. The
actor Tom Skerritt plays the role of David Drumlin, the head of the
National Science Foundation. He is Jodie Foster's chief scientific
nemesis. He cuts Foster's government funding, forcing her character to
turn to private business to continue her research, but when the signal
does arrive from space, he jumps into the public spotlight to take all
of the glory. This character illustrates the sad fact that many
scientists are backstabbing egotistical assholes. Just as any human
institution, the scientific community can be just as petty and power
hungry as any other group. As a professional scientist myself I can
attest to the reality of Skerritt's character , as I am sure Sagan
could have as well. James Woods's character, Michael Kitz, plays the
same type of role in the form of a National Security advisor. Woods's
character illustrates the negative aspects of world governments, just
as Skerritt's character illustrates the negative aspects of the
scientific community. </P>
<P>Jodie Foster herself does a good job in her role as Eleanor Arroway.
She doesn't give a great performance, but it's not a bad performance
either. It's pretty much typical Jodie Foster. I can definitely see
why she was attracted to the role. Her character is the heart of the
film and is in nearly every single scene. Her character is also a
strong willed and determined woman, which seems to be Ms Foster's
particular cup of tea judging from her roles of late. Matthew
McConaughey, however, does not come off nearly as well. He plays
Foster's love interest Palmer Joss, and this character also turns into
a nationally known new age religious leader in the course of the film.
I do not think that Mr McConaughery ever really got a hold of his
character because I never believed his performance for a second.
McConaughery is an attractive rising male star, and that is probably
the chief reason he got the role. This is the one typical Hollywood
mistake in a film that is otherwise devoid of such errors and clichés.</P>
<P>Far and away my favorite character in the film is S.R. Hadden, played
by John Hurt. I have been a fan of Hurt ever since he burst upon the
scene playing Caligula in PBS's version of I Claudius back in the
1970's, and it has been awhile since I've seen him used as effectively
as he is in this film. Hadden is an extremely wealthy international
businessman, a former engineer who is now the head of a world wide
telecommunication corporation. He is a rich eccentric who brings to
mind images of Howard Hughes and (should I dare say) Charles Foster
Kane. He is introduced in the film in a very ominous manner, and one
is led to believe that he is another villain on the same order of
Skerritt's and Woods's characters, but in the end he turns out to be
sort of a Daddy Warbucks to Jodie Foster's Annie. It is Hadden who
continues to fund Foster's research after government funding is
pulled, and he is also responsible for Foster's character being the
one chosen to be the first person to make contact with another
intelligent life form. Hurt plays his character to the hilt and steals
every scene he is in. I only wish there had been more of them.</P>
<P>The climax of the film, where Jodie Foster's character actually
travels "to the infinite and beyond" is, as would naturally be
expected, very reminiscent of the ending to 2001. Not to give too much
away, both films have basically the same idea. If one were to have
contact with a superior intelligence, that intelligence will try to
communicate to us in a manner it hopes we will understand.
Contact takes the same tact as 2001 in this regard, but the chief
difference here is that Contact's vision of first contact is much more
literal than Stanley's vision was, which is one of the main reasons
why 2001 is a masterpiece and Contact is merely a good science fiction
film.</P>
<P>I find it very refreshing to see a summer Hollywood film that does not
insult the intelligence of its audience. Instead of explosions, car
chases and mind numbing soundtracks here is a film that focuses on
human interaction and demands as much from the audience as it gives.
Unfortunately this will also be its undoing. Too many of today's film
goers expect sensation over substance and are usually extremely upset
when asked to think while seeing a movie. Word of mouth will probably
kill Contact's ticket sales as the summer weeks progress. A film that
quotes Ockham's razor twice is just asking for poor box office. This
is a real shame because Contact does have a very important message
that it is trying to say.</P>
<P>What exactly is Contact's message? On a superficial level the film
does deal with the religion versus science debate, but to me the
meaning of the film lies much deeper. Ultimately I believe that the
true message of Contact is a pessimistic one. Two scenes resonate in
my mind after seeing the film. The first shows Foster returning to her
radio tracking station in New Mexico after the word has got out that a
signal has been received. She drives through miles of tourists,
crackpots and thrill seekers who have arrived at the station as
thought it were a shrine, just like we have seen in Roswell New Mexico
over that past few weeks. The other scene occurs near the end of the
film. Foster's character is leaving Congress and she sees hundreds of
"fans" on the capital lawn. Along the steps on either side of her path
to the car are people in wheel chairs lined up to touch her in the
hopes of being miraculously healed. Since her return from her trip to
the stars a cult has begun to grow around her possible powers. These
two scenes, along with the negative way in which politics and the
politics of science are portrayed, suggest that mankind is not really
mature enough as yet to enter the intergalactic Parthenon. With all
our pettiness, fears, and superstitions mankind is still not quite
ready to make contact.</P>
