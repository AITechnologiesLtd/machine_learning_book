<PRE>Halloween
A review by Joe Chamberlain
Starring Donald Peasence; Jamie Lee Curtis; Nancy Kyes; P.J. Soles & Charles
Cyphers</PRE>
<P>I first saw Halloween when I was in junior high, which was more than a
decade ago. To this day the theme song still gives me chills. By far,
Halloween has the best soundtrack of any horror film ever made, with the
possible exception of Psycho. Much like the other early slasher films such
as Friday The 13th or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween wasn't made on what
you would call a big budget. Unlike the other films of that era, Halloween
had one extra thing going for it, director John Carpenter. Carpenter makes
use of what limited money he had, down to the last penny. That is not to say
that Halloween always looks great, but in the places where the shoestring
budget shows itself it only adds to the charm. Carpenter probably also saved
money by not only directing the movie, but by writing it, and composing all
of the music. Fortunately for we the audience, Carpenter excels in all three
areas. The other leg up that Halloween has on the other early slashers is
its cast. Sure it has its share of acting class failures, but they aren't
bad enough to detract from Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence.</P>
<P>Young Michael Myers, at the age of nine, decided to give new meaning to
trick or treat on Halloween night by killing his sister with a butcher
knife. He is confined to a mental hospital where he is placed in the care of
Doctor Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence). 15 years to the day that he killed his
sister, Michael escapes from the institution to return to his hometown of
Haddonfield and resume his killing. He is pursued by Dr. Loomis and the
local police, but before they can catch him he resumes his love for large
cutlery by using it on some of the local teen population. One of the locals
who run into big Mike on Halloween is Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) who
happen to be baby sitting in the wrong place at the wrong time. It should
come as no surprise that mayhem and carnage ensue.</P>
<P>As I said, the budget wasn't big, so don't expect Star Wars quality
production values in this film. With most of the cast (or if you prefer,
victims in waiting) the acting is passable. Pleasence does a great job at
being creepy, and Jamie Lee Curtis, even with the bad seventies hair and the
bell bottoms is a hottie. She also does a pretty good job in the acting
department, considering that this was her first role. The story is pretty
good considering this is a slasher flick. It is even more interesting if you
also watch the sequel that gives a bit more of the back story.</P>
<P>No review of Halloween would be complete without the requisite fun fact
about this movie. Take a good look at Michael Myers white mask that he wears
throughout his killing spree. You may just notice that it is actually a
William Shatner (that's right Trekkies, good old Captain Kirk himself)
Halloween mask painted white. Other fun bloopers include the fact that the
film is supposed to be set in Illinois but all of the cars have California
license plates. I would recommend Halloween to anyone who wants a good
scare, despite the fact that it looks very dated in places. One other
recommendation that I would make is that if at all possible watch Halloween
and its sequel at the same time as they take place within hours of each
other.</P>
