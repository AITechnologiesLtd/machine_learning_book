<P> As of this writing, the Oscars for Best whatever in 1997 have not
yet been named but I would hope that the 1998 Best Actor nominations
will include John Travolta for his performance as Governor Jack
Stanton in PRIMARY COLORS.   For that matter, there are many solid
performances by every supporting actor in that very solid and most
entertaining movie.   None of that is or should come as a surprise
of course as the screenplay is by Elaine may, and the direction by
Mike Nichols, a proven combination.</P>
<P> In a satire with more truth than poetry, the film is ostensibly
about Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign for the presidency but is much
more than that.  For one thing, it shows what kind of a person has
the stamina, the charm, the determination to know what to do to win
. . . and then to let nothing stop him. This is true of most all the
Presidents in the past.</P>
<P> As portrayed by Travolta, Clinton exudes charm.   It is easy to see
why people would like him.  It is also easy to see how the speeches
he makes on his campaign trail are designed to please the kind of
audience he is addressing. . . and is that not a fact of life in
campaigning?  Tell a working class group that your mother worked in
a factory "just as you do so I know what it is like."   Tell a
Jewish group that you are a great supporter of Israel. Tell an
elderly group that your opponent (not necessarily true) wants to
tamper with Social Security.</P>
<P> Back in 1993, the documentary THE WAR ROOM gave a good indication
of what campaigning and elections are all about.   One thing that
boggled my mind was that after the election, James Carville,
Clinton's campaign manager, married Mary Matlin who was second in
command of the Bush campaign. During the campaign she called Clinton
"a prevaricator, a draft dodger and a philanderer."   That tells us
something about the sincerity of all involved and Primary Colors
shows it in even brighter hues.</P>
<P> In addition to Travolta, outstanding performances were given by
newcomer to the American scene but well known for his work on the
London stage, Adrian Lester in his role as Henry Burton, the
campaign manager.   Susan Stanton, (Emma Thompson) the Governor's
wife, is portrayed as having a one track mind: win the election
with no regard for how.  She wants to be the First Lady and nothing
will be allowed to stop that from happening.  Next is Libby Holden
(Kathy Bates) as the tough private confidante of the governor.
Bates is great!</P>
<P> Others in the cast are political advisor Richard Jemmons (Billy Bob
Thornton) and Freddy Picker, (Larry Hagman) a former governor of
Florida, whose one secret indiscretion many years ago can devastate
his attempt to beat Stanton if the Stanton campaign team wishes to
make the news public. Cameos by Rob Reiner, Diane Ladd, Robert
Klein, Geraldo Rivera, Charlie Rose and Larry King.</P>
<P> The film is based on the novel by Joe Klein who kept his identity
hidden for a while by having the author listed as "Anonymous."
Obviously, he was an insider in Washington and knew the scene very
well.</P>
<P> PRIMARY COLORS is entertaining and informative, telling it as it is
with few, if any, holds barred.   Go see it!</P>
