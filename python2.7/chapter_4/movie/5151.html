<PRE>                              MULHOLLAND FALLS
                       A film review by Scott Marcus

<P>     One word review: unsatisfactory. This is a movie that that could
have been much more than it is. From top to bottom, the cast is good.
Every part, large or small, is filled with a name actor. None of the
performances stand out as either extremely good or extremely bad.  The
dialogue is okay, though it tries to be more hip than it should,
considering that the film takes place in post-World War II LA
MULHOLLAND FALLS tries to be too much; it alternates  between the
gritty, conspiratorial atmosphere of CHINATOWN, and the in- your-face
violence of PULP FICTION, and it can never make up its mind about which
to be.</P>
<P>     Just how many Baldwins are out there, anyway? In this film, one
that I havent seen yet pops up; in every movie I see, it seems that
another unfamiliar Baldwin shows up. Its almost like deja vu, as they
all sound alike, and resemble one another; it just remains to figure
out if Ive seen this one before.</P>
<P>     Four cops, Nick Nolte, Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris
Penn, make up a special unit in the LA police force. They are charged
with keeping LA clean for the upstanding citizens the city needs wants
to attract. A young girl shows up murdered, under vaguely strange
circumstances. It turns out that one of the cops is acquainted with the
victim, and solving the homicide becomes the focus of the film.</P>
<P>     Along the way, there are pornographic home movies, villainous Army
officers, obnoxious FBI agents, atomic bomb tests, and hats--lots of
extremely stylistic hats. Style seems to be the main reason the film is
set in the late 40s or early 50s; so that the group of buddy-cops can
drive around LA in period outfits with neat-looking hats, and exchange
witty banter.</P>
<P>     The four main characters, the cops who make up the special unit,
are definitely the most interesting part of the film. When theyre
together, MULHOLLAND FALLS works. None of the other characters, with
the possible exception of General Timms (John Malkovich) is very
interesting. The murder victim, Allison (Jennifer Connelly), seen in
flashbacks, is beautiful (and she has some rather impressive
attributes), comes the closest to holding our attention--but thats
probably only because Im a heterosexual male. Melanie Griffith, Treat
Williams and Andrew McCarthys characters are all uninteresting, despite
being fairly well developed. The story is nothing special; the solving
of the murder, while ostensibly the point of the film, becomes almost
an afterthought.</P>
<P>     This is a near-miss; with a little sharper plotting, and more time
spent with the four cops, MULHOLLAND FALLS could have a very good film.
As it is, it is only slightly worthwhile.</P>
