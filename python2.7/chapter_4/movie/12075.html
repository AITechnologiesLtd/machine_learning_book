<PRE>CITY OF ANGELS
**1/2 of **** grade is C</PRE>
<P>City Of Angels has a few problems that left me feeling very mad.  I was
mad because the rest of the film is very well done, and well acted.  The
story is light, and so well told thgat you almost forgive these errors. 
I didn't.</P>
<P>The story has Nic Cage, an angel, falling in love with Meg Ryan, a
doctor, and when he appears to her she falls for him.  Along the way
Cage meets a guy named Mesenger, played by NYPD's Dennis Franz, who
tells him that he can fall to earth and become human.  Will he give up
his wings?</P>
<P>The story also has a complication in Ryans boyfriend, who seems to show
up to create a conflict than disappear.  This is what I couldn't forgive
in City Of Angels, the big, fatal plot manipulation.  It left m dangling
to upset by its disregard for us to finish its stream of thought.  It
seems to end in midstream, with little complication and lots of glowing
acting.</P>
