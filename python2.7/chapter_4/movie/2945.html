<PRE>                              THE RIVER WILD
                     A film review by Eric Grossman
                 Copyright 1994 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     Actresses always complain that they are not paid as much as their
male counterparts.  Executives and producers explain that the reason
for the disparity is men make action movies that sell big overseas.
Women on the other hand have fewer choice roles and the ones that they
do get tend to be dramas that do not translate well in foreign
markets.  Meryl Streep, probably tired of seeing men who cannot act
their way out of a paper bag earn several times what she does, has
chucked her accents for muscles in the new river-adventure, THE RIVER
WILD.</P>
<P>     This story about a woman who must save her family while on a
white-water rafting trip is trite and pales in the obvious comparison
to DELIVERANCE.  However, Streep is very good in her role as Gail, an
expert river-guide whose marriage to the job-obsessed, wimpy Tom (David
Strathairn) is on the rocks, no pun intended.  Gail thinks the trip
will help bring her family together and boy does it ever.  They meet
some really nasty people that have picked a particularly dangerous
escape route and they mean to take Gail and company along.</P>
<P>     THE RIVER WILD has all the necessary components for a good
action/thriller.  There is the young boy, Roarke (played by JURASSIC
PARK's dinosaur bait, Joseph Mazzello) to make sure there is extra
danger.  Kevin Bacon is the antagonist, Wade, a ruthless thief who is
tough as nails, so tough in fact that he plans his escape down a
roaring river even though he can't swim.  Finally, there is the family
dog, Maggie, who is smarter than all the humans in the film.  All the
ingredients are ready, now we just have to add water, white water to be
exact.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, something went wrong in the Hollywood blender.
Director Curtis Hanson who made the commercially successful but
mediocre film, "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle," whips up some fancy
aerial shots over the river and some decent action sequences but he
never creates enough credible tension.  Since the screenwriter, Denis
O'Neill, forgot to pack interesting surprises and twists in the script,
it is Hanson's job to find a way to make us think we do not know what
will happen.  Technically everything is perfect, but even Streep's
acting and Jerry Goldsmith's solid score can't sell us the danger.
Like most Hollywood films, we know everything will be fine.  The
difference with this film is that we never doubt that we know this.</P>
<P>     All said and done, the production crew deserves a lot of credit
for even getting the film done.  It was made under tremendous adversity
stemming from the unique problems of shooting a film on the rapids.
There was considerable danger for the actors and as the film shows,
Ms.  Streep did one hell of a job steering those rafts.  The
physicality of her performance and the risks she took allow us to buy
her all the way as the ex-river guide.  Somehow if I was stuck on a
wild river and she was there, I would feel a lot safer.  Will she
become the next action star?  No way.  However, she has proved once
again that there is no role she cannot do.</P>
