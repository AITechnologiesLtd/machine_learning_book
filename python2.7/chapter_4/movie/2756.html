<P>     The power of IVAN AND ABRAHAM lies as much in what doesn't reach
the screen as what does.  Taking place in the years leading up to
Hitler's invasion of Poland, the feature debut of Franco-Polish
filmmaker Yolande Zauberman is the tale of four outcasts and the
intolerance that forces them away from home, then forever prevents them
from returning.</P>
<P>     None of the Nazi brutality so evident in another black-and-white
Holocaust picture, SCHINDLER'S LIST, is shown here, since IVAN AND
ABRAHAM ends before Poland is occupied.  What is unflinchingly
portrayed is the climate of anti-Semitism that turns a Polish community
into a tinderbox.</P>
<P>     Those of us sitting in the audience know historically what is to
come, and this recognition adds a further level of poignancy to the
proceedings.  No matter how things turn out in the short run, darker,
more ominous stormclouds are building.  Though that is not IVAN AND
ABRAHAM's story to tell, the sense of impending doom pervades
everything.  Zauberman is as cognizant of the future as are those
watching her film.</P>
<P>     IVAN AND ABRAHAM opens in a Polish shtetl, a small Jewish
community near the country's eastern border.  It is the eve of war, and
the landowner has packed up and departed, ruining all the peasants who
worked for him--both Jewish and Catholic.  Abraham (Roma
Alexandrovitch) is a nine-year old Jew whose best friend is Ivan (Sacha
Iakovlev), a fourteen-year old Catholic.  When the Christians decide
that the Jews are the source of their misery, Abraham's grandfather
(the old landowner's estate manager and the most likely target of
violence) decides to flee the shtetl and take the boy with him.  Not
wanting to be stuck away from home with such a strict disciplinarian,
Abraham runs away, accompanied only by Ivan.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, Abraham's sister Rachel (Maria Lipkina) has begun an
affair with a communist named Aaron (Vladimir Machkov).  When her
father disowns her as a result of this liaison, she and Aaron choose to
leave the country.  But first, they go after Abraham and Ivan to bring
the pair home.</P>
<P>     At times, were it not for the stark black-and-white photography,
it might almost be possible to imagine that Abraham and Ivan are
involved in a simple road movie--meeting people and going places as
they stay one step ahead of those who would end their adventure.  These
moments do not last for long, however, with the ugly specter of racism
always ready to rear its head.  When Abraham pretends to be a gypsy to
avoid anti- Semitism, he finds that the only people hated worse than
Jews are gypsies.</P>
<P>     To show that intolerance is not just a characteristic of the
Catholics, Zauberman has introduced the subplot detailing Rachel's
attachment to Aaron.  His communist beliefs make him an outlaw in the
community, and when Rachel professes to love him and refuses an
arranged marriage, she is summarily cut off from her family.  Her
father proclaims her to be dead.</P>
<P>     The narrative of IVAN AND ABRAHAM is choppy, occasionally to the
point of being difficult to decipher.  Several incidental characters
come and go a little too quickly, with their exact influence over the
runaways left unclear.  For a beautifully photographed film, the
editing is surprisingly crude.  Too often, it's easy to place a missing
scene.</P>
<P>     Technical and flow problems aside, IVAN AND ABRAHAM is still a
moving film, and a worthy "prequel" of sorts to the more sobering and
gut-wrenching SCHINDLER'S LIST.  This is just another face of a horror
so enormous that no number of motion pictures will ever begin to grasp
its scope.</P>
