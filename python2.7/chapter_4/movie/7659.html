<P>"Babe" is one of the cutest, original, and charming films I've ever seen.
How a story about farm animals could have such innocence and be so good
amazes me.
The film starts off like your typical children's story, it seems like it may
be a sappy and boring movie for adults, but surprisingly enough it isn't.
It's about an Australian pig named Babe (voiced by Cavanaugh) who was
randomly picked to be in a contest to sponsor a charity. Whoever guessed his
correct weight won the pig, and that person is our main human character
Farmer Hoggett (Cromwell).  Babe is the only pig on Hoggett's farm and we see
how the other animals consider him somewhat of an outcast. The dogs know
their place, they have an important role and are not eaten. The cat is the
family's pet and always stays inside the house - her job is to keep the
humans happy. Even the sheep and the ducks know they have duties of sorts,
but what they all are sure of is pigs have no purpose. 
Most of the story revolves around Farmer Hoggett training Babe to be a sheep
dog. Hoggett enters Babe in the annual sheep dog competition and we watch
them go through all the training and see even more interaction between the
animals. It's funny to watch the humans get so excited over the animals and
vice versa. 
The screenplay works very well, we get a definite sense of the animals'
characters, but it does not get sappy as to make us feel sorry for them. The
humans are not played as evil butchers either, we can relate to them too.
They're just trying to make a living and they eat animals for food. It's
amazing a story like this is doesn't become an anti-meat campaign nor a
simple, childish story.
"Babe" is a very cute and adorable picture. It's just a nice fairytale about
farm animals. (3/18/96) (12/11/96) (5/23/97) [see also "Gordy"]</P>
