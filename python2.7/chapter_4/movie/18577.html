<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Julia Roberts?  Playing the role of the most popular actress on the
planet?  It sounds like the biggest head-trip in the world, but it's
actually Notting Hill, the best romantic comedy produced by Hollywood in
recent memory.</P>
<P>Roberts (My Best Friend's Wedding) plays Anna Scott, the kind of movie
star that often finds herself the fodder for tabloids all over the
world.  One day, on a rare occasion where she is not being ushered by a
publicist, Anna stumbles into a store that specializes in travel books.
The shop, located in the diverse Notting Hill section of London, is
owned by a chap named William Thacker (Hugh Grant, Nine Months).</P>
<P>Within a few minutes, William lives out the fantasy of every male over
the age of twelve – meeting a rich, beautiful celebrity and having her
instantly fall for your `regular guy' charm.  Of course, my fantasy
doesn't usually involve dumping orange juice down the front of her and
then having her clean up at your flat, which happens to be right across
the street.  In my fantasy, it's usually barbecue sauce.</P>
<P>Thanks to his Pig-Pen-esque Welsh roommate Spike (Rhys Ifans, Twin
Town), it's days before William finds out that Anna has called and asked
to meet at her hotel.  A gleeful William hurries to the hotel, only to
find himself smack in the middle of the press junket for Anna's latest
flick, the sci-fi thriller Helix.  This hysterical scene involves
William being mistaken as a member of the press (namely Horses and
Hounds magazine) and being forced to interview the stars of Helix, a
movie that he has never seen.  Believe me, critics will be raving about
this scene, as it plays out as a bit of an inside joke just for them.</P>
<P>The film really takes off when Anna accompanies William to his younger
sister's birthday party.  The partygoers try not to overreact to the
presence of such a huge star, while Anna, amazed by the activities of
common folk, just tries to fit in.  At the end of their next date Anna
asks William back to her hotel room, only to find her boorish boyfriend
(the well-cast boor Alec Baldwin), which brings both the wonderful
evening and their blossoming relationship to a screeching halt.</P>
<P>Notting Hill will likely draw comparisons to Best Picture nominee Four
Weddings and a Funeral (Richard Curtis wrote both Hugh Grant vehicles),
and with good reason.  In Four Weddings, the story was slowed down by
the romance between Grant and Andie MacDowell, just like it is here.
The best moments are not when director Roger Michell's (Persuasion)
camera focuses on just Hugh and Julia – they're when William's
close-knit friends, or the perpetually filthy Spike, are on the screen.</P>
<P>Although it's more than just a chick flick, will Notting Hill's female
viewers be able to sympathize with the Julia Roberts character?  Despite
the fact that she is both famous and gorgeous, Anna has more to complain
about than a leper at an arm wrestling competition.  My guess is that
they will.  Like Howard Stern eloquently said, `It's like Pretty Woman,
only in reverse!'  (2:03 - PG-13 for sexual content and mild adult
language)</P>
