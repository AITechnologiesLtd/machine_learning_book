<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>     Face off.  It refers in many ways to two rival parties squaring off in
competition.  In this latest film from internationally acclaimed action
director John Woo, the title is literate.  John Travolta plays an FBI man who
assumes the identity of a terrorist he's captured (Nicolas Cage) in order to
get inside Cage's band of criminals by going undercover to prison to find the
location of a biological explosive set to go off somewhere in the Los Angeles
area.</P>
<P>     The procedure in which Travolta assumes Cage's identity is quite
unusual.  Cage is in a coma after being captured and his face is cut off with
lasers and is placed over Travolta's face and the only problem is that
Travolta's face has to come off as well and Cage awakes from his coma in the
hospital and calls upon his goons to force the doctor who performed the
surgery on Travolta to do the same on him using Travolta's face.  Travolta is
caught in a nightmare to say the least as he's now locked in to Cage's
identity and must remain in prison with no chance of reversal since the team
who performed the surgery is murdered by Cage.  Cage assumes the life
Travolta had which includes a promotion within the FBI and the pleasures of
Travolta's home life including a relationship with his wife (Joan Allen).</P>
<P>     This is a high-tech, original and slick minded action picture that has
both leading men in fine form and Cage is a treat to watch as the bad guy and
Travolta has Cage's mannerisms and style of presence down to a tee once he
assumes his identity.  It's a confusing parody to discuss and it's a little
bit like that old Abbott and Costello joke about who's on first.  When you
talk about the movie it's hard to distinguish between the two actors in the
reversal of roles and director John Woo has a knack for making action films
much more meaningful by utilizing the academics of craftsmanship from his
actors.  Even a terrible actor like Jean-Claude Van Damme came across well in
Woo's 'Hard Target' from 1993.  'Face-Off' suffers only from over length and
a screenplay that could have resolved things better in the end but with so
much to please the senses on the screen, these things seem innocuous.</P>
