<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>    I'll be honest, Kansas City is Robert Altman's worst film.  Normally,
when I open a review with a line like that, I follow it up with an
explanation of how, even though it was his worst film, it still is mediocre.
But, I'll be honest once again, Kansas City isn't even a good film.</P>
<P>    Kansas City follows Blondie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a desperate wife of
Johnny O'Hara (Mulroney) in her quest to get him back.  Johnny O'Hara is a
thief who robbed a black gambler only to be quickly caught and imprisoned by
Seldom Seen (Belafonte).  Blondie decides to kidnap Caroline (Richardson)
and use her as leverage against her connected husband to have him send in
Italians to free Johnny.</P>
<P>    Now, you're probably thinking what I was thinking.  How the hell does
that turn into a movie two hours long.  The answer, of course, is a series
on unnecessary plot devices and intercut jazz soundtrack.  The jazz
soundtrack, in fact, is the only thing that kept me from turning the video
off and watching Mother Night, my other film for my snowed-in day.</P>
<P>    Like Short Cuts, Kansas City incorporates jazz into the story.  In Short
Cuts it was part of the story.  In Kansas City, it may have well been the
story.  Admittedly, the performances weren't bad, with Miranda Richardson
giving a more-than-convincing performance as the opium-addict politician's
wife.  But there wasn't much of a plot, there wasn't any point, and there
wasn't anything special.</P>
<P>    It doesn't function as thriller, as noir, as drama, as comedy, or as any
other genre you can imagine.  Nor does it deliver the standard excellence of
Robert Altman's normally adept direction.</P>
<P>    Really, folks, what the hell was Robert Altman thinking?</P>
