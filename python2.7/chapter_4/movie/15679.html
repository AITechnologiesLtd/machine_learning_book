<P>One of the most powerful images in Anaud Tucker's "Hilary and Jackie," 
is of Jackie de Pre (Emily Watson) sitting in her living room all alone, 
shaking violently, a sufferer of multiple sclerosis. Heartbreaking 
moments like this, mixed with observant scenes involving cello playing, 
is what caused, "Hilary and Jackie," to be such a natural and human 
drama.</P>
<P>The film, based on the autobiography by Hilary de Pre, entitled, A 
Genius in the Family, spans four decades, from the 1950's to the 1980's, 
as it follows two close-knit sisters, Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) and 
Jackie, who, during childhood, were masterful at playing the flute and 
cello, and won many competitions. As they grew up, however, they took 
different paths. Hilary, realizing how inferior she was to her younger 
sister at playing, gave up the flute and married Daniel Barenboim (James 
Frain), moving to the secluded countryside of England. Meanwhile, 
Jackie, who knows she cannot live without her sister, goes into a deep 
depression, nearly giving up the cello, and just as she began performing 
again, was ultimately diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.</P>
<P>"Hilary and Jackie," follows a rather basic, ordinary storyline, and 
although some of it could be telegraphed in advance, other sections of 
the picture genuinely surprised me. Also throwing conventional 
storytelling to the winds, a la Quentin Tarantino, the film follows 
Hilary through a large portion of her life, and then circles back, 
following Jackie's point-of-view during the same time frame. Although 
there was no real purpose to choose such a style, the film, I think, 
grew because of this. By showing Hilary's perspective, and then 
Jackie's, there are many revelations in the characters, and we are able 
to understand more deeply what Jackie, confused and lonely, was going 
through.</P>
<P>After giving one of the breakthrough performances of the decade in 
1996's brilliant, "Breaking the Waves," Emily Watson has created another 
thorough, exact character, and yet Jackie is quite different from her 
"Waves" character, Bess. When she grows more and more helpless from the 
disease, the film became occasionally too heart-rending to sit through, 
but director Anaud Tucker should be applauded for not looking away from 
multiple sclerosis. He courageously chose, instead, to look the illness 
straight in its face, in all of its tragedy and sadness. Rachel 
Griffiths, as Hilary, is every bit the perfect match for Watson, and one 
particular scene involving her during the conclusion was particularly 
moving. </P>
<P>The other performances in the film were not quite as good, or memorable, 
because they were all mostly underwritten. This flaw did not much affect 
my feelings for the film, however, because this is a story about two 
sisters, not about their various husbands and family, although we do get 
a look into their childhoods. Played superbly as children by Keely 
Flanders and Auriol Evans, the early scenes were especially effective 
because of the sense we got, in which, as Jackie surpassed Hilary in her 
talent of an instrument, her parents sort of pushed Hilary to the side, 
as if she wasn't as important.</P>
<P>It isn't really giving anything away to say that Jackie du Pre, 
unfortunately, died at the age of 42 in 1987, due to her illness. 
"Hilary and Jackie," is a glorious, seemingly accurate tribute to this 
obvious talent, who has widely been considered the greatest musical 
prodigy of the 20th-century. The fact that her life was unfairly cut 
short seems like a crime, since she was an overall good person who 
happened to have a lot of internal and emotional conflicts throughout 
her life. The final scene, set at an unidentified, dreamy beach, and 
involving the two sisters as children, returned to the set-up of the 
opening sequence, and not only was the cinematography by David Johnson 
gorgeous to look at, but the implications of what is said in the scene 
was a thought-provoking and poignant way to conclude the ode to Jackie 
du Pre's life. </P>
