<PRE>                            HUSBANDS AND WIVES
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1992) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        This Woody Allen film takes on an extra layer of meaning 
in light of the over-publicized custody hearings with Mia Farrow. 
Woody plays an over-the-hill professor / writer who's having 
doubts about his marriage to Mia, doubts she shares once two of 
their friends (Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis), who seemed so 
happy with their marriage, announce they're splitting up, in a long, 
unbroken, one-camera shot. The most annoying thing about 
HUSBANDS AND WIVES is that Woody tries to make the whole 
thing into a documentary, using one camera to go from person to 
person instead of cutting between cameras and sticking interviews 
with the main characters between scenes.</P>
<P>        The motion is intentionally jerky and the edits are clumsy 
and obvious. God knows why the man did this -- maybe it's to 
illustrate how unstable a relationship is by the time a couple has 
been together that long. Or maybe he's just a clumsy jerk. But for 
whichever reason, the movie looks like THE REAL WORLD WITH 
WOODY ALLEN. It's a little too late for him to appear hip and 
trendy, especially considering this movie starts out with the same 
white on black credits / jazz music sequence his old movies were 
known for.</P>
<P>        HUSBAND AND WIVES focuses on those two husbands 
and those two wives in their extramarital pursuits. A typically 
creepy Woody finds himself drawn to one of his students, played 
by a typically creepy Juliette Lewis. Somehow those two seem to 
belong together. The freak factor matches up rather well in this case, 
although I'm sure she's no Soon-Yi. (Not every part of this movie 
was autobiographical.) Mia wants to pursue a relationship with a 
Scotsman at work (and see what's under that kilt), but he's already 
been set up with Judy, thanks to Mia. And Sydney is currently 
having a fling with his New Age vegetarian aerobics instructor.</P>
<P>        Most Woody Allen movies offer us a window into his life, 
but this one seems to offer one into Woody and Mia's collective life. 
It's all incredibly voyeuristic and addictive. The message here, as 
Juliette Lewis so succintly puts it, is that when you reach that age 
you can either have loneliness or suburban discontent with no 
passion or romance. But love at that point isn't about romance, as 
Judy so succintly puts it, it's more of a companionship issue, actually 
having someone to grow old with. Woody doesn't have Mia anymore 
but he does have Soon-Yi to retire with. When he's 70, she'll be 30, 
so it all works out -- as I so succintly put it.</P>
