<PRE>                            BULLETS OVER BROADWAY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  John Cusack, Dianne Wiest, Chazz Palminteri, Jennifer
Tilly, Joe Viterelli, Jack Warden.
Screenplay:  Woody Allen and Douglas McGrath.
Director:  Woody Allen.</P>
<P>     Over the last few years, no filmmaker's work has been linked as
closely to his personal life as Woody Allen's has been.  1992's
HUSBANDS AND WIVES focused on troubled marriages, and showed Allen's
character infatuated with a much younger woman; the parallels to
Allen's life were hard to ignore.  Last year's MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY
was the kind of light comedy Allen hadn't made in years, and seemed to
indicate a desire to return to simpler times.  BULLETS OVER BROADWAY is
another comedy, but it's no pure lark.  Hilarious as it is, it's also a
sly bit of self-mockery, an indication that Allen the artist
acknowledges the foibles of Allen the man.</P>
<P>     Set in Prohibition-era New York, BULLETS OVER BROADWAY is the
story of David Shayne (John Cusack), an earnest young playwright whose
two previous flops are making it difficult for him to find backing for
his latest play, "God of Our Fathers."  An opportunity presents itself
when mobster Nick Valenti (Joe Viterelli) offers to provide all
necessary backing for the play, provided one of the roles goes to his
talentless, would-be actress girlfriend Olive (Jennifer Tilly).  David
is consumed by the idea that he has sold out, but the worst is yet to
come.  As rehearsals progress, it becomes clear that there are problems
with the play, and the solutions come from an unlikely source --
Olive's bodyguard Cheech (Chazz Palminteri).</P>
<P>     Those who found they needed Dramamine to cope with the
hyperkinetic camera movement in HUSBANDS AND WIVES and MANHATTAN MURDER
MYSTERY will be delighted to learn that Allen lays off the hand-held.
In fact, his direction seems a bit too constrained at times, as though
the theater itself were creating a kind of claustrophobia.  But while
this is far from Allen's best work as a director, his script,
co-written by Douglas McGrath, is fantastic.  The dialogue contains as
many laugh-out-loud lines as any film this year, and the plot takes at
least one twist so delightfully unexpected that its revelation may
provide the single biggest laugh.  In a year woefully short on good
comedies, BULLETS OVER BROADWAY may be a saving grace.</P>
<P>     As usual, Allen has a marvelous ensemble cast at his disposal to
bring his script to life, though not all are equally well-used.  Jim
Broadbent and Tracey Ullman, as two of the play's cast members, are
basically one-note types; John Cusack has some marvelous early scenes
as he realizes the kind of person he is dealing with in Nick, but his
character gets lost in the shuffle a bit.  Jennifer Tilly, however, is
dead solid perfect as the simple-minded Olive, and Rob Reiner has a
wonderful bit part as a pretentious playwright who takes great pride in
the fact that "both intellectuals and common people find (his plays)
completely impenetrable."  But the two showcase roles belong to Dianne
Wiest and Chazz Palminteri.  As Helen Sinclair, the play's haughty
star, Wiest brings down the house with her manipulations of David to
spice up her character, and her cry of "Don't speak!"  Palminteri is
even better as Cheech, a career hood who discovers his latent talent,
and that he'll do anything to protect his creation.  It's a wonderful,
subtle performance worthy of Oscar consideration.</P>
<P>     Yet beneath all the laughs in BULLETS OVER BROADWAY is a moral
question framed by the Reiner character's hypothetical question of
which you would save from a burning building:  the last copy of
Shakespeare's works, or some anonymous person.  "The artist creates his
own moral universe," he says, but the turns of the story work against
that notion.  Better to be a good man than a great artist, Allen seems
to argue, and it's difficult not to read that thesis as a minor mea
culpa for his tabloid-headline exploits.  In the course of exorcising
some of his own demons, accompanied by a laugh track, Allen has created
one of his post purely entertaining films in years.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 rehearsals:  8.</PRE>
