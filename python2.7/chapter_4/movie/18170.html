<PRE>     Jesus, when I went to the movies today I didn't know I was going to
have to *think*!</PRE>
<P>     Mike Figgis, the genius behind LEAVING LAS VEGAS, has put together
one dense piece of celluloid here, his first outing since ONE NIGHT
STAND tanked last year.</P>
<P>     What's it about?  With roughly 300 words of dialogue in the entire
film, that's hard to say.  Julian Sands, a Figgis standby, plays Nic, a
troubled filmmaker (I think), who may be married to a blonde woman, with
whom he has a child.  He may also be having an affair with a character
played by Burrows, billed only as "Twins," who just so happens to have a
twin sister (also Burrows) that looks different.</P>
<P>     Nic sees his life in frequent flashback at ages 5, 12, and 16
(where he has a fling with MacDonald), and his hair goes from blonde to
brown to blonde again.</P>
<P>     And then there's this whole Adam & Eve and the
getting-kicked-outta-the-Garden of Eden bit, which is some kind of
allegory for Nic's life.</P>
<P>     It explains the title, but not the movie.  I left thoroughly
confused, though Figgis obviously put some work into crafting a luscious
film a la Antonioni (I don't understand his films either), and since I
recognize Figgis's brilliance I'm willing to give him the benefit of the
doubt here.  The ending actually makes sense, despite all this
runaround, but it's not exactly a feel-good movie, if you catch my
drift.</P>
<P>     Anyway, next time, Mike, try a little more dialogue.  Voices are
good.  You'll either love this movie or hate it - I put it right about
here:</P>
