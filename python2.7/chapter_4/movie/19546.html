<PRE>EYES WIDE SHUT
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Lauded as a genius by many, Stanley Kubrick commands a superlative
filmography that includes such critically-acclaimed films as "2001: A Space
Odyssey," "A Clockwork Orange," "Lolita," and "Dr. Strangelove, or: How I
Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb."  Now, sadly, he's added "Eyes
Wide Shut" to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first
and only blot on his near-flawless copybook.</P>
<PRE>        Kubrick, alas, should have quit while he was ahead.</PRE>
<P>        This much-publicized psycho-sexual tease-a-thon, with its star
billing of real-life marrieds Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, is nothing more
than one long (two-and-a-half hours long) boring exercise that features
Kubrick operating with talent wide shut.</P>
<P>        Kubrick, faithless to Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella "Dream
Story," has confused eroticism with nudity.  He has confused
intellectualism with talking slowly.  He has confused profundity with
pretentiousness.  In addition, the director has made some strange casting
choices, leaving Sydney Pollack in and leaving accomplished performers
Harvey Keitel and Jennifer Jason Leigh out.  Pollack, the director of such
box-office hits as "Tootsie" and "Out of Africa," is normally solid in his
occasional acting stints but here he's miserably out of his depth ... and
there isn't much depth to begin with!  Unhappily, there's not likely to be
a director's cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise
Keitel and Leigh was the right one.</P>
<P>        In fact, with the exception of the stark black-and-white credits,
snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack, and many, many grainy tracking
shots down lavishly-decorated corridors, there's none of Kubrick's
trademark brilliance in this film.</P>
<PRE>        It doesn't help that the story, as delivered, is ridiculous.</PRE>
<P>        Cruise and Kidman, who bring little more than marital torpor to the
project, play well-to-do New Yorkers Bill and Alice Harford.  He's a doctor
and she's an unemployed art gallery director and they share a Central Park
West address.  At an opulent party hosted by their friend Victor Ziegler
(Pollack), Alice gets a little tipsy and starts dancing with a Jeremy
Irons-like Hungarian, who's singularly determined to get her in the sack.
Bill, too, is seen arm-in-arm with a couple of models before he's pulled
away to deal with an overdoser.</P>
<P>        Back home, Bill and Alice smoke a little pot before Alice's
aggressive jealousy kicks in.  As retribution, she confesses to her husband
that she once had deep feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a
hotel where she and Bill once stayed.  This hurtful admission sends Bill
into a tailspin; he pounds the streets of the Village in his heavy black
overcoat struggling with black-and-white images of Alice in the grip of a
horny midshipman.  It's all way too much for him.</P>
<P>        For revenge, Bill almost has sex with a hooker.  He almost has
feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store.  Then he almost
does the hooker's roommate.  And he's almost involved in an overblown
rococo orgy when an old college chum of his tips him off to a mysterious,
password-protected party where everyone wears masks and "the women are
incredible" (i.e., naked).  This "erotic" set piece, a cult-ish bacchanal
complete with chanting, incense, and lots of strategically-placed
partygoers covering up the dirty, might impress the likes of Hugh Hefner,
but it's a lot less shocking than it's intended to be.</P>
<P>        What's the big deal?  Bill doesn't exactly *do* anything (other
than throw his money and credentials around), and Alice only ever lusted in
her heart.  Whoop-dee-doo.  Still, they make up at the same agonizingly
slow pace--was Kubrick, notorious for multiple takes, paying them at an
hourly rate?</P>
<P>        Even geniuses have their bad days.  "Eyes Wide Shut" just happens
to be Kubrick's bad day, an unerotic, disappointing, and altogether
pointless end to an otherwise memorable career.</P>
