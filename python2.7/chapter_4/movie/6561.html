<P>Who knew?  After torturing moviegoers for the past decade with awful
performances in sometimes even worse movies, Madonna actually proves to be a
capable screen actress in what a number of audience members at the media
screening declared "the best film of the year."  While I don't think quite
as highly of it, Alan Parker's long-awaited film version of Andrew Lloyd
Webber and Tim Rice's celebrated stage musical/rock opera Evita is
nonetheless a remarkable cinematic achievement--a brisk, involving, and
highly entertaining spectacle that could breathe new life into the dead
genre of the movie musical.</P>
<P>Evita follows the meteoric rise and fall of Eva Duarte Peron
(Madonna), a girl from the Argentina countryside who dreams of fame and
fortune in the big city.  A liaison with tango singer Augustin Magaldi
(Jimmy Nail) is her ticket to "B.A.--Buenos Aires--Big Apple," where she
climbs up the social ladder and carves out a career as a model and actress
by winning and then discarding useful lovers.  Her most useful conquest
turns out to be Juan Peron (Jonathan Pryce), who marries Eva and is soon
elected president.  As First Lady of Argentina, Eva wins the love of the
nation and all the riches she ever dreamed of, but her flame is ultimately
blown out in 1952, when, at the age of 33, she succumbs to uterine cancer.</P>
<P>Evita the show has a reputation for portraying one of the most
beloved figures in Argentinean history as a scheming viper hungry for fame
and fortune.  While the film does not shy away from this angle, it is just
one side of her persona; Eva as a whole is painted as a very complex figure.
Her accomplishments for her country (grant women the right to vote, the
openings of new hospitals, her giving money to the poor, etc.) are duly
noted, and she does have a vulnerable side.  Her obsessive drive to be
famous is really more of a need for acceptance, something she never received
as a child.  We first see Eva as a girl all of 7 years old, forbidden to
attend her father's funeral because she was the product of an extramarital
affair.  That scene is revisited more than once during the course of the
film, and it serves as a reminder as how the dream began and how the woman
came to be.  Eva's sensitive side does shine through in other moments,
especially in the lovely lament "Another Suitcase in Another Hall," which
she sings after Magaldi turns her back on her soon after arriving in Buenos
Aires (in the stage production, the tune is sung by another character); and
most notably near the end, where you can sense her emptiness and the feeling
that the dream had grown into something more than she could bear.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of those dramatic moments is due in no small part
to Madonna's startling performance.  Granted, she is in her element in this
film, taking on a role that is almost entirely sung, but there is more to
her work than her stronger-than-ever voice.  In all her other films, she is
so overwrought and in-your-face that she might as well have worn a sign that
read "Look at me!  I'm Madonna, and I'm ACTING!"  Here, she is surprisingly
restrained, and as a result her acting feels natural.  It is that
naturalness that enables her to make an emotional connection with the
audience, something she has never been able to accomplish before.  Usually a
Madonna death scene in a movie is met with laughter (or walkouts); this time
around there was silence, save for the sniffling that could be heard
throughout the auditorium.  After this film, she should retire from film
acting; I don't see her ever topping her astonishing work here.</P>
<P>Madonna would likely not have been able to pull off her career-best
work without the stellar talent around and behind her.  The liveliest
performance comes from Antonio Banderas, who plays the floating narrator
Che.  His perpetually unamused and cynical presence and viciously
snarled vocals give the film a welcome edge and prevent it from taking
itself too seriously.  Tony Award winner Pryce adds some maturity and polish
to the whole affair as only a theater vet can.  But most of the kudos go to
director-producer-co-scripter (with Oliver Stone) Parker, who keeps the
action moving briskly while allowing time for quieter moments.  The film is
quite the visual spectacle; the numerous scenes of chaos are well-staged;
the flashy editing serves the story well; and the scenes set at the balcony
of the Casa Rosada, where the Perons address the hordes of extras standing
below, are real stunners.  To quote Che, "The best show in town was the
crowd outside the Casa Rosada crying 'Eva Peron!'"  Parker's one misstep is
his tendency to crank up Webber's score to the max, which too often obscures
Che's expository lyrics, which, in turn, are already somewhat obscured by
Banderas's accent.</P>
<P>The movie musical is dead, and I doubt Evita will be its
resurrection; I'm not so certain that contemporary moviegoers are ready for
films where characters periodically break into song, let alone sing
throughout the entire film.  But if any film is to revive the movie musical,
it will be Evita, for its haunting melodies, strong performances, and
overall passion has the potential to reach even the most skeptical
mainstream moviegoer.</P>
