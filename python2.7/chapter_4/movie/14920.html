<PRE>The Tin Drum (1979)
* * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>What a strange story.  It's been nearly a week, and I'm still having a hard
time sorting out my feelings about THE TIN DRUM.  Oddly, I get the feeling
another viewing wouldn't help much.</P>
<P>Disturbing but not dishonest, THE TIN DRUM is certainly like no other movie
ever made: it mixes a note-perfect evocation of WWI, Weimar Republic and
WWII Germany with a heavy streak of sexually-symbolic surrealism.  There's
also a twisted coming-of-age story in there, somewhere.  But it all adds up
to a movie that isn't quite the sum of its parts.</P>
<P>Based on Guenter Grass's monolithic and symbolically-saturated novel, THE
TIN DRUM takes its time setting up the story of Oskar, a child of pre-WWII
Germany who at a very early age takes fierce note of the unpleasantness and
hypocrisy of the adult world.  To protest all of that, he throws himself
down the cellar steps and stops growing -- just like that.  From then on
it's Oskar against the world, in a sense... although the movie's main flaw
is that seems to have less and less of an understanding of Oskar as it goes
along.</P>
<P>Oskar is played by the dwarfish David Bennent, a terrifying-looking little
man with eyes that seem centuries older than the rest of him.  (See him in
LEGEND [where I accidentally called him "William Bennent"] for another
example of his malevolence.)  He's never anywhere without a tin drum he
bangs incessantly on (hence the title), and his stunted growth gives him the
ability to shatter glass with a keening shriek.  Both become ways he
registers his disgust with and distrust for the world: when he finds his
mother philandering, he jolts her and her lover out of bed with a
cathedral-wrecking yell.  And in the movie's best scene, he uses his drum to
subvert the signals of a Nazi marching band and gets them to switch over to
"The Blue Danube".</P>
<P>Danzig of the Thirties and Forties comes to life perfectly on the screen in
this movie; in fact, the reproduction of the time and place is so convincing
it's a little unnerving.  We get a scene in a post office on Polish soil,
under attack by German soldiers, that recreates the ugliness of the war with
distressing vividness.  The details of Oskar's neighborhood (including a
Jewish toymaker and a gaunt, wraithlike figure who seems to live in the
graveyard) are finely observed and stick in the memory.</P>
<P>But the center of the story -- the underpinning, I guess -- is never clear.
The movie's a little too free with its cold-blooded whimsy.  At one point,
in apparent contrast to what he's done before, Oskar joins a midget troupe
to entertain the Nazi soldiers at the front lines, but the movie never
really makes it clear if he's doing this out of expediency -- or
self-contempt, or out of loyalty to his friends in the troupe, etc.  If the
movie is trying some of the same tricks as the book -- throwing a whole
fistful of emotions at us and seeing if they stick -- then it makes more
sense, but only slightly.  Except through artifical devices like the drum,
the movie never achieves real coherence, and then it's a kind of forced
intelligibility that hurts its apparent ultimate aims.</P>
<P>I mentioned that the film is off-putting, but not dishonest: a good deal of
the middle stretch of the movie depicts Oskar becoming aware of his own
sexuality, and fixating on a young girl who's come to work in his father's
store.  (There's also the suggestion, left openended, that he winds up
fathering a boy through her.)  As uncomfortable as the scenes are of Oskar
and the girl (they have a *very* weird variety of foreplay that involves, I
think, cane sugar), they make sense in context.  But... what context is
that? I kept asking myself, and came up empty.</P>
<P>So -- is it worth seeing?  I guess so.  THE TIN DRUM is not a bad movie, and
certainly never a boring one, but not wholly intelligible or satisfying
either.  What a strange story.</P>
