<PRE>                                  SOMMERSBY
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1993 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<P>     SOMMERSBY is a remake of a wonderful French movie called THE RETURN
OF MARTIN GUERRE, which, in turn, is based on court transcripts from the
16th Century in France.  THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE was the first movie
I saw with Gerard Depardieu, and it is well worth seeing.  However, I am
not sure if it is available on video or not.</P>
<P>     The basic story involves a man (Richard Gere) who returns from the
Civil War claiming to be Jack Sommersby.  It quickly becomes rather
obvious that he is *not* Jack, but, unlike MARTIN GUERRE, that isn't
really the point.  The point revolves around Laurel Sommersby (Jodie
Foster) and her relationship with this man who refuses to acknowledge
that he is not Jack Sommersby.</P>
<P>     What we get is a wonderful interaction between Gere and Foster, an
involving plot, and a perfectly executed ending.  No Hollywood
balderdash, just honest storytelling.  Those of you who saw the original
are in for quite a ride, since the movie does not wind up at all like
the original.</P>
<P>     Foster is magnificent, as always.  Her accent is absolute
perfection again, and in this regard she is beginning to remind me very
much of Meryl Streep.  Foster has an uncanny ability to metamorphose
into anything imaginable.  I'm convinced she could bring dramatic flair
to something as empty as Judy Jetson.</P>
<P>     Gere turns in what I think is his best performance, though I am not
familiar with all of his films.  There is an intensity in him that is
never quite completely hidden, and a slick charm that is disarming and
not at all offensive.</P>
<P>     The courtroom scene with Gere and Foster would be worth sitting
through an agonizingly bad movie in itself, the tension in Foster as
Gere questions her is a perfectly executed balance routine.
Fortunately, the entire movie is not terrible, but rather quite
charming.</P>
<P>     I heartily recommend this movie, and if the Oscars have a good
memory, we may see at least a nomination for Foster out of this.  I
wouldn't be surprised to see Gere gain some respectability from this
role, and I think it would be well deserved.</P>
<PRE>     Rating: +3 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Recommendation:  See THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE, and possibly read
the book.</P>
