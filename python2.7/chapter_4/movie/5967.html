<PRE>                             THE SPITFIRE GRILL
                       A film review by John Schuurman
                        Copyright 1996 John Schuurman</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by Lee David Zlotoff</P>
<P>I am encouraged. After the dreadful dearth of quality popular movies (I
hear "Lone Star," "Emma," and "Trainspotting" are exceptions) in the
summer of '96, at last there are some new films emerging for the autumn
season that will get me out to the theater again. </P>
<P>"The Spitfire Grill" was well worth the time and money. Set in a
wonderful little backwoods town in Maine called Gilead the film does
much with references to its Biblical namesake. In the Bible, Gilead is
the region to the east of the Jordan river, noted for the soothing
"balm" or ointment gleaned from its woodlands. One of the hopes for
modern Gilead's future is that such a substance (for healing purposes)
has been discovered in the forests of the region that had long been
thought ruined and useless. The Biblical Gilead was also a refuge for
fugitives. Among those who sought refuge in Gilead were Jacob when he
fled before Laban (Gn. 31:21-55), the Israelites who feared the
Philistines in Saul's time (1 Sa. 13:7), Ishbosheth (2 Sa. 2:8-9) and
David during Absalom's revolt (2 Sa. 17:22ff.) </P>
<P>Gilead provides such a refuge for Percy, a young woman recently
released from prison. She finds healing and purpose in Gilead (although
not without notable obstacles). Ultimately, she loses her life there,
but in the losi
ng, provides a Gilead of her own for some significant others. The old
spiritual goes,  "There is a Balm in Gilead to make the wounded
whole"(Jer 8:22),  and it provides the theme for this grand movie. The
place becomes a haven of hope and healing.  </P>
<P>Some other reasons to attend: The movie is beautifully shot in rural
New England, the acting over all is first-rate, and writer-director Lee
David Zlotoff has brought a wonderful ensemble together of Ellen
Burstyn, Marcia Gay Harden and Alison Elliott. </P>
<P>And then some new territory too: I am not usually grateful for the long
run of suspense and action dramas that compose such a large portion of
the menu provided by American film makers. The cliche:
"menacing-music-followed-by-bad-things-happening-suddenly" is so
overworked that, like a grouchy cat, I grow weary of being played with,
and so I hiss and huff and hide under the chair. But sometimes I am
grateful because all of those suspense movies and TV shows that torment
us with menacing music as we wait for the sudden horror to bust into
the screen have built a vocabulary and a context for viewing in which a
movie like this one can come along -- and playing off of that context
-- become something all together different. The point is, I don't think
this move works without all of the suspenseful nailbiters to provide a
counter-point. </P>
<P>But it works well. "Tender Mercies" was like that. Bruce Beresford,
director of "Tender Mercies" and Zlotoff continually serve up
situations that are full of threat which then prove to be innocent or
even helpful. </P>
<P>It happens this way, (you have learned to see these things coming): It
is about time for the plot to take a twist. Ominous things are afoot.
The sub-terranian music of fore-boding softly growls several layers
deep. A car full of men pulls up or a child steps out into the street
or you see a movement in the shadows. But then, "Fooled 'ya!; it's OK;
no harm intended here; rape, murder, mayhem didn't even cross our
mind." </P>
<P>Well, we know it is not true but we love the relief. The unsavory
characters smile and don't make any sudden moves; the child simply
makes it to the other side of the street, the man lurking in the trees
proves to be an angel.</P>
<P>This technique works wonderfully well in "Spitfire." The movie is not
without "bad things happening" and there is enough suspense for the
movie to work. But the film does tighten and release its grip on us
repeatedly until we are relaxed and softened up for the occasion when
it does want to really squeeze us.</P>
<P>One last thing: Zlotoff has the courage to have the bad guy of the
movie restored at the end. This is risky film making. Nahum, the
close-minded towny scoundrel  is someone we have found it easy to hate
when the time comes to close the film. And our blood lust would have
been satisfied had he come to a wretched end. But we are not allowed
that catharsis. The man does a righteous thing. And though he is
damaged goods, and though we are reluctant to bless and not curse him,
we see him restored. In addition to being the most accurate
demonstration of the Christian doctrine of grace I have seen in recent
memory, it is one of the most risky film making choices I have
witnessed in a long while. </P>
