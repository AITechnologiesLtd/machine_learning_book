<PRE>                             I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING
                       A film review by Joseph C. Fineman
                        Copyright 1993 Joseph C. Fineman</PRE>
<P>I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING.  British, late '40s.  Seen because Orwell
mentions it a couple of times, and because I am fond of the song it is
named after:</P>
<PRE>        Featherbeds are soft,
        And painted rooms are bonnie,
        But I wad give them a'
        For my handsome, winsome Johnnie.</PRE>
<P>     Like the song, the movie is about a woman who knows what she
wants, or anyway thinks she does.  She is the daughter of a banker, and
has made what she considers a good catch--a rich industrialist.  Her
father disapproves (I suppose because it means marrying into trade?),
but she stays her course.  Her fiance has rented an island off the west
coast of Scotland for the duration of World War II, and that is where the
wedding is to be, but several days of bad weather keep her from making
the last leg of the trip there, which has to be made in a small boat,
past a dangerous whirlpool.  So she is stuck on another island, where
there is a handsome young man (a soldier? it was three weeks ago and I can't
remember) whose intentions are honorable.  She feels herself falling in
love with him, and becomes desperate to get away from him and to her
fiance.  The owner of the boat will not try the passage until he judges
it to be safe.  However, he has a son, perhaps sixteen, who is engaged to a
young lady on the island but expects it to be several years before he
has saved up the money he needs to marry her.  The banker's daughter
offers him the whole sum at once if he will take her to the other
island.  He agrees.  His fiancee hears about it and scolds her
eloquently: I was willing to wait four years for my lover, while you are
willing to risk his life so you can jump into bed with yours tonight.
The honorable young man hears he is the cause of it all and insists on
going too.  They go out, but are beaten back by a squall and nearly
drowned in the whirlpool; they make it home, and the boatman gives his
son a sickening dressing-down.</P>
<P>     Thereupon the banker's daughter walks off into the sunset with the
handsome young man, because God damn! this is a *comedy*.  None of the
misery she has caused counts.  We are not supposed to care about the
invisible industrialist's disappointment, because (I guess) he is rich
(and a draft dodger?) and therefore wicked.  We are not supposed to
care about the boy's humiliation, because (I guess) he is poor and
therefore inconsequential.  We are supposed to pay attention to the
middle-class lady's hormones, and be amused at how they and all those
other props conspire to prove that a woman cannot, after all, know what
she wants.</P>
<P>     The song is actually sung now and then during the movie, as
background music, without much art or conviction.  It tells a different
story:</P>
<PRE>        Some say he's black,
        But I say he's bonnie.
        Fairest of them a'
        Is my handsome, winsome Johnnie.</PRE>
<P>     In this, as in many other Scottish songs (c.f. "Eppie Morrie,"
"The False Lover Won Back"), the heroine is shown to know what she
wants and how to get it.</P>
<P>     Orwell mentioned the movie in a couple of letters because he was
nearly done in by the same whirlpool.  He does not say what he thought
of it, but I imagine he was entertained by the class angle.</P>
