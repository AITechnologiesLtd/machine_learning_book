<PRE>                         THE OTHER SIDE OF SUNDAY
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Danish director Lars Von Trier's highly acclaimed film BREAKING
THE WAVES explored its protagonist's conflict between her love and her
god.  Norwegian director Berit Nesheim's THE OTHER SIDE OF SUNDAY
covers similar ground, but rather than a newlywed, its heroine is a
young teenage girl facing the horrors of puberty.  BREAKING THE WAVES
is close to the top of just about every critic's best of the year list
for 1996, and, although Trier's picture is the better of the two films,
I was similarly moved by both.</P>
<P>     American movies are obsessed with violent subject matter, and yet,
luckily, violence rarely affects most of us personally.  On the other
hand, while we are a nation where over half attend church, characters
in our films never pray.  Given all the life threatening situations
movie characters encounter, you would expect to see them resort to
prayer fairly often, but you do not.  This film ignores violence and
focuses its attention on faith and love.</P>
<P>     THE OTHER SIDE OF SUNDAY is set in a small and strict town in
Norway in 1959.  Like the rebellious heroine in WELCOME TO THE
DOLLHOUSE, Maria is a young teen.  Maria is beautifully played with
charming innocence and curiosity by Marie Theisen.  Maria's body is
growing rapidly, albeit not fast enough to suit Maria, and her puberty
is proving taxing.  If she had a single wish, it would probably be
bigger breasts.  To complicate matters, her father is the local priest,
Johannes, played sternly and with precision by Bjoern Sundquist.</P>
<P>     As the film opens, Maria is in a church full of sincere, but
unhappy looking parishioners.  She thinks to herself about her upcoming
and long confirmation training, "By the time I get confirmed, I will
have sat here 640 hours.  On this bench."  Later she laments, "Father
loves his congregation.  We exist so the priest can have a home."  And
so it is, the priest does love his job more than his family.</P>
<P>     Maria prays a lot, not because she has to, but because she
believes in God -- her God.  Her God is the one of the Book of Solomon
whom she points out believed in wine, women, and song.  There is a
beautiful scene where she lies down in a lush field and recites "The
Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures"  This pastoral Lord, who is full of life, is her God.
The conflict is that she and her father do not worship the same God.</P>
<P>     Arne Borsheim's handsome cinematography is quietly in evidence,
especially in the outdoor scenes.  The music by Bent Aaserud and Geir
Bohren for this gentle film is suitably lovely and moving, and many of
the pieces have religious overtones.</P>
<P>     Maria even gets into theological arguments with her father on
Jesus's need to go to the bathroom -- just like everyone else.  This
infuriates her father.  "Let us pray," Maria chants to herself.  "Let
us pray.  Let us pray and laugh."</P>
<P>     Much of the film deals with Maria's exploration of her budding
sexuality.  Her friend Birgit (Sylvia Salvesen) runs with a looser
crowd.  They are all good kids, but they hang out together to smoke a
little, drink a couple of beers, dance to the forbidden rock and roll
music, and, yes, sometimes have sex.  Maria wants desperately to be in
this group as much as she is frightened by them.</P>
<P>     This is a rich film and has all of the truth of life.  It is so
easy to empathize with Maria's frustrations and temptations.  A
typical, poignant scene has one of her cotton breasts falls out in
front of her friends.  This deeply wounds her self-esteem.</P>
<P>     Birgit is going through the same traumas.  She wants to get
confirmed, but make-up is forbidden by her church.  "I believe in God,"
she almost weeps.  "I really do.  But I want to be pretty too."</P>
<P>     A powerful film with simple, heartfelt performances by all.  The
script by Lasse Glomm, Berit Nesheim, and Reidun Nortvedt is full of
lines that are naturally provocative and yet ring totally true.  A gem
that, sadly, few will probably ever discover.  I saw it at the press
screening for San Jose's Cinequest film festival.  I hope an American
distributor picks it up.  It deserves the wider audience than it will
ever get.  America knows what it wants.  BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO
AMERICA sells.  This sort of cinema does not.</P>
<P>     THE OTHER SIDE OF SUNDAY runs 1:43.  It is in Norwegian with easy
to follow English subtitles.  It is not rated, but would get an R.
There are nudity, sexual situations, and a few profanities.  The film
would be fine for teenagers.  I recommend this picture to you highly
and give it ***.  I came close to rating it higher.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
