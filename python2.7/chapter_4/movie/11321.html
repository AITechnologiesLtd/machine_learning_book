<P>The first thing a fan of the Coen Brothers' previous effort, "Fargo," must
do is completely obliterate any recollection of that film and brace one's
self for a film that is arguably the most wacky film they've ever made. 
With a bigger budget, more refined sets, and a wide release on its opening
release date, this film could easily be too awesome for its own good.  The
Brothers Coen could get too ambiguous and too wild with money and make a
total mess of a film, much like Danny Boyle's "A Life Less Ordinary," his
film following the brilliant "Trainspotting."</P>
<P>"The Big Lebowski" is a mess, but my god, what a wonderful mess of a film. 
The film is as disjointed, overly-exaggerated, incredibly weird, and as
disconnected from reality as its protagonist, L.A.'s most lazy and
self-centered human being.  This wonderful person is named Jeff Lebowski (a
long-haired, scuzzy Jeff Bridges), otherwise and preferably referred to as
"The Dude."  We don't learn much about this man, but he lives in a big L.A.
house, goes bowling every couple of hours, drinks White Russians as much as
he can, smokes pot regularly, and is unemployed.  Only in L.A.</P>
<P>One night, the Dude comes home to find a pair of hoodlums who attack him,
asking for some money that he has no idea he stole from them.  To be tough,
one of the men piss on his favorite rug before realizing that they got the
wrong Lebowski.  See, there's another Lebowski in town who's rich, referred
to as "The Big Lebowski" (Charles Durning's dead ringer, David Huddleston,
who was Grandpa Arnold on "The Wonder Years"), and his young nymphomaniac
gold digger wife, Bunny (Tara Reid), apparently owes money all over town,
and that's why the men came to beat up Lebowski.</P>
<P>The Dude's visit to the Big Lewbowski's mansion to get paid for the
pissed-on rug is what becomes the catalyst for the rest of the story, which
really takes off once the Big Lebowski receives a ransom note from some
unknown assailants who claim to have kidnapped the now-missing Bunny. 
Since the Dude met the people (in the first scene) who the Big Lebowski
believes kidnapped his wife, he asks him to be the courrier for the million
dollars he needs delivered to them so he identify them for him.  From this
point on, the plot goes completely wacky, and to reveal what happens
further would minimize most of the fun, which is so weird and wacky that
it's unbelievable.</P>
<P>What the Coen's do best is crete a world disconnected completely from
reality.  No one in their world is supposed to be an exact duplicate of a
real person; they're all distinct eccentric characters who live completely
out of reality.  "The Big Lebowski"'s best feature is the wide assortment
of characters, which is probably the best set they've ever had for a movie.
 Every character is different from everyone else, and each of them is fully
allowed to be their own person.  Even cameo characters are brilliantly
realized.</P>
<P>The most fascinating character is that of the Dude's one bowling partner,
Walter (John Goodman), who was apparently shell shocked in Vietnam (as he
constantly reminds everyone around him), and handles his bowling league
like it was a religion.  He gets so into trying to help the Dude in his
giant dilemna that he ends up making things worse, yet never becomes an
annoying character.  Of the four characters Goodman's played in the four
films he's been in this year alone thus far (can you believe it?), this is
probably his most electric and best performance.</P>
<P>Other characters include: the Big Lebowski's bitter freaky artist daughter,
Maude (Julianne Moore), who tries to help the Dude in several ways; Donny
(Steve Buscemi), the more reserved bowling league partner who always seems
to be out of touch with what's going on; Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman,
the boom mike guy with a crush on Dirk from "Boogie Nights"), the Big
Lebowski's hallowed assistant; a wealthy porn producer (Ben Gazzara); and a
group of Sweedish (or German) "nihilists," one of them played by Flea, and
another played by "Fargo"'s Peter Stormare (Gaer Grimsrud), who shows up in
other places throughout to high comic effect.  In smaller cameos are a
hispanic bowling competitor of the Dude's named Jesus (John Turturro), who
makes bizarre threats each time we see him; and an arty friend of Maud's
played by a John Waters-looking David Thewlis.  Oh.  And Sam Elliott stars
as the on-again/off-again narrator, who mocks the process by sometimes
forgetting what he's going to say, and popping up in the story from time to
time.  As you can see, this is one hell of a character line-up.</P>
<P>The plot itself is all over the place, filled with gaping holes, and
unfolded in a leisurely, weird pace.  The film, though, never suffers by
it, and in fact, is better off being this way.  It's a film that may be
weird a lot of the time, and sometimes just plain incoherent, but for those
who can appreciate it, it's a wild, wild ride.  Everything in the film is
exaggerated, and played for the highest comic effect, so much that after
about an hour it almost hurt to laugh.  This is easily the funniest film of
the year thus far, which, when you think of it, is not great feat.</P>
<P>The acting from everyone is brilliant, as everyone is given a character
they can play around with.  John Goodman is easily the best supporting
character, while everyone else does marvelous work with their respective
characters, each giving them individual quirks to make them more
fascinating.  Julianne Moore gives her character a faux-Euro Trash accent,
while Philip Seymour Hoffman seems to have a smile surgically frozen on his
face.  John Turturro oozes with camp, while Steve Buscemi brilliantly
maneurvures through a role where he has to be told to shut the fuck up
every time he speaks.</P>
<P>But the actor who really gives the film some depth is Jeff Bridges, who is
absolutely brilliant as the Dude.  His character is not at all the most
fascinating character, but he's the one who sets the tone for everything to
come.  Bridges is a very talented actor, and here, he's at his comic best,
being completely aware of his slothness, and still not caring about it.  He
makes the Dude the film's most likable character, and is completely
believable every step of the way.</P>
<P>So what's this film about?  To tell you the truth, I'm not really sure.  It
could be a criticism of America's slothness, or a paen to it, as the Dude's
the film's most moral and sympathetic character in a film filled with crazy
people who do way too much.  Or maybe it's a film about trying to find a
happy medium between the two.  Whatever it's about, the thing about this
film is to just sit back and enjoy the ride.  The only problem is not the
lack of any real substance, but the fact that it does go on too long.  By
the end, I was just waiting for it to end, even though once I got there, I
was kinda disappointed.  But the completely wacky and lazy storytelling,
which jumps all over the place at will, is done so to show the world of the
Dude the best.</P>
<P>"The Big Lebowski" is not one of the Coens' best film.  But even the Coen's
worst is still one hell of a film, and this is the weakest Coen film since
"The Hudsucker Proxy," and therefore still pretty amazing.  Anyone
expecting a "Fargo" is at the wrong film.  But if one lets themselves go,
"The Big Lebowski" is outrageously fun entertainment, even if it doesn't
seem to have a purpose.  Oh well.  That's what you get for going to see a
comedy.</P>
