<P>   If you read the vibrantly masculine stories of Ernest
Hemingway, you're not surprised to find out that the author is
as macho as his novels.  Does it logically follow that the
writer of trashy, soap-opera accounts of Hollywoods stars,
 heir drug habits, their promiscuity and their suicidal
tendencies would herself be a woman who is not only vulgar
but who celebrates her style of life?  It does if you go along
with Paul Rudnick's concept of Jacqueline Susann, who
wanted fame more than anything else in life and whose
"Valley of the Dolls" put her squarely on the map.  Rudnick's
Susann, while somewhat fictionalized for dramatic effect on
the screen, is a woman of unbounded ambition, forceful
charm and limitless determination to make a name for herself
by following the standard advice to authors--write what you
know.  And what she knew best was the sort of chatter that
captivated women in the ladies' rooms of public places
throughout the nation but which had not been written about in
quite the gloriously trashy way that Susann made popular.</P>
<P>   The movie, directed by Andrew Bergman ("Honeymoon in
Vegas," "The Freshman") from an article written in The New
Yorker magazine by Michael Korda shows Jackie to be
anything but a cloistered librarian with a vivid imagination. 
The outrageous Bette Midler performs the role with a hair
style that might have done well in the L.A. competition
featured in Kevin Allen's "The Big Tease" (which opened
during the same weekend), decked out with delightfully
uncouth clothing, and best of all with a non-stop array of one-
liners.  With Nathan Lane as her publicist, agent, and
husband, Irving Mansfield, you'd expect the gags to flow, and
they do.  Then again, you can get that on any solid TV
sitcom week after week as the enduring "Cheers" pointed out
so well. What's missing is a sense of proportion.  Susann's
vulgarity is amicably on display.  But Paul Rudnick, one of the
funniest writers of the decade--whose "Jeffrey" tells the
poignant and hilarious tale of a gay male in New York who
swears off sex but winds up in a series of affairs with unlikely
people--seems intent on making her a saint.  </P>
<P>   Susann, dedicated to her autistic son whom she has
reluctantly placed in an expensive home, and given to talking
to God while facing the sun between the branches of Central
Park trees, is not really satirized in this movie.  As a substitute,
director Bergman throws the story across the screen in the
garish colors of the films of the fifties decade, colors which
you'd expect from a John Waters movie but which simply
reinforce the idea that crackling jokes aside, "Isn't She Great"
is mostly a lavish, full-screen sitcom.</P>
<P>   Not that this is bad--just that we should expect more of
Rudnick.  The laughs do come frequently, as when Jackie
meets Irving at a downscale restaurant, goes with him to a
more extravagant eatery, and finds out that Mansfield
impresses her by comments like "Do you know Perry Como? 
I handle his brother."  The best line comes from Jackie's
friend Florence, played by the versatile and always reliable
Stockard Channing, who comforts the author with "talent isn't
everything."  David Hyde Pierce ("Frasier") as Susann's
editor, is an ideal foil for the author, described by her
accurately as a tightass--a WASP who orders an American
cheese sandwich with mayo in a Jewish deli.</P>
<P>    We do get some clues about marketing. Susann's "Valley
of the Dolls" did not get to the top simply because it hit an
automatic high note with the public.  To get the novel
stationed in the best locations of bookstores throughout the
country, Susann, her husband and her adorable black poodle
do a cross-nation tour (like John Steinbeck with a similar dog
in "Travels With Charlie)," shmooze with the owners of even
the smallest emporium after having learned their names in
advance, and make sure that the flamboyantly decorated
tome is placed on eye level in the optimum spots.  </P>
<P>   Since Susann died of breast cancer in 1974, Bergman
milks the hospital scene with both poignancy and good
humor, showing an author who is a shadow of her former self
but who has never lost her sense of consummate vulgarity or
taken on the snobbish attributes of people who rise from
nothingness to the heights of celebrity.  What Bergman has
given us is an entertaining biopic of people who seem always
to be aware that the studio cameras are on them and who
are playing to the crowd more than interacting with one
another.</P>
