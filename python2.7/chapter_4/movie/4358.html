<P>     Of Roger Moore's seven James Bond pictures, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME 
stands out as the best.  Stripped of the extreme silliness of THE MAN 
WITH THE GOLDEN GUN and packed with style, action, and wit, THE SPY WHO 
LOVED ME ranks alongside the Connery Bonds as a memorable cinematic 
representation of Ian Fleming's superspy (although the screenplay is 
*not* based on Fleming's novel of the same title).  </P>
<P>     For the first time in three films, Roger Moore starts to unearth a 
personality for Bond, and the fatuousness which was to mar his later 
outings rarely asserts itself.  This version of 007 is suave, 
sophisticated, and only a little flat.  He's good with wry humor and 
one-liners, and seems reasonably capable as a "man of action."  In a 
nutshell, Moore isn't Connery, but he recognizes this, and doesn't try 
to be what he can't. </P>
<P>     As usual, Bond's chief nemesis is a megalomaniac.  This time, his 
name is Stromberg (Curt Jurgens), and he's out to destroy the world to 
fulfill his dream of creating and populating an underwater city.  The 
first part of his plan involves destroying the over-water civilization 
by a nuclear holocaust.  To that end, he steals British and Soviet 
submarines with the intention of using their nuclear capacity against 
the superpowers.  007, along with his Russian counterpart, Major Anya 
Amasova, aka agent Triple-X (Barbara Bach), is dispatched to stop this.  
There are complications, however, because, although the USSR and England 
are cooperating on the mission, Anya has a personal grudge against Bond, 
and she makes it perfectly clear that she intends to kill him at the 
first favorable opportunity.  </P>
<P>     THE SPY WHO LOVED ME marks the first appearance of Jaws (Richard 
Kiel), who would prove to be 007's most dangerous and persistent 
adversary (he returns in MOONRAKER).  So massive and powerful is Jaws 
that there's little Bond can do against him physically.  He's the 
perfect supervillain, and it's great fun to see how 007 survives 
confrontations with the steel-toothed giant.  </P>
<P>     Barbara Bach proves to be a pleasant addition to the cast as the 
latest "Bond girl."  Major Amasova is attractive, smart, sexy, and (of 
course) dangerous.  Her repartee with Bond is scripted with the usual 
attention to double entendres and witty retorts (note especially the van 
exchange in the desert when Triple-X and 007 are trying to escape Jaws).  
There also seems to be slightly more tenderness in this relationship 
than is typical for Her Majesty's most promiscuous agent... but only a 
little.  After his wife's death at the end of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET 
SERVICE, it's clear that Bond has no intention of ever again becoming 
involved in a serious romantic entanglement.  </P>
<P>     The second "Bond girl" of the film is Naomi, played by Caroline 
Munro.  Her part is actually rather small--she shows up, looks good, 
utters a few lines of dialogue, then tries to kill 007.  Jurgens is 
adequate as the villain.  There's nothing remarkable about his 
performance except that he remains more restrained than the average Bond 
madman.  Old friends like Lois Maxwell (Moneypenny), Bernard Lee (M), 
and Desmond Llewlyn (Q) are back.</P>
<P>     The single most impressive moment in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME comes in 
the pre-credits sequence.  Following a harrowing ski chase, Bond zips 
right off the edge of a cliff.  Rick Sylvester was paid $30,000 to do 
this stunt, and it's worth the money, giving the film the kind of kick-
start that no other opening has matched (before or after).  It's the 
perfect lead-in to Carly Simon's rendition of "Nobody Does It Better", 
possibly the best-known of all the Bond themes.  The rest of the film's 
action, directed by Lewis Gilbert (YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE), is as 
impressively staged.</P>
<P>     THE SPY WHO LOVED ME has no shortage of gadgets.  These include 
noxious cigarettes, ski pole projectiles, and, most impressive of all, a 
Lotus Esprit that swims rather than sinks.  But such toys are only part 
of 007's appeal.  Bond films attract audiences because they're solid
fun--light, uncomplicated entertainment that requires no more from a 
viewer than that he or she sits back and enjoys.  Despite the recycled 
plot, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME deserves its popularity as one of Bond's most 
engaging outings.  Even those who swore off the films with Sean 
Connery's departure might consider checking this one out.</P>
