THE CLIENT (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Before I saw THE CLIENT I had already been disenchanted by
the books of John Grisham. To be quite frank, I haven't read
them (although they used to be something resembling
bestsellers on the small and bibliophobic market of my
country) but I had opportunity to watch two of the screen
adaptations - Pollack's THE FIRM and Pakula's PELICAN BRIEF
- and that was enough to make me think about Grisham as
nothing more as mediocre author. By that time, I had already
watched enough of Joel Schumacher's films to have opinion
about him as nothing more than mediocre film-maker. Perhaps
that was the reason why this film actually worked - mediocre
script was perfect match for mediocre talent.</P>
<P>The movie, like almost all Grisham's books is set in
American South and features some unusual characters in big,
and, more often than not, legal trouble. This time the
protagonist in question is Mark Sway (played by Brad
Renfro), 11-year old boy from dysfunctional family who had
just witnessed the suicide of a important mob lawyer Romey
Clifford (Walter Olkewicz). Just before killing himself,
Romey told Mark about the body of a murdered senator and
other details that would put away wiseguys like his client
Barry Muldano (Anthony La Paglia) behind the bars. Federal
prosecutors led by politically ambitious Roy Foltrigg (Tommy
Lee Jones) are convinced that the boy knows those details
and they begin harassing him. The boy then hires attorney in
a form of Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon). She, being the
recovered alcoholic, perhaps doesn't look like a much of
help, but she would fight for the rights of his client. In
the meatime, Muldano and his cronies are trying to kill the
boy.</P>
<P>The film has rather weak premise - boy is smart enough to
elude law enforcement and hire attorneys, yet not
intelligent enough to know that the co-operation with the
authorities is the only way for him to stay alive. Perhaps
that works in real world, but in Grisham's works, same as in
the script by Akiva Goldsman, there are some other rules. In
any case, Schumacher directs this forgettable script as real
professional, not allowing us to stop and think of all the
flaws in it. The biggest attraction here is a great acting
talent, most notable in the forms of Susan Sarandon and
Tommy Lee Jones, actors whose talent is very suitable for
fascinating Grisham's characters. Sarandon is very good as
strong professional woman, and Jones is great as scruples
yet charming public official. Actors in minor roles are also
good, like Ossie Davis as sympathetic judge, Will Patton as
menacing yet intelligent policeman and Mary Louise Parker as
boy's desperate mother. On the other hand, Anthony La Paglia
is rather pathetic in thankless role of stupid Mafioso. All
in all, THE CLIENT is still forgettable, but watchable piece
of cinema that gives the phrase "mediocrity" a good name.</P>
