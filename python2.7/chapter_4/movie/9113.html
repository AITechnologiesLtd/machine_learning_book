<PRE>TRUE LIES (1994)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>James Cameron has a reputation for his heavy, serious, special effects
laden films. True Lies is a change from what is expected from him, kind of.</P>
<P>True Lies is by far a bloated film. It starts off well enough, a story
about a super-spy character, Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who
lives a double life. His two lives consist of one as a super-spy and
another as a father/husband. His priorities seem to be more towards being a
super-spy. He is tracking a bad guy from the Middle East and must stop him
from using the nuclear warheads that possesses.</P>
<P>This would have been a great film, but Cameron, who wrote the script, stops
everything and puts in a story about Harry and his ordinary housewife
(Jamie Lee Curtis). The story follows Harry as he vengefully spies and
follows his wife around trying to find out if she is cheating on him. And
Harry is just not someone we like after what he puts his wife through in
the luxury hotel suite. This whole mid-portion of the film just does not
work, and bogs a rather good action film. The comedy that Cameron tries to
introduce using this portion of the film does not work at all. Moreover it
puts Harry in bad light, making him look like a vengeful abusive husband.</P>
<P>The action sequences in True Lies are complicated and well done. Cameron
shows that he knows how to do action. His highlight action sequences are an
opening escape from a mansion, a fight scene in a bathroom (which strangely
ends up on a rooftop), and an ending Harrier sequence that has to been seen
to be believed. As always, Cameron's action is staged in such a way that
it's over-the-top. Suspension of belief is needed for his action sequences,
and once that is achieved they can be enjoyed.</P>
<P>If Cameron had focused on Harry's problem with the terrorist, this film
would have ended up a fun film. As it stands, at almost two and a half
hours, it's a bit long and the mid-section is not something that is worth
sitting through to get to the action. Is True Lies fun? Almost. Should you
see True Lies? If you have the time to sit through some painfully bad
attempts at humor to get some spectacular action sequences. </P>
