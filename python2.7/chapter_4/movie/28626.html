<PRE>THE KING IS ALIVE
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2001 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Stranded in Africa's equivalent of the Australian outback, a busload of
tourists decides to stage an impromptu performance of Shakespeare's "King
Lear."</P>
<P>        Now perhaps group therapy through artistic expression wouldn't be the
first order of business for you or I under these circumstances, and indeed
there are some passengers who question the wisdom of all this, but then
again we're not appearing in a movie by Danish director Kristian Levring,
and don't have three hand-held cameras constantly thrust in our faces,
Dogme 95-style.  </P>
<P>        "The King is Alive" is the latest offering from the Danish movement
pioneered by the likes of "Dancer in the Dark"'s Lars Von Trier, a movement
which strips "modern day" filmmaking of what it considers to be trippy
conveniences--tripods, lighting, non-source music, and directorial credits,
resulting in a pure and "natural" film experience.</P>
<P>        If anything, the Dogme 95 style works especially well in "The King is
Alive," since the drama is played out amid the rough-lit dunes and
abandoned mining shacks of an arid North African landscape, where grainy,
gritty camerawork heightens the experiences of our marooned protagonists.
And indeed the play's the thing, with Levering and his international cast,
among them Jennifer Jason Leigh, Bruce Davison, Janet McTeer, and Romane
Bohringer, making the production entirely believable given the available
options (how quickly would *you* feel left out if someone else got to play
Cordelia?).</P>
<P>        Where the film breaks down, however, is in its characterizations.  Not one
of these people is anyone you would want to spend time with, let alone
perform alongside.  They're whiney and unpleasant, mean and hostile, and
this makes their ultimate fate--and that of the film--meaningless, since we
care very little about what happens to them.</P>
<P>        The cast gives it their all, and it's fascinating seeing how quickly the
sexual power struggles come to a head (and, especially, how quickly Levring
manages to avoid pretentiousness), but in the end "The King is Alive" more
closely approximates another of Shakepeare's works, at least in name: "Much
Ado About Nothing."</P>
