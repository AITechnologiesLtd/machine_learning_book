<PRE>                                    THE GETAWAY
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros

<PRE>"It's been my experience that having friends is overrated."
                                - Michael Madsen to Baldwin & Basinger
                                  as their characters discuss trust.</PRE>
<P>     Though flat as the proverbial pancake, Roger Donaldson's THE
GETAWAY is the best alternative, yet, to a season overloaded with
oppressive drama.  In the wake of everything from Vietnam to the
Holocaust, this throwaway Basinger/Baldwin vehicle is pleasingly
passable pulp.</P>
<P>     The original GETAWAY, directed in 1972 by Sam Peckinpah, starred
Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw.  Now, cutest-couple Alec Baldwin and Kim
Basinger takeover the roles of a crime couple who double-cross both
their partner and their sponsor in a million-dollar heist.</P>
<PRE>     Believe or it not, Alec Baldwin is the best thing in this movie.</PRE>
<P>     Even when sporting a temporary beard (which makes him look like
GI-Joe), the former Jack Ryan outclasses everyone else including his
wife.  Poses and all, he's a surprisingly steely presence.</P>
<PRE>     The rest of the cast is a loss, though.</PRE>
<P>     Kim Basinger tries to look tough, but she's no more intimidating
than costars Michael Madsen (the partner) and James Woods (the
sponsor).  Together, they provide three textbook examples of good bad
acting.</P>
<P>     Talent (or lack thereof) notwithstanding, the four do pretty well
for about an hour.  With Baldwin in the lead, they plan their crosses
and double-crosses and create a level of tension that never evaporates
from the film.</P>
<P>     The pace stinks and nothing's funny, but director has a flair for
action that keeps the first hour interesting.  The midday robbery at a
dog track is a keeper.  As is a chase on a train with Baldwin stalking
a petty thief.</P>
<PRE>     Then a bomb drops with Slim Pickens ridin'.</PRE>
<P>     Mousey-voiced Jennifer Tilly shows up around the film's midpoint
and completely changes the tone of the film.  Playing a dim-but-buxom
hostage, she has the Meyer Touch: every scene she touches turns to
camp.  Which is frustrating as all get-out because the rest of the cast
is playing things straight!</P>
<P>     Of course, a little unintentional humor isn't bad.  Until the
writers beginning adding their *own* jokes into the last half-hour.  By
the inevitable Big Shoot-Out, everyone's going in three different
directions.  Some are doing deadpan.  Some are trying to be funny.
Others are funny *without* trying.</P>
<PRE>     Sample dialogue from finale:
        Tilly to Madsen:  "What's the plan?"
        Madsen to Tilly:  "The plan is shaddup."</PRE>
<P>     If nothing else, THE GETAWAY rewards the patent with a few
deliriously dumb moments.  Madsen talking tough with a kitten on his
chest is something to see.  As is Basinger and Baldwin having a
heart-to-heart in a landfill.  But, for my money, nothing screams
"stop" louder than the sight of a Basinger haymaker striking Tilly's
joke jaw.</P>
<PRE>Has it really come to this?</PRE>
<PRE>Bottom line:    Roger Donaldson's flat remake of "The Getaway" is
                a tolerable tonic to a season weighted with heavy
                drama.  If nothing else, it's a great warm-up for
                Baldwin, who'll be lurking this summer as...
                The Shadow.</PRE>
