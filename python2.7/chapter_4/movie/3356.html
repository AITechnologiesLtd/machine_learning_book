<P>     Tommy Lee Jones is the best thing behind COBB, director Ron
Shelton's broadly played "biography" of baseball great Ty Cobb.  By all
accounts, the immortal Cobb broke more than just records.  He was
everything from a racist, to a wife beater, to a man who attacked a
handicapped heckler during a stadium game.  Jones plays the part
wide-open, and you can't take your eyes off of him.</P>
<P>     Costar Robert Wuhl is another matter entirely--he's *all* wrong
for the part of the sportswriter-turned-biographer.  The actor may have
a greater range, but here he acts like the dopey sidekick.  He shows
about five facial expressions total and, since he's in nearly every
scene, he basically kills the tone.  The overblown music suggests that
COBB is a drama.  You'd never know it from watching Wuhl.</P>
<P>     If this trip's worth taking it's because of the script.  Shelton
gives Jones a few great lines, and the actor hits each one right over
the fence.  On rude behavior: "life's too short to be a diplomat." On
Babe Ruth: "he ran okay for a fat man."  The gems are few and
far-between, thanks to the poor pacing, but at least they're there.</P>
<P>     When COBB finally wraps, it wraps thirty minutes too late.</P>
