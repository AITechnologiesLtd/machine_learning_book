I'M GONNA GIT YOU, SUCKA
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>It's not easy to categorise films in general, but with
comedies thing seem much simpler. There are three types of
comedies - situation comedies, character comedies, and,
finally, parodies. Parodies are the easiest form and that
can be proved by the way Hollywood made them in the 1980s.
Those made by the Zucker-Abrachams team are classic example
- bunch of hillarious gags, usually ridiculing most of the
commercial hits released in few last years, patched together
with something resembling the plot. I'M GONNA GIT YOU,
SUCKA, made in 1988, is also a parody, but parody with a
difference. First of all, it has some major theme to be
parodied - blaxploitation movies of 1970s. It is also a
author's work - talented black comedian Keenen Ivory Wayans
wrote the screenplay, directed the film and stared in the
main role.</P>
<P>The plot is set in a ghetto ("Every Ghetto U.S.A.", says the
opening title) where young black man just became another
victim of "O.G." - fatal overdose of gold chains. His
brother Jake Spade (Keenen Ivory Wayans) returns from the
Army and finds the remaining family under pressure from
goons who work for local crime lord Mr. Big (John Vernon).
Determined to protect the family, avenge brother and clean
his neighbourhood from gangsters, Jake seeks help from John
Slade (Bernie Casey), his childhood idol who used to fight
the criminals in 1970s. Slade reassembles his old crew -
Kung Fu Jones (Steve James), Hammer (Isaac Hayes) and
Slammer (Jim Brown) and they begin with their crusade.</P>
<P>It is a sad thing that I'M GONNA GIT YOU, SUCKA was made in
1988. Audience at the time probably didn't understand or
appreciate the blaxpoitation in-jokes and other period
references (like the BRADY BUNCH theme in the background),
unlike today's audience, accustomed to the great 1970s
revival. Any way, jokes in this film are of various quality,
often lame; Wayans, however, compensates that with some real
pearls. And most of all, Wayans obviously liked doing this
film, and same can be said about various performers. It is
great fun to see some blaxploitation heroes like Bernie
Casey or Jim Brown playing ten or fifteen years older,
middle-aged versions of themselves. Wayans also uses the
talents of his family - his brother Damon (later noted in
THE LAST BOY SCOUT) shines in a small, but memorable role of
Mr. Big's goon. The soundtrack was also good and utilised
for some good jokes. All in all, the film was perhaps badly
directed and some jokes aren't funny, but as a whole, it
isn't just entertaining for the audience, but it is also a
tribute to blaxploitation phenomenon.</P>
