<P>First, Juliette Lewis was dating Brad Pitt. Bounce. Then Brad Pitt hooked up
with Gwyneth Paltrow and Juliette Lewis visited a rehab center. Bounce. Then
Gwyneth Paltrow moved on to the next best thing in Ben Affleck and Brad Pitt
got cozy with Jennifer Aniston. Bounce. The next thing you know, Brad Pitt
marries Jennifer Aniston, and Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck break up.
Bounce. Then word on the street is that Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow are
still dating. Bounce. Then, JoBlo realizes that he has to get a life and
stop coming up with cheap gimmicky ways to start his movie reviews. Bounce.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A cocky guy who wants to stay in town to nail a girl he just met in a bar
gives his plane ticket away to a nice guy who wants to get home to his
family in time for Christmas. The plane crashes and everyone aboard it dies.
The cocky guy suddenly feels very bad about his place in life and the wife
of the nice guy is heartbroken about the loss of her husband. One year
later, after getting out of rehab, the cocky guy turns into a nicer guy and
follows his guilty conscience to meet the widow of the deceased man. Without
her knowing who he is, they start to develop a nice relationship together.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A solid relationship movie which cannot be brushed aside with the simple tag
of a "chick flick". This film delivers on many fronts including an
interesting story, drama, humor, engaging characters and surprisingly, a
decent helping of multi-leveled acting. I could generally tell if a "sad
movie" touches me just by the appearance of water in my eyes, and this
son-of-a-bitch had me tearing up left and right. Nice. I call this is a "sad
movie" because it is not an upbeat film by any stretch of the imagination.
It's serious, it deals with a very painful subject and it doesn't pretend to
phony up to many of the Hollywood standards. The ending is left ajar, the
complicated feelings associated with the characters in the film are massaged
from top to bottom and the relationship is not automatically cured with a
catch phrase. Basically, the film gives us a true to life tale of a bad
stretch in the lives of two people, during which they must come to terms
with their own feelings of guilt and unworthiness, before tackling a
relationship with another. The film is also moved along by this whole
connection between the two main characters, but that part of the film didn't
interest me as much as their own inner-struggles. In fact, I thought that
the revelation of the so-called "secret" to Gwyneth's character took a
little too long to be divulged.</P>
<P>I mean, as an audience member, we are in on the concealment from the get-go
and the waiting game just starts to weigh on you after a while. Acting-wise,
I was quite surprised by the performance put forth here by Ben Affleck, who
has proven to be a pro at banging out the charisma, looking great and
running and shooting at the same time, but here he takes it all onto another
level. He makes you like his character despite his many, many flaws. He also
made me cry, and for that, kudos go out to you, young man. Keep up the solid
work. Gwyneth was also very believable as the other half of this film,
especially since she had to play against type, a regular woman with regular
problems. In the end, the characters and the chemistry between the two leads
are what make this story work because you believe in their sorrow, their
hurt and their eventual resolution of issues. I can't say that I found too
many things wrong with this movie. The story was an interesting one. The
characters were believable and well played out. The touching moments were
touching and the lighter moments light. I guess I would've preferred less
time spent keeping the secret away from Gwynnie, but that's just a small
miscalculation, in my humble opinion. Overall, I doubt that this film will
win any awards or cha-chink its way through the box-office, but for me, it
was definitely one of the nicer surprise movies of the year. The kind that
you'll either really like or really think sucks.</P>
