102 DALMATIANS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Cruella De Vil is back with a new name -- "just call me Ella" -- and now 
she is a real sweetheart who is ready to lead protests against fur 
fashions.  She is dogdom's number one friend.  "What!" you say.</P>
<P>Did I forget to mention her treatment under Doctor Pavlov (David 
Horovitch) who has cured her of her evil ways?  This is lucky for her 
since a judge (Timothy West) has sentenced her to give all of her money 
to the 2nd Chance dog shelter if she is ever caught dognapping again.  
Kevin (Ioan Gruffudd from SOLOMON AND GAENOR) runs the shelter, and he 
and Chloe (Alice Evans), Ella's probation officer, form the story's love 
interest.  If you suspect that Ella will revert to her nefarious alter 
ego, you would, of course, be right.</P>
<P>Let me say upfront that for whatever reason, probably thanks to director 
Kevin Lima (TARZAN), 102 DALMATIANS is much better than it's immediate 
predecessor, 101 DALMATIANS.  (Neither, however, is better than the 
animated original.)  Glenn Close, having a ball chewing up the scenery, 
is terrific, but it's the dogs that make the show.</P>
<P>The best dog of the bunch has to be the eminently lovable Oddball.  A 
Dalmatian who hasn't gotten his spots yet, he is obsessed with them.  He 
suffers from such spot anxiety that Chloe has to spell out the word 
("s-p-o-t") when she's around him.  This lack of dots gives Oddball lots 
of opportunities to get into trouble trying to acquire them.  The 
spilled ink from a photocopier's toner cartridge is just one such source 
of black splotches.  Oddball is Mr. Mischief and the dog most likely to 
appear in the dog endangerment scenes that make the film's G rating a 
bit questionable.  (There were several blood curdling screams from 
little tykes in our audience when it looked like Oddball was going to be 
a goner.)</P>
<P>Coming in second in the cuteness derby is a rottweiler named 
Waddlesworth.  An unusual dog, he has colorful feathers and a beak, 
although he doesn't think he can fly.  Actually, he's a talking Macaw 
(voiced by Eric Idle), who just thinks that he is a canine.  Giving a 
single animal the ability of speech makes the story funny without being 
too silly.  </P>
<P>Sometimes the simplest scenes of the dogs wagging their tails are so 
cute that you can't help but break into a big smile.  And the sets and 
the costumes alone can provoke quite a few laughs.  </P>
<P>Finally, there is Gérard Depardieu, as fur fashion designer Monsieur Le 
Pelt.  Depardieu doesn't have much of a part, but he makes the most of 
it.  Always pronouncing puppies as "poopies," he sounds like he just 
walked off the Rugrats set.  When we first see him, he is parading his 
rotund body down a fashion show runway in leopard hot pants and a 
leopard-head crotch protector.  102 DALMATIANS is first and foremost a 
movie ripe with physical comedy.  The dialog is treated as almost an 
afterthought.</P>
<P>So what video would a bunch of dogs want to watch when their master is 
on a date?  Kevin's dogs go for LADY AND THE TRAMP.  In one of the 
story's best sequences, the movie cuts between the video and Kevin and 
Chloe enjoying spaghetti just like Lady and the Tramp.  The only 
disappointment is that they never share a single strand as they do in 
the video.  On the whole, however, 102 DALMATIANS is a good spirited 
movie that rarely disappoints.</P>
<P>102 DALMATIANS runs 1:41.  It is rated G, but the "poopie" endangerment 
scenes may scare some kids under 5.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, gave the film ***.  He really liked Oddball and 
Waddlesworth, but complained that he missed the dogs from the first 
movie.  Maxim, age 12, went wild over the picture and gave it ****.  His 
favorite part was the cake scene.  Nickolas, age 11, gave it *** 1/2, 
having similar comments to Jeffrey's.  Eliot, age 11, on the other hand, 
hated the movie, giving it just * 1/2.  He complained that it wasn't 
original and that it didn't link properly to the first film.  The votes 
from the rest of Jeffrey's 6th grade class were quite positive although 
there were a few who didn't like it.</P>
