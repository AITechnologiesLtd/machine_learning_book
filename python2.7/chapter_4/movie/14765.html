<PRE>                    GOD SAID "HA!" (United States)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: This is a one-woman show.  Julia Sweeney (who played the
androgynous Pat on Saturday Night Live) relives the humor and horror of
having her brother and parents move in with her just before her brother
was diagnosed with lymph cancer.  Not all of the humor works and some
of the telling style seems a little artificial.  But most seems sincere
and is frequently moving.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), 1 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Sweeney got a divorce and a house by herself when her brother was
     diagnosed to be in the last phase of lymph cancer.  He moves in
     with her and so do her parents.  This would have been a trying
     time in anybody's life.  Her humor concerns jokes made about her
     parents, her brother, her attempts to date, and generally how her
     life was going.  Some moments are very funny, some touching, some
     not quite on the mark.
   - Performance in the style of Spaulding Gray's SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA
     and MONSTER IN A BOX.
   - The show seems sort of artificial in some ways.  After a
     particularly trying moment the lights change and she turns her
     back to the audience and gets a glass of water.  It is as if the
     emotion has all been orchestrated.  Of course this is really a
     performance of a stage play that she had enacted hundreds of times
     before this version was filmed.  It has to have a different
     emotional impact once it has been performed on the stage for
     years.  Still parts do still pack a wallop.
   - One wonders how much the stories have been embellished.
   - Balancing her love life and her parents living in while taking
     care of her brother.
   - Certainly some of the hardest moments she will face in her life.
   - Sweeney does have a nice self-assured style.</P>
