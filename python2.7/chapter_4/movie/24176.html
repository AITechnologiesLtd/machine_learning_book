<P>IN SHORT: Killer comedy. Killer creepshow. Killer indie arthouse flick.</P>
<P>As always, no comparison is made to the Source Material.</P>
<P>It will probably help your appreciation of American Psycho if you hit
the ground running during the 1980s, or were close to the kind of yuppie
mentality that was oppressive during those days -- kidlets just out of
college making way too much money and spending that cash freely and
openly on status stuff. The right kind of suit, tie, eyeglass frame,
luggage and so forth. All flash and little substance. The stereotype
that generated catcalls of "DIE YUPPIE SCUM DIE!" (Understand here that
Cranky was a director for NBC back in them days, making way too much
money at way too young an age . . .</P>
<P>.. . . but good God, it was nothing like the Wall Street buttholes that
are center stage in American Psycho.)</P>
<P>Perhaps it's a good thing there's a whole lot of breathing room between
now and then. That makes this story of a serial killer to whom DIE
YUPPIE SCUM DIE is a manifestation of incredible self-hatred and/or
guilt  -- and/or just another career choice – all the more bearable.</P>
<P>American Psycho so perfectly recreates that 80s Yuppie bullshit that,
despite the fact that it's been well publicized as being about a serial
killer, the film is very funny. From the title credits on out, where
what appear to be droplets of blood fall across a virgin white screen,
this flick is killer funny. Four lookalike Yuppie's drop their platinum
cards to split the dinner check at an ever so trendy restaurant. Their
conversation consist of vainglorious egocentric boasts, one after
another (when they're not dissing anyone not like them, or backstabbing
fellow employees at the Wall Street firms where they work)</P>
<P>Center of the story is Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a Wall Street
type working for Dad, making insane amounts of money and doing very
little obvious work. When in the process of picking up a model type at a
trendy club, Bateman  is asked what line he's in. "Murders and
Acquisitions," he says, quite honestly. "Mergers and Acquisitions" is
what everyone hears. That's the perfect slam on 80s yuppie-dom. If it
ain't about the green, it ain't never gonna be seen on the internal
radar. Welcome to the morgue . . .</P>
<P>Bateman carefully details for us every aspect of his life, from the
number of stomach crunches he can do to the kind of exfoliant he uses to
keep his skin looking young and fresh. He lives in a world where the
printing on a business card speaks volumes. Where he doesn't mind taking
his sexual fantasies out on street hookers and "high class" call girls,
sometimes two at a time. Where he believes that his fiancee Evelyn
Williams (Reese Witherspoon) is probably having an affair, which is all
right 'cuz he's sleeping with her zonked to the gills best friend
Courtney (Samantha Mathis). There's something perversely funny about all
of this, which makes American Psycho a very funny movie.</P>
<P>Just when you begin to get the comfortable with the notion that the
"Psycho" of the title refers only to a headcase slash nutjob, out comes
a knife and a homeless man goes down for the count. Bateman doesn't
restrict his kills to the anonymous street folk, however. One side
effect of yuppie-dom is that everyone tended to look alike . . . and
Bateman does not like being confused for someone higher on the corporate
food chain. His bloodlust is such that he doesn't mind taking out people
in his own circle. Prior to the upper-class kills, Bateman spouts like a
music critic, analyzing the complexities and deep meanings in songs by
Phil Collins and Whitney Houston -- artists disdained by the general 80s
Yuppie establishment (even as we bought the CDs and hid them under the
mattress). When Bateman goes into his spiel, well, certain characters
you'll meet you won't want to see snuffed. Mary Harron's direction
evokes some unbearable tension, even as the modus operandi elevates from
knife to ax to industrial strength construction equipment, and so on.</P>
<P>You know in your guts that it's just a matter of time before the killing
spree catches up to Bateman. When it does; let's just say that "Psycho"
has a lot of meanings, all of which you may find yourself discussing
after the fact. Also of note in the cast are Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's
secretary Jean and Jared Leto as Paul Allen, one of those other yuppies
who disappears from view. A private detective (Willem DaFoe) comes a
calling. It's just a question of whether he's in the case to find a
killer, or if he's in the case to protect the upper-upper-class from
embarrassment in the New York Post.</P>
<P>There's a third alternative answer to this equation . . . but that would
be telling.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to American Psycho, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$7.00</PRE>
<P>Cranky bought in whole hog. American Psycho is so perfect for the
arthouse circuit that it may not break out of that after the first week.
As written, if you don't lock into the period, you may not find much to
laugh about and, in that case, it's a long time until you get to the
unpleasant parts.</P>
