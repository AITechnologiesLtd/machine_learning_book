<P>---A copy of this review will be posted to

24, 2000.---</P>
<P>Watching Wonder Boys is somewhat akin to viewing the last two-minutes of 
a football game where your home team simply cannot muster the needed 
points to emerge victorious. The players, Michael Douglas, Tobey 
Maguire, Frances McDormand, Robert Downey Jr. and Katie Holmes, all 
maintain hometown-hero status with solid efforts. Unfortunately though, 
the game has run so long that your attention fades in and out and those 
last few passes reek of disparity as the quarterback tries to force 
something that simply doesn't work.</P>
<P>Grady Tripp (Academy Award Winner Michael Douglas) is a college 
English professor who finds his life in shambles as his wife leaves him, 
he struggles with a 2611-page unfinished novel and carries on an affair 
with the chancellor (Academy Award Winner Francis McDormand). His 
solution: dope.</P>
<P>James Leer (Tobey Maguire) is one of Tripp's students. His writing is 
ridiculed by the class, his personal life is dark and mysterious but his 
potential proves to be unlimited with a new book he has written. His 
solution: carrying a gun.</P>
<P>Terry Crabtree (former inmate Robert Downey Jr.) is a down-and-out 
homosexual editor seeking success and a new sexual partner. His 
solution: Tripp's book and Leer's body.</P>
<P>So, to recap, we have a lot of dope, a murder weapon, an unfinished 
novel, a finished novel, an affair and a group of characters with 
problems. Throw in a hood-jumper (Richard Knox), a wise student (Katie 
Holmes), Marilyn Monroe's wedding coat, a dead dog, a Howard Johnson 
parking lot and a forgotten backpack and there's plenty happening in 
the confusion-dominated football game.</P>
<P>Despite being given the opportunity to express a panoply of emotions in 
his self-discovering character, Michael Douglas always makes the 
conservative call and consequently fails to rouse up the crowd even if 
he is getting the job done adequately. Francis McDormand and Tobey 
Maguire both seem to go the extra yard, however. McDormand has an 
ordinary quality that is rare among actresses today- probably the reason 
for her Fargo Oscar- and she reaffirms acting competence here. Maguire 
confirms that he is to the depressive seeking enlightenment what Jack 
Palance is to the old western cowboy. With Pleasantville and The Cider 
House Rules as previous evidence of this trait, the 25 year-old actor is 
Hollywood's newest typecast thanks to this role that is practically 
made for him.</P>
<P>Wonder Boys first hits trouble with the Tripp/chancellor relationship. 
In a film with an otherwise interesting set of plot circumstances, the 
old boy-likes-girl-who-questions-affection-for-boy-untill-boy-
accidentally-does-something-indirectly-affecting-her-and-is-afraid-to-
tell-but-ultimately-she-confrontes-him-with-forgiveness is a tad too
textbook for the film. Ditto the other major development in their
relationship, or, to speak more properly, in her womb.</P>
<P>The movie's plot loses steam well before the fourth quarter even 
begins and things aren't helped by a desperately forced ending that is 
even more textbook than the aforementioned relationship.</P>
<P>This year, hundreds of millions of people looked on as the Super Bowl 
came down to 36 inches. Hopefully not even a fraction of those people 
will subject themselves to this production that sets itself up for a 
hopeless fourth and long and doesn't have 30-second Budweiser spots to 
tide the audience over.</P>
