<PRE>                      HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Different women love men for varied reasons.  Some may not call it
"love" but by whatever name, they are happy or unhappy.  accept their
lot or fight back.  Bringing the stories of each of the women together
is accomplished by the writer of the screenplay, Jane Anderson and
director Jocelyn Moorehouse with the help of a cast, led by Winona
Ryder, that is outstanding.</P>
<P>     Finn (Ryder) has graduated from Berkeley and is spending the
summer at the home of her grandmother, Hy (Ellen Burstyn) and
great-aunt, Gladys Joe (Anne Bancroft) in California.  She is there for
two reasons: her boyfriend, Sam (Dermot Mulroney) has proposed marriage
and she wants time to think about it.  The second reason is she is
trying to finish a thesis on the rituals of women's handiwork in tribal
cultures.</P>
<P>     A group of women, led by Anna (Maya Angelou) long ago started a
quilting bee at Hy and Gladys Joe's home where she once was a maid but
is now the expert on the quilting.  Others in the bee are Constance
(Kate Nelligan), Em (Jean Simmons), Sophia (Lois Smith) and Marianne
(Alfre Woodard) who is Anna's daughter.</P>
<P>     As the quilt is being made, Finn is unaware that it is for her
wedding whenever that should happen.  Meanwhile, through flashbacks,
the stories of the women are revealed; a husband's death, another
husband's infidelity immediately after marriage but is always forgiven
by the wife because "that's how he is."  Each has her own tale to
tell.  There is even a discussion about whether marriage is still a
useful convention.  Finn hears it all.</P>
<P>     Others in the cast include Kate Capshaw and Rip Torn.  What
further enhances the film is the mood, the tone, the unhurried pace
and, for me, the surprise ending.</P>
