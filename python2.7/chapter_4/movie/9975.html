<P>starring John Leguizamo, Michael Jai White, Martin Sheen, D.B. Sweeney
screenplay by Alan McElroy, based on Todd McFarlane's comic books
directed by Mark A.Z. Dippe</P>
<P>The makers of Spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this
summer's other comic book adaptation, Batman and
Robin. Both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only
the
look of their graphic counterparts, but also their monosyllabic
dialogue and empty-headed
character motivations. In panel-sized morsels, implausible plots and
"Rambo"-esque
dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork, but on thirty foot
silver screens, it's
much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty
pictures.</P>
<P>Spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named Simmons (White) who is
framed
by a corporate baddie (played without irony by Sheen), then set on
fire and left for dead.
Though the movie skimps on the next few plot points, here's what I
could determine: said
assassin then becomes the leader of Satan's army, under the tutelage
of a flatulating midget
named Clown (Leguizamo, grating as always). He is renamed, for reasons
unbeknownst,
Spawn, and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become
something of a
human chameleon. But when Spawn spies on a birthday party for his
child, he realizes that
he can't be the evil superdemon he's expected to be, and he sets about
avenging his
untimely death.</P>
<P>Typical of summer blockbusters, Spawn is an effects-laden ninety
minute rock
video. While the visions of hell are laughably crude (think the
virtual reality sequences of
The Lawnmower Man), Spawn's prehensile outfit and the action sequences
are truly something to behold. But the storytelling is completely
lacking in emotion
(Spawn longs for his wife, but they don't have a single scene together
before Simmons'
death!), conflict (who will triumph is not anybody's guess), and
believability (not that I
expected it). So many questions are left unanswered, and I'm sure they
won't be addressed
in the inevitable sequel.</P>
<P>While last year's The Crow: City of Angels
suffered similar problems with its narrative (which was lazy and
somewhat incoherent), it
had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power. Spawn
is
an in-your-face, screaming banshee of a film; these guys know how to
graft a comic book
onto celluloid, but they haven't the faintest idea how to make a
movie.</P>
