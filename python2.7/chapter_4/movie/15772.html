<PRE>Review: The Prince Of Egypt</PRE>
<P>Directed by Brenda Chapman and Steve Hickner</P>
<P>Voices of: Val Kilmer, Michelle Pfieffer, Danny Glover, Steve Martin, Jeff Goldblum, Martin Short, Sandra Bullock and Ralph Fiennes</P>
<PRE>Approx 93 min</PRE>
<P>Perhaps the best thing about The Prince of Egypt is that it was
directed as if the characters were tangible, and the camera was
actually moving through the film's dazzling landscape. Modern
technology has afforded animated films the luxury of looking just like
live action films in the way the camera is free to move and focus. Not
only is The Prince Of Egypt pretty to look at, well acted (by the
voices, of course) and well animated, but it is really well directed.</P>
<P>This story comes from the Book of Exodus. It takes us through the
discovery of Moses as a baby as he is taken in by the Pharoah. He is
raised as Egyptian royalty (along with future Pharoah Ramses) even
though he is born Hebrew. As an adult he discovers his true heritage
and exiles himself from Egypt. As a Hebrew shepard, God speaks to him
through the burning bush. The second half of the film is Moses'
journey back into Egypt to confront Ramses and free the Hebrew
slaves. With some artistic liberties (as the begining of the film
claims) the story is faithful. The blood in the water, the plagues,
Passover, the parting of the Red Sea all make their appearance.</P>
<P>Perhaps the only flaw in this film (aside from the abrupt musical
numbers, which are a flaw in ALL musicals) is the set of Ramses'
goons. They are voiced by Martin Short and Steve Martin (the latter of
which is so recognizable that it is extremely distracting). Their
characters simply do not fit, neither thier physical appearance nor
their personalities. Thankfully, they play a rather small
part. Perhaps what makes them flawed is that they seem more fit for a
Disney movie, and Dreamworks clearly wanted to separate themselves
from the notion that they are like thier animation counterparts.</P>
<P>The new digital age really makes its impact in animated films. Digital
effects just don't look real in live action pictures, but they make
animation astounding. There are numerous scenes in The Prince Of Egypt
which were unachievable five years ago. The parting of the Red Sea is
perhaps not the most amazing (as wonderful as it is.) The early
chariot race, the plagues and the burning bush are all equally
powerful.</P>
<P>It is unique to see an animated film tell such a story. There are no
fairy tale elements to this story. What you see can be found in the
bible. And yet as Moses reaches the top of the mount to present to his
people the ten commandments of their god, it is as powerful as Simba's
birth and eventual return to Pride Rock in The Lion King (to me, the
most wonderful animated film of all time.) With Disney's latest turn
for the worst in terms of animation style and weak story and weaker
characters, The Prince Of Egypt stands out as a destined classic. It
has a beautifully unique cinematic style, physically interesting
characters and music that, though unnecessary, does not detract from
the picture. The Prince Of Egypt is one of the year's best motion
pictures.</P>
