<P>If the sole purpose of movies was to offer up gorgeous scenery and 
camerawork, intermixed with astoundingly memorable and quirky music 
(including a score by David Lynch regular Angelo Badalamenti), then "The 
Beach," directed by Danny Boyle (1996's "Trainspotting"), would be an instant 
modern-day classic. It is a shame, then, that viewers usually look for 
something extra when they watch a film. Generally, they search for substance, 
well-written characters, or, at the very least, a fresh story that doesn't 
hold its audience in contempt. Guess what movie would like you to believe it 
has these things, but fails miserably at success on all three accounts?</P>
<P>Leonardo DiCaprio (in his first starring role since the unintentional 1998 
laugh-riot, "The Man in the Iron Mask") stars as Richard, a young man 
traveling through Thailand who, through narration, tells us that his name is 
the only thing we need to know about him. He is in a new country, after all, 
and he's starting over--in other words, he should be looked upon as a tabula 
rasa. Checking into a relatively scuzzy hotel room positioned between a 
French couple, the alluringly beautiful Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and her 
boyfriend Etienne (Guillaume Canet), and a crazed Scot named Daffy (Robert 
Carlyle), Richard learns from Daffy that there is an island of sheer 
perfection and beauty hidden deep within the Gulf of Thailand. Very few 
people know about it, and even fewer have been able to find and reach it. The 
next day, Richard discovers Daffy has committed suicide in his room, but not 
before leaving him a map to the island.</P>
<P>Richard wastes no time in inviting Francoise and Etienne on his journey to 
the island, and they quickly accept. Before long, they have set off to find 
it with the map in hand, and by the 30-minute-mark, have reached the 
rapturous paradise, where a small community lives and works together in peace 
and harmony, free of the noise and problems of the outside world. Richard, 
Francoise, and Etienne instantly move in with the inhabitants, but it is 
obvious Richard has been pining for Francoise throughout the whole trip. 
Meanwhile, the leader of the island, Sal (Tilda Swinton), has her eye on 
Richard, despite having a boyfriend of her own. </P>
<P>If "The Beach" wants to partially be a romance, it is one of the most 
uncharismatic love stories possibly ever made. While Richard is an intriguing 
character, we know little about him aside from his aforementioned name, the 
fact that he enjoys smoking pot, and his occasional scaredy-cat mentality. 
Leonardo DiCaprio, despite being a wildly popular mega-star due to 1997's 
"Titanic," really is a fine actor, and he does everything he possibly can to 
bring his character alive and equipped with more dimension than is written on 
the page. Richard can be a highly annoying presence whose mouth you would 
love to tape shut every now and again, but that is an appropriate trait to 
the figure he plays, a basically care-free free spirit enjoying his youth 
while it lasts. </P>
<P>Francoise, in comparison, is a completely disposable character without any 
sort of charm or personality, and we learn literally nothing about her, 
outside of her physical appearance. It is difficult to say if young French 
actress Virginie Ledoyen, making her American film debut here, has any 
thespian talents, but my suspicions point to a resounding "no." Even if the 
role is severely underwritten, any good actress would be able to turn 
Francoise into someone who, at least, is likable or kind-natured. Ledoyen 
plays her like a mannequin--lifeless and without the ability to show 
emotions.  </P>
<P>Richard and Francoise have zero chemistry together, and it is tough to say 
what Richard sees in someone who might as well be placed in a living room 
around the holidays and have ornaments and lights hung around her body. Their 
relationship is haphazardly written, by John Hodge, and executed, by Boyle, 
and there is no way any audience member could care enough about them to 
invest their emotions into the fate of their romance.</P>
<P>In the other two notable roles are Guillaume Canet, as Etienne, and Tilda 
Swinton (1993's "Orlando"), as Sal. Canet is unextraordinary, and his 
character is surprisingly written to be wimpy in the second half, when he 
does not even care either way that Richard stole Francoise from him. After a 
very brief exchange of words, this possible love triangle evaporates and 
another pseudo one comes to the forefront. On a trip to the mainland to get 
supplies, Richard and Sal engage in sexual activity, and Sal tells him 
afterwards that she already has a boyfriend and is uninterested in beginning 
a relationship; she just wanted the sex. Swinton, an excellent actress who 
isn't used nearly enough, is able to develop a character, to a degree, and 
portrays Sal as a strong-willed, determined woman who only wishes for their 
sacred beach to remain undiscovered.</P>
<P>Approximately fifteen minutes into the film's second hour, "The Beach" makes 
a U-turn and becomes a thriller, as four travelers whom Richard mistakenly 
gave a map to, are seen across the water preparing to cross to the island. 
When Sal finds this out, she demands that he stay in the woods until they 
reach the other side, and then turn them away somehow. Forced into solitude 
and without food or Francoise, Richard gradually begins to lose his mind, 
turning into a prowler of the island's forests. But why? The details into 
Richard's startling transformation are kept under wraps, only, I suppose, for 
the filmmakers to know the answer to.</P>
<P>It is unfortunate that the screenplay lets the cast and plot developments 
down, because "The Beach" is a towering technical achievement. The 
cinematography, by Darius Khondji (who blessed us with the haunting and 
unforgettable look of 1999's "In Dreams"), does not disappoint in capturing a 
beach that is supposedly one of the most pure and beautiful patches of land 
on the Earth. The choice of music (by such bands as New Order, Sugar Ray, All 
Saints, and Moby) is perfectly realized and compliments the pretty pictures 
with a dream-like quality, while the score, by Badalamenti, is resplendent.</P>
<P>"The Beach" is based on a novel by Alex Garland, and like most film 
adaptations, has allegedly taken great liberties in telling the story. How 
the picture might have been if more closely related to the book remains to be 
known (since I have never read it), but something tells me much of it has 
been chopped up due to the studio (20th-Century Fox) seeking a more 
mainstream product for DiCaprio's teenybopper fans to enjoy. They might as 
well have not even attempted it, as the film will leave DiCaprio's younger 
followers in the dark, or away from the theater, based on its rightful 
R-rating. </P>
<P>Director Boyle would love to think he has made a motion picture with powerful 
pro-ecological undercurrents about the deflowering of a nation and the 
possible purity a hidden world might have the ability to hold, but this 
statement is about as subtle as a neon sign, and about as thought-provoking 
as a piece of grilled chicken. "The Beach" is not at all a bad film--simply a 
misguided one that is ruined by an amateurish screenplay that is missing 
three important elements: a heart, a brain, and the nerve to be courageous in 
its storytelling. Wow, I suddenly feel like I just entered into an alternate 
world of "The Wizard of Oz"--one in which the Emerald City is devoid of any 
sense of magic, wonder, or human compassion.</P>
