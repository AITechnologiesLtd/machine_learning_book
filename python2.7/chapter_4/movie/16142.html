<P>URBAN LEGEND
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: **1/2 (out of ****)
TriStar / 1:38 / 1998 / R (violence, gore, language, sex, innuendo)
Cast: Alicia Witt; Jared Leto; Rebecca Gayheart; Michael Rosenbaum; Tara 
Reid; Joshua Jackson; Loretta Devine; Robert Englund; John Neville; 
Danielle Harris; Natasha Gregson Wagner 
Director: Jamie Blanks 
Screenplay: Silvio Horta<HR>Another season, another teen-oriented horror flick that gleefully 
decimates a ready-for-"Tiger Beat" cast. This fall, it's "Urban Legend," 
a "Scream"-wannabe that's actually on a bit of a higher level than most 
of the recent "Scream"-wannabes. The oft-copied recipe: Take a bunch of 
pretty, young things, add one deranged serial killer, throw in some 
decent shivers and a few twists that at least guarantee a good opening 
weekend, stir, chill and serve. Summer's "Disturbing Behavior" neglected 
those last three ingredients, and thus became more of a whimper than a 
"Scream." Since "Urban Legend" remembers them to varying degrees of 
success, let's call it a loud, dry hack. </P>
<P>The movie takes place on the creepy campus of New England's Pendleton 
College, where some freaked-out student or faculty member has begun a 
murder spree (check), offing victims according to those titular tales - 
most of them campfire and sleepover favorites - that doubly function as 
social parables (check). Our heroine is beautiful, brainy upperclassman 
Natalie (Alicia Witt, check), who may hold the key to cracking the 
mystery in a dark secret buried deep in her past (check). Our hero is 
handsome journalism major Paul (Jared Leto, check), a studious reporter 
for the school paper who's determined to get this scoop no matter what 
the price (check). Carnage ensues (check, check, check). </P>
<P>Director Jamie Blanks and screenwriter Silvio Horta start better than 
they finish, with an extended "Scream"-esque prologue that depicts the 
film's first casualty, as a nervous little missy (Natasha Gregson 
Wagner) on a late-night commute loses her head in a vivid variation on 
the killer-in-the-backseat urban legend. Yikes. Most of the time, 
however, the filmmakers' scare tactics include silly false jumps and 
absurd red herrings; just about everyone around Pendleton, for example, 
owns and wears our psycho's hooded Nanook of the North-type costume. 
True, every movie in this genre relies on faux frights to generate 
suspense, but "Urban Legend" plays with them far too often to be very 
effective. </P>
<P>Yet another disappointing facet of "Urban Legend" is exactly how it 
employs the villain's violent gimmick. Only a handful of the urban 
legends he brings to life seem genuinely inspired, and all the leftovers 
don't seem to fully realize their grisly potential. Horta leaves a lot 
of possibilities unexamined, and ends up having the killer simply 
splatter coed guts across dorm walls with a large axe when he runs out 
of ideas. The campy ending also doesn't satisfy; "Urban Legend"'s 
unmasked villain not only seems physically incapable of pulling off an 
early murder involving a a tree, a noose and a moving car, but they also 
explain their master plan to the incompasitated good guy with ... 
_a_slide_show_? </P>
<P>At least the motive makes too-pat sense and there are some good in-jokes 
stretched throughout the movie's 98-minute running time; co-star Joshua 
Jackson, of "Dawson's Creek" fame, exits "Urban Legend" earlier than 
expected, but not before turning on a radio to the opening notes of 
Paula Cole's "I Don't Want to Wait." These postmodern references, along 
with the solid acting (particulary Witt and Michael Rosenbaum as a 
party-hardy frat boy), sleek production design and clever concept, add 
up to a so-so slasher film that falls a little short of delivering the 
goods. But delivering isolated scares is another matter entirely. Let's 
just say that, thanks to "Urban Legend," this critic will henceforth be 
keeping a close eye on the backseat of his car.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"After the screening was over and the lights went up, I observed a 
couple of my colleagues in deep and earnest conversation, trying to 
resolve twists in the plot. They were applying more thought to the movie 
than the makers did. A critic's mind is a terrible thing to waste."
