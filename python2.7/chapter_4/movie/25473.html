<P>"Mission: Impossible II" is not quite the equal of its predecessor -- Brian 
De Palma's 1996 adaptation of the hit TV show was a modern classic in action 
cinema -- but it is an effective spectacle of violence. It could have been 
better. It could also have been worse. Since we get to see Tom Cruise looking 
firm and strong, wearing cool clothes, fighting hard, working out genius 
plans and blowing stuff up, it's good enough for me.</P>
<P>And make no mistake about it, "Mission: Impossible II" is all about Cruise. 
Gone is the teamwork that figured so prominently both on television and in 
the original film: Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, is now the centre of 
attention. Even though he's aided by two other secret agents who come out of 
retirement to help him, a woman who injects herself with poison to assist his 
cause, and a boss played by Anthony Hopkins, these people are pushed into the 
background to make the main man look that little bit more heroic.</P>
<P>As pretty much every review of the film has mentioned, this can't help but 
resemble James Bond. De Palma's cool white visuals and playfully complex plot 
have been replaced by exotic locations and a predictable tale of a turncoat 
agent hijacking a deadly chemical virus. Taut structure has been forgone in 
favour of long scenes with a love interest, and a big showdown in the bad 
guy's lair. Set-pieces have been lifted from "Mission: Impossible" such as 
Cruise's dangling from a ceiling to steal information, as well as trademarks 
like the rubber-mask disguises, but nothing that stops "Mission: Impossible 
II" from being a one-man show. </P>
<P>It's a good one, though. The director, John Woo, is a god among action 
filmmakers. His techniques in movies like "Hard-Boiled" influenced Hollywood, 
then Woo himself moved to the States and started making pictures in which the 
style was a mixture of originality, ripping himself off, and ripping off 
America. You're assured an efficient summer thrill ride when a guy like that 
gets a project like this -- it has a great star, groundbreaking stunts, 
expensive effects, slow-motion, fast motion, repetition... so much showiness 
has been crammed into "Mission: Impossible II" that future film students will 
use it as a reference for action genre trends of the late 1990s.</P>
<P>Where can the "M: I" franchise go from here? I have a clear idea, although 
I'm not so sure that the same can be said for the studio. They have assigned 
Woo to direct a third picture, but I'm not keen on that idea, because it 
probably means we'll get a retread of this one. James Bond is allowed to 
repeat himself, but repeating his repetitions sounds boring as hell. The best 
thing to do is get a different established director to tackle each sequel. 
We've had De Palma and Woo -- wouldn't you like to see the attempts of 
Quentin Tarantino, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, George Lucas and Ron 
Howard? Keep the series going by making each new instalment a showcase for a 
great artist -- don't let it self-destruct in three movies.</P>
