<PRE>CHICKEN RUN
A film review by James Brundage

<P>Since the beginning of time (or at least the domestication of animals),
the chicken has been man's feathered enigma.  Like so many of its
feathered friends, it has fallen into the realm of the metaphor (i.e.
`He's a chicken.').  Unlike so many of its edible counterparts, it has
survived the hassles of religious communities unscathed (no one will
persecute you for eating a chicken wing).  It has found its way into the
realm of ontological questions (which came first: the chicken or the
egg), as well as into sanguine curiosity (why does a chicken continue
moving around after you cut its head off).  It has become the basic
standard for all foods (taste's like chicken).  It has changed with the
times, entering the debate about genetic engineering (see the
accusations against KFC using frank-n-roosters).  It has even, through
its progeny, entered into the world of our children (I do not like green
eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam I am).  As long as civilization has
existed, the chicken has haunted our collective hubris with its
often-charming idiocy.</P>
<P>Amongst both edible entrees and feathered friends, the chicken is the
idiot God…</P>
<PRE>… or Not.</PRE>
<P>In fact, let's admit it: there's NOTHING interesting about chickens.
Even at a petting zoo, your four year old would rather take the chance
of having his shirt chewed up or being spit upon by a lama than bother
at all with the chicken.  These dumb animals simply run away whenever
you get more than five feet from them and, after those few minutes of
chasing chickens at the petting zoo when you are in your younger years,
your fascination with chickendom cracks like an egg broken for the
omelet.  So even after seeing Peter Lord and Nick Park's feature debut,
Chicken Run – by far the single smartest family animation feature I have
seen since Toy Story – I still wonder what the hell enticed these guys
into crafting a story about chickens in the first place.</P>
<P>I don't know why they did it, and I probably never will.  All I know is
that I am glad that they did.</P>
<P>Chicken Run, a version of The Great Escape with Ginger (Julia Swalath)
taking over the part of Steve McQueen, tells the story of a farm full of
chickens at the Audubon-Auswitzch of the Tweedy egg farm.  At the Tweedy
egg farm, things are fairly routine… try to escape when you can and lay
your eggs, or it's off to the chopping block for you.  Ginger doesn't
like this life, and dreams of living anywhere outside of the farm.  Baba
(Jane Horrocks) is a complete lemming and has no trouble following
anyone, but believes that whenever Ginger is put in solitary confinement
(the trash can) she is on holiday.  Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow), a former
RAF rooster, reminisces about the good old days of fighting Jerry.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, inside of the farm, Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) focuses
herself on transforming the slave labor camp into a full-blown death
camp (by use of a pie machine) while Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth) tries
(and fails) to outsmart the chickens.  Everything continues along said
routine until Rocky the Flying Rooster (Mel Gibson) arrives, having
accidentally hit the weathervane on a misfire from the circus.  His
arrival gets Ginger cooking, and pretty soon she lays the golden egg
that may lead to freedom from the farm… they will fly out.</P>
<P>Numerous attempts to do this fail, laughs ensue, and the movie speeds
along at a chipper pace towards a conclusion that makes the rocket
sequence in Toy Story look like child's play.</P>
<P>Chicken Run's main strength as a family film comes in its ability to
seamlessly meld humor that can pander to the children and not go under
adult heads and give more intellectual parodies to adults that will
still seem funny to children, and it does this by always being aware of
just how bizarre a version of The Great Escape with poultry in it really
is (i.e. the advertised line `I don't want to be a pie' is followed by
`I don't even like gravy.').</P>
<P>In the realm of claymation, Chicken Run finds itself only in the company
of itself and other Oscar nominees.  1999's Humdrum (Peter Lord and Nick
Park's Oscar-nominated short), in which shadow puppets played with
shadow puppets, had the same level of detail in character animation,
whereas 1998's More (Mark Osborne's (Dropping Out) Oscar-nominated
short) featured the same level of detail in claymation sets and
lighting.  However, Chicken Run marks the first time near-perfection in
both arenas has come together to form near-perfect claymation… it raises
the bar for the genre as a whole.</P>
<P>Of course realistic animation isn't the point with claymation, so don't
expect Chicken Run's chickens to look like the ones you pick up at the
store: therein lies the source of their charm.  While the average
chicken may hold as much interest to you as a dead duck, this film's
chickens are well-defined characters that make you laugh, feel worry for
them, and then laugh even more.</P>
<P>All that, and you only get one `chicken and the egg' joke.</P>
<PRE>What more can you ask?</PRE>
