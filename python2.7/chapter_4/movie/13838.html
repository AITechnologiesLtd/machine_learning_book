<PRE>When Trumpets Fade</PRE>
<P>Rating: *** (Well constructed and executed motion picture) Evaluation:
Gritty, gray and unhappy World War II movie revolving on one character.  A
man is thrust into a leadership position he dislikes and even fears, and must
perform or wastes the lives of himself and his men in an obviously silly and
worthless manner.  He is not portrayed as a hero, as no man really is, and
faces challenges which are trivialized in most other war movies.  No happy or
teary ending, things just happen, though predictably (and not unrealistically
considering the operation) everyone dies at the end. Unexpectedly good made
for TV movie. Scale: ???? - Unevenly done (Full Metal Jacket, Stalingrad) *
Poor or Unimpressive (The Sands of Iwo Jima) ** Worth Seeing (Saving Private
Ryan) *** Good, Solidly Constructed Film (Platoon) **** Excellent, a
Masterpiece (Das Boot)</P>

<P>        All qualitative judgments are IMHO. It seems that Hollywood has
recently reopened its interest in the Second World War (the more or less
undeserved success of _Saving Private Ryan_ will only strengthen this
interest: look for more war movies next summer).  There are at least three
WWII movies which will be opening in theaters in the near future. HBO, not to
be outdone, made the first entry into the WWII-fest on June 27 with _When
Trumpets Fade_, a character movie about an American soldier, Manning who is
split between his will to survive and his self respect when he is made a
squad leader, and forced to continue on in a battle he will most likely die
in.  The battle is the failed offensive in the Hurtigen forest, overshadowed
in most WWII accounts by the somewhat later Battle of the Bulge. I have only
seen one other product of director John Irving's, _The Dogs of War_.  Despite
the fact that almost every mercenary stereotype is used (morally questionable
mercs, corrupt leaders of authoritarian countries, weapons smuggled by boat,
etc.) and despite the rather amateurish ordinance-heavy combat footage, I
thought it was a reasonably good movie.  The stereotypes are justified,
because just about every modern day privately contracted mercenary story
involves most of them (the business in Angola, Mike Hoare's Congo, or even
the Congo of today, just about every issue of _Soldier of Fortune_).  The
ordinance is less justfiable. Irving makes good on this mistake in
_Trumpets_.  This is probably the most ordinance-light World War II combat
movie I've seen.  One sees little more than personal weapons; the usual
Garands, Tommy guns and Mausers.  Even squad machine guns are curiously
absent, aside from occasional glimpses of firing MG42s. Artillery is
occasionally seen.  The Americans are slaughtered by a well placed group of
88mm Flak cannons.  Tanks, armored cars, buildings, mortars, airplanes,
rocket launchers are all absent. This is not to say the movie isn't bloody. 
It rates among the more graphic depictions of a battle I've seen.  Most
prominently is a scene where a large group of soldiers (company IIRC) are
caught within the 88's fields of fire, and are naturally slaughtered in
droves.  If weapons are too expensive for this HBO production,        lots of fake
blood,        exhausted and grubby looking actors who perform well, and good
filming aren't.  Many of the "I've been shot" clips are powerful, even if
they're a dime a dozen in war movies.  This is due to the good
cinematography; the gray of the Hungarian winter is well paired with the red
of the blood.  Camera angles are well chosen, and the camera does not dwell
on each wounded soldier the way other movies do (eg _Full Metal Jacket_ when
Cowboy meets the sniper).  Of course, the actors contribute to this.  Many of
these factors also combine to give the movie it's gritty, unhappy look.  It's
a most appropriate look  for this movie. However, I did have a strong
objection to the cinematography in the night assault scene close to the end. 
It was obviously shot at night, but they also obviously used a floodlight to
illuminate the actors, creating a very artificial sort of effect.  I would
have prefered it if they left things dark, and let the natural confusion, and
fear of the unknown and the dark into the scene, which is undoubtably present
in a nighttime combat operation. The thing that makes the movie, despite the
cinematography which only sets the stage, of course is the performance of the
actors.  Invariably they all run around in worn and dirty fatigues; are
unshaven (to the point that many of them look almost the same), and have a
general bearing that matches. Manning is not portrayed as the hero most other
war movies seek to find.  He is dirty, unshaven and exhausted looking; and in
the opening scene the rest of his squad is wiped out.  He is made squad
leader by his company commander; though he is completely unwilling to perform
the task.  The company commander orders, and then uses the usual excuses
("you're the only one I've got") and praise("you have the potential to be a
good leader", "you're a smart survivor") to persuade Manning.  This is an
interesting point of the film.        The Captain's points, actions, and
indifference are completely justified by the situation, yet they also condemn
Manning to death and both of them know it.  Are they simply military lies? Or
are they the Captain's best attempt to get good performance out of Manning,
or a combination of many different aspects, good and bad, of a war? Manning
reluctantly is simultaneously forced and sweet-talked into the rank of
sergeant.  He receives a squad of completely fresh replacements.  An aspect
of this film that I have not seen done well in any other movie, replacements,
is done quite well here.  The green troops look fresh, happy, and even
physically unfit (especially in the case of one fat Private Pyle type).  They
certainly do not have the air about them the "combat experienced" actors do. 
One feels sorry for them. Manning treats them unevenly.  He is no heroic,
admirable John Wayne.  He frequently treats them roughly, without much
justification.        One sympathizes with his contempt to a degree, but one cannot
but draw the conclusion that Manning is not an experienced leader.  During
one of the combat missions, he even ends up intentionally shooting one of
them, though not unjustifiably. There is obviously an air of distrust and a
Sergeant Talbot in another squad whom he dislikes makes every attempt to
increase it.  After a while, he accepts his position, and establishes a
reasonable relationship with what subordinates survive after their first
combat mission. By the end of the movie, the big fat Private Pyle tries to
save Manning, dropping his weapon and carrying Manning back to friendly
territory.  However, Manning is dead, leaving Pyle the only survivor of his
squad and the movie ends there.  Perhaps Pyle is bumped to Sergeant like
Manning, to start the movie over again, perhaps he meets a Mauser round from
pursuing Germans.  This ending is probably one of the better ones, short of
sentiment (though one detects a trace of it in some of the camera shots and
in the fact that everyone else is dead) and ambiguous, though perhaps not as
good as _Full Metal Jacket_'s combination of burning cities, nonsensical,
selfish commentary, Mickey Mouse club, and a sped-up version of the Rolling
Stone's _Paint it Black_.  Both of them just end at a logical spot; they do
not seem as artificial as, say, the ending to _All Quiet on the Western
Front_ (though the ending in both the book and in the color 1960s version are
quite powerful). The officers in this movie do not come out looking good. 
The platoon commander is just plain stupid and the captain is rather
unsympathetic towards his men. Superiors are almost completely absent and
their absence is the subject of harsh words. One technical kudo I would like
to give this film: its use of actual US hand and arm signals.  Though this
was a minor point, and perhaps questionable historical accuracy (I don't know
if signals used then were the same as today), I was still delighted that the
producers included this little bit of detail which so many other war movies
forget. In all, this was an impressive beginning to a series of Neo-WWII
films.        The fact that it was made with no name actors, on a tight budget, and
for TV makes it even more so.  The strength of the movie is based on the
characterization and actions of Manning, its good cinematography and its
attention to minor detail (the men look convincingly dirty, exhausted, and
unhappy, no mean achievement).        _When Trumpets Fade_ have set a high hurdle
for further WWII movies to pass over.</P>
