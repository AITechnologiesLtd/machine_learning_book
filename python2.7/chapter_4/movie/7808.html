<PRE>                                  CON AIR
                       A film review by Steve Kong
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Con Air is the first production of Jerry Bruckheimer's without the late Don 
Simpson. Con Air also brings Nicolas Cage back to work with Bruckheimer again. 
Last summer's The Rock was their last film working together. So how does Con 
Air hold up to The Rock?</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, a man whose life story seems to be about being 
in the wrong place at the wrong time. On his way home from the Army, Poe meets 
with his newly pregnant wife Tricia (Monica Potter) in a bar. They kiss and 
they dance, but their dance is cut short by a group of rowdy men in the bar. 
Poe and his wife leave the bar, running to their car in the rain, as they 
arrive at their car they meet those rowdy men again. In a fight with the men, 
trying to protect his wife, Poe kills one of the men. Poe is sent to jail for 
murder. After serving eight years of his sentence, he is now ready to go on 
parole.  He is ready to meet his daughter for the first time.</P>
<P>Poe catches a ride home on an airplane full of convicted murders and rapists. 
He rides along with his cellmate who is being transferred and is badly in need 
of a needle to take his insulin. John Cusack, who is quickly becoming one of 
my most favourite actors, is US Marshal Vince Larkin, who is on ground 
overseeing the transfer of all these prisoners. As the plane takes off, Cyrus 
"The Virus" Grissom (John Malkovich) and Nathan "Diamond Dog" Jones (Ving 
Rhames), two really bad men, escape their cells and take over the flight, 
dubbing the flight Con Air. From this point on, we are supposed to suspend our 
disbelief and go along for the ride. For some movies it is easy to do this, 
especially since it is the summer movie season, but in Con Air it is difficult 
to swallow.</P>
<P>Con Air tries to go over the top, like last summer's The Rock, but rookie 
director Simon West is unable to create the same excitement in the action 
sequences as Michael Bay did in The Rock. He is unable to reach the same 
level. And the end result is a movie that does not work for this exact reason. 
 West is unable to create the action sequences that would have helped the 
audience to over come the implausibility of the film.</P>
<P>The ensemble cast gives a great performance except for a few. Colm Meaney 
gives more of an annoying performance as an angry DEA agent. Renoly, as Sally 
Can't Dance, really has no place in the film more than comic relief. And to 
that extent, it is poorly executed. Steve Buscemi, as Carland "The Marietta 
Mangler" Greene, who is describe as worse than the whole Manson family 
together, is in the film, but for the life of me, I cannot figure out why.</P>
<P>On the bright side the lead performers give solid performances. Nicolas Cage 
does well as Cameron Poe, though it takes a little time to adjust to his 
strange adopted accent in this film. "If you see muh waif, tell er ah love 
er," he tells US Marshal Vince Larkin. John Malkovich is genuinely scary as 
Cyrus the Virus. He portrays Cyrus as a dangerous and insane, yet very 
intelligent man. Ving Rhames, although not as strong a performance as in 
Mission: Impossible and Pulp Fiction still pulls off a great performance.  
John Cusack is the guy that is right, but is always doubted, and as US Marshal 
Vince Larkin, he shows his frustration.</P>
<P>Con Air tries really hard to be a loud summer action movie filled with 
explosions and action, and to an extent it is successful.  But it doesn't try 
hard enough and it has many shortcomings, including the hard to swallow story 
and some weak supporting performances.  If you really have two hours to burn, 
and those two hours happen to fall into a matinee show time, then catch Con 
Air.  If not, save your money, Con Air crashes and burns before it even takes 
off.  Maybe next time Jerry Bruckheimer.</P>
