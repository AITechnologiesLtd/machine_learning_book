<PRE>Grosse Point Blank (R) ***
Starring John Cusack, Minnie Driver
Directed by George Armitage
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Receiving recomendations from friends is always a risky thing. You know that
they really want you to see the film, but somewhere in the back of your mind
you brush them off because they liked Wild Wild West or got hyped up about
Detroit Rock City. This is the place where Grosse Point Blank rested for such a
long time. I however did finally rent it. Now I'm not quite sure how to
describe this movie, it's pretty strange, a unique experience, but I'll try.</P>
<P>Martin Blank (Cusack) goes to his high school reunion to relieve stress that's
caused by him being a professional hitman. He wants to go back to the town of
Grosse Point (hence the film's title) to try and regain the affections of the
girl he stood up on prom night (Driver.) He doesn't really want to go (his
psychiatrist told him too) and begins to suspect something when a man place a
bomb in an Utlimart to try and kill him.  </P>
<P>Another big hitman (Dan Aykroyd) has come to town to try and convince Martin to
join a hitman's union. When he refuses he becomes angered and hires someone to
kill him. Not to mention that Martin has someone that he's assigned to kill
that lives in the town. As for the reunion, it's pretty dull, at least until
Martin goes and checks his locker.</P>
<P>Quite an interesting plotline and quite an interesting experience. Cusack and
Driver made a cute couple, there both very good. An interesting mix in
supporting cast as well, especially Joan Cusack (the movie is all in the
family) as Martin's secretary. There are plenty of sharp hits and pokes that go
to all sorts of people, especially jabs at professional killers and high school
reunions. The end was a little strange and I didn't really feel that what
happened resolved the conflicts brought up in the picutre. There is also a lot
of un-needed scenes which add to the film's running time. A little too violent
and a little too witty for it's own good, Grosse Point Blank gets *** stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film contains strong (often bloody) violence, a recurring
theme of killing people, and language. Good Age: 14 & Up</P>
