<PRE>    Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills (1996)
                   A film review by Dave Cowen
                    Copyright 1996 Dave Cowen</PRE>
<P>There's a giddy moment in the second half of PARADISE LOST: THE 
CHILD MURDERS AT ROBIN HOOD HILLS when, entirely through events that 
would not have happened had the documentary filmmakers not been there,
a whole new spin on the circumstances surrounding the murders that 
PARADISE LOST is documenting develops. Perhaps MAN BITES DOG was 
prophetic after all: some of the best documentaries we've seen over 
the last few years (ROGER & ME, HEIDI FLEISS: HOLLYWOOD MADAM) have 
featured the documentary filmmaker as protagonist, not just blindly 
documenting a person or event, but actively playing the part of what 
Errol Morris called the "detective-director," doing research and 
pushing themselves directly into the lives of the individuals being 
chronicled by the documentary. </P>
<P>In PARADISE LOST: THE CHILD MURDERS AT ROBIN HOOD HILLS, originally 
filmed on video for an HBO series, directors Joe Berlinger and Bruce 
Sinofsky follow the case of a triple homicide where three young 
children were attacked in West Memphis. When being pursued by the 
police (for relatively unstated reasons) a young man, Jesse, fingers 
Damien (a young man in the "goth" lifestyle who reads about Wicca and 
listens to Slayer) as well as Jason, a boy who frequently "hung out" 
with Damien, as being participants in the murders. Jesse's defense 
claims that the testimony was "forced on him" by the police, and that 
Jesse's low IQ prevented him from being able to provide rational 
answers to the types of interrogation methods used by the police, 
causing him to repeat the scenario the police presented to him, not 
the actual events that happened. Ultimately, in spite of a possible 
deal that would lessen the impact of a possible guilty verdict,
Jesse refuses to testify against Damien or Jason. Damien's defense 
indicates that there is no physical evidence linking Damien to the 
crime, and that he is being persecuted for his "style" -- the clothes 
he wears, the music he listens to, the books he reads. Jason's defense
argues that guilt by association is no reason to put away a 16-year 
old when there's no physical proof of any association with the crime. </P>
<P>While the bulk of the movie spends time in the court, the filmmakers 
also focus on the parents of the murdered boys. At first, it would
seem that it would be impossible not to feel sympathy for parents 
whose children had been murdered in such a brutal manner... but as 
the movie progresses, the attitudes and actions of the parents, one 
in particular, begin to grow more and more disturbing -- in such a 
way to suggest that, given the opportunity, they would be capable of 
just as brutal an action as the murders of their children in 
retribution to those who have been accused with little evidence as 
backup. A shot of the parents naming pumpkins after the accused and 
then blowing them up with semi-automatic weapons is particularly 
disturbing. </P>
<P>As they did in their 1992 documentary BROTHER'S KEEPER, Berlinger 
and Sinofsky focus on much more than just the trial, bringing in 
subtexts focusing on nature of stupidity (and the perception of it), 
the nature of religion in a small town, the importance of image, the 
legal issue of reasonable doubt, and much more. The film is not 100% 
objective: while the filmmakers portray almost everyone in the film 
as being equally vain or stupid (the exception being the 16 year- 
old Jason, who seems to be the most intelligent and calm individual 
participating in the proceedings), the filmmakers use haunting camera 
shots that play on many levels that subtly point the viewer to the 
filmmakers' agendas and ideas. This can hardly be considered a flaw,
however: a two and a half hour presentation of trials and events 
that spanned months of time can not be objective, and the way 
Berlinger and Sinofsky put the case together for the viewer, offering 
their opinion in a manner that is not blatant or manipulative, keeps 
the filmmakers from being so biased as to present an inaccurate view 
of the proceedings. To describe the kind of brilliant shots which 
visually provide the clues and subtext referred to above would
be to give away many of the important and shocking events in the 
film -- something that would damage the enjoyment of the film greatly 
for the viewer. There are a host of surprises, many unintentionally 
very funny, in PARADISE LOST, that could be ruined by a badly-placed 
spoiler. Despite the fact that PARADISE LOST is a documentary that 
runs over two hours, don't be under the impression that it will be 
boring or longwinded: like the similarly impressive documentary HOOP
DREAMS, the film is impossible to predict... creating lots of edge-of-
your-seat suspense along the way. </P>
<P>PARADISE LOST is ultimately a much more accomplished film than the 
earlier BROTHER'S KEEPER done by the same team. In PARADISE LOST we 
simply look at a situation through the eyes of the filmmaker, letting 
the words, actions, and camera-level view of others tell the story, 
where in BROTHER'S KEEPER, the filmmakers plied the subjects of the 
film with pointed and obtrusive questions. By being active 
participants in the proceedings, yet never straying or manipulating 
the facts in any way, PARADISE LOST becomes an incredibly 
fascinating, enjoyable and successful documentary -- and one that 
lends itself to portray a disturbing but accurate view of human 
nature lurking below the surface of both the film and our communities. </P>
