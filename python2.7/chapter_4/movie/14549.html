<P>   A spirited, Karl Marx-inspired ode to bauer-power, "The
Inheritors" answers the question, just what happens to land
once it's divided up among the poor peasants who farmed it? 
While the answer is as varied as the reformers who order the
partitions--different for Guatemalans under Arbenz and for
Cubans under Castro--the apportionment in writer-director
Stefan Ruzowitzsky's vision is at once hilarious, zestful, and
melodramatic.  "The Inheritors" succeeds wonderfully because
it takes a topic that could have been as dry as a graduate
lecture in political science, informing it with lustful humor, vivid
characterizations, and lovely shots of the Austrian
countryside.  Ruzowitzky filmed the movie with a
determination to avoid the "trash sentimentality" in works like
"The Sound of Music" and the "kitsch tales of a farmer's
endeavors to preserve the land so that he might feed his
family or with sentimental tales of royalty."</P>
<P>   The story opens on a large farm in Austria during the 1930s
owned by a meanspirited grower. His will is enforced by a
leathery overseer who uses brute force to keep the landless
peasants in line.  When the farmer is found murdered, the
town expects the land to be handed over to the church, the
usual procedure when such a man is childless.  Instead, the
farmer's scathing and rollicking will--which bequeaths to at
least one of the townspeople "a bucket of manure"--hands the
land over to the seven peasants who have had nothing at all
their lives.  Not that the farmer had grown soft. His intention,
clearly stated in the endowment, is to have the new owners
fight among themselves, even kill one another, in their greed
to own the entire plot.  What does occur, shocks not only the
local farmers (who fear uprisings among their own peasants
should the experiment succeed) and the church (which backs
the propertied class and considers it a sin for the landless to
become their own masters), but the newly enfranchised
themselves.  They take up their new responsibilities with vigor
and a renewed sense of cooperation, standing firm against
the old-line farmers determined to crush the Marxist-like
experiment.  Here is a classic case of class struggle, the
clergy and landed against the shirtless ones.  The film is aptly
entitled "Die Siebtelbauern," meaning the one-seventh
farmers.</P>
<P>   Two characters give the story its energy and audience
interest.  One is Lukas (Simon Schwarz), an orphan who, like
Oedipus, is shocked and moved when he unearths the secret
of his birth.  The other is Emmy (Sophie Rois), a hot-
tempered, liberated woman who submits happily to the
seductions of the handsome Lukas while emerging as the
fiery leader of the siebtelbauern.  She becomes noted for
such contemporary ideas as "make your own coffee" and the
notion that life holds more promise than what has been
offered to her gender by those in power. "You work for
someone, you get all men to hump you, and then you die,"
sounds a note about the nature of the feminine condition at
the time.  She fearlessly puts down her vociferous opponents
in the town with comments like "those who have big mouths
have small cocks."  Director Ruzowitzky takes us on a journey
of discovery that lifts her and her six comrades into a new
orb.  </P>
<P>   Like any radical change, the transformation is not without
perils.  Photographer Peter Von Haller captures the intensity
of the hazards--the fiery destruction of some of the group's
quarters, the liquidation of a cow, the chase after one of the
heroes who has a reward posted on his head.  Backed by an
appropriate strain of Erik Satie's music, "The Inheritors" is
swiftly-paced and unsentimental, a work of genuine integrity. 
The film received the award for best picture at this year's
Rotterdam Film Festival and played at the New York Film
Festival at Lincoln Center.</P>
