<PRE>The Review</PRE>
<P>    If Black & White, the new film from writer/director James Toback, is
eventually remembered for only one thing, it will be the revelation that
Brooke Shields, Claudia Schiffer, Marla Maples and Mike Tyson can act.
However, this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than
that. Black & White is a fascinating film; it makes a statement about
America's youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly
serious. Featuring a cast of known commodities (Ben Stiller, Robert
Downey Jr.) and hot newcomers (singers Bijou Phillips), Toback's is a
complex film worth seeing.</P>
<P>    Black & White has multiple storylines that are all related to each
other, a la Robert Altman. There is Dean the basketball player (Allan
Houston) who is asked to rig games for money by Mark Clear (Stiller) in
exchange for fifty grand a game. This eventually spills over into the
life of Dean's long-time friend Rich (Power), a gangsta who controls 20
city blocks of Harlem. Rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a
white-owned club on his turf. Meanwhile, the young white girls who like
to hang around with Rich and his homies get talked into being in a
documentary by Sam Donager (Shields) and her gay husband Terry (Downey
Jr.). Others who make appearances are William Lee Scott as the young
white punk Will, Joe Pantoliano as his District Attorney father, Jared
Leto as a high school teacher, Marla Maples as the mother of one of
hip-hop crazed teens, Claudia Schiffer as Dean's girlfriend, and Mike
Tyson as... Mike Tyson. The stories ebb and flow through the film,
losing and gaining prominence over time. Friendships are lost, lovers
are gained, and there is an occasional burst of violence.</P>
<P>    Originally rated NC-17 in the United States, Black & White features
a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls. While the
film was trimmed down to a tamer R rating, viewers will wonder what
could be more explicit than what they are seeing. The three-way sexual
beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for, and
several audience members got up and left at that point. The frequent sex
is one of the film's few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at
times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film.</P>
<P>    To Toback's credit, the level of violence in Black & White is almost
nil. These gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and
concerns, and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to
appear that way. Whenever a character finds himself on Donager's
handheld digital camera, he starts spouting off righteous tirades on
America and proclaims his independence, but not everyone has fully
bought into the idea. Charlie (Phillips) is full of bluster about why
she loves hip-hop, but admits that "in ten years time, I'll be way over
this." These youth know they are going through a phase, and are simply
enjoying it. Toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes
that are lightweight and funny. Most of the humour comes from Mike
Tyson, who provides the film's comic relief without really trying. He is
given big words like vernacular to say, and as Rich tries to discuss a
particular street problem with Tyson, he frequently has to ask him to
use smaller words and explain himself better, playing on Tyson's image
as a dimwit. But Tyson also gets the film's scariest moment. As he is
mercilessly hit upon by the very gay Terry, Tyson is a marvel to watch
as he fights to remain calm. The scene is entirely improvised, with
Downey Jr. being told to just keep at Tyson until he gets a reaction.
The reaction he gets, being slapped and then choked is astonishing, as
Downey Jr's face turns a frightening shade of purple.</P>
<P>    Black & White is a film about hip-hop culture, and the film's
omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this. But Toback keeps
things from becoming too serious; by moving from story to story as
quickly as he does, Toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one
character's struggle. Thus Black & White's message about hip-hop becomes
secondary to the film itself. Toback just wants us to have fun and maybe
learn a little about hip-hop along the way. And we do.</P>
