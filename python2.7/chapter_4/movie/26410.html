<PRE>The Watcher </PRE>
<P>When most critics describe a movie as being "by the books" or "follows all 
the rules" they usually mean it in a derogatory way. I was thinking of using 
one of those kinds of phrases to review "The Watcher." After all, it is a big 
budget Hollywood serial killer flick with marquee names, but that doesn't 
make it a bad movie. Sophomoric maybe, but definitely not bad. </P>
<P>Serial killer movies are a big box office draw but they're not exactly the 
easiest films to make, or make well at least. You need a hero you can really 
stand behind but one with some kind of personal weakness or character flaw so 
that they're not invincible. You also need a nasty killer who has a sick 
style in the way he operates. The better criminal he is, the more we want him 
caught. </P>
<P>A good screenplay and tight direction are also needed to bring it all 
together and make it work. You want a story that's complex but not so 
intricate that it's confusing, and you need good direction to keep the pace 
moving for consistent suspense. </P>
<P>"The Watcher" does a fair job in balancing these components, walking a fine 
line between making just another formula movie and making a GOOD formula 
movie. </P>
<P>Our hero and villain are played by James Spader and Keanu Reeves, 
respectively. The setting is Chicago and Spader's a pill-popping burned-out 
FBI agent with constant flashbacks to his days tracking a serial killer when 
he lived in Los Angeles. He visits a psychiatrist twice a week to help deal 
with his guilty conscience of his failure to catch the killer. He's the 
classic obsessed hero but he's also a hobbled one as we see the mess his life 
currently is. He can't seem to get his act together and is so strung out on 
medication it's like he's an escapee from the ICU. His introductory scenes 
are intercut with surreal flashbacks to that time he almost got the bad guy. 
It's a good way to keep the film energized but it's a little more than 
necessary. Spader's character is basically an exaggerated version of Fox 
Mulder from "The X-Files." </P>
<P>Reeves plays the killer, a man who has a penchant for stalking women without 
them knowing it and learning their every move and daily routine. He waits for 
them in their homes and strangles them with piano wire but not after spending 
some "quality time" with them. We never get a motive or even a clue as to 
what turned him into the sickie he is. He's a really charming, handsome man 
who appears to have some money and isn't a drug-addled vagrant or anything. 
If he's lonely he should just go to a bar because the women would be all over 
him. Many critics say Reeves and Spader should have switched roles, I agree, 
it would have been much more effective. 
So the film does a fairly good job in establishing an insecure, weak good guy 
vs. a cocky, vain bad guy. But can it string them through a good story? </P>
<P>For the most part yes, except for the fact that there is barely a story. It's 
mostly just thriller filler, but it works well. As you may have seen from the 
commercials and trailers Reeves tells Spader he'll send him a picture of his 
next victim and he can have 24 hours to find her. Whenever a serial killer 
gives the authorities an inkling of a clue, especially on purpose, it creates 
for great tension and "The Watcher" takes advantage of this situation. The 
second act of the film picks up the pace quickly and keeps the going and 
going. Kind of like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie but instead of explosions and 
chase scenes it's police work (hey wait a second, there ARE a few explosions 
and chase scenes!). </P>
<P>If you're a cop in a city with several million people and you know one of 
them is going to be killed how to you prevent it from happening? Even with 
the photograph of the victim and the help of the media and officers handing 
out flyers all over the city would it still be possible in this day and age 
for a person to be essentially invisible among thousands of other people? The 
answer we get here is a clear "yes" and that's what gives "The Watcher" so 
much energy and intrigue through most of its running time. The teamwork the Ch
icago Police and the FBI do to avert this crime is pretty amazing and the 
film doesn't take shortcuts around the detective work either. How DO you find 
a needle in a haystack? The killer knows you don't but the hero has to 
believe you can with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck. </P>
<P>I shouldn't even analyze or discuss the ending. I mean this is a formula 
serial killer flick, how else can it end? 
Is it suspenseful? Sort of. Is justice served? Yes, but it's not as 
satisfying as you'd think. Is it cheesy? On paper it would be, seeing it on 
the big screen it's not. </P>
<P>You can take "The Watcher" at face value and enjoy the ride or be more 
cynical and see it for what it really is. Either way you'll agree it's decent 
but neither terrible nor terrific. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B- </PRE>
