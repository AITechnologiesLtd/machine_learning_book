<P>Singles
Chad'z rating: *** (out of 4 = good)
1992, PG-13, 100 minutes [1 hour, 40 minutes]
[romantic comedy]
starring: Campbell Scott (Steve), Kyra Sedgwick (Linda), Bridget Fonda
(Janet), Matt Dillon (Cliff), produced by Cameron Crowe, Richard Hashimoto,
written and directed by Cameron Crowe.</P>
<P>The problem with dating is that it can be great for some people, but torture
for others. It's hard to meet someone that's both good looking and genuinely
interesting, and "Singles" is a good, funny film that plays up the anxiety of
this dilemma.</P>
<P>First there is Steve and Linda (Campbell, Sedgwick), who meet cute and are
attracted to each other, but must go through the typical flirting games. The
way this is shown is both typical and original: typical because scenes like
these happen all the time, but original in the way it is portrayed here with
the actual flirting games. You really believe these are two, actual people
because they don't have perfect chemistry, but we can tell there's potential.</P>
<P>There are other characters with problems like Steve and Linda's, but the
film does not become a gratuitous mess of whining and complaining, instead
it's a funny, romantic, character study. Janet (Fonda) is a waitress who
dates a struggling rock star named Cliff (Dillon). Their problem is
commitment: Cliff doesn't want to commit to one woman, although Janet has
essentially decided they are, in fact, a couple. She even goes as far to
visit a plastic surgeon to get breast implants to save the relationship, but
eventually realizes it's the little things that count. Cliff's not worth the
trouble... or is he?</P>
<P>Although we don't get to know the characters as well as we could, it's hard
not to care about them. Steve and Linda's relationship becomes quite rocky at
times, but we still hope they'll stay together because we can sympathize with
their conflicts. I'm sure this film will remind everyone of a relationship
they had - you're not sure where it is going, who is the one afraid of
commitment, or who is the problem. And thankfully, we don't get sappy
apologies and predictable make-up scenes. There are no piss-off scenes or
tear-jerkers, it treats a breakup in a more believable way than most movies
of the sort.</P>
<P>The only problem I had was the fact the film seemed to have an identity
crisis: Is it a commercial comedy, a serious romance, or an offbeat,
light-hearted drama? Nevertheless, it is still  interesting to watch because
of its originality and sweet charm.</P>
<P>You could say "Singles" concludes with a happy ending, and it seems
appropriate. Crowe has done what only a few mainstream filmmakers are able to
do; tap into the mind of Generation X and portray their true feelings and
emotions in a believable way. </P>
