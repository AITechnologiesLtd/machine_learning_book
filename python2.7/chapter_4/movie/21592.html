<PRE>The Straight Story
A film review by Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 by Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>At times we feel an overwhelming drive to put our lives in order. The
compulsion might follow a traumatic incident or it might be a change in
the seasons that triggers the need. Whatever the catalyst, we attempt to
right previous wrongs and clean our psychic house.</P>
<P>Many people delay until later -- sometimes <I>much<I> later. Often so
much later that we never get around to it. How many people lie on their
death beds with thoughts of "I should have..."?</P>
<P>Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is a lucky man. He's made it to 73
and still has an opportunity to make his pilgrimage. Based on a true
story, "The Straight Story" is touching and to the point.</P>
<P>Alvin's journey of spiritual reconciliation takes an unusual form. He
drives a John Deere lawn mower 350 miles across Iowa to his own personal
Mecca of Mt. Zion, Wisconsin. Alvin needs to visit his estranged ailing
brother to set things right and he can't put it off much longer. He has
to do it on his own, even without a driver's license, so he resorts to
the bizarre form of transportation.</P>
<P>The six-week trip through the Iowan cornfields and small towns in the
autumn is presented at a leisurely pace, well suited to the speed of the
mower towing a trailer three times its size. The camera pans slowly from
Alvin, across the fields, up into the sky and then back to the road
where he has progressed 20 feet. The luscious cinematography perfectly
illustrates the slowness of the trip.</P>
<P>As you might expect, Alvin encounters an assortment of characters during
his trek. A pregnant teenage hitchhiker, a Catholic priest, volunteer
firefighters: they all take to him like they would a long-lost
grandfather. And with good reason. Farnsworth is the guy everyone dreams
about having as an older relative. Homespun and stubborn, he has a
lifetime of experience in the real world.</P>
<P>A few scenes are real tearjerkers. Hanging out in a bar with a fellow WW
II vet, they exchange war horror stories. On a very personal level, they
reveal how combat changed them forever.</P>
<P>Asked the worst part of being old, Alvin replies "Remembering when you
were young." You know he means it and it captures an aspect of elderly
melancholy, but as he reminds his daughter, "I'm not dead yet."</P>
<P>We have come to expect the occasional effective feel-good down-home film
from Disney Studios. This is exactly one of those. Alvin is an old guy,
but he's full of life. Facing a struggle, he attacks it with the courage
of the young. The awe and wonderment of a child are still alive within him.</P>
<P>Here's the shocker: it's directed by David Lynch. Yes, David Lynch of
"Blue Velvet" and "Twin Peaks" fame. David Lynch who has delighted in
showing us the perverted underbelly of America now celebrates an
ordinary man. He does it to perfection.</P>
<P>There are a few Lynchian scenes that could have come from his previous
films. A woman hits a deer on the highway and rants about how she loves
deer but this is the 13th one within the past few weeks. Twin lawnmower
repair brothers work on Alvin's vehicle. One of them has a piece of
metal embedded in his cheek and no explaination is offered. Some of the
characters are just a nudge out of kilter.</P>
<P>Somehow they all fit. There are indeed odd people out in the cornfields,
but that doesn't make them any less real. They are more human because of
their weird touches, not less.</P>
<P>Although Farnsworth owns the lion's share of the screen in his best role
since "The Grey Fox", the supporting cast is equally impressive. Sissy
Spacek as his possibly-mentally challenged daughter is totally
believable in her understated role. Harry Dean Stanton as Alvin's
brother Lyle is as convincing as could be. Other bit parts are played by
actors that Lynch could have found out in those Great Plains.</P>
<P>Alvin was lucky. He put off getting right with himself until he was 73.
Some of us might not have so long.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has been writing this column for nearly two and a half
decades. He plans on being a crotchety old man, but maybe not in the
next couple of weeks. Email tales of cornfields to <A HREF="mailto:Redman@indepen.com.">Redman@indepen.com.</A>)</P>
