<PRE>                                  COPYCAT
                       A film review by Choo Eng Aun
                        Copyright 1995 Choo Eng Aun</PRE>
<PRE>(Wide Screen)</PRE>
<PRE>Starring : Sigourney Weaver, Holly Hunter, Dermount Mulroney, 
           Harry Connick Jr., John Rothman
Produced by : Amen Milchan & Mark Tarlow
Directed by : Jon Amiel
Running Time : 1hr 55mins
A Warner Bros.  Release</PRE>
<P>     With stars like Sigourney Weaver ("Alien" trilogy) and Academy
Award Winner Holly Hunter (THE PIANO, RAISING ARIZONA, etc.) together
in a single Hollywood production, one would immediately identify the
film as a potential Academy Award hot shot.  Sadly for COPYCAT, though
tightly scripted and nicely plot, is still at heart, a typical
Hollywood thriller.</P>
<P>     Helen (Weaver), after a traumatic near death encounter with a
serial killer, Darryl (Harry Connick Jr.), has developed a phobia for
being outdoors, so to speak.  Incidentally, Helen is also an expert on
the subject of serial killers, which make her a juicy target for serial
killer wannabes.  A year has passed and strange deaths begin to
terrorise the city of San Francisco.  Detective Monahan (Hunter) and
Getz (Mulroney), baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by
the killer, seeks the professional help of Helen, who, as expected was
reluctant at first.</P>
<P>     COPYCAT "borrows" a lot from SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and in most
cases, it did work.  But COPYCAT tries to be a little bit more by
immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give
them more believability, this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem
to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also ... much of the time
wasted could've been used to build up the suspense and injected with
drama.  Even so, Weaver and Hunter act very well in their own
departments ...  Weaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within
character (as in Aliens) and Hunter being the short, tough, Texan
speaking cop (as in Raising Arizona).  Harry Connick Jr., a very good
jazz singer, shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la Hannibal
Lecter.</P>
<P>     Which comes to the moment of judgement (drum roll please...).
COPYCAT is a good thriller.  Although the plot is highly predictable
and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45
minutes into the show, COPYCAT survives from the moments of
anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats, in
anticipation of the killers next immediate move.  This worked pretty
well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts.  Nice movie
to bring your girlfriend to....</P>
<PRE>Action         : **---
Suspense: ****-
Drama        : ***--</PRE>
<PRE>Overall Rating : 7.0 out of 10 (definitely watchable, not memorable stuff
                                though..)
