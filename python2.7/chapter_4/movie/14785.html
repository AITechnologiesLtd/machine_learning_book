<PRE>                    SMOKE SIGNALS (United States)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: An odyssey of two Indians in their early 20s going to
pick up the pickup truck of one's deceased father.  This is a film with
good characters that makes some profound points.  The dialog is very
good.  Rating: 9 (0 to 10), +3 (-4 to +4 scale)</P>
<P>   - Coeur d'Alene Indians of Idaho.
   - Victor Joseph is slightly stereotypical, a tall handsome Indian,
     but bitter about his alcoholic father not being around.
   - Thomas Builds-a-Fire is an original.  He is a sort of nerdy boy
     with braids and glasses.  Rather than playing basketball like his
     friend Victor he watches.  He tells stories, many of which are
     lies.  Victor looks down on him and derides him.  Yet where Victor
     is empty he is full.  His stories are what will sustain his
     people.  They are something that is lasting.
   - The conversations are worth hearing.  (But they are totally wrong
     about John Wayne's teeth.  The claim that you never see John
     Wayne's teeth in a film is totally misinformation.)
   - In 1976 Victor's father Arnold saved Thomas's life when a fire
     burned down his parents' house.
   - Victor's father was an alcoholic.  He left home a few years ago to
     live near Phoenix.  Took up with Suzy Song.
   - As with CHAMBERMAID ON THE TITANIC, a good lie from Thomas seems
     to do more to heal and to build people up than a harsh truth.
   - Local reservation traffic report is more a gossip column.  But
     there is no traffic anyway.
   - Lots of nice little surprises understated.  Many are humorous.
   - Only images of bad Indians on TV.
   - Suzy Song is everything Victor is not.  She embraces life and is
     not bitter.
   - Tom Skerritt has a small role as a threatening policeman.
   - Based on LONE RANGER AND TONTO HAVE A FISTFIGHT IN HEAVEN, a short
     story collection.  This was one of the stories.
   - Really about all fathers and sons.</P>
