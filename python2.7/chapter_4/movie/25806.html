<P>   On the Sunday night TV show "Married...With Children"
well over a decade ago, Sally Struthers played a high school
girl who was to perform in the role of a tap dancer.  Instead
of effecting the choreography expected of her, she turned the
presentation into a sultry gambol that raised the testosterone
level of the parents in the audience noticeably.  Since the
Struthers character embodied the definition of hip, the
implication was that tap was cornball, a square form of
entertainment that died a natural death eons ago.  This is
why a potential audience might look with a wary eye on ads
for a new movie by the Twentieth Century Fox arthouse
division, Fox Searchlight, called "Bootmen."  </P>
<P>   Not to worry.  Dein Perry, whose staged work "Tap Dogs"
has made the rounds of several continents, has as much in
common with a Fred Astaire-style monkey-suit routine as the
minuet has with a rave.  The prior film that best conveys the
ambience of this new work is Baz Luhrmann's 1992 movie,
"Strictly Ballroom," also  removed from the conventional
ballroom dancing you might think that it's about. "Strictly
Ballroom" featured the dynamic Paul Mercurio who outrages
his mother by making up his own provocative steps and then
by taking on a partner who is anything by comely but who
glows and blooms under his mentoring.</P>
<P>   Like Luhrmann's film, Dein Perry's debut feature as a film
director is not always credible, particularly in its presumption
that thousands of people form a working-class city would turn
out for a performance of tap and its premise that several
relatively untutored hoofers could learn some intriguing,
original steps in a matter of weeks.  Despite that minor
blemish, "Bootmen"--which is also the name of the rough-
hewn company that turns a makeshift auditorium into the
likes of an exciting rock concert--is as poignant as it is
frequently exhilarating.  Not the least of the reasons for its
success as an original piece is the central performance of the
charismatic Adam Garcia, whom we have recently seen as
Kevin O'Donnell in "Coyote Ugly" and three years ago as
Jones in "Wilde."  Garcia, by the way, must be about the
most attractive 27-year-old male in Australia.</P>
<P>   Garcia, born in in the New South Wales town of
Wahroonga, takes on the role of a cocky young man, Sean
Okden, who often irritates his father as much as he irks his
employers.  Working in a one-factory steel town about a
couple of hours' ride from Sydney, he makes clear that
welding steal is not about to become his life--nor ironically
would it long embrace the lives of the rest of the workers in
that rapidly declining industry.  </P>
<P>   Determined to make a living in the exceptionally insecure
field of tap dancing, he takes a leave from his job to pick up
a 3-months' contract with an upper-crust tap troupe in
Sydney--but not before meeting and romancing the lovely
local beautician Linda (Sophie Lee) who is also the object of
affection of Sean's loutish brother Mitchell (Sam
Worthington).  While Mitchell's sideline of stealing cars gets
him into deep trouble with a local gang engaged in the same
business, Sean's arrogance makes him persona non grata
with the conventional people who hire him.  Deciding
ultimately to make a calling of tap without leaving his own
working-class environs, he choreographs some startling new,
brash dances featuring fellow steel workers who perform in
work clothes and heavily steeled shoes and who, together
with a rock band willing to work for free prepare to stage a
concert for the people of their own social class.</P>
<P>    If you'd taken in Nicholas Hytner's recent movie "Center
Stage," centering on Jody Sawyer's role as a dancer equally
at home with salsa, jazz, ballet and aerobics, you'll get an
idea of the tone of Perry's story.  To the credit of "Bootmen,"
this is not a picture that is all music and dance at the
expense of gripping narrative as was the energetic and also
recommended high-school-targeted "Bring It On," but scores
high for depth of characterization and for poignancy in
bringing home the heartbreaking milieu of a working-class
town too dependent on a single industry for its livelihood.</P>
