Head Over Heels (2001) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring Freddie Prinze Jr.,
Monica Potter,  Sarah O'Hare, Shalom Harlow, Ivana Milicevic, Tomiko
Fraser, China Chow and Jay Brazeau. Story by John J. Strauss & Ed Decter
& David Kidd & Ron Burch. Screenplay by Ron Burch & David Kidd. Directed
by Mark Waters.</P>
<P>  It is only the charm of Freddie Prinze Jr. that keeps Head Over Heels
from being a total disaster.</P>
<P> As it is this so-called comedy is ó even at just about 90 minutes ó
long, lame and lamentable.</P>
<P> Yet Prinzeís winning personality, his shy smile, his light approach,
raises Head Over Heels from abominable to merely mediocre.</P>
<P> Head Over Heels is so pathetic it raises The Wedding Planner to the
level of an American Beauty.</P>
<P> It's difficult to believe that four writers worked on this story,
luckily only two of them get screen credit, but all their names and
faces should be posted in Americaís post offices under the crime of
impersonating a screenwriter. The screenplay, a kindly description for
what supposedly passes as one, is credited to Ron Burch and David Kidd.
The story is credited to Bruch, Kidd, John J. Strauss and Ed Decter.</P>
<P> Oh yes, ìthe story.î Letís see, single woman in New York canít find Mr.
Right. Gee, how original. How many times have we walked this path? Too
many to count or even bother.</P>
<P> Suffice it to say that Monica Potter plays Amanda Pierce, an art
restorer, who likes art better than real life. It seems the men she
always picks eventually hurt her.</P>
<P> The latest one is in bed with a model one day when she comes home early
from work.</P>
<P> Amanda, seeking new digs, moves in with four models, all portrayed as
self-centered, shallow airheads, only interested in the gifts they can
wheedle from panting men.</P>
<P> Then Amanda meets Jim (Prinze) and sparks fly. And how do we know that
heís the one? Simple, earlier one of the models told Amanda that when
she meets the right man her knees would buckle. So guess what happens
when she meets Jim?</P>
<P> From there everything goes downhill, with Jim suspected of being a
killer, and then the story taking a sharp left turn involving Russian
mobsters and diamond smuggling.</P>
<P> The movie goes off in as many directions as a politician trying to
please all his constituents.</P>
<P> Even the music is terrible, sounding like rejected tracks from episodes
of The Brady Bunch.</P>
<P> Head Over Heels is a stinker, a dud. Itís a corny B-programmer; its
sole purpose to fill empty screens until something better comes along.</P>
<P> This is a movie that is totally forgettable. As a matter of fact, Iíve
forgotten about it already.</P>
