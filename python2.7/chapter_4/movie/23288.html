Sansom, John Fiedler, Peter Cullen. Directed by Jun Falkenstein. Rated
G.</P>
<P>You would expect the first theatrical feature based on the popular A.
A. Milne Winnie the Pooh tales to be something memorable, children's
entertainment for the ages. You'd think so, wouldn't you? Well, Disney
never ceases to surprise us. This release seems purely perfunctory,
made for a quick buck with no heart or much effort poured into it. It
doesn't even star everybody's favorite bear (assuming you don't like
Yogi). The Tigger Movie is pretty run-of-the-mill stuff; the youngest
set of kids might enjoy it, but I doubt they'll want to watch it again
or even remember it after a couple of days. Call me a Disney purist,
but when it comes to their animation department, I expect the best and
am rather irritated when I don't get it.</P>
<P>Pooh has crushingly little screen time because, as one might glean from
the title, the focus of the film is Tigger, that lovable, striped
companion. Unable to find anyone to "bounce" with him one afternoon,
Tigger realizes that he might have a family somewhere and goes off
searching for it. He looks for a family tree -- literally a tree,
because he doesn't know any better. He's inevitably disappointed
because even with the help of his moderately bouncy young kangaroo
companion Roo, the search comes up empty.</P>
<P>Seeing their pal's disappointment, Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit and Iore plot
to write a phony letter from his family and then have a phony family
(them dressed in Tigger costumes) show up at Tigger's door. The final
message, of course, is that friends are your family too and, as might
be expected from a movie whose target audience's age is in the single
digits, it is delivered with little subtlety. I'm perfectly fine with
this as long as there is a certain grace and joie de vivre to the film.
That's where this Tigger comes up short.</P>
<P>The animation is old-school and that's the way it's supposed to be. It
has that very Pooh-ish storybook quality that fits the franchise like a
glove; it's Disney's one cash cow that has refused to be taken over by
high-tech gimmickery. What doesn't work is, well, everything else.
Tigger's a pretty good character, but his babbling, word-butchering
schtick gets old pretty fast. That's usually where the supporting
players come to the rescue but The Tigger Movie doesn't let them be
themselves. Winnie himself shows up only a couple of times so that he
can do his trademark climbing-a-tree-after-honey-only-to-be-attacked-by-
a-swarm-of-bees. Iore's presence, too, is merely for the sake of him
being there. Piglet barely even opens his mouth. The Disney movie mill
has stripped these beloved, age-old characters of almost all
personality for the sake of commercialization and also to fit everyone
into an 80-minute movie while focusing primarily on Tigger. The Winnie
the Pooh series was so enduring because the characters worked together
to solve a problem; this really is Tigger's movie.</P>
<P>I, of course, am not the target audience for this film so I am hard-
pressed to say whether you should take your children to see this movie
or not. The youngest set will almost certainly enjoy it. But when it
comes to continuing the Pooh saga with grace and dignity, The Tigger
Movie doesn't get the job done. It's passable, but I apparently wanted
more than Disney could provide with a film that isn't their
annual "animated feature."</P>
