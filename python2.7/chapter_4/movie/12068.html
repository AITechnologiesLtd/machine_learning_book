<PRE>Toys (1992) 118m. </PRE>
<P>I doubt many people were prepared for this whimsical project from
Barry Levinson, especially considering the solid base of reality that
his previous works had been grounded in.  Apart from occasionally
flirting with the fantastic (allegory in THE NATURAL, hallucinations
in YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES) Levinson had not been pegged as a fantasy
director by the Hollywood establishment, so it's interesting to
discover that TOYS was intended as his directorial debut (he made
DINER instead).  It's just as well he postponed it for ten years -
given its ambitious nature and lavish production I don't see how he
could have made it back then.</P>
<P>Film is set in a toy factory (which looks like a kind of kiddie
METROPOLIS) inherited by a cashiered General (Michael Gambon) who is
less than happy about losing his career in the army for a future in a
toyshop, especially one run by his frivolous nephew (Robin Williams,
in another of his kid-who-never-grew-up roles).  The world of TOYS is
too innocent by half, which is why it comes as no surprise to us when
the General decides to exploit the factory's production concepts for
his own ends.  Story is inventive and otherwordly, but even after ten
years of thought it doesn't appear that Levinson has gotten it quite
right - I think the ending, while logical in light of where the film
is heading, is unsatisfying, for one thing.  But as TOYS is set in a
world where nothing is what it appears, any intangibility on
Levinson's part can only seem fitting.  It's as if he remembered a
dream and tried to visualize it for others to see.  I also like the
tone that he maintains throughout much of its length - it would have
been too obvious to go the way of black comedy.  TOYS definitely isn't
dark: its bright primary colors are mixed with pastels; everything we
see is supergeometric, shiny, and spotless.  Even the newly-enthused
General gets into his role as factory owner by switching the design of
his camouflage outfit over to cheerful colors.</P>
<P>The main reason to see TOYS is its look.  Its crystal-clear
photography and innovative sets deserve to be seen in a cinema -that
much was apparent to me when viewing it a second time on television
and seeing how lacking in atmosphere the opening sequence looked in
comparison.  Surreal visual sense (inspired by Magritte), magical
setting (the only scenes outdoors take place in a ubiquitous green
field), and naive, offbeat plot make for a perfect bedtime story. 
Simple message - 'War is bad' - will not be lost on children.  That we
think the meetings of the toy executives trivial and absurd is ironic
considering we think nothing of the more familiar (but equally absurd)
domain of the strategic military conferences in the film.  Williams
combines both levels of play (toys and soldiers) in his climatic
address to the factory toys, throwing in every jingoistic cliche in
the books, combining Gandhi, Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Henry V,
Lord Kitchener.  Rapper LL Cool J acquits himself well as the
General's son.  Joan Cusak gives a standout performance as Williams'
quirky sister, who sums up attitude of film in her line "the best part
is no-one got hurt".</P>
<P>TOYS is like a big toy itself, a grab-bag of novelties and visual gags
- there's a great bit where the General, under X-ray surveillance, is
spouting about war as if he is Death personified.  Sci-fi fans will
pick up the line poached from THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL as the
last war toy fires its final shot (I don't know how many people share
this view, but contrary to film's message, I find the military toys
more interesting than the boring clockwork toys that seem to be the
factory's main product line).  Film's memorable trailer featured
Williams improvising in an open field, setting audiences up for an
out-and-out comedy that they didn't get.  This goes some way to
explaining its lukewarm reaction at the box office.</P>
