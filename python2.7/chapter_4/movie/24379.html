<P>Review by Lars Lindahl (<A HREF="mailto:larsattacks@mail.com">larsattacks@mail.com</A>)</P>
<P>"Army of Darkness" (1993) **1/2 (out of four)</P>
<PRE>Directed by Sam Raimi
Written by Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi</PRE>
<P>Starring Bruce Campbell, Embeth Davidtz, Ian
Abercrombie, Marcus Gilbert, Richard Grove, and
Bridget Fonda. </P>
<P>Army of Darkness, the third film in the Evil Dead
trilogy, is as close as you'll get to seeing a comic
book transformed into a movie. Full of cheesy one
liners you'd normally hear Superman declare, the
script is extremely terse and unspecific compared to
others of the same genre (The story Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles 2: The Secret of the Ooze presented
feels like James Joyce's Ulysses compared to this
one). The acting is horrendously bad, even for an Evil
Dead film. Bruce Campbell, as the "everyday joe"
turned macho superhero, looks like he's reading off
cue cards while "damsel-in-distress" Embeth Davidtz is
given a few lines and still seems to screw it up. </P>
<P>So why didn't this movie get zero stars? Because
director Sam Raimi is making a bad movie on purpose!
He wants his audience to recognize how stupid the
script is and how bad the acting is, then he wants his
audience to laugh their brains off. To some extent,
Raimi succeeds. I laughed hard at some scenes; they
were just so asinine, you really can't help but laugh.</P>
<P>However, having seen Evil Dead II just a few days
before, the third installment wasn't nearly as
impressive as its immediate predecessor. I'll invent a
term to better explain my dissatisfaction with Army of
Darkness: Austin Powers Syndrome, or APS. Movies with
APS at first seem very funny. Though, as the film
progresses, an uncontrollable feeling of familiarity
begins to emerge in the back of your brain. It takes a
few minutes, but once you realize it, your enjoyment
for the movie is no longer there. The jokes are
exactly the same as the last film in the series, only
slightly modified. Not modified enough to hide the
fact that nearly everything in the movie you're
watching has been recycled by another movie you
cherished. It's a terrible feeling. I got this feeling
watching Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and I
recently during Army of Darkness. </P>
<P>Raimi attempted a very difficult task and ultimately
failed: He tried to satire the same subject using the
same characters and the same story twice. The slight
modification is, instead of alone in a cabin in the
middle of the woods, our hero Ash (Campbell) is
fighting evil ghosts and monsters during 1300 A.D.
with a large army of soldiers. As continued from the
point where Evil Dead II left off (although some
scenes from the end of Evil Dead II are oddly left out
of the beginning of Army of Darkness), Ash is sucked
into the past along with all of the evils that
terrorized him in the present. Conveniently, he finds
himself in the middle of King Arthur's castle (the
only hip place to be during 1300 A.D. according to the
movies). Arthur promises to send Ash back to the
present as long as he recovers the infamous book of
the dead from the woods, an environment inhabited by
dangerous spirits. </P>
<P>The sense of familiarity begins to come out when Ash
finds himself in a cabin preparing to find the book.
He is first humorously attacked by miniature Ash's,
then by another, larger monster that could pass as his
evil twin. As all of these events, no matter how wacky
or unique they sound, are almost exactly staged and
presented like in Evil Dead II when Ash was being
attacked by his own right hand. I would have enjoyed
Army of Darkness a lot more if I had not seen Evil
Dead II. </P>
<P>It is fitting that Army of Darkness is not titled Evil
Dead III, because, overall, it is very different from
its two prequels. The budget is more than the first
two films combined, the number of actors is more than
the first two films combined, and the movie lacks the
horror element that the others shared and cleverly
ridiculed. As a guilty pleasure, Army of Darkness is
great to watch with a group of friends. Everyone
involved in the film knew they were making a bad movie
and they had a lot of fun doing it. As it turns out,
they made one of the best B-movies of the 1990's. But
the ASP sticks onto the movie very early on and not
once does it show signs of letting go.  </P>
