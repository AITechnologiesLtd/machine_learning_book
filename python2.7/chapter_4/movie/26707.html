"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Call it The Full Monty 2.  You can even call it Rocky VI - I don't
really care.  Billy Elliot is the `Feel Good Movie of the Year' in a
time when four of the last five Best Picture winners featured main
characters that died in the final reel.  It's just not cool to be the
FGMOTY anymore, and the films that try to shoot for FGMOTY status
usually fail miserably by cramming schmaltz down your throat (i.e., Pay
It Forward).</P>
<P>While Elliot's story isn't particularly groundbreaking, the film manages
to avoid the gimmicky devices and relentless button-pushing that usually
derail FGMOTY wannabes.  Instead, it relies on terrific acting
performances, highlighted by 13-year-old newcomer Jamie Bell, who plays
the titular Elliot.  I haven't found myself rooting for a character this
fiercely in a long, long time, and if this film doesn't put a smile on
your face and a lump in your throat, there's something very wrong with
you.</P>
<P>Elliot is set in a small town in northeast England during a coal miners'
strike in 1984.  The film opens with 11-year-old Billy jumping up and
down on his bed to his brother's record collection (the soundtrack is
loaded with T-Rex tunes).  Billy shares his bedroom with older brother
Tony (Jamie Draven), who, like their father (Gary Lewis, East is East),
spends his time on the picket line throwing produce at the scabs who
have taken their jobs.  Billy breaks up his day between keeping an eye
on his senile grandmother (Jean Heywood) and plunking away at the piano
that his dead mother used to play.</P>
<P>Although money is tight, Billy's father gives him a stipend for weekly
boxing lessons.  He's awful at it, and one night after practice, Billy
sticks around and watches a group of young girls learn ballet.
Infatuated by the dancing, Billy joins in and finds that he's quite good
at it, despite worrying that he'll become `a right sissy.'  The teacher,
Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters, Titanic Town), is a crass, chain-smoking
teacher who could be a cousin to Brenda Blethyn's character in Little
Voice, but she recognizes Billy's talent and suddenly finds herself with
a new interest in her work.</P>
<P>The rest of the film follows a fairly predictable trajectory, with Billy
struggling to perfect his craft for an audition at the Royal Ballet
School in London.  Mrs. Wilkinson becomes somewhat of a mother figure to
him, and his father and brother hit the roof when they find out that
their own blood is dabbling in poofy dancing (these are the kind of
blue-collar Englishmen that think Mikhail Barishnikov is a striker for
Dynamo Kiev).</P>
<P>The film does have a couple of minor hitches, like the inclusion of a
subplot featuring Billy's cross-dressing best friend (Stuart Wells, in
his film debut) and the failure to beef up the sweet but neglected
subplot involving Billy and Mrs. Wilkinson's daughter, Debbie (Nicola
Blackwell –a dead ringer for Patricia Clarkson).  But the picture is
held together by a truly inspirational performance from young Bell, who
does an extremely good job of towing the delicate line between childhood
and adulthood.</P>
<P>Elliot is the feature film directorial debut of Stephen Daldry, whose
short film Eight was nominated for a British Academy Award in 1998.  The
script was written by Lee Hall, who is also making his feature film
debut with this film festival favorite that has fared well in the early
rounds of year-end accolades.  Comparisons to the out-of-left-field hit
The Full Monty are going to be inevitable, as each film features
working-class stiffs who become unlikely local heroes.  And I wouldn't
be surprised to see Elliot land a Monty-esque load of Oscar nominations,
either.</P>
