written and directed by John Sayles</PRE>
<P>Not many notice it, but American cinema wouldn't be the same without
someone like John Sayles.  While many low-budget filmmakers do their
dirty work and move on to bigger things, Sayles sticks with his roots
and keeps on making films that are personal, important, very
independent, and most of all, extremely good.</P>
<P>John Sayles got his directing start in 1980 with "Return Of The
Secaucus 7", an ensemble piece that supposedly inspired "The Big
Chill". He then moved onward, past "City Of Hope" and "Eight Men Out",
to his classic, 1996's "Lone Star"; a tale of a soft-spoken sheriff
uncovering a dark past. Sayles followed that up with last year's
underrated Spanish-language drama "Men With Guns". The man's latest
work is "Limbo", a remarkable, if uneven, independent film that is too
unique to fit into any specific genre.</P>
<P>Like all John Sayles films, "Limbo" takes a while to get going, as we
meet the two protagonists living in Alaska; America's final
frontier. Donna De Angelo (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) is a folksy
singer (a la Mare Winningham in "Georgia") whom we first see at a
wedding ceremony in which she is performing for the last time with her
ex-boyfriend (one of many, we are told). Donna's cynical,
self-mutilating daughter Noelle (Vanessa Martinez) is working as a
waitress for the caterer. Donna begs for a ride home with her
daughter's employer, a quiet, secretive man named Joe Gastineau (David
Strathairn).</P>
<P>Inevitably, a relationship begins, but just when you think things
couldn't get any simpler, a few complications arise. As it turns out,
Joe never used to be such a quiet man; that is until he let two of his
friends drown in a fishing accident a few years back. However, Joe has
started to fish again, just as his estranged half-brother, Bobby (Casey
Siemaszko), returns to Alaska. Bobby asks Joe to accompany him on a
"fishing trip", for reasons that he cannot disclose.  Mistakenly, he
asks Donna and Noelle to join them, their best laid plans go very
awry, and they end up in "limbo", called so because "It sure ain't
heaven and it's too cold to be hell."</P>
<P>David Strathairn, a character actor who made his debut in Sayles'
"Return Of The Secaucus 7" comes into his own here as the typical John
Sayles' antihero (a soft-spoken, simple-looking maze of a
man). Mastrantonio (who does all her own singing) is more showy, and
just as good. The action hits a little to quickly in "Limbo", and
there are bits of throwaway dialogue, but it is another great
achievement for Sayles.</P>
<P>It is the ending of "Limbo", however, that will cause the most
backlash. In a very daring move, John Sayles has given "Limbo" an open
ending. Those who read my "eXistenZ" review will know that I enjoy
open endings more than the average person, and in "Limbo", it works
wonders. The ending provoked a collective groan from the none-too-kind
audience, but I thought it to be a move of pure genius. By cutting out
one second of film, Sayles shows the audience the difference between a
Hollywood happy ending and a realistic, inevitable truth.</P>
<P>John Sayles, the most gifted of filmmakers, grips us to the story and
then makes us the characters.  Realism has never been more
thought-provoking. The groan of the audience just goes to show how
involved we are by the end of the film. A landmark moment for John
Sayles, the messenger of independent film.</P>
