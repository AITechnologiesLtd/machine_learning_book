<P>   In his British web site "Inside Out Film," the critic who calls
himself The Wolf says of "Winter Sleepers" that "the
characters become servants of the plot and the plot contorts
itself into implausible shapes to accommodate them."  He
means this as a negative appraisal of the film but in doing so
he misses the point.  The most assured aspect of the story is
that Tom Tykwer and Francoise Pyszora--in adapting Anne-
Francoise Pyszora's novel "Expense of Spirit" to the screen--
mean quite deliberately to point out that what we do may
have little bearing on what happens to us.  Fate, not
individual will, dictates much of our lives, and the
oddest, most improbable coincidences have a way of getting
in the way of our intentions.  Or, as Robert Burns put stated
lyrically, "The best laid schemes of mice and men aft gang a-
gley."</P>
<P>   The setting could scarcely be better for working out the
strands of fate.  Imprison your characters in a closed area, a
cocoon if you will, so that there is a multiplicity of possibilities
that could either enhance or endanger their lives.  Tykwer
locates his people in a the German ski village of
Berchtesgaden (Hitler's favorite vacation spot, by the way), in
the dead of winter. The snow, wonderful to look at and, if
you're a sportsman, to ski in, can be disastrous as well
under particular circumstances.  Cinematographer Frank
Greibe has his work cut out as he photographs the
bleak and beautiful landscape of the village and also hones in
on the games people play inside their lodgings.  </P>
<P>   When movie projectionist Rene (Ulrich Matthes)
inadvertently finds himself outside a ski lodged owner by
Laura (Marie-Lou Sellem) which she shares with her best
friend Rebecca (Floriane Daniel), he discovers Rebecca in
flagrante with her boy friend du jour, the handsome, impulsive
and often childish Marco (Heino Ferch).  Capturing this
titillating scene in his camera, he steals Marco's car on a
whim, involving him in a terrible accident with a local farmer,
Theo (Josepf Bierbichler).  Unfortunately Theo's daughter has
stowed away in her dad's trailer and becomes comatose: yet
Rene walks away from the accident casually as though
overturned vehicles were to him a common and ordinary sight
on the German mountainside. </P>
<P>   The injured Theo, who has spotted a snake-like scar on
Rene's neck, becomes obsessed with finding this hit-and-run
perpetrator, while Rene, spookily unconcerned with Theo's
fixation, goes about his life casually, becoming romantically
involved with the woman who coincidentally is the nurse of
Theo's stricken child.  More happenstance is to occur that will
intertwine strangers' lives in a deepening tragedy.</P>
<P>   Tom Tykwer's direction this time around is not as creative
as it was in his best-known and most sensational work, "Run,
Lola, Run," the most visually exciting foreign language movie
released last year in the States.  In that movie, which bore
the German title "Lola, Rennt," Tykwer's title character
receives a phone call from her boy friend, Manni, breathlessly
entreating her to come up with 100,000 deutschmarks within
twenty minutes or he will be killed by gangsters.  Tykwer runs
through three separate scenarios as though he were writing
and re-writing the screenplay.  In each case, a different
outcome prevails.  But again, fate is to govern the results.  
Since Tykwer is adapting another person's novel this time
around instead of controlling all aspects of the film, the
results are not as astonishing as before.  Instead, we are
treated to a  casually paced story line amid the snowy
mountain landscape that evokes the bleakness of Atom
Egoyan's "The Sweet Hereafter," also about a tragedy
affecting children amid an icy, elevated panorama.</P>
<P>   But like "Lola Rennt," "Winterschlafer" (its German title) is
stylized--with each principal character wearing a distinct color. 
The sensual blonde Rebecca fixates on her bloody finger in
the opening scene and wears red throughout.  The drab
movie projectionist, Rene, wears gray, while farmer Theo
wears earth colors to handsome Marco's blue.  "Winter
Sleepers" is a disappointment only to those who expect
Tykwer to duplicate his masterfully entertaining, fleet-of-foot
"Run Lola Run," but given the man's technique, his
photographer's facility with a camera (a stunt man is
photographed for thirteen takes executing a drop that would
terrify the divers at Acapulco's Le Quebrada), and his 20-
something characters' self-centered behavior within a
closeted scenario, this study in coincidence is nothing short
of compelling.</P>
