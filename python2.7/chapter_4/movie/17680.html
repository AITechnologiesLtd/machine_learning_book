<PRE>10 Things I Hate About You
At theatres everywhere
by Vince Yim</PRE>
<P>(originally written for the Ubyssey, the student newspaper for the
University of British Columbia.  Unfortunately, it got cut for space)</P>
<P>   Keeping in the spirit of the film's title, here are ten things to
either like or dislike about the film.</P>
<P>10: Likely inspired by the success of William Shakespeare's Romeo +
Juliet, 10 Things I Hate About You is a modernized retelling of
Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. While the original was about a much
loved Bianca who cannot marry until her older sister Kate is wed, the
retelling takes place in high school, where the most popular girl in
school (by Larisa Oleynik) can't date until her older, unpopular sister
does (by Julia Stiles). Not necessarily a bad thing in itself, but do
filmmakers really believe that all teenagers suffer from attention
deficit disorder and will only be interested in a more candy-coated
Shakespeare?</P>
<P>9: Note the key word "high school." This is a warning bell for any
moviegoer over the age of 21, especially with the teenage films with
very limited appeal for anyone not in the demographic. Fair enough. The
Generation X crowd had The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and
16 Candles, but we look back at these films with fond memories. Will the
current rash of teenage films like The Mod Squad (which I hated), Cruel
Intentions, and 10 Things be remembered in by current teens when they
become adults?</P>
<P>8: Still, 10 Things has a lot of charm and humour that may just make it
memorable. Despite the crude level of humour in much of the film (ie:
penis jokes, sheep jokes, and kicks to the groin), the film comes off
surprisingly well, something not expected of a film aimed at teens. The
adult characters are the more memorable ones, including standouts as the
perpetually horny guidance counselor, Kat and Bianca's overprotective
father, and Kat's English teacher.</P>
<P>7: But as befits a teenage film, 10 Things is riddled with some bad
clichés and stereotypes. For example, Bianca is the most popular girl in
the school, she's about as dumb as a piece of toast (this stopped being
funny a long time ago). While Kat is the most unpopular girl in school,
yet one look and you'd wonder why. The most popular guy has a really
fancy car and is a real jerk. And so forth.</P>
<P>6: Also a modern epidemic in the film biz is the 90-minute music video
being passed off as a film. Much of the time it feels like the
filmmakers are trying to sell copies of the soundtrack instead of
entertaining the audience. Please refer to the comment on teenagers with
ADD.</P>
<P>5: The performances are actually pretty good, although not much of a
stretch, considering that the actors and actresses actually are
teenagers (although in real life, Larisa Oleynik and Julia Stiles are
the same age). However, it does break the convention of teenagers being
played by actors and actresses in their late 20s.</P>
<P>4: While many moments in the film are rather charming, it eventually
gets to the point of inducing hyperglycemia. While the "aww, shucks"
kinda moments are well executed, the film's conclusion (which is
predictable, even if you haven't read Taming of the Shrew) cannot go by
fast enough. Some audience members may benefit from bringing along a
toothbrush.</P>
<P>3: Most importantly, many of the more misogynist elements from Taming of
the Shrew were removed when adapted. Despite the earlier complaint about
a candy-coated Shakespeare, 10 Things definitely have more resonance
with a more contemporary audience. </P>
<P>2: Unless you want to be reminded of your age and how long it has
actually been since you've attended high school, this film is not for
you. For anyone who has been out of high school for more than two years,
this film is guaranteed to make you feel extremely old.</P>
<P>1: Regardless, 10 Things is a worthy adaptation of a classic, which
despite its limited appeal, actually manages to entertain.</P>
<P>Rating: 6.5/10 (8/10, if I was much younger)</P>
