<PRE>Grosse Pointe Blank
A movie review by Monika Huebner
Copyright 1997 Monika Huebner</PRE>
<P>Director: George Armitage
Cast: John Cusack, Minnie Driver, Dan Ackroyd and others</P>
<P>The nice but somewhat strange Martin Blank (John Cusack) has  an
uncommon profession. His nice clean office with secretary soon turns
out to be a flourishing killer agency. But although the hitman
business is going well Martin has problems. They are of a more
personal nature and he regularly stretches out on a therapist's couch
to solve them. The therapy comes to an abrupt end when he finds out
that all his therapist's book that he admired so much where written by
a ghost writer. Nevertheless he lets this psychoterrorist who has
severe problems himself talk him into attending his high school
reunion at Grosse Pointe, Michigan. By doing this he combines business
and pleasure for his next contract is taking him there anyway.
Moreover a visit to his hometown gives him the opportunity to meet his
high school sweetheart Debi (Minnie Driver) whom he left without
saying good-bye ten years ago. Unfortunately things don't go according
to plan because there's a hitman going after Martin as well. The
sleepy little town is in for one hell of a ride.</P>
<P>John Cusack who wasn't able to show his talent in this year's
blockbuster 'Con Air' can do so now. He is very convincing as the
troubled killer who justifies his deeds by pointing out that he never
kills innocent people. His methods are just as extravagant as his
personality. It doesn't always have to be a gun, does it? The
president of Paraguay e. g. was killed with a fork. You have to be
creative in a job that doesn't require a college degree, much less a
Ph. D. </P>
<P>Tom Jankewicz seasoned the script with a healthy dose of black humor
to prevent it from being just another big gunfight and thus defuses
the more brutal scenes. He doesn't quite reach the skillfullness of
the Coen brothers but the dialogues and the funny situations stop the
viewers from thinking about the fact that many people are killed in
this movie. E. g. in the scene when Martin has to kill one of the
hitmen that try to kill him in a corridor of his old high school
during the reunion dance. With the help of a friend he wraps the body
in a piece of decoration and burns it in the school's furnace. The
attentive viewer asks him- or herself where the big bloodstain in the
corridor has gone and why there are no other bloody marks. The Coens
wouldn't have let this happen.</P>
<P>On the down side are - once again - the female parts. They remain
one-dimensional as usual. Here they are secretaries (Joan Cusack) or
ex-sweethearts (Minnie Driver). Especially Debi's part could have been
better. Debi who is a DJ with her own call-in radio show doesn't
hesitate to embarass her former lover in public asking her audience
whether she should give him a second chance after ten years. Martin
watches this in horror and can't believe the punishments the callers
suggest. Unfortunately that's Minnie Driver's only good scene.</P>
<P>A big plus is Dan Ackroyd as professional killer Grocer whose job it
is to kill Martin. Their exchanges are a joy to watch for every lover
of bizarre humor.</P>
<P>GROSSE POINTe BLANK  has too many loose ends and boring parts to be a
masterpiece, but it makes a nice change to watch it in between
blockbusters. Sense of (very) black humor required.</P>
<PRE>Rating: ** 1/2 out of ***</PRE>
