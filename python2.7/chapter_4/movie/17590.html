<PRE>The Matrix ****</PRE>
<P>rated R
starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano,
Hugo Weaving
written and directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski</P>
<P>What is the matrix? If it helps answer the tagline question, THE
MATRIX is the most satisying and stylish action pic since
FACE/OFF. The second film by the Wachowski brothers, THE MATRIX will
remind many viewers of 1998's little-seen Alex Proyas masterpiece DARK
CITY. It has a similar look to it, and a similar message.  But after
seeing THE MATRIX, the movie that came to mind was Terrence Malick's
misunderstood war epic THE THIN RED LINE. Like THE THIN RED LINE, THE
MATRIX is a heavily disguised, poetic and metaphoric meditation on
finding God, and the difference between pure good and evil.</P>
<P>The complicated plot of THE MATRIX is too good to spoil, so I will not
go in depth.  Keanu Reeves plays Thomas "Neo" Anderson, a computer
programmer who wakes up one morning(a la DARK CITY) and finds that
people are out to get him. He is then contacted by Morpheus(Laurence
Fishburne), a man who says he's out to help him. He then joins
Morpheus' squad and travels into the matrix, a world that is supposed
to shield you from reality. Morpheus believes that Neo is "the one"
who can somehow save the human race. Neo trusts Morpheus and believes
his prophecy. And Neo decides to stay in the matrix, unable to ever
leave.</P>
<P>The Wachowski brothers, who made the brilliant mob caper BOUND, have
backed THE MATRIX's blistering, electric style with substance to
create what is not only a perfect futuristic noir thriller, but a
perfect pre-Y2K film. THE MATRIX took a long 5 year journey to the
screen, but the time all seems worth it. THE MATRIX should also be
credited as the film which revives Keanu Reeves' career. After trash
like JOHNNY MNEMONIC and FEELING MINNESOTA, Reeves is finally back in
style, playing the hero with as much natural tenacity as his hero in
SPEED. Mainstream audiences are likely to leave THE MATRIX feeling
clueless and cheated, but like THE THIN RED LINE, they should give the
film a second viewing to appreciate a subtlety that is largely lost in
modern cinema. THE MATRIX may not be an Oscar winner, but the film is
almost a shoo-in to be a cult classic. Of all the many questions I was
left with after viewing THE MATRIX, the most important one I could
think of was "When is the sequel?"</P>
