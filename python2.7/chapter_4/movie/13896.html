<P>   Dancing makes an otherwise banal life bearable ("Saturday
Night Fever") but can be awfully cruel ("They Shoot Horses,
Don't They?").  It can be humankind's ultimate statement of
grace and beauty ("The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle")
but can also be a hotly contested sport event ("The Tango
Lesson").  Learning to dance can change your life ("Shall We
Dance"). In Randa Haines' film "Dance with Me," it is all of
the above.  "Dance With Me" is a hot, salsa-driven hoofer
piece superimposed on a soapy story which you can all but
ignore as you get caught up in the pulsating Latin and
international tunes like "Jibaro," "Teach Me Tonight," "Arrolla
Cubano" and "Adios Santiago."  Choreographed by Daryl
Matthews and Liz Curtis with striking ballroom costumes by
Joe I. Tompkins, "Dance With Me" is directed by Randa
Haines in the Dominican Republic (standing in for Santiago de
Cuba), Los Angeles, Houston and Las Vegas.  The climactic
scene in Vegas, the locale of an World Latin dance
championship, is a stunner, one which proves that movies can
easily compete with stage in the presentation of musicals and
dance-driven works.  The movie also introduces Chayanne, a
Puerto-Rican born heartthrob, a recording artist and TV actor
in his film debut.</P>
<P>   When novelist E.M. Forster wrote his famous words "only
connect," he may not have been thinking about the dance
floor as the ideal place to bridge cultural gaps.  But Daryl
Mathews, who scripted this movie, uses the ballroom studio to
show how plain and fancy footwork can bring people of
diverse ages, cultures, and temperaments together.  "Dance
With Me" deals with people who have individual and distinct
flaws: Ruby (Vanessa L. Williams), the beautiful former dance
champion who has been burned in love, keeps her distance,
and dreams of re-entering the famed Latin competition in Las
Vegas; Rafael (Chayanne), a Cuban whose mother had died,
who does not know his father, and whose only familial
connection is with the people of his town of Santiago; John
(Kris Kristofferson), a burned-out owner of a fading dance
studio in Houston who has a mysterious attachment to young
Rafael; and Bea (Joan Plowright), a fun-loving senior citizen
who looks to the Houston studio to rekindle her passion for
life.</P>
<P>   When Rafael shows up at the Houston, Texas studio at the
invitation of its owner, John, he cannot help being drawn to
Ruby, a dance instructor who has all the right steps but
seems not really to feel the music.  She, in turn, disdains
Rafael's undisciplined but heartfelt style. When the two try to
mambo, their distinct steps are as incompatible as their
temperaments.  At first, Ruby persists in remaining aloof, but
she is unable to hold her enchantment with the newcomer at
bay.  As their affection grows, so does the attachment
between Rafael and John, the studio owner ultimately
revealing hitherto undisclosed information about their link.</P>
<P>  Randy Haines' direction brings out the full intensity of the
world of dance, one which is probably unfamiliar to most
people in the audience who may have thought that social
dancing was simply an enjoyable pastime to fill celebratory
weekends.  Haines introduces us to the grueling practice
needed to feel comfortable in entering the Vegas tournament
and the intensity of those who compete partly for fun but
mainly with the conviction that winning is everything. 
Photographer Fred Murphy offers us plenty of closeups of
Chayanne, who may enjoy aspirations of becoming the next
Antonio Banderas but whose acting at this point is not totally
assured.  But Vanessa L. Williams proves that a Miss
America can indeed be multi-talented.  Ms. Williams is drop-
dead gorgeous, can persuade the audience that she is a
world-class dancer, and ignites the screen with her newly
surfaced longings.   We squirm in watching the abuse handed
her by her gruff partner and former lover in the Vegas
competition, and feel a twinge of embarrassment in the way
the seventy-something Bea is patronized: a senior citizen who
twice insists, "I want to do that do" as she watches the lovely
ballet-trained Patricia (Jane Krakowski) lifted high into the air
by Rafael.</P>
<P>   "Dance With Me" follows the structure of Baz Luhrmann's
1992 Australian offering, "Strictly Ballroom," a spirited musical
about a competitive ballroom dancer who outrages his mother
and the establishment by insisting on dancing his own
provocative steps.  With its pulsating music, gifted performers
(both extras and principals) and charismatic stars, "Dance
With Me" is a crowd-pleaser which just might encourage
some viewers to get up and frolic in the aisles.</P>
