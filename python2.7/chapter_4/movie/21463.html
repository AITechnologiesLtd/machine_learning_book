<P>I am an amateur movie reviewer.  "Amateur", of course, implies two
things -- that I am not very good, and that I am not getting paid.  (All
those who wish to remedy this status, either by telling me how wonderful
I am or by giving me money, are free to do so.)</P>
<P>But being an amateur, I have certain freedoms.  I do not have to see
every movie, whether it's one of those arthouse flicks that gets hyped
on NPR or one of those mindless teen slasher movies.  I do not have to
review every bad movie I see, which meant that I did not have to
chronicle the multiple sillinesses in, let's say, The Thirteenth
Warrior.  (Or, as they're calling it at the studio, the Chapter
Thirteenth Warrior.)</P>
<P>But most importantly, if a movie is really important for me, if it
really speaks to me in meaningful ways, if I can't write a coherent
sentence about it because of the flood of feelings that come washing
through me, I don't have to write a review.  I tried for weeks to write
a Good Will Hunting review before I figured out that I could stop and go
to the next review.  I didn't have to search my emotional thesaurus to
fight the right words to describe how Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's
script affected me.</P>
<P>And I thought, there for a while, that I wouldn't be able to write a
Fight Club review.  I had the first paragraph done, but I got stuck.
"Fight Club is a movie about men and manliness," I wrote, right after I
first saw the movie.  "It is about blood and courage and recklessness.
It celebrates the raw power of men beating the stuffing out of each
other.  It is a macho, savage movie with scene after scene of
bloodletting and violence.  These things are all true, to some degree,
but they do not encompass the movie.  The truest thing about Fight Club
is its resonance, the way it tugs on the little harp strings in your
chest that let you know when something  is... is..."</P>
<P>I thought, there for a while, that Fight Club had a capital-M Message.
A message specifically tailored for bored 30-year-old urban professional
children of divorce.  A message that would ring in our ears and inspire
us. Somewhere in all that high-sounding bombast ("Our Great War is a
spiritual war.  Our Great Depression is our lives.") there was something
that was talking to us.  Something that would be the final word for all
of us lost, soulless Generation X slackers.</P>
<PRE>And I was right.</PRE>
<PRE>There is a message in Fight Club.  And that message is:  Grow the hell
up.</PRE>
<P>The key scene in Fight Club comes very early on in the movie, and is, in
the way, the pebble that starts the avalanche of silliness.  Jack the
Narrator (Ed Norton) starts the movie with a description of his life as
a thirtysomething cog in a corporate machine.  Cogs in machines don't
get to sleep, and neither does Jack, whose insomnia leaves him stumbling
through life.  Jack goes to see his doctor, begging for sleeping pills.</P>
<P>The doctor says no.  (Incredibly, he doesn't seem motivated by any
desire to save Kaiser's prescription plan a couple bucks.)  The doctor
tells Jack that he doesn't need pills, that he's really not going
through any real pain.  Go visit the testicular cancer survivor's
support group, the doc says, and see what real pain is like.</P>
<P>For a long while, I was mad at the doctor.  How dare he be so callous?
Just because Jack (or me) has trouble sleeping, or is depressed about
work and life and the quality of the furniture in our apartments,
doesn't mean that our struggles and our problems and our sense of
emptiness can be dismissed?  Just because our pain isn't as severe as
people with cancer or parents of murdered children or Rwandan refugees
doesn't mean that it's not important, doesn't it?  Doesn't it?</P>
<PRE>Well, maybe it does.</PRE>
<P>What I think the doctor is trying to tell Jack is two simple, universal
truths:
1.  Everybody's got problems.
2.  Everybody's got to deal with their own problems.</P>
<P>Jack learns the first part of this lesson, but not the second part.  He
begins to infiltrate support groups for diseases he doesn't have,
sucking up the grief of others like a sponge.  It helps him to sleep,
somehow, and gives him an emotional release.  (Thankfully, it gives the
audience some satiric fun, too.)  But it's not a real solution, as is
demonstrated when another faker (Helena Bonham-Carter) starts haunting
the same groups.  And when the real world hits Jack with a real and very
personal catastrophe, he can't use the twelve-steps to sidestep his
pain.</P>
<P>At this point, Fight Club opens the door for Brad Pitt's nihilistic
maniac Tyler Durden.  After a brief meeting on an airplane, Tyler and
Jack somehow form a relationship as balanced as the yin and the yang on
Jack's departed coffee table.  Tyler doesn't have any trouble sleeping.
He's a soap-making entrepreneur (you learn a lot more about the
soap-making process than you want to), outside the system, outside
materialism, outside any sense of right or wrong.</P>
<P>Tyler, himself a walking sartorial sight gag, lives in a trashed-out
nightmare of a house that represents a fantastic step forward in the
lively art of set design.  This house would cause Kosovar refugees to
turn up their noses and ask for a nice, dry tent.  Martha Stewart would
go mad with horror and fear.  This is the kind of house that would make
Bob Vila drop his tool belt and sadly walk away, frustrated by the
magnitude of the opportunity.</P>
<P>Together, Tyler and Durden found Fight Club, where men of all shapes and
sizes can pummel each other senselessly.  I said earlier that I thought
that Fight Club was about men and manliness, which is 100% wrong.  It's
about boys and boyishness.  Men fight, but they fight for reasons, be it
honor or protection of the weak or a multi-million-dollar pay-per-view
purse.  Fight Club is fighting for the sake of fighting, just the way it
took place on the Johnson Elementary playground.  The only thing
different is that no one is stealing anyone else's lunch money.</P>
<P>Fight Club eventually develops into Project Mayhem, which is more
childish but is childishly creative as well.  The men of Fight Club set
up code words and play soldier and get to stay up all night smashing
things.  The audience can, and does, take some juvenile pleasure in
seeing the world's biggest bowling ball run over a Starbucks, but that's
it.  No one in Project Mayhem is dealing with their problems, they're
blowing them up instead.</P>
<P>Fight Club itself has problems if its own that it doesn't deal with,
either.  Fight Club is as nonsensical as a history lesson from Pat
Buchanan or (to be nonpartisan) grand jury testimony from Bill Clinton.
It is lavishly overproduced, with baroque touches like talking penguins
and subliminal film splicing.  Everything is laid on too thick, from the
incessant, whiny narration to the blood flowing from Edward Norton's
nose to Brad Pitt's tough-guy act to Helena Bonham Carter's eyeshadow.
The whole movie screams of excess. (The screaming, unfortunately, is
loud enough to drown out a solid performance by Ed Norton and a dead-on
Winona Ryder impression by Helena Bonham Carter.)</P>
<P>The final verdict on Fight Club is a split decision.  There's a lot to
like and admire about the moviemaking skill that all parties (even Brad
Pitt) display.  If all you're looking for is a fun, mindless movie,
Fight Club may be for you.  But just as there's a message in Fight Club
-- a message that none of the actors heed -- there's also a danger.  The
danger in Fight Club, like the danger in nihilism itself, is that some
people will actually take it seriously.</P>

<P>"So how does a conservative movie reviewer, who doesn't want to spoil
the movie, write a review? The same way he takes the lamb chop from
rottweiller -- carefully. Another way is to fill two-thirds of the
column with irrelevant woolgathering about other topics so that you
only have room for a paragraph for the real review."  -- Jonah Goldberg</P>
