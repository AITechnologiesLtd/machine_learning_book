                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
          Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: *** (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>After its recent, serious-minded entries--the bleak "Hunchback" and the
tragic "Pocahantas"--the Disney studios have finally put the fun back in
feature-length animation with their 35th effort, "Hercules."  A colorful,
toe-tapping odyssey that is closer to the exuberance and charm of "Aladdin"
and "The Little Mermaid," "Hercules" follows in the footsteps of those
winning films, echoing their respective hipness and style.</P>
<P>Hercules the man (or is that the god?) lends himself well to the Disney
treatment.  While his twelve labors are conspicuously absent from the film,
he does put in a full day's work, battling hydras, cyclops, and a love
interest with ambiguous allegiances (Meg, voiced by Susan Egan, who looks
like she was modeled on Fran Drescher).  Meg's smart, curvaceous female is
just one of the typical components of the tried-and-true Disney formula.
Add also the well-chiseled hero, fighting to prove himself; the bumbling,
wise-cracking sidekicks, in this case the Bobcat Goldthwait and Matt Frewer
rendered Pain and Panic.  And, of course, the villain.</P>
<P>The bad guy in "Hercules" is Hades, ruler of the Underworld, performed by
James Woods.  Woods is the commanding force in the movie, fast-talking,
fast-scheming, and fast on his way to becoming his very own Mickey D's
tie-in.  With his blue, pilot light jet of hair, Hades is like a demonic
auctioneer on acid, waxing mythologic and anacronistic, with topical
references to Siskel and Ebert and everything in between.</P>
<P>Hades, wishing to topple Zeus and mount a hostile takeover of Mount
Olympus, sends his shape-changing sidekicks to steal Zeus' son, the infant
Hercules, turn him mortal, and knock him off.  The fates have forewarned
Hades that "should Hercules fight, you will fail."  Pain and Panic bungle
their mission and Hercules grows up mortal but with superhuman strength.
After learning of his origins, Herc sets out to become a "true hero," the
requirement for returning to Olympus.  His personal trainer is a cynical
satyr, Philoctetes ("call me Phil"), gleefully performed by Danny DeVito,
whose goofy irreverence evokes both the genie from "Aladdin" and the
flatulent warthog from "The Lion King."</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Hercules confuses fame with heroism, and it takes more than
a couple of sticky situations for him to learn that true strength comes
from within.  Coming as late in "Hercules" as it does, this message is not
too intrusive, although the film's "zero to hero" theme seems to have been
shamelessly borrowed from "The Mask."</P>
<P>While none of Alan Menken and David Zippel's see-you-at-the-Oscars,
gospel-influenced score--the pastiche-laden production numbers or slower,
soul-searching ballads--contain any real show-stoppers, the five Motown
muses who carry the story along provide a refreshing change of pace.</P>
<P>With the additional vocal contributions of Tate Donovan, Rip Torn, Samantha
Eggar, Barbara Barrie, and Paul Shaffer, "Hercules" is a grab bag of
personalities.  But at the end of the day, it's Woods and DeVito who give
"Hercules" its strength.</P>
