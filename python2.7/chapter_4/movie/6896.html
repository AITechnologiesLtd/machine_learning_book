<PRE>                               THE CRUCIBLE
                       A film review by Eric Robinette

Davison
Written by Arthur Miller, based on his play

Grade: A-</PRE>
<P>Now here's a tricky situation. Here's a film I really enjoyed and thought
was very well-crafted, and yet something about it somehow still seems to
be missing. What could it be? Let me go through the various elements.</P>
<P>The Story and Screenplay: Certainly little if any problem here.  The story
about religious fervor and wrongful persecution still packs a wallop in
this day and age, even though it maintains its Puritan-age setting, as
many have admiringly pointed out. That said, I'm not all that surprised it
worked; Arthur Miller remains a great writer. Maybe, just maybe, it might
have been a bit more challenging if in fact had moved the story to a
modern setting and perhaps kept the theatrical acting. Just a thought.</P>
<P>The Performances: Again, solid all around, though again that's not a
surprise with these actors. I especially liked Paul Scofield as the
imposing judge and Joan Allen as the wounded but strong wife. Winona Ryder
is also strong, if a bit overzealous in her role, as the catalyst,
Abigail. Only Daniel Day-Lewis is a little bit disappointing. Though
generally strong, he seems for the first time to be straining in certain
scenes, especially toward the emotionally intense ending.  Never a good
thing when you can "see" someone acting.</P>
<P>The Direction: Also very good. Nicholas Hytner avoids the "filmed play"
trap and very successfully opens up the action, and I especially liked how
his swooping camera suggest the "evil spirits." Only complaint: the
direction gets a little too busy and cluttered toward the end and confuses
the action, especially during that first multi-hanging.</P>
<P>So let's see. As it is, we have a film that's overall very powerful and
affecting, with distinct weaknesses in all the major areas. I guess the
main problem is the lack of surprises or any fresh devices in this movie. 
Many have marveled at  how effective the play is even in its historical
setting, but it always has been and always will be so long as irrational
fear and persecution exist. The menace doesn't have to be red, and there's
no news in that.</P>
<P>All in all, I expected a good retelling of a good play, and that's exactly
what I got. Nothing more, nothing less, and I was glad to have experienced
the film. But that lingering question remains--with a cast and crew this
talented, something even better might have been achieved. </P>
