<PRE>SCARY MOVIE
-----------</PRE>
<P>The Wayans Brothers ("I'm Gonna Get You Sucka, TV's "In Living Color")
go the way of the Zucker Brothers ("Airplane") with their parody of
recent teen scream flicks "Scream" "Scream 2" and "I Know What You Did 
Last Summer"  with the ironically titled "Scary Movie" ("Scream's" 
original title).</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Not since "Kentucky Fried Movie" (written by the Zucker Brothers, directed
by John Landis) in 1977, has a parody flick been so gleefully vulgar.
"Scary Movie" pushes the limits of the R rating even further than last
year's "South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut."   It's also pretty funny
in the Zuckers' tradition - if one joke falls flat, two or three more
will come along rapid fire that work.  </P>
<P>The story most closely follows the plot of the original "Scream," with
Carmen Elektra gamely appearing in the infamous first scene (her character's
appropriately named Drew), being tormented by the Edvard Munch masked killer
over the telephone as she makes popcorn.  Within minutes, the Wayans have
established good will by larking on the likes of Dennis Rodman, Jiffy Pop,
and teen flick T&A.</P>
<P>Cut to seven friends.  Cindy and Bobby (nudge, nudge) are the Neve
Campbell/Jennifer Love Hewitt, Skeet Ulrich standins with virginal Cindy 
leading on the always enthusiastic Bobby.  Regina Hall ("Love and Basketball") 
is Brenda, a "Clueless" standin and girlfriend of the sexual 
identity-challenged Ray (Shawn Wayans, getting one of the best laughs early 
on while asking for fashion advice).  Greg's (Lochlyn Munro) obnoxiousness 
teamed with girlfriend Buffy's (Shannon Elizabeth, "American Pie") beauty queen
dreams recall the "Last Summer" couple played by Ryan Philipe and
Sarah Michelle Gellar.  Marlan Wayans is Shorty, a stoner who tries
to remind the others how a black man can survive a horror flick.</P>
<P>Just by the character's name (Gail Hailstrom), it's easy to guess
who SNL'er Cheri Oteri is spoofing, although she only gets to shine in
the Wayan's refreshing brief (and therefore more effective) "Blair Witch"
reference.  Hilariously over-the-top, to the point of near cruelty,
is their handling of "Scream's" Dewey (played in those films by David
Arquette) as Doofy, although actor Dave Sheridan gets to redeem Arquette's
name in an amusing coda.</P>
<P>David L. Lander (TV's "Laverne & Shirley") has a cameo as Principal Squiggy
(take that, Henry Winkler!) and Jayne Trcka gets the loudest howl as
the girls' gym coach, Miss Mann.</P>
<P>Along the way, the Wayans have a ball with the "Scream" killer and his
mask, particularly in a scene where he gets stoned off an aquarium bong set
up by Shorty and his pals after receiving an invite that spoofs
a popular TV ad.  The essential mask changes shape to fit
the mood, such as the killer's befuddlement at some of his victim's utter 
stupidity.</P>
<P>It's a credit to the Wayans (Keenen Ivory directs and cowrote with Shawn,
and Marlon as well as Buddy Johnson, Phil Beauman, Jason Friedberg and Aaron 
Seltzer) that even cultural references which seem already overmined for
parody still come off well in their hands.</P>
<P>It's tight, it's outrageous and it's definitely not for small kids.
"Scary Movie" will have audiences screaming - in either laughter or in
surprise at the lengths the filmmakers go to gross people out.</P>

<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>"Airplane" collides with the Wayans brothers' "In Living Color" as helmer
Keenen Ivory Wayans leads his ensemble cast of family and friends in the spoof 
that spoofs the spoofs, "Scary Movie."</P>
<P>>From its hilarious ode to "Scream" beginning to its "The Usual Suspects"
sendoff  ending, "Scary Movie" takes no prisoners and bars no holds. Strongly 
influenced by the zany, machine-gun paced humor of the Zucker brothers, the 
screenplay, with a bevy of credited writers including many of the Wayans 
family, hits the comic bull's-eye more often than not. The raunchy nature of 
a lot of the gags caused screams - mostly of laughter, but sometimes, of shock 
- at the screening we attended. Shock value is definitely an important aspect 
of the humor here, but it is certainly not the only humor.</P>
<P>"Scary Movie" takes on the task of making a parody of the film that
re-established the horror spoof as a genre, "Scream." At the start, we see Drew
Decker (Carmen Electra), a beautiful high school student with a flatulence
problem, being stalked a la Drew Barrymore in the original - but with slapstick
hilarious, not tongue-in-cheek witty, results. Electra shows one hell of a good
sense of humor in capitalizing on her voluptuousness in the film's extended
opening before the title. The film goes on to poke fun at "Scream" from
beginning to end.</P>
<P>"Scary Movie," though, is not just a spoof on "Scream." As you watch, the
sizable ensemble cast move on to make fun of a bunch of horror flicks like "I
know What You Did Last Summer," "The Sixth Sense," and "The Blair Witch
Project." The parodies are almost universally over the top as the
comedian-actors slap you along side the head with their nasty, in your face
gags. And horror movies aren't the only ones that are used for the fun of it.
"The Matrix" gets its nod, as does the aforementioned "The Usual Suspects."
But, they don't stop there as they move on to all sorts of teen cliches, with 
no sacred cow un-skewered. Gays, virgins, handicapped people, retarded people,
straight people, stoners, beauty queens, transvestites, weird sex practices,
snot, movie goers, fat people, pubic hair, penises, dildos and more are fodder
for the many gags. It's surprising how many of them work, too.</P>
<P>The big cast got the chance to adlib and put their own spin on their
characters.  The free flow of imaginative humor is evident here as the actors 
give their own personalities to their roles. You can match the characters to 
their counterparts in the films being spoofed. Marlon Wayans as the constantly 
stoned Shorty, is like the Randy character in "Scream." He knows everything 
about horror movies and what you shouldn't do - split up, go into a dark room 
alone, answer the phone - but is too wasted to be of any help. Newcomer Anna 
Faris makes her debut as the central character, Cindy Campbell, putting a 
good-natured spin on the dour Neve Campbell role in the original. Regina Hall 
("Love and Basketball") plays the girlfriend to the sexually uncertain Ray 
(Shawn Wayans), the BMOC football player who likes to take showers with his 
teammates and has Brenda dress up in his football pads and helmet. Hall is 
outstanding when she gets to be the movie-goer-from-hell and a film critic's 
worst nightmare. The other players - Dave Sheridan as town simpleton Doofy, 
Shannon Elizabeth as high school sex kitten Buffy, Cheri Oteri as the 
cutthroat TV reporter Gail Hailstorm, and the rest - also help make the 
humor happen.</P>
<P>The behind the camera work befits the efforts of those in front of it with
costuming, by Darryle Johnson ("The Wood"), matching the tone of the films
being spoofed. The same goes for the production design by Robb Wilson King 
("Rush Hour") and photography by Francis Kenny ("Harriet the Spy").</P>
<P>To tell you about all the gags, puns, funny bits and shocks of "Scary Movie"
would be to deprive you of the pleasure of having it all come as a nice
surprise. But, be forewarned, the "R" rating for this film is completely
warranted for the raunch factor. Some think that an "NC-17" rating would be
more suitable. I go with the hard "R" and it is very hard. Parents beware of 
taking younger teens and below to this one. I give it a giggling B.</P>
