<PRE>                             CYRANO DE BERGERAC
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     The French-language film CYRANO DE BERGERAC stars France's most
popular actor, Gerard Depardieu.  It is a handsome, affecting version of
this nineteenth century warhorse, a verse play by Edmund Rostand.</P>
<P>     Americans mostly, I assume, know Cyrano through the interpretations
of Jose Ferrer (also called CYRANO DE BERGERAC) and Steve Martin
(ROXANNE).  Martin's pastiche of the source material is a pretty good
vehicle for him, but not necessarily for the story or for his
Cyrano-esque character, but especially not for his Roxanne played most
ineptly by Daryl Hannah.  Jose Ferrer's 1950s film, on the other
extreme, is extremely stagy in its concept and execution, which is to
say it looks and sounds like a filmed stage play, and Ferrer's delivery
is smooth, polished, Shakespearean, and fluid--a gentleman's Cyrano.</P>
<P>     The best quality that Depardieu brings to Cyrano is his roughness,
his lack of smoothness, polish, and Shakespearean (or Comedie Francaise)
delivery.  Depardieu reminds us that Cyrano, despite his aristocratic
lineage is a Gascon, practically a foreigner in Seventeenth-Century
Paris, impecunious, a poet, and a soldier.  His Cyrano has more in
common with the pit than with the precieux in the boxes or sitting on
the stage itself.  This Cyrano is a populist rogue, a thief and a
roughneck, a very angry man who makes us understand why he is so ready
to fight.  In fact, Depardieu's impassioned, angry, noble, and
principled Cyrano reminded me most of that wonderful poet and scalawag
Francois Villon (whose best-known poem is probably the ballade in "Le
Testament" with the refrain "Mais ou son les neiges d'antan" or "Where
are the snows of yesterday").</P>
<P>     CYRANO is filled with wonderful scenes of great detail, texture,
and brilliance.  The opening sequence takes us into a primitive theater
and down into the pit, a place so abandoned to its own chaos that bears
would blush to be seen there.  It is there we first meet Cyrano, who
causes a glorious uproar that results in a duel with a precieu, a kind
of literary dandy of the day.  During the duel, Cyrano promises to
extemporize a ballade and to finish his opponent with the last couplet.</P>
<P>     I have not seen a costume flick that so evoked the nitty-gritty of
early modern life since THE THREE/FOUR MUSKETEERS movies of Richard
Lester.  This Paris not only glitters, it stinks.  War is not only
brave charges, it's slowly starving to death in siege, it's dying in a
suicide charge ordered by a supercilious and vengeful officer.  The
production values and the research behind them alone recommend the
movie.</P>
<P>     I regret I am not sufficiently familiar with the French cinema to
know any of the actors in CYRANO except for Depardieu.  I can tell you
Depardieu has not been better since LA RETOUR DE MARTIN GUERRE and that
his performance totally redeems his reputation from an extremely
objectionable and hateful movie he appeared in four or so years ago,
which I think was released in this country as MENAGE A TROIS.  I can
praise the actor who played Roxanne, but I cannot tell you her name,
alas.  As is the often the case in the best French movies, this one is
densely populated with wonderful character actors, all of whom are
worthy of praise, but who will remain anonymous masters of their craft
for this poster.</P>
<P>     And now a word about the subtitles.  They are a verse translation
by the English writer Anthony Burgess (A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, ENDERBY,
etc.).  At first, when a rhymed couplet appeared on the bottom of the
screen I was a little distracted.  But I quickly acclimated and forgot
about them.  CYRANO is a wordy play and movie, scenes consist of
wonderful speeches more than action.  The subtitles are, in fact,
admirably succinct and easily encompassed without losing sight of the
screen area above them.</P>
<P>     This CYRANO works hard at not being a filmed play.  The result is
sumptuous, detailed, and lively camera work.</P>
<PRE>     Allow me to recommend this CYRANO as the best ever filmed.</PRE>
