<P>     It took watching A TIME TO KILL for the second time in less than a
year for me to realize that I had been too easy on it the first time
around.  Actually, it wasn't A TIME TO KILL I saw the second time -- it
was GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI -- but that's merely a technicality.  One film
per year about a white Mississippi lawyer struggling to Do the Right Thing
in the face of familial protest, racist threats and an intransigent
justice system should be the legal limit, and the second such film is
bound to feel like the end of a marathon session of multi-cultural
sensitivity training.  The premise is simplistic and obvious, but at least
A TIME TO KILL featured some strong performances.  GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI
is a plodding, ridiculously earnest film in which any potential drama gets
water-logged in a big puddle of white liberal guilt.</P>
<P>     The fact-based GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI opens in 1963, with the murder
of civil rights leader Medgar Evers (James Pickens Jr.) by white
supremacist Byron De La Beckwith (James Woods).  Though the evidence
against Beckwith is strong, the presence of more than a few similarly
minded witnesses and jurors results in two hung juries in 1964.
Fast-forward to 1989, where assistant D.A. Bobby DeLaughter (Alec Baldwin)
finds the Evers case brought to public attention again by Evers' widow
Myrlie (Whoopi Goldberg) and a newspaper article about jury tampering in
the 1964 trials.  Bobby begins to re-open the case against Beckwith, but
finds little which promises any success:  evidence has disappeared,
witnesses have died, and plenty of people feel the past is best left
undisturbed.  But the case becomes a personal quest for Bobby, who finally
brings Beckwith to trial again in 1994 only to discover that his mission
of healing still has a long way to go.</P>
<P>     The first images in GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI are icons of the fight for
racial equity -- segregated drinking fountains, Jackie Robinson, Martin
Luther King -- underlined by Marc Shaiman's spiritual-influenced score,
and you need no further information to figure out where Rob Reiner plans
to take the story.  This is a film which wants you to leave with the
message "Racism is bad" tattooed across your backbrain, and I suppose
you'd have to say that it succeeds.  Unfortunately, Reiner and writer
Lewis Colick spoon-feed that message to the audience like it was cough
syrup; they are so concerned with making GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI good for
you that they don't take the time to make it good.</P>
<P>     Many of the same problems were evident in A TIME TO KILL, along with
more than a few of the same specific plot details.  The hero's wife
admonishes him for his irresponsibility, anonymous racists vandalize his
property, and a threat to his family merely serves to stiffen his resolve
-- all familiar elements in serious-minded social dramas.  At lest A TIME
TO KILL had the benefit of some strong performances to give the stock
scenarios some spark, though.  Alec Baldwin plays Bobby DeLaughter as an
inscrutable portrait in solemn determination, tempered with patient
parenting; Whoopi Goldberg plays Myrlie Evers as an inscrutable portrait
in solemn determination, tempered with dignified grief.  As rabble-rousing
as A TIME TO KILL managed to be at times, at least there appeared to be a
few characters in it who were passionate about the incendiary issues
involved.  William H. Macy, on hand for comic relief as Bobby's nervous
investigator, often seems to be the only person in GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI
with a pulse.</P>
<P>     You might expect some energy from James Woods as the unrepentant
bigot, and to a certain extent you get it.  Smothered in old age make-up,
Woods works up a thespian sweat to make Beckwith an easy-to-hate villain.
His arrogance that no one would possibly convict a white man for killing a
black man is the only genuine emotion in GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI, but he
obscures it with mannerisms:  pursed lips, sniffs of disdain, bits of
background business.  There is such an obvious build-up toward a big
courtroom confrontation between Beckwith and Bobby that you can almost
hear Rob Reiner in the background coaching Woods on his "You can't handle
the truth" speech, yet that moment never comes.  And I found myself
missing it, as melodramatic and historically inaccurate as it might have
been, because at least it would have given GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI a fire to
match its sincerity.  I'm sure everyone involved felt they had made an
important film, and in one sense they have:  it is important to remember
that even sentiments this honorable needs to have an interesting story to
tell.  This MISSISSIPPI isn't burning...it's boring.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Ole Misses:  3.</PRE>
