<PRE>"Believe that!"
Starring Martin Lawrence, Luke Wilson, Dave Chappelle, Peter Greene.
Rated PG-13.</PRE>
<P>Martin Lawrence is in the first stages of big-time Hollywood fame. The
amiable comic got his very first breakout hit earlier this year with
Life, in which he co-starred with Murphy. Almost right on its heels
comes Blue Streak, another sure-fire box-office winner which puts
Lawrence at the head of a genre-hopping plot and an unexpectedly clever
script. He delivers and the movie triumphs. A nice recovery, also, on
the part of director Les Mayfield whom I all but gave up on after the
travesty that was Flubber.</P>
<P>Wasting no time, Mayfield throws us into the action. Lawrence plays
Miles Logan (have you ever heard a phonier Hollywood name?), a high-
stakes jewel thief, and in his latest heist, he has a complicated plan
to steal a diamond the size of a golf ball. He blunders big time and the
police are on to him, but before he can be arrested, he hides the
diamond in what seems to be the ventilation shaft of an abandoned
warehouse. After two years in the slammer, he comes back to retrieve his
treasure, only to find that his hiding place is now a police station and
the ventilation shaft is smack in the middle of the robbery homicide
department.</P>
<P>He attempts to infiltrate the building by posing as a pizza delivery
man. No luck there. "There are two kinds of people who get through that
door," he is told. "People wearing handcuffs and people wearing a
badge." Now there's an idea! He goes to an old buddy of his, who finds
it in his heart to make Miles fake police ID. He enters robbery homicide
claiming to be a newly transferred detective with an astonishing 16
(count 'em) citations in his former place of employment. Miles, being
the seasoned veteran that he is, is partnered with a newbie in the
department and proceeds to show him how the "big boys" work, often to
riotous results. He searches for "his baby" while attempting to come off
as a convincing police officer. He has unexpected success in the latter,
of course. He does find the diamond almost right away, too, but nothing
is that easy -- otherwise we wouldn't have a movie.</P>
<P>Blue Streak's plot is trite and generic, an assortment of formulas from
all different sources, including but not limited to the buddy movie, the
wacky cop movie and the always reliable mistaken identity caper. How
does it work, exactly? A lot of things come together for Mayfield, who's
a pretty lucky bastard, considering what he had coming into this high-
risk project: a sharp, witty script from Michael Berry and John
Blumenthal, as well as the extremely talented Lawrence, whose
performance will surely help his Hollywood status (read: raise his
asking price).</P>
<P>It got off to a slow start, and I was getting into that weird mind-set
of mine where I am actually excited about hating a film, but 20-25
minutes in, Blue Streak was beginning to grow on me. I realized that the
jokes were hitting the target. The script found new ways to wring laughs
out of tired situations, and though it wasn't consistently the most
hilarious things I've ever seen, I found solace in the fact that this
movie would still have been made had the writing relied only on old,
formulaic gags, like so many of today's Hollywood screenplays tend to
do. I enjoyed the parts that worked, and a good many did, but I could
even appreciate those that didn't quite get there, because most of them
found fresh ways to fail.</P>
<P>Martin Lawrence rises above the material every chance he gets. A
skillful ad libber, he is more than a fast-talking Eddie Murphy wannabe
(Chris Tucker comes to mind). He is a good actor with a tough but
strangely outgoing style. He has a way of looking like he wants to hurt
you when necessary, but really just wants to be your friend. As a
result, his characters tend to be less one-dimensional even when the
script calls for a walking cliché. Lawrence brings that same spirit to
Blue Streak, making what could have been a mean-spirited comedy an
affectionate one.</P>
<P>Look, this isn't Dr. Strangelove. It isn't even Bowfinger. But for what
it was, I liked it. Blue Streak is probably the most original unoriginal
comedy I've ever seen: a film that finds new ways to handle situations
you thought have been beaten into the ground by screenwriters past.
