<PRE>Twister
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>As in so many other films, dynamic special effects combine with cardboard
people to create a movie that is as much fun to watch as a Twinkie is to eat
and just as fulfilling.</P>
<P>The all-winners squad of writer Michael Crichton ("Jurassic Park"), director
Jan De Bont ("Speed") and godfather Steven Spielberg (most of the big buck
films from the past two decades) have come up with a force of nature that is
destined to suck money from the pockets of effects addicts. Count me on board.</P>
<P>Bill Paxton and soon-to-be new wife Jami Gertz drop by the tornado chasers to
get Helen Hunt, soon-to-be ex-wife and former partner, to sign final divorce
papers. In what would be an amazing coincidence if this were not a movie, the
mother of all tornadoes is brewing on the horizon. Paxton can't resist one
last hunt.</P>
<P>The bad guys here (besides that evil Mother Nature of course) are a team of
corporate tornado researchers out to steal Paxton's thunder while traveling
around in brand spankin' new black vans. Guess those black helicopters were
all being used by the UN. You don't need to pay much attention to these men.
They don't exist for any reason in the film.</P>
<P>The supposed human drama is supplied by the triangle between man, wife and girlfriend.</P>
<P>The tornadoes from Industrial Light and Magic are overwhelming. Most of the
storms and debris look real, with the exception of a goofy cow that goes
flying by one of the trucks a couple of times. Scary and remarkably forceful
stuff. That yellow and green sky that we've all seen around here will never
look the same to you.</P>
<P>As with "Jurassic Park", the last blockbuster from Spielberg and Crichton, the
monsters are amazing, but the people barely exist. The redeeming factor is
that the action scenes are grand and the talking scenes mercifully short.</P>
<P>Hunt does have some type of odd screen appeal, but appears to have been chosen
for the part because she wears white t-shirts well. Paxton is well-casted as
the obsessive everyman. There is a bit of chemistry between them, but the
script doesn't take it anywhere. Gertz disappears into the background.</P>
<P>The only acting stand-outs are Lois Smith as eccentric Aunt Meg and Philip
Hoffman as one of the wacky storm-chasing team. There are a couple of good
moments with each of them, but only a couple and only moments.</P>
<P>If you're going to see this, make sure you _don't_ wait for the video. On a
small screen there will be nothing there.</P>
