<P>Remember what I said about "The Wood"?  Well, ditto for this one. Get up,
get out, and get tickets to "The Best Man", NOW.  Sooner than that, even. 
Because as good as "The Wood" was, "The Best Man" runs circles around it.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below):
Reminiscent of "The Big Chill", "The Best Man" tells the story of a group
of old college friends who've come together for the weekend for the
wedding of their friends Lance (Chestnut), a professional football player,
and Mia (Calhoun), the love of his life. Complicating matters is the fact
that Harper (Diggs), a writer, has written a book called "Unfinished
Business", a barely-fictionalized account of the group's time together on
campus--including the unfufilled night that the character otherwise known
as Jordan (Long) spent with Harper's character, and more importantly, the
character otherwise known as Mia's tryst with Harper's character. Since
the book wasn't to be published until well after the wedding, Harper
didn't sweat it too much--except unbeknownst to him, up-and-coming TV
Producer Jordan had an advanced copy of the book and shared it with Murch
(Perrineau), a law student who can't keep a secret (not to mention not
being able to keep Shelby (DeSousa) off his tip long enough to straighten
out his spine around her), and Quentin (Howard), a "ne'er-do-well
professional student" (in Harper's eyes, the group member most wasting his
talents), who can't wait to bust on Harper (since Harper constantly
berates him for his life-choices). Further complicating matters is the
Thing that Harper and Jordan still have for each other--much to the dismay
of Robin (Lathan), Harper's girlfriend of two years with whom he can't
quite bring himself to make a full committment. </P>
<PRE>[Did I forget anything?]</PRE>
<P>The Upshot:
Never--not after "Soul Food", not after "love jones"; not even after the
aforementioned "The Wood"--never have I come out of a mainstream motion
picture feeling like I felt after seeing this one; feeling as if I saw
myself and my college friends again. This movie touched on so many of the
situations we all went through, it was scary. Though it was, of course,
exaggerated (none of us seemed to have wound up with the football star,
and I'm still working on that first novel), "The Best Man" rang true to
me, on a personal level. And the funny thing is, not all of my college
buddies were Black (I'll get back to that later).</P>
<P>Without having the "luxury" of being able to rely on the trickery of "thug
life" or "booty call" flicks, the success of "The Best Man", and movies
like it, depends on a strong, talented cast, writer, and director. This
movie has all three in...uh, abundance. There wasn't a clunker amongst
them, though Diggs (in my opinion, the second-weakest of a strong group)
kept reminding me of both his "The Wood" and "How Stella Got Her Groove
Back" characters. Still, he held his own, as did the rest: Chestnut (who
looked yummy with that facial hair of his goin' on) was not only
convincing as the former playboy baller turned committed groom, who
believed in God and wanted his best man--Harper--to Feel Him too, he was
also very funny in the role. Long's "Jordan" (who reminded me in many ways
of our own Diva!) was on it as the professional Black woman who, unlike
way too many of her sisters, did need a Black man in her life...if only
for one night. Perrineau could swing those locks of his my way, any day;
though he surpassed Diggs in the "needed to stretch the acting chops"
category, his character was quite sweet in dealing with the hilarious
Shelby--and DeSousa should win something for that performance of hers; she
had me rollin'! Calhoun's "Mia" seemed otherworldly, especially in her
first appearance; right away, I knew there was something more there than
meets the eye. And as Robin, Harper's long-suffering girlfriend, Lathan's
plea of "I'm not perfect [in comparison with Jordan]" to Harper, hit home
with me, after all of the arguments I've had on various Black lists about
how some Black men say they want "A Good Black Woman", but mean they want
"The Closest Black Woman With Good Looks And A Slammin' Body That I Can
Find Right Now". </P>
<P>But by far, my most favorite character was that of the oldest-looking one
of the bunch, Quentin; which is saying a lot, because he was my least
favorite character to begin with. The trash that fell from his lips (see
below), annoyed me--until I realized that it was just much talk and
bravado, covering up the deeper side of Q (the bid whist scene is what
turned it around for me; and that these characters chilled over a game of
bid whist, warmed me all the more to this movie). The more Q made me
laugh, and the more I saw his instigating for what it was meant to be, the
better I understood him (and like Jordan, Q reminds me of a scaalister who
shall remain nameless, but everybody who follows scaalist, knows who I
mean, I bet), and by his closing scene, I found myself wanting to hang
around this great character--and his friends...</P>
<P>...none of whom could've been realized without the writing and directing
talents of Malcolm Lee. Last week, before the movie opened, Lee and some
of the cast members of "The Best Man" were on the campus of Michigan
State, and because of a previous committment, I missed it, to my
detriment. I sure would've liked to have met this man, who has all of the
skills of his famous cousin, Spike, but none of the harsh (and sometimes
misplaced) anger and overzealous storytelling (though you can indeed see
shades of Spike's groove in Malcolm's work. Case in point: during the
bachelor party, when Lance reads the passage in Harper's book that
addresses Harper's and Mia's book character's involvement, the screen
colors shift to a pot-boiling red, and you can see and feel the anger
welling up in Lance without a word having to be said. If that wasn't a
Spike-ism, my name ain't Bammer). Spike, I loves ya, hon, but Malcolm
could teach you a thing or two about telling Our [non-monolithic] story.
And so as not to negate Spike's rightful place in Black filmmaking, I'd
love to see a more collaborative Spike and Malcolm joint; as my son is
wont to say, I bet it'd be tight.</P>
<P>Aside from my personal joy in watching it, this flick told a story that
was good in its own right, without the added "...for a Black movie" that
is bound to come up in various reviews and general chatter about it. From
the very nice opening titles, to the music (more on this in a minute,
too), to the smart, sexy, and real characters and equally smart, sexy, and
real story, "The Best Man" gets my early nod for one of the best movies of
1999. I'll put it this way: "The Matrix" is no longer standing on its "up
there" platform alone.</P>
<P>This is not to say that there weren't problems with this flick, number one
being its overuse of the term "nigga" and "bitches" (especially the
former). Had they kept it to a single character--Q, in this case--I coulda
dug it; but to hear that falling liberally from the lips of Harper (who,
as a professional writer in his chosen genre, should've known better) and
to a lesser extent, Lance, it just didn't fit the general positive groove
of the movie. I also took Issue with the underuse of the extremely
talented Perrineau (oh! the beauty of his locks! I could spend hours
playing in th...oops. Caught digressing again). Surely there had to be
more to him than his lack of balls, Malcolm! The final nitpick I had--that
the wedding reception had a cliched live band "playing" obvious recordings
of (nevertheless great) tunes by Earth Wind & Fire and Cameo--was
completely wiped out by everyone at the reception doing the Electric
Slide. Our audience cheered loudly at that, and I must say, I was amongst
the cheerers. Good thing I stayed around for the credits too; I would
otherwise have missed one of the best scenes in the whole flick.</P>
<P>All of which to say, if you are still reading this and haven't gone out to
see the movie yet, shame on ya. Get up. Get out. Get tickets. NOW.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]
    As a Black woman, I see the "Black Factor"--things that affect me as a 
    "consumer of color"--in many aspects of life; movies included. Whether 
    from the standpoint of noting Black (and other "minority") cast and crew
    members (if any), to the (lack of) focus toward "people of color" (dag, I
    hate that term), to the out-and-out antagonistic attitude toward Us 
    (Jar-Jar, anyone?), the "Black Factor" (BF) is something that plays as 
    much a role in my film enjoyment as any other aspect of the movie itself.</P>
<P>The term "...for a Black movie" (along with its cohorts, "the Black
[insert White movie or star's name]" is rife with (not-so-hidden) meaning.
Taken one way, it could be seen as dismissal: "oh, that was good--'for a
Black movie'". Taken another way, it could be seen as pleasant surprise:
"Damn, that did well as the box office--'for a Black movie'" (and while
we're on the subject, I wonder what the pundits will say about TBM being
number one on its opening day? Hmmm...). But a curious thing happened
before this one opened: I had just made mention on the "3BC Scheduled
Reviews" page of how this flick was being favorably compared to "The Big
Chill", when I saw Taye Diggs on one of the entertainment TV shows,
blasting a reviewer for saying that TBM is "The Black 'The Big Chill'".
And it made me pause, because I understand what Diggs was saying, and to a
certain extent, agree with it: why did "The Black" have to be added to
that statement? Does the fact that Blacks make up the majority of the
cast, delegate it to being a "Black" movie (on the same lines as, say,
"Carmen Jones" or "The Wiz", were?) And what of the Whites who enjoyed it?
There were Whites of all ages in our audience; should they not have been
there since it was seen as a "Black" movie? And what does that say about
"White" movies? After all is said and done, as Diggs said, "I thought
we've gotten past all that".</P>
<P>...but you see, on that ubiquitous Other Hand, past that "certain extent",
I think Diggs was either being naive, or purposefully stirring up
controversy to generate publicity for the movie. Because if you're Black
In America (or White, for that matter, not to mention Latino, or Native,
or, or, or...) and don't see that there are experiences that are unique to
the culture in which you were raised, you are blind indeed (and man, do I
hate the term "colorblind", for all that it denotes. "Color Indifferent",
I can get with. But once again, I digress.) That doesn't mean that one
can't appreciate or experience other situations; but that does mean that,
for now, "The Best Man" is seen as "The Black 'The Big Chill'". The extent
to which you say, or internalize, that as being racist or being something
"we've gotten past", is the measure of where We are as a People, and as a
country.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
There's a new Lee in town, and his name is Malcolm. We'll be watching for
more good stuff from you, my brother (and hoping that some of you will rub
off on your cousin).</P>
<P>"The Best Man" (rating: greenlight) 
I have a space on my DVD shelf reserved for this flick--right next to "The
Matrix".</P>
