<P>If you had told me this time last week that there was even the most 
remote chance that I'd damn near fall asleep while watching anything 
starring acting powerhouses Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones, I 
would've laughed in your face.</P>
<PRE>You'll notice I'm not laughing.</PRE>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Colonel Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), a highly-decorated, 
no-nonsense field Marine, is assigned to "babysit" the Ambassador 
Mourain (Ben Kingsley), his wife (Anne Archer), and their son  Justin 
(Hayden Tank), during a protest by Yemeni citizens at the Yemen Embassy.  
He sends the terrified Ambassador and his family on their way, and 
proceeds to try to get the situation under control.  But something goes 
terribly wrong; when the protestors start shooting and killing Marines, 
Childers orders Captain Lee (Blair Underwood) to give the order to the 
Marines to "waste the motherf---ers", under the "rules of engagement": 
policies and procedures put forth by the US President and Secretary Of 
Defense that allow US military forces to take actions they deem 
necessary to protect themselves from hostile forces.</P>
<P>National Security Advisor Bill Sokal (Bruce Greenwood), needing a 
scapegoat to take the focus off the government's part in the death of 83 
Yemeni citizens, demands that Childers be courtmartialed for murder, and 
brings in Major Mark Biggs (Guy Pearce), a very capable military lawyer 
who has spent more time behind a desk than behind a rifle, to prosecute 
the case.  Knowing what he's up against, Childers seeks out 
newly-retired Colonel Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), with whom Childers 
served a tour of duty in Vietnam in 1968, saving Hodges' life when he 
was under severe fire by the enemy.  Hodges, however, doesn't have the 
confidence in himself that Childers has; seeing himself as only a 
"shot-at Marine" and a very weak lawyer, Hodges reluctantly takes 
Childers case--but soon discovers that things in this case may not be as 
they seem.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
I briefly watched CBS's early morning news-light program on Monday, and 
caught the tail end of Gail wazzername's review of this movie [which 
reminds me: though I can't remember her last name, it's undeniable that, 
even with the dismal ratings of this pseudo-news telecast, Ms. 
Wazzername should be considered a "nationally known Black reviewer".  
That last bit will mean something to those of you who've read the 
history behind 3BC.  But I digress].  I was more than a little shocked 
to hear her use terms such as "powerful" and "emotional" when describing 
this flick's contents.  I guess we must've watched two different movies; 
I've seen more emotions in a loaf of bread that anything I saw within 
"Rules".</P>
<P>The onus for this rests squarely on the shoulders of three men: director 
William Friedkin, and actors Samuel L. Jackson and (to a somewhat-lesser 
extent) Tommy Lee Jones.  Friedkin lost me early on; once that camera of 
his started looking like something straight out of NYPD-BLUE, I knew it 
would be a struggle to take this movie seriously.  Of course, it doesn't 
help that "Rules" has a very derivative, been there/done that feeling.  
It suffers from the comparisons with A FEW GOOD MEN, COURAGE UNDER FIRE, 
and for that fact, PLATOON.  And with the big push these days, post- 
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, toward movies about World War II, one has to wonder 
why Vietnam was the (bad) choice for a starting point here. </P>
<P>As for Jackson and Jones, to say I was disappointed, would be an 
understatement.  I've always thought I'd be happy to watch these two 
read the Yellow Pages; but even that would've been more exciting than 
their flat performances in "Rules".  The normally-explosive Jackson had 
exactly three moments of powerful clarity: the first was his vintage 
Samuel L. "motherf---ers" outburst; the second was the Obligatory Fight 
Scene Between Friends (Childers and Hodges)--which led to Childers 
blurting out the cliched "you're nothing a drunk!" (which itself led to 
me rolling my eyes and groaning in dismay at the cliche); and the last 
was the also Obligatory, though still enjoyable, courtroom scene where 
Major Biggs confronted him about the original outburst.  That's it; 
everywhere else, Jackson could've been played by his stunt double, and I 
wouldn't have noticed.  Jones fared a little better; though he played 
against type in his portrayal of a Colonel without command--of himself, 
primarily--he did show a few moments when his strong acting skills were 
brought to the fore.  These moments were too few and far between, 
though, and I began thinking that his character shared between THE 
FUGITIVE and DOUBLE JEOPARDY would be a lot more fun to watch than the 
boring Colonel Hodges.</P>
<P>In a nutshell, I never once felt any real chemistry between Jackson and 
Jones; any feints toward Childers and Hodges supposed friendship rang 
hollow, and everything between Childers' outburst and the completely 
flat and unimaginative ending, felt like so much filler, with the 
outcome of the trial a foregone conclusion.  The outrageous epilogue 
only added insult to injury, but by that time, I was more than ready to 
quickly exit, stage right.</P>
<P>The supporting cast, had they been used to the extent of their 
abilities, might have made this movie somewhat more bearable.  Ben 
Kingsley playing a cowardly Ambassador?  Hey, that had legs; why didn't 
they explore it more?  Blair Underwood as a Captain asked to order the 
execution of what he thought were innocent citizens?  What a subplot! 
hmmm...but he's out of the movie almost as quickly as he was there.  
Philip Baker Hall as the senior General Hodges, playing against Jones as 
Hodges Jr., with the addition Nicky Katt as Hayes Hodges the third?  
Talk about your generation gap!  Talk about your clash of titans, 
between Hall and Jones!  Talk about your...what do you mean, they never 
really "talked" about it?  </P>
<P>Talk about a waste of potential.  There were a bright spots, however: as 
the "unfeeling" prosecutor, Guy Pearce's Major Biggs made more of his 
part than was probably written in the script.  Pearce, along with Anne 
Archer in her turn as the Ambassador's wife, and Hayden Tank as her 
convincingly frightened son, showed the only real emotion in this 
otherwise linear movie.</P>
<P>In the end, I had the same feeling of disconnect with "Rules" that I had 
with THE INSIDER, in that both of them presented the viewer with a 
"duh!" situation: "Big Tobacco/Government Evil Empires seek targets to 
take the brunt of the blame for their own Evildoing?  Duh!".  The 
difference between an "Insider" and a "Rules", though, is that the 
former engaged me with interesting--and interested--performances by the 
cast and crew.  "Rules" never came close; laughingly lame special 
effects (could that blood have looked more fake?), bad camerawork (clue 
number 1: please leave Shaky-Cam on ER and NYPD-BLUE where it belongs), 
ill-advised casting decisions (clue number 2: 1968 was more than 30 
years ago; if Tommy Lee and Samuel look exactly like they looked in 
1968's Vietnam, I'm a monkeys uncle.  Next time, don't be so cheap; 
splurge on younger lookalikes for the flashback scenes) and most of all, 
off-the-mark performances by its lead players, totally shot any chance 
that I could suspend my disbelief long enough to just ignore the bad for 
the little good that was there.</P>
<P>I can live with being The Only One who didn't find this movie 
compelling; the majority of reviews I've read thus far, pretty much laud 
"Rules" as the best movie of this dismal film season.  No matter; I 
stand firmly behind my opinion that there was precious little on the 
screen that came across as heartfelt.  The director and his 
actors--Jones and Jackson in particular--played by numbers that have 
been played much better in the past by actors with nowhere near the 
talent they have, and for those in the audience paying attention beyond 
the smoke and mirrors, that was the true insult. </P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
If I hadn't seen the neutering of two of the biggest bulls in the acting 
arena today--Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson--with my own two 
eyes, I wouldn't have believed it was possible.  Who'da thunkit?</P>
<P>RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (rating: yellowlight): 
In a word, "Rules" was disengaged.</P>
