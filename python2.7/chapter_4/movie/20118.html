<P>Illuminata is especially fun if you've ever spent any time around actors.
 The ones portrayed here are almost as crazy as most of the real
performers that I know.  </P>
<P>John Turturro portrays the playwright, Tuccio, who will go to any
extremes to see his `Illuminata' performed on stage.  He has written it
for the love of his life, Rachel (Borowitz), a `dedicated' actress.  Ben
Gazzara is wasted as her father, the aging actor who plays all of the
`old' roles.</P>
<P>When an actor collapses onstage Tuccio takes the opportunity to announce
that his play will be performed the following night, much to the chagrin
of Beverly D'Angelo and her husband, the theater owners who allow the
little-rehearsed play to take place. This enables Rufus Sewell, a
self-proclaimed `star' to finally get his chance to prove it.</P>
<P>But, resident critic Bevalaqua (Walken) doesn't like the play and pans
everyone in it, except for Marco (Irwin) whom he desires.  The play is
cancelled.  As we follow the sexual escapades of almost everyone in the
cast it becomes quite bawdy.  Whether they are using sex to try and get
the play resumed, or if they simply have uncontrollable urges, all of them
partake in various affairs of the heart, the funniest of which is the
Walken-Irwin encounter.  
Susan Sarandon perfectly portrays a self-centered star.  When Tuccio
accuses her of putting on an act, she replies that her entire life is an
act.  When she wakes in the morning and looks in the mirror, she acts, etc.
Strange as it may seem, Beverly D'Angelo is the only female that I recall
who didn't do a topless scene, although she did do her share of romping. 
Even ro-bust Aida Turturro has a great time of presenting her huge breasts
to her willing partner.
For the most part, this movie simply shows a self-indulgent Turturro and
some of his friends getting together for a little fun.  It's not that
offensive, and it's a fairly true look at back stage life.  I might watch
it again.  I give it a C+.</P>
