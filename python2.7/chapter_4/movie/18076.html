<P>The trailer worked. I would bet dollars to donuts that the infamous "money
shot" of Catherine Zeta-Jones curving her precious bottom under a laser
beam, pulled in at least half of this film's opening weekend box-office
numbers all on its own. That being said, ol' man Connery probably didn't
hurt the numbers with his Scottish charm and rugged good looks. And what
about the story, you say? Well, two out of three ain't bad.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Rich old guy/career criminal hooks with a beautiful young insurance
agent/undercover thief, to pull a couple of huge international heist jobs.
They train together, look good together, and mistrust each other together.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Entrapment is well, okay...I guess. Its plot is paper thin and packed with
implausibilities, its style is so-so, its acting is so-so, its action scenes
are so-so, in fact, the only thing that makes this film graze the mark of
mediocrity is its two great looking and charming leads, Catherine Zeta-Jones
and Sean Connery. Allright, so we don't really buy the supposed attraction
between Cathy and her 40-year senior Connery, but both actors are so filled
with conviction and charisma, that we don't seem to mind it all that much,
or the fact that the story itself offers very little in originality, action
or suspense. In fact, I'm even afraid to refer to this film as an actual
thriller, seeing that barely a thrill crossed my path until the film's
ultimate finale sequence.</P>
<P>Looking back, I suppose I was never really bored during this film, but never
really impressed by anything either. There were actually a couple of twists
and turns that I didn't foresee, but all of the action in this film was
based on so many preposterous ideas, that it was hard to care about the
story at all. And while the two leads were used effectively in this film,
Ving Rhames and Will Patton were side-players in roles that could've easily
been juiced up to the levels of each talented actor. The film did lack a
certain amount of style, but offered a good international feel, charming
leads and an easy-to-follow, despite being filled with holes, storyline. All
in all, a so-so kind of a movie.</P>
<P>PS: Someone please confirm to me that I did not see a razor-thin mustache
gracing Catherine Zeta-Jones' lovely upper lip throughout this movie...the
horror, the horror.... :)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Despite her Latin look, Catherine Zeta-Jones is actually Welsh and born in
Swansea, Wales, UK. She stands 5'8". She was apparently handpicked for this
role by actor and producer on this film Sean Connery.
In 1953, Sean Connery entered the Mr. Universe contest, finishing third in
the tall man's division. According to his friend and fellow actor, Michael
Caine, he is a bit of a hypochondriac. He stands 6'3".
THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS (6.5/10) director Antoine Fuqua was originally set
to direct this film. He was eventually replaced by Jon Amiel.
Screenwriter Ron Bass won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for 1989's
RAIN MAN (8/10), starring Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman. Among many other
screenplays, he's also written MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING (7.5/10), STEPMOM
(6/10) and WAITING TO EXHALE.</P>
