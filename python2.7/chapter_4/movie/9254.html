<PRE>                                U-TURN
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Oliver Stone gives us a story that
          would have been good had it not followed RED ROCK
          WEST and LONE STAR.  This film might have made a
          decent low-budget film with a nothing cast.
          Instead it under-uses several major stars who
          brought little special to their roles.  Sean Penn
          plays a small-time crook who is trapped in an
          Arizona town and becomes a pawn in conflicting
          deadly games.  Rating: low +1 (-4 to +4), 5 (0 to
          10)</PRE>
<P>     There is nothing superior about Superior, Arizona, an all but dead
town with a few people living in the carcass.  Small time hood Bobby
Cooper, played by Sean Penn, has engine trouble and must pull into
Superior to get his car fixed.  The one garage near town is run by a
desert rat of a mechanic (Billy Bob Thornton) who gives more trouble
than service.  Cooper leaves his car and goes into town and after a
bizarre interchange with a blind half-Indian beggar (a well-disguised
Jon Voight) he gets himself involved with attractive Grace McKenna
(Jennifer Lopez of SELENA).  Too late he finds she has a husband Jake
(Nick Nolte whose performance owes a lot to Bruce Dern).  Soon Jake and
Grace are each trying to embroil Cooper in a plot to kill the other.
If that were not enough of a problem there are people coming to town to
collect on a bad debt.  And to further complicate matters a local bully
wants to show how tough he is by beating up Cooper.  Cooper cannot
expect too much help from the town's unfriendly Sheriff Potter (Powers
Booth).  This seems to be a fly-speck town where everybody either has a
dark secret or is working full time on getting one, and too many of
these plots involve Cooper.  Most of the plot twists are telegraphed as
the film wends its way to a rather bloody and violent last reel.  But
by this point we do not care particularly what happens to Cooper who is
not particularly likable, even less smart, and who basically floats
like a cork and generally is acted upon rather than acting himself.</P>
<P>     In general this film is top-heavy with style touches that add to
uneven effect where less might have been considerably more.  John
Ridley's script based on his novel STRAY DOGS might have made a more
effective as a low-budget independent film with fewer self-indulgent
style experiments.  Oliver Stone has just a bit too much fun here
laughing a little too hard at exaggerated eccentrics for us to really
take the story seriously and the light-hearted score by Ennio Morricone
is a little too flippant.  Stone under-utilizes expensive actors where
unknowns might have worked a lot better.</P>
<P>     Since NATURAL BORN KILLERS weird camera effects have been a Stone
hallmark.  Even NIXON had to have a few weird visual effects and here
there are more than the story needs.  The film opens with Cooper
driving down a road under credits that look like they were scratched
into the film.  There are repeated images of vultures showing how
little sympathy this corner of Arizona has for the weak or unprepared.
Robert Richardson's cinematography experiments with film stocks as much
as it does with light.  He will drop into black and white and then jump
to a grainy super-saturation of color.  None of this does much to help
the mood of the film.</P>
<P>     U-TURN is one of those films in the middle ground.  Its flaws are
in large part ones we could overlook in a new filmmaker and still say
he is promising.  From a now major filmmaker like Oliver Stone, it
probably must be considered just a minor effort and perhaps a false
step.  I give it a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
