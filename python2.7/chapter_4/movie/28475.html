<P>You know, nearly being killed by a 3000-year-old mummy might discourage some 
folks from pursuing a career in archeology.  But not the O'Connell clan.  
Eight years after beating back Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo) and his dancing 
carrion, Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) are busy raiding tombs 
with their devilishly cute son Alex (Freddie Boath).  What they don't know:  
5000 years ago the Scorpion King (wrestler The Rock) sold his soul to Anubis 
in exchange for a demonic army of dog-men, and the time has come for Scorpy 
to rise again and take over the world.</P>
<P>Not everybody's in the dark.  The curator of the British Museum (Alun 
Armstrong) has a scheme to take over the army of Anubis, but he'll need some 
muscle.  So, he's raising Im-Ho-Tep from the grave again.  Why does he think 
that's a good idea?  </P>
<P>Mischievous Alex, the only one too young to know better, snaps on the 
Scorpion King's bracelet, making him the only one who knows the route to the 
lost oasis of Ahm Shere where the King and his army are resting in a golden 
pyramid.  When Im-Ho-Tep kidnaps Alex, Rick and Evie follow, along with 
Evie's no-good brother Jonathan (John Hannah), the Arabian knight Ardeth Bay 
(Oded Fehr), and a pilot named Izzy (Shaun Parkes).  Can this merry band whip 
two mummies and save the world?  I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled it 
off somehow.</P>
<P>I suppose it's only fair to mention that I was underwhelmed by the 1999 film 
to which  "Returns" is the sequel.  I felt that movie suffered from an 
identity crisis, unable to decide if it wanted to be "The Mummy" circa 1932, 
"Raiders of the Lost Ark," or "Army of Darkness."  Seemingly unaware that 
those movies had very different tones, "The Mummy" 1999 mixed elements from 
all three (and others) without any awareness that they clash with each other. 
 Even more so, "Returns" seems a bizarre gumbo of material borrowed from 
other films.  As a result, the movie leaves the viewer with the same uneasy 
feeling as a meal composed entirely of leftovers does.</P>
<P>Returning writer/director Stephen Sommers leaves little time for character 
development because the raison d'etre of this crowded pic is 
computer-generated battles with all manner of supernatural critter (including 
the slack-jawed henchmen from the last movie, the dog-men of Anubis, a bunch 
of mummy dwarfs, and the resurrected Scorpion King).  Sommers assumes that we 
a) know these characters and b) care what happens to them.  </P>
<P>The latter assumption is particularly false, due as much to bad acting as 
poor scripting. Brendan Fraser seemed an odd choice for a two-fisted 
adventurer in the first "Mummy," and he still doesn't seem to fit in his 
role.  He seems to have a gift for playing a good-hearted doofus ("Blast from 
the Past," "George of the Jungle," "Dudley Do-Right") but Action Hero is just 
not in his range.  Rachel Weisz doesn't bring much to the party either.  I 
liked her better in "The Mummy" because her character was out of her depth.  
In the sequel, Evie remembers she was a warrior princess in a previous life 
and starts kicking butt, making her more capable but less likable.  Also, the 
writers pressed too hard in asserting Evie as a respected scholar.  One line 
that made me wince was when she noted casually that people had been begging 
her "to take over the British Museum."  Weisz plays Respected Scholar about 
as convincingly as Denise Richards played Nuclear Physicist.</P>
<P>Wrestling fans beware, The Rock is hardly in the movie.  He is seen in a 
series of flashbacks at the beginning, but does not appear again as 
live-action.  (His character rises from the grave as a CGI beast).  I don't 
even think he has any lines.  However, those wanting some of his trademark 
trash talk should watch for a spin-off he's filming called "The Scorpion 
King."</P>
<P>Two actors who acquitted themselves well:  John Hannah and Oded Fehr.  Hannah 
is funny and charming as Jonathan.  His character is the only one not 
inflated beyond what the audience will buy or the actor can pull off.  As a 
result, Jonathan came off as the hero of the movie to me:  he's full of 
weaknesses and character flaws, but when his sister and nephew are in danger, 
he shows great courage.  Fehr has an easier job than most; all he has to do 
is look strong, handsome, exotic, and mysterious.  And he does it really well.</P>
<P>Bottom Line:  There's so much going on you may forget you don't care what 
happens to these people.</P>
