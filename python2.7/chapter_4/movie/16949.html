<PRE>A CIVIL ACTION
Rating: *** (out of four)
PG-13, 1998
Director/Screenplay: Steven Zaillian
Starring Cast: John Travolta, Robert Duvall, John Lithgow, William H. Macy</PRE>
<P>A CIVIL ACTION turned out to be about as good as I had expected, but not in
the way I had expected. Based on the previews, what I thought we were going
to get was a nice character film about a lawyer who finds himself
personally affected by a case for the first time with a considerable amount
of courtroom melodrama. Instead, the character development turns out to be
kind of thin, but the legal procedure is actually portrayed fairly
realistically and without a tidy happy ending.</P>
<P>John Travolta is the star of the film (which is based on a true story) as
Jan Schlictmann, a personal injury lawyer While he's not a totally
heartless sleazeball, certainly knows the ins and outs of his profession
and isn't about to take on a case solely because it's a good cause. There
has to be a clear, concrete argument to make that won't cost millions of
dollars, and they have to be able to sue someone whose pockets are deep and
who will offer a juicy settlement. As we learn from Jan's narration, a
personal injury trial rarely comes to an actual verdict: 98.5% of them end
in an out-of-court settlement. All a settlement really means, of course, is
that the lawsuit is a sufficient inconvenience that the defendant will
throw out some money to make it go away, not that they actually admit any
wrongdoing.</P>
<P>The trouble is, Jan's latest clients, a group of parents from Woburn,
Massachussetts whose children all died due to ill health, want exactly
that: an apology. They believe that their children's sickness was a result
of improper waste disposal procedures by some local companies which
polluted the water supply. At first, Jan is reluctant to take their case,
but eventually he agrees and undertakes a costly investigation into the
companies' disposal procedures. The problem is that their wishes really
have no place in the American legal system, at least not without a much
more powerful financial force behind them than Jan's firm. To get an
admission of wrongdoing, that means that Jan must prove that the companies
were at fault in court, but as he says, this is not the way personal injury
trials function: they function by ending early in a settlement.</P>
<P>Writer/director Steven Zaillian wisely avoids getting too heavy-handed with
all this: rather than belaboring the obvious cold-heartedness of Jan's
opponents, he sends them up with a light, satirical touch. Robert Duvall
turns in a good performance as the eccentric and arrogant Jerome Facher,
the lawyer who defends one of the corporations. He's certainly cynical and
manipulative, yet not really "evil" per se. He's just a world-weary lawyer
who knows that a trial is really just about putting on a good show:
"justice" has long since ceased to have any real meaning for him. His best
scene occurs about halfway through, when Zaillian intercuts his lectures to
a law school class with shots of him acting out the strategies he describes
in the actual trial. For example, he explains that frequent objections
serve to break up the other side's rhythm, as he tells his students, "If
you ever catch yourself nodding off in court, the first word out of your
mouth when you wake up should be 'objection.'" Then we see Facher himself
asleep during the trial, waking suddenly and exclaiming, "Objection!"</P>
<P>The trial, to put it mildly, does not go well. The judge (John Lithgow)
nixes some of Jan's defense strategy, and it goes on long enough that he
and his partners are more or less run out of business by the legal costs.
They even go so far as to sell their own houses and many of their other
possessions in order to keep going, but finally they reach a point where
they simply cannot continue any longer. Zaillian clearly wants this to be a
sort of transformational journey for Jan, but unfortunately he and his
partners are not developed very well. His sudden conversion from cynical
ambulance-chaser to bona fide crusader for justice happens too quickly. It
seems to result from little more than a walk down the river, where he sees
that the pollution the parents described probably is taking place, and some
serious thought about what it must have been like to lose a child. But
didn't he ever give *any* of his other cases this kind of consideration
before? What's different about this one that causes him to change his
attitude?</P>
<P>A CIVIL ACTION finds only limited success as a character drama, but it
makes up for it with its realistic, intelligent plotting and its avoidance
of excessive melodrama or an easy ending. It probably isn't one of the best
films you'll see, but it's never boring, and you may actually learn a few
things about the mechanics of a civil lawsuit in the process.</P>
