(delicate sexual setups)</P>
<P>Edward Norton is an excellent, versatile actor who has successfully 
avoided becoming stereotyped. This goes for this film too, where he 
plays a Catholic priest. And where Norton, in his first seating on a 
director's chair, has the tricky task of directing himself.</P>
<P>The results are OK. Not great, but still acceptably comedic-farcical. 
The script is pure feelgood Hollywood. You are always conscious that 
you are watching, and listening to, a movie.</P>
<P>In their teens, New Yorker schoolmates Brian, Jake and Anna were 
inseparable. Then the girl's family moved away. Cut to some 16 years 
later. The two men never ceased being best friends. Brian (Norton) is 
now Father Brian, a Catholic priest. Jake has become a rabbi. Both 
see each other all the time, even cooperate on projects. They are 
modern fellows, hep, hip and big hits with their congregations in New 
York's Upper West Side. (Jake's is noticeably upscale).</P>
<P>Anna, now a corporation executive in California is equally successful 
in her line of work. She goes back East for an indeterminate stay, to 
improve the efficiency of her company's New York office. She and the 
men meet for the first time in ages. The moment they see her at the 
airport they are stunned. The trio resume their old companionship.</P>
<P>Now here's the catch, and the movie's "raison d'etre" : both males 
fall in love with her, which means that they have a Big Problem 
--Brian because he is a priest, Jake because Anna is a "shiksa," a 
non-Jewish female.</P>
<P>While. of course, Brian cannot possibly get married, Jake knows that 
he should if he is to get promoted. In his synagogue, parents, and 
especially mothers, find him a most eligible catch for their 
daughters. Jake dates young women, with humorous results. But his 
attraction to Anna keeps growing. They become secret lovers, while 
Anna's relationship with Brian is such that the priest believes she 
feels unbrotherly love for him. What a mess!</P>
<P>Scenes and sequences more amusing than pathetic ensue, some directly 
involving the three principals, others colorfully peripheral.</P>
<P>I confess that I was constantly distracted by questions of height. 
When the three are seen together at the airport, it is obvious that 
Junoesque Anna is taller than Brian who is taller than Jake. But this 
keeps changing all the time. Take a reception attended by the 
Anna-Jake twosome. Within seconds the man goes from equal height to 
taller to less tall, and so on. There must have been hours spent on 
the sets placing boxes under Jake's feet, changing camera angles and 
perspectives, re-changing them.</P>
<P>Other aspects are less questionable, notably the funny ones. Such as 
a thirteen year old boy whose voice is breaking preparing for his 
Bar-Mitzvah. It's a scream and a screech. Such as the inevitable 
cell-phone gags. Or salesman Don whom the two clergymen visit for a 
Karaoke set. The young man switches from Asian English to New York 
accent in a flash, not to mention his singing performances. Or the 
irruption in the synagogue of a black choir, another device by Jake 
to shake up traditionalism. My favorite, seen early in the movie in a 
pre-flashback situation, is when a drunken Brian confides his
troubles to a barman. The latter, a Sikh with a multi-national, 
multi-ethnic family background has the best and most humorous 
bar-person role I can remember. And so it goes.</P>
<P>On the negative side, the Anna character was uninteresting and left 
me cold. The film entertains, but while its comedy works the romantic 
part (as in "romantic comedy") is unconvincing. Jake, in a variety 
of  ways,  plays up too much to his congregation. The happy ending is 
a tacked-on cop-out. And the common wisdom that comedies have to be 
on the sorter side is ignored, to the story's detriment and creation 
of some yawns.</P>
<P>On the whole, however, "Keeping the Faith" is most watchable.</P>
