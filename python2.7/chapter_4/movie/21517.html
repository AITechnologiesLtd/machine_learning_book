<P>   Few people could deny that the best way to die is in your
sleep, painlessly, at a healthy old age.  But alas, we're built
to experience pain, and death inevitably comes to some at a
slow pace and with great anguish.  Think of the plight of the
217 folks on that Egyptair that swooped down like a stone
near Nantucket, then took off for a few moments, finally to
break apart in midair.  Think as well as that executive who
was kidnapped a year or so ago, buried alive, and ransomed. 
His rescuers were too late to save him.  The very fear of
being mistakenly put under ground while we still have a pulse
must drive many a person to choose cremation.</P>
<P>   "Oxygen," a gripping thriller about burial alive, is written
and directed by Richard Shepard, whose 1992 caper comedy
"The Linguini Incident" reflected the fascination he still has
with Harry Houdini.  Though the movie involves an adrenalin-
rushing car chase and a scene that looks like something out
of "The French Connection," this is anything but the usual
cops and robbers melodrama but is rather an effective and
taut psychological thriller.  Its premise, that cops and bad
guys sometimes share the same evil inclinations, is given
believable cinematic dimensions because of a especially
good performances by Maura Tierney as a cop with a history
of emotionally sick behavior and Adrien Brody as the sharp-
witted 25-year-old psychopath who has her number--and not
just the one on her badge.</P>
<P>    Shepard develops the dauntless character of Madeline
(Maura Tierney) and her relationship with her cop husband
Tim (Terry Kinney) early on as the two sit on a New York City
subway train.  When Madeline spots a face across her that
belongs to a wanted criminal, she takes off after the man
despite the plea of her husband that she's off duty.  A far
more challenging nemesis is to greet her shortly thereafter
after Harry (Adrien Brody) kidnaps Frances Hannon (Laila
Robins) and buries her live body with about 24 hours of air in
a Poughkeepsie cemetery, ostensibly to demand ransom from
Frances's wealthy husband Clarke (James Naughton).  We
soon learn that money--not even one million dollars' worth of
it--is the psycho's real goal.  Harry is in it for the game.</P>
<P>   Recalling David Fincher's classic police drama "Seven," an
unsettling psychological drama about a serial killer out to
punish perps of the seven deadly sins, and that director's The
Game," which lacks his previous film's violence but makes up
for it in mean-spiritedness--Shepard's drama does not wallow
in human depravity.  Shepard chooses instead to exhibit
much of the perversion through the verbal interchange
between cop and killer.  The two prove to be in a way one of
a kind though not nearly in the same degree.  Part of the
story could well have been put on the stage as a deadly
dialogue while the remainder lends itself to the full cinematic
treatment--a car chase, a couple of burial scenes, a race with
a petty gunman.  The only scene that does not work involves
a stagy monologue by an FBI agent (Dylan Baker) about
what happens to a convicted murderer who is given a lethal
injection.  (That New York State, in which the crime has
taken place, has not performed an execution in decades and
is likely to sentence this psycho to a life term at best is
overlooked.)</P>
<P>   New York City looks good, from the moneyed streets that
finds Frances on an afternoon stroll with her dog to the
tunnels and byways around Grand Central Station, and
photographer Sarah Cawley's work is given a splendidly
spooky score by Rolfe Kent.  Adrien Brody, recently on the
cover of umpteen magazines, continues to be a rising star,
nicely playing a guy who is both charmer and monster, while
Maura Tierney is his match as a woman determined to rid
society of his evil without necessarily exorcising her own
inner demons.</P>
