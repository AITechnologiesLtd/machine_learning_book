<PRE>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 91</PRE>
<P>Has there ever been a film more lovely than
"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"?  Pretty faces,
voices, melodies and colors; it's a film where
tenement walls are painted bright green, and
ageless mothers are as lovely as their
daughters.  Only once is there a respite
from relentless beauty, when Guy shows up
for work in a dirty uniform.</P>
<P>The strength of "Cherbourg" comes from its
sets, its melodies, and its story.  But it
is known chiefly for its cinematic invention
of dialogue sung not spoken.  Its songs are
all derived from the dialogue between two
characters.  This might seem a gimmick if
the 'script' wasn't so revealing of character,
or if the Michel Legrand melodies weren't so
memorable.  But not even the most cynical
of observers can prevent from being swept
away by the film's brilliance.</P>
<P>The story is pure romance.  It begins in
France of 1957.  Guy (Nino Castelnuovo) is
a young auto mechanic who dreams of operating
his own gas station.  He lives with his sickly
Godmother (Mireille Perrey) who is nursed by
comely, gentle Madeleine (Ellen Farner).
Genevieve (Catherine Deneuve) is a young
woman who works in a financially failing
umbrella store owned by her mother (Anne Vernon).
Guy and Genevieve are lovers, but are parted
by his drafting into the war with Algeria.</P>
<P>(Some spoilers follow, which are needed in
order to better analyze the film.  You've probably
either already seen the film or never will,
but otherwise, at least now you've been warned.)</P>
<P>A final encounter with Guy leaves Genevieve
pregnant.  Her mother schemes to remedy the
situation by marrying her off to wealthy,
well-mannered diamond merchant Roland (Marc
Michel, reprising his character from director
Jacques Demy's earler film "Lola").  This comes
to pass.  Guy returns from the war, and after
some sulking makes the equally practical decision
of marrying loyal Madeleine.</P>
<P>A final, accidental encounter between Genevieve
and Guy is wistful but only confirms that both
have made the right decision.  That "Cherbourg"
begins with such an intense romance between the
leads, and ends with them as virtual strangers,
is as strong a commentary about the fleeting
nature of love as can be found in cinema.</P>
