<P>THE HI-LO COUNTRY (M).  
(Polygram/Palace)
Director: Stephen Frears

Running time: 129 minutes.</P>
<P>Although The Hi-Lo Country is set in the harsh, untamed cattle
country of New Mexico in the late 1940's, it quickly becomes obvious
that we are venturing into Sam Peckinpah territory here.  The Hi- Lo
Country explores many of those themes common to his movies - the death
of the old west and its values, and that strange code of loyalty that
exists between hard and violent men.</P>
<P>Peckinpah tried in vain for many years to bring Max Evans'
1961 novel to the screen.  Producers Martin Scorsese and Barbara De
Fina have succeeded where Peckinpah failed.  Walon Green (who wrote
The Wild Bunch, one of the all-time classic westerns and one of my
favourite films) has fashioned a grand, sweeping epic from Evans'
novel, although some elements are far less compelling than others.
Scorsese has brought aboard British director Stephen Frears (My
Beautiful Laundrette, etc), with whom he collaborated on the
marvellous noir-like thriller The Grifters.</P>
<P>An outsider, Frears directs the material with unusual
intelligence.  He doesn't romanticise the characters or the setting as
much as Peckinpah would have.  The film also lacks Peckinpah's
characteristic trade mark touches - the graphic violence and the
strong misogynistic streak.  Oliver Stapleton's glorious wide screen
cinematography beautifully brings to life the harsh open spaces of New
Mexico, imbuing the film with an almost epic quality.</P>
<P>Many young men, returning home from Europe following the war,
found the old cattle country had changed drastically during their
absence.  Many families facing hardship and financial ruin had been
forced to sell their farms to wealthy land barons.  Deprived of their
legacy, the young men were often forced to work for these wealthy
ranchers for wages.  Pete Calder (Billy Crudup, from Inventing The
Abbotts, etc) is one such returning soldier, who prefers to work his
own modest 1600 acres, with help from his friend Big Boy Matson (Woody
Harrelson).</P>
<P>Big Boy though is a tough, hard drinking cowboy of the old
school, an embodiment of the old west, who doesn't walk away from a
fight.  He courts trouble when he begins an increasingly public affair
with Mona (Patricia Arquette), the wife of Les Birk (John Diehl),
foreman for ruthless local rancher Jim Ed Love (Sam Elliott).  It's an
affair that can only end in violence and tragedy.</P>
<P>Crudup gives a solid performance as Pete, the laconic,
introspective narrator of this nostalgic tale.  Harrelson somehow
seems miscast here in a role that required an actor with a meaner,
rougher edge.  Arquette lends her sultry presence to the pivotal role
of Mona.</P>
<P>The Hi-Lo Country is best viewed as a poignant, elegiac homage
to both the classic western movies of yesteryear and, ultimately, the
late Peckinpah himself.</P>
