<PRE>MEET THE PARENTS</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Jay Roach
Written by: Greg Glienna, Mary Ruth Clarke, Jim Herzfeld, John Hamburg</P>
<P>Greg (Ben Stiller) is simply nuts about his girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo). In 
fact, he was planning on proposing to her until he learned he should ask her 
father, Jack's (Robert DeNiro) permission first. So, the two run off to meet 
the parents. Pam's mom, Dina (Blythe Danner), is a kind, pleasant natured 
woman. Jack, meanwhile, seems to be testing Greg all the time. He even goes 
so far as to hook Greg up to an antique polygraph machine. Nevertheless, 
Greg tries to make the best of things and make a good impression. He meets 
Pam's sister, Debbie (Nicole DeHuff), who is getting married in one day; 
Debbie's mother and father (James Rebhorn, Phyllis George), who take an 
immediate disliking to him; Pam's pothead brother, Denny (Jon Abrahams); and 
finally, in a moment of sheer cruelty, he's introduced to Pam's rich former 
fiancee, Kevin (Owen Wilson). Greg keeps trying to make a good impression, 
but things go from bad, to worse, to absolutely miserable in less than 24 
hours.</P>
<P>There's something strangely amusing about watching people completely 
humiliate themselves, isn't there? Something about watching a person do 
everything we know they shouldn't be doing to get out of already 
embarrassing situations. This is basically the only kind of humor you're 
going to find in "Meet the Parents", so if you're one of those rare people 
who doesn't find that sort of thing amusing, steer clear. Whenever I think 
of this sort of humor, one thing always leaps to mind. A British comedy 
series called "Fawlty Towers", in which John Cleese plays a stuck-up, 
priggish owner of a hotel who is always making himself look like a complete 
jerk. The difference between "Fawlty Towers" and "Meet the Parents" is that 
while Cleese's character deserves everything that happens to him, Stiller's 
character doesn't. Greg is such a likeable guy that it almost ruins the 
humor at times because you feel so sorry for him. If the roles had been 
reversed, and embarrassing things had been happening to Jack Byrnes, it 
might very well have been even funnier. Still, I can't rate a movie based on 
how I would have done things, and that's fine because taken on its own 
merits, "Meet the Parents" is a lot of fun.</P>
<P>"Meet the Parents" is carried entirely by the not inconsiderable comic 
talents of Stiller and DeNiro, but that's to be expected in a comedy like 
this. Having a large cast in a film of this sub-genre would ruin it, because 
you wouldn't get to know the characters' personalities as well. Stiller and 
DeNiro (particularly DeNiro) are obviously having a great time, and this 
carries over well to the audience. Stiller, who can go a bit overboard 
sometimes ("Mystery Men", anyone?), plays Greg as very likeable, but at the 
same time a little too eager to please (that's not an insult, the character 
should be played like that). DeNiro, on the other hand, has a great time 
hamming it up in a gleefully self-effacing performance. He's clearly making 
fun of himself, but he's having a grand time doing it. Blythe Danner ("Mad 
City") gives a pleasant performance as the good-natured mom, Dina. She's so 
nice in fact you can't help but wonder how on earth she hooked up with Jack. 
Teri Polo ("The Arrival") is a fairly talented actress, but she's horribly 
underused. Finally we have Owen Wilson ("Shanghai Noon"), turning up in an 
absolutely useless part as Pam's ex-fiancee. Wilson is a very entertaining 
comic actor, but he's given nothing to do in this pointless role.</P>
<P>If you're walking into "Meet the Parents" expecting another "There's 
Something About Mary", you're in for a disappointment. This isn't the kind 
of movie where you'll be laughing non-stop, it's a bit too sentimental for 
that. There are a lot of chuckles, and one or two massive laughs, but this 
one won't have you ready to pass out from laughing. Two of the absolute 
funniest scenes I can think of are the family's first dinner, and Greg's 
trip to the airport. The dinner scene is so funny because you have to 
sympathize with poor Greg, trying to make a good impression on his future 
mother and father in-law.Yet of course, as you knew was going to happen, 
everything goes horribly and hysterically wrong. The airport scene is great 
because anyone who has travelled has been there before. Greg deals with a 
stream of curt flight attendants who speak in uncaring, monotone voices, 
while they type a mile a minute on their computer consoles and inform him 
that he can't board the plane yet, because they're only seating aisles nine 
and up (he's in aisle eight, and there aren't any other passengers waiting 
to board the plane).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, there are a few things in the film that I didn't care for. 
First, the joke about Greg's name. It's Focker, and as Greg says, it's 
pronounced just how it looks. Now, when they first made fun of this, yes I 
laughed. I laughed the second time, and the third time, and I at least 
chuckled a bit by the fourth time. After about two dozen times making fun of 
his name, I was more than a little tired of it. Of course, that could just 
be me, because the rest of the audience laughed continuously at it. Second, 
a few of the characters are never developed in any way. While this wouldn't 
normally bother me, it does when the cast consists of only about eight 
actors. What bothers me even more is that one of the characters who is never 
developed is Pam. We know next to nothing about her by the end of the movie. 
Those few complaints aside, "Meet the Parents" is an entertaining, fairly 
light hearted movie (I say fairly because it does get a bit mean-spirited 
once or twice). It's a good way to spend a couple of hours, but don't expect 
much from it. The film runs a touch too long at 108 minutes. I'd recommend 
it to fans of Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro since both turn in highly 
entertaining performances, and I give the movie three and a half out of five 
stars.</P>
