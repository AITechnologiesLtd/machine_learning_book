<P>Tony Scott joins up with producer Jerry Bruckheimer for the fifth time,
after 1986's TOP GUN (7/10), 1987's BEVERLY HILLS COP II (6.5/10),
1990's DAYS OF THUNDER (6.5/10) & 1995's CRIMSON TIDE (7.5/10), and
takes on the new age of technological surveillance, with a solid cast
led by the ultimate big-ticket opener Will Smith and Gene Hackman.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Lawyer Robert Dean gets caught up in an elaborate chase, after someone
drops an extremely important piece of evidence on his person. The NSA
(National Security Agency) decides to take matters into their own
hands, and destroy Dean's credibility whilst bugging every part of his
life. They track him all across town, in an attempt to recapture the
proof, while former-NSA employee Brill, helps him along the way. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
The ultimate chase movie, this film offers us non-stop action, a decent
plot with a light touch, good acting, but does seem to run about half
an hour too long, and float into some repetitive waters once too often.
This movie starts off with a great premise and snowballing build-up,
and eventually gears into a kynetic two-hour chase via technologies
beyond anyone's imagination. Overall, I did like this movie, but did
find myself a little bored about halfway through the chasing, because
it all seemed like the same thing after a while. Having said that, the
film does offer a decent twist in its ending, and peps up its
jargon-filled dialogue with spurts of humour and cameos by James
Robards, Tom Sizemore (ballooning as we speak), David Byrne (who is
credited in the opening credits for some reason, but is really in the
film for only a few minutes) and the return of ex-Cosby kid Lisa Bonet
as the second tomato to Smith's wife in the movie.</P>
<P>On the acting side of things, Jon Voight is convincing as the head of a
department that's seriously lobbying to play "big brother" in America's
technological future. The rest of the bad guys are your standard fare,
with many of them sporting the same spiked, platinum haircuts, so that
nobody will detect them as a team (Good move, guys!). Gene Hackman
returns as a super-paranoid recluse fresh from the conclusion of his
role in 1974's THE CONVERSATION (6.5/10), in which he started of as a
surveillance expert, and eventually disintegrated into a total paranoid
fruitcake (Just a cool coincidence? I think not.) He is also quite good
in his role, and physically standardized as the "crazy, whacked-up guy"
as per his donning of the proverbial black rimmed glasses. Will Smith
was actually okay in his part, but seemed to have delivered most of his
funniest lines in the film's trailer. And lastly, Jason Lee of MALLRATS
(6/10) fame, pulls off another slick performance as the hip, young cat
who could swear with the best of them.</P>
<P>Director Scott also returns with many of his trademarks, as his
frenetic camera shots, five second edits, and overdone technical
mumbojumbo (How many times do we have to see the satellite dish
floating out in space, and the overhead camera shots of people being
chased...okay, Tony, we get it...they're cool shots, but let's move on
already!). He also made sure to have at least one wicked downpour near
the film's conclusion, as to solidify its presence in every one of his
films. All in all, the film is packed with energy and thrills, delivers
many decent performances, an intelligible plot with some obvious holes,
but does run on for about half and hour too long, and could get
repetitive at some points.  </P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Will Smith turned down a scolarship to MIT to pursue his singing
career. He is also known as the "Fresh Prince"- rap singer. Will also
helmed a successful 6-year sitcom on NBC called "The Fresh Prince of
Bel-Air." Despite being a millionaire by age eighteen, Smith was
nonetheless deeply indebted to the I.R.S. when he landed said sitcom.
He had spent a lot of money on a house, cars and jewelry. He stands
6"3.
Gene Hackman was over 30 years old when he finally decided to take his
chance at acting by enrolling at the Pasadena Playhouse in California.
Legend has it that Hackman and Dustin Hoffman were voted "least likely
to succeed". His complete name is Eugene Alden Hackman.
Three TRUE ROMANCE (9/10) references that I caught in this movie
included the derogatory word used to describe African Americans in both
films, being "eggplant". The Mexican standoff shootout that shows up in
both films, and the appearance of one Tom Sizemore, who played a much
skinnier cop in the former movie, while portraying a real slob of a mob
boss in this one.
Gabriel Byrne started acting at the age of 29 and he went to America
for the first time when he was 37. He is originally from Ireland. He
was married to actress Ellen Barkin from 1988 to 1993.
Jason Lee is also a professional skateboarder.</P>
