   According to Robert Duvall, who turns in a tour de force
performance as a dancing, shouting, hell-raising Pentecostal-
type preacher, Hollywood is generally afraid of making movies
with religious issues.  When such a picture does get a
released, the fundamentalist preacher fellas are either
patronized or ridiculed.  During the press conference following
a screening at the New York Film Festival, he might have
mentioned, as an example, Fredric March's depiction of the
William Jennings Bryan character in "Inherit the Wind," based
on the 1925 Scopes trial, in which the prosecuting attorney is
reduced to  babbling by the more rational Paul Muni,
succumbing to a heart attack after the trial.  In "The Apostle,"
by contrast, which is Robert Duvall's third directorial effort, the
director plays the role of preacher with such flair, such
authenticity, such downright dramatic impact, that we in the
audience are tempted to rise out of our seats and join the
congregation, whatever our religious convictions.
   Though religion appears to be its center, this story of an
individual who is a good person, however eccentric--who goes
bad for a spell and later restores his dignity and generosity--is
more about a man than about a creed.  Seldom does a movie
penetrate the soul of an individual in such depth, but Duvall
does exactly that, spending a solid two and one-half hours in
virtually every scene to gave his viewers a firm examination of
his every dimension.  He seems a bit different in each
vignette, experiencing a lifetime of a episodes in a short
period as he goes through his paces tending to a backwater
parish in the Louisiana bayous (actually filmed in that state's
Lafayette) which goes by the name Bayou Boutte.  Eulis
"Sonny" Dewey's whimsically erratic but essentially
conscientious and generous nature comes through in the very
opening scene in Texas where, driving with his mother
(played by singing legend June Carter Cash) he comes upon
a serious auto accident.  Hopping down a hill, he runs into a
mortally injured young man and, without regard to the victim's
creed or wishes, asks him to accept Jesus, whom he will
"soon meet."  Back at the ranch, however, things are not
going so well with his wife Jessie (Farrah Fawcett), who tires
of his absences and has taken up with a young minister,
Horace (Todd Allen).  Begging her not to ask for a divorce, he
gets drunk and, at a Little League game, clubs the boy friend
fatally in the head with a baseball bat.  Discarding his identity,
he flees Texas for the Louisiana bayou where he becomes
friendly with Rev. Blackwell (John Beasley), who left his
congregation because of health problems, and talks him into
helping re-create his church.  Working as a mechanic in a
garage owned by a radio announcer, he uses the free time he
is granted to advertise his new church, and slowly builds up a
sizable congregation of mostly black parishioners, who glory
in the man's dancing, shouting, and all-around enthusiasm.  
   You're in for a surprise if you think that a man in his
position leads a sedentary, relaxed life in a remote region,
inhabited by good-natured but essentially poorly-educated
people who take to gospel song and fire-and-brimstone
preaching like a terrier to a buried bone.  One day he raises a
voluntary crew of children to clean, paint, and assemble a
large sign for the old abandoned shack.  At another time, he
must fend off an attack by a racist provocateur (Billy Bob
Thornton) who, furious at the idea of an integrated house of
worship, is about to demolish the building with a bulldozer. 
He wins the hostile man over in a remarkable way.  At
another time he romances a southern belle, Toosie (Miranda
Richardson), who is separated from her husband and
fascinated by his company and distinct aura.
   Duvall excels not only in the movie's principal role but as its
director, building each scene skillfully on its preceding one
while welding a group of ordinary Louisiana citizens with a
cast of remarkable actors. Miranda Richardson has particular
merit, knowing just how to play a fascinating "date," mixing a
come-hither twinkle with a maybe-next-time prospect.  
   The picture is photographed in a straightforward way by
cameraman Barry Markowitz, featuring a soundtrack of
glorious gospel song, and allegedly has been pared down
with the use of a computer in Mr. Duvall's Virginia farmhouse. 
The picture is too long and could stand a shave, particularly
of Duvall's final sermon before his inevitable arrest for his
crime of passion.  Thirteen years in the making, this five
million dollar production is an obvious showcase for Duvall,
who will doubtless garner an Oscar nomination after the
picture is released--for that purpose--in L.A. this December, to
open nationally on January 30, 1988.  Not Rated.  Running
Time: 148 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
