<P>   Liberals say that if only we had more social programs, we
would need fewer prisons.  Conservatives hold that many
social programs are a waste of money and have no long-
lasting benefits.  If you look at Shane Meadows's debut
directorial effort for a full feature "TwentyFourSeven" as a
guide to her political views, you'll find indications that the
English helmer is playing both sides.  Meadows, whose
previous labors have been for the two short tilms, "Smalltime"
and "Where's the Money, Ronnie!" remains committed to the
offbeat, her current film winning awards at film festivals at
Venice, Toronto and Sundance.</P>
<P>   The title is British slang for working at a project around the
clock, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, a rather
generic term that could apply to almost anything but in this
case to the labor of a feisty guy who pledges himself to
working with disaffected youth.  Evoking memories of Danny
Flynn's undertaking in Jim Sheridan's "The Boxer,"
"TwentyFourSeven" features Alan Darcy (Bob Hoskins) as a
do-gooder who works in the English Midlands (Nottingham
and environs) toward bringing a sense of purpose to a gang
of teen wrecks--dopers and the like--who wander the
depressing housing projects without a single healthy
conviction.  Enlisting the financial aid of the town richnik, a
shadowy businessman named Ronnie Marsh (Frank Harper),
Alan signs up his reluctant targets by winning a bet with them
on the soccer field. He soon has a colorful group in his
charge including the most self-destructive Gadget (Justin
Brady), the overweight son of the financier who becomes
Alan's assistant manager, and others who are as
undisciplined as they are, in their way, charming.  To bond
the group further, he takes (again despite their reluctance) on
a trip car trip to Wales, where they fish, enjoy the spartan
scenery, and have a jolly old time.</P>
<P>   Back home, the boys get into their training with lust,
punching the bags, showing up regularly and on time, and
looking forward to their first competition against a team known
as the Stafforshire Terriers.  What happens in the ring when
one of Alan's disciples gets pummeled is both comical and
sad.  The result of some local mayhem results in permanent
changes in the lives of the boys and Alan as well.  In fact,
Meadows opens the picture with a view of Darcy many years
after his project, where he appears with a shaggy beard,
dazed and confused, until he is taken in by one of the old
gang.</P>
<P>   Meadows is so intent on conveying the atmosphere of the
dismal Midlands scene that he has had cinematographer
Ashley Rowe photograph the movie in black and white, a
good deal of the drama suffering from an overdose of
darkness.  At times it has the look of a 1920s silent film,
cracking at the edges, put together with krazy glue to save it
from disintegration.  All of this is meant to mirror the decay of
the neighborhood, of course, but the viewer cannot be blamed
for becoming weary watching these visuals and, to boot,
listening to occasionally indecipherable accents from 
Midlands to Cockney.  </P>
<P>   The principal merit of "TwentyFourSeven" is not in its
examination of a social program gone awry but in its
showcasing the talent of Bob Hoskins whose role embodies
both intensely personal moments and vigorous rah-rah
coaching.  His clumsiness and sentimentality are brought out
in the best scenes, his attempt to court an irresolute
shopkeeper (Jo Bell) and his turns around a ballroom floor
with his Auntie Iris (the noted character actress, Pamela
Cundell).</P>
