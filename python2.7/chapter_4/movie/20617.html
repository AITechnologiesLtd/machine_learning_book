<P>   I'd like a dollar for every time I've heard a woman
defensively say, "I'm not a feminist, but..." or a couple of
bucks for every man who intones, "I'm all for equal pay for
equal work, but..."  Look around.  It's hard to find people who
will come right and say that they're militant feminists.  What is
feminism anyway?  To try to pigeonhole the theory is like
trying to define "democrat," or "freedom," or "liberal" or
"conservative."  There's a broad range embraced by each of
these terms and perhaps no two conservatives and no two
liberals are exactly alike in their political convictions.  Nor are
any two feminists.</P>
<P>   With the startling, innovative movie "Romance," professed
feminist Catharine Breillat has given us a film quite a bit more
mature and developed than her innocuous "36 Fillette" eleven
years ago (about a 14-year-old who may or not give up her
virginity while on vacation with her parents).  One could
almost say that each time someone in the audience walks out
on it, the more effective the movie is.  Breillat's own take on
feminism is not so much the opposite of the views professed
by Andrew Dworkin in her book "Intercourse" as its converse. 
While Dworkin suggests that the sexual act is yet another
weapon of the male in his history of subjugating women,
Breillat is determined to show that women become
vanquished only when they put up with men who do NOT
give them what they want and need in the erotic arena.  Only
when a woman frees herself from dependence on timid,
restrained, traditional--in a word uncaring--men to satisfy
them can she find her sexual identity and become
transfigured.</P>
<P>   Whether the graphic portrayals of sexual organs in various
modes is essential to bringing out the film-maker's point or
whether the explicit displays or genitalia infuse the movie
primarily to increase profits is anybody's guess.  Breillat might
insist that scenes skirting the borders of hard-core porn are
indispensable to her view that the heroine's discovery of
sexuality must be confronted head-on.  Breillat's opening
scene of Marie (Caroline Ducey) in the virginal-white bedroom
of her lover Paul (Sagamore Stevenin), vividly conveys to us
the extent of her frustration.  Paul, a vain male model with no
small amount of hostility toward his long-term girl friend,
announces that he has lost his sexual desire for her and
refuses to give himself over to her sexual embrace.  Marie--
who will ultimately show the fury of Lorca's Yerma and the
wrath of Euripides' Medea--clings to Paul out of what she
considers her overreaching love for him, but one day
determines to experience sex in all of its sacred and profane
ramifications.  After a brief affair with the Italian Paolo (Rocco
Siffredi) in a bar and later with a bum on an apartment
stairwell, she becomes meaningfully involved with Robert
(Francois Berleand), the principal of a school in which she
teaches second grade.  Robert, who considers himself an
unattractive person of little wealth (despite his spacious
apartment and Jacuzzi), explains matter-of-factly that he's
had 10,000 women.  In his monologue he becomes the film-
makers mouthpiece, venturing subversive ideas: that women
are not at all afraid of the obscene, and that they would
easily yield to a stranger's advances while playing hard-to-get
with men who love them.</P>
<P>   "Romance," which appears to bear an ironic title
considering its detachment, nonetheless may embrace Ms.
Breillat's view that sex IS romance, not the chocolate and
flowers so conventionally associated with the feeling.  The
most verbally amusing scene occurs in Marie's classroom in
which the teacher metaphorically expresses her sexual views
to an obviously uncomprehending group of lovely 7-year-olds. 
Exhibiting less interest in conjugating verbs than in a more
physical type of conjugation, she announces in the lesson on
the term "to have" and on the copulative verb "to be" that
"you can be without having; you can have without being." 
Nor do I recall any other movie that so lovingly and patiently
shows an aroused woman being tied, handcuffed and gagged
by her man, the two becoming excited to a fever pitch without
a dollop of conventional sex.</P>
<P>   The image that sticks most to the mind is of a dream
sequence.  Marie envisions a scene in which women are
lying across bladeless guillotines, their upper bodies
separated from their lowers.  Kind men cater to the former
areas, while the luckier guys on the other end engage them
in raw sex.  A woman needs both.  Breillat appears to believe
that gentle, considerable men are a two francs a dozen. 
What women really lack are the other kind, and her movie will
probably inspire even more post-viewing discussion about its
ideas than about the quality of its story-telling.</P>
