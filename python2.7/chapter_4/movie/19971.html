<P>   Some time back Diogenes searched high and low in his
part of Greece, looking fruitlessly for an honest man.  If he
were alive today, he'd probably search another lifetime for a
middle-aged man who has never entertained a fantasy about
a relationship with a 20-year-old woman (or man, depending). 
For guys who live strictly in a fantasy world, there's nothing
like a solid movie for an awesome vicarious experience of
that specifically human fancy. "Guinevere" realizes the vision
better than any other film has done this year to date. 
"Guinevere," which is both written and debut-directed by
Audrey Wells ("The Truth About Cats and Dogs") is a
remarkable accomplishment, ministering to our need for a
mature film filled with humor and pathos.  The cast is a
crackerjack ensemble of actors with Stephen Rea as 40-
something bohemian photographer Connie Fitzpatrick and
Sarah Polley as Harper Sloane, his 20-year old lover and
devotee.  "Guinevere," a slickly-made yet incisively-drawn
portrait of a May-September romance, was a hit at last
January's Sundance Festival, featuring much higher
production values than the typical indie programmed in that
Utah showplace each year.</P>
<P>   Particularly appealing are the shades and nuances of
feeling experienced by the two principals, each of whom has
ambiguous feelings about the affiliation while both are
unquestionably gaining impressively from their connection. 
Essentially this is a story of a young woman just out of
college who is the oddball in her haute bourgeois family, has
no idea what she's good at or even whether she has
potential, and who is culled right out of her husk by an older
man who showers attention and enlightenment on her.  As
she transforms from a shy, antisocial individual who despite
her beauty may never have had a boy friend to a romantically
fulfilled and professionally competent human being, she is in
turning contributing a great deal of gratification to the roue
who has taken her in and given her a life.</P>
<P>   The affair begins as ruggedly good-looking wedding
photographer Connie Fitzpatrick (Stephen Rea) plies his
trade at the plush wedding of Harper's sister.  After spotting a
candid and particularly penetrating picture of herself, Harper
visits the photographer at his bohemian digs in a run-down
San Francisco neighborhood and is seduced by his
seemingly passive but obviously confident invitation to spend
the night.  Moving in with the man after experiencing the joys
of both the flesh and the mind, Harper is prodded to study
the field that interests her the most and is plied with books,
attention, and the company of Connie's artistic friends. 
Awkward at first (at one point she spills wine on a stack of
Connie photos but is told "That's OK, I've got another bottle"),
she soon develops all the grace of a assured, fulfilled woman.
By the end of the affair, both parties have obviously grown
emotionally, both delighting in each other's company and
riding out the inevitable periods of friction and rage.</P>
<P>   Audrey Wells excels in both direction and scripting,
especially in getting Harper to convey nuances of emotion by
simple frowns, pouts, and subtle twists of her necklace. 
Wells also jackets the film in a variety of moods, most striking
in the concluding moments when she converts Connie's
studio into a surreal vision of heavenly light.  The director
charges the movie with witty dialogue throughout, in one
showstopping scene presenting a knockout demonstration of
putdowns from the lips of Harper's mom, Deborah (Jean
Smart), who sharply and amusingly challenges the artist's
ability to relate to a mature, experienced woman.  (One
writer who was present at Sundance exclaimed that this
scene "brought the house down.")</P>
<P>   Wells peppers the story with the little gestures that mean
so much in turning what could have been yet another
romance into a compelling, believable story.  There's the
entirely hilarious rich mom played with pizazz by Jean Smart
who instructs the family not to bother asking for Harper's
opinions at the dinner table: "Don't bother her...she's digging
a hole in her bread."  There's the envious middle-aged guy
sitting at a table a few yards from Connie and Harper who
quickly gives a thumbs-up sign to the would-be Humbert
Humbert.  There's the bevy of women who have "graduated"
from Connie course, each spending two or three years with
the seductive photographer, each nicknamed Queen
Guinevere by the charming fellow.  </P>
<P>   The flaws are minor, virtually unnoticeable, none distracting
from the momentum of the story.  Harper, for example,
considers herself unfit for anything.  She is not sociable, she
has no interest in any craft and no intellectual pretensions. 
Yet we are told that she has been admitted to Harvard Law
School.  But who's worried?  We've been made privy to the
pain that lies beneath the surface of Connie's bonhomie and
the potential possessed by Harper that needs only a catalyst
to secure its release.  All insights are put over with a good
deal of humor and love making Guinevere a winning choice
for September movie mavens.</P>
