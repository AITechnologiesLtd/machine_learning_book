<PRE>To the Ends of the Earth (1948)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 57/100</PRE>
<P>Narcotics had been a taboo subject of the production code for years, ever
since Reefer Madness (1936) had unintentionally become a cult film
for pot smokers.  But To the Ends of the Earth not only tackled the
epidemic of worldwide opium smuggling, but portrayed the Treasury Department
detectives in such a positive light that they provided technical support.
Treasury commissioner Harry J. Anslinger even has a cameo appearance.</P>
<P>Always reliable and entertaining Dick Powell is the lead, playing federal
agent Michael Barrows.  Barrows is a family man who tends his rose gardens
in New York City.  But he is willing to drop everything at a moment's notice
to travel around the world, on the trail of opium smugglers.</P>
<P>The film is set during the mid-1930s.  Sinister, unseen Japanese
imperialists are behind the shipments.  Their scheme is to weaken the West
through drug dependency, to facilitate global conquest.  Powell follows the
trail through China, Egypt, and Cuba.  At each turn, he encounters two kinds
of people: helpful, courageous, honest government agents, and shady, greedy,
ruthless suspects who help produce or smuggle the opium.</P>
<P>To seeming innocents who keep appearing in the story are attractive Ann
Grant (Signe Hasso) and her young, orphaned, even more attractive ward, Shu
Pan Wu (Maylia).  Shu Pan Wu is in her late teens, but acts much younger,
like a sweet and friendly child.</P>
<P>Powell is a laconic derring-do hero, at one point climbing the side of a
cliff to reach suspected poppy fields.  His life is frequently in jeopardy,
but he remains unflappable.  He is completely comfortably in his
surroundings, no matter how exotic they may be.</P>
<P>He is also without hormones, which may be uncinematic but perhaps was
necessary to retain technical support from the feds.  This is the primary
difference between Barrows and James Bond: while the femmes may be fatale,
he never drops his chivalric guard.</P>
<P>Like in all good detective stories, solving one puzzle leads directly to
another.  The script and direction is crisp, and there is often some
suspense present.  The only real problem, then, is the credibility of the
characters and of the events themselves.  Certainly, opium smugglers would
go to the depths depicted to move their wares.  But the dramatic suicides
and omnipotent agents seem to be from a world unlike our own.</P>
