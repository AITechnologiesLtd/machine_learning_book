<PRE>Bold-faced Fun
Charlie's Angels</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Boy, this was a fun movie! Aside from a small lull in the third act, 
"Charlie's Angels" are simply devilishly hilarious. Don't be duped into 
thinking that "Bikinis and Karate" are all they have to offer. </P>
<P>I've also heard folks say, "It was stupid!" But, me thinks, they missed 
the point. Of course it's stupid! The filmmakers are having fun, poking 
fun, with fun music and fun action. And the plot isn't even half-bad 
(1/8 bad maybe, but 1/2 -- nahhh). Anyway, the first half of this film 
rocks, glides, boogies, in such unique style that I didn't even care 
about the plot. Actually, when the film begins tending a bit too closely 
to its detective story - that's when things slow down. </P>
<P>But, the beauty is in the ridiculous. As Weird Al says, "Dare to be 
stupid." </P>
<P>Opening off the clouds of the Columbia logo through the window of a 
plane, Drew Barrymore, cleverly disguised as LL Cool J, commands a 
powerful action sequence that grabs you from your seat and tosses you 
into a way-jamming, rip-roaring 10 minute, opening which I feared the 
film could never match on an excitement level. But I was wrong. </P>
<P>Tom Green's a cappella tormenting vocalization of, "Just call me Angel 
of the morning" eases us back into a gentler pace. The movie's tempo is 
set from there. </P>
<P>"The Matrix" meets Maxwell Smart or Smart Jack or Jack Benny or Benny 
Hill. High-tech cool action gets double-dipped in humor and then 
impacted with the tongue tightly into the cheek. </P>
<P>All three angels dress in undercover kimonos as the track rocks out 
"Turning Japanese ... I really think so" or playing the tuba and 
accordion dressed as Swedish barmaids. Barbie must have been envious. </P>
<P>Lucy Liu massages a suspect. He sighs, "You're very good with your 
hands, I could use somebody like you on my staff." She retorts, "My 
hands aren't going anywhere near your staff." You can expect more of 
this risque double entendre. </P>
<P>Later to the tune of Heart's "Barracuda" black-leather-clad Lucy Liu 
struts into a computer corporation where everyone is dressed in white. 
This wonderful contrast displays the film's bold and ballsy breakout 
attitude. </P>
<P>Cleavage touting Drew exhales, "I love cars" as she licks the steering 
wheel. It's ridiculous on purpose! Don't take it seriously folks, you'll 
miss out. Cameron Diaz talks to her current boyfriend on the cell as she 
trades kicks with the enemy. The enemy breaks her phone, an appalled 
Diaz cries, "Hey, I really like that guy!" </P>
<P>All act well (save for the Tom Green reprise), Sam Rockwell giving a 
great performance as Knox, the computer genius. Ten story high kudos are 
due to director McG for having the guts and charisma to put together a 
truly invigorating mix of satire and action. I loved it. </P>
<P>"Charlie's Angels" is an Indy car race that breaks from the circle. </P>
