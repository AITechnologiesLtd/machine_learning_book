<P>     I cannot help but think that Sean Penn, for the second film he
directed (after THE INDIAN RUNNER) was inspired by Claude Chabrol's
very good and quite well-known drama, THIS MAN MUST DIE (1970).  In the
French movie, a father sets out to find and kill the hit-and-run driver
who had killed his young son.</P>
<P>     In the Penn film, the seven-year-old daughter of Freddy Gale (Jack
Nicholson) and Mary (Anjelica Huston) was killed by drunk driver John
Booth (David Morse).  When John is released from jail after serving six
years, Freddy sets out to kill him.  When Freddy faces John and
something goes wrong with the gun, John asks for a two-day reprieve
during which Freddy can think if he really wants to shoot him. "I'll
give you three days" is the answer.</P>
<P>     Neatly balancing out vengeful Freddy is guilty John.  Not merely
sorrowful and contrite but carrying a colossal burden of guilt, one
that's spelled out and underlined at every turn, one that is in fact a
kind of death wish.  We get too much of the despair of both men,
especially since John always speaks haltingly in a low-pitched monotone
that's like a big whisper.  Even in the short run, this fatigues us, as
do as too many silences pregnant with meanings that are either
repetitious or unclear.</P>
<P>     The movie is interesting but relies too little on script and too
heavily on the excellent photography of a master, Hungarian-born Vilmos
Szigmond, and the moody production design of Daniel Haller, whose track
record is very good. (I wonder whether Californian Haller is related to
the late, classic cinematographer Ernest Haller who died in a 1970 car
accident).  Together, those two artists create an atmosphere of
somberness and emptiness, stress night scenes, artificial light,
chiaroscuro interiors and, even in daylight, the feel of loneliness.
On the other hand, the artsy editing and acting that go from the
theatrical to the "sub-texted" are less welcome.</P>
<P>     More than anything, the film leans very heavily on Jack
Nicholson.  The premise here is that Freddy, who owns a small jewelry
store, went to pieces after the child's death.  He is a man with an
attitude that includes impatience with the weaknesses of others,
harshness and irascibility.  All that goes with chain-smoking and major
boozing.  Freddy's milieu is one of strip-joints, like "Dreamland"
where his bed mates work.</P>
<P>     Nicholson can play convincingly lonely, alienated, weird,
pugnacious and raging characters.  So convincingly, indeed, that our
familiarity with the many faces of Jack may makes us conscious of
watching acting more than life.  Yet that's not the movie's weakest
point.  The flaw here is that as a writer, Sean Penn gets too fancy,
soulful, "philosophical" and sometimes tackily low-life.  More
seriously, it is never made clear whether Freddy's desire for revenge
is its own entity; whether it came upon him early on or recently;
which came first and caused the other, the drinking or the despair;
whether or not there is history of Freddy having always been unhinged.</P>
<P>     The main clue we get is when well into the film, in a dark cafe,
there's a "friendly" meeting of Freddy and his now remarried ex-wife
Mary (echoes of the real-life Nicholson-Huston relationship).  She
tells him "When Eve died you became small and weak.  I needed someone
big and strong."</P>
<P>     More of Penn's weaknesses.  John is in the car with a pal who's
found him a job and arranged for a party with several girls.  He
suddenly asks John: "In the joint, did you get violated?" (my
euphemism).  John: "It only hurts the first time."  This exchange is
followed by cross-cutting between the party (where a woman improbably
discourses on compassion) and a fancy restaurant where Freddy has
invited three hookers.  There is much that is unnecessary and
unedifying in those sequences.  And when Robin Wright, in the
underwritten part of Jojo, plays an improbably "nice" and "clean"
artist in a society of broads, and falls for John, and speaks of his
puppy-like eyes, writer Penn is combining cliches with an unlikely mix
of societal types.</P>
<P>     There are some good inventions.  The quiet relationship between
John and his parents; the talkative, deranged lady who speaks to John
in a bus; the surreal sight of a stripper dressed in a Shirley Temple
outfit and singing "The Good Ship Lollipop"; a hooker serenading John
at his place via song and electronic keyboard (she must be one of those
fallen girls from better society); the amicable Freddy-Mary meeting
mentioned earlier unexpectedly climaxing with Freddy exploding:" I hope
you die.  I hope you f...g die."</P>
<P>     THE CROSSING GUARD is a mixed picture until the closure which is a
total cop-out, illogical in topography and timing, with too many
coincidences, clich's and sentimentality, all embarrassing to watch.  A
pity, because in spite of several arid, dull stretches, the movie has
enough going for it to set it apart from run-of-the-mill productions.</P>
