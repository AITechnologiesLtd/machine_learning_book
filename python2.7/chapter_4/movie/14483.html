_Antz_ (PG) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>It's still another two months before DreamWorks launches its assault on
the current state of feature animation with the much-ballyhooed (and
equally as anticipated) _The_Prince_of_Egypt_, but in the meantime, the
crew at SKG has found another way to hit Disney where it hurts--in the
field of computer animation.  With the witty and wise _Antz_, DreamWorks
and PDI has given the Mouse and Pixar's upcoming _A_Bug's_Life_ a tough act
to follow.</P>
<P>The "z" in _Antz_ stands for Z (voice of Woody Allen), a lowly worker ant
who for once wants to do something for his individual needs rather than
those of the colony.  He gets a taste of something different when Princess
Bala (Sharon Stone), reluctantly betrothed to megalomaniacal General
Mandible (Gene Hackman) and bored with her sheltered life in general,
sneaks out and joins the commoners for one night, meeting Z at a bar (where
"aphid beers" are served).  Bala's ruse is soon discovered, but not before
Z has fallen head over heels in love.  Determined to break from his class
and win Bala's love in return, Z comes up with a scheme that, if anything,
will win Bala's attention.  Alas, he gets a lot more than he bargained for.</P>
<P>Like Disney's trailblazing _Toy_Story_, _Antz_ has a smart script that
will keep adults equally as entertained, if not more, as the young 'uns.
The screenplay by Todd Alcott, Chris Weitz, and Paul Weitz is a most
unlikely--and often hilarious--Communist allegory, with the oppressed
workers encouraged to "work for the good of the colony" and even forced to
dance the same way at the same time each day; Z's scheme inspires the
masses to revolt.  But beyond the social satire, a lot of the script's
creativity lies in its placing the audience in the ants' shoes, seeing
familiar things from the insects' eyes.  For example, simple trash can
brimming with litter is "Insectopia," a paradise of food and other delights
for all insects; and a single water droplet can spell a horrible death by
drowning.</P>
<P>The material really comes to life in the hands of the actors and the
animators at PDI.  The character of Z would be unthinkable without the
voice of Allen; freed from his physical form, his tired neurotic New Yorker
schtick is given a freshness.  The rest of the actors are also well-cast:
Sylvester Stallone is perfect fit for Z's musclehead soldier friend,
Weaver; Stone lends Princess Bala sexiness and spunk, as does Jennifer
Lopez to Z's worker friend Azteca; Hackman makes Mandible a hissable
villain; and Christopher Walken is an ideal foil as his right-hand ant,
Colonel Cutter.  Though the actors give the ants most of personality, the
animators fill in the blanks, coming up with a look for the ants that is at
once humanized (their faces are wonderfully expressive) yet distinctly
insect-like.  The artwork is consistently first rate, if a bit limited in
the big picture; most of the action takes place in the ant colony, which
means repeated use the same dingy dirt tunnel backgrounds.  However, some
visually dazzling scenes, such as a rather harrowing combat sequence
involving some menacing termites, more than compensate.</P>
<P>In recent months, many studios have tried to take a bite out of Disney's
stranglehold on the feature animation market--and failed.  If the
delightful _Antz_ is any indication of what is in the pipeline of
DreamWorks' traditional animation division, it may not be such a small
world after all.  (opens October 2)</P>
