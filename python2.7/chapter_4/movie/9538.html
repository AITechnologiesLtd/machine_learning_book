<P>         Director/Writer Mike Leigh (SECRETS AND LIES) brings us another
candid into the ordinary lives of ordinary people. This time we get a
look at two women who once roomed together in a London flat during
college. The film starts 6 years later when Annie (Lynda Steadman)
arrives to meet here old flat mate Hannah (Katrin Cartlidge of BREAKING
THE WAVES) whom she hasn't seen since graduation. The movie follows the
two women over a day and half since Annie has only a short time for her
visit. We meet the girls through a series of flashbacks and through
their encounters in their search to find Hannah a new place to live.
Bumping into familiar faces along the way we seem to piece the lives of
these two women together almost as much as they do on their journey.
Starting off awkwardly unsure of how to react to each other and ending
by being closer than they had ever been. The dialect is heavy and hard
to get used to at first but by the time the girls go apartment hunting I
found myself drawn into their mysterious past. Coincidence abounds and
sometimes feels preconceived but it's not too hard to believe that these
two women might just have that kind of luck.Jumping through many
emotional hoops along the way CAREER GIRLS is a mesmerizing glimpse into
Mike Leigh's characters. Katrin Cartlidge is especially wonderful in her
role bouncing quickly between sarcasm and sincerety. 2 ½ spots (out of
4)</P>
<P>Favorite Line: Hannah looking out an 8th story window over the city; "I
guess this is where you watch the class struggle from."   </P>
