<PRE>Stargate (1994)
* *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<PRE>CAPSULE: MST3K fans, rejoice!</PRE>
<P>I must be on a roll. In one week I've seen two flabbergastingly, tragically
stupid SF movies: SPECIES, and now, STARGATE. Too bad GODZILLA hasn't come
out yet.</P>
<P>The plot is worthy of at least a pat on the back. A geeky Egyptologist
(James Spader) is tapped to crack the code on an ancient machine which
appears to be some kind of gateway to other worlds. Sure enough, they get
the gate working. But instead of actually THINKING about the situation, the
filmmakers just dove right in and threw every cliche they could remember at
the story: a military man (Kurt Russell) is assigned to head up the
expedition to whatever's on the other side.</P>
<P>What's on the other side? You sitting down? Turns out the sun god Ra has
established his dominion there, and commands giant power (which we all know
as technology of course, but tell that to his zillions of
worshippers/slaves). It's like a grotesque Hollywood version of Church of
the SubGenius dogma ("JEHOVAH IS AN ALIEN, AND IS STILL THREATENING THIS
PLANET!"), only with no sense of humor. Ra is played by Jaye Davidson and
actually fits the part physically, although he's saddled with having his
voice digitally mangled in post. It's only a matter of time before we get
guns, mayhem, uprisings, and a giant LED timer on an atomic bomb. Sheesh.</P>
<P>It amazes me -- really amazes me beyond language -- how much energy went
into a movie this vapid. The effects are seamless. The crowds and sets are
convincingly put together and filmed. But somehow, all that energy managed
to not be directed into writing and assembling a compelling, *interesting*
story about all this stuff. It wouldn't even have to be Oscar-level material
-- just something smarter, more knowing and maye even more curious about
what's out there than something which has the body of a STAR WARS remake and
the mind of a direct-to-video throwaway.</P>
<P>STARGATE is almost certainly written in homage to all those '50s pulp SF
movies where the Scientist and the Military Man lock horns over the Alien
Menace. "We need to understand them!" and "Blow them out of the sky!" are
usually the lines of dialog that get stuffewd into the character's mouths in
a movie like this, but we're not even allowed that luxury in STARGATE. The
movie plays less like homage (think of STRANGE INVADERS or the 1981 FLASH
GORDON for a better example of that) and more like, well, a clone. It's not
a send-up of bad movies -- it IS just a bad movie. Albeit louder and more
