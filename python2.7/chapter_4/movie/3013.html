<PRE>                                 HOOP DREAMS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Featuring:  William Gates, Arthur Agee.
A documentary by Steve James, Peter Gilbert and Fred Marx.</P>
<P>     It's pretty rare when a documentary gets a theatrical release.
It's even more rare, about as frequent as Sonny and Cher reunions, when
documentaries end up playing in multiplexes.  But sure enough, I
checked my local theater listings to discover that HOOP DREAMS was
playing not at one of the local "art houses," but at the sixteen screen
multiplex.  If it means that more people will see this exceptional
film, I'm all for it.  HOOP DREAMS is not just a film about basketball;
it is about as insightful a film about the American inner city
experience as you will find, with more drama than a dozen fiction
films.</P>
<P>     HOOP DREAMS opens in 1987, introducing us to two 14-year-old
basketball prospects from the schoolyards of Chicago, William Gates and
Arthur Agee.  Both are being recruited to play for St. Joseph's, a
private Catholic prep school far from their homes in the inner city, by
coach Gene Pingatore, and both decide to attend.  William, the more
talented of the two, plays immediately for the varsity, while Arthur
struggles on the freshman team.  When a tuition increase the next year
threatens both boys' ability to attend St.  Joseph's, William receives
a scholarship from a school booster, while Arthur is forced to leave
St. Joseph's and enroll in a public school.  The film then follows
William and Arthur through their senior years, examining their fortunes
on and off the court as they pursue their dream of making it to the
NBA.</P>
<P>     Part of the tremendous appeal of HOOP DREAMS comes from the
fascinating cast of characters to which we are introduced.  There is
Coach Pingatore, an intense disciplinarian who reduces his players to
cogs in a machine with his comment that "another one walks out the
door, another one walks in the door; that's what it's all about." There
is William's older brother Curtis, himself a former high school
basketball star who didn't make it, and who has transferred all his
dreams to William.  And there is Bo Agee, Arthur's troubled father, who
battles a drug addiction and his tendency towards violence.  Along with
William and Arthur, we follow these individuals for nearly five years,
and develop an intense interest in their lives.</P>
<P>     But for all its impressive scope, HOOP DREAMS would not have
worked had it only been about kids playing basketball.  In a broader
sense, HOOP DREAMS is really about a world in which young black males
believe that their only chance to get out is to succeed in athletics.
A key figure in this theme appears only briefly in person:  Isiah
Thomas, a former star at St. Joseph's who has gone on to NBA stardom.
Thomas is omnipresent, in his retired high school jersey, in press
clippings, in the comparisons made between him and William Gates.  He
becomes the idol for these two boys, but the result of their obsession
with basketball is academic troubles for both.  It is the same
obsession behind Curtis' intense desire to see William succeed as a
proxy for him, and similarly for Bo's desire to see Arthur succeed.  In
one telling scene, William tries to tell his girlfriend that his only
chance to go to college is basketball; she responds that she is going
to college herself, without any help from basketball, and raising a
daughter.  But the boys don't seem convinced that academics can be a
way out, and so they find themselves part of a money game played by
college and high school coaches alike.</P>
<P>     HOOP DREAMS is thought-provoking, but it is also entertaining.
There are several tense game sequences, and a run towards a possible
state championship by one of the boys in his senior year; there is the
drama of watching William attempt to recover from a potentially
career-threatening knee injury.  In one extremely satisfying scene late
in the film, a graduating William tells Coach Pingatore that he wants
to study communication "so that when someone asks me for money, I'll
know the right way to tell them no."  And there are wrenching moments
like Arthur's mother decorating his 18th birthday cake while explaining
that it's reason to celebrate because "he made it to 18, and he's
alive."</P>
<P>     The Academy Awards have been notorious for overlooking
documentaries which garner tremendous public acclaim.  Overlooking HOOP
DREAMS would be criminal.  It is not simply a great documentary; it is
one of the best films of any kind you will see this year.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 last-second shots:  10.</PRE>
