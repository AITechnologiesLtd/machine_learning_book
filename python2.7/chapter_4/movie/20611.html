Susan Granger's review of "BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS" (Buena Vista Pictures)</P>
<P>   Writer/director Alan Rudolph has attempted to make a deep,
dark comedy out of Kurt Vonnegut's satiric '70s fable - and has failed
to such an extent that it's an embarrassment for all concerned. Bruce
Willis plays a suicidal car dealer, Dwayne Hoover, a minor celebrity
in Midland City since his commercials seem to play non-stop on local
television. His pill-popping wife (Barbara Hersey) is clinically
depressed, and his gay son (Lukas Haas) is an aspiring lounge singer.
Is that why Dwayne thinks he's losing his mind? We're not really
sure. Meanwhile, his devoted secretary (Glenne Headley) doubles as his
hot-to-trot mistress and his sales manager (Nick Nolte) is a troubled
transvestite. (Nick's legs do look sensational in sheer black
stockings!)  Plus there's a pollution scandal. In the midst of this
muddled mess, the town decides to honor a mumbling, misunderstood
pulpy science-fiction writer named Kilgore Trout (Albert Finney) at
its first arts festival. "Midland City is ready for a renaissance, and
you shall be our Leonardo," gushes his sponsor. Predictably, when
Dwayne Hoover meets Kilgore Trout (Kurt Vonnegut's alter ego), he
discovers the meaning of life and achieves some kind of bewildering
redemption. Appropriately, the '50s ballad "Stranger in Paradise" is
an integral part of the soundtrack, repeatedly underscoring the
bizarre caricatures and surreal situation. Like Terry Gilliam's
adaptation of Hunter Thompson's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," Alan
Rudolph's attempt to dramatize Vonnegut's zany '60s protest fantasy
seems distorted and woefully out of date. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "Breakfast of Champions" is a crude, crass, incoherent 2.
Flaky, tasteless breakfasts like this could lead to indigestion!</P>
