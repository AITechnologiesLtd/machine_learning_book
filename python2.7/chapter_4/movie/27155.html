 Director: Robert Zemeckis
 Writer:  William Broyles Jr.
 Cast: Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt, Lari White, Nick Sarcy,
Viveka Davis</PRE>
<P>   Everyone who took American Lit. 101 knows that Ralph
Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau advised us to be
self-reliant and to simplify, respectively.  If they were alive
today, instead of looking at their own statues they would be
building one to Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), who took their
philosophies to a logical conclusion, however involuntarily.  In
a picture featuring Don Burgess's gorgeous cinematography
the qualities of which are duplicated this year only by Peter
Pau ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"); a virtual one-man,
tour de force performance by Tom Hanks (who may be on
the road to appropriating yet another Oscar); and a nicely
toned-down appearance by Helen Hunt as Chuck Noland's
girl friend, Kelly Frears--Robert Zemeckis scores big with a
grand show that in some ways resembles his 1994 opus
"Forrest Gump."  Both "Gump" and "Cast Away" deal with
internal voyages taken by their principal characters, but this
time around Zemeckis hones in on scripter William Broyles
Jr.'s intelligent, rapid-fire, cutting-edge FedEx executive who
may be able to grasp a lot more about the world's reality than
Gump ever could but who, like the mentally challenged hero
of the 1994 film, has been so distracted that he has lost track
of what is really important in life.</P>
<P>   "Cast Away" has quite a bit going for it, qualities that make
the movie an original.  1) Cameraman Burgess has
photographed what is possibly the most agonizing minutes of
an aircraft in trouble yet filmed, a shattering experience that
guarantees the movie's absence on any airline company's
agenda. 2) Burgess ably contrasts the use of a static camera
when capturing the inertness of an uninhabited island in the
South Pacific with a hand-held camera to capture the frenzy
of an executive giving a staccato lecture to a group of
Moscovites who have just been employed by Federal
Express. (As product placements go, this movie does for
FedEx as "What Women Want" does for Nike.)  3) Those in
the audience who are travelers will catch the ironies of a
highly-strung corporate honcho placed in the most languid
situation possible, and the concept of what could be an
unspoiled tropical island ripe for tourism by the very rich
which is instead the equivalent of solitary confinement on
Devil's Island.</P>
<P>   Carefully developing his character from the start, Zemeckis
makes sure that his final scene will be emotionally draining
on the audience, a heartfelt, heartbreaking conclusion to a
story dense with both allegorical and realistic meaning. 
Chuck Noland is giving a swift lecture to a group of new
FedEx employees in Moscow, people who perhaps were
heretofore laid-back souls casually putting in their time under
a Communist government but now challenged to beat the
clock if they want to keep their well-paid gigs.  Though not
holding the employees to the FedEx American standard, a
guarantee that the package sent tonight will be received at its
domestic destination by 10:30 the next morning, he insists
that the crew be aware of the clock at every moment.  On the
way home to spend the Christmas holidays with his girl friend
Kelly, his aircraft develops trouble and goes down into the
waters of the South Pacific, killing all but Chuck--who at first
is confident of rescue until he later realizes that his search
party would have to comb an area larger than the size of
Texas to locate him.  </P>
<P>   A long stretch in the middle part of the film shows this
modern Robinson Crusoe adapting himself to the needs of
physical survival which, once attained, allows him to turn to
his spiritual side or, to put simply, to find a way to keep his
sanity with no one but a volleyball which he appropriately
names Wilson to hear his conversation.   Four years later--
that's four YEARS later--he returns to his Memphis home
amazed at the ease with which he could pick up food on a
buffet groaning board and create a flame at the flick of a
switch.  For some moments we wonder whether Chuck has
fallen in love with the extreme hardships he had to face and
is ready, like Werner Herzog's Kasper Hauser, to return to
the primitive life on his massive Walden Pond.  Reappearing
to his girl friend who had given him up for dead years earlier,
Chuck arrives at a literal and metaphoric crossroads.  He is
ready to begin life anew.</P>
<P>   It would not be a great leap to look at "Cast Away" as not
only a contemporary "Robinson Crusoe" or even "Everyman"
tale but as a speedup account of the world at the time of the
Flintstones.  Arriving on a island seemingly bare of birds,
insects, or tools, Chuck learns how to make a primitive knife
out of a couple of stones and how to get milk and meat from
some coconuts that do everything in their power to resist his
desire to crack them open.  Equipped at least with the
teaching of civilization unknown to prehistoric man, he does
not take long in discovering how to light a fire without
matches and keep it burning; how to vary his coconut diet
with crustaceans and the fruits of the sea; how to built a raft
that might keep him moving toward civilization despite the
resistance of nature; even how to invent art to keep him
occupied when the bare essentials of survival are guaranteed
(he paints a face on the volleyball with his own blood). 
Primitive man creates art.</P>
<P>   If Ed Harris gained 30 or 40 pounds for his role as the
disspated title character in the movie "Pollock," then Tom
Hanks had the more difficult role of losing 55 pounds over the
sixteen months' period that Zemeckis gave him while that
director proceeded to make another film in the interim.  When
you gaze at this legendary actor looking trim and fit--
presumably the result of keeping as active as a cave dweller
hunting for food and having no pies, cakes or even bagels to
help develop a spare tire--you may wonder as well whether
you should forget about Club Med this year and go on your
own to one of the few pieces of land in the world not already
developed by Marriott or Hilton or Intercontinental.  Critic Rex
Reed, in a love-letter of a review, stated that he spent part of
the picture crying, the other part shutting his eyes from the
impact of Noland's journey.  While I had to look away only
when Noland proceeded to knock out an infected tooth with
the use of a stone and the blades of an ice skate that
washed ashore in a FedEx package, I'd have to admit that
while Zemeckis' picture stretches the narrative form to its limit
given the long period that Hanks performs monologues to his
volleyball, the nearly two and one-half hours went by in a
flash.  "What's beautiful about the world is the world itself,"
said a grandmother in a greeting card to a young member of
her family.  Paradoxically the beauty of nature captured in
this unusual and remarkable film is the very power that can
kill or at the very least drive one insane.  </P>
