<P>        Although generally thought of as the sweetly romantic type,
Meg Ryan has actually done an impressive amount of dramatic stretching
throughout her career. Those who know her only from hits such as
``When Harry Met Sally'' and ``Sleepless in Seattle'' might not
suspect she's also played an Irish asylum inmate (in ``Restoration''),
a tattooed teen-aged hellraiser (``Promised Land''), and, in her
sharpest performance to date, an alcoholic mother in ``When A Man
Loves A Woman.''</P>
<P>  Ryan is back on the edge in ``Addicted To Love,'' although
you'd never guess it from the film's adorable poster, which shows her,
Matthew Broderick, Tcheky Karyo and Kelly Preston cuddling and
grinning. It looks like a typical box of Hollywood candy, but
``Addicted To Love'' is full of baker's chocolate.</P>
<P>  Ryan is cast as a borderline psychotic named Maggie for whom
love means never having to cry ``uncle.'' Wearing a battered bomber
jacket, aviator goggles, a knowing sneer, and eyeshadow that might
have been applied with a pushbroom, she's the perfect Greenwich
Village vision of a woman scorned.  Cuddling and grinning are not on
her agenda.</P>
<P>  Jilted by her elitist French fiance Anton (Karyo), Maggie
vows to strip him of his dignity. ``When I'm done with him, he'll be a
twitching stain on the floor,'' she tells her timid partner Sam
(Broderick). Sam, a moony astronomer, has hooked up with Maggie
because his dreamy former girlfriend Linda (Preston) is now living
with Anton.</P>
<P>  Setting up shop in the collapsing hovel across the street,
Sam has trained a camera obscura on Linda and Anton's apartment. When
they're not concocting bizarre revenge schemes, involving
lipstick-wearing monkeys and children with perfume-filled squirt guns,
Sam and Maggie are couch potatoes, spellbound by the cinema-verite
sitcom of their ex-lovers' lives.</P>
<P>  ``Addicted To Love'' was directed by Griffin Dunne, star of
Martin Scorsese's harrowing 1985 comedy ``After Hours,'' the story of
an extraordinarily unlucky yuppie trying to survive a night in New
York.  ``Addicted'' is similarly dark. Fans who loved Ryan's
milquetoast persona in ``I.Q.'' and ``French Kiss'' may slip into
shock when they hear Maggie tell the story of her father's unnatural
devotion to his aging dog.</P>
<P>  While it's consistently amusing, the movie falls just short
of blossoming into a genuinely twisted tale. Screenwriter Robert
Gordon develops popsicle toes in the last act, slightly diluting his
astringent humor.</P>
<P>  Karyo, best known for playing stolid types in art-house hits
such as ``La Femme Nikita'' (1991), displays a surprising gift for
physical farce and manages the English language with finesse. ``Why
would I have sex with a hamburger when I can make love to a steak?''
he tells a suspicious Linda, trying to assure her he's not unfaithful.</P>
<P>  Sam may be a bit on the sappy side, but Broderick finds the
guy's naive charm. His understated style blends nicely with Ryan's
edgy chutzpah, and kudos to whoever put Ryan in those tie-dyed
dresses: They definitely become her. Of course, the downside of
Maggie's charisma is that it throws the story's logic out of whack,
making one wonder why Sam is pining away for the wan, colorless Linda
across the street when he's got someone much more exciting in the
house.</P>
