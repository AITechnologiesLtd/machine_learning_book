<P>When I first saw Quiz Show I was reminded of such films like All the 
President's Men or The Paper. Although this film does not have anything 
to do with journalism it does involve a man on a quest in search for the 
truth. But in all three cases the reason to bring out the truth is 
questioned. Who is really the one who will get hurt and is it worth it? 
This is the question that is raised, among others, in this highly 
entertaining film about the true story of the much publicized game show 
scandal in the late 1950's. But what makes Quiz Show a great film is 
that it examines a time in the history of America that has been seen as 
innocent but is actually the end of an era where intelligence was looked 
upon as an asset. Now people become famous as a result of their actions 
no matter how idiotic.</P>
<P>Quiz show is set in a time that I only knew about from reading about or 
watching other films set in that era. It came across not only as a 
pleasant time but also one where issues like racism did not exist and 
people respected one another. But we can see that very little has 
changed since then even though we would like to think that we have come 
a long way. Human nature is still the same with greed and materialism 
present in all of us.</P>
<P>The story begins with an obnoxious working class Jew named Herbert 
Stempel (John Turturro) who has made a name for himself with his 
remarkable winning streak on a popular game show called "Twenty-One". 
Through his success he has gained fame and fortune but the producers 
find that ratings are declining and they believe it is because of him. 
Due to the declining ratings, the producers, Dan Enright (David Paymer) 
and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria), set out to find a new "money maker". 
They find it in Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) a handsome university 
professor from one of America's most prominent intellectual families. 
With the producers convinced that they have found their new "golden 
boy", they persuade Herbert Stempel to take a dive only because they put 
it in his mind that he has a future in television. In one of the films 
most dramatic and tense scenes, we begin to see the extreme pressure the 
contestants as well as the producers are under. (There is a great shot 
where you actually feel like your are in the small claustrophobic booth 
where each contestant is contained.) But Herbert soon realizes that 
television will never be a part of his future and thus jealous of the 
fame and wealth acquired by Van Doren, the same fame and wealth he once 
had, Herbert begins to loosen his tongue about the real truth behind 
"Twenty-One". This attracts the attention of a young lawyer from 
Washington named Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow) who begins to investigate the 
rigged game show and eventually takes on television, a battle we find 
out, he can not possibly win.</P>
<P>Quiz Show has many strong points but a particular one are the strong 
performances that can all be described in one word, perfect. However, 
John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes are the particular standouts among this 
great cast. We view both characters as society did with Herbert Stempel 
(John Turturro) being the nerdy working-class Jew and Charles Van Doren 
(Ralph Fiennes) being the successful good-looking young intellectual. 
Superficially, both characters are the exact opposite of one another but 
in actuality they are both morally weak and strive to be something they 
aren't. But in reality they both chose the same path of living a lie, a 
lie no one thought was hurting anyone. Both need to be something greater 
than what they were and being contestants on "Twenty-One" gave them that 
chance. Yet, these characters are not evil which is exactly how the 
media presented them. The true villains in this film are the Networks 
and the sponsors, specifically NBC and Geritol. But both, though making 
huge profits from contestants like Charles Van Doren, were seen as 
victims all the time knowing exactly what was going on. There is an 
interesting cameo from Martin Scorcese who plays the president of 
Geritol who knows exactly how everything will turn out. He has the 
answers Dick Goodwin is looking for but he also knows he doesn't have to 
tell him anything because like he said "the networks will go on and so 
will Geritol". It is they who profited from people like Charles Van 
Doren but they were not the ones who were labeled criminals. They simply 
offered them fame and fortune and the contestants accepted.</P>
<P>Also, much of my admiration goes toward Robert Redford as well. Ever 
since Ordinary People he has time and time again proven himself one of 
the best directors working today. He, unlike many other directors, gives 
us something to watch that is entertaining as well as interesting. He 
brings us back to a time in America that most people had forgotten. The 
questions he raises throughout the course of the film keep us involved 
in the story as we try our hardest to answer them. Through his direction 
we get an extremely interesting look at society's values at the time and 
how much they have changed. In what could have turned out to be an 
embarrassment actually became the best film of 1994 as well as one of my 
favourites.</P>
<P>Most importantly though, "Quiz show" is not simply about rigged quiz 
shows it is about a time in history when America lost its innocence. It 
portrays a time in America when greed took over and knowledge was no 
longer something to strive for. Some people may even think that greed 
has always existed and will continue to exist. It is a very cynical view 
about our society and where it is heading but if modern society bares 
any proof there has been a dramatic change and whether that change is 
for the better or the worse is up for the viewer to decide.</P>
