<P> The Insider (1999) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Russell Crowe, Al Pacino
and Christopher Plummer. Written by Michael Mann and Eric Roth. Directed by
Mann.</P>
<P> I have a problem with movies based on fact that offer disclaimers saying
parts of the story are fictitious dramatizations of actual events.</P>
<P> Which parts? What should I believe and what should I consider as a
screenwriter's fertile imagination?</P>
<P> These questions gnaw at me as I reflect on "The Insider," a suspenseful
drama about a tobacco executive who blew the whistle on the industry,
revealing its dirty big secret - that its executives always have been aware
that the nicotine in their cigarettes is addictive.</P>
<P> But "The Insider" is so much more. It's a story of courage, idealism, ego
and corporate cowardice.</P>
<P> It is understandable why CBS officials are criticizing the movie. The
network, specifically "60 Minutes" creator Don Hewitt, are portrayed as
waffling individuals, caving in to the corporate lawyers who call the
behind-the-scene shots.</P>
<P> As a whole, lawyers come off very poorly here, whether representing CBS or
the tobacco interests. "The Insider" could spark a renaissance in lawyer
jokes.</P>
<P> Another institution receiving an unflattering portrayal is 60 Minutes
newsman Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer), who is conceived as
egotistical, pompous and self-serving.</P>
<P> The hero of "The Insider" is Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), the
former Brown & Williamson vice president who went public.</P>
<P> Wigand, like all true heroes, is a conflicted and flawed individual. He
weighs doing what he knows is right against an uncertain future. Wigand
risks the financial security of his family by violating the confidentiality
agreement he signed upon his termination.</P>
<P> It is Wigand who first approaches - anonymously - Lowell Bergman (Al
Pacino), a producer for 60 Minutes, by sending him a packet of data
concerning the tobacco industry.</P>
<P> It is mesmerizing to watch the cat-and-mouse game played by Wigand and
Bergman. Wigand wants to unburden himself, yet he remains reticent around
Bergman, continually questioning his motives. He pushes Bergman away while
simultaneously enticing him with hints about what he knows.</P>
<P> At the same time, Wigand begins to receive threats. The phone rings at odd
hours, but no one is on the other end. He finds a bullet in his mail box
and believes he is under surveillance. Is this real or paranoia? "The
Insider" proffers the perspective that, yes, the tobacco interests are
keeping an eye on this former top official and are using coercion to force
him to maintain his silence.</P>
<P> But you never know for sure. The FBI believes Wigand himself placed the
bullet in his mail box. So, who to believe?</P>
<P> "The Insider" changes focus once Wigand goes public and films his "60
Minutes" interview with Wallace.</P>
<P> Director Michael Mann, who co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Roth (adapted
screenplay Oscar-winner for "Forrest Gump"), begins to concentrate on the
infighting at CBS over the airing of the Wigand piece.</P>
<P> And while all this behind-the-scenes activity is interesting, it lacks the
human drama of Wigand's dilemma.</P>
<P> Wigand, reduced to teaching chemistry at a high school in Kentucky,
becomes the focus of a smear campaign contrived by the tobacco interests.
His past is combed, and he is accused of being a wife beater, an alcoholic
and a crook.</P>
<P> But instead of concentrating on Wigand's situation, we watch the raging
debate between the CBS news people and its corporate lawyers over airing
the Wigand interview. It ends with Bergman being overruled and an alternate
version of the segment aired minus Wigand's testimony.</P>
<P> The last section of "The Insider" focuses on Bergman's attempts to
exonerate Wigand and get his "60 Minutes" segment aired.</P>
<P> "The Insider" is compelling and very interesting. Despite the big issues,
Mann has created a very intimate film. Much of it is shot in close-up -
with generous dollops of extreme close-ups so we are forced to become
intimate with the characters.</P>
<P> Crowe is superb as Wigand. Wisely, he does not make his crusader a knight
in shining armor. Crowe re-creates an individual coping with extraordinary
circumstances. He doesn't hide Wigand's drinking, his vanity, his emotional
confusion. Crowe's eyes show a man trapped under a spotlight he wishes to
avoid.</P>
<P> Crowe's Wigand is a decent man doing what is right while at the same time
regretting his actions.</P>
<P> Pacino's Bergman is the idealist, a former radical journalist hired by "60
Minutes" to uncover the big lies and air the hard-hitting stories. Bergman
continually says he is a man of his word who has never betrayed a source.</P>
<P> But Bergman also is a seducer. He knows what to say to Wigand and how to
say it. He plays Jiminy Cricket to Wigand, telling him it's his duty to
humanity to go public.</P>
<P> Pacino recently, in films such as "The Devil's Advocate," has a tendency
to be very broad. In "The Insider" he is a bit restrained but does have
some moments of theatricality in which he is more Pacino than Bergman.</P>
<P> If Crowe has inhabited Wigand, then Pacino has merely scouted out Bergman.
Plummer is smooth as Mike Wallace. The real Wallace, of course, has taken
umbrage with this portrayal of himself as a man concerned more with his
legacy than with revealing the truth. Plummer's Wallace seems to go with
the flow. He appears as adept at office politics as he does at interviewing
a terrorist or a whistleblower.</P>
<P> In the end, of course, the original "60 Minutes" interview with Wigand is
aired. History - still being written - tells us what havoc this has created
within the tobacco industry.</P>
<P> But is "The Insider" history? It's high docu-drama wrapped around a
skeleton of facts. It's fascinating and holds your attention for its entire
two hours and 38 minutes. But as you watch, you have to cipher history from
Hollywood. Does it make a difference? Will it affect the movie's impact? In
the short term, no. But 20, 30 or 40 years from now, who can tell?</P>
<P> Today, when people think of the Apollo 13 mission, do they picture Jim
Lovell or Tom Hanks?</P>
