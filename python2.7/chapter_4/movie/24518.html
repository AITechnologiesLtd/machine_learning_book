<P>   Sometimes a movie is not what you expect it to be,
embracing ultimately a deeper theme than the obvious one. 
A recent example is "Frequency," billed as a sci-fi feature
dealing with a man's reaching back thirty years into the past
via a ham radio he discovers gathering dust in the closet. 
"Frequency" is, to be sure, a science fiction picture about
time travel but its real aim is to pay homage to the love
between a father and his son.  Now, "The Ballad of Ramblin'
Jack," a documentary that was awarded a Special Jury Prize
at the Sundance Festival this year, is about a major American
folk singer who could not abide the New York City of his birth
but preferred the wide open spaces of the West and South. 
But its real subject is the relationship of a father and his
daughter, the latter appearing behind the camera as the
director who, unseen, is interviewing her dad but has never
been able to know the man.  Do we get to know Jack Elliott
more after seeing this movie?  You bet.  Does his daughter? 
Ironically, no, at least not in the way she has spent her life
trying to understand him.  If you keep this point in mind while
you watch the movie, you'll be rewarded with just a little extra
appreciation for its considerable merits.</P>
<P>   Edited down from 200 hours of film, largely family archival
material taken on Super 8, 16mm and digital video and
transferred digitally to 35mm, "The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack"
takes us into the vivid and colorful world of its title character
who was born Elliott Adnopoz in 1931, the son of a Jewish
doctor on Brooklyn's Linden Boulevard.  Not content with the
insular style of that Flatbush area, he joined a rodeo.  We
watch him busting broncos at several points in the film, his
love for horses and a world that lay beyond the Eastern
seaboard never leaving him for an instant.  </P>
<P>   Given his frequent travels to the South and West, we don't
wonder that his marriages did not last, only that he felt the
itch to tie the knot at all--which he did four times in his sixty-
eight years.  Daughter Aiyana Elliott, who co-wrote the
screenplay in addition to directing this docu feature, shows
his departure by boat for Europe in 1955 with his first wife,
June Shelley, and takes us to the concert stages of the
Continent where Elliott's American music is in demand. 
Elliott, who talks in such a non-stop manner that interviewee
Kris Kristofferson half-jokingly guesses that the nickname
came not from Elliott's travels but from his rambling
conversations, is nothing if not opinionated.  Casting
dispersions on the heavy um-pah music of Germany and the
silly romantic tradition of French song, he praises the
wonderful Flamenco that he heard in Spain while always
venerating American traditional song above all.</P>
<P>   Despite the wealth of material from which Aiyana Elliott
could have drawn, she spends most of her time focussing on
her modern-day sexagenarian father, which is understandable
given her obsession with finally learning more about him than
she had ever been able to.  But now that he is in his late
sixties his voice is raspy, a plus, I suppose, for those who
take folk seriously enough to think that scratchy means
"authentic," but for my folk song dollar I'd have appreciated
more songs from his concerts in and about the year 1961 and
fewer interruptions of those songs.  I'd have cut some of the
talking heads in favor of more footage showing us not what
kind of person Jack really is.  Rather I'd want to know what
there is about his music that made him relatively
unappreciated throughout his life only to gain his principal
recognition in taking a Grammy in 1995 and receiving the
National Medal of the Arts from President Clinton in 1998 for
a lifetime of melodic achievement.</P>
<P>  The picture just might make those who are under forty
years of age and who have been brought up on acid rock,
heavy metal and the like wonder what the folks saw in
traditional American ballads during the stodgy fifties and the
transitional early sixties.  Older people, especially those who
did the Greenwich Village circuit of the Bitter End and
Gerde's Folk City and especially hung out in Washington
Square park on warm Sunday afternoons, know exactly the
appeal of this gentle, down-home form that ultimately became
lost in the commercializations of the Kingston Trio  only to
disappear with the advent of rock music.  It's good to see the
old guys back on screen again, folks like Izzy Young, Pete
Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Odetta and Woodie Guthrie himself, in
some cases picking away at their banjos and guitars and in
other instances just rapping about the good times before the
music died.</P>
