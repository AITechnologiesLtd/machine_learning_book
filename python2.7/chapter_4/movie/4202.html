<PRE>                             LEAVING LAS VEGAS
                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1995 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<PRE>Written and Directed by Mike Figgis
Based on the novel by John O'Brien
Cinematography by Declan Quinn
Eited by John Smith
Starring Nicolas Cage, Elizabeth Shue
U.S.A., 1995</PRE>
<P>     In LEAVING LAS VEGAS, Nicolas Cage plays Benjamin, an alcoholic
who's lost his family and his job, and moves to Las Vegas to quite
deliberately drink himself to death over the course of four weeks'
time.  While he's there, he meets a hooker named Sera, played by
Elizabeth Shue, who's cast adrift, so to speak, when her boyfriend and
pimp (Julian Sands) is finally murdered by the thugs he owes money to.
Since these two are just about the neediest people on the planet, they
immediately fall into a codependent relationship. Ben agrees to vacate
his room at the $29-a-night Whole Year Inn (in an unusual moment of
lucidity, Ben reads the sign as "the hole you're in") and move in with
Sera on one condition--she can never ask him to stop drinking.</P>
<P>     I'll say it one more time: LEAVING LAS VEGAS is about a man who
moves to Vegas and drinks himself to death. It's not a comedy, and it's
very depressing.  Still interested? The good news is that the movie is
exceedingly well acted, skillfully crafted, and even, at times, a joy.
That Benjamin's character can be so damn charming in the middle of this
deadly predicament is due to Nicolas Cage's staggering and
ever-expanding talent for playing the loser beautifully. Elizabeth Shue
is remarkable as well, even though her beauty, charisma, and demeanor
totally belie her supposed lot in life as a Vegas street hooker.
Regardless, if critics are talking Nicole Kidman up as an Oscar nominee
for the color-by-numbers TO DIE FOR, Shue ought to clinch the Nobel
Prize for what she goes through bringing this to the screen.</P>
<P>     Thank God director Mike Figgis knows his medium, because this
material would verge on maudlin without sure guidance. John O'Brien's
novel is deliberately harrowing, and it won't make you feel any better
to know that the writer committed suicide just a couple of weeks after
his book was optioned as a film. He would have profited, no doubt, from
the movie's release, but you sense that he and his characters were
living in the same lonely place, and sought release.</P>
<P>     Their sorry lots in life don't bar Ben and Sera from some
semblance of a romantic relationship, and LEAVING LAS VEGAS is indeed a
love story. As far as eroticism goes, the movie's mostly sleazy without
being sexy, and I get the feeling that's an adequate representation of
the city itself. There's certainly nothing romantic about the way Ben
drinks (indeed, he's more or less impotent), though the opening scene
is a jaunty shot of him quite literally dancing down the aisles of a
liquor store, pushing a cart filled with bottles of all shapes and
sizes. When he goes into withdrawal, he trembles and stutters until he
unstops another bottle or drains another glass, and he becomes
remarkably witty and self-assured, if not entirely pleasant. Cage digs
deep to find Benjamin's humanity, and it's brave for the film to allow
this level of dignity to such a blasted out, hopeless character while
acknowledging the fundamental disaster of his life.</P>
<P>     And it's no mean feat for the movie to maintain credibility.
LEAVING LAS VEGAS is about a desperate relationship that somehow
transcends traditional needs, and short circuits the sex drive (Sera
is, after all, going out and turning tricks even after Ben moves in).
One scene, which defines completely the seductive appeal of an
alcoholic haze, has Ben and Sera getting hot and bothered as Sera peels
off her swimsuit and pours liquor down the front of her body in an act
that takes the sublimated sexuality of TV beer commercials to its
erotic extreme. And of course, there's an abrupt comedown from the
sexual high that neatly negates the fetish.</P>
<P>     That's just one great scene in a movie that's full of them, and
with hardly a misstep.  Figgis takes an unconventional, bravura
approach to the film, and it pays off by making the experience
something more than a straightforward sad story (as movie-of-the-week
material, this tale would be deadly). The pre-credit sequence stretches
out for what seems like 10 minutes, until an obstinate, jazzy score
wells up over the credits, also composed by Figgis, which will play in
hip, sidling counterpoint to Benjamin's bleak motives for the rest of
the film. (My own pet peeve is the gaggle of Sting songs that punctuate
the soundtrack, with his vocals so high in the mix that you wind up
thinking about Sting's slightly daffy lyrics instead of the matters
onscreen.) If anything, Figgis' jumpy style is a little too much for
his material, but this is, after all, a story of excess.</P>
<P>     As a treatise on the savagery of alcohol addiction, LEAVING LAS
VEGAS is a winner, but I'm not sure what else Hollywood had in mind
when the story was optioned. To be sure, this is a movie that
brutalizes its characters from start to finish--and poor Sera comes
out the big loser, since Ben is the one who fulfills the mission of the
movie's title.  Curiously, we get no sense of the direction her
character is heading at the end of the film, even though we've
witnessed her desperate devotion to Ben and her abject humiliation at
the hands of lovers and strangers.  Maybe a brilliant movie about
alcoholism must by definition be unsatisfying, but this one's a tough
sell. For all its sincerity and virtue, LEAVING LAS VEGAS is a movie
that empties you out, and doesn't give much back.</P>
