<P>     For what it's worth, I correctly guessed the identity of the killer
in SCREAM 2...well, sort of.  I suppose I should feel satisfied at my own
cleverness, since Dimension and the makers of SCREAM 2 have put so much
effort into keeping that piece of information secret.  Even more so than
in the original SCREAM, writer Kevin Williamson goes to ridiculous
extremes to keep the audience guessing whodunnit, so ridiculous that the
film becomes too focused on the one thing which should have been least
important.  As a horror film, it's a solid piece of work; as a satire,
it's frequently hilarious.  As a mystery, it tries way, way, _way_ too
hard.</P>
<P>     SCREAM 2 takes place two years after the events of the original, just
in time for Hollywood to cash in on the Woodsboro High murders.  The
non-fiction book by reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) has become a
popular horror film called "Stab," which in turn appears to have generated
a copycat killer.  When two college students turn up dead at the film's
premiere, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) once again begins to fear for
her life.  Other Woodsboro survivors like Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and
video-store-clerk-turned-film-student Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) offer
support, but bodies continue to turn up at an alarming rate.  Who could
the killer be?  Sidney's boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell)?  Cotton Weary
(Liev Schreiber), the man Sidney once wrongly accused of murder?  Gale's
cameraman Joel (Duane Martin)?  Film student Mickey (Timothy Olyphant)?
Reporter Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf)?   Gale?  Dewey?  Randy?  Jermaine?
Marlon?  Tito?</P>
<P>     If you can keep the suspects straight without a press kit, more power
to you.  Williamson often seems so concerned with turning every live body
in sight into a potential suspect that he lets that question overwhelm
everything else.  When the characters aren't busy trying to survive the
night, they're either sitting around trying to figure out who the killer
is or _running_ around trying to figure out who the killer is.  It all
builds to a revelatory climax drawn out so long past the point of
diminishing returns -- loaded with confessions, motives and false finishes
-- that you can't even see the point of diminishing returns from there.</P>
<P>     I'm being a bit harder on SCREAM 2 than it might deserve, because
that one big problem may be the only real problem.  Williamson's satirical
darts are expertly targeted, not just at horror film cliches or the
"inevitable inferiority" of sequels, but at the original film itself.  The
film-within-a-film "Stab" provides a few wonderful moments, as do the
audience reactions to some of the more improbable situations (e.g. "Hang
up the phone and Star-69 his a**").  The dialogue is sharp, smart and not
at all afraid of naming names (Cox's "Friends" co-stars David Schwimmer
and Jennifer Aniston are among those skewered), a perfect counter-point to
Wes Craven's crafty suspense scenes.  If you're not ready to crawl out of
your skin when Campbell crawls across the unconscious form of her
tormentor, it's time for a pulse check.</P>
<P>     SCREAM 2 is so entertaining both as a chiller and as a chuckler that
the lack of attention to those elements is a frustration.  Kevin
Williamson is carving out a new genre for himself which certainly seems to
be finding an audience -- both SCREAMs and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER
take off with the radical notion that umasking the monster is a good idea.
There's just something deflating about a tense, comic horror film that
turns into a Scooby-Doo episode.  Williamson has too much talent as a
writer of comedy to keep getting side-tracked by conventions, even if
they're conventions he's helping to re-create.  Scare us or make us
laugh...we know you can do both.  Just keep the Mystery Machine parked at
the curb.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 second screams:  7.</PRE>
