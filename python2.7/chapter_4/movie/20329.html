<P>   As Europe wheezes history, so California breathes
contemporary.  The Coast, even more than the rest of the
U.S., is notorious for embracing the new, the trendy, the
modish, while tossing the old, the battered, and even the
moderately seasoned into the dust bin.  In "Sugar Town,"
written and directed by Allison Anders ("Grace of My Heart,"
about the New York pop song world of the fifties and sixties),
and Kurt Voss ("Border Radio," about the L.A. punk scene),
explores the angst-ridden lives of musicians who were big in
the eighties, washed up in middle age, and now seeking to
restore their lost glory.  Save for one pregnant woman, the
film's Earth-mother, there isn't a wholesome character in the
story--part of the charm and distinction of this eminently
enjoyable, delightfully cynical tale.  If the folks portrayed here
are stereotypical--each representing a generic trait of the
coke-and-fast-buck lifestyle of virtuosos and vocalists in the
City of Angels--Anders and Voss's pigeonholing does not
detract in the slightest from the malevolent movie's
merriment.</P>
<P>   While the film-makers conspicuously copy the Robert
Altman style--spinning a diverse tapestry of separate stories
into a loosely-woven cloth--"Sugar Town" is not up to that
director's cogent character studies.  It lacks the classic
poignancy of "Nashville" and at frequently Chris Figler's
editing is so abrupt that you get the impression that some
scenes are isolated from the others as though parts of
different movies.  But the fifteen out of sixteen self-absorbed
neurotics are sporadically even more amusing than some of
"Nashville"'s twenty-four individuals, with Beverly D'Angelo's
characterizations of a rich, sardonic widow easily stealing the
show.</P>
<P>   Essentially "Sugar Town" exhibits a palette of ambitious
souls who think nothing of using one another to climb the
ladder in Los Angeles' rock-and-roll subculture.  Only one of
them, the insufferable but physically attractive Gwen (Jade
Gordon), will freely and totally without compunction steal
other women's influential dates and almost immediately
perform the sexual services that so many followers of the
Hollywood business believe women must render to get
ahead.  Gwen is serving as a personal assistant to Liz (Ally
Sheedy), who is herself a production designer wholly
frustrated in her personal life.  After dating Burt (Larry Klein),
a record producer working with middle-aged, has-been rock
stars Nick (Michael Des Barres) and Clive (John Taylor), Liz
is hit on by a health-food worker who thinks he can charm his
way into using Liz as a reference for his own acting career.  </P>
<P>   Being in her late thirties does not do much for Eva
(Rosanna Arquette), who in her heyday was a fixture in
second-rate horror films, but is now annoyed that her only
potential offer is in the role of a mother to 18-year-old
Christina Ricci.  When Jane (Beverly D'Angelo), a rich widow,
consents to putting up the funding for support a comeback try
for Burt's musicians only if Burt can arrange to get the
attractive glam rocker Nick in the sack with her, Allison and
Voss have prepared their viewers for the most hilarious scene
in the movie.</P>
<P>   Ally Sheedy is instantly recognizable to any young woman
who has been told by her dates that they will "give you a
call."  A sucker for New Age fads, she follows the counsel of
a healer who tells her that she is vaginally blocked and who
offers to loosen her up, while her reading consists of self-help
paperbacks about how to succeed in relationships.  Filling in
some of the minor roles are former musicians like Carl (John
Doe), now a farmer trying to make enough to support his
growing family and must deal with the sexual come-ons of
Mexican-American singer Rosio (Lumi Cavazos); and a
sharply defined scene involving a 12-year-old, mixed-up but
intelligent and cocky kid, Nerve (Vincent Berry) who may or
may not be the love child of Eva's husband, Clive.</P>
<P>   Despite the hang-loose nature of the film, the dialogue is
often sharp and focussed, apparently not improvised, and the
soundtrack is filled unobtrusively and congenially with goodies
like "Gravy Stain Girl," "Puget Sound Sanitation," and "Manic
Kraut Rock."</P>
<PRE>Rated R.  Running Time: 93 minutes.  (C) 1999
