<PRE>                                THE PATHFINDER
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  A thousand-year-old Lapp legend is the
     basis of this short, entertaining, occasionally bloody
     children's film from Lapland that will be entertaining for
     adults also.  How often do you get mystical legends in films
     from Lapland?  Rating: high +1.</P>
<P>     The plot has been done many times before, often but not usually as
well.  But this time there is a good reason for the well-worn plot.  This
time it is an adaptation of a millennium-old legend from Lapland.  In the
Tenth Century the story was considerably newer.</P>
<P>     Aigin, a teenager, returns from hunting one day to see his family's
camp overrun by marauding invaders, the Tchudes.  His parents and his young
sister have been murdered.  There are about eighteen of these Tchudes, all
dressed in black and armed to the teeth with crossbows: the leader's
crossbow is decorated with snarling fangs.  There is no doubt these are
pretty nasty dudes.  One slip and Aigin is running for his life through the
frozen landscape.  He runs for help to a nearby village but rather than help
Aigin they seem more anxious to pack up and run than to fight back.  So
Aigin decides he must fight the Tchudes himself.</P>
<P>     The attraction of THE PATHFINDER is not in the storyline, which would be
as easily fit to a post-Holocaust society and has been many times from ROAD
WARRIOR on.  Where THE PATHFINDER stands out is its depiction of Tenth Century
Lapp culture.  We get little hints of Lapp mysticism and culture.  We learn
superstitions, such as the belief that once you have killed a bear your gaze is
deadly for three days.  The entire story is framed in a mystical context in
which each person has a totem reindeer who appears at pivotal moments in a
person's life.</P>
<P>     This is basically a children's film with a little violence.  That is
more acceptable for children's films in other cultures than it is in ours.
Still, it is a well-constructed and filmed children's story, and one that
adults would enjoy also.  I would rate it a high +1.  At 88 minutes it is a
trifle short, but it is enjoyable.</P>
