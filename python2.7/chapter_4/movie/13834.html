<P>Brian DePalma returns to his directorial seat after his last commercial
outing in 1996 with Tom Cruise in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (8/10). Last
summer, Brian, Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise were the talk of my
hometown of Montreal, as they took over the sporting alma mater of the
Montreal Canadians, the Forum, for a period of three months over the
summer. Anybody who was anybody, including anybodies who weren't
anybody, got parts as extras on this set, including my brother and my
good friend The Arrow (Neither of whom can be clearly identified in the
finished product.)</P>
<P>PLOT:
Richie Santoro (Cage) is a crooked beat cop who works the dirty streets
of Atlantic City. His childhood friend Major Kevin Dunne (Sinise) has
moved on with his life, and now works as the right hand man of the US
Secretary of Defense. The night is "fight night" in Atlantic City, with
everyone in the crowd, and a raging hurricane gasping outside. During
the boxing match, the Secretary of Defense gets shot in the neck by a
sniper. Santoro becomes the investigating cop of the shooting, as
evidence of a conspiracy to kill the man comes to light. The mystery
behind the shooting is the focus of the rest of the film.  </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Highly stylized, extremely talkative, generally actionless, and lightly
entertaining mystery from the man who has made pick-pocketing from one
of the greatest directors of all time, Alfred Hitchcock, part of his
own legend. This film does not maintain many moments of extreme thrills
or surprises. It does put together a decent mystery plot by way of
flashbacks (Written by David Koepp, the man who also penned MISSION
IMPOSSIBLE, the two JURASSIC PARK's and DePalma's CARLITO'S WAY
(7.5/10)), with some typically slick styling from DePalma, all the
while running in real time, but the overall framework of the film
leaves little to get excited about. The montage used during the final
credit crawl is also one of the worst and most boring of all time. </P>
<P>Nicolas Cage does a decent job of over-acting his over the top
character here, and so does Sinise as the ambiguous friend from the
day. Juliette Binoche look-alike Carla Gugina from TV's "Spin City"
also turns in a fitting performance as the girl in distress. I must
admit that my recent viewing of THE NEGOTIATOR (7/10) might've set my
standards for thrills a little higher for this one, but either way,
this movie's plot does little to innovate the genre, while continuing
to homage the genre that made DePalma who he is today.</P>
<P>Admittedly, I was impressed with another one of DePalma's classic
one-shot-camera opening sequences, this one lasting at least 20
minutes, and many of his other camera tricks, but overall, the movie
seemed flawed in its attempt to enrapture the audience's imagination,
and deliver on a solid ending. The parts after the official denouement
were actually some of the funniest scenes in the movie, while the final
scene just seemed like another Hollywood demand gone acknowledged. All
in all, I guess you should go see this film, if you really like
DePalma, his style and his mysteries (Or if you know somebody who may
have played an extra in the audience.) If not, you could easily wait
for the video version of this film, which will surely appetize your
visually demanding gut and fill any 100-minute gap that's needed in
your life. </P>
