"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Oh, great - it's another movie about a mother from the U.K. trying to
cope with a bunch of kids.  Hot on the heels of Agnes Browne and
Angela's Ashes comes East is East, an award-winning play-turned-film
about a family that pisses in pots and bathes in a tiny tin basin.  But
unlike these other films, East actually features a strong paternal
figure – a Pakistani man intent on raising his kids under the strict
tenets of the Muslim religion.</P>
<P>George Khan (Om Puri, My Son the Fanatic) left Pakistan and his first
wife in the ‘40s and has been happily married to Brit wife Ella (Linda
Bassett, Oscar & Lucinda) for twenty-five years.  The Khans own a
fish-and-chips shop, and their seven children - six boys and a girl, who
range in age from twelve to adult - are at a point in their lives where
rebellion is to be expected.  But these youths have more to revolt
against than your average teens experimenting in the thriving Manchester
counterculture scene of 1971.  The kids try to shun Pop's religion (they
call him `Genghis') and have to be physically herded into a van that
drives them to private religious studies.</P>
<P>As the film opens, the oldest Khan son Nazir (Ian Aspinal) makes like
Julia Roberts in Runaway Bride and bolts out of the ceremony for his
arranged marriage.  Inspired by the growing tension between his native
country and India, as well as a subplot involving a fascist politician
preaching racial purity as a major platform of his campaign, George
forges ahead and tries to set up surprise weddings for his next two
sons, Tariq (Jimi Mistry) and Abdul (Raji James).  Things in the Khan
household start to boil over as Ella is no longer able to tow the fine
line between devotion to her husband and the natural instinct to protect
her kids.</P>
<P>While this description may not sound like a load of laughs, East is
downright hysterical.  The clash between different cultures is very
effectively portrayed in the screenplay, which Ayub Khan-Din adapted
from his own smash-hit play (for you indie film buffs, he played Sammy
in Sammy and Rosie Get Laid).  People may take offense to the domestic
violence that occurs in the film, especially when those incidents are
sandwiched between comedic scenes.  And some people may think that the
film is filled with horrible racial stereotypes about Pakistanis.  A
neighbor mutters that the Khans look like `a pick-a-ninny picnic,' and
at one point, Tariq shouts, `I don't want to marry a Paki!'  Well, he
doesn't, and I wouldn't if I were him, either.</P>
<P>East was nominated for a handful of British Academy Awards, as well as
running away with top honors from the London Critics Circle.  The acting
within the dysfunctional family is as good as I've seen, and most of the
young actors have little or no acting experience (some may be familiar
to fans of British soap operas).  And Puri is fantastic as the
overbearing father that calls his wife `missus' and all of his kids
`bastard.</P>
<P>1:36 – for adult language, domestic violence and brief nudity</P>
