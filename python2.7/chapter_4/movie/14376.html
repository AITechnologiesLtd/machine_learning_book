<PRE>One True Thing (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 77</PRE>
<P>"One True Thing" has a very high quality to entertainment
ratio.  While it is certainly a very good film, with
an excellent cast and script, it is a difficult film
to watch.  While the advertising campaign would have
you believe that the film is heartwarming, the emotional
impact is closer to wrenching.</P>
<P>George (William Hurt) is a successful college professor
and author.  His upper class family consists of kindly
socialite wife Kate (Meryl Streep), and their two
grown children: outspoken reporter Ellen (Renee Zellweger)
and gentle screw-up Brian (Tom Everett Scott).</P>
<P>Ellen has grown up worshipping her father and rejecting
her mother.  By becoming a reporter, she is emulating
her father's writing profession, and by remaining single,
she has avoided the charitable and housewife roles of
her mother.</P>
<P>Unhappily, Kate develops cancer and undergoes chemotherapy.
George asks his daughter to leave her job in New York
and help her mother.  Ellen reluctantly agrees, and
the decision changes her life.  Her career and her
boyfriend become secondary to her family, and she realizes
that her childhood opinion of her parents was wrong.</P>
<P>Ellen discovers that her mother is strong and selfless,
while her father is weak and selfish.  In general,
men do not come off well in "One True Thing".  Her
brother Brian is flunking out of school and is like
a lost puppy, while her boyfriend Jordan (Nicky Katt)
has all the weaknesses of her father with none of his
strengths.</P>
<P>"One True Thing" is certain to receive some Academy
Award nominations.  Streep will likely be nominated for
Best Actress, and Karen Croner will likely be nominated
for Best Adapted Screenplay, based on a novel by
Anna Quindlen.</P>
<P>The usual opening night audience of teens and young
adults was replaced by middle-aged adults, compelled by
the Streep and Hurt names.  The audience was generally
silent, but occasionally shuddered during the more
revealing moments.</P>
<P>"One True Thing" is not an entertaining film, but
it is an important film.  The audience is challenged
to confront terminal illness and devastating
disappointment in family members.  While "One True
Thing" may be an emotionally draining film, it is
well worth the effort.</P>
