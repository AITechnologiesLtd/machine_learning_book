<PRE>The Emperor's New Groove
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>I'll be the first to admit I didn't expect much from The Emperor's New
Groove: More Celine Dion-esque song-and-dance numbers, cuddly characters
that become cross-promotion devices in McDonald's Happy Meals, and
Hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice-over job to
their resume.</P>
<P>I was dead wrong about all of those things.</P>
<P>The Emperor's New Groove is funny.  Damn funny.  And the cute characters
in the film are the dangerous ones.  The script is fast and furious,
with no singing and dancing.  The animation is clean and would give Walt
a warm feeling all over.  The humor is dry and aimed at both the
cynicism and the goodness in all of us.  The story is ridiculously weird
and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking, cross-dressing
llamas and schizophrenia.</P>
<P>Here's the plot; try to follow along.  Set in a mythical kingdom, the
film follows the adventures of Kuzco (David Spade), an arrogant and
egocentric emperor.  When Kuzco fires his power-hungry advisor, Yzma
(Eartha Kitt), she and her "assistant" Kronk (Seinfeld's Patrick
Warburton) change him into a llama.  Kuzco then gets stranded in the
jungle and must rely on Pacha (John Goodman), a llama-herder whose home
was to be replaced by Kuzco's Water World Theme Park, to save him.  Then
the fun starts.</P>
<P>For the next sixty minutes, the audience is treated to something unheard
of in Disney films these days: Imagination.  Yzma, voiced by the
talented singer Eartha Kitt, looks like a cross between Norma Desmond,
Joan Crawford, and a really old Vegas showgirl.  The dialogue between
her and her oblivious assistant Kronk is quick, sharp, and feels like an
episode of Seinfeld (which would make sense).  David Spade and John
Goodman's character interactions make you feel like you're watching an
old Hope/Crosby film.  Spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots
below the belt on several occasions, and I laughed out loud several
times.  Needless to say, that is an extremely rare thing in Disney
screenings these days.</P>
<P>The best part about The Emperor's New Groove is how audacious the film
is.  The sheer weirdness factor is very high.  Cross-dressing,
schizophrenia, duality of soul, people being turned into every animal on
Noah's boat, llama CPR, homoerotic tendencies, an Emperor with his own
theme song and singer, Michael Jackson dance moves, and a guy that can
communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the
film a true orginal.</P>
<P>Simply put, The Emperor's New Groove is one of the best children's films
out for this holiday season.  Kids will enjoy the adventures, and
parents will enjoy the story and dialogue.  That's a tough thing to pull
off in a single package, but this Emperor manages to do it.</P>
