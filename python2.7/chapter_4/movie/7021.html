<P>During the 1970's, Francis Ford Coppola had brought us THE GODFATHER, THE
CONVERSATION, THE GODFATHER PART II and APOCALYPSE NOW. All were nominated
for Best Picture and the two GODFATHER films each won their Oscars.
Coppola made these back to back to back to back. They are arguably some of
the best films that ever came out of American cinema. Then in 1980, with
the release of ONE FROM THE HEART (the straw that broke the camel's back)
Coppola began a decade long run of mediocrity. He stopped writing his own
work and the scope of his pictures narrowed. Not that a film's scope is a
determinant of quality, he co-wrote the screenplay for RUMBLE FISH which
is probably his best film during the 1980's, but Coppola was proving
himself a master of the epic film. Only in 1990 with the release of THE
GODFATHER PART III did he prove that he hadn't lost his screenwriting
touch--he just wasn't using it. PART III was rightfully nominated for Best
Picture but lost out to the unfortunate Year of Kevin Costner. After that
he made BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA which is only recently gathering a cult
following. Now in 1996, he brings us JACK.</P>
<P>Jack Powell, played by Robin Williams, is ten years old. However, because
of a mysterious Hollywood disease, he grows at four times the natural
rate.  Because of this he was born, fully developed, after a two month
pregnancy and now looks like a forty year old man. His parents overprotect
him. They hire him a tutor, Bill Cosby, so that he doesn't have to go to
school. Eventually, it is the tutor that insists Jack be allowed to attend
public school and meet kids his own age. They decide to give it a shot and
the story continues from there.</P>
<P>Too often the written word, something the audience experiences indirectly,
is a film's weakest link. The scribes for JACK, James DeMonaco and Gary
Nadeau, have written scenes that are both effectively comical and
touching, but the film is best when words are put aside and Coppola begins
telling a bit of story through his mastery of visuals. The dialogue is at
times uninspired and predictable, and that's unfortunate. However, there
are plenty of great moments created by Coppola and Robin Williams that
keep the film afloat. And with the closing of the film, we are brought to
tears--at least I was.</P>
<P>For example, Francis Ford Coppola directed a scene in JACK where Robin
Williams watches a butterfly spring from a cocoon. The scene is full of
wonder and the inherent symbolism is more than apparent. Later, presumably
the same butterfly lands on Robin's windowsill. He picks it up and tries
to set it free, but it dies in his hands. Neither of these scenes contain
any dialogue and more is said about JACK at these times than any other.
This is the work of a great director. Coppola also makes great use of
time-lapse photography and another similar effect that involves a sunbeam
moving across the room during a regular motion shot. These are my favorite
moments in the film.</P>
<P>Robin Williams does an equal--if not better--job of playing a child in a
man's body than Tom Hanks did in BIG. The difference is Williams'
character suffers from intense psychological difficulties once he begins
to realize how quickly his life will end. It's a thoughtful performance by
Williams.  It's also an inspiring one. The rest of the cast is fine. All
the kids are great and even Fran Drescher is good. Bill Cosby is sweet,
but again, the keys to the film's success are Williams and Coppola.</P>
<P>While Coppola was shooting GARDENS OF STONE, his eldest son was killed in
a boating accident. Just a few months later, Coppola's granddaughter was
born. She will never know her father first-hand. The film is dedicated to
her. I can see why Coppola chose to do this film. And although the writing
wasn't up to snuff, I can't deny that I watched the credits through teary
eyes. </P>
