<PRE>                        HELLRAISER 3: HELL ON EARTH
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>90 min., R, Horror, 1992
Director: Anthony Hickox
Cast: Terry Farrell, Doug Bradley, Paula Marshall, Kevin Bernhardt,
      Ashley Lawrence</PRE>
<P>     The owner of a popular punk club finds a statue with Pinhead's face
in the center.  He finds out that Pinhead is in the statue and releases
him (stupid man).  Reporter Farrell is contacted by a ghost and told
about the death and destruction that Pinhead will raise (starting with
the schmuck that released him).  Farrell is the only person who knows
enough to stop Pinhead.</P>
<P>     I enjoyed HELLRAISER 3: HELL ON EARTH very much and am glad that I
saw it in the theater.  I felt that it was worth  the money to see it on
the big screen.  The only people who I feel will like this film are big
fans of the genre.  For those who think that they will enjoy seeing this
film, I suggest the big screen.  For those who are dubious, may I
suggest that you wait for the video cassette.  On a scale of zero to
five, I give HELLRAISER 3 a four.  HELLRAISER 3 is rated R for explicit
language, graphic violence, and adult situations.</P>
<P>     The special effects for the film are great.  The "cenobites" look
great.  I have heard that HELLRAISER 3 is nothing more than a rehash of
HELLRAISER and HELLBOUND - HELLRAISER 2.  I have not yet seen either of
the earlier films, so I can't confirm it, although I do plan on seeing
them when I get a chance.  I wanted to see this film before it left the
theaters, so I decided that I could watch the earlier ones later.  The
actors all do a reasonably good job, although that is not hard to do in
a horror film.  There are a few things in the film that don't make sense
to me.  However, they may have been explained in parts one or two.</P>
<P>     I was a little upset to see that Clive Barker was only the
executive producer.  I am a fan of his writing and had hoped that he had
written this one.  He wrote and directed HELLRAISER and he may have
written HELLBOUND - HELLRAISER 2, but I am not sure.  Oh well, it was
still a good movie.</P>
<P>     By the way: Did anyone else see the series of six continuing skits
during the MTV Music Awards with David Spade, Pinhead, Andrew Dice Clay,
and Ringo Starr?  If you missed it, you might try to find a friend who
taped the awards so that you can see it.  It is worth it.  There are
three skits during the program (the first with Dice, the second with
Pinhead, and the third with Starr) and three during the end credits.
                                 --------
     I also got to see two previews of upcoming horror films that look
great.  One is INNOCENT BLOOD (which just opened in theaters), by John
Landis, and the other is DRACULA (which is going to be released around
Thanksgiving), by Francis Ford Coppola.</P>
