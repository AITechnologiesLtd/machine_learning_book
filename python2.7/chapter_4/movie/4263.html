<P>     Much as I disliked ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE, it pains me to admit
that Jim Carrey's first star vehicle was better than this hopelessly
unfunny followup.  PET DETECTIVE, while being exceptionally silly and
dumb (that, I suppose, was the whole point), still had its humorous
moments.  The same cannot be said of WHEN NATURE CALLS, which, although
equally moronic, left me sitting stone-faced in my seat for ninety
minutes while it tried vainly to coax a laugh.  There's nothing worse
than a film which mistakenly believes it's the comic event of the year.
For no legitimate reason whatsoever, WHEN NATURE CALLS is full of itself
to the point of being offensive.</P>
<P>     In the eyes of some fans, the rubber-faced Carrey can do no wrong,
and they will undoubtedly lap up WHEN NATURE CALLS, then come back for
seconds.  This film was made for them.  For the rest of us, who can
endure the comedian only in small doses or when he's carefully reigned
in (as in THE MASK), the picture is virtually unwatchable.  Like cough
medicine, the taste gets worse the more you're forced to ingest.</P>
<P>     WHEN NATURE CALLS opens with an uninspired take-off of CLIFFHANGER
(a movie that was almost a self-parody in its own right).  After that,
it's off to a brief interlude at a Buddhist monastery, then on to
Africa, where Ace Ventura has been hired to find a stolen white bat.
If he fails, the Wachatis and Wachootoos--two stereotyped African
tribes--will go to war.  Of course, Ace solves the case, but only after
an inordinate number of idiotic jokes and failed sight gags.  It's
beyond my comprehension how a British actor of Simon Callow's (FOUR
WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL) stature can allow himself to be put through the
ritual humiliation of appearing as one of Carrey's straight men (in
this case, he's the bad guy).  The pay check must have been handsome.</P>
<P>     Carrey's meteoric rise started with the first ACE VENTURA, so it
was certain there would be a sequel.  What's so surprising is how
creatively barren Steve Oedekerk's movie is.  WHEN NATURE CALLS relies
solely on Carrey's personality and performance to sustain it, which
doesn't happen.  The writing is sophomoric and the humor often makes
DUMB AND DUMBER look enlightened.  It's hard to imagine Carrey doing
something worse than WHEN NATURE CALLS, but then I previously thought
he'd have a hard time lowering himself below the standards set by PET
DETECTIVE.</P>
<P>     The phrase "answering the call of nature" commonly refers to
activities involving a toilet.  All things considered, that's an
appropriate place to dump this latest installment of the Ace Ventura
saga.</P>
