<PRE>By Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>American Beauty, Starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch,
Allison Janney, Peter Gallagher, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley, and Chris Cooper
Directed by Sam Mendes</P>
<P>The catch phrase for American Beauty is `When you've got nothing to lose,
you might as well risk everything. At first glance Lester Burnham (Spacey)
appears to have everything to lose.  His is the typical suburban life,
with a lovely home, wife, daughter, and a well-paying job.  But that's at
first glance.  The more we get to know Lester, the more we understand his
actions.</P>
<P>Every character in the film reminds me of someone I know, including
myself although probably not to the extent that others see me.  Lester
himself is a quiet man routinely going through life, accepting his
surroundings.  He's one of the good guys.  His wife, Carolyn, is the
driving force in the family.  She is the one who sets the rules and
expects total compliance from Lester, their daughter, their neighbors, and
everyone that she encounters including her real estate customers.  She is
determined to project the `right' image, complete with a garden full of
American Beauty roses.  </P>
<P>Their daughter is on the high school cheerleading squad as is her friend,
a cute little blonde sexpot.  As Lester's life starts to crumble about
him, he envisions himself in an interlude with the blonde, and the rose
petals are cleverly interposed with those fantasies.</P>
<P>There are many subplots throughout the storyline, and all of them are
well-written, acted, and directed.  The neighbors are an assorted lot,
including the teenage boy who stalks Lester's daughter.   The male couple
who live on the other side of the Burnhams are well placed and they are an
integral part of the plot.</P>
<P>It is an exceptional plot and one that will stay with you for a while. 
Now that I know what happens, I want to see it again.  It deserves an A
for its unusual delivery.</P>
