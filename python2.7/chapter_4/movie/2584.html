<PRE>                                 BEVERLY HILLS COP III
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael John Legeros</PRE>

        Danilo Bach and Daniel Petrie Jr.

<PRE>==</PRE>
<P>     Second sequels suck.  No, not always, but they sure do
disappoint.  SUPERMAN III, GODFATHER III, ALIEN 3, LETHAL WEAPON 3,
and, now, proudly, shamelessly, BEVERLY HILLS COP III.</P>
<P>     Eddie Murphy is back as Axel Foley, that street-smart show-off who
can't seem to shy from Bevery Hills.  His target is the LA amusement
park Wonder World and Foley is hot on the heels of a murderer he met in
Detroit.  Giving him grief are the FBI and the BHPD, neither of whom
want Axel grease in their affairs.</P>
<P>     Seven years have passed since our last visit to the COP shop;
seven years of civil suits and bad press and all those things that have
officially nixed the notion of the Maverick Cop.  Can we *really*
believe that enforcement agencies would even *dream* of condoning
Axel's actions.  Of course not.</P>
<P>     As implausible as the premise plots, COP III works for a while.  The
pace is fast and the jokes are okay.  Murphy breezes through scenes
that are tame enough and lame enough to suggest that, maybe, hopefully,
bigger and better things are yet to come.</P>
<PRE>     Not so.</PRE>
<P>     Axel digs deeper into the ways and whys of Wonder World--courtesy
of a few too many unlocked doors--and the plot holes grow and grow and
grow until they swallow the film whole.</P>
<P>     Are we to believe, courtesy of a counterfeit subplot, that Axel
Foley can pull a digitized photo of himself out of thin air?  Or that
the "largest private police force in the country" doesn't have a soul
on their staff who can shoot straight?  Or that Axel and associates can
kill person after person without even batting an 'brow?</P>
<PRE>     I don't sink so.</PRE>
<P>     The humor is sparse, but not absent.  A cute bit bags four
off-duty cartoon-characters playing poker under Wonder World.  And
there's a great scene where Murphy, dressed as an elephant (don't ask),
pushes a mouthy moppet into a fountain.</P>
<P>     For film fans, the director's trademark touches are few and
far-between.  If you *must* see the film, watch for a SWAT-team
send-up, a soul-music shoot-out, and, as usual, cameos from a drove of
directors including George Lucas, Joe Dante, John Singleton, and Barbet
Schroeder.</P>
<P>     Beyond Murphy's contractually efficient performance, Bronson
Pinchot has two scenes as Serge, now selling arms instead of art.
Judge Reinhold, back as Billy Rosewood, does a cute imitation of Jack
Webb.  And Hector Elizondo is agreeable as John Ashton's replacement
Jon Flint, the obligatory
family-man-character-with-nothing-else-to-do.</P>
<P>     The surprise find is former "Mr. Ed" second-banana Alan Young,
who plays Uncle Dave, designer and proprietor of Wonder World.  Leave
it Landis to inspire inspired casting.</P>
<P>LOOK:  Watch for a minor reference to George Pal's THE TIME MACHINE,
       which also starred Young.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:    COP III is too violent and too implausible to be taken
                seriously funny.  Maybe the concept of an exciting
                second-sequel is an oxymoron.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: D+</PRE>
