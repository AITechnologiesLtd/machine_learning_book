<PRE>"The Invisible Circus"</PRE>
<P>18-year old Phoebe O'Connor (Jordanna Brewster) spent her teen years
possessed by the memory of her older sister Faith (Cameron Diaz). Faith
left home years before to go to Europe to "do something important." She
died. Phoebe has always questioned the death and finally leaves home,
herself, to find the truth in "The Invisible Circus."</P>
<P>Adapting the novel by Jennifer Egan, Adam Brooks scripts and directs this
road journey/coming-of-age story about a young woman growing up in the
70's. By the beginning of that decade, the hippie philosophy of changing
the world through peace and love had mutated into change-through-terror. In
Europe, radical factions like the Bader-Meinhoff Gang were using guns and
bombs to affect change, attracting revolutionaries from around the world.</P>
<P>Faith and her boyfriend, Wolf (Christopher Eccleston), leave the staid
safety of San Francisco to check out what's happening in Europe. After
wandering the continent to find themselves, Faith is drawn to the
excitement of the Red Army and joins the terrorist group, leaving Wolf
behind. Faith's fails to prove herself as a revolutionary and is abandoned
by the gang. She joins a splinter faction and, when she delivers a bomb to
the offices of a prominent industrialist one night, an innocent man is
killed. Faith is changed forever by the incident.</P>
<P>Years later, after Faith's death in Portugal, Phoebe takes the postcards
that her sister faithfully sent her, kisses her mom (Blythe Danner)
goodbye, and heads to the Continent. Once there, she traces Faith's
movements from Amsterdam to Berlin to Paris where she finds Wolf. Her
appearance at his doorstep and her mission cause the expatriated American
to join Phoebe on her quest. A romance ensues. During the journey Phoebe
convinces Wolf to tell her the truth about her sister and this truth is to
change Phoebe forever.</P>
<P>"The Invisible Circus" is throwback film that feels like it was made in the
70's. There is an innocence to both the story and its telling that is
rather refreshing. It does not try to recreate events of the day. Instead,
it shows the essence of the idealism the young possessed at the time. Faith
personifies the free spirit that sees herself as the vehicle of change for
the whole world. When her ideals are dashed by the results of her violent
actions, it reps the loss of innocence for both Faith and the radical youth
movement.</P>
<P>The focus of the story is on young Phoebe as she struggles with the loss of
her sister without understanding why she died. Phoebe lived, vicariously,
through the postcards from Faith, seeing the world from her sister's eyes.
Faith's death and Phoebe's newfound independence cause the young woman to
follow in her sister's steps. The ensuing journey is both physical and
spiritual for Phoebe as she finds herself, love and, finally, the answers
she seeks. It's an interesting story of a young woman whose experiences and
pain turn her into a wiser, though more melancholy, young adult.</P>
<P>Jordanna Brewster does a solid job as Phoebe. She has to carry the bulk of
the screen time and actually matures as the story progresses. The young
actress acquits herself well. Cameron Diaz has the difficult role of being
the idol of her sister's eye and her character is held at arm's length to
be examined by her sister (and the viewer). Christopher Eccleston is
believable as Wolf. He, too, has a tough role and walks a fine line between
weakness and strength. Blythe Danner's is little more than a cameo
performance, but she does do a good mom. Patrick Bergin appears in
flashback as the girls' father.</P>
<P>Production is well done with beautifully selected European locations. It's
almost a travelogue as we journey to the canals of Amsterdam, the streets
of Paris and the lush scenery of Portugal. It looks good, too, with the
photography Henry Braham and costumes by Donna Zakowska lending to the feel
of the 70's. There is also a surreal element, nicely handled, when Phoebe
meets the members of the title troupe in a display of magic, juggling and
dance.</P>
<P>"The Invisible Circus" is a good coming-of-age tale that has a sensible arc
to its story. It should have an attraction for more mature teens and young
adults, though I doubt if it will set any fires. I give it a C+.</P>
