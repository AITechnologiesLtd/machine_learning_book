Payback **</PRE>
<P>rated R
starring Mel Gibson, Gregg Henry, Maria Bello, David Paymer, Deborah Unger
written by Brian Helgeland and Terry Hayes
based on the novel "The Hunter" by Donald E. Westlake(as Richard Stark)
directed by Brian Helgeland</P>
<P>In the past decade, filmmakers have decided that people want to see
movies that look "cool". And who could blame them? In today's society,
it's all about what's cool and what's not. For a long time, Mel Gibson
has been the poster boy of "cool".  So those executives down at
Paramount probably decided that they should take Mel Gibson and revive
a character known to many readers of crime fiction; a character named
Parker, from the bestselling series by Donald E. Westlake, and make it
into an early '99 movie.  And if that wasn't cool enough, they took
Academy Award winner Brian Helgeland, writer of L.A. CONFIDENTIAL(and,
sadly, CONSPIRACY THEORY) and asked him to direct his first feature
film. And then, just for the "cool" shock value, they decided to load
it up with gruesome action violence(including a scene where a
character's nosering gets ripped out), "cool" faux-Elmore Leonard
dialogue, and dark, silvery lighting. But in the midst of all this
coolness, there was the actual movie. And it's a shame to say that it
is not nearly the sum of its parts.</P>
<P>For one thing Mel Gibson's Porter character is mean, mean, and
mean. The film's tagline, "Get Ready to Root For the Bad Guy" isn't
even the half of it. The loose storyline is that Porter and his former
partner Val(Gregg Henry) worked on a heist in which they got $140,000
to share. Val then double-crosses Porter, and runs off with the cash
and his junkie wife(Deborah Unger), who ends up shooting him. After
"surgery", Porter is out to seek his 70,000 bucks, and he will waste
no time in butchering anyone who doesn't give him what he wants. The
people behind this movie probably thought that Porter was so "cool",
that they forgot that they're not the ones who're gonna be paying to
see the movie. I mean, are we supposed to like this guy? First-time
director Brian Helgeland slums once again with this lowly crime
thriller. Even comic turns from Kris Kristofferson and James Coburn
cannot keep PAYBACK from being nothing more than trash.  Every once in
a while there is a good line, but if you want to see a much better
better version of the same novel, see John Boorman's POINT
BLANK. Throughout PAYBACK, I couldn't help but think of OUT OF SIGHT,
far better and more richly styled than anything in this Mel Gibson
vehicle. I think audiences deserve a movie that earns its coolness.</P>
