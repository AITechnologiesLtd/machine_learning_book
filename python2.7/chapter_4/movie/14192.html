<P>   Movie critic Roger Ebert relates that he was once criticized
by his editor for saying in a review, "The Irish have the gift of
gab."  Not politically correct, the statement was cut.  Now, as
the P.C. movement seems in retreat, a victim of its excesses,
we can safety bring back that stereotype.  If we're to believe
some of the recent movies featuring people of Irish ethnicity,
the Irish talk even more than the French.  The star-filled
"Monument Ave.," which becomes compelling only if you have
the patience to allow ambiance to take precedence over plot,
is no exception.  The story, not outrageously original, is wholly
redeemed by demonstrating the love that Irish-Americans
have for talk and, in fact, during the first twenty minutes or so
you're likely to wonder where the story is headed.  Since with
one exception the characters are supposed to be Bostonians
and not Dubliners, theirs is not the lilting language of W.B.
Yeats but rather the rugged conversations that saturate the
banter of working-class folks.  The earthy women are as
leathery as the men, a quality that's highlighted as director
Ted Demme contrasts the discourse of one hard-drinking,
chain-smoking lass (Famke Janssen) with that of a yuppie
individual from the other end of town (Jeanne Tripplehorn).</P>
<P>   "Monument Ave." bears the stamp of autobiography,
permeated with photos of an extended family of Boston Irish
from their childhood.  The pictures contrast the happy,
innocent beach scenes of youth with the smoke- and intrigue-
filled days of their approaching middle years.   Bobby O'Grady
(Denis Leary) and his circle live in Boston's Charlestown
neighborhood, which is a square mile but whose working-
class population is being slowly eroded by an influx of cash-
rich yuppies.  He makes his living as a petty thief, the kind of
charming burglar so popular in largely comic movies: a
smooth, magnetic type whose best friend is the improbable
Mouse Murphy (Ian Hart).  They break into yuppie houses to
steal cash and furniture and when they take cars, they go for
the Ferraris.  Their circle includes the treacherous Jack
O'Hara (Colm Meaney), whose specialty is making sure that
nobody rats to the cops and who shares his wealth with the
needy older women of the small neighborhood.  Others
involved in the general malfeasance are Red Coherty (Noah
Emmerich) who acts as a fence and Digger Bruce (John
Diehl) whose taxi is used for their transportation.  Not
exceptionally greedy, they are not above helping relatives
come over from Ireland.  Bobby's Dubliner cousin Seamus
(Jason Barry), brought over with the stolen funds, quickly
becomes Americanized albeit unwillingly into a life of crime. 
The only threat is the police, particularly Hanlon (Martin
Sheen), who tries to break through the code of silence that
keeps the gang going strong.  Human flaws have a way of
causing friction, and in this case Jack's girl Katy (Famke
Janssen) has been cheating on her man by seeing Bobby.  </P>
<P>   Helmer Ted Demme, using Mike Armstrong's circuitous
screenplay, demonstrates his love for the salt-of-the-earth
Irish Americans by a broad toleration for their little schemes. 
The movie's funniest scene involves Bobby's description of
one of the jobs, with his friend Mouse breaking into a yuppie
household to steal cash and jewelry. Mouse takes his time for
a triple-decker sandwich from the homeowner's frig, thumbing
through the guy's collection of old baseball cards, and
eventually falling asleep on the waterbed--an upscale
contraption he had never before seen.  Demme also hones in
well on a professional ice hockey game in a rink watched over
by Red, and contrasts this with a choose-up game on the
neighborhod streets played by the winsome group of friends. 
Though the foibles of this little band of thieves is looked upon
with approbation, director Demme makes clear his horror of
the tragedy that can result when a nasty leader is threatened
by rumors of squealers among his people.</P>
<P>   Milking the milieu of both the working-class and of the
ethnic Irish in America, Demme imparts a slender but
ultimately compelling story made into superior fare thanks to
the exceptional acting of the always reliable Denis Leary, who
is supported by an ensemble of performers--including Billy
Crudup, who shows another side to his fine acting talent. 
"Monument Ave." suceeds by being at once a sociological
tract, a caper film, and a showcase for superb performances.</P>
