<P>         Some actresses are capable of giving wonderful performances
even without the benefit of a solid script or a strong director. With
"Where the Heart Is," Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd join that select
group.</P>
<P> The movie itself is a shapeless, often downright baffling
confection, made up of equal parts syrup, salt and good old-fashioned
hogwash. It's drawn from a novel by Billie Letts that became a hot
seller after it earned the Oprah Winfrey seal of approval. Often, as the
film skips from corny comedy to unconvincing drama, it appears as if
screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel completely missed whatever
it was that made the book so special.</P>
<P> "Heart" was directed by Matt Williams, the man who helped
develop "Roseanne" and whenever the picture reaches for some serious
emotions, Williams tends to serve them up in the overearnest style of
one of those dreaded "very special episodes" that turn up on sitcoms
during sweeps week. Were it not for the presence of Portman and Judd,
"Heart" could easily have turned into a pilot for a lame TV series. Call
it "Wal-Mart Mama."</P>
<P> The story merrily skips through the five years following the
day penniless, heavy-with-child Novalee Nation (Portman) was abandoned
at a Wal-Mart in Sequoyah, Oklahoma. That's where Novalee gave birth to
her daughter Americus -- cute is the name of the game here --  and where
she found shelter with a good-natured recovering alcoholic named Sister
Husband (Stockard Channing). What was Sister's brother named, you ask?
Why, Brother Husband, of course.</P>
<PRE> See? C-u-t-e.</PRE>
<P> It doesn't stop there. Lexi (Judd), Novalee's confidante, has
five kids, all of whom have been named after snack foods. The two women
become close friends, perhaps because they're the only ones in Sequoyah
who seem able to laugh away the problems of being barefoot and pregnant.</P>
<P>         As "Heart" unfolds, the pair will weather kidnappings, natural
disasters, abusive boyfriends, scheming relatives and much, much more.
Whatever slight credibility the plot builds up is quickly erased after
one character inherits $41,000 and proceeds to use it to build and
furnish a house that must have cost at least five times that much.</P>
<P> Yet Judd and Portman seem to believe in this bunk and, to some
extent, they convince us the movie is worth watching. Since her
breakthrough role in "Ruby in Paradise," Judd has too often allowed
herself to be straitjacketed in parts unworthy of her talent: "Double
Jeopardy" and "Eye of the Beholder" were shining recent examples. Lexi
isn't fully developed, but Judd's warmth and natural charm come through
anyway. So does her sly way with a line, as when she asks Novalee if she
can drive home slowly "so I can pretend it's a vacation."</P>
<P> Portman is the real engine of "Heart" though, and she delivers
a marvelous, deeply moving snapshot of a woman who has to grow up
quickly in a very short amount of time. As someone who claims she's
"never lived any place that didn't have wheels underneath it," Novalee
would seem ripe for parody, and plenty of actresses would have had a
difficult time refraining from being condescending.</P>
<P> Not Portman. She seems completely sympathetic to Novalee's
situation and never once does she drift into caricature or make a cheap
joke about her. As she did in last year's much better "Anywhere But
Here," Portman slips gently into her character and embodies her with
spirit, grace and verve.</P>
<P> At one point, Novalee tells Lexi, "We've all got meanness in
us, but we've got goodness, too, and the only thing worth living for is
the good." That doesn't sound like anything a teen would tell her older
friend, but Portman delivers it as if she believes every syllable. She
does it so well in fact that maybe for just a moment we can believe it
too. James Sanford</P>
