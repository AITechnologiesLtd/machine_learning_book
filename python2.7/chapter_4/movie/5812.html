                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1996 Chuck Dowling</PRE>

<P>"Screamers" had so much potential to be a good science fiction film. The
basic story had promise, even though it seems similar to about a dozen
various episodes of "Star Trek". In the year 2078, we have voyaged out into
space and have started to mine other planets for minerals. A dispute erupts
between the miners and the mining corporation and war is declared. The
miners develop a security system of little tiny robots who live under the
sand and attack any living thing that comes near them. Well, soon these
little robots start to evolve and begin to enhance themselves into bigger
mechanisms, ready to attack the people who created them and start their own
race.</P>
<P>Somehow, in one step, these robots evolve from little tiny things into
humanoid robots, able to blend in with other people and fool almost anyone.
That doesn't make sense. There has to be some sort of evolution into
something between the two. The film basically takes place in the desert and
in dirty, lifeless bunkers, two places which are boring locations to tell a
story. And the very last shot of the film is completely ridiculous. Can't a
horror or sci-fi movie just end anymore? Do we always need a little
"surprise" two seconds before the end credits roll? It's getting to the
point that I'm surprised when there ISN'T a little twist in the final
moments. Peter Weller ("RoboCop") does his best with what he's given to do,
but it's just not enough to save this mess.</P>
<P>What had potential to become a fun and tense sci-fi flick, is ruined by poor
writing, a depressingly downbeat tone, and very cheesy special effects. The
lack of good writing can somewhat be blamed on the author of the short story
on which the film is based, Phillip K. Dick, who is also responsible for the
equally bleak and unentertaining "Blade Runner".</P>
