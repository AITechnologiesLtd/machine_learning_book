<PRE>KEEPING THE FAITH
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Edward Norton (FIGHT CLUB), one of the most gifted actors today, shows
that he is just as talented behind the camera as in front of it in his
directorial debut with KEEPING THE FAITH, a film in which he stars along
with Ben Stiller (THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY) and Jenna Elfman (EDTV
and "Dharma & Greg").</P>
<P>Most actors, even some of the best ones, play essentially the same
character in every movie. Edward Norton is a true acting chameleon who
becomes completely different people in every part he plays.</P>
<P>In KEEPING THE FAITH, Norton plays Father Brian Finn, a sweet and
innocent Catholic priest with a pixyish grin. Ben Stiller plays Rabbi
Jacob Schram. The two of them are affectionately referred to as "The God
Squad." They are a lovable duo who pack their respective church and
synagogue with enthusiastic worshipers.</P>
<P>Jenna Elfman plays Anna Reilly, a 100-hour-per-week, workaholic
management consultant, who says God could have made the world in just 3
days if he had gotten her help. The 3 of them were best buddies until
Anna moved away from New York City in the eighth grade. The story
concerns their reuniting when she comes to The Big Apple to work on
temporary assignment. It is at a time in Jacob's life when the elders of
his congregation want him to find a good Jewish woman, something Anna
isn't, to marry.</P>
<P>In a cinematic era in which cynicism rules, KEEPING THE FAITH is that
rarest of movies that celebrate the importance and the joys of faith and
religion. And at a time in which dysfunctionalism is ever-present in
pictures, KEEPING THE FAITH shows the unbounded happiness of a good
romance.</P>
<P>Although the three of them resume their friendship as adult buddies,
their relationship quickly moves beyond that stage. And, when Jacob and
Anna fall in love, it gets complicated fast, especially since they
decide it would be better not to hurt Brian's feelings by telling him.</P>
<P>The script is quite funny, and there isn't a false moment in the movie.
Among the wonderful supporting cast is: Anne Bancroft as Jacob's Jewish
mother, Milos Forman as a wise older priest and Eli Wallach as an older
rabbi with big heart and an open mind. Set in New York City, the movie
is filmed beautifully, and the city's skyscrapers have never looked
lovelier.</P>
<P>The picture's only failing is that Norton makes the mistake of many
first-time directors and falls too much in love with his work, letting
some scenes meander when they should have been crisper.</P>
<P>The joy of KEEPING THE FAITH is contagious. This feel-good movie is a
real charmer with great romantic chemistry among the leads. It makes you
feel happy to be alive.</P>
<P>KEEPING THE FAITH runs 2:05. It is rated PG-13 for some sexuality and
language and would be fine for kids around 11 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, almost 11, loved the movie, giving it a full ****. He
said that it was really funny and that his favorite part was when they
were all in the eighth grade.</P>
