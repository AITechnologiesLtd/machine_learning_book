<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Noted cinematographer Rodrigo Garcia (son of Nobel Prize-winning author
Gabriel Garcia Marquez) makes his directorial debut with this
interesting ensemble drama about contemporary life in southern
California. There are 5 short vignettes where the characters seamlessly
intermesh. There are many cogent small observations made which relate to
seeing one's self and others as they truly are. The film won a prize at
Cannes last year, but still is not released to theaters in this country.
I saw it on its Showtime TV debut.</P>
<P>The first vignette, entitled This Is Dr. Keener, is about a divorced,
childless middle-aged doctor who is looking after her elderly mother and
is disappointed that a workplace doctor she is pursuing, won't return
her phone calls. Dr. Keener (Glenn Close) is stunned by the accurate
comments of a young tarot card reader, Christine (Calista Flockhart),
who exposes her false pretenses at happiness and calls her the great
pretender, who because of her negative behavior ruins her chances at
love. She holds out hope that someone new will come into her life, a
much younger man.</P>
<P>In Fantasies About Rebecca, the vignette I liked the best, an
attractive, self-confident 39-year-old bank manager Rebecca (Holly
Hunter) learns that she is pregnant. When she tells her longtime,
married boyfriend (Gregory Hines), it is tacitly agreed that she will
not have the baby. While waiting for the abortion operation, she has a
spontaneous fling with an office assistant, Walter (Matt Craven). After
she has the abortion, performed by Dr. Keener, she breaks down in tears
in the street, as her painful life hits home and she realizes that it is
more than likely she will never have a child.</P>
<P>In Someone for Rose, a divorced, middle-aged children's book author
(Kathy Baker), is surprised to find herself romantically interested in
her new neighbor (Danny Woodburn), a very outspoken and articulate
dwarf, who works as a hospital bookkeeper. Rose's renewed sexual
interest coincides with her learning that her teenage son (Fleiss) had a
sexual encounter.</P>
<P>In the fourth vignette, Good Night Lilly, Good Night Christine, Calista
Flockhart's character reappears as the lover to the dying Lilly
(Valerina Golino). The girls go over how they met and fell in love, and
how meaningful their romance was.</P>
<P>The final vignette, Love Waits for Kathy, concerns the relationship
between Kathy, a sexually frustrated police detective, and her blind and
beautiful sister Carol (Cameron Diaz), who deals with her disability
with self-confidence, humor and a great awareness of life. Carol notices
by scent the man she is dating as she is waiting by the elevator of an
office building, and he notices her and walks by without saying hello,
which tells her all that she needs to know about what kind of person he
is. Kathy meets a colleague (Miguel  Sandoval) on the job and decides to
date him, while Carol deals with her own problems without self-pity.</P>
<P>Garcia keeps these stories provocative and moving at a fast-pace. This
is a smart film that gets amazing characterizations from all the
actresses, each giving a wonderfully nuanced performance exhibiting
inexplicable and heartfelt emotions.</P>
