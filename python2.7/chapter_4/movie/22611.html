<PRE>`Magnolia' Blossoms for Some Critics but May Wilt for
the Average Moviegoer
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Have you ever watched an advertisement on late night
TV, perhaps an infomercial, and wondered how those
guys could actually be the dynamos that they seem to
be.  I remember the incredulous pitches for how to
make millions in real estate.  The speaker would say
how he was once a penniless immigrant but now had
amassed a fortune.  With an ounce of ambition and his
tutelage, you too could earn enough to purchase
oceanfront property, a yacht, and a slew of exotic
cars.</P>
<P>In `Magnolia,' there is another such dynamo named
Frank Mackey (Tom Cruise).  With his high-powered
charisma, his ads boast that he can win over the
hearts of any woman.   And, if you come to his
seminar, he'll teach you all of his secrets.  Just
call 1-877-TAME HER and he'll show you all of his
tricks including how to feign sincerity and how to
make her fulfill your every desire.  This is truly a
person that has feigned much like the
once-penniless-immigrant-turned real-estate-mogul. 
The life that he has created is a manifestation of
terrific imagination.  He has worked hard to develop
an identity for others to see.  He says the right
things, wears the right clothes, and talks to the
right people.  But his whole life is nothing but a
fragile foundation of vanity and buried secrets. 
Unlock those secrets, and his foundation crumbles. 
What would make Frank's foundation crumble?  Perhaps
it will be an inquisitive reporter.  Or, it may be
confronting a father that had abandoned him but now
lies on his deathbed.  Neither Frank nor anyone else
can ever be prepared for such a jolt.</P>
<P>Frank's is one of many stories that are happening
simultaneously in the world of `Magnolia.'  Several
interlocking vignettes are at play, and all of them
are variations on a theme.  Julianne Moore plays a
neurotic and faithless wife.  Veteran game show host
Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker Hall) has just learned that
he is suffering from cancer and doesn't have long to
live.  An overeager father (Michael Bowen) maddeningly
drives his son to excel.  Former whiz kid Donnie Smith
(William H. Macy) is a pathetic loser who thinks that
braces will help him secure the love of a muscular
bartender.  And there's also a caring officer (John C.
Reilly) who falls in love with a drug addict. 
Foundation shaking events will occur for all of the
characters. </P>
<P>Structurally, this is a very good film.  Despite it
being a film where many of the characters are related
by coincidence, the film does an excellent job making
sure that all of the various story lines are working
in unison.  In fact, the middle hour showcases some of
this year's most energetic and extroverted acting
scenes, especially Cruise as the cocksure sex guru and
Moore as the unstable housewife.  And this why critics
will rally around this kind of film.  It's certainly
ambitious work and worthy of a nomination for Director
Paul Thomas Anderson.</P>
<P>However, my job is not to extol its production values
(which it has plenty of), but to let you know whether
this is a film that most of us would find
entertaining.  And to that, I would have to say ‘no'. 
This is an Oscar-seeking melodrama, filled with
emotion, deathbed scenes and turbulence.  These
threads also converge in a way that I could not
understand, and should you wish to see this film, I
will have to let you draw your own conclusions.  As
for my own opinion, this is a 3-hour film that is
recommended to only the most avid moviegoers who like
their films to be a bravura combination of absurdity,
innovation and chance.  That's not me.</P>
