<PRE>ANACONDA</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  *1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Well, what are you going to expect?  It's a movie about a big snake
that eats people.  That's what I should have been thinking when I
viewed this film, because maybe then I would have enjoyed myself more.
Instead, I ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me,
too.</P>
<P>ANACONDA is about a documentary film crew sailing down a South
American river.  Led by anthropologists Dr. Steven Cale (Eric Stolz)
and Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez), the crew is attempting to locate a
lost tribe of natives.  Along the way, they find poacher Paul Sarone
(Jon Voight), and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture
the elusive anaconda.  To simply say that this is the world's largest
snake wouldn't be doing it justice, since the anaconda in this movie
is at least two feet wide.  If this isn't a good reason to avoid
picking up hitchhikers, I don't know what is.</P>
<P>At the beginning of ANACONDA, we find that Flores and Cale have had
some kind of relationship in the past, but that seems to be more or
less over now.  I expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down
the line, but it ended up being a set-up for nothing.  Cale chokes on
a deadly wasp (don't ask me how that happens - I don't know) and is
put out of action, relegated to being the person whom the rest of the
film crew must get back to civilization for medical help.  This
minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot, since this
goal now comes in direct conflict with Sarone's plan to capture the
snake.  However, this is negated by the fact that Cale seems to get
better by himself about halfway through the film, and in any event
still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle.</P>
<P>Most bad characters are either annoying or stupid.  In this movie,
they're both.  Since this description applies to all the characters
except Sarone, it's hard to find someone to root for.  You're supposed
to back the good guys, but you really end up cheering for Sarone
because he's smarter than everyone else.  Or maybe he's just not as
dumb as everyone else.  At times, I almost found myself rooting for
the snake.</P>
<P>There are no standout performances here.  Everyone seems to be
reciting lines written for stock characters.  Even Voight appears to
be doing his best impression of Christopher Walken for some reason.</P>
<P>No matter, as in most monster movies, the snake is supposed to be the
real star anyway.  In most of the scenes, the snake is computer
generated, and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look
real.  However, the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic
occurrences.  Sometimes, for example, the snake just moves too fast.
It catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall, for crying out loud.
Then there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters,
and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can
see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly.
Absolutely ridiculous.</P>
<P>A testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene
early on the in the film, where we get to see just how dangerous the
mighty anaconda is.  In a scene totally unrelated to anything else, we
are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther.  The
anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a
stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard, one of the panther's eyeballs
pops out.  Eeeewwwww.  Above and beyond the sick factor, however, this
scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake
before a quarter of the movie had even passed.  In films like these, a
sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained.  If the
characters are reacting to something they fear more than see, we as an
audience must experience that feeling along with them.  To show us the
monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't
know about, and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before
the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown.
In a case like that, the showdown just ends up being a letdown.  When
I saw the snake for the first time, I decided to give the film the
benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake I saw wasn't the REAL
danger.  This one was just a decoy, and there was actually a BIGGER
snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they
were safe.  No such luck.  Okay, maybe ANACONDA is actually a decoy,
and there's really a BETTER movie waiting to make its debut.</P>
