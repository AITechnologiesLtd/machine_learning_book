<PRE>TITANIC</PRE>
<PRE>A Review by Robert Strong</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart,
Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, Frances Fisher, Bill Paxton, Suzy Amis, 
Danny Nucci, Victor Garber, and David Warner</P>
<PRE>Directed by James Cameron</PRE>
<PRE>Rated PG-13</PRE>
<PRE>***** out of *****</PRE>
<P>Once every so often a film is made that transcends all bounds,
breaks all records, shatters all conventions, and then makes
new ones.  The last movie to do so was STAR WARS.  Twenty
years later, one has been made again.  It is TITANIC.
Clocking in at 194 minutes, you would never know it from
the way it is paced and presented.  The film is absolutely
astounding.</P>
<P>A brief plot summary will follow.  Brief, because if you
don't know it by now, you've been living in a cave on 
Mars with your eyes shut and your fingers in your ears.
A penniless artist (Leonardo DiCaprio) falls in love 
with a high-born rich girl (Kate Winslet).  She is
unhappily engaged to a snob (Billy Zane) and has a
shrewish mother (Frances Fisher).  They are all passengers
on the famously huge, but ill-fated, ocean liner Titanic.
The film also has modern day pieces, of Rose, now
100 years of age (Gloria Stuart), telling her story to a 
sleazy treasure hunter (Bill Paxton) who is looking on
Titanic for a fabulously expensive jewel that Rose once wore 
on the ship.  Clear?  Great.</P>
<P>The performances are all uniformly excellent.  The 
characters are real and vibrant.  You know them and 
feel sadness and joy as they do.  Of particular note
are DiCaprio, Winslet, Stuart, and Bates.  Director James
Cameron really has created a triumph.  All the pieces
fall into place beautifully.  He has wisely kept the
ship and all the effects that go with it in the background,
rather then make them the main characters.  Still,
they work, and work well.  Plus, Cameron injects some 
moments of humor to keep the movie from becoming flat
out depressing.</P>
<P>But, what I liked best about TITANIC were the little 
touches.  The exquisite attention to detail.  The
shot of the ship's designer, Andrews (Victor Garber), 
as he winds the clock as his creation falls apart around 
him.  The priest giving absolution as the ship turns 
upright and people fall away all around him.  The
mother putting her children to bed and the old couple
together as water pours in around him.  Benjamin
Guggenheim, one of the richest men on earth, putting
on his finest clothes and asking for a brandy as
he and his manservant prepare "to go down like men."
And, of course, James Horner's hauntingly beautiful
score.  The shots of the Titanic as it sinks, in the middle
of the big, black ocean, even it dwarfed by the water 
around it.  All of these are extremely powerful images
that only add to an already wonderful movie.</P>
<P>I can't end this review without commenting on the last
scene, which is my absolute favorite.  It is so haunting
and beautiful that it will stick with you long after you
have seen it.  If you are unclear as to when I consider
the end scene to begin, it is when the camera begins to
show all of Old Rose's pictures.  </P>
<P>Now, I will list the film's flaws.  Several moments of 
bad dialogue and some effects that you can tell are 
effects.  Some people have criticized the plot as being
formulaic, but as Roger Ebert said, "...you don't use
the most expensive movie in history as your opportunity
to reinvent the wheel."</P>
<P>But, then again, CITIZEN KANE had flaws too.</P>
