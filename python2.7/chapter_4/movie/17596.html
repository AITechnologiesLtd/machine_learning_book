<P>Have you ever wanted to go back to high school and try to relive some of the
moments that you missed, knowing all of the things that you know now? Well,
Drew Barrymore gets that opportunity in this teenage flick that continues to
propagate Hollywood's love affair with all things young, beautiful and
teen-oriented.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Rookie newspaper reporter is placed undercover in a high school to write an
article about the "kids of today". Having been a major nerd in her high
school days, Josie (Barrymore) tries to adapt to the hip, young kids, but
finds the transition just as painful as it was in her original days.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Generic, unoriginal, mildly amusing comedy, offers very little in laugh-out
loud humor, but does give us several dynamic performances, and some
surprisingly tender moments. Granted, there are only a handful of films
coming out nowadays that offer much in original thought (RAVENOUS (7.5/10)
is one of the few that plops right into my head), but a few wise-cracks
about Archie, Betty and Veronica, do not a hip and unique script make.
Fortunately for this film, it doesn't bore us, isn't too long, and it does
give us a somewhat original ending, with a countdown conclusion that is
definitely unique. Garry Marshall was also very funny in all of his scenes,
but regrettably, he's only in a few of them. David Arquette also steals some
thunder in his role as the older brother, and Molly Shannon has at least one
interesting sequence in a classroom.</P>
<P>Kudos go to Drew Barrymore for allowing herself to look this bad for this
movie (Except in the prom scene, in which she looks absolutely stunning in
that medieval dress). She is the ultimate geek, but I found her character to
be a little too unbelievable and dorky. It seemed like she was made to be
the ultimate loser, but I didn't buy it. I also didn't appreciate any of the
other "geeks" and "hipsters" in her high school, because they were all drawn
out of the same one-dimensional chalkboard that all of these teenage movies
seem to manufacture. And this is despite Leelee Sobieski's solid performance
as the head-geek. Add an upbeat soundtrack, a good-looking Luke
Perry-wannabee teacher by the way of newcomer Michael Vartan, and you've got
yourself another teenage high school movie of the week, with a sweet ending,
forgettable characters, and what seemed like more drama than laughs. Your
video machine will appreciate it, but your hard-earned bucks at the movie
theatre will not. Oh yeah, and if anyone in Hollywood is listening, I think
it's time to start slowing down the teen-flick machine. Me thinks it's
starting to bubble over.</P>
<P>NOTE: One thing that was truly original about this movie was its closing
credits. Alongside all of the names of the folks in the film, a high school
picture of their days of young. Cute, if you dig that kind of thing.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actress Drew Barrymore also served as the executive producer of this film.
Flower Films is her production company. Her middle name is Blythe and she is
godmother to Courtney Love's daughter Frances Bean.

Actor Michael Vartan was born in Paris to a French father and an American
mother. He grew up in the tiny Normandy village of Fleury (pop. 300) until
the age of 18 when he moved to Los Angeles to live with his mother. Soon
thereafter, he enrolled in acting classes and started working both here and
in France. He speaks both English and French fluently.
Garry Marshall, who plays Barrymore's boss in this film, is a film director
