 Director:  Peter Hyams
 Writer:  Gene Quintano, novel "The Three Musketeers" by
Alexandre Dumas pere
 Cast: Catherine Deneuve, Mena Suvari, Stephen Rea, Tim Roth, 
 Screened at: Sony Lincoln Sq. NYC 9/4/01</P>
<P>   When Rudyard Kipling exclaimed in 1889, "Oh East is East and
West is West and never the twain shall meet," he could not have
seen Peter Hyams swashbuckler, "The Musketeer,"  but
somehow he must have known that if director/cinematographer
Peter Hyams were to attempt a marriage of the Western
swordplay in the classic Dumas pere tale with Eastern
oscillations, a swift divorce would follow.  For this version of the
action drama situated in Seventeenth Century France, Hyams
seeks to put his original spin by piggy-backing on the wild
success of Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," but
instead of employing crackerjack choreographer Yuen Wo-Ping--
who performed similar chores on "The Matrix"--he utilizes the
talents of the second-tier dance-director Xin-Xin Xiong, whose
claims to fame include jobs as stunt-and-action coordinator on
"Time and Tide," "The Blacksheep Affair," and "Double Team."</P>
<P>   If East does not meet West in "The Musketeer," all would not
be lost.  Unfortunately, the film is as tasteful and inspiring as a
17th Century French crepe served at Lutece restaurant in the
year 2001.  Not that swashbuckling is necessarily outdated
today, particularly when there's a whole generation of young
movie buffs who never had the pleasure of watching Errol Flynn
before he deteriorated into the murk and fog of illegal drugs,
heavy drinking and chain smoking when still in his forties,  or
Tyrone Power, who could have used his incredible good looks to
bring "Solomon and Sheba" to life had he not died in Madrid
while filming the Biblical epic.  What's wrong with this version is
just about everything: there are narrative gaps, inane
performances by actors who mumble their words as though
thinking appropriately enough in French but verbalizing in
English, poor scripting, an editing nightmare, generic music, lazy
direction, and ho-hum choreography.</P>
<P>   What should give the Dumas classic--as interpreted in as
shallow a manner as possible by Gene Quintano's screenplay--
its verve, its pizazz, its charm would be a more than simply perky
performance by the lead actor in the role a guy with aspirations to
become the most famous of King Louis XIII's elite guard,
D'Artagnan.  But when Justin Chambers, spotted for his more
appropriate role in Barry Levinson's "Liberty Heights," says the
most famous of Dumas's line, "All for one and one for all," the
audience would not be blamed for thinking he's talking about the
weather.  Though he has boyish good looks, he's hardly the
magnetic type that would appeal instantly to the equally
antiseptic Mena Suvari in the role of the French queen's
chambermaid, Francesca, but who was born instead to excel in
the more suitable guise of the object of Kevin Spacey's lust in
"American Beauty."  As Francesca, Ms. Suvari comes across in
this modernized adaptation as a liberated woman who, when
accidentally spotted naked in her bathtub by a blushing
D'Artagnan, teases, "Haven't you ever seen a naked woman
before?"  Yet she turns flush when D'Artagnan in a moment of
forgetfulness appears to her in frontal nudity (his back to us in
the audience) and turns around, shocked, though not without
some admiration of the man's supposed accoutrements.</P>
<P>   "The Musketeer" begins when young D'Artagnan witnesses the
violent death of his unarmed father, a former musketeer, in the
arms of the vicious Febre (Tim Roth--who is terrific and  the only
fellow in this film worth watching).  Vowing to seek revenge, he
gets his chance fourteen years later as a grown man seeking
admittance to the legion of the king's guards.  "The Musketeer"
turns road-and-buddy movie as D'Artagnan begins his odyssey
to Paris (the southwestern French town of Sarlat standing for the
City of Lights in the 1600's).  Meeting up with a less-than-colorful
stack of opponents, he cuts his way to the capital, searches out
Aramis (Nick Moran), Athos (Jan Gregor Kremp) and Porthos
(Steve Speirs), the most elite of the elite guards, finding them
demoralized, without commission.  Allying up with Francesca, he
moves to save the queen--who has been captured by the
conscience-less Febre.</P>
<P>   You come to a movie like this for swordfights, but instead of
seeing an Errol Flynn duplicating his first swashbuckling role in
Michael Curtiz's 1935 film "Captain Blood," we get the usual
MTV-style editing backed up by David Arnold's incredibly banal
score, with the result that we wonder why Mr. Chambers needed
to develop his fencing talent for a whole month as he claims to
have done.  Nor do we quite understand the role of Cardinal
Richelieu (Stephen Rea--who was a lot better in his Irish roles 
such as "Danny Boy" and "Michael Collins and in his element in
"The Crying Game").  Worst of all is the role spun out by director
Hyams for the great Catherine Deneuve, given first credit despite
her minuscule part as the queen of France--who at one point
disguises herself as a commoner, plays cards with the
unwashed, and knocks over one of her enemies with her bare
hands and legs.  Deneuve, already smarting from being woefully
miscast as a factory worker in Lars von Trier's "Dance in the
Dark," does not help her rep any in this travesty.</P>
<P>   Go ahead.  See the movie, then rent a video of "Captain
Blood," and watch how Errol Flynn, also in his first role as a
fencer, is shown in a better light fifty-six years ago than Hyams is
able to conjure up with all of today's special effects techniques at
his disposal.</P>
