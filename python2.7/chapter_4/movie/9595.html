<PRE>LIAR LIAR (1997)
A film review by Nick Schaden
Copyright 1997 Nick Schaden</PRE>
<P>   Jim Carrey's career catapulted onto the movie scene with  the powerhouse
"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective", "The Mask", and "Dumb & Dumber".  He's the
kind of guy that you tend to either love or hate.   For this reviewer, I've
gotten sick of Jim Carrey's humor - he can't break out of his shell of
sophomoric, repetitive gags.   However, Carrey has greatly improved since
his major start in 1994.   While "Liar Liar" doesn't make for a higher
quality comedy, it certainly is passable entertainment and has its high
moments.</P>
<P>   "Liar Liar" has a standard comedic plot: it breaks the rules of reality
for humor.   Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) fits the definition of "sleazy
lawyer" perfectly: he ignores his son, he rather would sleep with the
company boss (to become a partner of the firm, no less) than spend time with
his family, and sleazes and deceives people to get further up the corporate
ladder.   In frustration, his son makes a wish at his birthday party that
Fletcher wouldn't lie for just one day.   Thus lies one of the larger
weaknesses of this movie - the humor is largely a one gag trick.   Every
joke in the movie ties in how Fletcher simply can't lie, and it the gag gets
old rather quickly.</P>
<P>   Furthermore, Carrey has to learn that more isn't necessarily better - his
goofball over the top antics ruin many of the jokes running throughout "Liar
Liar".  Carrey has to learn that more doesn't mean necessarily better.</P>
<P>   However, "Liar Liar" certainly does have its strengths.   For example,
Carrey for, is more controlled in this movie than others.   In addition, the
movie is can be fun at times, several of the courtroom jokes in the latter
half of the film make for some good entertainment.</P>
<P>   By the end, I left "Liar Liar" with a smile on my face - Jim Carrey
actually had starred in a watchable and moderately funny movie.  However,
largely due to the one-horse plot and Carrey's outlandish acting style - the
movie falls slightly below average.</P>
<PRE>    Nick's Rating: -1</PRE>
<P>    *** Movies rated from -4 (worst) to +4 (best), 0=average movie ***</P>
