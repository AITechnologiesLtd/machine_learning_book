                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>95 min., R, Horror, 1992
Director: Manny Coto
Cast: Larry Drake, Holly Marie Combs, Glenn Quinn, Cliff De Young,
      Richard Bradford, Michelle Johnson, Keith Diamond, Denise Barnes</P>
<P>     When Larry Drake was a child, his father was a doctor and his
mother was dying from heart problems.  Drake's father lost it and
started killing the residents of a town for their hearts, to save his
wife.  Drake's father was killed by the occupants of the town and Drake,
who helped his father, escaped.  Now, many years later, Drake is coming
back to the town, as a doctor, to get a bloody revenge.  Holly Marie
Combs is having heart problems and may have to have an operation.  Her
boyfriend is generally causing her problems and her father Cliff De
Young, whose wife just died in an operation, is seeing rather young
Michelle Johnson.  All this is putting considerable strain on Combs
heart.  Then Drake, Dr. Giggles, shows up in her life.</P>
<P>     DR. GIGGLES is a humorous horror film.  It almost seemed to be a
parody of modern horror films, but just when I started to get that
feeling, the film reminded me that it wasn't.  I definitely don't
recommend this film to those with a weak stomach.  I do, however,
recommend this film to any fan of horror films.  On a scale of zero to
five, I give DR. GIGGLES a four.  DR. GIGGLES is rated R for explicit
language, adult situations, and graphic violence.</P>
<P>     The cast for this film is relatively well known for a horror film.
Larry Drake (DARKMAN, MURDER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE: THE PAMELA WOJAS SMART
STORY) was perfect in the title role.  He has this look that can be
rather spooky (especially behind a bloody saw).  Holly Marie Combs
(BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, "Picket Fences") also does a great job.  I
found myself caring more for her character than I usually do at a horror
film.  I found her character to be above the typical "horror movie
bimbo".  Glenn Quinn ("Roseanne," "Covington Cross") does a relatively
good job as Combs's boyfriend.  He didn't look like he gave all that he
could for his role, however.  Cliff De Young (SECRET ADMIRER, RUDE
AWAKENING, SHOCK TREATMENT), I think, gave the weakest performance in
the film.  He wasn't on screen for very much, and when he was on, I got
nothing from his character.  Michelle Johnson (BLAME IT ON RIO, WAXWORK,
as well as some small roles in the recent films DEATH BECOMES HER and
FAR AND AWAY), also gave a reasonable performance.  I will never figure
out why she made the beginning credits since her role was rather short.
Because of this, no real characterization was created for her character
and it was hard to feel one way or another for her.</P>
<P>     There aren't many gory scenes in this film, but for the most part,
the few that there are turn out to be really good ones.  The special
effects for the film are very well done.  The script is well written
and interesting.  The film doesn't fall into too many of the typical
slasher film cliches, although the ending could have been improved, as
it was too predictable.  The director Manny Coto, who I think is a first
time director, does a great job.  The sets that are used are excellent.
I especially like how the old doctor's house was made to look on the
inside.</P>
