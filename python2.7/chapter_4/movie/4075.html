<PRE>                             A MONTH BY THE LAKE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Take a base of ENCHANTED APRIL, a little of THE POSTMAN, maybe
some MEDITERRANEO, throw them together, and what do you get?  A mess,
to be sure, and I'm guessing it the result is something like A MONTH BY
THE LAKE, John Irvin's new film about two star-crossed lovers who find
romance in their "golden years."</P>
<P>     Vanessa Redgrave and Edward Fox play the leads of Miss Beaumont
and Major Paulo, aging British singles who vacation at a lake in 1937
Italy, just before World War II.  The pair soon discover each other:
She is a headstrong photographer.  He is a crusty businessman who
dabbles in sleight-of-hand.  Clearly, they are meant for each other,
and a love/hate relationship develops on the spot.  As the romance
progresses, the two abuse and play off each other's insecurities so
well, you'd think they really were a couple.  When youngsters Miss
Bentley (Uma Thurman) and Vittorio enter the picture and complicate
matters, the film becomes a game of sly cat and mouse, where you never
know who is chasing after whom.</P>
<P>     The fundamental problem is that A MONTH BY THE LAKE is supposed to
be a romance, but the emotions of love are dreadfully lacking from all
the players, probably because Trevor Bentham's spare script doesn't
provide any room for these feelings.  As far as I could tell, the
supreme act that pushes Miss Beaumont head over heels for the Major is
the fact that he sends her flowers as a peace offering over one of
their spats.  It just isn't that easy.  Most of the time, the two seem
to hate each other, and in all honesty, the Major is a big jerk.  When
Miss Beaumont falls for him, it's really kind of depressing.</P>
<P>     That aside, the film is well-made and has some funny moments,
particularly when the principals are acting spiteful.  Also, the
picture's true worth comes out in its theme of the impending war and in
making us feel that this idyllic lakeside village is doomed when the
inevitable bombing begins.  I don't know if that was the message they
were shooting for when making a romance, but that's what they got, and
ultimately, this unexpected power is what makes the film worthwhile.</P>
