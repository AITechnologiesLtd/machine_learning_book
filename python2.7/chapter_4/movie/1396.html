<PRE>                                  PATRIOT GAMES
                       A film review by Sarah M. Elkins
                        Copyright 1992 Sarah M. Elkins</PRE>
<P>PATRIOT GAMES: "prequel" to THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER; based on the novel
by Tom Clancy (which I have not read).</P>
<P>Plot/kick-off:        The kickoff was one of the most exciting parts of the movie to
me, so I'll skip it and just say Jack Ryan and his family become the
targets of an IRA splinter group of terrorists.  He enlists the aid of
the CIA for protection.</P>
<P>Characters/acting: very different from THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.
Harrison Ford plays Ryan believably and with charm.  Anne Archer looks
beautifully vulnerable, but what with her similar roles in *Narrow
Margin* and *Fatal Attraction*, I could have used a new face or or maybe
more attention in the script for her jep role.  Patrick Bergen is
competent as the leader of the terrorists; I liked the actress who
played his terrorist girlfriend but didn't think her disguise made much
sense.  James Earle Jones was the only actor also in THE HUNT FOR RED
OCTOBER.</P>
<P>Cinematography/FX: A couple of good chase scenes; I thought the most
unique scene in the movie was the live satellite observation.</P>
<P>Score/Sound: didn't much notice, though I thought the music was familiar
(not from THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER; from some other movie/score).</P>
<P>Violence: Lots of bullets flying and some hitting; a few bloody faces;
not a lot of gore compared with many recent action movies</P>
<PRE>Language: some profanity</PRE>
<P>Skin/situations: one scene with a couple in bed, male nude mostly
covered by mostly-undressed female; not long or graphic</P>
<P>Analysis: decent thriller, no major flaws, but a bit predictable.  I
would have cut out most of the scenes from the terrorists' viewpoints,
and perhaps put in more of the analysis work that Ryan and the CIA must
have done.</P>
