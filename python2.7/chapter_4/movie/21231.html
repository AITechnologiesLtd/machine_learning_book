<P>In February, I said that no film this year could possibly be worse than
the thoroughly unwatchable _Six_Ways_to_Sunday_.  Well, I take that back.
 The sophomore directorial effort of Harmony Korine (whose 1997 debut,
_Gummo_, is the epitome of love-hate films) is one steaming, smelly pile
of cinematic excrement.  Much has been made that this "film" (using that
term very loosely) is the first American production to be made under
Dogme 95--the commandments of cinematic "purity" created by Danish
filmmakers Lars Von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, among others-- but
slapping on such a label doesn't excuse Korine's sloppy, downright
incoherent filmmaking.  You know you're in trouble when the synopsis
provided in the film's press notes in no way resembles what you see on
screen.  Purportedly, the film is about the "internal struggle" of
schizophrenic julien (Ewen Bremner), which "increases in intensity until
the film's shocking and bizarrely transcendent conclusion."</P>
<P>Now, this is what I saw for 94 long, seemingly endless minutes: scenes
of Bremner jumping up and down and speaking incoherently; scenes of
julien's pregnant sister Pearl (Chloë Sevigny) dancing ballet and playing
the harp; wordless scenes of a young blind figure skater (Chrissy
Kobylak) doing a routine; and, most memorably, julien's father (Werner
Herzog) hosing down and belittling julien's brother Chris (Evan Neumann)
into becoming "a champion"--that is, whenever not chugging cough syrup
and listening to records while wearing a gas mask.  To say that none of
it adds up would be to imply a natural connection between scenes that
isn't there.  The herky-jerky Dogme camera movements and grainy film
stock just makes the film look more like--and thereby confirm--what it
is: pure garbage.</P>
