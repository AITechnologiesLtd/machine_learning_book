<PRE>The Perfect Storm </PRE>
<P>Take all the action and adventure of a guy's summer popcorn flick and combine 
it with all the teary drama
of a sensitive, autumn Oscar-contender and that's what you've got with "The 
Perfect Storm." It's the story
of a small New England fishing boat and its scrappy crew who go out into 
uncharted waters and must race
two hurricanes back to the coast. </P>
<P>The story is pretty predictable so it's up to the screenplay and the SFX 
department to make the film work
and they manage to pull it off pretty well. The first half is an enjoyable 
lighthearted drama that sets up all
the characters and their admirable qualities (in other words - blatant 
foreshadowing). The second half is
non-stop action as the crew must navigate through terrible weather in the 
middle of the ocean. There's also
a sub-plot involving the coast guard and how they rescue people in terrible 
storms like this. It has
absolutely nothing to do with the main story but it's a nice touch. </P>
<P>Overall it's a touching movie in that "Titanic" sort of way. It's got 
something for everyone. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B </PRE>
