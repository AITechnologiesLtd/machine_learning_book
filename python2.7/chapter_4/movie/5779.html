<P>     A live-action Pinocchio made without Walt?  Jiminey Cricket!  The
first half of this Carlo Collodi adaptation is not without its charms:
the storybook look of Geppetto's village, shot on location in Prague;
nice underplaying by Martin Landau as the lonely puppet maker; Rob
Schneider and Bebe Neuwirth hamming it up as the minor villains Fox and
Cat; and the near-seamless special effects that bring a certain wooden
boy (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas) to life.  While darker than the
animated version, the drama is still decidedly kid-powered, such as a
scene placing Pinocchio in peril on, gasp!, a rooftop.  The period
detail is also very nice, as is one fabulously photographed scene, at a
courthouse, where the costumes and the murals blend together.</P>
<P>     The movie takes a sour turn in the second half, during a hideous
production number that attempts to blend musical styles spanning a
couple of centuries.  This shrill, dissonant mess signals the beginning
of the end.  The movie never recovers from that misstep, despite such
interesting imagery as boys changing into jackasses and sea monsters
swallowing boats whole.  Pepe, the cricket-with-a- conscience, is also
on hand, albeit in computer-generated form.  He's voiced by David Doyle,
who, regrettably, makes no references to either whistling or wishing
upon a star.  And how about those tuneless tunes by Stevie Wonder and
Brian May?  Woof!  This version of PINOCCHIO may be quite the kids
movie, but the rest of us should stay put until Thanksgiving, when
Disney's 101 DALMATIONS is due.  Directed by Steve Barron.  </P>
