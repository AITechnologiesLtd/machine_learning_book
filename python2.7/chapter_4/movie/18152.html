THE DARK HALF
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Success of Stephen King's literary career was such that the
writer himself couldn't resist to be inspired by that
phenomenon. He wrote two novels on the subject - MISERY and
THE DARK HALF. The latter one was inspired by the real
events of King's career - discovery of his early four
novels, written under pseudonym "Richard Bachman". As
anything King ever put on paper, that novel was adapted to
screen. The 1993 film was written and directed by George A.
Romero, filmmaker whose classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING GENRE
created a cult following among horror movie fans.</P>
<P>Protagonist of the film is Thad Beaumont (Timothy Hutton),
literature professor whose own writing is failure. But, few
people, including Thad's loving and supportive wife Liz (Amy
Madigan) know a secret - Beaumont, under the pseudonym
"George Stark" wrote whole series of graphic, violent novels
that turned to be best-sellers. One day, facing blackmail,
Beaumont decides to go public, reveal true identity of
"George Stark" and stop writing those novels. After the
symbolic burial of "George Stark" his life should turn to
normal, but, instead, first the blackmailer, than his own
publisher and few other people fall prey to vicious serial
killer. Sheriff Alan Pangborn (Michael Rooker) discovers
evidence pointing to the writer's complicity, but Beaumont
claims that the murders were committed by "George Stark" who
somehow turned into living flesh and wants to have his life
and writing career back.</P>
<P>Many screen adaptations of King failed because even the most
talented directors simply couldn't process richness and
complexity of King's prose into cinematic language. In this
film Romero tried to evade this by making a longer film,
with the plot slowly unfolding, thus allowing development of
atmosphere and characters. That also gave room for
exploration of few themes - like existence of "dark halves"
in every personality, and sometimes blurring boundaries
between the author, his work and the outsiders' perception
of both. Unfortunately, the link between supernatural
segments in the beginning and the end haven't been properly
explained. So, most of the time we watch standard
psychological thriller about mad slasher/split personality,
with mystic elements being somewhat out of place. The
finale, that in King's adaptations usually turns into cheap
schlockfest, is very original and spectacular in this film.
The actors did very good job, especially Timothy Hutton in
an interesting double role. Amy Madigan was good as his
wife, and Michael Rooker was very believable as sympathetic
lawman. All in all, although not very successful, THE DARK
HALF is one of the better adaptations of King, that could be
enjoyed even by those who aren't fans of his literature.</P>
