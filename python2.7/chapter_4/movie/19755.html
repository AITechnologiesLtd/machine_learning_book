<PRE>                             THE HAUNTING
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: What starts as a new version of THE
          HAUNTING mixes in aspects of THE UNINVITED and THE
          LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE.  Eventually director Jan de
          Bont gives in to the temptation to excess and his
          film turns into POLTERGEIST.  Still enough is worth
          seeing here, particularly for the beautiful
          production design by Eugenio Zanetti.  Jan de Bont
          was the wrong person to direct, but the film still
          succeeds in raising gooseflesh thanks in large part
          to the atmosphere created by Zanetti. Rating: 7 (0
          to 10), low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     For me there are three ghost stories on film that I would put in
my first tier-these are the best.  Those are THE UNINVITED, THE
INNOCENTS, and THE HAUNTING (1963).  The second tier would include THE
LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, and THE LADY IN WHITE.  There
would probably be a few others.  The third tier would probably include
POLTERGEIST, effective but a little soul-less.  In interviews about the
new THE HAUNTING from The Dreamworks, this second film based on the
novel THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE by Shirley Jackson, director Jan de
Bont (SPEED, TWISTER) said that he was not really approaching this as a
horror film. What he wanted was to make was a different sort of action
film. Audiences are tired of traditional crime action films, but not
many have been done as horror.  Given that that is the case, it is
remarkable that the new THE HAUNTING is as good as it is at raising
gooseflesh.  For now I would put it in the second tier.  I may or may
not feel that positive on the film in five years.  Time and again de
Bont does wrong what director Robert Wise did so very right in the 1963
version.  Part of what made the original film effective is that the
main character was weak.  We could empathize with her rather than
admire her and we saw the film from inside her head, even to the point
of hearing her thoughts. The horror in the 1963 version is almost all
heard rather than seen. There is just a hint that is visual that any of
this is really happening.  Wise had to use very three-dimensional
characters to make the people and the threat to them seem real.
Today's younger action audience might not have responded to that, so
instead de Bont gives us some strong characters and the scariest
haunted house money can buy. There are more special effects in the
trailer to the new film than Wise put into the entirety of his version.</P>
<P>     Eleanor Lance (played by Lili Taylor) gets an invitation to be
part of a sleep study by Dr. Jeffrey Marrow (Liam Neeson).  The study
will have her staying in a huge old mansion dating back to 1837.  The
house was built by a textile magnate and was the scene of much
unhappiness. Eleanor's fellow test subjects include the seductive
Theodora (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and the irreverent Luke Sannerson (Owen
Wilson).  What none of the subjects knows is that the study is not
about sleep but about fear.  Marrow is intentionally putting them into
a frightening house to observe their reaction.  As Marrow says "you
don't tell the rats the rats will be in a maze."  But the house may be
scarier than he realizes. Even Marrow does not know the full history of
evil in this house or of the spirits of the original master among
others who still make the house their home.  While starting with the
plot from the book and the original film, this plot goes off in some
new directions.  Jerry Goldsmith makes his own comment on the profusion
of haunting phenomena we see in this film by starting his end-credit
music with a carnival theme.</P>
<P>     There are far too many touches in this film that just seem weak
after having seen the Robert Wise version (two nights earlier, in
fact).  In the original the groundskeeper and housekeeper seem to have
been taken over by the spirit of the house and themselves seem to be a
bit haunted. In this version they just come off as mean.  Bruce Dern
plays the groundskeeper as just his usual nasty, bullying character.
It is not as effective as weaker-than-the-house characters in the
original.  But de Bont has a hard time doing weak characters.  This
version makes much more use of the early residents of Hill House,
particularly the industrialist who built it and who here looks a lot
like the early makeup designs for THE PLANET OF THE APES.  De Bont
replaces the mysterious seductive evil of the house with too great an
abundance of strange phenomena.  If Hill House is getting this
treatment from the spirits, are not there a lot of places in which
greater evils occurred. Why do we not see this degree of haunting more
places?</P>
<P>     The production design is credited to Eugenio Zanetti.  If that
name does not sound familiar consider that he performed the same
function on such beautiful films as FLATLINERS, RESTORATION, and WHAT
DREAMS MAY COME. Zanetti won the Academy Award for set design for
RESTORATION and was nominated (and deserved to win) for WHAT DREAMS MAY
COME.  The Hill House he designed would be a dominating spirit even if
there were no haunting.  I hope Jan de Bont realizes how very much he
owes to Zanetti for making this film as good as it is.</P>
<P>     This version of THE HAUNTING would be a better film by another
name.  On its own it is actually quite a good ghost story about what is
the most incredibly haunted house the screen has yet seen.  By inviting
comparison to one of the three best ghost stories on film, this action-
oriented version comes up a poor second.  But if we had to have a
graphic version of Jackson's novel, this is far better than any we
could have expected.  I give it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
