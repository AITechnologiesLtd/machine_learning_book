<P>     "Open Your Eyes" is the picture Alfred Hitchcock might have made
if he were very young and Spanish and in film school today.  It's a
twisty, multi- leveled succession of screens and masks (literally and
figuratively) that takes on identity and reality with all the earnest
passion of a late-night bull session among college kids who are
flirting with the idea of switching majors to Philosophy.</P>
<P>Eduardo Noriega is Cesar, a young Lothario who makes it a point
of honor never to sleep with the same woman twice, until he meets his
best friend's new girl Sofia (Penelope Cruz of "The Hi-Lo Country")
and falls madly in love.  Unfortunately, his wild oats have sown a
bitter harvest with Nuria (Najwa Nimri), a recent one-night stand who
is so obstinate about trying to keep him that she drives her car off a
cliff, killing herself and horribly disfiguring his once-pretty face.</P>
<P>As time and reality scramble, we find Cesar scrunched on the
floor of a cell in a psychiatric prison wearing a mask to conceal his
deformed face and amnesia to conceal who it is he's killed (and why
and how), while his doctor (Chete Lera) tries to peel away these
coverings.  We go back to pick up key moments of the story, some of
them obviously dreams, some of them apparently real, with the
distinction becoming more and more blurred.</P>
<P>The 27-year-old tyro Amenabar has the talent to dress his story
up handsomely and twirl it with dazzling flourishes, but his
immaturity shows through and becomes more and more pronounced as he
reels toward the finish line.  Masks play a big part in his legend,
and he's partial to repeated lines of dialogue ("Can't you tell dreams
from reality?") that resonate with meaning.  Cryonics also play a big
part, to fuzz the line between life and death just as dreams and
reality are confounded and confused.</P>
<P>The Hitchcock thing is a conscious embrace -- an homage, you
would say, that Amenabar overtly acknowledges when at the end his hero
is teetering on the ledge of a skyscraper and says "I forgot, I get
vertigo."</P>
<PRE>Forget this.  Get "Vertigo".</PRE>
