WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>What's the worst that could happen?  Well, you could be watching FREDDIE 
GOT FINGERED, the worst movie of the year and perhaps the decade, rather 
than WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?  The latter, while it isn't 
particularly funny, may not even be the worst comedy of the week.  (THE 
ANIMAL screens later this week.)</P>
<P>In this anti-buddy comedy, Martin Lawrence plays thief Kevin Caffery, a 
self-described "connoisseur of all things portable," and Danny DeVito 
plays Max Fairbanks, a shady billionaire who is currently running a big 
bankruptcy scam.  Max is the obnoxious sort who is currently shagging 
Miss September on the sly and who calls women a stream of endearments 
from "sugar cakes" to "snuggle bunny."  (What has happened to old 
reliable DeVito?  His previous 2 films, DROWNING MONA and the aptly 
named SCREWED, were perfectly awful.)</P>
<P>Their game of mutual payback begins when Max robs Kevin of the ring that 
his girlfriend, Amber Belhaven (Carmen Ejogo), has just given him.  Max 
feels no guilt since Kevin has just robbed one of Max's mansions.  
Kevin, his sidekick Berger (John Leguizamo) and the rest of Kevin's 
friends then set out to steal more from Max, all the while trying to 
retrieve Amber's ring.  </P>
<P>Typical of the story's gags is Kevin's inability to tell a lie without 
blinking.  Sam Weisman (THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS), who directs with ham handed 
obviousness, has Lawrence exaggerate his blinking like a stage actor who 
needs to make sure that even those audience members way back in the 
cheap seats can still see his gestures.</P>
<P>In a story full of bizarre characters, none is more so than Detective 
Alex Tardio (William Fichtner, THE PERFECT STORM).  Prissing around in 
shades of white from his big blonde hair to his light colored alligator 
boots, the detective is pulled along by his three snow white poodles.  
Just in case the visuals aren't enough to have you in stitches, the dogs 
turn out to have a major flatulence problem.</P>
<P>This juvenile comedy, with its recycled humor that seems always aimed 
squarely at kids around 12 or so, does have one truly funny scene.  As 
Max testifies before a Senate committee, Kevin calls him on his cell 
phone and begins to harass him.  This causes Max to unleash a stream of 
expletives.  The television camera bleeps it all out, but the sign 
language translator relishes her big opportunity to ad lib with some 
obvious but nonetheless hilarious gestures.  </P>
<P>WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN? runs 1:35.  It is rated PG-13 for 
language and sexual content and would be acceptable for kids around 8 
and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, thought the picture was really funny and gave 
it *** 1/2.  His favorite scene was the same as mine, the Senate hearing.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, June 1, 2001.  
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the AMC and the Century 
theaters.</P>
