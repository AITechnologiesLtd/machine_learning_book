<P>   Of the many wars and military interventions to which the
United States has been a party, only one was not declared or
pursued by America before this country was attacked by a
hostile power.  World War II was the lone conflict forcing
America's hand: abruptly, dramatically, devastatingly. What is
the relevance of this historic detail?  Simply that because the
territorial lands and waters of the United States were hit while
the U.S. was at peace, few Americans of fighting age rushed
to graduate school or to parenthood to escape the draft and,
in fact, the morning after the Pearl Harbor attack found
thousands of young people lined up outside their military
recruitment centers itching to sign up and fight to restore their
country's honor.  Here was a clear-cut moral war against the
forces of fascism, a struggle to inspire a rebirth of nationalism
after a long passive stance of listless isolationism.  Here was
a conflict made for the movies, and thanks to the advanced
special effects people from Industrial Light and Magic who
furnish some awfully dramatic explosions together with
patriotic action sequences and a screenplay that does not
treat the Japanese as boorish caricatures, "Pearl Harbor" is
not a picture you'd want to skip.  Nonetheless the film is
seriously flawed.</P>
<P>   Through this $135 million presentation, producer Jerry
Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay attempt to equal or
outdo major war pictures like "The Bridge on the River Kwai,"
"The Longest Day," and "Saving Private Ryan" as a proud
and entertaining testament to the men and women who kept
our nation and its allies free from the totalitarian grip of a 
relentless adversary.</P>
<P>   I suppose some hearts will beat rapidly at both the soapy
romance that emerges at strategic times during the action and
even leap up while watching the feel-good ending that
features the courageous Jimmy Doolittle's daring, almost
suicidal bombing attack directly on Tokyo just months after
the Pearl Harbor debacle.  Despite Bob Badami's attempt to
browbeat us with banal music which in a few instances all but
drowns out the soapy dialogue, one could not be blamed for
feeling proud to be an American--cheering on the Doolittle
raid while suffering trepidation at the appalling damage done
by wave after wave of Japanese "zeros" during an attack of
an hour or so that left over 3,000 people dead on the island
of Oahu. At two hours and fifty minutes not including the
thirteen minutes of credits that thankfully appear only at the
end, however, the overlong film should depress anyone who
has seen Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" as
unfortunately second-rate in its battle sequences.  The
millions who will compare the amorous activities on the
screen with those present in James Cameron's "Titanic" might
not be blamed for thinking that something this time around
has been plagiarized from a Harlequin romance.</P>
<P>   Since Bay and Bruckheimer may realize that they've
already got the lovers of guns and glory sold well in advance
of the opening day, they've opted to spend the greater part of
the film's time on the eternal, romantic triangle:  the courtship
of Nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) by airmen Rafe
McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). 
The film's opening in 1923 positions Rafe and Danny as best
buddies in rural Tennessee. In one scene that points out their
desire to fly, they play around in a crop-dusting plane,
surprised by the aircraft's sudden liftoff, which lasts about as
long as the Wright Brothers' first flight but probably scares
them quite a bit more.  They join the United States Army Air
Corps at which time Rafe, volunteering for an extra
immunization shot in the butt from the strikingly pretty,
girl-next-door Nurse Evelyn, falls in love, yet volunteers to join
a British company some months before the attack on Pearl
Harbor.  He goes down with his plane and is presumed dead. 
Evelyn teams up with Danny--signalling the audience that
trouble is about to brew between the best buddies that will
tear them up even more than the war experiences to follow.</P>
<P>   Director Michael Bay ("The Rock," "Armageddon") teams up
for the fourth Bruckheimer production determined to give the
huge expected audience what he's sure it wants the most:
sappy and sentimental love juxtaposed with the best that
state-of-the-art special effects can supply.  While the
protracted attack on the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor might invite
comparisons to the opening half hour of "Saving Private
Ryan," the latter had one large advantage.  Since the landing
in France in 1944 was a surprise move engineered by the
U.S., viewers could focus on Tom Hanks's character
throughout the harrowing battle scene as he directs his squad
of seven men in the invasion.  By keeping his camera close to
the ground pointing up at the men, photographer Janusz
Kaminski gave us an unsurpassed view of what it must be like
to be in the hell of a firestorm.  By contrast, since the 1941
attack in "Pearl Harbor" was engineered by the Japanese--
who are shown in the planning as rational commanders who
even cancel the plan for a third wave because the surprise
would be lost--John Schwartzman's lensing shows mostly a
prolonged period of confusion, unable to focus on one man in
the manner that Tom Hanks was used in "Ryan."</P>
<P>   Some of the visuals are quite good, of course, as you'd
expect from a film costing as much as this one (but still 65
million less than "Titanic"), my favorite being a closeup of a
torpedo dropped from a Japanese fighter plane that brought
me back to the final scene in Stanley Kubrick's far more
imaginative "Dr. Strangelove," in which a crazed right-wing
American fighter rides an atomic bomb from his plane right
down to its target.  </P>
<P>   Between the furious action and the romance, there is some
strong, even humorous accompanying action with strong
imagery.  In one, Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) pummels a
fighter in the boxing ring while implicitly pointing out the
discrimination that blacks faced during that war.  Wanting
nothing more than to man a gun, he is relegated to the
kitchen as one of his ship's cooks.  As Col. James H.
Doolittle, Alec Baldwin serves to inspire his men to go on a
suicide mission designed to raise the morale of the America
people after the disaster of Pearl Harbor.  On the Japanese
side, Mako turns in a strong performance as Admiral Isoroku
Yamamoto, who directs the attack on Pearl Harbor together
with Commander Minoru Genda (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa),
planning the campaign for several weeks in advance while
incredibly managing to keep the Americans clueless about his
mission and flaying about in an attempt to guess where the
Japanese would inevitably strike.</P>
<P>   Jon Voight inhabits the role of the wheelchair-bound
President F.D. Roosevelt splendidly, showing genuine
emotion at the losses suffered at Pearl Harbor, and recreating
the opening to his dramatic address to the U.S. Congress one
day after the Pearl Harbor attack.  Josh Hartnett and Ben
Affleck are fine as best buddies who have a serious falling out
over a woman, with the lovely British actress Kate Beckinsale,
hair makeup always in place even while racing about the
hospital in search of morphine or getting it on inside a
parachute with Josh Hartnett, is a perfect icon for the
excellent work done by women who administer to the
wounded and even fall themselves in the heat of battle.  </P>
<P>   Fine performances aside--bogged down by Randall
Wallace's mushy and hackneyed dialogue, drowned out by
Bob Badami's bullying beat, and intimidated by Mr. Kaminski's
ever-soaring and descending camera, "Pearl Harbor" ends a
victim of the sort of over-production that motivates producers
and directors who believe that a mass audience must be
afflicted with attention-deficit disorder.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 183 minutes.  (C)2001,
