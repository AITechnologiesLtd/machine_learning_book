<P>   Just the other week, a 23-year-old man who had been a
student at Columbia University murdered his ex-girl friend,
who was then attending the college.  He then proceeded to
the nearest subway station and threw himself under the
wheels of a passing train.  Though most of us are horrified by
events like this, we can understand the emotions that
informed it.  A jealous and vindictive lover is tossed
overboard and slaughters his girl.  Filled with rage, guilt,
fear--overwhelmed with sensation--he ends his own life.  But
not all suicides are understandable, though sociologists from
Durkheim on down have published treatises in attempts to
explain them.  </P>
<P>   In "The Virgin Suicides," Sofia Coppola deals with a suicide
pact made by five teenage girls, all sisters living under
the same roof.  The young women had been confined to their
home by their religious and conservative mother, a possible
explanation for their disastrous action.  While one critic of
this film--recently named one of the two best from the
January 2000 Sundance Festival--has reproached the writer-
director and, by extension the novelist for failing to interpret
the suicides, he completely misses the point.  The whole
essence of "The Virgin Suicides" is that we simply do not
know the answer--that suicide is one of the great mysteries of
our nature that cannot be resolved with any degree of
closure.</P>
<P>   Jeffrey Eugenides's book, meant to be interpreted as fable,
allegory, a fairy tale if you will, must have been difficult to
make cinematic but Sofia Coppola--daughter of Francis Ford
Coppola who is listed as one of the producers--has done a
most effective job of giving screen life to the tale.  Suffused in
equal measure by sardonic humor and a persistently tragic
texture, "The Virgin Suicides" possesses the period feel of
Ang Lee's marvelous "The Ice Storm," which hones in on the
upper-middle-class America of the early 1970s, probing the
pathologies which infect the lives of Connecticut families. 
The story is told from the collective point of view of five
adolescent boys who had obsessed about their counterparts
across the way and is narrated by Giovanni Ribisi, invisibly
standing in for the quintet.  The Lisbon girls, whose age
range is 13 to 17, are ruled austerely by their mother
(Kathleen Turner), who is conceivably all too concerned about
the social pathologies induced by the new sexual freedom of
the seventies.  Their father (James Woods) by contrast is a
timid math teacher who reluctantly goes along with his wife's
inflexibility and endeavors to make up for his lack of
communication with her by reaching out to the students in his
classes and in the neighborhood.  The Lisbon family is torn
apart by the suicide of the 13-year-old Cecilia (Hanna R.
Hall), who succeeds on her second attempt for reasons that
absolutely nobody can fathom--not even the psychiatrist who
had interviewed her, Dr. Hornicker (Danny De Vito).  The
story later turns to the sprouting relationship of the school's
hunk, Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett) with the most beautiful of
the Lisbon girls, Lux (Kirsten Dunst).  Lux, who had been
about the only girl in the school to ignore Trip, soon becomes
his lover, until during one destructive night she commits an
act that causes her mother to haul her entire brood out of the
school, effectively putting them under house arrest for several
weeks.</P>
<P>   It would be a mistake to look upon "Virgin Suicides" as yet
another satire of American middle-class suburban life
("American Beauty") or of the obsessiveness that seems to
rule particular individuals in this environment ("Election"). 
"Virgin Suicides" cannot be reduced to a tract about how to
bring up your kids or a psychological study of girls who are
possessed by a kind of devil or even a commentary on the
emptiness of life among the well-to-do in contemporary
America.  Sofia Coppola, I think, has captured the vision of
novelist Jeffrey Eugenides, which is that in this enigmatic
existence of ours, some things just cannot be rationally
explained.  An attending physician treating Cecilia after her
attempted suicide shakes his head and counsels, "You have
not been around, girl....You're not old enough to know what
tragedy there is in life" and gets her reply, "You've never
been a 13-year-old girl." At that point we realize that no
resolution is going to come from Coppola's screenplay, no
facile conclusion will be reached.  Neat solutions are the stuff
of commercial movies.</P>
<P>   Kathleen Turner and James Woods perform out of
character as the parents. Turner is made up as a frumpy
housewife and Woods, in his permanent press jacket realizes
the very opposite of his usual over-the-top performance.  The
young men from whose point of view the picture is made are
the sorts we all were in high school--one justifiably
swaggering, another fairly bold, others bashful and balking. 
But all the boys have a healthy interest in what the fair sex
are like and take pleasure in peering through a telescope to
observe the girls in their shower and, in a few instances,
performing sexual acts on the roof of the Lisbon home.  In
one panorama, a group of workmen destroy trees affected
with a fungus--an obvious metaphor for a creeping infirmity
that has influenced the neighborhood.  In another scene,
some adults in the community are enjoying a cocktail party,
giving us the erroneous impression that Coppola and
Eugenides believe that a more accountable assembly would
instead engage in group therapy sessions to try to
understand the malady which has defiled the district.  In the
final analysis, we are deliberately and cleverly left hanging,
as unsure of the causes of the alienation of these children as
we were when we entered the theater.  That, in no small
measure, is what makes this an exceptional film.</P>
