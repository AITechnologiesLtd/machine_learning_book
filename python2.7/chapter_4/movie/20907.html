<PRE>Just a Degree or Two Shy of True North
Message in a Bottle</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>No, it's not exactly like "Sleepless in Seattle." In fact, the only part
that's similar is the first 20 minutes when Theresa finds the message in a
bottle, it gets printed in the news and the public responds. By the way, the
letter from Costner riddled in cliché (though, this might well be
realistic -- he's a boatman, not a poet) wasn't very intriguing. So, if you
happen to be reading this review on your way to the showing, relax ...
arrive late. The first 20 minute chunk is the weakest part of the film.
While I'm at it, I could have missed the last 20 as well.</P>
<P>Now the middle, that's pretty good. It's a delicate, fragile, gently paced
love story that moves along with a subtle energy created by the abrasion of
hesitation against anticipation. (Whew, get through that sentence?) In
short, it's simply sweet to watch these mid-life folks experiencing that
"first love" kind of awkwardness.</P>
<P>Kevin Costner and Paul Newman are ultimately believable as father and son.
They seem so natural as family, I have to wonder if they really are. Kevin
performs splendidly as a co-star in a movie that really isn't about his
character (for a change). Though I have to say, the film was rather lifeless
until he appeared on the screen, and then it seemed, all the other actors
were revitalized.</P>
