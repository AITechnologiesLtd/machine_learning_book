<P>Mix the following ingredients: Brazil's own 1960's Cinema Novo's first wave
(political, socially conscious, realistic);  the road movies genre; early
Italian neorealist films; cinema-verite; and bits of epistolary films. Take
as your subject the undying category in which a tough (or just gruff) man
or woman gets somehow stuck with a kid (generally but not always sweet like
Shirley Temple or Freddie Bartholomew) that will mellow the adult; think of
the current remake of Cassavetes' "Gloria." And what do you get in Central
Station?</P>
<P>A hybrid? Not at all. You get an original, un-gimmicky, un-icky,
un-cliched, attention-holding, touching film that opens your eyes on major
aspects of the human condition in Brazil and on that country's people and
life.</P>
<P>Obviously, the movie has been appreciated, with awards and/or applause at
several festivals, including the top prize at the Berlin Festival. It is
also a contender in the best foreign film category at the 1999 Oscars.</P>
<P>Rio de Janeiro's Central train station where 300,000 people move about each
day, is a microcosm of urban society. The station looks to me (but I may be
wrong) like the hub of local  trains rather than long-distance travel.
Also, the majority of the people we see are working class, low income or no
income Cariocas, cheaply clad -- a far cry from the well-dressed crowds in
North American commuter trains. (To anticipate comments, I do know that, as
I write this in cold February, it is 90 degrees in Rio, and people are in
shirt-sleeves, but shabbiness prevails at the station by any standards).</P>
<P>The mobs are busy rushing into the trains. Many younger men jump into the
wagons through  open windows. The place is also a hive of makeshift stores
and stands. Early into the movie there's a  horrendous scene. A man who has
lifted something from a shop is pursued. Two cops catch up with him. They
take his loot, and, without thinking twice about it, one of the lawmen puts
a bullet in the fellow's head. Nothing is made of this. Life is cheap.</P>
<P>Dora, in her mid-to-late 60s, and no beauty --to put it mildly--is a
retired elementary school teacher. To make ends meet, in the cavernous
station she has a table on which she writes letters that many illiterates
dictate to her and gets also paid for putting on stamps later and mailing
the envelopes. But, tough, brusque and caustic, the scribe is also a scam
artist.</P>
<P>When she gets to her dismal apartment by the tracks, she brings along her
daily bag of letters that she's supposed to mail, and shows them to her
friend Irene. Irene may be her roommate or her neighbor, it's not clear.
Clearly though, she is the only friend in Dora's depressing life. Irene,
younger, jolly and a still nice-looking fading beauty, is probably a
prostitute, though this is not elaborated.</P>
<P>At home, Dora perhaps selects a few envelops that she mails. For sure, she
tears up many of them and puts the rest in drawers,where they probably
remain forever.</P>
<P>Among her customers is a woman with her 9-year old boy Josue.  Her husband,
a drunkard, left her long ago. She want him back, for herself and for their
fatherless child.
That woman is killed by a bus right outside the station. The plight of the
child is even more tragic if you are aware of the horrendous problem of
millions of street-children in Brazil. Their survival is a tragedy;  many
even get killed by the police for no reason.</P>
<P>Soon, hard-as-nails Dora takes streetwise and sullen Josue to her place.
Her unexpected kindness is undone when she sells the boy to a shabby
"agency" which supposedly supplies children to adoptive parents abroad.</P>
<P>Dora returns home with a new color TV set, on which, with subtle, symbolic,
irony, we see only black-and-white programs. But an aghast Irene tells her
that the agency is a fake, that the kids will be killed for their organs.
Dora rushes back, kidnaps Josue and in fear of retaliation, flees with him
to look for the missing father.</P>
<P>This is where the travels begin. It's more of a road movie than an odyssey
since the "adventures"  are on a small, intimate rather than a grand scale.
The grand scale is only in the vastness of Brazil, the world's fifth
largest nation.</P>
<P>The woman and the rebellious Josue take a lot of busses. When hardly
solvent or broke they hitch rides in  trucks.Most of this is in the
"sertao" of the North East, Brazil's thinly populated, often barren
outback. (It's a neat reversal of the poor of those areas trudging to the
promised land of big cities).</P>
<P>The trip, the landscape, the places seen are harsh. Nothing is paved in
this barrenness, except for the main highways. The viewers are given a tour
which, like the entire film, is extremely well photographed and
uncompromisnly realistic. We are light years  away from the commonly
pictured touristic Brazil with its fiestas and the thong-wearing beauties
of the Copcabana Beach. Credit director Salles's  experience as a
documentarist. He is objective but has a heart.</P>
<P>While the protagonists gradually, as expected, draw closer to each other,
Salles, with much naturalness, avoids sentimentalizing people or places.
Yet his eyes and ears are full of quiet sympathy for what, to use Bunuel's
title, are Los Olvidados, the forgotten ones who struggle to subsist. The
people whom the woman and the child come across, by and large are decent
folks who live in squalor. An episode with a nice, warm, older trucker, an
Evangelical who, for a brief spell, stirs the woman in Dora, is
effortlessly touching. And in a long, spectacular sequence, Dora and Josue
find themselves in a throng of pilgrims that go to revere Jesus in acts of
hope and of self-consolation.</P>
<P>(One should not, by the way, make too much of names such as Josue (Joshua)
and Jesus, the elusive father, nor the fact that Jesus is a sort of
carpenter. Symbolism may be present , but with a light touch. Curiously, in
the other main candidate for Best Foreign Film Oscar this year ( Life is
Beautiful) the woman is called Dora and the child is Josue</P>
<P>The humanity of the Dora-Josue twosome has enormous appeal. She is one of
Brazil's top stage actresses -- and light years away from the looks of
Sharon Stone in Gloria!)  He was a poor shoeshine boy whom the director
discovered in an airport. Their performances  are so real that the word
"acting" never comes into your mind.</P>
<P>What might come to mind is the great Italian film "Stolen Children," as
well as its contrast with Central Station, whose poverty makes even the
Italian South look relatively wealthy.
The most upsetting sight for me, one that encapsulates the movie, is the
the picture of a goat in a sertao village. The animal, trying to graze in
the barren dust, walks somehow with his two broken front legs. Yet the
total movie does not stress grimness. It has its natural quota of
positiveness, even unforced humor.</P>
