<PRE>                                THE ADDICTION
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1996 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>(1995) NO STARS - C:Lily Taylor, Christopher Walken, Annabella Sciorra,
Paul Calderon.</P>
<P>Abel Ferrera, director of such mediocre films as "Bad Lieutenant" and "Body
Snatchers", and of such awful films as "The Gladiator" and "Dangerous Game",
adds another to his awful list. Basically, "The Addiction" is just another
low budget vampire flick, although the term "vampire" is never used in the
film. It tries to be some sort of psuedo-intellectual metaphor for drug
addiction and even man's evilness upon his fellow man.</P>
<P>Taylor plays a college student who is attacked one night in a dark alley by
vampire Sciorra. Sciorra bites her, and then for the next twenty minutes
Taylor basically just gets sick and throws up blood all the time. Pleasant.
Then Taylor starts to get "hungry" so she goes out into the city to get a
"fix". At first, she apparently can't bring herself to actually bite anyone,
so she brings along hypodermic needles and withdraws blood from homeless
people. She then proceeds home and injects herself with the blood. All of
which we get to watch. Boy o boy, at this point we've got vomit and needles,
my eyes are GLUED to the screen. I wonder what other disgusting and
unpleasant things we'll get to see.</P>
<P>Taylor soon gets the hang of biting people, so thankfully, no more needles.
She meets up with Christopher Walken, who plays a sort of mentor vampire who
has been around much longer than Taylor has. In his brief appearence he
spouts out dialog about literature and about man's inhumanity throughout
history. Then he leaves, and the carnage (and unpleasantness) continues.</P>
<P>The only new thing that "The Addiction" tells us about vampires is that if a
vampire approaches you on the streets, he or she will give you the option of
whether or not you want your life saved. The vampire wants you to tell it to
"go away" with strength and confidence, like you really mean it, instead of
just begging and pleading for your life like a little baby. Yes, that's
right, I kid you not. In conclusion, the whole film is boring and
unpleasant, two things that never add up to a good movie. The film is in
black and white if anyone is interested.</P>
