<P>SICK: THE LIFE & DEATH OF BOB FLANAGAN, SUPERMASOCHIST (director: Kirby
Dick; cast: Kathe Burkhart (Interviewer), Kirby Dick (Interviewer), Rita
Valencia (Interviewer), Sheree Rose (Herself), Bob Flanagan (Himself),
1997)</P>
<P>SICK begins with Bob reading the obituary he wrote, "I was promised an
early death, and here I am, 40 years later, waiting to die ..." Thus
begins the uplifting and bewildering story of Bob Flanagan, a truly
amazing person, unfortunate to be born with cystic fibrosis, "a
children's disease marked by fibrosis of the pancreas and frequent
respiratory infections." It's considered a children's disease because
most of the babies born with it don't live to adulthood. Bob Flanagan
was the oldest living person known to have had that disease. He died
while the movie was being filmed, as a video camera followed him around
for the last days of his life, at 40 years of age. The camera crew
mistakingly took the day off when he died, but we do get to see his
decayed body, besides already seeing how sick he looked just before his
death.</P>
<P>The story is uplifting, strangely enough, because Bob was able to live
with the constant pain and discomforts of the disease, finding his own
identity and exhibiting a gallows sense of humor that allowed him to
joke about himself, sharing with the audience the most personal details
of his life, such as his lack of ability to produce much of a discharge
when he masturbates. He became a person who went beyond the perversities
that marked his adult life, the S & M he credits with giving him a will
to live, into someone who can't be judged by those who have not felt his
pain, who performed on stage acts of self-mutilation that is
mind-boggling, such as putting a nail through his penis. That was one
part of the movie that was too much for my squeamish eyes, as I chose to
look away.</P>
<P>Since I did not know what to expect upon seeing this documentary, not
really giving much thought beforehand to what goes through the mind of a
masochist, only thinking that a masochist must be someone with a screw
loose somehere. But the astonishing thing about this brutally honest
film, that was no easy chore to watch, no matter how insightful or
hilarious the film was, or how sympathetic I might have felt about Bob,
was that I still felt myself self-consciously measuring my responses to
what he was going through, wondering how I would bear up to such
travails, but all the time taking comfort that Bob did what he had to do
in order not to let the bad body he was born with make his life a total
mockery. And by the end of the film, I was able to look clearly at him
and see him as another being on a journey, just like others have taken,
knowing full-well that fear of death is a fact of life, and its mystery
is something that leaves us searching for answers about why things
happen to us in a certain way or trying to put off thinking about it
until we can't put off thinking about it any longer... and, who can say
for certain what it is about their life that they had to experience in
order for them to find peace.</P>
<P>In many ways, what Bob was going through was a religious experience, as
he questioned his beliefs and what his feelings were all about. It
seemed to make sense, when he said, that Christ was the most famous
masochist of all time. I was beginning to think that Bob's agonizing
illness and his high tolerance for pain that he couldn't help having
from cf and the satisfaction he received from being a so called
"Performance Artist", and having pain voluntarily inflicted upon him,
was something that gave him an inner strength, a sense of being that he
felt he couldn't get any other way but this way, and that it all seemed
right. I would not have felt this way, if I hadn't seen the film.
Watching him in agony, might be a lot like watching Christ, that is,
without the religious implications that the apostles gave to that event.
His suffering was solely his trip, he wasn't about saving the world,
though he was shown to be a role model for others with cf, sadists or
not, and he acted as a counselor for many years for children in a cf
camp. As a child he was the poster boy for cf.</P>
<P>Bob had a comedy and poetry routine on stage, as well as his
self-mutillation thing, that he seemed to love to perform, though
curiously enough, he told his girlfriend, the dominatrix, Sheree Rose,
that he would give up everything, including his artistic work, just to
have a girlfriend. Fortunately for him, he found someone who would keep
him submissive, whipping him and keeping him under her strict rules, so
he wound up with the best of the two worlds, a girlfriend and an ally in
his exhibitionism... Some of his later poems are in the style of an
Allen Ginsberg or a Bob Dylan rant, as his work took on a greater
meaning from his earlier work. Here is one of his better poems:</P>
<P>Supermasochistic Bob has cystic fibrosis
He should have died when he was ten but he was too precocious
How much longer he will last is anyone's prognosis
Supermasochistic Bob has cystic fibrosis
HumdiddleiddleiddleI'mgonnadie, humdiddleiddleiddleI'mgonnadie...</P>
<P>The film ends with his performance of a song entitled "Fun to Be Dead".
That comes after we see him for an extended period of time, as he
suffers in the hospital.</P>
<P>Everything about his life was extra-ordinary and beyond speculation. His
relationship with his parents and his homosexual brother are reviewed,
showing no unloving signs. Though his parents expressed surprise about
his masochism, he never revealed to them that he felt this way. What
astonished them more than the fact that he is a masochist, was that they
thought they knew him better than anyone else.</P>
<P>There is also an interesting clip from the old Steve Allen show, where
he appeared as a child guest in the audience, saying he wants to be a
doctor when he grows up, not an artist.</P>
<P>Much of the video, comes from Sheree's home movies of him and her
performing, showing them in many different moods, and to her credit,
showing stuff that is not always flattering to her, like when he was
terribly sick during those last days and she still wanted him to be
submissive to her. Submission seemed to be more important than love for
her. Or maybe, it was the only way she could love someone. She was too
perplexing a character to make head or tail of in this movie. It was
tough enough to try to come to grips with Bob's story.</P>
<P>To say that this film is unusual, is to mean that it really is not quite
like any other feel good movie I have ever seen before. I was glad that
I saw it, though I can't honestly say that it was a totally joyous
experience. I think those who would avoid this film, thinking it is too
depressing to see, might be depriving themselves from seeing a film that
belies any rationalization of it. This film is definetly not for a mass
audience, but it is for those who are curious about things that are not
that familiar to them. They will be rewarded by observing how the sheer
power of a human being coping with a painful and unbearable disease for
his entire life, still has the will  to live a creative life. That is
enough of a reason for me to recommend this film.</P>
