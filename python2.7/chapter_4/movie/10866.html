<PRE>The Devil's Advocate</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Taylor Hackford.</PRE>
<P>Starring: Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron, Jeffrey Jones,
Judith Ivey, Craig T. Nelson.</P>
<P>The Devil's Advocate's last 30 minutes or so are so much better than
the early sections of the movie that it's easy to forgive a lot of its
problems. I left the cinema with a real sense of enjoyment that
gradually fades as I remember the earlier pieces of the film.</P>
<P>First the trivial but distracting: Mr. Keanu Reeve's ache-saynt. It
wanders all over the fifty states of America. Because of the
storyline, his character, Kevin Lomax, had to be from the south so I
understand the need for the fake accent but it was distracting all the
same.</P>
<P>>From what I can tell by talking to other people, I'm in a minority
group who believes that Mr. Reeves can act. Now I'm not saying that
I'd pay money to see him play Hamlet but in the right role, I think he
is quite good.  Although not a great movie, I thought he was quite the
part in Chain Reaction and I think as the vain, cocky, pretty-boy
lawyer, he does a great job. He's less convincing as the anguished
husband but perhaps that's in character: as one who chooses his career
over his wife, time and time again, maybe deep down he's not all that
anguished.</P>
<P>Ms. Charlize Theron as Mary Ann gives a solid performance although
it's a pretty horrible role. I can see the attraction for an actor as
it allows the performer to run the gamut of emotions and really
stretch herself.  It's hard, however, to understand this person. If
she really is so lonely and bored, why doesn't she look for a job, try
to meet people, join a basketball team? As a result, Mary Ann's
progression through the movie is less sympathetic than it could have
been.</P>
<P>The other lead, Mr. Al Pacino as John Milton, was inspired
casting. This is the role Mr. Pacino was born to play. Schooled in the
tradition that if he's not hamming it up, he's not acting makes him
ideal for this role. His devilish grin, his wicked leer - he's having
the time of his life.</P>
<P>The main problem with this movie is the set-up. This is contrary to
most films. The majority of movies seem to have this great premise and
no idea how to end the story. The Devil's Advocate has this great
conclusion and has trouble working out how to set it up. It's too long
in getting to John Milton's big speech with too many little side
issues getting in the way, such as the story involving the Weaver
investigation. As well as being slow, there are large chunks of the
movie that just don't work. The cocktail party, for example, is saying
"look at me, I'm so clever" but the lines lack any zing and the whole
scene becomes a time waster. More frustrating is the scene where Eddie
Barzoon (Mr. Jeffrey Jones) is out jogging. John Milton delivers some
sort of speech during this event but I found it impossible to
concentrate on the monologue with all that was happening on the
screen.  Perhaps that was the intention of the film-makers but, if so,
it was a waste of two pages of the script.</P>
<P>Like all mainstream films, The Devil's Advocate has the male/female
double standard. We get lots of full frontal female nudity but no such
male scenes.  Also, as expected, God and Satan are male (you knew I
wasn't going to let that one pass).</P>
<P>Although outlandish and over the top, The Devil's Advocate poses some
interesting philosophical arguments, especially concerning the role of
God, the role of the Devil, free will and what is right. Of course, we
are only getting one side of the story here.  Be warned: although this
movie left me with a sense of enjoyment, it is a very gruesome,
violent film. It probably got its R rating for the nudity but the slit
throats and the bashings couldn't have helped.</P>
<P>Viewing The Devil's Advocate means sitting through a lot of tedium but
not going means you miss a great conclusion. Damned if you do and
damned if you don't!</P>
