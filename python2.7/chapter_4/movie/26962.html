<PRE>"Unbreakable"</PRE>
<P>David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is on a commuter train heading home for
Philadelphia after a none-too-successful security job interview in New York
City. He flirts with and is rejected by a pretty young woman and sinks into
his own doldrums. Just before arriving in Philly, the train goes out of
control, jumps the track and all 131 passengers and crew are killed -
except for David, who survives the wreck with nary a scratch. A mysterious,
handicapped man, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who tells David that he
is a very special person, a man who may be invincible, soon approaches him.
The bemused David begins to delve into his apparent indestructibility and
makes some shocking discoveries in director/writer M. Night Shyamalan's
"Unbreakable."</P>
<P>Helmer Shyamalan faces a tough battle with his follow up to the incredibly
successful sophomore effort, "The Sixth Sense." (That film was the second
largest grossing film in 1999, overshadowed only by "The Phantom Menace.")
The director/writer wasted no time in creating a new mystery thriller that
invites the viewer to pay close attention to the details of the story while
still delivering a finale with a revelation that shocks. But, please, don't
expect the stunning, unexpected ending of "The Sixth Sense." Shyamalan's
follow on film effectively avoids a slump by weaving a different mystical
tale.</P>
<P>David has survived the horrors of the train wreck with absolutely no damage
to his body, but his mind is another thing. There is a part of David that
he has never come to grips with and it has impacted his life in negative
ways, including a failing marriage to Audrey (Robin Wright Pen). His only
ray of hope is his son, Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark), who idolizes his dad.
One day soon after the crash, David finds a note on his car that asks the
question, "How many days have you been sick?" There is nothing else except
for a company logo on the card. Dunn tracks down the company to find a very
strange individual as the owner.</P>
<P>Elijah has suffered a lifelong affliction, osteogenesis imperfecta; a
debilitating disease that makes his bones as frail as twigs. He has lived a
careful, reclusive life and still suffered 54 breaks of his bones since he
was a child. Elijah became, as a boy, with his mother's (Charlayne Woodard)
help, an aficionado of action comic books and has delved into duality
inherent in the hero/villain themes of the genre. He built a business based
on the art of his beloved comic books and became obsessed with finding his
dual, his opposite, in life. Elijah's thinking is that there must be
someone to counter his own breakability. Is David the man he seeks?</P>
<P>Other heinous disasters have also taken place, recently, besides David's
train wreck. Of the three life-snuffing accidents, David is the only one to
survive - without a mark on him. Elijah makes David think back over his
life and those things that may have harmed him. As Dunn digs into his past,
he finds that events did not really play as they seemed and that his
childhood "injuries" never happened. His is, truly, unbreakable. The
question now becomes, what is David's purpose on Earth? The fragile Elijah,
whose bones quite literally can break like glass, shows David that he has
the ability to "see" wrongdoers and their deeds. This newfound "sight"
gives David the chance to save a couple of children from a brutal death,
proving to his son that he is a hero. Is he Elijah's comic book hero?</P>
<P>I won't talk anymore about the story so I don't give anything away. This is
a mystery story and the viewer should be allowed the chance to figure it
out. The good news is, though not as shocking a work as "The Sixth Sense,"
"Unbreakable" is an intelligent, well-executed mystical tale. Prepare
yourself for rampant symbolism (and, unfortunately, at least one, extended
product placement that I found annoying). The two-sides-of-the-same-coin
relationship between David and Elijah also has elements of student and
master. David is the bewildered, invulnerable hero figure to Elijah's
flawed, but brilliant, advisor. But, yes, there is more. The comic book art
as a binding device is interesting, especially for action comic fans, but
it left me cold. I think an understanding of the graphic novel art form, as
the director obviously has, will make you appreciate the film's intent a
little more.</P>
<P>Technically, "Unbreakable" is solid. Photography by Eduardo Serra is key to
the look of the film, capturing the moody, off-kilter, otherworldliness
that Shyamalan strives to create. Production designer Larry Fulton, who did
such subtle work on "The Sixth Sense," gets a chance at a more stylized
locale in the world of Elijah Price. The starkly contrasted
chrome-and-glass look combines beautifully with the costuming, from another
Shyamalan collaborator, Joanna Johnston. (See Laura's review at
www.reelingreviews.com/unbreakable.htm for a unique perspective on the
film's costume/makeup.) The film carries a vaguely sinister look throughout
that helps keep the story intact.</P>
<P>Screenwriter Shyamalan needs to get out more. His script is intelligent,
yes, but also self-indulgent. He is having fun with the mystery, the look
and the colors of the film and the film abounds with little in-jokes that
the observant viewer will see and enjoy. He is an honest writer that does
not go for the cheap shot to titillate the audience. I would like to see
the helmer work with other filmmakers and spread his creative wings more.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for the actors, this is a story-intensive flick that requires
the filmgoer to pay attention to the plot threads. As such, the thespians
are required to live within their characters rather than develop them.
Willis is conflicted as David Dunn and works hard to understand his real
gift, though there is little emotion allowed to bubble through - except in
one scene where Joseph tests David's new-found and incredible body
strength. Samuel L. Jackson always brings his all, but, even he is
overshadowed by the Gumby-hairdo and slick costume of Elijah. Clark does
fine as the incredulous son, Joseph. He and Willis play well with each
other, though the boy is not a Haley Joel Osment. Robin Wright Penn, as
David's troubled wife Audrey, does well in the tough role of understanding
wife.</P>
<P>"Unbreakable" should have a ready-made audience and do well at the
box-office as the only "serious" film out right now. It will draw an after
life on video and DVD for the fans who want to pick it apart and look for
all the little nuances in the story. Enjoy the show. I give it a B.</P>
