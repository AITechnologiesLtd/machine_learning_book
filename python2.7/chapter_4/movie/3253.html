<P>     It's a windy, stormy night somewhere in "a country in South
America after the fall of the dictatorship."  Lightning flickers,
thunder rumbles, and rain comes down in sheets.  This atmosphere, so
carefully constructed by director Roman Polanski and cinematographer
Torino Delli Colli, is by far DEATH AND THE MAIDEN's most notable
feature.  In fact, a fair impression is that too much effort went into
this aspect of the production, leaving little remaining for such minor
details as plotting and acting.</P>
<P>     The premise, which also formed the backdrop for the Ariel Dorfman
play upon which this film is based, is a solid one, brimming with
potential for a great dramatic thriller--potential that is never
realized in the film.  The story revolves around Paulina Escobar
(Sigourney Weaver) and her husband Gerardo (Stuart Wilson), a couple
living in a secluded house on an unidentified South American country's
coastline.  Both are former revolutionaries for democracy--he was the
editor of an underground newspaper; she was a courier who was raped and
tortured for protecting his identity.</P>
<P>     Now, fifteen years later, Gerardo is rescued from a car breakdown
on a lonely stretch of road by a Dr. Roberto Miranda (Ben Kingsley).
When the good doctor stops off at the Escobar house for a quick drink,
Paulina hears his voice and laugh, and recognizes in them echoes of the
man once in charge of her torture.  Right or wrong about his identity,
she takes steps to ensure that Miranda doesn't leave until her revenge
is complete.</P>
<P>     There are several problems with DEATH AND THE MAIDEN.  The
storyline is littered with contrivances.  Individually, each is
acceptable, but combined, they give the film a bloated, overplotted
feel.  Any degree of tension cultivated by Polanski is frequently
undermined by Rafael Yglesias and Ariel Dorfman's sputtering script.</P>
<P>     The central mystery is whether or not Miranda is the vicious
animal of Paulina's memories.  Unfortunately, this question is answered
far too early.  Supposedly, this is to allow the drama to swirl around
the trio of characters--but there's a flaw in the approach.  Due in
large part to lackluster acting, none of these people ever captures the
audience's sympathy.  We simply don't care one way or another about
them.  The house could explode and it wouldn't be worth more than a
shrug.</P>
<P>     Sigourney Weaver is the worst of the small cast.  Her performance
careens wildly from stilted to over-the-top with little transition in
between.  Several of her most dramatic moments are unintentionally
hilarious.  At her best, the actress is marginal; here, she's out of
her depth.  Stuart Wilson, playing her husband, isn't much better.  His
character is supposed to be relatively impotent, but Wilson plays the
part almost mechanically.  Even the reliable Ben Kingsley isn't in top
form (although he's eminently more watchable than his co-stars).</P>
<P>     As was the case with BITTER MOON, Polanski abandons all attempts
at subtlety.  Justice stands by uncertainly while the victim and
victimizer trade places.  The message, clear from the beginning, gets
hammered home relentlessly.  The resulting production ends up far too
heavy-handed to be considered powerful drama.  Perhaps the best lesson
viewers of this movie will come away with is how dangerous it can be to
pick up stranded motorists.</P>
