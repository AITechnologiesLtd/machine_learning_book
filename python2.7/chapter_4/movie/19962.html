<PRE>Dancer, Texas Pop. 81 (PG) *** 1/2
Starring Breckin Meyer, Ethan Embry
Directed by Tim McCanlies
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Dancer, Texas Pop. 81 is moviemaking gem. Yes, it does belong in the barrel of
teen films with good looking stars, but that's about it. Instead of filling our
heads with stupid romances that we don't care about, and proms we will never
attend, we are treated to a great 97 minute character study. </P>
<P>Four guys have had a solemn vow since the fifth grade that they would leave
their tiny Texas town of Dancer when they graduated from high school to go to
LA, get jobs, and be together. But soon their plans change.</P>
<P>Terrell Lee's (Peter Facinelli) father in the oil business and he wants him to
run it, even though his son doesn't want to. He forbids him to go to LA and
makes him stay. When Terrell Lee firsts tells the group this, they view it as
betrayal, but then they also stop to think about what they will be leaving
behind. What if they don't get jobs? What if they have everything they've ever
needed right in front of them?</P>
<P>John's (Eddie Mills) dad has that 18 years and out policy, he doesn't want him
to go to college, in fact, it seems as if he doesn't care about him at all.
John is an excellent rancher and is faced with a big decision. Squirrel (Embry)
has a new mother figure around that's trying to help him tame his wild and
drunk dad, and Keller (Meyer) begins to see the flaws in the plans he made.</P>
<P>Another great thing about this movie is the fact the the parents are in
control, aren't shut out of their child's lives, and aren't incredibly naive to
the problems and things that teens are exposed to.</P>
<P>All four actors are wonderful in their roles, especially Embry, as the goofy
Squirrel, he was a charming character that I liked and cared about. Meyer,
Embry, and Facinelli (all of them also appear in Can't Hardly Wait) show fine
promise as young actors in the future. The film could easily have a sequel
showing what happens to the different boys if it have been more popular.
Finding actual people in teen movies is hard. But there is not one stupid or
stereotypical character to be found in this film, that's why I liked it so
much, and that's why I give all of the 81 people that live in Dancer, Texas ***
1/2 stars.</P>
