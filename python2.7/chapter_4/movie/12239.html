<PRE>REVIEW:  Hard Rain (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<PRE>2 stars out of 5</PRE>
<P>It was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels,
you must suspend disbelief.  However, there is a distinct separation between
opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies.
It came as no surprise to me to learn that Huntingburg, Indiana (where the film
is set), does not have a McDonald's, a Sears store, a statue of a man on a
horse, nor even a dam close by.</P>
<P>Even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies (even though the dam is
crucial to Hard Rains plot); there is still a bunch of things that just dont
gel.  Firstly, Morgan Freeman, possibly the greatest actor alive (after such
films as Driving Miss Daisy, The Shawshank Redemption and Se7en), was cast as a
shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement.  He
_should_ have played the town sheriff, an experienced and somewhat intriguing
policeman.</P>
<P>As a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms Huntingburg, its
residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases.  I say
presumably simply because we never know what happened to them; and it seems a
tad strange that an entire town (with the exception of some folk who get
introduced along the way) can vanish before the flood has actually started.  But
nether the less, armored guard couriers Tom (Christian Slater) and his Uncle are
carrying three million dollars in the back of their van.  With a heavy rainstorm
causing depressing conditions and slippery roads, it doesnt take long for the
van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road.</P>
<P>Jim (Morgan Freeman) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to
steal the three million dollars.  But of course Tom is more than willing to save
the day, so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town.</P>
<P>The local sheriff (Randy Quaid, whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in
ID4) and a couple of police men investigate the situation, but their morals are
soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would
do with their share of the three million dollars.</P>
<P>Director Mikael Salomon has made sure that Hard Rain ends up turning everything
topsy-turvy, and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite goodies
versus baddies, there are numerous twists in its plot that make this a
slightly more enjoyable experience.  But by the time these interesting changes
occur, its far too late in the film for them to have much affect.  Hard Rains
continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script
may have had; and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act
well below par.</P>
<P>Not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle
between Slater and Freeman, we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do
something different and achieved more than what was expected.  Such titles as
Broken Arrow (Slater and John Travolta) and Face/Off (Nicholas Cage and John
Travolta) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations.
Strangely enough, they were both directed by John Woo and both star John
Travolta.</P>
<P>We can forgive Morgan Freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance
since he is newish to the action genre, but Christian Slater could have achieved
so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some
personality added to his character.  If you had asked me whether Slater could
perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of
Broken Arrow, my answer would have been a definite no.  I now know that he has
no excuse, and _can_ do better (if you dont believe me rent a copy of Broken
Arrow from your local video store).</P>
<P>Although Hard Rain never really works from the start, I somehow felt feelings of
missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen.  The addition of an
enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe, rather than try to
cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that cant handle anything
else.  Despite the fact that Hard Rain fails on almost every account, if your
standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film.</P>
<P>No creative flair and no inventive scenes means that Hard Rain does not stand up
well against its many competitors, but it doesnt really matter since the last
thing you would want to do after shelling about $8.50 is compare this to other
films.</P>
