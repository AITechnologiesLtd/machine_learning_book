<PRE>Detroit Rock City (R) * 1/2
Starring Edward Furlong, Sam Huntington
Directed by Adam Rifkin
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>In the wake of the Columbine shootings, there have been many discussions on the
effects that movies have on our young society. The ratings system is obviously
not well kept, allowing films like American Pie, South Park: Bigger Longer and
Uncut, and Eyes Wide Shut to pass with R ratings.  Our television is also
becoming more and more violence dominated, with shows like Pyromaniacs Caught
on Tape and Buxom Blondes and Their Hotels airing on network television
nightly. Alternative and hard rock bands are ranking high on the charts
replacing all of the regular sugar choked pop that normally reigns supreme. But
what about one of the most outrageous bands of all time? KISS, (Gene Simmons
serves as head producer) tries to resurrect their career in this movie by
trying to bring out a state of teenage rebellion, but let's get back to the
young society subject.</P>
<P>Some politicians are damning every group possible (the gay community,
Hollywood, Oliver Stone) for destroying family values, they want a better
movie, TV, and music rating system, some are even suggesting that concerts be
rated. There is one simple answer to all of these issues, not exploiting any
person on the face of the planet to this film. This should indeed be labeled
with a fair warning of the idiotic badness (OK, bad and boring word, I admit
it) for all the crude humor and the lessons in everything but the ways to run a
family.</P>
<P>Four members of the band Mystery are hanging out in their pad in the seventies
and are getting high and playing some good old- fashioned rock and roll. They
are all devoted to KISS, they punish anyone who likes disco, and escape the
high school security guard on a regular basis. When one of their mothers
discovers her son Sam is listening to the devil, ("Don't you know what KISS
stands for?" she asks, "Knights In Satan's Service.") She is even more shocked
to find tickets to see the devil in the flesh and torches her son's tickets in
an instant. </P>
<P>But not all hope is lost, one of the boys wins front row tickets in a local
call in radio station and they decide to break into St. Bernard's boarding
school where Sam in being held and go to the KISS concert. On their way they
lose their tickets again and the film follows each of their adventures while
trying to score the passes. </P>
<P>If I'm correct, they are hundreds and hundreds of people that help contribute
and see over a film. The around $8 million budget didn't make any of those
hundreds of people make a better film. This is a horrible piece of trash is
only occasionally funny because of the amount of risks that it's willing to
take for a laugh. In fact, Edward Furlong is so devoted to KISS, he decides to
try and win a male stripping contest and ends up throwing up an entire pitcher
of alcohol. The more the film pushes the envelope, the more I found the film
belonging to the catergory of "Never After Columbine." But it was released
afterwards, luckily to a small audience that does not have to undergo the pain
and anguish that I experienced. Since this review is nice and cheery, and says
great things about the movie, I'm sure that you'll want to see it, Detroit Rock
City gets * 1/2 stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film contains very strong language, constant drug and
alcohol use, horrible attitudes, violence, lots of sex scenes, and brief
nudity. Good Age: 16 & Up</P>
