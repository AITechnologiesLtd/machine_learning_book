written and directed by Audrey Wells</PRE>
<P>The seamstress down the hall has seen it several times before. A young
girl, usually in her early twenties, walks into the room of the 50
year old man. Before long, she has brought her belongings and moved
in. In a few weeks, she emerges screaming, frustrated, angry. We never
see all these women come and go, but in `Guinevere', Audrey
Wells' transfixing directorial debut, we know it all from one look
at the seamstress, an inconsequential character without a single line.</P>
<P>The 50 year old man is Connie Fitzpatrick (Stephen Rea), an Irish
photographer who is hired to document a wedding for an upscale family
of San Franciscan lawyers. During the proceedings, he meets Harper
Sloane (Sarah Polley), a family member who has been accepted to
Harvard Law, but has neither the self esteem nor the will to attend.</P>
<P>Later in the week, Harper goes to Connie's apartment/development
lab to pick up the wedding photos, and she falls deeply under the
spell of this seductive older man.  Harper, who is admittedly
camera-shy, is admitted to Connie's exclusive school for young
women, in which he shares his wisdom and art in exchange for
love. Harper is a naive nymphet, and she moves in with him.</P>
<P>As we learn through Harper's voice-over, Connie was the worst and
the greatest man she ever knew. For reasons which she doesn't know,
Connie refers to her as Guinevere.</P>
<P>However, when Harper visits with an old friend of Connie's, she
realizes that she isn't the only Guinevere who was drawn in to this
world of romance and photography, and she begins to fear the
mysterious older man. But Connie's seductive charms lure her back,
and this Lolita romance continues on. There is a scene, later in the
film, when Harper's affluent mother (Jean Smart) finds out about
the improper relationship, and she addresses the two with blunt
honesty. It is one of the more powerful scenes of `Guinevere',
and it is from that point that the romance, and the film itself,
begins to wind down.</P>
<P>Audrey Wells, who wrote `The Truth About Cats a nd Dogs', has
crafted a beautiful, clever film that manages an entirely new spin on
a May-December relationship. However, `Guinevere's' final
third is amateurish, and the conlusion is unsatisying compared to what
has preceeded it.</P>
<P>With `Guinevere', Sarah Polley finally has the leading role she
deserves, after star-making turns in Atom Egoyan's `The Sweet
Hereafter' and Doug Liman's `Go'. To Harper, she brings
the right mix of naivete and experience, and her character grows to
become three dimensional. Stephen Rea is eerily good as Connie, and
Jean Smart has a small but vital role as Harper's mother.</P>
<P>Despite being excellent for most of its running time,
`Guinevere's' wildly uneven conclusion is weird and
depressing. Wells doesn't know when to end the film, and the result
is like a bad dream.</P>
<P>However, Audrey Wells instills enough chemistry between Polley and Rea
to make `Guinevere' is still a very pleasant surprise. To me,
Sarah Polley is one of the leaders of a group of young actresses
destined for superstardom (Chloe Sevigny is another one). She has the
range to be choosy, and she can bring depth to any role.</P>
<P>In `Guinevere', subtlety plays the biggest role, and maybe on a
second viewing, I can see more through the seamstress' eyes. In the
end, `Guinevere' does falter, but it does so beautifully.</P>
