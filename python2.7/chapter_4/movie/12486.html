<PRE>The Game (1998)
* * *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Freaky and fiendish thriller that follows its internal logic almost
through to the end.</P>
<P>THE GAME is David Fincher's new movie after SE7EN, and like that movie, it
revels in the horrid feeling we have that things are scuttling around out of
sight and rearranging the chess pieces on us.</P>
<P>Michael Douglas plays a wealthy loner named Nicholas Van Orten, who spends
all day playing with other people's money and most of his night screening
his phone calls and watching CNN. His ex-wife still tries, futilely, to get
back in touch with him, and he's estranged from his brother -- who drops
back into his life one day and tells him about a weird, clandestine company
called CRS. For a fee, CRS will make your life "more interesting." Van
Orton, tempted, eventually caves in and signs up for whatever it is they
have to offer. They have a lot.</P>
<P>At first CRS seems to be something like one of those elaborate prank-pulling
firms, mixed with a live-action role-playing game. Little things go wrong in
Van Orton's life -- his briefcase gets stuck, his pen explodes, etc. -- but
they add up and go from being nuisances to outright maddening. Soon he's
running down an alley with attack dogs tearing his shoes off. Soon after
that he's being followed, stolen from, shot at, drowned, blown up, and
stranded south of the border, and I think I've missed more than a few
things. Through all of this, Van Orton tries to maintain his sanity and
enlist whoever he can to find out what's really going on.</P>
<P>The whole purpose of the game, of course, is self-encapsulating: Van Orton
is driven to find out who's screwing with him, and is then inspired to do
leaps of amateur detective work (and pure sweat). What starts as an irritant
becomes a way for him to re-evaluate how he deals with his life -- something
like full-contact est, although I doubt est was ever conducted from the
barrel of a submachine gun. It's a neat idea, but it's not quite played out
to its fullest here; the way the broken connections in his life are handled
are sewn up on the level of a bad TV docudrama, while the movie's real plot,
as frightening and convincing as it is, takes place in a completely
different world.</P>
<P>The movie's technical and thespian credits are top-notch. Fincher makes the
movie's backdrops and environments into genuinely threatening and harsh
places to be, not just movie sets; he immerses us the way SE7EN ate at the
senses as well. Douglas does a fine job of portraying a man whose nerves are
being frayed, then re-braided by hand. And Sean Penn does a nice turn as Van
Orton's brother. (Look fast for Fincher regular Mark Boone Jr. as a greasy
private eye, too.)</P>
<P>All of this doesn't change the fact that I felt a little put off by the
movie's conclusion. Without ruining anything, I'll say this: given the level
of psychic sadism shown in the movie, it's more than a little astonishing
that we get the ending we do. Maybe I was expecting the wrong thing, but
this is one of those movies where a Grand Guignol ending would have been a
perfect cap to the movie's deranged mission. Instead, we get a closed-ended
logic that while symmetrical, isn't nearly as satisfying as the tastes of
anarchy that we got throughout. But the ride is freaky and entertaining, and
unquestionably a shade different from the run of the mill.</P>
