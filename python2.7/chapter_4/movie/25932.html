Review: East is East (2000)<HR></PRE>
<PRE>[3.0/4.0]</PRE>
<P>The immigrant experience can be difficult for families where the
parents adhere to the customs of one culture, while raising their
children amidst another. This film is an exploration of this conflict,
with the additional complication that the children are interracial.</P>
<P>The film is set in the early 1970's and begins by introducing George
Khan (Om Puri), a Pakistani immigrant who 25 years earlier married a
white Englishwoman, Ella (Linda Bassett). The couple, along with their
7 children, run a small fish and chips shop in Northern England. The
large family is cramped in a small house in a working class
neighborhood and manage a decent existence on their limited income.
Their cramped quarters is often a source of conflict, but the main
source of tension by far is the clash between George's desire for the
children to strictly observe Islamic and Pakistani customs, and their
desire not to.</P>
<P>The children are able to cope by meeting George's overbearing demands
when he is around, and by doing what they want (drink, eat pork, date)
when he is not, although some individuals rebel more than the others.
The dichotomy between their actual existence and the one they present
to their father, plus the difficult manipulations required to hold the
two separate, provides much of the humor in the film. The children
manage this dual existence, but only to the point when their father
decides to arrange their marriages. This is one event where they
cannot both placate their father and satisfy themselves.</P>
<P>The story of a domineering and sometimes abusive father, and the
ensuing conflict is not particularly original. The interesting aspects
of the relationships in this story are George's motivations and his
apparent hypocrisy. George is clearly holding his children to a
stricter standard when it comes to marriage choice than he held
himself. Part of the reason is that he is proud of his own ethnicity,
but he sees that without his overt control, his children's culture
will diverge from his. George does not see his children as fully
Pakistani, so he attempts to force them to be.</P>
<P>Another reason for George's behavior has to do with why the story was
set in the 1970's. At that time, British residents of South Asian
origin were subject to more overt racism, like a political movement
for repatriation. Although there are some who will always be
prejudiced against a differing skin color, others will only reject a
person of a different culture. The Khan children have little trouble
in their associations with their contemporaries because they are
British kids just like their friends.</P>
<P>The story, written by Ayub Khan-Din and based on his original play, is
built on a solid foundation, but could have gone further in its
explorations. The conflict between George and his children exists only
at a surface level, whereas George's internal motivations are more
engaging. The film focuses more on the former, although Puri is able
to express the character as more than just a brute, as the
underwritten role might project. The relationship between George and
Ella is also seemingly rich yet underserved. Basset is convincing as a
woman who yields to her husbands demands not through fear or weakness,
but through empathy and love. It is unfortunate that the plot focus so
little on this dimension. The direction by Damien O'Donnell is capable
but not particularly noteworthy. The film does manage to balance drama
and humor, although its sense of humor can be quite crude and not all
that funny.</P>
<P>Recommended. The story does not simply use the stereotype of the
authoritarian immigrant father, and thus it presents an intelligent
examination of the cross-cultural family. The clash of mindsets is
used as both of source of conflict and of humor. The film would have
been more engaging if it had delved further into the relationship
between the parents, instead of spending too much time focusing on the
children. It will be entertaining for a general audience, but it will
have the most resonance with viewers familiar with the immigrant
experience.</P>
