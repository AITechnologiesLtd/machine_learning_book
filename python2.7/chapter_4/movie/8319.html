<P>A month ago I wrote that Speed 2 was the worst film I've ever reviewed
on paper. I didn't know at the time that I'd soon encounter and
despise Batman & Robin, which has just overtaken Speed 2 as the
picture least worthy of your attention this summer. As directed by
Joel Schumacher (who now specializes in Batman sequels and John
Grisham adaptations and isn't very good at either), B & R is one long
excuse for a Taco Bell promotion. The plot, which has Mr. Freeze and
Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) planning to take over Gotham City and then
"the vorld" (as an oddly ineffective Schwarzenegger states), is
weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust,
partnership, blah, blah, blah. But morals are not the point of this
film--topping each bloated, confusing action scene with next one
is. The garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this
picture oddly comparable to the trashy Showgirls. Since when did
Gotham City become a giant Las Vegas hotel? Only George Clooney comes
out on top; he underplays nicely and pretends like he's in a real
movie. * (out of four)</P>
