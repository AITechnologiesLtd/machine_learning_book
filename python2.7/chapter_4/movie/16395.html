<PRE>AT FIRST SIGHT
Review by Victory A. Marasigan

<P>Traveling architect Amy (Mira Sorvino) meets hunky, sexy-voiced masseur
Virgil (Val Kilmer).  Said masseur turns out to be blind.  Amy falls for
Virgil, and within what seems like a week of their first meeting, she
suggests he have his blindness "corrected" with an innovative surgery in
New York City.  Is this love?</P>
<P>At First Sight is just the sort film Hollywood thinks it can pull off
and not seem condescending. What filmmakers more often than not fail to
realize is that it is virtually impossible to succinctly capture the
full scope of the life of a blind person.  You can have an actor stand
there and flail his arms around, but that doesn't make him blind.</P>
<P>All of the lessons on vision that are espoused in the film are
overshadowed by syrupy melodrama and on-subtle preaching. Among the more
unnerving aspects of the film is the fact that Sorvino's supposedly
protagonistic my more often comes off as disruptive to Virgil's life
than helpful. For most of the movie, she's more blind than he is. Even
after the tacked on happy ending, we feel that Virgil would have
probably fared better learning on his own rather than escaping away with
his fawning client.</P>
<P>Besides Amy, many other secondary characters act with unbelievable
insensitivity towards Virgil's unique situation, including the doctor
(Bruce Davison) who helps restore his sight (Come on, what idiot doctor
lets a camera crew shine its lights in the face of a man whose never
seen before!). These ironies in characterization are, of course, the
intent of screenwriter Steve Levitt, but does he have to force it down
our throats?</P>
<P>Granted, the film may prove enlightening for some, if more for the
discussions on sense and perception it will provoke than for what
actually transpires on screen.  How do blind people manage to live their
lives? Should we feel sorry for them or not?  At First Sight works best
when it addresses ideas of the infinite suddenly becoming finite, of the
undefinable being
defined.  If there is a lesson to be taken away from it, it is that we
shouldn't feel sorry for the blind, because what they lack in sense is
made up for by a truly unique experience.  And that can be much better
than what we really see.</P>
