Someone Like You</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Ashley Judd, dejected, rejected, and neglected by men in general, seeks 
some commiseratory theory with which to explain away the enigmatic 
query, "Why can't men commit?" She finds her comforting hypothesis in 
cows ... bulls, more accurately. Bulls, tired of old cows, scan greener 
pastures for greener heifers - so she discovers. "Monogamy isn't in 
their genes!" </P>
<P>Greg Kinnear is the gentle, expressive, touchy-feely love-interest, 
while the actor (Jackman) who played Wolverine from the X-Men movie 
appropriately personifies the animal-man theory. He's absolutely 
shameless about his sexuality, yet subtly sweet; a well-drawn character 
brought to life by a strong actor. </P>
<P>Speaking of acting and writing, "Someone Like You" employs 
professionals. The dialogue and relationships move the production 
warmly, confidently, and entertainingly from beginning to end, where, 
surprisingly the picture's prowess wanes. </P>
<P>Though definitely predictable, this climax still could have soared. 
There would have been no avoiding the schmaltz - so splashing around in 
it a while ought to have been the prescription. Instead, the peak feels 
truncated with an unnecessarily cliche appendage. A respectable 
resolution follows, however. </P>
<P>Instead of just dabbling in obsessive psycho behavior, a more acutely 
de-stabilized Judd would have backed the fluff with muscle (perhaps 
exhibiting job-threatening surreal delusional episodes). </P>
<P>And those kisses! As a romantic-comedy, audiences expect kisses. 
Disappointingly, these tight-lipped pecks belie the chemistry built up 
between our big-screen lovers. </P>
<P>Ah, but high quality scenes populate most of the film, like the one in 
which an obsessive forlorn Judd petitions a surgeon to remove nasal 
glands that link her sense of smell with memories. She begins the 
consultation calm collected and civilized, but in just one short minute 
and what seems like one breath, explains her plight to tears. Finely 
directed. </P>
<P>The star power and direction iron out the wrinkles. If you're up for a 
light romantic-comedy, you'll have a fine time. </P>
