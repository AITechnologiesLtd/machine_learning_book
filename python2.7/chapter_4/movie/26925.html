<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This tearjerker melodrama proved to be a big hit commercially for the
popular silent star Mary Pickford. Mary, who felt she lacked a formal
education, studied on her own with the screenwriter Frances Marion, a
close female friend, and became interested in the Francis J. Locke novel
brought to her attention during one of those tutoring sessions, thinking
it would make a great picture. What is unique about the film, is that
she plays a dual role, in one part she's the attractive Stella Maris,
born paralyzed and unable to walk, who resides in a wealthy London
household, shielded from the horrors of the real world by her
well-meaning but short-sighted parents, Sir Oliver Blount (Herbert
Standing) and Lady Blount (Ida Waterman), who think it best for her not
to see how others may suffer. She also gets a chance to show how
unattractive she can look in her other role as the unloved orphan Unity
Blake, which dismayed the studio boss Adolph Zukor. There is one scene
where they both are together, and this was accomplished by the method of
double-exposure.</P>
<P>John Risca (Conway Tearle) is a well-known journalist and wealthy friend
of Sir Oliver and Lady Blount, and a frequent visitor to see the
bed-ridden Stella and her dog Teddy. He has been unhappily married for
the last six years to Louise (Camille Ankewitch), a commoner with a
nasty disposition due to her drinking problem. Stella is purposefully
lied to about John's marital status in order for her to think of
everything only in ideal terms. She just thinks the world of him, saying
he is her ideal man, and is always playful with him during his visits.</P>
<P>Louise is separated from John because of her drinking problem and needs
a servant for the house. She goes to the orphanage and brings Unity into
her home. When Louise is drunk and Unity comes home without the
groceries she was asked to get, after some kids stole her shopping
basket, she severely beats the child up. This results in her getting a
three year prison term. To atone for what happened to Unity, John adopts
her. He, at first, tries raising her in the Blount's home, but they
don't want her there -- they pity her but don't love her. They tell
Stella she's the new seamstress and keep them from meeting, afraid that
Stella will see how miserable others are. They soon get John to take her
away to live with his Aunt Gladys (Josephine Crowell).</P>
<P>Unity falls in love with John because he is kind to her, but realizes
she never can be his. But she tries to get an education to please him
and help herself. Meanwhile, Stella gets an operation and after three
years she can walk again. She visits John and they fall in love, but she
still doesn't know that he's married.</P>
<P>Disturbed that he moved out of the 'castle' she was told he lives at,
she visits the castle to surprise him, hoping to fix it up so that they
can live there when they get married. But she is greeted at the house by
Louise, who was just released from prison. Stella is heartbroken at
finding out that even John, whom she thought was her ideal man, had lied
to her about everything. She already learned that the world is full of
misery by reading in the newspapers about murder and meeting beggars in
the street.</P>
<P>Spoiler to follow. Skip to the last paragraph if you don't want to know
how the story is resolved.</P>
<P>The film's melodramatic climax results, when Unity decides to repay John
for his kindness by killing Louise. Realizing that she can't have him,
she writes him a note telling him to get together with Stella. She not
only shoots Louise dead but shoots herself, thereby the police think it
was a revenge murder.</P>
<P>The film ends on a happy note, as Stella finally realizes that happiness
can only come from within and she marries John, not letting Unity's
self-sacrifice go to waste.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly, the film is dated, but for its time and the excellent way
the film was crafted, it succeeds as a popular soap opera type of
vehicle. Though, by having Pickford, "America's Sweetheart," commit a
murder, its ethics and reasons for doing so can certainly be questioned,
though the happy ending satisfied the public. Many film critics felt
that this was the best role that Pickford ever had. Though the film was
as heavy as goo, it was not without some passing interest for mainly
historical reasons.</P>
