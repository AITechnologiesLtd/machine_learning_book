<PRE>Rat Race</PRE>
<PRE>Full Price Feature</PRE>
<P>"What!  Full Price Feature?!"  Believe me, I am as shocked as you are.  I
fully expected to come out of that theatre with a couple of amusing
moments, smiling maybe, nut not much more.  I can't give away what was
funny about the movie without ruining it, so I will have to rely on
detailing our reaction to the film.  Not only did I laugh my freakin' butt
off (as did my three very diverse companions) pretty much the whole time
(after a mite slow beginning), but the four of us were still cracking up,
loudly, walking out of the theatre and into the car and most of the drive
home.  We recollected all our favorite moments, which were legion, and
laughed afresh.  It was the simple, unaffected laughter of delight in
simple, easy pleasure.  Guffawing, if you will.  Now that's funny!
Remember in the date montage in Naked Gun when Leslie Nielsen and Priscilla
Presley come out of Platoon clutching their guts and laughing?  That was
us, except instead of Platoon, it was Rat Race!  So, with my pricing schema
of dollar value for entertainment received, this is indeed a Full Price
Feature.  I want to see it again!</P>
<P>Now if course I have built it up too much, but I have peeked at ratings on
other sites and they seem to agree.  What looks like a disjointed,
multi-storyline wackofest is actually a beautifully shot, action-packed
comedy with a little something for everyone.  Some of the jokes telegraph
themselves a mile away, and a lot of people seem to crash vehicles through
fences, but for some reason, it all works!  My favorite shot, which I do
not want to give away, literally had me hopping up in down in my seat, even
though it was apparent what would happen and how it would be, it was the
execution that was so hilarious.  It was like a cartoon come to life, in a
good way.  If you need your humor to be dry and verbose, well, you weren't
honestly expecting that after looking at those creepy big-head-big-hand
posters, were you?  I hope you like those images because they also are the
main visual crux of the official movie site and the opening credits.</P>
<P>The characters are a diverse group of actors and comedians who have very
little character interaction outside of their teams in the race, yet the
sense of working together to a common comedic goal is still felt.  A good
story involves the dynamics between people, but this story can rely on the
over-reaching theme of greed to unite the people who are otherwise apart on
screen.  But the miniature teams of one or 2 or 4 all have their own magic
as well.  It's the details, however, that really make it work.  I wish I
could give away things but I fear the trailer has already done some of that
for me.  I never would have seen it if not for the previews, so I guess it
was a necessary evil.  I now wish to see the original film upon which this
one was based, It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, to see if it compares.</P>
<P>Bizarre situation exacerbated by wicked machination with reincorporation
and huge reaction equals comedy.  There's slapstick, situational humor,
subtle physicality, tumbling disaster, Darwin-award behavior, good natured
humor, mistaken identity, peril, insanity, over-the-top, observational
humor, corn-pone chuckles, surreal visual gags, and even an homage to a
classic Lucy episode - whatever you like, they got it!  It's a Zucker film.
So go get it!</P>
