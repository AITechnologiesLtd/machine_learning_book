<P>     The events of THE EIGHTEENTH, Anders Ronnow-Klarlund's feature
debut, transpire on the day when Danes voted to join the European Union: 
May 18, 1993.  That date was a watershed for the country, and more than
80% of all eligible voters turned out to cast a ballot.  And, even
though well over 50% of the vote was to join, dissidents rioted in the
streets of Copenhagen after the results had been announced.  THE
EIGHTEENTH, which takes place with this as its backdrop, is a Robert
Altman-like telling of three separate stories highlighting characters
whose personal problems are of more immediate concern than those on a
national level.</P>
<P>     The first story introduces us to Ulla, a jazz singer and loving
mother who is running late for her daughter's birthday party.  8-year
old Sara, who lives with her father but adores her mother, is unable to
enjoy the celebration until Mom, who is having a really bad day (she
suddenly finds herself homeless), arrives.  Meanwhile, elsewhere in
Copenhagen, Jens, an inmate in a psychiatric hospital, learns that he's
going to be confined for at least another 30 days.  Fearful that his
girlfriend will dump him during that period, Jens escapes and goes on
the run from the police.  Finally, there's Michael, a top salesman for
ScanPaper computer paper, who decides to please his Italian clients by
fixing them up with a pair of call girls who turn out to be something
other than what was advertised.</P>
<P>     Although everyone in THE EIGHTEENTH is consumed by their personal
crises, no one forgets about the vote.  With her world on the verge of
collapse, Ulla nevertheless makes sure she gets to the polls.  Michael,
a staunch pro-Unionist (it's good for business) takes time out of his
busy schedule.  And even though Jens can't vote (his psychiatric
problems render him ineligible), he makes it clear that he thinks he has
a right to cast a ballot.  By depicting the reactions of three very
different characters to the political situation, Ronnow-Klarlund
illustrates how important the vote was to Denmark's identity.</P>
<P>     Ronnow-Klarlund utilizes an unusual visual style to differentiate
between the three stories.  Ulla and Sara's segments are seen through an
amber filter, Jens' episode is in grainy black-and-white, and Michael's
scenes display little or no visual enhancement.  In the beginning, as
THE EIGHTEENTH moves rapidly from one tale to another, the change in
style is a helpful aid in keeping all of the characters and situations
straight.  By the end, however, it has become somewhat repetitive.</P>
<P>     As one might reasonably expect, there is some crossing of paths,
although the characters don't know each other.  One of these incidents
is inconsequential, but another changes the direction of two of the
stories.  Chance brings the characters together, their lives momentarily
intersect, then the natural course of events pulls them apart again.  In
one sense, THE EIGHTEENTH is a meditation about the sometimes-cruel
workings of Fate -- how the briefest, most unexpected encounters can
have a more lasting impact than long-term relationships.  Although THE
EIGHTEENTH isn't as powerful as Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS, with which
it shares an obvious kinship, it is nevertheless effective in creating
believable characters to populate its often-fascinating, thematically-
rich narrative.</P>
