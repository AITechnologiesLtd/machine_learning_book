<P>Because Academy Award nominations are just around the corner, autumn
is the one season that brings around a surplus of big "small" films --
motion pictures that may boast strong credentials but rely more on
powerful story-telling than showy special effects to wow you
over. Most of these movies are period pieces, and most of these period
pieces have been among the best filmmaking of our time -- 1993's "The
Age of Innocence," 1994's "Little Women," 1995's "Sense and
Sensibility" and last November's "The English Patient." This year's
hopeful appears to be "Washington Square," and whether or not it's got
the potential to be Oscar bait has yet to be seen due to its
early-fall release date. But don't let timing throw you off --
"Washington Square" deserves a whole mantlepiece of awards.</P>
<P>Adapted from the Henry James novel, "Washington Square" tells the
story of Catherine Sloper (Jennifer Jason Leigh), an heiress who lives
in the titular New York estate in the mid-1850s. Catherine's birth
killed her mother, and she has spent her entire life listening to
resentful remarks from her wealthy physician father (Albert Finney)
that she holds none of his late wife's beauty, charm or
elegance. Catherine's whimsical Aunt Lavinia (Maggie Smith) dismisses
her brother-in-law's harsh criticism and tries to encourage her aloof,
shy niece.</P>
<P>At a party, Catherine attracts the attention of alluring wastrel
Morris Townsend (Ben Chaplin, last seen in "The Truth About Cats and
Dogs"). Overcome with the prospect of a loving relationship, she
whole-heartedly commits herself to Morris. Mr. Sloper, however, has
other ideas, namely that the young, penniless man has ulterior motives
-- that instead of wanting her, he might want her money -- and
threatens to cut Catherine off financially if she marries him.</P>
<P>After Hollywood's recent obsession with Jane Austen ("Clueless,"
"Emma," "Persuasion" and "Sense and Sensibility"), it's completely
reasonable that they should move onto Henry James -- "Washington
Square" is the second James adaptation (after last winter's "The
Portrait of a Lady") in less than a year, and his "The Wings of the
Dove" is scheduled for release next month. Those put off by
"Portrait"'s bizarre execution needn't worry at this James go-around,
because "Washington Square" is told in a much more accessible,
straightforward manner. The story is extremely easy to be pulled into
because, presumably, we can all relate to the awkwardness and
confusion Catherine feels.</P>
<P>As far as acting is concerned, "Washington Square" is flawless. Leigh,
usually cast as problem-plagued yuppies, makes a strong case as to why
she should do period films more often. She's exhibits a strong,
emotional presence, and when her heart breaks, so does ours. Smith
steals the movie with her dotty characterization; when Lavinia
secretly meets Morris in a house of ill repute, her suggestive
mannerisms brighten the proceedings up to an unbelievably lively
level. Chaplin and Finney are excellent in very difficult roles. Their
subtle, focused acting allows us to read their motivations differently
at various times. Is Morris offering pursuit for a monetary gain? Or
is Mr. Sloper simply underestimating his daughter's beauty? Chaplin
and Finney are so good at masking their impetuses that when these
questions are finally answered, it's a shock.</P>
<P>Also on display in the film is my wonderful Baltimore locale, with
Union Square making a surprisingly exceptional substitute for
Washington Square. (Who knew how gorgeous the place would look with
all of the drug needles swept up?) To be fair, though, everything in
this movie sparkles with period detail; the costumes, the art
direction, the set design, the original score -- they all contribute
to every accurate, beautiful spectacle. All of the high-level
technical credits never allow "Washington Square" to look bad for a
single moment -- even a scene where Catherine collapses in the rain on
a muddy street is a sigh-worthy sight.</P>
<P>Director Agnieszka Holland showed off her visual prowess for adapting
the classics a few summers ago with "The Secret Garden." That was a
nice movie, but with "Washington Square," she has created a place to
go back to again and again. Eloquence can often hide missteps, but not
here -- it heightens the film's uncountable strengths. From opening
credits to final scene -- which, by the way, is done with
applause-inducing originality -- "Washington Square" is an honestly
majestic gem.</P>
