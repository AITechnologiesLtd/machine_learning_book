<PRE>The Deep End Of the Ocean (1999)
Reviewed by Larry McGillicuddy 1999</PRE>
<P>Rating: ** (out of 4)
Directed by Ulu Grossbard
Starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams, Jonathan Jackson, Ryan 
Merriman, John Kapelos, Whoopi Goldberg</P>
<P>The Deep End of the Ocean is a drama based on the bestselling book by 
Jacqueline Mitchard (sp?). I'm sure the book itself is fine, but it 
was probably not a good idea to transfer it to film. Many scenes, 
such as one where Michelle Pfeiffer breaks down in an emotional fit 
and bites her husband's hand, may have read well on paper, but on 
film all they do is provoke laughter from the audience.              </P>
<P>Pfeiffer is a mother of three whose younger son Ben is kidnapped 
while she was making reservations at her high school reunion. The 
first half of the film deals with the aftermath of this loss and how 
the family copes with it. Pfeiffer turns into an emotional recluse 
and the older son Vincent starts to    
rebel. The father, played by Treat Williams, tries his best to hold 
the family together. The film takes way too much time here, telling 
us very little. It doesn't favor comparably with an early 80s film 
called Without a Trace. Kate Nelligan's cold, distant performance as 
the mother in that film was far more interesting and dramatically 
effective than Michelle Pfeiffer's crying and shouting here.</P>
<P>Then the setting shifts to nine years later, where the family has 
moved to a suburban neighborhood in Chicago. Everyone except Vincent 
seems to have recovered from the incident and the family appears to 
have moved on with their lives. One day a young boy shows up at their 
door asking if they   
need their lawn mowed. He lookes remarkably like Ben, the kidnapped 
son. A fingerprint match confirms this and Ben is reunited with his 
family.</P>
<P>The film here tries to explore complex relationships within the 
family and with Ben's adoptive father, who he still calls dad. The 
filmmakers are far more successful here, but there are still problems.
 As Ben, young Ryan Merriman is not up to the challenge of playing 
such a complex role. Not enough is done with Ben's adoptive father, 
played with admirable honesty by John Kapelos. In particular, the 
final scene feels false because it was not preceded by a scene with 
Kapelos and Merriman, that wouldve been crucial to the plot 
development.</P>
<P>If there is one great thing in The Deep End of the Ocean, it is 
Jonathan Jackson's portrayal of the older Vincent. The films most 
touching moments come when it explores the relationship of the two 
brothers, and this is mostly due to the strength and depth of 
Jackson's performance. He is so good, we can predict a scene of 
personal revelation one hour before the screenplay decides it's time 
to tell us in the final scene, And the final scene works on it's own, 
but it needed a preceding scene with Kapelos and a followup scene 
with the parents. Many more wounds needed to be healed but 
unfortunately the screenwriter was too lazy to attempt that.</P>
