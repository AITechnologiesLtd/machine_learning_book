<PRE>As Good As It Gets
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Jack Nicholson; Helen Hunt; Greg Kinnear; Cuba Gooding Jr. & Skeet
Ulrich</P>
<P>Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Oscars for their performances in As
Good As It Gets, and Greg Kinnear was nominated for his performance as well.
For a movie that received such attention at the awards ceremonies, it was
certainly a heck of a disappointment. As Good As It Gets was marketed as
sort of a romantic comedy, but this movie was short on comedy and the
romance was the pits.</P>
<P>Nicholson plays an obsessive-compulsive writer who, to put it bluntly, is
obnoxious. He falls in love with his waitress at the local restaurant (Helen
Hunt), who just happens to have a gravely ill son. Throw in to the mix
Nicholson's gay next door neighbor (Greg Kinnear), who Nicholson's character
takes great delight in tormenting and you have the basis for a movie that
isn't that great. Certainly not worthy of all the critical acclaim that it
has received. But then again, what do critics know? Adding to the intricate
plot twists of the movie (I'm being sarcastic here, just in case you missed
it), Kinnear's character gets beaten up when he walks in on burglars. So by
some miracle of modern cinematic genius, Kinnear, Hunt and Nicholson go off
on some road trip so Kinnear's character can go beg his parents for money to
tide him over until he recovers from his injuries. It sounds stranger than
it actually is, but it really isn't significantly better.</P>
<P>If it were anyone else other than Jack Nicholson playing the role of the
obsessive-compulsive belligerent lead character, I will go out on a limb and
say that this movie would have crashed and burned within the first ten
minutes. But since it is Jack, no matter how unlikable the character is, you
still have to begrudgingly be rooting for him. Nicholson injected enough
humor into the part to prevent me from hating the character. As for Helen
Hunt, I have no idea why she ever won an Oscar for her performance. Her
acting abilities are not bad, but the character was so whiny that I kept
wondering what the heck Nicholson's character saw in her. Next to Nicholson,
Greg Kinnear gave the most solid performance in this film, although even he
was also a little on the whiny side. Cuba Gooding Jr. should also be
mentioned as one of Kinnear's gay friends. Cuba stole every scene he was in,
including those that he shared with Nicholson -- no small feat.</P>
<P>Aside From the good performances from Nicholson, Kinnear, and Gooding, there
is really no other reason to recommend that people actually sit through As
Good As It Gets. The love story isn't that compelling. I never cared if
Nicholson and Hunt ever got together. On top of that, Nicholson mellowed far
too quickly for my liking. At the first of the film he was just plain
obnoxious, towards the end he was almost likable which seemed to be just a
little too convenient for my tastes. As Good As It Gets ranks as one of the
bigger disappointments in recent years.</P>
