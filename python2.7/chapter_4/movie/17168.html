      Be forewarned. </P>
<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   Industry cynics and detractors of the recent groundbreaking agreement
   between Columbia and top WGA screenwriters need only consider Risa
   Bramon Garcia's feature film debut 200 CIGARETTES to be persuaded of
   the necessity of a good script.  Shana Larsen's tepid, exasperating
   screenplay is so consistently witless that even the gifted ensemble
   cast on display here is largely helpless to salvage much of
   consequence from this mess.</P>
<P>   In this case, it's a remarkable assemblage of thesps: the list of
   players reads like a roll-call of some of Hollywood's most promising
   and appealing young actors.  Among them include Martha Plimpton, a
   consistently underappreciated talent; Janeane Garofalo, who
   invariably can be counted upon to walk in and steal the scene in
   everything she does; Paul Rudd, such an affable presence in CLUELESS
   (and who survived the lame THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION); Courtney
   Love, whose beguiling turn in THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT was a
   revelation; Christina Ricci, now clearly among the top actors of her
   generation; and both Affleck brothers (Casey provided particularly
   strong support in TO DIE FOR).  These are performers whose mere
   presence in a film would merit minor interest -- package them all
   into one movie, and my curiosity is piqued.</P>
<P>   Crushingly, the cast is wasted in a tawdry collection of would-be
   comic pratfalls, paired off in meandering threads to preen and
   screech and volley lousy dialogue back and forth.  The whiny
   characters are so thoroughly and relentlessly obnoxious (save for
   Kate Hudson's poised, prim young lady, who naturally become the butt
   of the picture's running gag and gets to spend half the movie
   wandering through scenes with dog excrement liberally smeared on her
   jacket -- yes, this is indicative of the film's level of humour) that
   none of the subplots are remotely engaging.  The rambling multiple
   storylines weave and ultimately intersect during the
   seemingly-interminable running time, but I'd hesitate to describe the
   overly-cluttered 200 CIGARETTES as Altmanesque: here's a film where
   the destination is not only inevitable, but it's no fun getting
   there, either.</P>
<P>   Set in New York City's East Village on New Year's Eve, 1981, the
   theme of the film is, of course, love -- or at least its distant
   cousin, sex.  On their way to a party, in rapid succession we
   regretfully meet our dozen-odd characters: longtime pals Kevin (Mr.
   Rudd) and Lucy (Ms. Love), who may or may not take their friendship
   to the next level; neurotic party host Monica (Ms. Plimpton) and
   ex-flame Eric (Brian McCardle), who analyse their failed
   relationship in pseudo-comic fashion; Val (Ms. Ricci) and Stephie
   (Gaby Hoffman), who (in the movie's most ineffectual subplot) teeter
   around in high heels and constantly squabble with ridiculously
   unauthentic accents while in frantic search of the festivities;
   Bridget (Nicole Parker) and Caitlyn (Angela Featherstone), scrambling
   to find some male companionship of the one-night stand ilk before the
   stroke of midnight, and so on.  Ambling through the threads is Disco
   Cabbie (Dave Chapelle), suavely doling out sagelike advice like a
   Venus Flytrap on wheels.</P>
<P>   Although the ostensible destination is Monica's year-end bash, amidst
   the overbroad slapstick it remains clear that the plot-thin picture's
   interest lies with the humour-tinged dissection of the convoluted
   nature of relationships amongst the self-absorbed twentysomething
   crowd depicted here: in this respect, it's a bit like a Kevin Smith
   script -- albeit without clever dialogue, wryly astute observation,
   endearing characters and Star Wars references, which doesn't leave it
   with very much.  Love can be funny, in all sense of the word, but
   with these repugnant characters run through such startlingly unfunny
   scenarios, it's all too easy to not give a hoot about their romantic
   fates.</P>
<P>   The only thing this excruciating picture has going for it is its
   retro soundtrack, chock-ladened with pop hits of the era -- some 49
   in total -- which run throughout the entire film to evoke the period
   (although the gaudy costume work is more than enough to consequently
   negate this).  Befitting a casting director in her helming debut, Ms.
   Garcia has filled the picture with much talent -- I have to assume
   that the cast was largely drawn to this venture because of her
   relative clout (casting credits include such big-budget Hollywood
   spectacles as TWISTER, THE PEACEMAKER, SPEED 2, and HARD RAIN) --
   only to maddeningly see it go to waste.  For the most part, the cast
   are real troupers and dutifully wade through this morass of tripe
   (Ms. Garofalo arguably comes off the best, although Ben Affleck goes
   through the picture with a vaguely pained expression with which I
   could empathise), but are understandably unable to surmount the level
   of this material.  A superior showcase for Kate Hudson, Casey Affleck
   and Christina Ricci would be the upcoming Morgan J. Freeman film
   DESERT BLUE -- but then again, this isn't too difficult of a feat.</P>
