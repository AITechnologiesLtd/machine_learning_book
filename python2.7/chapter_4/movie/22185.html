<PRE>Marvelous Anticipation
The Cradle Will Rock</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>This film's first shot unwinds with the patience, beauty and discipline of
an ornate grandfather clock. It's a great set up for a movie that seems to
be mostly setup anyway. Rich replication of the touch and feel of a 1930's
motion picture creates the illusion of simplicity. But, the myriad
characters and motivations are so vast, the dialogue and themes so intense
that, ultimately, you'll be surprised to be viewing quite a complex film.
Writer/Director/Producer Tim Robbins (responsible also for "Dead Man
Walking," but perhaps better known as the lead actor in "Shawshank
Redemption") says he spent seven years writing and re-writing this web of a
script.</P>
<P>The staged musical feel lends yet another hand toward sculpting the
ironically false sense of lightness. It's a masterfully crafted, directed,
powerfully paced and dramatically filmed work whose only fault lies in the
viewer's need to wait virtually two full hours for payoff. The pace is so
fierce and the web so intricate, that the set up is completed just as the
climax begins. Still, the payoff genuinely pleases, mustering up a lump or
two in the throat.</P>
<P>Americans face the harsh reality of depression complicated by the
unionization tribulations and the government's commie paranoia. Along with
other Work Programs, FDR spearheads "Federal Theater" designed to put
artists back to work while providing low cost entertainment for the masses.
A fine plan indeed, until the government realizes that their commissioned
artists have rather "politically incorrect" (for the time) themes to
express. The film focuses on a theater group directed by Orson Welles
(played by Angus MacFadyen) as it develops a musical ("The Cradle Will
Rock") so controversial that the participants must jeopardize their rare and
precious jobs to continue.</P>
<P>Other historic personalities are brought back to life as censorship debates
arise, making this a great film for the high school history teacher to
present in class.</P>
<P>You'll marvel at it .. simply marvel. But you may not "feel" until the
climax.</P>
