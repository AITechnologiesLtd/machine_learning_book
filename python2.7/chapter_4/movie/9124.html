<PRE>The Peacemaker (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The Peacemaker arrives on screens under considerably more scrutiny than
an average late-September action release.  First of all, it's the
inaugural motion picture release from Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey
Katzenberg, and David Geffen's studio, DreamWorks SKG, launched with much
fanfare three years ago.  The second concern is one that was not foreseen
at the time of the film's production: the questionable box office
bankability of lead George Clooney, whose popularity on television's ER
has not translated into blockbuster box office grosses for From Dusk till
Dawn, the underrated One Fine Day, and the justly maligned stinkbomb
Batman & Robin.  So does this Tom Clancy-esque thriller deliver the goods
under pressure?  Yes--it's certainly exciting enough to leave audiences
sufficiently entertained for a couple of hours, but that's all.</P>
<P>But what can you expect when the basic plot of Michael Schiffer's
screenplay (based on, as the credits read, "an article by Andrew and
Leslie Cockburn") is as thin as they come (OK, maybe not as thin as
Twister's)?  A cache of nuclear warheads is stolen from a train in
Russia, and it's up to Special Forces intelligence officer Col. Thomas
Devoe (Clooney) and the head of the White House Nuclear Smuggling Group,
Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman) to recover them, setting up one big
globe-hopping chase after the weapons and the terrorists who stole 
them.</P>
<P>Schiffer and director Mimi Leder don't take this story in any new
directions; familiar action staples such as car and helicopter chase
sequences, running through crowded streets, big explosions, and (would a
bomb thriller be complete without one?) a
hurry-the-hell-up-and-disarm-the-bomb-before-we-all-blow-up-to-kingdom-come
scene are present here.  And some touches cannot help but remind one of
some of the cast and crew's previous credits: Leder's extensive steadicam
use recalls her ER work; a prolonged piano-playing scene, complete with
closeups of fingers on keys, reminds one of co-star Armin Mueller-Stahl's
Shine; and Devoe and Kelly encounter a character named--gag--Schumacher. 
But Leder directs it all with a fairly quick pace and high energy level,
most notably in the opening hijack scene and a rousing car
chase/demolition derby in the streets of Vienna.</P>
<P>Similarly energized is Clooney, who fits this role much more snugly than
his infamous last.  His self-effacing manner feels more at home here than
it did for the Caped Crusader, but this is not to say that he's smiley
and jokey all of the time.  When called on to do action hero derring-do,
he's up to the task, making good on the largely forgotten "serious
action" promise he displayed in Dusk.  Thankfully, no contrived romantic
angle is developed between Devoe and Kelly, but that's even more for the
better here since little spark of any kind develops between Clooney and
Kidman, who seems a little ill-at-ease here.  Granted, she isn't given
anything really strenuous to do here (unless you count swimming laps),
but something is clearly, oddly amiss when her usually flawless American
accent slips into her natural Aussie every now and again.</P>
<P>With little competition in the action arena right now, the solidly made
The Peacemaker should keep Clooney's film career afloat (for now, at
least) and get DreamWorks Pictures off on a successful start--but the
film still can't help but feel like somewhat of a letdown.  It is a
sturdy, entertaining popcorn movie, and while that may be good enough for
any other studio at any other time, as the maiden film voyage of S, K,
and G's much-hyped zillion-dollar enterprise, it's a dismayingly
nondescript piece of formula product.</P>
