<PRE>On connait la chanson
A review by Vincent Merlaud (1998)</PRE>
<P>Directed by Alain Resnais
Written by Jean-Pierre Bacri and Agnes Jaoui
With Pierre Arditi,  Sabine Azema, Jean-Pierre Bacri, Andre Dussolier,
Agnes Jaoui and Lambert Wilson</P>
<PRE>120 min, 1:1.66, color
opened November 12 in France</PRE>
<P>Let's put it this way: Alain Resnais's latest experimentation opens
with Wehrmacht officers discussing the fate of Paris. The year is
1944, and von Cholitz, officer in command at the time, explains why he
will not destroy Paris. A little music is heard, and the character
goes on singing with Josephine Baker's voice "J'ai deux amours, mon
pays et Paris". Then it goes forwards to 1997, with Camille's gloved
hand showing tourists in the Rue de Rivoli where the former scene took
place.</P>
<P>It's known to everyone that ever since his first shorts with
Chris. Marker, Alain Resnais has never got tired of movie-making
experimentations, from the structural bizarreness of L'annee derniere
a Marienbad to his precedent twin-films Smoking and No smoking, where
duality of life was fully explored (it should be noticed that although
Resnais seems open to any new idea in the film-making field, he has
been working with the same technical crew and actors for an
eternity). What surprised me on this occasion is how well received the
film is in his own country, where audiences usually madly laughs
whenever a character starts singing. On connait la chanson is however
not a musical, which might explain these overwhelming reactions - this
is so far Resnais' most profitable feature. In fact, dialogues are
often interrupted with verses, if not whole choruses, from popular
songs - I should accurately write chansons- taken in a wide scope
including Charles Aznavour, France Gall and Dalida. They are sung by
their original interpretes, while actors on the screen only articulate
lyrics. Afterthe acclimatation of the first sung lines, this strange
process stops being odd and one can get really convinced that for
instance Alain Delon becomes Jean Pierre Bacri - a proof of this
occurs later on with Jane Birkin, to whom it has been allowed to sing
her own "Quoi" with her own voice.</P>
<P>Used by any other filmaker, this implied distanciation would probably
kill any aspect of realism and turn the film into avant-garde
drama. Thanks to a clever script and a fine dialogue, On connait la
chanson is a major achievement. Most of the viewers will probably not
consider the film's characters as total strangers, the sung lines
actually building a kind of over- conversation revealing people's
weakness and fears: far from being an optimistic work of art - as were
Arthur Freed's musicals - On connait la chanson could indeed be
regarded as the ultimate film about depression.</P>
<P>Apparently: Camille (A.J.), the guide from the first comtemporary
scene, believes she'll be happy when her doctor-thesis is
finished. She helps her sister Odile (S.A.) looking for a new
appartement and fells in love with Marc (L.W.), from the real estate
agency - she saw him crying and thinks he is a very sensitive
man. Camille is secretely loved by Simon (A.D.), a radio- plays writer
who often attends her guided-tours and annoys her. Odile still loves
her husband Claude (P.A.) and saw his look-alike in a car kissing
another woman. Nicolas (J.-P. B.) does not love anybody and is seen by
Odile accompanied by numerous gorgeous women. Marc sells Odile a vast
appartement with a view on Montmartre.</P>
<P>But these men and women are suffering much but ignore what from.
Diseases, misunderstandings, lies contaminating lives. Claude lies to
his wife - he does not love her anymore. Marc lied to his client: a
new construction will hide the Sacre-Coeur. Simon lied to his beloved
- he works for the real-estate agency too and Marc is his
boss. Nicolas lies to himself: his londonian wife will not come back
to him. False interpretation of facts : Odile refuses to believe her
eyes when she caught her husband on the act with his mistress. Nicolas
is a limousine-chauffeur and therefore drives rich and beautiful
women. Marc had a cold and did not missed his ex-girlfriend. Marc is
indeed very arrogant, and particulry rude towards his employee
Simon. Camille, the youngest and the perhaps the most deceived of all,
fell in love with the wrong man and falls in a deep depression as soon
as her thesis is ended up. In the end, singing becomes a way of lying
as well, but characters may finally not only be invaded by the same
fatalism: what they have in common and sometimes sing together are
indentical human feelings. Same old song that we all know. As for Mon
oncle d'Amerique and La vie est un roman, On connait la chanson ends
in a joyous mood, an uncertain form of melancoly.</P>
