<P>     This splatter spoof from long-time genre director Wes Craven (A
NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET) wraps with a finale so uproarious and over-
the-top that I left the theater almost giddy.  The sequence, one of the
year's more-memorable and pure gold for anyone with a taste for blood,
is set at a Friday night slasher-movie marathon, with a trivia-testing
masked killer knifing everyone in the house, from the obligatory teenage
girl in the tight top to the wiseacre half-nerd horror-expert.  That guy
also gets the biggest laughs in the movie, both on-screen and off, when
he stands up to recite The Rules:  "Never have sex.  Never drink or do
drugs.  And, never, ever, say 'I'll be right back.'" And, of course they
do, and they are, and more than one person exits a room, never to
return.  You'll die, too, laughing as Craven recreates a scene from
HALLOWEEN, and then cross-cuts between it and the original, the latter
playing on a VCR.  If only the rest of the movie were as ingenious.  In
fact, the first hour so closely (cheaply?) resembles the source material
that you may just fall asleep.</P>
