<P>Synopsis: Inmate Colin Briggs (Owen) is transferred to an experimental 
open-air prison. There, he meets venerable Fergus Wilks (Kelly), who 
sparks in Colin a seemingly incongruous interest in gardening. Colin 
convinces the prison governor to allow him to start a flower garden on the 
grounds, bringing him in contact with expert Georgina Woodhouse (Mirren) 
and her lovely daughter Primrose (Natasha Little). Thanks to Georgina's 
influence, the convicts receive an invitation to a major gardening 
competition. But will their pasts catch up with them before the big day?</P>
<P>Review: "Greenfingers" is a good-natured British comedy very much in the 
vein of "Saving Grace". Indeed, both mingle gardening with criminal 
activity, and fans of the latter will likely find much to enjoy in the 
former. British comedy tends toward two extremes: movies filled with 
outlandish set pieces (like the "Monty Python" films) and movies in which 
the comedy arises directly from real life, without indulging in one-liners 
or awkward set-ups. "Greenfingers" is very much of this second type: the 
humour here is derived directly from the simple idea of a group of 
convicts taking an interest in gardening, and from the personalities of 
the chief players. Those raised on more sitcom-like fare may find this 
low-key approach dull, but audiences with a broader appreciation of comedy 
should find it thoroughly delightful and refreshing. Of course, this sort 
of movie is highly dependent on the performances of its leads in 
enabling us to relate to the circumstances. Fortunately, "Greenfingers" 
boasts several fine contributions, particularly from Clive Owen, whose 
Colin is sympathetic but nonetheless retains an edge which reminds us that 
he is, all the same, a criminal. Also highly enjoyable is Helen Mirren; 
although "Greenfingers" scarcely taps into the full range of her acting 
talent, Mirren is hilarious as a sort of British Martha Stewart.</P>
