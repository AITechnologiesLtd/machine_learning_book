<PRE>                     THE NAKED GUN 2 1/2: THE SMELL OF FEAR
                          A film review by Ken Johnson
                           Copyright 1991 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>89 min., PG-13, Comedy, 1991
Director: David Zucker
Cast: Leslie Nielsen, Priscilla Presley, George Kennedy, O. J. Simpson,
      Robert Goulet</PRE>
<P>Synopsis: Los Angeles Cop Frank Drebin, Nielsen, is invited to a lunch
with the President of the United States.  At the lunch, the President
announces that a scientist will unveil his suggestions for the new U.S.
energy plan at a public meeting.  Of course, whatever the scientist says
will go into effect.  The coal, oil, and nuclear energy spokespeople
suspect that the scientist's recommendation will be for more energy from
the sun.  That would greatly hinder their business.  At the time of the
meeting the scientist's laboratory is bombed.  Nielsen rushes to the
scene and finds that there is only one witness, Presley.  Presley is
Nielsen's old lover who he hasn't gotten over yet.  Nielsen's only
suspect for the bombing is the spokesman for nuclear energy (Goulet),
who Presley is now seeing.  Presley won't believe Nielsen when he tells
her what his suspicions are because she thinks that he is jealous.</P>
<P>     The following may contain spoilers that might hinder the enjoyment
of watching the film.  If you have not seen the film proceed with
caution.</P>
<P>     Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Frank Drebin, a cop who stays
straight-faced while totally messing up, is great.  Priscilla Presley is
back as Drebin's old lover who has seemed to survive the break up;
unfortunately Frank is not that lucky.  He spends the entire movie
trying to win her back.  The evil man portrayed in the film is totally
evil without caring for those around him; all he is interested in is to
make sure his business succeeds.  The film's portrayal of George Bush is
almost perfect.  Those hand motions of his that he does when he is
talking (first lampooned by Dana Carvey in "Saturday Night Live") have
been added in.  One of the scenes not to miss is the parody of GHOST's
love scene with the pottery wheel.  Put in the hands of Nielsen and
Presley not even that is safe.</P>
<P>     Director David Zucker returns again from his television series
"Police Squad!" and his hit film THE NAKED GUN to direct this film.
Like THE NAKED GUN this film relies on slapstick comedy for it laughs.
For serious people who like subtle humor this would not be a film to
see.  For those of you who have seen THE NAKED GUN and liked it, I
highly suggest seeing this film.  It is written by David Zucker and Pat
Proft, who both wrote for the TV series "Police Squad!"</P>
<P>     Where as this film may not be the blockbuster film of the summer (I
expect Arnold Schwarzenegger's film TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY will
have that ranking), I feel this is worth going to see before it leaves
the theaters.  On a 0 to 5 scale I give this film a 5.</P>
<P>     THE NAKED GUN 2 1/2 is rated PG-13 for adult situations, explicit
language, and adult humor.</P>
