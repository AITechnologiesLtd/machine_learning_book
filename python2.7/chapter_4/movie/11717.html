<PRE>MR. NICE GUY (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>When watching Jackie Chan's previous films I have always said to myself,
"Boy, Jackie would have a big hit if he were to do a film with no plot or
story but action from start to finish.  Why insert these mindless plots?"
Mr. Nice Guy is just the film I was hoping for, but it is also just the
film I was not hoping for.</P>
<P>Plot?  What plot?  In Mr. Nice Guy, Jackie Chan plays a TV celebrity chef,
Jackie.  A news reporter accidentally leaves Jackie with a videotape that
two opposing mob groups want.  The mob groups try to get the tape back from
Jackie.  Enough plot, let's get to the action.</P>
<P>Mr. Nice Guy is filled with action scenes, but most of them don't work for
one reason.  I love Jackie Chan films because of the stark honesty of the
action sequences: no overuse of slow-mo or quick cutting to cover up
stunts.  Unfortunately, in Mr. Nice Guy there is a heavy dose of both and
not only does it take away from the honesty (and thrill) of the stunts, it
gets downright annoying at times.  The slow-mo is used in all the wrong
occasions-do we really need a slow-mo Jackie running down a street yelling
"Miki"?  Do we need the quick cuts and unintelligible shaky-camera
technique during the action sequences?  No.  It's been shown in previous
Jackie Chan films that we don't need these fancy camera tricks-all we need
is Jackie.</P>
<P>Mr. Nice Guy is a less than average Jackie Chan film.  There is less plot
than his previous films and contrary to what I thought, this is actually
detrimental to the film.  Now, I think that Jackie Chan films should have a
little more plot than did Mr. Nice Guy-I also think that there should be a
90 minute film of just the outtake of previous Chan films.  For Mr. Nice
Guy, the end outtakes are the best thing in the film.  As much as I love
very amiable Jackie Chan and his films, I'd have to say, skip Mr. Nice Guy.
 Jackie has done better than this.</P>
