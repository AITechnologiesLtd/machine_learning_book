<P>Twilight is a crime/detective film done in a nouveau 1940's style.  The
cast is superb.  The film is not.  Is the film worth seeing?  Maybe.
Although Twilight misses it's mark by a mile, the actors are all quite
competent.  If you're a fan of any of the principals you may enjoy this
film.  My favorite character actor, M.  Emmet Walsh, has a wonderfully
satiric 45 second part as terminally wounded private eye.  Unfortunately
the principal characters are poorly developed and unbelievable.  It
frequently seems like the actors are just reading their lines.  The
direction is minimalist.  The story is simplistic.  The dialog is
trivial.  Robert Benton, who directed and wrote the script (with Richard
Russo) has done much better in his many previous efforts (Nobody's Fool,
Nadine, Places in the Heart, Kramer vs.  Kramer, etc.).</P>
<P>Twilight suffers in another major area.  The pace is uncharacteristic
for a would be detective drama.  At times I feel like the actors, and
quite possibly the audience, are about to fall asleep.  The classic
1940's crime/detective films were often cheesy, but they were tightly
cut.  L.  A.  Confidential and Pulp Fiction, with their rich additions
to the classic style, attest to the viability of this kind of project in
modern times.  They both have tightly woven complex scripts that are
cleanly executed.  Twilight ambles.  The editing lacks a philosophical
consistency.  The timing of the scenes is irregular.  It's as if the
editor had too much footage for some scenes and used this as padding to
make up for missing footage in other scenes.  The film exceeds the
traditionally requisite 90 minutes by just one minute, but it seems more
like an additional hour.  Don't see this film when you're tired.</P>
<PRE>The Premise (with minor spoilers)</PRE>
<P>Harry (Paul Newman) is a rundown private eye who spent 20 years with the
LAPD before going into business for himself.  His career as a private
detective has been lackluster.  The film opens in Mexico with Harry
rescuing Mel, the 17 year old daughter of Catherine (Susan Sarandon) and
Jack (Gene Hackman).  It seems that Mel is having a youthful tryst with
the not so bright punk, Jeff.  Harry, true to his character, spirits the
girl away but manages to get accidentally shot in the groin area by Mel.</P>
<P>The action jumps forward two years and finds Harry semi-retired and
living with Catherine and Jack.  Catherine is a retired actress and a
bit of a tease.  Harry has the hots for Catherine.  Jack has plenty of
money and a case of cancer.  Harry passes time playing cards with Jack
while keeping an eye on Catherine.  Harry wants Catherine but we're not
sure what Catherine wants.  This arrangement works well until Harry and
Catherine finally make it to the bedroom.  As one would expect, this
behavior is discovered by Jack.  Needless to say Jack is pissed at
Harry, with a "how could you" directed at Catherine.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Harry is doing Jack a favor by delivering an envelope to a
stranger.  Things get bloody as one by one everyone Harry contacts
either beats him up or gets blown away by an unknown assailant.  Harry
keeps getting arrested by Verna (Stockard Channing), his former partner
(in more ways than one) on the LAPD.  Verna keeps letting Harry off
because she feels sympathy for him.  Rumor has it that Harry's private
parts were blown off by the 17 year old Mel in Mexico.</P>
<P>Meanwhile a maguffin develops.  Catherine's former husband went missing
20 years earlier.  It begins to look like maybe he was killed and that
hush money is being paid to someone.  Who did it?  Was it Jack?  Was it
Catherine?  Should Harry investigate and turn in his buddy or lover?
You'll just have to see the film to find out.</P>
