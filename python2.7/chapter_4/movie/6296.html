<PRE>                             RICHARD III (1956)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     As I reported recently, Hollywood is on a Shakespeare tear.  The
studios just released three Shakespearean films and have more about to
be unveiled.  To compliment this, my all time favorite art house
theater chain, the Camera Cinemas in San Jose, is having a Shakespeare
festival where they are reviving some of the old and not so
Shakespearean movies.</P>
<P>     This week I got to see for the first time the Laurence Olivier
classic RICHARD III from 1956.  This is one of three Shakespearean
films where Olivier was both director and star.  The other two are
HENRY V (1944) and HAMLET (1948).  He got Academy Award nominations for
the acting in all three of them.  In HAMLET he actually won the award
as well as garnered a nomination for best director.</P>
<P>     When I saw the film, the theater was rather full.  The people
ranged from students who hadn't a clue as to why their teacher sent
them to teachers to film buffs.  Since the sign on the door incorrectly
said LOOKING FOR RICHARD, perhaps there were even a few people there
wondering when Al Pacino would show up on screen.</P>
<P>     The audience's reaction was fascinating.  The teenagers saw the
costumes and the exaggerated acting style and laughed frequently at the
film.  To them the movie was a parody.  Otto Heller's old saturated
Technicolor print and Roger K. Furse's Disneyland style sets combined
to look like the WIZARD OF OZ.  Actually, it visually reminded me of
THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T. (1953).  Moreover, Olivier's elaborate
costumes, bad hairdo, and fake nose kept me thinking how much Olivier
looked liked Hans Conried playing Dr. Terwilliker.  Most of the rest of
the audience seemed to have my reaction, an interesting film, but not
quite what I had expected.  It certainly does not possess the
seriousness of his HENRY V.</P>
<P>     The film opens with a hokey score by William Walton.  Like most of
the film, although it seems so dated today, it probably seemed fresh
and stirring in its time.  As the music plays, the audience reads the
story's long background from a gilded scroll that moves by in front of
them.</P>
<P>     The sets have a fairy tale quality, and the whole movie, with the
exception of the ending, has the claustrophobic feeling of a filmed
play.  Today's Shakespearean interpreters, especially Branagh and
Zeffirelli, open up the plays much more when they bring them to the
screen.  In Olivier's days, most of the movies were filmed in the
controlled environments of the studios' sound stages.</P>
<P>     Another difference is in the way Shakespeare's text is adapted.
Most modern screenwriters, most especially Baz Luhrmann with his
screenplay this year for ROMEO AND JULIET, truncate long monologues.
Ian McKellen's RICHARD III (1995), for example, had the famous "Now is
the winter of our discontent made glorious summer" speech abbreviated
and happening in a crowded ballroom.  Alan Dent and Laurence Olivier's
script for this Richard III edit only slightly the long monologues and
have them delivered in sparsely furnished rooms so that the viewer has
few distractions.</P>
<P>     Here I must be honest, as much as I admired Olivier's RICHARD III,
I found McKellen's more involving.  Olivier's film is interesting and
certainly the acting is excellent, but I had trouble getting over how
dated it all seemed.  Don't get me wrong, I do like old movies and
think Olivier's HENRY V is brilliant.</P>
<P>     "Conscience is but a word that cowards use," says Richard before
the big ending battle at Bosworth Field.  It is at this point that the
movie really came alive for me.  I particularly liked Stanley Baker as
the Earl of Richmond, who later became King Henry VII.  He looked like
a cross between a Greek god and Lohengrin.</P>
<P>     When the filming goes outdoors, in Spain, the colors change from
being over saturated to being washed out.  One never knows of course
what the original prints looked like.</P>
<P>     Olivier's RICHARD III is less serious and more colorful than I had
expected, but it is a film well worth seeing.</P>
<P>     I do not feel I can close without listing some of the many members
of the cast.  They include: Claire Bloom as Lady Anne Neville, Alec
Clunes as Lord Hastings, John Gielgud as Duke of Clarence, Cedric
Hardwicke as King Edward IV, Helen Haye as Duchess of York, Laurence
Naismith as Lord Stanley, John Phillips as Duke of Norfolk, Ralph
Richardson as Duke of Buckingham, and Patrick Troughton as James
Tyrell.</P>
<P>     RICHARD III ran 2:19 in the version I saw, but some footage has
been lost over the years.  Originally it ran about 2:40.  The film is
not rated but would get a G today.  There is no sex, nudity, or bad
language.  The little violence is cartoonish, but there is a little
blood.  The film would be fine for a child of any age, but young
children can only appreciate the visuals since the language is way too
obscure for them.  I recommend the film to you and give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
