<P>True Crime is a clock movie. Its hero has less than 24 hours to prove
a death row inmate's innocence, and we are reminded of his deadline
throughout by various shots of clocks that grow more ominous as the
film wears on. The clock movie subgenre has had its ups (High Noon)
and downs (D.O.A.-the Quaid/Ryan version); True Crime is a
mixed bag-its leisurely pace (curiously) works for it. Its lack of a
meaty and seamless plot is what robs the film of urgency. </P>
<P>Eastwood stars as Oakland Tribune scribbler Steven Everett, a
womanizing lout who relocated from New York after a sexual tryst with
the wrong girl (the daughter of his employer). He has inherited a
"human interest sidebar" piece from recently deceased colleague
Michelle (Mary McCormack): to cover the final day in the life of
convicted killer Frank Beachum (Washington). Because his nose tells
him he smells something rotten, Everett pulls a Dick Tracy, and
reinvestigates the case; he turns up evidence that lawyers and judges
overlooked after six years of trials and appeals. (Thankfully his boss
Alan (James Woods) points out the implausibility of such an
occurance.) Few have faith in Everett: not Bob (Leary), a coworker
whose wife is sleeping with Steven; not his own wife or daughter, both
of whom he neglects; and certainly not the people directly involved in
Beachum's case-they believe Everett's accusations are the ramblings of
a man who has tumbled off the wagon. </P>
<P>True Crime solves its great big puzzle-we are treated to (ineffectual)
Rashomon-style flashbacks that eventually spell out what really
happened that fateful day when Beachum supposedly murdered a
convenience store clerk. But a number of questions it raises remain
frustratingly unanswered. Why, for instance, did Michelle leave behind
all her paperwork on her story filed neatly in a box in her home? Was
she expecting to die in a car accident, and for Everett to break into
her place looking for information instead of, say, her desk at the
Tribune office? Why does James Woods' character defend his fierce
loyalty to Everett by stating, "I've worked with him for three and a
half years!"? In newspaper time, this seems like nothing-surely not
long enough for an editor to go out on a limb and risk public
embarrassment. And how is it that a lone ranger properly solves the
Beachum mystery in mere hours, anyway? (Said solution is, alas,
irritatingly simple.) </P>
<P>However, what I really want to know is how Everett scores so many
young chicks! True Crime marks the first time Eastwood looks genuinely
old onscreen. When frail Steve prances around shirtless, it's the
singularly most unsexy moment Clint's ever had on screen. I suspect
True Crime would have been a better vehicle for Jeff Bridges or
Michael Douglas-actors used to seeking redemption onscreen, and whose
physical appeal is still plausible. </P>
<P>What True Crime has going for it is a few brilliant sequences.
Eastwood's game of "speed zoo" with his daughter sums up in two
minutes everything that's wrong with the career-oriented parents of
America, circa 1999-it's also the most rousing bit of action in the
film. Michael McKean as a cheeky prison priest provides some genuinely
uncomfortable moments-and a strategically placed lens flare during his
final scene is the movie's best joke. (The picture's symbolism doesn't
end there: prison signs are written in the same font as the Oakland
Tribune banner; a little girl crayons pictures of "greener pastures";
and so on.) Washington's relationship with his family is as potent
as Penn's in Dead Man Walking (though I couldn't shake the feeling
that True Crime's final scene had been more than inspired by Walking's
wrenching conclusion-even if it was photographed in vintage Eastwood
style, by veteran lenser Jack N. Green). And the performances are
generally terrific-particularly Venora, adding depth to essentially
the same woman she played in Heat. Unfortunately, Leary is robbed of
his profanity, a weapon he wields better than any working comedian
right now. </P>
<P>Eastwood started off the decade so well, with the one-two punch of
Unforgiven and the vastly underrated A Perfect World (a mainstream
film so unformulaic it confused audiences-it's Clint at his most
relaxed as both director and costar). He has a late career desire to
adapt books, but translating bestsellers (such as Absolute Power and
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) for the big screen hampers
his lyricism and jazzy improvisational style. </P>
