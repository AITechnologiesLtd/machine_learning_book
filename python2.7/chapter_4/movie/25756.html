<PRE>BITTERSWEET MOTEL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Aren't home movies wonderful?  </PRE>
<P>You don't have to worry about focus, lighting or subject material; you 
just point your camcorder and shoot.  Editing is basically unnecessary, 
and you can just play the tape wherever you left off last.  After all, 
your only intended audience is your friends, who are already predisposed 
to like it anyway.</P>
<P>So it is with Todd Phillips's BITTERSWEET MOTEL, a documentary about the 
rock group called Phish.  I had never heard of Phish before this movie, 
which may reveal something about my age.  Not having previous interest 
in a subject, however, should be no hindrance.  I had never thought much 
about electric chair construction or about the grunge rock movement, but 
the documentaries about them, Errol Morris's MR. DEATH and Doug Pray's 
HYPE!, were absolutely engrossing.</P>
<P>In contrast, BITTERSWEET MOTEL is so formless that I began to wonder if 
the projectionist might have scrambled the reels.  The documentary is as 
generic as the band it follows.  Their bland music reminds me of the 
sort of things that I hear playing from the ceiling while lying in the 
dentist's chair.  It is relaxing but completely forgettable.</P>
<P>But, just because the band isn't the next Rolling Stones, it does not 
follow that a documentary about them has to be so lifeless.  We clearly 
see that this good-spirited group, described as dorks by some of their 
loyal fans, does enjoy their work.  They pride themselves on their 
improvisational playing, with the result that every concert of theirs is 
different.  </P>
<P>The members of Phish certainly don't take themselves too seriously.  
Their guitarist, Trey Anastasio, remarks after one of their 
self-described best concerts that they were "almost as good as James 
Brown on his worst day."  Earlier Trey explains why he could never be 
the next Jimi Hendrix.   Jimi grew up listening to the blues, whereas 
Trey spent his formative years, hanging out in New Jersey shopping 
malls.  This is about as insightful as this movie ever gets.</P>
<P>In summary, BITTERSWEET MOTEL is for Phish fans only.</P>
<P>BITTERSWEET MOTEL runs what feels like a very long 1:20.  It is not 
rated but would be an R for brief instances of language, drug usage and 
mass nudity.  Absent these brief sections, the movie is pure G.  It 
would be fine for teenagers.</P>
