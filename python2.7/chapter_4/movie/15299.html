<P>I've heard "La Dolce Vita" analyzed every way I think possible by now.
As a deep religious metaphor.  As an acidic satire on the media.  As a
portrait of '60s Roman aristocratic nightlife.  And it's pretty much all
of these things, and not just one of them.  It's episodic structure
easily makes it seem like it can have many meanings, and any one of
these would pretty much work, but while it is episodic in structure,
it's held together by one character, and told through his eyes.  And
it's through his eyes that we get the real reason to watch this film,
and the real reason why I consider it to be one of the greatest films of
all time.</P>
<P>His name is Marcello Rubini, and he's played by the great Marcello
Mastroianni as an extremely cool young man living in Rome and working as
an infamous gossip journalist.  He drives a convertible, wears black
sunglasses, is almost always wearing a suit, and knows everyone in town,
in either a good or bad light.  When we first see him, he's riding in a
helicopter around Rome, following another helicopter that's carrying a
statue of Christ to the Pope.  But instead of following it more, he and
the guys he's with stop for a second to hover around a high-rise
building where a couple of women are sunbathing in an attempt to hit on
them and maybe get their phone numbers.</P>
<P>This is how "La Dolce Vita" starts, a film directed by Federico Fellini
at his own personal directing peak.  Following years of simple but
totally involving neo-realistic films like "La Strada" and "Nights of
Cabiria," he decided to culminate all those old great melodramas into
this film, utilizing all his old themes (like that of the ocean and that
of the dawn after the night), but really to make his first film that was
truly complex.  Though his previous films had been ambiguous to a point,
"La Dolce Vita" is so open that numerous interpretations (many already
mentioned) are possible in the explanation of why this movie was made.
He's also been able to extend his filmmaking abitlites to make a film
that is at turns hilarious, sad, wild, cathartic, and awe-inspiring, all
without ever destroying the depth of the film.</P>
<P>But Fellini was too good a director to limit his films to mere exercises
in themes and satire, and all his films, even his more surreal ones, are
rooted in emotionally involving protagonists.  Marcello, the protagonist
in this film, is a little too old to be at the crossroads of his life,
but he has nevertheless reached a point in his life where he's still
idealistic and is about to make a change that will affect the rest of
his life.  In the first scene, we see him between heaven and earth,
deciding between following the Christ statue or the girls sunbathing,
and throughout the film, Fellini uses similar imagery, of climbing and
rising, of shallowness and being fulfilled, to dramatize Marcello's
deeply personal connundrum.</P>
<P>The film introduces us to "the sweet life" (to what the title
translates) that being the shallow inhabitants of Roman society,
especially after dark.  The streets are teeming with aristocrats,
models, showgirls, second-rate movie stars, homosexuals, nymphomaniacs,
and others, all shown in a light that's neither positive nor negative.
Fellini's approach wisely never judges them for who or what they are,
and the result is they are a seductive group of people.  He paints the
nightlife as the most alluring entitiy in the entire world, worth giving
everything up for just to have a night along with them.  This is why
it's so seductive to Marcello, who throughout most of the movie plays as
a somtimes observer, sometimes partaker.</P>
<P>"La Dolce Vita" unfolds brilliantly.  As we get a portrait of "the sweet
life" of Rome as a group of people who are forever partying, and perhaps
leaving the world doomed to always be in a state of shallow fun, he
makes it also deeply personal.  Marcello's life slowly unfolds before
us, so we learn everything about him.  He's not the greatest person in
the world: he annoys celebrities with gossip stories (one of the
photographers who follows him around is named Paparazzo, the name that
coined the infamous term Paparazzi), he's easily seduced by a social
beauty named Maddalena (Anouk Aimée) and joins her in the basement of a
prostitute's house for some un-seen and assumed sex, and then we
discover that he has a fiance at home (Yvonne Furneaux) who's so hung up
over Marcello and so tired of his actions that she's suicidal.</P>
<P>The film's sequences (about seven of them, with another 7 shorter
sequences between them) build a portrait not only of the world of Rome,
but also of Marcello.  Each sequence opens his life up more to us, and
we see his relationships with people, the way he conducts his job, and
his desires which he somtimes wears on his sleeve.  In the film's best
sequence, a hot American movie star named Sylvia (the tres buxom Anita
Ekberg) arrives in town for a movie shoot and interviews, and Marcello
makes it his duty to meet her and potentially sweep her off his feet.
He makes her aquaintance, dances with her, and proclaims that she's the
supreme female of the species.  He then follows her as she runs away
from her crowd of followers and film personelle, chases her through the
streets of Rome as she walks around with a cat on her head, and
eventually follows her into the middle of the famous giant fountain that
stands in Rome.  But as close to her as he gets, he never gets close
enough.</P>
<P>In other sequences, he covers a potential sighting of the Virgin Mary by
two lying children, goes to a party at the castle of some rich
nobilities, and in one of the film's most cathartic sequences, hangs
with his father (Annibale Ninichi), taking him to nightclubs and
introducing him to a showgirl who's very interested in him, but
unfortunately he gets sick before anything can really happen.  There are
more, but we get into the groove of what the structure of these chief
sequences are after awhile: an evening of empty but seductive fun
followed by a morning of regrets.  However, each sequence is unique and
fascinating, and everything rolls into one by the end, not only
completing the portrait of Marcello as a tragic figure in cinema as a
result of his own deep insecurities and pursuit of happiness in the
wrong places.</P>
<P>As this is all going on, the film balances two subplots, one dealing
with the aforementioned finace, who obesses over him so much that it's a
shame he didn't get rid of her earlier; and the other dealing with a man
named Steiner (Alain Cuny), a man whom Marcello idolizes as the man who
has everything: a lovely wife, perfect children, a high-rise apartment,
lots of friends - everything Marcello, an almost nomad of the night-life
scene, doesn't have.  But it all turns out to be a web of lies and
deceit, perhaps destroying all idealism Marcello will ever have.</P>
<P>"La Dolce Vita" was released in 1960, and when it hit, it was the
subject of controversy by almost every major group, not just by those
groups concerned with decency in art because of its frank depiction of
sexual situations and the luridness of the Roman crowd (there are
several "orgies," and they're pretty risqué for back then, but really,
Fellini shoots all of them without succumbing to being offensive for
offense sake), but also by the Catholic church for its portrait of
religious symbols in a negative light (while, ironically, other Catholic
priests preached of its goodness - he apparently takes part in all seven
of the seven deadly sins, and ends up sad for it, I suppose is the
religious take).  Nevertheless, "La Dolce Vita" became a huge hit for
the year, the fifth biggest of 1960, grossing what would today be about
80 million dollars, creating trends in fashion, including that of
Marcello's sunglasses and convertible, and made stars out of Mastroianni
and Ekberg, the latter who caused some teenage boys to sneak into the
theatres, just to grab some peaks at her massive breasts, which are
almost pouring out of her dress from time to time.</P>
<P>But the real reason "La Dolce Vita" works so well is because it's
unversal.  Fellini didn't limit himself to merely showing Roman culture,
and instead showed every kind of culture that acts this way.  Without
even realizing it, I've easily become sucked into such cultures my
entire life: a world of instant, empty highs, only to wake up in the
morning, having to deal with what I've taken part of the night before.
What I was looking for was happiness, just as Marcello was, and both of
us were looking in the wrong places.  But "La Dolce Vita" isn't merely a
warning film, showing us the consequences of living day-to-day with such
a life style; it transcends all that to become a deep human drama, one
where we are sucked into the world of the protagonist, and see what we
see by where we are in life.  I saw one thing in this film; someone else
may see something else.</P>
<P>Fellini directs the way he did when he still made his older films - with
a visual flair that is simplistic yet hypnotic.  His camera movements
are incredibly deft, and his handling of sequences, making them each run
about 20 minutes long, filled with not much more than lots of
conversations and the occasional event (i.e. a striptease populates the
middle of the final orgy scene), and if that sounds painful (and to
some, it is), you haven't experienced it.  Fellini films easily suck
viewers into their worlds, and most of the time, we just feel like we're
there and are probably have too good a time with these
attractive/unattractive people that we don't even mind that as far as
plot, very little has happened.</P>
<P>Fellini managed to make everything seem fresh but not cheap.  The
characters, for example, are always interesting without being totally
weird, as they are with some of Fellini's other films, and there are
moments that are so cinematic and incredible that it's hard to count
them all on one hand.  Of who's seen it, who can ever forget: the chase
up St. Peter's Dome, the dance scene involving Sylvia and another
overbearing actor friend of hers (featuring a rock dance sequence that
has got to be one of the most involving scenes ever put on celluloid),
the comments by Sylvia's droll and drunk fiance (Lex Barker), the
grandfather of the "Madonna children" asking for a drink from the
paparazi for a snapshot, the talk with the girl at the cafe, Marcello's
distanced talk with his father at dawn, the discussoin scene with
Maddalena at the castle party, the third and devastating scene involving
Steiner, the most unerotic striptease in film history, and that final
scene on the beach which radiates so ambiguously and so beautifully what
the final meaning is.</P>
<P>Yet there's something else about this film that really makes it great.
I can't even describe it.  Maybe it's the free form direction, the
characters, the storyline, or even the music by Nino Rota (which
switches between poppy, jazzy, or saddening, but always fitting the mood
perfectly).  Maybe it's the way that the film has a perpetually fresh
look, like it hasn't aged a bit and in fact, looks ahead of even this
time.  Maybe it's the way Fellini makes quick, non-judgmental, and
brilliant observations on life that come from experience and told in
such a way that they seem just like life.  Or maybe it's all of these
combined with the way that this film shows us that "The Sweet Life"
doesn't really exist, and the pursuit of it will only make us sadder,
though curiously rewarded.  The world this film depicts is not entirely
good for you, and you know it.  But you can't help but want to be a part
of it.</P>
