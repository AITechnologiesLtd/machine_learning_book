<P>  Tim Roth's "The War Zone" implicitly presents one of the
best reasons I can imagine for having a dog instead of
children.  What's more you should bring up the pup in the big
city, not in the sticks.  What is particularly astounding about
this treasure of a movie is that Roth, a superb actor, has not
had previous experience in directing, and the two principal
performers are making their debut as well.  If only
Euripides, Aeschylus and Sophocles were alive today, how
they would enjoy this testament to the strength of their tragic
visions...visions emulated by the great Eugene O'Neill in at
least one of his epic family dramas and to a lesser extent by
Tennessee Williams.  While the movie focuses on a cement
bunker in England's rural Devon area, the story does not take
place on a wide-open battlefield like Steven Spielberg's
monumental "Saving Private Ryan," but in the area in which
all wars really start: the family.</P>
<P>   The movie, which deals with incest in a far more graphic
way than "Spank the Monkey" and with family abuse in a
sparer manner than Gary Oldman's "Nil by Mouth" (which
also featured this movie's Ray Winstone), considers incest so
unspeakable that a good portion of its 98 minutes is taken
with silence.  Nor is incest pushed into the background as in
the wonderful movie by Atom Egoyan, "The Sweet Hereafter,"
in which the family crime comes to the fore only in the
ultimate rebellion by the ambivalent daughter.  The silent
portions are the more telling ones, and Roth takes advantage
of these moments to capture the bleak English countryside,
which is displayed as dark, cloudy, rainy, and altogether
depressing.  There is method to Roth's minimalism.  He
wants the audience to concentrate on the sexual tension
that is omnipresent in the pathetic household headed
by a man called simply Dad (Ray Winsome), his wife (Tilda
Swinton), and their two children, Tom (Freddie Cunliffe) and
Jessie (Lara Belmont).  You can feel the uneasiness as dad
prances about the homey cottage in the buff, while
cinematographer Seamus McGarvey--who generally portrays
the activities at a middle distance--captures a nude mom in
her final stage of pregnancy. </P>
<P>   The real center of Alexander Stuart's screenplay, which is
based on his novel, is the sullen, acne-botched Tom, a 15-
year-old who resents the family's move from London to a
remote area of Devon--where he has not been able to make
new friends.  Tom vaguely suspects that his sister, Jessie, is
having an incestuous relationship with their father--a situation
that should be all but obvious to Mom save for her total
attention to her newborn third child.  Happening upon the
bunker in which the sordid acts take place, he photographs
the two, as the audience is made privy to the father's grunts
and the daughter's cries of pain.  (Roth wants us in the
audience to guess the young woman's motivation in
consenting to this rape, as nothing in her attitude indicates
that she--unlike Atom Egoyan's Risa Walker--is sanctioning
the deed.)</P>
<P>   Except for a surreal car crash near the opening of the film,
there is little broad physical action and even less talk.  A
Hollywood melodrama would have had Jessie and Tom
shouting from the rooftops, but here every emotion is
minimalized, British style.  Tim Roth has learned the lesson
at the very beginning of his directing career that
understatement often conveys more devastating emotion than
bellowing.  The excellent online film critic James Berardinelli
reports that in one screening of this difficult-to-watch movie,
at the Toronto Film Festival, a man left his seat shouting that
he could not take it any more, headed for an exit intending to
pull the fire alarm, and after twenty minutes was calmed
down by Tim Roth himself.  (Should we suspect that this
individual sees himself in the film?)</P>
<P>   Family dysfunction has come a long way since the sickness
was trivialized in the TV sitcom "Married, With Children," and
while "The War Zone" will not likely be a commercial
blockbuster (in New York it is playing exclusively in a single
theater), the picture is not to be missed by film buffs and by a
mature audience with the luck to be near the right theater.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 98 minutes.  (C) 1999
