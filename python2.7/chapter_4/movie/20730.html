<P>You know how sometimes you don't realize how great, or beautiful, a
moment is until it has completely passed you by? You know how we all
strive and push ourselves to live out those moments and becomes
overwhelmed by them? Is personal beauty so unattainable that we can
spend our whole lives just searching for a perfect facade of it?</P>
<P>In the unforgettable "American Beauty", the first film from acclaimed
stage director Sam Mendes, these statements and questions are
presented with such honesty and skill that the concept of filmmaking
is almost reinvented. We are there to witness the downfall of a
seemingly normal American family, and we are there to try to learn
from their mistakes.</P>
<P>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) isn't a bad guy. But as we learn through
his opening narration, he lives in a nice house in a small town, and
within a year he will be dead.  His marriage to real estate agent
Carolyn (Annette Bening) is almost nonexistent, and his rebellious
teenage daughter, Jane, (Thora Birch) hates him. One day, after
resolving to spend more time with Jane, he meets her ambitious, sexpot
best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). As Lester puts it, after seeing her
he felt like he had just awoke from a long coma.</P>
<P>In fact, Lester begins to rebel against his "perfect" suburban
society, and starts to make a lot of changes. He quits his boring job,
threatening to blackmail his boss about a fling with a prostitute, if
he doesn't get a year's worth of pay. He smokes dope with Ricky (Wes
Bentley), a teenager who just moved in next door. And he finally
starts speaking his mind, about everything from his marriage to his
masturbation to his lust for his daughter's best friend.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Carolyn is doing some rebellion of her own. An obsessive
workaholic, she starts sleeping with her competition (Peter
Gallagher), the king of real estate.  She, however, lets her urge to
"not be a victim" take control of her (and eventually her husband's)
life.</P>
<P>But it is Ricky, the aforementioned boy next door, who takes control
of the film. He is a drug dealer who carries his videocamera with him
wherever he goes. When he moves onto the block, he films the Burnham's
darkest secrets, and is fascinated by them. Meanwhile, Jane takes a
liking to him. His abusive father (Chris Cooper), a General in the
Marines, once locked him up in a mental hospital because of his dope
habit, and doesn't know what is son is up to.</P>
<P>Ricky likes Jane because she isn't ordinary. He tries to show her that
the world is full of beauty that we tend to turn away from. Angela,
Jane's friend, wants to be a model because she believes that she is
beautiful, but Jane realizes what the audience has known all
along. She is a seductive bitch. As "American Beauty" builds up to its
final climax, we realize just how well drawn each character is.</P>
<P>"American Beauty" so completely blew me away, that it's hard to
coherently put into words just what the film is like. It is a flawless
black comedy in which you are afraid to laugh. The film explores
themes that have been studied in "Blue Velvet", "The Ice Storm" and
"Pleasantville", but first time director Sam Mendes and first time
writer Alan Ball are trying to show us something we may have seen, but
never really opened our eyes to.</P>
<P>The hardest part of dissecting "American Beauty" is picking out the
best performance. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening have never been
better, while Thora Birch and Mena Suvari are incredible as the most
fully realized teenage characters in years. Chris Cooper is amazing in
yet another choice role for one of America's finest character actors,
but even he is not the best. Wes Bentley, whose only previous role was
a line or two in "Beloved", is captivating and mesmerizing. He brings
such life and knowledge to his role that a Best Supporting Actor Oscar
nod should not be far off.</P>
<P>"American Beauty", distributed by DreamWorks SKG, is far and away the
best film of the year, and definitely one of the finest films of the
decade. After seeing this film (and you must do so as soon as
possible) you may wonder how two first time filmmakers could handle
such a project. Well, I think that like Lester Burnham, these two were
free to realize their own respective creative visions, rather than
worrying if the film would be better than their last.</P>
<P>"American Beauty" is a film about lust, dysfunction, voyeurism and
murder.  However, the title is all the more pertinent every time I
think about it. I've been waiting a long time for a film like this to
totally sweep me away. Not a frame of film is wasted in this
triumphant classic; a film you must see to truly believe.</P>
