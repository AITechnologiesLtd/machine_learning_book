Urban Legend (Reviewed on Sept. 30/98)</PRE>
<P>Starring Jared Leto, Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Joshua Jackson, Robert
Englund</P>
<P>"Urban Legend" is the latest film in the newly created genre, the "teen
horror/suspense movie", following "Scream", "Disturbing Behaviour", and
"I Know What You Did Last Summer".  I don't think the word "horror" should
even be used to describe these films, though.  To call them horror movies
would imply that they are scary.  They most decidedly are not.  The
contain elements that make the viewer "jump", yes, but they do not contain
any images that linger with the viewer for days afterwards, as a truly
scary movie will do.</P>
<P>The setup for "Urban Legend" is a rather intriguing one.  Some lunatic is
offing students at an American university in the style of famous urban
legends.  These are stories we've all heard, but have likely never
actually happened to a real person.  A premise like that would appear to
be foolproof, but the director, Jamie Blanks, has disproven that theory. 
He creates absolutely no sense of atmosphere, and nothing in this movie
gave me chills.  Sure it's competently directed, but imagine what a
director like David Fincher could have done with a script like this.  </P>
<P>As for the performances, there's nothing too special here.  Jared Leto has
the presence of a dead chicken.  Joshua Jackson steals all the scenes he is
in, but he vacates the picture after the first 20 minutes.  Alicia Witt
never convinced me she was actually scared, even when she was being chased
by a psycho with an axe.  And finally, Robert Englund, "Freddy" himself,
has a small part as a professor that teaches a class on (what a surprise!)
urban legends.  He's good, but is not given much to do.</P>
<P>I will say this for the movie, though.  When the killer was finally
revealed, it was someone I had not even considered as a suspect.  That's
not entirely true, however.  During the 100 minute running time of the
film, anyone who is more than an extra is made to be a suspect.  I guess I
did like that aspect of the movie; the fact that I was constantly
guessing. </P>
<P>"Urban Legend" isn't all bad, really.  It's just not scary, and that
offends me since it's being marketed as a horror film.  But it is
entertaining all the way through, and it kept me guessing, so I'll
recommend it if a better movie is sold out.</P>
