<P>   When I went to college back in the Jurassic Age our idea of fun
during freshman year was to call all the people in the local phone
book named Frank James and to say, "Hello, Frank?  This is
Jesse.  We ride tonight!"  Little did we know--after all we were not
even sophomoric then--that they must have heard this line a
hundred times, but then, this took the edge off the midterms and
that's what counted.  We weren't the only ones who had fun with
the James brothers.  Others have had the same idea and they
made money to boot, and what's more they gave lots of other
people enjoyment as well.  In fact given the status of Jesse James
in American mythology it's a wonder that (to my knowledge) no
one has tackled the subject since Walter Hill knocked out "The
Long Riders" twenty-one years ago with Keith and Robert
Carradine as the Younger brothers, Stacy and James Keach as
the James brothers, Randy and Dennis Quaid as the Miller boys
and Nicholas and Christopher Guest as the Ford brothers.  Quite
an idea, a quartet of real-life bros to play the legendary hero-
villains in that stylized and extremely bloody film, a mighty tough act
for Les Mayfield to follow.  Given that Mr. Mayfield's last film
was "Blue Streak" with Martin Lawrence, and that before that he
was at the helm of "Flubber" and "Encino Man," you'd be right to
assume that his "American Outlaws" would be both less bloody and more
humorous than the Hill take on the famous bandits.</P>
<P>   "American Outlaws" features a jokey Jesse played by the
charismatic Colin Farrell ("Tigerland"), who bears a striking
resemblance to a young Treat Williams.  Farrell does many of his own
stunts and is the subject of both premeditated and unintentional
humor.  Jesse teams up with his own brother Frank (Gabriel Macht)
and also with Cole Younger (Scott Caan) and Cole's brother Bob
(Will McCormack plus Comanche Tom played by Nathaniel
Arcand), and they hit the ground running before the credits begin to
roll as Mayfield takes us to the final days of the American Civil War
in 1865.  Though the James-Younger gang appears to have
mowed down more Yankees than Rambo 86'd Asians, the South
surrenders, Missouri is occupied by Northern troops, and the
Jameses are welcomed home by their Bible-thumping mama
(Kathy Bates).  To add to the troubles of the local farmers in the
Missouri town (actually filmed by Russell Boyd on a six-acre-long,
newly-built set near Austin, Texas), Eastern railroad tycoon
Thaddeus Rains (Harris Yulin) has the backing of the U.S.
government to buy up farms across far more land than is really
needed, displacing farmers who have spent their lives on the land. 
The James-Younger gang becomes a small army of resistance, a
guerrilla group if you will, hitting the railroad imperialists where it
hurts--in their wallets.  They rob the banks where the Rains
payrolls are kept, hit the railroad supply lines, and rip up tracks,
frustrating Allan Pinkerton (Timothy Dalton), who has been hired
by Rains to head a small army to protect the interests of the
corporation.</P>
<P>   "American Outlaws" succeeds despite its rehashing of the
James legend because it avoids reinventing the wheel.  Rather
than going over the same material dug up by Walter Hill in the
1980 film, Mayfield keeps the picture's tone good-humored.  You
can virtually see the boyishly handsome Colin Farrell and the GQ-
cover model Scott Caan winking at the audience, while even the
villainous Timothy Dalton, decked out in a pin-striped suit, thick
black beard and ten-gallon hat in the 110-degree heat appears to
take his regular setbacks with a fine spirit.  There's plenty of
action--though not much from Ali Larter, who as Jesse's gal Zee
Mimms flirts outrageously with the outlaw until she finally ropes
him in--as farmhouses and banks take turns in being dynamited
and Jesse twists and turns to avoid Gatling guns and six-shooters
alike.  This is a fun western for people who don't particularly dig
westerns.</P>
