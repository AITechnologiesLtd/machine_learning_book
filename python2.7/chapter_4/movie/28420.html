<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This moody minimalist told piece is seen through the lush eyes of the
camera rather than told as a narrative. It is about repressed desires
and a love affair that never really happens. It is set in a crowded
building in Hong Kong in 1962. The film centers on two young couples who
rent adjacent rooms in the cramped tenement. They also share the
embarrassment of being married to adulterous spouses who are not seen,
but their voices can be heard offscreen. Their spouses travel on
business quite frequently and the two are left alone to dwell in their
loneliness, as they cross paths in the halls of their building and
quietly yearn for the other without one of them making the first move.</P>
<P>Chow (Leung) is the handsome and reserved newspaper journalist, who
rented the apartment from Mrs. Koo; Li-zhen (Cheung) is the extremely
attractive, polite, and well-dressed chief executive secretary in a
shipping firm, who rented a room from Mrs. Suen. They realize they are
the victims in this marriage but can't act out their repressed feelings,
they are too worried about what others might say and do not want to be
thought of like their spouses. Nevertheless, they come to enjoy each
other's company. They seem satisfied to eat out together, almost touch
each other, and to just sit together while talking. They wish to avoid
gossip in this city where privacy is hardly possible, so they keep their
meetings a secret.</P>
<P>Chow begins to suspect that his wife is unfaithful when he stops in
unannounced at her office to discover that she is not there. Ping, a
colleague, tells him that he saw his wife with another man. Then he
notices that Li-zhen's handbag is identical to his wife's, while
Li-zhen discovers that Chow is wearing a tie that she gave her husband.</P>
<P>The couple become close but can't have an affair, there is something
that can't be put into words that is stopping them. The film goes back
and forth between both their workplaces and their apartment dwelling. It
shows how well-thought of they both are in their environments, which
means so much to them. Ms. Cheung wears a new elegant dress every time
they meet, dresses with tailored shoulder pads and long covered
necklines. Mr. Leung smartly wears a charcoal silk suit with a different
chic tie each time. The film is a visual fashion show of beauty and
taste. Every shot is stylishly accomplished in a ritualised way. Nat
"King" Cole sings a host of soft ballads that reflect the film's steamy
mood, while the couple often get caught walking in a rainstorm, or
riding in a cab together, or nearly touching hands, or brushing past
each other on the stairs, or expressing through their facial gestures
their feelings of love. They even rehearse what she will ask her wayward
husband when she confronts him: she asks Chow, who is playing the part
of her husband. "Do you have a mistress?" Even in this play-acting, his
response that he is having an affair hurts so much that she begins to
sob. But before we realize it the couple will part, as Chow can't stand
the anguish anymore and volunteers to transfer to his newspaper's
Singapore office. She can't get up enough nerve to leave her husband and
go with him. It then becomes a question of whose fault it is that they
can't get together when they are both so polite and passive, as it is
implied they are both responsible for their inability to come together.
Yet the film suddenly ends by the subtitle writing stating: "That era
has passed. Nothing that belongs to it exists anymore."</P>
<P>Wong Kar-wai (Days of Being Wild/Chungking Express/Fallen Angels) has
created a film about sexual frustration that leaves you hanging on every
gesture for a resolution, but this very delicate romance ends without a
fulfilling resolution. The coy lovers never manage to act out their
desire to sleep with each other, instead their burning love for each
other becomes ennobled into an ideal love. It is a film that is hard to
put out of your mind; and, a lot of the credit for that should go to the
two big stars of Hong Kong cinema, Leung and Cheung, who are simply
mesmerizing.</P>
