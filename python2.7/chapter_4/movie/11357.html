Deep Rising (1998)
3.5 out of 5 stars</PRE>
<P>Imagine "Alien" invading "Titanic" . . . If you think this
might be a fun or interesting combination, "Deep
Rising" will be just your type of film. While it offers
nothing new plotwise, the visual effects are truly
stunning, and the action is nonstop.</P>
<P>There is really nothing to the story of "Deep Rising"
that hasn't been told before. Just like in "Alien," some
people are stuck in a remote location with a seemingly
invincible monster that's picking them off one by one.
As for comparing it to "Titanic," the only similarity is
that the events occur on a really big cruise-ship.</P>
<P>The story begins as the newest and most
state-of-the-art cruise ship sets sail on the South China
Sea. When a traitor from among the crew shuts off all
power, the ship loses its communication systems and
starts floating helplessly on the South China Sea.
Unfortunately for the passengers, the ship stalls right
above the location that is home to a bored sea monster
that needs a new toy.</P>
<P>Shortly after the attack by the sea monster, a band of
gunrunners with the intention of hijacking the ship
arrive on board to find that only three people have
survived the slaughter: the captain (Derrick O'Connor),
the ship's owner (Anthony Heald), and a con woman
named Trillian (Famke Janssen) who was locked up in
the galley because she had tried to rob the vault.</P>
<P>The antagonism between the stereotypical macho
males stranded on the cruise ship is fun to watch; not
only must they all try to survive the monster, but they
must also survive their trigger-happy companions. The
developing love story between tough guy Finnegan
(Treat Williams) and Trillian, the woman who tries to
act as tough as her male counterparts, is perhaps the
most tired part of the film.</P>
<P>Thanks to the spectacular visual effects, "Deep Rising"
rises far above mediocrity. The monster is elaborately
developed and its victims are portrayed in gory detail.</P>
<P>The director wasn't shy about showing the monster in
all its glory, another indication that this film relies on
strong visuals rather than suggestion to frighten its
audience.</P>
<P>In a superb scene, Trillian and Finnigan race a wave
runner through the ship's narrow passages, trying to
escape the clutches of the monster.</P>
<P>While "Deep Rising" relies on a somewhat tired
storyline, the visuals are so exciting that its few
shortcomings did not really matter.</P>
