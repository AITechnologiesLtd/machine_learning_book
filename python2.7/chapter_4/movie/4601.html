<PRE>                               NOBODY'S FOOL
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>NOBODY'S FOOL (1994) *** 1/2 Written & directed by Robert 
Benton from the novel by Richard Russo. Photography, John 
Bailey. Editing, John Bloom. Production design, David Gropman. 
Music, Howard Shore. Produced by Scott Rudin and Arlene 
Donovan. Cast: Paul Newman, Jessica Tandy, Bruce Willis, 
Melanie Griffith, Dylan Walsh, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Josef 
Sommer, Gene Saks, Philip Bosco. A Paramount release. 110 
minutes. Rated R (severely so, for language and flash of 
nudity). </P>
<P>"Nobody's Fool" deals with a group of people in a small, 
upstate New York town called North Bath. The movie is in some 
ways the many-times-removed cousin of "Our Town." Unlike that 
film however, it does not give equal stress to everyone, but 
keeps an emphatic focus on  Donald  ("Sully") Sullivan, who is 
60 but whom 70-year old Paul Newman plays without the least 
stretch.</P>
<P>Ages ago, Sully divorced his wife who still resides in North 
Bath with her second husband. Sully rents a room in the house 
of his grade-school teacher (the late Jessica Tandy in her 
last role) whom everyone calls Miss Beryl although she has a 
middle-aged son, a pinched banker.</P>
<P>Sully is a prole who has never lived a regular working stiff's 
life and probably has bummed around a little in North Bath, 
living from day to day. Now a bum leg keeps him unemployed 
after a fall from a scaffolding of the modest Tip Top 
Construction Company, whose boss Carl Roebuck (Bruce Willis) 
Sully keeps suing in vain.  </P>
<P>"Nobody's Fool" is a rare movie for these days, as it delves 
on characters and relationships rather than action or major 
plot turns. Sully, happy-go-lucky, occasionally hard-drinking, 
always ready with a wisecrack or repartee, is liked by all who 
know him: by the judge (Philip Bosco) who rules against his 
lawsuits and later sends him to jail for assailing a vexatious 
cop; by his ineffectual lawyer (stage director Gene Saks) who 
has an artificial leg; by Miss Beryl; by his friend, handyman 
Rub (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who is his partner-employee in odd 
construction jobs;  by the bar-lady of his regular haunt; by 
the police-chief...</P>
<P>Sully may be perpetually broke, but he is, as the old yet 
valid cliche goes, rich in friends, and quietly willing to 
help others and treat them decently. Behind Sully's surface 
simplicity lies a complex man. </P>
<P>Cleverly, this two-way liking is not goofy, smarmy or 
sentimental, but natural,  subtle and taken for granted within 
an overall warm framework.</P>
<P>Better yet, in one of the script's many originalities, Carl 
and Sully, have been friends forever, and still are, in spite 
of trading disparaging remarks. They even belong to a regular 
group of poker playing that includes the chief of police. All 
the while Sully keeps stealing Carl's snow-blower which Carl 
keeps stealing back--all in good humor.</P>
<P>Carl is a Lothario who openly has affairs with his successive 
blonde secretaries. His wife Toby (Melanie Griffith) faces 
this with tolerant spunk and humor. To top it all, Toby and 
Sully have, quite openly too, a whimsical May-November mutual 
attraction that Carl jokes about.</P>
<P>Events take a new direction when Sully's son Peter (Dylan 
Walsh) appears with wife and boys for a reluctant Thanksgiving 
dinner at his mother's. Peter, an English  professor at the 
University of West Virginia, has professional troubles, 
marital woes, and a major grudge against his father whom he 
practically never saw. </P>
<P>Much of the film from now on will be about the rapprochement 
between Sully and Peter, a connection catalyzed by a wildly 
funny re-theft of the snow-blower by those two (families that 
steal together stay together?) and by Sully's interest in one 
of the boys. This and other small events make Sully finally 
grow  up and discover that he is a father and a grandfather.</P>
<P>The movie's dialogue is splendid, witty and sharp. It fleshes 
out the characters beautifully. These are real people with 
real talk -- not necessarily real-life talk, since, if the 
dialogue were of the authentic, tape-recorded type, its wasted 
words and hesitations would bring yawns to the listeners. But 
it is first-rate movie-real dialogue, a convincing simulacrum 
that walks the wire between the spontaneous and the 
convicingly concocted.  </P>
<P>The acting is impeccable --and colorful -- throughout. 
Watching, in relatively small parts, Melanie Griffith ( not 
everyone's cup of tea) and Bruce Willis (unarmed for a 
change), is a joy, now touching, now amusing, now both. 
Watching Paul Newman (which means the entire movie) is vastly 
entertaining. Without copying himself, and in a 
semi-minimalist way, Newman is still the fellow who, though a 
loser in some respects, is sure of himself, brings to his 
roles a paradoxical touch of class and of purity, and can also 
do crazy things  -- as in "The Hustler," " Cool Hand Luke," 
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," "The Sting" and 
elsewhere.  </P>
<P>All this is in a perfectly realistic setting of a depressed 
town that had known much better times, as witnessed by some 
nice old buildings. Now both interiors and exteriors look 
run-down and grungy. Nothing is prettified, and winter (the 
time is between Thanksgiving and Christmas) makes things even 
worse with dirty snow and lack of cheerful greenery that would 
hide ugliness.</P>
<P>The many qualities of the film range from its basic premises 
to a host of well observed details, from hilarious to moving. 
Like  a child afraid to approach the kindly lawyer who has an 
artificial leg. Like that leg being removed in a session of 
strip-poker. Like the near-total absence of touchy-feely 
scenes. Like the subtle correspondence of making Bruce Willis'  
secretaries akin to the dizzy dames portrayed by Melanie 
Griffith in several movies.</P>
<P>"Nobody's Fool" may fool some people into thinking of it as 
mainly a Paul Newman vehicle. That it is, but it is also a 
movie by Robert Benton, the writer of "Bonnie and Clyde," the 
writer-director of "Bad Company," "Kramer vs. Kramer," "Places 
in the Heart," and others--a man who has a wonderful eye and 
ear for ordinary people. And it is a film that also belongs to 
its technicians and to the great ensemble playing of its cast.  </P>
