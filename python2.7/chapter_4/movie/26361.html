<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Provocative, sad, funny -- "Chuck & Buck" is all these things, in measures
unusual for a feature film, even an arthouse release. Even more unusual is
the fact that the picture manages to be all these things at once, rather
than tackling them in turn. It is a strange movie, moving in strange ways
and telling a strange story. But it is well crafted and its subject matter 
inspires thought -- even if that subject matter is more than a little
uncomfortable.</P>
<P>"Chuck & Buck" tells the story of two childhood best friends who reunite
after years apart. Chuck (Chris Weitz) -- now Charlie -- moved to Los 
Angeles and has become a music producer. Buck (Mike White, who also wrote
the script) stayed home to care for his ailing mother, and never really
grew up. Buck is stuck in a weird kind of mental nexus between childhood
and adulthood: he still wears clothes his mother picked out for him, still
sucks on Tootsie Pops, still plays sing-along records.</P>
<P>Charlie and Buck are reunited at the funeral of Buck's mother. Buck
expects their friendship to pick up right where it left off -- and perhaps
more so, as he makes a half-drunken pass at his old friend. But Charlie
has a fiancee, Carlyn (Beth Colt), and a life totally divorced from
whatever he once shared with Buck, and makes it clear he is not interested
in rekindling the old relationship. Buck follows Charlie and Carlyn back
to Los Angeles where he insistently tries to worm his way into Charlie's
life. Finally, Buck writes and stages a play, "Hank & Frank", in a
desperate attempt to remind Charlie of what they once meant to each other.</P>
<P>Central to the film is the character of Buck, and White is more than up to
the task of portraying such a complex, offbeat individual. White is
clearly intimately familiar with his story, and manages to portray Buck as
a bizarre man-child without making him seem exaggerated or unbelievable.
The tone is set early on when Buck, bored after the funeral, asks Charlie
and Carlyn, "Do you want to see my room?" in exactly the way he would have
done fifteen years earlier. But Buck is not a feebleminded idiot -- he
manages to make the move to LA and even carve out some semblance of a life
for himself, albeit one which still hinges around Chuck.</P>
<P>Buck is made more complete a character through his interactions with two
of the movie's supporting players. One is his play's director, the
supercilious Beverly (Lupe Ontiveros, giving the film's most deliciously
entertaining performance), who understands Buck but does not judge him.
The other is Sam (Paul Weitz), an incompetent actor whom Buck nonetheless
casts in the role of "Hank", his play's Chuck-parallel (in a clever bit of
casting, Paul Weitz is Chris Weitz's brother). Seeing Sam as a substitute
of sorts for Charlie, Buck attempts a relationship with the actor. Like
Charlie, Sam makes it clear that he is not interested; but unlike Charlie,
Sam opens the door for the two to continue a platonic relationship,
providing Buck with mature interaction through which he is able to grow.</P>
<P>Buck, then, develops into a realistic portrayal of a stalker. Eschewing
all the Hollywood stereotypes, he is not a menacing, calculating figure
forever lurking in the background of Charlie's life. Instead, he is a
forlorn man who almost plaintively tries to get his old friend to notice
him. Buck's actions are repulsive and perturbing, but it is difficult not
to feel some glimmer of pity (if not sympathy) for him as well. As is made
clear by the fairy-tale stylings of "Hank & Frank", Buck sees himself as
Charlie's putative saviour, and so while his methods are certainly
suspect, his goals engender at least some measure of respect, no matter
how twisted they might be.</P>
<P>That said, though, Buck is no innocent, no hero, and White does not forget
this. There is an effective scene where Buck, attempting to bond with the
young actor who is to play the youthful "Hank", lets the boy injure
himself with fireworks because Buck himself just doesn't know any
better. (Buck attempts relationships with all the "Chuck"s in the film,
and none of them work out quite as he had hoped.) Buck is undeniably
deranged; what makes "Chuck & Buck" so good is that there is more to the
character than just his mental deficiency. It is unfortunate, though, that
the movie does not delve more deeply into exactly how Buck came to be the
way he is. There are vague references to his parents being "crazy", and
presumably Chuck's departure was a shattering event, but a clear picture
is not painted of how these things came together to make Buck the person
he is today.</P>
<P>Weitz, disappointingly, fails to deliver a comparable performance as
Charlie. To be fair, his is not nearly as meaty a part. But Weitz never
succeeds in connecting with his role, meaning that Charlie seems to float
through the movie without ever quite feeling part of it. This is not just
a consequence of the distance that has developed between the two
characters in the years since Chuck moved away; Weitz never cultivates the
sense that a friendship ever existed at all. Fortunately, he is anchored
in the movie by Colt, who delivers a solid performance in a difficult,
compromising role as Carlyn.</P>
<P>"Chuck & Buck" is filmed in a grainy, low-budget style by director Miguel
Arteta, but this generally does not detract from the film. Only a few
poorly-staged shots belie the movie's humble background. For the most
part, Arteta's visual style only serves to enhance the sensation that such
bizarre, awkward, conflicting events can actually play out in real
life. And, even beyond issues of denied sexuality and the implications of
friendship, that may be "Chuck & Buck"'s most disturbing observation of
all.</P>
