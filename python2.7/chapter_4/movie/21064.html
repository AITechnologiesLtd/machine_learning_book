<P>With a title like I Got the Hook Up, you should immediately be worried.
I mean, when was the last time that a black comedy that didn't feature
at least one Wayans brother was watchable, let alone good?  Sure,
there's always the chance that it could be the next She's Gotta Have It,
Hollywood Shuffle or Fear of a Black Hat, which respectively launched
the…errr…'successful' careers of Spike Lee, Robert Townsend and Rusty
Cundeiff.  These three films, in addition to Christopher Scott Cheron's
upcoming gem Hav Plenty, are certainly rare exceptions in this
specialized genre of 90's film.</P>
<P>Hook Up stars Master P, who is apparently a popular rap star.  This may
or may not be true, but since I don't run with that type of crowd, I'll
just have to believe what I read.  Don't get me wrong – I'm down with
the family – I just don't get why these rap guys can suddenly call
themselves actors.  Actually, now that I think about it, it probably has
something to do with rap being a whole lot of bullshit posturing.  But I
digress…</P>
<P>P, who starred in the direct-to-video sleeper I'm ‘Bout It, joins
stand-up comedian A.J. Johnson (Woo) as the main characters Black and
Blue.  Don't ask me which is which because I have absolutely no frigging
idea.  These two knuckleheads run some sort of junkyard Wal-Mart,
selling everything from broken appliances to stolen stereo equipment.
When they stumble on a vanload of cellular phones, you just know they're
gonna get busy with some phat bankrolls.</P>
<P>Through some type of elaborate scheme with a horny telephone employee
(Gretchen Palmer, Wishmaster), the Black and Blue are able to activate
and sell the phones to all of the neighborhood homiez.  And I say
`elaborate' only because I didn't understand what was happening.  I
consider myself to be fairly bright, but I didn't quite comprehend how
they kept getting the phones delivered to them after they sold the first
shipment.</P>
<P>At one point, P blurts out the memorable line `It can't get no worser
that this' and damn if he ain't right.  There are a few very funny
scenes involving a funeral catfight, a retard drive-by shooting and a
secret stash of dildos and chocolate syrup.  But these moments are very
far and few between.</P>
<P>It's not as bad as Booty Call, and that's the nicest thing that I can
think of saying.</P>
