<PRE>Mrs. Dalloway</PRE>
<PRE>(UK, 1997)</PRE>
<P>"Marriage is a disaster, particularly for women!" announces young Sally
Seton (Lena Heady) to her friend, Clarissa Dalloway (Natascha McElhone),
as they spend the summer lazing around the latter's estate. This is what
Mrs. Dalloway (Vanessa Redgrave) remembers as she goes about her errands
the day of her big party--coming up that evening. Is it such a disaster,
though? That's part of what she considers forty years later, when she
looks back on her life and the people to whom she was close when she had
that conversation. There was her suitor Peter (Alan Cox), and Sally
(another suitor of sorts), and finally, the stuffy, boring, dull Richard
Dalloway (Robert Portal). Despite her exposure to different things and
ideas, Clarissa chooses the safest route possible--the one she can best
imagine herself following. Was it the right one? "I'm not even Clarissa
anymore--I'm Mrs. Dalloway," she realizes. </P>
<P>*Mrs. Dalloway* explores this question while Clarissa goes about her
errands and meets callers and mulls things over in the diegetic time of
one day. Interwoven into this is the story of the shellshocked Septimus
Warren Smith (Rupert Graves), who sees ghosts from the Great War
everywhere, and for whom life is pretty unbearable. He and Clarissa don't
meet, but he plays a big part in her life that day. </P>
<P>*Mrs. Dalloway* is a difficult movie to review. I almost would need to see
it a second time to give it the attention it deserves. The performances
are first rate--especially that of Vanessa Redgrave, who brought more to
Mission: Impossible with a crinkle of her nose than the entire cast every
could. The writing is also good. Thoughtful, yet funny.  Let's face it,
the stuffy mores and rituals of the British upper classes is very amusing
to late 20th Century Americans, and always will be.  Margaret Tyzack, as
the brutal Lady Bruton, is horrifying and hilarious as the aristocrat who
wants all unemployed young men sent to Canada if they cannot find jobs
within a year--and might have it happen, as she has the ear of Members of
Parliament. </P>
<P>"Relationships are just scratches on the surface," is one conclusion
Clarissa eventually makes as she mulls over life, and her life. It's a
shattering statement, but accurate. Despite their hopes and thoughts for
her, Sally and Peter, forty years later, realize that perhaps Clarissa is
happy, even if they don't understand her choices, or even ever knew her at
all. This solitary contemplation of human nature is not for everyone, but
seeing *Mrs. Dalloway* is a worthy endeavour nonetheless. </P>
<P>Directed with sensitivity by Marleen Gorris, Mrs. Dalloway's difficult
stream-of-consciousness is fathomed. The movie is a nice contrast to
Gorris' other big film, *Antonia's Line*, which followed several strong
women making their own choices and eschewing the world of men. </P>
<P>Based on the novel by Virginia Woolf with screenplay by Eileen Atkins.</P>
