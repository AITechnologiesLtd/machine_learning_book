<P>The Wedding Singer surprised me in a way that I really didn't want to
be surprised. It has a level of sweetness to it that I really didn't
expect, and quite frankly going into it, really didn't want either. I
expected more of the angry-type humor that made Happy Gilmore so
funny. But The Wedding Singer does have it's humorous moments, and in
the end, the sweetness of the film did win me over.</P>
<P>Adam Sandler plays the title character, a young man who earns a living
singing at local weddings. The day before his own wedding, his fiancee
(Angela Featherstone) dumps him. He then starts to fall in love with a
waitress (Drew Barrymore) that he met at one of his shows. Trouble is
that she's engaged to be married as well. On top of that, the guy
she's engaged to is a real jerk, but only Sandler seems to know
that. Oh what to do?</P>
<P>The Wedding Singer takes place in 1985, for no real reason except for
some "gimmick" laughs and the chance to release yet another retro 80s
compilation soundtrack. The gimmicks I'm referring to involving
throwing 80s cultural icons at us and expecting us to laugh at them
just because they're from the 80s. See that? It's a Rubix Cube!
Remember those? It's funny! It's a Rubix Cube! That guy dressed like
Michael Jackson! He's funny! Jokes like that are a sign of weak
writing.</P>
<P>I say that The Wedding Singer won me over mainly because of Drew
Barrymore's character. She's just so cute in this movie.  Late in the
film it looks as though things aren't going to work out between
Sandler and Barrymore and I felt bad for them. It didn't matter that I
knew exactly how the story would end up even before the opening
credits started, and it didn't matter that I'd seen scenes like that
countless times before. For a few moments, I felt for these
characters. For a film this weak to be able to do that... well then
there must be something a little special about it. [PG-13]</P>
