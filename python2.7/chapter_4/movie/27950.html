The Wedding Planner  * *1/2 out of * * * *
Starring: Jennifer Lopez, Matthew McConaughey, Bridgette Wilson, Justin 
Chambers, Judy Greer, Alex Rocco.
Directed by: Adam Shankman
Running Time: 102 Minutes
Rated PG-13: sexual humor, language.</PRE>
<P>After 2000's visual feast "The Cell", Jennifer Lopez takes a complete 360 and 
makes a wonderfully flawed romantic comedy, that even with the predictability 
and cliched dialogue still captured me in my seat and kept me entertained 
throughout. Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey have such great formula as 
an onscreen couple, that it is impossible not to like them, if not the movie.</P>
<P>Maria "Mary" Fiore (Jennifer Lopez) is a young wedding planner who has been 
single for a while, and is married to her work. After getting her high heel 
shoe stuck in a sewage drain in the street, she is rescued from a menacing 
trash dumpster on it's way to smoosh her. Her rescuer is non-other than Dr. 
Steven James Edison, a pediatrician whom takes care of the bump on her head. 
Instantly she falls in love with him, and soon to find out...he is the groom 
of the next wedding she has planned, the same wedding that will make her go 
up in her business. Now she must try and figure out how to get through it, 
and how to fall out of love, with the one person that might truly be the one.</P>
<P>A light, fluffy romantic comedy "The Wedding Planner" is not a bad film at 
all. Through the opening credits and through the end credits I was 
entertained and had fun with the film. It does however have a few flaws, 
which come from the predicability and the cliched dialogue (how many times do 
we have to sit through the "How much I love you, but I'll never get you 
speech?). In the end however, you get that warm fuzzy feeling inside, and 
leave with a smile on your face, and your heart warm warmed up.</P>
<P>Adam Shankman, a choreographer of several movies including 2000's "Mission to 
Mars", 1999's "Inspector Gadget" and "She's All That", this is his first 
major motion picture as a director and he does do a good job at making a 
movie. Nothing special goes into a romantic comedy, so nothing special is 
expected and what is Adam Shankman gives it. The cleverly written dialogue by 
Pamela Falk and Michael Ellis is funny and fun to listen to.</P>
<P>For the acting, Jennifer Lopez in the title role is to me, the only person 
really cast for this role. After hitting it big in 1997's "Selena", Jennifer 
Lopez shows she can do any film, comedy, thriller, drama. She is great in the 
title role, and very funny as well. Matthew McConaughey is somewhat miscast 
in the role as Steve her love interest, and acts a bit like he doesn't want 
be in the movie. In too many scenes he is too plain and drained. Bridgette 
Wilson as the groom of the wedding is a beautiful and talented actress, and 
she gives a good performance as well.</P>
<P>"The Wedding Planner" is a nice, subtle romantic comedy that would make a 
great date movie. It's one of those movies you could watch a couple times, 
then leave it on the shelf, then watch it again. Its not even close to being 
a bad movie, but then again its not even close to being an excellent movie 
either.</P>
