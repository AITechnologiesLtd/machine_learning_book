<P>A remake of the 1967 comedy starring Dudley Moore and Racquel Welsh
(growl!!), this movie takes some of the basic elements from the original,
and brings them to age with Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley in the lead.
Haven't we all wished that we could be someone else every now and then?
Well, the lead character in this film gets seven wishes from the devil to
become whoever he wants to be. In return, all he has to do is give her his
soul (surprise, the devil is a woman...hehe). Now that's not asking too
much, is it? I wish...I could be a great movie! Poof.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A dweeby guy with a secret woodie for a co-worker decides to trade his soul
to the devil in return for seven wishes. As time goes by, the man realizes
that the gorgeous physical manifestation of Satan, isn't exactly playing
fair, and tries to improve upon his wishes every time.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
An underwhelming remake featuring yet another great comedic turn by Brendan
Fraser, a perfect sexy hot tamale role for Elizabeth Hurley, but ultimately
too much like a sketch comedy show, rather than a movie. Very little oomph!
The idea of this film is in itself, actually quite ambitious. To allow this
guy to have seven wishes, with him transforming into a Columbian drug lord,
a 7-foot tall basketball player, an ultra-sensitive guy and so forth, but
something seemed to be missing along the way. There were some funny scenes,
some so-so scenes and other tired ones. The whole thing felt sort of pieced
together from a good idea but a not so humorous script. Don't get me wrong,
I laughed here and there, Brendan Fraser was tops as usual in a Murphy-esque
type of role, with him portraying various different characters out of one,
but there were no laugh-out loud scenes and the ending of the film was just
flat. Looking back, it was one of those movies that's sort of "okay" as you
watch it, but entirely forgettable afterwards. It also got predictable
pretty early on, as much of the film's development could be guessed by the
end of the character's first "wish".</P>
<P>I really liked a couple of the situations that Brendan was placed in,
especially the extra-sensitive guy routine, which was really well done and
quite funny, and the whole basketball sequence, which was also very
well-handled, both effects-wise and the humor. Others could have been
funnier such as the Columbian drug lord scenario, which felt more like a
"one-joke" pony. But then there was the luscious Elizabeth Hurley, who kept
me in the game for quite some time. Looking better and better from scene to
scene, featured in various delectable costumes as every boy's fantasy (pant,
pant), Hurley managed to juice all that she could out of her devilish
character. I thought the devil was just a little "too nice" in my opinion,
especially in the end, but then again, the film itself isn't exactly based
in airtight reality. Overall, I would say that it's a safe, easy-going,
fantasy puffball with fun performances from the leads, but definitely less
than what its premise sets it up to be. I was hoping for more.</P>
