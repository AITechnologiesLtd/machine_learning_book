<PRE>The Prince of Egypt</PRE>
<P>Starring The Voices Of: Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes
Directed By Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells.
Running Time: 1 hour 37 minutes</P>
<PRE>A Dreamworks SKG Picture.</PRE>
<P>After the average Mouse Hunt, the silly Small Soldiers and the entertaining
Antz, Dreamworks try again with the children's film market with this
stunning adaptation of the Moses story. As the film warns us at the
beginning, it's not the full story, and some liberties have been taken, but
generally this the Bible story we all know and love, featuring burning
bushes, the plagues and the parting of the red sea. The only thing missing
is Charlton Heston. Instead, we get Val Kilmer voicing Moses, an hebrew who
is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the Queen of Egypt (Helen
Mirren.) We flash forward several years to see Moses and brother Rameses
(Fiennes) all grown up. Moses soon finds out from brother and sister Miriam
and Aaron (Sandra Bullock and Jeff Goldblum) that he isn't really the son of
the Pharaoh Seti (Patrick Stewart) and that it his destiny to free the
Hebrews from the Egyptians tyrannical rule. He soon sets about this, along
with his wife Tzipporah (Michelle Pfeiffer.) Rameses and his two wizard
friends (voiced by Steve Martin and Martin Short) try to stop Moses
completing his task.</P>
<P>While the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults, for children
reared on Aladdin and Hercules, this film could  be the most godawful thing
they've ever seen. Gone is the quick fire humour and standard, easy to
follow plot. But, spectacularly, and to Dreamworks credit, nearly every
child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on
screen. Jeffrey Katzenberg, who produced this film, certainly knows how to
keep a child interested. He's included some songs in the film, plus some
comedy, and a exciting chariot chase, to keep the children interested. And
somehow, himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and
intensity of the story across, without ever being boring. It's a remarkable
achievement.</P>
<P>Also remarkable is the animation, which puts Hercules, an almost 'slap dash'
effort, to shame. Relying on hand drawn and computer animation, the
backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed. The film seems a little
caught up with it's amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and
'moving' shots, but they _do_ look incredible. The final 'plague' where God
kills every first born child, and the parting of the red sea have to be seen
to be believed. Kudos to the animators.</P>
<P>The vocal talent is also very good. Val Kilmer does a fine job as Moses
(although he doesn't sing) and Ralph Fiennes is superb as Rameses (and he
_does_ sing.) Sandra Bullock and Jeff Goldblum are great, and Steve Martin
and Martin Short are very good, but not in the film long enough. Finally,
Michelle Pfeiffer does excellent work as Moses wife. Kudos also goes to the
voice of God, who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued.
Sadly, he is uncredited, and I couldn't quite work out who the voice was.
(But e-mail if you do.)</P>
<P>The songs are good, ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional
big production number. They don't disturb the movie, and while not
particularly memorable, they are nice to listen to (they're well sung
aswell.) The musical score is suitably epic, with some beautiful tunes.
Coupled with the superb visuals, The Prince Of Egypt is a visual and aural
treat, backed up with a great story. Entertaining both for kids and adults,
this film is a must see.</P>
