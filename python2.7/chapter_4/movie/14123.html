<PRE>You Never Can Tell (1951)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 71</PRE>
<P>"You Never Can Tell" is a real sleeper: a comedy
and fantasy that has no business being a very
good film, but is anyway.  The silly premise
belies the quality of the script and direction,
and the cast is likable.</P>
<P>A wealthy patriarch has died, and left his
fortune to his German Shephard, King.  King's
master is Peggy Dow, next in line to inherit
the estate.  Charles Drake is Dow's fiance,
who poisons the dog.  King goes to Animal Heaven,
and petitions the Animal King to return to
earth for vengeance.</P>
<P>King returns as detective Dick Powell, with
sidekick (and former horse) Joyce Holden.
Powell played many private eyes during his
acting career, but this character has to be
his silliest.  Powell often growls, howls,
scratches himself, eats doggie snacks, etc.
His eccentricities and confrontations with
Drake get Powell in trouble with the police.</P>
<P>Most of the humor is subtle, but there is
one sidesplitting scene.  The police bug
Powell's office, and huddle together to
eavesdrop.  Powell and Holden discuss their
former lives as animals, to the astonishment
of the policemen.</P>
<P>Of course, "You Never Can Tell" has some
flaws.  Dow's grandfather (Albert Sharpe) is
too ridiculous a character for even this film.
Drake is competent, but too much of a straight
man.  The certainty of a happy ending robs the
film of any real suspense.  Still, whodathunkit,
this is a minor Hollywood project that is
much better than expected.</P>
<P>1951 would prove to be the final year of
Peggy Dow's film career.  That year, she
married and retired from show business.</P>
