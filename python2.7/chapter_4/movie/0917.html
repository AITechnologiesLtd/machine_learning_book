<PRE>                                    ALICE
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Rod Serling could have done a lot more
     with this story in a lot less time.  A Bloomingdale's sort of
     woman gets magical means to examine her life.  If you think
     that is unbelievable, wait until you see what she decides to
     do with the knowledge!  Good actors in most roles but the
     lead.  One of Woody Allen's worst misfires.  Rating: low 0
     (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Woody Allen's work is getting spotty these days.  It was once true that
an Allen film could be depended on to be worth seeing.  He cannot be faulted
for a CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS and at least HANNAH AND HER SISTERS was a
popular success, but every once in a while one of his films goes really
wrong.  It is hard to imagine Allen thought he could make anything great out
of the material in A MIDSUMMER SEX COMEDY.  It was surprising the film was
at all watchable.  But BROADWAY DANNY ROSE left one feeling more could have
been done with the material.  And that feeling is a lot stronger with ALICE.
This is a film that has an intriguing concept and a terrific cast, yet ends
up as dry and uninteresting as its title.</P>
<P>     The title character is played by Mia Farrow.  Farrow's performances are
an acquired taste, but to the best of my knowledge Woody Allen is the only
one who has ever acquired it.  Alice is the air-headed wife of a very
successful executive when she is given magical means to examine her life,
the lives of her friends, and her relationship with her family.  What she
discovers is that she does not like her husband, for good reason.  She does
like her sister, with whom she has had a difficult relationship.  She sort
of likes a man to whom she has been attracted (played by Joe Mantegna).
Eventually her life comes together in a hokey and stereotyped way.</P>
<P>     And how does she get the means to examine her life?  She has back pain
and goes to a mysterious doctor in Chinatown (played by Keye Luke, who
incidentally died of a stroke on January 12).  Dr. Yang treats her with
opium and magic herbs that give her the power to see ghosts or become
invisible or change her personality.  In spite of the fact that Yang is
benevolent, this is all Fu Manchu stuff, and Allen should be ashamed to
write it into a film.</P>
<P>     There are, of course, a few good lines in the script to remind us that
Allen could be writing good comedy if that was what he wanted to do.  It is
hard to find a good role for Bernadette Peters, but she does have a very
good comic scene in this film.  And a single scene is all that many of the
name actors got in this effort.  Cameo actors include Gwen Verdon, Cybill
Shepherd, Julie Kavner, Patrick O'Neal, and Bob Balaban.  Alec Baldwin has a
small role as a ghost who is usually seen in shadows.  And there are a lot
of shadows in this dark film--dark in color and often in tone.  I rate this
one a disappointing low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
