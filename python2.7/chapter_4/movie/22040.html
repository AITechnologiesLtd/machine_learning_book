<PRE>_The_Legend_of_1900_ (R) *** 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>_The_War_Zone_ *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>_The_Legend_of_1900_ is, by every definition, a beautiful film: it's
lovely to look at--and perhaps even moreso to listen to; and the acting
is exquisite.  Looks may not count for everything when it comes to
movies, but in the case of Giuseppe Tornatore's old-fashioned cinematic
fable, it is more than enough, creating an enchanting, emotional spell
that is hard to resist.</P>
<P>Contrary to what the title may lead one to believe, _The_Legend_of_1900_
is not about one eventful year, but the many eventful years of a man born
in and named for that year (played as an adult by Tim Roth).  Abandoned
by his birth parents as an infant, Nineteen Hundred is discovered and
raised aboard the steam ship _The_Virginian_.  A natural born pianist,
his uncanny skill with the keys earns him a following among the many
travelers who cross the Atlantic aboard the ship, even attracting the
attention of the father of jazz himself, Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence
Williams III).  But Nineteen Hundred never sets foot off of his ship, and
as he sees the world pass him fraction by fraction with each voyage, he
wonders about a life on solid ground.</P>
<P>Tornatore's execution of the already sentimental story is as unabashedly
manipulative as it sounds, and while it's understandable why some critics
have thusly panned the film as being shameless claptrap, the broad
execution fits.  _The_Legend_of_1900_ is not a realistic story, but, as
it is billed, a fable--a tale of larger-than-life characters and
similarly exaggerated emotion.  Ennio Morricone's grandiose score
perfectly complements the atmosphere.  The mechanisms do show a bit too
clearly in the film's finale, which works too hard to get the audience to
cry.  The tear-wringing efforts may not work, but the fact that a
palpable sense of sadness and loss lingers not only over the ending but
the entire film shows how effectively Tornatore created his make-believe
world.</P>
<P>A key factor in giving the fantasy world some grounding in reality are
the actors.  The versatile Roth is enormously sympathetic as the
brilliant but lonely Nineteen Hundred; his tenderness may come as a shock
to those more familar with the scuzzy characters he's known for playing. 
Just as critical to the film's success is the performance of Pruitt
Taylor Vince, who is equally as touching as Max, Nineteen Hundred's
trumpeteer best friend and the film's narrator.</P>
<P>For all the talk of the art behind the medium, film is all about
transporting audiences to another place and time, removing them from
their here-and-now into the world that is presented onscreen. 
_The_Legend_of_1900_ is not a perfect film--one is always acutely aware
of the mechanics behind its manipulation--but for its intents and
purposes, it doesn't have to be.  One leaves the film reflecting on its
beauty and special sense of magic--which is all that counts.</P>
<P>"Beauty" and "magic" are words that wouldn't come close to being used to
describe the directorial debut of _1900_ star Roth, _The_War_Zone_.  The
film is not, as the title suggests, a war film, but emotional brutality
of this grim tale is just as, if not more, disturbing as, say, the
opening 20 minutes of _Saving_Private_Ryan_.  The war zone in question is
the modest four-person household in the countryside of Devon, England. 
The family appears to be nothing out of the ordinary, with the foibles of
a modern unit, particularly one that has moved from the big city (London
in this case) to the remote country.  The father (Ray Winstone) is in the
midst of ironing out business matters; the mother (Tilda Swinton) is due
to give birth to her third child; the 15-year-old son, Tom (Freddie
Cunliffe), misses his friends in London, and passes his spare time with
his elder sister, the also-teenage Jessie (Lara Belmont).</P>
<P>But there's a dark truth bubbling under the surface, one that Tom
stumbles upon one night, setting a course for disaster.  I will not
reveal what that truth is, but needless to say it's wholly
unpleasant--and portrayed in a discomfiting, unflinching manner, for
which Roth must be commended.  He takes a great risk in confronting a
sensitive subject with such brazen matter-of-factness, and the film's
success does not come with the fact that he took the risk, but that he
takes that risk without ever seeming exploitative.  There is no
sugarcoating nor glamorizing of the situation.  He presents it as it
is--raw and painfully real.</P>
<P>As is the case with many directorial projects by actors, the acting is
uniformly solid in _The_War_Zone_; in fact, it's nothing short of
extraordinary.  Standing out among the impressive cast are the two gifted
newcomers, Cunliffe and especially Belmont.  The fact that these two are
unfamiliar faces only heightens the realism, and, in turn, the film's
devastating effect.  A very rough sit, the uncompromising _The_War_Zone_
is by no stretch an enjoyable film, and for that reason, it is one to be
greatly admired.  (_The_War_Zone_ opens December 10)</P>
