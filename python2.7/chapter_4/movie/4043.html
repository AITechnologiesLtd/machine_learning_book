<P>     Frequently, mystery/thrillers present us with a cast of about six
or seven characters, set up a sequence of grizzly murders, then
"surprise" us by revealing which of those six or seven characters is the
guilty party.  It's a time-honored method that's repeated in at least
several movies each year.  At the outset, SEVEN has all the hallmarks of
this kind of motion picture.  Fortunately, it turns out somewhat smarter
and less predictable.  Though not without significant flaws, SEVEN isn't
transparent or moronic, and it doesn't insult the average viewer's
intelligence.</P>
<P>     When all is said and done, the mystery of SEVEN is not who the
killer is--there's never any question about the identity--but how he
will outsmart the police next, and what he will do as a climax to his
killing spree.  It's refreshing to find an intelligent maniac who is not
undone by a moment of sheer stupidity.  From beginning to end, SEVEN's
murderer has the situation under control.  The police are his pawns, not
the other way around.  Shades of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.</P>
<P>     The good guys are a pair of detectives at opposite ends of their
careers.  David Mills (Brad Pitt) is new on the job, full of energy and
high ideals, and ready to "make a difference" by catching the crooks.
William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is in his last week on the job.  His
long years studying crime scenes and following up on clues have left him
weary and jaded.  To him, being a detective isn't about nabbing
criminals--it's about methodically collecting and cataloguing evidence
in case a prosecutor ever needs it.</P>
<P>     The serial killer pursued by Mills and Somerset is choosing each of
his victims based on which of the seven deadly sins (gluttony, greed,
sloth, lust, pride, envy, wrath) they have most clearly violated.  The
deaths form a portion of a decidedly warped sermon..  In their quest to
end this bloody, sadistic spree, the two cops appear well-paired, as
together they make the perfect detective.  Mills is all brawn and little
brain.  Somerset, on the other hand, spends long hours in the library
researching Dante and Chaucer, looking for clues that will enable him to
prevent the next killing.</P>
<P>     One of the problems with SEVEN is that Pitt's Mills is not an
especially likable character.  He's cocky and arrogant, with an inflated
opinion of himself.  Up until the end, he's convinced that his way is
always the best.  Pitt doesn't turn in one of his most impressive
performances here, either.  There's no subtlety whatsoever.  In this
film, the actor has a single mode:  overdrive.  Somerset, on the other
hand, is a subdued and balanced personality perfectly essayed by Morgan
Freeman.  By emoting less than his co-star, Freeman frequently steals
scenes from him.  Gwyneth Paltrow (FLESH AND BONE, JEFFERSON IN PARIS),
one of today's better young actresses, is woefully underused in the role
of Mills' wife, Tracy.</P>
<P>     SEVEN is unnecessarily gory and runs for a little too long, but
neither of these elements detracts much from the film's enjoyability
(unless you have a weak stomach).  The same is true of several logical
flaws--they're there, but not overly apparent while the film is on-
screen (they can be ruminated about after the credits have rolled).
While SEVEN lacks the cleverness of the superior UNUSUAL SUSPECTS, it's
strong enough to hold its own against most other thrillers.  SEVEN may
always be grim, dark, and rainy, but at least there's a little substance
beneath the atmosphere.</P>
