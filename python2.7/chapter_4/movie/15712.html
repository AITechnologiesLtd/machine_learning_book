VARSITY BLUES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>VARSITY BLUES cannot make up its mind what kind of movie it wants to be.
At its core, it contains an honest examination of the pressures placed
on high school athletes by their parents and coaches.  Produced jointly
by MTV Films and Paramount Pictures, the movie completely buries its
dramatic side with a laughless and cliched teenage comedy.</P>
<P>In the one notable piece of acting in the film, a serious Jon Voight
plays Coach Bud Kilmer.  Coach Kilmer has coached his West Canaan, Texas
AAA football team to 2 state championships and 22 district championships
in his 35 years as head coach.  Having played for another high school
football team (Garland) when we won two AAAA state championships in a
row, I can certainly identify with the pressures and rewards of living
in a small, football-obsessed town.</P>
<P>Director Brian Robbins manages to get all of the small-town, football
rituals right, although they may be somewhat dated.  In the gym, the
charged student body listens with enthusiasm as the coach and the star
quarterback brag in advance about their upcoming victory over this
week's rival team.  On the practice field, the coach grabs the players'
facemasks and screams obscenities at them when they don't do precisely
what he demands.  The director gets the quieter moments right as well.
Before the game, the team bows their heads in a sincere rendition of the
Lord's Prayer.</P>
<P>"Football is a way of life," the second-string quarterback, John "Mox"
Moxon, explains in the film's narration to the viewers, who may not
realize that Texas high-school football for many is a cross between a
religious cult and a dictatorship.  "You never question the sanctity of
the coaches," Mox adds later.</P>
<P>Savor the film's few serious moments, and perhaps they can sustain you
through the lame comedy by writers John Gatins and W. Peter Iliff that
so dominates the movie.</P>
<P>With a pretty boy smile but little depth, James Van Der Beek plays Mox.
Mox is a bench warmer until the first-string quarterback, Lance Harbor
(Paul Walker), is sacked and injured.  This incident is caused by the
coach's forcing a dangerously ill, offensive guard to play when he
shouldn't.  When the offensive guard passes out, the defensive guard
crushes Lance.  With its recurring theme about coaches abusing players,
the movie asks some challenging questions, but it quickly reverts back
to bad slapstick before the audience has a chance to ponder the issues.</P>
<P>VARSITY BLUES is the type of movie in which the height of comedy
consists of casting a 400 pound actor, Ron Lester, to play the team's
dumb guard, Billy Bob, and giving the guard a pet pig to ride next to
him in his big pick-up.</P>
<P>A typically unbelievable series of incidents involves the school's sex
education teacher.  She's a bimbo who makes the students chant in unison
the common names for sex organs.  Later, in an all-night boozing session
at a strip bar, the high school football players recognize their
teacher, who is the most attractive stripper there.  Not at all shocked,
she goes to their table to drink with them.</P>
<P>The story's depictions of alcohol abuse have to be its low points.  The
parents and the kids seem to be regular, heavy drinkers.  A drunken
party, in which the team gets wasted, follows every game.  One scene has
Billy Bob puking in the washing machine as a couple has sex on the dryer
next to it.  When the cops show up at the party, no one is arrested.
The cops just admonish the underage drinkers not to drink and drive, a
warning they promptly ignore.  Teens watching this movie will learn many
lessons, and few of them will be good.</P>
<P>The movie has a subtheme of girls, especially cheerleaders, needing the
boys as their only ticket out of town.  And the accepted way shown is
for them to use sex as an enticement to the boys.  The extremely
attractive Darcy (Ali Larter), for example, starts taking her clothes
off for Mox, who is shocked, as soon as he becomes a starter.  She was
once Lance's girl, but an injured Lance doesn't have the earnings
potential she feels she needs.</P>
<P>And finally in its attempt to cover all the stereotypes, the story gives
the team a token African-American player named Brown, who is the star
running back.  The coach, who would probably run over his own mother to
win a game, is such a racist that he tries to keep Brown from scoring
touchdowns.</P>
<P>For all of its faults, the movie does come up with a nice twist in the
obligatory big game finale.  The twist, however, isn't worth waiting
for, so if you feel the urge to walk out sooner, don't resist.</P>
<P>VARSITY BLUES runs 1:40.  It is rated R for sex, nudity, profanity and
alcohol abuse.  The movie might be acceptable for older teenagers, but
watch out for the messages they will be getting.</P>
