<PRE>                         DO THE RIGHT THING (1989)
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>(1989) ***</PRE>
<P>        Spike Lee made an incredible movie here, but it's also one of 
the most uncomfortable viewing experiences I've ever had--and that 
includes the episode of "Golden Girls" where Estelle Getty gets a pap 
smear. DO THE RIGHT THING is a shocking commentary on race 
relations, a movie you can't watch without a strong opinion on one 
side or the other. Luckily, Spike didn't take sides in his presentation of 
the story, even if all the characters are stereotyped. The blacks are 
angry troublemakes who hate people of every other race and use the 
f-word in every sentence. The whites are angry troublemakers who 
hate people of every other race and use the f-word in every sentence. 
The Hispanics... You get the picture, I'm sure.</P>
<P>        Lee assumes that beneath a thin veneer of courtesy, every 
American harbors hate for other races that will break out with the 
slightest provocation. Black characters make fun of the way Orientals 
talk but are made fun of by whites for their addiction to the word 
"motherf---er" and the substitution of the word "fiddy" for its more 
Caucasian counterpart "fifty." The cops in the movie are hateful 
bastards who use unnecessary brutality, taking the Rodney King 
treatment to its worst extreme right in front of the neighborhood 
blacks.</P>
<P>        There are only a few well-thought-out characters in the 
movie, like Danny Aiello, an Italian who owns a pizza parlor that was 
there before the neighborhood was colorized. Now he's one of two 
non-black families in the neighborhood, but unlike the Korean 
convenience store owner across the street, is accepted by everyone. 
Spike Lee, one of the other decent characters, is his delivery boy, who 
manages to remain friends with his people and Aiello's.</P>
<P>        The movie takes awhile to reach its shocking climax. The 
first hour moves at a leisurely pace, focusing on a day in the life of the 
Brooklyn neighborhood, the hottest day of the year in fact. During that 
time we meet the neighborhood's residents--Aiello and his two sons, 
one racist and one non (luckily, the pizza parlor has seating for both 
types), Lee and his siblings, Lee's hyper Hispanic girlfriend (played 
by--take a wild guess--Rosie Perez), the racist black who organizes a 
protest of Aiello's pizza parlor because the people on his "Wall of 
Fame" are exclusively Italian guys, no blacks in the lot, the big guy 
who walks around with a tacky boombox, three old guys who sit 
outside and gossip the day away, another old guy who drinks the day 
away and a retarded guy who bugs Lee by trying to sell them pictures 
of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. (Lee would be so inspired by 
the picture he bought that he would go on to make a really long movie 
about it.)</P>
<P>        Most of the characters are interesting but, for one reason or 
another, seemed abrasive and obnoxious to me. They're the kind of 
people you want to slap some sense into... and considering the movie's 
outcome, they'd take well to violence. If you've seen the movie, you 
realize the irony of the title, because hardly any of the characters ever 
say or do the right thing and are too one-note to sympathize with. The 
only exceptions are Lee, Aiello and the old drunk.</P>
<P>        The climax almost arises out of nowhere. You can tell while 
watching the movie that the racial tension, personified well by the 
depictions of intense heat (although I could have done without the 
scene where Spike rubs an ice cube on Rosie's nipples), would result in 
some manifestation of violence. Still, once it finally happens, you wish 
it didn't. You wish you could sit the characters down and tell them 
they don't have to act like idiots, always saying and doing the wrong 
thing. There's another way to deal with life's problems, through 
intelligence and negotiation. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is doing 
the right thing.<HR></P>
