<P>THE ROAD HOME (Wo de fu qin mu qin)
-----------------------------------</P>
<P>Luo Yusheng (Honglie Sun) is called home from the city by the mayor of his
hometown when his father dies.  The mayor (Guifa Chang, present day)
has a problem honoring his mother's wish to have her husband's casket carried 
back to their rural village, as all the able bodied men have moved into the 
city.  His grief stricken mother (Yuelin Zhao, present day) makes
Yusheng recall her and his father's locally legendary courtship and he
becomes determined to enact the old custom designed to keep his deceased
father from forgetting "The Road Home."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Director Zhang Yimou ("Ju Dou," "Raise the Red Lantern") ends a trilogy of
sorts with "The Road Home," his third based-on-fact tale revolving around a
determined young woman after "The Story of Qui Ju" and "Not One Less."
While the first two films were shot in a grittier style than his previous
work, "The Road Home" is a lush, widescreen film with images recalling
his earlier work "Ju Dou."</P>
<P>Zhao Di (Ziyi Zhang, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," past) is a non-educated
country girl who lives alone with her blind mother (Bin Li).  When a new
schoolteacher arrives, the entire town turns out to see him and Di is
immediately smitten with the young man.  Luo Changyu (Hao Zheng) makes
eye contact with the pigtailed girl in the bright red jacket.</P>
<P>Di goes out of her way to cross Changyu's path, even travelling to the 
farther well behind the schoolhouse for her water (a comical scene shows a 
local foil Changyu's attempt to also get water while Di is at the well).  
Eventually, it's the Zhaos' turn to host dinner for Changyu and he presents 
Di with a barrette to match her jacket.  A dramatic separation is followed
by a
harsher one as Changyu is called back to the city (Mao's reversal on his
educational program), and then again after he defies city officials and
sneaks 
back to see Di.</P>
<P>This moving tale is adapted from his novel "Remembrance" by Bao San.
Very little dialogue is used in the central flashback, where images speak
and non-obtrusive narration fills in the story.  The themes of everlasting
love and home are referred to often in simple, almost offhand ways.  Memory
keeps love alive with the imagined sound of a loved one's voice.</P>
<P>Zhang Ziyi, who went on to international acclaim after "Crouching Tiger," is 
luminous as the young Di - after a look from the handsome Changyu, her face 
brightens even more - this is star wattage.  Zhang Yimou, who first discovered
Gong Li, has an eye for talented and photogenic actresses.</P>
<P>Present day scenes are filmed in a bluish black and white and set in
a snowy winter, while the central flashback is in glorious color.  The
past is dreamlike perfection, somewhat like "The Wizard of
Oz," where home was also the desired end.  The film will also recall
"Witness" as men build a new school while women prepare their lunch
or Majid Majidi's "Children of Heaven," where the beauty of a craftman
at work is celebrated.  Zhang's current heroine chases after the mayor's
vehicle down a dirt road just as his last did in "Not One Less."</P>
<P>Cinematographer Yong Hou ("Not One Less") frames Di in a doorway surrounded 
by bright orange pumpkins as the son recalls his father saying that sight 
of his mother was like a portrait.  His black and white images are also
artful,
as when a funeral procession trudges through the snow on foot, backlit by
the headlights of the cars snaking behind.  Editor Ru Zhai ("Not One Less") 
dissolves shots of Di both coming and going on her daily trek to find a 
lost hairpiece. (That barrette makes one wonder if Zhang will be typecast 
receiving and losing hair ornaments to men!)  The one unfortunate note in
this symphony of filmmaking is Bao San's score, which borders on plagarizing
the theme from "Braveheart."</P>
<P>Yusheng honors his parents at film's end by teaching one class in his father's
old school.  'Know the past, know the present' chant the students.  "The
Road Home" poignantly shows us both through the eyes of a son just coming
to understand his father's lesson.</P>
