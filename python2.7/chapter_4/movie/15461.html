<PRE>Wise Fools and the Boudu Tradition</PRE>
<PRE>Henry Fool (1997)</PRE>
<P>This completely down-and-out variation on Down and Out in Beverly Hills,
which in itself is a variation of Boudu Saved From Drowning, is a more
disastrous time for the people who get involved with the mysterious and
disheveled bum who drifts into their lives. Well, that's not completely
true. One person, Simon Grim (James Urbaniak), does benefit from the
fateful meeting, escalating from neighborhood weirdo to a 15-minute
celebrity whose porno poem delight the local teens in the World of Donuts
in Woodside, Queens, and enrage their parents.</P>
<P>Figuring out who is the less accomplished of the bunch is difficult.
There's Simon, who watches couples make out and gets beat up for it. Henry
Fool rants and raves, encouraging Simon to write while he doesn't seem to
do a whole lot of anything. Simon's sister Fay (Parker Posey) is the local
slut. Their mom mopes around the house in a depression. </P>
<P>Yet there are some moments of inspiration. There are some selfless acts.  
Simon's perverse poetry (which we never ever hear) makes an autistic girl
speak, and helps him lift himself completely from his milieu. And what a
milieu it is. Suicides, child abuse, alcohol abuse, intolerance, and more
bodily fluids and flatulence than you might expect. Or perhaps you would.
About 95% of the movie seems to be filmed on location in Woodside, Queens
(Laura and I looked at the street signs, I assure you).</P>
<P>Written and directed by indie great Hal Hartley, Henry Fool ambles along,
quiet and unpunctuated, a run-on sentence of a film. When your moviegoing
pal says, "I liked it but it was 45 minutes too long," it confirms my
opinion of the pace, but confounds me as to how anyone could enjoy it
fully. There are some truly funny and brilliant moments.</P>
<P>Cinematographer Michael Spiller does things with throwing things out of
focus I have not seen before, making things clear with fuzziness.</P>
<P>Ubiquitous indie actor Kevin Corrigan (the male Parker Posey) appears
as Warren, one of the local outer borough intolerati. </P>
<P>Original music by the director Hal Hartley.</P>
