<P>     In Robert Altman's film industry satire THE PLAYER, an earnest young
screenwriter pitches a death penalty "issue" drama called HABEAS CORPUS,
which he insists should have "no stars" and a downbeat ending, because
"that's reality."  The studio buys the story and turns it into an action
thriller in which Bruce Willis races in at the last moment to save Julia
Roberts from the gas chamber, quipping "Traffic was a bitch" as he carries
her to safety.  Capital punishment had been reduced to a plot device for a
by-the-numbers crowd-pleaser.  In Hollywood, _that's_ reality.</P>
<P>     On the surface, TRUE CRIME appears to be something a bit more
highbrow, but it's still a frustrating gloss over a sensitive subject.
Clint Eastwood directs himself as Steve Everett, an Oakland newspaper
reporter with a shambles of a life -- he's an alcoholic only two months on
the wagon, a married inveterate philanderer, and a gung ho investigative
journalist with a history of gung ho-ing too far.  When his editor (Denis
Leary) hands him a puff-piece human interest assingment on convicted
murderer Frank Beachum's (Isaiah Washington) last day before his
execution, Everett can't help poking around in the facts.  Those facts
suggest to him that a key witness couldn't have seen what he claimed to
see, and that Beachum may be an innocent man.  With the execution set for
midnight, Everett has only twelve hours to save Beachum's life.</P>
<P>     And, we assume, to save his own personal and professional soul in the
process.  TRUE CRIME is naturally more Everett's story than anyone else's,
which might lead you to expect that he's the character who will learn,
grow and change, especially since he has enough character flaws to fill a
week's worth of Jerry Springer episodes.  Instead, Eastwood doesn't even
pretend that Everett's crusade is about anything more than salvaging a
shred of his professional dignity.  He's a self-absorbed, flirtatious
irresponsible cuss in his first scene, and he's a self-absorbed,
flirtatious, irresponsible cuss in his last scene.  The role is
surprisingly flat, leading to a narrative where all that matters is the
plot progression towards Beachum's midnight deadline.</P>
<P>     It's in their dealing with Beachum that Eastwood and his writing team
throw TRUE CRIME into the most confusion.  Beachum's final hours with his
wife and daughter are given a lot of screen time -- perhaps to deflect the
perception that this is yet another movie about a white man finding
salvation through helping anonymous non-white characters -- yet those
scenes serve primarily to tangle the film's themes.  If we're watching
Beachum's torment simply to give Everett's story a face, it's a
trivialization of that suffering.  If we're watching to gain a greater
understanding of the emotional anguish faced by death row inmates, in
effect making TRUE CRIME a death penalty "issue" drama, then Everett's
pursuit of the story is trivial.  And if we're watching to build sympathy
for an innocent man, than a late twist which suggests Beachum might be
guilty is a manipulative cheat.  The film plunges us into one side of the
capital punishment debate when it serves its purpose, then tiptoes around
the edges of the issue at other times to avoid the appearance of making a
controversial statement.</P>
<P>     Ironically, it's only the fact that TRUE CRIME is a slick Hollywood
star project that makes it fairly watchable.  Eastwood once again gathers
wonderful technical support -- cinematographer Jack N. Green, composer
Lennie Niehaus, production designer Henry Bumstead -- to create impressive
atmosphere.  He also draws a slick supporting performance from James
Woods' as Everett's crass editor-in-chief, a role which makes you wonder
whether Woods and Denis Leary accidentally swapped scripts but the result
turned out perfectly.  The buildup to Everett's down-to-the-wire race to
find exonerating evidence will probably work on you in spite of your
resistance, but ultimately it's clear that Eastwood's craftsmanship is
disguising a genuinely weightless story.  TRUE CRIME is true Hollywood, a
disposable entertainment that toys with earnest respectability before
turning into a chase thriller where the traffic is a bitch.</P>
