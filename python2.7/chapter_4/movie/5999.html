<PRE>                             MAXIMUM RISK
                       A film review by Shaggy Bob
                        Copyright 1996 Shaggy Bob</PRE>
<P>There I was, trying to get out of an elevator.  And what happens?  This
woman tries to block my way by trying to get in, before I can get out. 
So, I said "excuse me", hopin' this pushy woman will at least let me get
out of the elevator.  Well, she side stepped and bumped me by the door
just so that she can get in.  Of course, the elevator ain't gonna go
anywhere until I get out.  Does this behavior make sense to anybody?  And
why is this not an isolated incidence?</P>
<P>Speaking of things not making any sense, MAXIMUM RISK came out and I had
to go check it out.  It's another one of Jean Claude's movies where he
kicks few butts but he's trying to put more acting in it.  I hate to say
it but he's not going to win any Oscar any time soon.  And yes, there was
actually something that resembles a plot but you had to look hard for it
after Jean Claude's twin gets killed in first 5 min of the movie.</P>
<P>One nakkid boob (yeah Natasha!).  4 Doz bullets.  2 doz dead bodies.  48 on
the vomit meter.  One moon shot (sorry, not Jean Claude).  What we got here
are:  Running-fu, jumping for life-fu, attack of killer car chase-fu,
mysterious dead body that flipped over-fu, funeral-fu, trip to the
lawyer's office from hell-fu, homeboy in the hood-fu, free drink-fu,
key from heaven-fu, attack of garbage can lid-fu, and of course attack of
killer cabbie-fu.  Video hall of fame nominations to Natasha Henstridge
for saying stuff like "you got harder since the last time" and to Jean
Claude Van Damm for saying stuff like "why didn't you tell me".  Two
stars.  Shaggy Bob says wicked!</P>
<P>Spoilers - Jean Claude's character's twin is getting chased by two guys
and well, he dies.  Enter Jean Claude.  Now, he didn't know that he had a
twin brother.  So, he wants to find out what kind of person his dead
brother was.  Of course the FBI and the Russian mob are mixed in the whole
mess.  Oh yeah, you can't forget about Natasha who acts like a guide
through the movie so the audience won't get lost.  No one is going to win
any awards for acting but some of the fight scenes were pretty cool.
If you're waiting for a call from Elizabeth Anne Holden, then stay by the
phone.  If she actually gives you call and wants to go out with you, don't
take her to this one.  If she asks for an action movie to get some release
but not too much brain dead beatings, then consider this one.  But only then.</P>
<P>Alien Alert!  I don't get it.  A part of a freeway was torn down and
effectively increased the traffic.  Of course, this particular stretch of
the freeway was the only link between northern and southern part of the
city during major event like a marathon.  Now, more freeway got torn down
and because there hasn't been any major gridlock, it's considered a
success and therefore, the freeway does not need to be replaced?  Hello? 
Is anybody with any synaptic activities in the city hall?  I used to be
able to get out of town in 8 min.  After the first demolition, I was able
to get out of town in 15min.  Now, it takes me 20 min just to get to the
freeway.  And that's success?  Hello?</P>
<P>For wisdom according to Shaggy Bob, hit that reply key now.</P>
