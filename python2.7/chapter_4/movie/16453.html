<PRE>MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE</PRE>
<P> Reviewed by Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Warner Bros./Bel-Air Entertainment
 Director:  Luis Mandoki
 Writer:  Gerald Di Pego, novel by Nicholas Sparks
 Cast: Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, John Savage,
Illeana Douglas, Robbie Coltraine, Paul Newman</P>
<P>   Kevin Costner is one of Hollywood's most bankable stars
because he's so congenial.  His flat voice and bland accent
proved apropos in his first starring role as the upright Eliot
Ness in "The Untouchables" and he was as fine a performer
as he ever was in "Bull Durham" and "Field of Dreams." 
Lately, though, he has been defeated by strange scripts that
ranged from the thoroughly embarrassing Mad Max spinoff
"Waterworld" and the movie that people are still trying to
figure out (camp? new spirit of patriotism?), "The Postman." 
Doubtless he was picked for the male lead in "Message in a
Bottle" because he can capture the soul of the ordinary
American, plying his craft with his hands in a picturesque little
fishing village on the Carolina coast.  But "Message in a
Bottle," which features travelogue-perfect photography and
highlights one of Hollywood's most enchanting actresses
(Robin Wright Penn)--as well as the legendary Paul Newman
in the role of a crusty ol' dad full of tough love for his
disoriented son--is utterly banal, an old-fashioned weepie
romance that may call up nary a solitary piece of Kleenex
from the middle-aged audience it hopes to attract.</P>
<P>   "Message in a Bottle" brings to mind the typical error that
tourists make while on vacation, the miscalculation that
makes the happy wayfarer say, "I could live here."  In fact,
spending just one extra week in a distant paradise would
likely yield a condition of homesickness.  The picture features
two people who are at vulnerable stages in their lives, who
could easily find a glowing, romantic attachment, and who
might believe that they could make a go of their lives
together.  In fact, Garret (Kevin Costner) and Theresa (Robin
Wright) are so different in temperament and background that
had they decided to get together for a more permanent union
they would run out of things to say in a month.  Sure, the
chemistry is there, though they do not exactly sizzle together.
Still, the audience might feel it got its money's worth simply
by gazing at the frequent closeups of the handsome couple
who are lonely enough to be an easy target for Cupid's
arrows.  But Nicholas Sparks, who wrote the novel on which
the movie is based, and Gerald Di Pego, who adapted it for
his screenplay, fall back on one of the seasoned incitements
to love: a woman's penchant for a man's lines of poetry.</P>
<P>   The poetry is found in a message in a bottle which Theresa
discovers washed up on a beach.  Opening the rolled-up
stationery, she determines that it was written by a man who
is stricken with heartache at the premature death of his wife,
Catherine, and who feels so guilty at his helplessness that he
introduces virtually every line with the words "I'm sorry."
Since Theresa works as a researcher for the Chicago
Tribune, she takes the note to her editor, Charlie (Robbie
Coltrane), who decides to publish it under his byline and to
research the age and source of the note via the stationery,
the typewriter, and the sort of bottle used to convey it.  When
readers respond, Charlie sends Theresa to the Carolina
shore to meet its author for a possible feature on this newly-
found minstrel.  Theresa discovers the man, Garret Blake,
falls in love by their second day together, and becomes
enamored with the essence of this fishing village that seems
to have sprouted out of the 19th century.  Like all romantic
melodramas, the lovers must be kept apart until the end. 
The distance they put between them is not geographical but
psychological: Garret cannot put his devotion to his deceased
wife to rest.</P>
<P>   Luis Mandoki does a creditable job of directing the
photogenic couple against the backdrop of a fishing town
unspoiled by tourism and captures the crustiness of Paul
Newman as the unhappy Garret's father--a man who takes
pride in cutting back to "no more than two beers a day" and
who is eager to get his son to rejoin the human race.  A
contrived conflict sees Garret at war with his former brother-
in-law and his wife's mother, both of whom blame the poor
guy for "allowing" their Catherine to die and who insist that
Garret return the paintings which were executed by the young
woman.  But the movie, which shows the seasoned beauty of
Ms. Penn as well as any other she has done is mired in
overdone exchanges of the lovers and between father and
son; a sham contention among neighbors; and a vapid
resolution devised to prevent these two essentially
incompatible souls from establishing a more permanent
footing.</P>
