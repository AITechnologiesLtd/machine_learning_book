LOST IN AMERICA
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1985) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        LOST IN AMERICA is commonly considered to be Albert 
Brooks' crowning triumph, but I place it third, behind DEFENDING 
YOUR LIFE and MOTHER. I've seen it twice and still don't consider 
it the four-star masterpiece Roger Ebert made it out to be. What it 
does have is the trademark Brooks meld of intellectual humor, 
cultural satire and mid-life angst. I have a feeling that, if this guy 
ever does figure out how to be happy in life, we'll be out some good 
movies.</P>
<P>        Brooks plays a lower-upper class yuppie who seems to have 
it all. He's got a successful job in advertising and is in line for a 
promotion, he's about to move into a million-dollar house, has put a 
down payment on a Mercedes and he's married to Julie Hagerty, the 
AIRPLANE! chick, and she's successful in her career. So, of course, 
neither of them are happy. Their lives are boring, predictable, 
mundane. They never found themselves as young adults.</P>
<P>        These doubts about their role in corporate America come to 
the surface when Brooks is passed over for the promotion he was 
counting on. The company is transferring Brooks instead, and he 
blows up at the boss in one of the movie's best scenes. He gets fired 
and finally adopts a screw-it attitude toward responsibility. His line 
of thought is forget the new house, forget the new car and forget 
work. He and Hagerty have a nest egg of a couple hundred thousand 
saved up, and decide to invest in a Winnebago.</P>
<P>        It's time to throw away convention and live from day to 
day, meandering across the country going wherever their hearts take 
them, "like in EASY RIDER." In a comedy, of course, things never 
turn out like they're supposed to, so the journey soon becomes a 
disaster when they stay at a Las Vegas hotel to renew their vows and 
Hagerty gambles away the nest egg while Brooks sleeps.</P>
<P>        LOST IN AMERICA, with its EASY RIDER Winnebago 
premise, would appear to be a wacky travelogue movie. But no, it's 
not ALBERT BROOKS' VACATION. After the loss of the nest egg, 
things get sidetracked pretty quick. It's refreshing to see a movie 
where the protagonists don't get their money back at the end and 
don't get what they want. If there's any complaint about LOST IN AMERICA, it's that Brooks allows us too little satisfaction. In 
MOTHER and DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, Brooks compromises his 
acid wit to please the audience, but not here. The happy ending just 
kind of got lost... yes, in America.</P>
