"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Remember the Shaft remake from earlier this year?  The 1971 original was
updated and 58-year-old Richard Roundtree, the star of the first film,
was given a smaller role in the second to make way for a newer, hipper
lead.</P>
<P>But Shaft isn't the only remake from '71 to rear its head in 2000.  Get
Carter was originally a British flick based on Ted Lewis' novel `Jack's
Return Home' that starred recent Oscar winner Michael Caine (it also
became a 1972 blaxploitation movie called Hit Man with Bernie Casey and
Pam Grier).  Caine (The Cider House Rules) has a smaller role in the new
version, but he isn't making way for a newer, hipper lead.  In fact,
Carter's new lead, Sylvester Stallone, is only four years younger than
Roundtree.</P>
<P>The new adaptation updates the cheesy ‘70s music, clothes and hair,
while the story remains somewhat the same.  Vegas heavy Jack Carter
(Stallone, Cop Land) learns that his estranged brother has been killed
in Seattle and heads off to his old stomping ground to find out if the
accident was really caused by drunk driving or by more devious means.
For some reason, he suspects foul play and, like Terence Stamp in The
Limey, he's right.</P>
<P>When Carter gets to Seattle, he heads straight for his brother's
funeral, where he meets his sister-in-law Gloria (Miranda Richardson,
Sleepy Hollow) and niece Doreen (Rachael Leigh Cook, She's All That). He
begins to pester them with questions about the accident, but they see
his queries as an annoyance.  Doreen even tells Carter, `You're just a
picture on the piano,' despite the fact we see no pictures on the piano
in a later scene.  Probably just a figure of speech.</P>
<P>Once Carter hits the streets to investigate his brother's lifestyle and
death, we're introduced to a jumble of characters from which we must
figure out the pecking order of Seattle's crime food chain as he pummels
his way to the top.  You're supposed to be surprised by the kingpin, but
it's really quite predictable.  In that respect, Carter is kind of like
Mel Gibson's Payback.</P>
<P>The original version of Carter was much, much better and is widely
regarded as one of the finest British crime pics ever made.  It was
directed by Mike Hodges, who went on to make Flash Gordon and, more
impressively, the recent sleeper hit Croupier.  There are two fantastic
scenes in the first film that I was surprised to see omitted from the
remake.  One involved a steamy phone sex call between Carter and the
girlfriend of his mob boss back home.  It must have been pretty risqué
20 years ago, but by today's standards, it would be quite tame.</P>
<P>The other scene involved two thugs walking in on Carter while he was
shagging some bird.  He was able to turn the tables on the situation,
leading the men down the stairs and out of the house with a shotgun
while completely naked.  And, of course, the ending of the new film is
completely different.  Interestingly, there is a mysterious female
character named Geraldine (Rhona Mitra, Hollow Man) in the remake,
somewhat of a nod to the original role played by Geraldine Moffatt.</P>
<P>Even without the lackluster comparisons to the original film, Carter has
plenty of problems.  The film appears to be set just before Christmas,
but there isn't the slightest hint of chilly weather.  It is perpetually
gloomy and rainy in Carter's Seattle, which doesn't stop Jack from
sporting sunglasses most of the time.  Stallone's performance is
unremarkable in every way, unless you count the disgusting veins
protruding from his shoulders and arms, or the goatee that's supposed to
make him look younger.</P>
<P>Editor Jerry Greenberg (Duets), whose technique resembles the comedic
styling of Robin Williams after fourteen espressos, makes Carter's
action scenes more annoying and spastic than Armageddon.  The film was
directed by Stephen T. Kay (The Last Time I Committed Suicide and one of
the screenwriters of The Mod Squad) and adapted by David McKenna (Body
Shots).  Kay's direction is `highlighted' by a scene where the camera is
turned upside down in an attempt to show how Carter's life has gone
topsy-turvy.  Give me a break.</P>
<P>1:40 – R for violence, adult language, sexual content and drug content</P>
