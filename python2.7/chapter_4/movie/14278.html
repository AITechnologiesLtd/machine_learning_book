<P>   Mary Kay Place, an accomplished performer who attended
a recent invitational screening of the film "Pecker" (in which
she plays the mother of the title character), was stopped on
the way out by two enthusiastic women in the audience.  "Oh,
you're Mary Kay Place, my favorite actress!" one cried out, in
a manner befitting a wide-eyed tourist more than a New York
cineaste.  Do actors really like receiving this notice wherever
they go?  More likely they're embarrassed.  If not, why would
they walk the streets with dark shades, false moustaches, and
baseball hats with low-slung peaks?  You spend years
working for public recognition and the rest of your career
trying to avoid it.  This invasion of Ms. Place's privacy--which
probably echoes a hundred-fold each year for actors
everywhere--is the price that celebrities pay for their status
and ironically enough is one of two central themes of John
Waters's latest picture, "Pecker."  Waters unfolds a palette of
colorful, blue-collar folks in his native Baltimore who gain their
fifteen minutes of national fame.  Like any who at one time
put on a middle-school show and later achieve renown, they
like the attention at first.  They soon realize that prominence
has its price.  In "Pecker" each character in turn is deprived of
his privacy and suffers a pitiful loss.  In showing us this cycle
of happy, homespun lives ruined by the limelight, Waters also
sends up New York's pseudo-sophisticated set of fashion
fixated gallery hoppers, comparing them unfavorably with the
working-class people he apparently relishes in the
unacclaimed stretches of backwater Baltimore.</P>
<P>   Adventurous moviegoers remember John Waters as the
creator of outrageous but accessible comedies like
"Hairspray" (a fun story featuring Sonny Bono in a nostalgic
satire about the a TV teen dance program in 1962 Baltimore);
"Polyester," (a more mainstream feature about a housewife
driven to he brink by her nightmarish family); and "Serial
Mom" (a satire of Marin County, California and its residents'
obsession with sexual trends and psychological cant).  With
"Pecker," Waters is aiming for an audience with just slightly
more commercial tastes as he contrasts the earthy, though
not quite bland, residents of Baltimore's Hampden
neighborhood with the bogus Manhattan sophisticates who, to
their credit, keep museums and art galleries flourishing but
who cannot resist trendy schlock.</P>
<P>   The schlockmeister this time is actually a nice 18-year-old
kid, Pecker (Edward Furlong),  who compulsively takes photos
of the oddballs of the vicinity and who makes no pretense that
his glossies are art.  He captures his friend Matt (Brendan
Sexton III) in the daily act of shoplifting; his girlfriend Shelley
(Christina Ricci), who tyrannically manages the local
laundromat; his kid sister Chrissy (Lauren Hulsey), a sugar
addict who eats Domino straight from the bag; his older sister
Tina (Martha Plimpton) who works at a gay male strip bar; his
grandma Memama (Jean Schertier) whose statue of Virgin
Mary frequently speaks; and his mother Joyce (Mary Kay
Place), who runs a thrift shop and advises the homeless how
to be fashion plates for a quarter an outfit.</P>
<P>   When Pecker's grainy photos come to the attention of a
New York art mavin, he is propelled into luminary status and
is given a gallery show that attracts the city's fashionable
community.  The notice placed on him and the members of
his photographed circle draw some unwanted attention. 
Chrissy is visited by a medical social worker who puts the
chocoholic on Ritalin, turning her into a zombie-like carrot-
lover.  Joyce and her husband are written up in the
fashionable journals as "culturally challenged."  Others in his
circle lose their jobs, and that's just the starter.</P>
<P>   Essentially, though, Waters appears to focus more on the
one-liners than on a story with a robust center, and the film
must be judged on the success of these quick gags.  Here is
one movie, believe-it-or-not, that could profit from one of
those obnoxious laugh-tracks popular with TV sitcoms.  Each
time a pompous New Yorker exposes himself for the fraud he
is, he appears to pause as if waiting for the obligatory giggle. 
Whenever a white-trash Baltimorian shows himself for the
hayseed he is, he looks almost embarrassed as if he has
come onstage to do a neophytes improvisations rather than a
professional's prepared shtick.  A good example of a physical
gag that falls flat is Matt's secretly piling up the shopping carts
of supermarket patrons with inappropriate stuff: a muscular
health nut is tossed Preparation H without his knowledge,
another man is given a box of Tampax.  As they reach the
checkout counter simultaneously complaining that they had
not selected the items, Matt goes to work on the shelves
lifting every product in sight.</P>
<P>   "Pecker" is suprisingly toned down for a John Water picture,
and even its depictions of the activities inside a gay bar
emceed by Tina would scarcely raise Dan Quayle's eyebrow. 
Christina Ricci stands out in this crowd as the acid-tongued
overseer of the neighborhood laundromat laying down the law
to a clientele of weirdos who do everything from pouring
strong dye down the mouth of a washer to using a vibrating
machine as a sex doll.  The New York world of art
cognescenti parody themselves in that city's museums and
galleries quite well without needing a filmed lampoon, and the
Baltimore working-class community are too close to normal to
evoke more than a chuckle.</P>
