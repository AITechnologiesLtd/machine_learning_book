A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: John Madden</PRE>
<P>Written by: Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard</P>
<P>Ingredients: Shakespeare, Lady dressing like man,</P>
<P>Starring: Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes, Judi Dench</P>
<P>Synopsis:
The setting is Old England, in days when only men are allowed to be
actors. Even women's roles are acted by men. A girl named Viola (Gwyneth
Paltrow) wants to become a thespian so badly that she dresses up like a
man and calls herself Mr. Kent in order to audition for Will
Shakespeare's acting troupe.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, separated from his wife and two children, Will Shakespeare
(Joseph Fiennes) can't seem to find inspiration for writing his play
Romeo and Juliet without being in love. He falls in love with Viola not
knowing she is Kent. Viola loves Will in return, but then Viola's father
commands her to become the fiancee of Lord Wessex.</P>
<P>Will love prevail? Will Romeo and Juliet ever be completed and
performed?</P>
<P>Opinion:
A movie where everyone speaks Old English, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is a
farcical, high energy situation comedy with as many pratfalls and quirky
characters as any SEINFELD or SPIN CITY episode. Gwyneth Paltrow excels
as the scheming heroine who must always stay one step ahead of others in
order to maintain her well-meaning deceptions. Viola's schemes, along
with the joyous sword fighting and swinging around, make SHAKESPEARE IN
LOVE a lighthearted and fun romp.</P>
