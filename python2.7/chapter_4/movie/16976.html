<PRE>Who Am I? (1998)

A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1999 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>Jackie Chan may not make the best films, but there's no question that he makes
some of the most entertaining and audience-friendly ones.  "It's not Bach," a
friend once said, "but it is at least Offenbach."</P>
<P>"Who Am I?", a Hong Kong production which was released direct-to-video
through Columbia TriStar, is very much in the same vein as "Rumble in the
Bronx".  Its plot is mostly a clothesline on which Jackie hangs as many
stunts, visual gags, bits of derring-do, slapstick, and everything else that
isn't hammered down.</P>
<P>And what of the plot, you ask?  Jackie plays a member of a secret military
platoon who're deployed to get their hands on a meteorite fragment that can be
used as an energy source.  The platoon is betrayed from within, and Jackie
takes a chuteless nosedive from his helicopter.  He wakes up, sans memory, in
the care of a jungle tribe.  "Who am I?" he cries out, and the running
(Homeric?) gag of the movie is that Whoami becomes his name.  (The tribe, BTW,
is depicted with a surprising amount of sensitivity and intelligence given the
movie's pedigree.  They've got T-shirts and binoculars, and understand that
Jackie fell out of a crashed copter, not some Great Metal Sky-Bird.)</P>
<P>The movie actually gets a lot less mileage out of Jackie's memory loss as a
plot device, but it gets a lot of mileage regardless.  Jackie saves a
motorcross driver from snakebite (driving the ATV over the finish line
himself); gets mixed up with a journalist who wants to write about his story;
wrecks a Mitsubishi sports car; winds up in the Netherlands, throwing wooden
shoes at the bad guys; and gets into a rooftop fight with two astonishingly
brutal savate' fighters.  The usual stuff, but it's served up with a good
sense of fun and a fast-moving camera.</P>
<P>And of course, we get to see Jackie's end-of-movie outtakes.  It wouldn't be a
Jackie Chan film without at least one shot of him on the stretcher -- although
this time around, we get to *hear* outtakes as well, from the studio sessions
where Jackie sang the title tune.  And as a singer, Jackie's mostly a pretty
good stuntman.  Like the man says: not Bach, I guess, but certainly Offenbach.</P>
