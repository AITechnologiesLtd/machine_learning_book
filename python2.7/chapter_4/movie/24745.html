<P>It's easy to make a bad movie look good in a trailer: Arrange a couple of 
moments into a fast-paced rhythm, stick a nice song on the soundtrack, and 
overlay some snappy lines. Recently, though, some wonderful movies have been 
getting sloppy treatment in the ads -- think of "Three Kings" and "The Green 
Mile", and now "The Whole Nine Yards". The studios must have pissed off their 
publicists something awful.</P>
<P>The commercials for "The Whole Nine Yards" make it look like a completely 
inane buddy comedy, full of people goofily shouting and bumping into doors. 
It's actually a much more skilful and witty picture; even Matthew Perry, an 
actor I previously hated, impressed me with his performance. In the 
television show "Friends" he scrunches his face, raises his voice, and always 
seems to be asking a question. Here, his voice is slower and calmer, and he 
plays a more likeable man, with reasonable worries and desires.</P>
<P>His name is Oz, a Chicago dentist living in Toronto because his bloodsucking 
French-Canadian wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette) refuses to move. In next door 
moves Jimmy (Bruce Willis), who Oz recognises as an infamous Mafia hitman 
from back home. Sophie discovers that some of Jimmy's old gangster pals have 
a contract out on his life, and tries to get Oz to turn him in and collect a 
reward.</P>
<P>Oz travels to Chicago just to humour her and get a break, and even though he 
has no intention of actually getting involved with any criminals, they 
somehow know he has information, and are on his back as soon as he steps off 
the plane. Our hero's life gets complicated from here on in, and so does the 
movie's plot --Oz just wants to keep his head above water, but both the 
groups of enemies are using him as a pawn, he's fallen in love with Jimmy's 
wife, and his secretary Jill (Amanda Peet) wants to jump in and become a 
contract killer herself.</P>
<P>The story is violent, and features a lot of complex plotting and 
double-crossing, but it's sweet, enjoyable and easy to follow because the 
director, Jonathan Lynn, sets such an easy-going tone, and there's a cute 
central friendship between Oz, Jimmy and Jill. Perry, as I've already 
mentioned, performs in an uncharacteristically grounded manner; and Bruce 
Willis is an actor who always seems calm and self-assured, even when 
buildings are falling down around him. By simply adding a grin to this, he 
gives Jimmy an amusingly devious authority. And Amanda Peet, as the secretary 
who gets excited and giggly from the most perverse and macabre of things, 
gives off wonderful vibes of silly energy.</P>
<P>It was also a wise decision to set the movie in Toronto. American light 
comedy movies are normally set in stunningly clean and stylish versions of 
big US cities, and the unusual location makes Lynn pay attention to the 
surroundings, and use them to add texture to his picture. He was in the same 
position when he made the Alabaman "My Cousin Vinny" (1992), which is one of 
my favourite films. "The Whole Nine Yards" is not its equal, but it's a lot 
better than you'd expect from those damned trailers.</P>
