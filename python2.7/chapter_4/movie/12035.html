<P>  Without a doubt the most hilarious film in many a year.   And why
not?   Written and directed by one of the funniest, most talented
persons in the business, Larry David, who co-created, wrote, directed
and produced many of the SEINFELD shows, has come up with a farce to
end all farces.   How would you like a belly laugh every 30 seconds?
This film is where you will find that.</P>
<P>  A simple story.  No point in complicating things as the comic moments
all come naturally as well as fast and furiously.    This is one film
you do not want to see end.</P>
<P>  Evan (Steven Weber) is a brain surgeon.   His cousin Richie (Craig
Bierko) is a designer of soles for sneakers.   The two cousins and
their girl friends Joan (Karen Sillas) and Roberta (Robyn Peterman)
take off for a gambling spree in Atlantic City.  As the evening is
about to come to an end with all having lost all but a few coins, the
two men sit at adjoining slot machines.   Down to his last quarter,
Richie asks Evan to give him a couple of quarters for his last try at
the machine that takes up to three quarters. . . and Richie comes up
with a winning jackpot of over $400,000.</P>
<P>  In an expansive mood he treats the four to dinner and talks of
hiring a limousine and chauffeur to celebrate.   Evan, it is obvious,
is not happy.   It does not take a genius to recognize that he feels
he is entitled to at least half the winnings as it was his two quarters
that enabled his cousin to get the jackpot; you do not win  a jackpot
with one coin.    In fact, as it was Evan's two coins to Richie's one,
Evan feels, although he will not press the point, that he really is
entitled to two thirds.</P>
<P>  When he finally mentions that to Richie it sets off a whole series of
comic events as Ritchie does not see it Evan's way.    It was HIS
machine that one.   Finally, to keep the peace he offers Evans $1000
which Evans promptly rejects, tearing up the check.   The ante is later
upped to 3% and that paltry amount is also rejected.</P>
<P>  The girlfriends disagree about the sharing of the money with Evan.
This, too, leads to some funny moments.   One who does not think Evan
is entitled to anything is Richie's  mother, Selma (Viola Harris)  who
gives a great performance as a "smothering" mother to the nth degree.</P>
<P>  Too many gags, (and who wants to reveal them all?)  involve an Xray,
an attempt to frighten Selma to death as she cannot live without her
son should anything happen to him.   There is still another Xray which
accidentally is put up to the light backwards so the healthy appendage
is removed from Danny Pepper, (Matt Keeslar) an actor and a character.
A little incident with a man in the hospital elevator who allows the
door to shut so Richie cannot get on leads to more comedy.  In fact,
everything, however small and seemingly of no importance, takes on
new meaning in the next scenes and all good for great laughs.</P>
<P>   Warning:  You have no one to blame but yourself if you miss this
wonderfully entertaining film.   I can't remember when last I laughed
as hard and often in a movie.</P>
