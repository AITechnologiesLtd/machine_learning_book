<PRE>                               INSTINCT
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<PRE>     Hannibal Lecter, meet Tarzan, Lord of the Apes.</PRE>
<P>     Sad but true, that's all it takes to boil down INSTINCT, a curious
blend of thriller and feel-good prison movie that manages to somehow be
neither.</P>
<P>     The story of Ethan Powell (Hopkins), a highly intelligent doctor
(sound familiar yet?) and primatologist who opts to live with the
gorillas in Rwanda for a couple of years, and goes a bit primal on us.
Several years later, Doc Powell is extradited after murdered a few
Rwandans.  Oh, and he won't speak any more.  So they bring in hotshot
psychiatrist resident Theo Caulder (Gooding) to deconstruct Powell and
bring him back into the fold.</P>
<P>     Here's where we throw in a little CUCKOO'S NEST (in fact, several
of the inmates of Powell's prison seem lifted from CUCKOO's NEST
entirely!).  I half-expected to see Chief along the way.</P>
<P>     Despite the movie's pretense, there's little mystery along the
way.  We know all along who gets killed and why.  If *you* can't figure
it out, you need to go see STAR WARS again.  But aside from some lightly</P>
<P>humorous moments, INSTINCT is largely predictable and tiresome, and it
isn't likely to click with many audiences.  And let me just add that
Maura Tierney (Powell's daughter) has *always* rubbed me the wrong way.</P>
<P>     INSTINCT is not a bad movie.  It's just not a terribly well-made
one.  Regardless, I'm sure I won't be the only one (accidentally)
calling it "Instink".</P>
