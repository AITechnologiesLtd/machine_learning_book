<PRE>NEVER BEEN KISSED (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Steve Kong
Copyright 1999 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Someone give a pat on the back to Drew Barrymore's agent.  This agent has
literally erased the bad girl image of Barrymore with the last few films
she has done.  And with Never Been Kissed it's not any different, Barrymore
is just so lovable in this film.</P>
<P>Never Been Kissed is not a plausible film by any means: A 25 year old copy
editor from the Chicago Sun Times, who has never really been kissed, is
sent back to high school to do an undercover story about high school life
in the 90s.  But, this implausibility is instantly lost as we meet Josie
(Barrymore) Gellar, the copy who is going to be sent on the assignment.
Barrymore is so cute and huggable in this film that we instantly relate to her.</P>
<P>Josie is, at first, ecstatic about the undercover assignment  it marks her
first writing assignment for the Sun Times.  But, as her brother Rob (David
Arquette) reminds her of the things that she went through her first time in
high school she starts to withdraw from the idea of going back a second
time.   Josie was a loser in high school, known as `Josie Grossie', and it
takes a bit of pep talking from Rob to get her to go back to high school.
As Josie starts high school again she meets a very attractive English
teacher, Sam, and this establishes the romantic part of this romantic comedy.</P>
<P>At the heart of Never Been Kissed is a story of finding oneself and second
chances.  We see this theme in Josie's story, but also in Rob's.  The story
is heartwarming and funny and will definitely appeal to many  especially
those who are currently in high school or about to enter high school.  This
is a film that falls squarely in the crowd-pleaser category and it succeeds
wildly at this.</P>
<P>Barrymore is so sweet in Never Been Kissed that it's hard to criticize her
performance.  Her performance is just fine in Never Been Kissed  though
sometimes a bit hokey, like early on in the film where she describes how
she's never really been kissed.  The performance that I liked the most is
David Arquette's.  Arquette gives an energetic performance as Josie's loser
brother who dreams of playing baseball in the majors.</P>
<P>Don't Miss Never Been Kissed in the theatres.  This is a film that will
make you all warm and fuzzy by the end of the film.  This film will also
have you leaving the theatre with a smile on your face and tears in your eyes.</P>
