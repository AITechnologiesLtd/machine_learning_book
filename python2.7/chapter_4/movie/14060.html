<P>I was looking at the New York Times yesterday, and there was this ad
for "Microsun" light bulbs.  They're full spectrum bulbs that are made
to reproduce direct sunlight, or something along those lines.  Given
how things work in "Blade", a few of these around the house would make
a vampire's life suck.</P>
<P>"Blade" is the latest comic book to big screen migration.  While I
understand the project has been kicking around for many years, it was
probably the popularity of "Buffy The Vampire Slayer" that finally got
it rolling.  Actually, there was one or two other vampire movies being
previewed before "Blade": a John Carpenter film and maybe something
else (I wasn't paying that much attention).  These differ from the,
say, Anne Rice genre just before this by focusing on the "vampire
slayer", a la Buffy, rather than on vampire sex lives.  The John
Carpenter preview looked more like "Aliens" than "Dracula", actually.</P>
<P>Anyway, "Blade" is this superhero who's half vampire, capable of
walking in daylight, immune to garlic and such, but with a vampire's
strength.  He's pissed at all vampires for Freudian reasons, and
"pissed" is expressed in terms of large caliber guns and swords.  No
dainty wooden stake here.  There's, of course, a big bad-ass vampire he
has to go against sometime in the film, said vampire wanting to take
over the world and all.  Blade stops him at the end, after getting in
touch with his Inner Vampire.  It's a cathartic moment, capable of
making grown men cry.</P>
<P>Blade fares better than Spawn, the most recent comic book superhero to
go to Hollywood, at least in terms of the suckiness of the big screen
adaption.  "Blade" is actually entertaining, the action sequences fast
and well done, as opposed to the too-much-special-effects battering we
receive in "Spawn".  It's not a bad movie.</P>
<P>One interesting sideline they meander into with "Blade" is to have this
hematologist get bitten by a vamp.  The result is an X-Files worthy
trip into technical sounding explanations: vampires seem to have a
different blood chemistry, they drink blood because their own blood
can't sustain hemaglobins for very long, etc.  They go as far come up
with a "gene therapy" cure for vampirism.  Mystical explanations aren't
necessary for the existence of vampires: it's just a blood-borne
disease, the CDC bulletin being in the works.</P>
<P>Vampires also seem to be regular guys, except they have a deep thirst
for human blood.  Well, at least with the biochemical explanation,
there's no obvious reason you'd turn from being Bob the lovable office
clown one minute to Bob the homicidal maniac the next.  At least with
"Buffy", a vampire is a demon inhabiting a human body.  Perhaps
"Blade" says we're all evil at heart.  Or maybe there's a lack of
consistency.</P>
<P>The science bits go out the window at the end, when Demon Boy comes
down to do some damage.  I though it might have been more interesting
if this "Blood God" turned out to be a biological-warfare inspired
aerosol mist, filled with vampire cooties, turning all that come in
contact with it into vampires, as was perhaps suggested somewhere in
the film.  It would have fit in with the virus thing a bit better and
be more terrifyingly apocalyptic, but, alas, it was not the case.</P>
<P>Other bits of late 20th C. technology cause havoc with any sort of
vampirical mysticism.  SPF15 sunblock apparently does wonders for
vampire skin, though the good guys do have a big flash light tuned to
the UV end of the spectrum.  In this world, vampires simply tan badly.
(Interestingly, I think there might have been some UV lamps in the
disco during the opening sequence.  Care must be taken with interior
decorations.)</P>
<P>A Mac Powerbook is also used during the film, by the Bad Guy to decipher
such-and-such prophesy to unleash this bigger demon.  Apple has thus
far gone from being a slick tool of secret agents ("Mission
Impossible", where a Mac laptop went head to head with a PC, which
lost), to saving the world ("ID4"), and now to black arts.  Truly a
versatile little machine.  Macintosh: The Power to Take Over The
World.  Think different, indeed.</P>
