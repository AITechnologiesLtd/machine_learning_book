<P>"Dream With the Fishes," the film debut of director Finn Taylor that 
premiered at Sundance, is a peculiar, unconventional little film, but 
one that is extremely well-written and carefully handled. </P>
<P>At the start of the film, we meet Terry (David Arquette), a young man in 
his 20's who is a very lonely person, and spends his time acting as a 
peeping tom towards the people that live in the building beside his. One 
night during an attempted suicide, he meets Nick (Brad Hunt), one of his 
spying subjects, whom has a fatal disease and is going to die in a few 
weeks. It seems Terry is depressed because of the death of his wife in a 
car accident. Since one wants to die, and the other is definately going 
to, they form a sort of dysfunctional bond with each other, and proceed 
to live out some of their fantasies, such as nude bowling and taking 
acid. When they travel to Nick's hometown, they are greeted unfavorably 
by his father (J.E. Freeman), who wants nothing to do with him. Instead, 
they end up staying at the home of his Aunt Elise (Cathy Moriarty), an 
understanding former stripper. Soon, Nick's live-in girlfriend, Liz 
(Kathryn Erbe), who Terry secretly fantasizes about, catches up with 
them.</P>
<P>By the sound of, "Dream With the Fishes," it may seem like a film that 
might have very little story, and one that might meander, but that isn't 
the case at all, primarily due to Finn Taylor's smart, offbeat 
screenplay. But then again, this isn't really a "plot"-style film as 
much as it is a "character" film, and that is one of the great joys in 
watching it. The characters are all fascinating people, and it is fun to 
follow them through the film to see what happens next, which is mostly 
because of the fact that it is completely unpredictable. The most 
interesting character is Liz, who is obsessed with tatoos and on the 
surface is quite hard-edged, but slowly begins to hint that that might 
just be a facade to hide under. After all, she does very much care for 
Nick, and is sympathetic towards Terry's problems. Kathryn Erbe plays 
her wonderfully, and she is a talented actress who has been very good 
before in other films, particularly 1993's sweet slice-of-life, "Rich in 
Love." Also standing out is Cathy Moriarty, who almost always brings 
something special to every role she plays.</P>
<P>Aside from the performances and characters, another plus is the 
exuberant soundtrack, which includes an especially appropriate song, 
"Fisherman's Blues," by The Waterboys. </P>
<P>With "Dream With the Fishes," Finn Taylor has proven himself to be an 
original director that is definately someone to look for in the future. 
He has a way with words, characters, and what is most surprising is how 
touching much of the film is without ever taking the easy route, and 
going for obviousness or predictable, maudlin melodrama. </P>
