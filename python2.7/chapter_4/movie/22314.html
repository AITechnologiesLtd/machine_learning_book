<PRE>Review by Donlee Brussel</PRE>
<P>In this corner, the master of playing the Negro oppressed by the white
man, the two-time Oscar nominee (Cry Freedom & Malcolm X) and once
Oscar winner (Glory), the thespian, the one and only Denzel
Washington!  And in the other corner, the master craftsman of the
clichéd & manipulative (Bogus), the thrice Oscar nominated (In The Heat
of the Night, Fiddler on the Roof & Moonstruck) and Irving G. Thalberg
Memorial Award recipient, the man with the plan, Norman Jewison!
Together for the first time since "A Soldier's Story," in a film based
on "Lazarus and The Hurricane" by Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton, and
on "The 16th Round" by Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter.  Ladies and
gentleman, "The Hurricane!"</P>
<P>The film opens on December 20, 1963 with an awesome black and white
boxing match (shot elaborately by Roger Deakins) between Rubin and
Griffith.  From that point on, the film never ceases to amaze us.
Presented in a non-linear form with a heavy dosage of drama, and solid
acting across the board, "Hurricane" ends up a real KO.  Of admirable
merit are Jewison's top-notch directing, Denzel Washington's superbly
complex and multi-layered performance and the fascinating story of
Carter adapted for the screen by Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon.</P>
<P>Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a great boxer, possibly one of the
greatest of all time.  The film chronicles his life from childhood to
his wrongful murder conviction because of a corrupt cop (Dan Hedaya) to
his triumphant release from prison.  How he got out of jail after being
imprisoned for 20 years is an "incredible" true story.</P>
<P>After reading Carter's book, Lesra Martin feels a deep connection
between himself and the author and decides to seek him out.  He writes
a letter and after getting a reply, visits Hurricane in jail.  The two
have a meaningful conversation that makes Lesra enlist the help of the
three Canadians (Liev Schreiber, Deborah Unger & John Hannah) he's
living with to come and help him free Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.</P>
<P>Denzel Washington does a great job of playing African Americans
oppressed by the Caucasian race as evidenced by his multiple awards for
playing those kinds of roles.  He's the best at doing characters like
Malcolm X in "Malcolm X," Trip in  "Glory," or Rubin Carter in "The
Hurricane."  He has the ability to transform into these characters,
both physically and mentally.  Washington gave this film everything he
had and it shows.  Throughout "Hurricane," there's not one scene where
we're watching Denzel Washington, we're always watching Rubin.  In my
humble opinion, I think he gives the best male performance of 1999.</P>
<P>In addition to Washington, there's a great supporting cast headed by
Vicellous Reon Shannon.  It gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside to
say that this is a talented young actor that we should keep an eye on,
especially with this being the year of praise heaped upon such
overrated prodigies as Haley Joel Osment.  Shannon shows a skillful
amount of range in his role of Lesra Martin, a role that will probably
go underrated.</P>
<P>Then there's Dan Hedaya, resplendent as always as the conspicuous
police lieutenant who's trying to keep the black man (In this case,
Rubin Carter) down.  There's nothing like a really good antagonist to
make a film complete.  Unless of course, it's the king of over the top
actors, Rod Steiger!  Fresh from the ruins of "End of Days," he's here
in a superincumbent role as the judge for the big courtroom climax.</P>
<P>With so many biographies being made into films these days, it's
refreshing to see one as good as this.  "The Hurricane" is one that
actually had everyone pour their heart and soul into it.</P>
