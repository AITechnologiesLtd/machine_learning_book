<PRE>Avalon (1990)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 77</PRE>
<P>Barry Levinson directed, co-produced and wrote the
screenplay for "Avalon", his third film (after "Diner"
and "Tin Men") set in Baltimore and based on
semi-autobiographical events.  It is a beautifully
photographed, intelligently written and somewhat
sad film.</P>
<P>"Avalon" tells the story of a Polish-American family.
Sam (Armin Mueller-Stahl) and wife Eva (Joan Plowright)
are immigrants from Poland.  Their grown son Jules
(Aidan Quinn) is a salesman, with wife Anne (Elizabeth
Perkins) and young son Michael (Elijah Wood).  Jules's
ambitions with cousin Izzy (Kevin Pollak) lead to a brief
merchandising empire built on a warehouse full of consumer
goods.</P>
<P>Most of the film takes place in the late 1940s, and
Levinson takes pains to point out the great transformations
that were occuring in American society during that period.
Mass transit was being replaced by the automobile,
the middle class was moving to the suburbs, the extended
family was shrinking into the nuclear family.  Television
was being introduced, and America was fascinated by the
small glowing screen.  These cultural changes are
worked effortlessly into the story and characters.</P>
<P>The comic relief mostly comes from Sam and Eva's
conversations.  They are circular and repetitive,
but entertaining.  To Jules and Anne, it appears that
their parents are arguing.  This is one of many examples
of the cross-cultural gap between the aging immigrants
and their American-born children, who have no accents,
find the 'Family Circle' ritual tedious, and have
Americanized their last names.</P>
<P>"Avalon" was nominated for several Academy Awards,
including Best Original Screenplay (Barry Levinson),
Best Cinematography (Allen Daviau), Best Original
Score (Randy Newman) and Best Costume Design
(Gloria Gresham).  The Golden Globes nominated it
for Best Film in the Dramatic category.</P>
