<P>BOYS DON'T CRY (R).  
(Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: Kimberly Peirce
Stars: Hilary Swank, Chloe Sevigny, Peter Sarsgaard, Brendan Sexton III, 
Alison Folland, Alicia Gornason, Matt McGrath, Rob Campbell, Jeanetta Arnette
Running time: 114 minutes.</P>
<P>Like the recent Ma Vie En Rose, Boys Don't Cry is a
confronting and disturbing, but compelling look at a confused teenager
who chooses to live life on their own terms, contrary to the accepted
norms of the larger society around them.</P>
<P>Boys Don't Cry tells the true story of Teena Brandon, a
disaffected, tomboyish teenage girl from Nebraska, suffering from a
serious crisis of sexual identity.  She switched genders to live life
as a boy, and was eventually murdered by a couple of bigoted,
homophobic thugs.  Wrapping her breasts in bandages, stuffing a sock
down the front of her jeans, and calling herself Brandon, she moved
away from her hometown of Lincoln, in the conservative heartland of
America's midwest. Arriving in nearby Falls City, Brandon begins her
new life as a boy, a sort of rebel without a penis.</P>
<P>A bar room brawl leads to a friendship with Candace (Alicia
Goranson) and Kate (Allison Folland, from All Over Me, etc), and
ex-cons John (Peter Sarsgaard, from Dead Man Walking, etc) and Tom
(Brendan Sexton III, from Hurricane Streets, etc).  Brandon fabricates
details about his past life, which are at first accepted by his new
friends.</P>
<P>But it is the lonely and insecure Lana (Chloe Sevigny, from
Kids, etc), who dreams of becoming a famous karaoke singer, with whom
Brandon develops a relationship.  Desperate for affection, Lana allows
the relationship to develop without question, even when John and Tom
grow suspicious about Brandon.  When Brandon's true identity and
secret is revealed, fear and ignorance give way to unthinking hatred
and violence.</P>
<P>In exploring the hypocrisy of modern America, the white trash
of America's midwest, and larger questions about troubled youth and
sexual identity, this bleak and confronting film also occupies the
same seedy cinematic territory as Welcome To The Dollhouse and the
repellent Gummo.  In some ways Boys Don't Cry is a depressing and grim
film, but it is also surprisingly rewarding and inspiring.  This is
evident through the compassionate treatment of the difficult subject
matter and the occasionally sympathetic view of the sometimes uglier
elements of human behaviour.</P>
<P>For first time feature director Kimberly Peirce this has been
something of a labour of love, and she spent five years researching
the story and getting inside the character.  Peirce draws uniformly
strong performances from her ensemble cast, comprising some of the
finest young actors working in the American independent film scene.</P>
<P>Hilary Swank, best known for her role in the forgettable The
Next Karate Kid, has attracted a swag of accolades and awards for her
sensational and virtuoso performance here.  She beautifully captures
Brandon's androgynous quality, vividly portraying both the brooding
masculinity, the boyish swagger and the chiselled good looks, as well
as the more vulnerable elements of this complex and contradictory
character.  Sevigny is sublime as the trusting Lana, and delivers a
moving and memorable performance.  Sexton, cast against type, and
Sarsgaard effectively capture the latent violence lurking just below
the surface of their characters.</P>
<P>Boys Don't Cry is not a film that will sit comfortably with
everyone.  Peirce deliberately sets out to elicit a response from the
audience, and she succeeds.  Boys Don't Cry is one film that occupies
your mind days after having seen it.</P>
