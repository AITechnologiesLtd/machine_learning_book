<P>     The obvious question associated with the creation of HOME ALONE 3 is
"why," though not for the obvious reasons.  You'd certainly expect a third
installment from a series where the first two racked up a collective $457
million, even if the star of those two films has been spending more time
lately in court than on screen.  It's just that HOME ALONE guru John
Hughes has been doing a perfectly serviceable job of re-cycling that
successful formula without using the HOME ALONE name.  BABY'S DAY OUT, 101
DALMATIANS and FLUBBER have managed to turn pratfalls, scatology and groin
injuries into cash without conjuring up the yelping visage of Macaulay
Culkin.  Why start now?</P>
<P>     Why indeed, especially if you're going to fumble the formula the way
HOME ALONE 3 does.  The required elements appear to be in place -- a
youngster (Alex D. Linz as Alex Pruitt), absentee parents, a snow-covered
Midwestern suburb, nefarious intruders, several severe bodily injuries
and property damage in the six-figure range -- but everything feels just
slightly askew.  The little boy, rather than being a mischievous imp, is a
minor scientific genius and all-around upstanding citizen.  Goofy
antagonists Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern have been replaced by Olek Krupa,
Rya Kihlstedt, Lenny Von Dohlen and David Thornton as international
criminals looking for a stolen missile guidance chip in Alex's possession,
characters a bit too chilly and sinister to be fun.  And the direction by
Raja Gosnell, taking over for Chris Columbus, drags the pace so badly
during the first hour that kids may be snoring long before they chuckle
for the first time.</P>
<P>     Now, no one has ever accused me of championing John Hughes' modus
operandi in the 90s, when he lost all interest in films for viewers over
the age of 10.  In fact, I'm pretty sure it's one of the Biblical signs of
the end-times.  But let's face it -- the formula works.  Hughes has made
the live-action Warner Bros. cartoon his personal dominion; HOME ALONE is
basically a Road Runner/Coyote adventure where the Road Runner has finally
gotten his hands on the Acme catalog.  HOME ALONE 3 includes all of
Hughes' most annoying habits -- cloying sentimentality, utter disdain for
adults, crotch-level comedy -- with little of the mitigating
frivolousness.  The Road Runner turns into a Rhodes scholar, Wile E.
Coyote into a James Bond villain, and the trip-hammer pacing something
more suited to Merchant Ivory than Chuck Jones.</P>
<P>     Of course, I can't recall a Merchant Ivory film which included so
many different things dropped on people's heads.  The villains in HOME
ALONE 3 are brained from above with books, barbells, decorative flower
pots, a lawn mower, lumber and human excrement, among other things, which
Nick Glennie-Smith's relentlessly whimsical score reminds us is jolly good
fun.  Certainly all the mayhem will keep the kids giggling, assuming you
rouse them from their naps, but there are so many different ways to see
exactly the same material with more energy and at significantly less cost.
John Hughes has done himself in by turning out a HOME ALONE 3 which can't
keep up with HOME ALONE, HOME ALONE 2, or the dozen other de facto sequels
which didn't happen to bear the HOME ALONE name.</P>
<PRE>    On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 broken homes:  3.</PRE>
