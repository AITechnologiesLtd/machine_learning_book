<P>Genghis Blues:  The Best Movie You Haven't Seen</P>
<P>It was the Year of our Lord 1989 and International Communism in Europe
came crashing down with a thump.  Writer P.J. O'Rourke was in Berlin,
setting aside his usual cynical mien to exult.  "The West won the Cold
War," he shouted.  "The privileges of liberty and the rights of the
individual went out and kicked butt."  O'Rourke saw an impoverished East
German border guard stretching out a skinny hand through the ruins of
the Berlin Wall, begging some raucous students for a souvenir piece, and
he got all choked up.  "The tears of victory rolled down my face." he
wrote, "and the snot of victory did too, because it was an awfully cold
day."</P>
<P>Where O'Rourke was standing, he could still hear the glorious sound of
power tools tearing the Berlin Wall to pieces.  He couldn't have known
that, over ten years later, the triumphant echoes of that sound would
still ring out across the world.  And he would never, ever, have dreamed
that the echoes of freedom would stretch to a little Soviet
mini-republic called Tuva, half a world away from anywhere, and that
they can still be heard in the harmonious echoes of a traditional form
of music called throat singing.</P>
<P>Tuva is a little country on the map, wedged in between Siberia and
Mongolia.  We're told it's about the size of North Dakota, and it looks
to be on the same latitude as Winnipeg.  Its people are nomadic
sheepherders with a religion that's part shamanistic and part Tibetan
Buddhist.  Just as the Tibetans have been squashed by the Chinese
Communists over the years, the Soviets oppressed the Tuvans, forbidding
their clothing styles and culture and even their language.  When the
Soviets folded up their yurts and headed back to Moscow, the Tuvans were
free once more to talk and think and dress as they pleased, and pass on
their unique culture to their children.</P>
<P>But the recovery of freedom in Tuva is not the whole story of Genghis
Blues.</P>
<P>For, you see, Tuva had been free once before, back in the mid-1920s when
the Soviets were too busy fighting the Russian Civil War to pay
attention to Tuva.  The first free Tuvan state might have passed into
total obscurity had not they issued a set of odd-looking stamps.  A
young man named Richard Feynman collected these stamps, and grew up to
be a famously iconoclastic Nobel Prize winning physicist.  He developed
an interest in all things Tuvan (after all, he said, any place with a
capital named "Kyzyl" had to be interesting), but was denied permission
to visit Tuva by the Soviets.  His friends maintained the "Friends of
Tuva" association and were eventually successful in bringing some Tuvan
musicians to play in San Francisco in the early 1990's.</P>
<P>But the unlikely relationship between Americans and Tuvans is not the
whole story of Genghis Blues.</P>
<P>No, the real story is even more unlikely.  For at the Tuvans' concert in
San Francisco, a member of the audience met up with them backstage and
began throat singing a Tuvan ballad in the ancient style.  Paul Pena, a
blues musician who is blind, heard a Tuvan throat singing performance on
a shortwave radio some years before.  Fascinated, he figured out the
Tuvan musical style of throat singing, which involves using the lungs
like bagpipes to create this weird harmonic sound.  Well, the head of
the Tuvan delegation immediately invited Pena to the Tuvan throat
singing competition and cultural symposium in 1995.  Pena left San
Francisco and traveled to Tuva, accompanied by a team of kamikaze
filmmakers and a local radio DJ.</P>
<P>This is the story of Genghis Blues -- the story of the triumphal visit
of Paul Pena to Tuva -- and you won't see a better movie this year.</P>
<P>Now look, I know what you're thinking.  You're thinking that I've lost
my mind.  This can't be the best movie of the year.  It's a documentary,
for crying out loud.  It's got subtitles.  It's about some weird kind of
music that you have to hear to even believe.</P>
<P>I know.  It sounds incredibly goofy.  It sounds like the sort of movie
that your friend the film buff tells you to see that's only playing at a
tiny theater on the other side of town and has Ralph Fiennes wearing
something other than a Nazi uniform or Harvey Keitel not wearing
anything.</P>
<P>But trust me.  This is a great movie.  Let me tell you what happened to
me.  There's a scene, early on, where Pena visits a school in Tuva.  All
these little kids are lined up, and they're demonstrating throat
singing.  After they're finished, they come up to Pena -- who's this
great big shaggy bear of a guy -- and hug him and welcome him to their
country.  And one of these kids is wearing a San Francisco Giants cap,
and when I saw that, I started grinning and didn't stop.</P>
<P>It gets better.  (Not right away, there's a sheep slaughtering scene in
between, but it does.)  There are two scenes in this movie where Pena
gets on stage and performs... and... well, I'm never going to be a
throat singing fan, and if this stuff ever hits the airwaves on anything
other than NPR I'll be shocked.  But that doesn't matter, not one little
bit, because these scenes are electric.  Pena develops this incredible
rapport with the audience that completely transcends the music,
East-West relationships, anything you care to name.</P>
<P>There are those who say that 1999 was a great year for movies, and a lot
of them point to what they call "movie magic".  From a pure special
effects angle, they have a point, and movies like The Matrix and the new
Star Wars movie show a lot of technical wizardry.  But the real magic of
movies is not what's on screen but what's in the heart.  Genghis Blues
is the most magical movie of the year.  It tells an extraordinary story
about great characters in a faraway land, and it does it with the kind
of open, exuberant spirit you don't see in movies anymore.  Genghis
Blues reminds us that movies, like children and music, have the power to
stir the most cynical bean-bag of a heart.  Yes, and to make it dance.</P>
