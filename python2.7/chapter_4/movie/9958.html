<P>   During the postwar years Great Britain has not only lost a
huge empire but is threatened even now with the departure of
its northern province, Scotland.  Well, then, if the Scottish
independence movement wants to hasten the UK's egress, it
wouldn't hurt them to expose the powers-that-be to the film
"The Winter Guest," based on a play staged in 1995 by
Sharman MacDonald.  The action takes place on the coldest
day of the year in as remote an area as Atom Egoyan's
Canadian wilderness in his "The Sweet Hereafter," a place
that's so Godforsaken that if the ministers in London
considered it representative of Scotland, they would wash
their hands of the whole area with delight.  Of course, this
fishing village is as different from Edinburgh as Death Valley
is from New York City, but the rural area does make for an
effective backdrop to what is essentially a filmed, static play,
in which inner action substitutes for outward adventure.</P>
<P>   Under Alan Rickman's direction--which evokes some
powerful acting from an ensemble of performers headed by
Emma Thompson and her real-life mother Phyllida Law--"The
Winter Guest" shows the transformation occurring in an
assortment of people of varying generations and outlooks in
quite a short period of time, a metamorphosis all the more
surprising given the apparent shortage of stimulations that
people in more urban areas enjoy.  What Rickman has done
in adapting MacDonald's play to the screen is to switch back
and forth among four stories, weaving the disparate groups
into a whole as story concludes.  "The Winter Guest" is too
slow and uneventful for the typical film audience.  But if you
want an antidote to Tarantino-style cinematography and story-
lines, you couldn't find a movie with a style more dissimilar.</P>
<P>   The core relationship is between Frances (Emma
Thompson) and her vulnerable, interfering mother, Elspeth
(Phyllida Law), the latter paying a surprise visit on her
daughter shortly after the death of Frances's handsome
husband.   Frances, a gifted photographer who has suffered
emotionally over her loss, has resorted to taking black-and-
white photos of landscapes, even hiding in the bathroom
when she hears the salutation of her aging mother.  Elspeth's
heart is in the right place.  While she fears that her daughter
will leave her alone, making good on her promise to move
with her son Alex (Gary Hollywood) to Australia, she feels for
Frances and is determined to cheer her up--to change the
middle-aged woman's focus from death into a empathy for the
living souls around her.</P>
<P>   The small of people to whom we are introduced in the story
have had time to cultivate their eccentricities, particularly two
elderly women: the bulgy-eyed Chloe (Sandra Voe) and the
more down-to-earth Lily (Sheila Reid), who get their kicks
from reading obituaries and attending funerals.  No matter
that they care little about the departed and that they must wait
in the icy weather for a bus that seems to pass the frozen
stop but once a day.  They celebrate the funerals with visits to
a tea parlor where they close their eyes in ecstasy over slabs
of fresh Napoleon served with piping hot pots of tea.</P>
<P>   Youth get their representation through the coming of Alex's
first sexual experience. Rickman milks the eroticism by filming
a kind of extended foreplay-in-the-snow as Alex meets and
banters with the gamin-like Nita (Arlene Cockburn)--a forward
girl who resembles a young Liza Minelli and whose attraction
to the red-haired Alex is palpable.  Alex is conflicted about the
approaching experience, offering the young woman his
bathtub while she continues her seduction while wrapped in a
large Turkish towel.  In still another episode that adds comic
relief, a pair of boys of about the age of fourteen (Douglas
Murphy and Sean Biggerstaff) wander around the icy coastal
area jesting about women and scoring some yocks from the
audience when they discover a used condom.</P>
<P>   The key relationship is obviously on the mother-daughter
bond, one which begins like a mother-in-law joke as Frances
freezes up at the visit of her carping mother but warms up
enough to her to reconsider her proposed trip to antipodean
lands.  "The Winter Guest" is slow going, a theatrical movie
that borders on preciosity, as we are exposed to the icy wilds
of Scotland and to the flames, both real and metaphorical,
that help to heat up the eight principals.  Its real home is the
stage, though we have Alan Rickman to thanks for allowing a
greater audience into the recesses of his characters through
the medium of the cinema.  Rated R.  Running Time: 110
minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
