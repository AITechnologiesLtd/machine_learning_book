<PRE>                               THE RIVER WILD
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Meryl Streep, Kevin Bacon, David Strathairn, Joseph
Mazzello, John C. Reilly.
Screenplay:  Denis O'Neil.
Director:  Curtis Hanson.</P>
<P>     Meryl Streep has proved to be an actor impossible to pigeonhole.
Early in her career, she became renowned for her roles in such serious
fare as SOPHIE'S CHOICE and OUT OF AFRICA, but was also stereotyped as
an "accent of the month" technician without an audience-friendly
personality.  Then, with films like POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE, DEFENDING
YOUR LIFE and DEATH BECOMES HER, she showed a completely new and
extremely appealing gift for comedy.  Now Streep has gotten serious
again, but this time in the context of an action-suspense thriller.
THE RIVER WILD gives Streep the chance to flex new muscles (literally
and artistically), and while she continues to be one of the most
talented actors alive, she is failed here by a script which is
thoroughly by-the-numbers.</P>
<P>     Streep plays Gail, a Boston woman in the midst of marital
difficulties.  When her workaholic husband Tom (David Strathairn) bails
out on a river rafting trip for son Roarke's (Joseph Mazzello)
birthday, Gail, Roarke and the family dog head for the high country
anyway.  Tom surprises her by joining them at the last minute, but
tensions run high.  They run even higher when they happen upon Wade
(Kevin Bacon) and Terry (John C. Reilly), two inexperienced rafters who
have lost their guide.  Gail, a veteran of the river, offers to help
them make it down, but it soon becomes clear that Wade and Terry plan
to go farther than Gail wants to take them, and that she and her family
have no choice but to go along.</P>
<P>     There is something to be said simply for the opportunity to watch
Meryl Streep perform.  At times during THE RIVER WILD, her talent
explodes through the film's surface like one of the Class V rapids Gail
must navigate.  In one phenomenal scene, Gail leans in close to Wade to
explain in a vicious whisper that she simply isn't capable of
navigating "The Gauntlet," a series of rapids which lies ahead.  She
manages to convey not only her anger at Wade for threatening her
family, but a subtle seduction in the attempt to convince him and a
genuine frustration that she isn't good enough to make this journey
even if she wanted to.  It was because of scenes like that that my
attention never completely wandered as long as Streep was on the
screen, and she is almost always on the screen.</P>
<P>     The problem is that most of the elements surrounding her aren't
one-tenth as interesting.  Denis O'Neil's script goes exactly where you
expect it to go exactly when you expect it to go there, a story any
movie of the week could come up with.  A scene between Streep and David
Strathairn in which they discuss their marital problems brought up
elements of Gail's personality which can be found nowhere in the
script, leaving Streep to flesh out this "demanding" streak on her
own.  Strathairn is solid, but has little to do; Kevin Bacon has a lot
to do, and does most of it poorly.  He's too stupid and not crazy
enough when he needs to be most threatening, and there's not all that
much conflict involved when the only thing the villain has over the
protagonists is a gun.  Director Curtis Hanson directs in a workmanlike
manner, trotting out such suspense film standbys as the old "pet leaps
out to the accompaniment of a blast of music" trick.  It frequently
seems as though he sees the family conflict storyline as something in
the way, something to be pushed through to get to the rafting
sequences.</P>
<P>     To be fair, those sequences are exciting.  Cinematographer Robert
Elswit's camera swoops and dives, and there is a genuine sense of
danger.  The location scenery is also magnificent, filmed on rivers in
Oregon and Montana, and helps fill in many of the dead spots.  But THE
RIVER WILD is too often THE RIVER MILD, a mediocre melodrama gifted
with the presence of one great actor.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 rapids:  5.</PRE>
