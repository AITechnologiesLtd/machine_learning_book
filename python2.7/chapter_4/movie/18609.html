<P>        In order to avoid spoiling the film, I can say almost nothing about the
twisted story behind Alejandro Amenabar's Open Your Eyes, a
psychological thriller unlike any I've ever seen.  The film is a
convoluted and fast-paced journey into the nightmare-like madness of a
Spanish man (Eduardo Noriega).  With each twist of the plot, the film
becomes increasingly interesting and profound.  The performances are
wonderful, with a standout presence from Noriega.  But what really makes
Open Your Eyes a unique experience is Amenabar's attitude towards his
film:  he avoids pretensions and overwrought preaching, and goes
straight for philosophical depth.  Open Your Eyes could have been a
ludicrously confusing film, but instead turns out to be an unforgettable
and intense expedition into the world of dreams.  </P>
