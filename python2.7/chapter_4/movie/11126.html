<PRE>                                
                        THE REAL BLONDE</PRE>
<P>There are several things that make THE REAL BLONDE such a delight to
watch.    There's the sexy, fun story and realistic dialogue, both by
Tom Dicillo,  the fine acting by the entire cast which consists of
some great names even in the smaller roles.   Take Kathleen Turner
as a powerful casting agent such as is found in the real world of TV
and movies.   There is Marlo Thomas as a top notch photographer who
knows how to make a picture tell a story that is not true.  And
there is Buck Henry as a psychiatrist who would love to bed his
patients.  And Christopher Lloyd who runs a catering service that
employs actors between gigs or those who have yet to get their first
break,   Finally, Denis Leary as a women's self-defense instructor
who tries to come on to the women who have personal problems. Wrap
all that together by a fine director and you have one very
entertaining film.</P>
<P> The story and all the characters ring true.   Joe (Matthew Madine)
and his live-in lover Mary (Catherine Keener) appear to be about at
the end of their relationship.   While Mary is a make-up artist for
TV and movies,  Joe is still waiting for his first job,    His only
income is as a waiter. Obsessed with never accepting a minor part in
a film as it would be too demeaning for someone who is as good as he
thinks he is, he is always out of work, always shooting off his
mouth and blowing his chances of ever getting  cast.   Mary has just
about had it with him even if they are in love.</P>
<P> Bob (Maxwell Caulfield) is Joe's  friend and fellow-actor (and
waiter!).  His problem is he wants to find a real blonde, someone
who does not get her hair dyed; a natural.   To this end he runs
after every blonde he imagines will fill the bill.   What he really
wants is a woman whom he can love.    Among those he chases are
Kelly (Daryl Hannah in a superb performance) and Sahara (Bridgette
Wilson) who is seen as the perfect body on huge billboards.   Is he
happy?   Not at all.</P>
<P> Joe finally settles for a role as an extra with a hundred other men
in a Madonna video.  He has to play up to casting director Dee Dee
Taylor (Kathleen Turner) in order to get the role.  When Joe meets
up with Tina, (Elizabeth Berkley) who is a Madonna double, his
morality suffers as he takes her to bed.   So much for HIS ethics.</P>
<P> One would hope that despite the film being released so early in the
year, that come Oscar voting time in 1999, Matthew Modine and Daryl
Hannah  will be remembered.</P>
<P> The movie runs along rapidly as we get to know all the characters
and meet those on their periphery who have a bearing on the story
and on their lives.   That there is not a dull moment in the film is
a tribute to the fine direction..</P>
