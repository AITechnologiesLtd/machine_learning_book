<P>Director Henry Jaglom is proof-positive you can sustain a filmmaking career
without ever having a hit. How many among us have sat through such Jaglom
masterworks as "Venice/Venice," "Eating" or the ever-popular "Babyfever"?
Anyone? Anyone?
 That's because Jaglom is the king of the "talking head" movies, most of
which proceed as follows: A group of sophisticates (or pseudo-sophisticates)
gather in a house, pour some drinks and exchange story after story about
their tragic (or semi-tragic) lives. The actors are encouraged to improvise.
The camera drifts slowly from one solemn face to another as the audience
either drifts off to sleep or drifts toward the lobby.
 There's a dose of that in "Deja Vu," Jaglom's latest effort, but this time
out he was lucky enough to get Vanessa Redgrave to participate in the
discussion. Unsurprisingly, everything she says is well worth listening to,
even though her role as an aging jet-setter is peripheral to the main
storyline about how American fashion buyer Dana Howard (Victoria Foyt, who
co-wrote the screenplay with Jaglom) slowly realizes married British painter
Sean Elias (Stephen Dillane of "Welcome To Sarajevo") is her romantic
destiny.
 From their first meeting on the legendary white cliffs of Dover, both Dana
and Sean have the unshakable feeling they've met before -- thus, the film's
title. But the course of true love never runs smoothly, and it turns out
Dana is engaged and Sean already married. Of course, when Sean's wife starts
pushing the "let's have a baby" button and Dana's fiance runs her planned
"Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers evening" by getting stoned, it becomes
rather obvious what's coming next.
 Though stretches of "Deja Vu" get bogged down in pointless talk, much of it
obviously made up as the camera rolled, the movie is otherwise about as
close to the mainstream as Jaglom as ever likely to get. There's a neat
framing device involving Dana's encounter with a mystery woman, a charming
Dillane performance, music by Lena Horne and Vera Lynn, and, of course, the
sensational Redgrave, who puts some needed zing into the movie's second
half.
 On the other hand, Foyt's characterization runs hot and cold, to the point
where it's tough to tell if Dana is merely wrestling with a divided heart or
struggling with undiagnosed manic depression. Take her if you must, Sean,
but don't forget to fill that lithium prescription before taking off for
paradise.
