<P>YO BOB GOES TO THE MOVIES<HR>∏ (Pi): ****<HR></P>
<P>This week’s question: What are the limits of knowledge, and why?</P>
<P>It’s been said that knowing the nature of your fear reduces its power.  
Conversely, then, the less you understand about what frightens you, the more 
frightened you are.  And accordingly, if what you’re trying to do is frighten 
someone, you should reveal as little information as possible.</P>
<P>Hitchcock knew this when he made _Psycho_, but he blew it in the last two 
minutes of the film by allowing the psychiatrist to explain Mother Bates’ 
motivations.  Spielberg knew it when he made _Jaws_, but don’t tell me there 
wasn’t a letdown after the shark finally appeared.  </P>
<P>These two master directors understood the mechanics of fear, but they were 
operating within the classic, Aristotelian parameters of a story: beginning, 
middle, end.  Frighten the audience out of their wits, yes, but don’t send them 
home without a resolution.</P>
<P>Now, however, in a popular culture that is increasingly hyperkinetic, jaded, 
self-referential, fragmented, paranoid and cynical, it is not only possible but 
advisable to dispense with the old model of entertainment.  Why bother with a 
resolution when your audience won’t stop flipping channels?</P>
<P>No one understands this better than Chris Carter, the man behind TV’s hugely 
popular and widely imitated “The X-Files”.  Ask even the most hardcore fans of 
the show what it’s all about or where it’s going, and you’ll get an evasive 
answer at best.  The series has been humming along for years now, and while 
Mulder and Scully continue to discover tantalizing bits of information that 
_appear_ to build upon each other, they are really no closer to the truth than 
when they began.  Obviously, if they did arrive at any sort of conclusion, the 
show would lose its power to fascinate.  </P>
<P>So the conspiracy continues, and whether we’re chasing or being chased, it’s 
always just around the corner, always a fleeting shadow.</P>
<P>Enter Darren Aronofsky’s _∏_, a thoroughly postmodern thriller in which nothing 
is resolved but much is suggested.</P>
<P>Max Cohen is a sociophobic recluse obsessed with the meaning of numbers.  We 
learn that he is a mathematical prodigy who graduated college at age 14 and is 
able to multiply and divide large numbers in his head.  He lives alone in a 
triple-bolted apartment with his computer, Euclid, where he searches for 
patterns in the complex math of everyday life: leaves on a tree, the spiral of a 
seashell, the flow of the stock market.  Periodically, he suffers from splitting 
headaches that he fights with handfuls of pills; the headaches stem from an 
incident in his childhood when he stared into the sun and went temporarily 
blind.</P>
<P>_∏_ is the story (if story is the right word) of Max’s pursuit of a mysterious 
216-digit number that everyone wants him to identify.  It would be unfair to say 
what the number represents, but even if I did, it wouldn’t really explain 
anything--just as the number itself, when it is finally discovered, is only a 
string of digits.  What matters, what keeps the audience fascinated, is the 
pursuit--or as Max says, “the spaces between the numbers.”</P>
<P>The film is shot in black and white, establishing a mood of claustrophobic 
surrealism reminiscent of David Lynch’s _Eraserhead_.  Sometimes images are 
sharply defined (a smashed mirror, a power drill, Max’s face in close-up) and 
sometimes edges bleed into each other (the dark beards of Hasidic Jews, the 
stark white columns in a subway).  </P>
<P>As in a dream, we get the feeling sometimes that we’ve been here before, we even 
know what’s about to happen, but there’s nothing we can do to stop it.  And 
because the movie was made in the late ’90s, we are subjected to some graphic, 
disturbing imagery that would have been neither possible nor appropriate in 
Hitchcock’s day.  But if you’ve watched “The X-Files” or seen _There’s Something 
About Mary_, you’re probably more prepared than your parents would be for the 
sight of a human brain being poked with a pencil.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, there are plenty who will walk out of _∏_ feeling disgusted and 
frustrated, asking themselves: Why, why, _why_ was this necessary?  Why the 
graphic violence, why the self-destructive vibe, why the endless search for the 
unattainable?  And there will be those who leave the movie despairing for the 
nihilistic glory of Generation X.</P>
<P>I can’t answer the “why” questions; ask Aronofsky.  The most I can say is that 
while I understand the disgust and frustration, I also understand what it is to 
grow up in a time when the concept of resolution, of answerable questions, is 
itself suspect.  The byword of our times is “information,” the byphrase is “too 
much information,” and I applaud _∏_ for having the courage to consider the 
limits of knowledge. </P>
<PRE>Even in such a fashion.</PRE>
