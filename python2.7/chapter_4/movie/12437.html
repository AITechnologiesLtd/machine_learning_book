<PRE>**As Good As It Gets**
Reviewed by Jeff Walters</PRE>
<P>        Is this movie as good as it gets this year? Well, no - I still
think Titanic and L.A. Confidential have this movie beat,
but damn this is one hell of a good flick. Much like the theme of a
Seinfeld episode this is a movie about nothing. Simply the story of
three people, how they react to each other and make it from one day to
the next.</P>
<P>               Jack Nicholson plays the compulsive
obsessive....er....obessive compulsive romance novelist, Melvin, who
is the 'King of the Put-down'. Let's face it, we all have come across
a Melvin type person in our lives. He's the kind of  person you spend
weeks bitching about after first meeting. That special kind of person
for whom you'd swerve   across four lanes of traffic just to get the
chance to run down. A real nice guy.</P>
<P>       Underneath the crusty exterior though is a kind man who simply
acts the way he does because he lacks the social skills to relate to
99.9% of society. One person in that slim 0.1% catergory who Melvin
finds intruiging is Christine (Helen Hunt) - a waitress in his
favourite local diner. The rest of the staff hates him and the boss
wants him banned, but Christine is able to see beneath the mask and
recognize Melvin for what he is......most of the  time. The third
person in this unlikely trio is gay artist, Simon (played by Greg
Kinear). </P>
<P>        The acting is simply superb. It is a very rare thing when
other actors can keep up with Jack Nicholson in a movie,
 but in my opinion Hunt and Kinear both not only match his pace - but
even exceed him. Nicholson is still brilliant  though, I can't imagine
anyone else playing this role. It's just so him. Greg Kinear, who's
only other major role was in the recent re-make of Sabrina, exhibits
such character as the absolutely down and out artist who can't seem to
get a lucky break. Cuba Gooding Jr. is a lot of fun as Kinear's over
protective agent who makes Melvin cower at the slightest glare. His
effect on Nicholson is truly hilarious - turns the crusty old man into
jello at will.</P>
<P>       It is Hunt, however, who steals the show. A truly staggeringly
engaging performance in creating a character totaly unlike her Mad
About You, Jamie. If she had lost the Best Actress in the Oscars it
would have been an absolute crime. Being a Titanic fanatic (whoa, say
that three times) it's hard for me not to say Kate Winslet should get
it, but Helen Hunt is just too good. In her first real movie role (in
Twister she was buried behind the FX) she just blows  away all comers.
A very talented and passionate person. </P>
<P>               The fourth main star in As Good As It Gets is the
script. The dialogue is original and witty - the jokes are all
thoughtful and clever, not just cheap jibes or obvious come-backs. The
 put-downs written for Melvin are instant classics - each is crafted
to completely deflate it's target. As someone who likes to stick it to
certain people myself - I had to love them ;) Don't think, though,
that this is a pure comedy - it's not. It is a powerful movie, with
moving moments and performances mixed together with a well-scripted
comedy.  Not a movie that's easy to place in any one genre.</P>
<P>       For me - the romance angle between Melvin and Christine doesn't
quitesit right. Nothing I can really put my finger on, but somehow
it's hard to picture the two characters together  romantically. </P>
<P>               Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie - then I
strongly recommend doing so before it is banished to video. It's the
best comedy/drama of the past year and one of the best I've seen
period. </P>
<PRE>5 out of 5 stars</PRE>
