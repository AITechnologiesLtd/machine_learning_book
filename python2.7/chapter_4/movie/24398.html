<P>Two major novelties with this film: 1) The movie presented on the screen is
divided into four equal smaller screens, each showing a different story at
the same time as the others 2) The entire movie was shot in one straight
take of ninety-three minutes, and features general improvisation by the
actors. Certainly the concept of this film is unique, but then again,
director James Toback tried another such cinematic experiment earlier this
year with BLACK AND WHITE, and it sucked the big one. Fortunately for us,
this film is actually able to combine its technological novelty, with solid
acting and quite the interesting, sorted tale of a day in the life
of...Hollywood.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Follow the lives of various Hollywood types during a hectic audition day
with a handful of behind-the-scene situations padded by various relationship
dramas.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This is a film which begins on a visually confusing note, eventually settles
into its own and manages to seduce with its voyeuristic appeal, its talented
cast and its sheer creative spirit. Oh yeah, and if none of that appeals to
you, how about the fact that the film features two different sets of
actresses swapping spit during a couple of the film's groovier scenes (Hayek
and Tripplehorn go at it early, and later on, Burrows and Mann take a shot
at the gold). But lesbianism aside, the movie is cool on various different
levels, all of which transcend the initial shock of the visual, including
some surprising comedy by the way of Julian Sands' overly competent massage
therapist and Richard Edson, playing the neurotic director. Of course, the
basis of the film is soaked in various intertwining relationship dramas, but
it's nice to know that director Figgis doesn't take himself too seriously.
He even features a pitch scene in which a woman presents an idea for a movie
not unlike Figgis' own creation, only to be laughed off by a producer as
"the most pretentious crap I've ever heard".</P>
<P>And despite it taking me a while to get used to the idea of four stories on
the screen at the same time, it wasn't long before the volume controls began
to work wonders, and I gelled right into the movie. Finally, a cinematic
experiment that succeeds! Mind you, I wouldn't want to see movies like this
all the time, honestly you have to pay about four times more attention than
you usually do, but kudos to Figgis for pulling this one out of the hat. Of
course, the film wouldn't have been such a success were it not for the
extremely solid performances of its actors. Improvising most of their lines
from a pre-established structure, all of the actors involved in the
production seemed to take full advantage of their respective carte blanches,
smacking many a ball out of the park. By golly, even Salma Hayek was really
good in this (besides being a Goddess of beauty, of course). Give an award
to Stellan Skarsgard for his amazing portrayal of Alex, the alcoholic
producer, who slowly disintegrates before our very eyes, as well as Jeanne
Tripplehorn, who surprised me with her strong showing. A great cast, a
captivating story about pretentious Hollywood folk dishing their dirty
laundry, a novel idea that works and lesbian make-out scenes. How could you
go wrong? :)</P>
<P>Honestly though, if you think that an experiment as such is in your
interest, you should definitely see this film on the big screen, since it
will more than likely lose many of its subtleties on video. A few moments
drag on here and there, but overall the movie works on all cylinders, and
its running time of ninety-three minutes is ideal, considering its novel
concept. So if you're not one to allow your mind to stray during a movie
outing, this film is ideally created for you. Visually unique with an
interesting narrative and a solid cast, this film has turned into one of the
year's nicest surprises for me.</P>
