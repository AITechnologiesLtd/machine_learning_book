<PRE>                  THIRTY-TWO SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>    Glenn Gould was one of the most enigmatic performers of all time.
He is arguably the most gifted and certainly the most controversial
pianist ever.  At the height of a brilliant career, he retired from
performing at age 32.  He was the H.  G.  Wells of the Information
Superhighway; he believed in the 60s that electronics would
revolutionize the arts and that there would no longer be a need for
live performances.  Moreover, he felt recordings were more egalitarian
since people were not forced to hear what the performer played as they
would in a live concert.</P>
<P>     The movie of his life (he is played nicely by Colm Feore) is
called THIRTY-TWO SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD.  The bizarre title
comes from a innovative script where his entire life is broken into 32
disconnected vignettes of differing lengths - some lasting only
seconds.</P>
<P>     I learned a lot about Glenn Gould from the movie.  I knew he would
hum while performing his music and that you can hear the humming on the
recordings if you listen carefully.  I did not know that he spent hours
of his time on the phone every day.  He loved to talk and did so
incessantly.  He would call people up at all hours and talk to them
about anything and everything.  He even made a lot of money in an
obscure stock by telling everyone he knew, and he knew many influential
people, that a certain famous sheik was interested in the company.
While the oil market was crashing, his oil stock went up 4 fold
overnight.  He did not listen well, but, boy could he ever talk.</P>
<P>     I applaud the script writer for taking a risk, and I enjoyed
learning about Glenn Gould, nevertheless, I can not quite bring myself
to recommend the movie.  Too many of the scenes just did not carry
enough interest for me.  If you go, you will be treated to some
wonderful music however.  THIRTY-TWO SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD runs
about right at 1:33.  It is not rated, but would probably be PG, but I
think only teenagers and older would be interested in it.  I rate it
**.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
