<P>PLOT:
A bumbling criminal has to do "one more job" before he can kiss his life in
the Bad Guys Corp. goodbye. When he tells his girlfriend about his
unenviable position (do or die), she tells him to take a hike, and he must
then complete his mission in Mexico alone. Unfortunately, he goofs up a lot
so the bad guys kidnap his now ex-girlfriend, to put more pressure on our
boy to perform. Got all that?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A so-so movie that could've been a lot better if they hadn't taken such a
good thing and beaten it to death. First of all, how bad can any movie
starring Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts be, right? I mean, c'mon...seriously! I
could watch these two planting seeds for two hours and still come out with a
pretty decent-sized smile on my face. But I suppose that has more to do with
their inherent good looks and zesty personalities than anything else, so
obsessions aside, let me get back to the story. To be honest, I was actually
quite surprised by this movie, since the trailers have been making it look
like a very light, fluffy romantic comedy starring the two sweethearts of
Hollywood, but the reality of the film is actually quite grimmer. In fact,
the movie's stocked with profanities, contains scenes of violence and offers
plenty of frank conversations about that little thing called "love", from
both the hetero and homo perspectives. Basically...my kind of movie!!
Hehehe. Unfortunately for the audience, the film just doesn't know when to
let up and just goes on and on and on. I honestly thought that it was over
two and a half hours long, but it was really only two bucks or so, I
believe. What that tells me is that the film sorta "lost me" at some point
around the midway mark, and even though the movie still managed to get some
laughs from me here and there, it ultimately just ran out of gas (no pun
intended).</P>
<P>In fact, the first half of the film comes out a-blazin' with a very nifty
soundtrack, an infectious score, plenty of laughs via Pitt's adventures in
the land of Me-hico, and some decent tete-a-tetes between Roberts and
Pittski. And yeah, the directing was also top-notch. But once they split,
the two stories seemed to take different emotional routes and kept me
somewhat off-guard. In fact, I wasn't all that interested in the Roberts end
of the story as much as Pitt's end for the most part, and didn't
particularly see reason to get so much into Gandolfini's background either
(we find out more about him than the two leads together!). It was as if they
didn't want him to simply play this "thug" again, and they tried to develop
his character somewhat, but it was all too much, for this type of movie. I
would've preferred that the film stuck to its original fast-pace, hardy
chuckles and fun-time chemistry. But the length of the movie and the second
half's more "serious" tone, ultimately left me entertained, but not as much
as I anticipated early on (one specific somber event felt particularly out
of place). In fact, note to all filmmakers who decide to slap two very hot,
pretty stars together for another movie in the future...uhmm, give them more
scenes together, dammit!! That's what I'm paying my umpteen pesos for,
buddy, I want to see Julia and Brad interact!! Granted, the story also has
to be very good, but if you've got the stars to sign on the line that is
dotted, why not use them in more scenes together? Just a thought.</P>
<P>In fact, since the film only superficially touches upon their relationship
early on, you don't really feel all that much for the couple as they try to
get back together throughout the movie. But all in all, the film did still
manage to entertain me with its general fun vibe, its charismatic stars, its
somewhat diverting story and upbeat soundtrack. Not a mucho nachos
recommendation but a recommendation nonetheless.</P>
