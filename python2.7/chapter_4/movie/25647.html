<PRE>Gladiator </PRE>
<P>Another Hollywood wannabe epic film made mostly for the sake of wooing Oscar 
voters with its classic
story of eternal love and quest for vengeance. </P>
<P>It's a guy movie and a chick flick at the same time. It has many exciting and 
bloody battle scenes which
service the plot about a Roman war general named Maximus (Russell Crowe) who 
was about to become
the next leader of the great empire until heir-apparent Commodus (Joaquin 
Phoenix) has him removed.
Commodus becomes an arrogant, selfish emperor who uses his power to service 
his own desires instead of
doing what's good for Rome. </P>
<P>At 150 minutes the film is a bit overlong but at least its story is full of 
detail so pay close attention. The basic
plot is familiar and very Shakespearean, but the gladiator life Maximus finds 
himself trapped in is the most
interesting aspect of the film. Not as good as "Spartacus" or "Braveheart" 
but it's a fine effort. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B </PRE>
