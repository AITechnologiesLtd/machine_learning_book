<P>     This is the fifth time I have watched Dark City.  Four times I have
watched it on video rentals, the fifth time I watched it on a DVD, the
format that I've been hearing good things about for several months now.  I
paid $24.99 to buy the DVD, about $10-$15 more than I would have spent on a
videocassette.  As far as format goes, it was worth it.  From frame one,
picture is deeper and sound is clearer.  Well, enough about telling the
world about the Dark City DVD - a vast enhancement over the VHS version -
let's talk about the movie Dark City.</P>
<P>     Dark City is about, well, a dark city.  It is dark on the psychological
level: the world presented in front of you is one of prostitutes, serial
killers, and things that go bump in the night.  It is also dark on the
physical level: no one can remember clearly the last time they saw the light
of day.  As far as the darkness of the film itself: it is a devastatingly
beautiful film noir, filled with all the jazz and mystery that we have come
to expect from the incredibly interesting style of filmmaking.</P>
<P>     Alex Proyas' first cinematic effort since the tragic death of Brandon
Lee on the set of The Crow, this presents us with a radically different
world than the shoot-em-up that The Crow was.  In Dark City, we follow John
Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), a man with scant memories and the ability to Tune,
or alter physical reality with his mind.  Murdoch awakes at midnight in a
city where time seems to stop for several hours.  He is in a hotel room with
a bloody knife and the dead body of a prostitute.  On his trial are a race
of beings called "The Strangers", who also posses this telekinetic ability.
 The Strangers are a dying race that controls Dark City, replacing people's
memories in order to discern what makes a person human.  They are, in their
own way, searching for the soul.</P>
<P>     Murdoch does soul-searching of his own, trying to find who he was, or
was supposed to be.  Desperately trying to evade the psychotic and utterly
terrifying Strangers.  Dr. Daniel Poe Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) is trying
to aid him, trying to help him understand an ability that he can hardly
fathom, while at the same time being forced by the Strangers to help them in
their zoo of humanity.  Emma Murdoch (Jennifer Connelly), his wife, is a
jazz singer utterly convinced that her husband is innocent.  Inspector
Bumstead (William Hurt) is the cop trying to make sense of a crime that
leads to a conspiracy more complex than the JFK assassination.</P>
<P>     Dark City is propelled forward at the speed of a Tokyo bullet train
thanks to one of the most original plots and screenplays in ages, the first
in a pattern of cross-genre works (this one sci-fi, Mystery, and Film Noir)
that had among its newest members the excellent action film The Matrix.  The
ferocious pace displayed in the movie grabs everyone at frame one and keeps
them until the end, and kicks the suspense in with a wonderful score and a
terrific jazz and techno soundtrack.</P>
<P>     It is a foray into the surreal: let you be warned about that.  However,
unlike most ambiguous and surreal movies, such as Lynch's Lost Highway, it
gives you answers in a way that you can understand.  Not only does it give
you answers in an easy to understand format, but it compels you with
characters that you like, that you find unique.  It is careful not to put
you a step ahead or behind Murdoch as he unravels the mystery of Dark City,
as he tries to escape from the bizarre and frightening world that constantly
surrounds him.</P>
<P>     See it, sci-fi fans.  See it, those who liked The Crow.  See it,
friends of mystery and of film noir.  Hell, if your just someone tired of
the same-old, same-old that Hollywood dishes out, see it.  But, any way you
cut it, see this movie.</P>
