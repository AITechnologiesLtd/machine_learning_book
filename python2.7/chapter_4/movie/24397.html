<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>One of the big problems with many movies about changing history is that 
they tend to get bogged down in its mechanics. The difficulty is that our 
modern understanding of time is still incredibly limited, so any such 
discussion will by its very nature come across as a load of gobbledegook.  
Good movies like "Back To The Future" ignore the subject altogether, or 
at most give it a passing acknowledgement. Their makers are aware that 
the fun thing about time isn't how it works, but how it can be used in a 
dramatic context. "Frequency" is such a film, and it proves to be one of
the most entertaining movies of the year so far.</P>
<P>John Sullivan (James Caviezel) is a cop in 1999 New York. He has just 
broken up with his girlfriend, drinks a little too much, and is all too 
aware that it's almost the thirtieth anniversary of the death of his 
father. Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) was a firefighter who perished in 
1969 rescuing a transient from a warehouse fire. One night, John happens 
upon his dad's old ham radio, mothballed since Frank's demise. For old 
times' sake, he switches it on.</P>
<P>A lot of things were happening in New York around the time of Frank's 
death. The "Amazing" Mets were on their way to winning the World Series 
against the Baltimore Orioles. A serial killer murdered four nurses 
before vanishing without a trace. And the aurora borealis -- the Northern 
Lights -- was making a rare week-long appearance in the skies above the 
city.</P>
<P>In 1999, the Northern Lights have returned to New York for the first time 
in three decades. By some freak accident of nature, this allows John to 
speak to Frank in 1969 via the ham radio. John manages to convince his 
father that he really is communicating from the future by predicting 
events of the Mets/Orioles World Series, and gives him enough information 
about the warehouse fire to save his life. But this changes the whole 
pattern of history, and not all for the good. Somehow, Frank's survival 
has meant that the so-called Nightingale Killer's death toll was ten 
instead of four -- and one of the "new" victims was John's mother 
Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell). Frank and John must cooperate across the 
years to stop the murderer in time.</P>
<P>"Frequency" is not a particularly deep movie. In a way it's about the 
relationship between fathers and sons, and how profoundly the absence of 
the former can affect the latter. And of course it deals with the 
familiar science-fiction notion of how changing one seemingly innocuous 
event can have major ramifications on things long after.</P>
<P>But, in the end, the real point of "Frequency" is just to tell a good 
story, and in this it excels. There are a lot of great scenes in which 
Frank and John's altering of history is explored, not on a 
pseudoscientific level but on a purely visceral one. The movie doesn't 
try to justify its temporal mechanics (indeed, there are some 
inconsistencies in how Frank's actions ripple down to his son), but just 
taps into our sense of the fantastic.</P>
<P>For example, at one point Frank communicates with John by burning a 
message into his desk. John sees the letters appear one by one and 
touches them, expecting to find them hot. But of course they're not, 
because they were made thirty years earlier. Later, Frank acquires a 
wallet with the murderer's fingerprints on it, but can't go to the police 
in 1969 because they'd never believe his story. So he hides the wallet 
beneath a loose floorboard, where John retrieves it in 1999. "Wow," 
breathes Frank, and he is speaking as much for the audience as for 
himself. While these sorts of things are nothing new to the genre, rarely 
have they been done so well and with such enthusiasm. And there are a 
couple of particularly imaginative sequences, especially a visually 
awesome one at the movie's climax.</P>
<P>The only real downside to "Frequency" is that the serial killer storyline 
which dominates its second half is rather pedestrian. This is not to say 
that it's badly done -- it's intriguing enough in its own way -- but it 
just doesn't live up to the wonder which permeates the rest of the movie. 
Scenes like one where Frank is arrested for being the Nightingale killer 
seem commonplace, for instance, and the proceedings generally feel as 
though they've been lifted out of an uncommonly bizarre episode of "Law 
And Order".</P>
<P>But even this is energised by excellent performances from Caviezel and 
particularly Quaid. "Frequency" lives or dies on the conviction of their 
father/son relationship, made more challenging by the fact that their 
communications aren't face-to-face. But both actors are up to the task, 
bringing genuine emotion to the story. As a result, it's easy to suspend 
our disbelief and buy into the movie, and it's hard to suppress a cheer 
when Frank survives the fire, or when father and son team up to stop the 
killer.</P>
<P>Director Gregory Hoblit does a good job, especially in keeping the
frequent and potentially dull scenes of Frank and John talking on the 
radio alive and interesting. Also, he wisely chooses not to overplay the 
changes father and son have wrought on the present. Although some 
differences are highlighted, many others are left as subtle background 
detail. Like "Back To The Future", this gives the film a richness it 
would otherwise be lacking.</P>
<P>"Frequency" has a broad appeal that's rare in movies today. It's a 
science-fiction movie where the characters come first, where visual 
effects take a backseat to story and acting, but which is exciting and 
suspenseful nonetheless. "Frequency" probably won't win any Academy 
Awards, but it was one of the most enjoyable cinematic experiences I've 
had in a long time. And, in the end, I can't ask for much more than that.</P>
