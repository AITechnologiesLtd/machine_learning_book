<PRE>                                 SCREAM
                       A film review by Adam Joyce
                        Copyright 1997 Adam Joyce</PRE>
<P>Scream is a film for all fans of the horror genre. Directed by Wes Craven,
well known for writing and directing the first of the Nightmare on Elm
Street movies (and signing away the rights to the sequels in the process),
the film is an analysis of horror movies within a horror movie.</P>
<P>The film opens with the death of Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore), a young
female, home alone, who lives away from the city. De ja vu? She is
terrorised by an anonymous caller (who just happens to have a deep and
scary voice) who asks her questions about famous horror films, and demands
that she answer them correctly or her boyfriend, who's tied up on the
patio, will die. Eventually both her boyfriend and Casey are killed. Her
death involves the typical chase through the house, lock all the doors
scenario. From here the film jumps to the local high school, where the
students discover the news about their friends. I'm sure you've heard it
all before, but that's the idea.</P>
<P>Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is the next victim of the killer's terror
campaign. Throughout the film the characters discuss the ridiculous aspects
within horror films. Sidney talks to the killer on the phone (not aware of
who he is) about how stupid it is that the people in horror films run up
the stairs instead of out the front door, but once she is the victim, she
does the same herself. In this respect the film is somewhat funny, and it's
meant to be, it's a parody of real horror flicks.</P>
<P>Sidney survives the ordeal, and her boyfriend is taken into custody over
the matter. As the film develops almost every character comes under
suspicion of being the killer, and one has to notice the intricate details
within the film to have any idea of who the killer could really be. Gate
Weathers (Courteney Cox), a tabloid reporter, also becomes involved.
Sidney's mother was killed and raped one year previous to the time in which
the film is set, and Gate Weathers claims that the wrong man is in jail for
the crime. Hmmmm.....I wonder who could be the real killer of Sidney's
mother? Could it by any chance be the current killer in town? Probably,
because this film is all about horror stereotypes, and you have to know
them well to solve the mystery. One by one the characters are killed off,
and in the process so are the suspects.</P>
<P>Scream is a clever thriller/horror/comedy about horror movies. If you're a
horror film fan than you might pick up on the special touches, such as the
school cleaner wearing a red and white striped t-shirt (like Freddy
Krueger's). The film used a record amount of blood, and there is plenty of
gore to keep the audience screaming (and at times, purposely, laughing).
The film's characters even explore the rules for surviving horror films,
for example, characters must be innocent virgins or they die. You can also
watch as the characters break these rules, and then sometime later on,
suffer the consequences. The film plays on the stereotypes of other horror
films, i.e. the seemingly dead killer must come back to life for a final
battle.</P>
<P>The characters are portrayed suitably, in the style of all good horror
films. Scream itself is enjoyable, allowing the audience to both jump and
to laugh. If you're familiar with horror films, and especially if you're a
fan, then Scream is worth your time. </P>
<PRE>Can you work out who the killer is?</PRE>
<PRE>4 out of 5</PRE>
