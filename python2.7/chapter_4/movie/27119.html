<P>   When someone I know comes back from a vacation, I feel
duty-bound to ask the obvious question: "How was it?"  Don't
you?  How many times did you get the reply, "Just awful...I
can't wait to get back to work."  I don't think I ever did.  More
likely: "Great...fabulous...it was beautiful...coulda stayed
another month."  We all know, though, that holidays away
from home can be hell one earth.  Enforced togetherness. 
Screaming kids.  Hot cars.  Delayed flights.  "I don't have
your reservation and we're full up, sir."  Rain every day.  In
Dominik Moll's scary Hitchcockian thriller "With a friend like
Harry..." we meet a couple who didn't need any help from
Harry to have a perfectly miserable time.  The picture opens
on Michel Laurent Lucas), on his way by car with wife and
kids to visit his parents and to fix up his summer home.  The
smallest of the three daughters is crying all the way because
of the heat, the middle kid had a lollipop that fell on the floor
and she screams for another, and a third demands loudly to
take a ride on a swing.  Michel's wife Claire (Mathilde
Seigner) is overly warm and frustrated while Michel, faced by
the taunts and shrieks of four women, is probably thinking
he'd rather be back in Paris at his job teaching French to
Japanese residents.</P>
<P>   Just when things seem unable to worsen, Michel meets
Harry (Sergi Lopez) in the men's room of a service station. 
He doesn't recognize the man as having been in Michel's
high-school class, but the 34-year-old Harry, who is travleing
with his bimbo girl friend Plum (Sophie Guillemin), not only
recalls Michel but can even recite his classmate's poem
which was printed in the school literary magazine.  Harry's a
charmer, all right, but Michel--like us in the audience- senses
something's not quite right about him.  From the earliest
moment, just before Harry re-introduces himself to Michel as
both are washing their hands, he stands silently before him
for half a minute or so with a sinister grin on his face.  </P>
<P>   In Dominik Moll's two-hour long  thriller, one
which almost veers into the territory of slasher movies but
wisely remains rooted in some malevolent reality, Michel and
his wife Claire at first welcome the new company, particularly
when Harry offers to drive them to their dilapidated summer
place in his new air-conditioned Mercedes.  But when the
super-rich, carefree title character--who is single, no kids, and
no need to work--buys Michel and Claire a new sports utility
vehicle--they are both astounded and becoming mighty
suspicious.</P>
<P>   They say that serial killer Ted Bundy got his many female
victims to trust him by being as charming as a fairy-tale
prince--not exactly a psycho of the Hannibal Lecter variety
but rather one who had his feet seemingly planted on the
earth but his infirm mind in some hellish place known only to
him.  If you want to know about Bundy, you can read the
newspaper articles about him, but if you want to get
emotionally in touch with the type of sicko he was, see "With
a Friend Like Harry."  Moll has given us a black comedy with
superior performances from the entire ensemble, which
features Sophie Guillemin as the pleasure-loving girl friend
who is at first admired by all but later considered a pea-
brained cow by the host.  Sergi Lopez, known to cineastes for
his role in the sometimes puzzling "An Affair of Love," plays
the role like a fairly normal, albeit incredibly generous, guest,
until gradually he goes off the deep end--the logical extension
of his philosophy that "if you don't like something [a car, a
parent, a girl friend, a screaming kid], simply get rid of it."</P>
<P>   Not that the eerie, suspenseful movie really requires it, but
David Sinclair Whitaker's music takes us appropriately from
the nicely-nicely portion of Harry's behavior into a steadily
more sinister beat, with the picture several times invoking the
voice of Dolores del Rio in her authentic version of
"Ramona."  Matthieu Poirot-Delpech's camera raises the
excitement ante regularly as Harry's Mercedes and later his
SUV speed along a dark, backwater road while Dominik
Moll's direction puts us into the mind of the burned out
parents with no moment to themselves and the psycho
millionaire who has all too much time on his hands.</P>
