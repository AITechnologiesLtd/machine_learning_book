<P>Wayne's World
Chad'z rating: ***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)
1992, PG-13, 95 minutes [1 hour, 35 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Mike Meyers (Wayne Campbell), Dana Carvey (Garth Algar), Tia
Carrere (Cassandra), Rob Lowe (Benjamin Oliver), written by Mike Meyers,
Bonnie and Terry Turner, produced by Lorne Michaels, directed by Penelope
Spheeris.</P>
<P>        "Wayne's World" is probably one of the most intelligent and creative
comedies I've ever seen, which is quite an accomplishment considering how
unintelligent the premise is. In short, this movie shouldn't be as good as it
is.</P>
<P>        The story revolves around Wayne Campbell (Meyers) and Garth Algar (Carvey),
two guys who are really quite enigmatic. They're late 20-something
"headbangers" who act like teenagers. They have their own cable access show
"Wayne's World," but both still live with their parents. Maybe this premise
seems a little cartoonish, even the first gag involves a vacuum placed on
Garth's head as a hair cutting device. It doesn't seem like it should be
funny, but Meyers and Carvey's improv is what makes the humor work. It's not
sight gags and slapstick (a la "Pee Wee Herman"), nor is it wisecracks and
one-liners, it's just a vivid establishment of an offbeat atmosphere.</P>
<P>        And it's that offbeat atmosphere is what makes the film great. The mood
constantly changes from straight comedy to offbeat satire, but it stays in
synch, much like John Hughes' great 80s comedies. For example, when Garth is
pushed around by a bully at a metal club, he goes back to his car and
retrieves a tazer while the theme to "Mission: Impossible" plays. Meanwhile,
when Wayne sees Cassandra (Carrere), a sexy, rockin' singer, the camera
remains on her while "Dream Weaver" plays.</P>
<P>        Since this is a commercial comedy there must be a plot to it. Rob Lowe
co-stars as Benjamin Oliver, a typical, smooth-talking television producer
who wants to buy "Wayne's World" and sell it to a sponsor, thus making it
completely commercial and highly profitable. Most of the first two acts
revolve around this plot, and although it does seem a little formulated, it
doesn't become the driving force of every little event.</P>
<P>        In fact, there isn't much direction to this film as a whole. It constantly
skips around from setting to setting: sometimes Wayne and Garth are partying
at the rock club; sometimes Wayne is wooing Cassandra; sometimes Benjamin is
plotting something sinister, and all yet they are all connected.</P>
<P>        By the final act, everything is going wrong for Wayne. He has been conned
out of, and then fired from his own show. He also loses Cassandra when he
suspects Benjamin of seducing her with opportunity. You know everything will
be resolved in the end, but the actual ending sequence is completely original
as it follows the cliches in a satirical manner.</P>
<P>        From start to finish "Wayne's World" is a great, funny parody. The jokes
always connect and never recycle themselves. The fact so much happens in this
film (and so little as a whole) without a trace of burnout is quite amazing. </P>
