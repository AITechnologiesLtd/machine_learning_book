<P>     ALCHEMY is steeped in shades of BLUE.  Kieslowski's BLUE, that is.  
With its examination of death, isolation, character restoration, and 
recovery from loss, Suzanne Myers' new independent film echoes the 
Polish director's internationally-acclaimed 1993 release.  Language 
aside, the principal difference between the films is that, while 
Kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character's world, 
ALCHEMY keeps its viewers at arm's length.  As a result, while we're 
able to appreciate the film's intellectual tapestry, it is emotionally 
distant.</P>
<P>     ALCHEMY is divided into three chapters:  "Charity", "Faith", and 
"Hope".  While there are common themes and story elements running 
through all three, the single constant is the main character, a 
sculptor/Russian translator named Louisa (Rya Kihlstedt).  When the film 
opens, she's living with her painter boyfriend, whom she believes to be 
cheating on her.  Following his sudden death in an automobile accident, 
Louisa's life is thrown into turmoil.  Events swirls around her, and she 
can't find a source of stability.  In her quest to make sense out of her 
loss, she befriends her late boyfriend's mistress, visits her ill 
sister, and, eventually, abandons her old life by joining a "back-to-
nature" cult.</P>
<P>     ALCHEMY successfully explores a variety of compelling issues.  In 
addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with 
the unexpected death of a loved one, it probes beneath the surface of 
concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process, the 
meaning of love, and the nature of art.  Does personality restoration 
come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar?  Are 
artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life, 
with all of its various distractions, to the fullest?  Myers' challenge 
is to make these subjects, art film staples, engrossing in a new 
context.  Through Louisa's struggles, she succeeds.  While ALCHEMY isn't 
always emotionally appealing, it never loses its fascination.  Even when 
we're not connecting with Louisa, who is often more of a locus for ideas 
than a fully-developed personality, there's enough material on-screen to 
hold our attention.</P>
<P>     The cinematography is stunning.  City scenes are tinted with blue, 
adding a cold, bleak dimension to the film's early portions.  Later, 
when Louisa reaches the "wilderness", we're treated to a dazzling array 
of autumnal splendor --  brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the 
ground.  It's a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes 
the changes taking place in Louisa's life as she travels the road back 
to emotional stability.</P>
<P>     The title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith-
healers who use "alchemy" to provide for the needs of the body and soul.  
And, although Louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine, it's 
ultimately love and companionship, not alchemy, that brings solace.  Her 
pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent 
safety of being alone is life's ultimate goal.  Even though Louisa's 
final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she 
been a more vital character, it's still an intriguing and enlightening 
process to watch.  ALCHEMY isn't pure magic, but, especially during its 
best moments, it's close.</P>
