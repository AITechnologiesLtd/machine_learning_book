<PRE>"Squealer."
     - John Goodman to a wart-hog.</PRE>
<PRE>     Forget the critics.  Just go.</PRE>
<P>     If the very first scene--a dusty quarry filled with giant boulders
and earthmoving dinosaurs--doesn't fill you with a giddy gross of riant
recognition, then you're probably in the wrong film.  THE FLINTSTONES
is an immensely enjoyable all-ages attraction that's the first true
treat of the summer.</P>
<P>     Remember Fred (Goodman)?  He's that hearty, blue-collar bloke who
spends his days in a quarry and his nights in an (bowling) alley.  As
the film opens, his day is nearly done and, astride his 'sauris, he's
ready and waiting for the 5 o'clock bird.  Watching from afar is Cliff
Vandercave (MacLachlan), a young exec who's scheming with his secretary
(Berry) to steal funds from the firm.  All Cliff needs to get rich
quick is to find the perfect patsy....</P>
<P>     John Goodman is probably the closest we'll come to a man called
Flintstone.  His enthusiasm is bigger than his shirt size (no small
feat there!) and, though he never gets the accent quite right, he's the
obvious anchor of the film.  But he's not the focus.  THE FLINTSTONES
is an ensemble effort with a barefoot cast that works overtime to be as
obviously appealing as Goodman.</P>
<P>     Elizabeth Perkins is the best of the rest.  She nails her role of
Wilma square on the red-head, right down to her priceless delivery of
the word "Frad!" Less effective are the Rubbles.  Rick Moranis plays
Barney dumber than his cartoon counterpart, but he's still more
believable than Rosie O'Donnell, passable but all wrong as Betty.  Hee
hee hee hee.</P>
<P>     Remaining roles include Elizabeth Taylor, looking good and
sounding great as Fred's mother-in-law, Halle Berry as the seductive
secretary Sharon Stone, and Harvey Korman as the voice of a persnickety
"dict-a-bird."  Living cartoons Jay Leno, Richard Moll, and Jonathan
Winters also make appearances.  And watch for cameos from William Hanna
and Joseph Barbera.</P>
<P>     THE FLINTSTONES isn't as manic as one might expect and you can
blame director Brian Levant for that.  The happy helmer never tries too
many of those Barry Sonnefieldish tricks that made RAISING ARIZONA and
ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES such perfect cartoons.  His camera stays still,
but, with so many gags *already* in the film, any lack of tricky
technique goes by almost unnoticed.</P>
<P>     The writing, done ala "round table" despite three "official"
credits, is great.  Steven Spielrock and Company have unearthed every
stone-age pun possible and then some.  Sample dialogue from Fred:
"There's 4,000 people in the world!  Who needs the Rubbles?"</P>
<P>     The production design is equally rich and boasts more background
gags than a Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker film.  A newspaper reads "All the
news fit to chip."  A drive-in theater shows George Lucas' "Tar Wars."
And, best of all, a stone-age Warhol hangs on the wall at Slate and
Co.</P>
<P>     With so much obvious effort both before and behind the camera, THE
FLINTSTONES is surprisingly clunky.  The climax is rickety and many
other scenes seem shortened.  Were the producers afraid to take a good
thing too far?  Running a mere 92 minutes, THE FLINTSTONES should be
more seamless than it is.</P>
<P>     Since the entire film is a special-effect, some things look better
than others.  The props are all foam, of course, but the dinosaurs are
real--and I mean *real*--and that's what counts in Bedrock.</P>
<P>     The music, by David Newman, incorporates both songs and cues from
the TV show.  "The Twitch," performed by the renamed BC-52's, adds a
Sixties-flavor that isn't needed. (Male-dominated households
notwithstanding.)  How about Jurssaic grunge from Seattlerock?  (Sorry.)</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:    If you like the Flintstones, you'll like THE FLINTSTONES.
                This working-class comedy about a modern stone-age
                family is fine fare for any age.  You'll have a gay, old
                time.</PRE>
