<P>George of the Jungle ˜ Tarzan for Toddlers</P>
<P>George of the Jungle might have tickled my funny bone when I was a wee   
lad.  His place is forever etched deep in my memory, lying somewhere   
where Curious George and Amelia Bedelia also roam.  After all, who can   
forget that unforgettable upbeat jungle song which ended with the words:   
Watch out for that tree!  I couldn't stop laughing, but my parents could   
never quite appreciate the slapstick silliness.</P>
<P>For better or worse, that quality hasn't changed.  An animated opening   
recounts how George, as a baby, wound up in the Buvuku jungle, in the   
heart of Africa.  He is befriended and raised by an assortment of   
animals, including Ape, who is a scholarly, talking gorilla;   
Tookie-Tookie, a toucan; and Shep, an elephant.  George (Brendan Fraser)   
grows up to be the guardian and self-proclaimed king of the jungle.  Yet   
despite his physical prowess, when it comes to vine-swinging, he is   
navigationally challenged.  You'll hear more than a few disconcerting   
"thuds" in this movie.</P>
<P>We are also introduced to Ursula (Leslie Mann), a sweet but meek   
socialite who is rethinking her engagement to the snooty Lyle Van de   
Groot (Thomas Haden Church) while exploring the lush Buvuku.  During her   
expedition, she is threatened by a lion.  George saves her and takes her   
back to his treehouse.  The result is a slowly developing love story   
between the city girl and the jungle boy.  But mostly, this is a movie   
that incorporates dozens of slapstick moments.  For example, we see   
George receiving sex education from a gorilla.  We watch Lyle try in vain   
to outwit George.  We see two bumbling poachers try to kidnap (apenap?)   
Ape so that they can cash in on this talking phenomenon.  And we see   
George, who has been taken back to America by Ursula, try to adapt to his   
modern surroundings.   One especially funny scene involves George   
watching a TV commercial that equates falling with love with having lots   
and lots of coffee.  Mistaking this as a weapon of woo, George   
immediately and voraciously munches on all the coffee that he can find in   
the house.  The caffeine buzz makes him hyper, and he runs out into the   
streets of his concrete jungle, where more silliness ensues.</P>
<P>Yet, while the movie does have it's funny moments, it became obvious to   
me that I had outgrown the silliness and the shenanigans of George and   
his jungle pals.  Yes, I have become my parents.  It should be noted,   
however, that Fraser is physically agile, boyishly appealing and brings   
good comic timing to the role.  And, to Disney's credit, all of the   
children in the theatre were laughing and enjoying the jokes and the   
humor of it all.  However, while the portions were just right for the   
young ones, adults will find this fare not very filling.  </P>
