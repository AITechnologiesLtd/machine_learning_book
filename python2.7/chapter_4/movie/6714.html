<P>     More music video than musical, EVITA is a rock opera that doesn't
rock.  Three, maybe four songs crackle with the kind of energy that
threatens to send the audience into the aisles dancing.  The rest of the
songs-- all of which sound canned, another problem-- are slower, softer,
and often sleep-inducing.  Lady Madonna is picture-perfect and, at 
times, vocally impressive as the died-young-after-sleeping-her-way-to-
the-top Argentinean First Lady.  Rarely does she sing with the gusto,
though, that wandering narrator Antonio Banderas does; he has a set of
pipes that you won't believe!  The other singer/star is Jonathan Pryce
(CARRINGTON) and he barely registers as Juan Peron, partially due to his
having the least-interesting singing voice.  (And where are the profound
basses?  Andrew Lloyd Weber's score sorely lacks a bruising bottom-end.)
EVITA isn't exactly a fun movie to watch, nor is it particularly power-
ful.  Director Alan Parker (THE COMMITTMENTS, MISSISSIPPI BURNING), who
also co-wrote the script with Oliver Stone, provides, at best, bombastic
sketches of a certain someone's life.  Little to nothing is revealed
about Eva Peron's character, but, oh, doesn't she look pretty and sing
well?  </P>
