<P>Susan Granger's review of "ANTZ" (DreamWorks: SKG)</P>
<P> "Antz" is only the second fully computer-animated feature
ever to be produced; "Toy Story" was the first. And the clever imagery
of "Antz" is awesome! The entire film is presented from an ant's
prospective. The story revolves around a neurotic worker ant (Woody
Allen) who as "the middle child in a family of five million" suffers
from feelings of insignificance. "But you are insignificant," his
therapist tells him. Nevertheless, he falls in love with a beautiful
princess (Sharon Stone) who asks him to dance in a bar one night when
she sneaks away from the Queen (Anne Bancroft) and flaunts the social
caste system. Eager to see her again, he enlists the help of his best
friend, a soldier ant (Sylvester Stallone), and - thanks to an amazing
twist of fate - foils her fiance, the ambitious, maniacal General
Mandible (Gene Hackman), and his military henchman (Christopher
Walken) who secretly plan to destroy the ant colony. En route to
becoming a hero, he builds a philosophical revolution and social
rebellion on the final words of a fallen comrade: "Don't follow orders
all your life!"  The intelligent screenplay by Todd Alcott, Chris
Weitz and Paul Weitz revolves around an individual asserting himself
against overwhelming conformity, a theme that will probably be too
adult for very young children in the audience. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Antz" is an amusing, inventive 8.  Like "Deep
Impact" and "Armageddon," which had the same meteor-careening
towards-earth concept, "Antz" and "A Bug's Life," due for release in a
few weeks, share the same insect-oriented story line. Which will
emerge with the bigger box-office gross? Who knows?</P>
