<P>     FLIGHT OF THE INNOCENT is director Carlo Calei's feature debut,
and if certain elements of the movie have a familiar feel, it's no
accident.  Mr. Calei is an unabashed admirer of American filmmakers
such as Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, and he has made use of
several of those mens' cinematic techniques to enrich his own movie.</P>
<P>     The "innocent" of the title is Vito (Manuel Colao), the ten year
old son of a family of criminals.  When there's a falling out with some
"associates" over the kidnapping and murder of a millionaire's son, a
massacre ensues in which every member of Vito's family is killed.  The
boy's quickness and intelligence are the only things that save him.
But the killer (Federico Pacifici) knows about Vito, and when he learns
that the child is headed for Rome, the chase is on.  During a journey
that is as much a moral trek as a physical one, Vito must confront the
deeds of his family and attempt to make what little recompense he can -
all while his own chance of survival becomes dimmer by the moment.</P>
<P>     The same kind of pulse-pounding excitement evident in one of
1993's most popular American thrillers, THE FUGITIVE, can be found in
FLIGHT OF THE INNOCENT.  Except during several character-building
sequences (most of which work surprisingly well--many of the players
in this story, especially Vito, have depth and breadth), this film is
driven by adrenaline, and whenever the action slows for a while, you
can be sure that another fast-paced scene is just around the corner.
The result is a mostly-linear story that passes at an amazing rate.</P>
<P>     Mr. Calei borrows many of his most stunning visual images from
Martin Scorsese, including a "blood flower" that depicts beauty in the
midst of gut-wrenching horror.  The "boy's view" camera angles (from
Spielberg) are utilized exceptionally well--enough to be interesting,
but not enough to overexpose the viewer to the technique.</P>
<P>     Sounds, like sights, are on the director's pallet.  Footfalls,
breathing, gunshots, lightning--these all come across with startling
clarity, complimenting the visuals and emphasizing the tension.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the last third of FLIGHT OF THE INNOCENT suffers
from script-related problems that dampen the strength of the climax and
conclusion.  Plot contrivances conspire to stretch the credulity of the
audience.  On one occasion, Vito suddenly acts in an atypical (and
almost inexplicable) manner that seems designed to move the story in a
certain direction.</P>
<P>     The "child in danger" premise can, if handled properly, produce a
tautly- effective thriller.  Barring a few flaws, director Carlo Calei
has done so with FLIGHT OF THE INNOCENT.  The viewpoint here is that of
a boy whose guilt is by blood, not deed, and we are given an
opportunity to witness an added dimension to the genre:  this blameless
child's inner battle with remorse even as he flees for his life.</P>
