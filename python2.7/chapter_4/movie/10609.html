<P>Richard Gere's outspoken disapproval for Red China is the main motivation
behind RED CORNER, but making a bad movie to portray "bad" government is a bad
idea all around. Regardless of personal political convictions, it can be
assured that this film has potential to be marked "cruel and unusual
punishment" by many. If you're lucky, you'll have a choice between this film
and a good caning. I'm still split on that one.</P>
<P>Gere plays American businessman Jack Moore, the man responsible for handling
the overseas syndication of American television. In Beijing on a business
trip, Jack finds it hard to sell the Chinese media officials on western
entertainment, especially when the officials view such programming as
"pornographic, violent, and superstitious". Unable to convince them otherwise,
Jack spends the evening letting loose at a fashion show where he hooks up with
an artistic model and takes her back to his hotel room. Things take a
(melo)dramatic turn when Jack's awakened the next morning by Chinese police,
blood all over his clothes, and his one-night stand lying dead on the floor.</P>
<P>What develops (or under-develops) is a "one-man stands alone" routine as Jack
finds himself without help from the American Embassy or the assigned defense
attorney, who also happens to be convinced of her client's guilt. The attorney
is Shen Yuelin, played by the only commendable actor/actress in the film, Bai
Ling. Shen refuses to allow a guilty plea, explaining to Jack, who refuses to
comply with the plea, that there is "severity for those resist, leniency for
those who confess". This has become a tag line for the film, but trust me,
when it comes to seeing this film, resist, resist, resist!</P>
<P>In time, Jack begins to plant doubts in Shen's mind, and eventually, she
repeals the guilty plea and begins helping Jack search for evidence to prove
his innocence. All they know is the victim is the daughter of an influential
general, and whether this has anything to do with the case is hidden in
ambiguity (hmmmm, I wonder!), but the more they seem to discover, the more
thugs emerge from the shadows to "quiet" them. It's not a suspenseful film as
much as it strives to be. In fact, it's quite on the boring side. Gere has
always struck me as a very plain actor, and this film is just a showcase of
all that is mundane in film-making. He's just too unaffected by all the events
taking place around him, whether they be in his favor or not. We never even
get to know Jack before he's thrown into a jail cell and put on trial, so our
interest in his welfare is never achieved. As stated, Ling is the only thing
about this film that doesn't deserve a full-blown thumbs down. </P>
<P>It's hard to say much about RED CORNER when it's such a bland production.
Courtroom dramas usually have a bit of depth to them as discoveries are made
and the clock ticks down. In RED CORNER, some crucial bits of information are
discovered, but the ending is sickeningly convenient and disappointing.
Regardless of events occurring in the first 115 minutes, the end result,
founded on sheer luck, would've been the same. That means all the developments
we sit through are there for nothing more than filling time. "You will be shot
in a week, and the cost of the bullet will be billed to your family," Yuelin
tells Jack at one point. Hey, I'll do ya one better: "You will be forced to
watch RED CORNER, and the cost of the ticket will be billed to your family".</P>
<PRE>Ouch that's cruel!</PRE>
