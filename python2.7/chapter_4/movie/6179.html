<P>     Robert DeNiro.  Dustin Hoffman.  Brad Pitt.  Jason Patric.  Kevin 
Bacon.  Minnie Driver.  With a talented cast like this, it's virtually 
impossible to envision a bad movie, and, in that regard, SLEEPERS 
doesn't surprise or disappoint.  This is easily Barry Levinson's best 
effort of the decade, and it helps to erase the bad taste left by his 
early-'90s mega-flops TOYS and JIMMY HOLLYWOOD.  Despite protests from 
the Catholic Church (which whines about any movie that portrays priests 
as anything less-than-pure), SLEEPERS, which represents two and one-half 
hours of gripping entertainment, is well worth the price of admission.</P>
<P>     The movie is about revenge and redemption, and how, in America's 
darkest social corridors and backalleys, the two can be inextricably 
linked.  It's also a condemnation of a criminal justice system that 
allows innocence to be callously destroyed.  Yet, even though SLEEPERS 
is basically a vigilante motion picture, it exists on a much higher 
plane than something like DEATH WISH, which offers a least common 
denominator, visceral satisfaction.  There's little thrill in watching 
the vengeance extracted by the protagonists of this film because 
SLEEPERS approaches its subject with a conscience.  The movie's moral 
compass is Robert DeNiro's Father Bobby, a Catholic priest who 
recognizes that friendship and loyalty can require sacrifices of the 
soul, but who doesn't tread lightly across the line separating what's 
legally correct from what's ethically mandated.</P>
<P>     In fact, Father Bobby's dilemma is arguably the most compelling 
aspect of SLEEPERS' second half.  The film's sluggish final hour is its 
weakest portion, but there's still enough there to maintain audience 
interest.  We've spent a long time with these characters, and we're not 
about to abandon them because Levinson doesn't move things as smoothly 
to the climax as we might prefer.</P>
<P>     SLEEPERS, which may or may not be based on a true story (the author 
of the novel, Lorenzo  Carcaterra, isn't doing interviews these days), 
spans fifteen years.  Much of the action transpires in New York's Hell's 
Kitchen, which stretches from 34th to 56th Street west of 8th Avenue to 
the Hudson River.  During the film's era, the neighborhood was ruled by 
two vastly different powers:  the mob (represented by  gangster King 
Benny, played by Vittorio Gassman) and the Catholic Church (represented 
by Father Bobby).  Every child learned to respect both, and live by a 
simple creed:  never commit a crime against someone else in the 
neighborhood.  Such offenses were not permitted; the people of Hell's 
Kitchen looked after one another.</P>
<P>     The film opens in 1966 by introducing us to four inseparable 
friends:  Lorenzo (Joseph Perrino), Michael (Brad Renfro), John 
(Geoffrey Wigdor), and Tommy (Jonathan Tucker).  Like most boys, they're 
curious about sex, enjoy playing stickball, and have an appetite for 
pranks.  One such practical joke, gone horribly wrong, changes their 
lives.  When their theft of a hot dog vendor's cart nearly causes a 
man's death, Lorenzo and his friends are found guilty of reckless 
endangerment and sent to the Wilkinson Reform School.  There, under the 
watchful eye of a sadistic guard named Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon), they 
are subjected to mental, physical, and sexual abuse.</P>
<P>     Although their sentences are only for a year, those twelve months 
fundamentally alter their personalities.  When we next meet them, in 
1981, their lives have moved on, but the submerged hatred lingers.  
Lorenzo (now played by Jason Patric) is an aspiring reporter working for 
the New York Daily News.  Michael (Brad Pitt) is an attorney in the 
D.A.'s office.  John (Ron Eldard) and Tommy (Billy Crudup) are hardened 
criminals.  All four are forced to confront their shared past when John 
and Tommy encounter Nokes in a restaurant.  Their actions provide the 
catalyst for a plan that Michael devises to bring the entire Wilkinson 
experience into the open.  So, with the help of Lorenzo; John's lover, 
Carol (Minnie Driver); and a burned-out lawyer (Dustin Hoffman), Michael 
strives to attain redemption and revenge for them all.  </P>
<P>     SLEEPERS' provocative script is marred only by an unnecessarily 
verbose voiceover narrative and the protracted final third.  One of the 
most fascinating aspects of the movie is watching how the law can be 
manipulated to deliver justice in a manner that was never intended.  
And, while Michael's scheme may be a little too convoluted to be 
plausible, it's nevertheless entertaining to watch the pieces fall into 
place.  </P>
<P>     Then there's Father Bobby's dilemma, which, in some ways, echoes 
the one agonized over by the protagonist of Antonia Bird's PRIEST.  At 
what point do the demands of basic humanity take precedence over the 
oaths and responsibilities of the Cloth?  Much of this struggle is not 
played out in words, but in Bobby's face, and, with an actor of lesser 
ability than DeNiro, the emotional resonance of the internal war could 
have been lost.</P>
<P>     DeNiro isn't the only one to turn in a powerful performance.  
SLEEPERS is as well-acted as it is deftly-crafted.  There are those who 
may be disconcerted by the intensity of the reform school scenes 
(nothing overly graphic is shown, but much is implied).  Levinson takes 
us through every phase of the boys' torture so that, when the time 
comes, we can understand and sympathize with their need to emulate the 
hero of their favorite book, THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, and exact 
decisive retribution.  </P>
<P>     As SLEEPERS opens in theaters, members of the media are trying to 
determine how much of this film is grounded in reality.  Ultimately, 
however, it doesn't make much difference whether the events of SLEEPERS 
happened or not.  The themes and messages are no less valid either way, 
and, even if it isn't a true story, events like these could have 
transpired.  Fact or fiction, this is a memorable motion picture.</P>
