<P>The Happy Bastard's Quick Movie Review</P>
<PRE>Hudson Hawk</PRE>
<P>What could easily be the biggest blemish in Bruce Willis' movie career
(next to The Bonfire of the Vanities and, well, most of his flicks in
general), Hudson Hawk is a loopy little flick that, taken in the wrong
context, is one of the worst movies ever made.  If you rent Hudson Hawk
and expect a serious, dynamo action flick in the sense of Die Hard, you
will be extremely let down.  However, if you watch it with a
happy-go-lucky, could-give-a-damn-less attitude, like I usually do with
movies (they're made for fun anyway), you might actually have a goofy
old time.</P>
<P>Willis plays the Hawk, a slick burglar just getting out of jail after
serving some time for a botched job.  Immediately following his release,
he and his partner Tommy Two Tone (Danny Aiello) land back in trouble
with a mob led by the Mario brothers (Nintendo players may have figured
that one out already).  But the theft has unfolded a bigger conspiracy
involving a power-hungry couple and several henchmen named after candy
bars- not to mention a former CIA man leading them (played hilariously
by James Coburn).  It turns out a greater power awaits if Hawk can steal
the right parts- the ability to create gold ala an old machine created
by Leonardo Da Vinci.</P>
<P>Somewhere in this story, there's also a love interest for Hawk- a nun
(played by Andie McDowell) who actually works for a sort of Vatican
secret service (please don't ask).  This leads up to a rather romantic
request by Hawk later in the movie: "Will you play Nintendo with me?"
(Yes, I'm kidding).</P>
<P>The movie is by no means a classic, as the story is so botched and
filled with in-jokes that it couldn't even be considered seriously for a
second.  But it almost plays out like a Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker film,
with plenty of intended (and somewhat unintended) laughs galore.  Willis
is pretty good as the smarmy Hawk, even if he is glorifying just a tad.
Aiello and McDowell turn in decent performances, and Sandra Bernhard is
a hoot as the power-hungry wife, complete with shifting attitude and
face gesturing.</P>
<P>And some of the action is pretty likable as well.  Take, for instance,
the scene in the hotel with the botched firing of a bomb launcher.  Or,
perhaps, Hawk's battle with a butler who carefully unsheathes knives
from his sleeves like a pro.  Like I said, though, take it pretty much
with a grain of salt or you'll be sorry.</P>
<P>Again, not classic material, and not up to everybody's taste in terms
of, well, everything, but Hudson Hawk is a lot of fun if you simply
allow it to be.  If it's real gusto you're looking for, turn to Die
Hard.  If it's all-out goofiness you want, Hudson Hawk will suit you for
a one-evening rental.</P>
