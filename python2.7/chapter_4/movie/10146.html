<PRE>                               SPAWN 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                  2 :-( :-(  for the bad smell of Spawn</PRE>
<P>Cast: Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Martin Sheen, Nicol Williamson,
D. B. Sweeney, Theresa Randle, Melinda Clarke Director: Mark A.Z. Dippe
Screenplay: Alan McElroy based on the comic book by Todd McFarlane</P>
<PRE>Confusion.</PRE>
<P>Satan's first choice to be the General of Hell's armies is a good guy
assassin who gets murdered. He sells his soul to Satan to see his wife
again and gets resurrected as "Spawn" the ultimate fighting machine
from Hell. All of a sudden, Spawn (Michael Jai White) decides he doesn't
want to be a bad guy after all and starts beating the crap out of all
the other bad guys. Wait a minute - didn't he just sell his soul to
Satan a moment ago? Fickle, fickle, fickle.</P>
<PRE>Mass Confusion.</PRE>
<P>Satan's plans are entrusted to an old fart known as 'Clown' (John
Leguizzamo). The general whiff of things is to nuke the world with
biological weapons before Hell's armies invade. Clown's elaborate scheme
is to get an evil entrepreneur 'Wynn' (Martin Sheen) to murder Spawn;
put a pace maker in the heart of Wynn that will trigger the biological
bombs if he dies; then resurrect Spawn to murder Wynn thus ending the
world. A simple analogy to this is - buy a cat to murder a rat; then
resurrect the rat and make it bionic. Encourage the rat to murder the
cat with a specially implanted time bomb that will destroy the entire
cat population so the dogs from hell can take over. Now all we need is a
hat and we've got Dr Seuss.</P>
<PRE>Mayhem.</PRE>
<P>The final battle in hell - Satan does nothing but holler and scream -
even I can do that. Clown is bigger and badder than Spawn, yet is
overlooked for the position of General of Hell's armies. Why bother with
silly little piffy bombs, just invade earth and get it over with - from
the look of things there are a lot of baddies down there. What does God
have to say about all of this? Why is Spawn called Spawn? Is there any
relevance to breeding? If so shouldn't there be a good guy of equivalent
power representing the good side, someone perhaps called 'Sperm'? Sperm
and Spawn the Heroes from Heaven and Hell carries a ring to it.</P>
<PRE>In Summation.</PRE>
<P>I hope the comic makes better sense that this movie - cause Spawn sure
smells like a carton of rotten eggs. The only thing that fascinated me
about the entire movie was my fixation with Spawn's crimson red, flowing
cloak. Now if someone can tell me where I can my hands on one of these,
and don't tell me Hell cause I have no intention of going there.</P>
