                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>McHale's Navy (1997) **1/2 out of ***** - Cast: Tom Arnold, Dean Stockwell,
Tim Curry, Bruce Campbell, Ernest Borgnine, David Alan Grier, French
Stewart, Debra Messing, Tommy Chong. Written By: Peter Crabbe. Directed By:
Brian Spicer. Running Time: 108 minutes.</P>
<P>Darn it all, I like Tom Arnold. While I agree that he's much better as a
supporting character ("True Lies", "Nine Months"), unlike the rest of
America I think he can be a competent lead as well ("Big Bully", "The
Stupids"). He stars as Quinton McHale in "McHale's Navy", and while it's
certainly not great, it's not all the bad either. Most of the time, it's
just frustrating.</P>
<P>"McHale's Navy" is the latest Hollywood remake of classic TV show. McHale is
retired from the navy and spends his days in the Carribbean, trying to
concoct any scheme possible to make money. On the flip side, he also coaches
a little league baseball team. His old crew, your stereotypical bunch of
losers and misfits (honestly, how do people like this even make it INTO the
military?) suddenly find themselves with a new commanding officer
(Stockwell), who is your stereotypical uptight, by-the-book, always looking
to get ahead in any way possible military authority.</P>
<P>Elsewhere in those islands, terrorists (led by a too silly Tim Curry) are
hatching some sort of evil scheme to rule the world. Curry's character is
constantly referred to as the second most deadly terrorist in the world,
making you think that maybe the world's MOST deadly terrorist may show up
soon, but alas, he doesn't. Everything is standard from that point on.</P>
<P>Two things keep this film from being good. First is the basic plot. Why does
this need to be yet another slightly comical world domination story? The
original series lasted for years with plots I'm sure were more like "A
private misplaces McHale's laundry." Just a simple story with some good
laughs would have been just fine. Second is the script. At times the script
was so frustrating that I wanted to just pummel the writer. The movie's
flowing along, light-hearted, breezy, ready for comedy. One or two jokes
blow by, which were amusing, and then we get smacked in the face with some
absolutely absurd sightgag or situation that is so mindnumbingly UNFUNNY
that we forget the mild amusement from seconds before. Notice that both of
these problems are the fault of the writing, not of the actors.</P>
<P>The supporting cast, for the most part, fares well. Stockwell for some
reason seems to be doing an impression of Johnny Carson's Art Fern
character, which may be how the character talked in the TV series, but it
seems out of place here considering the character he plays. Tommy Chong, in
a very brief role, is ok, but I've been hearing him in interviews blasting
former comedy partner Cheech Marin for "selling out". Well what do you call
your role here Mr. Chong? Most puzzling though is Bruce Campbell. Clearly
he's the most talented man in the cast as every scene he's in is just a bit
better than the others. But he's eighth or ninth billing and given
absolutely nothing to do. When will someone realize that Bruce Campbell is a
very interesting actor with a distinctive personality which sets him apart
from just any regular actor? Either Campbell is completely happy with
working only bit parts in small movies, he has the worst agent in the world,
or he's unbelievably difficult to work with.</P>
<P>"McHale's Navy" had potential, but it just took itself too seriously. If it
had just had a simple plot without the silly villain or overbearing
commanding officer, it may have been much better. I still like Tom Arnold,
and this film's lack of success is certainly not his fault. [PG]</P>
