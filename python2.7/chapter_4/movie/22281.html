<P>     In ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, Oliver Stone may have found the ideal subject
for his unique brand of cinematic storytelling. Following the ups and
downs of a fictional professional football team (the Miami Sharks) in a
fictional professional football league (the AFFA), Stone dives into the
trenches during the game sequences. Players taunt and strut as they try to
win the game psychologically; an inexperienced quarterback sees the field
only as a blur of colors, and hears only a blur of cacophanous sound.
Coaches send in the X's and O's, but it's the kinetic fury of what goes on
in the huddle and at the line of scrimmage that comes alive. Meet Oliver
Stone, practitioner of smash-mouth film-making.</P>
<P>     If ANY GIVEN SUNDAY had stayed on the field, focused on the intensity
of games, it might have been a classic sports movie. Stone, however, has
bigger issues on his mind -- as he inevitably, agonizingly always seems
to. The film follows several individuals in the Sharks organization as
they cope with the changing nature of the game. Long-time coach Tony
D'Amato (Al Pacino) is hearing the jeers that his conservative approach is
old news. New team owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) is trying to
be taken seriously, and not just as the daughter of the late former
owner. Veteran quarterback "Cap" Rooney (Dennis Quaid) is struggling with
whether his battered body can stand up to more punishment after a back
injury. And Cap's replacement, third-stringer Willie Beamen (Jamie
Foxx) is finding his sudden success intoxicating, as well as poisonous to
his relationships with teammates and his girlfriend (Lela Rochon).</P>
<P>     Stone wants to cover all of this and more, to create as comprehensive
a picture of modern professional football as he can cram into nearly three
hours. He wants to address the rise of sports media as an infotaintment
monster (personified by John C. McGinley as Jack Rose, an abrasive
broadcaster more than faintly similar to Jim Rome). He wants to expose the
yes-men and oh-yes-women who inflate athletes' egos so they can ride the
gravy train. And he wants to juxtapose the fighting spirit of the players
with the owners who use them and throw them away. He wants to do all this
despite the fact that he has too much ground to cover to give any of his
themes more than a superficial gloss. Stone stages confrontations without
context, counting on the shock value of a player's wife belting her 
husband in the fact to make up for its absence of meaning. It's not enough
in 1999 to intone breathlessly that pro sports is corrupted and 
corrupting. You must be prepared to tell a human story that feels human.</P>
<P>     Oliver Stone, however, is all about intoning breathlessly these days. 
He's a director who just can't help underlining everything he puts on
screen so the themes are tattooed on our foreheads. When a character
refers to Vince Lombardi and Johnny Unitas, Stone cuts away to shots of
Vince Lombardi and Johnny Unitas. When someone describes football players
as gladiators, a T.V. will be showing BEN-HUR in the background. When
characters are feuding, there are shots of gathering storm clouds. Any
time ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is focused on the lives of its characters off the
field, you keep hoping for an opportunity to discover something real about
them. Stone, unfortunately, keeps steamrolling forward with split-second
edits and changes in film stock, never offering a viewer the chance to
contemplate what the story is about. Stone's message: It's about exactly
what I'm gonna tell you it's about, and I'm gonna tell you over and over
and over again.</P>
<P>     All this is true, yet there are still those masterful game sequences. 
For Stone, the '90s have been all about experimentations in multimedia
assault. ANY GIVEN SUNDAY takes a game that feels almost languid in its
pacing on television and shows us the cranked-up energy of all the
participants. Coaches make frantic sideline adjustments, and players look
for an opponent's slightest giveaway of his intentions. Stone even does a
brilliant job of splicing in the events in the owner's box, where
oblivious partying and business talk shut the game out almost entirely.
>From the you-are-there field level camera work to the twists on
predictable sports movie heroics, Stone plants you inside the game. And
that's the only time he shows much interest in getting inside anything.
ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is Stone's grandiose attempt to make football a metaphor
for all of human existence, when he could have settled for a perfectly
splendid film about football as a metaphor for football.</P>
