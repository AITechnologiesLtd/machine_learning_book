                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>Amnesia and a murder mystery?  Isn't this usually the kind of thing that
hackneyed thrillers are made of -- stuff like Unforgettable, so bad you
had to scrape it off your shoe the minute you left the theater?</P>
<P>Usually it is.  But Memento proves that a skilled director, writer, and
cast can take even the most tired of formulas -- the man with the lost
memory -- and spin it into something so refreshingly different and new
that I don't hesitate to call it one of the best films I've ever seen.</P>
<P>As the picture opens, we are presented with the face of Leonard (L.A.
Confidential's Guy Pearce in a daring yet comfortable performance), a
tormented man on an unexplained quest of vengeance.  And he's got it: In
the first scene he is pulling the trigger to blow open the head of a guy
named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano).  Soon the facts rise to the surface: 
Leonard was searching for the man who killed his wife, and Teddy was the
prime suspect.  Only there's a twist:  Due to a head injury, Leonard has
no short-term memory and cannot create any new ones -- his mind is stuck
on the day his wife was killed.</P>
<P>To deal with this, Leonard has generated an intricate replacement for
his mind.  For immediate needs, he snaps Polaroids of people and places,
jotting notes on the back.  For long-term goals, he has messages to
himself tattooed on his body (for example: "Find him and kill him").</P>
<P>Heavy stuff.  Leonard's problem is so unfathomable and complex it is a
constant struggle for him just to get through daily life -- much less if
you're thigh-deep in a revenge scheme.  All of a sudden -- pop -- here's
Leonard, on the run through a trailer park.  But is he chasing that guy,
or is that guy chasing him?  It's deliciously complicated and so
circular that it's fun.</P>
<P>But wait, there's more!  Soon enough we find that the whole film is
presented in reverse (not backwards -- the scenes are reordered from end
to beginning).  While the movie begins with the death of Teddy, it
traces back through time as we learn how we arrived at that point. 
Think Betrayal meets The Fugitive.</P>
<P>In other words, we know how the movie ends, but not how it begins.  And
thanks to Leonard's condition, the audience knows what's happening
(well, sort of), but his character doesn't.  Eventually it becomes clear
that Leonard is an unwitting patsy being used at the hands of those even
more nefarious than himself.</P>
<P>It's deeper than you can make a gimmick like this sound -- and to be
honest, it is just a gimmick -- but it's a gimmick that works.  The
movie, written and directed by Christopher Nolan (and based on his
brother's short story) is vibrant and harrowing, unpredictable despite
an ending long since given away.  Unfathomably, the film gets
progressively better as it goes along, and I found myself inching closer
and closer to the edge of my seat throughout the movie.</P>
<P>It's difficult to put Memento's staggering festival raves out of mind,
but this is the genuine article, I assure you.  Those niggling questions
-- Would the movie work if it wasn't told in reverse?  If Leonard can't
remember anything since his accident, how does he know he has the
condition at all? -- only serve to make the story that much more twisty,
and I mean that in the best possible way.</P>
<P>Ultimately, Memento stands on its own as a thriller, but it also works
as a profound tragedy, stunning in its portrayal of a man teetering on
the edge, though he doesn't even know it.  It asks some serious
questions about how we know what to believe, since our senses and our
memory all lie to us.</P>
<P>And in the end, Memento gives us our answer:  We simply believe what we
choose to.</P>
