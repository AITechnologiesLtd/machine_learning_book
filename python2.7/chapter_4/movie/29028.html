<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>This was the last of the Chan series put out by Twentieth Century Fox. The
poverty row studio Monogram Pictures picked the series up for the remaining
episodes and the quality diminished. </P>
<P>The Manderley castle is set in the isolated Mojave desert, where the historian
scholar and recluse, Paul Manderley (Dumbrille), who covers half of his face
because of a scar, lives with his wife Lucy (Lane). </P>
<P>When one of the castle guests, Prof. Gleason (Littlefield), is offered a drink
of wine by Lucy, who is related to the famous Borgia accused of being a
poisoner, he suddenly falls dead. The family physician, Dr. Retling (Geray) says
he was poisoned. The ill-tempered Manderley is upset that this will bring about
unwelcome attention to his family name and one of the conditions of keeping this
vast estate, is that there should be no scandal. His lawyer, Walter Hartford
(MacDonald), suggests they cover-up the death as a heart attack. </P>
<P>Charlie Chan (Toler) receives a letter from Lucy inviting him to come alone to
the castle, because she fears for her life. When he arrives, she tells him that
she never sent the letter. But when Charlie tries to leave, the car distributor
is stolen and Charlie is marooned with the other guests in the 16th century
castle that has no telephone or modern conveniences. </P>
<P>The other guests are the famous sculptor Watson King (Daniell); the medieval
historian Carl Detheridge (Derr); Brenda Hartford (Whalen), the attractive wife
of Walter. There are also three intruders: Jimmy Chan (Yung) comes to warn pop
he received a threatening letter; a fortune teller who follows the stars, Mme.
Saturnia (Griffies), comes with Jimmy to make predictions of who is to die; and,
an intruder, Fletcher (Parsons), posing as a hunter, but his lie is uncovered
and he reveals himself as a private detective. Fletcher will also supposedly die
when drinking a glass of wine Lucy gives him. </P>
<P>The film has many plot twists and the usual Chan setup for the mystery story to
unfold. But the story is far-fetched and tries too hard to be mysterious, which
causes it to falter in credibility. But the desert atmosphere of the
16th-century castle, the usual comic antics of number two son, and all the
suspects moving cautiously around the dark corners of the castle, should please
Charlie Chan fans and give them their usual thrills. </P>
<P>My favorite film quote is from Charlie Chan: " Man who fears death, dies a
thousand times." </P>
