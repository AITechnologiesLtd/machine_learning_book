<PRE>HALLOWEEN: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS (1995)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
August 7th, 2001</PRE>
<P>It has been over twenty years since the original "Halloween" film which spawned
several terrible imitators and endless sequels. The Michael Myers character in
the first film was shrouded in mystery since we didn't know what his motivation
was or why he chose to revisit his hometown of Haddonfield where he killed his
sister. Michael was unspeakably evil - an inhuman monster walking at a snail's
pace and seemingly indestructible. The John Carpenter original remains a
classic, scary, imaginative, low-budget independent film with a great, heroic
role by a very young Jamie Lee Curtis. After "Halloween II," however, the series
became repetitive and unnecessarily gory - a never-ending spectacle for
witnessing the numerous methods Michael employed in killing his latest victims.
1995's "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" is so awful that it defies
description and also wants to offer explanations for Michael's behavior -
questions better left unanswered. </P>
<P>The opening scene is promising. A young woman carries her baby outside of a dank
hospital and drives away in rainy weather. She stops at an empty bus station. A
shadow appears and a white mask emerges from the shadow. It's of course Michael
with a big, glinting knife! Oh, well, it seemed promising. The woman in this
opening sequence is Michael Myers' niece from the last two "Halloween" pictures,
but who cares? </P>
<P>Michael goes back to Haddonfield since the Halloween season is around the corner
again. A dysfunctional family has the misfortune of living at the former Myers
house where Michael killed his sister. Wait a minute. If the house was boarded
up and considered haunted by the townsfolk, why would anyone want to renovate it
and resell it? Haven't these people heard of Amityville before? The plot
thickens. If you are one of two people who has seen "Halloween 5," you'll recall
the mysterious character with a black cloak and hat who rescues Michael from
prison in the ludicrous finale. That mysterious stranger (no doubt, a homage to
the Shadow) is back, and apparently runs the ominous hospital we see at the
beginning and, get this (*spoilers ahead*), Michael Myers works for him! </P>
<P>Paul Rudd ("The Cider House Rules") appears as the little kid whom Laurie
babysitted in the original film. Now he's all grown-up and looks rather creepy.
He claims to know why Michael Myers is indestructible and is aware that Myers'
wrath is about to be set off again, thanks to complex charts that revolve around
the Druids! Poor Donald Pleasance in, sadly, his last role as Dr. Loomis returns
as a man who has retired and is living in isolation. Still, he decides to get
rid of Michael one more time thanks to Mr. Rudd. What for? The monster couldn't
be killed after five sequels so what makes Loomis think he can kill him now. </P>
<P>"Halloween" The Curse of Michael Myers" exists in two versions, one is a
producer's cut that has forty minutes of restored footage, an alternate (and
sillier) ending and new music. It is considered the superior version but all I
can say is that it is as poorly made, amateurishly acted, unscary and
unsuspenseful as the theatrical version. The fact is that this "Curse" should
have ended the franchise for good and ever but no. One more sequel with Jamie
Lee returning surfaced in 1998 not to mention yet another upcoming sequel with
Jamie Lee again! Probably the scariest element of "Curse" is that Donald
Pleasance saw it fit to reprise his Dr. Loomis role. A curse, indeed. </P>
