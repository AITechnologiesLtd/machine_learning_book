"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>When I hear a film start with a woman saying, `Everybody fucks everybody
– it's the nature of the beast,' it usually means I've fallen asleep on
the couch and left Showtime on.  But Whipped isn't your typical 2:00 AM
cable soft-core pornography – it's a new, envelope-pushing sex comedy
playing at your local gigaplex.</P>
<P>Whipped takes place in New York City, where a group of four men meet in
a diner each Sunday to loudly discuss their sexual activity from the
previous week.  There's a Wall Street hunk who is so blonde and so
handsome, he's almost Craig Kilborne (Brian Van Holt, television's Love
& Money), a chronic masturbator who feels bad because he's only had nine
sexual partners (Jonathan Abrahams in his film debut), a married man who
finds himself outcast from his sexually active group of friends (Judah
Domke, Spanking the Monkey), and an unemployed beatnik writer (Zorie
Barber in his film debut – he's also an executive producer).</P>
<P>Each guy brazenly brags about his recent sexual conquests, and more
importantly, the sleazy means at which he `scammed' each woman.  I guess
it's a step up from using date-rape drugs, like in Loser, but it still
doesn't make an entertaining film.  I thought the film was headed toward
a storyline like the superior The Tao of Steve, but instead it gets
stuck spinning its wheels in a pool of vulgarities that have no purpose
other that shocking the audience.</P>
<P>Whipped initially earned an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, and since the
film has no sex scenes, you should have a pretty good idea of how
explicit the sexual dialogue can get.  These guys don't just fuck and
tell – they do it in the most graphic way you can imagine.  And exactly
what crowded diner have you been to where shouting about having your
salad tossed or your knob polished is acceptable?</P>
<P>The film is broken up over a seven-week period, and in week two, each
single guy unknowingly falls for the same girl.  Their diner talk is
more subdued as they sheepishly say things like, No, man – this one was
different.'  Mia (Amanda Peet, The Whole Nine Yards) supposedly has no
idea that the men are best friends, but each is so smitten with her,
they refuse to give her up.  Jealously and hormones rage, but Whipped
becomes bogged down with contrived voice-overs make the film choppy and
annoying</P>
<P>So what is Mia's story?  You know she's playing them from the film's
opening line, so the main questions become `why' and `to what end.'  Is
she a grad student writing a paper on the dating and sexual habits of
the American male?  Nope.  And while the payoff is slightly amusing,
it's still a huge letdown.</P>
<P>Whipped is the directorial debut of Peter M. Cohen, who also wrote the
film's script.  After Peet (who is dating Van Holt in real life) stole
the show from Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry in Yards, I figured Whipped
would be her big breakout role.  But the release date kept getting
pushed further and further back, which always makes me skeptical.
Although she gets top billing in the film, Peet has less screen time
than each of the four main male characters.  She's still an up-and-comer
with a bright future, but Whipped is something that may have been better
off if it was left off her resume.</P>
<P>1:40 - R for strong sexual content and even stronger adult language</P>
