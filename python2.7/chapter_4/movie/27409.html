<PRE>Merging "Traffic" Ahead
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>"Traffic" is a kaleidoscopic look at the famous War on
Drugs.  Melancholy in tone, the film presents a
scathing indictment about America's inability to
adequately counter the proliferation of narcotics and
its woeful aftermath.  From the most affluent,
civic-minded members of our society to the most
reprehensible base, this multi-layered story looks at
how the influence of the drug trade destroys or
corrupts all that it touches.</P>
<P>The most poignant and ironic among the interwoven
storylines is that of federal judge Robert Wakefield
(Michael Douglas) who has just been appointed to be
the newest drug czar.  He's passionate about his job
and genuine in his desire to curb the smuggling
operation of the Mexican cartels.  He meets important
people (various Senators make cameo appearances) and
takes a trip to the El Paso Drug Enforcement
Administration Headquarters to closely examine
government interdiction strategies.  Yet, while he
believes that his trip to the Mexican border puts him
on the front line, he practically never realizes that
the problem has already hit tellingly close to home. 
This suggests that America is losing the war, and this
theme rears itself constantly in all of the scenarios
presented.</P>
<P>It's not just America that has to contend with the
drug problem.  Even Mexican officials take great
interest in it.  However, with the high level of
corruption within the government, it's not necessarily
clear whether these officials are trying to squelch
the supply of drugs or are trying to monopolize it. 
In its most complex storyline, Tijuana cop Javier
Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) must tread carefully
after he is recruited by an army general to help
squash one of the cartels.  He soon learns, though,
that he is in a battlefield where it's never clear who
his enemies or his allies are.</P>
<P>A third storyline is more conventional, but no less
biting about the futility of stemming narcotics
trafficking.  Two DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis
Guzman) catch a drug mob underling (Miguel Ferrer)
whom they turn to testify against his powerful boss. 
The snitch banters philosophically that the agents'
efforts will only be a waste of taxpayers money while
competing cartels will only become more powerful.  As
with the other two scenarios, it's all very solemn
stuff as the good guys struggle to fight a war in
which hope seems to be constantly smothered by the
effects of the white powder.</P>
<P>"Traffic" boasts strong performances by the ensemble
all-star cast (especially Del Toro).  It also benefits
from a directional style that helps to make this
otherwise complex story easy to follow.  Of note is
the use of its visualizations that help to
differentiate the stories currently happening
onscreen.  The Mexican world, for example, is somewhat
blurry and is shot using pale yellows to bring out the
squalor of that environment while the Washington elite
is shot with regal colors and is in focus to denote a
world of protocol and order.  However, be warned if
your goal is to find entertainment.  This is an
issue-driven film with a pronounced documentary feel. 
It might even seem like some revved up program that
you might see on The Learning Channel.  Therefore,
while many of the scenes will be intense enough to
capture your interest, the film's lack of drama may
turn you away.  But no matter what you eventually
think, the material will undoubtedly raise a few
eyebrows.</P>
