<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        We all see a lot of romantic comedies.  Studios love to release them
because people go and see them regardless of the fact that they are
almost always completely predictable.  And, naturally, this addition to
the genre doesn't break that particular tradition.  What Kissing a Fool
(what does the title mean?) does do, however, is provide a bunch of
likable and realistic characters in a situation that, miraculously,
doesn't feel banal and lifeless.  </P>
<P>        The story centers around Max (David Schwimmer) and Jay (Jason Lee), who
are best friends.  Jay is a writer, and Max is a well-known
sportscaster.  Jay introduces Max to his editor, Sam (Mili Avital), and
the two hit it off immediately.  They are engaged within a fortnight,
and soon they move in with each other.  But it can't be that simple: 
Max suspects that Sam might cheat on him, so he tries to get Jay to see
if she will.  How Max expected the details of this operation to ensue is
still under question.</P>
<P>        Boy, it just sounds like your typical, insipid romantic comedy, right? 
Well, yeah, the plot kind of works that way.  However, due to the great
characters and acting, I didn't even notice the gears of the plot
turning slowly-but-surely to provide for the foreseen conclusion.  The
film is totally hilarious, which doesn't hurt; it also manages to avoid
a lapse in laughter towards the end as the plot has to sum itself
up--everything up through the last frame is fun and entertaining.</P>
<P>        However, my biggest reason for liking Kissing a Fool requires for me to
once again officially disagree with Roger Ebert and one particularly
untrue statement he makes in his review of the film.  He says, "...none
of the characters behaves at any moment like any human being we have
ever met."  I guess me explaining the lack of truth in this statement
forces me to admit that my primary reasons for enjoying Kissing a Fool
are somewhat personal.  The character Jay, played by Jason Lee, is me! 
I suppose that it's very presumptuous and perhaps even arrogant of
myself to say such a thing (I know myself *really* well...?). 
Nonetheless, it is true, and almost disturbingly so.</P>
<P>        Lee's portrayal of me...er, Jay, is realistic and extremely
entertaining.  I also enjoyed him in Chasing Amy as the Friend, Banky. 
He is a lot different here (not just in appearance); he actually proves
he can play different kinds of characters.  Jay is really uptight and
ridiculously affected by his surroundings, so it comes as no surprise to
me when he becomes physically ill every time his ex-girlfriend, Natasha
(Vanessa Angel) is even mentioned.  All right, so, maybe not everyone
will like Jay as much as I did . . . but he seems like such a nice,
affable guy!</P>
<P>        David Schwimmer seems intent on breaking Matt Damon's record for number
of times he uses the f-word in a single line of dialogue.  I lost count
in this case, so I'll grant him the award.  I liked Schwimmer here, and
even though his character is the kind of guy I'd like to stab to death
in real life, I enjoyed watching him.  In fact, I know people just like
this, so I could watch and believe everything he does here without
questioning him.  Sam, played well by Avital, is the one character who
could have used a bit of fleshing-out.  She seems rather cardboard-ish
here, mostly because the screenplay doesn't give her a lot to do aside
from react to the two main guys.</P>
<P>        It must be me.  Every situation in this film feels like something that
has either happened to me, or that I've seen happen to someone I know. 
I can't be that different from everyone else--that's why I think someone
out there might watch this movie and say, "Yup, that's how it goes."  I
really enjoyed Kissing a Fool, and I think that if all romantic comedies
were this funny and realistic, we might not have to be so wary of the
genre.</P>
