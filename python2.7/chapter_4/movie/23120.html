<P>"Jaws" it ain't. It may have fearsome sharks chasing some humans around and
certain scenes may bear some relation to scenes from the Spielberg classic,
but "Deep Blue Sea" has neither the interesting characters nor the
engrossing story of that film. It is, however, a pretty good summer flick
that will keep you munching on your popcorn while it serves up everything a
summer monster movie should. It's fun, thrilling, and totally unpredictable.
In the end, unpredictability is what saves "Deep Blue Sea" from being a dull
action movie and turns it into a decently entertaining thriller, one that
will keep the audience on their toes.</P>
<P>Saffron Burrows plays Dr. Susan McAllister, a scientist studying sharks'
brains in an attempt to find the cure for Alzheimer's Disease. After a shark
escapes and assaults a boat full of teenagers, corporate honcho Russell
Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson) gives her one last chance to prove the value of
her work before her funding is pulled. She takes him out to the site, a huge
underwater facility called Aquatica, so he can observe what happens there.
After most of the crew leaves for the weekend, a skeleton crew is left
behind, including shark hunter Carter Blake (Thomas Jane), computer expert
Tom Scoggins (Michael Rapaport), scientist couple Janice Higgins (Jacqueline
McKenzie) and Jim Whitlock (Stellan Skarsgård), and Preach (LL Cool J), the
religious cook. The sharks begin to exhibit signs of intelligence and, when
a freak storm hits the facility, they take over, flooding entire sections of
Aquatica and trying to eat the humans. It is eventually revealed that
McAllister has violated ethical principles of science and increased the
sharks' brain mass, making them smarter. The trapped humans must now try to
outrun the sharks as well as outsmart them, while trying to figure out how
to reach the surface.</P>
<P>"Deep Blue Sea" contains all the problems that most action films suffer
from. First of all, the dialogue is trite, pathetic, and unconvincing. The
plot also makes very little sense. The biggest problem is, of course, that
Burrows' supposedly "brilliant" scientist hadn't figured out ahead of time
that increasing the sharks' brain mass might make them a little smarter. The
other big problem with the film's premise is that the simple fact that the
sharks are now super-intelligent does not mean that they have seen full
schematics of the facility, or that they know what materials were used to
build it. "Deep Blue Sea" seems to make that assumption when explaining what
the sharks are trying to accomplish. Furthermore, the characters are not
terribly interesting, nor (with the exception of LL Cool J's Preach) are
they terribly charismatic characters. Burrows is an irresponsible jerk,
Jackson is pompous and self-satisfied, and the rest merely fill out the rest
of the necessary stereotypes. All of these problems contribute to a
dragged-out, boring, and infuriating first act, in which we are introduced
in plodding fashion to these uninteresting characters who speak ridiculous
dialogue. During these first 45 minutes or so, this critic was getting all
geared up to proclaim "Deep Blue Sea" as the worst movie of 1999.</P>
<P>Then something happened. I won't give it away (that would be a crime), but
director Renny Harlin sees fit to give us a death that happens so
unexpectedly, at such a surprising time, and to such an unlikely victim,
that I was forced to applaud for how the film had shocked me so
successfully. The film manages to do many things with this one death. Not
only does it kill one of its characters, but it sets up the idea that
absolutely no one will be spared on the basis of race, creed, or box-office
drawing ability. Let's face it, in most films of this nature, it's
relatively easy to determine not only who will die, but also the order in
which the murders will happen. In "Deep Blue Sea," this cannot be done.
Harlin may be a hack, ripping off of "Jaws" and "Jaws 2" (though that may be
considered as more of a tribute), but he at least knows how to surprise an
audience and leave them shrieking with delight after the shocking scene is
over with. The film has no obvious set-up for a death, with slowly rising
music and many obvious shots of the approaching monster. In "Deep Blue Sea,"
the characters are sitting around during a supposed lull in the action, when
suddenly, just when the audience least expects it, CHOMP! The shark has
struck, it's all over, and the audience is struggling to catch its breath.
In this age of overused special effects and directors with horrible shot
selection, this film actually comes as a refreshing bit of fun, a tribute to
B-movie scares that relied more on filmmaking savvy rather than fancy CGI
effects.</P>
<P>Not that the effects in "Deep Blue Sea" aren't convincing. The mixture of
real, animatronic, and computer-generated sharks make for an impressive
package indeed, but it's not the number of effects Harlin uses, it's how he
uses them. Like Spielberg did in "Jaws," Harlin makes sure that, when
building a proper suspense sequence, we don't get to see the shark until
absolutely necessary. Until then, an ominous underwater shadow followed by
an approaching fin cutting through the surface is all we need. He also plays
on monster movie conventions, especially the one that demands that black
characters are not permitted to act intelligently, and that one of them must
be killed first. In one of the film's better jokes, LL Cool J remarks, "I'm
toast. Brothers never make it out of situations like this." His character is
by far the most interesting, since he starts off like a typical ethnic
Hollywood stereotype, that of the bumbling black service employee. Why, they
even made him a religious man. Cool J, however, is able to transcend such
convention and morph, rather suddenly, into a suave action hero, and the
transformation is a welcome change.</P>
<P>So, "Deep Blue Sea" is an effects-driven monster movie that starts off
lousy, but after one very surprising turn of events, becomes an effective
thriller. Don't get me wrong. All the things that were wrong with the first
act apply to the rest of the movie. The dialogue doesn't get any better, the
plot still has major holes in it, and any character not played by a famous
rapper remains a flimsy sketch of a person. If those are the sort of things
that bother you, then you'll probably want to skip "Deep Blue Sea." If you'
re willing to look past those shortcomings and just want to have a good time
at the movies this summer, then this one will fit the bill. I'm giving "Deep
Blue Sea" a recommendation because I was entertained despite the B-movie
quality of the screenplay, and because the picture has one thing going for
it: The element of surprise. That element will keep audiences on their toes
as they engage in a futile effort to predict what will happen next. Any
movie that can do that is a success in my book.</P>
