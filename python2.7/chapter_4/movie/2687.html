<PRE>                              FORREST GUMP
                       A film review by Derek Miner
                        Copyright 1994 Derek Miner</PRE>
<P>     As a fan of director Robert Zemeckis, I have eagerly anticipated
his next directorial effort since DEATH BECOMES HER two years ago.
FORREST GUMP lives up to my expectations and surpasses them also.  The
film tells a genuine and moving story about an amazing character.</P>
<P>     FORREST GUMP is the remarkable story of a man (Tom Hanks) who,
despite an IQ somewhere in the area of 70, always seems to achieve
great success.  Forrest's amazing achievements are played out as a
humorous gimmick, but they are also part of his involving life story.</P>
<P>     The story, as told by Forrest himself, opens in his childhood.
Forrest not only is stigmatized by his low intelligence, but he also
must wear leg braces because of a crooked back.  His caring mother
(Sally Field) tries to teach him that despite his problems, he is no
different than everyone else.  Forrest is befriended by a young girl
named Jenny (Robin Wright) who is abused by her father.</P>
<P>     A sequence of events thrusts Forrest into the spotlight.
Literally shattering his leg braces, Forrest finds that he is an
amazing runner, which takes him through college as a football player.
Soon after, he enlists in the military, and is sent to Veitnam.  In
Veitnam, he meets a young black man named Bubba (Mykleti Williamson),
whose goal in life is to be a shrimp boat captain.  He also meets
Captain Dan (Gary Sinise), who eventually becomes legless through a war
injury.</P>
<P>     The three characters of Jenny, Bubba, and Captain Dan figure the
most in Forrest's life direction.  But throughout everything, the
inborn desire to do right and his love for Jenny are Forrest's
motivation.  Beyond Veitnam, there's more to Forrest's adventures, but
to reveal more would ruin the experience of watching the event's of his
life unfold in front of your eyes.  To experience such an emotional and
involving story is special.</P>
<P>     At the heart of FORREST GUMP are a lot of strong performances.
Tom Hanks plays Forrest as a friendly sort who you can appreciate,
rather than pity, for his innocence because it makes him more of a good
person than others with full mental capability.  Gary Sinise provides
some emotional shift in the film as Captain Dan, who comes out of
Vietnam bitter for having lost his limbs rather than his life.  Mykleti
Williamson's short but important role as Bubba, who is similar to
Forrest, is perfect in its simplicity.  One can see how Bubba and
Forrest latch on to one another, influencing Forrest's direction in
life.</P>
<P>     At first, FORREST GUMP doesn't appear to be the type of film
director Zemeckis (of BACK TO THE FUTURE fame) would tackle, but on
close inspection, it remains consistent with his previous work.  In
almost all his films, Zemeckis recreated a period of time, from
February 1964 in I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND, his first film, to 1955 in
BACK TO THE FUTURE and even the late 70s in DEATH BECOMES HER.  In
FORREST GUMP, an entire lifetime is covered, from the early 50s to the
early 80s.  In between, the character of Forrest is convincingly
interwoven into old news and television footage.</P>
<P>     It also seems that Zemeckis had an urge to "grow up," so to speak,
like colleague Steven Spielberg did with SCHINDLER'S LIST.  The humor
and pathos in Forrest's life are well-balanced and create a story that
the audience can sympathize and identify with.  Unlike Zemeckis'
previous work in broader comedy, FORREST GUMP tells an intimate story
on an epic scale.  Also contrary to previous Zemeckis spectacles,
special effects are used subtly, most notably to make Gary Sinise
appear legless.</P>
<P>     FORREST GUMP is not a perfect film nor is it one-of-a-kind.  But
it is near perfect and not easily equaled.  It is instead special,
accomplishing an emotional link that many films try, and fail, to
attain.  FORREST GUMP is a film that entertains yet makes us think, not
by forcing the audience to keep up, but by letting us see the world we
know through someone else's eyes, the eyes of Forrest Gump.</P>
