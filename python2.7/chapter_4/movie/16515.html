<PRE>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS</PRE>
<PRE>Drama (USA, 1956)</PRE>
<P>Starring Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter, Yvonne De Carlo</P>
<P>Directed and produced by Cecil B. DeMille</P>
<P>"The Ten Commandments" was a great epic when made in the fifties, and it
continues to enthrall the audience today. I saw it on a small TV-screen, and
most certainly wished I could have watched it on the big screen.</P>
<P>The script follows the Bible to some extent, but also draws in non-biblical
material, such as novels, which enhances the overall movie. (The Bible is a
bit secretive about Moses' life until he reached 30.)</P>
<P>The old-fashioned epic style, impressive and visually stunning as it may be,
isn't always as appealing to the modern movie-goer. Firstly, the movie is
well too long and moves a bit slow at times. Then there is a lot of
over-stylized acting, and although Charlton Heston is brilliant as Moses, he
may be a little pompous at times. But he is a more powerful and impressive
Moses than the animated character of the recent release "Prince of Egypt".
Except for the snake scene at Pharaoh's Court, the effects are enjoyable.
"Prince of Egypt" does a more 'realistic' Red Sea parting with modern
computer-generated animation, but "The Ten Commandments" did it the best way
possible in those days, and it's still impressive to watch.</P>
<P>As mentioned, the acting tends to be overdramatized, and this is a left-over
bone from the days when silent movies ruled the cinemas. It must however be
noted that Anne Baxter as Nefretiri and Yul Brynner as Rameses both do
excellent performances, and Cedric Hardwicke as Pharaoh Sethi is convincing,
and even humorous (his belated death scene).</P>
<P>Some of the love scenes, which function merely as subplots, do little more
than wear out the audience, as we all are very anxious to get Moses going.
After all, we do know the story. The ending is better than that of "Prince
of Egypt"; we are here getting to the point where Moses appoints Joshua to
lead his people into the promised land.</P>
<PRE>I rate this movie 5 on a 1-6 scale.</PRE>
