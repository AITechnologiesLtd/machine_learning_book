<P>Review of Central do Brasil (1998, a/k/a Central Station; Portuguese with
English subtitles)</P>
<P>Seen on Christmas Eve 1998 with Linda at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas for
$8.75</P>
<P>Big cities are renowned for grinding down the little people, and that goes
triple for the third world. Much like the world of Bunuel's Mexico City in
Los Olvidados, Rio de Janeiro is merciless. People are out for themselves
and if you take a wrong turn, you are much more likely to be the victim of
vigilante justice than police brutality.</P>
<P>Dora is a retired schoolteacher who supplements her pension by writing
letters for illiterate peasants reporting home on their urban
fortunes--sometimes lying, so no one will worry. They trust her to send
the, but she often doesn't, playing God and judging which ones will reach
their destination.</P>
<P>One of her patrons is killed by a bus, leaving her son Josue (Vinicius de
Oliveira) to fend for himself on the streets. Dora takes pity on him and
takes him in. Thinking she can get him adopted by rich foreigners, Dora
sells him to a local thug, and she buys a new television.</P>
<P>Horrified to learn that he is more likely going to become an
unwilling--and deceased--organ donor, she kidnaps him, and the two go on
the run. Dora hopes to reunite him with his father in a remote rural
outpost.</P>
<P>Fernanda Montenegro's Dora is both hard-bitten and vulnerable. It's easy
to see the decent person underneath the her current cynical shell. De
Oliveira, a nonactor, is wonderful as not just a helpless child, but as
Dora's moral barometer. His outrage at her low ethics helps prompt her
into better behavior.</P>
<P>What ensues is a journey "from nowhere to nowhere," as another critic put
it; Josue's father has moved several times, and Dora pushes further into
the frontier to find him. What happens is not predictable. Dora's
metaphoric journey and inevitable decisions are selfless. Given the
hopeless nature of Rio, her decisions are almost miraculous, as she gives
back hope and faith despite crushing realities. It takes looking after a
young boy for Dora to come to a major realization: "I long for my father;
I long for everything." The letters dictated to her are more than
messages; they are prayers.</P>
<P>Director Walter Salles Jr. takes us through the unfamiliar landscapes of
urban and rural Brazil. Surrounded by natural splendors, we see the
emptiness of the cramped tenement projects in Rio, and the fullness of the
open valleys of the north. The further they go from Rio, the more blind
faith and religious imagery fills the vacant rural landscape. In a way,
the excesses of decadent greed and religious fervor both are seen as
crazy, spinning out of control.</P>
<P>The Portuguese title (Central do Brasil) suggests that what is happening
here is essentially what is happening in Brazil. Salles shows what's
possible when cynicism and greed are dropped in favor of belief</P>
