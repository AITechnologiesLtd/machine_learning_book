Red Corner
Directed by Jon Avnet
Starring: Richard Gere, Bai Ling
Running time: 123 minutes</PRE>
<P>At one point during Red Corner, I found myself more interested in following
along with a famous tune in the soundtrack, "I Heard It Through the
Grapevine", than I was in the film itself. Bad sign.</P>
<P>Red Corner, directed by Jon Avnet (Fried Green Tomatoes, Up Close and
Personal) stars Richard Gere as Jack Moore, a general counselor for a major
American entertainment conglomerate. He is in Beijing, trying to close a
multi-billion dollar deal to bring top tv trash to China. (Basically Baywatch
type stuff.)</P>
<P>It starts off interestingly enough. Moore meets a Chinse woman at a fashion
show and goes to her place for some good old fashioned movie sex. (You know
the routine. She wears his clothes, shots of champagne overflowing out of a
glass is a metaphor for orgasms.) He is awakened the next morning by a
Chinese soldier who drags him from the bed in his curiously blood-stained
shirt, shows him the slashed body of the woman from the night before, and
throws him in prison. Moore soon learns that the justice system there is
vastly different from our own, and is told repeatedly that those who confess
get off easier than those who try to fight it. Guilty until proven innocent,
and that is highly unlikely. </P>
<P>Gere gives a flat, lackluster performance. His character is confused by the
goings on in the courtroom at one moment, then proves the judge wrong by
siting examples from Chinese law books a moment later. Moore becomes
emotionally, but not romantically involved with his attorney, and yet we are
never clear why. Neither shares a great deal with the other about their
personal lives. The emotional aspect is muddled and lost within  the attempt
at suspense. </P>
<P>The editing is incredibly obvious in some scenes. There are occasional
flashes back to seemingly miscellaneous shots from earlier in the film. Breif
fades from black and white into color pull us out and makes us wonder what is
going on. Edits from the climactic scene cut between two similar-looking
rooms in which important action is taking place with two seperate sets of
characters. Yet the there are no transitions. The dialogue in these scenes
are all in Chinese, and so the viewer is forced to read subtitles, and gets
lost between rooms on the cuts.</P>
<P>This uninspired film tells us that if we are blamed for a heinous crime, we'd
better not be in China, because of what we'd have to go through. However, if
we are, there is certainly a way for the cocky American to beat hundreds of
years of tradition, and show China how its judicial system is wrong. Thumbs
down for everyone in and involved with this film. The only visually
impressive aspect is the Chinese courtroom. Production designer Richard
Sylbert manages to create an imposing, massive room that makes the accused,
and the viewer, feel incredibly unlucky to be there. There is nothing here
that we havn't seen numerous times before.</P>
<P>1 1/2 out of 4 stars.
