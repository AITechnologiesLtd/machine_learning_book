<PRE>The Virgin Suicides
A Film Review By Geoff Berkshire</PRE>
<P>Cast: Kirsten Dunst, James Woods, Kathleen Turner, Josh Hartnett, Hannah Hall,
Danny DeVito, Scott Glenn, Jonathan Tucker, Michael Pare
Director: Sofia Coppola</P>
<P>The debut film from Sofia Coppola will provoke interest from many people for
many reasons, few of them involving the material itself.  Will she be as
disastrous a filmmaker as she was a performer in The Godfather Part III?  How
will she measure up to her famous father (or for that matter new husband Spike
Jonze, whose directorial debut Being John Malkovich was one of last year's
best)?  Those may be the initial curiosities knowing audiences bring to The
Virgin Suicides but it turns out they really should be far more worried about
the material itself.</P>
<P>Adapted by Coppola from a successful cult novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, The
Virgin Suicides is ostensibly the story of the Lisbon family: five beautiful
blonde daughters of a high school math teacher (James Woods) and his
conservative wife (Kathleen Turner).  Set in the upper class suburbs of Detroit
in the late 1970s it is told from the perspective of the boys next door, the
Weiner boys (that surname is supposed to be funny, I guess, but was already
used to far better effect in Welcome To the Dollhouse).  </P>
<P>The story focuses on the two youngest Lisbon girls.  The youngest, 13 year old
Cecilia (Hannah Hall, Young Jenny in Forrest Gump), recently made an attempt on
her life.  Her disturbed parents are advised by a psychologist (Danny Devito,
in a sharply observed one scene cameo) to allow the girls more interaction with
members of the opposite sex.  A party is planned in the Lisbon basement, the
Weiner boys are invited, and things are mostly awkward and uneventful in a
normal way until the party comes to a shocking early finish.</P>
<P>The story now switches gears to the second youngest girl, the blossoming 15
year old Lux (Kirsten Dunst) who is learning the value of her gorgeous physical
features.  She attracts the attention of school heartthrob Trip Fontaine (Josh
Hartnett) and begins a sly flirtation with him that eventually leads to going
together to a school dance.  It's in this section of the film where The Virgin
Suicides hits its stride.  The material has a familiar teen movie romance feel
but nails every scene with virtues of assured filmmaking, smart acting and good
attention to detail.  </P>
<P>Trip's introduction, perfectly backed by Heart's "Magic Man", is a particularly
vibrant stretch that instantly establishes his character.  A sequence where
Trip is invited to the Lisbon house to watch television is equally astute and,
although we have seen many, the school dance is giddy and memorably fun with
excellent use of Styx's "Come Sail Away" and a brilliant Peach Schnapps
reference.  In addition to the Styx and Heart songs the film has excellent
music supervision overall and also benefits from a superb score by hip French
techno band Air.</P>
<P>However, the film begins to lose focus again after Lux and Trip inevitably
split.  Lack of focus is the main problem with The Virgin Suicides.  Everything
is told from the point of view of an omniscient narrator (Giovanni Ribisi). 
This supposedly represents the collective voice of the Weiner boys, however
nothing in the film itself told me this (I learned it from a friend who had
read it somewhere and it's also contained in the production notes).  </P>
<P>Beyond Lux and Cecilia we never get to know any of the Lisbon girls, they
barely even speak.  The Weiner boys are almost completely indistinguishable,
although Jonathan Tucker's Tim seems to speak more than any of the others. 
There are also disorienting scenes where a grown up Trip (Michael Pare) talks,
on camera, about his relationship with Lux, the only time in the film something
like this happens.  Pare is perfectly cast in the role but the presence of it
in the film is questionable.  There are scattershot scenes which poke fun at
the community but these also seem random, although well done.</P>
<P>On the positive side, Coppola displays a transfixing visual style (Edward
Lachman's cinematography is lovely) and a nice attention to details.  She also
gets wonderful work from all of the actors who actually have a role to play. 
Woods has a nice departure from his usual character as the timid math teacher. 
Turner, completely de-glammed, grabs on to one of her best parts in years and
reminds what a great actress she is.  Of the younger players Hartnett shows
leading man potential in his memorable supporting role, Dunst proves she's
better in a dramatic role like this than in her recent attempts at comedy, and
Hall makes a vividly haunting impression, she reminded me a bit of a younger
Sarah Polley.</P>
<P>Unfortunately these strengths are not enough to overcome the considerable flaws
in the narrative.  The film is structured like a mystery in the first and third
acts but it's a mystery that is never solved.  Even if the movie is simply
about parents keeping too tight a hold on their children the message is never
fully conveyed.  Plus, as entertaining as the middle section of the film is, it
doesn't really fit in with the tone of the rest of the film.  Without learning
very much about the Lisbon girls and the Weiner boys the finale simply lacks
impact.  The movie will inevitably be compared to The Ice Storm, due to time
period and some tone similarities, but it pales terribly next to that milestone
of the genre.</P>
