<PRE>A TIME FOR DRUNKEN HORSES
Written and Directed by Bahman Ghobadi
Plan B   NR   80 min.   Subtitles</PRE>
<P>     Bahman Ghobadi's stunning debut film strips away the protective 
layer that separates an audience from the world that unfolds on the 
screen.  We're transported almost bodily into the hardscrabble landscape 
of a Kurdish mountain village near Iran's border with Iraq.</P>
<P>This is a story of deprivation, a story of survival, but most of 
all it's a love story.  It focuses on three children: Ayoub, his sister 
Ameneh, and their older brother Madi, who is a crippled dwarf.  Their 
mother is dead, their father is a smuggler, and when he is killed the 
kids are pretty much on their own.  Madi, with his doll-sized body and 
hunched back and eyes both childlike and inexpressibly old, needs 
regular injections and will require an operation to stay alive.</P>
<P>The two healthy children do what they can for Madi.  The teenage 
Ameneh agrees to a marriage for a promise of help from the bridegroom's 
family.  12-year-old Ayoub shoulders a man's burden as a smuggler, 
hauling contraband over harsh snowy mountains through cold so bitter the 
pack mules are fed booze to keep them warm.  The operation will buy Madi 
at most another year of life, but they never stop to weigh the cost.  At 
that age, and through those uncompromisingly loving eyes, a year seems 
like a lot, and the alternative is unimaginable.</P>
<P>Ghobadi, who won the Camera d'Or at Cannes for best first film, 
tells his story from his heart and experience.  He's from a Kurdish 
village much like this one.  Ghobadi's style is simple and direct, and 
images such as little Madi riding like a solemn-eyed puppy in a mule's 
saddlebag are pictures you'll carry with you a long time. </P>
