                                 THE INKWELL              
                        A Film Review by Scott Renshaw 
                         Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw </PRE>
<P>Starring:  Larenz Tate, Joe Morton, Glynn Turman, Jada Pinkett. 
Screenplay:  Tom Ricostronza and Paris Qualles.
Director:  Matty Rich.</P>
<P>     Despite the credit, no one named Tom Ricostronza worked on the
script for THE INKWELL.  Novelist Trey Ellis, who developed the 
original screenplay, made a rancorous departure from the production 
over philosophical differences with Matty Rich, and substituted a 
pseudonym which is a loose Italian translation for "full of 
excrement."  Whatever the specific points of disagreement might have 
been, it would appear that Ellis knew something that Rich did not. It 
is clear that THE INKWELL could have been a gentle look at a rarely-
seen side of the black American experience; instead, it's a sloppy and 
ham-fisted collection of caricatures which seems to trip over an 
occasional truth rather than aiming for any.</P>
<P>     It's the summer of 1976, and 16-year-old upstate New York
resident Drew Tate (Larenz Tate) is preparing to take a two week 
family vacation with his parents (Joe Morton, Suzzanne Douglas). The 
destination:  the home of his conspicuously middle-class Uncle
Spencer (Glynn Turman) and his family on Martha's Vineyard.  Tension 
is present from the outset, as Drew's parents worry about his strange 
behavior, and Drew's father Kenny, a former Black Panther, clashes 
with his bourgeois brother-in-law.  As Drew explores the town and the 
local beach frequented primarily by the island's black residents 
(nicknamed The Inkwell), he finds a few things which attract his 
attention.  One is a kindly therapist (Phyllis Yvonne Stickney) who 
seems to be the only person who understands him; another is an 
inaccessible young resident (Jada Pinkett) who steals his heart.</P>
<P>     At times, I thought I might end up liking THE INKWELL.  There
was a relaxed, nostalgic tone to some of the scenes featuring Drew, 
and Larenz Tate brought a geeky, confused charm to Drew's fumblings 
through adolescence.  But for every scene which endeared, there were 
two which annoyed.  Matty Rich ricochets between the sublime and the 
ridiculous with reckless abandon, treating us to foolishness like Drew 
and his island cronies bumbling around an unappealing nude beach, and 
Kenny taking on Uncle Spencer in a tennis match reminiscent of the 
over-the-top Richard Pryor/Bill Cosby contest from CALIFORNIA SUITE.  
THE INKWELL tempts you with sweetness, then smacks you over the head 
every time you try to embrace it.</P>
<P>     It's also exceedingly hard to take THE INKWELL at all seriously
with so many characters so miserably realized.  Glynn Turman huffs and 
puffs as the unashamedly Republican Uncle Spencer, delivering one of 
those horrible drunken diatribes that only movie drunks deliver.  Jada 
Pinkett is genuinely annoying as the haughty island princess, all 
hooded eyes, arched eyebrows and faux-Valley Girl vocal stylings.  
Morris Chestnut preens and postures as the town cad, and Phyllis 
Yvonne Stickney speaks deep truths in a Jamaican accent.  Two talented 
actors (Joe Morton as Kenny and Mary Alice as Drew's grandmother) rise 
above the level of the material, but for the most part Drew Tate seems 
to be living in a world of people whose sole purpose for existing is 
moving him towards losing his virginity.</P>
<P>     And that's really the fundamental problem with THE INKWELL.
Since I knew exactly where it was going, its only chance to work for 
me was in how it took me there.  I wanted to be interested in Drew's 
story, but I was repeatedly drawn away by the seemingly pointless 
class struggle between Kenny and Spencer; I wanted to lose myself in 
the characters, and they repeatedly reminded me they were phony. Time 
and again, I found myself convinced that Matty Rich had no real sense 
of what he wanted to do with this story, so he did a little bit of 
everything.  And somewhere, Trey Ellis must be having the last laugh.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 inkwells:  4.</PRE>
