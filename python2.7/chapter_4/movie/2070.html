<PRE>                   JASON GOES TO HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>1:29, Horror, 1993
MPAA rating: R (graphic violence, female nudity, explicit
                language, adult situations)
Rating: three (on a scale of zero to five)
Director: Adam Marcus
Cast: John D. LeMay, Kari Keegan, Allison Smith, Steven Culp,
      Billy Green Bush, Leslie Jordan, Richard Gant, Kane Hodder,
      Erin Gray, Steven Williams</P>
<P>     Kane Hodder (the infamous Jason Voorhees) gets blown up at the
beginning of this film.  His body gets destroyed, but his evil soul
lives on, travelling from body to body until he can get his body back.
Hodder returns to Crystal Lake for much bloody mayhem and is followed
by a bounty hunter who knows how to kill Hodder for good.</P>
<P>     JASON GOES TO HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY is the ninth entry in the
FRIDAY THE 13TH series.  This film is supposed to be the last film of
the series, but isn't that what the producers said about FRIDAY THE
13TH - PART 4: THE LAST CHAPTER?  I expect that if this film does well
at the box office then yet another one will soon be on the way.  I only
recommend this film to fans of the series, and then only at matinee
prices or off videocassette (when it is released).</P>
<P>     JASON GOES TO HELL, unfortunately, does not live up to the rest of
the series.  Like the earlier film FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL NIGHTMARE,
this film is almost a spoof of the genre and of the FRIDAY THE 13TH
series itself.  At some times the film is intentionally funny and at
other times it is unintentionally amusing.  This film isn't believable
at any level, but what the hell -- if you wanted believable you
wouldn't have gone to see this film in the first place.</P>
<P>     This film keeps up with the gore content of the series, which
could repulse some unexpecting viewers.  The gore effects are well done
and complement the film.  They don't look cheap and should satisfy all
the gore freaks in the audience, because, lets face it, if you are
going to see this film you aren't going to see an Oscar winning
screenplay, you are going for the buckets of blood that shall be
spilled.  The script could have been written better, but as far as
horror movies go, the writing isn't that bad.  The film is predictable
in too many spots, but does have a few surprises in store for the
viewer.  The score isn't overly memorable, but suits the film.  It
doesn't sound that much different from the other FRIDAY THE 13TH films,
which could be that they were all done by the same person (Harry
Manfredini), but it does add a slight chill at the appropriate
moments.</P>
<P>     The acting in this film isn't going to exactly win any Oscars
either.  Kane Hodder (playing Jason for a third time) does a good job
for the little time he is actually on screen.  The rest of the cast
isn't overly spectacular, but aren't extremely bad either.  They are
basically just a normal B-grade horror film cast that can scream on
cue.</P>
