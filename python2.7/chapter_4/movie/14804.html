<P>SANDS OF IWO JIMA ranks as one of John Wayne's finest films, including 
his Westerns.  It's story follows a tough platoon commander and his men 
through some of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific theater, including 
Tarawa and Iwo Jima.</P>
<P>Wayne's performance is a classic.  I'm fairly sure it was my 10 year-old 
daughter's first exposure to Wayne, and I'm glad she saw him in a 
representative role.  When you first see Wayne, he should be doing his 
best tough-guy act, like he does with Sergeant John M. Stryker.  What a 
hard-as-nails name!  (Isn't there a professional wrestler named Sergeant 
Striker?)  To give a fictional character a middle initial is another nod 
to realism.  Anyway, your first time seeing "The Duke" should be when 
he's unsentimental, doing a difficult job and shunning credit, all the 
while using his one-of-a-kind talk and walk.  </P>
<P>Here his character was more challenging than many of his typical roles.  
Stryker is hard-nosed almost beyond tolerance, to the point that many of 
his men complain and begin the rumblings of mutiny.  But when we find 
out that Stryker's wife has left him and taken their child, and that the 
boy does not write to his father, we see some of the motivation behind 
his behaviors.  We understand better - though not completely - why he 
goes on drunken binges. Although the subplot concerning Stryker's 
personal life follows the formula of many war films, it certainly makes 
for good psychological study, and contributes a freshness to the film.  </P>
<P>Two of Stryker's men take his treatment personally.  As Corporal Thomas, 
Forrest Tucker hates Stryker's guts because Stryker beat him in a 
divisional boxing match some time earlier.  The old grudge surfaces 
until they are, once again, engaged in fisticuffs.  Only this time a 
colonel spots the sergeant beating up on his own man, and we watch one 
Marine show his loyalty to another Marine, when Thomas claims Stryker 
was only instructing him in combat judo.  In Thomas' confession to 
Stryker just after their make-up, we see the effects of a very sticky 
moral situation, a scene that would hold its own with any ethical 
dilemma I can think of in movies.  Pfc. Peter Conway's hatred of Stryker 
is more complicated.  He is a Harvard-educated businessman, an amateur 
soldier here to fight the war and then return home.  When Conrad marries 
and later receives a letter from his wife, telling of their newborn 
baby, we see Stryker's jealousy.  The only question at this point is how 
will Conway (played by John Agar) come to terms with his sergeant?</P>
<P>Real footage from Pacific campaigns is used convincingly in the film.  
When we see flame-throwing tanks igniting the battle-scarred hills of 
the islands, we form at least an idea of how devastating war can be.  
The smoothness of the film clips is pleasing too: the battlefields of 
the movie set match the real battlefields closely.  And the difference 
in film quality is not much.  Most remarkable is the planting of the 
flag atop Mount Suribachi.  Director Alan Dwan uses an almost corny 
method of drawing our attention to the scene immortalized in the Iwo 
Jima Memorial - Marines struggling to raise the Stars and Stripes.  But 
the effect caps the film nicely.</P>
<P>A recent trend in movie-making takes another look at standard genres and 
revises their supposed goals.  Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN showed us a 
Western whose hero was a gun-toting murderer.  Steven Spielberg made 
perhaps the finest war movie ever in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  My point is 
that RYAN has been advertised not as a war movie, but an "anti-war" 
movie.  Taking a look at John Wayne's efforts in SANDS OF IWO JIMA, I 
cannot see how he or the film praises war.  I cannot see, especially 
with the anti-climatic ending, how this narrative uses war for the 
mindless support of political causes.  </P>
<P>I would recommend anyone watch this John Wayne film.  And if you are 
watching with Wayne  first-timers, withhold your comments about this 
grand old actor, and let them form their own opinions.  The man is 
impressive enough to leave his mark on many generations.</P>
