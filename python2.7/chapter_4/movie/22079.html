POINT BLANK
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Few films have been so thoroughly and universally trashed by
the critics as PAYBACK, 1999 crime thriller by Brian
Helgeland. Most of them attacked the overuse of violence and
utter lack of any moral compass among its characters. The
author of this review agrees with most of the critics, but
only partially. The filmmakers had it coming, but for
entirely different reasons. The biggest crime made by makers
of PAYBACK lies in the fact that they had dared to remake
POINT BLANK, 1967 film by John Boorman. That film happened
to be one of the best underrated film classics of all times,
and its reputation really shouldn't have been tarnished by
uninspired and tedious remake.</P>
<P>The plot of the original film is based on THE HUNTER, 1964
novel by Donald E. Westlake. Its protagonist (played by Lee
Marvin) is known only by the name Walker. His best friend
Mal Reese (played by John Vernon) is a gangster owing huge
debt to all-powerful Organisation. In order to save his
friend's life, Walker agrees to take part in a robbery that
would pay Reese's debt. But, instead of gratitude, Walker
receives two bullets by Reese, who then takes off with
Walker's adulterous wife Lynne (played by Sharon Acker) and
Walker's 93,000 US$ share of the loot. Walker was left for
dead, but he managed to survive and a year later he is
approached by some creepy individual named Yost (played by
Keenan Wynn). Yost offers information about Lynne and Reese
in exchange for Walker's help with his own plans about
Organisation. Walker agrees and begins the violent campaign
to take revenge and retrieve his money.</P>
<P>One of the reasons why POINT BLANK was somewhat shadowed by
other films of 1960s lies in the fact that it was probably
made at least a decade before its time. Dark, nihilistic
script by Alexander Jacobs, David and Rafe Newhouse, as well
as extremely violent, amoral and emotionally damaged
protagonists belong more to the 1970s than to idealistic
1960s. However, most critics and viewers probably failed to
see the real element of the originality in POINT BLANK. The
reason why this film should enter all film encyclopaedias
lies in the original directorial approach and very distinct
visual style employed by its director John Boorman. Rather
simplistic plot and even simpler characters are enhanced by
the heavy atmosphere and use of tricks today mostly
associated with "artsy" films or music videos - slow motion,
repetitive flashbacks, fast editing and, above all, very
haunting soundtrack by Stephen Edwards. POINT BLANK
therefore looks very different from most of the crime
thrillers. Another thing that makes it very distinct is a
rather original perspective on the criminal underworld -
people who inhabit such realms are well- dressed,
well-educated, they live in luxurious, modern, stylish
apartments and houses and, generally speaking, and instead
of looking like the pariahs of the society, they look like
its pillars. In that regard, by presenting criminals like
modern-day aristocracy and criminal organisations as
equivalent of all-powerful state POINT BLANK would resemble
some crime thrillers of the latter decades.</P>
<P>Heavy atmosphere and style of POINT BLANK compensated the
simplicity of the script, but Boorman, unfortunately,
overplayed that card. In some instances the events on the
screen are unclear, characters act irrationally and film
even lacks the proper closure, leaving the audience without
expected catharsis. Boorman even makes more confusion with
some surreal shots, hinting that the whole film could be
nothing more than a fantasy of a dying Walker. On the other
hand, the viewers are still focused thanks to excellent
cast. Lee Marvin played wonderful and complex role of a
seemingly simple character - at first he is man in love,
faithful friend, and later he turns into extremely violent
yet stone-cold killer whose motivations shift, but his
determination does not. His acting is very subtle, and the
emotional states of Walker are presented through small
gestures, short glances or cold, impersonal action. He
managed to overshadow everyone else, including very
energetic Angie Dickinson as his accidental partner.
Overshadowed by the lead or not, supporting cast is splendid
- John Vernon played the first of his many villainous roles,
James Sikking is great as cynical hitman, as well as Lloyd
Bochner and Carroll O'Connor as corporate gangsters. Sharon
Acker as his wife appears relatively shortly, but her role
is also memorable, especially during her final monologue
that expresses the emotional emptiness of her character.</P>
<P>POINT BLANK perhaps earned its reputation simply by being
shot in the right time, but it could provide good
inspiration to future film- makers. With better results than
the last time, we should all hope.</P>
