<P>     When his son is born, Filip buys a Russian-made hand-held movie
camera to record his child growing up.  His boss discovers the camera
and commissions him to make a documentary about a business meeting.  In
no time at all he is hooked on movie-making, rapt by the power he has
to point his camera at someone and turn life into art.  His enthusiasm
prompts others to join him in a film club at the factory, and
encouragement from professional film-makers leads him to believe that
he can use his camera as a force for good, to expose corruption at his
factory and in the Communist Party.  What he discovers is that things
the camera can make issues simple, but that it lies in doing so; life
is more complicated than he had thought.</P>
<P>     The cinematography and camerawork in CAMERA BUFF is very
effective.  The opening mimics perfectly the conventions of realistic
documentary, resembling early Kieslowski shorts such as Hospital: the
cutting is rapid, the people mutter indistinctly among themselves, the
dialogue is naturalistic.  This style is the simple, mimetic style of
amateur cameraman Filip as he shoots his first film.  As the film
progresses, Filip learns more about the art of film-making, develops
his own sense of aesthetic and of the duty that a film-maker has to be
true to his convictions.  A bereaved son is comforted by Filip's film
of his mother ("A person is dead, but here she still lives") and Filip
discovers that there are "things a man needs more than peace and
quiet".  Mirroring this internal change, the style of Camera Buff
changes, becoming more consciously dramatic and cinematic.  People talk
in turn, give speeches; the framing of the shots is more beautiful,
more contrived.  By the end, when his wife and child have left him,
when his personal life has been ruined and he realises that his crusade
to expose corruption by making films about it was naive and misguided,
the realism dissolves away completely and Filip points the lens only at
his own troubled head, no longer able to see things around him with the
clarity and simplicity of vision that initially inspired him to be a
film-maker.</P>
