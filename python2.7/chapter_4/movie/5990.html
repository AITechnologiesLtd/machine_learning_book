<PRE>               A film review by Michael Dequina</PRE>

<PRE>(R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>As shown in Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, and Cape Fear, Robert
DeNiro has nailed down the psycho stalker bit cold.  As if he needed to
prove it again, DeNiro plays--rather well, I might add--the titular stalker
in the new thriller The Fan.  While not quite as inspired as the work of its
lead, Tony Scott's film is an entertaining piece of work, if not the most
original.</P>
<P>Gil Renard's (DeNiro) life is in ruins--he's about to be let go from
the sporting knife company is father created, and his wife (Patti
D'Arbanville Quinn) won't let him see his son.  While everything crashes
around him, Gil holds on even more tightly to the one thing that's kept him
relatively sane--San Francisco Giants baseball.  Ironically, it is also what
drives him over the edge, for he becomes obsessed with helping his favorite
Giant, highly-paid outfielder Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes), come out of a
slump.</P>
<P>Despite fine work from the always-great Snipes, Ellen Barkin (as a
tough sports radio host), and, surprisingly, John Leguizamo (appropriately
oily as Bobby's agent), this is DeNiro's movie all the way.  The territory
is quite familiar for him, and as such his work can't help but feel somewhat
derivative--the geeky, deluded Gil is a variation of The King of Comedy's
Rupert Pupkin.  But to make him Pupkineque is a wise choice; Gil, while
always somewhat on the edge, comes off as a regular guy--passionate about
his likes and dislikes, somewhat overconfident at times, but not nearly as
cool as he thinks he is.  When Gil does finally lose it, DeNiro doesn't chew
the scenery; he remains rather calm, an appropriate acting choice that
conveys Gil's feeling of justification for his actions--and, in the process,
appears more menacing and more human.</P>
<P>However, the human angle in the latter part of the film comes
exclusively from DeNiro, for Phoef Sutton's script doesn't follow the same
line.  Sutton effectively humanizes Gil in the film's first half, showing
how a borderline personality is finally driven to insanity by the turmoil of
outside events.  But when he crosses that line, all of that goes out the
window.  There's no more empathizing with Gil, only fear of what he's
become--a murderous psycho.  It is to DeNiro's credit, and director Scott's,
that Gil manages to come off as more.  Sutton does manage to work in a great
bit near the end of the film where Bobby asks Gil what he wants from him,
and, after a moment of  pondering, Gil can't come up with an answer.  In
that brief moment, Sutton vividly shows the absurdity of the stalker mentality.</P>
<P>The biggest problem of The Fan isn't the writing--it's the
theatrical trailer, which gives pretty much the whole film away.  Director
Scott must be commended for making a brisk, stylish film that still manages
to create some suspense, even if a number of the plot points were divulged
in the trailer.  It's not especially scary, but it does entertain, and
that's the bottom line.</P>
