<P>If somebody told me there was a non-porn film with more money shots than
Happiness, I just wouldn't believe them.  But that film does exist, and it's
called Baise-moi (depending on which circle you run in, the direct
translation of the title is either Rape Me or Fuck Me).  The film was tossed
out of the 1999 Toronto International Film Festival (only to return in 2000
with an edited rape scene) and was banned in its native France just three
days after it opened.</P>
<P>So what's the hubbub?  Baise-moi is equal parts Thelma and Louise, Natural
Born Killers and Cum Suckers From Outer Space IV.  It's about a
pornography-addicted hooker (who kills her uptight roommate) and a porn-star
rape victim (who kills her brother) who meet after missing the last train
one dark evening.  The two "ladies" hit the road, pick up random men, screw
the shit out them and then, depending on their overall level of sexual
gratification, torture and kill the gentlemen.  They're ruthless, they have
no regret, and since both actresses are porn stars in real life, the film is
full of gratuitous penetration shots that would rival those seen in a
triple-X feature if the digital video production wasn't so damn grainy.</P>
<P>Baise-moi was made to make viewers uncomfortable, and in that regard, the
film can be considered a success.  There isn't much happening artistically
here; it's just a lot of humping and killing.  I've been begging for more of
each in my diet of film, and now that I have them, I feel kind of nauseous.</P>
<P>1:27 - NR but contains graphic sex and violence, rape, language and drug use</P>
