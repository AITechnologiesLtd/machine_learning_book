<PRE>                               THE FUGITIVE
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1993 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     This is based on the TV series of the same name, with Harrison
Ford playing the on-the-run doctor, and Tommy Lee Jones as his pursuer.
Briefly, Ford's character is accused and convicted of the brutal murder
of his wife, and escapes while on his way to Death Row to hunt down the
one-armed man who he knows is the real criminal.</P>
<P>     Academy Award nominations all around: for Best Picture, Best
Director, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor (there are no
significant women's parts).</P>
<P>     The first half of the movie is a thrilling chase, with great
special effects that really put me on the edge of my seat (in
particular, the train crash beats anything from the Indiana Jones
series). But it is Ford's bewildered intensity and Tommy Lee Jones's
no-nonsence confidence that make this a great film, coupled with the
direction. I loved that moment when Jones catches up with Ford early
on, and you know what Ford's going to do (at least if you've seen the
preview), and he knows it too, and he can't quite believe he's going to
do it but does it anyway.  Or later, when Jones has Ford in his sights
and you just know it's over, but it isn't and at first you (and Ford)
can't believe it, and then it makes so much sense.  This is truly great
cinema, what American films are all about.</P>
<P>     The movie drags towards the end, when a poorly-written script
catches up with the director and forces him to spend time explaining
why the one-armed man did what he did, and to show us two middle-aged
men fighting.  I mean, who cares?  At that point, everything that
matters has been resolved; it would have been better if there had been
one more near encounter earlier on or something, if the movie had to
last a certain length.</P>
