<PRE>FREDDY GOT FINGERED
-------------------</PRE>
<P>Gord Brody (Tom Green) is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still
lives in parents Jim (Rip Torn) and Julie's (Julie Hagerty, "Airplane")
basement.  As dad declares all out war, Gord secures a job in a cheese
sandwich factory in far off LA and sets off to make his dreams come true.
Gord doesn't make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with
fawning mom and outraged dad in "Freddy Got Fingered."</P>
<P>Tom Green cowrites (with "Tom Green Show" scribe Derek Harvie), directs and
stars in what is essentially Tom Green's primal scream.  So, if Tom Green 
screams in an empty theater, does he make a sound?</P>
<P>It's clear that "Freddy Got Fingered" is at least partially autobiographical
and Green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad (mom gets off easier
when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and
Greeks).  While this may be of interest to his hard core fans, there's little
about Green's mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else.</P>
<P>The film starts promisingly enough, with a well executed skateboarding
scene through a shopping mall set to the Sex Pistols' 'Problem' (Green's put
together a first rate soundtrack) and yes, I laughed a few times. Green's 
flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to 
draw, make music and eat at the same time (the 'daddy would you like some 
sausages' scene repeatedly shown in the film's trailer) are inspired comedy.
But what's funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having 
her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap?  
A baby delivery bit shows some groan-inducing promise until enough blood
is splattered to coagulate the laughs.  Younger (by three years) brother
Freddy's internment at The Institute for Sexually Abused Children does
nothing but confirm one's worst fears regarding the film's title and
Green's infamous 'handling' of a real horse, while not nearly as shocking as 
it would seem, doesn't make sense.  By the time he repeats the gag with
an elephant at film's end, the overall effect is numbness.</P>
<P>While "Freddy Got Fingered" has the admirable end result of depicting the
harm in demeaning a child's self esteem, it's essentially a whole lot of
Tom Green running around being noisy.  Rip Torn, what were you thinking?</P>
