<PRE>The Sweet Hereafter (R) ****
Starring Ian Holm, Sarah Polley
Directed by Atom Egoyan
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Has there ever been a film so spectacular and so wonderful that you have ever
been afraid to write a review for it? A picture show with a story so
fantastically woven into a great motion picture experience? If the slightest
word could set off someone or do disrespect to the film? This is exactly the
way I feel about The Sweet Hereafter which has just joined my Top 5 favorite
films of all time.</P>
<P>Mitchell Stephens (Holm) is a lawyer who has gone to a snowy town where
fourteen kids have died in a bus crash. He suggests that something was wrong
with the bus, and wants to file a claims suit for the damages experienced by
the families. He interviews various parents and victims of the crash including
Nicole (Polley) who has been confined to a wheelchair. </P>
<P>But Mitchell soons finds these problems connecting to what's happening in his
life with his troubled daughter. He learns certain lessons here that can help
him towards bettering the life of his family. He also has to deal with people
who are living in the past and cannot move on.</P>
<P>But it's not just the great screenplay (which was Oscar nominated) and the
great characters that appear that make this film what it is. It's the way the
film is shot. For some scenes, Egoyan fills the screen with people's mouth
quivering as they talk to one another, and rather then letting the film start
with the bus crash and have all of the conversations follow it, the film tells
the story is a weird sort of way, flashing back between after the accident,
before the accident, and the present day. </P>
<P>The film has robbed of all of the two Oscars it got nominated for. Where was
the Best Picture nomination? Where were the Supporting Actress and Best Actor
nods? Who cares about Titanic? I cried much more often in this than I did in
that. You need to see this film now! This instant! Go! Go to Blockbuster and
see The Sweet Hereafter which gets **** stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: Brief frontal female nudity and some breasts are present as well
as some mild language. Good Age: 14 & Up</P>
