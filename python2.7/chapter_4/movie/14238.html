<P>Star Wars: Special Edition (George Lucas), 1997
Review from Cinephobia</P>
<P>When I first heard that George Lucas wanted to rerelease "Star Wars"
with new special effects, I thought it was a great idea. There are a
lot of dodgy shots in Star Wars: Lucas was working with primitive
technology on a very tight budget. This meant that some effects were
visibly fake (one alien
in the Cantina was obviously just a guy in a werewolf mask) or
disappointingly staged (such as the static, uninteresting movement of
the fighters in the final battle).</P>
<P>The changes made in the final battle scene for the "Special Edition"
are along the line I hoped Lucas would take. He has resisted the urge
to mount a major overhaul, and some of the new material is great:
there is a fantastic new shot of the Rebel squadron flying towards the
Death Star. At the same time, the better shots from the original film
have been left unchanged. The wonderful shot of the Millennium Falcon
emerging from the sun is an example of this. There are also some new
effects elsewhere in the film that are excellent, such as the very
dramatic new shot of the Jawa's sandcrawler.</P>
<P>Many of the other changes, however, are seriously misguided. The first
really bad sequence is a brief one: several stormtroopers search the
desert for R2-D2 and C-3PO riding large creatures (apparently known as
"Dewbacks"). This sequence was present in the original, but in shorter
form, with stuffed, immobile versions of the Dewbacks visible in the
distance. Lucas obviously felt the advances in computer graphics made
on Jurassic Park provided a perfect opportunity to bring these
creatures to the fore, making "Star Wars" just that extra bit more
exotic. The problem is, the creatures look terrible. Like some of the
creatures in "Jurassic Park," the skin looks slightly wrong.
More seriously, however, they are terribly animated. On "Jurassic"
Spielberg had a team of experienced animators manipulating the
dinosaurs (led by Phil Tippet, who ironically did some brief
stop-motion work for the original "Star Wars"). Here, though, the
creatures' over-exaggerated movements make it look suspiciously like
Lucas let the computer boffins animate them themselves.</P>
<P>This annoyed me. Yet in itself it does not really count as artistic
vandalism. What does, however, is the awful scene in which Jabba the
Hutt appears. This has been made possible by the existence of footage
of Han Solo meeting Jabba the Hutt that was cut from the original.
Lucas claims that the scene was cut because he ran out of money to
complete a special effects Jabba. He says the swarthy actor in the
original scene was present merely to give Harrison Ford somebody to
play against, and that Jabba would have been a stop-motion creature
inserted in post-production.</P>
<P>I find this extremely hard to believe. The scene is simply not filmed
in a way that would have made this feasible given Lucas' tight budget
and the limitations of 1977 technology. If he had been adding a
creature, wouldn't he have prevented Ford from walking both in front
of and behind the actor? Wouldn't he have had them standing still?
Wouldn't he have chosen a thinner actor who could be more easily
hidden "underneath" the animated Jabba? All these factors combine to
suggest that the shot Lucas claims he intended was virtually
impossible. Jabba would have been a more ambitious special effect than
anything achieved in the two (much higher budgeted) sequels. (A check
of Alan Dean Foster's ghostwritten novelisation, which included the
Jabba scene, seems to bear this out: Foster's description of Jabba is
vague, but to me reads as a human).</P>
<P>If this is true, then Lucas cut the scene not because he couldn't
achieve it, but simply because it didn't work. The evidence bears this
out: the scene is terrible. For some reason, the dialogue repeats much
of what Han had said to Greedo word for word. Jabba is far too
friendly to Han, giving him an extended time period to pay his debt
with almost no argument. Not only does this clash with the tough Jabba
we would see later in "Return of the Jedi," but it also undermines
Solo's motivation for taking Luke and Obi-Wan. Perhaps oddest of all
is that the scene ruins the moment in which we first see the
Millennium Falcon: a little later Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids are
led into
the loading bay, and we get a chord of music for our first look at the
ship. Yet with the Jabba scene included, we've actually already seen
it. And this is before I even mention the poor effects work. Jabba is
better animated than the dewbacks, but he still looks like an effect
(give me a rubber puppet any day). And because of the twin
difficulties of plausibly moving Jabba and fitting him into the frame,
he's been made smaller, so that he looks nothing like the "Jedi"
Jabba. This rather defeats the purpose of reinserting the scene.</P>
<P>Given all these problems, why did Lucas put it in at all? The answer
is surely that he felt he needed more than a simple spit-and-polish of
his old film to maximise the hype. After all, this is much more than a
simple re-release. Lucas is in pre-production on Episodes I to III of
the Star Wars saga, to be released starting in 1999. A three film
commitment is not to be sneezed at, so the re-release of the old films
is a perfect way of testing the waters while stoking the fires (if I
may mix a metaphor or two). Not to mention the fact that through his
control of all Star Wars merchandise (toys, computer games, books,
lunchboxes... you name it) Lucas stands to make zillions if the
re-release takes off. Thus he needs to make the re-release huge, and
the best way to do that is to offer the fans "a few new surprises."
Extra footage is the perfect hook - even if it comes from the cutting
room floor.</P>
<P>This is change for the sake of change, and it harms the film. It's not
unlike the colorisation of black and white movies: to me the fact that
Lucas is doing it to his own films makes no difference.</P>
