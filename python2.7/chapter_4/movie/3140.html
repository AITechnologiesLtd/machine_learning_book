<PRE>                    MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Dorothy Parker wrote witty, cynical
          poems and stories and spoke extemporaneously some
          of the funniest epigrams this side of Oscar Wilde.
          She was one of the central figures of the famous
          Algonquin Round Table literary circle.  Finally a
          film has been made which explodes the myth that it
          might be interesting to know a little more about
          Dorothy Parker.  Rating: 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The Algonquin Round Table was a unique literary circle.  Through
the 1920s a group of the brightest, wittiest, and elitist of the
Manhattan's artistic types met every day in the Rose Room of the
Algonquin Hotel on 44th Street.  There they ate lunch, traded barbs,
and gossiped.  Woe betide the unprepared newcomer who tried to join the
prestigious group.  He became an immediate target for the rapier-
sarcasm of some of the cleverest literary minds this country ever
produced.  The Round Table circled around its two brightest stars,
Alexander Woollcott and Dorothy Parker.  Both were merciless critics as
well as authors.  Other notable members were Robert Benchley, Marc
Connelly, Edna Ferber, George S. Kaufman, Robert Sherwood, and many
others.  MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE is the story of Parker's
life, particularly during the years of the Round Table.</P>
<P>     Our story begins in Hollywood of 1945 with Parker (played by
Jennifer Jason Leigh) married to Alan Campbell (Peter Gallagher) and
writing films for which she has no respect.  She begins thinking about
the old days and the film flashes from monochrome to color.  As her
rumination opens Parker is not yet the angry literary critic she was to
become.  She was just the very cross theater critic for Vanity Fair,
though she already displayed a cynical and biting wit.  She is fired
for writing reviews that were too negative.  Her husband (Andrew
McCarthy) has returned from the war.  In his weakened state as a drunk
and a morphine addict he is no match to trade insults with his
distinguished.  Dorothy has lost her taste for him as she would lose it
for just about everything else in life, everything but her close circle
of friends.</P>
<P>     These friends meet for lunch daily in the Algonquin and soon form
the tight literary clique that would become the Round Table.  The put-
downs would come fast and furious.  One might pat another's bald head
and say something like "It feels just like my wife's behind."  The bald
man would feel his own head and say "Why, so it does."  We follow
Parker through a torrid love affair--as passionate as Parker would ever
feel about anything--with newspaperman Charles MacArthur (Matthew
Broderick).  But the great love of Parker's life is critic and comedian
Robert Benchley (Campbell Scott), who carefully remains only a platonic
friend.  In fact, he probably deserves awards for remaining that close
to a woman who seems to have a double entendre for a personality.
Parker seems to have a real affection for dogs and none whatsoever for
people.  Even so, she always seemed to have a current man and a current
dog.  Eventually there would be just the dog.</P>
<P>     Leigh studied what few recordings there are of Parker's voice to
imitate exactly the irritating, affected elocution that Parker herself
used--a near relative of the speaking style Leigh used in THE HUDSUCKER
PROXY.  The acting is quite good, but it is less then pleasant to share
a room with this person for over two hours.  Campbell Scott is a little
more pleasant to watch as Robert Benchley though he is a too thin to
look like Benchley in the old comedy shorts.</P>
<P>     The script by director Alan Rudolph and Randy Sue Coburn jumps
around in time with a latterday Parker offering bleak little humorous
poems as commentary on the action--or lack thereof--of the film.  The
film works as a detailed portrait of someone whom you would not want to
meet in real life.  This is sort of a literary SID AND NANCY which
tells you more than you want to know about a person about whom there is
less than meets the eye.  The other members of the Round Table are of
more interest, of course.  I would rate it a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
