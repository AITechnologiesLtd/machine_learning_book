<P>     Throughout the history of cinema, Hollywood has brought together
screen pairings whose natural chemistry and camaraderie have caused
instant acceptance by audiences.  Abbott and Costello. Laurel and Hardy.
Hope and Crosby. Martin and Lewis. Matthau and Lemon.  Woody and
Wesley... or at least that's what Columbia Pictures is trying to sell
with MONEY TRAIN (apparently banking on the success of WHITE MEN CAN'T
JUMP).  Personally, I'm not buying.</P>
<P>     It's probably not fair to blame the two leads entirely for the
utter failure of MONEY TRAIN.  While neither gives a performance that
pundits are going to rave about at Oscar time, none of the above duos
could have done much better with the drivel that passes for Doug
Richardson and David Loughrey's script.  And, as if that isn't bad
enough, Joseph Ruben directs this in the most stultified, poorly-paced
manner possible.  Call it "How to turn an action film into a Sominex
alternative."</P>
<P>     I went into MONEY TRAIN hoping for an action flick that wouldn't
require much thought.  What I got instead was a movie into which no
thought had been invested.  As for the action--well, it's there,
provided you're willing to sit through nearly ninety minutes of insipid
romance and routine sibling rivalry.  The bulk of this film isn't
clever, charming, original, dramatically successful, or humorous.
Laughable, yes, but not humorous.  There isn't even any nudity to liven
up proceedings.  Only the final fifteen minutes (with a runaway subway
train) generate any momentum, but that's a little too late to save the
film.</P>
<P>     MONEY TRAIN has one of those plots where it's fun to guess what's
coming next, because you'll always be right.  If you aren't, you haven't
seen many movies.  The film starts out by introducing us to foster
brothers John (Wesley Snipes) and Charlie (Woody Harrelson).  Not only
do these two share a history, but they're both transit cops assigned to
the subway beat.  The "subtle" rivalry between them erupts into open
warfare when both are smitten by their new partner, Grace Santiago
(Jennifer Lopez).  Meanwhile, Charlie has piled up some serious gambling
debts, and begins to consider robbing the Money Train (the train that
collects all the money throughout the New York City subway system) as a
way out of his situation.  The unremitting nastiness of Captain
Patterson (Robert Blake), who will sacrifice men's lives just to keep
the train on time, makes it easy for the audience to sympathize with
Charlie's criminal plans.  Most of that sympathy goes away, however, as
we see what a real jerk Charlie is.</P>
<P>     The best way to watch MONEY TRAIN, if you must watch it, is to
bring a bunch of friends to a late showing (when there's no one else in
the theater), then ridicule the movie MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000-
style.  Otherwise, the experience will be right up there with listening
to someone scrape their fingernails across a chalkboard for an hour and
a half.  As for Wesley and Woody, after this debacle, about the only
famous pair they resemble is Beavis and Butthead.  Take your pick which
is which.</P>
