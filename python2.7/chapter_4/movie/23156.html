<P>     That irritating sound you'll be hearing for the first 20 minutes of
HANGING UP -- more or less non-stop-- is the ringing of phones. They ring
on walls, in cars, in purses and on fax lines. They ring for calls from
business associates and family members. Then they ring again on call
waiting. In the context of the film, you could say the ringing phones
represent the distractions that keep us from focusing on what really
matters. Or maybe they stand for the way we can talk and talk and talk
without ever really communicating. And in the context of the film, either
message would be painfully ironic. HANGING UP is an extruciatingly awkward
piece of film storytelling -- a movie full of distractions from what
really matters, a movie that talks and talks and talks without ever really
communicating.</P>
<P>     From the film's marketing campaign, you'd probably expect HANGING UP
to be the story of the semi-dysfunctional Mozell family: aging and ailing
former Hollywood screenwriter Lou (Walter Matthau) and his daughters
Georgia (Diane Keaton), Evie (Meg Ryan) and Maddy (Lisa Kudrow). In fact,
it's essentially the story of Evie, a woman juggling responsibility for
her business, her own family and the ever-more-dependent Lou. While
Georgia publishes a glossy women's magazine in New York and Maddy works
as a soap opera actress, Evie is left with the growing burden of an
alcoholic father she has cared for since her mother left.</P>
<P>     The bulk of the film finds Evie becoming ever more flustered as she
prepares a women's business conference for her event planning company,
worries that Lou is going to die at any moment, frets over whether her
latest fender-bender can be settled without going through her insurance
and tries to get some support from Maddy and Georgia. It's all about Evie,
and Ryan does her perky, weepy best trying to make Evie's plight matter. 
Too bad HANGING UP is such a muddle of shifting tones and undeveloped
relationships that Ryan's manic performance reeks less of frustration over
her life than desperation over the script. Every scene feels aborted in
mid-thought, leaving little but the spectre of Matthau trying to give some
hammy charm to a character that's alternately eccentric-annoying and
creepy-annoying.</P>
<P>     Eventually, perhaps out of sheer boredom with Evie's story, HANGING
UP turns to the interaction between the three sisters once they're finally
brought together by Lou's most recent turn for the worse. By that time
it's far too late to make that interaction convincing or endearing, since
both Keaton and Kudrow are playing gross caricatures of self-absorption.
Georgia and Maddy exist basically as props for Evie's self-realization,
appearing only when Evie needs to become aware that she's the only one
working at preserving family relationships. It's inevitable, then, that
every moment between the sisters feels false, every grating attempt at
bickering, bittersweet reconciliation or playful kitchen food-fighting
serving as a reminder that you were expecting a movie about the ties that 
bind. What you get instead is a movie about people who all signed up to
be in the same movie.</P>
<P>     There are so many things wrong with HANGING UP -- the stilted script
by Delia and Nora Ephron, the wretched editing, Matthau's depressing
shtick -- that it seems absurd to pick out one moment of epic
miscalculation. Nevertheless, that dubious distinction goes to a flashback
scene between Evie and her estranged mother (Cloris Leachman). Evie tracks
her mother down several years after she has left the family, and finds a
less than enthusiastic welcome. It's a pivotal moment, one that will
explain any number of issues in Evie's life ... and it's dispatched in a
matter of seconds, with Leachman delivering about a half-dozen lines of
dialogue. That sort of incomplete, abrupt storytelling defines HANGING UP,
a film that becomes such a fragmented collection of life moments that it's
virtually impossible for the whole thing not to give you a headache. That
irritating sound you'll be hearing after the phones finally stop ringing
in HANGING UP is the dissonant buzz of movie that never has a point. </P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 phone-y baloneys:  3.</PRE>
