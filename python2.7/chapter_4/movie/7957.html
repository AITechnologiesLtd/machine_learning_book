                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>Starring: Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia
Arquette, Jeffrey Jones, Bill Murray. Screenplay: Scott Alexander and
Larry Karaszewski. Director: Tim Burton.</P>
<P>Ed Wood is a man with an impossible dream, a Don Quixote of the movies.</P>
<P>This man made movies that nobody wanted to see because they were darn
awful. He is a man with a childlike naivety about life and movies, who
is unable to see how bad his productions actually were. Despite his
continued failures, he persists with his dream to make pictures that he
wanted to see. To become the Orson Welles of sci-fi\ horror flicks. One
cannot help but admire his persistence and dedication, but at the same
time be dismayed and heartbroken at his inability to learn from his
mistakes.</P>
<P>He is a man with all heart and vision. A dreamer who is driven by his
great passion and love for film making; but somehow, in the midst of his
shabby directing, all of his good intentions become blurred and
misplaced. That perhaps his talent lay not in the quality of his movies,
but in the heart of the man himself.</P>
<P>He is in essence a child with a dream. Despite numerous failures and
poor quality work, it is the dream which matters and that cannot be
taken from him. To remain true to himself and what he believed in.</P>
<P>Sensitive direction from Burton, and exceptional performances by Landau
and Depp.</P>
<P>Rating: A failed artist who would sing 'Don't cry for me Hollywood' on a
burning flying saucer over L.A.</P>
