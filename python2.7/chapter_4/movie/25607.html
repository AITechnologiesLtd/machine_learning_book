<P>THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE</P>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Des Mcanuff
Written by: Ken Lonergan, Jay Ward (characters)</P>
<P>All right, I'm going to keep this plot summary pretty short because frankly 
there wasn't much of a plot to summarize. I guess that was the one part of 
the movie that was true to the television show. It's the new millenium, and 
Rocky and Bullwinkle are still trapped in reruns after 35 years, lamenting 
the loss of their forest. Meanwhile, Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro), Boris 
(Jason Alexander), and Natasha (Rene Russo) have escaped into the real world 
by signing a contract for a film deal. The film deal doesn't work because 
the producer doesn't like movies about moose. That hardly matters however, 
because Fearless Leader has hatched a plan to take over the United States by 
turning everyone into mindless vegetables through hypnotic television shows 
(not that anyone should notice the difference, someone points out). FBI 
Agent, Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo), is assigned to stop the notorious trio 
by bringing Rocky and Bullwinkle out of reruns and into the real world. 
Things don't go quite as planned however, because Rocky can't seem to fly 
anymore, and Bullwinkle seems to have grown even dumber (assuming that's 
possible). Nevertheless, the three start a cross country journey to get to 
New York in time to stop Fearless Leader from convincing the entire United 
States to elect him president.</P>
<P>Well, Boris and Natasha may not have been able to stop Moose and Squirrel 
back in the '60s, but Des Mcanuff (who produced the wonderful "The Iron 
Giant") and Ken Lonergan (who wrote the hilarious "Analyze This") managed to 
stop them with this piece of tripe. Moose and Squi- sorry, Rocky and 
Bullwinkle were really quite amusing back in the old television series. The 
episodes were full of clever puns, witty comments about society, and amusing 
slapstick comedy involving Boris, Natasha, or Bullwinkle (okay, so I never 
found Rocky to be very funny). The movie has hackneyed, stupid puns; obvious 
and unfunny social commentary (gee, people are like vegetables when watching 
television - yuck yuck); and slapstick comedy minus the amusement. Does this 
mean the movie is completely humorless? No, it just means that for every 
joke that works, ten don't. This also means that for every scene that works 
(like the courtroom scene, and there is one very funny line involving the 
explanation of where old cartoons go and gain followings), ten don't (the 
car trip to the college, the entire college scene, the ending sequence, and 
at least seven more), and this gets very tiresome after awhile.</P>
<P>"Rocky and Bullwinkle" does boast an amazing array of talent, led by the 
great De Niro himself and supported by Jason Alexander (Seinfeld) and Rene 
Russo ("The Thomas Crown Affair"). The problem is that these three great 
actors look quite embarrassed to be in this movie, and frankly, who can 
blame them? In the film's lead role we have Piper Perabo (who will soon be 
appearing in Jerry Bruckheimer's "Coyote Ugly"). I don't know where this 
girl came from, but she is one of the cutest things I have ever seen (it's 
just a shame she can't act). Keith Scott ("George of the Jungle") has taken 
over duties as Bullwinkle and the always funny narrator, and the change is 
barely noticeable. We are also granted a host of well known actors in 
useless cameos. We get Whoopi Goldberg as a judge, Kel Mitchell and Keenan 
Thompson as college buddies, Randy Quaid as the head of the FBI, John 
Goodman as a state trooper, and so on (Janeane Garolfalo, Carl Reiner, David 
Alan Grier, etc.). The list goes on forever, but all these cameos amount to 
just about nothing because they are all given no screen time. The only two 
who make any sort of impression are John Goodman (because he always makes an 
impression) and Janeane Garofalo (because she gets one of those rare 
semi-amusing scenes). It was actually quite sad to see such a talented cast 
wasted.</P>
<P>"Rocky and Bullwinkle" is guilty of one other massive travesty. One so 
unspeakably terrible I'm loathe to mention it. Sherman and Mr. Peabody 
aren't present anywhere in the movie. I'll give you a minute to let that 
soak in. I have to wonder how Ken Lonergan found a way to fit in so many 
celebrity cameos but didn't remember to stick the most beloved characters 
(in my opinion anyway) from the original television show. Okay, my rant is 
over, or as Mr. Peabody would say, "Quiet you." "Rocky and Bullwinkle" 
features a subdued, barely present soundtrack, which was actually a nice 
change from the recent obnoxiously loud soundtracks I've been hearing. One 
final note: despite the fact that there is more than a decade's difference 
between "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" and "The Adventures of Rocky and 
Bullwinkle", the former features more seamless interaction between the 
animated characters and the real ones. The movie runs only 88 minutes, but 
it felt like it should have ended at 60 or so. I'd recommend it only to 
people who adore animated/live action movies and give it two and a half out 
of five stars.</P>
