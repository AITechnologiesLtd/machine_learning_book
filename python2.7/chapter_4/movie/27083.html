<P>Taylor Hackford's new drama, "Proof of Life," bears more than a passing 
resemblance to 1999's Harrison Ford-Kristen Scott-Thomas box-office dud, 
"Random Hearts." Although their storylines are very much different, both 
pictures feature an attractive, mature pair of actors in a movie that 
gradually turns into a romance. The problem with "Proof of Life," however, is 
the same problem that "Random Hearts" had, which is that the movie is just 
not a solid or effective example of successful filmmaking. Frigid and dreary, 
"Proof of Life" yearns to develop a touching romance between two people that 
can't, and probably shouldn't, get together, but we as the audience simply 
don't care about the outcome. The fact that stars Russell Crowe (2000's 
"Gladiator") and Meg Ryan (1998's "You've Got Mail") entered into the 
tabloids while filming due to a real-life romance that blossomed between the 
two, should have at least made the on-screen proceedings charismatic and 
lively, but they are not. The whole movie, ambitious as it may be, 
relentlessly flaps there like a fish suddenly pulled out of the water, 
gasping for its last few breaths.</P>
<P>Based on both a "Vanity Fair" article by William Prochnau, and a book by 
Thomas Hargrove entitled "The Long March to Freedom," Meg Ryan stars as Alice 
Bowman, a woman living in South America with her husband, Peter (David 
Morse), a dam engineer. Alice yearns to return to the U.S. and get back to 
her own life, but Peter keeps them put, as he is too dedicated on his latest 
project to give it up. When Peter is unexpectedly kidnapped by a group of 
guerilla-terrorists, being held for a $3-million ransom, expert hostage 
negotiator Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe) is hired to ensure that he is not 
killed. But first, Terry insists that his newest clients give him and Alice 
proof that Peter is still alive. As the days tick by and Peter grows 
increasingly weak, weary, and bearded, Alice and Terry form a close, platonic 
work relationship that threatens to turn into something more.</P>
<P>That final piece of the premise is actually so inconsequential and 
next-to-non-existent up until the final twenty minutes of the lumbering 
135-minute running time that director Taylor Hackford fails miserably when he 
attempts to inject bittersweet poignancy to the final scene. As played out, 
it is entirely ineffectual and only leaves you wondering what, exactly, the 
point was.</P>
<P>What comes beforehand really isn't much better. While the plot is adequately 
intriguing and could have certainly been made into a genuinely suspenseful 
pot-boiler, the deliberately slow pace evaporates whatever tension might have 
been evoked with a stronger screenplay and tighter editor. The film simply 
sits there, immobile, for ridiculously long stretches that include exposition 
scene after exposition scene so poorly conceived you are akin to forgetting 
what was said by the next sequence.</P>
<P>In an obvious attempt to break free of the cutesy romantic comedies she is 
best known for, the usually reliable Meg Ryan is surprisingly mediocre as the 
grieving Alice. Either overacting to the point of annoyance, striking a 
superficial performance note, or misreading her character's supposed 
motivations, this is not one of Ryan's high points as an actress. It isn't 
entirely her fault, though; the role is so thanklessly two-dimensional that 
she does very little throughout but look upset and hold a cigarette (which, 
oddly enough, she not once is ever shown inhaling).</P>
<P>The supporting roles are stronger and more assured, but equally 
underdeveloped. David Morse (2000's phenomenal "Dancer in the Dark") is put 
through a great ordeal as he is shown being held captive and being put 
through torture from the beginning to end of the movie, but does little else. 
Pamela Reed (1990's "Kindergarten Cop"), as Peter's worried sister, is 
particularly funny and gets most of the good scenes in the first half. 
Finally, David Caruso, as Terry's wisecracking partner, is wasted.</P>
<P>There is one asset of "Proof of Life" that saves it from being an all-out, 
big-budget disaster. Russell Crowe, in his first starring role since the 
critically-acclaimed, audience-favorite "Gladiator," proves yet again why he 
is quickly becoming one of the most popular male actors in showbiz. So 
self-assured and brilliant in every respect, Crowe carries himself with a 
red-hot intensity that cannot be denied, and his work as Terry Thorne is yet 
another masterful turn in his gradually rising and hugely respectable 
filmography. Although his character, like all of the others, gets very little 
help from the thin written page, he is able to flesh out his role immensely 
just by a simple look, or the way he handles his lines. From 1992's "Romper 
Stomper," to 1997's "L.A. Confidential," to 1999's "The Insider," Russell 
Crowe does not play his characters as much as he lives and breathes through 
his personal creation of them. Simply put, he is the most talented actor 
appearing in films today.</P>
<P>Take Russell Crowe away from "Proof of Life" and what you ultimately have is 
a complete failure. Whenever he is onscreen, the film is tolerable and 
occasionally even interesting. Whenever he is absent, the movie threatens to 
drown in its own mustiness. Either way, director Hackford, whose 1997 
thriller "The Devil's Advocate" was far superior, has put a lot of time and 
money into a motion picture that adds up to very little, and practically 
screams out for a reedit. "Proof of Life" is right; without Crowe, the only 
proof of life in this unfortunate misfire would be the physical movements of 
the camera.</P>
