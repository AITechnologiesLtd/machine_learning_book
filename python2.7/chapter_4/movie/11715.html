<PRE>A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES, a languid look at a woman's liberation from
the religious ties that bind her, features a nice performance by Renee
Zellweger from JERRY MAGUIRE in the underwritten role of Sonia.  Writer
and director Boaz Yakin takes us deep into a Hasidic Jewish community
in New York City, where he manages to disparage their faith without
finding any redeeming values.</P>
<P>     Religious ridicule is guaranteed to stir up people, and it did
during the movie's filming.  But if the protestors had seen the
finished product, perhaps they would have not been so upset.  Although
Yakin shows nothing beneficial in Hasidic doctrine, his movie drifts
along so slowly and predictably that few will be moved enough to care.</P>
<P>     There are, however, some interesting portions and the previously
mentioned nice performance, but only the one.  The excellent
Christopher Eccleston, who was so incredible as the star of JUDE, plays
Sender, Sonia's brother-in-law, who floats in and out of the story.
When there, he gets to say some outrageous lines ("Piety is the
standard by which we are judged, but it is the quality of our sins that
set us apart"), have a fast bit of illicit sex with Sonia up against
the nearest wall, and then disappear again.</P>
<P>     Sonia is married to the ultra pious Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald),
whose biggest fear appears to be that Sonia might enjoy marital sex.
He interrupts his own foreplay with her to start praying.</P>
<P>     Sonia, it turns out is the daughter of one of the best gemologist
in the state.  Sender makes her the operator of his illegal "cash
business", in which he sells jewelry to the local Jewish community out
of a basement guarded by a fake wino.  This whole arrangement angers
Mendel, but being a classic wimp, he mainly complains and whines about
it.</P>
<P>     One of the story's better scenes has the men and boys arguing the
fine points of the Torah around the dinner table.  Fast paced and
smartly written it has the energy that the other parts of the film
badly lack.  It also shows clearly how the men and the women exist in
parallel communities much as the men and women do in GOODFELLAS.</P>
<P>     A major problem with the script is the abrupt change in Sonia's
character after she gets a job.  One minute the severely repressed
woman is having anxiety attacks so terrible that she appears in danger
of catching fire.  And the next she is a strong woman, being a
super-tough negotiator with the jewelry suppliers and having sex with
her employer on whatever table is convenient.</P>
<P>     The picture takes great pains to look authentic and to set a
serious tone, which makes the story's two apparitions - Sonia's dead
brother Yossi (Shelton Dane) and a mysterious beggar (Kathleen
Chalfant) - seem so out of place.  Yossi appears, for example, to
remind Sonia when she eats an egg roll with "pig" in it that she is
going to hell.  The beggar, who may or may not be real, makes even less
sense.</P>
<P>     The ending appears designed almost as an after thought, and it
fails to work on several levels.  With its coldly antiseptic tone, the
movie seems more interested in preaching awkwardly to the audience that
inviting it in.  Typical is Sonia's little homily in which she tells
us, "Sometimes I look at men and wonder how God could have created so
ugly a creature for women to cling to?"</P>
<P>     A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES runs 1:57.  It is rated R for sex, profanity,
and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
