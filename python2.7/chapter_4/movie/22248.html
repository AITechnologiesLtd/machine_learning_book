<P>Holy crap!  Holy Smoke is a holy mess!  Writer/director Jane Campion
still seems unable to return to the form that made her an Oscar winner
in 1993.  Since The Piano, Campion has cranked out the abysmally drab
The Portrait of a Lady and now Holy Smoke, which is definitely not a
step in the right direction by any stretch of the imagination.</P>
<P>The opening credits begin promisingly enough, using slow-motion shots of
India placed over a rockin' Neil Diamond track.  Once the story kicks
off, we learn that an Australian girl named Ruth (Kate Winslet, Hideous
Kinky) went to Delhi for vacation and never came home, apparently
choosing to live her life with the followers of some guy with Baba.
Naturally, her suburban Sydney family is distraught, and they try to
lure Ruth home so she can be deprogrammed by a `cult exiter' from Los
Angeles named PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel, Three Seasons).</P>
<P>The first step of the plan is for Ruth's asthmatic mother (Julie
Hamilton) to travel to Delhi to tell her that her father (Tim Robertson)
has suffered a serious stroke, which is just a lie to get her home.
While this is supposed to make Ruth fly back with her mum, she instead
shrugs it off and tries to get her mother to attend one of Baba's wacky
ceremonies.  Long story short, Ruth finally agrees to come home to see
her allegedly ailing father.</P>
<P>Once home, the family locks Ruth and PJ up in a second home in the
middle of the Aussie outback.  PJ explains that his technique generally
takes three days and that he has saved 189 souls during his career, with
a whopping 97 percent success rate.  Ruth is still obviously reluctant,
and after this forty-minute setup is complete, Smoke concentrates its
focus on its two acting leads.  This is when the film goes downhill –
fast.</P>
<P>You can guess what happens next.  Ruth hates him as he begins to make
headway in his deprogramming, but then uses her incredible rack to turn
the tables on PJ.  Before you know it, they're going at it like a couple
of horny teenagers.  Heck, if you locked me up in a house with a
mentally unstable Kate Winslet for three days, even I could get lucky.
Well, maybe four or five days.</P>
<P>Aside from being predictable on just about every level, Smoke seems to
go out of its way to be disturbing.  Ruth and PJ hit it off sexually
when she pisses all over herself and their crazy relationship ends when
he dons a red dress and lipstick.  At times, you will wonder if Campion,
who adapted the script with her sister Anna, intended the film to be
funny or dramatic.  It's neither, so I guess her intentions really don't
matter.  The film is brutally uneven, but not without visual flare.
It's a damn colorful picture, from the incredible blue skies, to
Keitel's ghastly white ass, to his bright red lipstick.</P>
<P>Winslet makes the best of the crappy script, acting crazy enough to be
believable.  But the craziest thing about Winslet is her choice of
post-Titanic films.  First, she ran off to Marrakech in Hideous Kinky
and now India in Smoke.  Get over yourself – two lousy art films are
enough of a penance to make up for starring in the biggest blockbuster
of all-time.  The good news is that her `area' is kept a little tidier
that it was in Jude.</P>
<P>And just what does Campion have over Keitel where she can continue to
blackmail him into taking risky roles in her films?  In The Piano, he
waived his tiny wiener at the camera, and here he's in a drag for the
last third of the film.  Whatever it is, I hope the debt has been paid
off.  I can't bear to see him embarrass himself again.</P>
<P>1:54 - R for tons of nudity, strong sexuality and a litany of adult
language</P>
