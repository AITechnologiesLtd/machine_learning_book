<P>"Varsity Blues" is the best film of 1999 thus far. Unfortunately, it is 
also the first film I have seen from 1999. It is another one of those 
small-town sports movies that involves a flawed, but good-heartedfrom 
1999. It is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves 
a flawed, but good-hearted protagonist; a rough and meanspirited coach; 
and the "big game." By the end, will the underdog overcome great odds 
and triumph? Will everyone in the town turn against the coach? Will the team
win the climactic game? Do cats bathe themselves regularly?</P>
<P>The so-called "hero" in question is John Moxin (James Van Der Beek), a 
senior at West Canaan High School who plays for the varsity football 
team, but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at Brown University 
so that he can get out of the dead-end town. At least he's got the right 
idea, since West Canaan, Texas is portrayed in the film as, frankly, 
pathetic, with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the 
Second Coming. Heck, in one scene, the front page of the town's 
newspaper is proclaiming about the West Canaan Badgers' big win the 
night before. When the team's star quarterback is severely injured, 
tearing the ligaments in his leg, John finds himself taking over as the 
team's leader, but his few minutes of glory do not last long, as he 
begins to have problems with his girlfriend (Amy Smart) when she 
discovers he spent an evening with another girl (Ali Larter). And after 
staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint (all of 
the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics), the team 
loses their second-to-last game, putting John at feuds with the coach 
(Jon Voight who, like Gary Oldman, is overstaying his welcome in the 
typecasted role as the "bad guy"). Worse yet, the coach is threatening 
to ruin John's scholarship chances if the Badgers don't win their final 
game.</P>
<P>The plotting of "Varsity Blues" is as old as the hills, and contains 
every cliche in the book. Admittedly, I was never exactly bored while I 
was watching it, but I hasten to add that I was rarely ever entertained. 
Throughout, all I could really think of is how virtually the same exact 
story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity 
in 1983's "All the Right Moves."</P>
<P>One of the biggest problems I had with the film is how little of 
interest any of the characters actually were, least of all certainly not 
John, who, played by Van Der Beek (of TV's "Dawson's Creek"), is pretty 
much a bore without any engaging qualities. While I probably shouldn't 
blame this on Van Der Beek, since the inauspicious and "by-the-numbers" 
screenplay by W. Peter Iliff isn't of any help, he is still certainly 
not in the league of Tom Cruise in "All the Right Moves." The story 
revolving around John, meanwhile, is extemely thin throughout, 
particularly for its 104-minute running time, and it alternates between 
uninspired comic relief (as in when the students see their sex education 
teacher working as a stripper at the club) and heavy-handed melodrama. </P>
<P>The romance between John and his girlfriend had the potential to be an 
adequate subplot, but we also learned very little about her, which is 
unfortunate since Amy Smart, whom I don't think I've seen before in past 
films, is probably the only character written with any sort of 
intelligence. Smart does not allow her character to become the "passive 
girlfriend," instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and 
opinions. It's too bad the camera didn't linger on her long enough so we 
could hear some of those thoughts.</P>
<P>The adult characters probably fare the worse of any, since they all must 
play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but 
football. John's relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed 
far in advance. His father is set on him becoming a football player at a 
university, but John doesn't want any part of that. His mother stands 
beside her "big, strong husband" and is a passive female. Finally, Jon 
Voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make 
the thankless role any more than one-dimensional.</P>
<P>Saving "Varsity Blues" from being a total washout are a few amusing 
sequences, including one set in the sex education class, which did get a 
laugh out of me. The scenes of playing football were well-shot and 
thankfully didn't overstay their welcome, as many sports films fall 
victim to. But leaving the theater, the question I had in my mind was 
why did this film need to be made? I seem to be asking this question 
quite a lot lately, since the same old stories seem to be cranking out 
of Hollywood. Do we really need another high-school sports film? No, we 
don't, and certainly not one of this low-caliber, which felt like a 
cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better, but similar, films. 
"Varsity Blues," no doubt is the first one, however, to include an 
earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped 
cream on their private parts.</P>
