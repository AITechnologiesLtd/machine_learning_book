<P>     WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO & JULIET is a version for the nineties,
with abbreviations in more places than just the title.  Fair Verona is
now Verona Beach, a sun-baked battlezone where all the young dudes carry
pistols, cruise the streets in low-riders, and pledge allegiance to one
of two rival gangs, er, households.  (An aerial shot says it all,
showing the names Montague and Capulet in giant letters across the tops
of their respective skyscrapers.) Early scenes are played at the pace of
a music video, with character introductions cunningly conducted through
the use of freeze-frames and title cards.  Down Under director Baz
Luhrmann (STRICTLY BALLROOM) sends his camera spinning in every
conceivable direction, sometimes sped-up, sometimes in slow-motion.  His
hyperkinetic style is intoxicating, but there's a catch:  the characters
speak in iambic pentameter and not always that well.</P>
<P>     The language that you learned to hate in high school spills from
many an untrained mouth.  Bill's banter is spoken, shouted, mumbled,
fumbled, and ultimately drowned out by the many sounds of the street.
No problem at first, in those explosive early scenes, such as a gas-
station shoot-out shot like a Hong Kong spaghetti western.  When the
director calms down-- and he does, regrettably-- the movie also slows
down and the badly delivered dialogue starts to sink the story, instead
of anchoring it.  (Of the young actors, only Claire Danes seems to know
what she's doing.  The best thesps over thirty are Vondie Curtis-Hall's
local police captain and Pete Postlethwaite's Father Laurence.) Another
problematic point is the plot, which isn't entirely believable by
contemporary standards.  (Romeo is sentenced to "banishment?" Huh?  And
why doesn't Juliet just run away from home?) A grand failure, yes, but
at least one that's great fun to watch.</P>
