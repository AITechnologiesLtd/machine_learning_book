<P>Leave it to Robert Rodriguez to make a high-octane kiddie pic largely set in
Mexico and full of music straight from his Hollywood calling card, El
Mariachi.  If I had seen Spy Kids as a child, it would have blown my mind,
and it's easy to envision the sequel-ready blockbuster-to-be becoming a Star
Wars for today's grammar school crowd.</P>
<P>Kids is about a brother and sister who, unbeknownst to them, are the
offspring of two of the world's top secret agents.  The film opens with
mother Ingrid (Carla Gugino, Snake Eyes) telling young Carmen (Alexa Vega)
and Juni (Daryl Sabara) a bedtime story called "The Two Spies Who Fell in
Love."  The story, of course, is a non-fictional account of how she and
husband Gregorio (Antonio Banderas, Play It To the Bone) met, fell in love
and decided to trade in a life of espionage for parenting.  They've been out
of the spy game for years but still maintain old contacts and keep up on the
latest international terrorist news.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the star of a children's Teletubby-ish TV show is threatening to
wreak havoc on the world (what would a spy film be without a guy like
this?).  It seems that Floop (Alan Cumming, Get Carter), the star of
"Floop's Fooglies," has been capturing spies and turning them into mutants
for his show.  His goal, apparently, is to create a race of atomic
super-robots that he will use to do his bidding.  Floop has a sidekick named
Minion (Tony Shalhoub, Galaxy Quest) who is the real brains of the
operation - a Sideshow Bob, if you will, to Floop's Krusty the Clown.</P>
<P>The catch is that Floop and Minion need an intelligence prototype created by
Gregorio to complete their dastardly creations.  They kidnap Gregorio and
Ingrid, leaving the two kids to rescue their parents, and the world.  Carmen
and Juni get to play with all kinds of cool gadgets and modes of
transportation that, frankly, put the recent James Bond films to shame. They
also engage in typical sibling battles with each other while they battle
Floop's henchmen and cronies.</P>
<P>The special effects in Kids range from really cheesy to quite staggering (at
least for a kids' film; we're not talking The Matrix here). Rodriguez has a
reputation of making expensive-looking films for peanuts, and he doesn't
disappoint here.  Kids cost $36 million, but it looks like two or three
times that amount was used.  To keep costs down, Rodriguez, as usual, wore
many hats on the set, serving as producer, editor, director, writer, sound
mixer and visual supervisor.  Vega and Sabara helped out by insisting they
perform most of their own stunts.</P>
<P>The casting here is pretty decent, with Vega the only real standout.  There
are a bunch of actors that contribute tiny parts (Teri Hatcher, Robert
Patrick), including some veterans of Rodriguez's other films (Cheech Marin,
Danny Trejo) and one superstar cameo from the director's From Dusk Till
Dawn.  Kelly Preston was originally cast in Gugino's role but backed out
because she had just given birth to an evil little Scientologist</P>
<P>Kids reminded me a lot of Cloak & Dagger, a similar kid-oriented spy caper
from the early '80s that starred a hot-off-E.T. Henry Thomas.  Like Dagger,
this film doesn't dumb down the action for really young kids and, as a
result, makes the picture a lot more enjoyable for older kids and adults.</P>
