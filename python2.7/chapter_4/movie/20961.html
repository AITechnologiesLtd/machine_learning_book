<P>Three Kings opens just as Desert Storm is winding down, but still, manages
to emblemize the whole war in that one opening scene, where the conflict is
pared down to its most ridiculous: the American soldier fighting the Iraqi
soldier for possession of one small little hill (mound) in the middle of the
desert. With an opening like that the movie can only get more ridiculous. It
does. It even gets side-splitting ridiculous at times, via a steady run of
one-liners, but none of it is without purpose. Journalist Adrianna Cruz
(Nora Dunn) sums it all up nicely: "The war is over and I don't know what
the hell it was about." No one seems to, especially the soldiers, our three
(four) 'kings,' whom we meet mid-celebration via the freeze-frame/subtitle
trick (Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting, Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels, etc)
that's still cool, but just barely. First there's the American soldier from
the opening scene, Troy (Mark Wahlberg), vying for main-characterhood with
Archie (George Clooney), the disillusioned special forces guy. Next there's
Chief (Ice Cube), something of a holy roller qua LL Cool J in Deep Blue Sea,
but a bit more effective. Last there's the wholly uneducated Vig (Spike
Jonze), acolyte of Troy, token Texan.
As the trailer spells out, too, soon enough the four of them get a lead on
Saddam Hussein's stolen gold, and--making the cinematic leap that stealing
from a thief isn't wrong--they set out one hot, final morning to quietly
'recover' it. But of course everything goes wrong, not the least of which is
that their consciences kick in, and they begin to figure out 'why' they're
there after all: to save refugees (i.e., be the Schindlers of the Persian
Gulf). It's no big leap from there to the convention that when the thief in
the movie is both sympathetic and gets the 'loot' early on, then that loot
will have to be traded in for something more lasting. It even happens like
that in Trapped in Paradise, a movie without all the moral clutter of a
morally-dubious war, the kind of war which, in Lethal Weapon, produced
Shadow Company, the bad guys who did essentially the same thing our three
(four) kings are doing in Three Kings.
Nevertheless, though, we know who the good guys are, who the bad guys are.
War movies tend to work like this whether they want to or not. It takes an
especially cool hand like Kubrick's to rise above it (Full Metal Jacket).
Three Kings isn't Kubrick, not quite, although it does have its own brand of
camera/editing work, which, when combined with the sepiatone cinematography
qua the Courage Under Fire flashbacks, manages both to rush everything past
and wash it out in a way we suspect accurately captures the American
soldier's experience. Or, rather, it seems to capture what we imagine the
memory of that experience must be like, which is quite a feat in itself for
director David O. Russell.
But of course this 'thirsty' cinematography could be called Peckinpah, too,
and, with Three Kings, convincingly so, as the story of these four soldiers
is almost uncomfortably similar to The Wild Bunch (Clooney as Holden, etc),
even going so far as to leave the simpleton/hick back to the guard the
prisoners, or, on a larger scale, having the good bad guys get righteous
when it really counts. And then of course too one of their own gets taken
hostage, tortured, all that. At least it strays from the path a little when
Troy--the hostage--has a few bonding-type scenes with his captor, which
writer John Ridley and Russell wisely back out of just as it was starting to
feel Crying Game-ish.
In the end, though--and beneath all the fancy camerawork perhaps meant to
appeal to an audience usually not tuned into social issues--Three Kings is
more or less a social statement: that America was motivated into the Gulf by
greed. In case we miss this, the three (four) kings become aware for us,
when they have to see firsthand the results of that war ('their
actions')--or, when Troy is forced to drink oil, which is a touch
heavy-handed, but so be it. The point gets made, at least. And it's not the
only one: after Wag the Dog, of course the media has to play a role here, in
a war fought on CNN. In this case, however--as with Electric Horsemen--that
role is a redemptive one, which dovetails nicely with the Biblical allegory
operating behind the scenes, ever so quietly. At one point a tanker of milk
even spills out into this Euphrates valley, tempting us to make all kinds of
allegorical connections. Before we can, though, Russell's rushed on to the
next scene, opted to let it all accrete when he could have dwelt on it,
which, like nearly everything else in Three Kings, was the correct decision,
the proper amount of restraint, not the easy way out. It shows. The only
thing missing is the Buffalo Springfield the trailer promised, but it's more
than made up for, simply by the pleasant surprise that the trailer only
covered the first third of the movie. Which is to say there's a lot more to
Three Kings than you go in expecting, but, too, just enough conventional
stuff that you never get lost.
