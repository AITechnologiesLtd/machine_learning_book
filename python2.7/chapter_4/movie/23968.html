Susan Granger's review of "JOE GOULD'S SECRET" (USA Films)</PRE>
<P> Actor/director/producer Stanley Tucci ("Big Night," "The
Impostors") specializes in gentle, cerebral, low-budget films about
male friendships and their consequences. This true story by Howard
Rodman celebrates the relationship between bohemian Joe Gould, who had
a gift of gab, and courtly Joseph Mitchell, who wrote his story in
"The New Yorker." Tucci plays the North Carolina-born Mitchell who
specialized in literary portraits of the denizens of New York City in
the 1940s, while Ian Holm is disheveled, cantankerous Joe Gould, a
homeless Harvard graduate sometimes known as Professor Seagull for his
penchant for reciting poetry in seagull cawing. Gould was also the
author of "The Oral History of the World," which he would offer up in
return for $2 contributions to "The Joe Gould Fund," since a man needs
whiskey, beer, and cigarettes if he's going to talk all
night. Mitchell made the demented panhandler, a tormented soul, into a
Greenwich Village celebrity. Mitchell was a gifted listener and his
wife, played by Hope Davis, was a noted photographer. Stanley Tucci
composes scenes in the style of the great street photographers of old
New York, but this film is not cinematic in scope, relying, instead,
on long, talky scenes as opposed to quick cuts. And the titular secret
is part of the enigmatic character study, not a mystery. Stanley Tucci
delivers a droll, deliberately understated performance, while Ian
Holm, not inappropriately, chews the scenery, drawing attention by
table-top proclamations like: "In the winter I'm a Buddhist; in the
summer, I'm a nudist." Susan Sarandon and Steve Martin do distracting
cameos. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Joe Gould's Secret" is
a rambling, poignant, bittersweet 7, aimed at sedate art house
audiences.</P>
