<PRE>The Edge (1997, R)</PRE>
<P>Directed by Lee Tamahori (Mullholland Falls)</P>
<P>Written by David Mamet (The Spanish Prisoner)</P>
<P>Starring Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs), Alec Baldwin (The Juror),
Elle MacPherson (If Lucy Fell), Harold Perrineau Jr. ("Oz")</P>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>What do you get when you combine a bear, a man that may or may not want to
kill another for his wife, and an entrapanuer with a seemingly infinite
wealth of knowledge? Ask me that a month ago and I'd say that I wouldn't see
a movie with that plotline if you paid me. But after a barrage of good
advertising and even better hype, I decided that I'd go see it.
What a surprise.</P>
<P>The movie starts slow, but with that kind of unwritten tension in the air
that only a good writer can accomplish. It picks up speed quickly, spending
maybe half an hour on the intro and character development to the final crash
(due to an in-air collision with a flock of birds) which kills the pilot and
leaves Harold Perrineau Jr. ("Oz"), Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins alive
to fend in the wilderness with a knife and six matches.</P>
<P>Things would go better except for the fact that there is a Kodaik bear, a
mankiller who is stocking them, giving off all of the personality of a
psychopath and making us hate him as much as we could hate any human
villain.</P>
<P>Though the plot is completely made of old movies, this is one that is done
so well that it surpasses any old no-tech thriller that I've ever seen. It
goes into the realm of movies that are made good but have tremendous
potential to be bad. It's worth seeing any day of the week.</P>
