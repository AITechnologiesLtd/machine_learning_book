<P>Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" is an interesting and attractive action movie, but 
not a very forceful one. It needs to spend more time with the gladiator 
himself. This is a "hero out for revenge" picture that keeps cutting away to 
its cardboard villain, just as we're starting to cheer on the protagonist. 
It's like channel-hopping between "Spartacus" and "Caligula".</P>
<P>Russell Crowe stars as Maximus, a Roman army general under emperor Marcus 
Aurelius (Richard Harris). Marcus is so impressed by Maximus's leadership 
that he appoints him as his successor. His son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is 
not best pleased by this news, as he himself had expected to be next in line 
for the throne. Commodus kills his father, seizes power, and orders the death 
penalty for Maximus and his family.</P>
<P>Of course, Maximus escapes this fate, but his wife and child do not. Then 
Maximus is kidnapped and sold into slavery. His master, Proximo (Oliver 
Reed), forces him to become a gladiator, and when his military training leads 
to great slaughtering talent, Proximo takes him to Rome, to perform at the 
Coliseum. There the crowd falls in love with him, which forces Commodus into 
an awkward position; yes, he's found Maximus, but he can't deal with him, 
because if he kills him then he'll lose the support of his people.</P>
<P>The movie is basically taken up by Maximus and Commodus doing a lot of 
plotting against each other, punctuated by lofty speeches and gruesome 
fights. That is as it should be. The problem is that we don't spend enough 
time with Maximus -- the film is divided pretty much equally between him and 
the enemy, when it needs to be much more single-minded. Look at "Ben-Hur" or 
"Braveheart" -- these films are driven completely by their heroes' 
determination, and that's why we get emotionally involved. Crowe gives a 
great performance as Maximus -- he has a penetrating stare, commanding voice, 
muscular body and towering demeanour. He's a powerful, passionate Hollywood 
lead, and we want to invest our care in him. We just don't get the chance.</P>
<P>Because "Gladiator" never gets us wrapped up in Maximus's struggle, the 
action sequences are not as tense or affecting as they should be. We can't 
simply enjoy the excitement of the violence, either, because it's not 
stimulating, it's sick. Roman bloodlust is one of the most shameful things in 
history, and Scott, the director, presents it realistically, throwing us into 
the middle of gladiator fights by way of giddy close-ups and shutter speeds, 
while the chants of the despicable onlookers thunder at our ears in stereo 
surround sound.</P>
<P>What we have here, ultimately, is one amazing piece of acting and several 
flourishes of wonderful technique, spoiled by unwanted distractions. The 
overall bold, colourful nature of the filmmaking might have been enough to 
recommend the picture if its better parts hadn't led us to expect something 
superior. Strange: "Gladiator" would have been a more enjoyable movie if it 
had been made with less skill.</P>
