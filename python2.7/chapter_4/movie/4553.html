<P>     Following six James Bond movies with Sean Connery (and one with the 
dead-on-arrival George Lazenby), it was difficult -- to say the least -- 
for fans to accept the transition to wisecracking Roger Moore when he 
debuted in 1973.  It didn't help that his introductory film was one of 
the worst Bonds of all time (ranking alongside Moore's OCTOPUSSY and 
Timothy Dalton's THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS).  Worse still, the only thing 
about LIVE AND LET DIE to weather the test of time is its title song 
(written by Paul & Linda McCartney, and performed by Wings).</P>
<P>     After dealing with SPECTRE and megalomaniacs for his first seven 
films, Bond is pitted against a different kind of villain in LIVE AND 
LET DIE -- the conscienceless Dr. Kananga (Yaphet Kotto), the ruler of a 
small Caribbean island and would-be monopolistic heroin supplier.  When 
three British agents are murdered, Bond is sent to investigate.  With an 
assist from old pal Felix Leiter (David Hedison, the only man to play 
the role more than once), 007 begins his scrutiny of Kananga.  The 
resulting search leads him from Harlem to the Louisiana bayous, and has 
him meeting a beautiful Tarot priestess named Solitaire (Jane Seymour), 
a sinister voodoo doctor (Geoffrey Holder -- the man with the golden 
laugh), and a modern-day Captain Hook (Julius W. Harris).</P>
<P>     Without KGB agents and the threat of worldwide destruction, this 
007 adventure seems lame and misplaced.  LIVE AND LET DIE sees Roger 
Moore groping for the right tone for his Bond -- half the time, he 
appears to be attempting to imitate Connery (although this could be the 
fault of the screenplay).  At least Moore  has a modicum of screen 
presence, which is more than can be said of two other Bonds:  Lazenby 
and Dalton.</P>
<P>     Of all the Bond adventures, this is the most dated.  One look at 
the film and it's obvious it was filmed in the '70s.  Because much of 
the action takes place on U.S. city streets, the haircuts and dress 
styles of the time are distressingly apparent.  George Martin's score 
only adds to the "leisure suit flavor", proving that the definitive Bond 
composer is John Barry. (This was the first 007 feature that Barry 
didn't have a direct hand in scoring.)</P>
<P>     As is often the case with Bond movies, this one runs too long.  
There is a speedboat chase that, aside from being executed in a 
pedestrian fashion, goes on forever.  It's not exciting, and the 
introduction of comic asides with Sheriff J. W. Pepper (Clifton James) 
are wildly out-of-place.  Pepper (who returned in THE MAN WITH THE 
GOLDEN GUN), a tough-talking, bigoted buffoon, is fitfully amusing, but 
the character would be more at home in BENNY HILL than with James Bond.  </P>
<P>     LIVE AND LET DIE has the requisite action scenes and several 
enticing women for Bond to woo (including a CIA agent played by Gloria 
Hendry and Jane Seymour in her first screen appearance), but, in 
addition to missing Connery's presence, the movie lacks the usual 
tension and energy. Watching LIVE AND LET DIE isn't a complete waste of 
time, but there's no overriding reason why anyone should go out of their 
way to see it unless they're a die-hard Bond fan or are curious about 
Roger Moore's first turn in the role.</P>
