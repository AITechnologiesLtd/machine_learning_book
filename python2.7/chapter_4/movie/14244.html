<P>_Simon_Birch_ (PG) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Aside from the fleeting presences of big screen talent such as Ashley Judd
and Jim Carrey, there's little in this modest, engaging, yet cloying drama
to distinguish it from, as my guest at the screening said, "a
_Hallmark_Hall_of_Fame_ movie."  "Suggested by" John Irving's novel
_A_Prayer_for_Owen_Meany_ (joining the ranks of Disney's other loose
adaptations of books: _Up_Close_&_Personal, "suggested by" a biography on
late newswoman Jessica Savitch; and, most notoriously,
_The_Scarlet_Letter_, "freely adapted" from the Nathaniel Hawthorne
classic), _Simon_Birch_ tells of the friendship between two very different
12-year-old boys in the 1960s: the tiny title character (Ian Michael
Smith), the smallest delivery ever recorded in his town; and Joe (Joseph
Mazzello).  The two stick together through laughs and tears while at the
same time searching for elusive answers: the identity of Joe's father and
Simon's true purpose as, according to him, "God's instrument."</P>
<P>_Simon_Birch_ features from impressive performances by a glowing Ashley
Judd (as Joe's foxy mother), Oliver Platt (as Judd's boyfriend), and
especially Mazzello and newcomer Smith.  The pair's emotionally charged
scenes are affecting because of their unforced, heartbreaking performances,
and not the often treacly, TV-movie-level writing and direction of
first-timer Mark Steven Johnson, who also overdoes the slapsticky comedy
scenes.  _Simon_Birch_ is a sweet little film, but it may be a bit too
sweet for its own good.</P>
