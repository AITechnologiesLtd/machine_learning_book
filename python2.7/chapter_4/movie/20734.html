<PRE><HR></PRE>
<P>"No person (shall) be subject for the same offense to be twice put in
jeopardy of life or limb..." --  Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States.</P>
<P>A very liberal interpretation of that amendment serves as the basis for
the new Paramount feature, DOUBLE JEOPARDY.  Ashley Judd (SIMON BIRCH)
stars as Libby Parsons, a devoted mother whose life gets turned upside
down when her affluent husband is declared dead and she is charged, then
convicted, of his murder.</P>
<P>Her life takes another spin when, from behind bars, she discovers that
her young son and the woman to whom she entrusted his care have
disappeared.  When she finally tracks them down, she gets the biggest
surprise of all.  Her husband is apparently not dead, which means that not
only is she serving time for a crime she did not commit, she is serving
time for a crime that never took place.  The good news (if you want to
call it that) is that since she has been convicted and punished for
killing her husband, thanks to the Fifth Amendment she is now free to
really kill him without fear of legal consequence (or so we are led to
believe.)</P>
<P>Director Bruce Beresford (DRIVING MISS DAISY) breezes through these
premise setting introductory scenes as if he were power walking with the
wind at his back.  With the exposition so speedily dispatched, we can
settle in for the real meat of the movie which takes place six years later
as Libby attempts to find her son.   A task made more difficult due to the
relentless pursuit of her parole officer, Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones,
VOLCANO).</P>
<P>  But Mr. Beresford has a problem.  Because more time wasn't spent in the
beginning to involve us in the lives of these people, we aren't all that
involved in the story of which they are part.  The end result is a series
of mildly entertaining chase scenes featuring characters we hardly know
played by actors who deserve better.</P>
<P>Ashley Judd has some good moments as a mother singly obsessed with
finding her child.  She makes some odd choices at the beginning of the
film, underplaying her wrongful arrest and conviction, but once she wins
her parole, her characterization gets some legs and she is off and running
(literally).</P>
<P>One of those chasing her is the reliable Tommy Lee Jones in a role that
is becoming all too familiar for him.  We've seen him before as the
pursuer in both THE FUGITIVE and US MARSHALS.  Here, as an ex-law
professor turned parole officer, he is more embittered and less sure of
himself, but the similarities to his other films cannot be mistaken.</P>
<P>Bruce Greenwood (THE SWEET HEREAFTER) is cast as the "now you bereave
him, now you don't" husband.  Appropriately insincere and full of oily
charm, Mr. Greenwood leaves no doubt as to who the bad guy is in this film.</P>
<P>The script by David Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook (THE ROCK) is
superficial at best. The actions scenes are taut and exciting, but there
is little else for which to commend it.</P>
<P>While in prison, Libby gets some advice (some of it laughable) on what to
say to the parole board that will be what they want to hear.  While that
may have worked to her advantage in this implausible script, as believers
we are commanded to handle things differently:</P>
<P>"But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend
yourselves.  For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your
adversaries will be able to resist or contradict."  Luke 21:14-15 [NIV]</P>
<P>Standing resolutely upon the truth, building the Word of God in your
mind, and staying peaceful and calm in your heart allows God to
communicate with the spirit within you thereby teaching you what to say or
do in times of need.  No finer defense could be given.  No better counsel
could be received.</P>
