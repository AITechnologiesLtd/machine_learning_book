<P>"The search for a hero begins with something that every hero requires, a villain." 
- Vladimir Nekhorovich, "Mission: Impossible 2" </P>
<P>This is summer, and it is time for summer movies. Time for super sized
popcorns. Time to have fun. And no summer is a summer without great
action films with terrible villains and noble heroes. That's why
Hollywood produces hundreds of clichés every year to satisfy the
infinite demands of the hungry audience. To create a refreshing and
original action film in the midst of clones, is a mission:
impossible. And it is a mission that director John Woo chooses to
accept.</P>
<P>In a secret laboratory scientists, searching for a miraculous cure,
have created a monstrous virus, Chimera, that is capable of infecting
the entire planet. Realizing the incredible danger of their discovery,
the project leader, Vladimir Nekhorvich (Rade Sherbedgia) sends a
cryptic message to his contact - special agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)
of IMS Secret Service, asking for protection. If Chimera would fall
into the wrong hands, the consequences would be catastrophic. Hunt's
mission is to retrieve a sample of Chimera. This mission is made
impossible due to the fact that he is not the only person after
samples of this lethal disease. Among others is a former IMF agent
(Dougray Scott) who has already managed to steal the cure called
'Bellerophon' and now need 'Chimera' in order to pressure the
governments and acquire complete economic control over the civilized
world. In order to infiltrate and locate the terrorist group he relies
on the help of an international thief Nyah (Thandie Newton) of whom he
quickly develops a love interest. Time is not only running out for
Agent Hunt to find and destroy 'Chimera' before the terrorists get
their hands on it, but he must also find 'Bellerophon' so as to save
his love interest who has already become infected by the disease from
a terrible and rapid death.</P>
<P>This is a great action film created by the master of the genre. It's
not that the script is complex and intelligent or performances
great. It is filled with most ordinary type of action sequences: gun
fights, car chases, combat scenes. But John Woo manages to transform
these ancient clichés into sheer eye candy. The action scenes that
looked dull in 'The World Is Not Enough', explode into colorful
fireworks before your eyes in this energy packed thrill ride. In fact
every element that didn't work in 'WINE' is flourishing here. This is
James Bond resurrected. This is action revitalized. Every necessary
element is carefully inserted at the right time in the right
moment. There is enough mystery and suspense for any audience member,
and as the beautiful locations are frequently changing from elegant
Madrid to beautiful Sydney, the intensity is growing. Woo directs with
such energy and elegance that no matter how silly the plot, you're
fascinated, intrigued and stunned. Cruise is a believable hero and the
best of substitutes for James Bond. He has always been a brave actor,
willing to take chances in choosing risky parts. In the latest years,
his attempts have paid off. With his several serious roles, one in
Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' and another in 'Magnolia' (which earned him
an Oscar nomination), Cruise has established himself with the critics
as a serious actor, capable of virtually anything. Now, with 'M:I2',
he can become the hero of the box-office. He not only stars, but also
produces Woo's latest venture into the world of filmmaking. This is
Cruise-control at its best. A truly delightfully energetic
performance, that makes Bond look like a schoolboy. Dougray Scott is
Hunt's perfect nemesis. From the beginning of the film it is
established that he is one of the best agents that IMF has to
offer. He has even replaced Hunt on several missions, before he turned
to the 'dark side'. His frightening ease and cool ruthlessness, make
him lethal, capable of anything. Thandie Newton ('Beloved') is
likewise a nice choic e are not required, her purpose is simply
looking beautiful, which she does. Rade Sherbedgia and Anthony Hopkins
appear in small refreshing cameo roles. But it is Cruise who really
contribute more to the film than anyone else. It is a much more
explosive performance, than in De Palma's first installment. And the
film itself has changed along side with the main character. It has got
bigger muscles. Woo has transformed De Palma's quieter thriller into a
high energy, adrenaline-pumping adventure. The film is drained in
Woo's trademarks; deceiving appearances, mysterious events, and
incredibly elegant action sequences (the famous pigeon scene is a true
wonder). He has no respect for the laws of physics and in his world
the characters virtually fly in slow motion across the screen. Hans
Zimmer's techno score, Jeffrey L. Kimball's graceful cinematography
and Steven Kemper's fast paced editing are all achievements of the
highest artistic level that compensate for the almost complete lack of
interesting dialogue. But John Woo covers the plot up with so much
beauty, elegance and energy that the plot holes and logical
embarrassments explode before our eyes. The fans of the original might
complain, but for me this is a much more successful interpretation,
because it doesn't try to seem more clever than it is. It doesn't try
to be anything else but pure and delicate action film. And though it
is not the best that this summer has to offer ('Gladiator' was an
overall grander achievement), this is action on a grand
scale. Consider it mission accomplished.</P>
