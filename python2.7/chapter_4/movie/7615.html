<PRE>                                INDOCHINE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>There have been several films in the past that dealt with French
colonization.  ALGIERS is perhaps the finest example.</P>
<P>INDOCHINE starts slowly, as if it were merely the story of a French
woman, Ms. Devries (Catherine Deneuve), whose father and she own a
rubber plantation in VietNam, and who falls in love with a younger man
(Vincent Perez), a French naval officer.  She is the mother of an Asian
daughter (Linh Dan Pham) whom she adopted when the child lost her
parents.</P>
<P>But the film suddenly picks up its pace when it turns political, when
it shows how the French treated the Indo-Chinese as slaves, separating
families (as was done in the U.S. prior to our Civil War), how people
were weighed and examined like cattle before being sold into bondage.
Clearly, the VietNamese had enough grievances to overthrow the French
and drive them out.</P>
<P>The story takes another turn when the young man leaves Ms. Devries when
her daughter falls in love with him.  But the main story is the routing
of the French, the love stories being merely the vehicle to tell the
greater story of the war.</P>
<P>An exciting film. . . and a foreshadowing of what we encountered when
we fell into the VietNam trap from which the French had finally
extricted themselves.</P>
<PRE>In French with English subtitles.</PRE>
