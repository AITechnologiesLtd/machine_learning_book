<PRE>                                  BELLE DE JOUR
                        A film review by Christopher Null
                         Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Martin Scorcese has done us all a great service by reviving the
little-seen classic, BELLE DE JOUR, Luis Bunuel's darkly comic and
disturbing 1967 tale of Siverine (Catherine Deneuve), a woman who lives
a double life.  By evening she is the steadfast, almost-frigid wife of
a famed French doctor (Jean Sorel).  By day, she is "Belle de
Jour"--her new "stage name" at an exclusive Parisian brothel.</P>
<P>     Bunuel weaves masterfully through scenes of Siverine's hum-drum
existence with her cold husband, her surreal day job as a wanton
prostitute, flashbacks to her childhood, and bizarre daydreams of her
humiliation, bondage, rape, and torture.  Deneuve is exquisite, playing
one of the most difficult roles imaginable with her characteristic
grace.  I find it incredible that this film has gone unnoticed for so
long.</P>
<P>     At the heart of BELLE is the question of how our selfish actions
affect those around us.  While Siverine's infidelity first seems
incomprehensible, it soon becomes a vital part of her being and,
eventually, degenerates into an inevitable nightmare which brings her
world crashing down.</P>
<P>     The sheer force that builds up behind the film's first scene had
me thunderstruck for its entire 100 minutes.  Deeply compelling, while
remaining tasteful and never approaching pornographic, the film is an
eerie exposi of the haunting desires that lie within us all.  You truly
have to see it for yourself.</P>
<P>     The only problems with the film were some poor post-production
values.  First was the difficulty of a scratchy print with some skipped
frames, especially noticeable during the imagery-filled daydream
sequences.  More troubling were the incomplete subtitles, which often
left out seemingly important snippets of dialogue.  Maybe they weren't
important after all, but it was enough to break the fragile mood.</P>
<P>     Regardless, BELLE DE JOUR tells a story that desperately needs to
be heard and which is even more relevant today than when it was made 28
years ago.  A true classic worthy of its highest praises, I urge you to
see it.</P>
