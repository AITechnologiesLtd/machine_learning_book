<P>   TV and movie screens are overloaded with police dramas
because cops lead exciting and dangerous lives.  Yet no film-
maker before now has dramatized the career of air traffic
controllers, who work in a profession that ranks along with
high-school teaching as among the most stressful.  Each day,
thousands of people entrust their lives to the judgement of
these brave people, who burn out so briskly that for some
their most prominent fantasy is chucking their jobs at big city
airports and transferring to small-town landing strips that
handle two or three flights a day.  I recall sitting in the waiting
lounge at Narita airport outside Tokyo, gazing at planes
coming in at the bewildering rate of one per minute.  Only
then did I appreciate the guys behind the scenes who were
directing traffic only by the blips on their radar screens,
barking orders throughout the day so that a major city can
play host to hundreds of flights in a 24-hour period without
experiencing a crash--ever.</P>
<P>   Mike Newell, who received great plaudits for his skills in
directing the delightfully comic "Four Weddings and a
Funeral," puts his talent to work in a comedy-drama filled with
fast talk, hip exchanges, moments of melodrama and no
small among of sit-com exchanges.  The film is so engagingly
offbeat for a commercial studio feature that you await a
concluding payoff, praying like the passengers on the
descending planes that this time around, Hollywood would not
compromise.  Don't expect too much.  The final half hour of
what could have been one of the more challenging studio
movies of the year is so out of character, so sappy, silly and
unbelievable, that you'll wonder what sort of audience Newell
had in mind: the type that regularly patronize the more
intimate and challenging indies; or the category that go for
the saccharine genre that helps make daytime TV a vast,
though well-populated wasteland.  </P>
<P>   The good news is that John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton
can both play unconventional roles: pitting them together in
conflict keeps the movie flowing, crackling with tension and
technique for most of its two-hour run. (Thornton, in fact, was
the recipient of the Best Support Actor Award from the Online
Film Critics Society in 1998 and Cate Blanchett, who
performs in the role of Cusack's wife, received OFCS' Best
Actress prize the same year.)  </P>
<P>   Newell, using a screenplay from Glen and Les Charles
(which includes some scenes reminiscent of the TV megahit
"Cheers," also by those writers), fills the opening displays
with a field-trip-eye view of the work done by the harried
controllers.  They speak so rapidly to the pilots that you may
wonder how the poor fliers from countries with non-Romance
languages understand a word.  Their conversations with one
another are at least as rapid, and like cops and firemen, they
form buddy-buddy attachments so strong that they go
together to bars after work and invite one another to their
backyard barbeques.  When Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton)
is introduced to the crew as its new but highly experienced
and recommended employee, the controllers think of him as
weird. He is a mysterious fellow who hardly speaks and is
known as a cowboy who once stood in the path of a landing
747 to experience the effect of a backwash--which had the
outcome of tossing the man into the air and flinging him
swiftly to the ground.  When Russell's sexy wife, Mary Bell
(Angelina Jolie), is introduced to Nick Falzone (John Cusack),
Nick's mind strays from thoughts of his sweet wife Connie
(Cate Blanchett).  One night, when Russell is out of town and
Mary is feeling lonely, Nick invites her to an Italian restaurant
where he charms her by his ability to sing.  They land
inevitably in her bed.  What follows will threaten the lives of
the pilots who depend on him, his marriage to Connie, his
entire career.</P>
<P>   While Cusack can compete with Chris Farley as a
motormouth, the show-stealer is the laconic Thornton, who
comes across as a New Age philosopher who is also
outstanding on the job at the radar controls.  His calm
reaction to news of his wife's extra-marital activities is a
product of his philosophy, making a scene in Colorado
between him and the straying husband, Nick, the most
fascinating one of the story and surprisingly credible when
compared to the absurd ending of the movie.  </P>
<P>   "Pushing Tin" is worth seeing because you don't often get
players like Cusack, Thornton and Blanchett bouncing off one
another.  And you do learn quite a bit about the people you
entrust with your lives each time you fly, whether domestic or
international, whether Continental or Delta.  Speaking of the
behind-the-scenes people who never get the recognition they
deserve, the movie's make-up personnel deserve mention for
the job they did on Cate Blanchett, transforming her image
from that of England's most famous queen to a suffering
suburban American housewife.  "Pushing Tin" is solid, offbeat
entertainment of the sort you don't often find in heavily
financed studio films.</P>
