<P>     Having already self-cannibalized the 1961 animated 101 DALMATIANS in
the successful 1996 live-action version, Disney had to look for a more
creative way to self-cannibalize in the sequel 102 DALMATIANS. In a scene
from the new, equally unnecessary film, dog rescue facility operator Kevin
(Ioan Gruffudd) and probation officer Chloe (Alice Evans) share a romantic
dinner while their respective menageries of pooches share an evening with
a video: Disney's LADY AND THE TRAMP. While Kevin and Chloe eat their
spaghetti and meatballs, director Kevin Lima intercuts snippets of LADY
AND THE TRAMP's famous "Bella Notte" bistro scene. How wonderfully
romantic Kevin and Chloe's relationship must be ... by association.</P>
<P>     102 DALMATIANS would have had to work hard to be as actively
irritating as its John Hughes-penned precursor. Instead of being actively
irritating, this one registers as merely tedious. Glenn Close returns as
Cruella De Vil, just paroled after three years in prison for her 101
DALMATIANS shenanigans. It seems she has been cured of her thirst for fur
by a new aversion therapy technique, so the aforementioned dog rescue
facility operator Kevin has no problem with Cruella stepping in as
benefactor when funds are short. Aforementioned probation officer Chloe is
suspicious, however -- rightly so, it turns out, as Cruella pulls a
FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON and reverts to her pre-therapy self. That means
dalmatians everywhere are in peril when Cruella teams up with designer
Jean Pierre Le Pelt (Gerard Depardieu) to finally create her long-desired
spotted coat.</P>
<P>     Like the first film, 102 DALMATIANS is designed primarily as a great
big love-fest between the audience members and the on-screen animals.
There are fewer puppies this time around, as well as a talking macaw
(voiced by Eric Idle) who thinks he's a dog, but there are still plenty of
cuddly canines to go around. Unfortunately, they're almost never asked to
do anything more interesting than sit around and look cuddly. Lima
(co-director of Disney's TARZAN, making his first live-action feature)
generally appears content to let the awww appeal of his canine co-stars
take the place of action, adventure or humor. You've probably passed the
age where 102 DALMATIANS would appeal to you if you no longer respond to
puppies in a movie with a shriek of, "Puppies!"</P>
<P>     That same overwhelming sense of laziness permeates the film from
start to finish. It's blessedly true that 102 DALMATIANS does not feature
a single shot of someone getting his genitals electrocuted, or any mayhem
that would bump the rating even to a PG. The slapstick is basically
harmless stuff involving dogs biting villains in the rear or Cruella's
henchman/chauffeur (Tim McInnerny) injuring and reinjuring his hands. But
there really isn't even all that much slapstick. There's a whole lot of
exposition, and it doesn't lead up to anything. In a way, up until the
final showdown on a bakery assembly line, it's all rather hypnotically
pleasant -- no off-putting violence, no real peril, and no personality.</P>
<P>     There's also the romantic sub-plot involving Kevin and Chloe, two of
the most blandly attractive characters committed to the screen since the
last Freddie Prinze Jr. movie. While Close does her best to inject some
life into the proceedings -- still playing Cruella as a drag queen icon
rather than a nasty villain -- the protagonists practically vanish into
the background. Like far too many sequels, this one just lies there
limply, practically daring you not to grant it good will based on another
movie. It's bad enough to do that when the other movie in question was
successful, but lousy. It's even worse when the good will being traded
upon comes from a truly classic cinematic moment. Not even a clip from
LADY AND THE TRAMP can make 102 DALMATIANS worth anything more than a
snore. And it doesn't help to prove that cute animated dogs are often
preferable to cute real-life dogs.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 eternal dalmatians:  4.</PRE>
