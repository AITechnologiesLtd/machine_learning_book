PSYCHO (1960)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>It is common knowledge that the reputation of some films,
even the classic ones and those generally regarded as
masterpieces, change through times. But few films suffer
because of wear as original version of PSYCHO did. Simply,
being one of, if not the, most influential film of all times
is a great burden that could produce serious, sometimes even
devastating, impact on its watchability among the newest
generations of film viewers. In the last thirty- nine years
multitudes of filmmakers had seen this film and were very
influenced by it. Those influences found way to produce
themselves in the various rip-offs, homages, spoofs
scattered all over the globe and in all kind of genres,
including even video-clips. So, today it is really hard to
find a living soul that could be spoiled about the major
plot points of PSYCHO (and it would happen even without
three unnecessary sequels and utterly pointless 1998
remake).</P>
<P>Thanks to that, PSYCHO is actually the film most often
associated with the name of its director, the great Alfred
Hitchcock. And, ironically, when it was originally released,
it was considered to be the most un-Hitchcockian of them
all. It was shot in 1960, at the zenith of Hitchcock's
career, yet it lacked many of his distinctive trademarks.
Hitchcock shot it very quickly and very cheaply, using his
second-hand crew, cast of the relative unknowns and even
distributed it as nothing more than cheap exploitation
B-thriller. Hitchcock even didn't use his trademark
technique of building suspense and instead simply shocked
the audience with totally unexpected plot twists, and
depictions of violence and sexual innuendo that was very
daring for its time.</P>
<P>Plot of the film, based on the novel by Robert Bloch, begins
in Phoenix, Arizona, where Marion Crane (played by Janet
Leigh) works as office clerk in real state agency. Marion is
utterly unhappy with her life, mostly because her lover Sam
Loomis (played by John Gavin) can't marry her because of
huge alimony owed to his ex-wife. One hot day Marion acts on
impulse and steals 40,000 US$ from one of agency's clients.
She begins her long road trip towards Sam's hometown in
California. Along the way she would make a stop at isolated
motel. There she meets the manager, lonely, sometimes odd
but basically friendly Norman Bates (played by Anthony
Perkins) whose major problem in life seems to be his
physically and mentally ill mother, living in nearby gothic
house. Her short stay in Bates motel is terminated when she
gets fatally stabbed under shower. Norman, convinced that
his pathologically jealous mother committed the crime, hides
the body and all traces of Marion. However, Milton Arbogast
(played by Martin Balsam), private detective sent by the
agency to retrieve the stolen money, tracked Marion to the
motel. And Marion's sister Lila (played by Vera Miles) is
also more than eager to find what actually happened to her
sibling.</P>
<P>PSYCHO is not just the one of the most popular or
influential films of all times. It is also one of the most
studied films, with each shot and elements being subject of
at least half a dozen monographs or even books. So, everyone
who tries to review PSYCHO has a really hard task to be
original. However, some things must be told, even at the
risk of being repetitive. So, PSYCHO was very revolutionary
film for its time. It was the first major Hollywood film to
feature women dressed in underwear; the first major
Hollywood film to feature toilet bowls and flushing water,
but the most original thing was Hitchcock's use of
protagonist who is to be killed half way through the movie.
Such practice was unheard of until that time, and it is
rarely used even today. That shouldn't surprise anyone - few
people could imagine emotional shock and disturbing effect
such demise had on the audience. The killing of Marion Crane
per se, and not the blood, gore and suspense, make PSYCHO
one of the scariest movies of all times (or to be precise,
used to make it the scariest movie of all times, since the
shock value is long gone among audience these days).</P>
<P>That killing was depicted in one of the most memorable
scenes of all times. The legendary shower scene lasts 45
seconds, but in reality was shot in a week. For some people
this scene, most remembered and most often quoted element of
the film, is the embodiment of cinematic perfection.
Brilliantly edited, with excellent use of black-and-white
photography, Bernard Herrmann's music and many tricks that
cheated censors, this scene puts audience on the emotional
roller coaster. In those 45 seconds viewers first satisfy
their voyeuristic instincts, only to be shockingly reminded
of the human mortality when the movie protagonist becomes
totally helpless, naked and unshielded. The same scene also
paved the way to future use of stereotype of "sex=death",
cliche that made PSYCHO the great grandfather of all slasher
horror movies.</P>
<P>However, the real horror of PSYCHO doesn't lie in the
graphic or shocking depictions of murders. What is most
disturbing in PSYCHO is the utter lack of foreshadowing. The
audience, same as the unfortunate heroine, didn't know where
the real danger was coming from. Slasher movies, same as
PSYCHO, scare the audience because the danger doesn't come
in the form of monsters or supernatural beings; the killings
are committed by ordinary people next door, people who might
be friendly and nice and people who might even not be aware
of their own homicidal tendencies. Such was the role of
Norman Bates, played superbly by young Anthony Perkins. That
actor portrayed conflicting emotions and made the audience
care for his character, and won sympathies that stayed until
the end. Perkins played the role of his life, but,
unfortunately, his acting triumph doomed his career -
afterwards he was often typecast, playing cheap imitations
of the same, mentally troubled character.</P>
<P>PSYCHO might be the most influential, but it is definitely
not the best film of all times. It was splendidly paced,
superbly directed by the master and still remains one of the
most memorable viewing experiences. Even the time seemed to
be kind to it, and without its own overexposure, PSYCHO
might be truly enjoyed by new generations. However, the
ending, same as with few other great Hitchcock's films,
represents a disappointment. The last, terrifying scene that
revealed the true horror of Bates' insanity, is ruined when
Lila, the last of the protagonists, escapes the fate of
their predecessors with the conventional yet unbelievable
deus ex machina. This scene is followed with the scholarly,
detailed yet overlong expose given by psychiatrist Dr.
Richmond (played by Simon Oakland) whose expert opinion
actually insults the audience - he just tells us what we
already know. Perhaps such scene was needed for 1960s
audience, unaccustomed to bizarre forms of psychotic
behaviour, but today it slows the film that would end
perfectly just with the last shot of imprisoned Norman Bates
sitting and not harming a fly.</P>
<P>PSYCHO might be not perfect, but it is still watched and
maintains its reputation, despite the fact that even those
who watch it for the first time know everything about it.
This strange fact is the ultimate viewing recommendation.</P>
