<PRE>                                FORREST GUMP
                       A film review by Ted Prigge
                        Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Robert Zemeckis
Writer: Eric Roth (based on the book by Winston Groom)
Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, 
Sally Field</P>
<P>I don't know about you, but I cringe when I hear about the "Feel Good 
Movie of the Year."  Sounds like it plays it safe and tries to do too 
much, but does guarantee a couple scenes that are so "touching," they'll 
make you recreate that scene from "Stand by Me."  But my big question is 
what in the goddam hell is Robert Zemeckis doing the "Feel Good Move of 
the Year."  But I guess doing creative black comedies just doesn't cut 
it in this business; you have to go do "Feel Good" movies to get 
superficial recognition.  Also, he put himself around the top of the 
cult film-lovers death wish by butting one of the greatest films of all 
time ("Pulp Fiction") from winning the Best Picture Oscar...AND stealing 
the direction oscar from Quentin Tarantino.  Ironically, this is 
probably at the bottom of his oeuvre.</P>
<P>"Forrest Gump" steals its idea from a Woody Allen film (a crime in the 
usual state, just look at "Last Action Hero" which stole from "Purple 
Rose of Cairo").  This one steals from "Zelig," a brilliant film about 
non-conformity which played as a perfect documentary with more laughs 
than a Chris Farley movie (a good amount for a pseudo-documentary).  It 
tells the story of a simple man, a man with a low IQ who goes through 
life screwing with everyone involuntarily: he tells Kennedy he has to 
piss; he accidentally discovers the whole Watergate thing; he gets us 
back in the Ping Pong competition in China; etc, etc, etc.  These things 
are funny.  But in between meetings with Dick Cavet, we have to put up 
with hokey melodrama, like his relationship with the paper-thing female 
character of Jenny (Robin Wright), who's name is annoyingly uttered each 
time.  If they had maybe made her more of a person OR only spent a bit 
of time with her a la Mia Farrow in "Zelig," she might have worked.  But 
she's just there to get AIDs and take off her bra for Forrest.</P>
<P>The thing that saves it, other than the acting, is the comic timing by 
Robert Zemeckis.  His comedy is so funny that it saves the film.  He 
goes for surreal comedy, subtle comedy, sight gags, intellectual jokes, 
etc.  But his drama is artificial and disgustingly hokey.  The film's 
laughs come easily, but he tries to shove the sentimentalism in our 
faces with a goddam plunger.  But, people love this.  The regular 
filmgoing population is not used to actually feeling something that's 
actually real.  If you wanna see a funny film that's touching in the 
real way, see the similar "Sling Blade," similar because it deals with 
simple protagonists.</P>
<P>Tom Hanks does a great job with his part but it's nothing I would give 
him an award for.  He was so passionate in "Philadelphia" and totally 
deserved the Oscar for that.  But this one's just for popular opinion.  
And so they can compare him to Spencer Tracey.  I would have given it to 
Travolta or Hawthorne or Freeman before Hanks.  Sinise is great as the 
resident cynic who (sniff) finds love from Forrest and gets over the 
fact that he's missing two appendages due to a war.  </P>
<P>The worst thing is the film goes for brilliance when it really isn't.  
It's good for some laughs here and there, but the laughs are only worth 
it if you have a working remote control in your hands with your thumb on 
the fast forward button so when "JENNY" comes on screen, you can 
fast-forward (not that Robin Wright is bad, but her character's an omen 
to whip out those Hefty-brand jumbo-size barfbags).  So is this a 
comedy?  A drama?  An allegory?  Kinda like a mix of the first two, but 
none of the latter.  What would the mesage be?  If you're stupid, you 
have a better life?  Better drop out of school.</P>
<P>It's not a horrible film, but it's highly overrated.  And why it grossed 
so much, I don't know.  It's "Feel Good" for about 10 minutes.  Funny 
most of the time, even if there aren't any intentional jokes in there.  
I used to like it, but I guess I matured or immatured, I dunno.  It's 
funny, but not great.</P>
