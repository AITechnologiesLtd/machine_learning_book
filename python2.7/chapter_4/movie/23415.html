<P>A review of the book "American Psycho" by Bret Easton Ellis
(New York, Vintage, 1991).  Review by Harvey Karten,
<A HREF="mailto:film_critic@compuserve.com.">film_critic@compuserve.com.</A></P>
<P>   An article on the rich and super-rich in the business section
of a recent New York Times shows that the number of rich
people in the U.S. has grown dramatically since the 1980s,
when the Reagan administration sanctified the accumulation
of wealth.  In 1983, for example, only 46,500 households had
a net worth of $10 million or more.  The figure now is
350,000.  Rex Golding is one of the individuals cited by
journalist Laura M. Hoolson in the March 3 edition of the
newspaper.  Though he controls assets of over $10 million,
he gripes, "My 6-year-old is starting to say things like, 'their
house if bigger.'"  There is simply no end to the compulsion
of large numbers of Americans to make money.</P>
<P>   Is this a bad thing?  Probably.  Think of one of the most
prominent slogans of the 1980s, "Die, yuppie scum!"  Why
the antagonism of so many to young urban professionals? 
Envy cannot be ruled out.  Nor are the sloganeers distressed
about those among the rich who have an attitude of modesty. 
The target of the expression is groups of our residents who
make their money exchanging paper rather than contributing
concrete goods (as engineers, construction workers, and
factories do) and who are so self-involved and absorbed in
spending their ill-gotten loot on luxury goods that they are
spiritually dead.  </P>
<P>   With his third novel "American Psycho"--now adapted for
an April 14 opening as a Lions Gate movie starring Christian 
Bale--Bret Easton Ellis focuses on a 26-year-old serial killer, 
Patrick Bateman, an investment banker whose yuppie friends
are so self-absorbed, so wrapped up in their accumulation of
designer clothing and dinners in high-priced, trendy
restaurants, that they ignore Bateman's confessions of his
multiple crimes against women and the homeless.  The novel
describes Bateman's acts of torment and torture so
graphically that the book was roundly denounced by feminists
and moralists as vacant pornography designed exclusively to
titillate the lowest elements of a book-reading society. At the
same time, the novel has been praised by other feminists and
moralists as a work designed to inform its readers of a
dangerous spiritual emptiness in our overly materialistic
country.</P>
<P>   The author is no stranger to commentary of this sort.  One
of his previous novels, "The Rules of Attraction," is about the
sexual posturings and agonies of three college students
during the 1980s, while his "Less than Zero," situated in the
eighties as well, highlights a bunch of kids in an affluent,
liberal arts college who at a tender age have indulged in too
many drugs, too much sex, have had too much money, and
who wind up disaffected nihilists devoid of feeling.  Ellis
cannot be accused of making broad, general statements
about the spiritual emptiness of segments of young, rich
people.  In "American Psycho," his most realized work, he
delves into the lifestyles of Pat Bateman and his circle in
excruciating detail, dropping more names of designer clothing
in just 399 pages than film critic Armond White drops names
of movies in three years of reviewing.</P>
<P>   "American Psycho" is narrated by the homicidal maniac of
its title, Pat Bateman, in a such a flat tone that you wonder
whether he is nothing more than a documentary filmmaker.
Treating one of his gruesome murders with about the same
level of emotion that he discusses a restaurant reservation or
the kinds of clothing worn by people with whom he comes in
contact, Bateman drones on in this manner:</P>
<P>   "I run into Bradley Simpson from P&P outside F.A.O
Schwartz and he's wearing a glen-plaid worsted wool suit
with notched lapels by Perry Ellis, a cotton broadcloth shirt by
Gitman Brothers, a silk tie by Savoy, a chronograph with a
crocodile skin band by Breil, a cotton raincoat by Paul Smith
and a fur felt hat by Paul Stuart."  Ellis drops literally
hundreds of names like these, assuring the reader that he
knows the society whereof he speaks.  His writing is so
entertaining in describing yuppie concerns that we are almost
sorry when he begins to describe the homicidal inclinations of
his central character--as late as page 131.  Eventually he
decorates his room with the skin and bones and brains and
hair of his innumerable female victims, some from his circle
of acquaintances, others bimbos whom he has brought over
by calling escort services.  Here is Pat Bateman's description
of his feeling toward the homeless:</P>
<P>  "I pull out a long, thin knife with a serrated edge and, being
very careful not to kill him, push maybe half an inch of the
blade into his right eye, flicking the handle up, instantly
popping the retina....with my thumb and forefinger hold the
other eye open and bring the knife up and push the tip of it
into the socket, first breaking its protective film so the socket
fills with blood, then slitting the eyeball open sideways, and
he finally starts screaming once I slit his nose in two...</P>
<P>   In moments like these, you won't be faulted for wondering
whether Ellis uses the theme of American spiritual vacuity
ingenuously to give his novel a profound, spiritual meaning--
whether he really is the pornographer that so many people
accuse him of being, interested only in arousing the baser
emotions of the readers.  Let's for the record give him the
benefit of the doubt and accept the book for what it is: a
harsh indictment of a society that is so wrapped up in
spending, on keeping up with the Joneses and spurring the
envy of its neighbors, that it has lost its spiritual center. 
Those among us who are not rich or famous or trendy can
argue that nothing in this book applies to them.  Really? 
Components of the underclass who mug people not to buy
food for their families but to afford the trendiest athletic
footwear cannot escape blame.  If you are just about getting
by comfortably, can you say with certainty that you and your
circle of family and friends genuinely feel for those outside (or
even inside) your circle--that you sympathize with the
homeless, care for the desperate, and live your life to make
the world a better place than it was before you arrived? 
Perhaps you can, perhaps not.  But that's a subject for
another novel.  Ellis--are you listening? (C) Harvey Karten,
