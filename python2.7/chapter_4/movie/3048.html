<PRE>                              I LIKE IT LIKE THAT
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Director: Darnell Martin
Starring: Lauren Velez, Jon Seda, Rita Moreno, Griffin Dunne</P>
<P>     Darnell Martin complained that the distribution company was
marketing her film based on the fact that she is a minority woman.  She
felt it implied the film otherwise wasn't very good, and needed special
consideration.  The film is good, however; quite good.  Part of what
makes it original is the fact that a minority woman is the lead
character.  Even in the new wave of minority written and produced
films, women are often relegated into demeaning stereotypical roles.
Lauren Velez,who plays the central character in this film, breaks out
of these stereotypes.  She is average looking and intelligent, unlike
the bubble-headed beauty queens that generally populate films.  It is
the men in her Bronx, New York neighborhood that become cartoonish
stereotypes.  Her husband, played by Job Seda,  is more concerned with
the perception of his machismo than providing for his family.  His
friends are an affably misguided group of ne'er-do-wells.</P>
<P>     The plot walks a fine line between reality and satire.  Elements
like a transvestite brother saving money for a sex change, a
hot-to-trot neighbor, and a WASP salsa record promoter (Griffin Dunne)
could have been easily lampooned.  Director Darnell Martin chose the
hard road and treats all the characters with respect.  This makes the
problems that the lead character faces, like getting enough money to
keep her family off of welfare, real problems.  The events leading up
to her financial situation have a funny side to them, but after the few
jokes, the situation remains.  It is here that Darnell Martin makes her
statements.  The male characters are willing enough to be around for
the good time, but unwilling to deal with the aftermath.  Unclaimed or
unsupervised children abound in the film, with women characters begging
the fathers to own up to their responsibility.  Men want women for show
at parties, but have to be blackmailed into letting them actually use
their mental talents on a daily basis.</P>
<P>      If the film broke down into the men being buffoons and the women
being abused saints, it would be easy to dismiss the film as a
diatribe.  Fortunately, some of the female characters are willing
enough to make fools of themselves.  Oscar winner (for WEST SIDE
STORY) Rita Moreno paints an unflattering comic portrait of the
intrusive mother-in-law.  She dislikes Velez because she has some
African heritage, while all of her son's side of the family is "pure
Castillian".  The one character that makes the most sense is the
transvestite.</P>
<P>     This film is another low budget wonder.  It manages to be part
Cinderella story, while still letting people solve their own problems.
A lot of films recently have shown the exteriors of lower income urban
neighborhoods, only to show lavish sound stage interiors inhabited by
rich drug lords. I LIKE IT LIKE THAT takes you inside to see how real
people live.</P>
