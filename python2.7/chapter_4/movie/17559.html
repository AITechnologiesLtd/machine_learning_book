<PRE>EDtv ***</PRE>
<P>rated PG-13
starring Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman, Ellen DeGeneres, Woody
Harrelson, Martin Landau, Sally Kirkland, Rob Reiner, Dennis Hopper,
Elizabeth Hurley, Clint Howard, Adam Goldberg
written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel
based on the screenplay for LOUIS 19, LE ROI DES ONDES by Emile
Gaudreault and Sylvie Bouchard
directed by Ron Howard</P>
<P>Would you ever want a camera crew following you around 24 hours a day,
filming everything you do? If you gave any thought at all to it, my
guess is you'd say no. But Ed Kearney (Matthew McConaughey) in Ron
Howard's comedy EDtv doesn't give that much thought to anything.</P>
<P>Ed is a thirtysomething video store clerk who gets pushed into the
national spotlight when he agrees to star in a show called TrueTV, in
which a film crew would follow him around 24 hours a day. His brother,
Ray (Woody Harrelson, who could pass for McConaughey's brother in real
life), loves the idea because he can get free publicity for his new
gym. Ray's girlfriend Shari (a very good Jenna Elfman) finds out that
Ray is cheating on her when Ed and his cameras go to visit him, and
she realizes that it was Ed she wanted all along. But camera-shy Shari
can't stand all the attention she's getting and comes across as a
bitch on the show (according to 71% of USA Today readers).  Along with
Ed, we also find out hidden secrets about his family. And when Shari
ditches Ed and the cameras and moves away, the dimwitted Ed realizes
that the show has turned his life into a claustrophobic mess. One show
executive (Ellen DeGeneres) decides then to give the show some
excitement by sending out a woman (Elizabeth Hurley) to seduce Ed. By
then, Ed is a national phenomenon, and a few thousand people wait
outside the woman's apartment to cheer Ed on. When the night turns
into a mess, Ed finally confronts head studio executive (Rob Reiner)
and demands to be set free. But then the executive reminds him of the
contract he signed that says that he can be filmed for as long as the
studio would like to film him. Then the film takes a funny satirical
twist as Ed tries to get his simple life back to normal.</P>
<P>EDtv is not nearly as significant as the film that it will be compared
to time and time again, THE TRUMAN SHOW. In the few times that I saw
THE TRUMAN SHOW, I actually dismissed it as another overrated
Hollywood attempt at greatness.  But EDtv actually made me see what
made THE TRUMAN SHOW so special. It had a social significance and
portrayed Truman's world so satirically well. I'm not saying, though,
that EDtv is a bad movie. Infact, I may have enjoyed it more than THE
TRUMAN SHOW. It is funny, smart and entertaining, and it doesn't leave
as many unanswered questions as THE TRUMAN SHOW. But sometimes the
film gets lost, often forgetting what it's there to do. To prove (like
THE TRUMAN SHOW) that television, above all, is just a bunch of crap.</P>
