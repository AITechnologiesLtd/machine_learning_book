<PRE>Review of Mighty Aphrodite (1995)
Written and Directed by: Woody Allen
Rating: *** out of ****</PRE>
<P>        Just leave it to Woody Allen to compare the life of a neurotic
New Yorker to Greek Tragedy - after all, no one else is going to do
it. Allen is probably the only American director that can get away
with making a film which intercuts a traditional narrative with scenes
of a Greek Chorus commenting on the story. Heck, he's the only
director who can actually pitch this sort of idea and not be laughed
at by the studio executives.</P>
<P>        The story follows Lenny (Allen), a sports writer who is
persuaded by his wife Amanda (Helena Bonham Carter) to adopt a baby.
As the child grows older, Lenny becomes obsessed with finding the
parents of the child, and embarks on a minor odyssey to meet them,
despite the warning of the Greek Chorus. Eventually he manages to
track down the biological mother of his child, Linda Ash (Mira
Sorvino), who lacks all of the qualities which Lenny's son seems to
posses. She also turns out to be an unintelligent and extremely
perverted prostitute. Needless to say, this causes much grief for
Lenny and he tries to change her into a wholesome lady so that he can
romantically pair her with Kevin (Michael Rapaport), an equally dim
boxer.</P>
<P>        The Greek Chorus is certainly the most innovative features of
this film, and serves as the premise for many of the jokes in the
film, such as the Chorus appealing to Zeus for guidance but only
getting his answering machine. Unfortunately, the film does suffer a
bit from the fact that a few too many of the jokes fall flat,
especially considering that this is coming from Woody Allen and not
just any other writer-director.</P>
<P>        Mira Sorvino won the Academy Award for best actress, and it is
a worthy performance. Sorvino manages to portray the naïve character
with a sense of balance; she plays dumb but without diving to absurd
depths where the authenticity of the character is lost.</P>
<P>        Mighty Aphrodite certainly isn't Allen's greatest film, but
for fans of his work (like myself), it's still worth seeing how the
auteur creates yet another bizarre situation for himself and laughing
along as he tries to work it all out.</P>
