<PRE>Review: Saving Grace (2000)<HR></PRE>
<PRE>[2.0/4.0]</PRE>
<P>Films with a central plot revolving around marijuana use are not
uncommon, but they typically target a young, counter-culture audience.
This film is an oddity in that it is centered around marijuana, but it
is seeking a sedate audience that would want to see a cute, uplifting
sleeper.</P>
<P>The story begins with the newly widowed Grace (Brenda Blethyn) trying
to deal with the debt she inherits from her late husband. She has
lived a pastoral life on the English seacoast passing her time with
gardening, but she is suddenly faced with the prospect of losing her
house to creditors. The idea comes to Grace and her pot smoking
handyman, Matthew (Craig Ferguson), that they could solve the
financial problems by using Grace's gardening expertise to save
Matthew's dying marijuana crop.</P>
<P>It is not hard to guess where events lead. The rural neighbors are
supportive of the members of their clan, ignoring that they are
indulging in criminal activities. Matthew's girlfriend disapproves of
his irresponsible activities. The pair get involved in dangerous
circumstances, but never come across anything they cannot handle.</P>
<P>The positive aspect of the film is that it does have humorous moments,
even if those are merely plays on stereotypes. Director Nigel Cole
gets the benefit of a solid performance from veteran Blethyn, but adds
little of substance. The thin premise cannot support much, and hence
standard archetypes and story development are used to allow the
audience to follow along without expending much effort. Although the
combination of Waking Ned Devine and Cheech and Chong may sound
intriguing, this film is barely noteworthy.</P>
<P>Not recommended. The film uses standard characters in a formulaic plot
in an attempt to present the audience with a light, charming story.
The result is a tiresome, predictable adventure that only becomes more
silly as it goes along. If it were not for the quirkiness added by the
marijuana aspect, the film would have been devoid of substance. It
does occasionally elicit laughter, but is mostly boring.</P>
