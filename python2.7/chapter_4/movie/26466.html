<PRE>THE CONTENDER</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>

<P>The vice president of the US has died, and President Evans (Jeff Bridges) 
must select a new one. The primary candidate in everyone's minds is the 
popular Governor Hathaway (William L. Petersen), who was proclaimed a 
national hero when he tried to save a woman whose car flew off a bridge. 
Instead, Evans chooses Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), a popular former 
Republican. The people seem willing to go with this choice, but the evil 
Senator Runyon (Gary Oldman) is a friend of Hathaway's, and doesn't want 
Hanson to win. He digs up dirt about her with the help of the young and 
ambitious Senator Webster (Christian Slater). The dirt is that she engaged 
in an orgy back in her college days, and is therefore not morally fit to be 
a vice-president. The president and his chief of staff, Kermit Newman (an 
excellent Sam Elliott), panic and want Hanson to attack back. Hanson 
refuses, saying she won't stoop to such a level and that it isn't right that 
people are digging into her past in such a way. The only problem facing her 
now is that Runyon is head of the committee who will decide if she is fit to 
be vice-president.</P>
<P>Before you read anything in this review, I should let you know that I did 
something no movie critic should do, and something I haven't done in years. 
I walked out of this movie. I know, that's a crime, and if you don't want to 
read the rest of this review because of it I completely understand. I really 
tried to stay for the whole running time, I thought to myself: "self, you've 
suffered through movies like "Battlefield Earth" and lived to tell the tale, 
how bad can this be?" While "The Contender" is obviously no "Battlefield 
Earth", it had one massive element working against it. What was that? Well, 
the fact of the matter is, I was so insulted by this movie I simply couldn't 
watch it anymore. Alright, let me get one thing out in the open right now 
for those of you who haven't guessed it from previous reviews. I'm quite 
conservative. Now, let me explain something before you throw your hands up 
in the air and say, "Well that explains why he didn't like it, he's biased, 
his opinion doesn't count." While I'm conservative, I love movies, and am 
therefore used to a left-wing slant in nearly all Hollywood films. I can 
tolerate a lot because of this, but I couldn't tolerate "The Contender". In 
fact, the only thing that kept me in my seat for almost two hours was the 
acting.</P>
<P>Joan Allen ("Face/Off") leads the film's impressive cast with an impressive 
performance. Much as I disliked this movie, I'm sure it's going to garner a 
few nominations come Oscar time for acting if nothing else. Allen plays 
Hanson calm, cool, and collected at all times, and this is exactly how the 
character should be played. If she'd gone into hysterics at any point it 
would have destroyed all the character's credibility. Gary Oldman ("The 
Fifth Element") overacts with a vengeance as the conniving Runyon, but 
Oldman is the most fun to watch when he's overacting. The character of 
President Evans is woefully underwritten, but Jeff Bridges (whom I will 
always think of as the dude from "The Big Lebowski") does the best he can, 
throwing in a few much needed humorous moments. Christian Slater ("Very Bad 
Things") is good as the naive young congressman, but in my opinion the most 
impressive performance came from Sam Elliott ("The Big Lebowski"). Elliott, 
looking almost unrecognizable without a great big moustache, manages to turn 
a character who was written as nothing more than a cliche into the most real 
person in the film. He is able to play such a wide range of emotions on his 
face it's almost a shame he's always hidden it with that moustache. Watch 
how he plays the scene where he first finds out about Hanson's past. You can 
feel his rage pulsing out of the screen. Philip Baker Hall ("Magnolia") 
makes a brief but good appearance as Hanson's father.</P>
<P>Let's face it, you're not going to find a conservative movie that deals with 
politics in Hollywood these days. You're not even going to find a middle of 
the road one. All political thrillers coming out of Hollywood have a leftist 
slant, though they try to cover it up by throwing little tidbits to the 
right. Look at "Wag the Dog" (which I loved), about a conservative president 
who has a sexual relationship with a minor, and has it covered up by a 
fix-it man. That had a decidedly leftist slant, but it didn't shove it in 
our faces, cram it down our throats, and finally beat us about the head with 
it. You want an example from the movie? Try this one on for size: Hanson is 
out jogging, wearing pristine white jogging clothes, running through a 
graveyard, past an American flag while dramatic music soars. This scene cuts 
back and forth with Runyon sitting in his office, smoking a cigar, plotting 
her downfall with all the other evil Republicans. The room is darkly lit, 
and all the Republicans have hateful looks on their faces It's a nauseating 
scene and I saw three people walk out of the theater during it, never to 
return. Yet I stayed, disgusted though I was. I didn't actually walk out for 
another 45 minutes or so. The scene that finally snapped my will like a twig 
was when Hanson is addressing the senate committee. She raises her head 
proudly, stares the evil senators down, and proclaims every liberal 
philosophy she upholds while astonishingly cheesy dramatic music swells in 
the background. I made a Jeff Bridges style scream of rage and stormed out 
of the theater.</P>
<P>Okay, politics aside, how does "The Contender" hold up compared to other 
political thrillers? Writer/director Rod Lurie (last seen trying to direct 
"Deterrence") directs the film with all the talent of a first year film 
student. The pacing is a joke, the camera work is simply bizarre (he 
switches from a jittery hand-held camera to a professional panning style and 
back for no apparent reason), and the film's message (women are held to a 
double standard in sexual conduct) is delivered with all the subtlety of a 
knife in the naval. Plus, to top that all off, the script is dull. I saw 
people falling asleep all around me, and I frankly envied them. Why is it 
boring? Because every twist thrown at us is seen coming a mile away. The 
score, by composer Larry Groupe ("I Woke up Early the Day I Died"), is full 
of the sort of cheesy, overblown, dramatic stuff that would make Trevor 
Rabin proud. "The Contender" runs a long 126 minutes. I'd recommend the 
movie to left-wingers and people who don't care about politics, and like 
their political thrillers without thrills. I give the movie two out of five 
stars. By the way, does anyone find it a coincidence that such a leftist 
movie is coming out this close to the election?</P>
