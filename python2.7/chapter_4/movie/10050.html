<PRE>ALIEN RESURRECTION</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  ** out of ****</PRE>
<P>If you talk to some people, they'll say Ridley Scott's ALIEN was the
best of the series, which went downhill after that.  Talk to others
and they'll tell you that James Cameron's thrill-ride masterpiece,
ALIENS, was where the series peaked.  If anyone tells you ALIEN 3 was
the best of the lot, call the nearest mental hospital and tell them
you've found their missing patient.  Fans of the first two films will
invariably join forces to gang up on that installment, directed by
music video director David Fincher.  Four years have gone by since
that fiasco, but the fans' memories have not disappeared, so while the
latest movie, ALIEN RESURRECTION, is approached with high hopes, it is
also approached with a certain wariness.</P>
<P>Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the glue that held the series
together, was killed off in ALIEN 3, taking her own life just as one
of those fearsome creatures came bursting out of her chest.  As she
fell toward a fiery pit of molten metal, she seemed to caress the baby
alien as her own baby, embracing the enemy which had haunted her
through six hours of cinema over fourteen years.  A little corny?
Perhaps, but it seemed a fitting closure to a series which had
garnered a lot of fans and their spending cash.  Of course, an ALIEN
movie would not be the same without the venerable Ripley, so in this
new film, they resurrect her.  Hence the name.</P>
<P>In ALIEN RESURRECTION, Ripley is not really Ripley, but a clone
generated a couple hundred years later from the first Ripley's own
tissue that had been saved from the planet on which she died.  The
people cloning her are from a military-business conglomerate which
hopes to use the aliens for the purposes of research and general
killing as the ultimate weapon.  This clone seems to pick up right
where the late Ripley left off, complete with gestating alien, and the
first scenes of the movie show the medical personnel aboard a gigantic
research vessel removing the baby from Ripley's chest.  Following the
operation, the host seems to be doing fine, so hey, they decide to
keep her around, too.</P>
<P>The research vessel is commanded by General Perez (Dan Hedaya), who
has contracted a freelance freighter crew to deliver a number of
people hijacked while in cryo-stasis, whom Dr. Wren (J.E. Freeman)
plans to use as hosts to breed more aliens.  You see, the alien taken
out of Ripley's chest is a queen and by this time is already laying
eggs.</P>
<P>The freighter crew is your usual band of misfits.  There's Elgyn
(Michael Wincott), the tough leader of the group, Vriess (Dominique
Pinon), Elgyn's lover and first mate of the freighter, Johner (Ron
Pearlman), the all brawn, no brain type, Christie (Gary Dourdan), the
techno-wiz, and Hilliard (Kim Flowers), who doesn't seem to be part of
the crew for any other reason than he's in a wheelchair and therefore
adds a little color to the group.  Then there's Annalee Call (Winona
Ryder), another member of the group who's apparently just tagging
along for reasons which aren't really explained (until later, but
those motivations apparently weren't revealed to the crew before she
was taken on board).  These people react to their surroundings with
the predictable suspicion of authority, and of course there's the
compulsory scene where one of the visiting crew finds the supply room
and loots it.  There's really not much we haven't seen before, and you
can almost pick out the characters who are going to die within the
first hour of the film.</P>
<P>And die they do.  Pretty soon the baby aliens are full grown and find
a particularly ingenious way of escaping their confines.  Shortly
thereafter, they are up to their usual mischief, killing here,
snatching there, and overall looking really mean.  So of course it's
up to Ripley to save the survivors by leading them to their only means
of escape, the freighter on which our rag tag band arrived.  I think
it would have been cute for director Jean-Pierre Jeunet to have paid
an homage to STAR WARS and have Ripley say, ala Princess Leia, "You
came in that thing?  You're braver than I thought."  At least that
would have been unexpected.</P>
<P>ALIEN RESURRECTION contains a whole bunch of things you just knew were
going to happen, because you've seen it happen in the previous films.
>From these re-treads you can publish a doctrine on what not to do when
there are aliens on your spaceship:  1) Don't go looking into holes
made by the aliens.  They will probably grab you from their hiding
place just to the side of the hole.  2) If you find some goo on the
floor, don't spend time staring at it and going, "Ewww."  Instead, run
away fast.  There's an alien nearby.  3) Don't walk on floor gratings;
only walk on solid floors.  With gratings, an alien is probably
looking at you from below and will pull the gratings away and grab you
from underneath.  4) Always assume the alien is right behind you.  The
moment you think it's not there, it will come out of the darkness,
hiss at you, and bite your head.</P>
<P>Most of the performances turned in by the cast are pretty
two-dimensional, but it's not really the fault of the actors, given
what they had to work with.  Most of the characters are paper thin and
just fill up slots, with only Winona Ryder given the slightest chance
to exercise any real acting ability.  Even then, her character's
catharsis is decidedly forced, since the reason for her being on the
ship are justified only by a flimsy motivation.  Sigourney Weaver,
however, gets to play her character in a different way than in
previous movies.  First, Ripley's got all the experience from dealing
with the aliens in the past, and therefore she's more intuitive with
regard to the aliens' behavior.  Second, through the cloning process,
Ripley is actually part alien, and therefore can sense where the
aliens are and even when the queen is in pain.  While intriguing, this
limits the amount of fear she has of the aliens and therefore the
amount of tension we have as an audience.  Sure, we can watch as the
other characters get frightened by the aliens, but since they have no
depth, we don't really care if they're frightened or even if they live
or die.  </P>
<P>The aliens themselves are the best they have ever looked, and credit
must be given to the creature crew on this one.  There are
computer-generated aliens too, and they also look a lot better than in
ALIEN 3, where shots of the CGI alien were all too fake.  One
noticeable change from the previous films is that we see the aliens
very clearly in this movie, in rooms which are decently lit.  Although
this helps to show off the wonderful alien artistry, it also somewhat
defeats the suspense generated from knowing there is something out in
the murky darkness but not being quite able to see it.  As a result,
we become so familiar with their appearances that they aren't all that
scary when they subsequently show up throughout the film.</P>
<P>Altogether, ALIEN RESURRECTION shows that the franchise is running out
of plot ideas, and there are only so many times you can take the same
person running from the same aliens.  While a better film than ALIEN
3, ALIEN RESURRECTION doesn't have what it takes to give the series
the shot in the arm it needs, so if there is to be a fifth movie, it's
going to have to be something really special.</P>
