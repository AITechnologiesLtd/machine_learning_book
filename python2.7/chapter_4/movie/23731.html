<P>"They f--k you up, your mum and dad. They may not mean to, but they do. They 
fill you with the faults they had and add some extra, just for you."
--Philip Larkin, "This be the Verse"</P>
<P>"If you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your country."
--Exodus, Chapter 8 Verse 2</P>
<P>Both these quotes have meaning in relation to "Magnolia", a film of bold 
dramatic strokes from which the sins of fathers, sons and lovers come pouring 
onto the audience in a torrent of stifling intensity. In most scenes it is 
raining. By the end of the movie, this water will stop, to make way for a 
biblical plague.</P>
<P>Because the film is a tapestry of pathetic Los Angeles lives, epic in length 
and emotion, we could compare it to Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" (1993). But 
the work, by "Boogie Nights" creator Paul Thomas Anderson, is not that 
distant or darkly comic; it's a penetrating tragedy comprised of painful, 
sweaty close-ups. Jason Robards and Philip Baker Hall both play influential 
showbiz players at different stages in terminal cancer, who want to repent 
for being lousy husbands and parents. Robards's son is Frank TJ Mackey (Tom 
Cruise), a self-help guru who feigns confidence to give dangerous single men 
lectures on how to be effective misogynists. Hall's daughter, played by 
Melora Walters, is less skilled at masking her emotional scars. She uses 
cocaine and self-destructive sex to punctuate a life of screaming and weeping.</P>
<P>Robards produces and Hall presents a television game show entitled "What Do 
Kids Know?" One former star contestant, Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), has 
grown up into a dangerously insecure loser after being mistreated by his 
parents. A current one, Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman), looks like a 
candidate for the same path.</P>
<P>Around these characters are good people who understand the pain and want to 
help. John C. Reilly's widower cop will love and listen to Walters and Macy. 
Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Robards's nurse, may not succeed in reconciling 
the old man with anyone, but he can pray for and forgive him. Julianne Moore 
is like a one-woman Greek chorus representing everyone else in the cast; her 
character's role in the story is inconsequential, and her job is to bookend 
the scenes of others with tense looks, strained eyes and frantic breath. Like 
the film's constantly climactic music, she appears to be waiting for 
everything to come to a devastating halt.</P>
<P>Somehow hope and redemption shine through the film's closing moments, but 
even without it, "Magnolia" is compelling, not depressing, because Anderson 
moulds the material into a dreamlike flow. His camera spins and jolts with 
the freedom of the imagination, and transitions between situations are 
connected by audio-visual motifs. In one shot a pack of Camels sits on a 
bedside table. Cut to a pharmacy whose shelves are filled by nicotine 
replacement therapies. Bizet's "Carmen" is mentioned among one set of 
characters, and when we meet up with the next, an aria from the opera is 
blaring on the sound track.</P>
<P>Many contemporary films deal with loneliness, bitterness and despair -- 
"Short Cuts", "American Beauty" and "Happiness" are among the most acclaimed. 
"Magnolia" is better than all of them because its confidence and passion is 
so much louder. At times, it creates emotions so extreme it's like our hair 
is being pulled. But I don't go to the movies to feel unmoved.</P>
