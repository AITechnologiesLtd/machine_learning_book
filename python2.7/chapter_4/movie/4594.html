<PRE>                              FROM DUSK TILL DAWN
                       A film review by John Robertson
                        Copyright 1996 John Robertson</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Robert Rodriguez
Screenplay by: Quentin Tarantino
Starring: George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, 
          Juliette Lewis, Cheech Marin</P>
<P>Perfect Person Rating*: The Perfect Person for this film is Joe Bob 
Briggs.  Although I haven't heard what Joe Bob thinks of this movie, 
my guess would be that he likes it, a lot.  See the review below for 
more information.  </P>
<PRE><HR></PRE>
<P>Joe Bob Briggs is a fictional persona who writes movie reviews and 
books.  Though it may surprise some, much of what I learned about 
reviewing comes from him.  To Joe Bob, the most important things in a 
movie are, roughly, 'What's the body count?', 'How many breasts do you 
see?', 'Do heads roll?' and 'Can any person in this movie die at any 
moment?'.  Though Joe Bob traditionally rates drive-in movies, I have 
a feeling that he would really, really like this movie.  </P>
<P>>From Dusk Till Dawn is thought by many to be the next Quentin 
Tarantino film, when in fact, it's really the next Paul Rodriguez 
film.  Appropriately, expect style over substance, even though there 
is a great deal of substance in this film.  One thing that is central 
to this film that I would expect from neither Rodriguez nor Tarantino 
is the huge plot and tone shift that the film makes approximately two 
thirds of the way through.  </P>
<P>The film begins in a typically Tarantino way, with clever dialog that 
you wish would make up the whole movie.  In this case, it's a Texas 
ranger talking with a clerk in a liquor store.  The ranger is so 
gritty, and his speech is so interesting, you wish the movie was about 
him, but as you might suspect, this ranger is not going to be in the 
movie long.  The film is really about Seth and Richie Gecko, played by 
George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino, two men hiding in the back of 
the liquor store with hostages, waiting for the ranger to leave.  Seth 
is tattooed, tough and cool, while Richie is clever, brutal, and a 
psychopath.  Thanks to Richie's dementia, the ranger and the clerk 
meet sudden, violent, and in one case, very spectacular deaths.  Scene 
one ends, the rock music starts, and the opening credits roll.  Up 
until this point, the movie is as good as either Tarantino or 
Rodriguez have ever done.  </P>
<P>Seth and Richie are headed to Mexico with a hostage in their trunk, 
after Richie broke Seth out of prison and the two of them held up a 
bank.  Along the way, they kidnap the family and motor home of a 
preacher, played by Harvey Keitel, who has abandoned his faith.  Using 
the RV and the preacher's family as cover, Seth and Richie make it to 
Mexico, where they are scheduled to rendezvous with a local crime boss 
who will take them in and help them launder their money.  The meeting 
is scheduled to happen at a bar called the Titty Twister, and it's 
here that things soon get out of hand.  </P>
<P>Outside the bar is Cheech Marin, playing a barker of sorts, trying to 
attract bikers and truckers to the bar.  Marin actually plays three 
roles in this film, but this one is the most memorable, mostly because 
his chant uses the word "pussy" more times that anyone would think is 
possible.  </P>
<P>Inside the bar, which seems like paradise to Seth and Richie and hell 
to the preacher, Jacob, and his family; topless women gyrate, bikers 
brawl, and the locals menace in a feast for the eyes and ears.  After 
some scene building, the main attraction, a dancer who is called the 
queen of evil appears and dances for Richie.  Soon, Richie's psychoses 
and some extra attention from the locals lead to a deadly fight 
between Seth, Richie and the bouncers.  After the fight, Richie is 
bleeding profusely from his hand, and this mesmerizes the dancer.  At 
this point, the movie takes the aforementioned plot and tone shift 
that had my jaw dropping to the floor.  </P>
<P>Before describing what happens next, I should say that I have never 
seen a movie make a "left turn" like this.  If you can imagine an 
Ingmar Bergman film suddenly turning into a Zucker brothers' Naked Gun 
movie two thirds through, you can maybe imagine the change in tone.  </P>
<P>The dancer, enthralled with the blood dripping from Richie's wound, 
can take no more, and morphs into a bat-like vampire, attacking 
Richie.  This signals feeding time to the many other vampires in the 
room, and soon you have a supernatural barfight of epic proportions 
underway.  Camp, kitsch and non-sequiters rule the film suddenly, as 
the movie turns into a monster movie extraordinaire.  If you've seen 
Evil Dead, or Dead Alive, you're about ready for the type and tempo of 
the action that ensues, but if you're not prepared, you'll be shocked.
There are more deaths per minute than a Rambo movie suddenly, and it's 
all done with very impressive effects.  </P>
<P>The climax of the movie is as violent and over the top as any I've 
ever seen, and then slowly winds down to tone that was present before, 
literally, all hell broke loose.  Shaking my head, I left the theatre 
awed and puzzled by what I'd seen.  </P>
<P>This movie isn't for everyone, clearly, and so the "Perfect Person 
Rating" is pretty important here.  Obviously, someone who likes their 
movies visceral, with lots of violence, nudity, and gore will love 
this movie, particularly the latter half.  There is more here though, 
both in things to attract people to the movie and in things to warn 
about.  The acting of all characters, but particularly Clooney and, 
surprisingly, Tarantino, is very impressive.  Only Keitel and Juliette 
Lewis seem stiff, and it's easy to understand.  As mentioned before, 
the special effects are very good, as is the score and the screenplay, 
which is the main strength of the first half of the movie.  The main 
reason that someone wouldn't like this movie is the abrupt tone change 
when the vampires make their presence known.  Throughout the latter 
half of the movie, I kept thinking to myself that this movie was 
violating some unwritten rule that a movie should put itself into a 
category and stay there.  Some people might appreciate the daring it 
took to make a movie like this, but others will probably just be 
unpleasantly confused.  </P>

<P>* Perfect Person Rating: The Perfect Person Rating is an attempt to 
give the reader a new way of understanding my rating.  Rather than 
give a film a score, either overall, or on several attributes, the 
Perfect Person Rating tries to identify the type of person would enjoy 
this movie the most.  Since a reviewer is by nature someone with a 
great deal of experience in what they are reviewing, their experience 
may not be the same as someone who is less informed, less jaded, or 
more attuned to the subject.  Hopefully the Perfect Person Rating will 
go further toward eliminating reviewer bias than a simple rating 
scale.  Comments are appreciated.  </P>
