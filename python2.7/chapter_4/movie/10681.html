<PRE>KUNDUN SLOW BUT LUXURIOUS</PRE>
<PRE>Kundun
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Tibet has entered the American consciousness slowly during the past few years
and burst into the forefront recently. The Dalai Lama has made speaking tours,
Tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops, the plight of the
people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there
are two big budget films within as many months.</P>
<P>"Kundun" ("Presence", a name the monks call the young Dalai Lama) opens in
1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the Tibetan leader. A group
of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention.
The young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy
man as "mine". He and his family are then moved to a monastery in Lhassa where
he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political
leader of the country.</P>
<P>He is forced into difficult decisions when China invades the country in 1950.
The peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders
and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results. Eventually he
must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring India. </P>
<P>Comparisons to "Seven Years In Tibet" are inevitable. Both films cover much of
the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner's point of
view and features boxoffice draw Brad Pitt. "Kundun" features only native
actors and is more of an insider's story. In some ways, this makes this film a
superior concept, but it lacks the movement and spark that made "Seven Years"
such an audience-pleaser.</P>
<P>The actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie (filmed in Morocco
for obvious reasons). The only disappointment is Chairman Mao who looks like a
wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character.</P>
<P>On an intellectual level, it is interesting to see how two different
approaches handle the same facts. Some events are depicted differently and
Pitt's Austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in
the Dalai Lama's life isn't even mentioned here.</P>
<P>Glossed over in "Seven Years", the problems with the Tibetan political system
is hinted at here as the Dalai Lama muses "We were just about to change
things" after the Chinese attack.</P>
<P>The film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of
Roger Deakins. His lingering camera shows the exotic Tibetan culture with
luscious detail. Especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand
mandala grain by grain. The visual treats more than make up for the movie's
faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience. Walking out of the
theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience.</P>
<P>Martin Scorsese, known for his dark tales of the underworld ("Goodfellas",
"Taxi Driver", "Casino") has shifted gears. Something of a thematic follow-up
to his "The Last Temptation Of Christ", this is his slowest film yet. Oddly
enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history
filled with atrocities by the Chinese, most of these events take place off-screen.</P>
<P>His decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable. The stumbling oracle
who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as
a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations.</P>
<P>Philip Glass's score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming
and distracting.</P>
<P>I talked to a Tibetan I met outside the theater who had just seen the film and
was walking back in to see it again. Hearing his description of how he escaped
from Tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers
accompanying the Dalai Lama during his trip to India, I was struck by what was
missing in the movie. As grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it
is, there is a distance between the audience and the movie. The film is more
concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings.</P>
<P>With the exception of a few scenes, involvement with the characters is slight.
One of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young Dalai Lama, shown as a
mischievous boy who can't resist being a kid sometimes. An encounter with his
older brother Thubten J. Norbu (a retired Indiana University professor) who
tells the young leader the Chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept
Communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment, but there aren't many of these.</P>
<P>Even with its problems, the "Kundun" experience is phenomenal, but one that I
fear most will miss. Many people who saw "Seven Years In Tibet" will have a
"Been there, done that" attitude. It's likely that the film will miss a
wide-spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for over 22 years: 18 years less than
the Dalai Lama has been in exile. Electronic meditations can go to <A HREF="mailto:redman@bvoice.com.">redman@bvoice.com.</A>)</P>
