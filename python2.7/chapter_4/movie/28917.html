<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>This action-packed one-hour mystery story was the first film in a series spun
off from the successful radio program of the '30s and '40s. It starts off with
some whistling and a monologue by the unseen Whistler, just as it was done on
radio: "I am the Whistler...and I know many things, for I walk by night."
Richard Dix is the featured player in this 8 film series, and in some he's a
private detective or a fall guy or a villain. In this episode, directed by
William Castle, he's a tormented plastic manufacturer whose wife drowned at sea
while he was on a European trip with her. He has never recovered from that
incident which took place 3 years ago, feeling guilty that he saved other lives
but couldn't rescue her. </P>
<P>The film opens with industrialist Earl Conrad (Dix) looking nervous and out of
place in a tough waterfront bar called The Crow's Nest. He meets with a gangster
called Lefty Vigra (Costello) on Tuesday evening and gives him $10,000 to kill
someone by this Friday. The gangster doesn't know that the businessman took out
a contract on himself. </P>
<P>When Earl leaves, Lefty calls his wife (Woodbury) and has a deaf-mute kid, who
was reading a Superman comic book by the bar, deliver the message to the hit man
(J. Carroll Naish). He's reading a book entitled "The Studies of Necrophobia,"
which is the exaggerated fear of death, when the kid slips the message of the
contract under the door. </P>
<P>As Lefty is about to leave the bar, the bartender tells him there are a number
of cops in front. When Lefty tries to get away through the back entrance, he's
shot by the cops who tell him he's wanted under another name as a cop killer. </P>
<P>Meanwhile, Earl prepares for his death by giving his butler $5,000 severance pay
and tells his business partner Charlie that he's leaving his half of the
business to his secretary Alice Walker (Stuart), whom he has taught everything
about running the firm. </P>
<P>A telegram comes stating that Earl's wife is alive, that she's in a Japanese
internment camp. With this news, Earl wants to cancel the contract but with
Lefty dead he can't find out how to get in touch with the killer. </P>
<P>The killer is a man of principle, who feels obligated to do the hit even though
he's been paid and Lefty's dead. He reasons that the one who hired him expects
the job done. This well-done suspense story continues with the panicky Earl
trying to track down the killer to cancel the contract, while the killer thinks
he can scare his target to death by just tailing him. </P>
<P>The film's theme is that man cannot change his destiny, and if his destiny is to
die by murder...that's what it will be. The Whistler states at the end: "I know
because I am the Whistler." The result is an entertaining B film. </P>
