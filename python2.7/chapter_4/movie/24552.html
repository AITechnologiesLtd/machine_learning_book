<P>I've assigned no star rating to John Travolta's "Battlefield Earth"
because, frankly, I'm unsure how many stars to give a film that is so
bad that it's good. In general, I find the practice of championing lousy
movies to be distasteful. Mocking the efforts of others is snide, and
besides, there are plenty of quality films dying on the vine for lack of
a receptive audience.</P>
<PRE>But still…</PRE>
<P>Every so often a movie comes along that is so overwrought, overacted and
overwhelmingly inept that it must be seen to be believed. Glorious
disasters like "Valley of the Dolls," "Mommie Dearest," "Road House" and
"Showgirls." And now comes "Battlefield Earth," the newest entry to the
Grade Z Hall of Fame.</P>
<P>Travolta optioned the source novel in 1983, and has been trying to get
the 1000 page opus by his mentor, L. Ron Hubbard, onto the big screen
ever since. Originally, he dreamed of starring as the young hero, but as
the years passed and his waistline thickened, Travolta (who also
co-produced the film) opted to play the villain instead.</P>
<P>The story is set in the year 3000; nearly a millennium after the
Psychlos, a supremely arrogant alien race, wiped out most of humanity.
As security chief Terl (Travolta) graciously explains, "When we attacked
your planet... all your soldiers and all their advanced technology, you
only put up a measly nine-minute fight. This is why Man is an endangered
species!" From domed installations, the Psychlos force the surviving
"man-animals" to mine for gold.</P>
<P>The remnants of our species are primitives, many of whom consider the
Psychlos to be vengeful gods. When Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper,
the sharpshooter from "Saving Private Ryan") dares to leave his people
in the hills to go exploring, he is quickly captured by the aliens and
comes face to face with Mr. Psychlo himself. Terl, enraged after being
passed over for promotion, uses Jonnie as a pawn in an elaborate scheme
to regain the power he feels he deserves. But Jonnie has plans of his
own. Assembling a ragtag (is there any other kind?) team of patriots, he
intends to drive the Psychlos off the planet, by any means necessary.</P>
<P>The plot is serviceable; it's the execution that makes "Battlefield
Earth" such a joke. The filmmakers are so determined to make viewers
realize they are watching an !!EPIC!! that they turn the production into
a gigantic block of cheese.</P>
<P>>From the opening scenes, which employ a "Beastmaster" motif, Elia
Cmiral's "majestic" score bludgeons the audience with thunderous noise.
If one of the noble human savages even raises an arm, you can count on a
pounding kettledrum or a fanfare to accompany the movement.</P>
<P>The acting matches the music. Barry Pepper adopts a stilted Mid Atlantic
accent, the kind community theater actors use when they play royalty.
Sincere to a fault, his strained delivery suggests constipation rather
than heroism. Perhaps the strain was from trying to keep a straight face
while spouting lines like "We're gonna destroy their home world… of
course, we'll need some extra supplies for that."</P>
<P>Pepper is a master of subtlety compared to Travolta, who gives a
performance that would make William Shatner wince. Decked out like the
bastard son of a Klingon and Gene Simmons, the dreadlocked Travolta
crinkles his fingers while hissing, snarling and overenunciating
absurdly, punctuating sentences like "Once we finish mining-out this
miserable little planet, let's do the Universe a favor: Let's
exterminate the life from it!" with maniacal laughter. He also swears a
lot, mostly using peculiar variants of the word "crap."</P>
<P>The Psychlos are supposed to be overconfident fools who fatally
underestimate humanity ("A man-animal getting leverage over a Psychlo,"
cackles Terl, "that'll be the day!"), and Travolta gets that part right.
But they're also supposed to be frightening, and these boobs in KISS
boots are anything but. As Terl's underling, Ker, Forest Whitaker
(looking extremely uncomfortable in freaky contact lens) is a bit less
embarrassing than Travolta, though he has his share of cringe-worthy
moments. Kelly Preston, Mrs. Travolta, also appears briefly, just long
enough to lasciviously waggle her mega-long CGI tongue.</P>
<P>As for the mechanics of the "man-animal" revolt, suffice to say the plot
has more holes than a tattooist's ears. Oh sure, the Psychlos took Earth
in nine minutes, but the savages have an edge because, hey, they're
spunky. Luckily for them, aircraft that has sat untouched for nearly a
thousand years still works. And if you thought the resolution of
"Independence Day" was ridiculous, wait until you get a load of the
finale here.</P>
<P>Visually, the film is a muddy pastiche of images and set pieces from
other sci-fi films, ripping off everything from "Planet of the Apes" to
"The Matrix." Adding to the absurdity is Director Roger Christian's
attempt to weird things up by repeatedly shooting scenes at an angle, à
la "The Twilight Zone."</P>
<P>If you think this all sounds horrific, trust me – I've barely scraped
the surface. "Battlefield Earth" is an absolute disaster… and a crapload
of campy fun. The icing on the cheesecake is Travolta's assurance that
there will positively be a sequel. Jeepers, I can hardly wait!</P>
