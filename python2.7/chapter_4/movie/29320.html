<PRE>DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS (1988)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Professional assassins are the usually the most fascinating
category of criminals on the silver screen and potentially
the most rewarding for any serious filmmaker. But in the
genre of comedy another category of criminals - con artists
- rules supreme. This is hardly surprising because they are
by definition the most charming of all criminals, and taking
advantage of other people's stupidity often corresponds with
said stupidity being the source of on-screen humour. One of
the examples could be found in DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, 1988
comedy directed by Frank Oz.</P>
<P>The plot is set in Beaumont-sur-Mer, little resort town on
French Riviera, frequented by rich people from USA and other
parts of the world. This used to be the perfect hunting
ground for Lawrence Jamieson (played by Michael Caine),
sophisticated and suave British con artist specialised in
extracting money from rich and gullible women by posing as a
mysterious exiled prince. Through the years Jamieson amassed
enough fortune to afford a mansion, butler (played by Ian
McDiarmid) and co-operation of local police inspector
(played by Anton Rodgers). His idyllic life suddenly becomes
threatened with the arrival of rival in the form of Freddy
Benson (played by Steve Martin), uneducated and
unsophisticated American who earns money by telling sob
stories about his ill grandmother. Jamieson, convinced that
this raw routine might bring unwanted attention, does
everything in his power to drive Freddy out of town, but the
American keeps coming back. Finally, two men decide to make
a wager - whoever extracts 50,000 US$ from American "soap
queen" Janet Colgate (played by Glenne Headley) wins, and
the loser would have to leave town.</P>
<P>Not among the most remarkable films thirteen years ago,
DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS looks surprisingly good from today's
perspective. The reason is probably in the humour, which is
way above the today's Hollywood standards of comedy embodied
in the films by Farrelly brothers. The script by Dale
Launer, Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning is very intelligent
and the film leaves the impression of belonging to another
era - 1950s or 1960s (hardly a surprise, since this happens
to be the remake of BEDTIME STORY, directed by Ralph Levy in
1963). The plot is, on the other hand, weak and serves as
nothing more than excuse for the series of scenes in which
two principal characters try to outwit each other. Another
surprise of the film is good direction by Frank Oz of MUPPET
SHOW fame; in DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, unlike his previous
film THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, he abandons special effects
in favour of authentic locations of French Riviera (and
famous Victorine studios in Nice) and allows great actors to
carry the film. Michael Caine and Steve Martin look like
they were born to play the characters; the contrast between
sophisticated European and provincial American is not only
mirrored in screen personalities of Michael Caine and Steve
Martin, but also in the different styles of acting. While
Caine, same as his aristocratic character, keeps stiff upper
lip at all times, Steve Martin often goes for the physical
comedy, although not always with the best results. The
biggest and the most pleasant surprise, however, comes in
the form of Glenne Headley, the actress who had misfortune
of wasting her talent in many disastrous films in late 1980s
and early 1990s. Her talents were not wasted in DIRTY ROTTEN
SCOUNDRELS - she simply shines in the role of naive and
innocent woman whose charm is going to enchant our immoral
protagonists. Unfortunately, she appears relatively late,
and because of that the film is slightly overlong, and the
twist ending is not as unpredictable as the authors would
like. DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS is nevertheless very funny and
entertaining film that should be recommended as an example
of something that is rather absent in Hollywood these days -
stylish and well-crafted comedy.</P>
