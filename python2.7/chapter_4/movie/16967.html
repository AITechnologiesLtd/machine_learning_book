<P>What do you get when you slap together the writer of one of the best
thrillers to come out in the last ten years, SEVEN (9/10), the cheezy
director of the awful BATMAN & ROBIN, and the acting talents of Nicolas
"Gimme some tights and I can play Superman" Cage? You get a mediocre
checkmark on the blackboard of gripping thrillers.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A discreet private investigator gets hired by an aging widow of a rich guy,
after she finds a snuff film in his wall-safe, and wants to know if the girl
killed on the grainy movie, was killed for real. The private dick slowly
delves into the sick, perverted world of underground porn, and slowly
uncovers the secrets behind the disgusting film.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Dark, gritty thriller that starts off with a great premise, but loses you
with its snails pace, awful soundtrack and somewhat predictable and weak
conclusion. The film seems to have two endings, one which is quite
see-through and anti-climactic, and another longer, drawn-out finish, which
does score some points for daring, but not enough to make up for the film's
overall laggard inclination. The actors are all very good in their roles,
with Cage coming through as the man progressively being torn apart inside,
and Joaquin Phoenix as the wise-cracking, porn-shop-clerking, side-kick from
hell! Peter Stormare also turns in a fun role as Dino Velvet, one of the
film's more seedier characters. And yes, there are quite a few seedy
characters in this one, but not as many as I anticipated. In fact, for a
film that deals with murder, porn and the Hollywood underground, I didn't
find much to be shocked about. Some interesting scenes, but nothing overly
appalling or horrific. But then again, maybe I watch too much porn myself :)</P>
<P>I guess that if you're the type of person that enjoys lazy-paced films, with
a tinge of character development, then you might enjoy this one, despite its
impotent conclusion. But if you check into this film looking for a
fast-paced thrill-ride, you will be mightily disappointed, because the hop
of this film is not as swift as the mighty rabbit. Having said that, the
cinematography of the film is perfect, with the smell of the underground
practically carrying you out of your seat and literal darkness choking us
all around. But overall, the film doesn't generate enough real thrills,
tension or a full-filling conclusion, to be judged a recommendable thriller.
Rent SEVEN again, or wait for this SEVEN-lite to come out on video, so that
you could sit down with a beer in one hand, a remote in the other, and a
pillow nestled plumply behind your fat head.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Joel Schumacher has also directed several music videos, including
"Devil Inside" by INXS, "Kiss From a Rose" by Seal and "The End is the
Beginning is the End" by The Smashing Pumpkins. He has also written several
screenplays including the 1976 comedy CAR WASH and 1985's Brat-Pack hit,
ST-ELMO'S FIRE. He started his career as an art director for television
commercials, before becoming costume designer for such notable films as
Woody Allen's SLEEPER and INTERIORS.
Despite being born Joaquin Raphael Phoenix, at the age of four Joaquin
decided that he wanted a more earthy name, like his elder siblings River and
Rain. So while he was raking leaves with his father he decided on Leaf. In
the early '90's he would take back his birth name.
Actor James Gandolfini was born in Westwood, New Jersey. He graduated from
Rutgers University before beginning his acting career in New York theatre.

Along with his success in the United States, actor Peter Stormare continues
to work in his native country of Sweden. He starred in the title role of the
Scandinavian thriller HAMILTON, also featuring Mark Hamill and Leno Olin,
which broke box-office records in Sweden and Norway.
