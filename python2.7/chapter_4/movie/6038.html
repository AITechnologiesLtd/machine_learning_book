<P>     I have this idea that what happened to GRACE OF MY HEART -- a good
movie which flirts with being a great one -- is that Allison Anders wrote
herself into a corner.  She created a story based in part on a pattern of
behavior, resulting in a structure which becomes repetitious; she has also
made a period piece filled with thinly disguised counterparts for music
industry figures of the 50s and 60s, resulting in a guessing game which
becomes distracting.  GRACE OF MY HEART has a superb character study at
its core, made even more appealing by the top-notch work of Illeana
Douglas, and that makes it a disappointment that Allison Anders has
surrounded that character with so many elements which draw attention away
from her.</P>
<P>     GRACE OF MY HEART opens in 1958, where Edna Buxton (Douglas), a
well-heeled young woman from Philadelphia, dreams of being a singer and
songwriter.  She thinks that she is headed for the big time after winning
a talent contest, but she finds the going tough in New York until she is
offered an opportunity by producer Joel Milner (John Turturro) to write
singles for other artists.  Though she wants to sing her own material, she
agrees to Joel's terms as a way into the industry, and even to his
suggestion that she change her name to Denise Waverly.  The newly
christened Denise begins to churn out the hits in the legendary Brill
Building, and soon gets involved with another one of Joel's writers,
Howard Caszatt (Eric Stoltz).  The relationship is as uneven as her
professional success, however, and Denise finds herself on a decade long
journey of discovery culminating in a marriage to surf music legend Jay
Phillips (Matt Dillon).</P>
<P>     On one level, GRACE OF MY HEART operates simply as a travelogue
through an era in American popular music, and there are some extremely
entertaining moments integrated into that travelogue.  Denise clearly is
modeled after Carol King, and it is interesting to note that her inability
to break in initially as a singer was based largely on the prevailing
notion that female vocalists were "out."  There is also a hilarious bit
involving Bridget Fonda as a Lesley Gore-type singer whose unconventional
lifestyle inspires Denise and her partner Cheryl (Patsy Kensit) to write
her a song about a "secret love;" the songs -- originals by Los Lobos,
David Baerwald and Elvis Costello, among others -- are generally true to
the period, making for a rich background of sound.  Yet there are moments
when the setting and the inspired-by characters feel forced.  Anders draws
too much attention to supporting players by asking you to chuckle at what
she is able to suggest about Gore, Phil Spector and others without
actually saying so, and it becomes a tail which wags the dog.</P>
<P>     That is particularly true where Matt Dillon's character is concerned,
a disturbed genius a la Beach Boy Brian Wilson.  Dillon's performance is
too sleepy to be involving even as Jay becomes more and more paranoid and
depressed, and we are left to watch him play the way Wilson might have
been without understanding why we should care.  It is a long,
patience-testing episode, and it is particularly frustrating coming at the
tail end of a string of relationship episodes in which Denise falls hard
for a guy who turns out to be more trouble than he is worth.</P>
<P>     Still, I was generally willing to indulge Anders, because I could see
where it all was leading.  She introduces Edna as a child of an extremely
traditional upbringing, with a mother (Christina Pickles) who is more
concerned that her daughter look and sound respectable at the talent
contest than that she express herself.  GRACE OF MY HEART is a film about
the struggle for a woman to find her own voice after being conditioned to
believe that it is more important for her to subsume her own desires and
talent to the desires of the men in her life.  It is sometimes aggravating
to watch Edna/Denise make the same mistake over and over, but that is
exactly the problem she is forced to come to terms with and it pays off in
impassioned moments when she finally does let her own feelings soar
(notably in her songs, with vocal provided by Kristen Vigard).  Illeana
Douglas is fantastic as a woman who is both strong and weak, and her
unique looks somehow make her even more believable as someone forced to
linger in the background longer than her talent warrants.  I wanted to
stick with her through her story, and it remained worth the effort even
after Anders gets sidetracked.  GRACE OF MY HEART is a film with built-in
flaws, but they can be overlooked for a chance to watch a woman find the
grace in her own heart.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 amazing graces:  7.</PRE>
