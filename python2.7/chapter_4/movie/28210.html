<P>"Joe Dirt" is woefully unfunny. Directed by television alum Dennie Gordon (in 
his feature film debut) and executive-produced by Adam Sandler, it is another 
halfhearted attempt to inundate audiences with bathroom humor and dog-humping 
jokes. The only problem is, these jokes are, by now, getting moldier than 
three-month-old bread, and it has a watered-down PG-13 rating. Every physical 
joke and every line of dialogue that is supposed to be humorous are both 
predictable and boring. I didn't laugh, or lightly chuckle, or even smile, 
once throughout the duration of "Joe Dirt," and it takes a really, really bad 
comedy to achieve such a dubious feat.</P>
<P>Joe Dirt (David Spade) is a radio station janitor in Los Angeles with a 
cheesy mullet hairdo straight out of the '70s. Living in the building's 
boiler room, lightning strikes one day when he finds himself on the air with 
"tell-it-like-it-is" radio personality Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller), 
unspinning his fascinating life story, from the moment when he was abandoned 
by his trailer trash parents at the Grand Canyon when he was eight, up until 
the present day, circa twenty years later. Passed along from one wacky foster 
family to the next as a child, Joe has spent his adult years desperately 
searching for the whereabouts of his parents, who have seemingly vanished 
into thin air. Amidst it all, he lost touch with the one person who ever 
really cared about him, Brandy (Brittany Daniel), a fetching young woman who 
is about to marry the oily Robby (Kid Rock) by default.</P>
<P>An uninspired road-movie-cum-love-story, "Joe Dirt" leaps from one comic 
setup to the next, without any actual care for the story at hand, or the fact 
that the comedy is D.O.A. David Spade (1999's "Lost & Found"), who also acts 
as co-writer to the episodic screenplay, can be a charming performer, but he 
tries too hard here to be like fellow comedians Adam Sandler and Rob 
Schneider. In the process, he flounders in a story that would be above the 
most listless actor in Hollywood.</P>
<P>Cameos are prevalent, perhaps to make up for the lacking material, as they 
include everyone from Christopher Walken (what is he doing her?), to rapper 
Kid Rock, to Rosanna Arquette. The only person who permeates any sort of 
cinematic screen presence is Brittany Daniel (a former recurring actor on 
TV's "Dawson's Creek"), as the sweet Brandy, who makes for an attractive love 
interest. Daniel's scenes, and one admittedly clever vignette in which Joe is 
captured and put into a well by a cross-dressing serial killer with a 
white-haired poodle, a 'la "The Silence of the Lambs," are the only elements 
that raise "Joe Dirt" above being utterly worthless. The classic rock 
soundtrack, including Blue Oyster Cult's "Burnin' for You" and Bachman 
Turner-Overdrive's "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet," isn't bad, either.</P>
<P>There are so many things wrong with "Joe Dirt," however, that these passing 
bright spots are only cause for cursory interest. The whole of the film is 
birdbrained and silly, and doesn't work for a second. Likewise, director 
Dennie Gordon shows no flair for filmmaking, unable to set up even the most 
simple jokes for an acceptable payoff. "Joe Dirt" aspires to be the next 
"Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo" or "Dumb & Dumber," but it ends up landing 
closer in quality to "Billy Madison" and "Black Sheep."</P>
