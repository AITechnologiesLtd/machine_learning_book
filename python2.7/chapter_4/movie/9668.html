<PRE>FIRST KNIGHT (1996)
Starring: Richard Gere and Sean Connery</PRE>
<P>This movie does not follow the original King Arthur legends at all.  Yet a 
movie that did would probably not be as appealing to audiences- for instance 
Lancelot is supposed to be rather ugly.  So this change in plot could be 
over-seen if the movie was fantastic.  FIRST KNIGHT is not.  It has its 
moments, but fails to reach the epic proportions it needs to reach to succeed. 
Still, if a combination of sword-fights, Sean Connery, and love scenes sounds 
appealing- watch it.</P>
<P>The plot involves Malagant (similar to the character Mordred from the 
legends) causing havoc all over Camelot's neighboring cities.  Meanwhile a 
promising adventurer named Lancelot manages to save Princess Guinevere's life. 
 In exchange for this, Lancelot becomes a famed knight of the Round Table.  
Yet Guinevere and Lancelot fall in love, causing complications...</P>
<P>Sean Connery does a fine job as an older King Arthur.  Richard Gere as 
Lancelot is passable- but not great.  There is a neat scene where Lancelot 
weaves his way in and out of a gauntlet during a festival.  The music works, 
but the fact the Merlin is not in here at all is disturbing...</P>
