<PRE>HOUSE OF GAMES
by Kristian Lin</PRE>
<P>David Mamet's THE SPANISH PRISONER is yet another story where an
innocent man is beset by demons but defended by angels and ministers of
grace.  Movies like this usually depend on a passive central character
and are thus emotionally uninvolving no matter how intellectually
engaging they may be.  This one's no different, although it's told
reasonably well.</P>
<P>Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) works for a company and has discovered a
process.  Mamet intentionally leaves the nature of the business and
Joe's discovery vague; what's important is that the new invention will
make them lots of money.  He's sent to a Caribbean island where he meets
Julian "Jimmy" Dell (Steve Martin), a wealthy playboy with a propensity
for eccentric gestures like setting Joe up with a Swiss bank account - 
it only has 15 francs in it, but the Swiss will keep the balance a
secret, and Joe can impress people with his account.  But there's a
point to Jimmy's apparent whims, and Joe soon finds himself bilked out
of his discovery, with the police thinking that he has stolen it from
the company.  The only person he can trust is his secretary, Susan Ricci
(Rebecca Pidgeon), who believes he's innocent.</P>
<P>It's a nice little shell game that Mamet puts us through, though there
are a few holes.  When Joe discovers a friend murdered, he flees the
scene rather than face the cops who are hot on his heels.  By doing so,
he seems to play right into the hands of both the bad guys and the good
guys.  But why would they count on him running, especially when everyone
keeps testifying to what a straight arrow he is?  Why don't they figure
on him leading the cops to the dead body?  Such questions make Joe a
cipher, and Campbell Scott, accomplished actor that he is, can't get to
the bottom of the character.</P>
<P>There are other problems, too.  Mamet has been directing movies for 11
years, and he still hasn't even reached adequacy.  The overall pacing is
fine, but the movie looks drab, and he blows the big climactic moment by
drawing it out in slow-motion.  Mamet's dialogue, his great strength as
a writer, is off as well.  OLEANNA had too many broken sentences and
dramatic pauses in inappropriate places.  THE SPANISH PRISONER has too
many pronouncements on matters philosophical - Joe's friend George
(Ricky Jay) says, "Worry is like interest paid in advance on a debt that
never comes due."  When Susan responds to the simple query of "How are
you?" with, "The wolves are howling at my troika," you just wince at the 
artifice.</P>
<P>And then there's Rebecca Pidgeon, who is Mrs. Mamet in real life.  She's
been a constant in his stage plays, but (besides a small part in
HOMICIDE) Mamet has had the decency to keep her out of his movies until
now.  She's a flat, irritatingly fraudulent presence whose jocular good
cheer is transparently phony.  The rest of the cast, though, ranges from
good enough to excellent - worth singling out are Felicity Huffman as an
FBI agent and Ed O'Neill as her cool, brisk supervisor.  Best of all is
Steve Martin, who slips into Mamet's world with frightening ease, as he
keeps finding layers to this man with ulterior motives.  With much less
fanfare than Robin Williams or Tom Hanks or (most recently) Jim Carrey,
Steve Martin has made himself into a dramatic actor of considerable
weight.  Actually, he had that kind of heft before any of them - check
out his performance in the great PENNIES FROM HEAVEN (1981).  He has 
devoted more and more time to writing essays and plays and become very
good at them, but let's hope he gives us a few more performances like
this.</P>
