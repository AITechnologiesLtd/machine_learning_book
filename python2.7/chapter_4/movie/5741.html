<PRE>                                  TWISTER
                       A film review by Allan Toombs

<P>What puts Twister ahead of this year's crop of big action movie's is the
joie de vivre it brings to you. I found it emotionally compelling not just
because of the awesome forces our heroes face but because of the sheer
delight in normality we share with the stormchasers.
        The stormchasing phenomena is very recent; made possible by
affordable mobile communications, modern weather prediction and a certain
fin de ciecle craziness. A cast of (for me) unknowns realisticly portray the
kind of motley crew that are probably out there in Tornado Alley right now.
You quickly start to care for every one of them. Rebels with a
meteorological cause they are united by the need to share information in
order to witness storms, in particular tornadoes.
        Against this band of semi-academic nomads is a corporate sponsored
fleet with the same goal but superior technology. This is, as yet, an
invention, as far as I know. Stormchasing is usually composed of long boring
waits, grinding driving and a few brief moments of adrenaline. Too
unpredictable for anyone other than mavericks and fanatics. However this
strand of rivalry is peripheral and the downtime is there as the team stop
over at Bill's beautifully eccentric Aunt and a drive in that chose a bad
night to show THE SHINING. These two sojourns denote the breaks in a classic
three act Hollywood structure.
        Beyond the mechanics of our audience response there is an inner
journey to this movie and despite an excellent performance from Bill Paxton
it belongs to Helen Hunt's character Jo. Her look is right, you can believe
this woman would camp out in a field with weather obsessed geeks, her acting
talent tells you how much she still loves Bill. Against this she is
demonised by a childhood trauma that motivates her need to research whirlwinds.
        If the chases will have you whooping like an adolescent then the
love triangle at the films heart is soberly adult and should have you
guessing if Jami Getz or Helen Hunt will retain Paxton's affections. Ms.Getz
is another new name to me and conveyed a sophisticate terrified by and
relishing the storm chase. I wondered if her city girl would embrace the
stormchaser's stripped-down lifestyle as an alternative to Jo's
self-destructive energy; that's how much the film involved me.
        There's nothing too fanciful about the plot, the people are drawn
from life, the tornadoes don't need to be made larger than life and Bill's
dilemma is all too typical. The soundtrack is superlative with great use of
pop music, a classical score that doesn't intrude and a scorching end
credits piece by the Van Halens. 
        This film could make weather following alot more converts but the
winds have always been there, a natural destructive force that appears
amidst the flat boredom of the Mid-West landscape. The makers have shown us
our world in an exciting new light, which is one of the best things that can
happen at the cinema. See it on the big screen while you can!</P>
