<P>   Jane Campion's ("The Piano") new movie, which will open
for one week in December for Oscar consideration before
having an open run in 2000, should get the Academy Award
hands-down for "Best Picture about a Guy Who is Hoist with
his Own Petard."  Alas, such an tribute does not yet exist, but
"Holy Smoke" is one helluvan examination of the struggle we
poor human beings go through every day as our rational side
struggles with the irrational.  (If you don't believe such a
civil war is waged regularly inside our little skulls, just
try to remember what we dreamt about last night.)  In
particular, let us never underestimate the power of the sex
drive.  The energy unleashed or repressed by that dynamic
can hardly be overstated, and now, Ms. Campion uses her
vivid imagination and sense of cinematic color, light and
imagery to portray the tussle in an over-the-top drama of
gamesmanship that welcomes us once again to an
Australian Woop-Woop that features an unlikely duo's making
whoopie.</P>
<P>   Borrowing the theme from the classic Bertolucci film of
1973 "Last Tango in Paris"--about an American expatriate
who enters into a sexual liaison with a chance acquaintance
abroad--Campion plunges into the story of a cult
deprogrammer who is in grave danger of being programmed
himself.  After successfully busting up 189 cult-worshipping
young people with "a recidivism rate of only 3.3 percent," the
Los Angeles-based P.J. Waters (Harvey Keitel) is hired by a
couple far away in South Australia to deprogram their
daughter, Ruth Barron (Kate Winslet).  On a trip to India with
her friend Prue (Samantha Murray), Ruth had fallen under the
sway of a forceful guru, Chidaatma Baba (Dhritiman Chaterji),
and decides to remain in Delhi with Baba's devotees. 
Deceiving her that her father, Gilbert (Tim Robertson) is
dying, Ruth's mother Miriam (Julie Hamilton) travels to Delhi
and convinces her to return temporarily to their home,
whereupon she is forced by her extended family to go to an
isolated cabin for three days with P.J. Waters.  Waters will
proceed to break her down through a three-step
process--before building her up to return to her
normal life.  But Ruth exploits her sexual prowess to throw
the older man off course, turning the battle of wills into a
literal knock-down, drag-out struggle that threatens to trash
the cult-buster's undefeated record.</P>
<P>   Campion puts together two of the most unlikely characters
and compels us to accept the sexual bond that the much
older "ugly American" has with this powerfully libidinous soul,
giving new meaning to the joys of touring the terrain
downunder.  Kate Winslet, in the role of a woman trying to
find herself spiritually in a manner not unlike her striving in
Gillies Mackinnon's recent film "Hideous Kinky," radiates
a sensuality so strong that we can almost forgive Keitel's P.J.
Waters' descent into madness.  This is hardly a film that
takes itself with deadly seriousness, as Campion throws the
screen open to an array of wacky characters, especially
Ruth's outrageously flirtatious sister-in-law, Yvonne (Sophie
Lee).  Like a high-school kid in the throes of puppy love,
Yvonne writes romantic letters to herself and while enjoying a
sexual union with her husband, Robbie (Dan Wyllie)
fantasizes an array of movie stars like Brad Pitt and Tom
Cruise.  </P>
<P>   The goofy scenario is played out against the huge empty
spaces of the Australian desert (filmed in and around the little
town of Hawker in south Australia's Fliners Ranges).  A single
image, perhaps the most dramatically vivid, colorful and
impressive of any film this year, occurs at the moment in
Delhi that the Baba stares at Ruth, propelling upon her a
hallucinatory impression that a third eye has grown in the
middle of her forehead.  She swoons amid a kaleidoscopic
display that must be the first detail an enraptured devotee
sees upon entering a state of Nirvana.  Our assurance that
Ruth is indeed sold on her new life in India comes to the fore
when she dances wildly to Alanis Morissette's "You Oughta
Know."  At this point some in the audience will root for Ruth's
victory over Waters, particularly when Campion impresses
upon us the fuddy-duddyness of her parents and the near-
derangement of people in Ruth's extended family.</P>
<P>   If Harvey Keitel emerged as the invincible cleaner in
Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction," he materializes here as
the man who is sent to tidy up a soul but ends up as a
basket case himself, at least temporarily until his long-term
associate, Carol (Pam Grier), can straighten him out.  Keitel
enjoys his obligatory nude scene, attracted by a similarly
naked Winslet in what becomes a mock-serious film about
the vulnerability of both principals to the forces of the
irrational.  If the film comes across as too over-the-top, one
which makes you wonder what Campion is really getting out
(our search for spirituality? sexual politics?), the best way to
interpret its vision is that life is unpredictable.  Accept the
illogical, the untenable, the wildly imaginative as much a part
of our makeup as the coldly sensible.  "Holy Smoke" is a fun
picture full of vibrant imagery, wacky characters, and carnal
aspirations.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 114 minutes.  (C) 1999
