<P>PLOT:
A map leading to the city of gold is what ignites two con men buddies in
their quest to find El Dorado. Once discovered, the duo are thought to be
Gods by the locals, and must keep up the ruse until they figure out a way to
get the gold, and themselves, back to Spain.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
I enjoyed it. I didn't go nuts over it...I didn't hate it...in fact, I don't
particularly remember any grand sequences from it...but all in all, I
enjoyed it while I was there, and I suppose that's the most important thing.
The two leads were actually very amusing, with much of their repartee
striking my own fancy on more than one occasion. The rest of the cast,
including Rosie Perez as the very shapely Chel, were also pretty good, but
no standouts a la Mushu from MULAN (7.5/10) or the Genie from ALADDIN. Of
course, the best animation films always feature the greatest "bad guys" and
despite this one teasing us with one very mean-looking son-of-em-bitch early
on in the flick, the main baddie ultimately oozed very little threat, so on
that front the film could be faulted slightly. Action-wise, the movie
generated a couple of cool puffball sequences early on, one big ass blowout
scene during its last few minutes, and generally managed to keep me
entertained throughout.</P>
<P>Were the songs any good, you ask? Well, personally I have never been a huge
fan of films which rely solely on their songs to do the talking for them,
but thankfully for this film, that wasn't the case. Sure there were a couple
of musical montages here and there, all to be expected, but all in all,
nothing over-the-top or crappy either. I do think that Elton John/Phil
Collins should put a cork in their animation song-writing schedules from now
on, since their voices generally propel my attention away from these films,
but then again, maybe that's just me! If you're gonna put songs in a film,
how 'bout having the characters and their voices sing 'em and forget these
over-the-hill Englishmen (no offense, gentlemen :). I did really love the
whole look of this movie with its magnificent array of color strokes lining
every frame just right, the city of gold exuding its powerful odors of
paradise and the characters all emitting a strong sense of personality.
Overall, I would suggest this film to all kids and certainly to most adults
who like these kinds of movies. Mind you...it's no FIGHT CLUB! :)</P>
