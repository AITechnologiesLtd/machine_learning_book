<P>Susan Granger's review of "THE CLOSET" (Miramax Films)</P>
<P>    In this hilarious French farce, a shy, boring accountant (Daniel
Auteil) named Francois Pignon discovers he's going to be fired from his job at a
condom factory. Lonely and distraught, he contemplates suicide. But then he runs
into Belone (Michel Aumont), an elderly homosexual neighbor, who suggests a "sex
discrimination" lawsuit to intimidate management. As evidence, Belone concocts
provocative photographs of Pignon locked in a leather-clad embrace with another
man and mails them anonymously to Pignon's boss. When the racy snapshots start
circulating around the factory, not only does Pignon get his job back but he
suddenly finds himself  the focus of attention as an openly gay man. His lusty
supervisor (Michele Laroque) is so intrigued that she wonders if, perhaps, she
could change his sexual preferences. Even his ex-wife (Alexandra Vandernoot) and
indifferent teenage son (Stanislas Crevillen) drop their disdain. But not
everyone is enchanted. A mucho macho co-worker Felix (Gerard Depardieu), a
self-righteous  homophobe, is stunned and repulsed when he's forced by the PR
director (Thierry Lhermite) to grovel and court Pignon's friendship or risk
losing his own job. Writer/director Francis Verber artfully milks the farcical
comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness, veering off-track
only occasionally into pedophilia. Daniel Auteuil ("The Widow of Saint-Pierre")
is delightful - particularly with a blown-up condom perched on his head, riding
on a float in a gay pride parade - and Gerard Depardieu delivers one of his most
restrained, and effective, performances. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"The Closet" is a frankly sexual, adult 8. It's so clever, in fact, that
Hollywood is already planning to re-make it in English, like "La Cage Aux
Folles."</P>
