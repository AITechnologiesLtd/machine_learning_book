<P>There are critics out there who want you to believe that Adam Sandler
is the devil.  I, myself, must disagree, because he makes me laugh.  In
fact, he makes me laugh so hard that I doubt I'll ever dislike one of
his films.  The guy is so funny.  He also has range (another point that
could probably be heavily debated), and isn't unbearable when he's
forced to do a little bit of acting.  I really noticed him in Happy
Gilmore (Sandler plays rage so well), and he was slightly more serious
in The Wedding Singer.  It seems now that he can only get better.</P>
<P>And here comes The Waterboy, a movie guaranteed to make a killing at
the box office.  It's a profoundly dumb film, and probably wouldn't be
much without Sandler, but he's in it nonetheless.  I am of the opinion
that Sandler can make any film funny.  He'd be funny in a documentary,
or in an infomercial, or in a sappy romance with bad dialogue.  For
those of you who hate Adam Sandler, I offer a half-apology for my
gushing.  Actually, I think you should wake up and realize that here we
have one of the most talented comedians ever to utilize a silly voice on
the big screen.</P>
<P>The Waterboy, directed by Frank Coraci and written by Sandler and Tim
Herlihy, is not a wealth of insight into the sports world, but it offers
a little bit of intelligent satire and a whole lot of laughs.  Sandler
plays Bobby Boucher, a social moron who works as a waterboy for a
college team.  Everyone hates him, and his only friend is his Mamma
(Kathy Bates).  It's inevitable that the evil coach Beaulieu (Jerry
Reed) fires him, and that he gets a job as the waterboy of a lousy
college team.</P>
<P>The lousy team makes fun of him, too, until he loses his temper one day
and tackles one of the guys.  But Bobby doesn't just tackle him -- the
guy gets laid out, and so Coach Klein (Henry Winkler) begs Bobby to play
for the team.  Despite his Mamma's warnings, Bobby plays for the team. 
>From there, the picture is pure formula -- Bobby helps the team win, his
Mamma gives him a guilt trip, the other team tries to thwart him, etc.
-- but at least we're never expected to take all of this seriously.</P>
<P>The real problem with an Adam Sandler movie is that there's not much to
look at besides Adam Sandler.  In this case, the supporting cast holds
up pretty well -- Bates is good as Mamma, though her role is perhaps a
bit larger than I would have liked.  Winkler is also pretty funny, and
Fairuza Balk, who plays Bobby's love interest, is interesting to watch. 
But Sandler is the star, and the film is really pretty dull when he's
not doing his dopey-eyed silly-voiced routine.  </P>
<P>I prefer Sandler when he's in his violent mode -- as he was in Happy
Gilmore -- but he's still a pleasure to watch in The Waterboy.  I think
it's a good idea to let Sandler write his own characters, because he
knows his capabilities and what makes people laugh.  Not everything hits
the mark -- a few of the running jokes fall flat, and the story, as I
said, is little more than glorified nonsense.  Still, if an evening of
laughs is all you want, then look no further than The Waterboy.  If
you're the type who thinks Adam Sandler is the devil, I'm more inclined
to send you my condolences. You're missing out on the early years of a
funny guy who will be around for a long time to come.</P>
