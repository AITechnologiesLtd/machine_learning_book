<P>Batman is not a perfect movie. It is a perfect entertainment. It takes
place in a dark world in which no one is safe. Police roam every street but
they are no match to the criminals. A new breed is rising. Led by...the
Joker. A grotesque face that never stops smiling is the mask that serves
Jack Napier, the criminal who, as a young man, killed the parents of Bruce
Wayne. Wayne swore that he would protect the night skies and grew up into
Batman, a cowled figure who, in dark shadow, swoops by the moon as a
warning to all those who do not abide the law. </P>
<P>Batman, according to the internet's Scott Renshaw, is at this point the
eleventh highest grossing film of all time. It made 251.2 million dollars.
It is the only art house block-buster ever made. Yes, I consider it a work
of art--Batman as Batman should be. Dark annd secluded, living alone in the
Wayne manor atop a stormy hill. But Burton never forgets that his subject
is a comic book character--he keeps him fun. Now that we've been awarded 
three awful sequels--Batman Returns, Batman Forever, Batman And Robin--we
can sneer at the Batman name, but that's not fair. Burton created a kind of
comic book masterpiece--I wouldn't quite place it on par with all-time
genre classics like Back To The Future, Jaws and Raiders Of The Lost Ark.
But all those would be in my personal top 30--coming from me, I would like
to believe that that is quite a compliment. Rather, comparisons with The
Fugitive are on par--it's exciting and funny, crisply edited and a joy to
watch. The Fugitive would be in my top 50--which is still a high place--and
so would Batman. There's a moment in the film when we see what a film of
this sort should be like--the Batplane flies by the moon--what an
unforgettable image. </P>
<P>In the end everything works out as planned and we see a stylish little
adventure flick that does what it wants to--it keeps all who watch
enthralled in the tale of Batman.</P>
