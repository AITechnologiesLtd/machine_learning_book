<P>     It's easy to describe TWO PLUS ONE as another Generation X motion 
picture.  It is, after all, about a trio of late-twentysomething 
Philadelphians trying to straighten out their lives and relationships 
to prepare for when they turn thirty.  The three principles are Eve 
(Dierdre Lewis), a video artist; Mark (William Sage), her career-
oriented live-in lover; and Julian (Tony Vito), her freespirited 
dancer/ choreographer friend.   </P>
<P>     Coming out in the wake of such films as BODIES, REST AND MOTION, 
THREESOME, and REALITY BITES, TWO PLUS ONE immediately shows 
similarities and differences to those mainstream motion pictures.  For 
one thing, the characters in this, director Eugene Martin's first 
feature, seem more real.  Their problems are of the sort that everyday 
people encounter, not the too-obviously scripted dilemmas of the other 
films.  As Martin says, "[TWO PLUS ONE] doesn't sound much different 
in its description from some of these other films, but hopefully when 
people get in there, they see themselves up there.  It's different 
from some other 'Generation X' type movies that I think are a little 
too marketed, and they're being rejected because of that." </P>
<P>     At the center of TWO PLUS ONE is Eve's growing dissatisfaction with 
her life, and her relationship with Mark in particular.  Two years 
ago, when they moved in together, there was passion.  Now, Mark is 
always too tired to make love, or preoccupied by his fascination with 
e-mail and the Internet.  This makes Julian's lifestyle appear all-
the-more attractive to Eve, who is looking for something - anything - 
to ignite her creativity. </P>
<P>     The storyline of TWO PLUS ONE is particularly laudable in that it 
manages to capture the everyday activities of three people in a 
compelling fashion.  By the end of the movie, you care about them.  
The resolution, such as it is, is the natural result of all that has 
gone before it. </P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the script doesn't always live up to the promise 
of its story.  The dialogue is often-stilted, and the voiceovers by Eve 
contain various profundities that signify nothing.  These, along with 
a number of unconventional camera shots, appear to be an attempt to 
add a dash of "art" to TWO PLUS ONE.  It turns out to be more 
distracting than successful. </P>
<P>     What the acting lacks in polish, it almost makes up for with 
earnestness.  After a few shaky opening scenes, in which all three 
principals are stiff and unconvincing, the performers grow into their 
roles.  Most impressive of the three is Dierdre Lewis, who shows more 
promise and range than her younger sister Juliette.  William Sage, a 
Hal Hartley regular, provides a familiar face and a stabilizing 
influence.   </P>
<P>     The score, by composer Matt Levy, is quirky, and includes elements 
of everything from rap to jazz.  At its best, the music complements the 
intricacies of the characters' relationships.  At its worst, when it 
becomes loud and cacophonous, it steals attention from everything 
else. </P>
<P>     TWO PLUS ONE has all the qualities of an independent, low-budget 
feature (its total production cost was under $250,000).  The intimacy 
created by the limitations of the production build a rapport between 
characters and audience.  There's nothing big or bold in TWO PLUS ONE 
- just people living, loving, and talking - about everything from the 
meaning of life to the relationship between the information 
superhighway and art.  This may not be the definitive Generation X 
movie, but it's certainly a different vantage point. </P>
