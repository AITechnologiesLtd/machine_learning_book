<P>     Making a movie about racism is virtually a no-win proposition.
Ninety-nine percent of the time, a film-maker will spend two hours making
it excruciatingly clear that racism is bad, inspiring either righteous
nods of approval or rolled eyes at the explication of the self-evident.
We all feel good abour ourselves as right-thinking people, but we get the
point already.  What more is there to say if you're only making a
cinematic sermon for the choir?</P>
<P>     There is another option, which is even tricker:  exploring the gray
areas of what makes racist principles attractive.  It's a risky endeavor
-- you might find people chastising you for not making racism obviously
bad _enough_ -- but it's the most potentially compelling.  For all its
flaws, AMERICAN HISTORY X grabs you because it throws you inside the
racist mind more effectively than any film I can remember.  The center of
that exploration is Edward Norton's creepy-smart performance as Derek
Vinyard, a young skinhead we meet in two incarnations.  Just released from
a three year prison sentence, he's a reformed neo-Nazi trying to save his
hero-worshipping younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from a similar
fate.  In flashback, he's a revered skinhead adept at recruiting new blood
into the white power gangs led by Cameron (Stacy Keach).</P>
<P>     Those flashback sequences are by far the most effective, photographed
by director Tony Kaye in icy black-and-white.  Remarkably, they begin from
the premise that Derek and Danny are both intelligent rather than red-neck
morons.  Devastated by his firefighter father's murder in a predominantly
black neighborhood, Derek has justified his hatred with ideas disturbingly
familiar from contemporary policy discussions about affirmative action and
welfare.  Derek is chilling because he's not merely spewing bile and
epithets -- he's making racism _make sense_ like a master rhetorician.
It's that kind of audience-baiting that makes portions of AMERICAN HISTORY
X so disturbing, particularly in a neighborhood basketball game sequence
where Kaye masterfully manipulates viewers into siding with Derek and his
skinhead cronies.</P>
<P>     Eventually, of course, the rhetoric of hatred turns into actions of
hatred, leading to AMERICAN HISTORY X's most devastating sequences.  The
first shows Derek leading his gang on a rampage through a Korean-owned
grocery store, terrorizing a black female clerk in a manner somehow more
unsettling than the physical assaults on Mexican-American employees.  The
second shows us the reason for Derek's incarceration -- the murder of two
black carjackers -- in a moment more shocking than you might think movies
can be any more.  Norton is perhaps at his most brilliant in this
sequence; his raised eyebrows of triumph as he is being arrested may be
the most memorable single moment of screen acting this year.</P>
<P>    It's hard to imagine AMERICAN HISTORY X ever getting made without the
redemption/salvation angle, but it would have been much stronger without
it.  Though Derek's transformation further emphasizes his intelligence --
he's forced to change his views when his friendship in prison with a black
inmate (Guy Torry) provides him with new evidence -- it can only lead to a
great big Moral to the Story.  Even more unnecessary is the contrived
device in which Danny is forced to write a history paper on Derek's road
to ruin, leading to a resolution that feels disappointingly pat.  There's
a grand sense of Shakesepearean tragedy to the conclusion, but not nearly
the intensity of emotion present as we're pulled into Derek's racist
world.  We get that racism is bad.  AMERICAN HISTORY X works because it
risks showing us why some people believe it's good.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 history lessons:  7.</PRE>
