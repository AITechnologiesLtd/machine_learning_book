<PRE>FUSSY DETECTIVE DRAMA DRAGS BUTT AROUND LOUISIANA
SWAMPS</PRE>
<P>First and foremost I think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the
PG rating it's been given.  For those of us who haven't read the James
Lee Burke novel that HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is based on, do not rabidly
go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of Alec
Baldwin and Eric Roberts, feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps,
gangsters with Louisiana accents, plots, sub-plots, more plots, and well,
really just want to see Teri Hatcher naked, this is one movie you're
going to worry the price of admission over.  Hopeful still?  Well, let me
share my moment of sheer panic, and then the cold enervation of the big
let-down when a semi-robed Hatcher purrs to Alec Baldwin, "What do you
think of my butterfly?".  Butterfly?, I asked myself, What butterfly?!
And then it hit me... the scene had been SNIPPED!  DAMN YOU, GODLESS PG
RATING, SHOW US HER BUTTERFLY!!  WE WANT TO SEE THE
GODDAMN BUTTERFLY!!! So... no naked Teri Hatcher.  Forget about that.
Okay?  Now...</P>
<P>HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is about ex-alchoholic ex-cop Dave Robicheaux
(Alec Baldwin) who's trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and
boat hire business with his loving, down-to-earth wife Annie (Kelly 
Lynch).
Everything dull, but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants
crashes almost ontop of the couple while they're on their boat.  The
plane nosedives into the water and sinks, but from its wreckage
Robicheaux rescues a little pixie-faced Salvadoran girl whom he and his
wife immediately decide to adopt.  What they don't realise is that the
plane's pilot was also a drug dealer, and that the plane had been
sabotaged by the latter's erstwhile colleagues.  When Robicheaux
discovers this, he predictably, against the advice of his wife, a
well-meaning DEA agent, and two gangsters who rough him up, begins
'poking his nose where it don't belong', we know that the man deserves
all the misery he's going to get.</P>
<P>The question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the
ride through a tedious, meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an
unlovable hero as your guide.  As Dave Robicheaux, Alec Baldwin is fat...
no seriously, this is not the svelte, thinking man's hero of THE HUNT FOR
RED OCTOBER, it is an out-of-shape guy who doesn't look too good in a
roof-top chasing scene.  He's also unconvincing in the movie's dramatic
moments, acting with what as far as I can tell is a Steven Segal-like
economy of expression.  Three-quarters of the way through the show, while
you're probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where Robicheaux
contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle, getting
drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up, you'll want to beat on
him a little yourself.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Mary Stuart Masterson (SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL,
FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, BENNY & JOON) cast as a down-and-out
stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air, with 
just
the right mix of cynicism, warmth, insecurity and humour to be the 
movie's
only endearing character.  Eric Roberts as Bubba Rocque, always 
believable
as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box (see FINAL ANALYSIS,
coincidentally also directed by Phil Joanou) is believable here as the
woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box.  And lest we forget Teri
Hatcher's role in all this, this being her rather well-publicised paid
vacation from playing Lois Lane on TV's "Adventures of Lois & Clark"...
she is totally ridiculous as Rocque's manipulative and seductive Cajun
wife, coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who's
trying to get back at an employer who hasn't been giving her enough days
off.  It's probably safe to say that her day job beckons.  And at the end
of our day, none of this is really worth 2 hrs and 12 minutes of our
personal misery.</P>
<P> THE FLYING INKPOT's rating system:
 * Wait for the video.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
