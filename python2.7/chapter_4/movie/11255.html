 Gramercy Pictures/PolyGram
 Director:  Joel Coen, Ethan Coen
 Writer:  Joe Coen, Ethan Coen
 Cast: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, David
Huddleston, Tara Reid, Ben Gazzara, Flea, Sam Elliott, Steve
Buscemi, Jon Polito, Peter Stormare, John Turturro</P>
<P>   In their uniquely idiosyncratic style, the Coen Brothers take
on the issue, "What is the state of American civilization
today," offering gems of insight that would make even Max
Lerner proud.  Or, as John Goodman in the role of the Polish
Catholic character Walter Sobchak suggests pessimistically
enough, what has become of "3000 years of Jewish
civilization from Moses to Sandy Koufax?"  (As in "Barton
Fink," another creation of the Coen brothers, "The Big
Lebowski" is most promising when John Goodman is on the
screen.)</P>
<P>   It's not that "The big Lebowski" is a tightly structured work
delving into the essence of life.  Quite the contrary.  "The Big
Lebowski," which features Mr. Goodman is a broadly diverting
role and Jeff Bridges in a luminary performance as the
picture's eponymous character, has hardly a plot at all.  Then
again, story line is not important, taking a back seat to a
series of Saturday-Night-Live type sketches which work far
more often than not, sending up our use of language as a
means of avoiding connection, noting our inclination to root
ourselves in the norms of the era in which we grew up rather
than in the present, and celebrating genres of Hollywood
moviemaking particularly the noir, which has been enjoying
quite a revival of late.  </P>
<P>   When you note that Ethan Coen did Philosophy at
Princeton and his brother Joel studied film at N.Y.U., you can
better appreciate where this movie is coming from.  Sharing a
platform more with the Coen Brothers' critical washout "The
Hudsucker Proxy" than with their considerably more
successful "Fargo," "The Big Lebowski" is philosophy with a
Mel Brooks bent and a visual sense which manipulates both
current movie technology and Freudian rhapsodizing. 
Substance is minimized: style rules.  If that doesn't bother
you, prepare for over two hours of good, albeit largely
sophomoric, fun.</P>
<P>   The picture centers on Jeff Lebowski, aka Dude (Jeff
Bridges), a laid-back, unemployed Californian. Dude's idea of
culture is a 1960s mentality complete with an occasional toke
on the weed, a relaxed mode of dress emphasizing baggy
shorts and ulta-casual shirts, and an almost religious
dedication to the bowling alley where he competes in
tournaments with his buddies Walter (Goodman) and Donny
(Steve Buscemi).  The narrative--such as it is--is propelled
when a case of mistaken identity sends two goons to
Lebowski's shabby Venice digs to collect a debt allegedly
owed by his trophy wife, Bunny (Tara Reid).  But the ruffians
haven't a clue that the man they should be after is the other
Lebowski (David Huddleston), a rah-rah, achievement-
oriented tycoon confined to a wheelchair because of an injury
he received in Korea, contemptuous of anyone who has not
been able to "make it" in our society.  </P>
<P>   Hired by the rich old man to act as courier of ransom
money to kidnappers who have reportedly taken Bunny into
their custody, Dude is conned by his friend Walter into double
dealing, a plan to keep the million in payoffs for themselves. 
Meeting the old man's daughter Maude (Julianne Moore),
Dude gets an education in erotic artistry, is introduced to a
porno publishing supplier (Ben Gazzara). Subjected to
episodes of beatings and in one case the victim of a spiked
version of his favorite drink, the White Russian, he submits to
a series of wildly adventurous dreams involving his flying
through the air in a variety of circumstances.</P>
<P>   The Coen brothers have even more fun with their dialogue
than with the imaginative visuals, making fine use of the talent
of John Turturro as a macho pederast who frequently
threatens the buddies and a trio of so-called nihilists who act
as the kidnappers, demanding ransom whether or not they
actually committed the abduction.  Some audience awareness
of the pop California culture of the 90s would be helpful to
appreciate the Coens' ripostes on performance artists and the
ways in which we delude ourselves regardless of education,
cultural and religious background, and the nature of
humankind.  Jeff Bridges shines in every scene as a modern
Everyman ironically put into situations that defy his relaxed
outlook on life in a film that may be instantly forgettable but
should keep you grinning for a couple of hours.
Rated R.  Running Time: 127 minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey
