<PRE>_Sparkler_ ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Director Darren Stein's debut film is on the flip side of the coin
occupied by his recently released, much-maligned sophomore effort,
_Jawbreaker_ (which I actually happened to like).  The micro-budgeted indie
_Sparkler_ is as grainy and rough around the edges as the studio effort
_Jawbreaker_ was slick and flashy.  The "sparkler" of the title, trailer
park queen Melba May (Park Overall), is as sweet and good-natured as
_Jawbreaker_'s main character, high school uberbitch Courtney Shayne, was
unrepentantly evil.</P>
<P>However, there is one overlying thing that the films have in common: in
both, Stein is aping the voice of other, better directors.  While he
channelled _Heathers_'s Michael Lehmann and _Clueless_'s Amy Heckerling in
_Jawbreaker_, in _Sparkler_, Stein goes after the demented vibe of John
Waters. Our white trash main character travels from Victorville, California
to Las Vegas to find a trio of young men (Freddie Prinze Jr., Jamie
Kennedy, and Steven Petrarca) she met by chance at a local bar.  Along the
way, she and the audience encounters such Waters-esque touches as
underground strip clubs and a butch lesbian wearing a T-shirt reading
"PUSSYWHIPPED."  The difference there isn't enough energy to the direction
to hide the fact that there is really no plot, just some loosely
strung-together of individual events; nor is there enough to make anything
barely cross the "amusing" mark.  (now playing in New York; opens in Los
Angeles April 2)</P>
