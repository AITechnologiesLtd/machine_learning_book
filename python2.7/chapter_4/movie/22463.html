<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>If you like nonsense musicals with plenty of singing, beautiful set
designs, fantastic colors, sex, witchcraft, and a fairy tale charm to
it, then you will probably like this film, which is in many ways like
FLYING DOWN TO RIO. Though, I was hoping it could be more like those
Jacques Demy or Jacques Rivette musicals, exhibiting a little more
substance. But if you are in a mood for some light entertainment, this
zany musical has plenty of oomph and should satisfy your Latino appetite
for something that is easy and sexy to look at.</P>
<P>The little known director of this film, hails from Venezuela, which
gives this French film a very natural Latin twist to its story and
music.The film opens in a Venezuelan church, where Ana (Ariadna) is
about to get married at the altar, but for some inexplicable reason
changes her mind and runs out of the church, grabs a taxi, packs her
Maria Callas poster, and is on a plane for Paris still in her wedding
dress. In Paris, she rooms with four other countrywomen, finds a job as
a housekeeper and another one in a bakery store, and decides to follow
through on her dream of being a professional opera singer by taking
lessons with a voice coach.</P>
<P>Her ambition is to get the great impresario, Italo (Lluis), to listen to
her sing. She wants very much to be in his next production of
Cinderella. Meanwhile she has problems with her visa, as her stay in
Paris is about to legally end. The police are trying to keep close tabs
on her, wanting her to leave the country. Armand (Frederic) is the gay
waiter who befriends her and offers to marry her in a "phony marriage,"
if she marries him in church. He wants this to please his mother; and,
she agrees to do this in order to stay in Paris.</P>
<P>In between the songs, that can break out at any moment, like in
Rivette's UP DOWN FRAGILE, the ever-smiling Ana, (after awhile her smile
begins to grate on you), will meet a nervous psychoanalyst, Alcanie
(Didi), whom she moves in-with after drinking a love potion concocted by
a witch doctor.</P>
<P>This is all done as harmless and silly fun, much in the vein of a long
list of Hollywood and French musicals, films that I was never partial
to. For what it's worth, this film is an entertaining and colorful
spectacle, and with enough verve in it to make it seem inventive.</P>
