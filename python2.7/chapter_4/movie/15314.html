<P>The tagline for "Enemy of the State" is "It's not paranoia if they're 
really after you." Leaving the theater following the popcorn thriller 
about an innocent man caught in a web of secret agents, surveillance 
equipment and deadly covert activities, I wondered how the movie might 
affect any genuine paranoids in the audience. Just imagine some poor guy, 
feverishly twitching in his seat, thinking "I knew it, they're really out 
there! If fact, they probably create movies just like this to convince us 
that these kind of activities are too fantastic to be true, thereby 
lulling us into a false sense of security." </P>
<P>For anyone concerned that the elaborate high-level intrigue portrayed in 
"Enemy of the State" reflects reality, let's look at a recent example of 
governmental effectiveness. It took conservatives several years and 
millions of dollars just to prove that President Clinton "got some" on 
the side, and, months after the revelation, he's still in office and the 
Republicans got clobbered in the elections. That, ladies and gentlemen, 
is how our government works.</P>
<P>In "Enemy of the State," Will Smith plays attorney and family man Robert 
Clayton Dean. Life is good for the Washington DC lawyer, until he bumps 
into Zavitz (Jason Lee), an old college buddy. After their brief 
encounter, Zavitz is chased by government operatives, only to be struck 
down and killed on a nearby highway. Dean, shaken by the death of his 
friend, returns home, unaware that Zavitz slipped him a disc documenting 
the assassination of a Congressman by the same group of goons. In short 
order, agents knock on Dean's door and the young professional ends up on 
the run; with his credit and job destroyed, his marriage in a shambles 
and lots of scary guys trying to kill him.</P>
<P>With "Independence Day" and "Men in Black" on his résumé, and "The Wild 
Wild West" due next summer, Will Smith clearly knows how to pick crowd-
pleasing movies and "Enemy of the State" should provide him another hit. 
The film, from "Armageddon" producer Jerry Bruckheimer and "True Romance" 
director Tony Scott, is fast-paced and packed with action and thrills. </P>
<P>As always, Smith is a likable and convincing all-American hero who 
manages to deliver good one-liners between chases and feats of derring-do.
 Smith works best when paired with older actors, and he has a great one 
here, with Gene Hackman giving a crisp performance as a former operative 
of the National Security Agency. The two actors work very well together.</P>
<P>As a matter of fact, "Enemy of the State" is notable for having a far 
more talented cast than your average action/thriller. Jon Voight gives 
his most focused performance in quite some time as a corrupt State 
Department official. The seasoned veteran is surrounded by a very 
impressive group of bright young actors playing assorted smooth-talking 
snakes, techno-geeks and government thugs. Stand outs include Jack Black 
("Mars Attacks!"), Loren Dean ("Gattica"), Barry Pepper ("Saving Private 
Ryan"), Jamie Kennedy ("Scream 2"), Ian Hart ("The Butcher Boy"), and 
Jake Busey ("Home Fries"). </P>
<P>As if that wasn't enough, Gabriel Byrne pops up, along with "Chasing 
Amy's" Jason Lee, James Le Gros from "Drugstore Cowboy," "Frasier's" Dan 
Butler and Jason Robards, in an uncredited performance as a Congressman 
with fatal integrity. Add "Angel Heart's" Lisa Bonet and Regina King from 
"How Stella Got Her Groove Back" and you're talking about one hell of a 
powerhouse cast.</P>
<P>Bruckheimer and Scott were wise to load their film with so many talents, 
because it takes actors this good to obscure the many implausibility's of 
the film. Beneath the non-stop barrage of high-tech surveillance and 
action scenes, "Enemy of the State" contains a coincidence-filled 
storyline held together by duct tape. In addition, a couple of the chases 
go on too long and the ending, while satisfying, is way too pat to be 
believed.</P>
<P>But, of course, we're not supposed to believe any of this. After all, 
"Enemy of the State" is just a silly, entertaining, over-the-top paranoid 
thriller and none of it could ever happen in real life. Or maybe that's 
just what they want us to think...</P>
