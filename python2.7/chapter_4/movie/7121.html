                       A film review by Chuck Dowling

<P>Normal Life (1996) 1/2 out of ***** - Cast: Ashley Judd, Luke Perry. Written
by: Peg Haller and Bob Schneider. Directed by: John McNaughton. Running
Time: 104 minutes.</P>
<P>With "Normal Life", Ashley Judd has now joined Debra Eisenstadt of "Oleanna"
and Robin Wright of "Forrest Gump" as playing one of the most evil,

shows up to her father-in-law's funeral wearing roller skates.</P>

Does he leave her? No. She has one day of rehab. That's it. Meanwhile, Perry
is having confrontations with the police force because he won't go along
with certain lies another officer is telling. Because Perry is so moralistic
and ethical, he quits his job rather than betray his principles.</P>
<P>The couple was already experiencing financial difficulties, but now things
get worse. Perry takes on odd jobs to make ends meet, and Judd just keeps
spending more and more money on junk. Perry, completely ethical, ca</P>
