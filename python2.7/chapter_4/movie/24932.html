<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Movies like "Gone In 60 Seconds" boggle my mind. Here we have a cast of 
Academy Award-winning actors. We have a scenario that promises lots of 
high-octane action and excitement. We have a screenplay written by Scott 
Rosenberg, who penned the entertaining "Con Air". We have that film's 
producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, who has also overseen such thrilling fare as 
"The Rock", "Crimson Tide" and "Beverly Hills Cop" (although, it should 
be noted, also masterminded that most gratuitous waste of celluloid, 
"Armageddon"). And yet despite these promising ingredients, we have a 
movie that just doesn't deliver. "Gone In 60 Seconds" feels like it can 
barely get out of neutral, let alone shift into high gear.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage plays "Memphis" Raines, formerly California's best car thief 
and now retired to run a gas station and go-kart track. Unbeknownst to 
Memphis, his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) has followed in his footsteps 
and is trying to make his own name boosting autos. But Kip messes up one 
night while on the job for Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston), who 
took over when Memphis left town. Contacting Memphis, Calitri informs him 
that he needs to steal fifty rare cars in the space of four days, or Kip 
will be killed.</P>
<P>Reluctantly agreeing to reenter his old profession, Memphis starts 
getting back in touch with members of his old gang, including mentor Otto 
(Robert Duvall) and ex-girlfriend Sway (Angelina Jolie); Kip brings along 
his own young accomplices to fill out the ranks. But by the time the team 
has been assembled and the reconnaissance carried out, only twenty-four 
hours remain before Calitri's deadline, forcing Memphis and his friends 
to boost the fifty cars in a single night. And to add to their troubles, 
they must contend with veteran cop Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo), who
missed his chance to nab Memphis once, and does not intend to let it pass 
him by again.</P>
<P>"Gone In 60 Seconds" is based loosely on the popular 1974 drive-in 
feature by HB Halicki, and I headed into the theatre expecting one of 
those movies which sacrificed plot and characterisation in favour of 
relentless excitement. I was half right: there's not much plot and not 
much characterisation, but it takes an hour and a half before the film 
even starts trying to get the adrenalin pumping.</P>
<P>The big problem with the movie is that it feels like it was made from the 
first draft of the script rather than the final version. Rosenberg's 
storytelling is extremely clumsy. After a mildly entertaining opening 
bit, we are sucked into a dull and overlong middle section in which 
Memphis brings together his team, checks out the cars, and reencounters 
old sparring partner Castlebeck. Not only is all this extremely tedious, 
it feels almost unnecessary. Rosenberg is obviously trying to give each 
of the players a distinctive personality but lacks the skill to do so, 
and would have been better off spotlighting just a handful. The result is
that Memphis' team consists of a dozen people all with minimal 
characterisation, and none of whom we end up caring very much about.</P>
<P>This is particularly unfortunate because it means that some very talented 
actors like Duvall, Ribisi and Jolie are pretty much wasted in roles that 
struggle for screen time. Duvall, for example, is consigned to standing 
around a warehouse most of the time. Jolie appears just long enough to 
remind us of the tremendous charisma she brings to any role, and make us 
wish her part was more significant. Eccleston, as the malevolent Calitri, 
seems like he could have been a delightfully cartoonish sort of villain, 
but appears only briefly, in the film's first and last half hours. Cage, 
meanwhile, seems to be on autopilot as Memphis; he does what he can with 
the paltry material, but there is no real enthusiasm to the performance. 
Cage lowers himself to the standards of the script, rather than trying to 
bring it up to his own level.</P>
<P>Examples of these low standards litter "Gone In 60 Seconds". There are 
some sequences which are so contrived, and feel so obviously shoehorned 
into the plot, that I found myself shaking my head in the theatre. For 
example, late in the film, one of Kip's friends -- a computer wizard who 
usually stays behind a laptop rather than heading out into the field -- 
suddenly demands to go on a heist. That he nearly screws everything up 
should come as a surprise to no one. Rosenberg's dialogue also verges on 
the excruciating at several points; Calitri is described as coming after 
Kip "like stains on a mattress", for instance.</P>
<P>"Gone In 60 Seconds" finally gets moving when after an hour and a half -- 
gasp, shock -- we finally get some car chases. These are undeniably 
engrossing, although I was disappointed that they weren't a little more 
inventive. Certainly, they are inferior to such memorable chase sequences 
as, say, Gene Hackman's in "The French Connection". They are also 
somewhat hamstrung by Dominic Sena's otherwise competent direction. More 
than once, Sena is unable to keep the depiction of the car chases fluid 
and coherent, and this difficulty in following the action works against 
its entertainment value.</P>
<P>But perhaps the worst thing that can be said about the car chases is that 
they lead up to the film's routine, lacklustre and faintly ludicrous 
conclusion. It is here that the laziness of Rosenberg's script is most 
evident, giving us an ending which not only steals from every other 
B-grade action movie, but also totally dismisses one of his principals' 
established characterisation.</P>
<P>As mindless summer entertainment, "Gone In 60 Seconds" isn't bad, but 
even the most avid action fan is likely to be turned off by the movie's 
lethargic pacing. Compared to the film's two hour running time, the 
twenty minutes or so of car chases seems paltry, given that the 
anticipation of these scenes is the movie's main selling point. "Gone In 
60 Seconds" will make you wish you'd been gone from the theatre in a lot 
less than 119 minutes.</P>
