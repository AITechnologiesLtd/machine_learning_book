<PRE>US Marshals (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Some say the ultimate flattery is in imitation.  With movies, though, I say
stay away from sequels -- even if they are quasi-sequels like US Marshals.
US Marshals is a semi-sequel to the 1993 blockbuster thriller "The
Fugitive" which starred Harrison Ford.  Tommy Lee Jones had a big
supporting role that turned him up an Oscar.  In US Marshals we move the
focus from the escapee to the hunter: US Marshal Sam Gerard.</P>
<P>In The Fugitive we were introduced to Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) who was
a simple but very intelligent man.  It was Gerald's striving for hard work
-- from both himself and his team -- that made for such an exciting movie.
Tommy Lee Jones revives his portrayal of Gerard for US Marshals.  This time
he's chasing another escaped fugitive.  But, this time there's no real
thrill to the chase.</P>
<P>US Marshals opens with a completely contrived action sequence that
accomplishes nothing.  The film opens with Jones in a big bright yellow
chicken suit, staking out a really bad guy.  How do we know the guy is
really bad?
He wears black leather, dirty jeans, has tattoos, earrings, and his woman
has real big hair.  A fight breaks out, the bad guy is caught, and Gerard
and his team celebrate.  We then switch over to a tow-truck operator
(Wesley Snipes) who has an unfortunate accident, gets arrested, gets bailed
out by his girlfriend (Irene Jacob), and then gets arrested again.</P>
<P>We find out that Snipes's character is suspected of murdering two
government agents in "cold blood." He vehemently denies it and says that
it's a simple case of mistaken identity.  Oh sure, we're supposed to
believe that. 
Snipes is really a super-operative for a deeply covert government agency
called the DSS, named Sheridan.  We find out that Sheridan is really a
highly trained killing Marine -- heck, who in a Hollywood flick isn't? --
and he is a hot commodity with the DSS now.</P>
<P>Sheridan is being transported to jail by plane.  By coincidence, Gerard is
on the same plane.  A failed assassination attempt on Sheridan's life
results in a plane crash and that is where only one prisoner escapes;  you
guessed right, Sheridan escapes.  And if you guessed that Gerard is on the
chase, well, you guess right again.
The setup for the film, up until the plane crash, takes a horrendous thirty
or so minutes.  Most of those thirty minutes were wasted  and strange,
useless padding.  I was relieved to see the action picking up after the
plane crash but was disappointed by the slow pace  which followed.</P>
<P>When the chase starts, Gerald's team gets an unwanted addition: a DSS agent
named Royce (Robert Downey Jr.)  As with all predictable movies, we all
know why Royce is really on the team and what his overall status in the
movie will turn out to be.</P>
<P>US Marshals is a movie about waste.  Wasted time for the more than two-hour
running time and an endless cascade of needless scenes.  Wasted talent for
casting good actors like Tommy Lee Jones, Wesley Snipes, Robert Downey Jr.,
Irene Jacob and Joe Pantoliano in such mediocre roles.  And a wasted sequel
for having a script that is not original but simply makes minor changes to
the original film and passes it off as a new film.</P>
<P>US Marshals is tries very hard to be The Fugitive Part II, with action
sequences that come close to mirroring sequences in The Fugitive -- the
plane crash for the train crash, the leap of a building to a train for the
leap of a dam -- and a story line that tries to be the same.  What is
missing in US Marshals is two things: the steady hand of a good director
and the steady pen of a good writer.</P>
<P>When I heard that Stuart Baird was at the helm of this film, directing, I
had a sick queasy feeling in my stomach.  I know as a film critic I should
go into films with an open mind, but I'm human.  Baird, who did some
wonderful editing with films like Superman, the first two Lethal Weapons,
and Die Hard 2, became a director with Executive Decision.  It was a
generic and bland action film.  I feared that Baird would also turn US
Marshals into the same type of generic and bland flavor of film, and my
fears were all proven correct.  I really don't understand why the pacing of
US Marshals was so awful.  It was slow and the action sequences were badly
put together.  The slow pace makes for too much time for the audience to
think of the silliness of the plot.  The bad editing and filming of the
action sequences fail to create the much-needed adrenaline rush for an
action film.  Throw in a dash of unneeded government conspiracies and we
have the making of a dud action film.</P>
<P>The script is unintelligent and confusing.  Writer John Pogue puts together
a script that is unnecessarily talky and reinvents the characters as
forgetful puppets.  Gerard finds out halfway through the film that Sheridan
didn't commit the crimes but still goes on chasing after Sheridan.  Why?</P>
<P>US Marshals could have been better.   The main failing of the film is that
the audience is never emotionally attached to Sheridan.  In The Fugitive we
were with Harrison Ford's character all the way.  We felt for the guy and
we wanted him to prevail.  When the focus of the film switches from the
pursued to the pursuer we lose this connection.  And with the premise of
the film being that Sheridan is innocent, we don't want Gerard to catch
him, so there is no connection whatsoever.</P>
<P>Snipes is reduced to portraying a guy on the run.  Every time he has screen
time he is running.  Jones is reduced to a standard-fare action hero.
Every time he has screen time he is chasing.  Had US Marshals been a bit
tighter in the story line and the editing, this would have been fine.  But,
the fact remains that US Marshals tries to be a thriller without thrilling.</P>
<P>It was funny for me to see Snipes and Downey on screen together again --
especially in a hospital.  The last time they were together onscreen was in
One Night Stand.</P>
<P>Some sequels work out well (Empire Strikes Back, Scream 2) and some don't.
US Marshals falls into the latter category.  With a silly script and an
amateur director, time is wasted along with talent.  Yes, there are some
slick stunts in US Marshals and there are some exciting portions, but the
time you spend to get to them is not justified.  Skip US Marshals at the
theatres.  It's a shame that this sequel was made.</P>
