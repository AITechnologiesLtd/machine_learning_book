<PRE>review</PRE>
<P>Stigmata: wounds similar to Jesus' wounds when he was crucified.</P>
<P>This movie is based on a real thing, and with something that happens in
reality among very religious people. If you know all that, then this movie
is pretty scary, because it shows the Stigmata, and it also tells about the
missing document of the church.</P>
<P>Frankie Page (Patricia Arquette) is a regular girl living in Pennsylvania.
She works and goes out and she doesn't believe in God. One day she gets an
rosary from her mother and then all the fun begins. Father Andrew Kiernan
(Gabriel Byrne) works at the Vatican as a scientist. So he was sent to see
what's happening to Frankie Page.</P>
<P>The setting is very dark and wet (it rains almost all the time in
Pennsylvania), and Frankie's being possessed by another Father is portrayed
as if it is a horror movie. Andrew Kiernan is more of a scientist than a
religious man, and the Cardinal looks like a mafia godfather, when in fact
he is one of the highest order in Catholic church. And most of all, the
movie lacks climax. The climax point was very obvious and it has a lower
intensity compared to other scenes.</P>
<P>This movie could have been a great movie, giving that ir was based on a true
story, with facts that happens, but the whole portrayal of it is just too
Hollywood, too unreligious. I'm not complaining that this movie offends or
misinterprets some religions, but if you're going to make a movie about
certain aspects of a religion, it is better to know the religion first.</P>
<PRE>Nice music though from Billy Corgan.</PRE>
<PRE>Indra Moeljadi
didn't know that the Vatican has scientists</PRE>
