<P>The following is a list (Larry Kink-style) of things that I learned from
the new film, Spiceworld:</P>
<P>   * The Spice Girls have the best teeth in all of England
   * George Wendt's career is washed up (although I should have figured</P>
<P>that out when he was thrown off of the sitcom The Naked Truth)
   * Sadly, Mark McKean (The Kids in the Hall) may also be having career</P>
<P>problems
   * The Spice Bus is very roomy and comfortable
   * Sporty Spice is arguably the most talented of the spices
   * `Girl Power' has something to do with Wonder-Bras and unwed</P>
<P>pregnancy, but I'm not sure because I nodded off for a bit
   * I believe that Posh Spice would best suit my mature and refined</P>
<P>demeanor
   * The best parts of the movie are when Mark McKean pitches ideas for</P>
<P>potential Spice Girls movie plots…all better than the one that</P>
<P>actually made it to the screen
   * Director Bob Spiers has proven that his previous flop, That Darn</P>
<P>Cat! (Worst 10 Films of 1997) was no fluke
   * I actually prayed for the songs.  The singing scenes were far less</P>
<P>vapid than the ones where the acting was trying to happen
   * There is nothing that can be found in a dark theater to aid a</P>
<P>person with a suicide attempt.  Believe me, I looked
   * The screenplay, by Kim Fuller (Tracy Takes On…) and Jennifer</P>
<P>Saunders (Absolutely Fabulous) is as annoying as Tracy Takes On…</P>
<P>and Absolutely Fabulous
   * The names of the Spice Girls should be changed to Red, Itchy,</P>
<P>Swollen, Burning and Painful (after a certain proctologic</P>
<PRE>phenomenon)</PRE>
