<P>_Return_to_Paradise_ (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Give up three years of your life or let a friend hang.  That is the moral
dilemma facing two young men in _Return_to_Paradise_, a largely intriguing
drama whose by-the-numbers paces are elevated to a higher level by the
strong acting ensemble.</P>
<P>Sheriff (Vince Vaughn), Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix), and Tony (David Conrad)
meet and bond during a month-long vacation in Malaysia, where they engage
in all the pleasures "paradise" offers them: women, booze, and especially
cheap hashish.  When the month expires, Sheriff and Tony return home,
leaving Lewis, who stays--in a not completely convincing plot point--to
study endangered orangutans.  Two years later, Sheriff and Tony, both in
New York, learn from attorney Beth Eastern (Anne Heche) that Lewis has
spent the ensuing years in a Malaysian prison, awaiting hanging for drug
possession.  According to Beth, if both Sheriff and Tony return to Malaysia
and share responsibility for the hash, Lewis's life would be spared.  In
turn, however, they would also have to serve, along with Lewis, three years
of hard time.</P>
<P>It's an intriguing moral dilemma, but with the unfortunate title
_Return_to_Paradise_ (the film's original, comparatively less snappy title
was _Force_Majeure_, the name of the 1990 French film on which it is
loosely based), the decision that Sheriff and Tony arrive at appears to be
a foregone conclusion, and director Joseph Ruben's slack pacing of Wesley
Strick and Bruce Robinson's competent script does not add much in terms of
suspense.  Thus the effectiveness of the piece is reliant on the actors,
and it is their effort that elevates _Return_to_Paradise_ into something
special.  The slick, selfish Sheriff follows a predictable character arc,
but his evolution is made natural and involving by the charismatic Vaughn.
He shares a nice rapport with Heche, who, after displaying her flair for
light comedy earlier this summer in _Six_Days,_Seven_Nights_, shows she has
strong dramatic abilities to match.  As touching as she is, the emotional
linchpin of the film is Phoenix, who creates a highly sympathetic and
tragic figure with a minimum of screen time.  Of the cast, Jada Pinkett
Smith comes off the least impressively, but that's mostly due to her
shallowly written and developed character, M.J. Major, an ambitious
reporter bent on creating an sensational international incident with
Lewis's case.</P>
<P>_Return_to_Paradise_ is not a great film, but its weighty concerns and the
care and craft with which they are addressed make it a diverting dramatic
oasis in the substance-parched late summer movie season.</P>
