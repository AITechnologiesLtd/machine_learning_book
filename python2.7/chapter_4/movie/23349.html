<P>The use of spirits and ghosts in stories has existed in ancient
folklore and continues in modern literature. It is a topic that is
inherently interesting to some people, and automatically
disinteresting to others. The stories involving non-material spirits
often presume their actual existence, which turns off those who do not
believe in them. When they are used for horror effect, which is one of
their most common uses, it creates an uninteresting experience for
non-believers.</P>
<P>This film is a rare instance of a ghost story which is engaging even
for viewers who do not believe in the existence of ghosts. The story
centers around the relationship between two primary characters,
Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment).
Malcolm is an expert child psychiatrist who is haunted by a past
incident when a disturbed ex-patient shot him. The young man was upset
that Malcolm was not able to solve his problems so he attacked the
doctor, and Malcolm feels guilty at not being able to help the
desperate man. After some time, he eventually decides to take on the
case of Cole, a child who shows similar symptoms to his assailant.
Malcolm feels that his will give him a chance to redeem his
shortcomings that lead to his assault.</P>
<P>Cole claims to see the ghosts of dead people. His single mother, Lynn
Sear (Toni Collette), has previously taken him to doctors who could
not help him. She struggles to help Cole lead a normal life, but the
meek boy is harassed mercilessly by schoolmates because of his
peculiarities. Cole is initially wary of Malcolm, but Malcolm gently
works to win Cole's trust.</P>
<P>The film is successful for two reasons. First, it is a simple and
cleverly crafted story. Second, its use of spirits is ancillary. This
is foremost a story about the relationship between Malcolm and Cole.
If that aspect had not been adequately developed, the film could not
have been successful. Although the use of ghosts may appear to be a
gimmick, it must be noted that the story also contains other
dimensions that are carefully and successfully constructed.</P>
<P>Good performances are given by both Willis and Osment, but the prime
credit for the film's success should be given to M. Night Shyamalan,
who both wrote and directed it. The strength of the film is the story,
and the direction skillfully executes it. The main complaint may be
that the languid narrative becomes slow at times, and it even drags
before the climax.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. This film is the rare case of a ghost story that
has appeal to viewers who generally dislike that genre. It is anchored
by a strong story and is supported by capable directing and good
acting.</P>
