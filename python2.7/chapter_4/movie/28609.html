 LONG TIME SINCE (director/writer/editor: Jay Anania; cinematographer:
 Oliver Bokelberg; cast: Jeff Webster (Cyril Troy), Julianne Nicholson
 (Phoebe), Julian Sands (Michael James), Paulina Porizkova (Diane
 Thwaite), Pascale Roger (assistant); Runtime: 89; Lucius Films; 1997)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is the first film to go from a Super-16 original to HDTV and then
to a 35mm negative. It was shown at the 1998 Toronto Film Festival.</P>
<P>Jay Anania's second feature is a very cold, intellectual film that asks
the question: Can we have a memory of what we only imagined? This is a
mystery puzzler without much emotional impact or much of a payoff. It's
imitative in its minimalist style of a Robert Bresson film. It was
intent on saying something, but you would have to be a mind reader to
know what it wanted to say.</P>
<P>The film opens on New Year's Eve, 1971. Robert Burn's Auld Lang Syne is
playing on the car radio and Diane Thwaite (Paulina Porizkova,
ex-supermodel) is on a rural road where she suddenly hits something with
her car, and before she can be certain of that she faints. She is
troubled that she thinks she hears a baby crying. This is something that
will haunt her the rest of her life.</P>
<P>It's now 24 years later, and the ice cold, blonde beauty, Diane, is in
NYC working as a noted illustrator of plant specimens for technical
science books. She has a robotic love relationship with one of her
colleagues at the foundation, Cyril Troy (Jeff Webster), who can't tell
her what research he's doing in his study of man. He tells her some
abstract tale about a man who drowned while reaching for his reflection.</P>
<P>For the first time since the accident she begins to have dreams and when
she hears Auld Lang Syne on the radio, thoughts keep coming back to her:
as she makes entries of them, does sketches of the faces she sees,
leaves phone messages of her dreams on her boyfriend's phone, tells her
hypnotherapist about them, requests hypnosis, and forms an impression
that something evil happened that fatal night. It is out of the blue
that her memory just comes back to her, as she tells her therapist that
the evil is not the shooting by a man of a woman but something that she
feels is greater than that; it is something deeper that occurred on the
side of the road on that fatal New Year's Eve. Though, she still is not
certain if what she envisions is a dream or a memory.</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoiler to follow.</PRE>
<P>Into the picture enters mystery man, Michael James (Julian Sands), who
it turns out is the husband of a woman and baby reported missing around
the time of Diane's car crash. When Diane's sleuth work tracks him down
as the husband of the missing woman, she meets him in his NYC workplace
and the mystery unravels. He tells how his unfaithful wife was shot by
another man, who was her lover, and how the baby was taken away in a
van. When she travels upstate in New York, she meets a small-town
waitress named Phoebe (Julianne Nicholson), who tells her she was
adopted at a young age and that she doesn't know who her parents are or
where she was born. Diane gets as warm and cuddly as she possibly can
get and offers the young lady a NYC job as her assistant. In her diary
entry she writes: I met someone today. But I guess she also lost
someone, because silent Cyril changed jobs and locations, and leaves her
a phone message that he's gone.</P>
<P>To go along with the somber and ridiculously serious tone of the movie,
there are moody vocals by Judy Kuhn. The film's cinematic style is
eye-catching and seems to be what the film was all about, but the acting
and the story itself felt forced.</P>
