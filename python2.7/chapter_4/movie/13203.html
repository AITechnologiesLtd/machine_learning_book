<PRE>WILD MAN BLUES (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Barbara Kopple
Starring: Woody Allen, Soon-Yi Previn, Eddy Davis, Cynthia Sayer, Don
Barrett, Greg Cohen, John Gill</P>
<P>I adore Woody Allen's movies more than almost anyone else in the world, and
I can't even explain why.  So a documentary on him that actually follows
him around, that allows us a sneak peek at his life, and shows us a Woody
Allen sans one of his script...well, that automatically appeals to me and
anyone else who watches his movies (all eight-and-a-half of us).  After
all, Woody is a paradox when it comes to celebrities: he's constantly being
talked about on the news for this and that, but no one knows a thing about
him.  Basically no one goes to see his movies, and only about 5 or 10
percent of the American population has even seen a Woody Allen film, but
everyone thinks they can imitate him and whenever you bring his name up to
people, they give you a bad look.  Seeing Woody Allen "unplugged," I
suppose you can call it, is incredibly intriguing to me basically because
I've been watching his movies for years and I couldn't tell you a thing
about his personal life.</P>
<P>"Wild Man Blues" conveniently comes out following Woody's film,
"Deconstructing Harry," a mind-bending, hilarious portrait of the public's
perception of him as an amoral, selfish sonofabitch which ulimately
questioned whether or not that was the real Woody Allen.  And bizarrely
enough, this film questions the same thing.  For about an hour-and-a-half,
we get to follow Mr. Allen as he travels all around Europe, stays at
expensive-looking hotels, plays numerous jazz shows, meets fans, and
finally has dinner with his parents back in Manhattan.  We see Woody
talking with his band, with various people, and even talking with Soon-Yi
herself, and the whole time we have no clue if it's really Woody or just an
act.</P>
<P>Basically, "Wild Man Blues" works on three separate levels: on one, we have
a reflection of Woody Allen, in all his glory, whether it be fake or not;
one another, we have a portrait of a subgenre of music that is almost
extinct today; and on yet another level, we have a subtle, classy rebuttle
to Mia Farrow's scathing autobiography, "What Falls Away," which, frankly,
made Woody out to be Lee Harvey Oswald (and therefore her out to be the
world's dumbest woman for spending over a decade with him).  We see a lot
of each of these, but no real balance of them.  The director, Barbara
Kopple (a two-time Oscar winning documentary filmmaker), at first wanted to
make a film about the band itself, but upon shooting a bit, decided to leak
a lot into Woody's life, and you can actually see this transition.  The
film begins as a nice balance between letting Woody talk to the camera and
showing the band both in front and behind the scenes.</P>
<P>But as the film goes on, we see less and less of the band, and we see more
and more of Woody.  And as we see more and more of Woody, the more
cartoonish he becomes.  When we first meet Woody, he's almost nervous about
talking to the camera, and he comes off as very serious and shy.  He
discusses why he loves staying in Paris, and talks about his music and why
he loves it, and not once does he say any great one-liners.  But as the
film moves along, he gradually adopts his screen persona.  It's hysterical
to hear him do his schtick (his criticism of Italian hotel staffs is
priceless), but which is the real Woody?  Was he at first too nervous, but
then became comfortable with it later on?  It doesn't help that his mother
at the end tells the camera he's nothing like his screen persona, and that
his movies reflect very little of Woody Allen the person.</P>
<P>I suppose the message, as unintentional as it probably is, is that Woody
Allen is someone whom we can never really learn of in depth because he's
different with everyone else.  To his band, he may seem a bit cold, while
to the band leader, he's incredibly friendly.  In his movies, he's whiny
and hysterical and loves to talk, but when performing, he says three words
and they play music.  The film is basically saying that no man can possibly
be the same to everyone, I suppose.</P>
<P>One of the main strengths of the film is, though, is in its moments that it
happens to capture, and those other big things that it shows us.  Some of
Woody's one-liners that he makes up on the spot are as hilarious as the
ones he has written in his movies.  There's the sight of Woody trying to
swim in a pool with Soon-Yi, and even a hilarious bit where Woody and
Soon-Yi continually keep missing eachother in a hotel.  And there's even a
couple moments that are manipulated by Kopple, like one where Woody is
being hounded by European fans of his, and the soundtrack begins to play
Nino Rota's brilliant score from Fellini's "8 1/2," which had to do with a
film director who is plagued by too many problems, like fans and producers.
 There's even a wonderful moment where Woody explains why he doesn't like
awards (hint: it has something to do with Brando...which is also one of my
main reasons for not liking awards).</P>
<P>The real expose in the film is not really Woody, but Soon-Yi, who is barely
shown as nothing more than a horny young girl of his, but here emerges as
what seems like the perfect soulmate for Woody as well as an incredibly
intelligent woman.  Seeing Soon-Yi tell Woody that he has to be more open
with the members of his band is one of the coolest things I have ever seen,
and it makes her out to be an almost maternal presence for him, always
giving him sound advice, and making him calm and pleasant.  Take that, Mia!</P>
<P>If anything, "Wild Man Blues" suceeds in telling us to give up on seeing
Woody as who he really is, and that we may never really see him.  We learn
very little about him in the running time of the film, but what we get is
mouth-watering stuff that makes us want to perhaps just meet the guy and
see what he's like to us.  I know that the fact that I wasn't able to see
what he's really like is disappointing, but for some reason, it doesn't
come off that way.</P>
