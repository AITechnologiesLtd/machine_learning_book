<PRE>BOOK OF SHADOWS:  BLAIR WITCH 2
-------------------------------</PRE>
<P>It's 1999 and fans of a movie called "The Blair Witch Project" are flocking
to the annoyed town of Burkittsville, Maryland.  Local resident (and former
mental patient) Jeffrey Patterson is cashing in with Blair Witch merchandise
and is taking four tourists on his inaugural 'Blair Witch Hunt' armed with
multiple video cameras.  Once at the ruins of Rustin Parr's house, however, 
the group blacks out (after a fair share of partying) to discover ruined 
equipment, shredded book drafts, and several hours unaccounted for on their 
video in "Book of Shadows:  Blair Witch 2."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, the original Blair Witch creators, step
back to executive producer credits for the sequel (they are supposedly writing
Blair Witch 3, which will be a prequel) to their smash hit "The Blair Witch
Project" and let documentarian Joe Berlinger ("Paradise Lost," "Brother's 
Keeper") pick up the reins as director and cowriter (with Dick Beebe, 1999's 
"House on Haunted Hill").</P>
<P>Firstly, this film bears no resemblance to its predecessor except for its 
adherence to the Blair Witch lore, so artfully created and expanded upon on 
the www.blairwitch.com website.  While I've heard preview audiences complain
that this film is incomprehensible, given thought, it very neatly 
ties into the legend, while also acknowledging the film as a media event
with a wink and an intriguing look at the cause and effect of violence in
popular artforms.  It helps to have kept up with all the Sci-Fi channel
specials (this one recalls the video/DVD special airing of "The Burkittsville 
Seven").</P>
<P>The film's establishing act humorously begins with MTV's Kurt Loder speaking
about the phenomenom followed by Roger Ebert's television review before
showing hordes of teenagers raiding Burkittsville's cemetary and Black Hills
('Get out of the woods!  There's no damn Blair Witch! screams the town
sheriff over a megaphone.)  One woman recounts how she so successfully sold
Blair Witch twig figures on her front lawn that she eventually was persuaded
to sell the stones from her rock garden for $10.  This is as funny and hip and
the original film's premise, although we begin to see MTV style edits of
disturbing images of torture and mutilation around the time the opening credits 
begin to roll over Marilyn Manson's "Disposable Teens."</P>
<P>Second act rounds up the new group.  Tellingly, young couple Tristen Skyler 
and Stephen Turner are working on a book about "The Blair Witch Project"
that asks 'hysteria or history?'  (As in "The Blair Witch Project," the
characters' names are the same as the actors who play them.)  Erica Leerhsen
is a Wiccan who wants to commune with the Blair Witch, who she believes
was a child of nature, like herself, treated in her time like some unfortunate
women of Salem.  Goth chick Kim Director professes to be psychic, immediately
sensing Tristen's unwanted pregnancy.</P>
<P>The group set up camp at the ruins of the house where the movie trio met
their demise and are immediately overrun by a walking tour group comprised of
two young entrepeneurs and their customers, a Chinese couple and a German
woman.  After a brief spat, Stephen's group coyly suggest they saw something
sinister at Coffin Rock, which sends the second group scurrying.</P>
<P>Alcohol and pot are consumed in abundance before the five awaken to find
the 'Hysteria or History' text fluttering down upon them like snow.  With
Kim's help, they find their videotapes in the same place Heather's were 
discovered.  Then Tristen has a miscarriage.  Do they flee sensibly after
all this (and a visit to the ER)?  No, they retreat to Jeff's home - an
abandoned nineteenth century warehouse in the Black Hills.  (Disturbingly,
the sheriff tries to contact Jeff when the other tour group is found
massacred on Coffin Rock.)</P>
<P>Joe Berlinger has fashioned a nice puzzle box where his film can be viewed
from two different perspectives.  The film, as we see it, is really the
recollection of the Hunt's survivors, as we see them interrogated by the
police - flashback in two layers.  However, as in the first film, there is
video document, which can be construed as either reality or as something
to condemn the survivors as 'enhanced' by the Blair Witch.  The film 
acknowledges "Project" as a movie, while allowing that where so many people,
including this film's protagonists, believed it to be true, that perception 
can become reality.</P>
<P>There are no shaky camera effects here - in fact we get special effects in
ghostly images seen by the quintet.  Once again, sound is used to jarring
effect.  Unfortunately, the midsection of this film sags a bit.  Where the 
first film was so believable because of its amateur quality, this one suffers 
when a line is delivered too dramatically in front of a steady camera.  A
reference back to the first film's 'standing in a corner' doesn't make sense.
Horror movie conventions, such as having the group split up when they should
be huddled together, call attention to themselves in this otherwise clever
script.</P>
<P>"Book of Shadows:  the Blair Witch 2" couldn't hope to equal its predecessor,
yet it's a surprisingly intelligent and welcome addition to a genre that's
usually a dumping ground for low budget efforts.</P>
