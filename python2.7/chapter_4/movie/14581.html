<P>REVIEW: What Dreams May Come
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</P>
<P>Cast: Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra, Cuba Gooding Jr., Max von
Sydow, Rosalind Chao, Jessica Brooks, Josh Paddock
Director: Vincent Ward
Screenplay: Ron Bass based on the novel by Richard Matheson
Cinematography: Eduardo Serra
Australian theatrical release date: October 15, 1998</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</PRE>
<P>Of the recent visual cinematic journeys - the dark obscurity of Dark
City, the tranquility of City of Angels and gawky lavishness of
Armageddon - none have been more revealing than the surreal environments
of heaven and hell; depicted in What Dreams May Come.  When Hollywood's
latest flavors of the month seem to be disaster sagas and teen slashers,
it's probably a good thing that post-death scenarios might well become a
hip new narrative. With this film, the above mentioned City of Angels
and 1997's Spawn, we've seen beautiful, imaginable and disturbing
afterlife images.</P>
<P>And trust Robin Williams to jump on the bandwagon.  It was Australian
director Peter Weir who originally took him away from comedy and placed
him in Dead Poets Society, and since then he hasn't avoided comedy so
much as he has chosen more meatier roles.  Williams is not as good in
this film as he was in The Birdcage and Good Will Hunting (two of his
finest films), but he sure tries hard.  Probably a little too hard, in
fact, since his frowning eyebrows and wrinkled forehead oozes a genuine
love for acting.</P>
<P>Director Vincent Ward pieces together the film in a way that hasn't been
done before, using lush visuals and stunning realism to fulfill the
daunting task of creating a believable heaven and hell (and everything
that lies in between).  In the past, when computer generated effects
haven't been as remarkable, filmmakers have often reverted to afterlives
on Earth (Ghost, City of Angels, and countless others) or yielded ones
that don't look entirely believable (Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey).  The
colorful world of the protagonist's personal heaven is wonderful to
watch, and a hell with hundreds of heads stuck in the ground is a
positively chilling experience.  Again, Ward tries a little too hard,
pulling off stunning eye candy but lacking a good amount of emotional
intrigue.</P>
<P>Chris Neilson (Robin Williams) is a children's doctor who dies by an
oncoming car when he assists someone caught in an accident.  Years
earlier his two children died in similar circumstances, leaving his wife
Annie (Annabella Sciorra) in mental turmoil.  Chris discovers that his
personal heaven is a world inside one of Annie's paintings, and is
guided around this wondeful place by a former mentor, Dr Albert Lewis
(Cuba Gooding Jr.).  Back on Earth, Annie commits suicide and gets a one
way ticket to hell.  Upon hearing the news, Chris is bound by love for
his wife to search her out and bring her to heaven, at the risk of
losing his own mind in the process.</P>
<P>Quite an intriguing idea, really, thanks to the writing skills of Ronald
Bass, a man who taught himself to read at the age of three and wrote his
first novel at seventeen.  Bass is good at his craft, but his love for
writing probably exceeds his talent for it.  He is competent enough to
yield a clever scenario, but fails to keep the screenplay witty and
shrewd.  Thus the film becomes far too lose and unstructured, as Bass
resorts to letting characters tell Chris what he can and can't do, what
he should and shouldn't do, and how he could go about doing it.
Frankly, I would have liked Chris to discover a few things for himself.</P>
<P>Over acting aside, Robin Williams is quite pleasing in the title role,
as is Cuba Gooding Jr. and Max Von Sydow (who plays hells tour guide).
Annabella Sciorra is the best of the bunch, giving a strong fell of
humanity to her role - although her performance is far from faultless.
Other cast members feel a little out of place, including Josh Paddock
and Jessica Brooks, who play the two children.</P>
<P>Both Robin Williams and Vincent Ward were obviously keen to make What
Dreams May Come work as well as it possibly could, and they have created
a good film; not the brilliant one it longs to be.  And the answer to
making it better isn't to try harder.</P>
