<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>It was laughable to think that a gambling ring can fix a race at a major
racetrack, such as Santa Anita, by making a white diamond mark on one horse and
then switching it with another horse marked with a dark shoeshine diamond mark.
But if the plot was silly, the fun in this Charlie Chan story was in watching
Number One Son (Keye Luke) run around like a chicken without a head, seeing
Charlie overcome being shot in the leg and being kidnapped, and how the film
captured the racetrack atmosphere. </P>
<P>Charlie (Oland) gets involved in a horse racing scheme among a gambling ring
when his old friend Major Kent (Irving) wires him how his champion horse lost in
Australia because a jockey, Tip Collins, threw the race.  En route from Honolulu
to Los Angeles by steamship Charlie finds himself investigating a murder, as the
major is killed by his horse kicking him. It is made to look like an accident,
but it soon becomes clear he was murdered by the gambling ring to get him out of
the way. The supporting cast is made up of many suspects: George Chester
(Dinehart), who has the most to gain by the major's death is married to the
major's daughter (Gloria Roy), and now becomes the principal owner of Avalanche;
Bagley (Muir) is the wormy trainer who accidently shot Chan; Fenton (Hale) is a
rival owner anxious to buy Avalanche; Barton (Huntley) is a professional gambler
who bet heavily against Avalanche and won; and, Bruce (Beck) needs money badly
because he wants to marry Alice Fenton, daughter of the horse owner. </P>
<P>Charlie is kept busy on the boat ride investigating all the threatening letters
sent to prevent Avalanche from running in the Santa Anita Derby. In Los Angeles,
Charlie must overcome being kidnapped by the gambling ring. He must also outwit
the gamblers by switching the horses again, as he closes in on who the
mastermind of the operation is. </P>
<P>It makes for a satifactory but not an always well-developed mystery film. </P>
