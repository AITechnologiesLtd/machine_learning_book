THE PRINCESS AND THE WARRIOR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>The strangely named THE PRINCESS AND THE WARRIOR (DER KRIEGER UND DIE 
KAISERIN) reunites the director (Tom Tykwer) and the star (Franka 
Potente) of the hugely popular RUN LOLA RUN.  Seen then sporting her 
signature orange hair as Lola, Potente played a tough-as-nails sprinter.  
This time she plays Lola's opposite as Sissi, a sweet and vulnerable, 
blonde nurse at a psychiatric ward.  Both characters stand by their man.  
Potente, who was recently wasted in the bland part she was given in 
BLOW, reminds us again of how terrific her acting can be.  </P>
<P>Because of a freak accident, Sissi ends up being befriended by a 
would-be robber (Benno Fürmann).  Joachim Król (GLOOMY SUNDAY) plays the 
robbery's mastermind.  The story centers on her need to get to know the 
man who helped her, and his need to avoid her.  Although Tykwer has some 
of his time travel tricks up his sleeve again, the narrative structure 
is fairly traditional, and the movie is not so frantically paced as RUN 
LOLA RUN.  Suffering only from a somewhat self-indulgent length of over 
two hours, the movie is nevertheless mesmerizing.  Although it 
culminates in the robbery, the film keeps its focus on the human 
relationships and not the crime.  Even if it's no RUN LOLA RUN, few 
films are, it is a captivating piece of work from an excellent team.</P>
<P>THE PRINCESS AND THE WARRIOR runs 2:10.  The film is in German with 
English subtitles.  It is rated R for disturbing images, language and 
some sexual content and would be acceptable for older teenagers.  </P>
