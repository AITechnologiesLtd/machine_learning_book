<PRE>"Jurassic Park III" – Effects Dino-might but Characters Only Slight
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>"JP III" is like "Alien" for toddlers.  In that sci-fi
thriller, audiences saw oozing aliens on a space
station stalking and munching doomed victims running
amuck.  So, if you've seen that one, you kind of know
what to expect in terms of thrills and chills
(although there's much less gore here). This film
takes place on a deserted island instead of a
spaceship.  And instead of oozing aliens, the hapless
victims try to survive several imposing prehistoric
carnivores.</P>
<P>Dinosaurs are the main draw of this film.  There are
plenty of them, and they are all magnificently
conceived using state-of-the art digital technology. 
We were first introduced to these behemoths eight
years ago when the first "JP" was released.  We were
instantly mesmerized at the effects back then.  And in
the third installment, you'll see that you have not
outgrown its novelty (even if you've seen that
dinosaur special that recently aired on Discovery).  </P>
<P>Among the impressive dinosaur population are
velociraptors that are eerily more vicious and cunning
than you had previously remembered.  There is also a
hungry 44-foot spinosaurus, a more temperamental
predator than the T-Rex that looks forward to a meal
of screaming humans.  But most incredible are the
pteranodons, flying predators (that remind me of those
aliens from "Pitch Black") with talons and grabbing
power that can pick up a Cadillac.  </P>
<P>These magnificent creatures, however, are more
wondrous than any of the human characters are.  
The cast includes Sam Neill, who survived the first
JP.  He returns as a devoted paleontologist who works
feverishly on velociraptor research, forwarding the
bold notion that they were even more intelligent than
primates.  They could've been the dominant species if
not for the great cataclysm.  Of course, these wild
ideas do little for his ability to raise the needed
funds to continue his research while scientists wonder
why he would rather study fossils instead of real
dinosaurs on those islands.  That's because, as he
says, "those creatures are genetically engineered, and
nothing on Earth or in heaven could get me on that
island."</P>
<P>However, an ambitious businessman (William H. Macy)
and his estranged wife (Tea Leoni) convince him
otherwise after promising to make a huge donation for
a guided air tour of one of those islands.  Of course,
the couple have a hidden (but not nefarious) agenda. 
With hidden agendas come bad luck.  And their airplane
crash-lands on the desolate island.  "You know," says
our stoic paleontologist, "we probably won't get off
this island alive."  Indeed some of them don't,
although like in those alien movies, the first to go
are the anonymous extras.  </P>
<P>There are some exciting and even impressive sequences
as everyone tries to avoid being eaten by all manner
of prehistoric monsters.  However, this film's heart
can't stack up to the first two JPs.  This one lacks
the human element that made its predecessors a bit
weightier.  This is primarily a search and rescue
flick with the element of family unity added in. 
Missing is that sense of majesty or the uneasy feeling
that arose when man tampered recklessly with nature. 
What we get is Sam Neill oozing with moral
indignation, Tea Leoni impersonating Kate Capshaw (the
scream queen from Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom), and William H. Macy providing goofy comic
relief.  Here, the dinosaurs are truly the more
evolved species.</P>
