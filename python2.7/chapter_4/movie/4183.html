<PRE>                            A MONTH BY THE LAKE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<PRE>                       A Month By The Lake</PRE>
<P>     Here is another film that should be nominated for an Oscar ... in
just about every category.   If you loved ENCHANTED APRIL, you cannot
afford to miss A MONTH BY THE LAKE.</P>
<P>     The stories of the two films are entirely different but the mood,
the scenery, the acting have the same wonderful flavor that was found
in ENCHANTED APRIL.  Vanessa Redgrave (as Miss Bentley) has never been
better.  I sat transfixed as I watched this great actress do her
stuff.</P>
<P>     Miss Bentley has been coming with her father to a resort near
Italy's famed Lake Como since she was a child.  Now a middle-aged but
beautiful and lively spinster, this is the first time she is there
alone, her father having died that year.  "Unmarried" would be a more
accurate choice than "spinster."</P>
<P>     Major Wilshaw, a wealthy and fascinating man ((Edward Fox)
unexpectedly catches her eye.  This is his first visit to the resort
and she arranges to show him around.  Despite some happenings that
might have broken the light relationship they had, they somehow
continue to see a lot of each other until the young and beautiful Miss
Beaumont (Uma Thurman), a nanny to two children, makes a play for the
wealthy Major.  That is when things begin to happen;  you will not want
to miss a moment.</P>
