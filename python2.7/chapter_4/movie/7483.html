<P>     Have you ever wished that you could become someone else?  That,
without regard for the consequences, you could shed your current
personality like an old shirt and slip into something more comfortable? 
If so, then you'll be intrigued by the premise of A SELF-MADE HERO,
director Jacques Audiard's smart, fascinating, satirical meditation on
the flexibility of identity.</P>
<P>     The film opens in modern-day France, with an unseen interviewer
asking questions of a seventy-something man named Albert Dehousse
(international film icon Jean-Louis Trintignant).  As Albert begins to
talk about his past, we see it unfold on screen -- his childhood in
rural, pre-World War II France, his life during the German occupation,
and, finally, how he rose to prominence in the wake of the Allied
liberation.  And, while A SELF-MADE HERO's narrative traces Albert's
life during the 1940s, a pseudo-documentary overlay offers occasional
commentary and observations from those who once knew Albert.</P>
<P>     In Lambersart, France during 1944, twenty-six year old Albert
(Mathieu Kassovitz) lives his life as if no war is under progress. 
Despite childhood dreams of going into battle and becoming a great hero,
he is content to marry a pretty blond (Sandrine Kiberlain), take a job
as a salesman, and stay out of the Germans' way.  Then, after the
Liberation, he learns that his father-in-law was an important member of
the Resistance, and, feeling overwhelmed by inadequacy, Albert flees
Lambersart for Paris, where, with the help of a mysterious friend named
"The Captain" (Albert Dupontel), he re-invents himself as a high-ranking
member of the Resistance.  Through a combination of hard work, good
fortune, and brashness, Albert makes the right connections and ends up
as an important player in the post-war order.  But, when he falls in
love with the vivacious Servane (Anouk Grinberg), he wonders about the
psychological penalty of keeping the truth from her.</P>
<P>     A SELF-MADE HERO has an extraordinarily perceptive script that asks
a lot of complex questions but doesn't insult its audience by offering
simple answers.  At the same time, it's a lot of fun.  Audiard has
designed this film as part-drama, part satire, and there are times when
the movie's pointed comedy is worth more than a perfunctory chuckle. 
And the often-ironic "documentary interview" segments, which add a layer
of verisimilitude to the project, open a window onto how modern-day
Parisians view their history of fifty years ago.</P>
<P>     Best of all, Albert's story is genuinely interesting.  He's a
fascinating character whose self-propelled transformation is a pleasure
to watch.  Mathieu Kassovitz (the director of HATE, who is just
functioning as an actor here) does a superlative job conveying the many
layers of Albert's personality:  his early desperation, his growing
confidence when he realizes that his scheme can succeed, and his
uncertainty when he realizes that his decisions have the power of life
and death.  Top-notch supporting performances are turned in by Sandrine
Kiberlain and Albert Dupontel (both of whom were nominated for Caesars),
as well as Anouk Grinberg.</P>
<P>     Albert isn't the only individual with an ambiguous identity.  His
late father's reputation is clouded by uncertainty.  Did he, as Albert's
mother claims, die as a war hero fighting for his country, or, as town
rumor asserts, was his death the result of unchecked drinking?  And,
later in the film, after Albert has established his reputation, he is
sent to Germany to weed out collaborators posing as work camp inmates. 
His success at that job is the result of his own intimate knowledge of
how to invent a convincing life story.</P>
<P>     At the heart of A SELF-MADE HERO is a simple question:  Who am I,
and can I be a different person?  The Captain indicates that there's no
such thing as a fixed identity -- losers can successfully disguise
themselves as winners, cowards as heroes, and devils as saints.  It's
all a matter of confidence and dedication.  Albert notes that "the best
lives are invented", and goes on to prove his words by actions.  This
concept has great appeal today, when so many feel uprooted and unsure of
who they are or where they're going.  A SELF-MADE HERO offers an
ambitious portrait of one man who used an alternative path to realize
his dreams only to discover that the richest fiction can never truly
supplant reality.</P>
