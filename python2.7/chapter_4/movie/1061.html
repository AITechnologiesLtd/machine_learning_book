<PRE>                                    BACKDRAFT
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     BACKDRAFT is a film by Ron Howard.  It stars Kurt Russell and
William Baldwin, with Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland.</P>
<P>     BACKDRAFT celebrates the heroism of firefighters, a subject seldom
addressed in films for some reason.  BACKDRAFT also celebrates the
beauty of fire with some the most breath-taking photography and special
effects I have ever seen.</P>
<P>     The real reason to see BACKDRAFT, in my humble opinion, is the
photography.  I had never seen fire until I saw it through the eyes of
this film.  And there are some eye-popping effects.  I read that
Lucasfilms' Industrial Light and Magic is responsible for some of the
effects, including models.  These must have been hellacious models
because they convinced me in a way I am seldom convinced.  I wish I had
the name of the person responsible for the fire photography here.  This
is an easy prediction for an Oscar.</P>
<P>     Alas, the rest of the film is a little more problematical.  Kurt
Russell is an irritating screen-presence and I wish he'd go away; except
for some remarkably well-developed jaw muscles I cannot think of thing
to recommend him.  BACKDRAFT lets him wallow in some major macho b.s.,
much of which is fortunately lost in the general noisiness of the film,
but more about that later.  William Baldwin is somewhat better, both as
a presence and as an actor, but even he cannot rise above the generally
inadequate script.</P>
<P>     The only actors who shine in BACKDRAFT are old pros in small parts.
Robert DeNiro is the arson investigator and as usual DeNiro threw
himself into his part, studying with a real inspector; DeNiro is one
actor who truly believes there are no small parts.  Donald Sutherland
does a wonderful arsonist, a part that invites comparison with Hannibal
Lecter in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS; where Hopkins nailed you with his eyes,
Sutherland chills you with a giggle.  The scenes with DeNiro and
Sutherland playing off each other are the best  acting scenes in the
movie.</P>
<P>     And forget about the women's parts.  They are strictly throw-aways
as the estranged wife and the girlfriend.  There are no women
firefighters in this superbutch world (and the black firefighters are
limited to silently admiring the principals).</P>
<P>     Really, the story, two brothers who find each other through the
ordeal of fire, is negligible, set-ups for the action sequences.  The
music, BTW, is dreadful, melodramatic and obvious, when you can hear it
over the noisy backgrounds.  Mostly it seems unnecessary.  Hey, I was
already excited, I didn't need musical clues.</P>
<P>     But, I enjoyed the film for what it had to offer.  As spectacle, as
eye-candy, it's well worth the price of a ticket.  Go and indulge
yourself.</P>
