<PRE>Is This Your Type?
The Love Letter</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"Do you know how in love with you I am? Did I trip? Did I stumble? Lose my
balance, graze my knee...graze my heart?"</P>
<P>Un-addressed and un-signed, Helen (Kate Capshaw) picks the love letter from
the countertop mess at her fishing town bookstore. Suspecting it sent by
Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), Helen's previously rusted libido gets a slippery
shot of hot oil.</P>
<P>But the love letter swims its way into the hands of other small town
characters with hearts of sufficient longing to similarly overlook it's
misdirection.</P>
<P>Splendid acting all around, the dialogue is also crisp. However, the overall
path of the film proves somewhat anticlimatic. Rather one dimensional in
it's intensity, the film could have used definition to it's dynamics.
Admittedly, this may be due in part to a three minute segment I believe was
lost at reel changes during my particular viewing. (Disclaimer: My grade
reflects only what I saw, not what I presume missing.)</P>
<P>Regarding the remainder of the film two scenes are extremely memorable: 1)
Before deciding Johnny is the author, Helen initially visualizes each random
passer-by reciting the letter to her in her daily life (from the local
police officer to a pick-up truck full of workman, tastefully filmed, this
serial interlude is wonderful film play.) 2) Janet (Ellen Degeneres) upon
hearing the news of a close-to-home homosexual love affair exclaims,
"Lillian in love with another woman? I can't believe it!" Again, this one
line reveals the good-humored nature of "The Love Letter."</P>
<P>That said, if you like "Murder She Wrote" you'll love "The Love Letter."
It's cute and quaint, funny and occasionally enduring ... makes a great date
flick too.</P>

Julianne Nicholson, Tom Everet Scott, Tom Selleck and Gloria Stuart
Directed by Peter Chan.
Screenplay by Maria Maggenti of Novel by Cathleen Schine.
