<P>     In 1995, director Darrell Roodt was responsible for CRY, THE 
BELOVED COUNTRY, one of the most powerful films ever made about South 
Africa's Apartheid.  Adapted from the landmark novel by Alan Paton, the 
movie provided an emotional anchor for those seeking to understand the 
fear, hatred, and misunderstanding that sundered the country for 
decades.  Now, in 1997, Roodt has returned to his native South Africa 
with a contemporary story.  And, while the film gets off to a promising 
start, it eventually devolves into a typical, formula-driven revenge 
thriller whose characters become progressively less intelligent as the 
body count rises.</P>
<P>     Ice Cube, a rap artist-turned-actor with a forceful screen 
presence, plays Vusi Madlazi, a South Africa-born man who has been 
living in the United States for the past fourteen years.  He has come 
home to bury his father, and, setting foot on South African soil for the 
first time in over a decade, he is reminded that he "left as an African 
and came back an American."  The truth of this simple statement is borne 
out in one particularly effective scene.  At his father's funeral, Vusi, 
as the eldest son, is required to sacrifice a bull.  Horrified by the 
thought of ritual slaughter, he is unable to fulfill his part in the 
ceremony.  </P>
<P>     Now that Vusi is the head of his household, the duty falls to him 
to travel to Johannesburg and find his younger brother, Steven (Eric 
Miyeni), who has disappeared.  Once there, he hooks up with Steven's 
white, crack-addicted girlfriend, Karin (Elizabeth Hurley), and learns 
that his brother is $15,000 in debt to a local drug lord (Ving Rhames).  
Vusi is given an ultimatum:  come up with the money or lose his brother 
to a bullet.  </P>
<P>     DANGEROUS GROUND is at its best when it tracks Vusi's exploration 
of a South Africa that is foreign to him.  When he is carjacked by a 
band of young blacks, he wonders aloud why "brothers" would do this to 
him.  His only response is derisive laughter.  Later, as Vusi roams the 
streets and nightclubs of Johannesburg, we see that "racial equality" 
has not been a panacea.  Poverty is widespread and neo-Nazi groups hang 
out in alleys waiting to pounce on unsuspecting blacks.  Drug use is 
rampant among the underprivileged, and the crime lords -- black and 
white alike -- are getting rich by sucking up the profits.  </P>
<P>     Unfortunately, as the film progresses, these elements become 
background material for a bloody "eye for an eye" story.  Vusi, who 
begins the film espousing a doctrine that "guns are for cowards", ends 
up hefting an AK-47.  Then, as if to justify the violence, the script 
introduces several preachy lines of dialogue about Vusi's need to keep 
fighting the good fight.  "Don't fall asleep!"  he cries.  "The 
struggle's never over!"  A voiceover narrative helpfully supplies us 
with the information that "drugs had taken over where Apartheid had left 
off."</P>
<P>     The best thing about DANGEROUS GROUND is Ice Cube.  Over a series 
of movies from BOYZ 'N THE HOOD to THE GLASS SHIELD, Cube has carefully 
honed his acting abilities to the point where his off-screen personae no 
longer eclipses the role he's playing.  Elizabeth Hurley, on the other 
hand, is ineffective.  Watching her character -- a stripper who never 
removes her clothes on-screen -- one can't help but be reminded of the 
restrictions (one of which is a "no nudity" clause) built into her Estee 
Lauder contract.  Ving Rhames is somewhat entertaining as the drug lord 
Muki, although the actor is essentially reprising the part of Marsellus 
Wallace from PULP FICTION.  South African actors Sechaba Morojele and 
Eric Miyeni (CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY) play Vusi's brothers.</P>
<P>     For almost a full hour, DANGEROUS GROUND kept me interested, but 
the more traditional the plot became, the less involving it was.  The 
final half-hour could have taken place in almost any city around the 
globe, using stock characters.  DANGEROUS GROUND never lives up to the 
promise and potential it shows during its opening moments.  In the end, 
this is little more than a more socially aware DEATH WISH.  The payoff 
isn't about striking a blow for individual rights, it's about the bloody 
carnage that inevitably caps off films of this tired genre.  </P>
