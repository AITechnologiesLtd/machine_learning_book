<PRE>                               LITTLE WOMEN
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Gillian Armstrong's version of the
          Alcott novel is an idealized Currier and Ives print
          of family life in 1860s Massachusetts.  The semi-
          autobiographical novel is very beautifully filmed
          and at times a real tear-jerker, but is somehow
          lacking in any real intellectual content.  It is a
          big children's book.  Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The most enduring so-called "girls' book" ever written is Lousia
May Alcott's 1868 LITTLE WOMEN, based in large part on her childhood
experiences growing up in Concord, Massachusetts.  The novel has
previously been filmed five times, beginning with a 1918 silent version
and including a British mini-series.  It was even turned into a short-
lived television series in 1979.  The sixth filming may well rank as
the most beautiful and compelling version, though certainly some will
still prefer George Cukor's classic 1933 version with Katherine Hepburn
as Jo March and Spring Byington as her mother.  The newest version is
directed by Australian Gillian Armstrong of MY BRILLIANT CAREER and
MRS. SOFFEL.</P>
<P>     The Marches are a very tightly-knit family of four sisters and
their ever-perfect mother.  The family lives in 1860's Concord,
Massachusetts.  I have heard about families like this but never
actually believed they existed.  They share everything with each other
and are bound to each other with a love that transcends even the rare
imperfections.  They do things like give up their Christmas morning
dinner, including delicacies like sausage that are almost unavailable
during the Civil War, to feed a hungry immigrant family.  The girls
read poetry, put on little plays written by Jo (played by Winona
Ryder), and steal glances out their window at the boy next door, Laurie
(Christian Bale), and his stodgy tutor (Eric Stoltz).  The girls roll
bandages and take care of the sick and hungry while waiting anxiously
for letters from their father who is off fighting for the Union cause.
The sisters do have their occasional differences, but they always give
them up with a sigh of relief when something happens to bind them even
closer together.  Eventually Laurie becomes like one of the family and
there is no doubt that he will eventually court one of the March girls.
When he goes off to school the film jumps ahead four years and everyone
but young Amy (Kirsten Dunst) looks just the same.  Amy (now Samantha
Mathis) looks like she has aged about eight years.  Each daughter
develops into the woman her childhood characteristics made her.  Jo
writes melodramatic potboilers and goes to New York (following her
mothers suggestion, "Embrace your liberty") to make her fortune.  And
she becomes romantically entangled (big surprise!) with a German
philosopher who shares the boarding house where she is staying.  There
is sad family tragedy, there is warm family love, and there are
romantic entanglements.  Remarkably, Armstrong makes this story of
traditional values (with just a light whisper of feminism) work for a
90s audience, assisted by Geoffrey Simpson's nostalgic camera work.
British Columbia stands in for Concord and makes everything look homey
and beautiful.</P>
<P>     The casting of some of the major roles is a bit too Hollywood and
not enough Alcott.  Trini Alvarado looks more like a young Andie
MacDowell than like Alcott's plumpish Meg.  Alcott had Jo be tall and
awkward, and even the film script calls for her to be plain and to have
her long hair be her one nice feature.  Does it sound like I am
describing Winona Ryder?  The casting of beauty in roles that call for
plain tends to oversimplify the motivations of the various suitors.
Claire Daines as Beth is the only daughter who approaches being homely-
--in both senses of the word--in this version and the only one for whom
we never see a suitor.  Susan Sarandon conveys the warmth and wisdom of
Alcott's overly-idealized mother.  She is always there with just the
right insight, with a nursing talent that puts doctors to shame, and
with a noble and charitable thought for others.  Kirsten Dunst seems
far too precocious as the child Amy to grow into the placid Samantha
Mathis adult version.  Dunst does a good job, but she will be
remembered more for her role as the adult vampire trapped in the body
of a child from INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE.</P>
<P>     Among other things, the film chronicles how Jo's childhood writing
develops into what she writes as an adult.  Here her imagination is
seen as positive and constructive.  But the timing of the release
should invite interesting comparisons to Peter Jackson's HEAVENLY
CREATURES.  And LITTLE WOMEN sorely needs something for the viewer to
think about when it is over rather than just being left with a warm
feeling.  I give LITTLE WOMEN a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
