<PRE>                                LITTLE BUDDHA
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     LITTLE BUDDHA combines the legend of the life of Siddhartha with a
modern story of an American boy who is thought to be the reincarnation
of a Tibetan Lama.  It is an effective and touching introduction to
Buddhism and an illustration of how the teachings of Buddha can have
relevance in the modern world.</P>
<P>     I found myself deeply moved by his film, though it has a number of
flaws.  Bertolucci unnecessarily prolongs the story by tripling the
reincarnation candidates. His casting of Keanu Reeves as Siddhartha is
questionable, for although Reeves is remarkably good here, he has
established such a strong screen presence as a idiotic teenager it is
difficult to accept him as the Enlightened One.  (Although his
performance is easily the strongest in the film.)  I think Reeves is a
talented actor who will eventually overcome this limitation,
particularly if he continues to stretch himself by working with
talented and distinguished directors like Bertolucci, van Sant, and
Coppola.</P>
<P>     I also thought the casting of Chris Isaak as the father was
suspect; he simply doesn't have the technical ability to carry off this
role.  And Bridget Fonda was wasted as the mother.  The film would have
worked better if Fonda had traveled with her son, though I suppose the
parallel to the life of Siddhartha made the role assignment
inevitable.</P>
<P>     In spite of its flaws, this film works.  It is clear that
Bertolucci has a deep affection for the ideas of Buddhism, and he has
managed to integrate the legend seamlessly with the modern plot--so
much so that at the end one leaves with the image of Buddha still
meditating under the banyan tree, as one is meant to.</P>
<P>     The Tibetan priests are well cast; they are exactly as they should
be, particularly the round, jolly one. The young boy also performs
well, particularly at the end.</P>
<P>     By the way, this film is suitable for children in the same way
that THE SECRET GARDEN (to which it refers) was suitable for adults.
It contains no explicit violent or sexual imagery that would be
offensive, and tells the story on a level that children of say six or
more can understand.</P>
