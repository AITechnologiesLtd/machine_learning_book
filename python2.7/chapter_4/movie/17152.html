THE THIN RED LINE (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Terence Malick</PRE>
<P>Writer: Terence Malick (based on the novel by James Jones)</P>
<P>Starring: Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Adrien Brody, Ben Chaplin, Elias 
Koteas, Nick Nolte, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly, Jared 
Leto, John Savage, Nick Stahl, Donal Logue, John Travolta, George 
Clooney</P>
<P>And so begins the hardest critique I'll probably ever have to write. So 
many movies I see leave me with instant thoughts and criticism(s), while 
others linger in my head days, even weeks before I can finally sit down, 
organize them intelligently, and write about them as best as I can 
(under whatever conditions I'm in). For an example of that, I re-saw "La 
Dolce Vita" this year around, oh, April, and by November I was finally 
able to come to as full a conclusion as I was about it and write a 
review of it. But with "The Thin Red Line," the much-anticipated World 
War II film and return by legendary-and-deserves-it director Terrence 
Malick, I just can't seem to come up with anything that either makes 
sense or shows that I know what I'm talking about. This film has either 
been overpraised or overbashed by many, and after watching it, I'm 
easily annoyed by claims that it's the best war movie of the past 20 
years, or just a bunch of pretentious drivel.</P>
<P>I suppose being admittingly pretentious myself does cause me to 
overglance the possibility of me thinking the latter about this film 
(although I wouldn't call it drivel because or despite my, uh, 
handicap), but I don't want to immediately jump to the conclusion that 
this film is the masterpiece that others are proclaiming it to be. It 
has a wonderful poetic and hypnotic feel to it, yes, that's unique, even 
taking into consideration Coppola's acid-trip-like "Apocalypse Now." And 
there's a whole ton to admire here, from the gorgeous cinematography 
(courtesy of our pal, John Toll) to Terrence Malick's gentle and 
beautiful direction that's in direct opposition of that of Steven 
Spielberg, whose "Saving Private Ryan" is as close to realism as this is 
to surrealism to some of the performances from the titanic cast, in 
particular Nick Nolte and Elias Koteas. But what exactly is Malick 
trying to say here, what is the film's raison d'etre, and what 
comparisons is Malick trying to show here between nature, humanity, and 
war?</P>
<P>"The Thin Red Line" is based on the famous novel by James Jones 
(recently portrayed by Kris Kristoferson in "A Soldier's Daughter Never 
Cries") about the battle of Guadalcanal, one of the most important and 
decisive battles of World War II. As the story begins, we see the 
native's way of life in the area, where two AWOL American soldiers have 
gone to escape, only to be shortly picked back up when an American ship 
passes through and spots them (the sight of beautiful nature being 
interruted by man-made steel is just one of the many unforgettable 
images Malick leaves you with here). One of the AWOL soldiers, Pvt. Witt 
(Jim Caviezel), is then reprimanded by one of his commanding officers, 
First Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn), and between them a strange union is 
formed: Witt, of the group that hates war and believes in everything 
nature; Welsh, with his cynical outlook on man. But this film isn't 
about either of them, to be exact. Malick's film, also scripted by him, 
doesn't have any main characters. In fact, it'd be not totally incorrect 
to say that Malick himself is the main character, and, as Roger Ebert 
pointed out, it's like he's trying to make one film and the actors are 
making another. A correct statement, but I'm not sure if Ebert meant 
that as a knock at the film, or something positive. I believe in the 
latter, but more about that later on.</P>
<P>The plot soon kicks in, and we meet more of those involved. The 
Lieutenenant, a man named Bell (Nick Nolte), is soon introduced, not as 
the intense, screaming maniac he is in the rest of the film (or the 
ads), but as resentful to his own commanding officer (a very brief but 
altogether not bad John Travolta) as his men are probably to him. 
Captain Staros (Elias Koteas) shows too much humanity for his men in the 
middle of a major attack, but confesses his need to be alone and his 
desire to be anywhere but in battle to his troops later on. Pvt. Bell 
(Ben Chaplin, sans native Brit accent) is constantly having flashbacks 
to afternoons with his wife, and wishes of returns to that, but then 
again, some self-destructive acts come about on his own part (like 
volunteering on a possible suicide mission in the middle of the 
picture). Most of the others are reduced to smaller roles, though, like 
famous or semi-famous actors Woody Harrelson (as an intense soldier who 
doesn't last too long, but at least goes out cinematically), John 
Cusack, John C. Reilly, Jared Leto, John Savage, Nick Stahl (another 
great death scene here), and [about 45 seconds of] George Clooney, most 
of whom just wanted to work with the director, even if it meant having a 
small role. In fact, the amount of film Malick shot was so long that 
actors like Bill Pullman were left sadly on the cutting room floor.</P>
<P>The main part of the battle lasts about an hour and a half long, leaving 
another hour and a half for a beginning and end, but not only does it 
feel like much of a plot, but it also (thankfully) doesn't feel like a 
three-hour sit, at least not for your's truly. I can only attribute the 
fact that it's not at all boring to Malick's direction, which, as it was 
for the other Malick film I've seen (the wonderful "Days of Heaven"), 
like that of a soft but effective brush stroke by a painter or the 
gentleness of a Bach concerto ("Air on the G String" comes to mind). A 
friend noticed no matched action cuts, but instead of this factor (so 
important that you probably don't realize it) taking us out of the 
picture's overall feel, it manages to achieve zen-like undertones, and 
the numerous shots of horrific battle coupled with shots of tall grass 
blowing in the wind or animal and/or insect life only help to make you 
relax into a state of hypnosis that is entirely unlike any war movie 
I've ever seen (again, comparisons to "Saving Private Ryan" are not only 
useless, but downright silly). In fact, this entire film is unlike any 
movie that I've ever seen, period. Malick, as usual, breaks several 
"rules" in the world of cinema, like lack of characters that the viewer 
can easily latch onto or see as a guiding point, and the use of 
narration with not one, not two, but about ten different characters.</P>
<P>But that's what I liked about "The Thin Red Line." It's like every 
single character in this film believes that he's the lead character, and 
Malick is only dropping in on each of them from time to time to see what 
they're thinking and how they're reacting to what's going on (Mike 
D'Angelo hilariously pointed out that it's like an "Apocalypse Now" 
where everyone's a Kurtz). But each narration or flashback lets us into 
the character's lives just enough, and Bell's backstory is the most 
heartbreaking and most easily identifiable, at least for me, with 
graceful juxtaposition of current times with the memories of he and his 
wife being intimate (almost heartbreaking, I'd say). Yet at the same 
time, nothing in the film is as moving as Koteas' Staros, who gives off 
an aura of such world-weariness and unhappiness that without narration 
and with his superb acting, I was even more moved (will someone give 
this guy some more great roles, please?). But again, where is Malick 
going with all this? Is he trying to merely say that nature is disrupted 
by war? If he is, he's not only making a terribly trite statement out of 
a beautiful film, but he's also wasting a lot of people's times (nothing 
should be that simple, and I sure hope this isn't an environmentalist 
war film). Or is he trying to show the loss of humanity in the midst of 
war? Well...that would be interesting, but if he's trying to do that, I 
think he kinda failed a bit: humanity does in fact seep through - in 
fact, a lot of it. Or is he trying to show the way we hide humanity? 
Again, if this was what he was going for, he didn't achieve it.</P>
<P>Or, as my best guess is, is he trying to show that everything that 
happens in this film is merely part of nature, whether it be of mother 
or of human? He doesn't seem to judge anything that goes on here, not 
even the war. The entire film is shot the same way: with graceful camera 
movement, and hypnotic editing of images together. Could this be the 
least judgmental war film of all time, a film that doesn't make any kind 
of statements on war and its subsequent damage to nature or humanity, 
but merely observes, I suppose, kind of like God or something omnipotent 
(a bit of modesty, perhaps, Mr. Malick?). Or is Malick just pulling a 
fast one on its audience members, trying to get them to think as hard as 
they can about something which has no real form or meaning or anything 
that is coherently meaningful? Whatever this film means or represents 
(as much as I am keen to believe in my theory), I was at least 
stimulated, and am at least not often quick to jump to the conclusion 
that if I can't figure it out for certain, that it's the one with the 
problem (although I could be wrong with this; maybe this film IS a 
mess...). But the point is that I was stimulated, and this may be one of 
the very few films (along with "Saving Private Ryan") that I can't 
easily pass off as merely "anti-war"...or, for that matter, "anti-war" 
at all. Frustrating, yes, but in a good way.</P>
