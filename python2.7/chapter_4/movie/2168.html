                       A film review by Jon Ridge
                        Copyright 1993 Jon Ridge</PRE>

RELEASE:  May 21, 1993</PRE>
<P>     Before BASIC INSTINCT, did you even know her name?  For a long
while in Hollywood, a name had been floating around that no one could
actually place a name with.  With such titles as STARDUST MEMORIES,
IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES, and the ALAN QUARTERMAIN movies to her
name, who could be blamed for not taking recognition.  But then, a
funny thing happened:  A director named Paul Verhoeven saw potential in
this sensual blond beauty, and took a chance on her.  BASIC INSTINCT
was a smash success and, although it displayed no "raw" talent in the
acting department for her, the film acted as a huge boost and stepping
stone in her very unsure career in Hollywood.  Of course, I am speaking
of none other than Sharon Stone.  Her interrogation scene in INSTINCT
has become one of the most infamous images in the history of cinema.
It also said that there was, indeed (finally), an actress in the
business who was willing to take risks.</P>
<P>     Stone's second opportunity to prove herself as a serious actress
has also (like BASIC INSTINCT) turned out to be very controversial work
for this budding talent.  But is the movie *good*?  The answer is a
resounding ... well, not really.</P>
<P>     Stone stars as Carly Norris, a recently divorced book editor who
moves into a sliver high-rise in Manhattan.  There she meets three
different men, one of whom dies in the shower soon after the film
begins.  The other two--author, and tenant respectively--are played
by Tom Berenger and William Baldwin.  Both men lust after Carly, Jack
Landsford (Berenger) a bit more than he should.  So, Carly chooses the
younger and more attractive Zeke Hawkins (Baldwin), leading the two of
them to several erotic encounters which had to be trimmed in order to
avoid an NC-17.  Jack's jealous, instantly accusing Zeke of a number of
murders that have occurred in the building over the past couple years.
*no*, Zeke says--It was Jack.  So begins the blame game.  Ahh ... what's
a girl to believe?</P>
<P>     In a way, this film seems like the perfect murder-mystery- sex
thriller (it has just the right feel to it that any sort of thriller
needs).  A good opening track by Enigma sufficiently sets the correct
mood for this techno-thriller, but the film loses steam as it nears the
halfway mark.  Stone is marginally better here than she was in BASIC
INSTINCT, but just about the time the film reaches its midpoint, Stone
begins to look tired, unhappy, confused as to why she got involved with
this project in the first place.  Too many reshoots, too much
controversy over quarreling between the leads off-screen, and Tom
Berenger overacting like never before don't help save this film when it
needs saving the most.</P>
<PRE>     SLIVER is a tawdry disappointment.</PRE>
<P>CRITICAL RATING:  ** Rated R, for Violence, Profanity, Nudity, Sex</P>
<PRE>.
