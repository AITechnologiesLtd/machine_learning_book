<PRE>YOU'VE GOT MAIL
Reviewed by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<P>Cast: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Greg Kinnear, David Chappelle, Dabney
Coleman, Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton, Steve Zahn
Director: Nora Ephron
Screenplay: Nora Ephron & Delia Ephron</P>
<P>Australian theatrical release: December 26, 1998</P>
<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 stars</P>
<P>At this point in time, no director has been able to make standard
computer screens look interesting in a movie.   I'm not talking about
spooky virtual reality (Disclosure) or warped cyber space (Hackers); I
mean actual, I-got-it-at-Dick-Smith screens.  You may remember when
Whoopi Goldberg energetically conversed on an ancient computer in
Jumping Jack Flash, or when Tom Cruise battered away on a laptop for a
brief period in Mission: Impossible.  There is just nothing interesting
about watching somebody read text off a screen, just so they can say it
out loud to save the audience from reading it themselves.</P>
<P>What is interesting is the prospect of finding love on the Internet.
There is a number of intriguing ideas which could have been developed in
You've Got Mail - having a chat room as a metaphor of society, examining
the net as a means to escape modern life, or how the online world is
just as vulnerable as the real world.  But director Nora Ephron's
(Sleepless in Seattle) only intention is to keep the film smaltzy and
simplistic.  She avoids any opportunity to study the medium in which the
film's protagonists use to communicate; instead, she studies the
protagonists themselves.  Ordinarily that would be fine, but Tom Hank's
character is boring, ditto for Meg Ryan's.</P>
<P>Two Internet geeks converse over email and chat rooms, and eventually
discover that they are in love with each other.  But these are not geeks
who wear thick rimmed glasses and are twenty pounds overweight - they
are in the cute form of Joe Fox (Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Ryan).  Fox
owns Manhattan's largest book chain, and when he opens a new superstore
it threatens to destroy Kelly's small bookstore "The Shop Around the
Corner."  In "real life," these two are sworn enemies, but over the
Internet - unaware of who they are conversing with - they share intimate
details of their lives.</P>
<P>So what we have is a film with uninteresting central characters, no
opportunities to explore their obsessive usage of email, and a film as
meaningful as a Pamela Anderson home movie.  If not for a few strong
(but repressed) performances and some occasional touching moments,
You've Got Mail could have easily infected the holiday season with the
Very Bad Filmmaking virus.  Although, it must be said that some viewers
will have no problem enjoying the central romance (judging from the
squealing girls sitting in front of me, I'd say it would be most enjoyed
by females aged 12-18), and for most, You've Got Mail will be hard to
hate.  For me, it was hard to like.</P>
