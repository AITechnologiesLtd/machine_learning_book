<PRE>                    GOYA IN BORDEAUX (Goya en Burdeos)
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>I'll admit, I have fit all my knowledge of Spanish painter Francisco
Goya into the sentence you're reading right now.  What's a Spanish
painter doing in Bordeaux, France?  I don't know, and after watching
this film, I still don't know.  I had to read a synopsis on the movie's
web site to find out he had been exiled there.  I'm still not sure why.</P>
<P>To be certain, Goya in Bordeaux assumes the audience is deeply intimate
with his Goya's work, his life, and his politics.  It's a love letter
written to the man by writer/director Carlos Saura, who clearly
idealizes everything about the artist.  Unless you are like Saura, this
will undoubtedly be seen as a not good thing.</P>
<P>The story, as it is, gives us an ancient and fat Goya (Francisco Rabal),
in aforementioned exile, recounting his life to the impossibly young
daughter of who-knows-how-many love affairs.  A great lover in his
younger days (played by José Coronado) during the late 1700's -- and
aren't all Spanish men in film great lovers? -- he hung with the
powdered wig set as his dark paintings brought the ire of Spanish
"absolutists."  Going deaf at the age of 46, Goya soon turned into a
bitter man, his work taking on ever more morose and disturbing themes,
eventually driving him to near insanity.  And France.</P>
<P>Goya's work is generously on display in the film, unlike most entries
into the genre which do not get permission to show the works and end up
having to fake it (see garbage like Surviving Picasso and Love is the
Devil for examples of how bad this is).  Through his deathbed
hallucinations, we even get to see Goya's most famous works reenacted
and come to life -- with zombies coming out of the walls to attack our
slumbering hero.  These sequences reminded me of everything from 2001 to
Vertigo, and Saura's lighting trickery and flair with the scenes rescue
Goya from entering a canon of truly atrocious painter-biopics.</P>
<P>Too bad the rest of the movie is nowhere near as successful.  Coronado
is a dashing leading man, but his portrayal of Goya is so perplexing due
to its lack of exposition, one wonders if he is being true to his
character or even his surroundings.  The political context of Spain in
1780 isn't something many moviegoers or I are going to have at the top
of their minds, and the film does nothing to help you through it.</P>
<P>Then again, this is a Spanish film about a Spanish national treasure.  I
don't remember Mel Gibson going out of his way to explain the
revolutionary background of The Patriot, either.</P>
