<PRE>                              A PERFECT WORLD
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  This is something of a departure for
     Eastwood, a gritty and realistic crime drama that slowly
     fades into a story with warm relationships.  Costner has
     center stage as an escaped convict who forms a father-son
     relationship with his young hostage.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     Clint Eastwood has built a career on playing violent characters,
particularly his "Man with No Name" and Dirty Harry.  Two films back he made
UNFORGIVEN, an anti-violence Western that was nonetheless violent.  There
was speculation that his films would be less violent from that point on and
that UNFORGIVEN was a sort of penance.  The next film he starred in, IN THE
LINE OF FIRE, was another film in the "Dirty Harry" mold, but Eastwood
claimed that he had no artistic control and was just an actor playing a
part.  Eastwood has now directed his first film since UNFORGIVEN.  Like
UNFORGIVEN it is a film with some violence, but at the same time does not
glorify that violence.</P>
<P>     Kevin Costner plays Butch Haynes, who breaks out of a Texas prison on
Halloween night of 1963 together with Terry Pugh, a brutal hood.  Along the
way they pick up an eight-year-old hostage, Philip, played by T. J. Lowther.
On their trail is Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Eastwood) who has been assigned
a state criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern).  This is a Clint Eastwood
film, so of course Dern is along to play the required female lead to be
subjected to the Eastwood character's insensitive male chauvinism in the
early parts of the film but to be won over by Eastwood in the later parts of
the film.  In this outing, however, Eastwood and Dern take a backseat to
Costner and Lowther, who play the real main characters of the film, Haynes
and Philip.  Eventually it is just Haynes and Philip on the run and learning
to get along with each other.  Lowther is attracted to the father figure he
was missing at home, Costner is torn between his anti-social urges and his
desire to be a better father figure to Philip than Haynes's father had been
to Haynes.  Costner make a very believable Texas con.</P>
<P>     Much of the story is told with very little mood music as Eastwood
adopts the realistic style of IN COLD BLOOD and BADLANDS.  Unfortunately
that is only the part of the story about the fugitives.  The witty in-
fighting of the police on the case and comic bits involving an aluminum
trailer serving as police headquarters for the Texas backroad chase tend to
sabotage the almost documentary style of the fugitives' story.  Eventually
this part of the plot gives in to more humanistic values and we get some
more background music to tell us how to feel about what we are experiencing.</P>
<P>     Costner's character is one of the more complex ones we have seen on the
screen in a while, particularly in an Eastwood film.  His unfinished
business with his own father has led him to idolize children and his
violence is usually triggered by his seeing a child not being treated well.
He is infuriated to discover that Philip's religion, Jehovah's Witness, does
not allow the boy to trick or treat or to go to carnivals and does not
distinguish between religious restrictions and parental brutality.  It is
the combination of his own unintended cruelty to his young companion and his
desire to protect the boy that lead the story to its denouement.</P>
<P>     Eastwood makes a few beginner's mistakes not expected of an experienced
director.  There are serious continuity flaws, particularly with arm
positions in a key scene at both the beginning and end of the film.  This
combined with the uneven style do not sink the film, but certainly count
against it.  My rating for A PERFECT WORLD would be a less than perfect +1
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
