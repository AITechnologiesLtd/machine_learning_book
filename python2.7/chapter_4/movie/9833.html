<P>     ONE NIGHT STAND, director Mike Figgis' follow-up to his critically 
acclaimed 1995 feature, LEAVING LAS VEGAS, is a peculiar combination of 
two disparate plot ideas and approaches.  The first, a finely-realized 
portrait of a man and woman's striving to connect and find comfort in a 
culture that embraces emotional isolation, comprises the first thirty 
minutes.  The other, a sometimes-tedious, often absurd soap opera about 
marital difficulties, is so much more shallow and uninvolving that it's 
difficult to believe that both are the product of one man's imagination.  </P>
<P>     ONE NIGHT STAND revolves around the relationships of two married 
couples.  The film introduces us to Max (Wesley Snipes), our narrator, a 
highly successful TV commercial director who's in New York on business.  
While there, he stops by to see an old friend, Charlie (Robert Downey 
Jr.), who has been diagnosed as HIV+.  Over the years, a rift has 
developed between the former buddies, and Max is eager to repair it.  
Back at his hotel, Max finds his attention arrested by a beautiful blond 
woman, Karen (Nastassja Kinski).  After she points out an ink spot on 
his shirt, she invites him to her room so he can change his shirt.  
Later that night, after he misses his flight to L.A., he joins Karen at 
a concert.  Afterwards, following an attempted mugging, they end up 
sleeping together.  The next day, Max returns to the West Coast, where 
his lively, sex-starved wife, Mimi (Ming-Na Wen), is waiting for him.</P>
<P>     That's the good part of the film.  The scenes between Max and Karen 
are well-realized, with an interesting photographic style that captures 
both the characters' desperation and the eroticism of the situation, and 
a haunting jazz score composed by writer/director Figgis.  Although both 
individuals claim to be happily married, it's plain that they both crave 
a closeness and connection that they don't have with their spouses.  For 
Max and Karen, sex isn't an expression of passion or physical pleasure, 
but an attempt to plug an emotional void.  They don't love each other, 
but they fulfill a need.</P>
<P>     Then, following a caption that reads "One year later," ONE NIGHT 
STAND undergoes a precipitous drop in quality.  Max, accompanied by 
Mimi, is back in New York because Charlie is dying.  In his friend's 
hospital room, he unexpectedly encounters Karen, who turns out to be the 
wife of Charlie's brother, Vernon (Kyle MacLachlan).  The next hour is 
filled with Charlie's seemingly-endless death, pregnant glances between 
Karen and Max, and an unbelievably dull dinner where the two couples 
engage in all sorts of pointless conversation.  The "surprising" twist 
at the end, which is anything but unexpected, causes ONE NIGHT STAND to 
conclude on a sour, contrived note.</P>
<P>     None of the character interaction in the film's second act comes 
close to matching that of the first act.  And, while Robert Downey Jr. 
gives a powerful performance as the dying Charlie, it's not an original 
role.  In fact, the bedridden, AIDS-inflicted individual has been used 
so often that it's in danger of becoming a cliché, and Figgis' 
interpretation of this character doesn't offer anything new.  Charlie is 
basically just a plot device to reunite Max and Karen so they can 
complete their unfinished business.</P>
<P>     Because Max is the narrator, he is the best developed of the five 
principles.  Snipes, who occasionally mixes in a serious role amidst 
action pictures (take his fine work in THE WATERDANCE, for example), is 
believable as a successful-but-frustrated artist, although questions 
about his latent homosexuality are never answered.  Kinski's Karen is 
largely one-dimensional, but the actress successfully uncovers her 
alter-ego's emotional core.  Both Mimi and Vernon are underdeveloped, 
although the vivacious Ming-Na Wen gives a strong enough performance to 
capture our attention, if not our interest.  Kyle MacLachlan, on the 
other hand, is boring.</P>
<P>     After the emotional wallop delivered by LEAVING LAS VEGAS, the 
uneven, soap opera-ish presentation of ONE NIGHT STAND is disappointing.  
When Figgis' film is exploring emotional isolation, it rings true, but 
when it tries to mix and match couples and expand the Karen/Max 
relationship onto a larger canvas, it loses its focus.  This is one of 
those rare movies where it might be worthwhile to leave partway through.  
Once the timespan fast-forwards fifty-two weeks, ONE NIGHT STAND has 
presented almost everything of value that it has to offer.  After that, 
it's a slow burn to a predictable finish.</P>
