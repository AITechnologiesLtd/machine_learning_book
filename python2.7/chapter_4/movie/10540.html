A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Jim Sheridan</PRE>
<P>Written by: Jim Sheridan and Terry George</P>
<P>Starring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Emily Watson, Gerard McSorley</P>
<P>Synopsis:
Irish boxer Danny Flynn has just gotten out of prison. He was in an
Irish prison because he took the rap for an Irish Republican Army buddy
named Harry (Gerard McSorley). Danny has suffered his 14-year sentence
in silence without ratting on anyone and now he is finally out.
Unfortunately, he lives in Belfast, Northern Ireland, an urban setting
where Catholics and Protestants are in violent political confrontation
with each other, and random bombings are a fact of life. Back on the
street, Danny tries to sort out his life by starting a boxing training
center. He also restarts a relationship with his former lover, Maggie
(Emily Watson) who is now married to a jailed IRA terrorist and has a
preteen boy. Danny fights a total of two boxing opponents during the
entire film, which is not about boxing. The film is actually about
intense sadness and despair and a messed up political situation which
can't seem to be solved. THE BOXER is a sympathy movie about Northern
Ireland.</P>
<P>Opinion:
There is a lot of fine acting in this movie, but the film crawls along a
little too slowly for my tastes; it has a slow pace and people speak
slowly, too. An oft heard line seems to be, "What do you mean?" THE
BOXER succeeds in portraying the dismal, unresolved, and hopelessly
depressing life of occupied Belfast more so than telling any story about
boxing competition. </P>
<P>Speaking of boxing, I think actor Daniel Day-Lewis makes a very credible
boxer. His character is intense and brooding. His hands are fairly fast,
and he has nimble footwork. He throws the left straight, with crispness
and authority. Punches thrown with the right hand, however, have a
crooked looping motion, and seem weaker. Daniel would probably make a
passable real life southpaw, provided he remembers not to drop his left
guard after each punch. </P>
