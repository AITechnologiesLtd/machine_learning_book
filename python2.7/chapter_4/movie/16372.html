<PRE>PLAYING BY HEART
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>It will come as no surprise to fans of Elvis Costello that his 
beautifully expressed observation that "writing about music is like 
dancing about architecture" has served as inspiration for a motion 
picture.</P>
<P>In writer/director Willard Carroll's articulate "Playing by Heart" (a 
film that was originally titled "Dancing About Architecture"), talking 
about love is said to be as foolish a pastime.  Yet this early assertion 
paves the way for an examination of how people find love, how others 
hang onto it, and how some are forced to let it go.</P>
<P>The city of Los Angeles forms the backdrop for an ensemble piece that 
in many ways resembles Alan Rudolph's "Welcome to L.A."  While "Playing 
by Heart" doesn't quite capture the mood and seductive atmosphere of 
Rudolph's film, it makes for an interesting companion piece in its 
observations about human interactions.</P>
<P>In "Welcome to L.A.," Richard Baskin's songs were woven conspicuously 
into the framework of the film; here, John Barry's soft and fragmented 
score is pretty much relegated to the background, providing a delicate 
dotting of the I's and crossing of the T's after the actors have spoken 
their often-wordy piece.  The writing isn't always there--either Carroll 
has too many characters, or too many points he wants to make--but for 
every interchange of languid dialogue there's a scene that's 
surprisingly potent.</P>
<P>Billed as a romantic comedy with a twist, the film actually serves up a 
number of twists along the way, including the print ads' tip-off that 
"these three couples are about to come together in an unexpected way..."</P>
<P>Joan and Keenan meet at a rave.  Joan is vivacious and relentless in 
her pursuits; Keenan is restrained and consistent in his brush-offs.  
This makes Joan crazy for him.  The couple are played by Angelina Jolie 
(Jon Voight's daughter) and Ryan Phillippe, last seen clubbing in "54."  
Although Keenan "doesn't date," they wind up at a midnight screening of 
"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and that alone is almost reason enough to 
recommend "Playing by Heart."</P>
<P>After 40 years of marriage, Hannah (played by Gena Rowlands) discovers 
her husband Paul (Sean Connery) with a souvenir of a 25-year-old love 
affair.  These veteran performers are typically solid, but it's a pity 
they're given some of the film's weakest lines.</P>
<P>And then there's Meredith (Gillian Anderson of "The X-Files") and Trent 
(Jon Stewart).  A divorced theater director, Meredith is better at 
orchestrating other people's lives than she is her own.  Divorced 
himself, Trent simply wants to buy her dinner, but Meredith deplores the 
"contrived artificiality" of the dating scene.  Unfortunately Anderson's 
strongest characteristic is an annoying forelock which she's constantly 
pushing out of her face.</P>
<P>Padding out the film (not that it needed any padding) are an adulterous 
couple played by Madeleine Stowe and "E.R."'s Anthony Edwards; a 
self-absorbed alcoholic (Dennis Quaid) who drifts from cocktail bar to 
cocktail bar; and a mother tending to her dying son (Ellen Burstyn and 
Jay Mohr).</P>
<P>Pets, martinis, and a common jargon help tie the knotty relationships 
together.</P>
<P>Strangely enough, Jolie and Phillippe fair far better than "Playing by 
Heart"'s more seasoned professionals.  Jolie oozes a brash confidence 
and Phillippe is every bit her match in a moodier, more introspective 
performance.  It's difficult to develop a relationship to a convincing 
"I love you" climax in under two hours, even in a VW bug in the rain, 
but it's a tribute to Jolie and Phillippe that when they share that 
conviction, you believe it.</P>
