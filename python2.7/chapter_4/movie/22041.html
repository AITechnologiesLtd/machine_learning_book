<P>   There's an old belief that to be a great artist, you have to
be neurotic, or psychotic, or drunk or drug-addicted.  Only
people who are aberrations, who are different in temperament
from the ordinary run-of-the-mill folks, can be truly creative. 
The brilliant guitar player who is the subject of Woody's
Allen's latest movie, Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), has us going
along with the adage--for a while.  He is so full of himself that
though he gives his all to the audience while on the stage, he
cannot relate to anyone on a human level.  Emmett is a
repressed personality who holds back his feelings so much
that he cannot stand being with one woman for too long,
however loving she may be, and he is so centered on himself
that he is not even aware of hurting the feelings of those he
is with when telling them about all the other women whose
company he has enjoyed.  Ah, but later we learn that when
he reaches an impasse in his life, when his oddities catch up
with him and make him realize how lonely he truly is, he is
ready to shuck off his ill-mannered narcissism: his music,
brilliant though it had been, undergoes a warmth, a depth, a
genuine improvement.  The moral?  If you want to attain
greatness, at the very least, be normal.</P>
<P>   Woody Allen has written and directed this film, a
considerable improvement over his last work, "Celebrity,"
which made the fatal mistake of casting Kenneth Branagh as
a stand-in for himself.  Branagh, the very antithesis of the
nebbishy Allen, embarrassed himself and his audience by
playing so far against type that he evoked snickers, not
laughter, from the audience.  This time Allen stays behind the
camera for the most part, appearing only now and then to
narrate some commentary about the musician whose life he
describes.  Woody Allen, who is said to be truly relaxed and
happy not when he is acting or directing but when he is
behind his clarinet on Mondays at New York's Michael's Pub,
is an aficionado of jazz--as shown in the recent documentary
about his concert tour of Europe, "Wild Man Blues."  "Sweet
and Lowdown" is his paean to swing, blues, and ragtime, a
mockumentary about a fictional character from the 1930s who
is the world's second-best guitarist.  </P>
<P>  As interpreted by the marvelous Sean Penn, one of the
major actors of his generation, Emmett Ray is booked into
the lounges of fancy hotels together with a small combo but
is often too drunk or too late to please an impatient audience-
-if he shows up all.  The self-destructive Emmett, who is
scarcely aware of his own loneliness, has two hobbies: one is
shooting rats in a vacant lot, the other is watching freight
trains go by--the latter perhaps an evocation of lost youth, the
former an expression of his frustration with isolation.  He has
plenty of women, but he feels nothing for them.  He forms a
relationship with Hattie (Samantha Morton), a most unusual
tie given that Hattie is mute.  She cannot speak and therefore
is an ideal foil for Emmett, giving him plenty of opportunity to
talk about himself and to allow us in the audience to get to
know him as much as we can.  Though much of the music in
the movie is a delight--we are treated to old faves like "Sweet
Georgia Brown," "All of Me," and "I'll See You in My
Dreams"--the best scenes are of Emmett with Hattie who,
lonely as her new man, follows him around and without a
word of dialogue expresses every possible nuance of feeling. 
We know when she is jealous of the attention that other
women are paying to Ray; we are aware of her utterly bleak
sadness when she is finally rejected by him.  When she
smiles she reminds us of Federico Fellini's beloved Giulietta
Massina, and does much to convince us of the 1930s setting
which Allen has consummately evoked.</P>
<P>   From time to time Nat Hentoff, Woody Allen, and other jazz
enthusiasts pop up on screen to do some talking-heads spiel
about this fictional Emmett Ray, and darned if they don't
convince us that this guitarist really existed.  Photographer
Zhao Fei's camera wanders about to take in the characters
who are part of Ray's life, including socialite Blanche (Uma
Thurman) who is a would-be writer intent on gaining access
to Ray's core and who somehow convinces him to marry her. 
Anthony LaPaglia turns out as a gangster-bodyguard to
whom Blanche is attracted and who leads the jealous
husband to track the two down to a roadside Mobilgas station
where the audience is treated to three potential versions of
the shootout that occurs there.</P>
<P>   Many are saying that the picture is "sweet but slight," but
such a mixed compliment does the film a disservice.  Allen
tells us quite a bit about what could well be the inner life of
many a self-centered artist and shows us just how much an
actress, the remarkable Samantha Morton, can do without a
word of dialogue.  No wonder the stars of the silents were
threatened by talkies!  Able to extract every emotion known
to humankind simply by facial expressions and body
language, they believed--accurately enough in so many
cases--that communicating by voice would take our attention
away from the more faithful renditions of sentiments.  "Sweet
and Lowdown" is sensitive, funny, melodious, and utterly
charming.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 105 minutes.  (C) 1999
