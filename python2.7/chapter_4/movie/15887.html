<PRE>                          SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: William Shakespeare writes "Romeo and
          Juliet" and at the same time discovers the woman
          who would be the love of his life.  This is a
          whimsical recreation of how things might have been.
          The story is charming and the setting is as
          interesting as the characters, though the
          credibility of what we see is compromised by
          obvious anachronisms and inaccuracies.  Rating: 8
          (0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 21 positive, 2 negative, 2 mixed</PRE>
<P>     It is 1593 and London has two competing theaters, each with a
favorite playwright.  The Curtain features the plays of Christopher
Marlowe, acknowledged to be the greatest playwright of the day.  The
Rose had a once promising young man who after about ten plays was
coming to the end of his creativity.  This is William Shakespeare
(Joseph Fiennes).  As we join the film Shakespeare's love life is in a
shambles as he is totally blocked from writing.  Not that it matters
because the theaters have been closed due to the plague. That may be
for the best as Shakespeare has promised his new play to both theaters.
That play, barely begun, being "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's
Daughter."</P>
<P>     Shakespeare cannot write, having had only the minimal experience
at love he got from a loveless marriage. But a woman is about to come
into his life.  Shakespeare sees Viola De Lesseps  (Gwyneth Paltrow)
and falls in love with her beauty.  Meanwhile it turns out that Viola
is a great fan of Shakespeare and the theater in general.  When the
theaters are reopened, due to only the most venal of reasons, Viola
gives in to temptation, defies the conventions of her time, disguises
herself as a man, and becomes an actor. Shakespeare finds the woman he
loves and begins an affair with her, ignoring the fact that she is
betrothed. When Viola auditions disguised as a man she is promptly cast
not as Juliet, but as Romeo in the play that seems to be written scene
by scene only one day, or often only hours, before it is rehearsed.
Shakespeare finds can write again now that he has something to write
about, his love of Viola, and his wild lovemaking during off moments of
the rehearsals.  The play Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter begins
to take shape and is transformed from the comedy everybody has been
expecting into the Romeo and Juliet we know.  Of course the creative
process is not without some help from Shakespeare's friends.  We see
Shakespeare's talent for pumping Christopher Marlowe and others for
ideas and character names.</P>
<P>     It should be noted that many of the fine details of this story are
carefully researched and there are references to real people and
events.  In fact, it is mainly the plot as a whole that is completely
absurd.  The story of Romeo and Juliet was popular long before
Shakespeare's time.  And it did not involve Ethel, the Pirate's
daughter.  Shakespeare's plays are almost exclusively adaptations of
pre-existing tales.  Scholars tell us that "The Tempest" was
Shakespeare's only original story.  (I am not sure how much
consideration they have given to "The Merry Wives of Windsor,"
essentially a sitcom written solely to reuse the popular character
Falstaff.)  This story of how Shakespeare's version of Romeo and Juliet
came to be written is obviously a complete fiction.  Unfortunately,
this means that any facts that one does glean about the period or about
Shakespeare from this film should be regarded as being highly suspect.
John Webster, seen here as a boy with rather gruesome tastes in drama,
is probably the playwright who went on to write plays like "The Duchess
of Malfi."  I do not know if there is any evidence that he knew
Shakespeare.  There clearly are Flintstone-esque anachronisms in the
play like the odd proto-psychiatrist that Shakespeare sees.</P>
<P>     The screenplay for SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is by Marc Norman and Tom
Stoppard.  Much of the screenplay shows Stoppard's sense of humor as
shown in other Stoppard plays like "Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern are
Dead."  The writers even have the audacity to write a little of its own
Shakespearean prose and wordplay.</P>
<P>     Fiennes and Paltrow are supported by a prestige cast including
Geoffrey Rush of SHINE, Ben Affleck of GOOD WILL HUNTING, Judi Dench of
MRS. BROWN (who is also the new M in the James Bond series), Colin
Firth of THE ENGLISH PATIENT, Simon Callow of FOUR WEDDINGS AND A
FUNERAL, Jim Carter of RICHARD III, and Tom Wilkinson of THE FULL
MONTY.  Director John Madden is the veteran of MRS. BROWN and episodes
of the BBC adaptations of SHERLOCK HOLMES (with Jeremy Brett as
Holmes).</P>
<P>     SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is a frothy and fun look at the bard and his
times, but is not to be taken too seriously.  One does not have to be a
fan of Shakespeare to enjoy it, but bardophiles will get more out of
it. It gets 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
