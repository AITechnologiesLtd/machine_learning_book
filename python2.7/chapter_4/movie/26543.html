<P>_Requiem_for_a_Dream_ **** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Darren Aronofsky's _Requiem_for_a_Dream_ is less a film than a journey,
a torturously exhausting one at that--and in this case, that's the
highest compliment that can be paid.  In his visionary adaptation of
Hubert Selby, Jr.'s novel, Aronofsky doesn't merely make one bear witness
to four characters' harrowing descents into drug addiction; he forces one
to experience their euphoric highs and, above else, their shattering
lows.  This is, as Aronofsky himself calls it, a horror film--one that
not only shocks, but scars.</P>
<P>Set in New York, _Requiem_ follows two parallel storylines whose
foundations are different but ultimately become more or less the same. 
One follows a trio of young people: Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his
girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), and his best friend Tyrone
(Marlon Wayans).  Marion's goal in life is to become a fashion designer,
and in order to finance the opening of a boutique, Harry and Tyrone
become drug dealers--which intensifies their already strong habit. 
Meanwhile, Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn), after receiving a notice
that she could appear on a TV game show, goes to dangerous lengths to
lose weight, namely a steadily increasing intake of diet pills.</P>
<P>The narrative line is obvious as the film passes through the seasons: a
sunny summer, an aptly named fall, and an even bleaker winter.  But this
isn't a film about the story so much it is about feeling.  Aronofsky
proved he can effectively unsettle viewers with his award-winning debut
_pi_, and he takes his ability to the next level in _Requiem_.  Much has
been made about the vast number of cuts in the film, but these are no
superficial exercises in style; they immerse the viewer in the
perspective and mindset of the characters.  The hyperactive early stages
of their addictions are especially captured well, and a split screen
device that could've come off as overkill reinforces the subjective point
of the view of the film.  The sensory barrage also slyly sidesteps the
explicit while ironically intensifying the feeling.  For all the shooting
up, snorting, and pill popping that occurs in the film, rarely are the
acts ever graphically shown; Aronofsky instead employs the same quick-cut
montages of heroin being cooked, straws taking in lines of coke, pill
bottles being opened, and pupils dilating.  Jarring and visually exciting
at first, these images become rather boring through their incessant
repetition--much like how the initial euphoria of drug use evolves into
mundane routine.</P>
<P>When I say _Requiem_ is about feeling, it should be noted that I mean
that in terms of sensation and not emotion.  The only character with much
depth is that of the lonely Sara (superbly played by Burstyn), and even
so she's still kept at the same arm's length emotionally as are the other
three.  This initially struck me as a flaw (especially in terms of the
Harry/Marion romance), but it reflects the greater ideas that Aronofsky
is trying to evoke.  The film being told from the point of view of the
addicts, the detachment is all but appropriate since they're not really
concerned about others or even themselves, just the fix.  Additionally,
the distance also reflects the way outsiders generally look at drug
addicts--as in, they don't, choosing to safely turn a blind eye. 
_Requiem_ doesn't give the audience the option of complacency; as its
last 30 minutes brutally detail everyone's raw ruin, the film seems to
dare the viewers to look away.  And it's a testament to Aronofsky that as
difficult as it is, it is impossible not to watch.</P>
<P>There may not be a profound emotional connection to any of these
characters, but the actors make them into convincing human beings, the
destruction of whose lives we witness before our eyes.  The resulting
feeling with which one walks away from _Requiem_for_a_Dream_ is not
sadness, but a heavier, emptier sense of loss--one that's even harder to
shake.</P>
