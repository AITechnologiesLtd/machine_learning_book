<PRE>                             HERCULES</PRE>
<P>HERCULES may bear little more resemblance than the name of the
Greek hero we read about in school but it nevertheless is the
recounting of a heroic effort.   And it tells the young who will
love the film that you do not call someone a hero because he can
perform feats of strength; true heroism, Father Zeus tells son
Hercules, involves feats of the heart. That message is delivered in
this palatable animation that involves humor mixed with some
irreverence.</P>
<P>The film opens with a Greek chorus (the Muses) relating the latest
on the celebration of the birth of Hercules on Mt. Olympus where
the Greek gods live.   Zeus, a proud daddy, gives his son a winged
horse named Pegasus as both he and his wife Hera beam at their
infant son and Pegasus cuddling.</P>
<P>With the appearance of Hades we are made aware that there is a
plot afoot to have the Lord of the Underworld, usurp the throne
from Zeus.   The Fates told Hades that in 18 years, when the
planets align, it will be the most propitious time to take over.
However, they warn him, that unless Hercules is in some way out of
the picture, Hades' attempt will not succeed.  Aided by his two
dimwitted monsters, Pain and Panic, Hades has baby Hercules
kidnapped.   A drug deprives him of his godliness, turning him into
a mere mortal, but the monsters fail to deprive him of his
super-human strength.</P>
<P>Something tells our hero that he is "different."  Determined to
find out why he feels that way, he goes to a statue of Zeus who
suddenly comes to life,  and now father and son are at last
re-united.  It is then that Zeus tells his young son he can only
return as a god to Mt. Olympus if he does something heroic on
Earth.   He also advises him to get help from the legendary
hero-trainer, Philoctetes, affectionately known as "Phil."   This
is one of the highlights of the film with the animation of Phil
looking exactly like Danny DeVito, the distinctive voice of Phil
and the source of much of the film's humor.  Great casting.</P>
<P>Before Hercules attains true hero status, he meets Megara, a
sultry Greek beauty who works for Hades.  Before "Meg" can do
Hercules any harm as per her boss' bidding she realizes she has
fallen in love with our hero.</P>
<P>Voices of the many wonderful animated characers are supplied by
Tate Donovan as the adult Hercules; Phil's voice is that of Danny
DeVito, Hades voice is that of James Wood.  Meg, the seductress,
uses the voice of Susan Egan.  Zeus and wife Hera are given voices
by Rip Torn and Samantha Eggar. Pain and Panic are Bobcat
Goldthwait and Matt Frewer.  Voice of the Cyclops is supplied by
Patrick Pinney;  Hal Holbrook lends his voice to Amphitryon with
Alcmene being Barbara Barrie's voice. Hydra, the octopus-like
demon is given voice by Oskar Urretabizkaia.</P>
<P>Songs are by Alan Menken with lyrics by David Zippel.  Music is
fine and the lyrics are witty but I still yearn for something
comparable to the songs we used to sing and hum long after we had
left the theater: Give me a "Hi Ho, Hi Ho, It's off to work we go
. . ."</P>
