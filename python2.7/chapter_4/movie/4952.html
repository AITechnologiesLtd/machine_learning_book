<P>Do you remember "Pinky" (1949) or the 1934 and 1959 "Imitation
of Life," both filmizations of a Fannie Hurst novel? Do you
remember what dramas or tragedies resulted in those movies
where a black girl passed for white?</P>
<P>We've come a long way since, but not all the way, as "A Family
Thing" shows. The film' s acting is unarguably superb. The
story is gripping. The direction is warm without corniness,
serious without preachiness, theatricality or sensationalism.</P>
<P>Earl Pilcher, Jr. (Robert Duvall) has a small business in his
rural Arkansas town. From our brief initial look, the place,
though not romanticized, feels like one that must be good to
live in, at least if you're white.</P>
<P>Earl's old mother dies, in an unusually realistic scene. A
couple of days later Earl is handed a posthumous letter, in
which Mrs. Pilcher reveals a big secret. Back in the early
Thirties, she was the friend--but only inside the house--of
her black domestic help. Young Willa Mae, who already had a
son, one day turned out to be pregnant by Mr. Pilcher. She
died giving birth to a very Caucasian-looking boy whom the
Pilchers passed as their biological child Earl,Jr.</P>
<P>Now over 60, with a wife, two grownup children, a father whom
he employs and treats lovingly, and an essentially
uncomplicated life, Earl is stunned. How will this man's heart
and mind deal with the revelation?</P>
<P>In her letter, the defunct lady urges him to get to know the
black half-brother he never knew he had. The reeling Earl 
confronts now penitent Earl,Sr. in a scene made all the more
effective by its avoidance of high-voltage dramatics. Later,
in a fine-tuned cut, sleepless Earl goes from his bed to his
shop's trash can to retrieve the crumpled letter.</P>
<P>With few clues, he abruptly takes off for Chicago in his
pickup truck to track down his brother Ray (James Earl Jones),
a cop, and succeeds. Following an awkward and far from
kiss-kiss reunion (Earl was no surprise to Ray), Earl starts
back for Arkansas. But after a bloody mugging and the theft of
his truck, he lands in a Chicago emergency ward. </P>
<P>In a plausible development the hospital people contact Ray, 
deliver the wounded man to the policeman who most reluctantly
accepts to look after him for one day. He takes him to his
home ("we have a niggertown in the North too"), in which are
crowded widower Ray's son Virgil (Michael Beach) a city bus 
driver, and Willa Mae's sister, the now blind Aunt T.(Irma P.
Hall).</P>
<P>Ray and Virgil don't exactly warm up to Earl, but Aunt T.
does. She is an authentic character, as sharp as a samurai's
blade. She cannot see skin color and diferences, dispenses
matriarchal authority and wise comments that are deciding
factors for future relations.</P>
<P>Expectedly yet fascinatingly, events change the brothers'
initial antagonism gradually change to rapprochement and to
Earl's tentative understanding of "the others." It's done
without the expected cliche's, sentimental drivel or
cookie-cutter progressions. Instead we get an intelligent,
sensitive, believable approach. </P>
<P>Less believable is how the senior Pilcher couple managed to
present baby Earl as their own to their small community. But
then, I was so engrossed by the film that I may have missed
something. I still wonder, though.</P>
<P>There's also the matter of  Earl's "whiteness," especially
when you think of Duvall in palefaced roles like Tom, the
Irish-American  Consigliere to the "Godfather"'s Corleone
clan. Then again, a geneticist would say that the unusual is
not the impossible.</P>
<P>The acting by the Duvall-Jones-Hall trio is right on the
button and most moving. Little-familiar Hall is a revelation.
The amazing variety of convincing roles Duvall and Jones have
held is too rich to list. Let cinephiles check their files.</P>
<P>Here, while ever consistent with their personalities, the
three lead portrayals are never obvious, yet they cover a
large spectrum of emotions and reactions. A homily delivered
by Earl to chip-on-his-shoulder Virgil might have been
sententious. It is affecting instead. Secondary characters are
drawn with deft economy.</P>
<P>The credit to the performers ought not to obscure the
contribution of the scriptwriter team (their 1962 "One False
Move" was excellent) or of director Richard Pearce</P>
<P>Pearce, a cinematographer in major movies ("Woodstock," "
Hearts and Minds," etc.), debuted in direction with the
marvelous "Heartland." He went on to make, among others, such
unusually good films as "Threshold," "Country," (with Jessica
Lange), or the little-seen "The Long Walk Home," (Whoopi
Goldberg and Sissy Spacek).</P>
<P>He brings to his work his camera experience, an eye for sets
and textures and a first-rate selection of scenarios. Above
all, this educated Californian (English at Yale, Political
Econmics at the New School for Social Research), has genuine
perceptions, sympathy and empathy for his subjects.</P>
<P>"A Family Thing" is beautifully detailed, pulls no punches,
doesn't impose political correctness. Chicago blacks are
Earl's hijackers and muggers. Later, others try the same stunt
on Ray, in a delicious scene reminiscent of "Lethal Weapon."
(The movie is not without humor that comes naturally).</P>
<P>In the black area, Earl witnesses affluence and misery as he
attempts drunkenly to begin coming to terms with his
negritude. Ray's apartment is so tight that surly Virgil,
resenting Earl being given "my couch," has to sleep inside the
bathtub. Yet Ray drives a shiny late-model car, which makes
the home situation less a comment on income than on housing
and ghettoizing.</P>
<P>Virgil has two cute daughters whom he loves, but these live
with their mother. In a structure of discreet yet telling
parallels, a train passes by Earl's Arkansas house and an El
by Ray's. Not too incidentally either, we get a depressing
view of big city hospital overcrowding.</P>
<P>There's no true closure to this film. It is after the brothers
visit their mother's grave and the movie ends that the really
hard part for Earl will come. In Chicago, he was in a foreign
culture. Adapting was relatively easy. In Arkansas he'll have
to deal with family and friends within their (and his) own
rural culture. Who knows what will develop. Perhaps a sequel?</P>
<P>The movie is easily as touching as "Mr. Holland's Opus."
Neither feelgood nor uplifting, it is stirring and
thought-provoking. All this without your ever looking at your
watch while the film is running.</P>
