<P>At the tender age of eight, my mother took me to see "The Amityville Horror" 
in a movie theatre. I remember being exceptionally scared by it, and recall 
quite vividly some of the movie's scary and eerie moments like the black 
liquid oozing from a toilet; the pig with the red eyes; the Red Room scene, 
and so on. I had not seen the film since 1979 until recently on DVD. Well, 
looking at the film now more objectively than when I was eight, I have 
concluded that "The Amityville Horror" is only occasionally effective but it 
also mostly silly, dull, and frightfully cold and emotionless. </P>
<P>The story, based on a now debunked "true story" novel by Jay Anson, centers 
on the Lutzes, a couple who move in to the dreaded Long Island house with 
their three kids. The house is sold cheaply, mainly because a killing spree 
took place a few years earlier involving the DeFeo family - they were killed 
by their teenage son with a shotgun. I would never move into a house where 
murders had taken place - nowadays, such houses are usually boarded up though 
not always. Anyway, the Lutzes love the house and buy it. George Lutz (James 
Brolin) begins to feel the curious need of chopping wood for the fireplace 
through most of the film. The wife feels neglected, especially since he won't 
help with carrying the groceries. The daughter starts talking to her new 
friend, Jody, who is invisible, and has a habit of locking her babysitter in 
the closet. A frantic psychotherapist/priest/exorcist (Rod Steiger) comes to 
bless the house one day until he is chased out by flies and a voice saying, 
"Get Out!" A nun comes to the hous
e and feels so sick upon entering that she vomits on the Lutzes's driveway. 
Either the house smells and needs to be fumigated or it is haunted. </P>
<P>"The Amityville Horror" is chock full of "shock" moments, and some of them 
are effective (the babysitter pounding on the closet door with her bloodied 
hands is disturbing). The film, however, has no momentum. It sort of labors 
along at a snail pace pausing occasionally for some weird occurrences and 
rappings in the house (my favorite being the case of the missing 1500 
dollars). The main flaw is that the Lutzes are presented as less a family 
than some annoying neighbors I could hardly care about - no attempt to 
develop sympathy for them has been made. Mr. Brolin comes off as demented a 
madman within the first few minutes as Jack Nicholson did in "The Shining." 
Margot Kidder, a reliable actress of dignity, comes off best but not enough 
to save the film. Steiger overacts shamefully, supposedly trying to match the 
towering performance of Max Von Sydow in "The Exorcist." As the realtor 
should have said at the beginning of the film: No sale.</P>
<P>P.S. The Oscar-nominated musical score by Lalo Schifrin was originally 
composed for "The Exorcist" but it was rejected by director William Friedkin. </P>
