<PRE>DANGEROUS MINDS</PRE>
<PRE>(Hollywood)

                Homework" by LouAnne Johnson

                Robin Bartlett

Running Time    99 minutes
Reviewed at     General Cinemas at Pleasant Valley, Raleigh (15AUG95)</PRE>
<P>DANGEROUS MINDS boasts a winning performance from Michelle Pfeiffer and
that's about it.  She's a marvel as real-life teacher LouAnne Johnson, an
ex-Marine whose innovative teaching techniques help her in "combat" against
a distracted, disillusioned inner-city "audience."  She captures their
attention by demonstrating karate, handing out candy bars, and, in the
farthest leap from reality, getting them interested in reading by reciting
the lyrics to "Mr. Tambourine Man."  [ Insert sound clip of William Shatner
singing same. ]</P>
<P>In *this* version of LouAnne's story-- which is believable for all five
minutes-- the students can read *and* write, presumably because they're
rarely distracted by sex, drugs, or rounds of ammo.  Another stretch is
Pfeiffer's character, who apparently has no life outside of the classroom.
(A subplot with Andy Garcia as the boyfriend was cut.  He probably kept
blushing at her accent.)  She spends all of her time with her students, the
only students in the only period that we see her teaching.  Talk about
dedication!</P>
<P>The loss, here, is that DANGEROUS MINDS never goes far *enough* away from
reality to make a difference.  The soundtrack is juiced, but not the story.
It's neither real enough, nor *unreal* enough to be interesting.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
<PRE>THE CRUDE OASIS</PRE>
<P>Though it's already left Triangle theaters, Alex Graves' remarkable debut is
certainly worth a look-see if and when it arrives on video.  The story--
which plays like an inverted BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY-- centers on a
depressed Kansas housewife (Jennifer Taylor) who, literally, meets the man
of her dreams (Aaron Shields).</P>
<P>Shot for 14 days on mere $25K, this OASIS is hardly crude.  Sure, the
production values are modest, no duh, but Graves' writing and direction are
both dead-on.  Even blown up from 16mm, there's more dramatic potency here
than almost all of the summer stock combined.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
<PRE>WIGSTOCK: THE MOVIE</PRE>
<P>The subject of cross-dressing has already, ah, come out of the closet in
recent films ranging from MRS. DOUBTFIRE to PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.
The novelty of men-as-women has passed, making a full-length documentary on
the subject -- in the context of New York's annual drag festival -- seem
like too little, too late.</P>
<P>Despite an endless array of towering wigs and colorful costumes, WIGSTOCK is
a shrill, unfocused film with no real momentum behind it.  There's virtually
no story to hold the raw footage together.  In terms of sheer spectacle,
it's amusing enough; but it's camp without a sense of time, place, or
purpose.  Who are these characters?  What is this event??  The film never
tells.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  What a drag.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C-</PRE>
