<PRE>My Dog Skip (1999, PG)</PRE>
<P>        The wise man once said "You can't run through the gauntlet of PACs
without getting somebody on their high horse."  Political Action
Committees -- groups that watch Hollywood second only to watching
Washington -- are so numerous in this jolly land of political
correctness in which we all reside, that nobody ever makes anything
without annoying some PAC.  It is like the Strait of Messia of
politics... sail your ship there, and without the guidance of a goddess,
your Argonauts shall fall into Poseidon's watery deep.</P>
<P>        Nobody survives the gauntlet... no one, that is, except for the
filmmakers of My Dog Skip.</P>
<P>        My Dog Skip is your standard kiddy fare -- trite message, half-decent
acting, something dealing with an animal thrown in, and messages that
hit you like the ten ton anvil falling on a Loony Toons character --
with one massive distinction... My Dog Skip prompts no political
reaction at all.  Try as you might, no PAC can find fault with the film.</P>
<P>        Although standard family values and conservative viewpoints are lauded
throughout My Dog Skip's utterly wholesome, WWII setting, no knee-jerk
liberal reactions are possible.  The SPCA will be utterly pleased that
all animal violence is both off screen and admitted as a terrible
thing.  The NAACP will be pleased that a civil rights subplot was thrown
in.  Women's Rights groups will be pleased that, although the father is
described as "overbearing" the mother still ends up being the one who
does the plumbing while the father cooks the meals.  And, in the brief
moment that hunters are featured, they get to bring down their game and
be characterized as villains at the same time.</P>
<PRE>        I don't even think that the main character's family ever eats red meat.</PRE>
<P>        That being said, My Dog Skip still manages to pull a few family-related
heartstrings.  The film is a collection of a few positive life-lesson
subplots (kid gets dog, kid gets friends, kid gets girlfriends), each of
which are so kitschy that (combined with Harry Connick Jr.'s soft
narration) they manage to pull the emotional purse strings enough to get
little kids misty-eyed, and the adults get misty-eyed out of sympathy.</P>
<P>        Yet My Dog Skip, in its attempt to run the PAC gauntlet and please its
target audience at the same time, ends up being a totally forgettable
cinematic effort.  The characters' names slip into the data stream of
memory so quickly that they are revealed as nothing more than archetypes
as you recollect the film (he was the kid, he was the dad, it was the
dog).  The events of the movie take a little longer to leave you, but
they won't clutter it up for too long.</P>
