<PRE>THE ROAD TO EL DORADO
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline, as the voices of two sixteenth-century
conmen from Spain, are the comics around whom DreamWorks's animated
movie, THE ROAD TO EL DORADO, is built.  Upon the shoulders of these
wise-cracking characters, who are in just about every scene, rest the
success or failure of the movie.  Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio's script
for them, however, is several gold nuggets shy of a treasure.</P>
<P>Miguel (Branagh) and Tulio (Kline) find themselves adrift in the
Atlantic Ocean.  In a small rowboat with few provisions and with a
friendly horse that has the appetite of, well, a horse, Miguel and Tulio
have nothing to be thankful for, save their map to El Dorado, the
legendary city of gold.</P>
<P>Luckily, their boat strikes land near the entrance to El Dorado.  Once
inside the famous city, they are welcomed into a colorful kingdom that
looks like a new Disneyland attraction -- sorry, DreamWorks.  Besides
featuring lots of gold, it also has bickering native leaders -- a rotund
chief (Edward James Olmos) and a garishly made-up high priest named
Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante).</P>
<P>Following the tradition of such encounters with natives, the story has
the Spanish swindlers being mistaken for gods by the locals.  ("It's an
entire city of suckers," proclaims a jubilant Tulio.)  A scantly-clad El
Dorado citizen named Chel (Rosie Perez) sees through the men from the
beginning and demands to join them in their scam, as they try to grab
the gold and get out of town.</P>
<P>For reasons which aren't clear, directors Bibo Bergeron and Will Finn
are never able to make effective use of their expensive voice talent.
Only Perez's spunky voice is recognizable.  The rest sound blandly
homogeneous like interchangeable radio newscasters.</P>
<P>The lively music for the picture features 6 original songs sung by Elton
John.  The movie's music and visuals easily surpass the story itself,
which only works in fits and spurts.  One good joke is followed by a
half-dozen ones that aren't.  The result is a movie that's kind of cute
but rarely anything more.</P>
<P>THE ROAD TO EL DORADO runs just 1:22.  The film is rated PG for mild
thematic material, brief male nudity and language and would be fine for
most kids of any age.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 10, gave the picture ***, but he complained that the
ending was too abrupt.  His buddies, Nickolas and Alan, both 10, gave
the picture *** 1/2.  All of the boys said that they thought the story
was really funny and that their favorite characters were the horse and
the monster.</P>
