<P>"The Dead Zone" is an interesting film in David Cronenberg's career
because it seems to have opened up a new avenue for him in his
work. With this adaptation of Stephen King's best novel, he invented a
new genre, which I can only describe as Romantic Tragic Horror. Other
film makers have dabbled in this - Roeg's "Don't Look Now" and
DePalma's "Carrie" are similar - but Cronenberg developed it in a
trilogy of films which become increasingly emotional in their
impact. "The Fly" is perhaps the first gore-film which is primarily a
love story, and "Dead Ringers" achieves an emotional wipe-out that is
only matched in recent years by Lars Von Trier's "Breaking the Waves".</P>
<P>At the centre of "The Dead Zone" is the question of what you would do
if you lost five years of your life. In the case of Johnny Smith,
played to perfection by Christopher Walken, he wakes up to find his
life has disintegrated, and in trying to build a new one he is
constantly hindered by a "second sight" that seems to be connected to
his coma. There is a big ellipsis here, because the audience is never
told precisely how and why this power developed. Fortunately, Walken
is convincing enough to get around this, and we come to accept it as
part of his illness, much as we come to accept Marilyn Chambers'
phallic appendage in "Rabid", or Samantha Eggar's children of rage in
"The Brood".</P>
<P>Christopher Walken has always had a slightly distracted quality that
serves him well in this role.  It also allows him to underplay some
incredibly emotional moments, which ironically heightens their
impact. Time and again, Cronenberg pulls off scenes that in other
hands would have become grossly sentimental. He seems to have enjoyed
having a hero who is uncompromisingly good - it's a big development
from "Scanners" where the good-evil conflict was fatally weakened by
the awful performance of Stephen Lack. Perhaps Cronenberg had simply
got better with actors - there are no bad performances in this film,
and actors like Herbert Lom and Anthony Zerbe, both prone to hamming
it up, are restrained and very effective.</P>
<P>The love story in the film is effectively played down, with a
beautiful "if only" scene when Brooke Adams comes to visit Johnny
after he learns to walk again. There are no big confrontation scenes
between Adams and Walken, just quiet resignation and sadness; the
final scene with Adams holding Walken's dead body is very touching,
again because it is underplayed, and speaks for itself. In "The Fly",
the romance would be put at the heart of the film, and there are big
emotional scenes that work very well, but there's nothing as poignant
as the scene before the crash, when Johnny refuses to stay the night.</P>
<P>The film tends to be rather episodic, as is the book, and after the
crash and the recovery, it focuses on the hunt for the Castle Rock
killer. Again, Cronenberg gets his points across with a subtlety that
other directors could learn from. We see a murder in brief, simple
details; the blow to the head, the undressing and the scissors coming
down. Quick and shocking, it's a great bit of film-making, as is the
later suicide of the killer. The actual death is, again, not shown,
but we see the horrific aftermath, in the only gratuitous gore in the
whole film. The suicide is almost like Cronenberg apologising to his
fans, and offering them some gory stuff, albeit very briefly.</P>
<P>Virtually all of the film is seen from the perspective of Johnny
Smith, which is very effective.  There is then a bizarre, and
completely unnecessary, cutaway to a scene where the crooked
politician, Greg Stillson, is blackmailing a newspaper editor. It gets
a point across about Stillson's corrupt ways, but we already knew
about that from a conversation between Walken and Anthony Zerbe. It
would have been better for Johnny to have had a flash of this
blackmailing, perhaps after touching the badge that he's given by
Stillson at Zerbe's house. As it is, it disrupts the flow of the
second half of the film. Two things hold it together; the force of
Walken's performance, and the great caricature of a corrupt politico
by Martin Sheen. Sheen manages to make us understand why Stillson is
so popular, and why he's so dangerous.</P>
<P>By the end of the film, Johnny has died heroically, and has found a
reason for his "gift", which he decides is not a curse but a
blessing. Except, of course, that it has led him to his inevitable
death with the inexorable force of a classic tragedy. In a way,
though, Johnny has been dead ever since the night of the crash, and he
seems to welcome death as a release from the burden of knowledge and
responsibility.</P>
<P>I think this is a very good film, although at the time, it seemed a
real disappointment. After the glory of "Videodrome" and its
extraordinary images and ideas, I thought Cronenberg had sold out by
filming a King story. This was at the time when everyone and his wife
was making films based on Stephen King's stories. The worst, by a long
chalk, was "Firestarter", but I think "The Dead Zone" has turned out
to be the best of that cycle.  It doesn't stick rigidly to King's
story, but it respects it and turns it into something very
moving. Looking at the film with the benefit of hindsight, it seems
clear that this was the film in which Cronenberg began reaching for
something that would later serve him well. I think he wanted to be
more than just a clever director with a talent for icky special
effects. In "The Dead Zone" he goes all out for emotion, and he
succeeds pretty well. This success was built upon by "The Fly", where
all the gore couldn't disguise that he was making his own "Love
Story", and ultimately by "Dead Ringers" where the gore was almost
non-existent and the focus was completely on the characters and the
impossibility of love ever working out the way it's meant to.</P>
