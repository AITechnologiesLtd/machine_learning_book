FULL MONTY, THE (director: Peter Cattaneo; screenwriter: Simon Beaufoy;

Schofield), Tom Wilkinson (Gerald Arthur Cooper), Mark Addy (Dave
Althorpe), Steve Huison (Lomper), Paul Barber (Barrington "Horse"

<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A "feel good" movie about unemployment in the steel-mill town of
Sheffield, England, and how these layed off workers overcome their
misfortunes and gain self-respect by using their will power to do
something that is out of character for them; that is, they become
strippers. Yes, they become male strippers...The story is predictable,
likable, and soapy. It leaves one all fuzzy and cuddly inside, as the
film uses risque material to make its point, yet it is almost totally
devoid of hot sex. It traps you in its formula mode; you can't help
wishing these blokes do well. They represent a universal paradigm: there
is the loner, the aging man representing the minorities, the prude who
is really a swell guy, the untalented but well-endowed fellow, the
insecure one who is also obese, and the regular "Joe" down on his luck.</P>
<P>Well, rest assured, things turn out well, they all have a good sport
with their one night of a full monty (which is a total strip) in front
of a ladies only audience.</P>
<P>The film's popularity does not surprise me, people seem to like quick
solutions to their problems and films where thinking is not a
prerequisite for enjoying it. I have a feeling that this film will age
poorly, and like a lot of trendy films, will not look good a few years
from now. I thought it offered just so-so entertainment value. It never
gave me the impression that I was seeing something that mattered. The
full monty as promised, was not even delivered.</P>
