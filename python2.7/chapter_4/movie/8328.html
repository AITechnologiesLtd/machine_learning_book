                                MEN IN BLACK
                          A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1997) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Last year at this time, the number-one box office attraction 
was INDEPENDENCE DAY, featuring a wise-cracking Will Smith 
battling aliens. This year at this time, the number-one box office 
attraction is MEN IN BLACK, featuring a wise-cracking Will Smith 
battling aliens. History repeats itself. I repeat myself. Both movies 
are effects-driven action romps that play much better in a packed 
multiplex on a huge screen. The flaws, I'm sure, shine through a lot 
brighter if you're home by yourself watching it on your 13" Sony.</P>
<P>        The plot of MEN IN BLACK is simplified to an almost 
Corky-like point -- funded by but independent from the U.S. 
government is a super-secret organization that tracks and controls 
extra-terrestrial activity. A group of Armani-suit-clad men in black 
carry out the peaceful and violent tasks of the organization, although 
for plot purposes, we only see the violent ones.</P>
<P>        Tommy Lee Jones, pretty much reprising his character in 
THE FUGITIVE, is the no-nonsense veteran of alien battle. Will 
Smith, absolutely reprising his ID4 character, is the young, cocksure 
cop recruited by Jones toward the beginning, after Jones sees him 
chase down an alien on foot. Smith doesn't know it's an alien, of 
course, and once he finds out his memory of it is erased by Jones 
with a gizmo that comes in handy for anyone with something to 
cover up. Clinton would never have been sued by Paula Jones if he 
had one.</P>
<P>        Smith and Jones are out to track down an insect alien 
inhabiting Vincent D'Onofrio's human body. The alien is after some 
diamonds that turn up on a dead alien body attended to by kinky 
morgue worker Linda Fiorentino. She's in the movie, as always, to 
add a little sex appeal, although her flirtatious scenes with Smith 
mostly fall flat. It's her unsurprising but still interesting turn as the 
film's third hero that elevates her from being just another movie 
sexpot.</P>
<P>        Rick Baker, hot off his plumper work in THE NUTTY 
PROFESSOR, does the alien effects here. A lot of them are 
standard-issue "creature" aliens, like the oversized beatle that serves 
as the movie's villain. There are weird-looking but harmless Cantina 
band types and a few nice touches, like the talking pug that steals a 
scene about halfway through the movie. The effects aren't 
groundbreaking, or really even that special, but they do help keep 
the movie entertaining.</P>
<P>        The best thing about MEN IN BLACK is the men in black -- 
Smith and Jones. They have so much fun with their roles that we 
have fun watching them. The movie also has enough constant 
one-liners that it seems more comedy at times than action, like a 
modern-day GHOSTBUSTERS. The downside to it all, and this is 
what separates it from the far-superior and far-funnier 
GHOSTBUSTERS, is it's incredibly low-brow. For every funny line 
there's a lame one, and the plot is transparent. If you have a brain, 
leave it at the door or under the seat, because it will only get in the 
way of your fun. If you don't have a brain, you can't read this 
anyway.</P>
