SPELLBOUND (1945)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>As I had said in one of my previous reviews, from time to
time I'm faced with interesting movie watching phenomenon,
quite opposite from "guilty pleasures". There are film
authors who are great and who are supposed to be worshipped,
but sometimes I just can't help it - I don't like their work
and later I feel guilty about it. The movies are technically
all right, they have all the necessary ingredients, but they
simply don't look the way a true masterpiece should. I often
encounter such phenomenon when I watch films by John Ford,
but there are other cases. Among those cases are also
classic thrillers by Alfred Hitchcock, the great master of
suspense. More often than not, those alleged masterpieces
failed to meet expectations created by the established
critics and film scholars. Of course, that doesn't mean that
they are bad or substandard; actually, many of them are very
good, but their flaws are often overlooked, mostly out of
irrational respect towards great Hitchcock. One of the
illustrations of such phenomenon is SPELLBOUND, his 1945
thriller, often hailed as the first major Hollywood film to
deal with psychoanalysis.</P>
<P>The plot of the film begins in Green Manors, psychiatric
institution dedicated to the treatment of mental disorders
via psychoanalysis. Among the staff is Dr. Constance
Petersen (played by Ingrid Bergman), beautiful but emotional
cold psychiatrist. Her barren love life is going to improve
thanks to Dr. Edwards (played by Gregory Peck), young
psychiatrist who is going to become new head of the
institution. Two of them fall madly in love with each other,
but Constance and her colleagues soon discover some oddities
in Dr. Edwards' behaviour. Constance confronts him and
discovers that her lover is actually impostor, mentally
disturbed amnesiac who used to be Dr. Edwards' patient and
later took his identity after being involved in some
mysterious and traumatic incident which, presumably, left
real Dr. Edwards dead. Against her better and professional
judgement, guided only by the feelings towards stranger who
has initials "J.B." as the only trace of identity, Constance
decides not to report him to police. Instead, she tries to
treat his condition by helping him to remember his true
identity and what really happened.</P>
<P>Hitchcock, sometimes accused of creating films solely around
single scene, had a very good script here, written by Ben
Hecht and based on the novel by Francis Beeding. The plot of
SPELLBOUND revolved about genuine and very intriguing crime
mystery, and its originality was due to the use of someone's
mental condition as the main element of the plot. Hitchcock
also used that mental condition in order to create some
really effective and suspenseful scenes. On the other hand,
scenes that were most remembered from this movie - dream
sequence by Salvador Dali and the showdown at the end - had
nothing to do with such mental condition. The bravery with
which Hitchcock had used psychoanalysis for the first time
in Hollywood was compromised with rather simplistic approach
towards such subject. According to Hitchcock, psychological
problems that require professional help could be cured
simply if person acknowledges their existence. Of course, we
know that this is not the case, and even Hitchcock in his
later films used much more complex approach when he dealt
with psychoanalysis.</P>
<P>The acting in this film is good. Ingrid Bergman is very
believable, both as emotionally detached professional and as
woman blinded by love. Unfortunately, her character is done
great disservice with the script that failed to properly
explain her transformation from former into latter;
Hitchcock as director didn't help either, since he didn't
make that change gradual. Also, many feminists would
probably be up in arms because this film implicitly treats
professional women as inherently unstable and therefore
inferior to their male colleagues. Gregory Peck as her
partner has somewhat better role that inspired many similar
characters in psychological thrillers - good looking guys
who hide sinister secrets behind their attractive surface.
But, those who played supporting roles did the most
impressive acting job in SPELLBOUND. Michael Checkov was
excellent as Dr. Brulov, old mentor and friend of Constance.
Leo G. Carroll was also very good as Dr. Murchison, and Bill
Goodwin had a brief but very good appearance as sympathetic
house detective.</P>
<P>All in all, SPELLBOUND is more than solid, although still
overrated psychological thriller. Its true importance lies
not in its quality, but in the roads Hitchcock paved for
future filmmakers in it.</P>
