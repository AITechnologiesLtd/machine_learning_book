<PRE>REVIEW: A Thousand Acres</PRE>
<PRE>By Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<PRE>1 and a half stars out of 5</PRE>

<P>I found it amazing - no, astonishing - that A Thousand Acres is amongst
fellow pulitzer-prize winning novels-turned-films as The Diary of Anne
Frank, Driving Miss Daisy, The Age of Innocence and To Kill a Mocking
Bird.  Somewhere along the line - and I suspect it's the conversion to
the big screen - Jane Smiley's tale of two sisters' traumatic family has
been drained of emotion, passion and heart.</P>
<P>Larry Cook (Jason Robards) owns 1,000 acres of fertile land in Iowa,
USA.  The farm, irrigated by his grandfather and father - and passed
down through the generations - has given him respect in the community
and a pessimistic attitude towards life and relationships.  Troubles
starts to brew when Larry, realizing that his days on Earth are
numbered, decides to divide his land between his three daughters - Ginny
(Jessica Lange), Rose (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Caroline (Jennifer Jason
Leigh).  Ginny and Rose are eager to inherit part of their family
heritage whilst Caroline remains uncertain as to the success of this
venture.</P>
<P>But when a closet of dark family secrets is opened, and memories of
tormented childhood's and chilling experiences are revealed, the three
daughters and their menacing father will take a turn for the worse.</P>
<P>For most of its hollow duration, A Thousand Acres ultimately angered me
for this simple reason: it is very easy for an average action flick to
be insulted for its obvious flaws, yet these sorts of family "tear
jerkers" often slip past criticism because they look so much classier
than they actually are.  Have a couple of high profile actors, a slimy
romantic plot/subplot and a tear shed here and there and what do you
have?  A potentially great film?  Perhaps.  A definite "good" film?  No
way.</P>
<P>There were many things that irritated me about A Thousand Acres.  To
start with, the relationship between Rose and Caroline - the films
central focus - never once convinced me.  As the unfortunate viewers, we
are expected to believe that these two women have a deep understanding
and love for each other - yet at one stage, one of them completely cuts
off all contact from the other - not speaking or writing for years.  But
of course, a couple of scenes later, they are together again with no
mention of what the hell happened to them previously.</P>
<P>A slab of utterly trashy scenes occur upon the introduction of "Jess
Clark (Colin Firth)", a character that this very 2D film attempts to
bring into another dimension of love, lust and greed.  Unfortunately,
any scenes that could have allowed us to have a greater understanding of
the characters needs have been completely avoided - it almost seems that
director Jocelyn Moorhouse has gone out of her way to create a set of
dull predicaments.  And it's those sorts of ludicrous thoughts which
plagued my mind from start to finish - making myself search for a reason
that would explain exactly how a pulitzer-prize winning novel could end
up so ordinary as a motion picture.</P>
<P>What saves A Thousand Acres from total failure is its adequate
performances from Pheipher and Lange (adequate, simply because the
dialogue would not allow an in depth understand of the characters) and a
music score that belongs on Easy Listening 3MP.</P>
<P>A thousand triumphs?  No - a thousand tears of boredom.</P>
