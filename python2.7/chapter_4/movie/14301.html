<PRE>I Know What You Did Last Summer
A Review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt; Sarah Michelle Gellar; Ryan Phillippe &
Freddie Prinze Jr.</P>
<P>I Know What You Did Last Summer comes from the same screenwriter who brought
us last year's Scream. Jennifer Love Hewitt; Sarah Michelle Gellar; Ryan
Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr. play two couples who are out celebrating
the Fourth of July, and the beauty pageant win of Helen Shivers (Gellar).
After a night of partying, they drive home along a deserted mountain road.
On the way down the road, they hit a man. They decide their only way out is
to dispose of the body. Although disposing of the body turns out to be more
difficult than they had expected. When it is accomplished they swear never
to speak of it again.</P>
<P>At the end of the summer they all go their separate ways Julie Janes
(Hewitt) is off to university and Helen is off to fame and fortune in New
York. Over the course of the next year the two couples break up and the four
friends loose touch with one another. That is, until Julie comes home from
her first year of university and finds a hand written note waiting for her,
stating simply -- I know what you did last summer. None of the four, whom
have all returned home, have any idea who wrote the letter. Quite quickly
all become convinced that they have a real problem.</P>
<P>The note's author goes about terrorizing the four, as well as leaving the
usual mounting body count in his/her wake. Like Scream, the writing is
sharp, and most of the plot twists work well. As with Scream, screenwriter
Kevin Williamson seems to be taking shots at the horror movie genre. With
blatant scenes like the female victim running up the stairs to get away from
the killer when she should be running out the door. This brings me to the
last 20 minutes of the movie.</P>
<P>The audience that I screened the movie with laughed at many of the so-called
scarier scenes at the end of the movie when the lead characters were in dire
peril. This isn't a knock against the movie by any means. Nor am I
suggesting that the movie is so bad that it is funny. The audience was
laughing with the movie, and not at it. One gets the impression that the
makers of I Know What You did Last Summer wanted the final 20 minutes of the
movie to be a very clever send-up of horror flicks. If that was their
intent, then they succeeded.</P>
<P>My only complaint with the movie was the killer. When the killer's identity
is finally revealed I was left asking -- huh? This could also be said
concerning many of my fellow audience members. You actually have to think
about it for a minute to figure it out, not normally a plus for a slasher
film. Which is not to say that you will leave the theater confused, just
having used your brain a little.</P>
<P>The four main cast members were excellent, and as for Hewitt and Gellar, if
their first major starring film roles are any indication, they should both
have bright careers on the big screen ahead of them. Especially Sarah
Michelle Gellar, who will appear in Scream 2 at the end of 1997.</P>
<PRE>Great flick  9/10</PRE>
