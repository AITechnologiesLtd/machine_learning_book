<P>Todd Haynes, acclaimed for his 1995 feature, "Safe," has pulled off quite 
a feat with "Velvet Goldmine." Incredibly, the writer-director manages to 
take the British glam-rock era, one of the most colorful, outrageous, 
fascinating periods in the history of contemporary music, and turn it 
into 120 minutes of unfocused, surrealistic crap. This overwrought 
mishmash of style without substance most closely resembles Ken Russell's 
film version of "Tommy," and it's just as annoying.</P>
<P>Essentially, "Velvet Goldmine" simply rips-off the story of David Bowie 
through his Ziggy Stardust days, with one crucial difference. Bowie was 
interesting and Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is not. Bowie's 
breakthrough came in the '70s, when he pushed the prevailing hippie 
mentality into a more theatrical, androgynous zone. He achieved notoriety 
in England by dressing in a frock and trumpeting his bisexuality. Global 
success came when he adopted the persona of Ziggy Stardust, an orange-
haired alien without eyebrows or defined gender, slinking about the stage 
in feathered boas, inventive make-up and bizarre clothing. With his out-
of-date slang and cheesy sci-fi imagery, Bowie seemed less like a genuine 
rock singer and more like an actor playing one, but damned if he wasn't 
fun to watch. And it was easy to overlook his mannered, occassionally 
wince-inducing lyrical affectations, because the man wrote absolutely 
terrific songs.</P>
<P>During the Ziggy days, Bowie hit the publicity circuit with his look-a-
like wife, Angela, even as rumors circulated about him being spotted in 
the sack with Mick Jagger. When Johnny Carson asked Angela if she was 
concerned about all the girls chasing her husband, she cooed "Oh no, 
darling, it's the boys I have to worry about." Shortly before ditching 
the Ziggy persona for a white-suited soul identity, Bowie told reporters 
of his belief that, sooner or later, a rock singer would be assassinated 
onstage.</P>
<P>Haynes takes it from there. In his story, Brian Slade fakes his own 
onstage death, but is exposed as a fraud and falls from grace with fans. 
Ten years later, melancholy journalist Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale) is 
assigned a "whatever happened to" story, and sets out to discover the 
final fate of Brian Slade. The "Citizen Kane" framework, while 
pretentious, provides the only successful facet of the production, with 
Bale offering a strong performance as a former glam fan whose painful 
memories of trying to make the glitter scene are stirred by the 
investigation.</P>
<P>With subject matter like this, Todd Haynes should have been able to turn 
out one hell of a juicy film, but "Velvet Goldmine" never takes flight. 
Instead of delving into the psyches of the characters, Haynes trots out a 
series of tedious rock videos, tacked together with preening actors, 
elaborate fashion shows and periodic make-out scenes between the boys. 
Having a bad actor in the lead role doesn't help matters. As Brian Slade, 
Jonathan Rhys Meyers is woefully inadequate, projecting zero charisma as 
he pouts his way through the movie. Never for a moment do you believe 
this kid could orchestrate his own superstardom.</P>
<P>Ewan McGregor is better as Curt Wild, an American rocker who is the 
object of Slade's affections. Wild is supposed to be modeled after 
legendary punk-burnout and Bowie protégé Iggy Pop, though McGregor's 
performance is more reminiscent of Kurt Cobain than Iggy. Incidentally, 
this is at least the third film featuring McGregor waggling his cock 
around, making him eligible for the Harvey Keitel Penis Exposure Hall Of 
Fame. </P>
<P>In a supporting role, Toni Collette does what she can as Mandy, Slade's 
wife. She makes little impression during the flashbacks, but has a 
certain Marianne Faithfull ravaged survivor quality in the latter-day 
interview scenes set in a dingy pub. As Brian Slade's manager, Eddie 
Izzard merely growls and struts. </P>
<P>"Velvet Goldmine" is maddening because it takes material with great 
potential and utterly wastes it. The glam rock era was a heady time, with 
its sexual experimentation, blurred gender lines, grandiose theatrics and 
knock-out music. Instead of probing the minds behind the phenomena, Todd 
Haynes settles for a gauzy surface glance; a tarted-up tribute without 
any oomph. "Velvet Goldmine" is to glam rock what the "Beatlemania" stage 
show was to the Beatles; just a bunch of poseurs going through the 
motions. David Bowie refused to let Haynes use his name or any of his 
music for the movie. Good for him. Hopefully, Bowie will wait until a 
filmmaker comes along with the chops to really do justice to the dizzying 
saga of Ziggy Stardust. </P>
