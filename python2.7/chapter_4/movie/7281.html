<PRE>                                  THE SAINT
                       A film review by David Landers
                        Copyright 1997 David Landers</PRE>
<P>RATING: *** out of **** - 7.5 out of 10.0
CAST: Val Kilmer (Simon Templar), Elisabeth Shue (Emma Russell), Rade
Serbedzija (Ivan Tretiak), Irina Apeximova (Frankie), Valeri Nikolayev
(Ilya), Lucija Serbedzija (Sofiya)
CERTIFICATION: PG-13 (USA) for violence, language, some sensuality, and
brief drug use</P>
<P>THE SAINT was actually a little better than I expected it to be, in some
ways.  In this theatrical remake of the television series THE SAINT, and
its series sequel THE RETURN OF THE SAINT, Val Kilmer plays Simon
Templar, an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from
others for others.  This movie closely resembles a James Bond flick.  It
has the classic Bond symbols: a man who can do just about anything and get
away with it, a woman whom the man persues, a villain out to achieve
something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal.  Kilmer
actually provides a rather good role in this movie, although at times you
are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations.</P>
<P>The movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by Catholic
priests.  As a young boy, Kilmer's character enjoyed magic and would often
journey away from his schoolwork.  That is until his school teacher finds
him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name, that
of a Catholic saint.  He refuses to do so and instead announces who he
wishes to be.  This leads to a devestating mistake, which is something
that will stay in his mind throughout his life.</P>
<P>Kilmer's first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from Ivan
Tretiak, played by Rade Serbedzija.  During a press conference, he must
make his way into a heavily guarded vault area, avoiding guards, cameras,
and many other potential obstacles.  Once his mission is completed and he
is safely home, the fee is paid.  When he logs into his bank account
and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million, he
decides to carry out only one more mission, then retire.</P>
<P>Dr. Emma Russell, portrayed by Elisabeth Shue, has discovered a way to
produce energy by way of cold fusion.  This new advancement would change
the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of Russia, where
millions are without heat and are freezing to death.  The only problem is,
Tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power
amongst the people.  This presents the option for Kilmer to achieve his
goal.  Tretiak hires him to steal the equations, small pieces of paper,
from Shue.</P>
<P>One of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that Kilmer
dawns to complete his missions.  They are very convincing, not only to the
characters in the movie, but to us.  Kilmer utilizes one such disguise to
lure Shue's character into getting to know him even more, which would
provide him a means of stealing the energy formula.  When the two meet,
and end up having a sensual experience, Kilmer's character is seemingly
falling in love with Emma Russell, as she is falling in love with Kilmer's
alter-ego, a traveling artist.  Yet, he must reach his goal of $50
million, which requires him to steal the energy formula, putting his
feelings aside.</P>
<P>Shue's character is eventually able to track down Simon Templar by putting
the pieces (the names of the Catholic saints) together, something no one
else is able to do.  When she finds him, they are left to team up and
reclaim the energy formulas from Tretiak.</P>
<P>THE SAINT is very action-packed, with few slow points.  The sound was very
well done and added to the many intense moments.  Along the course of the
movie, there are even a few, although brief moments of comedy.  These
moments are almost always thanks to Kilmer's extraneous, very convincing
disguises and personalities.  All in all, a rather enjoyable movie with
nearly non-stop action.</P>
