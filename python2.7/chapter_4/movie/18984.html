<P>With The Winslow Boy, his sixth film as writer-director, (and seventh as a
writer) David Mamet pulls a Cocteau.  Jean Cocteau (1889-1963) was a jack
of all artistic trades and master of most. He wrote novels, poetry, plays,
ballets, movie scripts; he drew, painted, sculpted, designed pottery,
stained-glass windows; he was an illustrator, a film director, an
occasional actor --but then  his whole life was a performance. It is all
summed up when, in the years preceding World War I, Sergei Diaghilev (the
famed founder and director of Ballets Russes), before Cocteau's desire to
create ballets, told the young man: "Jean, etonne-moi!" ("Surprise me!")</P>
<P>Mamet is not  a Cocteau-like "touche-a-tout"  but a protean
stage-and-screen creator--and full of surprises. His latest and most
radical twist  is to switch from his tough, rough,   vulgar, profane
American subjects and colloquialisms to a most un-Mametish direction and
writing of a British drama of genteel people, manners and speeches. He
succeeds perfectly.</P>
<P>The Winslow Boy is based on a true event in 1908  Edwardian England. George
Archer-Shee was the youngest child of a retired Liverpool bank manager.
George, then approaching fourteen, and a cadet at the Osbourne Naval
College, was expelled for (allegedly) cashing a five-shilling money order
that was not his. His father, convinced of the child's claims of innocence,
challenged the accusation. Not an easy thing to do since he was up against
the College and its parent, the Admiralty which were immune to lawsuits.</P>
<P>The Archer-Shee case quickly caught the imagination of the British public
and became a "cause celebre" which, in some ways, reminds me of the
notorious Dreyfus Affair (1894-1906) which rent France into two camps. The
British camps were, it would seem, far from the rabid or hot-under-the
collar split across the Channel, so that the Archer-Shee affair did not
become notorious and did not create a world-wide stir the way the Dreyfus
case did. Anti-Semitism, played a huge role across the Channel;
anti-Catholicism may have been a factor in the Archer-Shee turmoil. The
French Captain 's indictement was also the result of intense hatred between
liberals and what we would call the extreme right today. The storm around
the English boy looks like more of a matter of belief or disbelief that a
well brought-up subject of the King could stoop to such an un-Britannic
deed. In any case, in 1910, the boy George was exonerated.</P>
<P>The playwright Terrence Rattigan, already popular in England for his
"well-made" plays since the mid-1930s, had his greatest isuccess in  the
U.K and the U.S.A  right after World War II, when he adapted the
Archer-Shee case as the stage-play "The Winslow Boy" (1946). This then
became a very good  film, as did Rattigan's other best known plays, the
Browning Version  and Separate Tables.</P>
<P>"The Winslow Boy" moved its family from Liverpool to London, and the
time-frame from 1908-1910 to 1912-1914. Mamet's version retains all that,
plus very much of the source play, including a change in George's big
sister Kate, from a conservative woman in real life to a suffragette in the
play.</P>
<P>I will not sort out what is Rattigan's, Mamet's or Caesar's. The Mamet
version, as I remember the earlier ones, is both wonderfully faithful to
the originals and wonderfully original at the same time -- a neat trick and
quite an accomplishment. Nor will I detail the story except for
generalities, the first of which is, of course, that the characters show
almost painful British politeness, and sang-froid which hides deep
emotions.</P>
<P>The second is the matching soberness of the superb performers--I mean all
of them.  Nigel Hawthorne triumphs as Arthur Winslow, the father. He has a
rich background of which only the TV series Yes, Minister and The Madness
of King George are familiar to Americans. He never loses his dignity--nor
do the other Winslows-- but is never stuffy either.  Mr.Winslow (no one
could call him just Arthur), goes through agonies which include the melting
of his fortune, yet keeps an upper lip worthy of a nation of Empire
builders.</P>
<P>Rebecca Pidgeon (she is Mamet's wife and plays Catherine Winslow) is
captivating in her disciplined ways. She is particularly appealing when
Desmond Curry, the family solicitor, older, forever and silently in love
with her, produces a coup: he enlists the help of legal eagle barrister Sir
Robert Morton to represent the Winslow boy. Kate, though not a rabid
suffragette, is politically at the opposite pole of conservative Sir
Robert's. Her logical mistrust of him (unfounded in this case) runs
throughout much of the film, enriching her role and his. The barrister is a
cold character (or so it seems), seems almost brutal as he questions the
boy (but there's a catch to this), is a handsome aristocrat who, when the
air is cleared ought to make a perfect mate for Kate. But the movie does
not succumb to easy asides of romance.</P>
<P>The entire family behaves nobly but un-stiffly throughout the ordeal which
includes the necessity to dismiss servants, to cut down expenses, and to be
public figures. Again, none of this is stressed. Facile cliches (in other
hands) are absent. We do not get the standard view passersby pointing to
any one Winslow and whispering "that's the mother, that's the brother."</P>
<P>A point of historical interest I dug up. The real Sir Robert was Edward
Henry, Baron Carson of Duncairn, a major political figure in Ireland and
England where he was elected to the House of Commons and served as British
solicitor general (1900-1905). In 1895, as Queen's Counsel, he was the
cross-examiner at Oscar Wilde's trial for homosexuality, and was
instrumental in the conviction of the writer. That's a bit ironical, given
that in the Archer-Shee affair, Edward Carson went against the Admiralty,
and that for awhile (1916-17) he was First Lord of the Admiralty.</P>
<P>The movie is promising from its start, with plain, sober credits and
unobtrusive music. Its construction also shines by its apparent, classical
simplicity, something that (cf. Renoir, Ozu, Bresson) is far harder to
accomplish than riotous complexity.</P>
<P>Right away, an elegant, sensitive sense of cinema prevails. Within the
first fifteen minutes or less, the stage is intelligently set. It is an
exposition in the tradition of well-made plays, but then, it is a smooth,
un-abitrary class A exposition which does not hit one with cliched verbal
or visual effects. (A class B stage exposition would be the "tell" rather
than "show" kind. Here, for instance, a couple of servants might be
discussing Arthur Winslow in terms such as "Our master, old-fashioned and
skeptical about certain modern trends, is not without a sense of humor.
Although he is the unquestioned head of the family, a give-and-take mood
prevails; etc. etc.") In other words, the class B exposition is a kissin'
cousin of plot-telling in reviews of films and plays.</P>
<P>For the discriminating audience, and especially for those who are familiar
with the source play and its film adaptation, the pleasures of Mamet's
Winslow are in details of speech and cinematography.</P>
<P>Example: as disgraced young George stands outside the family home, in the
rain, he is spotted by the household help. The maid throws a shawl on her
back as she goes out to get him. Seconds later, Kate too does this. But the
shawls and the gestures are different. Observe with care and you will
appreciate the subtleties in the flow and the discreet parallels.</P>
<P>Another example. George, now in another school, comes home  by railroad.
Boys will be boys. The youngster is all excited by the speed of train and
tells Father of his calculations of train speeds, while the old man listens
pleasantly but obviously with his thoughts on the family troubles. A
family, mind you, which without fanfare or rhetoric is smoothly shown
closing ranks and bonding more than ever. This includes Dickie (Matthew
Pidgeon, Rebecca's real life brother in his film debut) who has sacrificed
studies at Oxford to get employment. He bears more than a passing
resemblance to Tony Blair.</P>
<P>The Pidgeons, both American (Rebecca was trained at the Royal  Academy of
the Dramatic Arts) sound totally British, although my sharp-eared friend
Pearl Goodman, rich with the experience of teaching English as a second
language, opined that Rebecca's pitch was more American than British.</P>
<P>A third example. In the House, as Kate sit in the Ladies' Gallery, she sees
the now increasingly likable Sir Robert holding the floor. It is a mere
glimpse through the small openings in a metal trellis. The camera merely
touches on the people then cuts outside to a bobby lighting up a smoke.
That's lighter than air cinematography and editing.</P>
<P>A final example, among many. One aspect of the movie is a return to the
pre-Surgeon General's warnings about smoking. Older pictures exploited the
ways, styles and methods of smoking in a huge variety of telling ways.
Think of how, in Now Voyager, Paul Henreid lights cigarettes for Bette
Davis and himself. Think of  To Have and Have Not, and Lauren Bacall's
historic entrance Humphrey Bogart's room. Think of thousands of films from
all countries and all periods. The cigarette was, arguably, the most
creative of all props.</P>
<P>In Winslow the tradition of creative, expressive smoking is resumed,
notably by Kate, a modern, liberated woman. At the same time, in an early
sequence, the consideration of not overpuffing indoors logically leads Kate
and her fiance to step outside for a cigarette, and outside is where the
plot needs to place them.</P>
<P>I've seen the film twice, starting at the 1999 Cannes Festival's in its
third or fourth day. (It was an official selection but not in the main
competition).  The previous films had been rather disappointing. Winslow
was the first exceptionally good work. Yet there was scant attention paid
to it . I overheard no discussions yet I suppose that The Winslow Boy must
have been deemed "old-fashioned" or "traditional," when the truth is that
it was as clever, subtle and accomplished as a number of older, admired
classics. It is far from a routine filmed or "aired-out" play. What you get
is the best of both worlds.</P>
