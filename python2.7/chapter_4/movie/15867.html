<P>SPOILER WARNING: This article contains references to key plot points. 
Proceed at your own risk.</P>
<P>In several interviews, Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon stated their 
belief that "Stepmom" was a poor name for their current film. I agree.
 A much more appropriate title would be "When Bad Movies Happen To 
Good Actors." Watching talents like Roberts, Sarandon and Ed Harris 
mouth virtually every cliché that has ever popped up on the Lifetime 
Channel is beyond embarrassing. Sure, juicy starring roles for women 
are hard to come by, but Julia and Susan, did you actually read this 
script before signing your contracts? As for Ed Harris, I can only 
assume that director Chris Columbus once saved his life and demanded 
that Harris do this movie to repay the debt.  </P>
<P>The story, about the fireworks that come when Dad tries to introduce 
his new love into the lives of his children and ex-wife, exists only 
to allow Sarandon and Roberts a wide berth to strut their stuff. 
"Stepmom" begins as a bitchy relationship drama, then mutates into an 
extremely cheesy tearjerker, with incurable cancer serving as a handy 
device to tie together loose plot threads. The filmmakers are utterly 
shameless in their quest to send you out of the theater drying your 
eyes while saying, "Oh, it was all so sad and so true!" </P>
<P>In fact, almost everything about "Stepmom" is false. The script isn't 
based on anything actual human beings would ever say. Instead, the 
characters spout lines recycled from other hack movies. For example, 
when daughter Anna (Jena Malone) stomps out of the room during a 
family quarrel and her father shouts, "You do NOT run out on your 
mother," she pivots at just the right moment and snaps back, "No, 
that's YOUR job!" It gets worse. One conversation about Anna between 
doomed earth mother Jackie (Sarandon) and inheritor-to-the-throne 
Isabel (Roberts) ends with Jackie intoning "I have her past, and you 
can have her future." Believe it or not, it took five writers to 
create this drivel.</P>
<P>The plotting is as phony as the dialogue, with every situation 
wrapped up oh-so-tidily by the end of each scene, no matter how much 
contrivance it takes to get there. After all, this is a feel-good 
melodrama and director Columbus is determined not to let reality get 
in the way of his cavalcade of golden moments. How far does he go? 
Well, the film features two touching death-bed scenes without the 
central character actually getting around to dying. Neat trick, eh? </P>
<P>Speaking of dying, Susan Sarandon's character is really good at it. 
Once Jackie realizes that her cancer is irreversible, she 
choreographs her upcoming demise in grand fashion, sewing 
commemorative capes and quilts like the Martha Stewart of terminal 
illness. Julia's character also orchestrates a number of Kodak 
moments, including one magical scene where she enchants Jackie by 
filling a room with life-sized stand-up photos of the kids. Forget 
the ludicrously extreme preparation time and expense of creating such 
a display. It looks great and that's the only thing that matters.  </P>
<P>In-between the bickering and bonding, Columbus pads the film with 
sing-a-longs, repeated visits to the same restaurant for heart-to-
heart chats, and that most dreaded of all contemporary clichés, the 
"let's celebrate life and love by lip-synching to a golden oldie" 
scene. Oh, the joy, the heartbreak and the schmaltz of it all!</P>
<P>To be fair, the adult actors give it their best. Julia Roberts, 
radiant as always, does what she can with an unevenly-written 
character who fluctuates maddeningly from sharp-as-a-tack 
professional photographer to flummoxed caregiver to infinitely 
resourceful counselor. Susan Sarandon is excellent as the fiercely 
protective mother, while less successful as the martyr du jour. Even 
during the mawkish last hour, though, she manages to provide the only 
genuine moment in the film, when she pauses and surveys a family room 
while her remarkably expressive eyes flash panic over all she is 
about to lose. </P>
<P>Ed Harris, one of the finest actors in the business, is wasted here, 
disappearing for extremely long stretches of time while the women 
duke it out. And then there's the kids. Jena Malone is suitably 
annoying as Anna and young Liam Aiken, playing her brother Ben, comes 
off more like a very cute toy than an real child. </P>
<P>Earlier this year, "One True Thing" explored family conflicts, 
reconciliation and the great aching tragedy of terminal illness with 
intelligence, insight and dignity. "Stepmom" takes the same issues 
and cheapens them. Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris earned 
big paychecks appearing in this cloying exercise in manipulation. 
Don't waste part of your check on their error in judgment.</P>
