<P>   If Akira Kurosawa, the late great Japanese director, looked
down from his Kyoto-in-the-sky at "Ronin," would he be
pleased?  Now, "Ronin" takes place in contemporary France,
not in medieval Japan, and deals with a band of post-Cold
War adventurers, but John Frankenheimer's latest movie has
mythic dimensions.  The name "Ronin" is explained in the
film's opening statement: "In feudal Japan, the warrior class of
samurai were sworn to protect their liege lords with their lives.
Those samurai whose liege was killed suffered great shame,
and were no longer referred to as samurai.  Such men were
called Ronin."  </P>
<P>   The Ronin in director John Frankenheimer's new movie are
contemporary warriors thrown out of their regular jobs with the
ending of the Cold War.  They no longer feel a loyalty toward
their masters in the Eastern bloc or the IRA, the KGB or the
CIA.  They are alienated by the lack of familiar structure and
now work only for money, except that they still glory in doing
a professional job for the highest bidder.  These Ronin
include a munitions expert, a master driver and a skilled
tactician.  So then, would Kurosawa like what he sees? 
Probably not.  His powerful action movie "The Seven
Samurai" about a Sixteenth Century village which hires
combatants to fend off bandits never sacrificed clarity in the
interest of artistry.  By contrast "Ronin" is not only convoluted:
it seems to boast its confused plot as a metaphor for the
bewilderment felt by these modern warriors who lack all
political loyalties.  Money is the name of the name, not
allegiance to the old masters.  The six men do not know who
is funding their operation and while the woman who is paying
them knows the identity of her boss, she hasn't the foggiest
why her employer is so eager to take possession of a metal
case.  She does not know what's in this case, her band of a
dirty half-dozen hasn't the foggiest idea, and when the movie
ends, neither does the audience.  But then, moviegoers spent
fruitless months discussing what was in the briefcase sported
in "Pulp Fiction."  It matters not that we're kept in the dark
about the contents, only that we're assured the material is
valuable enough to have people kill or die to get it.  What
would be helpful might be some clue about the tangled
scheme of double-dealing that pervades the story as first one
member of the team then another and yet a third betray the
squad to gain all the riches for themselves.  These
motivations are sacrificed so that Frankeheimer--whose
"Manchurian Candidate" scored in 1962 as the year's best
paranoid thriller--could simply serve up a glut of car chases
and standard-issue shootouts.  </P>
<P>   The team of modern, shamed samurai include Sam (Robert
De Niro), formerly a CIA operative who claims to be working
because he needs the money.  He is no gung-ho adventurer
but rather a guy who is teased by a colleague with the query
"Are you worried about saving your own skin?"  "Yeah," is his
honest reply, "It covers my body."  His #1 buddy, Vincent
(Jean Reno), is a Frenchman who may have given so much
attention to learning English that he still has not found the
time to shave.  Gregor (Stellan Skarsgard) looks so sinister
that you can probably guess he will betray the lot while
Spence (Sean Bean) and Larry (Skipp Sudduth) have their
special jobs to perform but are of minimal benefit to the plot.
Deirdre (Natascha McElhone), however, emerges as the most
engaging person in the narrative.  An icy operative who gives
the orders and pays the money, she appears too armored to
have a romantic interest; yet when Sam pretends to kiss her
to avoid notice by the passing police, she responds quite
warmly.</P>
<P>   When the steadicam equipment is not busy injecting realism
into the tension-filled car chases--featuring the usual suspects
of overturned vehicles, exploding metal, tumbling fruit-and-
vegetable bins and fleeing tour groups--Frankenheimer plays
up the dialogue which is surprisingly tame considering its
source.  The screenplay, credited to J.D. Zeik and Richard
Weisz, has actually been re-written from the ground up by
David Mamet using the Weisz pseudonym.  Mamet's staccato
delivery is absent and only occasionally do we hear his
signature exchanges, as when Sam and Vincent compare
notes on the manufacture of the valuable case: "He had the
case made, he had the fake case made, he had the case
made," explains Sam, receiving the reply, "He didn't have time
to have it made--he didn't have time to make the fake case."  </P>
<P>  Jonathan Pryce is perhaps the only really edgy character in
the film and in his short role as an Irish operative with an
array of facial expressions, he eats up the scenery.  The
others do a creditable job with what they have, and what they
have is really a standard action movie given particular
advantage by the stunning French scenery.  Filmed primarily
in Nice and Paris, "Ronin" plays up the noir magic of the City
of Lights on a humid night, the rain casting its spell on the
cobblestone streets.  And the adventurous samurai can't help
taking in some of the splendid scenery on the Riviera as they
haul their Beamers top speed through tunnels, hilly passes,
and graveled country roads, firing their guns as they survey
the Cote d'Azur.</P>
