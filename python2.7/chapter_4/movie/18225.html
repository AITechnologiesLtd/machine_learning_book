Cookie's Fortune (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>a review by Christian Pyle</PRE>
<P>Robert Altman is back!  After a series of muddled efforts ("Pret-a-Porter,"
"Kansas City," and "The Gingerbread Man"), Altman has delivered a quirky comedy
that deserves its place on his distinguished resume.</P>
<P>In "Cookie's Fortune," an elderly woman nicknamed Cookie (Patricia Neal)
commits suicide to join her late husband.  The body is discovered by her niece
Camille (Glenn Close), a domineering neurotic who hurriedly makes the suicide
look like a murder so that no one will suspect there is insanity in her family.
 (Of course, anyone who has met Camille KNOWS there is insanity in her family.)
 Suspicion falls on Cookie's only friend, Willis Richland (Charles Dutton), and
the small-town police try to investigate the murder with the help of some
outside experts.</P>
<P>Altman's trademark is the peopling of a film with a variety of unusual
characters, and the population of Holly Springs, Mississippi, has familiar
faces.  Julianne Moore plays Camille's mousy sister Cora, who knows about the
cover-up but says nothing.  Liv Tyler plays Cora's rebellious daughter Emma,
who takes up residence in Willis' cell.  Boy wonder Chris O'Donnell plays a
bumbling deputy who has the hots for Emma.  Ned Beatty is also on the force;
his character, Lester, has a simple reason for knowing that Willis is innocent:
 "I've fished with the man."  Courtney B. Vance is a suave expert who takes
charge of the investigation.  And lurking around the fringes is Altman regular
Lyle Lovett selling catfish.  Altman's genius is that he can develop characters
with only a few strokes and manage to keep them all in motion without the movie
seeming crowded.</P>
<P>Altman and first-time screenwriter Anne Rapp also texture "Cookie's Fortune"
with lots of wonderful comic touches.  Many of the funniest occur when the
developing investigation disrupts a church group production of "Salome" and
several characters wander around the jail in their costumes from the play. 
Willis' lawyer (Donald Moffat) walks in wearing the purple robes of a king of
Judea topped with a Fedora hat.</P>
<P>Glenn Close gives a flawless comic performance.  Camille is a self-obsessed
refugee from a Tennessee Williams play who is audacious enough to cut down the
yellow crime-scene tape and take up residence in Cookie's house on the same day
as the suicide.  As I watched Close work, I realized that it had been years
since I'd seen her in a project worthy of her talent.  Hollywood tends to
discard its actresses as they reach the middle of life; let's hope that this
role generates more opportunities for her.  </P>
<P>It's a joy to see Patricia Neal again.  Even at 72, she retains the gentle
strength that made her performances in films like "The Day the Earth Stood
Still," "A Face in the Crowd," and "Hud" so memorable.  "Cookie's Fortune" is
her first theatrical release in ten years (in the meantime, she's appeared in
three TV movies).</P>
<P>Holly Springs seems like an updated version of  Mayberry.  Its jail cells are
left unlocked, and there's a genial atmosphere that pervades the town.  The
only person who doesn't fit that mold is Camille, who is wound way too tight
for the pace of small town life; like any great comic character, she is extreme
and rigid while everyone around here is free and loose.  "Cookie's Fortune" is
delightful because it welcomes the audience as friends and invites them to
chuckle at the townsfolk's quirks.</P>
