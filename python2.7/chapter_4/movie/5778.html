<P>     Director Andrew Davis reworks his FUGITIVE formula and the results
are about as exciting as his last film-- the dreadful comedy STEAL BIG,
STEAL LITTLE-- was funny.  Keanu "I'd rather play music than play
another action hero" Reeves is the grad student on the run, who, along
with his superfluous sidekick (Rachel Weisz), has been framed for a
sabotaged science experiment that vaporized eight Chicago city blocks.
(The mushroom-cloud explosion is a knock-out and easily the best part of
the movie.  Or, as one audience member succinctly summed it up: "whoa.")
False information implicates their involvement and boy and girl are soon
on the run, fleeing over open drawbridges, across icy lakes, and through
the corridors of power at a top-secret, underground energy facility.
Aiding and abetting is the team's shady mentor, played in an
excellent-but-so- what performance by Morgan Freeman.  (Brit Brian Cox
is also about, as the behind-the-scenes bad guy.  He has some fun
fiddling with a Southern accent.) Unfunny, overscored, and without a
single shred of suspense, CHAIN REACTION is *the* summer movie to walk
out on.  If you make it to the end, a mess of cross-cutting involving
another imminent explosion, you'll hear somebody say "I guess it's time
to go." Heed that warning.  </P>
