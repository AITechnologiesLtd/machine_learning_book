                         THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY II
                       A film review by Steve Miller
                    This review is in the public domain</PRE>
<P>          CAPSULE:  Not really a sequel, but another film using the same
     clever basis as its predecessor.  A Bushman's children are carried
     away in a truck, which they have never seen before.  He follows the
     tracks, hoping to find them.  Along his way, he encounters a
     biologist, a lost lawyer, poachers and soldiers.  A very funny film
     with a mild philosophical lesson.  Suitable for everyone.</P>
<P>     Following the rule that a sequel must stand on its own, Part Two can be
seen by anyone, whether they saw the original or not.  The producers clearly
knew they had a winning formula, and so (mercifully) not one thing has changed
about how the story is told.  The production values are much higher this time,
which is a plus.  The humor, acting and scenery are virtually identical to the
first film.  That is, there is a droll narrator, some slapstick, a man and a
woman, lots and lots of funny one liners, and interesting and funny animals
(with one creature I cannot identify being entitled to an Oscar for best
supporting beast).</P>
<P>     The only returning character is Xixo (KEE-ko), played once again by N!xua
(I think the ! is a clucking sound made with the tongue; used in the Bushman
language, apparently).  But the formula is identical.  It would be pointless to
summarize the plot beyond what is said in the capsule; the story really isn't
important.  The point of the film is to show the silliness more "advanced"
society can achieve, by comparing its members to Xixo and his simpler ways.
But, the message is very gently delivered, and even the most staunch
conservatives (like me) will not be put off.</P>
<PRE>     A solid 3 on the 1 to 4 scale.  See it.</PRE>
