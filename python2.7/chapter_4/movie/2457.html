<P>     As an example of modern cinematic art, THE CHASE is an utter
failure.  As a character study, it can't get past the comic book
stage.  As a tightly plotted thriller, it's missing about half the
storyline.  But as a piece of unfettered, unpretentious entertainment,
it hits the bullseye.  In the past few weeks, I've seen a number of
movies that are unquestionably better, but few that I've enjoyed as
much.</P>
<P>     Wrongfully accused, arrested, and convicted of a bank robbery,
Jack Hammond (Charlie Sheen) has decided that he'll never get justice
from the legal system, and stages a jail break.  Luck isn't with him,
however, because his stolen VW gets ID'd by two cops when he stops for
gas and a pack of cigarettes, and he's forced to take the nearest
hostage.  This happens to be Natalie Voss (Kristy Swanson), the
daughter of billionaire Dalton Voss (Ray Wise), the "Donald Trump of
California."  Together in Natalie's red BMW, the two race south towards
Mexico, their relationship changing with every passing mile as an
ever-growing fleet of black-and- whites stays on their tail.</P>
<P>     THE CHASE is bursting with energy, almost to the point of an
overload.  Films that move at such a blindingly fast pace often exhaust
the audience long before the final credits roll.  Give writer/director
Adam Rifkin credit for recognizing when to let up a little to allow his
viewers an opportunity to catch their collective breaths.  THE CHASE is
one wild ride, but it won't leave you gasping.</P>
<P>     In addition to the impressively choreographed crash sequences,
Mr. Rifkin's major contribution is a script laden with wit and
satire.  His repeated jabs at action films, hostage dramas, and
especially the television news industry, are far more perceptive than
one might expect from a piece of cartoon fluff like this.  THE CHASE is
rarely serious about anything, and the humor ranges from amusing to
hilarious.</P>
<P>     One of the most incisive elements of this film is its presentation
of the one-upsmanship of the various news crews following the
fugitives.  One station sends their traffic helicopter in pursuit.
Another reporter stands by the side of the road to get the first
ground-level view of the chase.  A third cameraman straps himself to
the side of a speeding news van that pulls alongside the BMW, trying to
get a peek inside.  Then there is the usual assortment of vacuous
announcers, including a wonderfully droll cameo of Cary Elwes (as
anchorman Steve Horsegroovy) staring blankly into the camera.</P>
<P>     In the leading police car are officers Dobbs (Henry Rollins) and
Figus (Josh Mostel), along with a pair shooting footage for a COPS-like
"real drama" television program.  The interaction between the policemen
and their passengers lampoons this richly-deserving target.</P>
<P>     Charlie Sheen who, like Leslie Nielsen, seems to have found a
recent niche in comedy, works well in this role, and develops a
surprisingly effective chemistry with co-star Kristy Swanson.  One
might think that being confined to the front seat of a car would limit
their interaction, but as they move along the predictable route from
fear to empathy to love, it's surprising how few constraints there turn
out to be.</P>
<P>     Analyzing THE CHASE is a fruitless endeavor.  The movie never
pretends to be something that it isn't.  Whether your preference is to
focus on the caustic humor, the nonstop action, or both, the point is
the same.  Sit back, suspend all unnecessary brain activity, and start
munching on popcorn.  These ninety minutes will fly by.</P>
