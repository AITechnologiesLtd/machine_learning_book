<P>JESUS' SON (1999) ** 1/2 Directed by Alison Maclean. Written by 
Elizabeth Cuthtrell, David Urrutia, Oren Moverman, from the eponymous 
book of short stories by Denis Johnson. Cinematography, Adam Kimmel. 
Editing, Stuart Levy and Geraldine Peroni. Music, Joe Henry. 
Produced by Margot Bridger, Elizabeth Cuthrell, Lydia Dean-Pilcher. 
Cast: Billy Crudup (FH), Samantha Morton (Michelle), Denis Leary 
(Wayne), Jack Black (Georgie), Will Patton (John Smith), Greg Germann 
(Dr.Shanis), Holly Hunter (Mira), Dennis Hopper (Bill), et al. A 
Lion's Gate release. 107 minutes. Rated R.</P>
<P>In her second feature (after the interesting, made-in-New Zealand 
"Crush" of 1992), Director Maclean has good company, especially the 
steadily up-and-coming Billy Crudup and Samantha Morton. But is Denis 
Johnson's  source book an ally? It's a collection of short stories 
with fairly personal,  strong and poignant passages about druggies in 
the 1970s. This sort of thing does not translate easily --if at all 
--into a  movie stream, a plot, a continuity. The film does try 
however.</P>
<P>The title came from a Lou Reed song called "Heroin" in which the 
lyrics go "When I'm rushing on my run, and I feel just like Jesus' 
Son..."</P>
<P>Billy Crudup plays FH, which stands for F---Head, which comes from 
anything that can go wrong around the man, doing so. Starting with 
Iowa City in the 70s, FH narrates several episodes in the fragmented, 
zig-zag way that so many sober people use when telling a story. Here 
it is reinforced by the influence of drugs on users.</P>
<P>The characters around FH are, like him, marginal to 
"average-standard" society, their doings and non-deeds are unreal or 
surreal, hallucinatory, with visions and all sorts of oddities. As FH 
(and others) move around the film is more bizarresque than 
picaresque, and a blackly humorous, tenuous but perceptibly present 
link to the old (yet very alive in independent films) Theater of the 
Absurd and to the humor of Jean-Luc Godard.</P>
<P>The main event in FH's micro-odyssey is his meeting and falling in 
love with Michelle, who shoots heroin. Before those two got together, 
FH was clean of hard drugs and something close to a slacker. But when 
the new twosome is formed, Michelle brings the young man to the Big 
H. Their relationship is on and off, often tumultuous, often 
escalating to major fights. From vignettes to larger episodes, the 
milieu of the couple (or of FH when he finds himself alone) is drawn 
in episodic ways, sometimes convoluted (but not so that you cannot 
follow), slightly to heavily comic or ironical equivalents of acts, 
scenes, and bits within scenes. What's incoherent is not the story 
but the lifestyle of its people --including the mysterious sources of 
money for Michelle's and FH's drug purchases, hotel rooms and 
groceries. (It's all the weirder since there are no hints of their 
dealing drugs).</P>
<P>Michelle and the other types are not especially likable or moving, 
but there's something simpatico about FH that calls for our hopes 
that he can find a better life. He seems to get close to this when he 
moves to an Arizona hospital for a strange mix of inmates: old, 
terminally ill, gravely handicapped, near-healthy (cf. Dennis 
Hopper's small part), or imaginary invalids (cf. Holly Hunter who 
throws away her crutch after sex with FH). FH himsef is murkily 
drawn, part in rehab, part as a touchy-feely nurse to the denizens. 
Some added surrealism uses mysteriously an Amish couple, including a 
quick bit where FH touches the Amish wife magically, through a pane 
of glass.</P>
<P>The film goes from attaching moments and involving bits to 
indifferent or alienating ones, then bounces back into acceptability. 
How often and how much I will decide only after a second look in the 
non-near future. Absence may make the heart grow fonder, and surely 
makes the brain work better.</P>
