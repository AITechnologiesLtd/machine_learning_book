<PRE>THE THIRD MAN
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>New "Oscars" were handed over two nights ago. The reaction
that is almost certain is the multitude of furious rants by
film lovers who can't forgive the Academy for favouring
SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, "crowd-pleasing" romantic comedy over
"true art" in Spielberg's WWII epic SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Of
course, this is nothing new and the debate between those who
judge films solely as "art" and those who judge them as
"popular entertainment" has been waged for decades. This
distinction could also be seen in a different perspectives
of film critics and average audience when they judge films
made in certain time periods. Nice example is the question
"What is the best film made in 1940s?" Average movie goer
would quickly answer with a single word: CASABLANCA. Average
critic would offer at least two other titles. One of them is
THE THIRD MAN, 1949 thriller by British director Carol Reed
- film that could be perfect companion piece to CASABLANCA.</P>
<P>Same as Michael Curtiz's celebrated melodrama, THE THIRD MAN
cleverly uses relatively obscure and now almost forgotten
details of that time period in Europe. The setting is
post-WW2 Vienna, picturesque capital of ancient and mighty
Austrian Empire. The empire is long gone, and Austria
reduced to small country, carved up into occupation zones by
victorious Allies. The population of the bombed out capital
is enduring unimaginable economic hardships and many of once
proud citizens are forced to earn for a living through the
thriving black market. To this city comes Holly Martins
(played by Joseph Cotton), American writer of cheap pulp
westerns, who has been invited to the city by his old
college friend Harry Lime. Martins is alcoholic and broke,
and writing about Lime's medical charity operation could
help him to start his career all over again. However, soon
upon the arrival, he is greeted with the shocking news of
Lime's death in automobile accident. To make things even
more puzzling, Major Calloway (played by Trevor Howard)
tells him that Harry Lime happened to be one of the worst
black market racketeers in town. Disbelieving and against
Calloway's wishes, Holly decides to stay in Vienna and try
to clear his friend's name. In the process he meets Anna
Schmidt (played by Allida Valli), actress and Harry's
mistress. Soon, details about Harry's illegal activities
with fake penicillin emerge, as well as contradictory
details about his death. Martins becomes convinced that his
friend was murdered, but the real truth is even more
shocking.</P>
<P>Comparisons between CASABLANCA and THE THIRD MAN are simply
unavoidable. They both have World War 2 in the background,
complex characters with various motivations and not so clear
moral allignment. They both have protagonist who is torn
between conflicting loyalties, self-interest and desire to
do the right thing. However, under that superficial
similarity lies clear distinction and the very reason why
the public prefers the former, and the critics the latter.
CASABLANCA, despite being excellent film, is nothing more
than a piece of WW2 propaganda wrapped into crowd-pleasing
melodrama. THE THIRD MAN, on the other hand, is made four
years after the war ended. Its author, Carol Reed, spent the
war covering it as documentary film-maker in British
military, and seen enough things to know that the world
can't be divided into two worlds of Black and White. The
characters in his film, thanks to screenwriter Graham
Greene, are set in the different shades of Gray. The film
reveals the real results of the noble and epic struggle
heroes of CASABLANCA engaged in. Europe, instead of enjoying
freedom and democracy, is impoverished, demolished, occupied
and humiliated. War time alliances are breaking apart in the
eve of Cold War and noble ideals are replaced with pragmatic
policies.</P>
<P>In such gloomy and nihilistic world, there aren't any place
for old-fashioned heroes. Holly Martins is the last of them,
still believing in things like friendship and doing the
right thing. Unfortunately, this simplistic division of
people into good guys and bad guys, that came straight out
of his pulp westerns, would bring him nothing but misery.
Joseph Cotton was excellent in this role. Another character
that still clings to something like moral code is Anna
Schmidt (played by Italian actress Allida Valli, great diva
of 1940s), but her character is already damaged with the
unimaginable horrors and moral disasters she had endured
through the war years. Her devotion to the deceased lover,
involved in outrageous racket with faulty medicine, is the
attempt to hang onto something solid in the world with the
lost foundations. Even the representatives of law and order,
who are supposed to be the good guys, are people without
scruples. Calloway shows no signs of sympathy towards
Martins or Anna - for him they are simply means to the end.
It was an excellent idea to have Bernard Lee (later best
known as M in the James Bond series) cast as his trusted
sergeant and some kind of comic relief.</P>
<P>However, the pearl that shines most brightely among the
actors in this film is Orson Welles. He plays the worst
villain of them all, yet the viewer, same as poor Anna,
can't escape his captivating evil charisma. Welles'
appearances in film are relatively brief, but they are the
most memorable - whether it is his effective entrance in the
last third of the movie, the final confrontation in Vienna
sewers or the great dialogue at the Ferris Wheel. The latter
scene is most remembered by Welles' immortal words about
Switzerland and Renaissance Italy. Welles simply chewes the
screen and it shouldn't surprise anyone, since he actually
wrote all his lines and practically directed those scenes.</P>
<P>Among other things that distinguishes this film from the
others is the atmosphere. Carol Reed employed all his talent
to picture despair, cynicism and nihilism through visual
means. Many scenes are filmed from unusual angles, which is
metaphor for the twisted moral perspectives of the movie
protagonists. The locations of post-war Vienna were also
perfect -they possess strong contrast between glorious past,
represented in old imperial architecture, and gloomy
present, represented through bombed out ruins. This contrast
serves as metaphor for distinction between nice fa‡ade and
ugly reality (another good example is the scene where
gangster Popescu makes threat to Martins in the form of
literary criticism). The streets of Vienna, especially in
the night, seems like a scenery more appropriate for horror
than for thriller, but Reed amends that by employing zither
music by Anton Karas. The lighthearted music (especially the
title theme that later became unofficial Viennese anthem) is
in another deep contrast with anything but cheerful events
of the film, and it also serve as ironic commentary.
Finally, Reed ends film with the one of the longest but most
powerful shots in the history of cinema.</P>
<P>THE THIRD MAN was the film in many ways before its time. The
quantity of cynicism, misanthropy and nihilism seemed more
suitable for some future time periods, including our own.
Luckily, we haven't been exposed to the remake yet (if we
don't count dreadful 1997 Croatian version called TRECA
ZENA). Until that happens we can enjoy THE THIRD MAN as
true, unhindered masterpiece and the ultimate film noire of
all times.</P>
