<PRE>                         THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY
                       A film review by Sharon Connolly
                        Copyright 1995 Sharon Connolly</PRE>
<P>     Not having read the book, I cannot comment on its transfer to the
big screen, but THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY is certainly a film worth
seeing, if not just for Meryl Streep's mesmerizing performance alone.
True, the film has its flaws like poor character development of Robert
Kincaid but the essential theme is relative to most anyone especially
those of us who have taken marital vows.  Yes, it's possible to fall in
love again, feel young again and experience that sexual huner and
yearning no matter how old we are.</P>
<P>     Someone mentioned having a problem believing this frumpy housewife
could begin lusting after this world-traveled photographer.  Well, I'm
51 years old and I'm sure I'm regarded as a frumpy housewife and yet,
what I felt at 20 has not disappeared.  Why do some people think only
the young and beautiful have cornered this market on sex?  We saw this
happen to another ordinary English housewife in BRIEF ENCOUNTER.  In
fact, the more ordinary the woman, the more meaningful the story.</P>
<P>     I will admit it's much more a woman's film.  The emotional content
is highly volatile and will perhaps provoke some sentimental and sad
memories as well as some happy ones.  How many of us go through life
feeling we could have had more?  There are always an infinite number of
"if only's" in our lives.</P>
<P>     Meryl Streep certainly became Francesca to her audience over the
135 minutes we watched her.  Her accent was superb - as usual.
(Remember OUT OF AFRICA?)  Even her physical appearance seemed
changed.  Yes, Meryl carried the film.  She was well directed by Clint
but I agree with many others that he didn't fit the role.  He could
have more easily played the quiet and laid back husband.  Don't we know
Clint as a man of few words?  I envisioned someone with a really sexy
voice and it was ironic that someone mentioned Sam Elliot though I
prefer the likes of Peter Coyote.  Now there's a man you could think
about bathing with by candlelight!!</P>
<P>     Most men will probably find this film very dull, much too long and
not too relevant.  Women, however, love romanticism and never seem to
get enough and never lose their yearning for it no matter how realized
it is in their own lives.  If you feel unfulfilled, you'll leave the
theater feeling a little better in the way you related to Francesca or
if you're like me and  was fortunate in finding a "soulmate" in a
husband, then you'll feel really blessed.  (But I'm still going to
dream and yearn)</P>
