<P>A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  And if "The Object of My
Affection" was a chain, it would be a strong one.  Of all the things I
like about this film, and there are a lot, the large and outstanding
supporting cast is by far the most notable.  Our main characters, Nina
Borowski and George Hanson, are played wonderfully and realistically by
Jennifer Aniston in her best role yet and Paul Rudd, who I personally
enjoyed in "Clueless."  Alan Alda is full of funny lines as Nina's book
agent brother-in-law, Sidney Miller, and Allison Janney is hilarious as
his wife and Nina's half-sister, Constance Miller, a woman with firm
ideas about how things should be.  Of all the supporting roles, she was
my absolute favorite.  Timothy Daly is effective as Dr. Robert Joley,
George's initial, self-centered love interest.  And John Pankow turns in
an excellent performance as Nina's boyfriend, Vince McBride, who
develops into much more as the film progresses.  He successfully meets
the challenge of creating a guy who isn't simply the bad guy, but rather
is just not Nina's idea of a perfect match.  Real people break up
because they don't get along with each other, not because one is an
obvious loser.  It is a credit to the script that Vince is a real
person, not just the jerk boyfriend.  Other excellent performances are
given by Amo Gulinello, Kevin Carroll, Marilyn Dobrin, Steve Zahn and
Nigel Hawthorne, who is excellent as an aging gay man and Nina's voice
of reason.  This film is stuffed full of interesting people, and the
script manages them effortlessly.</P>
<P>Another thing I enjoyed is that these characters have jobs, and they
actually work!  OK, they all have incredibly happy, politically-correct
jobs - even Vince is a public defender - but we get to see them working
nonetheless.  Since the average person works over 40 hours a week, it's
nice to feel that what we do with the majority of our lives is worthy of
film.  I like to see characters working just like real people.  Well,
almost like real people.</P>
<P>In fact, when we first meet George he is directing a performance at the
elementary school where he teaches.  The Miller's daughter is a student
there and a performer in the show, which leads to George and Dr. Joley
going to dinner at the Miller's that night.  Nina and George meet and
bond, and when it becomes apparent that George will be needing a new
place to live, Nina jumps at the chance to get a roommate to live in her
spare bedroom, and one who is a respected teacher and friend of the
family, no less.  This leads to a beautiful friendship, the basis of the
whole film.</P>
<P>The conflict arises when Nina becomes pregnant and asks her best friend,
George, to stay with her permanently and act as a father figure. 
Needless to say, this norm-defying decision sends waves through Nina's
circle of friends and relatives.  Most upset is Vince, the father of the
child, who upon being told that Nina would rather be with George than
him, immediately assumes he is being pushed completely out of the
picture and storms off.  And of course, Constance, not one to be into
alternative living arrangements, is completely against the setup.  The
truth she sees though, is that Nina is falling in love with George, and
we all know that can only lead to trouble.</P>
<P>The beauty of `The Object of My Affection,' is that it sets up complex
personal issues, and it doesn't back away for a minute; it lets them
play out.  For example, there is a scene where Nina and George come
close to physical intimacy.  And we think, what are they doing?  Is
George leading Nina on?  Yes, although I'm sure he's not thinking
straight at the moment.  Is Nina fooling herself?  Obviously.  Could
this happen in real life?  Yes, I'm sure it does. I find that films are
often criticized when characters are written realistically and allowed
to do the crazy things we do but don't like to admit.  Julia Roberts and
Cameron Diaz found this out in `My Best Friend's Wedding.'  People
complained about the girl who would quit college to get married and the
strong, single woman who still would drop everything to pursue a man,
yet I could introduce you to plenty of women just like Julianne and
Kimmy.  It can be inspiring when characters are role models, but it's OK
(and at times refreshing) for characters to represent real people, too. </P>
<P>And while `The Object of My Affection' may not be `As Good as it Gets,'
it does set up surprisingly delightful scenes and then let the audience
sit back and enjoy them, much as that excellent film did.  It also
benefits from excellent editing (I loved how Nina and George's
friendship was developed through dance) and scene segues, not to mention
it's FUNNY.  At one point I missed two lines because the audience was
laughing so loud.  Four words:  Mothers of Latino Lesbians.</P>
<P>Not content to be simply funny and heartwarming, however, `The Object of
My Affection' has a thesis, and it is this: You should find one person
in life to love as a partner and try to make it work with them.  I, and
probably some cultures who practice polygamy, don't blindly accept this
simple assertion as necessarily true, but I'm sure it appeals to the
majority.  Personally, I found myself wondering why George's new
boyfriend, Paul James played by Amo Gulinello, didn't simply move in
with them.  Although they would have needed a bigger place!  And Nina
did need to release and grow past her romantic love for George, who
despite his dalliance with Nina, is gay.  I do like how `The Object of
My Affection' embraces the time-tested notion of monogamy while
incorporating all of the idiosyncrasies of life today:   homosexuality,
divorce, interracial relationships, etc.  Although that last one is
thrown in a bit gratuitously.</P>
<P>If there is a major flaw in this film, it is that the ending is too easy
and too perfect.  In the end, everyone has someone and happiness is
delivered wrapped up nicely with a pretty bow.  That being said, I have
to admit I loved it.  Children singing `Gotta Be.'  Nina's daughter
Molly, played by Sarah Hyland, saying that she had more people come see
her in the school show than anyone because of the extended family Nina
has built around herself.  A perfect picture of how we can create a
village of friends and family through acceptance and open-mindedness. 
This is Nina's world, and it is a pretty perfect place by the end of the
film.  So what.  I wouldn't mind living there myself.  It sometimes
seems that people would rather see films where unrealistic characters
exist in realistic settings.  As though to ask, what would a perfect
person do in my world?  Straight realism aside, I would rather see
realistic people existing in a more perfect world.  As if to say, if we
all tried a little harder, how could it be?  I hope we get there some
day.</P>
