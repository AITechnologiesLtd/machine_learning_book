things that could spoil the film for those who haven't seen it.}</P>
<PRE>THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT  (1999)</PRE>
<P>A low budget fright fest, The Blair Witch Project plays upon our
now-programmed ideology, brought about by News footage and Real Video
programs, that video footage is "truth", bringing a realism to the story
that probably wouldn't exist if it were made entirely on film.</P>
<P>TBWP has had a great turn of excellent hype and word of mouth, but it didn't
do it for me. The story elements of the Blair Witch during the beginning of
the film went by too fast, and some key elements that were to be
foreshadowed later on, zipped by almost imperceptibly. The BWP website gives
much detailed information about the background of the Blair Witch, more than
is presented in the film. This, in my mind, is good and bad. Good that we
get the fascinating background information, bad that most of it isn't in the
film.</P>
<P>The characters were all realistic and well acted, considering that the
entirety of their performances was more or less improvised on the spot.
Their camerawork has an honest amateurism to it, but the constant shakiness
wore me down, and inability to turn off the auto focus would have been
something any filmmaker worth their salt would have done. (Unless, of course
they were told to turn off the auto-focus.) Also the rationale of constantly
taping every day's events was thin at best, other than that if they didn't
there wouldn't have been much of a film. And on that note, while the
characters are lost and hungry in the woods, why doesn't Heather take out
her book "How to Stay Alive in the  Woods" which we clearly see at the
beginning of the film? I guess she only had it out of a sense of irony.</P>
<P>The characters also seem to dump the human instinct of self preservation and
"flight or fight", that say, that characters in "The Edge" displayed so
well. In that film, it was a Bear, Not a "Ghost" or a "Witch", or a "Witch's
Ghost". A large bonfire was built in that film to light up the darkness, and
weapons were fashioned for self protection from a very real, menacing
Grizzly Bear. But what do our intrepid filmmakers do? They hide themselves
in a cramped tent and complain that they're out of smokes. And for that,
they deserve thier fate.</P>
<P>After they team leaves the town and finishes their interviews of the
townsfolk ,the film breaks down into simple formula:</P>
<P>Walk around. Tape stuff. Get lost. "Colorfully" complain about how lost they
are. Gradual group dynamic and individual breakdown. Sleep in tent. Get
scared late at night. Repeat.</P>
<P>The days were longest parts of the film, and while the conflicts between the
characters were fine, and shouldn't have been made any shorter, the night
scenes should have been made longer, considering they were the best parts of
the film, although they never became more than fleetingly frightful. In
contrast, the climax, taking place in the old house in the woods had what
all the other night scenes didn't have. A sense of dread. The characters
became separated (which is a genre no-no) and the character Mike frantically
rushes around the house looking for Josh, the member of the team who went
missing, whose voice can be heard yelling, from no discernible direction.
Meanwhile, Heather tries to follow him, screaming all the way. It was the
best edited, best shot scene, and the most effective.</P>
<P>Had the other night scenes been this effective, the film would have lived up
to the hype. Although I would have liked to have seen the Blair Witch at
least once. Not seen dead on, but seen for less than a split second, moving
just out of frame, enough so that we can see it, but not enough to make out
what it is, or even so that we debate that we saw it at all.</P>
<P>Although I didn't really like the film, it later played with my imagination
like a good spook story, making every little noise a threat, and I caught
myself occasionally looking over my shoulder. But I wanted more satisfaction
in the theatre, not a creepy afterglow. If I wanted creepy afterglow, I'd go
to the secondhand bookstore and pick up a spooky ghost story book for less
than 2 bucks. Instead I blew 9 bucks on a shaky 80 minute home video.</P>
