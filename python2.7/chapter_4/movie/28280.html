<PRE>Shrek (2001)</PRE>
<P>Most of the 89 minutes of the computer animated SHREK are a delightful 
lampoon of fairy tales.  The trouble is, SHREK ends up following the same 
sanitized formula at which it had been thumbing its nose.</P>
<P>DreamWorks SKG has translated William Steig's children's book into a slick 
story to hold the attention of today's audiences.  It's really a clichéd 
tale, when you think about it – an outsider in the form of the big green 
ogre Shrek( voiced by Mike Meyers, with a Scottish, who wants his privacy 
back when all kinds of storybook characters, evicted from their abodes, show 
up in Shrek's part of the forest; Shrek takes a sidekick (the Donkey is 
voiced by Eddie Murphy, by far the best voice actor in the movie) and 
commences a quest to find Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz).</P>
<P>Sound familiar?  Needless to say, you can see the ending from across the 
forest, even through  all of the trees.</P>
<P>There are lots of good things SHREK has going for it, though.  Worthy 
satires have creative villains, and John Lithgow pulls the bad guy off 
wonderfully here – Lord Farquaad is a little stump of a man with a pompous 
voice – he even has fake legs into which he inserts his own short ones when 
he rides his horse.  And something grand happens to him at the end, as well.</P>
<P>There's a moment of absolute sick hilarity, when Fiona has a seemingly sweet 
whistling duel with a smiling birdie.  When it tries a pitch as high as 
Fiona's, the camera pans away and we sense the bird has exploded!  What 
happens to the three eggs in its nest?  Fiona fries them and serves them to 
Shrek and Donkey!  SHREK is at its best when it tries to emulate the spirit 
created by POLITICALLY INCORRECT BEDTIME STORIES.</P>
<P>Directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson pace the story well enough, and 
use the animation for all kinds of delightful effects.  I would recommend 
seeing SHREK if you ever were a fan of Mother Goose, The Brothers Grimm; 
alas, if you are a fan of Disney films, you will not be disappointed at the 
end, but you will have to sit through some archly funny moments.</P>
