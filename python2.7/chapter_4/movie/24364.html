"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Agoraphobic Kim Basinger hasn't made a film since her Oscar-winning role
in L.A. Confidential.  For someone that's afraid to leave their house,
you might have expected her next project to be a low-key affair with
generic settings so as to accommodate her limiting illness.  This makes
Basinger's decision to tackle the lead role in I Dreamed of Africa ? a
film primarily shot in Africa ? such a surprise.  And Basinger is better
here that she was in Confidential, but, unfortunately, trying to equate
the two films would be like comparing apples and…well, dog crap.</P>
<P>Africa is based on Kuki Gallman's autobiographical novel of the same
name, and (kooky) Basinger plays the role of the author in the film.  As
the picture opens, we learn that Kuki is a well-to-do single mom living
in Venice with her mother (Eva Marie Saint, My Antonia) and
seven-year-old son Emanuele (Liam Aiken, Stepmom).  After being badly
injured in a car wreck, Kuki falls in love with and eventually marries
Paolo (Vincent Perez, The Crow: City of Angels) a victim of the same
crash.</P>
<P>Paolo is a thrill-seeker who dreams of one day returning to Kenya, where
years ago he worked on a cattle farm with his brother.  As a little
girl, Kuki's deceased father would regale the girl with stories of his
adventures on the Dark Continent.  So, logically, the two decide to pack
up and leave Venice for a place in the African wild called Ol Ari Nyiro
Ranch.</P>
<P>Of course, Kuki and Co. have problems fitting in, what with the
poachers, lion attacks, struggles with the natives and dangerous
snakes.  Their home is literally falling apart and, to make matters
worse, Paolo leaves for days on end to play safari with his new
friends.  Kuki spends her time worrying, fixing up the house, working in
the garden and, although they don't show it, tending to her hair, which
is always quite pleasant-looking despite adversity attacking from every
imaginable direction.</P>
<P>Africa was directed by Hugh Hudson (My Life So Far) and adapted from
Kuki's true story by Paula Milne (Mad Love) and Susan Shilladay (Legends
of the Fall).  The film depicts about ten years in the lives of Kuki and
her family, but they don't really experience anything that we haven't
already seen before.  And unlike, say Out of Africa, there is absolutely
no chemistry between Basinger and Perez (maybe Alec Baldwin had a rifle
cocked and pointed at Perez during filming?).  The scenery is well-shot,
but that and Basinger's performance aren't enough to salvage the film.</P>
<P>The problem with Africa is that the story never really goes anywhere.
It's kind of an unfocused mess, and ends up being a beautiful bore.
Okay, Africa is dangerous and full of deadly animals and unscrupulous
poachers - I get it.  But there's going to be adversity wherever you
live.  Africans don't have to deal with traffic, school shootings,
disgruntled day-traders or Republicans.  And they probably don't have to
hear about Elian Gonzalez, either.</P>
<P>Hey, Africa doesn't sound too bad right now.</P>
<P>1:52 – for violence, the depiction of animal murder and cruelty, brief
nudity and mild adult language</P>
