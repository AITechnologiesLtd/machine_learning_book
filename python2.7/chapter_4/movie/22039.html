<PRE>_Toy_Story_2_ (G) **** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>When Disney announced the production of a direct-to-video sequel to
Pixar's smash 1995 computer-animated feature _Toy_Story_, my expectations
weren't exactly set soaring.  The subsequent announcement that the
project was going so well that the Mouse decided to give it a big-screen
release didn't instill any new faith.  After all, this was Disney, who
never passed up an opportunity to soil the memory of a beloved animated
feature with a truly atrocious, completely unnecessary sequel.  Ever see
_The_Lion_King_II:_Simba's_Pride_?  Or the even more blasphemous
_Beauty_and_the_Beast:_The_Enchanted_Christmas_?  Consider yourself
incredibly lucky if you haven't.</P>
<P>So it was that greater of a shock--and an extremely pleasurable one at
that--to discover that _Toy_Story_2_ not only equals, but bests the
classic original film.  I had thought that the first _Toy_Story_ had
completely exhausted all the ideas for its cast of toy characters.  After
all, by film's end, the film's clever conceit that astronaut action
figure Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) believed he was an actual
Space Ranger was resolved, and he and rival for owner Andy's affections,
pull-string cowboy Woody (Tom Hanks) had mended fences.  Having done all
that with an Oscar-nominated blend of all-ages humor and grown-up
intelligence, where else could director John Lasseter go with the story?</P>
<P>As it turns out, many different--and more complex--places.  On one
level, _Toy_Story_2_ is a witty knock on the ever-growing toy collecting
market, where adults buy toys and never open them, keeping them for an
investment rather than their intended use as a child's plaything.  Woody
is stolen by a toy collector/toy store owner named Al (Wayne Knight) for
a hefty profit.  As it turns out, Woody is the main item in an old toy
line tied to a western-themed puppet television series called
_Woody's_Roundup_, and he reunites with the other members of his TV
family--cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack), horse Bullseye, and old prospector
Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammer)--in Al's office.</P>
<P>Screenwriters Andrew Stanton, Rita Hsiao, Doug Chamberlin, and Chris
Webb also have deeper interests in mind.  Al, of course, intends to sell
the now-complete _Woody's_Roundup_ collection, an idea that Woody balks
at--he just wants to go home to Andy and his friends--but Jessie
wholeheartedly embraces.  Jessie, it is revealed, once had an owner, but
the owner abandoned her once she grew up.  Determined to not be
heartbroken again, Jessie wants to be loved and paid attention to
forever, even if it's from passing admirers looking through a glass case.
 This surprising crisis-of-existence theme--what's a toy to do once its
owner inevitably abandons it?--sounds a bit heady for a film with largely
kid appeal, but it's a tribute to the terrific writing that it's made
easily understandable for the young 'uns as well as the adults.  The
stunning example is the beautiful scene where Jessie tells her story
through the heartbreaking Randy Newman-penned, Sarah McLachlan-sung
ballad "When She Loved Me" (a lock for a Best Original Song Oscar nod
next year).</P>
<P>Despite all the richness of theme and emotion in _Toy_Story_2_, Lasseter
and co-director Lee Unkrich never forget what the film mainly is: a comic
adventure.  And there is plenty of comedy and adventure as Woody's toy
friends, led by Buzz, attempt a daring rescue of Woody from Al's toy
store.  That means a number of hilarious encounters with other toys,
including a perky Barbie (Jodi Benson, best known as Ariel from
_The_Little_Mermaid_) and, in a very clever touch, a fresh-from-the-box
Buzz Lightyear--who indeed believes himself to be a Space Ranger.</P>
<P>Augmenting all the fun of _Toy_Story_2_ is the amazing computer
animation.  A lot of advances have been made in the field since the
original film's release in 1995, and the visuals in the new film are
absolutely stunning--not to mention increasingly realistic.  Al's
skintone and hairy arms are remarkably lifelike, and Andy's dog is just
thisshy of looking exactly like the real thing.  What impressed me the
most, however, were the textures: the paint on metal surfaces, the
imperfect consistency of the human's (namely Al's) skin, the gravelly
road surface.  The detail is even more jawdropping when the film is seen
at one of the handful of theatres showing the film in crystalline DLP
all-digital projection.</P>
<P>It goes without saying that things work out for the best by the end of
_Toy_Story_2_, but this is one happy ending not without a tinge of the
bittersweet; Andy will eventually grow up, and all of his toys will find
themselves without a place to go.  But if there is a central moral to
_Toy_Story_2_, it's the old reliable "seize the day," and movie audiences
would best take that to heart and seize the opportunity to see one of the
brightest cinematic accomplishments to hit the silver screen this year.</P>
