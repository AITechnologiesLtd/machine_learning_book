<P>It is so very rare to see a film that is so involving that you're
afraid to look away from the screen for a second. Such a film would
make time stop; it would be an experience that would feel so lifelike
that you'd never look at a movie the same way again. Such a film would
finally show you why movies are made. Not for the benefit of the
filmmaker; but for the benefit of the viewer. Tom Tykwer's "Run Lola
Run" is such a film. It is a film so frenetically fast-paced and
involving that it makes "Go" seem like a Theo Angelopolous melodrama.</P>
<P>"Run Lola Run" starts off with the sounds of a techno beat that
doesn't cease until the movie is through. The film is the product of
music videos, comic books, video games and pure genius. The title
character is first shown as a cartoon in the blistering opening credit
sequence.</P>
<P>Red-haired Lola(Franka Potente) has just recieved a call from her
boyfriend, Manni(Moritz Bleibtreu). Through tears, he tells her that
because she didn't come to pick him up, he owes 100,000dm to a
"friend". The money that he was supposed to deliver was accidentally
left on a subway and stolen by a homeless man. Manni has 20 minutes to
get the money, or he will be killed.</P>
<P>Lola explains that her motorbike was stolen, and she couldn't come to
pick him up. She tells him to wait in the phone booth and somehow she
will get ahold of 100,000dm and get it to him. Full speed ahead, Lola
starts running in whichever direction she can in order to get the
money. Her quest leads her to find out some incriminating family
secrets; and for every person whom she bumps into, a little sequence
is flashed showing what happened to that person afterwards.</P>
<P>This plot, of Lola running to get the money, is repeated three times,
making up the entirety of the film.  Each one of her attempts has a
different, meaningful outcome, but she always can get another
chance(at the beginning of the film, a quote is shown that says "The
end of the game is the beginning of the game").</P>
<P>It's almost impossible to describe in words what a masterpiece "Run
Lola Run" is. The end of the millenium is a perfect time to release
the film in the U.S., because the film is the debut of a whole new
style of film. A film, that is 80 minutes long, stylish, continuously
fast-paced, and impossible not to enjoy. In my book, writer-director
Tom Tykwer has just become the next master of suspense.</P>
<P>Looking back at 1999's films, I noticed that "Run Lola Run" is far
better than anything that has been released. You could combine "The
Matrix" and "Go" and still not come close to the energy that this film
produces. "Run Lola Run" is purely cinematic in its form, and it
pushes the medium of film to its limit. This German gem may just be
this year's foreign film that will become a runaway hit. In essence,
"Run Lola Run" is perfect both in style and in substance.</P>
