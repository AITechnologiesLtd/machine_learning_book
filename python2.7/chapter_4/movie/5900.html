<PRE>                                    JFK
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>         [This is one of my golden oldies reviews - written years 
          ago when I was just getting started and never posted. 
          I stand by the conclusions, but in most cases many details 
          are missing that I would normally include today.]</PRE>
<P>     Movie Premise: Kennedy was killed because of Vietnam and almost
every man, woman and child alive at the time was part of the
conspiracy.</P>
<PRE>     My short review: Sure.</PRE>
<P>     My expanded review: Oliver Stone is a great movie director.
Sometimes he lets his skill go to his head.  This is a fine movie from
a technical and an acting viewpoint.  The problem is that it is all
balderdash.</P>
<P>     So I guess, I do recommend it, but why oh why can't he sprinkle in
a little realism.  I hate fantasies masquerading as reality.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
