<PRE>TO: Wes Craven</PRE>
<PRE>FROM: Ed Johnson-Ott</PRE>
<PRE>RE: Music of the Heart</PRE>
<P>Congratulations on the new film, Wes. After a long career as a horror
director, I can certainly understand why you wanted to break into the
mainstream. With "Music of the Heart," you've certainly done so. In
fact, this inspirational story, starring Meryl Streep as a
middle-class woman who brings the joy of music to inner-city kids, is
about as mainstream as you can get. I do have a few questions about
the production, though, and hope you'll bear with me.</P>
<P>I realize how frustrating it was to be locked into the horror
genre. You were never given the respect you deserve, despite being one
of the greats. You wrote and directed the original "A Nightmare on Elm
Street," only to see the studio take your creation and crank out a
series of increasingly shoddy sequels. You did a hell of a job
directing "The Serpent and the Rainbow" (that scene with the wicked
government man approaching a strapped-down Bill Pullman with a hammer
and a long nail… Yikes!), but the film didn't appear to open any
new doors for you. Even with the incredible success of the "Scream"
franchise, you were still perceived by some as just another guy who
makes scary movies. The money and respectability of mainstream films
must have been incredibly tempting, but I wonder what drew you to this
particular project.</P>
<P>I know that you were moved by the true-life saga of Roberta Guaspari,
a mother of two from New York's suburbs who started teaching violin to
kids in Harlem after her husband left her. Her story is moving and
dramatic, especially when, after a decade of service, funding cuts
threaten to end her music program, but…</P>
<P>Wes, what I'm getting at is this. Why make a big, glossy Hollywood
movie of this story? The 1996 documentary, "Small Wonders," already
captured the magic of Roberta and her devoted students. The violin
playing was wonderful and the Carnegie Hall concert footage
stunning. With an Academy Award nominated feature already available to
the public, why recreate it with actors? I realize that many people
would rather have a root canal than watch a documentary, but did you
really think a fictionalized account would pack as much punch as the
real thing?</P>
<P>Frankly, if your intent was to share insights about Roberta Guaspari,
it didn't work very well. Yes, we understand how shaken she was when
her husband ditched her; that was obvious. Roberta comes off
determined and obsessive, but what really makes her tick? Her young
sons seem fiercely devoted to mom, but when the film abruptly jumps
ahead ten years, her oldest boy is surly and resentful, complaining
about virtually every aspect of her parenting skills. Then, almost as
suddenly, he does a complete behavioral turnaround and is all smiles
again. What was up with that?</P>
<P>And why the formulaic story treatment? Come on, man, a lot of this
movie plays like something from the Lifetime Channel. You incorporate
virtually every cliché in the book, including a reaction shot from
a dog, for God's sake! Many characters seem to exist solely as props
for Roberta, like the Afro-Centric mother whose fiery rhetoric is
snuffed out by one Arthur Ashe reference from Roberta. Too easy,
Wes. And was it really necessary to throw in that nasty music
department character? Not only was the actor over the top, but his
presence seemed totally unnecessary.</P>
<P>Now, I know Madonna was originally cast in the role of Roberta, but
left because of "creative differences." Exactly what were those
creative differences? Did you finally see her in "Shanghai Surprise?"
Speaking of casting, why hire Gloria Estefan and the wonderful Angela
Bassett and then barely use them? Such a waste of talent.</P>
<P>Of course, some of the casting worked out well. Meryl Steep turns in a
fine performance, although her mannerisms are awfully reminiscent of
her character in "The Bridges of Madison County." As Roberta's
potential love interest, Aidan Quinn is more lifelike than usual. I
loved seeing Cloris Leachman back on the screen, even though her
character is another cliché, and young Michael Angarano is terrific
playing Nick as a boy.</P>
<P>Forgive me if it seems like I'm damning the movie with faint praise,
but I expected more sparks and less convention from a man as talented
as you. There were exhilarating moments, like the shots of various
children learning self-esteem from the discipline of playing the
violin, and the concert sequence is electric, even though it also
seemed a little too slick. More interaction between the violin masters
and the students might have helped. Incidentally, was one of the
characters sporting Freddy Krueger's hat? If so, nice touch!</P>
<P>Hopefully, on your next mainstream film, you'll feel comfortable
enough to take more chances. In the meantime, I'll rent "Small
Wonders" and watch the real thing instead of this movie-of-the-week
version. One final request, Wes. Would you track down the Miramax
executive who changed the title of the film from "Fifty Violins" to
the sappy "Music of the Heart" and kick his ass for me? Thanks, buddy.</P>
