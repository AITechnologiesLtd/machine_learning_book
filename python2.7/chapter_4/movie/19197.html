<P>"The 44 Caliber Killer has struck again."</P>
<P>Starring John Leguizamo, Mira Sorvino, Adrian Brody, Jennifer Esposito,
Michael Rispoli, Bebe Neuwirth. Rated R.</P>
<P>Summer of Sam will be remembered as a waste of Spike Lee's abilities.
Lee is a great filmmaker, often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par
with Brian DePalma and Martin Scorsese and a storytelling ability
comparable to Steven Spielberg. But here, he gets himself into a bind.
His latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to
say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his
work.</P>
<P>The summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in New York City. It was the
hottest summer on record. To boot, New York's first serial killer was on
the loose: calling himself the Son of Sam, David Berkowitz killed 9
people in the New York area and frightened the whole city population. So
it was understandable that when NYC was hit with a citywide blackout,
people went berserk, causing billions of dollars in damage to the city.</P>
<P>The movie's focus is on a group of twenty-somethings during that fateful
summer: Vinny (John Leguizamo), a club-hopping, adultrous hairdresser,
his benevolent wife Dionna (Mira Sorvino, looking young), Ritchie
(Adrian Brody), a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a Son of Sam
suspect, a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters.
We follow them through their roller coaster lives, thrown out of whack
even more by the recent killings. Vinny and Dionna have marital problems
because Vinny cheats and Dionna tries to please him, make him stay
faithful to her. Ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he
has started to become more and more "eccentric," and has degenerated to
the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his
girlfriend.</P>
<P>Tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of Son of
Sam's first murder looms; the night he promises he will strike again. A
local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of
the people that its members think might be suspects. At the top of the
list is Ritchie. Vinny, an unwilling part of the said group, is called
upon to set a trap for his friend.</P>
<P>As we watch these proceedings, some of which are painfully graphic, the
dreaded "So what?" question springs to mind. From the way this movie is
made, I'd have guessed that Spike Lee was trying to tell us something,
but as I searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there
to find. Lee touches on so much -- the media, the 70's punk scene, the
details of the actual killings, as well as the characters' very personal
dilemmas -- but he doesn't bring all of his topics together to form a
coherent theme or make a discernible statement.</P>
<P>All is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow; it can be a saving
grace for the film to be enjoyable. Too bad Summer of Sam doesn't get
any help here. Frankly, it's a bore, a redundant and repetitive two hour
and twenty minute film that doesn't entertain beyond its first half
hour. There is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about
the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled
and its focus too vague.</P>
<P>Leguizamo's turn as Vinnie is annoying and whiny. The script makes it
clear that we're supposed to believe that his character is flawed, but
still a good guy. You'd never guess from his performance. Adrian Brody
and especially Mira Sorvino fare better. Sorvino gives a riveting,
touching performance in a banal movie (I'm tempted to think that I liked
her because nearly everything else around her was inane); her character
is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart. Brody, too paints an
effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a
little more than he bargained for.</P>
<P>Summer of Sam has some superficial elements of a good film: it looks
great, it has a few notable performances and I suppose it's pretty well
directed, in a purely technical way. But it's also empty, pretentious
and boring. Like last year's The Thin Red Line, it's a movie by a
director who doesn't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says
it anyway.
