<PRE>                                FOR LOVE OR MONEY
                            A film review by Jon Ridge
                           Copyright 1993 by Jon Ridge</PRE>
<P>CAST:  Michael J. Fox, Gabrielle Anwar, Anthony Higgins, Michael Tucker,
       Dan Hedaya, Bob Balaban (who never appeared...)
DIRECTOR:  Barry Sonnenfield
SCREENPLAY:  Mark Rosenthal, Lawrence Konner
SCORE:  Bruce Broughton
RELEASE:  October 1, 1993</P>
<P>     I don't like movies that start off bad and end up that way, too.
I don't like movies that present an audience with absolutely no
redeeming values (nothing to laugh at, or cry about, or feel excited
about).  I don't like movies that front as something that they're not.
I don't like movies like this one.</P>
<P>     Michael J. Fox stars as Douglas Ireland, concierge at a ritzy
hotel in New York.  He doesn't take his work lightly--the man makes
people feel useful, saves marriages, takes dogs for a walk, gives you
tickets to any Broadway show you want.  And Doug has a dream of
creating his very own hotel, called THE DOUG, or THE RIVER HOUSE.  He
just needs to make a big-time money man very happy in the mean time, so
that he can close a deal.  To do this, he must take good care of the
man's younger mistress (played by Gabrielle Anwar).  The woman is
beautiful, and Doug has been after her for some time now, so he gladly
accepts the job and does whatever it takes to make his dream a
reality.</P>
<P>     Well, Doug falls in love with her (big surprise, huh?).  The only
problem is, he can't act on his feelings for risk of crushing his
dream.  Ah, what's a man to do...?  I knew what would happen.  In fact,
I knew everything about this movie within the first ten minutes it
played.  FOR LOVE OR MONEY is an exercise in just how predictable and
utterly worthless a comedy--or *movie*, in general--can be.  It isn't
funny, or romantic, or engaging, or surprising, or original in any
way.  Fox acts with some sort of smirk on his mug the whole time, and
basically looks rather bored throughout the movie.  The usually strong
supporting "love interest" that should have backed him up--or, in this
case, sufficed for him--is played by an enigmatic young actress named
Gabrielle Anwar.  We saw her briefly in SCENT OF A WOMAN, doing the
tango with Al Pacino, but got nothing, no sort of impression, from her
little screen time in the film.  I guess FOR LOVE OR MONEY came to her
in the wake of the success of that movie, she read over the screen
play, and said, "Yeah, i should probably do this so I can work some
more and survive in this business."  It's just too bad for her that the
script, by two different people, has *no* luster about it whatsoever.</P>
<P>     And what about Michael J. Fox?  What's his problem?  I know he can
be funny, I saw it in BACK TO THE FUTURE 1, 2, and 3.  I know he can be
dramatic, I saw that in CASUALTIES OF WAR.  But lately, things just
don't seem to be working out for him (first LIFE WITH MIKEY, and now
this?).  His character of concierge here is pretty much a nice guy--
but that's it.  He's extremely shallow in the movie, and isn't able to
give his character the gravity it so desperately needs.</P>
<P>     I didn't want to give this movie a bad review--I hate doing that
for *any* film.  But the disappointing fact is:  Bad movies often are
written, and cast, and filmed.  FOR LOVE OR MONEY should've stopped
on the first level, been trashed, and then rewritten until it could
make us care about it.</P>
<P>     What we have here is an excruciatingly unnecessary film.</P>
<P>CRITICAL RATING:  (1/2)*
Rated PG-13, for very mild Profanity -- Running Time:  1:33m</P>
