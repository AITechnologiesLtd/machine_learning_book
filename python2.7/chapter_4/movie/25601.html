<PRE>CHICKEN RUN</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>

<P>The chickens of Tweedy's farm are plotting an escape. They're tired of lives 
filled with nothing but laying as many eggs as possible or being sent to the 
chopping block. One courageous chicken, Ginger (Julia Sawalha), leads the 
group against the evil Mrs. Tweedy (The excellent Miranda Richardson) and 
the clueless Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth). What Ginger lacks in brilliant 
escape plans she makes up for in sheer determination. Unfortunately, Mrs. 
Tweedy has grown tired of the low income from selling eggs and has bought a 
massive pie making machine ("look at the size of that thing!" one character 
says in a nice little "Star Wars" homage). As Mrs. Tweedy says, "Chickens go 
in, pies come out." The chickens grow more and more desperate to escape, but 
all their plans seem to lead to Ginger being tossed in "the hole". Things 
are looking bleak until Rocky, the flying rooster (Mel Gibson), shows up. 
Ginger offers him sanctuary in return for him teaching all the chickens how 
to fly, so they can escape over the fence to freedom. Of course the one 
major problem with this plan is that chickens (and roosters) can't fly. This 
doesn't stop the group from trying, and what follows is a great claymation 
chicken version of "The Great Escape" (how's that for different?).</P>
<P>Okay, I know what everyone's thinking - how good can a goofy looking movie 
about claymation chickens possibly be? That's exactly what I was thinking 
walking into the theater. To say I was shocked by how much I enjoyed 
"Chicken Run" would be an understatement. I was completely bowled over by 
how much I loved this movie - with everything from the eccentric characters 
to the great soundtrack and voice-overs. The one and only complaint I had, 
and the only thing that kept the film from a full five star rating, was that 
Lord and Park (of "Wallace and Gromit" fame) allow the film to get a bit too 
cutesy at times. However, this is a minor complaint about an otherwise great 
movie. "Chicken Run" is the kind of movie Disney used to be able to make: a 
film with a perfect blend of childish humor and subtle jokes for the adults. 
These days Disney grants us movies like "Dinosaur" which look amazing but 
are aimed entirely at little ones. "Chicken Run" may not look amazing, since 
we've all seen claymation a thousand times over, but it's far more endearing 
than "Dinosaur" could ever have hoped to be.</P>
<P>The movie's strongest point is the host of delightfully bizarre characters 
(this was the strong point in "The Big Lebowski" too, and look what a great 
movie that was). Rocky could have been your typical heroic seeming phony, 
but those characters are usually all show on the outside and nothing on the 
inside. Rocky, on the other hand, is very little on the outside (he still 
acts like a chicken) and a lot on the inside. Gibson's voice-over is 
pleasant, but he doesn't add as much to his character as the English actors 
do to theirs. Julia Sawalha turns Ginger into a hilariously manic character, 
who always has a smile plastered to her face (actually, most of the chickens 
are always smiling) and spouts lines like, "We'll die free chickens, or 
we'll die trying!" The real standout performances (so to speak) come from 
two of the supporting cast members: Miranda Richardson ("Sleepy Hollow") as 
the evil Mrs. Tweedy, and Jane Horrocks ("Memphis Belle") as the hysterical 
chicken, Babs. Miranda Richardson, who I've always found to be a wonderful 
actress since I first saw her as Queen Elizabeth in the "Blackadder" British 
comedy series, isn't used as much as I would have liked in "Chicken Run", 
but she's delightful when present. Jane Horrocks' character, the overweight, 
flighty (pardon the pun), slightly neurotic Babs is uproariously funny. She 
has a grin constantly plastered to her face and a sewing kit stuck in her 
hands. She also gets some of the film's best lines like: "Me life flashed 
before me eyes... that was really boring."</P>
<P>I think one of the things I found so endearing about "Chicken Run" was that 
the characters may have acted like typical heroes at times, but they were 
still chickens at heart. Rocky may be all bravado in front of the chickens, 
but whenever a human comes close to him he starts screaming for Ginger to 
hide him. Another great scene like this is where one of the lead chickens 
tries to give her flock courage by saying, "The important thing is not to 
panic." The chickens immediately react by screeching and running around in 
circles. The film's other high points include a great, if slightly underused 
soundtrack; some delightfully over-the-top action sequences (watch for 
Ginger and Rocky's run in with the pie making machine); and more movie 
references than I could count ("Star Wars", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "The 
Great Escape" just to name a few). To top all this off, the movie runs only 
84 minutes in a time when movies running less than 120 are becoming scarce. 
I'd recommend "Chicken Run" to anyone who likes slightly childish comedies 
and give it a well earned four and a half out of five stars.</P>
