STARGATE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>According to many critics and movie aficionados, Dean Devlin
and Roland Emmerich are the worst thing that happened to
science fiction cinema in 1990s. This widespread animosity
towards Devlin-Emmerich duo can be partially explained with
the quality of their work in the past decade. However, the
real reason for such animosity lies less in the quality of
their movies and more in the massive hype that preceded them
and ensured huge disappointments among their future
audience. Taken by their own merit and without hype, those
films can be seen not only as passable, but also sometimes a
very good entertainment. One of such examples is STARGATE,
1994 science fiction spectacle by Roland Emmerich, often
heralded "the best science fiction film since STAR WARS".</P>
<P>The plot of this film begins in Egypt 1928 when the group of
Norwegian archaeologists digs out huge stone artefact with
strange, indecipherable hieroglyphs. Many decades later, the
artefact is in possession of US Air Force. Dr. Daniel
Jackson (played by James Spader), young and unconventional
Egyptologist, is called to decipher those hieroglyphs. To
the utter surprise of everybody, he manages to decipher
those symbols and finds that the artefact represents
Stargate - trandimensional portal that leads to distant
planet millions of light years away. US Air Force quickly
assembles expedition led by Colonel Jonathan "Jack" O'Neill
(played by Kurt Russell). This expedition enters Stargate
and finds itself on the desert world, populated by primitive
people that resemble ancient Egyptians and are ruled by god-
likes aliens led by evil Ra (played by Jaye Davidson).</P>
<P>All those who succumbed to hype in 1994 and expected another
masterpiece like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY have all the reasons
to feel disappointed. STARGATE could hardly be seen as an
example of creative geniuses at work. Director Emmerich and
Dean Devlin (who co-wrote the script) had wonderful idea, as
well as huge budget and numerous talents at their disposal.
Despite all of that the best they could do was space opera
filled with every possible cliche (including alien world
modelled on Earth's deserts, something which is more
expected in SF films with much lower budget) and numerous
plot holes. However, all those flaws can be forgiven for one
reason - unlike almost all the other SF films in 1990s,
STARGATE can induce the sense of wonder among the audience.
First part of the film manages to arouse viewers' curiosity
with the promises of strange new worlds on the Other Side.
Unlike most of the other science fiction films that use
genre only as an excuse to make standard horrors, dramas or
action films, STARGATE returns to the roots of science
fiction - pure adventure and tales of wondrous lost cities,
civilisations and continents. Resurrection of this more
innocent, almost infantile yet purer approach to the science
fiction is probably the most important legacy of STARGATE.</P>
<P>Lack of Devlin's and Emmerich's script-writing talents was
fortunately compensated with the talents among cast and
crew. James Spader is great as Lennon-like scientist, while
Russell makes represents great contrast to him as
no-nonsense military professional. Jaye Davidson, on the
other hand, wasn't very convincing as evil alien, although
he tried very hard to avoid typecasting after his memorable
CRYING GAME role. Production design, costumes and special
effects are superb and they all make the alien world very
convincing. Musical soundtrack by David Arnold is very good
and it features one of the rare 1990s film themes that
managed to stick in popular memory.</P>
<P>Finally, STARGATE had flaws yet it managed to overcome them
by being reincarnated in another medium. Being the basis for
awarded television series is just another reason why this
film shouldn't have the same reputation as its unjustifiably
criticised creators.</P>
