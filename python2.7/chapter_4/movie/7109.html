<P>     LOVE JONES won the 1997 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award.  
That in itself means little.  Consider, for example, that the 1996 
winner was THE SPITFIRE GRILL, one of the most manipulative films of the 
year.  Even so, it's difficult to envision this motion picture, a 
traditional romance with non-traditional characters and circumstances, 
as an award-winner.  It's enjoyable in an undemanding way, but it never 
takes any real risks, nor does it display much ambition.  As a result, 
LOVE JONES' victory probably says more about the "mainstreaming" of 
Sundance than it does about the film. </P>
<P>     It's an unfortunate trend in modern American movies that whenever a 
motion picture with a cast of African American actors is released, we 
expect it to feature violence, urban decay, and a heavy rap soundtrack.  
LOVE JONES, the feature debut of writer/director Theodore Witcher, 
offers none of these elements, which makes it something of a fresh 
experience.  Instead, this is a simple romance between two young, 
attractive, middle-class black characters who appreciate poetry and 
Charlie Parker music.  The film is entirely free of violence; there's 
not a gun or knife to be found.   </P>
<P>     The main characters are Darius Lovehall (Larenz Tate), a soulful 
poet with a roving eye, and Nina Mosley (Nia Long), a would-be 
photographer on the rebound from a long-term relationship.  He has only 
once been with a woman for more than six months; she's through with 
love, saying that it's "played out like an 8-track".  Needless to say, 
the two meet each other, sparks fly, and they end up in bed.  And, even 
though the truth is obvious to their friends and everyone in the 
audience, they assert that they're not in love, they're "just kickin' 
it".  So, when complications arise, as they must in any motion picture 
romance, the question (which in this sort of movie isn't that hard to 
answer) is whether their relationship can survive the stormy waters. </P>
<P>     There are several reasons why this film works better than the 
common, garden-variety love story.  To begin with, the setting and 
texture are much different than that of most mainstream romances.  The 
culture, in which post-college African Americans mingle while pursuing 
careers and relationships, represents a signficiant change from what 
we're used to.  The Sanctuary, the intimate Chicago nightclub where 
Darius and Nina meet, is rich in its eclectic, bluesy atmosphere.  And 
LOVE JONES' dialogue is rarely trite.  When the characters open their 
mouths, it usually because they have something intelligent to say, not 
because they're trying to fill up dead air with meaningless words.   </P>
<P>     Larenz Tate (DEAD PRESIDENTS) and Nia Long (BOYZ 'N THE HOOD) 
invest their portrayals with a great deal of energy.  The chemistry 
between Darius and Nina alternately sizzles and smolders, resulting in a 
relationship that varies from playful to hot.  While the romantic 
dynamic between these two is familiar, the performances add a refreshing 
dimension to the often-stale choreography of motion picture love 
affairs.  And, in a surprising move, while Witcher ends the film on an 
upbeat note, there's no "happily ever after" promise. </P>
<P>     The supporting cast is populated with colorful characters.  The 
most successful are Isaiah Washington's Savon Garrison and Bernadette L. 
Clarke's Sheila, both of whom seem like genuine people with legitimate 
personalities.  Less impressive are Bill Bellamy as Hollywood, a 
stereotypical ladies' man on the prowl, and Lisa Nicole Carson's Josie, 
who consistently strikes a false note.   </P>
<P>     The Sundance Audience Award notwithstanding, LOVE JONES isn't the 
kind of motion picture to inspire unqualified raves, nor is it likely to 
obscure the memory of SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT.  It runs a little too long 
for something so predictable, and sometimes the smart dialogue gets a 
little too clever.  Anyone who enjoys well-executed romances will find a 
lot to like about this film, but it lacks the strength of originality 
evident in those movies that inhabit the genre's top echelon.  LOVE 
JONES is a perfectly respectable entry into the late winter box office 
sweepstakes provided you don't take the Sundance pedigree too seriously. </P>
