<PRE>"Saving Silverman" </PRE>
<P>Darren (Jason Biggs), Wayne (Steve Zahn), and J.D. (Jack Black) have been 
best friends since the fifth grade. Like the Three Musketeers, they've been 
together through thick and thin. But, when Darren meets an attractive, but 
cold-blooded and manipulative, psychiatrist, Judith (Amanda Peet), the long 
time friendship is placed in danger. It's up to Wayne and J.D. to rescue 
their best friend in "Saving Silverman." </P>
<P>"Silverman" has its heart in the right place, but the story, by newcomers 
Hank Nelken and Greg DePaul, is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the 
battle for Darren's soul. Based on their experience of a friend making a 
major marital mistake, the story is centered on the three, life long 
amigos. When Wayne introduces Darren to Judith, he doesn't realize that he 
has opened a Pandora's box of disaster for himself and J.D. Judith was once 
in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died 
in a kick boxing match. Since then, she has sought a new mate - someone she 
can boss around and mold into her own vision. Enter Darren Silverman. </P>
<P>Once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement, Wayne and J.D. 
try everything they can, including threats and bribery, to get Judith to 
free Darren. Nothing works until the duo come up with a plan - kidnap 
Judith and get Darren back together with the girl he called his one and 
only, pretty Sandy Perkus (Amanda Detmer). The only problem here is that 
Sandy is about to take her vows to become a nun. Things spiral out of 
control as Judith repeatedly attempts to escape while Wayne and J.D. play 
cupid. The boys even bring their idol, Neil Diamond, into the picture to 
help resolve things. </P>
<P>Thinking about it, this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence 
that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of Steve Zahn and Jack 
Black. The pair is able to elicit the film's only laughs with their goofy 
antics and child-like behavior. They are relegated to providing slapstick 
guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task. Steve Zahn has been 
steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to 
Wayne, the "brains" of the gang. Jack Black has the big-guy moves of a 
Chris Farley, giving J.D. an amusing physical presence. The neat thing is 
that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material. </P>
<P>The rest of the cast doesn't fare as well, though. Jason Biggs is the 
straight man of the Musketeers and gets very little to do; though having 
watched his previous films ("American Pie" and "Loser") I'm not sure what 
attraction Biggs actually has. Amanda Peet is caustic as the manipulative 
Judith. There is no humanity at all to her character as she single-mindedly 
strives to recreate Darren into her mind's image. She's a monster that 
Wayne and J.D. must defeat to save their friend. Unfortunately, there is no 
dimension to her character. Amanda Detmer brings nothing (or gets nothing) 
as Darren's one and only. R. Lee Ermey, as the psychotic Coach, made a bad 
decision taking this role. Tune-meister Neil Diamond gives a good-natured 
cameo perf as the boys' idol and savior. </P>
<P>Production values are on par with the rest of the film - lackluster and 
non-involving. Director Dennis Dugan has a track record for broad comedy 
with films like "Big Daddy" and "Beverly Hills Ninja," but falls flat with 
"Saving Silverman." </P>
<P>The 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with a "good" film to sink our 
teeth into. At least, with "Saving Silverman," we get a couple of funny 
perfs from Zahn and Black. Too bad that the rest of the film lacks their 
level of humor. Kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings 
of a good comedy. I give it a C-. </P>
