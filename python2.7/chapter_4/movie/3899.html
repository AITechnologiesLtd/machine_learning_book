<PRE>                             OPERATION DUMBO DROP
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     OPERATION DUMBO DROP is "5 tons of Disney fun," at least according
to the ads.  It is a doubly strange movie "inspired by a true story."
First, the tale itself is quite bizarre involving procuring an elephant
during a war and moving it by all possible means including by
parachute.  Second, it is strange for anyone, but especially for
Disney, to turn a Vietnam war story into kids fare.  I would have never
thought of a movie containing VCs lobbing mortars at an innocent
elephant as being a movie suitable for kids.  Nevertheless, the
trailers got my son excited to see it, and I am willing to try anything
except slasher movies so off we went.</P>
<P>     Green Beret officer Jim Morris (Ray Liotta) and an Army Captain
played by Danny Glover manage to get the only elephant in a Vietnamese
village shot by the VC in retaliation for the village having helped the
Americans.  Since the Americans need the village, they agree to find
another elephant for it.  They turn to a procurement officer played by
Denis Leary in a role lifted out of CATCH 22.  Leary finds an elephant
along with a boy (Dinh Thien Le) who is the elephant's young trainer
and companion.  The Americans make a package deal of the elephant and
the boy, but they are on a tight schedule to get the elephant to the
village as promised in time for a key festival.  To get him there they
use all possible means of transportation and in turn get shot at with a
complete selection of weaponry - mortars, rifles, surface-to-air
missiles, you name it.</P>
<P>     There is one point in the movie where they say to each other, "you
guys look like McHale's Navy".  It was at that point the central
problem of the movie was clear.  This was "McHale's Navy," but without
humor.  Although there were crazy situations in the movie, most of the
humor fell flat with only the Glover and Liotta smiling to remind you
that it was supposed to be funny.  The script by Gene Quintano (of
POLICE ACADEMY 3 and 4 fame), was boring.  The director (Simon Wincer),
who also did FREE WILLY, for some reason had the actors play the scenes
very low key and reserved as if he was trying to be reverential to the
war that killed so many.  All of this made for a slow, tedious, and
almost serious, movie that was a putative comedy.  All of the actors
seemed to be on autopilot and were there only to collect their fees.</P>
<P>     The violence was handled gingerly.  When the Americans and the VC
met, the Americans would yank the guns out the enemy's hands and then
just hit them with their fists or with gun butts only hard enough to
knock them out.  Nevertheless, this was a war and exploding bombs,
bullets, and missiles meant to kill the Americans can be scary to
children.</P>
<P>     OPERATION DUMBO DROP runs 1:48 which is too long and too slow.  It
is incorrectly rated PG.  Given the realistic bombs and bullets flying
everywhere, it should have been PG-13.  Be careful if your child is
sensitive to violence.  My son Jeffrey (age 6) gave the movie a thumbs
up and a thumbs down he said with the thumbs down being for all of the
frightening bombing.  I do not recommend this show to you mainly
because it is so boring.  I award it a single star for a great visual
when the elephant makes his drop from the sky.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
