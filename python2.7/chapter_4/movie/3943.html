<PRE>                                 BEYOND RANGOON
                        A film review by Christopher Null
                         Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     BEYOND RANGOON is absolutely typical of the way Hollywood can take a
compelling story, full of genuine characters and heartfelt emotion, then
hack it to tiny bits and put it back together, Frankenstein-like, into a
sappy, overwrought drama that is without a soul and without a point.</P>
<P>     The story is "based on actual events."  Patricia Arquette plays Laura,
an American doctor trying to find peace after the brutal murder of her
husband and son.  With her sister (Frances McDormand), they embark on a tour
of the exotic East, including a peaceful stopover in Burma, a war-torn
country ruled by military dictatorship (As they say, "In Burma, *everything*
is illegal.).  Laura's passport is lifted, and she finds herself trapped in
the capital city of Rangoon, while her sister and their tour group head off
to Bangkok.  The Burmese pick that time to revolt, and Laura finds herself
caught up in a civil war, which basically amounts to dodging bullets in the
jungle while covered in mud.</P>
<P>     Laura may have a medical degree, but she's also got the common sense of
a stick.  Any sensible person would have avoided this situation altogether.
When she can't sleep...she heads down to check out how the local
revolutionary rally is going, violating curfew.  When she loses her passport
and martial law is declared...she decides to leave Rangoon and sightsee in
the country--to hell with the law!  When her tour guide (U Aung Ko) doubts
they can get back to the city in time...she responds, "Let's risk it!"  In
the end, she gets what she deserves.  After all, she went to *Burma* didn't
she?</P>
<P>     It's hard to feel sorry for someone that acts so stupid, so often.  And
despite the constant threat of capture by the enemy, BEYOND RANGOON is
actually pretty boring.  Director John Boorman is much more concerned with
Laura's brooding over her dead son than with anything else.  Of course, this
is all part of the film's master plan: Toy with the viewers' emotions to the
point that they can't feel anything but horror when seeing the terrible
crimes of the Burmese.  If Laura wasn't such an idiot, that might have
worked.</P>
<P>     Another disappointment is the wholesale ripping off of THE KILLING
FIELDS, the Academy Award-winning film about a Cambodian refugee trying to
escape the Khmer Rouge during the Vietnam War.  THE KILLING FIELDS is one of
the best "on the run" pictures ever made, and BEYOND RANGOON borrows heavily
from it, even to the extent of casting Spalding Gray in a minor role.
Unfortunately, BEYOND RANGOON borrows bits and pieces, and can't replicate
the film's spirit.</P>
<P>     BEYOND RANGOON gets some points for at least having a noble premise,
which is a pleasant change from typical Hollywood fare.  U Aung Ko's tour
guide/revolutionary is very engaging, too, and almost makes the picture
worthwhile.  One thing still bugs me, though, and it's got nothing to do
with the sappy plot and hokey ending.  I keep wondering, just how much
numbingly repetitious, fluty woodwind music can one person stand, and where
was Zanfir hiding during the takes?</P>
