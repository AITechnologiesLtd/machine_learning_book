<PRE>Psycho
by Wallace Baine
Santa Cruz Sentinel film writer</PRE>
<P>Alfred Hitchcock makes his obligatory cameo appearance in the original
`Psycho' early on in the movie. From inside a storefront office, we see
Hitchcock's unmistakable profile standing on the sidewalk outside, waiting
for a cab perhaps, his face turned away.
Gus Van Sant's absurdly obedient remake contains the same shot. But the
difference is telling. Van Sant doesn't merely take Hitchcock's place, to
wait for his own cab. Here, from the same office and from the same angle,
we see two men instead of one: Gus Van Sant, facing us, chatting amiably
with the same melon-shaped figure we briefly glanced the first time.
There is a point at which admiration bleeds over into adoration and because
Van Sant has so clearly crossed that line, Alfred Hitchcock is afforded a
uniquely bizarre media-age tribute. His movies aren't being re-invented;
they're being cloned. This new `Pyscho' is less a remake than the most
hyped karoake act in history. Its only distinguishing feature is color
film. Other than that, it's the same movie.
Of course, Van Sant is making no apologies. Enlisting the help of
Hitchcock's widow Pat, who appeared in the original, Van Sant worked from
Joseph Stefano's 1960 script and, in fact, used freeze frames from
Hitchcock's film to make his own. Stud film composer Danny Elfman pulled a
similarly monkey-see-monkey-do act on Bernard Herrman's original
screeching-violins score.
The result is a film that draws attention to its anachronisms. Corny
cinematic techniques common in the age of black-and-white -- echo-chamber
interior dialogue, swirling, fake-looking backdrops -- are kept intact.
Though Van Sant makes a point to make his story contemporary (the date in
the opening shot is Dec. 11, 1998, 2:43 p.m.), there are certain aspects,
namely the throwback wardrobes, that make the setting in time delightfully
ambiguous. Is there, for example, in this day and age, an office in
Phoenix, Arizona without air conditioning?
The acting, however, is thoroughly contemporary. Anne Heche who plays the
doomed Marion Crane is much more nuanced and world-weary than Janet Leigh
in the original. In the film's first scene, when Marion is getting dressed
in a by-the-hour hotel after a session of lovemaking with her lover Sam
(Viggo Mortensen), she delivers the same line Leigh had done 40 years
earlier: `I'll lick the stamps,' except that this time Sam in standing near
the window nude and Heche's eyes slide daringly below his waist.
I would have liked to see more of that kind of ironic script
re-interpretation. But from that point on, the film mostly stays earnestly
true to the original. Julianne Moore, who plays the Vera Miles role as
Marion's worried sister, carries a distinct post-feminist aggressiveness
which goes along fine with the Walkman headphones draped around her neck.
But William H. Macy, in the Martin Balsam role of the private investigator,
has the practiced look of a 1950s film-noir gumshoe.
To those who have never seen the original `Psycho' -- and you have to
believe that even a significant number of people who've come of age in the
`Scream' generation have seen it on video -- Vince Vaughn might make a
compelling Norman Bates. But in a film that all but begs comparison with
the original, Vaughn pales next to Tony Perkins. The significance of
Hitchcock's `Psycho' is that it was one of the first horror films to
suggest that monsters can indeed hide in amiable, clean-cut, mother-loving
nice guys. Perkins, with his Eddie Haskell grin and bright-eyed
attentiveness, was the perfect embodiment of that idea.
These days, however, such an image and the psychological theories of split
personalities that underly it are old news, hardly shocking even to
fourth-graders. We live in O.J.'s America, after all. Norman Bates can't
surprise us anymore.
Which is my problem with Vince Vaughn, a solid actor who for all his gifts
can't mask the fact that he could be a wacko. We are much more skeptical as
filmgoers these days to buy Vaughn as Bates. It would be more surprising if
Vaughn's Bates turned out to be an innocent guy.
Taken on its own merits, Van Sant's `Psycho' is a stylish, attractive
remake. You can't quibble with a movie so tight in plot and
characterization. But in context, watching this `Psycho' is a weird
experience. To anyone familiar with Hitch's movie, it is nigh near
impossible to lose yourself in the story of a young woman in trouble who
meets a brutal end by a chance encounter at a seedy hotel. You won't be
paying attention to the story of Marion Crane. You'll be paying attention
to how Anne Heche is playing Marion Crane and that uses a different set of
esthetic muscles. Gus Van Sant makes the assumption that most movie-goers
watch films with the same corrupted technical eye of the would-be director.
He does nothing to help us suspend that disbelief.</P>
