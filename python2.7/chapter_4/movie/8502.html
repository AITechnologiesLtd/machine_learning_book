<PRE>                              CONSPIRACY THEORY</PRE>
<P>Rating: 6.0 and $5.50
Plot teaser: Jerry Fletcher (Mel Gibson) analyzes various government
conspiracies.</P>
<PRE>    What a strange, strange movie.</PRE>
<P>    This movie kept reminding me of the style of A Clockwork Orange,
without the perversions.</P>
<P>    The two principal actors, Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts, performed very
well in their roles.  The other players gave spotty portrayals, but none
that were lacking enough to be considered outright bad.</P>
<P>    My big gripe is with the soundtrack.  Everytime I heard the music, I
wondered how it was supposed to fit into the movie.  It sounded like the
soundtrack of a cartoon.  Am I supposed to take Fletcher as a serious
portrayal of a bizarre man?  Or am I supposed to just dismiss him
out-of-hand as an overacted stereotype of a fruitcake, as the music
suggests?  I tried to ignore the background music and concentrate on the
story.  It was a decidedly uphill battle.</P>
<P>    And speaking of the story...  I wouldn't say it was unbelievable, just
that the choice of topics for the movie was too "quaint" and didn't flow
in an even pattern.  The plot tosses the audience hither and yon, and
often causes a viewer to lose focus.  But I'm bordering on spoilers, and I
hate spoilers in reviews. </P>
<P>    Go see it on a matinee.  It's worth watching, even if it just dazes
you with its oddity.</P>
<P><HR>My #1 rule in reviewing is: NO SPOILERS.  Instead of discussing the
plot, I choose instead to discuss performances, believability,
entertainment value, etc.  If you want the plot, see the movie.</P>
<P>I give two ratings: An arbitrary scale of enjoyability (1 to 10) and
a maximum price I would pay to see the movie.<HR></P>
