But I'm a Cheerleader!</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>In the over-stereotyped, suburban American, 1950's life-style, Megan is a
cheerleader who doesn't enjoy kissing her handsome jock boyfriend. The
camera peeps in through the windshield as these two make out in the car: the
boyfriend's tongue flopping around like the tail of some decked fish, while
Megan's eyes, wide open and fluttering in all directions, search for
something interesting to take her mind off what her mouth is doing. It's
hilarious.</P>
<P>Soon enough, her God-fearing, homophobic parents, confront her with their
scariest suspicions, "Our daughter's a lesbian!"</P>
<P>An obedient child and by now quite confused, Megan agrees to board at a
countryside "Heterosexual School" with a newly recruited small group of teen
lesbians and gay boys that are in for a "Mr. and Mrs. Cleaver" lesson in how
to be straight. Guys are taught to work on car engines and girls in pink,
learn to scrub stains from burnt pots and pans. And though this
simplistic/comedic angle on the gay issue has been played powerless already,
the edgy dialogue keeps the film fresh, lively and light.</P>
<P>On the phone to her parents, Megan reports, "You were right, I am a
homosexual, but I'll be regular soon." Then in defending her favorite
pastime she says to Graham (the tomboy dorm mate she is trying not to find
attractive), "Okay, maybe cheers aren't intellectual, but they make people
feel good." Graham snaps back, "No, cheers make people do stupid cartwheels,
orgasms make people feel good!" Kudos to the acting talent of both Natasha
Lyonne and Clea DuVall.</P>
<P>The art directors have painted each room of this large country house its own
special color, with an exterior of pink giving the whole scenario a
purposefully ridiculousness, cartoony feel. However, the music,
intentionally rinky-dink, adds little.</P>
<P>Though surreal and silly, the film is not afraid to say or do the taboo, so,
if girls kissing each other on the lips makes you squint your eyes and feel
nauseous then you ought to be forewarned. In fact, these scenes are done
tenderly.</P>
<P>The look of the film is somewhat over-exposed and technically just barely
short of the mark with an embarrassingly poorly cut scene just prior to the
climax. Still, it's wacky fun, and spiced with loose lips and one-liners
that'll more often than not crack up the crowd.</P>
