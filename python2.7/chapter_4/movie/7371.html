<PRE>                                   VOLCANO
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>>From the opening moment, when the titles appear on the screen, the
eerie sounds of a building about to collapse, of columns and steel
supports beginning to crack, envelope the theater.  This sound special
effect sets the films tone and stays with us all through the film.
Good thing, too, because the story is the usual nothing as in almost
all films about disasters.</P>
<P>Los Angeles, with its wonderful weather and laid back life style, is
often the envy of the rest of the country.  Those who envy us and who
are turned on when they read of forest fires in our mountains, followed
by rain and floods, and who may get a vicarious thrill reading about
our latest earthquake, should delight in this new disaster Hollywood
has imagined, a volcano whose lava (as hot as 2000 degrees  Centigrade)
instantly melts even steel buildings that it envelops.  Welcome to
L.A.</P>
<P>Los Angeles has a world-famous site, located next to our County Museum
of Art. It is the La Brea Tar Pits.  (A misnomer, since ""brea" means
"tar." in Spanish.) At the tar pits, one can see a small lake (or large
pool) of oil and tar that still bubble to the surface.  Many
prehistoric parts of mastodons have been unearthed In the film this is
where the volcano erupts, sending hot lava geysers into the air, and
shooting "lava bombs" weighing as much as two tons into the air to
descend on a building or neighborhood instantly destroying it.</P>
<P>Los Angeles has an Emergency Dept headed by Mike Roark (Tommy Lee
Jones). When all hell breaks loose with the volcano threatening to
destroy much of Los Angeles, it is Mike's job to minimize the
destruction and to save as many lives as possible.  They could not
have picked a better person than Mike.  He is cool under stress,
knowledgeable, daring and dependable.  He is ably assisted in this
new unprecedented disaster which no one had anticipated by Lt. Ed Fox,
(Keith David), the Fire Chief.</P>
<P>Mike has a teenaged daughter, Kelly (Gaby Hoffmann) .  He also has
as a good friend and more, Dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche), a seismologist,
who also helps in planning what to do about the disaster.  Emmit Reese
(Don Cheadle) is Roark's assistant.who mans the control center while
Roark is out in the field battling the lava flow.  Some 50 local
media people play themselves.</P>
<P>The Special Effects are outstanding: the fires, the lava bombs, the
boiling lava flowing down the city streets.  The story (such as it is)
includes Roark's daughter, Kelly, being in a building that is about to
be blown up to block the path of the lava so that it will detour toward
the ocean.  Having seen enough movies to know that Kelly will escape
unharmed, I was nevertheless wishing she would hurry up and get out of
the building before it descended on her.</P>
<P>Happily, the film shows that when people are faced with something
horrendous, a common enemy, they bond together, forgetting nonsense
such as race, religion, and ethnicity.  This is brought out nicely
when a little boy has lost his mother. When asked to look at a crowd
and see if he can point her out, he says "I can't. Everyone looks
alike."  And indeed they do, tired, covered with soot and ash.</P>
<P>Disaster films seem to be the vogue at the moment.  As Screenwriter
Jerome D Armstrong tells it, ten, twenty years ago, disaster films
were about mechanical failures such as in The Poseidon Adventure, The
Towering Inferno, and Westworld. Here we are dealing with a natural
disaster for which we are unprepared and must learn to deal with it
quickly.</P>
<P>My personal problem was that I was sitting in a theater about 5 - 10
minutes from where the film's disasters were being portrayed and so I
could not get really caught up.  Out-of-Towners should not have that
same experience.  It will get their blood flowing.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Mike Jackson.</PRE>
<P>Screenplay by Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray from a story by Armstrong.</P>
