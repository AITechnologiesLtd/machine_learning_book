<PRE>                       APT PUPIL (United States)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: A boy fascinated by the Holocaust finds a fugitive war
criminal living in his neighborhood.  What follows is a battle for
power of each over the other.  The theme of the Holocaust seems
misused.  Good performance from Ian McKellan (so what else is new?).
Rating:  6 (0 to 10), 1 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Directed by Bryan Singer though APT PUPIL is not nearly as good as
     his THE USUAL SUSPECTS.
   - Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is fascinated by the Holocaust and has
     memorized pictures of all the principles so he recognizes Kurt
     Dussander "the Butcher of Treblinka" (Ian McKellan) when he sees
     him on a cross-town bus.  With photographs and fingerprints he
     gets evidence that this Arthur Denker really is the Kurt Dussander
     whom he thinks he has found, then follows a game of power between
     the two.  Initially Todd just wants to hear an eyewitness account.
     But the game between the two becomes more serious.
   - We never find out why Todd is so interested or what his point of
     view is.  In the final analysis APT PUPIL has little to do with
     the Holocaust.  It is just there as an excuse why Todd knows
     something that had can blackmail Denker with.  In fact, it ruins
     some of the credibility.  Denker tries to blackmail Todd by
     threatening going public.  A war criminal would never do that.
   - Some shocking scenes where Todd uses Denker as a puppet.
   - Todd wants to understand the Holocaust better than he can from
     books but  the script does not have anything for Dussander to
     reveal about the Holocaust that is not already common knowledge.
   - When Todd's grades suffer, the guidance counselor makes an offer
     to Todd that no high school would ever offer.  It is convenient
     for the plot, but makes no sense.
   - Denker is fighting to defend a meaningless existence of drinking
     whiskey and watching cartoons.
   - It was not six million people killed in the Holocaust, it was six
     million *Jews*.  There were ten to twelve million *people* killed.
     And a pie graph on the board seems to show only about a third
     where it was really a much higher proportion.
   - A simple documentary about the Holocaust like "Night and Fog" is
     far more chilling than anything that Singer managed to get on the
     screen.  What is a single murder next to ten million murders?</P>
