<PRE>                             AMERICAN PIMP
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<PRE>     "If I let her take half, or a 60/40 cut, I'm not gonna be able to
give her all my pimpin'!"</PRE>
<P>     Such is only one of hundreds of truly great lines in AMERICAN PIMP,
the rather self-explanatory documentary from the Hughes brothers (MENACE
II SOCIETY, DEAD PRESIDENTS).  As a documentary, PIMP displays uncommon
humor, as its over-the-top subjects probably don't realize they're being
mocked, preferring instead to bask in the limelight of the movie being
made about them.</P>
<P>     As expected, these guys are utter jokes, as are their "hos."
Everything you may suspect about the pimp trade, as it turns out, is
absolutely true.  They wear gold jackets with 'gator skin shoes.  They
drive Rolls Royces.  They treat their employees very badly, and they
keep all the money.</P>
<P>     As such, there's not a lot of insight into "pimpology," as all the
stereotypes are validated.  To be sure, the tales of Rosebudd, Fillmore
Slim, and Too $hort (among others) are worth the price of admission for
their entertainment value, but this is the same ground covered in HBO's
"Pimps Up, Ho's Down" last year.  (Also of note: the HBO documentary was
widely trashed as being phony: Not so.)</P>
<P>     Still, it's amazing the Hughes brothers got these stories out of
these characters.  Intercutting the film with classic 1930's-1990's
blaxploitation films and TV shows is pure genius and offers some of the
best moments in AMERICAN PIMP.  Like they say, it's all Mack.</P>
