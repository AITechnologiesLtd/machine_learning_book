<PRE>               THE ENGLISH PATIENT [1996]</PRE>
<P>   A RETRO REVIEW BY: RICHARD MATICH
 I was in the local puplic library near my home. The
librarian [an older woman] and I were disscusing the
films we had liked in 1996. I said that this movie, The
English Patient, was both beutiful, epic, and told in a
very different way than the standard "flicks" sold by
the greedy studios. She said that she thought it to be
a bore. A Bore?! I, to this day, can't believe that a
woman would not find this great and romantic story at
least half as compelling as a man like me [a hardnosed
critic] would. Director Anthony Minghella took what was
a very long and "difficult" novel and made sense of it
for the screen. It is wrapped in lush tan hues with
grand desert and skyscapes by cinematographer John
Seale. If thats not enough, veteran sound and film
editor Walter Murch [Apocolypse Now, American Graffiti,
and The GodFather Part II] took to chopping the complex
story into a "non-linear" format. He and his team then
did the hard job of  making every little noise clean
and clear instead of just trying to split audience's
ear drums the way some movie sound is done these days.
Decible levels in movie houses have risen sharply [some
would say dangerously] in recent years. Ralph Fiennes
plays a pilot who is shot down and badly burned. He is
then cared for by a nurse played by Juliette Binoche.
Her life is in turmoil because she keeps losing to
early death every person she has loved dearly. Miss
Binoche makes an audience care for her gentle nurse
while she makes her nurse the most giving person in
almost all of film history. That brings the audience a
very complex and pleasing performance. She stays behind
from her convoy of medical team and patients to care
for this English patient. This mystery man, who keeps
bringing up his own past haunted by tragic loss.
Kristen Scott Thomas has the role of the woman that
ignites a passionate, tored affair with this Englishman
before his burns. Thomas has a screen presence
harkening back to the old studio glamour days of the
30's and 40's, when the studios wanted women to be
"overly stunning" so as to sell a picture to house
wives, secretaries, etc. She does not quite have the
power to keep viewers under her spell the way Garbo or
Crawford did in their heyday, yet she is still very
close. The film has you wanting to know more secrets
right up to the now famous tragic end. Ladies grab your
Kleenex, because The English Patient might just leave
you in tears. Unless you happen to work at the library!
"Promiss me you'll come back for me.-Thomas. "I
promiss. I'll come back for you. I promiss. I'll never
leave you."- The English Patient.</P>
