<P>SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISHER is the story of Josh Waitzkin, a young man who
has an ability to play chess that draws some comparisons to the Grand Master
Bobby Fisher.  Where Bobby Fisher was known to be an eccentric, that
disliked the circles of the chess playing community, the young Waitzkin has
all the makings of another man that will  play chess forever, and become
either a good player with all the trappings for failure, or a good player,
who is also a good person behind it all.  This is what the film is really
about.</P>
<P>The young Josh, gets the inclination to play chess in his young days, and
sets out to learn the game on his own.  And at a certain point, he decides
he wants to check out the chess bums in the park, who seem to have a daily
thing going for a few dollars. Josh takes a liking to Vinnie, a black young
man who may be  a good player, but does not have the upbringing to take his
game to another level.  But what Vinnie lacks in upbringing, he has in his
ability to play like a cat... he is quick, and he is
clever, and he knows how to set up an opponent, something which the streets
of Brooklyn are surely full of.</P>
<P>In due time, Josh's father decided to take the young man Josh to a chess
school and get him some instruction on the game, perhaps a chance to get
better.  In the school he meets some of the well known chess players in the
world, and the teacher first shows his disdain for the inner discipline that
many of them lack.  The young man Josh now has to come to grips with
something which is difficult to do for him, which is to project far enough
ahead in order to play a better game, something which people his age do not
do.</P>
<P>Eventually, the young Josh starts playing tournaments, but he lacks the
killer instinct that is sometimes necessary in order to survive these
slaughter houses.  He plays well, but he has found the closest thing to an
enemy, which he is afraid to  face.  His deliberations take him back to the
park for some fun chess ( for him ) and back to the teacher, who is not very
happy with the young man's forays into the area where chess is not an art,
but just a game.</P>
<P>During this time, the Josh's family begins having a few problems. The well
meaning father, has accidentally drawn up plans for his genius son.  But the
mother is concerned that the child is missing out on his childhood.  And
this battle has an effect on the young man who is just trying to play to
indulge his ability to think, and have some fun with it. And in the final
tournament, in Chicago, Josh comes to meet his nemesis for the first time.
He is a rich kid, that has been supported by an older line of chess players,
and his style is dry, and quiet, and just play on... ruthlessly.  But the
kid does not know how to enjoy the game.  Josh finds himself trapped, and
loses a major piece.  Vinnie immediately states that Josh is setting him up,
much to the chagrin of the instructor who does not like games.  And when all
seems lost, Josh finally sees that he has got his opponent where he wants
him, even if it isn't true.  The young man does not know how to lose and
challenges Josh to continue.  And the real battle really begins, and Josh
finally traps the king. Before this, Josh had offered a draw, because he
knew that he could trap his opponent, who was good at set games, but not
very good at free play... or at playing the style which the parks in
Brooklyn had taught him.</P>
<P>A fabulously well directed film, with one outstanding factor that is
immediately visible.  The film is shot, in its entirety, with single lights
for highlight, and also a very real effect. It has shadows ( like every
corner of your house and room ) and the camera deals with it.  It adds a lot
of suspense, and thinking to any shot, and helps isolate each character in
their own little world.  The concept is not new.  It is very old, and the
one that we live with everyday.  But it is rarely used in many American
films whose tradition is steeped by the television styles, which is overly
lit, and is not real.  It makes for a moody film, but in this case, it is
not a brooding film, but one that tries to help us define that little space,
where the character sits, or stands.  CONRAD L HALL's vision is now clear,
and set. And the director Zaillian knew how to work with it.  The concept
was well thought out previously, and Mr. Zaillian must have been well aware
of the way this film needed to be shot.  ( See the film VISIONS OF LIGHT for
Conrad's discussions on his use of lighting..  or lack of. )</P>
<P>This film is very well cast, and Ben Kingsley is very good.  But the
character most interesting to watch, is Lawrence Fishburne playing Vinnie,
in a role where he can be his street person, and street smart.  It helps the
kid grow up, but it also helps him be a kid, because it is fun.  This is
always in contrast to the brooding, and very serious chess teacher.  Vinnie
never touches a chess piece indoors, and Bruce never touches one piece
outdoors. And Josh becomes the best of both worlds, because he mixes the
two.</P>
<P>A very well done film, with a very nice little story line that goes beyond
the world of chess.  Josh has another little friend, and he takes him aside
towards the end.  He may lose a chess game, but he still has a friend to
play with, and that is more important. The ending line, with his little
friend, is so very satisfying, and one of the reasons which makes this film
so pleasing to anyone, chess fans or not.  A great kid story.  And a real
nice look at an outcast from the chess world, which Bobby Fisher is.   More
of a  renegade against a stuck up system than anything else is the point
that the film seems to wish to make.</P>
<P>Worth seeing, and with some electrifying performances, and moments of very
nice tension.  Few film directors can draw up such a well done piece of
work, but it may have been the eye of the cinematographer that made this
film the excellent piece of work that it is.  Right from the start.</P>
