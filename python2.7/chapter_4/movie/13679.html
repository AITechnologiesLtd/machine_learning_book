<P>     For the last couple of weeks, I have been bombarded with a pile of
very lyrical and moving reviews of Steven Spielberg's realistic war-tale,
Saving Private Ryan.  The reviews themselves were as moving as any film
I'd seen, telling me that this was a film about war and humanity and the
like, the greatest American War Film ever, the best American film of the
last 10 years, one after another I read them.  My local newspaper even
went so far as to give the film five stars out of four.  I had to see this
film and I had to see it soon.
     The opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan is one of the most
harrowing, accurate (from what survivors have said in print and on TV)
brutal, wet, muddy, desperate, bloody, tense scenes in the history of
American Cinema.  For those expecting the kind of scenes that made John
Wayne a star, you are in for a shock.  There is no trumpet-blowing and
flag waving to be found as German machine guns rip the landing American
soldiers to shreds, over and over for about 30minutes.  The camera sits
the audience right in the middle, there is no omnipotent camera in this
sequence, you see and hear exactly what the soldiers see and hear, and it
causes you to want to duck as the bullets whiz passed your head and clang
off of helmets and bone.  It's a very remarkable picture of war at its
most brutal...and honest.
     This scene introduces us to Capt. John Miller and his squad of
rangers as they slowly push onto the beach.  Hanks as Miller avoids
melodrama and cliche and just does his duty, sending men to their deaths
again and again until the objective is accomplished.  Hanks leads the
strong Ensemble cast that includes Tom Sizemore as Sgt. Horvath,  (Heart
and Souls, The Relic, Heat) Edward Burns (Brothers McMullen, She's The
One) as the vocal Pvt. Reiben, Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting, Rainmaker)
as Pvt. Ryan, and Jeremy Davies (Nell, Spanking The Monkey) as map-maker
turned squad interpreter, Corporal Upham. 
     After surviving Omaha, a clerk discovers that three of the four Ryan
brothers are dead, and a fourth has just parachuted into Normandy with the
101st Airborne.  General George C. Marshall (played with gruff elegance
by Harve Presnell) decides that in order to avoid not only a PR disaster,
but another heartbroken mother (the Sullivan brothers were all killed when
the ship they were all one was destroyed) he wants a squad to find Pvt.
Ryan and bring him back home.  Miller gets to pick his best men for the
job and head to where Ryan was to have landed.  On the way they bicker
among themselves as to whether this is all worth it, and is it worth
giving their lives to save one man?  Miller insists that it's their
mission and they must follow orders.  Can he keep his squad together for
this seemingly unimportant mission?
     Overall, the film is a start, realistic picture of war, but I have to
say that overall I was a bit disappointed.  While I'm sure this will make
me unpopular with some, I have to be honest.  The main purpose of the film
seemed to be to make a realistic war film.  On this level, Spielberg and
Co. succeeded.  However, realism doesn't make great cinema.  The plot and
characters more and more fall a distant second to the realism of the
images and sounds.  I found myself less and less interested in the
characters and more and more interested in the cinematography and details
of the costumes and such.  A truly great film doesn't allow you to be
distracted by the individual parts that make it great.  I didn't sit
through L.A. Confidential marvelling at the fact that the guns and ammo
were really the ones the LAPD used in the 50s. I was more interested in
the characters.  Saving Private Ryan failed to keep me enthralled with the
characters.  
     There was a great opportunity to explore a variety of themes that
were ever-so-slightly touched on in the film, but only barely.  I wanted
to be swept up in the conflict that arises when decent humane people are
forced to be in an inhumane environment and expected to survive.  Hanks'
character embodied this very theme, but he wasn't allowed to do much with
it.  I wanted to be moved by the cameraderie between fellow soldiers, but
this is just taken for granted, we're all brothers, they just say it,
their actions rarely speak for themselves.  Spielberg obviously took a lot
of care to avoid the cliches and flag-waving of earlier films, but he
failed to make this something that Americans can relate to.  It is
entirely possible to make people feel emotionally patriotic without
resorting to cliches and manipulative imagery and music and dialogue.
When I say emotional, I only mean that the audience needs to feel a
kinship with the characters, and when characters and audience come from
such different backgrounds/eras the only thing you can do is relate to the
things that are the same in everyone, humanity, and in the case of
American audiences, the country we live in.  I found it hard to relate,
and that's what was missing in this film.  Even though the camera sets you
right in the middle of the action, it's only your eyes and ears, and not
your heart that is into it.  They just went a step too far in setting the
parameters for the film and I was very disappointed because of that.
     The opening and closing scenes of the film, with the d-day veteran (I
won't say who) visiting the graves of his fallen comrades in France in the
present were far more moving than any other part of the film.  He looks at
the crosses and says with his face "why me? Why did I survive?" It was
that humanity that the rest of the film lacked, that emotion.  Perhaps
Spileberg and Co. wanted there to be emotional detachment, the same
detachment Miller has as he sends wave after wave of his troops to be
slaughtered.  If that was the case, the film was successful, but not
engaging.
     The technical aspects of the film are of course all top-notch.  The
Cinematography by Janusz Kaminski (Jerry Maguire, Lost World, Amistad) is
at times incredible, a real achievment.  The colors, textures, and scenes
are consistently stunning.  The musical score by John Williams is adquate
to the task, only subtlely in places, so as to not overcome the music of
war.  One thing that I also liked was the fact that during the entire
opening sequence, we don't see the faces of the German soldiers until the
characters see their faces.  Just a rain of machine-gun fire, greeting
them/us on the beach.  
     Overall, the film is realistic and technically superior to previous
war films, but in my opinion it lacked the any emotional connection to the
characters and the story.  I really didn't care if they found him or not,
as long as the characters caused me to be involved in the film at a
personal level.  That did not happen.  Therefore the film was to me a
disappointment.</P>
<P>Of the 3.75 I paid for it, it was worth $1.85</P>
