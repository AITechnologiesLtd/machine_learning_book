<P>     Albert Brooks has always been a filmmaker who couldn't resist a great
high concept.  In his debut feature REAL LIFE, he parodied the pioneering
PBS documentary "An American Family;" in LOST IN AMERICA, he sent a yuppie
couple on an ill-fated attempt to drop out of society; in DEFENDING YOUR
LIFE, he imagined the afterlife as a spiritual courtroom; and in MOTHER,
he moved back in with Mom to figure out his relationship troubles.  An
inspired, outrageous situation has provided Brooks with the spark to show
his characters -- notably himself -- coming to terms with themselves and
finding a little dignity.  His concepts fueled the gags, but he never
forgot to tell a story.</P>
<P>     In THE MUSE, Brooks makes a mistake he's never made before:  he
starts with a situation comedy, then never moves beyond the situation.
Brooks stars as Stephen Phillips, a successful Hollywood screenwriter at a
career crossroads.  Dumped from a studio deal for writing scripts with no
"edge," a depressed Stephen seeks counsel from his friend and fellow
writer Jack (Jeff Bridges).  Jack offers Stephen access to what he claims
is the secret of his own success:  an actual, straight-out-of-mythology
muse named Sarah (Sharon Stone).  Though initially incredulous, Stephen
finds that his collaborations with Sarah are firing his creative juices.
Unfortunately, he also finds Sarah's services much in demand, including
from his own wife Laura (Andie MacDowell), who finds herself inspired to
pursue her own creative dreams.</P>
<P>     THE MUSE seems to have been born as yet another Hollywood satire,
poking fun at the insecurities of movie folk and ther fascination with the
latest insta-cure for what ails them personally or professionally.
Brooks, uses the opportunity to toss in cameos by other filmmakers who
have been Sarah's "clients" (James Cameron thanks her for TITANIC; Martin
Scorsese proposes a remake of RAGING BULL, "but with a really thin guy"),
which are good for a couple of smiles.  The insider gags, unfortunately,
are about the only ones that work.  More often, THE MUSE is a comedy in
search of something, _anything_ funny to say.  Sharon Stone's finicky diva
is an idea that never quite takes off, and the supporting players often
look vaguely bored with their lines.  Even Brooks' usually reliable
persona can't jump-start the film, because it doesn't turn into a
sympathetic character.  He's just an annoyed privileged guy whose
annoyance at his slightly lessened privilege makes him just plain
annoying.</P>
<P>     Brooks' lack of a character is part of the over-riding problem with
THE MUSE: a lack of anything substantial past the thin premise.  The film
occasionally looks like it could be leading Stephen towards a little
growing up, whether about his career neuroses or his retro-breadwinner 
agitation at Laura's growing financial success as a cookie-maker.  There's
even the faint hope that Brooks could be offering a light-hearted look at
the shove people require just to believe in their own talents.  Then the
film ends, and it becomes evident that there's not a shred of actual story
to THE MUSE.  There's no improved mutual understanding in the Phillips'
relationship, no one grows, no one learns a thing -- there's not even the
satisfaction of Sarah explaining her own turns of character.  The whole
thing just fades to black, leaving a shallow collection of industry jokes
in its wake.</P>
<P>     There are a few decent laughs to be found in Brooks' validation of
William Goldman's line about how "nobody knows anything" in Hollywood.
Mark Feuerstein has a nicely understated role as a tactless studio
executive, and Steven Wright appears briefly as the nepotistically-
advantaged Stan Spielberg.  But much of the acidic humor leaves a sour
aftertaste once it's clear that it's all little more than a chance for
Brooks to vent.  His character spends much of the film in search of a
third act for his screenplay, which is ironic when you consider that THE
MUSE is in desperate need of a third act of its own.  It's even more
ironic that in the middle of a Hollywood satire, the protagonist's
brilliant script -- the one he's inspired to write after being told he has
"lost [his] edge" -- is a wacky high-concept vehicle for Jim Carrey.  If
the lesson Brooks wants us to learn is that a writer's goal in life should
be coming up with yet another mass-market yuk-fest, then maybe he's the
one who has lost his edge.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 babbling Brooks:  5.</PRE>
