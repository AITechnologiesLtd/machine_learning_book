<PRE>A REVIEW OF "THE SHINING"
A RETRO REVIEW, 1980
by Ryan Ellis</PRE>
<P>give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, <A HREF="mailto:iluvmick@hotmail.com">iluvmick@hotmail.com</A></P>
<P>(NOTE-This is my 4th of 5 weekly retro reviews honouring great
Jack Nicholson films. "Chinatown", "A Few Good Men", and "One
Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" are already posted on the Internet.
Also, since Stanley Kubrick died just a short time ago, why not
highlight a collabration of two great film artists?)</P>
<P>After winning his first Academy Award for a marvelous performance
in "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest", Jack Nicholson went through
a notable, if not particularly successful, phase of his career.
In "The Missouri Breaks" and "The Last Tycoon", Jack appeared
opposite living legends Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, and Tony
Curtis. He also got to work with directors Arthur Penn and Elia
Kazan in those pictures while directing "Goin' South" himself.
Those three movies might be considered a "warm-up" as he prepared
for his opportunity to do something which very few great actors
ever had the chance to do--to perform in a film for director
Stanley Kubrick.</P>
<P>The secretive and obsessive Kubrick was in the middle of a streak
of his own. "Dr. Strangelove", "2001: A Space Odyssey", "A
Clockwork Orange", and "Barry Lyndon" represented three straight
outstanding films, then one well-made epic. Adapting Steven
King's best-selling novel, "The Shining", was Kubrick's next
project. Shot in England, it was an elaborate horror film which
didn't get the praises from critics that Kubrick's films usually
received. I must be one of the few people who A) liked the team
of Kubrick and Nicholson B) saw much more in this film than just
the ghost story and C) found it to be truly scary. After all,
that IS the point.</P>
<P>Kubrick and co-screenwriter Diane Johnson made drastic changes to
King's in-depth novel. The ugly, abusive family histories for
both the Jack Torrance character (Nicholson) and his wife, Wendy
(Shelley Duvall), were excluded. They also dropped the extensive
flashbacks to the family's life on the East Coast where Jack lost
his teaching job for beating up one of his students. Some
supporting characters were written out and the manager of the
Overlook Hotel, Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson), is not the
officious jerk King portrayed him to be. Young son Danny (Danny
Lloyd) is no longer a brilliant five-year old, nor is Wendy a
strong woman. Heck, they made Danny dumb and Wendy weak.</P>
<P>Still, the screenwriters' adaptation was an improvement in other
ways. Dialogue isn't always this film's biggest asset, but when
the lines are good, they're REALLY good. And memorable! How about
"Here's Johnny!", "Gimme the bat, Wendy!", the ominous "Redrum",
and the written ramblings of Jack's "All work and no play makes
Jack a dull boy". And dig that elevator of blood! Sure, it's a
blatantly unsubtle image, but it's cool. A major change and a
real credit to the climax is that Kubrick shows more restraint
than King. This is a rare example of where the movie's ending is
much LESS explosive than in the book. And the biggest addition
from novel to screen--eerie music--is a classic example of how
appropriate music can greatly heighten the "fear factor".</P>
<P>The story is familiar. Lifelong failure and recovering alcoholic
Jack Torrance gets a last-chance job as the winter caretaker for
Colorado's elite Overlook Hotel. He's enthusiastic about the job
even though he & his family will be stranded alone for several
months when the brutal winter arrives. He's enthusiastic about
the job even though the hotel has a bloody history and one of the
previous caretakers went crazy and murdered his family. He's even
enthusiastic about the job when he hears that the hotel was built
on an Indian burial ground (hey, what ghost story DOESN'T have an
Indian burial ground!). Jack simply wants solitude to finish a
play he's writing and the chance to forget that he has a rather
horrible life. Wendy and Danny join him, of course, and
everyone's happy. </P>
<P>Well, actually, Danny isn't. He knows the sordid Overlook is not
Disneyland. He has the power (through his imaginary friend, Tony)
to see the future. The hotel's cook, Dick Hallorann (Scatman
Crothers in a miscast role as a token black victim), also has
this power, this "shining", to read thoughts and warns Danny to
be careful in the ominous Overlook. The naive kid is precocious
like all youngsters and he's both fascinated by the forbidden
aspects of the hotel while being terrified of recurring images of
death and mayhem. Danny's power slowly brings the hotel's demons
to life as Jack struggles through a killer case of writer's
block. Wendy helplessly watches her delicate family fall apart as
Jack's developing insanity (not to mention his "deal" with the
hotel) becomes violent and painful.</P>
<P>The basic plot of this film is an old-fashioned ghost story with
slasher film overtones. The interesting part of the movie is that
the single strongest theme here is not that hotels can drive you
crazy or that experiencing a few bad days at the typewriter gives
you the right to axe your family. The strongest theme here is of
divorce. Here's a husband with no respect for his wife or son. In
one scene, he looks down at a model of the outdoor hedge-maze
while Wendy & Danny walk around inside the real maze. Obvious
metaphor--he "looks down on them". Like many dysfunctional
families, the man can seem perfectly normal & loving to the
outsider and still be quite abusive to his family. As he loses
his mind, Jack has a nightmare about killing Wendy & Danny, he
has a fantasy in the hotel's empty bar that explains the
alcoholic & abusive history, and he doesn't tell his family when
he starts to see dangerous things in the hotel. Nice guy! The man
is simply not a good father and while his wife tries her best to
hold her family together, in the end, she takes the kid and
leaves him--metaphorically divorcing him.</P>
<P>Jack Torrance wants to believe that he's an intelligent man, but
he's just a representation of all the selfish louts who blame
their own failures on their innocent loved ones. He feels
claustrophobic and trapped despite living in such a giant place.
Jack is a massive failure, even as the hotel's caretaker (after
all, he dies and leaves it unattended). Or does dying for the
hotel make him a devoted servant? Well, if that makes him an
accomplished man, he doesn't aspire to very much. This man is
supposed to be a literate writer, yet he becomes a hobbling
lumberjack, then a bellowing beast before the icy ending.
Ironically, Jack's demonic obsession to kill his family is rather
admirable. Geez, parents today couldn't be BOTHERED to chase a
kid in order to kill him. They'd just take away the tyke's Sony
Playstation or give him one of those "hyperactivity" pills!</P>
<P>What makes this film work is its genuine creepiness. Along with
the effective music, Kubrick uses some great camera angles (one
was directly below a standing Jack in the pantry). The Steadicam
shot was a particular favourite in "The Shining" in more than
just the famous scenes following Danny on his Big Wheel. Kubrick
liked the Steadicam technique and used it a lot. It's so smooth
and so appropriate on the huge sets that the technological impact
is underrated. At all times, the camera seems to be a set of eyes
watching these three people as they fritter around in an evil
place. The enormous interior sets were built on a soundstage, yet
they give off an aura that makes you want to drive a snowmobile
up there yourself and tell these people to GET OUTTA HERE RIGHT
NOW!</P>
<P>The glue of this film is Jack Nicholson. It takes quite an actor
to be THAT nuts considering the unending number of takes Kubrick
demands. His scenes in the bar show remarkable lunacy. The
fabulous "gimme the bat, Wendy" scene gives us Nicholson's
trademark character explosion. At times, he's pretty funny too.
Even Jack's "killer smile" has an appropriate name here. He's a
sinister ticking bomb. It's been said that he goes nuts too
quickly and maybe that's true. But the whole point of the story
is that this man felt trapped and ready to explode long before he
ever got to the Overlook. The haunting images and malevolent
results are metaphors to explain how this particular family falls
apart as they lose their collective grip on reality.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Kubrick's deliberate--heck, downright
slooooow--pacing doesn't score the way it did with "2001".
Strange as this sounds, the film is too long, yet, arguably, the
craziness happens too soon! However, what nearly sunk "The
Shining" altogether was the awful performance by Shelley Duvall.
This acting hack could take some lessons from the appealing
Rebecca De Mornay (who was much better in the 1997 TV movie).
Duvall's chemistry with Danny Lloyd comes and goes. She has
almost NO chemistry with the commanding Nicholson. Sure, her
pathetic performance was probably what Kubrick wanted opposite
the whacko Jack. After all, who WOULDN'T be petrified with fear
as the horrors unfold? But her acting was incredibly weak and it
wasn't even offset by Danny Lloyd. The kid is okay at best and
he's not very lovable or intelligent.</P>
<P>To nitpick--there are noteworthy mistakes in "The Shining".
First, the helicopter's shadow for the overhead shot is visible
during the opening drive up to the hotel. Second, Jack tears
paper out of his typewriter, but doesn't replace it with a fresh
sheet before he starts typing again. Third, he toasts Lloyd the
bartender to "5 miserable months on the wagon", yet Wendy said in
the opening 20 minutes that he hadn't had a drink for 5 months
before they ever GOT to the hotel. Fourth, she slices his hand
during the bathroom door demolition, but in a later shot there's
no blood on the knife. And the most glaring error occurs during
that same demolition. Jack axes through only one side of the door
to do his infamous "Here's Johnny", but later the door is split
in two places. Clearly, the scene of his busting through on the
other side of the door was cut.</P>
<P>So, having analyzed this film to death (pun intended!), I'll
stubbornly maintain that "The Shining" succeeds in spite of its
mistakes and weaknesses. Jack's a devilish cartoon. He's so
compelling in the lead that when he's not on screen, you can't
wait until he comes back. Food for thought--Kubrick didn't hit
the bullseye with this picture and STILL created a memorable
movie. It's quotable and creepy. It makes you jump. Anyone
disappointed that this wasn't a masterpiece should remember that
very few true horror movies have ever been deemed classics,
anyway ("Psycho" is one of the few). "The Shining" showcased
Nicholson's abilities with Kubrick's meticulous direction.
Duvall, Lloyd, and overlength be-damned! This is scary and it's
pretty darn good too.</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--Stanley Kubrick made reincarnation and an
unending cycle of life & death one of the many themes in "The
Shining". Not to compare ANY film to his masterpiece, "2001: A
Space Odyssey", but that idea was the central theme for the 1968
classic too.</P>
<P>This film receives an 8/10.
It also ranks #94 on My 100 Favourite Films list.</P>
<P>THE RYAN RATING SYSTEM SAYS...

 3/10--don't go, PLEASE don't go
 2/10--avoid even if you DO have a free pass
 1/10--"Showgirls" territory; truly crappy
