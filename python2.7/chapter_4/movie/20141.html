<P>Now that I've seen "Teaching Mrs. Tingle," the directorial debut of "Scream" 
scribe Kevin Williamson, just one question lingers: exactly what type of film 
is this? If it is a black comedy, there are too many serious moments for it 
to fully take off; if it's a drama, the silliness definitely needed to be cut 
down; if it's a thriller, it's one in which suspense is promised but never 
arrives until the climactic scene; if it belongs in the horror genre, the 
film, with a PG-13 rating and very little violence or terror, is overly mild; 
and if it's a teen angst picture, the writing certainly leaves something to 
be desired.</P>
<P>Leigh Ann Watson (Katie Holmes) is a high school senior nearing graduation 
whose mother (Lesley Ann Warren) is stuck in a dead-end life as a waitress, 
and whose only hope to get into college is if she receives the scholarship 
given to the valedictorian of her class. Unfortunately, her two hurdles are a 
stuck-up fellow student (Liz Stauber) who currently is one point higher than 
she is, and an 'A' in her history class, which is seeming more and more 
unlikely because of her nasty, bitter teacher, Mrs. Tingle (Helen Mirren), a 
middle-aged Wicked Witch of the West who gets her kicks out of putting all of 
her pupils down and being the one to stand in the way of their dreams. When 
Leigh Ann is falsely caught by Mrs. Tingle with the answer sheet to the final 
exam in her bookbag, despite the culprit actually being the rebellious 
slacker, Luke (Barry Watson), Tingle threatens to report Leigh Ann the next 
morning and, thus, basically ruining her whole life. Convinced by Luke and 
Leigh Ann's best friend, the aspiring actress Jo Lynne (Marisa Coughlan), the 
three of them set off that night to Mrs. Tingle's home to explain and plead 
the whole misunderstanding with her. Things get out of hand and the plot 
thickens when Tingle threatens to call the police on them and ends up getting 
a crossbow accidentally shot at her, side-swiping her face and knocking her 
out. In desperation, the three drag the unconcious Mrs. Tingle upstairs to 
her room and tie her to the bedpost, ready to talk their way out of the 
situation once she comes to, but their elder has some surprises in store for 
them too, as she works to turn them against each other with some tricky mind 
games and believable lies.</P>
<P>"Teaching Mrs. Tingle" is the film that Williamson is known to have written 
the screenplay for before his fame with "Scream," and it was only after 
adding clout to his name was he allowed by Miramax's genre label, Dimension 
Films, to make the picture. Easy to believe, as "Teaching Mrs. Tingle" has 
all of the signs of a strictly novice effort, with the writing having almost 
none of the cleverness, style, and originality that has marked all of his 
other projects, from "Scream" to "I Know What You Did Last Summer" to TV's 
"Dawson's Creek." And as for being a director, Williamson shows some promise, 
but since the screenplay is seriously flawed and never takes off, neither 
does the film.</P>
<P>If there is one word to describe "Teaching Mrs. Tingle," that word is 
'bland.' If the movie is never necessarily boring, it also is rarely 
interesting, and almost everything that occurs in the film (which, let's face 
it, isn't much) is strictly dull and insipid. The premise of an unforeseen 
hostage situation with the "Teacher From Hell" could have easily been 
exciting and inventive, with the three teens having to solve one complication 
after the other, but aside from one pedestrian instance in which the gym 
teacher (Jeffrey Tambor) arrives at Mrs. Tingle's home and addresses himself 
as, "Spankey," nothing of the sort ever happens. Instead, what we have are 
three characters essentially standing around a house, with the sly Mrs. 
Tingle occasionally playing with each one of theirs' emotions, and a 
non-graphic, but exploitative sex scene popping up at the most inopportune 
time for the simple reason of adding some spice to the proceedings. All it 
ends up adding, however, is an extra level of ludicrous plotting.</P>
<P>Veteran British actress Helen Mirren, as the cruel Mrs. Tingle, is far more 
astonishing and scene-stealing than she has any right to be, and raises this 
otherwise tepid film up a notch so that it could be classified as an "OK" 
film, rather than a downright bad one. From her early, brutal scene in which, 
one by one, Mrs. Tingle cold-heartedly criticizes her students as they get up 
to present a project, Mirren creates a character that is just about the most 
distinct, memorable movie villain I've ever seen. Not only that, but Mirren 
also creates an added dimension to Mrs. Tingle that probably would never have 
appeared had the performance not been as powerful, as we learn she is an 
unhappy woman hellbent on destroying her students because of her 
uncontrollable jealousy that many will become big-time successes, when she is 
still stuck in the same little town with the same job she had thirty years 
ago.</P>
<P>As the three central teen characters, Katie Holmes strikes an honest chord 
with her desperate character, but is not given the chance to really test her 
acting skills as she was with this past spring's "Go" and on "Dawson's 
Creek," due to a flat character that is never very appealing. Faring even 
worse is Barry Watson (TV's "7th Heaven"), who is stuck for the majority of 
the film blending into the background. His character of Luke is so thin, and 
not given the chance to do anything but act as an unconvincing love interest 
to Holmes, that he makes next to no impression. Marisa Coughlan is a 
different matter altogether; a fresh, talented find that will next be seen on 
Williamson's latest televsion excursion, "WasteLand," Coughlan's Jo Lynne is 
engaging in a way that Leigh Ann never is, and is given some of the more 
notable scenes, including a dead-ringer reenactment of the possessed Linda 
Blair in "The Exorcist" and another scene where she puts on a plausible act 
in front of Mrs. Tingle, only for the acid-tongued Tingle to respond, "I hope 
you make a good waitress." In supporting roles, everyone is wasted in 
basically cameos, particularly Vivica A. Fox, who has all of one scene as 
Leigh Ann's understanding guidance counselor. Only former teen queen Molly 
Ringwald is able to stand out, as the principal's assistant who takes over as 
substitute for Tingle and ends off teaching the material to the class 
equipped with a neverending slew of curse words.</P>
<P>"Teaching Mrs. Tingle" wraps up its story in an unconvincing manner that 
hammers the final nail in the film's coffin. Although Leigh Ann was right to 
fight for what she believed was right, that still does not excuse her or her 
two friends' criminal behavior, something which they get out of far too 
easily. And the last scene might have been satisfying had the end credits not 
have popped up so abruptly while in the middle of the scene. Was Williamson 
in such a breakneck rush to end the film that he didn't feel there was time 
to film a complete last scene before going to black and then starting the 
credits? Who knows? "Teaching Mrs. Tingle" has only one claim to notoriety, 
and it's Mirren's sparklingly vicious performance. Without her, the film 
would ultimately be a black hole of nothingness.</P>
