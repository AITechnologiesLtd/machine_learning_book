                        A Film Review by James Berardinelli

<P>     MAVERICK may be as close as anything comes to a perfect summer movie 
(as opposed to a perfect movie).  It has great action sequences, more 
than a splash of legitimately-funny humor, solid performances from 
engaging actors, and a script that doesn't demand much mental exercise.  
This is an enjoyable motion picture, and a good start to the 1994 summer 
season. </P>
<P>     LETHAL WEAPON's Richard Donner and Mel Gibson have teamed up again 
in this comedy/adventure/western that recalls, but does not imitate, the 
1950s television series.  Along for the ride is James Garner, who 
millions will remember as the original Bret Maverick, and Donner makes a 
wise decision in giving him far more than a token speaking part.  
Garner's laid back persona is the perfect contrast to the high-voltage 
Gibson. </P>
<P>     Two-time Oscar winner Jodie Foster is effervescent in a role that 
requires little dramatic range but a flair for comedy.  Foster's 
Annabelle Bransford is a delight to watch, especially when paired with 
Gibson.  There's a spark between them. </P>
<P>     The story involves Maverick and Annabelle's attempts to get to a big 
Saint Louis riverboat poker game where the entry fee is $25,000.  Each is 
short by a few grand, and they're going from town-to-town trying to win, 
steal, or cheat others out of it.  The pair meet in Crystal River, and 
soon find themselves on the same runaway coach out of town, in the 
company of itinerant lawman Zane Cooper (Garner).   </P>
<P>     MAVERICK features gun fights, fist fights, an attempted hanging, and 
a tete-a-tete with rattlesnakes - but none of these sequences are graphic 
or gory.  The film is basically lighthearted, so there aren't too many 
deaths or maimings. </P>
<P>     Donner has a great deal of fun incorporating parodies of past movies 
into this one.  The most inspired is a quick flash to his own LETHAL 
WEAPON.  There's also an extended DANCES WITH WOLVES sequence, featuring 
WOLVES' Graham Greene as a hip Indian who cheats the white man.  MAVERICK 
also pays tribute to screenwriter William Goldman's BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE 
SUNDANCE KID. </P>
<P>     The strength of MAVERICK is the ease with which it switches from 
comedy to action, and back again.  For the most part, the pacing is 
excellent, although at more than two hours, the film goes on for a little 
too long.  No drama is needed, nor is it in evidence. </P>
<P>     The well-crafted MAVERICK does everything it sets out to do.  For 
big-budget summer films, from which more and more is demanded, this is 
becoming an increasingly-difficult task - so it's refreshing to find 
something that satisfies expectations.  To paraphrase the lead character, 
MAVERICK rarely bluffs and never, ever cheats its audience.  </P>
