<P>Champion of the camera pyrotechnics, director Sam Raimi reins himself
in for this film, and takes on the impression of the Coen brothers on a
date with Alfred Hitchcock, in this good old fashioned small town
thriller that has everyone asking themselves the same question..."Would
I keep the money?" </P>
<P>PLOT:
Two brothers and a friend find $4.4 million on a crashed airplane in a
nearby snow-ridden forest. The boys agree to hang on to the money until
the spring, and see if anyone comes looking for it. If nobody claims
for it by them, they agree to share the spoils among themselves, and
never tell anyone else about it. Somewhere along the line, their
"simple plan" goes awry and the plot thickens. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Magnificent film blends all the best elements of a suspense with a
solid cast of players, a beautiful landscape a la FARGO (7/10), and a
labyrinth of twists and turns that will have you gnawing at your
fingernails in anticipation of the next morally-questionable
booby-trap. Sam Raimi has crafted one of the best thrillers of the past
few years, and does so without the aid of his wonderfully creative
camera tricks. This film works on all cylinders because Raimi, and
screenwriter Smith, groove the characters out of real people with real
problems and real concerns on their minds. The people in this film are
just like you and me, and that is what makes this thriller so much
deeper and grittier than most. It's based in the reality of the moment,
and the consequences that each and every one of us could face in the
advent of a simple, everyday cover-up. One thing leads to another in
this film, and then another, and then another, until the dark reality
of the situation finally succumbs the group, at which point,
well...you'll see!</P>
<P>All of the actors in this movie are amazing, but Billy Bob Thornton
pulls off another fantastic showing, as the hick brother who lacks in
the brainpower but makes up for it via his abundancy of conscience.
This movie is for all those people who love to sit in a theatre, watch
a movie magically unfold before their very eyes, and chew on the stream
of questions rattling off in their brains..."What's gonna happen
next?"..."What would I do in a situation like this?"..."How the hell
are they gonna get out of this one?"</P>
<P>This movie is fun and entertaining to watch because it doesn't give us
all the answers up front. It slowly unveils the layers of the story as
the minutes of the film tick by, and the tension from the suspense
sinks in. The cinematography of this movie is lush and creamy, the
actors are rock-solid and the plot is a wonder in the science of
twisting and turning. Forget all of those crappy big-budgeted,
big-starred Hollywood pictures that are coming out this winter season,
and go see a movie that truly embraces all of the good old-fashioned
notions that make up a great suspenseful film. This film is a tasty
delight for all those who love the mystery and the fascination of a
cool thriller, and who enjoy watching real characters live out
extraordinary circumstances. </P>
<P>So would I keep a sack of $4.4 million if I found it in the middle of a
forest tomorrow? After seeing the degradation of human values that
crossed the lives of every single person in this movie, I would say
"no". </P>
<P>Unless of course...I had a simple plan to get away with it all.....  :)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Ben Stiller, John Dahl and John Boorman were three other directors that
were at some point associated to the making of this film.
A scene with Billy Bob Thornton and Bill Paxton was lost by Northwest
Airlines in January 1998 while in transit from Minnesota to Los
Angeles. The missing scene had been shot in Minnesota. The film was
insured.
Sam Raimi requested some advice from his old friends who once helped
him on his EVIL DEAD movies, the Coen brothers, in regards to the
shooting of this movie in the snow. When Raimi isn't directing or
writing, he's busy as the executive producer of the blockbuster
syndicated TV series "Xena: Warrior Princess" and "Hercules: The
Legendary Journeys." He also co-wrote two films with the Coen brothers.
The first was CRIMEWAVE (5/10), and the second was THE HUDSUCKER PROXY
(6/10).
Bill Paxton's father plays the part of Mr. Schmitt in this movie. 
"A Simple Plan", the novel also written by Scott Smith, spent seven
weeks on the New York Times best-seller list in 1994. Smith originally
conceived the project as a screenplay before choosing to write it as a
novel. Smith wrote A SIMPLE PLAN while living in New Orleans. The
kernel of the idea for the novel was something he first came up with as
a graduate student in a screenwriting course at Columbia University's
writing program. 
This film was filmed in the early months of 1998 in Delano, Minnesota.</P>
