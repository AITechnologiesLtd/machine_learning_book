THE LEGEND OF DRUNKEN MASTER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>This is the first time that I've ever started off a review by telling 
you what film I'm not reviewing.  This is not a review of THE LEGEND OF 
DRUNKEN MASTER (1994), starring the lovable Jackie Chan.  The 1994 
version was in the original Chinese and came with English subtitles.  I 
have a critic-friend well versed in Hong Kong cinema, who claims the 
1994 version is a classic martial arts picture of the comedic action 
genre.  I came late to the Jackie Chan admiration society.  Although I'm 
a fan now, with my favorite being his recent SHANGHAI NOON, I haven't 
seen any of his early films such as this movie.</P>
<P>In order to capitalize on the Chan phenomenon and knowing that American 
audiences are generally too lazy to read, the studio has released a poor 
and awkwardly dubbed reissue of the original.  This review is strictly 
for the dubbed version.  How these thoughts would apply to the original, 
I have no idea.  I absolutely shudder to think what my second favorite 
film of last year, RUN LOLA RUN, would sound like dubbed into English.</P>
<P>Chan stars in a picture with a remarkably thin plot.  As usual he does 
everything himself from getting beaten up to falling on burning coals.  
Is there no limit to the pain he has to endure for his craft?  In his 
normal outtakes shown during the closing credits, he proves to us yet 
again that he does do all of his own stunts, risking his life and limb.  </P>
<P>His schtick this time is that he is a master of the art of drunken 
fighting.  Tanked up with lots of booze, which he guzzles during the 
bouts, he bobs and weaves so that hitting him is like trying to strike 
blowing grass in a strong wind.  As almost an afterthought, the story 
lets us know that even a drunken master can over imbibe, rendering him 
more of a fool than a master.</P>
<P>The beauty of Chan's films is due as much to the ballet-quality 
choreography that he brings to kung fu as to the humor that permeates 
everything that he does.  In a nutshell, the problem with THE LEGEND OF 
DRUNKEN MASTER is that there is too much fighting gymnastics and too 
little of the story development.  This means that the story dissolves 
into little more than slapstick and highly repetitive fight sequences.  
I wanted more than this and left the theater feeling cheated.  This was 
one of the unusual Chan movies in which I didn't have much fun.  Maybe 
you will.  Or maybe you'll avoid this theatrical version entirely and go 
rent the subtitled one instead.</P>
<P>THE LEGEND OF DRUNKEN MASTER runs 1:42.  It is rated R for violent 
content and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
