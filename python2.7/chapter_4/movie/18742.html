<PRE>Smoke
directed by Wayne Wang
starring Harvey Keitel, William Hurt, Stockard Channing, Harold
Perrineau, Jr., Forest Whitaker
Rated R (mild language)</PRE>
<PRE>** ½ out of **** / B</PRE>
<P>Smoke is a necklace of stories: each pearl different in its own way, but
all of them united by a string of thread.  Directed with a sedate
simplicity by The Joy Luck Club's Wayne Wang and written by novelist
Paul Auster, this motion picture is not exceptional, but it is
effective.  I would certainly recommend many titles over this small
Miramax film, but it is undeniable that there was much thought behind
its creation and the writer has woven philosophy into these Big Apple
tales.</P>
<P>The cast of acclaimed actors includes Harvey Keitel (who is always
interesting), William Hurt, Stockard Channing, Ashley Judd, and Forest
Whitaker.  Newcomer Harold Perrineau, Jr. joins the mix and together
Wang, Auster, and the cast tell these thoughtful, if not compelling,
stories to get across the simple message that People affect people.  The
thread that unites these stories is a small cigar shop owned by Auggie
Wren (Keitel), a man with a simple life, a few friends, and
philosophical "life" tidbits in his numerous stories.  His friend and
regular customer, a writer named Paul (Hurt) is one day affected by a
young man named Rashid (Perrineau) who saves his life near the cigar
shop.  Of course, Paul offers Rashid anything he wants in return for
saving his life.  Rashid decides on a lemonade, then on moving in with
Paul.  He has, we later learn, run away from his home from his aunt and
uncle to find his father who abandoned him years ago who someone has
seen alive.  He is also running away from the robbers who stole five
thousand dollars- the money which he now has.</P>
<P>Rashid finds who he believes to be his father- Cyrus, an owner of a
small town gas station who has a bitter past that has left him with a
fake arm.  While their relationship is on the verge of being discovered,
someone enters Auggie Wren's life.  It is his ex-girlfriend from several
years ago (Stockard Channing) who comes to the cigar shop claiming that
her daughter, Felicity, who may be his is strung out on drugs in the
projects with a moronic beast.  He is reluctant to believe her but does
not want to leave a girl who may be his daughter on drugs in the
projects with a freak boyfriend when he hears that she is pregnant.
Rashid's five thousand dollars will affect their lives.</P>
<P>As you can see, it is a tangled web of lost souls and wise men, all of
them with a story to tell.  They are, directly or indirectly, affected
by the other "pearls" on the string, most of the time by small details.
In a matter of seconds, Rashid walks into Paul's life.  The money from a
robbery is able to be put into good use.  Smoke is a portrait of the
difficulties and poignancy of life.</P>
<P>Here are the flaws: Smoke sometimes feels so contrived it doesn't seem
worth watching.  Whitaker's performance is frail- his scenes of
outbursts are so mechanical, so choreographed all the passion from them
are leeched out.  The entire cast doesn't show anything for the big
names it includes- most of the performances are acceptable, some have
many moments of tenderness and wisdom, but all of them lack the
"something" that makes you think - "Good acting!"  Ashley Judd's turn as
Felicity is short but has its emotionally-charged moments.  It is too
brief, though, and the character is too underdeveloped to regulate what
the film could have been- wonderful.</P>
<P>Smoke does have a very heartwarming ending, though.  It concludes this
melting pot of soap operas of a few New Yorkers.  The film has several
gems of pleasure hidden in its soft, gentle theme and watching it is not
painful or a waste of time.  Rachel Portman's score is put to good use,
as all of her great scores are, and creates a nice, simple atmosphere
for these simple tales.  What is wrong with Smoke is not its message,
but the fabricated way in which it is decorated.</P>
