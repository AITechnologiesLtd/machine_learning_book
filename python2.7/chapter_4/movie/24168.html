<P>Disclamer: This review may divulge a few more plot details than you'd
like to hear.  If you wish to view the film, you may wish to skip this
review.  Besides, you can't really be prepared for your experience when
watching this film anyway.</P>
<PRE>American Psycho (2000)</PRE>
<P>Starring Christian Bale, Willam Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny, and Reese
Witherspoon.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Mary Harron</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Vince Yim</PRE>
<P>American Psycho (2000) tells the tale of Patrick Bateman, a 27-year old
yuppy with an upscale apartment, rows of suits, a really nice watch, abs
of steel, and a bunch of dead body parts decorating his apartment.  </P>
<P>The film has been a subject of controversy over the past little while. 
First of all, it is an adaptation of a book of the same name, which has
been reportedly banned, and was also the book read by notorious Canadian
serial killer Paul Bernardo (proving that yes, movies, books, and video
games will turn an average joe into a cold blooded killer).  And then
there's the little matter of a sex scene that has to be trimmed in order
to avoid the dreaded NC17 rating.  </P>
<P>After watching it, I'm still left with the nagging question of whether I
liked the film or not.</P>
<PRE>Uh oh.</PRE>
<P>American Psycho works on multiple levels.  On one level, it is a bloody
slasher pic on par with Texas Chainsaw Massacre (which, if I'm not
mistaken, is actually featured on a television in the background as the
protagonist does situps).  On another level, it is a witty satire along
the lines of RoboCop and Fight Club.  On another level, it is a
hilarious comedy that makes you feel really bad for laughing.  But does
it work as a combination on those levels?</P>
<P>The film takes place in the late 1980s and deals with the greed and
materialism often associated with the "Me" generation, where everybody
is so absorbed by their new CDs, their fancy business cards, their brand
name stereo equipment, their cellphones, and their ability to get
reservations at the fanciest restaurants.  The film attempts to make a
social commentary about that, telling about how one man who has it all
-- beautiful women, money, all the coke he can snort -- is dissatisfied
by everything material and must kill people in order to be content.</P>
<P>Hence, we are treated to really graphic showings of him killing people
with reckless abandon.  This is done in such an over-the-top manner
that, a lot of the time, it just leaves you in stitches.  One scene
involves Patrick inviting a co-worker rival to his apartment, which he
has decorated with newspaper plastic sheets to cover the furniture and
carpet.  He then pulls out a shiny axe, which he uses to hack his
co-worker into itty bitty bits to the tune of Huey Lewis and the News'
"Hip to be Square".  Another scene involves him wielding a chainsaw
while chasing a prostitute, while completely naked.  These scenes are
really sick and difficult to watch, yet you can't stop laughing no
matter how hard you try.</P>
<P>As well, there is the scene that had to be trimmed for American
audiences (I love being Canadian!).  In one scene, Patrick has picked up
two prostitutes and is having a menage-a-trois.  But, all throughout the
experience, he his actually staring at himself in the mirror, flexing
his muscles and posing.</P>
<P>Towards the conclusion, the audience is given a Fight Club-esque plot
twist, leaving the audience members confused as to the homicidal nature
of the character.  This does make for an interesting message -- does
having far too many material things ultimately lead to a hollow life,
which in the end leads to something close to psychosis?</P>
<P>The unfortunate thing about the film is the way it handles the social
message.  The film practically jams it down your throat, with constant
mentions of material things and people's attachment to them (ie: Patrick
goes through his daily routine and lists off the products he uses in
minute detail).  </P>
<P>>From a technical standpoint, the film is really well done.  With a $7M
budget (half of which was recouped in the first weekend of release), the
film has beautifully designed sets, good attention to detail,
interesting camera angles, and is a good film to look at and listen to. 
But the ambiguous ending leaves you a bit cold.</P>
<P>I do recommend this film, but mostly on the basis of Christian Bale's
acting and the fact that this is not a film where one can just be told
to like it or not.  This is the type of film where one has to see it for
themselves to make their own judgement.  </P>
<PRE>Rating: still undecided.</PRE>
