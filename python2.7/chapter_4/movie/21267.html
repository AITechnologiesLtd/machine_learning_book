<PRE>                          BRINGING OUT THE DEAD
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     One has to wonder if Martin Scorsese's worldview stops at the New
Jersey state line.</P>
<P>     A shocking disappointment, BRINGING OUT THE DEAD marks Scorsese's
first film since KUNDUN, and his first contemporary movie since CASINO.
So neither of these took place in New York, but Scorsese is so in love
with his hometown, it shows through in all his work.  DEAD actually
begins with the title card, `This film takes place in New York City' (or
something close to that), just so there's no confusion.</P>
<P>     Confusion about where you are?  Impossible.  DEAD is little more
than a series of only-in-NYC horror stories about New York paramedic
Frank Pierce (Cage), a burnt-out ambulance driver who's slowly going
crazy, and who thinks he sees the spirits of the people whose lives he
didn't save.  His partners are all nuts (Goodman, Rhames, and Sizemore –
who together save this picture from the dustbin), and he finds himself
inexplicably attracted to Mary (Arquette), the daughter of a patient
whom he inexplicably revives.</P>
<P>     In fact, inexplicable is an apt word for most of BRINGING OUT THE
DEAD.  Despite a promising concept (get inside the head of a wacked-out
paramedic), it's one blown opportunity after another.  (See PUSHING TIN
for another film with the same problem.)  Instead of good writing, the
story meanders interminably, relying on a hip soundtrack and cute camera
tricks to propel the plot.  Frank's obsession with the deceased Rose is
baffling, yet it drives most of the action.</P>
<P>     BRINGING OUT THE DEAD is based on the novel of the same name, and
indeed, it feels like the novel has been adapted in full for the screen,
with long, dull voice-over monologues, surreal dream sequences, quirky
supporting cast members, and go-nowhere subplots.  This is not an
effective way to make a film.  Scorsese obsessives will love it.  The
rest of the world will not.</P>
<P>     Kudos to Ving Rhames as the best of Cage's partners, a character
best described as John Shaft meets Jimmy Swaggart.  He'll be on my short
list for Best Supporting Actor, even if he did only have five minutes of
screen time.</P>
