<PRE>"Angel Eyes" – Familiar Vision
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>Somewhere in the twilight zone of movies, huddled
around films like "Frequency" and "The Sixth Sense,"
you'll find ones very much like "Angel Eyes."   You
know the story.  A person is given a chance to make
things right courtesy of some unexplainable,
supernatural intervention.  </P>
<P>There's nothing wrong with a tale that revolves around
cosmic connections.  But we've charted this territory
before, especially in the case of co-star Jim
Caviezel.  His recent roles included a forlorn son
("Frequency"), a haunted homeless man ("Pay It
Forward"), and even a bewildered soldier ("The Thin
Red Line").  This guy has mastered the art of silent
torment.  And here, he has created a reticent wanderer
named Catch whose soul has been traumatized for
reasons that are not made immediately clear.  </P>
<P>His destiny lies with officer Sharon Pogue (Jennifer
Lopez), a feisty cop whose desire to fight crime seems
as if its some measure of her self-worth.  During one
of her frenetic chases, she is ambushed.  Out of
nowhere, Catch appears to save her.  Destiny has
allowed these two to meet, but it will take much more
for these two to truly connect.</P>
<P>Catch is unwilling to discuss his past.  But from
various clues, it's clear that he is either hiding or
trying to forget something.  Why is his kitchen drawer
stashed full of children's toys?  And, at a jazz club,
why does he deny knowing people that claim to
recognize him?  The mystery to Sharon and the audience
is maddening.  </P>
<P>Yet, we also learn that she is almost as secretive and
tormented when she reveals an episode that created a
rift with her father.  As a result, her defensive
mechanism forces her to assume the role of an
invulnerable, graveyard shift-loving supercop.  The
fortress that she has built around her heart is almost
as impenetrable as Catch's is.</P>
<P>For much of "Angel Eyes," the story delicately focuses
on the advances and retreats made by our couple.  They
first develop a cautious, arms-length relationship. 
But to get closer, they would need to break free from
their psychological bonds.   Neither one, though,
seems capable of taking that first important step.</P>
<P>The dramatic aspects worked better than the romantic
ones.  Despite being dubbed the World's Sexiest Woman
(by FHM magazine), Jennifer Lopez had a surprisingly
earthly quality and easily allowed us to sympathize
with her.  She effectively conveyed her sense of loss
underneath her on-the-job bravura.  Caviezal, again,
is reliably good as a member of the walking wounded.</P>
<P>Less convincing, however, was the romantic aspect. 
These two came across more like two lost children
holding hands while walking through a dark forest. 
They were better off as mutual supporters.  Lacking
sizzle, the love scenes then seemed something of
distraction.  </P>
<P>"Angel Eyes" has material that grabs our attention. 
But while it's interesting, it's never quite
compelling.  Some walls are just too tall to break
down, whether it's Catch's inner torment, Sharon's
sense of regret, or the film's desire to be more moody
than it really was.  But we can be grateful that they
tried.  As such, the film does just enough of the
right things to keep us engaged as we watch these two
navigate through their emotional mazes.</P>
