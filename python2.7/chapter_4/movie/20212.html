<P>The 13th Warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it 
carries a worst scent than a canine's least appetizing residue. The 
best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing 
credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely 
white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the 
projector. My vote goes for the ending credits, where you can start 
trying to put the awful experience behind you.</P>
<P>Ibn Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas) is an important official who is banished 
from his home for sleeping with another man's wife. He encounters a 
group of Norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious 
journey to be taken by 13 men. Fahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last 
warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that 
numerous persons at the screening I attended broke out into laughter.</P>
<P>The movie proves to be a new low point for Banderas, who's acting 
seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying 
gay man in 1993's Philadelphia, than that of a warrior. In the 
film's supposed pay off scene, he exclaims "I was wrong, these are not 
men!", a line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production. 
Unfortunately, Banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes Chevy 
Chase's career look like Oscar material.</P>
<P>The film, based on Michael Crichton's best selling novel, Eaters of 
the Dead was shot under that name some three years ago, and after 
numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony, but 
the plot is incredibly difficult to follow.</P>
<P>At the same time, The 13th Warrior makes you think about numerous 
questions. Questions like "Why do the characters always have perfect 
lighting on them even when it is pitch dark?", "Why does no one ever 
have blood cover both sides of their face, but rather just one side?" 
and finally, "Will the manager give me a refund?"</P>
<P>90 minutes into the 103 minute film, a man invites of the warriors "Come 
with me, there is a woman who can help." Unfortunately, there is nothing 
that could help this film. The most appropriate ending would have been 
for the 13 men to join hands, form a chorus line, and break into a 
rendition of "Springtime for Hitler."</P>
