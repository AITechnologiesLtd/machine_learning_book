<PRE>Jawbreaker (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>* out of *****</PRE>
<P>Cast: Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart, Julie Benz, Judy Greer, William
Katt, Jeff Conaway,
Carol Kane, Pam Grier, Marilyn Manson
Written and Directed by: Darren Stein
Running Time: 87 minutes</P>
<P>Three of Reagan High School's elite females kidnap their friend on her
birthday (more specifically, they break into her room as she's
sleeping, stuff a jawbreaker in her mouth, cover her mouth with tape,
tie her up, and throw her in the trunk of their car.  Not
surprisingly, she ends up choking to death on the jawbreaker.  Time
for comedy!</P>
<P>One of the girls in the clique expresses concern over the death of
their friend and what they've done to cause it, so the other two
quickly oust her from the group and alienate her at school.  Then,
after another girl overhears them confess to killing their friend, in
exchange for her silence they give her a makeover and invite her to
join their group.  This is pretty much all that happens in Jawbreaker.</P>
<P>The film's opening three minutes or so which set the film in motion
are the only noteworthy events here.  None of the lead characters are
interesting in the slightest, and the supporting cast (who would have
been interesting) is wasted beyond belief.  Pam Grier is on hand to
play a gritty police detective investigating the murder case, but
ultimately she has absolutely no bearing on anything.  William Katt
(TV's The Greatest American Hero, House) plays the father of the dead
girl, and he has all of about three seconds of screen time.  Honestly,
do you still get paid if you just wander into a movie and not say a
word?</P>
<P>The only moment in the film that even remotely made me smile lasts
about one minute.  It involves Jeff Conaway as the father of one of
the girls, who tries to bond with his snotty daughter by recalling how
she used to listen to Tiffany records.</P>
<P>Believe me, I'm all for a well done dark comedy.  But Jawbreaker makes
no attempts at humor whatsoever, dark or otherwise (unless you count
cartoony sound effects which are included in many of the film's
scenes).  It's just up there on the screen.  You'd like to think that
you don't know exactly where the film is going, but you will, trust
me.  You'll be hoping that at some point, maybe the film will get
intelligent, maybe do something different, maybe have someone turn the
tables on these uppity girls.  But that won't be happening until the
film's finale, which is an abrupt, contrived, ridiculous mess.</P>
<P>Basically, Jawbreaker is Heathers '99.  All I could think about as I
watched this film were things I liked about Heathers.  And I hated
Heathers.  So what does that tell you?  [R]</P>
