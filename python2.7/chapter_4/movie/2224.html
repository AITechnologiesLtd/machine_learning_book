<PRE>                                  SHORT CUTS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Andie MacDowell, Bruce Davison, Lily Tomlin, Tom Waits,
           Anne Archer, Fred Ward, Tim Robbins, Madeleine Stowe,
           Julianne Moore, Matthew Modine.
Screenplay:  Robert Altman and Frank Barhydt.
Director:  Robert Altman.</P>
<P>     Point #1:  Raymond Carver purists might be extremely disappointed
in what Robert Altman has done to some of the best short stories
written in the English language.  The interlocking story structure of
SHORT CUTS does not serve those stories well, and the small pathos of
Carver's Pacific Northwest isn't the same in Altman's Los Angeles.</P>
<P>     Point #2:  SHORT CUTS stands independently as a splendid film
achievement, a brutally funny collection of fragments from broken lives
crafted by a director with renewed vitality.  Only an abiding cynicism
and the uneven appeal of the nine main stories mar this dynamic, poetic
work.</P>
<P>     SHORT CUTS follows 22 characters through four days in contemporary
Los Angeles.  Howard and Ann Finnigan (Bruce Davison, Andie MacDowell)
are an upscale couple whose young son is hit by a car driven by Doreen
Piggot (Lily Tomlin).  Doreen is a waitress with a drunken husband (Tom
Waits) and a disaffected daughter, Honey (Lili Taylor).  Honey is
married to Hollywood make-up artist Bill (Robert Downey Jr.), and best
friends with Jerry and Lois (Chris Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh).  Howard
and Ann's son is cared for by Dr. Ralph Wyman (Matthew Modine), who is
married to aspiring artist Marion (Julianne Moore).  Marion's sister
Sherri (Madeleine Stowe) is married to philandering cop Gene (Tim
Robbins), who's having an affair with Betty (Frances McDormand), much
to the dismay of Betty's estranged husband Stormy (Peter Gallagher).
Also in the milieu are the Finnigans' next door neighbors, a night club
singer (Annie Ross) and her cellist daughter (Lori Singer), and Claire
and Stuart Kane (Anne Archer, Fred Ward), a clown and her unemployed
husband.</P>
<P>     SHORT CUTS is about those moments when individuals are at their
most basic, naked and vulnerable.  Indeed, nakedness and scatology play
a key role in the film, perhaps more than some viewers might find
palatable.  Characters in SHORT CUTS pop zits, break wind, urinate into
streams, talk bluntly about sexuality and wander around in various
states of undress, but none of these elements ever seem gratuitous.
These are the hidden moments when men and women reveal themselves, full
of insecurity, guilt and fear, and SHORT CUTS captures them with a
stunning grace.  In one of the film's most memorable moments, Julianne
Moore stands before husband Matthew Modine making a painful confession,
with evidence that she is a natural redhead in full view.  In another
scene, Bruce Davison squirms while his father (marvelously played by
Jack Lemmon) describes the tryst that led to his estrangement from his
family thirty years before.  This is a film loaded with individual
moments that slam home with the intensity of reality recognized, and
frequently inspire nervous laughter.</P>
<P>     In my estimation, however, Altman erred in the decision to
interlock his stories.  While the structure serves a purpose in
emphasizing a great tapestry of lives, the impact of Carver's
individual stories is largely lost.  "Neighbors," in which a couple
begins living vicariously through the apartment they are taking care
of, is reduce to a couple of white trash folk messing up a nice place;
"Collectors" becomes a single scene with a door-to-door vacuum cleaner
salesman.  It's true that I'm criticizing the film SHORT CUTS is not
rather than the film it is, but it just seems a shame that such rich
source material is given such a cursory treatment.  Altman never seems
to identify with his own characters the way Carver did, and as a result
it seems he's laughing at them and not with them.</P>
<P>     Opinions will vary as to which stories worked best.  I cast my lot
for the most faithful of the adaptations, "So Much Water So Close to
Home," in which Fred Ward, Buck Henry and Huey Lewis discover a dead
body while on a fishing trip.  "A Small Good Thing" also scores big
point from the fine performances of Andie MacDowell as the nervous
mother, Jack Lemmon in the previously noted turn as Bruce Davison's
father, and Lyle Lovett in a quirky appearance as a baker with a mean
streak.  The two big losers are "Neighbors" and the one story created
wholly by Altman, the relationship between a boozy singer and her
daughter which tries to fit in but always seems obviously out of
place.  The valleys, however, are few, and the peaks are massive.  At
over three hours, SHORT CUTS is anything but boring.  It's a sharp,
clever, perceptive look at life in the big city that goes for the
jugular rather than the heartstrings.  These SHORT CUTS are somewhat
cold cuts, but they're mighty tasty.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 short cuts:  8.</PRE>
