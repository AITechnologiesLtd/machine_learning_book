<P>Plot: Truman Burbank leads an ordinary untroubled life as an insurance 
salesman and a married man. Unaware of it the entire town he lives in is 
an artificial construct, everyone around him really being an actor and 
he really the subject of `The Truman Show', a reality tv show that is 
watched by millions where every thing that has happened since he was 
born has been scripted and his every reaction filmed. But a series of 
mishaps - a fallen spotlight, his accidental tuning into a radio channel 
monitoring him, the reappearance of the actor playing his father who was 
killed off - make him begin to suspect the artificiality of his reality. 
He holds a secret longing for an extra that once tried to tell him the 
truth before being caught and makes a concerted attempt to leave the 
town to find her, while the entire cast and crew make every effort to 
stop him.</P>
<P>‘The Truman Show' was written by New Zealander Andrew Niccol. Niccol 
made an impressive writing/directing debut with last year's ‘Gattaca' 
and continues to impress again here. It is possible in ‘Truman' that 
Niccol may have been inspired by Bernard Tavernier's `La Mort en 
Direct/Deathwatch' (1979) which was set in a future where death was so 
rare that a woman with a rare terminal condition became secretly without 
her knowledge the subject of a tv show. However Niccol's treatment of 
the theme here is remarkable and unique, making for that rarity of a 
film that is wholly original.</P>
<P>The central premise in ‘Truman' is that Jim Carrey makes the discovery 
that his entire life is part of a tv show that is being scripted and 
played out by the people around him for a watching audience of billions. 
One is not spoiling any big surprise by telling this as the film's 
publicity machine makes one aware of this from the start. Half the fun 
in the film comes from its' setting up Carrey's idyllic lifestyle and 
then letting us watching the subtle intrusions the tv show make into the 
familiarity of its ‘reality' - a crowd crossing the street suddenly 
freezing as a feedback whine jams their earpieces; people contriving to 
twist situations so they can stop and conduct product endorsements or 
push Carrey into shot up against advertising billboards; the marvellous 
little excuses that keep getting invented every time something goes 
wrong or Carrey tries to leave the town - there's an hilarious visit to 
a travel agent's office where the background is filled with travel 
posters which instead of offering invitations to sunny destinations 
advertise in the direst tones possible the hazards of travel. The film 
even starts to cleverly play with audience perceptions - what one takes 
to be a standard musical score playing throughout is revealed as being 
played by background musicians; or the moment the hero's best friend 
makes a heartfelt plea "Would I lie to you ?" and the film pulls away to 
reveal this as a scripted line being fed into an earpiece. Most of the 
shots in the film mimic the camera shots of reality tv shows. Even the 
opening credits are for the tv show rather than for the film.</P>
<P>Peter Weir becomes the first director to tone down and actually obtain a 
relatively sane performance out of Jim Carrey. All of Carrey's previous 
films - ‘The Mask' (1994), ‘The Cable Guy' (1996), ‘Liar Liar' (1997) 
and the ‘Ace Ventura' movies - have been founded completely as veritable 
amphitheatres for Carrey's rafter-rattling histrionics. Weir is the 
first director to tone Carrey's irritatingly loud facial gymnastics down 
and allow the story on its own to carry the film. One can't help but 
think a more average-seeming performer might have been better suited to 
the film but still Carrey acquits himself capably upon this occasion - 
although ironically only by failing to dominate the film.</P>
<P>The conceptual audacity of both ‘Gattaca' and ‘Truman' show Niccol as 
one of the most promising young writers around at the moment. Niccol 
indeed has the ability of all good science-fiction writers to construct 
scenarios that are extrapolated from a single ‘What If' premise - how 
would a genetic dropout survive in a world founded on genetic purity ? 
what if a man found his entire life was being staged as a tv show ? - 
and to work the premises to thoroughly logical conclusions. In both 
cases Niccol intriguingly creates heroes whose entire struggles centre 
on having to outwit and subvert an entire social order that is set 
against them A quite remarkable film.</P>
