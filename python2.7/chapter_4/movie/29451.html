<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Roger Corman does another work by Edgar Allan Poe, in a film many critics
considered his best from his Poe cycle. It's a visual treat, thanks to the lush
camera work of Nicolas Roeg, but leaves a lot to be desired in its wooden story
and characterizations. </P>
<P>Prince Prospero (Price) is a diabolical 12th century Italian prince, a
worshipper of satan, who lives in a castle and amuses himself with orgiastic
pleasures and having his victims die in depraved ways for his amusement, as he
has his castle sycophants act as pet dogs for all his whims. They're happy to
stay there in safety because the plague has ravaged the local town and
countryside. </P>
<P>The film opens as a masked man, supposedly a holy man, dressed in red, meets an
old lady in the woods, turns a white rose into a red rose, and tells the old
lady to tell her townspeople "The day of deliverance is at hand." </P>
<P>Meanwhile Prospero has taken a beautiful village girl, Francesca (Asher), and
tries to force her to choose between saving the life of her lover Gino (Weston)
or her father (Green). She refuses to make a choice, as Prospero threatens to
then kill both. He tries to shake her faith in virtue and Christianity. </P>
<P>Prospero plans for a masked ball at midnight: in the meantime he brands the
breasts of a beautiful Satanist woman, Julianna (Courts); Alfredo (Patrick
Magee), one of his sycophant guests, is burned to death while clad as a gorilla
by "Hop Frog" (Skip Martin), Prospero's demonic jester; and, a royal visitor,
Scarlatti, is refused entrance to the castle and killed with an arrow by
Prospero after begging for his life to be spared by offering him his wife. </P>
<P>The point of the film is Vincent Price's absolutely diabolical performance, no
campy routine here. It's a performance showing pure evil and the reward is at
the end watching him get his just desserts. Charles Beaumont's script was
intelligent and subtle in making its case about devil-worshipping. But the film
itself left me with a cold feeling. </P>
