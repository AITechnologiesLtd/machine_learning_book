<P>There are few movies from 1996 with a more realistic look at everyday life
than 'Marvin's Room.'  Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton play sisters who haven't
seen each other for twenty years.  Meryl Streep is a frumpy and belligerent
woman with a large chip on her shoulder whose course personality has had a
devistating effect on her seventeen year old son (Leonardo DiCaprio) who has
burned down their home and is sent to a mental institution.  She has another
young son in tow and her Ohio lifestyle and potential career in cosmetology
is disrupted by a call from her sister (Keaton), a woman of family dedication
and sunshine personality who has just been diagnosed with leukemia and needs
here sister and two nephews to come down to her Florida home and test as
potential bone marrow matches.  All the while Keaton is nursing her weak
minded old aunt (Gwen Verdon) and her bed ridden father (Hume Cronyn).
 Everything goes fine in the process of breaking the ice after a relationship
gap of twenty years between the sisters but hidden feelings begins to surface
and the family is brought to terms of recognizing and confronting each
other's faults and frailties.  This movie is a stimulating and relentlessly
emotional odyssey with touching and heartfelt performances from a
professional cast of actors resembling the visuals of a stage play.  The
movie has no pretentious Hollywood trappings and director Jerry Zaks earns
high marks for his interpretation of presetning a simple fact in life which
is "you can't choose your family."  'Marvin's Room' is headed for that
treasure chest of celluloid to become a burined treasure.  When Robert DeNiro
is asked to do a meaningless bit part as Keaton's doctor and makes it
memorable then you know this has got to be a gem.</P>
