<PRE>                                 SHOWGIRLS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     What is Joe Eszterhas going to do *now?*  First came FLASHDANCE.
Then he shocked us with BASIC INSTINCT.  Now he writes SHOWGIRLS, an
ultra-explicit NC-17 drama about a Las Vegas showgirl who goes from
nobody to "Goddess" by playing the Power Game better than everyone
else.</P>
<P>     No longer the innocent wallflower from "Saved By the Bell,"
Elizabeth Berkley has been transformed (by an excellent plastic
surgeon) into Nomi Malone, a sexy vamp who is nothing but trouble.
This role is going to haunt Berkley for the rest of her life, if not
longer, largely due to the fact that she is pretty much naked in every
scene.  We're talking "Totally Nude," no holds barred.  And not just
Berkley, there's a whole harem of strippers to support her.  They
parade around in their scanties so much (and so well) that it's pretty
easy to forget about little details like plot, acting, and character
development.</P>
<P>     But at least these things exist in SHOWGIRLS.  The plot is typical
Eszterhas:  Nomi has a shady past and wants to start over.  A whole
bunch of slimy guys get in her way.  And Eszterhas is never one to
forget to throw in a little lesbian subplot (in this case, with Gina
Gershon, as Nomi's arch-rival Cristal).  The acting is as much as one
can expect from essentially two-dimensional characters, most of which
are carbon copies of each other.  Thankfully, Nomi holds our attention
well, and while Berkley hams up the role to an extreme, she's still
interesting to watch.  For Nomi, *everything* is a show.</P>
<P>     The setting really makes this film worthwhile.  Director Paul
Verhoeven (TOTAL RECALL) slices open the underbelly of Sin City for all
to see, getting behind the scenes and facades of the big casinos by
taking us directly into the action.  We're on the stage when Nomi makes
her big entrances; everything is raw and vivid.  There's no sense of
"seduction across a crowded room."  It's laid out in Technicolor
through a two word image:  pure lust.</P>
<P>     The dance numbers are truly incredible--this is *not* FAME.  Your
$6.50 movie ticket will get you admission to a good half dozen shows
during the course of the film.  That's a lot cheaper than Vegas.</P>
<P>     In closing, I feel compelled to say something meaningful about
gratuitous nudity and sex in American cinema, but I won't.  Yes, it's
extreme, but this story really won't work any other way.  (And after 45
minutes, you really don't notice any more.)  I'm glad the creators
fought to keep it this way, and I applaud the risks they took to get it
on the screen.  It's a rough world out there, especially in Vegas, and
it's a full-sensory experience that simply can't be censored.</P>
