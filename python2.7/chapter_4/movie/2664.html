<PRE>                                THE LION KING
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  With the exception of BEAUTY AND
     THE BEAST this may be the best Disney animated feature
     since FANTASIA.  Rather than distorting an existing
     story, the filmmakers have created a myth brand new, but
     with elements going back to Jason and Pelias or Hamlet
     and Claudius.  Some of the artwork is spectacular.
     Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>     With the success of THE LITTLE MERMAID Walt Disney Studios returned
in a big way to making animated feature films.  It looks like it was a
good decision, since some of the best animated feature films they or
anyone have ever made were made by Disney in this period.  The formula
has always been to take a well-known fairy tale or children's classic
and retell it, usually distorting it nearly out of recognition.  I have
often wondered why they don't just write their own stories like they do
for Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.  They have finally chosen to do a film
that is their own story entirely--well mostly.  Actually rather than
taking a fairy tale and very freely adapting it they have chosen to
retell an archetypical myth and move it to an African setting.  The
story is basically "The Return of the True King."  Simba is really Jason
or Arjuna or Hamlet or Aslan returning to defeat the usurper on his
throne.  It was a good idea for a film and it is told with a good deal
of style.</P>
<P>     The story begins with a prologue of all the animals in a kingdom
coming to see their new-born prince, the young Simba.  It is a powerful
scene beautifully rendered with impressive art and music.  The latteris
rendered by Hans Zimmer's beautiful interpretations of African folk
music, much like his work on THE POWER OF ONE.  Young Simba (voiced by
Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is the son of the great and powerful Mufasa, the
reigning Lion King (James Earl Jones).  One wonders how much a
wildebeest an antelope really loves this reigning family, given that he
might well become the family's next meal.</P>
<P>     As a cub Simba is fascinated by everything in the world including
his brooding uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons).  Scar has been waiting for the
day Mufasa would die and Scar would succeed him.  With the birth of
Simba that hope has been snatched away ... unless perchance something
nasty should befall both Mufasa and Simba.  Perhaps with an alliance
with the smirking hyenas--currently exiled to the dark regions of the
kingdom--something nasty can be arranged to happen.</P>
<P>     In the classic Disney films like SLEEPING BEAUTY and SNOW WHITE AND
THE SEVEN DWARFS the villains are usually far more interesting than the
heroes.  The margin is still there, but is starting to narrow a little.
Belle in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST was every bit as interesting as the
villain Gaston.  This time around Mufasa and Simba are still just a bit
handsome and empty.  So it is hardly surprising that Scar is the most
watchable character in the film.  The smirking hyenas, however, hold
their own for audience attention.  Their clowning around making fun of
Mufasa really is a lot of fun, villains or not.  A carefree meerkat and
warthog who figure into the later portions of the film make far more
interesting sidekicks with far more personality than Disney himself
would have created.  Note how much more engaging they are than the mice
in CINDERELLA, for example.</P>
<P>     For no apparent good reason, name actors are chosen to voice many
of the character.  Matthew Broderick is the young adult Simba, but does
not seem to need to do a whole lot anyone else his age could have done.
Jeremy Irons does give some real personality to Scar, though after
hearing him attempt to sing on of the film's songs, my suggestion is
that he should hold on to his day job.  James Earl Jones does Mufasa and
surprisingly we interpret his deep voice as noble, even after hearingit
so often as the less-than-noble Darth Vader.  But again only Irons seems
to give his character much that any moderate actor could not give him.</P>
<P>     Some of the artwork with majestic African scenery is the best that
has appeared in a Disney film.  Disney, of course, always had great
animation, but often his artwork often left something to be desired.It
might be cute, but was rarely impressive.  Here the art and animation
work beautifully together.  An early scene of birds flying over a
waterfall brought gasps from adults in the audience.  There are more
nice experimental touches in the visuals, playing with focus or having
characters appear out of dust.  This is a film in which the visual
interest goes well beyond the animation.</P>
<P>     Moments of direction are also very good.  After the prologue the
screen goes silent for the title of the film to appear and it is far
more dramatic than any chord that could have been played.  This also has
one of the better scripts of Disney animated features.  I think that The
producers realize that much of the audience is parents bringing
children, and there are many creative allusions and puns in the script
that children will miss but adults will appreciate.  There is even a
liberal dash of Swahili, and those who can recognize it can appreciate
that.  And for the kids who like that sort of thing, there are moments
of grossness.  And there were children in the audience who seemed to
liked being pleasantly grossed out by realistic details like animals
eating insects and grubs.</P>
<P>     One problem with the story is the whole theme of the hyenas.  They
are almost too likable for the film's own good.  Certainly they are
cynical, but considering their exile they have a right to be.  Their
motivation is that by any means necessary that they not go hungry.
Somehow that does not sound like so villainous a motivation.  The lions
who have exiled them are certainly not missing any meals.  On the face
of it such a Grand Order, a circle of life that exiles one of its
species, deserves to be toppled.  Why are hyenas chosen as the villains?
Probably because we find them unpleasing in appearance.  In any case the
film seems to take the (racist?) point of view that the hyenas are
intrinsically evil and in a well-run world should be banished.  When the
hyenas are given freedom the land withers, though just why is never
really explained.  The film seems to have a subtext of all the pretty
animals do cooperate and get along under a benevolent dictatorship
except for the ones who are born into an ugly and evil species.  These
uglies get thrown out of the society because if they got enough to eat
it would spoil everything.  The grand order of things assumes that
hyenas should stay confined to their ghetto, outside "the circle of
life" and the natural order of things is destroyed by letting them into
the circle.  One can question the message children will get from this.
Outwardly the film has a love of African rhythms and language and yearns
for a united world--everyone but hyenas united.  But the core is justa
bit ugly and scary.</P>
<P>     With that one objection, and clearly this film is not unique in
that regard, I would say that this is a rewarding film for both children
and adults.  Walt might have found reason to object to parts of it, but
he never made a better animated feature.  I rate it a low +2 on the -4
to +4 scale.</P>
