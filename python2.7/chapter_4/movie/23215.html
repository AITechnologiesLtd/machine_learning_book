<P>The titular violin is more than just an instrument. Any object that survives
for centuries and plays an integral role in the lives of numerous people from
numerous cultures is something more than just a piece of wood and some strings.
In The Red Violin, the violin is a manipulative device which society revolves
around. The beautiful violin, as it passes into the hands of several different
kinds of humans, is coveted, cherished, envied, and rivaled to a point where it
controls the emotions and actions of the individuals around it. There is
something uniquely vivacious in such an inanimate object. </P>
<P>The Red Violin is not only a film which celebrates the power of music in past
and present society, but it also, using the violin as a central focus, examines
cultures from around the world, just how different and similar they are. The
similarity is that music is an influential factor of their lives, however the
motive of why it is so influential differentiates the cultures. Some people
desire the violin because they desire money, fame, and ultimate power. Others
lust for the violin because it is a way of expressing their true self. A way to
speak out to others that is not possible with the use of words or gestures. The
violin, which enters the lives of the supporting characters, is almost like a
genie in a lamp. Inside it contains the answers to all of their problems.
However, when these victims get their hands on something so potent the outcome
is either total greed or grief. </P>
<P>This Canadian film, from co-writer/director Francois Girard, parallels the
creation of the violin in Italy to its highly anticipated auction in Montreal,
Quebec. At first, we know there is something special about the violin. Created
by a skilled Italian merchant in the 1600's, the instrument is originally made
for his newborn son. However, when his wife and child die during the delivery,
the merchant finds the most obscure way of putting his late family into his
work. In Quebec, during present time, many different nationalities including
the Chinese, Italian, French, and English are bidding top dollars for the
merchant's work. From these two scenes, we know the violin has traveled a long
way before it has reached the auction. The Red Violin tells of its journey. </P>
<P>The film is split into five sections, each in a different language because the
settings are in different countries. This type of universal style reminded me
of Jim Jarmusch's creative Night on Earth, which follows the lives of taxi
drivers in different countries. Unfortunately like Night on Earth, The Red
Violin contains some memorable segments and some awful segments.  The parts
with the more famous actors, Greta Scacchi and Samuel L. Jackson were both dull
and banal especially in comparison to the remaining segments, such as the
Austrian boy pressured into performing well and the Chinese Communist woman who
secretly adored Western music. </P>
<P>The Red Violin frequently displays the violin staring back at you with a
particularly creepy appearance. The violin, which gradually gets more fragile
as it travels through time, stands out from others of the same structure for
some inexplicable reason, maybe because we know of it's energetic past or of
its odd Frankenstein-like creation. For some mysterious reason, it is
frightening to watch. </P>
<PRE>Grade: ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
