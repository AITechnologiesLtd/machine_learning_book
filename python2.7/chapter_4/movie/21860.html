CLASSIC CINEMA 101: STEVEN SPIELBERG'S JAWS
A review excerpt by Joe Barlow

<P>"You yell 'Barracuda!' and everyone says, 'Huh? What?'; You yell
'Shark!' and we've got a panic on our hands on the Fourth of July."
--Larry Vaughn, Mayor of Amity, Jaws </P>
<P>In 1975, a young director named Steven Spielberg single-handedly
created a new movie genre--the summer blockbuster. The twenty-five
year-old moviemaker's third film, Jaws, shook the industry with such
force that its effects are still being felt today. It forever
shattered Hollywood's belief that people don't watch movies during the
summer; for this reason alone, every action extravaganza that followed
it, from Star Wars to Independence Day to Spielberg's own Jurassic
Park and The Lost World, owes a debt of gratitude to this tale of
terror. Jaws continues to serve as a benchmark of suspense cinema, and
still retains its visceral power nearly a quarter-century after its
initial release. </P>
<P>Moonlight sparkles on the ocean. A nude swimmer plunges into the cool
water, splitting the waves with a splash. She swims. She floats. She
laughs.  She dies. </P>
<P>Martin Brody (Roy Schieder), the chief of police in the idyllic
seaside town of Amity, is quick to react to the news of the shark
attack. He sensibly believes the beaches should be closed until the
leviathan can be vanquished. The townsfolk, however, are less certain:
Amity is a summer town which depends on tourist dollars for its
survival. Every day the beaches are closed, the town grows poorer;
although Brody believes that safety is the more important concern, he
is overruled by Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton). Soon the beaches are
open once again... with disastrous results. </P>
<P>Brody calls for help from the Oceanographic Institute, and a young
shark expert named Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) is sent to assist.
The duo teams up with a crusty local salt named Quint (Robert Shaw),
who offers to kill the shark--for a fee, of course. </P>
<P>The story at the heart of Steven Spielberg's Jaws revolves not so much
around the creature which has taken up residence in the waters of
Amity, but around the townsfolk who are forced to deal with the
consequences of its presence. It's a subtle distinction, but it makes
all the difference. Jaws is not a monster flick; it's the story of
three men facing a seemingly insurmountable force of nature. In
keeping the emphasis on the characters rather than the shark, as the
film's three wretched sequels did, Spielberg crafted a cinematic work
that still fascinates and mesmerizes. Human moments dominate the
tale--take a look at the oft-parodied "injury comparison" scene aboard
Quint's boat, the Ocra, and tell me whether you saw anything so clever
or affecting in, say, Independence Day. </P>
