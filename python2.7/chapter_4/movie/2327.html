                                [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Eric Walker
                        Copyright 1994 Eric Walker</PRE>
<P><HR>NOTE:  The following message contains SPOILERS for the movie
SCHINDLER'S LIST.  If you do not want the movie's plot given away,
then READ NO FURTHER!<HR></P>
<P>     At some point in a director's life, he may be seized with an urge
to make an Epic that will be remembered, he hopes, as his Magnum Opus.
He pours his heart and soul into his work, producing a movie that
expresses his inner feelings, baring his soul for the world to see.</P>
<P>     For instance, in 1980 Martin Scorsese had sunk into a depression,
and he felt that his life was nearing its end.  So he decided to make
one "last" movie, something that would bring all of his emotions and
feelings to the surface; it would serve as a cleansing, so to speak.
The result was one of the greatest "biopic" dramas ever made: RAGING
BULL, a brutal, shattering portrait of a man whose greatest enemy was
himself.</P>
<P>     Other directors have created their own "epic" films, though not
all have been successful: Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900; Francis Coppola's
APOCALYPSE NOW; Michael Cimino's disastrous HEAVEN'S GATE; even Sergei
Eisenstein's IVAN THE TERRIBLE, Walt Disney's FANTASIA and the
legendary GREED by von Stroheim.  It's as though the artist is seized
by the need to produce something memorable, something that will be
remembered even after it disappears from the theaters.</P>
<P>     Pauline Kael notes that these personal, shrive-my-soul projects
differ from so-called Hollywood "epic sagas," in that they're made with
something else in mind besides raking in bucks at the box office:</P>
<P>     "This form of gigantism is not to be confused with the producer-
initiated or studio-initiated big-budget pictures (CLEOPATRA, DOCTOR
DOLITTLE, THE TOWERING INFERNO [or TERMINATOR 2 or JURASSIC PARK, if I
might add], and so on).  The artist-initiated epic is an obsessive
testing of possibilities, and often it comes out of an overwhelming
desire to express what an artist thinks are the unconscious needs of
the public.  It comes, too, from a conviction, or a hope, that if you
give the popular audiences the greatest you have in you they will
respond.  The moviemaker has an idealistic belief that no matter how
corrupted mass taste is, people still retain the capacity to receive a
vision.  These epics try to vault over the film industry and go
directly to the public."  ("Hail, Folly!" from Kael's "When The Lights
Go Down.")</P>
<P>     Which brings me to SCHINDLER'S LIST, the story of one man and the
Holocaust, from the most "Hollywood" of Hollywood directors: Steven
Spielberg.</P>
<P>     Spielberg, of course, is the man who earned more money for one
Hollywood studio than perhaps any other director.  His name is
synonymous with God in the land of box-office receipts and account
books--so when he announced that he wanted to shoot a drama about the
Holocaust that was over three hours long, and in black-and-white, no
less, then who was in a position to say no?  No one else in Hollywood
has the power and influence to get a studio to spend so much money on a
film that is almost guaranteed to lose money.  In this day and age, how
many moviegoers are willing to watch a black-and-white movie?   Why
risk so much when you could turn in a quick profit filming something
like WAYNE'S WORLD 2 or MRS. DOUBTFIRE?</P>
<P>     But Spielberg has aspired to be something more than a director of
action movies and box-office hits.  He wants to be an auteur filmmaker,
to produce something that can stand up in the roster of cinema greats
like 8 1/2, THE THIRD MAN, THE AFRICAN QUEEN, NASHVILLE--and RAGING
BULL, among others.</P>
<P>     Spielberg has been trying to grow up, to escape the image of the
Disney wanna-be child at heart who can only make light-hearted "family
entertainment" movies.  His previous attempts at making "adult" drama
have met with mixed acceptance at best: THE COLOR PURPLE was a fine
movie, but he merely went through the motions with EMPIRE OF THE SUN
and ALWAYS, and thus he failed.</P>
<P>     The fatal flaw in his movies has been that of character: he has
trouble bringing truly "lifelike" characters to the screen in realistic
settings.  While he's given us larger-than-life heroes like Indiana
Jones, or everyday people in fantastic situations (as in CLOSE
ENCOUNTERS and JAWS), he's used fantasy as a crutch to escape from the
real world.  He says so himself when referring to SCHINDLER'S LIST as
his true awakening.</P>
<P>     But is SCHINDLER'S LIST a true rebirth for Spielberg?</P>
<P>     It's a well-crafted movie, and it has many scenes that will stand
out in your mind for a long time after it ends.  But it only scratches
the surface of its characters, including Oskar Schindler himself, and
it never lets us see them as real people.</P>
<P>     This movie is little more than a World War II melodrama
masquerading as great entertainment.</P>
<P>     Spielberg's attempt to produce a human-centered "epic" falls into
the classic "Hollywood" style of storytelling: it has clear-cut good
guys and bad guys, lots of suspense, a lily-white hero to root for, and
a happy ending--just like every other Spielberg movie.</P>
<P>     And yet, this is still a good movie.  The acting is superb, even
if the actors' roles are limited; the cinematography fresh and
energetic; the use of black-and-white superb; and the editing keeps the
story flowing so that we are never bored.  As entertainment, it's
certainly one of the better films to be released in a year where we've
had some very good movies.</P>
<P>     But as a character portrait of an enigmatic man, the movie fails.
It's based on the story of Oskar Schindler, a Nazi Party member who
bucked the system in the heart of Germany's occupation of Poland, and
who managed managed to save the lives of over a thousand Jewish
citizens of Poland by employing them as laborers in a war-supplies
factory.  Initially, Schindler supplied the army with basics such as
pots and pans, but near the end of the war, out of necessity, he moved
his base of operations to central Europe and ran a munitions factory.</P>
<P>     Over the course of the war, Schindler became very rich.  He didn't
have to pay his workers because they were Jews, and he exploited their
labors for his personal benefit.  But by the end of the war he was a
changed man, and he spent his entire fortune in bribes and "favors" to
Nazi officials to make sure that his operation, and his favored
treatment of the Jews, was never noticed.</P>
<P>     What made Schindler tick?  What caused him to undergo such a
drastic change in his character?  Was he really the heaven-sent angel
portrayed in the movie?</P>
<P>     Of course he wasn't.  Very few people in history turn out to be as
pure of heart as they're portrayed in the movies.  They're far more
complicated than this, and rare is the movie that dares to dig
underneath and let us understand just why a person does what he does.</P>
<PRE>     SCHINDLER'S LIST does not dig very far.</PRE>
<P>     The story's basic flaw lies in the screenplay, where the
characters are not fully fleshed out.  Steven Zaillian, the
screenwriter, knows how to write characters as plot devices--but he
can't give them the "feel" of human beings.  He made a similar mistake
in this summer's SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER (which he directed), in
which every character had a part to play, but they never seemed like
anything more than living plot devices.  For example, Ben Kingsley's
role as the professional chess tutor was a character of pure logic and
no emotion; he existed solely on that level.</P>
<P>     Here he plays the role of Itzhak Stern, Schindler's accountant;
once again, his character seems to be single-mindedly devoted to one
purpose.  He is Schindler's conscience, there to serve as a gopher and
to occasionally remind Schindler that he could get in a lot of trouble
if his true motives are ever discovered.  But that's all we know of
him, and we never feel any emotion for him as a human being--because
here he's not one.</P>
<P>     Schindler himself begins the film as a war profiteer.  Profit is
everything to him, and he bases his cooking-utensil factory on the
cheap labor he gets from employing Jewish workers.  But he sees the
reality of Nazi persecution for himself--and he doesn't even see it up
close, the way we do; rather, he only gets a distant glimpse of the
slaughter in the Krakow ghetto, from horseback.  This, of course, is
irony: he's rich and powerful, and this power has come from the
exploitation of other people who have no rights of their own.</P>
<P>     The symbolic importance of the girl in the red coat is the
"marker" by which we can judge Schindler's transformation into a
selfless angel of mercy--a complete 180-degree turn, which cheapens
and simplifies the actual real-life awakening of Schindler to the
horrors of war.  Before seeing her, he is greedy and heartless;
afterwards, he's an altruistic humanitarian.</P>
<P>     The film takes pains to portray Schindler as a good guy: it
downplays his casual use and abuse of the women working for him, so
that we can easily forgive him of this "petty" fault.  Even after the
Krakow massacre, he continues to amass wealth and to befriend important
Nazi officials--but we know now that it's just a ruse, and that he's
doing it to ensure the survival of his "employees."  The movie would
have us believe that he didn't enjoy wealth and power, because we never
see him basking in the fruits of his labors.</P>
<P>     Therefore, Schindler is a Good Guy, and everything he does is for
the good of his fellow men.</P>
<PRE>     The problem is, people like that only exist in the movies.</PRE>
<P>     Still, Liam Neeson plays this role to the hilt.  After turning in
a stellar performance in Woody Allen's HUSBANDS AND WIVES, he has
managed to land some very choice roles in recent Hollywood movies.  His
star is on the rise, and he is being showered with praise for this
role.  He and the other actors turn in good, solid performances,
underplaying their roles and never acting preachy or bombastic.</P>
<P>     This is a plus for Ralph Fiennes, who portrays the evil Nazi
commander Amon Goeth as a true monster.  He casually sits on his seat
overlooking the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, shooting Jews because he has
nothing better to do.  He's heartless and cruel, and while Fiennes
could have easily slipped into caricature here, he maintains the
character as believable.</P>
<P>     Goeth believes, like a true Nazi, that Jews are sub-creatures and
less than human.  But after he talks with and befriends Oskar
Schindler, he gains a soul and a conscience--temporarily.  Here the
film goes even further to portray Schindler as a pure angel: he
inspires pity in the worst demonic dregs of humankind.  But Geothe is
the Bad Guy, and his fate is inevitable--as we see at the end of the
film, when Schindler is rewarded and he is not.</P>
<P>     We're also given glimpses of of the Jews themselves, though once
again they're portrayed as plot devices, and not as human beings.  The
Jewish citizens of Poland exist in this film as a prize to be won,
either by the Nazis or by Schindler.  The movie takes pains to
emphasize the fact that no one under German occupation knew whether he
would live or die--but because of the conventions of the motion
picture, with Schindler as the Jews' guardian angel, we know that their
safety is assured.  Sadly, this lessens the impact of such scenes as a
card game played between Schindler and Goeth, with the life of the
Jewish servant girl Helen Hirsch hanging in the balance.  We know
exactly what's going to happen; likewise, when Itzhak Stern pleads with
Schindler for him to take an elderly couple (who obviously can't work
in a factory), we know what their eventual fate is.</P>
