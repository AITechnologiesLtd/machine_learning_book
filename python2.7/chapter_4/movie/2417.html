<P>     Take a typical romantic comedy, add a dash of Cameron Crow's
SINGLES, and top it off with a little WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, and you get
REALITY BITES, Ben Stiller's feature film debut, and the movie that
draws out the most memorable performance from Winona Ryder since
HEATHERS (THE AGE OF INNOCENCE not excepted).</P>
<P>     Following college graduation, four close friends--Lelaina Pierce
(Winona Ryder), Troy Dyer (Ethan Hawke), Vicki Miner (Janeane
Garofalo), and Sammy Gray (Steve Zahn)--are still hanging out with
each other.  In fact, after Troy loses his job and moves in with
Lelaina and Vicki, three of them are living together.  It's life
without a direction, however.  Vicki is working at the Gap, Troy is
unemployed after being fired from his twelfth job, and Lelaina is on
the slow track working for a local morning television show.  Their
personal lives are no less settled, with the promiscuous Vicki obsessed
with getting AIDS, and Lelaina trying to choose romantically between
best friend Troy and an MTV-type station manager yuppie named Michael
Grates (Ben Stiller).</P>
<P>     REALITY BITES starts with a lot of promise, but it doesn't take
long for its freshness to wear thin.  Struggling for the feel of
SINGLES, the film matches neither the quirkiness nor the honest insight
of the 1992 feature.  It doesn't take long for the central romantic
conflict to become established, and from then to the conclusion,
REALITY BITES follows a number of standard formulas.</P>
<P>     The characters are all types, with little or no depth beyond the
expected.  This is true not only of the central figures, but the
supporting ones as well.  It becomes tiresome after a while to
continually make accurate predictions of what each character is going
to do.</P>
<P>     Commercialism runs rampant, as well.  Some of the product
placements are grossly obvious (so obvious that I'm willing to give
director Ben Stiller the benefit of the doubt and wonder if he isn't
satirizing their use in other movies), and the soundtrack has all the
marks of something designed to sell CDs and tapes.  At least when Troy
is required to sing, it's actually Ethan Hawke dubbing the vocals.</P>
<P>     There are some clever moments, the best of which are the satires
of MTV- type "cutting edge" programming.  Also enjoyable is John
Mahoney as a Phil Donahue-like morning talk show host who's affable in
front of the camera, but nasty offstage.</P>
<P>     Winona Ryder turns in a strong performance as Lelaina, but she is
often upstaged by Janeane Garofalo, who has all the best one-liners.
Both work well together, and their impromptu dance to "My Sharona"
(shown in all the commercials) is one of REALITY BITES' silliest
highlights.</P>
<P>     Would that the chemistry between Ms. Ryder and her male co-stars
was as strong.  There are no sparks between her and Ethan Hawke or Ben
Stiller.  This makes it difficult to care about the central romance.
Also, from the beginning, there's never really any doubt about who
Lelaina is going to end up with.</P>
<P>     Frankly, I expected more from REALITY BITES.  It's certainly a
watchable film, but it lacks any semblance of originality.  Beneath a
thin veneer of style, all the old cliches and formulas of typical
romantic comedies lie buried.  A number of people, especially fans of
Ms. Ryder, will be delighted by this film, but I can't add my voice to
their acclaim.  REALITY BITES is far too ordinary.</P>
