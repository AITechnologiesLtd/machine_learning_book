<PRE>Rating: ½* out of  * * * *</PRE>
<PRE>Rated: R for violence and language.</PRE>
<PRE>Running Time: 93 minutes</PRE>
<P>Starring: Keanu Reeves, James Spader, Marisa Tomei.</P>
<PRE>Directed by: Joe Charbonic</PRE>
<P>When I first saw the previews for Joe Charbonic's new serial killer thriller, 
I thought "Hey maybe Keanu might come out with a somewhat decent movie". I 
was somewhat disappointed with "The Matrix" though I liked it never-the-less. 
I went into "The Watcher" expecting a somewhat good serial killer flick and 
walked out with a headache, some confusion and wondering why they wanted to 
make this movie in the first place. I may be the only one to give this movie 
this low of a rating, but when you have to sit through a movie, checking your 
watch every five minutes to see if it is over yet, then it is definately bad 
to me.</P>
<P>James Spader plays a detective who has been haunted from memories of his 
past. A killer has been following him trying to latch on to him, after he did 
something horrible to his girlfriend. He has a therapist (Marisa Tomei) who 
is trying to help him through all this trauma he is going through. Now the 
killer (Keanu Reeves) is sending him pictures of the girls he is going to 
kill, and Spader has one day to try to find them before its too late. Now all 
of New York City has to strap down and try to find these girls before the 
body count becomes bigger.</P>
<P>Jumbled plot? Bad writing? Sloppy Direction? Flat Acting? Thats pretty much 
what all this movie has in it. First of all the plot, if that is what you 
want me to call it, is so underdeveloped that is painfully confusing and so 
predictable that by the end of the movie I leaned over to my girlfriend and 
said "Let's go". I wasn't going to be insulted anymore, but she insisted on 
staying saying it has to be good somewhere somehow. Of course when I left the 
theatre she thought it was good, while I thought the opposite. I had to 
wonder why Keanu Reeves a somewhat talented actor chose such a terrible role 
as a serial killer, who isn't believable as a serial killer, nor does he fit 
the serial killer role.</P>
<P>James Spader has never been someone in Hollyweird I have liked, and in "The 
Watcher" he doesn't prove to me he can really be anyone I will like, after 
starring in the huge flop earlier this year "Supernova" he really hasn't had 
much in the way of a job. His character is completely and utterly 
underdeveloped and we know nothing about him to like or dislike. Marisa Tomei 
is one of the top-billed stars and has around fifteen minutes of total screen 
time. </P>
<P>Joe Charbonic's direction is not good either, and some of the sloppily made 
scenes in the movie are so dumb that I started to get a pounding headache. A 
five year old could have made a better film than this mess. The script is 
somewhat good, but the dialogue that comes out the actors mouth is stiffly 
said, and doesn't make much sense sometimes.</P>
<P>Could "The Watcher" have been a good movie? Its highly doubtful and in the 
end product it clearly shows that Hollywood is starting to run out of steam 
in their movies. With "Almost Famous" coming out in a few weeks, I'm highly 
waiting for a really really good movie worth the watch, and worth the wait of 
a trip to the movie theatre, until then though I tell you to avoid "The 
Watcher" if anything possible, go see "The Way of the Gun" its not great but 
at least its better than this.</P>
