<P>     Two minutes into THE CRUDE OASIS, we know we've entered David Lynch 
territory, even if the producer/director/writer of this film is Alex 
Graves.  This low budget, noir character study, which takes place on the 
barren plains of Kansas, has the kind of atmosphere and quirkiness that 
has become Lynch's trademark.  Graves borrows it to his own ends here, 
but, like Lynch, sometimes becomes so mesmerized by the weird trappings 
that he momentarily loses sight of the story. </P>
<P>     With the exception of a few minor itinerants, the population of THE 
CRUDE OASIS is three:  Karen Webb (Jennifer Taylor), a lonely, depressed 
woman going through the motions in a loveless marriage; her philandering 
husband, Jim (Robert Peterson), who is having an open affair while 
expecting complete fidelity from his wife; and Harley Underwood (Aaron 
Shields), a mysterious gas station attendant whose image has been 
invading Karen's nightmares.  The interaction of this trio, or, more 
particularly, of Karen with the other two, represents the sum and 
substance of the story. </P>
<P>     One of the problems with THE CRUDE OASIS is that two-thirds of the 
characters have little depth or breadth.  While we get a few glimpses 
into Harley's psyche, the script keeps him at arm's length, and he never 
seems more than a plot device to catalyze Karen's actions.  Emmy-award 
winner Aaron Shields attempts to bring some life to his on-screen 
personae, but the script doesn't offer him a whole lot of latitude.  
Faring even worse is Jim, who comes across as cold and lifeless.  
Portrayed mechanically by Robert Peterson, this man could be a robot for 
all the emotion he displays.   </P>
<P>     Fortunately, the centerpiece is Karen, and she is far better 
realized than her male counterparts.  Actress Jennifer Taylor, appearing 
in her first feature (after a lengthy stint on a daytime soap opera), 
successfully conveys Karen's ever-mercurial moods.  As the character 
gradually comes to realize that her life doesn't have to be chained by 
the expectations of others, Taylor allows us to see real growth.  This 
is not a standout performance, but it's effective. </P>
<P>     THE CRUDE OASIS has a dream-like pace that is occasionally 
punctuated by brief, nightmarish interludes.  For the most part, all the 
"action" takes place deep within Karen's troubled soul.  Surface changes 
-- what few there are -- are designed to echo more fundamental 
transformations.  With two of three characters never attaining three-
dimensionality, all the development is left to Karen.   </P>
<P>     As a directorial debut, THE CRUDE OASIS displays promise for 
Graves, who manages to hold the audience's attention.  Certain choices, 
such as a long, lingering view of an approaching thunderstorm, work 
exceptionally well.  Others, like keeping Harley's face off-camera 
during his first encounter with Karen (Does anyone not realize he's the 
man from her nightmares?), are questionable.  Nevertheless, techniques 
aside, Graves gets the message across.  To one degree or another, we're 
all prisoners of loneliness and isolation, but even for those most 
trapped, there's always some way out, even if it involves an 
unimaginable risk.   </P>
