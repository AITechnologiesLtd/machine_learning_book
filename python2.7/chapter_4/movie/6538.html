<P>     I'm sure there are people out there who view BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO
AMERICAN as yet another sign that the end-times are upon us; they are
probably the same folks who have condemned from day one the MTV series on
which it is based as a celebration of violence, stupidity and lack of
respect.  Speaking as an admittedly defensive some-time fan of the show, I
think "Beavis and Butt-Head" is much smarter and more self-aware than its
detractors give it credit for being.  Mike Judge created a series for MTV
which takes aim at the generation of youth MTV helped create:  kids
without the attention span to sit through an entire music video.  Do young
viewers of the show sometimes delight in the anarchy and low humor
without appreciating the sub-text?  Probably, but the same statement is
true of "The Simpsons," and no one would accuse "The Simpsons" of not
being smart.</P>
<P>     Then again, Bart Simpson is only ten; Beavis and Butt-Head are
teenagers, scrawny packages of surging hormones and attitude, and BEAVIS
AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA captures them at their worst, which is to say
their best.  The story finds our heroes (both voiced by creator/director
Judge) discovering that their beloved television has been stolen, and
setting out to find it or any acceptable replacement.  Instead, they find
Muddy Grimes (an uncredited Bruce Willis), a shady character who thinks
Beavis and Butt-Head are the two guys he's hired to "do" his duplicitous
wife Dallas (an equally uncredited Demi Moore).  The boys don't interpret
"do" as "kill," however, and head for Las Vegas where thy think they are
finally about to score.  Dallas has other ideas, though, and uses the
dim-witted pair to transport a stolen military germ warfare weapon to
Washington D.C.  As Beavis and Butt-Head make their way across America,
they are chased by ATF Agent Fleming (Robert Stack), a hard-nosed Fed with
an unusual fondness for body cavity searches.</P>
<P>     There's no point in pretending that BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA
doesn't traffic in plenty of below-the-belt gags -- and above-the-belt,
where women are concerned -- because that is the level of Beavis and
Butt-Head's sense of humor.  Sex, masturbation, gas and other toilet
functions all send the twosome into paroxysms of their trademark immature
snickering, yet Judge stages many of these moments with a knowing wit.  A
stylized montage of high-rolling Vegas action, which in most films would
find the heroes living it up and enjoying the big time, instead finds
Beavis and Butt-Head unable to stop staring at a bare-breasted ship's
figurehead; another scene has them missing a bus thanks to their
fascination with auto-flush urinals.  While Beavis and Butt-Head find only
sexually suggestive town names worth noting on their trans-continental
trek, Judge allows the audience to recognize that he too understands how
idiotic they are.</P>
<P>     That is not to say that a little Beavis and Butt-Head doesn't go a
long way.  Even fans of the series might find 80 minutes of their antics
getting repetitive, particularly when connected to a standard "mistaken
identity" premise in which morons take such bizarre actions that they are
assumed to be brilliant.  The series also benefits from the commentary on
music videos which breaks up each episode's plot, and that commentary is
missed in BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA.  Its absence removes the rare
opportunities you have to witness how selective their obliviousness can be
as they analyze the cliches of videos.  Judge tosses in some clever bits
unrelated to the series, including a great opening credits sequence scored
to a "Shaft"-like Isaac Hayes tune and voice cameos by Cloris Leachman and
a fellow credited as "Earl Hofer" (David Letterman's nom-de-cinema in
CABIN BOY), but most of the gags are directed squarely at fans of the
show.  The uninitiated might find themselves baffled at the applause which
goes up for Cornholio, Beavis' caffeine- and sugar-fueled alter-ego.</P>
<P>     A keen grasp of reality prevents me from attempting anything like a
conversion of "Beavis and Butt-Head" haters.  Hard-core opponents consider
them not just annoying but actively evil, an animated pair of
potty-mouthed Pauly Shores sucking the collective will to think out of the
heads of America's impressionable youth.  But BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO
AMERICA, crude though it may be, is more genuinely inventive than SPACE
JAM and 101 DALMATIANS combined, and less insulting to the intelligence of
younger viewers.  All it takes is a very funny moment which underscores
the futility of Butt-Head trying to piece together a rather elementary
crime scene to point out that dumb characters don't have to mean a dumb
movie.  BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA overcomes its fundamental dopiness
to provide entertainment for those prepared to laugh with its
self-absorbed protagonists _and_ those prepared to laugh at them.</P>
