<P>     HOLLOW MAN follows in the fine tradition of James Whale's 1933
version of THE INVISIBLE MAN, in which Claude Rains loses his mind and
goes on a murderous rampage. There is, however, a more realistic element
to Paul Verhoeven's contemporary version of the tale: This invisible man
tests his power by going around feeling up women. We understand this
instinctively to be realistic because it's in the DNA of every
heterosexual adolescent male to define invisibility as the power to walk
into the girls' locker room with impunity. Hell yes we'd engage in a
little mischief if no one could see us; even the best of us might find it
hard to resist the temptation. Power corrupts, and so on and so forth.</P>
<P>     HOLLOW MAN could have been a provocative examination of what that
temptation would do to one of the best of us. Instead, its invisible man
is Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), an egomaniacal jerk heading a
government research project into rendering people invisible, a process
that proves much easier than rendering them visible again. After a
breakthrough leads to the apparent discovery of a method for reversing the
process on test animals, Caine decides to test the invisibility serum on
himself, against the protests of his colleagues Linda McKay (Elisabeth
Shue) and Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin). The invisibility serum works
on Caine, but the reversal serum is not so successful, stranding Caine in
his invisible state. And Caine begins to discover that he kinda likes the
freedom it grants him to do virtually anything.</P>
<P>     A bunch of techno-babble sets up the notion that the subjects of
Caine's serum are "out of phase with the visible universe" blah blah blah,
and disappear from the outside in, one layer at a time. And make no
mistake about it, it's one heck of a nifty visual trick (actually
introduced in reverse when a test ape gradually turns from skeleton into
layers of musculature). In fact, HOLLOW MAN is awash in nifty visual
tricks cleverly implemented: the thermal view of a full frontal Bacon; a
scene of Caine vomiting up invisible food in silent answer to that age-old
question; Bacon's ghostly visage appearing in water, smoke and a tossed
bag of blood. As effects-heavy thrillers go, this one at least makes every
moment of technological gee-whizzery genuinely worth a gee-whiz.</P>
<P>     What it lacks, in essence, is anything that can be called a story. 
There's a vacant spot in the center of the film even before Caine 
vanishes, because there's nothing remotely sympathetic about him from the
outset. While we can still see him, he's an obnoxious sort who makes
off-color jokes and mocks the vivisection of his lab animals. Once we
can't see him, he's the same guy, only now with the ability to render his
obnoxiousness more directly on others. There's no character arc to
Sebastian Caine; HOLLOW MAN merely presents the fairly self-evident answer
to the question, "What would happen if you granted omnipotence to a cruel,
self-absorbed bastard with a God complex?" The script doesn't even give a
character arc to its ostensible protagonist, Shue's Dr. McKay. Perhaps she
too could have been tempted, or learned something about scientific hubris. 
But no one learns anything in HOLLOW MAN, except to stay out of the way of
an invisible sociopath. Ultimately, it's nothing but a technically
proficient mad slasher movie.</P>
<P>     Make that a fairly diverting, technically proficient mad slasher
movie, at least during its high-energy third act. HOLLOW MAN is giddily
gruesome from the outset -- engineered by Verhoeven, the king of giddy
gruesomeness -- but it really goes wild once Caine traps his research team
in their underground facility. The film turns from a gloss on Cronenberg's
THE FLY to a gloss on both ALIEN and ALIENS (though I actually enjoyed the
nod to WESTWORLD, with Josh Brolin following in Papa James' footsteps in a
cat-and-mouse game involving thermal perception). The final 20 minutes
becomes a frantic and generally entertaining hack-n-slash through the
supporting cast members, leading up to an appropriately ridiculous climax. 
It's too bad Verhoeven and screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe weren't 
interested in putting some meat on HOLLOW MAN's bones. Even with all its
visceral appeal, it could have been so much more interesting to watch the
story of the guy who wants to walk into the girls' locker room with
impunity, instead of the guy who wants to walk into the girls' locker room
and blow it up.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 sick degrees of Kevin Bacon:  6.</PRE>
