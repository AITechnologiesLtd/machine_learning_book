<P>IN SHORT: Shakespeare, minus all the drama</P>
<P>The reason William Shakespeare is described as the greatest playwright
ever is that his stories stand the test of time, both in their original
form and in any derivative adaptation. Romeo and Juliet as West Side
Story or King Lear as The Lion King, for example. The difficulty lie in
the language, five centuries old, which is hard enough for a modern
actor to get his tongue around and the sheer length of each play, hours
of screen almost begging for an adaptation which shaves the fat. You can
take a hammer to Shakespeare and not hurt the basic story, if you know
what you're doing. Director Michael Almereyda's Hamlet takes a mallet
the size of a small state to the Bard, mutilating famous soliloquies and
utterly stripping the drama out of one of the bloodiest finales ever to
get the stage sticky with fake blood.</P>
<P>That last sentence assumes you have a vestigial remembrance of the last
scene of Hamlet. If you are utterly new to the work, you will be utterly
lost by the time it ends.</P>
<P>The concept for this adaptation, moving it into modern times and
restructuring the monarchy as a corporation, is intriguing to say the
least. In this version, a hostile takeover within New York's Denmark
Corporation has left its CEO (Sam Shepard) dead, his brother Claudius
(Kyle MacLachlan) in charge and married to the primary shareholder of
the corporation, Gertrude (Diane Venora) -- I'm guessing about the
stock. One of the failings of the adaptation is that it ignores all the
cultural and legal developments of the last half millennium. None of
this sits well with pasty face Hamlet (Ethan Hawke), a university
student who is majoring in video production and will use his skills to
try to bring his uncle down.</P>
<P>Hamlet is also obsessed with the lovely Ophelia (Julia Stiles), sister
of his friend Laertes (Liev Schreiber). Both of them are kidlets of the
"prattling fool" corporate Yes Man Polonius (Bill Murray). As Hamlet's
behavior becomes more erratic, "mad" if you will, Claudius employs other
pals Rosencrantz and Gildenstern (Steve Zahn and Dechen Thurman) to keep
an eye on him. Murder, Madness and Suicide will all work their way into
the story 'cuz Shakespeare was good at that but the adaptation strips
the story of all of its power. All the while, the Ghost of Hamlet's dad
appears to counsel his son and, thankfully, recap what's been going on
so that the audience can follow along.</P>
<P>That almost saves the day. While the brain can usually pierce the veil
of time and follow the path of the language if the actor's delivery is
good, none of the ones in this version of Hamlet are. Shepard's
expository speeches don't click until a third of the way through. Murray
and MacLachlan's don't seem to properly jibe with their new corporate
clothes and Hawke is undermined by the concept. The New York City
background becomes more of a player than the principals.</P>
<P>Almereyda is so determined to work modern technology into every scene
that, in the most grievous example, the world famous "To Be Or Not To
Be" soliloquy is presented on videotape. Hamlet with a gun in his mouth
(just in case you're a completely ignorant git) and those six words
rewound and replayed twice more before the script moves on. Lest you sit
there thinking "huh??!" as I did, the rest of the soliloquy shows up
later, recited in the aisles of a Blockbuster store. I'll let those who
prefer a perfect Bard scream about chopping and reordering the text, I
take the position that the flick should be clear as a bell first time
out, so I can't complain about the text being out of "correct" position.
All I know is what I know and, even as little as I do know about Hamlet
having seen it less than half a dozen times, I know that this version
bites mightily.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Hamlet, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$2.00</PRE>
<P>Mid-week rental level, specifically for those who know Shakespeare up
and down. You may derive more satisfaction than I did from the
adaptation. My concern is with the folk who walk in unknowing, who will
walk out the same way.</P>
