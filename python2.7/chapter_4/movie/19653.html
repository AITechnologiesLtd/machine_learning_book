A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Renny Harlin</PRE>
<P>Written by: Duncan Kennedy, Donna Powers and Wayne Powers</P>
<P>Starring: Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J,
Michael Rapaport</P>

<P>Synopsis: 
In a floating research facility called Aquatica, proteins are harvested
from the brains of three mako sharks as part of research on a cure for
Alzheimer's disease. Mako sharks, a species where the female is much larger
than the male, are some of the fastest, highest leaping fish in the world,
as well as possibly the most the most intelligent type of shark and a
leader in attacks on boats. An unfortunate consequence of the Aquatica
research is that it enhances the size, invulnerability, and intelligence of
the three sharks. The humans seem firmly in control, but when an accident
happens, guess who's got the upper hand?</P>
<P>Opinion:
Who will survive? The beautiful but ice-cold lady scientist, the reformed
convict? The depressed research assistant or her smokaholic boyfriend, the
baby-faced engineer, the rich financier, or the cook? DEEP BLUE SEA is no
cliches and all surprises. It'll put you on the edge of your seat more
times than the original Jurassic Park. DEEP BLUE SEA was the funnest movie
I've seen all summer, and I highly recommend it for an outing of scary fun
and entertainment. </P>
