Review: *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>After the phenomenal success of the re-release of "Star Wars" last year,
the fifties'-style musical "Grease" seems like a logical flick to bring
back to theaters. Not only was it an enormous hit back in 1978, but like
"Star Wars," an entire generation of kids have grown up with it on
video, but have never seen it on the big screen. Not to mention, John
Travolta is even hotter now than he was in '78, the public is hungry for
seventies' memorabilia, and the music is still an ageless trip. The
soundtrack continues to sell well after twenty years, and a year ago the
"Grease Megamix" (a souped-up re-mix of bits and pieces of all the hit
songs) was one of the most requested tunes on pop stations around the
country.</P>
<P>So now "Grease" is back on the silver screen, and watching it again
feels like going to a class reunion. Seeing Travolta back in his early
twenties, with a lean body and greasy black ducktail makes it all the
more amusing to drop next door and see him playing a gray, overweight
Clinton clone in "Primary Colors." In both movies he radiates off the
screen like a true movie star, but in "Grease" it's a more primal,
teen-angst kind of stardom, like the kind Leonardo DiCaprio is currently
enjoying. And, like DiCaprio, Travolta was not only desired for his
physical attributes, but also for his talent -- he rode into "Grease" on
the critical and commercial success of "Saturday Night Fever," for which
he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar.</P>
<P>In viewing "Grease" today, we are effectively in the late nineties
watching a film that was made in the late seventies reminiscing about
the late fifties. When "Grease" was made, there was a strong nostalgic
feel for the innocence and joviality of the late fifties; as the
turbulent seventies were coming to a close, with the emphasis on
Vietnam, Watergate, racial tension, and general unpleasantness, it was a
nice returning to a time when black leather, fast cars, and necking in
back seats were harmless means of being bad. Movies at the time were
gritty, urban tales of corruption and moral ambiguity, and "Grease" made
itself out to be the absolute antithesis.</P>
<P>Of course, the fifties portrayed in "Grease" is a time period that never
really existed.  It's more a whimsical version of how we think it was --
filled with shiny hot rods, black leather jackets, hip diners, clueless
principals, and gangs with names like the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies.
Everything is simplified down to its barest essentials, and that what's
so nice about the movie. It doesn't demand much of anything from the
audience, other than they check their problems at the door and have a
good time. The story about the good greaser Danny (Travolta), and his
love for the squeaky-clean new girl in town, Sandy (Olivia Newton-John),
is a kind of ageless high school myth.</P>
<P>"Grease" would probably never get made today (musicals are pretty much
dead, even when they're starring Madonna). Based on the hit Broadway
show by Jim Jacobs and Warren Case, "Grease" is imaginatively campy,
kind of goofy, but always energetic and fun. The music, ranging from the
disco-inspired opening song by Frankie Valli, to the infamous "Greased
Lightning" with all its automobile-inspired sexual innuendo, was hot
stuff then and still is now.</P>
<P>The songs, brought to life by the lively performances by Travolta and
Co. and the fantastic choreography by Patricia Birch, have a campy,
timeless quality that always makes you want to sing along with them, no
matter how cheesy (how can you not at least tap your feet to "Summer
Nights" or "You're the One That I Want"?). In fact, the musical
sequences will be the most eye-opening to those who have never seen
"Grease" on the big screen before. Those poor souls who have been stuck
with lousy pan-and-scan copies on video will be amazed seeing it in
widescreen for the first time, which finally allows full viewing of
Birch's dance numbers.</P>
<P>Probably the only let-down of "Grease" is how little it did for its
performers. It's easy to assume that a hit like this would be a
launching pad for its twenty-something actors and actresses, but in
fact, almost none of them went on to meaningful film careers. Jeff
Conaway, who was so good in the role of Danny's best friend Kenickie,
went nowhere. Didi Conn, who played the unforgettable Frenchy, didn't
even get that far (she was desperate enough to show up in "Grease 2").
Even Stockard Channing -- whose performance as Rizzo, the leader of the
Pink Ladies, gives "Grease" the closest thing it has to real drama --
had a mostly uneventful movie career until she resurfaced in the early
nineties with her Oscar-nominated role in "Six Degrees of Separation."</P>
<P>And what of the leads? How did Olivia Newton-John's career take off?
Does "Xanadu" ring a bell? And even Travolta, whose career seemed
infallible at the time, made one good film ("Blowout"), one okay film
("Urban Cowboy") and two really bad films ("Staying Alive" and "Two of a
Kind") before sinking into a fifteen-year rut until 1994's "Pulp
Fiction" set him free.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, "Grease" was a huge success for its time because it bucked
the trends and gave moviegoers something they hadn't seen in a long
time. Upbeat, funny, occasionally witty, and always enjoyable, "Grease"
is no great piece of art, but with its complete lack of pretension, it
is about as fun a movie experience as you can get, even with inflated
ticket prices.</P>
