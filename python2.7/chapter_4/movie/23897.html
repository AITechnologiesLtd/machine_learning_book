<P>Writer-director James Toback's ambitions are clear. In making a film about 
the wall that stands between people of different races, no matter how much 
everyone strives to be the same, and treating his characters not dissimilarly 
from those presented in Robert Altman's 1975 masterwork, "Nashville," all 
Toback has really done is accidentally uncovered the source of his filmmaking 
weaknesses. Mixing his screenplay with improvisatory material between his 
eclectic group of actors, in an expose of over twenty different characters in 
New York City, Toback's latest picture, the aptly-titled "Black and White," 
is consistently fascinating, but doesn't add up to all that much. While one 
can walk away from a theater appreciating that the film actually has more 
than a few fleeting thoughts in its mind, there is rarely, if ever, a clear 
attempt to develop the wide array of characters from being anything more than 
symbolic figures or broad-based stereotypes.</P>
<P>Free-floating in style and without a clear-cut destination, "Black and White" 
doesn't follow, as much as it wanders around the inhabitants on screen, 
before jumping to the next scene. If there is any character that the film 
revolves around, it is NYU film grad Sam (Brooke Shields) who has come to 
make a documentary on the fad of white teenagers who favor acting "black" and 
listening to hip-hop music, with her flamboyantly gay husband, Terry (Robert 
Downey Jr.), in tow. Sam's central subjects are a small group of high 
schoolers, including Charlie (Bijou Phillips), Wren (Elijah Wood), and Raven 
(Gaby Hoffmann), all brought up in wealthy households, who nonetheless rebel 
at both their parents and the present-day society that says kids should all 
conform to act and dress and behave a certain way.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, college basketball player Dean (Allan Houston) is approached by 
Mark (Ben Stiller), a mystery man who offers him $50,000 dollars to botch his 
next big game. Dean is unsure of what he should do, and his scholarly 
girlfriend Greta (Claudia Schiffer), currently writing a thesis on the 
subject of race, isn't much help, only advising him to go with his heart. 
Intersecting with everything is Rich Bower (Power), who is finally starting 
to edge away from his criminal lifestyle and into the world of being a 
recording artist. </P>
<P>Acquiring a remarkably diverse cast that includes real-life stars playing 
themselves (Mike Tyson, Method Man), actual thespians (Ben Stiller, Robert 
Downey Jr., Elijah Wood), recording artists (Power, Bijou Phillips), 
supermodels (Claudia Schiffer), and NBA players (Allan Houston), the major 
surprise "Black and White" has to offer is that its performances are 
uniformly good. Making a picture that was largely stressed by Toback to be 
improvisational must have been a daunting task for most involved, and 
everyone comes off naturally and in unaffected turns, despite having roles 
that could have used a few deeper shades of characterization. For all of its 
"true-to-life" chit-chat, these people have very few ideas or distinct 
personality traits, and more often than not, do things because the film calls 
for it, rather than because that is what the characters themselves would do.</P>
<P>While everyone works as a unit, and thus, few of the actors get much of a 
chance to stand out amidst the dizzying movement from one character or story 
to the next, a select few should be noted. Claudia Schiffer, of all people, 
is excellent as the supposedly kind-hearted girlfriend of Dean, whose true 
colors abruptly show, unveiling her to be a conniving backstabber. Brooke 
Shields, in her strongest film role in years, is appropriately eager and 
wide-eyed as the documentary filmmaker who is shown to have an extreme 
insecurity of being alone when Terry, played to the comic hilt by Robert 
Downey Jr., finally makes her face the fact that he is gay and has absolutely 
no interest in a relationship anymore. Eddie K. Thomas (of 1999's "American 
Pie") is surprisingly versatile and adept as one of the high schoolers being 
documented, whose father is withdrawn and unconcerned about him, favoring his 
newest girlfriend (Stacy Edwards) over him or his older son, Will (William 
Lee Scott), whom he hasn't seen in two years. And as the platinum blond high 
school history teacher who catches the eye of Terry, Jared Leto sparkles in 
only a handful of scenes.</P>
<P>Whereas the actors are entertaining throughout, and bring what little depth 
there possibly can be brought to such a decidedly one-dimensional display of 
stick figures, "Black and White" stumbles because its messages are never 
reasonably dealt with in any sort of satisfying manner. For example, several 
scenes hint at making a statement about the distressing distance between 
removed parents and their children, but it never reaches any sort of 
conclusion. Nor does anything else in "Black in White;" things just happen, 
simply because they happen, and before you have had time to take it all in, 
you are already onto the next scene. </P>
<P>The finale is particularly anticlimactic, as we are treated to a bogus "Six 
Months Later" title card, which then reveals what happened to all of the 
characters. This gimmicky epilogue would be tolerable if not for its 
ludicrous payoff. Credit "Black and White" for its occasional flashes of 
storytelling originality, but Robert Altman has done the same thing 
one-hundred times better, and with a remarkable and startling depth that 
Toback cries for, and so unfortunately lacks.</P>
