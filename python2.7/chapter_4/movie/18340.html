<PRE>TRUE CRIME
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>It is sad to see a movie like True Crime go so horribly, horribly wrong.
It has a good director and a very talented cast, all of whom are doing
their utmost to enliven the routine story.  But at each and every turn,
they are thwarted by a horrific screenplay.</P>
<P>Clint Eastwood directs and stars as reporter Steve Everett.  Steve is a
train wreck of a man with a penchant for cheating on his wife with very
young women (particularly those who are close relatives of his
employers). He's a recovering alcoholic with only one thing to rely on:
his nose for news.</P>
<P>On what may be the last story of his career, Steve is assigned a puff
piece detailing the last day of a man on death row.  The man, Frank
Beachum (Isaiah Washington), was convicted of killing a pregnant store
clerk over a minuscule debt.  He protested his innocence, but two
witnesses</P>
<P>But as Steve conducts the routine interviews, he gets one of his
trademark hunches:  Frank is an innocent man.  But there are fewer than
twelve hours until Frank's execution.  Is Steve right?  And, if he is,
how can he prevent Frank's death if he can't ever do anything right?</P>
<P>True Crime is a movie filled with great actors, and some good scenes.
But, even with those plusses, it is one heck of a terrible movie. The
problem is the screenplay, pure and simple.  It sets up one
jaw-droppingly bad situation after another.  Just when you think the
film can't get any more ridiculous, it manages to top itself yet again.</P>
<P>And it truly is a pity.  The interplay between Clint Eastwood and his
editor-in-chief (played with relish by James Woods) is a delight and
deserves to be in a much better movie than this.  In fact, nearly all
the actors in the film are able to deliver much more innovation than
their cardboard characters deserve.</P>
<P>In fact, the film is almost (I repeat, almost) watchable on the basis of
the actors alone.  But, every time when you are just about to forgive
the screenplay for its countless sins, it deposits out of the blue yet
another terrible line of dialogue, a completely ridiculous plot twist,
or a jarringly obvious cliche.</P>
<P>All of this wasted potential makes True Crime absolutely painful to
watch. Usually, movies this bad will numb you over time.  But, with True
Crime, you are always able to see the brilliant movie that is just out
of reach...and the experience is devastating.</P>
