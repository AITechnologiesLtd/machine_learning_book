<P>Susan Granger's review of "JESUS' SON" (Lions Gate/Alliance Atlantis)</P>
<P>Adapted from a collection of short stories by Denis Johnson,
this episodic, un-rated film was heralded at the Venice and Toronto
Film Festivals and at the New Directors/New Film Festival in
Manhattan. It chronicles the adventures of a slacker who disdains
convention and is known only by a nickname that cannot be
printed. Let's call him F-H for propriety's sake, acknowledging his
uncanny ability to screw things up. As played by Billy Crudup ("Waking
the Dead"), F-H is a heroin-using hedonist, a passive loser, who is
out for thrills and excitement as he makes his way from Iowa to
Phoenix during the counterculture movement of the early 1970s.  The
title comes from Lou Reed's lyrics to the Velvet Underground song
"Heroin," and F-H spends much of his time hallucinating, often within
a religious iconography. On his travels, he encounters some pathetic,
oddball characters like the derelicts in a farmhouse where he hangs
out and gets stoned and a psychopathic emergency-room orderly (Jack
Black) with whom F-H pops uppers and downers simultaneously. F-H falls
in love with a free-spirited fellow addict (Samantha Morton of "Sweet
and Lowdown") until tragedy inevitably occurs. There are
subplots/cameos with Holly Hunter, Denis Leary, Will Patton, Greg
Germann and Dennis Hopper. Certainly screenwriter Oren Moverman,
producer-screenwriters Elizabeth Cuthrell & David Urrutia, and
director Alison Maclean ("Crush") aren't afraid to take risks
exploring the quietly desperate, black humor in themes of boredom,
alienation, death and salvation - all within a $2.5 million budget. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Jesus' Son" is an edgy, detached,
fragmented 5, but recommended only if you can tolerate graphic drug
use and rambling junkie humor.</P>
