<PRE>"Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss"</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Heather Picker</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by Tommy O'Haver. Starring Sean P. Hayes, with Brad Rowe,
Richard Ganoung, Paul Bartel, and Meredith Scott Lynn. 1998, 92 min., Rated R.</P>
<P>     Billy Collier (Sean P. Hayes, now stealing scenes as Jack on NBC's "Will &
Grace") is a struggling photographer and hopeless romantic. As if that wasn't
bad enough for a young person in the 90s, Billy has fallen for coffeehouse
waiter Gabriel (Brad Rowe), and he doesn't know whether or not Gabriel is gay.
Apparently, Gabriel doesn't know either. The two become friends, and Gabriel
works as a model for the new series Billy is shooting (re-creating famous
Hollywood screen kisses-such as that famous roll on the beach in "From Here to
Eternity"-using Gabriel and a drag queen). As the friendship progresses and
Billy becomes more intent on finding out where he stands with Gabriel, a
somewhat needless journey provides an opportunity for Billy and his close
friend, Georgiana (Meredith Scott Lynn) to escape to an exotic location where
they both do some soul searching.</P>
<P>     "Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss" is a predictable movie, but it is well
acted. Hayes, Rowe, and Lynn are all appealing in the three largest roles, and
this is a promising effort from writer and director Tommy O'Haver (this marks
his feature film debut). Billy's black and white fantasies (about his Hollywood
screen kiss) and the clever Polaroid flashbacks are nice touches that
distinguish the movie from other romantic comedies. The DVD is presented in
widescreen format, and the picture is crisp and clear. The 2.0 Dolby Surround
Sound works well for this film, which is mostly dialogue. There aren't many
supplementary features, just the theatrical trailer and commentary from O'Haver
(I would have liked to have heard commentary from the actors, as well) in
addition to the standard interactive menus, scene access, and subtitles. Fans
of the film will definitely want the DVD, as the video is still priced for the
rental market.</P>
<P>     Notes: Rated R for language, and brief scenes involving sexuality and drug
use.</P>
<P>     DVD Details: Keep case (disc holder on left side), widescreen, 2.0 Dolby
Surround Sound, Digitally mastered, Interactive menus, Scene access, Theatrical
Trailer, French and Spanish subtitles, Director commentary.</P>
<P>     The Verdict: "Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss" is a breezy comedy with an
intelligent, mostly light-hearted script and good performances that will please
open-minded audiences that don't mind a predictable story.</P>
