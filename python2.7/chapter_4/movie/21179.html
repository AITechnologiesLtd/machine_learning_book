<PRE>Jakob the Liar: true lies</PRE>
<P>In a Holocaust movie the question is never Is the hammer going to
fall, but When is the hammer going to fall. And who's going to live
through razing the ghetto. Who's going on the train. Before we even
sit down to Jakob the Liar, we already expect these questions to be
answered. It's not all about convention, however: we also expect to
appreciate dignity, perseverance, humility, sacrifice, the whole gamut
of things that made us cry at Schindler's List. And of course, as a
bonus, we get to hate the Nazis some more. The Holocaust movie is one
of the last remaining places where good and evil can be so clearly
demarcated without compromising the integrity of things, one of the
last settings where a black hat unequivocally means 'bad,' a white,
'good.'</P>
<P>In Jakob the Liar, Jakob Heym (Robin Williams)--self-proclaimed
part-time Jew--wears the whitest hat of all. As for story arc, too,
it's a lot like Braveheart, just without all the epic
patriotism. Patriotism is, after all, land-related, and the Jewish
community of Jakob the Liar is by definition landless. But still,
Jakob does more or less organize the resistance, his wife is already
dead (Fisher King?), and there is a torture scene towards the
end. And, people are affecting accents off an on, though it never gets
so careless as Costner's Robin Hood.</P>
<P>It all starts rather thematically, per Forrest Gump, with a
simpled-down man and something floating on the wind. In Jakob the
Liar, it's a newspaper. And Jakob's chasing it, shadow-playing things
to come: how one errant word from him will snowball out of control,
thrust this pancake vendor into the role of a prophet, in a time when
prophet is defined as he-who-has-news of the war. The thing is,
though--as Jakob chasing the newspaper establishes--Jakob doesn't have
the news. His 'radio' is a desperate figment of a collective
imagination. Which is where the Liar part comes into play. Accurate or
make-believe, news for the Jewish community engenders hope, and hope
is rare. So, by piling lie on lie, each more fantastic than the last,
Jakob can keep his (all-star) community afloat awhile longer.</P>
<P>But of course making light of a bad situation can only last so long.
In spite of the welcome humor and Fiddler on the Roof music, this is a
Holocaust movie. Sombre is a word. Inevitable's another. The first
spoken word, is, after all, "Hitler," and every exchange after is,
though often comical, nevertheless weighted, simply by the fact that
this parting could be the last parting. What's particularly effective
with all this, too, is how director/writer Peter Kassovitz subtly
manages to put us in the same position as the Jewish community, via
cleverly keeping the timeline from us, which serves to nullify the
dramatic irony that would have otherwise been operant. In spite of the
history lessons complete with dates, we, like the Jews, have no idea
when this is all going to be over. Meaning that for some tense moments
at the end Jakob the Liar sways between tragedy and comedy, and
doesn't commit itself either way until the closing frames, and even
then--as with The French Lieutenant's Woman--it tries to get the best
of both worlds, both endings. Because it's Robin Williams, too, it
does.</P>
