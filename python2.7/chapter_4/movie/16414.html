<PRE>                          IN DREAMS
                  A movie review by Joe Barlow
                     (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:  Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn, Katie Sagona
DIRECTOR:  Neil Jordan

                book "Doll's Eyes" by Barry Wood)
RATED:     R
RELEASED:  1999</PRE>
<PRE>           RATING: ** 1/2 (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        "In Dreams" is such a strikingly original film that one
is somewhat tempted to forgive its excesses.  A psychological
thriller comprised of equal parts intrigue and phantasmagoria,
the story effectively drenches the audience in shadowy insanity,
even if the characters themselves never really involve us.  It's
a textbook example of style over substance.</P>
<P>        The plot involves Claire Cooper (Annette Bening), a New
England housewife who finds herself mentally linked to a serial
killer, sensing his every thought.  (The name Claire was chosen,
I suspect, as a pun on the word "clairvoyant.")  Slowly going
insane from the experience, Claire attempts to find and confront
the killer, with whom she has a personal score to settle.</P>
<P>        It sounds great on paper, but the film is ultimately
not as satisfying as one might expect.  Despite its promising
start, "In Dreams" loses sight of its surprisingly effective
macabre tone just past its halfway point, eventually collapsing
into a tangled mess of contradictions and confusion.</P>
<P>        Much of the story is standard issue: Claire's husband
Paul (a thankless performance by Aidan Quinn) tries to convince
the police that his wife's psychic abilities are genuine and can
assist them in the search for the killer; they scoff, but
eventually come around.  Claire, meanwhile, is locked up in a
mental institution, but manages to escape with a little help
from that old movie standby, the ventilation ducts.  Soon she's
on the trail of the killer, a deeply disturbed fellow by the name
of Vivian (actor's identity withheld; see below), and things are
wrapped up by not one but *two* tried-and-true staples of
American cinema: the chase scene and the gunfight.  Yawn.  Did
someone forget that the film was supposed to be a psychological
thriller?  Did they think they were making "Die Hard part 19?"</P>
<P>        Since the movie goes to great pains to hide the identity
of the actor playing Vivian until the last possible moment, I
won't reveal the surprise, except to mention that it's a
satisfactory performance, though perhaps a bit too over-the-top
to be truly "great."  On the other hand, Annette Bening's work
here gets steadily better as the film progresses; surprisingly,
she's far more convincing as a lunatic than the smiling housewife
she portrays in the story's opening scenes.  Aidan Quinn's
performance as Paul, however, is given too little screen time to
really become anything more than a fleeting face in the shadows.</P>
<P>        As is so often the case, there's a bit too much story
contained in the movie.  Particularly puzzling is a subplot
involving an affair Paul may or may not have been having with
an Australian woman-- after a brief mention in the story's opening
scenes, the whole issue is completely abandoned.  I question its
inclusion in the film's final cut; it adds nothing but confusion to
the story.  Since the movie clearly thinks Paul is a good guy,
why question it?</P>
<P>        Nonetheless, "In Dreams" has flashes of remarkable
originality, marred primarily by its reliance on a conventional
resolution for a plot that is *anything* but ordinary; director
Neil Jordan deserves credit for even attempting a project of
this nature.  Boldly photographed and directed, the movie
comes frustratingly close to greatness, though in the end its
efforts are undermined by a generic finale and logic gaps that
could probably have been fixed if another draft of the screenplay
had been written.  (Question: if Claire and Vivian are psychically
connected, why can't he find her when she's hiding in the woods?
And why did the hospital put Claire in the *exact same room*
that Vivian had occupied 25 years before?  That blows beyond
mere "suspension of disbelief" and enters into the boring realm
of "plot contrivance.")  And Neil Jordan's bizzare symbolism fills
the frame: what's the significance of the apples?  Are we supposed
to be this perplexed while watching?  Sometimes the director is so
determined to prove that he's clever that coherency and plot are
sacrified in favor of technique.</P>
<P>        But there's still the potential for entertainment here,
especially if you like film noir, a genre that doesn't get much
attention these days.  The movie definitely has some great moments;
the "Titanic"-like underwater scenes at the local reservoir are
haunting, as are many of Claire's hallucinations.  Through them,
we can feel (and share) her madness.</P>
<P>        I screened "In Dreams" with my brother, himself a fine
amateur critic, and his summary of the film says it all: it's like
"Nightmare on Elm Street" meets "What Dreams May Come."
That should tell you all you need to know.  Thanks, Adam; I
couldn't have said it better myself.</P>
