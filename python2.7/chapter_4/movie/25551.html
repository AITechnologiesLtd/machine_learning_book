<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>"The Big Kahuna" is a movie about religion and business. About what
happens when the two ideologies clash, and how they're really not all that
different in the end. It's about how there are some people who are so
caught up in their faith that they're blind to everything else, and how
there are a lot of us, the great unwashed masses, who are stuck in the
middle and just trying to muddle through. And it's about the nature of
God, the ultimate Big Kahuna.</P>
<P>The film takes place over the course of twenty-four hours at an industrial
lubricant convention. Representing Lodestar Industries are Larry Mann
(Kevin Spacey), Phil Cooper (Danny DeVito) and Bob Walker (Peter
Facinelli). Larry is an intense go-getter; Phil is a more laid-back
marketing veteran; and Bob, a devout Baptist, is a fresh-faced novice sent
along for appearances. Their job at the convention is to secure the 
account of Dick Fuller, a major player in the field referred to as the
"Big Kahuna".</P>
<P>The Big Kahuna has promised that he'll come by Lodestar's tiny hospitality
suite at some point during the evening. But he never shows up. Or, at
least, so it appears until Bob (relegated to mixing drinks) mentions a man
he chatted with most of the night. It turns out that this man was Dick
Fuller, wearing somebody else's nametag. Larry is aghast to discover that
he and Bob talked about not lubricants but instead Fuller's dogs, and God,
and life and death -- taboo subjects for a potential client. However, the
Big Kahuna has invited Bob to a private party that night. Larry and Phil
reluctantly send him off, their last chance to secure the important
contract.</P>
<P>"The Big Kahuna" was written by Roger Rueff from his play "Hospitality
Suite". That the movie is based on a theatrical script should come as
little surprise. The emphasis on dialogue is enormous. Apart from the
leads, there is only one other credited performer (Paul Dawson as a
bellboy). The camera rarely leaves the hospitality suite's main room. I
first encountered this type of moviemaking with "Glengarry Glen Ross"
(also co-starring Spacey). That film at least had the benefit of a larger
cast, and I cannot deny that "The Big Kahuna"'s tunnel-vision-like focus
on just the three performers and single set grew tiresome on occasion.</P>
<P>But only on occasion. For the most part, "The Big Kahuna" is a
brilliantly-written, beautifully-acted movie that draws the best out of
its talented cast. It is hard not to enjoy a movie in which the actors are
so obviously relishing their dialogue. Spacey in particular is magnetic --
watching his verbal sparring with DeVito and Facinelli is the oral
equivalent of an Evert/Navratilova tennis match. He brings great energy to
the role, and gets most of the picture's funniest lines. But he does not
treat Larry as a funnyman; Spacey brings a raw, naked truth to the 
character. At one point, Bob and Phil debate whether Larry is honest or
just blunt. "He's blunt and honest," says Phil, and he couldn't be more
right.</P>
<P>DeVito's is a complex role, the sort that surprises you in the end with
just how many layers were revealed. Phil is at a crossroads. At a time
when he is supposed to be settling in and looking forward to retirement in
the not-too-distant future, his life is in an upheaval (he's newly
divorced) and he's looking for direction. I know how difficult that is at
twenty-three; I can only imagine how frustrating and demoralising it must
be at fifty-two. DeVito turns in a sombre, realistic performance that is
intelligently conceived, conveying Phil's inner turmoil in little steps
rather than one big leap.</P>
<P>As the relative newcomer of the trio, Facinelli is challenged to compete
with his veteran co-stars, and does good work. In a way, Bob is the most
difficult role. He believes no more fervently in his religion than Larry
does in marketing, but whereas Larry preaches something most of us can
relate to (namely, business), Bob adheres to something more idealistic,
and hence potentially more ludicrous. Facinelli does an able job of giving
Bob his own strength without seeming too coy or wishy-washy.</P>
<P>And this is important, because it is Facinelli's ability to face off with
Spacey that gives "The Big Kahuna" its impetus and its balance. Both Larry
and Bob are representatives -- priests, in a sense -- of their respective
religions. Bob cannot conceive of a conversation in which God is set
aside. We get the impression that Larry feels the same way about
lubricants, at least for the duration of the convention. They are both
seeking, in their own way, the Big Kahuna. For Larry, of course, this is
Dick Fuller. Nothing is more important than meeting him, courting him,
getting on his side. Bob's "Big Kahuna" is God, but Bob's intentions
toward Him are hardly any different, except that they are spiritual
rather than material. Larry and Bob are opponents in a literal sense, but
they are really preaching the same mindset.</P>
<P>It is Phil, then, who provides the pivotal counterpoint in the movie. He
is ambivalent and uncertain about both God and lubricants. He represents
the average person, who is not so firm in their convictions, and is 
unwilling to give himself over entirely to his faith (be it religion
or lubricants or anything else).</P>
<P>But perhaps "The Big Kahuna"'s most thoughtful observations are reserved
for the title character(s). Fuller is only barely glimpsed throughout the
movie; instead, he is revealed to us through reverential musings. But
Fuller is human, and we discover this only through the one character who
does not worship him. With Bob, Fuller is able to open up, and talk about
something other than lubricants. The implication -- symbolised beautifully
in a dream Phil relates to Larry -- is that maybe God, Bob's Big Kahuna,
is no different. He's just never had anyone to sit down with Him, have a
drink, and chat.</P>
