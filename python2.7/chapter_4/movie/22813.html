<P>Breathing off the limited oxygen that Scottish and homosexual jokes can 
provide, The Big Tease makes the absolute most of its 86 minute 
life-span before its tank runs dry. Had the film not prudently cut off, 
and instead joined the infamous ranks of many current movies, I would 
not be able to declare it the funniest film of the century to date (take 
a second, think about it), a title of which it is well deserving.</P>
<P>Crawford Mackenzie (Craig Ferguson) is the finest and most respected 
hairdresser in Glasgow, Scotland. When a much-deserved invitation 
arrives for him to go to America and compete in the World Freestyle 
Hairdressing Championship, a documentary crew decides to follow. Upon 
arrival, 12 minutes into the film, Crawford runs into problem after 
problem, not the least of which is that he wasn't actually invited to 
compete and has instead been offered a seat in the audience between 
Daniel Day Lewis and Carrot Top.</P>
<P>As Crawford's ego deftly guides him, he stumbles through obstacle after 
obstacle in his quest for the Platinum Scissors and to honorably 
represent all of Scotland. The most humorous moment comes when he needs 
a job to get his HAG (Hairdressers of America Guild) card and finds 
himself prepping animal costumes at a theme park, just an example of the 
many odd and hysterical situations he encounters.</P>
<P>In the spirit of last summer's most underrated film, Drop Dead Gorgeous, 
The Big Tease is a near-textbook mockumentary. Much of the film's humor 
can be credited to the constant spoofing of major competitions and the 
hairdressing industry. But don't expect this film to create many 
believers like Woody Allen's latest work, Sweet and Lowdown, or the 
smash hit The Blair Witch Project as that certainly isn't the intent 
here.  </P>
<P>The Big Tease perfectly captures and lampoons the essence of Hollywood; 
a cab driver carries around head shots, you need an appointment to get 
into anywhere and the elite know they're elite. But don't be mistaken, 
this is not a Hollywood film. Although the mammoth Warner Bros. is 
distributing the picture, it more closely resembles independent products 
like The Full Monty and The Castle than studio pieces.</P>
<P>Positive word-of-mouth should make The Big Tease a pleasantly surprising 
box office draw in the traditionally weak time between the release of 
Oscar contending films and the highly rated awards ceremony. Just don't 
expect any hair-splitting drama or overly flaky jokes.</P>
