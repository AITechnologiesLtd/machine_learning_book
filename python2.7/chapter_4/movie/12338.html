<PRE>M (1931)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Fritz Lang
Writers: Paul Falkenberg, Adolf Jansen, Fritz Lang, Karl Vash, and Thea von
Harbou
Starring: Peter Lorre, Gustaf Gründgens, Ellen Widmann, Inge Landgut, Theo
Lingen, Otto Wernicke, Frank Stein, Theodor Loos, Georg John</P>
<P>Fritz Lang's "M" is one of the great philosophical films, primarily because
its anger and message are not bogged down in pretentious overtones with
crush the story of the film, rendering it almost unwatchable a second time.
 It's a film where the meanings and anger of the film are not fully
comprehended in one single showing because it raises so many questions
about crime, punsihment, and authority.  But what's really amazing is how
it's first and foremost a gripping story about a murderer and the pursuit
of him, and then its philosophical.  What a concept.</P>
<P>"M" is all about a man named Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre, in the role that
made him internationally famous) who is an infamous child killer who the
police have been after for months, as his acts have been serial.  The first
10 minutes of the film introduces him as the public sees him: he woos a
little girl on her way home from school with candy and balloons, and then
we see an intensely creepy montage of the girl's ball rolling in the grass,
and the balloon he bought for her stuck in electric wires.  This whole
segment is intercutted with the girl's mom waiting at home for her to
arrive, and growing more and more worried as the time passes.  And we get
the saddening, scary shot of the woman's cry for her daughter being echoed
in an empty room.</P>
<P>The film immeadiatly launches into a kind of documentary on what the police
are doing to track him down, including night raids on criminal spots where
they think the killer may be, and propaganda for kids to learn not to talk
to any strangers.  The public is furious that the police haven't caught
him, and some even begin doing their own investigated work, albeit less
successful or deft as the police.  There's a scene towards the end that
perfectly sums up what this film is about: an old man is seen innocently
talking to a child, and before he knows it, a mob of people have formed
around him, and begin attacking him, saying that he's the infamous
murderer.  Of course, the man isn't the murderer, but it shows what people
become when they are angry and want to take their vengeance out on someone
without proof.</P>
<P>We also discover that the other really pissed off people in this matter are
the local mafiasos, who meet to discuss how they too will try and track
them down.  In one of the best parallel action sequences I've ever seen,
Lang shows the mafiasos discussing their plans as well as the police's
plans, and both seem eerily similar (even though they're marginally
different).  And soon the criminal underground, the police, and the general
public all seem to be the same.</P>
<P>The film also shows us Hans, who, in one brief shot, looks at himself in
the mirror and makes a nasty face like the monster the people believe him
to be.  The opening scenes of him show him as such, as we see him primarily
in shadow, and eerily whistling Grief's "In the Hall of the Mountain King"
over and over again until it becomes his signature tune.  The fact is we
never really see him up close, only in the form of shadows, and when we do,
he's not this monster he's made out to be.  It would be cheap if he was
such a monster, but the film shows Hans to be a man with a really sick
impulse, one that he cannot control, and one that is driving him insane. 
Peter Lorre's portrayal of Hans is not as a horrible creature, but as a
frightened human being.</P>
<P>The one scene that perfectly sums up who Hans really is and how he feels to
be himself is a pivotal scene where a man has discovered that he's the
killer and tries to place a marker on his back so that he can be found more
easily.  So the man sketches an "M" on his hand, trips into Hans as he
walks by him, and places the "M" on his back shoulder.  A couple seconds
later, Hans looks back into a mirror behind him and notices the "M."  His
entire face looses color and from this point on the film becomes a
merciless rush of fear and paranoia.</P>
<P>Hans has very little time in the film, but in one final scene, he is
captured and brought before a council of citizens and criminals (no police)
who have gone out of their way to get him for themselves and before the
police do.  There, he's placed on trial with the mafia don as the
prosecuting attorney, and a defense counsel man who basically says there's
not much he can do for him.  Here, a frightened Hans looks death right in
the face of all the people who hate him, and tries to desperately plea for
his life.  "I cannot help what I do!" he shouts out, but the people can't
get out of their mind what they see when they read the headlines,
announcing that he's killed another child.</P>
<P>"M" is angry about so many things in society, namely the way that people
refuse to see past what they hear about, and the way that people decide
other peoples' fates.  The trial scene is quickly exposed as a simple form
of revenge by a bunch of pissed off people, as well as some who are also
hypocrites.  How ironic is it for a criminal who has killed dozens of
people in his life to sentence a man to death for murder?  And who is to
say that another man must die because of what he has done and for what he
is?</P>
<P>Hans is seen as a murderer, but no one appears to want to help this man. 
They just want to kill him.  Society often wants to easily rid themselves
of people who don't fit in with them, who cause a roucous in the waves of
society, and that's what this film is about.  People refuse to look
underneath Hans and see a man who needs psychiatric help; they just see a
man who has killed a bunch of kids.  They block out Hans' desperate cries
for help, and refuse to understand him.  This film asks us to understand
people who commit crimes against society, for after all they are human
beings.</P>
<P>"M" was restored last year after being released on video in a murky,
screwed-up version filled with bad sub-titles and unwatchable scenes.  This
new version really clears things up and allows us to see what Lang wanted
us to see.  The film was a major innovative film when it came out, as it
was one of the first "talkies," and uses its sound so carefully and
effectively that its a wonder that anyone was able to be impressed with it
by viewing the older version.</P>
<P>When Fritz Lang made this, he was speaking out about his homeland, Germany,
and the atrocities they were having at the time (as well as in the time
when he made "Metropolis").  But this film actually goes beyond that.  It's
a universal story because things like this still happen today, when one
person is seen as the one to die for everyone's anger.  Hans Beckert was
based on a real person, but this person is a regular in history, and this
film doesn't intend to make him out to be a monster, but really a person
who just has some really major problems.</P>
<P>What's amazing about Fritz Lang's storytelling is how he doesn't let his
message become overbearing or pretentious.  "M" is an intensely watchable
film, one that holds the audience's attention, and in the process, stirs
them up, and makes them think about what is occurring.  A lesser director
would have made this a blatant satire, but Lang lets the story tell itself
and the meaning to come out through it, much like he did with "Metropolis."
 Lang is angry, but he's also doesn't to be condescending about it.</P>
