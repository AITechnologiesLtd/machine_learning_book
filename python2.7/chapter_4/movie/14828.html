<PRE>                            HOPE FLOATS 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
               2 :-) :-) out of 4 for the abandoned woman</PRE>
<P>Cast: Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick Jr., Gena Rowlands, Mae Whitman,
Michael Pare, Cameron Finley
Director: Forest Whitaker
Producer: Linda Obst
Screenplay: Steven Rogers</P>
<P>Sandra has finally found a movie of substance, after such disappointing
efforts like SPEED 2 and IN LOVE AND WAR. These epic disasters were
rather unfortunate in view of previous successes like SPEED and WHILE
YOU WERE SLEEPING. This otherwise, likeable, always charming, bankable
star, has decided to dig deeper this time round, and found something
that is unlikely to stink or sink. From this aspect itself, we can
literally say that yes, HOPE does FLOAT, even though your last two
movies were big box office duds.
In an age when divorce and separation is on the rise, comes a movie
about surviving the holocaust of family break-ups. This is a story of an
ex-beauty queen, Birdee Pruit (Bullock), who is dumped by her spineless
husband for her best friend. The point hits home when all is revealed on
a talk show, unbeknownst to the victim. Carrying wounded pride, Birdee
wanders home to her mother to nurse her wounds. This is a journey of a
woman who initially wallows in self-pity and depression, only to survive
the crisis by reclaiming her dignity and more importantly, retaining the
love of her daughter.</P>
<P>Yes, this deep and mushy stuff, but at least it makes a valiant attempt
to address the issues at hand. Sandra will not lose fans by smiling,
crying and laughing through problems relating to difficult mothers,
angry daughters and unfaithful husbands. Harry Connick Jr is affable
enough to be an old beau, who is still single and vies for her
affections. Whilst Michael Pare takes a break from C grade pics and
appears likeable as the unfaithful husband.</P>
<P>Overall, a thoughtful movie, that says that HOPE FLOATS when you are
holding on to the last straw. Things tend to get better even when you're
hurting badly on the inside. Don't mope about, don't blame yourself and
don't keep hoping your unfaithful husband will come back to you. Take
the remains of the day and do something worthwhile. Somehow you will
survive the awful mess of a marriage breakup.</P>
