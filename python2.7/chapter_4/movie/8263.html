<P>     Ever since New Line Cinema's highly profitable, early 1996 release 
of RUMBLE IN THE BRONX, New Line and Dimension/Miramax have been busily 
acquiring the rights to older Jackie Chan motion pictures.  They 
recognize that Chan's American fan base is such that even a moderately 
successful first weekend box office can turn a profit.  As a result, in 
the space of a year, we have seen SUPERCOP (1993), FIRST STRIKE (1995), 
and now the older OPERATION CONDOR (1991).</P>
<P>     OPERATION CONDOR, originally released in Hong Kong as ARMOR OF GOD 
II, is something of an odd choice to release, since all die hard Chan 
fans are likely already familiar with it (it's available on video).  
Dimension has invested a little money for the creation of a newly dubbed 
audio soundtrack (complete with music by Miramax regular Stephen 
Endelman), but, other than that, the viewing experience isn't much 
different.  All indications are that the distributor wanted to put out a 
Jackie Chan movie this summer, and settled upon something that was cheap 
and readily available.</P>
<P>     As far as plot goes, this film, like many of the action superstar's 
efforts, is decidedly silly and disjointed, often bordering on 
incoherent.  Any Chan storyline is, after all, just a flimsy excuse to 
permit the leading man to perform a number of amazing stunts, engage in 
astonishing martial arts fights, and present a series of hilarious 
comedy bits.  All of those elements are present here, but the connecting 
material is exceptionally feeble, to the extent that the patches between 
action sequences are not just filler, but boring filler.  Of the four 
recent U.S. Chan releases, OPERATION CONDOR is the weakest, although it 
still offers a certain degree of episodic entertainment value.</P>
<P>     The film, which Chan co-wrote and directed, plays like a merger of 
an Indiana Jones outing and a James Bond adventure, and makes far less 
sense than any entry into either series.  Chan plays a soldier of 
fortune named Jackie, and, in the company of an attractive female 
historian (Carol Cheng) and a feisty, platinum blond German woman (Eva 
Cobo deGarcia), he goes to North Africa on a treasure hunt.  Equipped 
with a map and a key, he crosses the Sahara desert in search of a hidden 
stash of Nazi gold.  In pursuit are all sorts of bad guys, including a 
pair of bumbling Arab terrorists who keep turning up like bad pennies.</P>
<P>     OPERATION CONDOR is light on spectacular action sequences and heavy 
on fights and comedy.  There are only two hardware-intensive scenes:  a 
chase that has six cars in pursuit of motorcycle-riding Chan and a brawl 
in a wind tunnel.  There are numerous hand-to-hand combat incidents, all 
of which are meticulously choreographed (things still go wrong, as shown 
in the end-credit outtakes that are a hallmark of Chan's films).  
OPERATION CONDOR also features a high humor quotient, with loads of 
quick gags and longer physical comedy setups, that is enhanced by the 
cheesy dubbing.</P>
<P>     From an acting standpoint, Chan is the only one worth paying any 
attention to.  As always, he's a leaping, whirling dervish of madcap 
energy and exuberance.  His ability to make any action sequence both 
funny and exciting is a testament to his talent.  He's Keaton, Chaplin, 
and Van Damme all rolled into one.  Other players in OPERATION CONDOR 
fill their roles effectively, but no one comes close to accomplishing 
what Michelle Khan did in SUPERCOP -- encroach upon Chan's place in the 
spotlight.</P>
<P>     It's debatable whether each new (or, in this case, old) Jackie Chan 
movie needs a unique review.  Give or take a few minor variations, Chan 
films are essentially the same, which is what the fans want.  
Fortunately, Chan is so enjoyable that, even though the plots and 
characters vary from recycled to irrelevant, mediocre films like 
OPERATION CONDOR still feature bursts of undeniable entertainment.  </P>
