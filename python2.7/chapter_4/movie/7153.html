<P>    Believe it or not, this short 'n' sweet biography of shock jock
Howard Stern is rather endearing.  The self-proclaimed King of All Media
is portrayed as a loving father and devoted husband.  He's just a guy
with a raunchy radio act and, thus, is misunderstood by everyone but
himself.  The makers of this movie make it very easy to like Mr. Stern.
Or at least tolerate him.  His hair looks good, he's filmed under favor-
able camera conditions, and the snippets of his show are considerably
toned done.  (Toned down, but still funny.  A kielbasa-swallowing
stripper is something you don't see every day.  For my money, though,
it's the bit with a woman and a woofer that's worth the price of
admission.) Much of PRIVATE PARTS is about the History of Howard, pre-
NBC and before his battles with the program director he dubbed Pig
Vomit.  We see some of his childhood, watch his marriage dissolve and
repair, and wince in embarrassment at his early attempts behind the
mike.  This is mandatory viewing for anyone who's ever worked in radio.
I was taken back to *my* first time in the booth, when the wrong button
stopped George Thorogood's "Bad to the Bone" in mid-song.  I hear ya,
Howard.</P>

<PRE>Notes
=====</PRE>
<P>    PRIVATE PARTS was screened at the Six Forks Station Cinemas in
Raleigh on 3/7.  Screen #6 smells bad, but the sound was decent.  Except
for the hiss, that is, that was audible when the movie wasn't.</P>
