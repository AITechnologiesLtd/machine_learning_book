<P>     For twelve years, Johnny Dingle (Andrew Lowery) has been
hopelessly in love with Missy McCloud (Traci Lind).  Now, with the
approach of the Senior Prom, Johnny finally gets up the courage to ask
Missy out.  Unfortunately, before he has the opportunity, he's killed
in a convenience store robbery.  But never fear!  Not even death can
hold back Johnny and, despite the annoying tendency of several of his
body parts to fall off, he returns from the grave to go to the prom
with Missy.  Surprisingly enough, she's a lot more attracted to him now
that he's dead than she ever was while he was alive (I guess he gets
points for being unusual).</P>
<P>     Those expecting this to be an unapologetically silly movie are
right on the money.  However, as idiotic as it is, MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
is not without a few redeeming qualities.  Much like last year's BUFFY
THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, there are enough clever touches to the film to keep
it from becoming tedious or unwatchable.  I would never argue that MY
BOYFRIEND'S BACK is a good movie, nor would I recommend it to anyone,
but it's not nearly as awful as the title would suggest, and there are
at least a few worse pictures available at the moment.</P>
<P>     One of the primary problems with this film is that while it has a
fun, lighthearted tone, it isn't nearly funny enough.  Far too many
jokes fall flat, and those that do succeed are more likely to provoke
an amused smirk than any genuine laughter.  The premise is somewhat
underused, at least as far as humor goes.</P>
<P>     MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK is pretty good at self-parody, though.  The
nonchalant way that everyone treats Johnny's return is clever and
enjoyable to watch.  Nothing that happens seems to shock anyone; they
take it all in stride.  In fact, Missy is flattered that a guy would do
something like come back from the dead for her.</P>
<P>     Johnny's mother (Mary Beth Hurt) and father (Edward Herrmann) are
especially farcical.  They are proud of their son's achievement, but
determined to do everything necessary to keep things normal.  When it
turns out that Johnny needs to eat living flesh to keep him from
decaying, his mother goes to the store and picks up a stray kid in case
he wants a snack.  When the neighbors threaten to burn Johnny, Mom
pulls out a gun and aims it in their direction.</P>
<P>     There is an anti-racist, anti-prejudice message that doesn't
work.  I recognize that the people behind MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK are
trying to do something positive, but comparing the plight of the
undead--a truly ridiculous situation to begin with--to the bigotry
faced by many minorities is more than just a bad idea; it's
insensitive.  I can even see where some might find it downright
offensive.</P>
<P>     It's surprising how good the cast is.  They do their jobs in the
right spirit, giving excellent, deadpan (no pun intended) performances
that keep this film from going into cardiac arrest.  How fine actors
like Mary Beth Hurt and Edward Herrmann can keep straight faces through
these proceedings is difficult to conceive.  Andrew Lowery's Johnny may
be the star of the show, but they steal the spotlight.</P>
<P>     One inventive touch found in the movie serves to emphasize the
comic-book quality of the story.  Many of the scenes are started with
cartoon panels that turn into live-action sequences.  Director Bob
Balaban has fun blending fantasy, comedy, and parody together, and does
a surprisingly smooth job of it.  If only his script had more bite,
this could have been a worthwhile film.</P>
<P>     As it is, MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK is about as mindless as a movie can
get.  That's not always a bad thing to say about a film, but it
certainly isn't an heartfelt endorsement.  Maybe when it comes on
cable, it will be worth a look--that's about the right medium for
something of this sort.  MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK has its moments, just not
enough of them.</P>
