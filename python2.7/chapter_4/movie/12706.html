<P>        Throughout history the American Indians have communicated through smoke
signals, but do they always understand the message that is sent?  This
movie concentrates on the lives of members of the Coeur d'Alene Indians of
Idaho, particularly on two friends, Victor and Thomas.
        As the film begins a frame house is engulfed in flames with  smoke
billowing into the sky.   A voice narration is describing the incident. 
It is Thomas.  He is recalling  when he was flying, as you see a baby
thrown from the upstairs window.  An Indian man rushes forward with
outstretched arms catching the infant as they both fall to the ground. 
The rescuer is Victor's father.   Sadly, Thomas' parents are both killed
in the blaze.  Thomas, raised by his grandmother, becomes quite a
storyteller and somewhat of a nerd.  Victor, on the other hand, is the
epitome of the Indian brave, with the added ability to play basketball.
        When Victor is twelve years old, his father leaves.   Much of the movie
is done using flashbacks, with very artistic editing.  The twelve year old
actors and their adult counterparts are remarkably alike, and all handle
their roles with total believability.
        Watching the film you   understand a little more about what life must be
like on an Indian reservation.  There is a lot of drinking, mostly beer,
but the thought of "firewater" and its effect on the American Indian is
obvious.  There are many subtle remarks about the "white man", some of
which are very funny, some all too true.  One charming scene involves two
Indian girls out for a joy ride in their car, driving in reverse.  No
reason is ever given, but you know that it is probably the only gear that
works.
        The main story involves the trip that Victor and Thomas make to Arizona
when word is received that Victor's father has died and Victor needs to go
there to finalize things. He doesn't want to go, but he does.  What he
learns is told in a most fascinating way.  It is truly a heartwarming
story and I highly recommend it.  I will definitely watch is again,
probably when it comes on television.  
        This film was produced in association with the Sundance Studios.  I give
it a B+.</P>
