<P>The Blair Witch Project, a low-budget horror movie that scared audiences
silly at the Sundance Film Festival, has been receiving incredible
acclaim among moviegoers. Certain critics have dubbed it `the scariest
movie since The Exorcist'. I'll be honest with you: it ain't. But what
director tag-team Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick have achieved here
is nothing short of extraordinary: opening the imagination to a world of
frightening possibilities. Tell yourself calmly `It isn't real' before
you enter the theater, and all should go smoothly.</P>
<P>The Blair Witch is a mythical creature said to live in the backwoods of
a small town called Burkitsville, Maryland. There have been many
campfire stories told about the murders of children and other
frightening occurrences, but no solid proof that the witch in question
ever existed. Three young college students - Heather (Heather Donahue),
Mikey (Michael Williams) and Josh (Joshua Leonard) - have set out to
make a documentary of the Blair Witch. Food and supplies have been
packed for a 2 or 3 day venture into the woods, where they hope to find
historical landmarks that have a significance in their project. They
interview the locals and find it to be common knowledge. However,
neither three show any particular respect toward the legend; they merely
view it as a fun trip into the woods and a chance to get very drunk.</P>
<P>The entire 90-minutes of The Blair Witch Project is composed of choppy
footage that, we are told, was found one year later. There are two
cameras that the trio use: a full color hand-held camcorder operated by
Heather to record the documentary in process, and a larger one used by
Josh for real footage. Mikey, meanwhile, is the sound man.</P>
<P>Sanchez and Myrick have made this film as real as humanly possible. The
actors use their actual names, and the shoot was supposedly composed
largely of improvisation, brought on by fear of the dark woods. When
things become scary for the characters, the tension begins to build in
the audience. They find themselves lost in the woods, stumbling upon
frightening crosses and stick figures dangling from the trees. Some
monologues are carried on in a pitch black setting taking place in the
tent, and you can only imagine what's going on around them. Things
become creepier than creepy when the group begins to hear children's
voices, and other mysterious sounds, echoing through the woods in the
night. We're very thankful when daylight hits.</P>
<P>As spooky as all of this sounds, it is much scarier in the aftermath.
You will go over certain scenes in your mind - in fact, one character's
helpless screams are still repeating themselves in my head. The
performances are air-tight, especially by Williams and Leonard.
Occasionally, Heather Donahue's cries and outbursts of profanity seem
forced. But, she also owns the most effective scene in the movie, in
which she records her apologies to the group's parents while holding
back sobs of terror. `I'm too scared to close my eyes, and I'm too
scared to open them,' she explains.</P>
<P>Sanchez and Myrick have wrung this great premise for every ounce of
possible fear. It is not so horrific that you'll find yourself quivering
in your seat, but it is scary. The ending contains one of the most
frightening frames in movie history. And, with only one scene of brief
violence, the directors have largely succeeded in proving one fact: that
images the imagination can conjure up are far more frightening than
anything shown on film. The Blair Witch Project is no phenomenon, but it
is very, very well done.</P>
