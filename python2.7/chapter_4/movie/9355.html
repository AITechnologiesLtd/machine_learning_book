<P>   A favorite question of ethics professors in college
departments of philosophy is this.  Let's say you have one
last final exam to pass in order to graduate, at which time you
will head for your Peace Corps assignment in Guatemala. 
You have agricultural expertise which the Central American
country can very much use.  If you do not pass this exam you
will not graduate and your Peace Corps assignment will
evaporate.  You haven't had time to study for this test (it's in a
field unrelated to your interests) and will probably flunk it.  But
you have an opportunity to copy answers from the whiz kid
sitting to you.  It is ethical, in this particular case, to do so?</P>
<P>   Mark Haskell Smith poses a similar question in his "Playing
God," a 1970s-style gangster drama updated to the California
of the 1990s under Andy Wilson's direction.  A surgeon has
squandered his license to practice medicine after losing a
patient while he was high on illegal drugs.  He is kidnapped
by gangsters and offered the chance to perform life-saving
surgery on some bad guys who cannot be sent to hospitals
for fear of bringing in the police.  He loves being a doctor and
can, if he chooses, decline the offer, and in the process lose
a fee of $10,000 per procedure.  Should he perform surgery
without a license under these conditions?</P>
<P>   The doctor in question is named Eugene Sands, played by
TV personality David Duchovny of Fox's program "The X-
Files."  He is still addicted to drugs, particularly synthetic
heroin, and when he does not have a supply handy he'll settle
for cough syrup and liquor.  He plays God in this film by
saving the life of a hoodlum who is shot in a bar (which the
doctor frequents to meet his drug contact) and by so doing
impresses the lovely Claire (the 21-year-old Angelina Jolie
here playing a 28-year-old beauty) and also a mobster known
as Raymond (Timothy Hutton).  Kidnapped by Hutton, he gets
his chance to remove bullets from baddies, live the high life in
more ways than one, and even to make goo-goo eyes at
Raymond's girlfriend, Claire.  In one case he brings a guy
back from the brink of death only to find out that the victim
was shot after he reveals information about the location of
some merchandise.</P>
<P>   In the press notes, a producer is quoted as saying,
"This film has some unlikely twists and nasty turns.  It's got
lies, love, action, and enough gunplay for a small Central
American war.  What more can you want?"
   Well, now, as long as you ask, for one thing we want some
dialogue.  In an effort to be California cool, Mark Haskell
Smith puts words in his people's mouths that are
embarrassing rather than chic.  Involved in a formulaic car
chase, Raymond says to his girl Claire, who is no longer
excited about being with him: "This is a car chase...I went to
considerable expense to set it up.  I've even considered
couples therapy."  For his part, the doctor intones, "Hell
doesn't always look like Hell.  On a good day it looks a lot like
L.A."</P>
<P>    For another thing, you could have better casting.  Timothy
Hutton will always come across better as a Vassar College
landscape instructor (Jon Robin Baitz's "The Substance of
Fire") than as a desperate, wildly envious hood in films like
this.  When Hutton contorts his face and goes into an off-the-
wall screaming act, you're tempted to say, "Wait a
minute...you're Timothy Hutton!"  And a lisping, nerdy FBI
agent played by Al Ahlf is really strange.  Is he meant to be? 
And if Raymond is chased by the FBI, why does he wind up
in a state correctional facility?</P>
<P>   If nothing else, the picture is politically correct.  Bad
Chinese drug dealer, good Chinese FBI man.  And Russians,
African-Americans and Latinos are cast.  Duchovny comes off
best as a low-key guy who is half good, half bad, matched by
the fickle Ms. Jolie who is good when she is with Duchovny,
bad when working the hoodlums. Rated R.  Running Time: 93
minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
