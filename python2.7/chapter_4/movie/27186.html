<PRE>THE SKULLS     (no stars)</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Rob Cohen
Writer: John Pogue
Cast: Joshua Jackson, Paul Walker, Craig T. Nelson, Leslie Bibb
PG-13, 106 minutes</PRE>
<P>What's the quickest way to sink a movie? You could give Craig T. Nelson 
awkward, burly facial hair for one. Yet there are faster ways. Efficiently 
emulating John Pogue's tedious script for the latest insipid work of Neal H. 
Moritz and company would work. Moritz's production crew brought you last 
year's infamous "Cruel Intentions". Both share ridiculous premises and 
unsatisfying conclusions. What else is there to say? The focus of intrigue 
shifts from rampant sex in this one, and there's no Sarah Michelle Gellar or 
Ryan Phillippe to somewhat save things. Despite cute smiles, Joshua Jackson 
and Paul Walker do not carry this movie, and with the job going to incapable 
supporting actors and director, it's an endless 106-minute work of continuing 
stupidity and boredom. </P>
<P>Rather than treat these "characters" with actual human names very much 
contrary to their fake emotions, names will not be included in this summary.</P>
<P>An annoyingly ambitious high school guy (Joshua Jackson) meets a gym-head 
boxer from a prestigious family (Paul Walker) at a famous university. 
Punching Bag's father (Craig T. Nelson) is the head of a campus secret 
society called the Skulls, which provides seemingly limitless opportunities 
for its exclusive pick of members. It's the country's largest male clique. 
After some luck in bizarre initiation ceremonies, Red Gloves and Irksome 
Scholar become best friends and even "skull-mates". Oh yes, skull-mates. 
Together they reap benefits of membership which include, but are not limited 
to sports cars, blank checks, rising grades, and bevies of whores. Somehow, 
no young dumb character figures out that heaps of dirty dealings are going on 
behind the scenes. Only when a close friend is murdered do the duo and other 
new Skulls come to their senses and wonder about the group's moral 
activities. Danger engulfs the friends. Will one man honor his father and the 
club, or his friend? Will the other stick with the popular people, or obey 
his conscience? Is there any escape from this dreadful plot?</P>
<P>Director Rob Cohen could have saved half of this with a simple, shameless 
exploitation of his main actors. A cheerfully bad Hollywood teen sex escapade 
hadn't happened since, well, "Cruel Intentions". The actors serve as nothing 
more than eye candy (with "Popular's" Leslie Bibb filling the brainless 
female role) since the actors have miniscule talents. The lengths to keep 
this PG-13 get annoying. Then again, a more adult version of "Skulls" would 
completely lose its target audience. This is the perfect video pick for that 
plucky teenage girl whose brain has received long-term abuse from abrasive 
foreign lip-glosses that you know. No other group of thinking, breathing 
human beings should give wide praise for this thing. Unless they, of course, 
are under the influence of some illegal substance smuggled across the border. </P>
<P>An example of possible adult praise: "Wow! That suggestively sweaty young man 
looks positively like he's reading a cue card." And that's trying hard.</P>
<P>Does this seem a little mean-spirited? Well then it's accurate. With 
skull-banging inane dialogue, vapid performances, plodding pace, and stark 
predictability this is easily the stinker of the season. It leaves a mood of 
disappointment, because like most bad movies, it could have been great. This 
piece triggers much anger from within for the California film gods. A movie 
is all in the execution, as most know. Too bad someone didn't kill this one 
in time. </P>
<P>One almost expects Gillian Anderson's character from "The X-Files" to show up 
as a bad pun, but alas, no. Christopher McDonald does show up for added pain 
in viewing though.</P>
