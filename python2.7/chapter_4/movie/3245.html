<PRE>                                BAD COMPANY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This a film about espionage.  That used to mean countries spying
on each other.  But about ten years ago, with the end of the Cold War,
the need for spies was no longer as urgent and on one day the CIA laid
off a hundred of its employees.  As most of us know, being unemployed
is not a good situation in which to find oneself and the former CIA
spies had to look for other work.  What else did they know but spying?</P>
<P>     Fortunately, for them, there are still lots of spying jobs
available except now it's within our own country with corporations
spying on each other and on their own employees.  The new head of the
CIA has claimed that economic espionage is the hottest current topic in
the Intelligence field.  And in April 1993 the FBI's industrial case
load leaped from ten to five hundred in only nine months.  So the film,
Bad Company, is not entirely a work of Ross Thomas' imagination.</P>
<P>     Nelson Crowe (Laurence Fishburne) is a CIA agent who is in
disfavor because he said he turned over some X millions of dollars to
"someone" as ordered by the CIA but he has no receipt and the "someone"
claims he never got paid.  Sounds like the Iran-Contra fiasco.</P>
<P>     The Agency tells Crowe to get a job with The Grimes Corporation,
get the goods on them and get back his own good standing with the CIA.
The Grimes Corporation does all sorts of spying and frequently uses the
information it gains to blackmail and pick up a few extra millions for
itself here and there.  (You cannot trust anyone these days.)  That,
you will agree, could give spying a bad name.</P>
<P>     All would have been well for Crowe who did start out to do an
honest job of infiltration but along the way he got a bit greedy
himself.   This was not entirely unexpected because the President of
the Grimes Corp, Vic Grimes (Frank Langella) has as his right-hand
"man" an unscrupulous and pretty woman, Margaret Wells (Ellen Barkin).</P>
<P>     The dialogue is good, the action moves nicely, the actors are
first-class but somehow the film does not come up with that necessary
"something" to set it in a class by itself.  Maybe it is the number of
fornicating scenes and that they seem to go on so long that the
tendency is to laugh.  That will kill an espionage film in a hurry.
Whatever.  It could have been a better film.</P>
