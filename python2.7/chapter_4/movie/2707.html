<PRE>                                   TRUE LIES
                       A film review by Roger A. Rubio
                        Copyright 1994 Roger A. Rubio</PRE>
<P>Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, and
         Charlton Heston
Directed by James Cameron</P>
<P>     Wow!  This movie was an amazing flick.  Jaw-dropping special
effects, action sequences, light-hearted humor, something for
everyone.  Schwarzenegger is on the come-back trail, but this movie
doesn't quite do it yet.  Keep it going, Arnie, you're doing good.</P>
<P>     TRUE LIES is the story of Harry Tasker, a secret agent busy
thwarting nuclear threats and saving the world from certain
destruction, while convincingly lying to his wife that he's a computer
sales representative for fifteen years.  A little implausible, but
pulled off expertly by both Cameron and Schwarzenegger.  TRUE LIES is
based on a French film (the name escapes me right now) of the same
plot.  Arnie suggested that Cameron remake it, and TRUE LIES is the
result.  It took seven months to shoot the entire thing, costing a
reported $100 million.  The result is worth watching.</P>
<P>     Jamie Lee Curtis was not the actress I would have picked for the
role of Helen Tasker, Harry's wife, but she proved me wrong.  Curtis
pulls off both a shy, reserved wife, and later, a sexy, desirable woman
that can play all kinds of roles.  Tom Arnold steals the show with all
the good, snide remarks he has, and finally proves he can act.  Arnie
is back in full form as a gun-toting action hero, and finally
acknowledges not to make fun of the genre that made him famous.  Every
character in this movie has character, which is a trait lacking in most
action movies nowadays, and is a little refreshing.</P>
<P>     TRUE LIES marks the first film where Digital Domain took over for
the digital special effects, and they are a sight to see for their
first outing.  An overall good start for a fledgling special effects
house.  Most of the effects are hard to find, which is the way it
should be.  The use of the effects is outstanding, and nothing looks
too hokey.  You can always tell where they had to use special effects,
but Cameron uses them so well you don't care.</P>
<P>     A definite recommendation.  It's definitely worth full price at
the box office.</P>
