Starring: Chris Rock, Regina King, Eugene Levy, Chazz Palminteri, Frankie 
Faison, Mark Addy, Jennifer Coolige, Greg Germann.
Directed by: Paul and Chris Weitz
Running Time: 87 Minutes
Rated PG-13: sexual humor, language.</P>
<P>Good natured comedies are sometimes a rarity. Most comedies out in the past 
year have either been raunchy (Road Trip), Stupid (Dude, Where's My Car), or 
just plain bad (Urban Legends: Final Cut...wait that wasn't a comedy). Its 
nice to know that some filmmakers out there still make these good natured 
comedies, and Chris Rock's new vehicle "Down to Earth" is one of them. It's 
funny, but also at the same time has a sweet side to it, and in the end 
delivers a good message.</P>
<P>Lance Barton is a struggling comedian, he wants to be at the Apollo and 
perform his comedy and not be booed off the stage (his nickname to his 
friends is Booie). On his way home from a bad show, he is hit by a truck when 
he sees a beautiful girl while riding his bike. He arrives in Heaven just in 
time, of course not realizing what happened, he thinks he is dreaming. 
Convinced by Keyes (Eugene Levy) and King (Chazz Palminteri) that he is 
indeed not dreaming, he finds out that Keyes took him 42 years early. For the 
mistake they tell him he can go back to Earth in another person's body, and 
live their life. The body he chooses is a older man by the name of Charles 
Wellington.</P>
<P>Wellington the 15th richest man in the world, is having a problem however, 
his wife is cheating on him, and his wife and her love (his personal 
secretary) just tried to kill him. To add to the muck, Charles has died and 
Lance has taken over his body. Now as Charles Wellington, Lance must fit in, 
in the world and try to convince the love of his life Sontee (a person very 
angry at him) that he is in fact someone else.</P>
<P>Many of the jokes in Down to Earth work, however some do not, and fall flat 
on their face at times as well. The acting is one of a mediocre scale, Chris 
Rock who I think is a better comedian than actor does a good job in the main 
role as Lance Barton, Regina King is sexy and realistic as the love interest, 
Eugene Levy and Chazz Palminteri make a great comedic duo as the angels. The 
standouts however are the maids and servant of Charles Wellington. Mark Addy 
of "The Full Monty" fame, does a great job playing his personal servant 
comedically named Cisco. Wanda Skyes plays Wanda, the loud mouthed but inside 
sweet maid is very funny.</P>
<P>Chris and Paul Weitz directed a little teen movie in 1999 that went on to 
make $102m domestically. That little film was "American Pie", and now two 
years later they are back, directing a comedy is hard to do, because you 
don't need any fancy camera shots, or special effects. "Down To Earth" really 
doesn't have any of these, but the direction however is good, the actors all 
do the right things, and the major flaws come from the story and the overall 
tone of the film. It doesn't seem as funny as one would want it to be, and 
story is at times pretentious.</P>
<P>Besides these flaws, "Down to Earth" is a clever little comedy, that is a 
remake of the Warren Beatty classic "Heaven Can Wait". In the end, its worth 
the watch, and worth sitting through its (too) short running time of only 87 
minutes, cramming in everything it can. </P>
