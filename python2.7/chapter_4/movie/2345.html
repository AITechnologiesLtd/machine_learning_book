<PRE>                                    CABIN BOY
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael John Legeros</PRE>

                                     - uncredited quote on title card</PRE>
<P>     David Letterman and Conan O'Brien TV sidekick Andy Ritcher
starring in a comedy produced by Tim Burton?</P>
<PRE>     What!?!?</PRE>
<P>     Believe it or not, both appear in the goofy Chris Elliott vehicle
CABIN BOY.  Elliott, of course, is an old Letterman alumni who went on
"bigger things," including his show "Get a Life" on Fox.  Now, Bob
Elliott's boy has gone and got his own movie.  And, believe or it not,
it's actually kinda funny.</P>
<P>     Elliott stars as Nathaniel, the prim but quite obnoxious student
of a fine finishing school.  On graduation day, he's supposed to catch
a cruise ship to Hawaii where he'll work for his rich father (guess who
plays him? :)  But, true to slapstick convention, young Nathan goes to
the wrong seaport and boards the wrong boat.</P>
<P>     He hops onto a fetid fishing boat (called The Filthy Whore) and
joins its rag-tag, drunken crew of five thinking that he's booked on a
"theme cruise."  Only when he's several miles out to sea does our
not-very-intrepid hero learn the bitter truth.</P>
<P>     And, since he's a moron, he manages to steer the boat straight
into "Hell's Bucket"--an uncharted region populated by all manner of
supernatural creatures....</P>
<P>     CABIN BOY is a strange piece of work.  With a supporting cast
that includes a giant, a six-armed siren, and a half-man/half-shark,
the film feels like a lower budget version of Terry Jones' ERIK THE
VIKING.  That film, if you recall, successfully combined droll comedy
with strong fantasy.</P>
<P>     In CABIN BOY, both the comedy and fantasy are substantially
subdued, but no less enjoyable.  What other film this year is likely to
feature giant flying cupcakes that spit tobacco?  Or gusting winds that
are blown by clouds with human faces?</P>
<PRE>     This would be great kid's stuff, if not for the language.</PRE>
<P>     The humor--like the film itself--is spotty in spots.  The jokes
vary in quality, but the cast gets off some good one-liners.  Make a
few provisions for the slower moments, mix in the fantasy, and you get
one very goofy movie.</P>
<P>     As expected, Chris Elliott plays Chris Elliott.  If you enjoy his
grating speech and effeminate mannerisms, then he'll amuse.  His
shipmates are a motley crew of familiar character actors.  They have a
whale of a time overacting and shouting nonsense like "Holy Christ in a
dump truck."  Newcomer Melora Walters is a waste as Elliott's "love
interest," but she gets good lines like "I'm always flattered when a
psychotic gets smitten on me."</P>
<P>     And, any casting deficiencies are overcome by the periodic
appearances of more-famous faces.  Blink and you'll miss Ricki Lake,
Russ Tamblyn, or Bob Elliott.</P>
<P>(Letterman shows up early--you can't miss him.)</P>
<PRE>Bottom line: CABIN BOY is strict sitcom fare, with an unexpectedly
             strong fantasy element.  The result is a lively and
             disposable comedy that's worth a look, if nothing
             else, for David Letterman's (first?) film appearance.
Grade: B-</PRE>
