<PRE>One Day in September
A film review by Julia Levin
Copyright © 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The current crisis in the Middle East, with its painful controversy
regarding the sovereignty over Temple Mount, makes the timing for the
documentary One Day in September (Best Documentary Oscar: 1999)
perfect.  The film presents the historical events of the 1972 Munich
Olympics, when Palestinian terrorists took Israeli athletes hostage and
interrupted the Games.  The filmmakers use actual footage taken at the
time, interviews with German officials and children of the victims,
clips from television news reports, and interviews with the only
surviving terrorist who participated in the attack, Jamal Al Gashey.</P>
<P>The film starts off on a personal note: Ankie Spitzer, a widow of one of
the Israeli athletes kept as a hostage, recalls their happy marriage and
anticipation of coming to the Olympic games.  Giving the tragedy a human
face underlines the message of the film: At the core of every political
game, human life and death are nothing more than a by-product of
political cruelty.  Objectively, it gives a succinct summary of why the
1972 Olympics, besides being as political as Olympic Games always are,
were so particularly important to both Germans and Israelis. 
Subjectively, and understandably so, the film is pro-Israeli: If members
of Israeli team are presented as exemplary citizens -- young, ambitions,
with families and babies -- Palestinians are shown receiving training in
violence, hiding as Zionist refugees in Lebanon and Libya, carrying out
their terrorist acts with anonymous brutality (as they don't even know
the target of their attack until very late).  Thus, in addition and
perhaps without realizing it, the film exemplifies why cinema is such a
powerful and dangerous medium; One Day in September is an adroitly
constructed yet highly manipulative film.</P>
<P>Once the film gets to its point by recreating the actual events that
took place on the day of the attack, September 5, 1972, it tries to
create suspense by applying slow motion shots and stirring music score
punctuated with pounding sounds of a heart beat.  This technique is
powerful and gripping, but the real achievement of the film is in its
detailed reconstruction of the events that led to the atrocity.  It is
almost impossible to believe how it was all allowed to happen -- in a
small apartment in the Olympic Village nine athletes were held hostage,
one was killed and another was left to bleed to death, but the festival
of sport continued as if nothing happened.  Debunking the idea of the
Olympic Games as a festive celebration in peace and harmony, the
filmmakers describe step-by-step how, in the middle of public and media
attention, German officials absolved themselves from the terrorist
attack and resumed the competition.  The film then details exactly how
the police, lacking an anti-terrorist squad, proper security, and
turning down help from the Israelis, ignominiously failed to save
hostages by attempting to carry out an ill-conceived maneuver.  The
result of this drama is devastating and ghastly.</P>
<P>Despite the fact that One Day in September might upset a lot of people
for being manipulative and one-sided, this historical account is
shocking, jarring, and unequivocally worth seeing.</P>
