<PRE>                   DANCING AT LUGHNASA (US/Irish)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: Change comes to a household of five unmarried sisters
during the Donegal, Ireland summer of 1936.  Some well-observed
performances, but this is not a film in which a whole not happens.  It
is unusual for Meryl Streep to play so negative a person, though she
does make the character understandable.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), 2 (-4 to
+4)</P>
<P>   - Kate (Meryl Streep), Christine, her out-of-wedlock son Michael,
     Agnes, Maggie, and Rose live in a small cottage.  Michael (as a
     man many years later) is the narrator.
   - Kate, the eldest, is a self-righteous tyrant.  In town she is
     everybody's least favorite schoolteacher, cruelly but well-
     nicknamed "the gander".  She is incredibly judgmental and
     inflexible.  Always can sum up in one or two well-chosen sentences
     why someone else should be serious and should not enjoy life.
   - Two visitors come this summer.  Uncle Jack (Michael Gambon), a
     missionary physically back from Africa, mentally still there.
     Also visiting is Jack Evans, Michael's handsome father, on his way
     to fight for the Republicans in Spain.
   - A Michael Gambon performance is always worth seeing.
   - Nice photography of Irish country life.
   - Puritanical Kate is fighting the coming of change.
   - Rose is a little simple-minded and is tempted to go off with Danny
     Bradley who is married but separated.
   - Michael has no memories of his father and father must win over
     son.
   - Uncle Jack is like the fool in KING LEAR.  From his strange and
     addled mind come the most logical thoughts.
   - A different and mostly unsympathetic role for Streep.
   - Interface of religion and two different kinds of paganism.
   - Release will probably be in November accompanied by ads in Variety
     saying "For your consideration..."</P>
