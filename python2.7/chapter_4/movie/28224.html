<P>   Truck drivers pick up people however weird-looking
because they presumably know what it's like to be stranded
on a desolate highway, front tire blown out.  Of course they're
looking for some conversation as well on their lonely treks
across great expanses of road.  Some time after a driver
named Clive (Ian Hart--who for my money looks a
lot like a  Donald O'Connor from "Singin' in the Rain") gives a
lift to an older man with a young woman on a European
highway, he concludes that they are "strange but nice." 
That's about best way to describe the father-daughter
combination of Tomas (Stellan Skarsgard) and Kaisa (Lena
Headey) in "Aberdeen," Hans Petter Moland's road movie that
combines a delayed coming of age drama with the possibility
of family redemption.  Often theatrical as though to show off
the considerable talent of its essentially four-person cast,
"Aberdeen" will remind moviegoers of Mike Figgis's "Leaving
Las Vegas" with fragments of such drug-or-drink related films
as "Trainspotting" (because of the Scottish influence),
"Requiem for a Dream," and even the great classic with
Welsh-born Ray Milland, Billy Wilder's unrelenting story of
alcoholism, "The Lost Weekend."  If "Aberdeen" breaks no
new ground--unlike the film that introduced Mr. Skarsgard to a
world audience, "Breaking the Waves"--there's some mighty
powerful acting at work here.  Sparks fly.</P>
<P>   When we see a flashback of Kaisa's relationship with her
dad when she was about ten years old, jumping into his arms
as he arrives home from work in their rural Scottish town, we
can understand how she had the motivation to become a
lawyer.  What is not clear at first, given the disposition of
psychologists to say that a woman's relationship with men is
dependent on her connection with her dad, is why she seems
to prefer sex with a bevy of men whose names she cannot
remember to a steady alliance with a good guy. But that
insight comes soon enough, when her mother (Charlotte
Rampling), now dying of cancer in Aberdeen's St. Ruth's
Infirmary, asks her London-based daughter to pick up Tomas
from his workplace on a rig on Norway (shades of "Breaking
the Waves"!).  What she finds is an out-of-work man broken
down by alcoholism and, in a role reversal more commonly
found when aging parents are afflicted with ailments like
Alzheimer's, the child becomes mother to the man.  </P>
<P>   Director Moland ("Zero Kelvin," "The Last Lieutenant") takes
us on a ride from London to Norway to Scotland which
inevitably means trouble for the booze-addicted dad and her
cocaine-snorting daughter.  One blown tire and the odd
couple sign on to a truck ride with Clive who is surprisingly
adept at straightening them out and who himself is plunged
into an adventure he never could have imagined.</P>
<P>   "Aberdeen" recalls elements in the relationship between
characters played by Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue in
another downer, "Leaving Las Vegas," though Ms. Headey's
character is a lot freer with her language and Mr. Skarsgard
not quite ready to do himself in like the unhappy fellow who
makes what he considers his final trip to Nevada.  As we
soak in Philip Ogaard's lensing of some less-than-touristic
areas of Scotland and Norway, we see the three folks in a
truck act out a great drama in their lives, with Lena Headey
giving Stellan Skarsgard more than suitable histrionics as a
successful lawyer who resorts to various antics including
physical violence against a group of muggers.  She looks
darn good even when cut, bruised and bandaged while
Skarsgard is terrific, speaking fluent English with a thoroughly
American accent.</P>
