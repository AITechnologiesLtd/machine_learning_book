HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In the most anticipated movie of the holiday season, Jim Carrey 
recreates Boris Karloff's famous Grinch role in HOW THE GRINCH STOLE 
CHRISTMAS.  Based on the well-known Dr. Seuss story, the Jim Carrey 
version, directed by Ron Howard (EdTV), is a live-action movie.  The 
1966 television original, an annual Christmas tradition in the Rhodes 
household, is an animated film.  Even if the remake pales in comparison 
to the original, it is a cute and funny movie in its own right.</P>
<P>As you probably know, the Grinch is a "bah humbug" kind of guy who tries 
to keep Christmas from coming to the sweet Whos by stealing all of their 
presents and decorations.  In a tribute to the original show and book, 
the remake keeps most of the lines but adds in more story in order to 
triple the length of the original half-hour show.  In a flashback to the 
Grinch's childhood, we finally get some insights into what made him into 
the quintessential crab.</P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins, as the narrator, is the perfect choice to replace Boris 
Karloff, whose voice was the best part of the original production.  With 
the exception of his speeding up and slurring a few lines, Hopkins 
provides a wonderful rendition of the Seuss rhyme.</P>
<P>In order to accurately recreate the Seuss images, production designer 
Michael Corenblith carefully reviewed the illustrations in all of the 
Seuss books.  With this knowledge he created a visual vocabulary in 
order to ensure that every tower and every bridge would be as close as 
possible to what Dr. Seuss would have imagined them.  The inventive 
result is a snow-covered cross between WILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE 
FACTORY and THE WIZARD OF OZ.</P>
<P>Five-time Academy Award winner Rick Baker's special make-up effects turn 
Carrey into a creature bearing little resemblance to the man inside the 
suit.  Only Carrey's expressive mouth is recognizable.</P>
<P>The story's laughs come from both the gadgets and the dialog.  Martha 
May Whovier (Christine Baranski), for example, is able to outdo her 
neighbor Betty Lou Who (Molly Shannon) through the aid of a 
Gatling-style machine gun for shooting Christmas lights onto the outside 
of her house.</P>
<P>When the Grinch first checks his heart, he declares proudly, "Down a 
size and a half, and this time I'll keep it off."  This is a guy whose 
daily calendar entries include, "wallow in self-pity" and "solve world 
hunger -- tell no one."  Working against his desire for grumpiness is 
one little Cindy Lou Who, played sweetly by Taylor Momsen in her major 
motion picture debut.  She sees goodness in the Grinch that others 
don't.  And when he tries to scare her with massive screaming, she tells 
him, "Maybe you need a time out."</P>
<P>One of the funniest scenes occurs when the toddler Grinch is offered 
Christmas cookies on a plate made in the image of Santa Claus.  Biting 
off Santa's head rather than eating a cookie, the little Grinch 
announces, "Santa, bye-bye."</P>
<P>Sometimes, it's the small things that make a difference.  The sweet 
little dog, Max, in this version is a wonderful dog who acts and even 
looks kind of like the original.  I like that.</P>
<P>HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS runs 1:38.  It is rated PG for crude 
humor and would be acceptable for all ages.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, thought this version was funnier than the 
original, but not better.  He gave it ***, mentioning how much he liked 
the gadgets.  His sole complaint was that only Cindy Lou Who and the 
Grinch were fully developed characters. </P>
