<P>A few leans years after ingratiating such popular sayings as "schwing" and
"party on" into our modern-day American lexicon, real-life Canuck Mike Myers
returns to the big screen with another original shagadelic tale of unhip hip
characters with unique styles, tastes and one-liners of their own.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Austin Powers, the international man of mystery and hipster extraordinaire,
cryogenically freezes himself for 30 years in order to follow his nemesis,
Dr. Evil, through his frozen path into the year 1997. In the future, both
men soon discover that the simpler times of the 60s has been replaced by the
rapid-paced lifestyles of the 90s.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
In the infamous words of Dr. Evil, with his pinky finger diabolically
strangling off his mouth, this movie is frickin' clever, man...no need to
throw anyone a bone here, man! It's got plenty of kitchy-retro style, a
groovy soundtrack, a handful of over-the-top but humorous characters, Mike
Myers, who plays both of his characters brilliantly, and a sexy Elizabeth
Hurley, purring her way through one of the most purposely overdone and
sexist scripts ever to hit the big screen. I personally didn't find any
particular scenes laugh out loud funny, but did appreciate almost all the
humor in this film, which placed its tongue deep inside the cheek of our
favorite James Bond spy flicks from that era.</P>
<P>Will everyone like it? Certainly not. This film will only appeal to those
swingers that are "in on the joke" and who could appreciate such low-brow
entertainment tactics as jokes featuring penis-enlargement pumps and a man
peeing for close to a minute...on-screen. All in all, I was taken in by this
film's utter originality, unique dialogue, smashing characters,
self-deprecating attitude and Mike Myers' superb performances as both Austin
Powers and Dr. Evil. But most of all, I was taken in by this film's
infectious enthusiasm, which should lasso in most open-minded lovers of
Myers' earlier forays into the World of Wayne. The rest of you could either
take it or shag it, baby! Now does that make you horny??</P>
<P>My favorite line came by the way of Austin Powers himself: "Do you like to
wash up a bit before? Personally, before I'm on the job I like to give me
undercarriage a bit of a "How's your father."</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film contains two major cameos by actress Carrie Fisher, better known
to some as Princess Leia, and big goof Tom Arnold, better known to some as
the big goof. Other much smaller cameos include Will Ferrell (as Mustafa),
Cheri Oteri (as Flight attendant), Susanna Hoffs (ex-Bangle singer as Ming
Tea Member-note that she is married to the director of this film, Jay
Roach), Rob Lowe (as friend of Security Guard), Christian Slater (as Easily
Fooled Security Guard) and Matthew Sweet (as Ming Tea Member). Model/major
babe Cindy Margolis also plays one of the Fembots in this movie.
Mike Myers won two 1998 MTV Movie Awards for this film. One for the Best
Dance Sequence for "Some London Citizens", to which he dedicated his award
to his recently deceased friend Phil Hartman, and Best Villain, for his
portrayal of Dr. Evil.
One of the producers of this film is none other than the ex-wife of actor
Bruce Willis, and popular actress in her own right, Demi Moore.
In one sequence, a fashion photographer shoots '60s fashions, and the
clothes, which look like outlandish science-fiction fantasies, are in fact
identical to costumes worn during posing sessions in Michelangelo
Antonioni's 1966 film BLOW UP. The tuneful ring of Austin's picturephone is
the same as the hotline phone in the 1965 film OUR MAN FLINT.
Please note the obvious poke at the outrageous Bond girl name of Pussy
Galore, by the way of the femme fatale in this film called, Alotta Fagina.
Richie Cunningham, the name that Austin uses to introduce himself to Number
2, is actually Ron Howard's character name from the popular 60s-based TV
sitcom "Happy Days". Ron's brother, Clint Howard, also has a small part in
this film as Ritter, the radar operator.</P>
