<PRE>**** out of ****  (A MASTERPIECE)</PRE>
<PRE>"Some day I shall understand"</PRE>
<P>Sidney Lumet's film "DANIEL" and E.L. Doctorow's novel "The Book of
Daniel", which it is based upon, are inspired by the controversial
historical case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.</P>
<P>At first some words about the complex story. Paul and Rochelle Isaacson
(Mandy Patinkin, Lindsay Crouse) were executed in the early 1950s for
alleged espionage. Their children Daniel and Susan can't get over this.
In the late 1960s, after an attempted suicide of his politically more
active sister Susan (played by Amanda Plummer), the rather unpolitical
Daniel (Timothy Hutton) tries to find out what exactly happened in the
past, tries to understand his parents' lives, tries to help his sister
and to get along with his own live ...</P>
<P>In the first place "DANIEL" is about the effects of parents' lives on
the lives of their children and about the wish of human beings to
understand their parents. Lumet said in a Village Voice interview: "To
me, 'DANIEL' is the story of a boy who buries himself with his parents,
and spends the rest of his life trying to climb out of the grave." But
the multi-layered film deals with other problems as well. Through a
complex flashback structure it illuminates from Daniel's view the
history of the American left from the 1930s to the late 1960s, including
the different left movements. In its criticism of death penalty and
McCarthyism, the film is also a political statement.</P>
<P>Sidney Lumet is one of the masters of the American cinema. He has given
us the masterpieces "12 ANGRY MEN", "LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT",
"THE PAWNBROKER", "THE HILL", "SERPICO", "DOG DAY AFTERNOON", "NETWORK",
"PRINCE OF THE CITY", "THE VERDICT" and "RUNNING ON EMPTY". Lumet
himself is politically left-leaning, and "DANIEL" is probably one of his
most personal works. It was about seven years before he got the chance
to realize this project. Many people who worked on "DANIEL" helped him
by taking only the minimum salary set by the union. Timothy Hutton, for
instance, turned down a million-dollar offer on a film and worked on
"DANIEL" instead for about 25000 dollars.</P>
<P>And Lumet is right when he writes in his book "Making Movies": "Despite
its critical and financial failure, I think it's one of the best
pictures I've ever done." The film proves again Lumet's ability to tell
complex, emotionally absorbing, unsentimental stories. Everything works
in this uncompromising film. Doctorow provided an extraordinarily
multi-layered screenplay. Timothy Hutton (who later starred with Nick
Nolte and Armand Assante in Lumet's very good cop thriller "Q & A"),
Edward Asner, Lindsay Crouse, Mandy Patinkin, Ilan M. Mitchell-Smith
(who plays the young Daniel in the early 1950s) and Amanda Plummer stand
out in a good cast. The fine cinematography supports the flashback
structure by a careful use of color filters. The rich soundtrack, mainly
consisting of songs interpreted by Paul Robeson, perfectly fits and
illustrates the film's themes. The editing is excellent as well (a good
example is the brilliantly filmed end sequence).</P>
<P>An especially moving scene of the film, also showing Lumet's typically
great use of the city of New York, is a sequence in which young Daniel
and young Susan (played by Ilan M. Mitchell-Smith and Jena Greco) walk
through New York in search of their home.</P>
<P>"DANIEL" is a must-see. Of course, don't expect standard Hollywood
entertainment, but a serious work. See also Sidney Lumet's later drama
"RUNNING ON EMPTY" (starring River Phoenix, Christine Lahti and Judd
Hirsch), another masterful movie about similar themes.</P>
