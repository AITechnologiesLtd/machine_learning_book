<PRE>Wild Things</PRE>
<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>I suppose it has to be one of the sleaziest films I've ever seen. It also
has to be one of the most sexual, and most ambiguous. But since when have
things like that stopped normal American's from having a good time? Doesn't
anyone remember Basic Instinct, which turned an ice pick from a kitchen
utensil to the weapon of choice for murders, or Fatal Attraction, in which
the rabbit being killed became a cultural icon? What about Body of Evidence,
which asked if you could screw someone to death and gave us Madonna to prove
the point?</P>
<P>Wild Things is the newest in the lasting trend of movies intertwining sex,
violence, and mystery in a way we can't help think of as fun. It pits in
Kevin Bacon doing a decent job, Matt Dillon doing his normal great, and Neve
Campbell and Teresa Russell getting good roles early on in their careers. I
won't tell you much, only that there's one plot twist after the next in this
movie that hides a brain behind a bunch of sex and lies (and even a bit of
videotape, too). No one's the good guy, everyone's the bad guy, and you get
to watch a mystery unravel before your eyes… while seeing and the sex we've
come to expect from a movie with a threesome in it.</P>
<P>It's controversial. It's something the Christian coalition will hate and the
Vatican will declare a sacrilege, but, by god, it's fun to watch.</P>
