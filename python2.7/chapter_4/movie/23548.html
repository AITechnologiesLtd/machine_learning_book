The Green Mile  (6/10)</PRE>
<P>Writer-director Frank Darabont has obviously got a thing about
inspirational period prison dramas based on Stephen King stories. With
The Shawshank Redemption, he made a film which, although not a great
commercial success on its original release, has since had a strange
cultural impact, making it onto many moviegoers' lists of all-time
favourites. With The Green Mile, Darabont has taken a superficially
similar King story and tried to tap into the same popular appetite for
uplifting tales of decent human beings rising above brutality and
injustice, but I think The Green Mile will disappoint many admirers of
Shawshank.</P>
<P>Tom Hanks stars as a death row prison guard who takes delivery of an
unusual new inmate to await execution - a gentle and slow-witted black
giant (played by Michael Clarke Duncan) convicted of the murder of two
young white girls. The prison regime, with its mundane distractions
filling time between the horrifying electrocutions, is nicely developed
and impeccably crafted. Then the relationship between the guard and his
new charge takes a mystical turn, at which point the film basically
falls apart, and none of the top-drawer production design, acting and
photography on display can save it.</P>
<P>Apart from Kubrick's The Shining, which King hated, I've always thought
that the films based on King's non-spooky stories, such as Shawshank and
Stand By Me, have worked better than those inspired by his supernatural
tales. But with The Green Mile, we get an ill-judged mixture of the
magical and the earthly. First, we're asked to accept that rather than
sitting in a multiplex surrounded by popcorn-munching filmgoers, we are
in a prison in 1930s Louisiana. Fine. I'll go along with that. That's
what I'm here for. Then, disbelief nicely suspended, we are asked to
abandon the alternative reality we've agreed to inhabit and construct a
new one so we can swallow a bunch of miracles, complete with bright
lights and spooky manifestations. Give me a break. In fantasy films, the
impossible thing we're meant to believe in for a couple of hours must be
introduced, or at least alluded to, from the start so we have a chance
to get used to the idea and give ourselves over to it. Introducing
unexpected miraculous elements into an established earthly story is to
trample on well-established conventions. Imagine an episode of NYPD Blue
in which Andy Sipowitz is abducted by aliens. Doesn't work, does it?
Even if the mystical thrust of the story had been established from the
start, our credulity would still have been severely tested by the sheer
niceness of the prison staff - apart from one enjoyably sadistic and
slimy guard (played by Doug Hutchison) they are probably the most
thoughtful and decent bunch every to fry people for  living.</P>
<P>Although beautifully made, The Green Mile is let down by its bolted-on
mystical elements and its crude religious allegory. It also suffers from
the sort of sentimentality that Steven Spielberg is criticised for,
often unfairly. After a bum-numbing three hours plus, I felt I'd served
my time and was glad to be released.</P>
