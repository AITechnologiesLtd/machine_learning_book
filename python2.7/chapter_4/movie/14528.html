<P>There exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie
and a successful suspense movie. Action movies are typically devoid of
plot other than a simple byline which can string together several
explosive sequences, while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety
and the ability to bring everything full-circle. For fans of both
genres, however, realism is key. Action fans want to know that the
weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic, and suspense
fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the
movie's end. On this advice, Director John Frankenheimer (THE ISLAND OF
DR. MOREAU) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of
suspense and action for his latest thriller, RONIN. </P>
<P>The depth of intrigue in RONIN is quite amazing, considering the fare
that's fallen into the same category over the last few years. The
script, written by J.D. Zeik in his big-screen debut, approaches levels
of complexity that had people spinning away from MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE two
years ago. A certain number of people will be lost by this, but
afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times.
Frankenheimer masters the script with poise, and tells us a dark but
stoically realistic tale of a group of post-Cold War mercenaries working
to earn their paycheck. His ability to convey feeling and character
while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here, and
RONIN becomes a better movie because of it. </P>
<P>Robert De Niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that
is the most outstanding of his in quite some time. He takes command and
offers much gravity as the ex-spy Sam, a man who's called to France to
help a shady operations controller named Dierdre (Natascha McElhone)
recover a package. The package becomes the central motivator for the
entire cast, especially once the requisite double-crossing begins, and
its role is skillfully penned by Zeik. At times, however, Zeik's tale
becomes almost too reminiscent of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - De Niro might
easily become Tom Cruise, the package might become Cruise's computer
disk. Fortunately, the focus here is almost entirely on the package,
whereas in MISSION the script was more concerned with the double-cross
and why it happened. </P>
<P>The action content is impressive, and it lives up to the hints given in
previews. The only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect
full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through
moments of slowness. RONIN does take a degree of intelligence to follow
all of the nuance from start to finish, but even the uninitiated will be
able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots. The suspense
tapers off considerably by the end, a bit of a drawback because of its
height at the movie's open. Considering these factors it's good to see
that RONIN was a project that turned out well, and it's another good bet
this month. Since quality is usually sparse during the early fall
months, it's definitely worth the visit.</P>
