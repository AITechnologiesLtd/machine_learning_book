<PRE>George of the Jungle (1997)
Rating: *** out of *****

Cleese.

Rated: PG</PRE>
<P>Call me a sucker for cheesy movies that admit their intentions from the
very beginning. Ever since the trailers for this movie were released, no
one could deny this movie was going to be the mecca of cheese. Let's just
say the movie delivers.</P>
<P>Almost a faithful translation of the original cartoon, replete with a new
rendition of the "George" theme by the Presidents of the United States of
America" and our good old faithful narrator, "George of the Jungle" offers
up the "so bad it's good" tradition of film-making.</P>
<P>The cast gives the usual cardboard performances common to most slapstick
children's films, especially Fraser who pulls a Keanu as George by not
really altering his voice to match his wild upbringing, but on the whole
the movie entertains. Fart jokes are not my style, though, and the last
fifteen minutes seem to be crammed with this type of humor. Only one
scene, involving yet another of my pet peeves: the face in the fecal
matter, actually comes off as being one of the better scenes in the film,
if not only for the scene that directly appears afterward.</P>
<P>Dana Olsen and Audrey Wells know their comedy fairly well, but their best
writing actually comes out of the relationship between Ursula and her best
friend (Kelly Miller). One almost longs to see a movie exclusively about
the two of them because the scenes with them seem to ring the truest.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast is rounded out by Thomas Haden Church (Wings, Ned and
Stacey) as the jerk boyfriend of Ursula who has a run in with the local
African law, John Cleese (A Fish Called Wanda, Monty Python and the Holy
Grail) as the voice of the ultra-intelligent Ape who must disguise his
true nature whenever Ursula is around, and Greg Cruttwell (2 Days in the
Valley) and Abraham Benrubi (Kubiack from Parker Lewis Can't Lose) as a
pair of bumbling hunters out to
find the mysterious "White Ape".</P>
<P>Be sure to stick around several minutes into the credits to catch a
rendition of "My Way" you won't soon forget.</P>
