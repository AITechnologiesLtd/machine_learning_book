<PRE>                                  SISTERS
                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp

<P>        Throw some shots of a vaguely menacing fetus over the opening credits,
toss in a brash score by Bernard Hermann, and you're off and running. 
Is the baby gonna eat it's way out of the mother?  Is there going to be
some sort of killer baby run amok, a la some Larry Cohen flick, in Brian
De Palma's Sisters (now out on DVD)?  Nope.  False alarm.  This sequence
is pretty cool, but we don't have a mutant killer baby slashing up
victims -- that honor goes to Margot (Superman) Kidder.</P>
<P>        We start off with De Palma's favorite theme: voyeurism.  On a corny
television program called Peeping Toms, the candid camera guest, Philip
(likeable Lisle Wilson) has to choose whether or not to let a blind
woman know he's in her dressing room when she's changing clothes.  He
opts to be a gentleman and leave the room before she takes off her
brassiere.</P>
<P>        The audience rewards him with a free dinner at an African restaurant,
since he's a black guy.  It's a bold, politically incorrect move which
wouldn't be done nowadays.  Brian De Palma had previously satirized race
in Hi, Mom!, but he eschews that here in favor of Hitchcockian
trickery.  Philip goes out on a date with the blind woman, who was
really a French-Canadian model living on Staten Island, Danielle
(Kidder, natch).</P>
<P>        After a nice trip back to her apartment for some pre-AIDS casual sex,
our would-be hero Philip learns that Danielle has a twin and it's their
collective birthday.  He buys them a cake and brings it back to
Danielle's place.  Unfortunately for him, the deranged sister (also
Kidder) is waiting for him and she ain't interested in cutting the cake.</P>
<P>        The film, of course, is Psycho.  We follow a hero through the first
half of the story only to have him hastily dispatched.  Our Norman Bates
comes in the form of Danielle, maybe, since it's never clear whether
she's the psycho killer or it's her twin sister.</P>
<P>        Our focus shifts to a nosy reporter who lives next door (played by
brassy Jennifer Salt) who has witnessed the killing through her window. 
Whether this is an homage to Rear Window or outright theft is
debatable.  Of course, those lousy police won't lift a finger to help
her since she gave them some negative press.</P>
<P>        We have the obligatory and painfully unfunny scenes where she tries to
gets the cops to investigate, complete with "who's on first" dialogue
not five minutes after we've seen a gory on-screen slaying.  De Palma
was never one for maintaining an even tone in his films, shifting wildly
from sadistic violence to slapstick.  I'm sure he'd call it "playing the
audience like a piano," since he's been trying to be Alfred Hitchcock
ever since 1973.</P>
<P>        The character development is minimal, the situation so over-the-top as
to prove laughable.  Margot Kidder embarrasses herself with a va-va-voom
French accent, but not so much as Jennifer "Pay Attention To Me" Salt.</P>
<P>        De Palma's camerawork is fairly mundane, except when he goes for his
split screen parallel action bit as the cops are closing in and the body
is being disposed.  It feels like an episode from some bad sitcom.  I
gotta clean up this mess before dad gets home!  Uh-oh!  Here comes dad! 
I'll just hide around this corner!</P>
<P>        As for the surreal dream sequence which closes the film, involving
black and white cinematography and an explanation of how that bizarre
doctor (William Finley) who's been scampering around throughout the film
is involved with the sisters, well, this turns the movie into a carnival
freakshow, complete with the seedy feeling of being ripped off
afterwards.  The half-jokey tone of the eleventh hour revelation
probably didn't even play well back in 1973.  It sure doesn't work
today.</P>
