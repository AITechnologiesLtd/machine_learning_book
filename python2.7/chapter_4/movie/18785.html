<PRE>                                EVEREST
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Nothing would suffice in making a movie about the tallest mountain
on earth than by showing it in the largest format on earth, as well.</P>
<P>     This 70mm IMAX film, which I saw on the country's largest movie
screen at the new San Francisco Sony Metreon (80 feet tall, 100 feet
wide), is nothing short of jaw-dropping spectacular.</P>
<P>     While the tale of Ed Viesturs climbing Mount Everest (for the fifth
time) is a good one, the story of the eight people from another party
who got stuck on the summit during a fierce storm – and died – almost
brings you to tears.  EVEREST is indeed larger than life.</P>
<P>     Of course, this is IMAX, and you go to see the spectacle of the
photography.  But remember, there's a guy carrying that enormous camera
up that mountain.  And a guy with a microphone.  And a tripod.  And
film.  And batteries.  The making of Everest is as phenomenal as the end
product.</P>
<PRE>     But in the end, of course, nothing can be bigger than the real
thing.</PRE>
