                       A film review by Ralf Benner
                        Copyright 1995 Ralf Benner</PRE>
<P>     Jeff Bridges moves right into the front ranks of American actors
with his performance as Max in Peter Weir's FEARLESS.  Because the
movie takes us deep into one of our worst fears--knowing that we could
die in a plane crash--Bridges's work here is a balancing act; he has to
make us believe in him as plane crash survivor, a savior and that he's
so full of bliss as a result of the crash that he's temporarily without
fear.  This series of character shifts would drive any really good actor
to boozing, because so much of what Max does is conveyed by thoughts
behind the eyes, behind the silences.  Movie actors rarely get into this
kind of cerebral communication, and maybe the only ones who'd dare to
try are those unafraid of the unrelenting, magnifying camera.  Bridges's
emotional marvel of an achievement is all the more singular in that
Weir puts the camera right on top of him.  Close-ups are perilous in
that they can distort as well as expose a lack of technique; when the
camera is practically breathing on them, most actors fall back on handy
poses and stares and audiences can sense that sometimes there's nothing
behind the masks.  This happens a lot to Robert Redford and Clint
Eastwood, occasionally to Robert Duvall.  Not here: as the camera moves
in, Bridges keeps right on going, holding back nothing; the close-in
camera accelerates his rapport with us, soothing our qualms. (In the
opposite direction, Michael Douglas's crowd-pleasing male bitchery gets
cheerfully speeded up when the camera gets in his face and we see the
flaws and nearly feel the fire breath coming out of him, but he's
safe--he's always playacting.) What makes unsafe Bridges a
revelation--and how good Weir is as director--is that while we can feel
the fears of the passengers and the haunted doubts and troubles of the
survivors, we're able to feel Max's sudden freedom from mortality as
our own anxieties are ever-increasing.  In that FEARLESS plays havoc
with our gloom-filled anticipations about what we know is coming, there
are times when we hate Weir for putting us through what would otherwise
seem like a depressing chronology of events from a TV
disaster-of-the-week film (in fact, Charlton Heston played in one, from
the pilot's perspective)--and some of us hated the movie company for
having the insensitivity to release this picture at a time when
millions of us would be flying over the holidays--but when the movie
climaxes and goes to black, we're absolutely wiped out yet strangely
exhilarated.  Some in the audience were crying, others sobbing, most of
us for a moment or two unable to move at all.  The impact rests on
Bridges's failure-proof hydraulics.  Has there ever been a more
reassuring face in a plane cabin, in life or on screen?</P>
<P>     Jeff Bridges has usually been an outsider looking in, big-time
success having eluded him despite appearing in more than twenty movies,
including THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, THE ICEMAN COMETH, KING KONG, WINTER
KILLS, BAD COMPANY, FAT CITY, SOMEBODY KILLED HER HUSBAND, CUTTER'S
WAY, THE MORNING AFTER, NADINE, the neglected TUCKER: THE MAN AND HIS
DREAM, THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS.  And in spite of scoring a mild success
with JAGGED EDGE, in which he pulled a Tommy Lee Jones from THE EYES OF
LAURA MARS: we're allowed to invest feelings in him, only to get
suckered.  His first Oscar nomination came for THE LAST PICTURE SHOW,
but it was his second Oscar-nominated performance, in THUNDERBOLT AND
LIGHTFOOt, that audiences perceived within him a loner's stir: he was
onto something unexpressed in his relationshp with Eastwood.  (And it's
what's not defined that has made the movie a cult favorite.)  I never
could get into STARMAN, for which he received his third nom, because it
committed very early on one of those entertainment no-nos by having
something called Karen Allen as a romantic co-star.  (Hiring her for any
movie is like breaking the unspoken law about having babies and kids in
soap operas: that is, no Allen, no babies and only kids who are bad
seeds.)  AGAINST ALL ODDS was a totally unnecessary remake of the
classic film noir OUT OF THE PAST, but certainly watchable: with
bronzy flesh, muscular chest, closely-cropped beard and sun-bleached
hair, Bridges's blue eyes stand out more than usual; they have the
deepest blue center and this blue bleeds to the outer perimeters in
lighter and lighter shades.  Faked? Maybe, yet he's never looked this
attractive before or since and I can't begin to tell you how much this
helps the movie, which is filled with a ton of ludicrous moments, the
most hilarious not the banging at the counterfeit Chichen Itza ruins
but the nipple bit at Rachel Ward's Cozumel hideaway.  Propped against
Bridges' chest, the gaunt, masochistic Ward flicks her fingers across
his nipples and instead of being aroused, he lays on some pro-football
gibberish, totally oblivious to his own erogenous zones.  (Some okay
touristy shots of Cozumel, the real Chichen Itza, a spectacular one or
two of Tulum, one of the most breathtaking spots in the Yucatan
peninsula, and an hysterical but hysterically good theme "Take A Look
At Me Now" by Phil Collins.)  In THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS, Bridges
didn't get the acclaim that his co-star Michelle Pfeiffer did but in
his blurry-eyed, greasy-haired seediness, he was its sick-soul center,
something like a Bukowski boozer on reduced intake maintenance, though
not quite the "cold razor-blade" Pfeiffer accuses him of being because,
after all, a cold blade wouldn't have insisted on his dog staying in a
swanky hotel room.  (Animal lovers surrendered to him no matter the
misgivings of his character once they saw Eddie the dog on couches,
beds and on that hotel ballroom stage, laying at the piano.) Before the
chance to show his magnum force in FEARLESS, Bridges came within
reasonable striking distance in Terry Gilliam's "The Fisher King,"
which is rather like the antithesis of his Max.  As a wrecked boozer
D.J. whose favorite pastime was pouncing on yuppies for advocating
"yuppie inbreeding" and for negotiating sex as "love moments," Bridges
got robbed of a full due because his character's transition happened
off screen, his drunk moments were fairly weak, and though he got
sturdier as the movie plodded along, most of our attention went to
Mercedes Ruehl, who, tramped to the max in red lipstick, red
fingernails, red bra and slip and off-the-shoulder blouse and dangling
"fuck me" earrings, never stopped acting, reacting, gesturing.  (When
the camera captured cigarette smoke blowing from her nostrils, she's a
magnificent retrograde dragon with that old time religion--a heart of
softened gold.)  She also blew Bridges away, though perhaps he let her.
But there's a connection between THE FISHER KING and FEARLESS.  In
the former, Bridges is one of the "janitors of God," called upon to
clean up the mess he's made of things, and to help clean up the mess of
his new best friend Williams.  The latter has him as one of the angels
of heroism, almost rapturously saving others and, finally, having to
save himself.</P>
<P>     If Bridges' dive into temporary decay and manginess in THE FISHER
KING doesn't altogether grab us because we're fixated on Ruehl,
Williams and, in her best screen performance to date, Amanda Plummer,
he certainly puts sleazer Mickey Rourke on notice in AMERICAN HEART.
Looking like too many bums walking the streets here in Houston (or the
cons who appear via satellite on Geraldo), in long hair pulled back in
a ponytail and unsightly mustache, with cigarette smoke clouding a
hardened-by-prison-life face, Bridges is one constant amazement: is
there any other American actor right now who can so physically give
himself over to scroungy characters and still keep us watching?  (Rourke
so immerses himself, as he does in BARFLY, that he becomes repulsive,
an audience turnoff.)  Unfortunately, as directed by Martin Bell and
written by Peter Silverman, AMERICAN HEART is overly depressing and,
sadly, boring: it's like a Bukowski story told from a
fifteen-year-old's point of view.  What we come away with is that crime
never pays--for the lower class.</P>
<P>     One of the crash survivors in FEARLESS, Rosie Perez, who's
somewhat like a dwarf Lena Olin, takes no back seat for acting honors;
she's prodigious in her mother's pain and guilt in believing she's
responsible for the death of her two-year-old Bubble, who was thrown
out of her protective arms when the plane impacted.  And when Bridges
forces her into recognizing that she's not at fault, you come close to
believing that the red tool box she holds in her arms is her baby; she
pulls from us primal instincts about our children in ways we've rarely,
perhaps never felt before from movies.  And though Weir gives her a
first scene of closure, setting to rest her agony and her appreciation
for all that Bridges has done for her, he gives her a second one that
makes it less of a neat sum-up; we can see in her eyes a whole litany
of regrets.  There are two scenes that don't quite satisfy.  When Perez
enters group therapy, her pent up anger is released, and while it's
logical,  she reaches such levels of piercing shrill that you can't
help but question why Weir didn't ask that she reduce the octaval tones
a bit.  The other is more a technical error:  Perez goes to see Bridges
in the hospital and she gives him a box of Whitman's Sampler.  Only
there's no plastic wrapping on the box.  Did the cast munch on the
goodies between takes?</P>
<P>     Playing Bridges' wife is the beautiful, crooked tooth Isabella
Rossellini.  Watching her here, or in one of my favorite movies
COUSINS, we're aware of a spiritual linkage between her and her
mother:we could swear that Ingrid is with us again, her presence so
strong and supportive.  It's too early to tell if Rossellini will be as
good an actress, but right now, she bests Ingrid in being natural,
at-home, without the little actressey tricks to fall back on, which
have sometimes marred Ingrid's performances.  With Bergman, there was
frequently an unwillingness to be exposed; she hid behind an aura of
cool stateliness that she actually fought against but often lost to.
Rossellini, maybe because she has her mother as object lesson, perhaps
because she's been a sought-after model, is the reverse:  she's artless
as vulnerability, which is what makes her so right and glowingly alive
in COUSINS; when Ted Danson, in his best screen role thus far, risks
all and asks her to dance at his father's wedding, the rush of love and
warmth is limitless.  The lack of self-centeredness helped her
enormously in BLUE VELVET, about which she was the only thing I found
worth watching.  (I know this will pique the Lynch fans, who can't seem
to get enough of his gory silliness.)  Here in FEARLESS, as a dance
instructor, she shows a maturity--and a thick neck--not seen
previously, and though she's been straight-forward about martial
problems (as with William Peterson in COUSINS), she hasn't before
played the troubled wife as a 911-er.  And she doesn't play the wife as
the Madonna of our dreams; her patience has its limits.</P>
<P>     Peter Weir may be the most talented director of the middle class's
contretemps and vicissitudes, showing us our own foibles, how we lock
ourselves into situations that we really deep down inside know are
hopeless or wrongheaded, no matter how meritorious the intent.  Those
who worship the director above all else might call Weir's mc
introspections his "auteur": the waste of young lives being needlessly
sacrificed in GALLIPOLI; Mel Gibson's reckless Australian journalist
in THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY barely escaping from the slaughter
as he runs to the last plane jetting out of an Indonesia dissolving
into chaos after years of corruption and apathy; Harrison Ford in THE
MOSQUITO COAST as the bespectacled, immersed in deglamorization Allie
Fox, novelist Paul Theroux's slowly-turning-mad adventurer-inventor
who, with his family, departs an America he believes will be destroyed
in an apocalyptic war and settles in a Central American country.
(Ford's a Robinson Crusoe with a "Lord of the Flies" cap on; he
pioneers his new world ingeniously, but the encroachment of
self-fulfilling doom, generated by his own paranoia, is always
festering within him.  That it's a fable is, I think, one of the
reasons Ford succeeds here: his legendary-like movie heroes give him
credence; he's been out of the real world for so long that it seems
natural for him to go mad.  It's not a pleasant character, and by the
end, knowing that he has destroyed himself and has come close to
destroying his family, he's thoroughly dislikable.  This is, of course,
why the public rejected the movie--it didn't want to see a hero
self-destruct.)  And there's the gooey WITNESS, filled with such
heavenly-blessed family values that to fault it might suggest to some
that I'm against family, against "goodness."  Weir dismisses the very
realities he uses to set the plot in motion--a young Amish boy
witnesses a murder and can identify the murderer--and we're never
allowed to see how what the boy witnessed affects him.  The real
witnessing is Harrison Ford's in how the Amish live so admirably their
humble lives--and how he's affected by it.  But the goodness in the
family life fails to reward the audience with what it wanted most: Ford
carrying off that Amish amazon (Kelly McGillis) at the end.
Intractable upper middle class values get the Weir once-over in DEAD
POETS SOCIETY which is rather like a catalyst to action against the
constrictions of humdrum education, and while it's not a mistake to put
a vibrant Robin Williams at the center, it is, I think, a mistake on
Weir's part to allow Williams his impromptu standup routines.  Harming
the movie even more is the destiny of one of the pupils; his fate is de
rigueur.</P>
<P>     The lack of box office for FEARLESS, considering its subject
matter and that its visual dinginess and claustrophobia intensify what
is a vivisection of pain, seems predictably bad movienomics--this is,
after all, a February or March kind of picture, when most of us are
safely away from airplanes.  But I'm fully prepared to defend Jeff
Bridges' performance as the most unfairly neglected in the 1993 awards
from critics' associations.  Nothing I've seen throughout that year
compares to what he does here, and that includes Hopkins in that
megabore THE REMAINS OF THE DAY.  And politics, not acting, won Tom
Hanks his awards.  One certainty:  FEARLESS won't show up as any
in-flight entertainment.</P>
