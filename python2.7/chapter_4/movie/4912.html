<PRE>                                 12 MONKEYS
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        12 MONKEYS is the latest from bizarre science-fiction 
director Terry Gilliam (BRAZIL), a thoroughly interesting time-travel 
epic starring Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt... So where are the other ten 
monkeys? Just a joke, you guys. Pitt has finally earned my respect in 
12 MONKEYS as the psychotic millionaire's son whom Willis comes 
from the future to stop (an Oscar-nominated performance, by the way). 
Life in Willis' time is confined to the underground, a deadly virus 
lurking above the surface. He is sent back to 1990 to get a sample of 
the stuff so the doctors of the future can immunize themselves and see 
the light of day again.</P>
<P>        His mission backfires when he is committed to a mental 
hospital. No one believes his story about the imminent destruction of 
humanity by the terrorist group Army of the Twelve Monkeys, 
particularly not psychiatrist Madeline Stowe (go figure). After a couple 
days associating with the nuts (including Pitt) and trying to escape 
from the hospital, Willis disappears from his cell, to everyone's 
surprise and dismay. He winds up in the year 1955, where his mom 
falls in love with him and Christopher Lloyd can't fix the DeLorean... 
Sorry, I always use that joke when reviewing time travel movies.</P>
<P>        Willis actually ends up in his time, with the society leaders 
who sent him cursing him for a failed mission. He convinces them to 
give him one more chance and they send him to the year 1996, six 
years after he disappeared from the mental hospital. He kidnaps 
Stowe, who remembers his mysterious escape from the hospital six 
years ago, but she refuses to help him, still thinking he's nuts and of 
course you can't blame her for that. Predictably, she slowly comes to 
realize he actually has been sent from the future, about the same time 
Willis becomes convinced he's insane after all.</P>
<P>        This all escalates to the airport climax, with more twists than 
one of those donuts with all the twists (you know what I'm talking 
about here). The movie's ending leaves a lot of details open-ended, as 
the paradox of time travel dictates, while also leaving other details 
open to interpretation. The whole movie, though, is fast-paced and 
exciting, and possibly a little confusing for the less abstract thinkers in 
the audience. Gilliam adds his uniquely original directorial style to 
this uniquely original story to make a uniquely original movie for 
thriller and science-fiction movie lovers alike.</P>
