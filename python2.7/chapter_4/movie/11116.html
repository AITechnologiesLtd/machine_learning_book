<P>        "Wolf" is the first film I can recommend unconditionally that's been
released this summer.  It's got a great script with a fair number of memorable
lines.  The performances are uniformly strong, and Michelle in paticular plays
one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen her do.  Jack is as 
nasty as he needs to be, but the rest of the time he delivers a subtle, con-
trolled performance.  Mike Nichols directs the whole thing with his usual re-
straint, but with more visual flair than you might expect.  By playing the fant
sy element down and working with well-written characters and situations, he
manages to ground what would ordinarily be an out-and-out ridiculous plot.
The plot turns are set up well in advance, but I didn't see them coming (ex-
cept for perhaps the last one, and it didn't bother me).  Morricone's score is
moody and supports the film well in general, even if it isn't totally compel-
ling on its own.  This isn't a paticularly scary film (it slow pacing and short
climax may irritate some), but it is compelling and suspenseful.  Rick Baker's
makeup is well-executed, though it may be disappointing to those expecting
another "American Werewolf" or "Howling" high-water mark in effects work.  Low
key is definately the idea here, which I think works just fine considering 
what was needed.  Kudos go also to James Spader who may take the "Slimy Shit 
of the Millenium" award away from the Company fella in "Aliens".  The blood
level is fairly high, but not anything that anyone who's seen "Bram Stoker's
Dracula" can't handle.  The sex scenes are quite low key as is the rest of the
film.  It definately makes you sit up and notice when the action gets going.
An extra bonus is the trailer for the Coppola/Branaugh "Frankenstein"...similar
to "Dracula" in its visual voluptuousness and sexual emphasis.  Not quite as
capital-G Gothic or as capital-D Designed, though.  Still, very cool looking
and shows promise.  Can't wait for November 4th...or was it September?  I for-
get.  Anyway, check out "Wolf".  As the saying goes, you'll be glad you did.</P>
