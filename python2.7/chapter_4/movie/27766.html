<PRE>BROKEN ARROW</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: John Woo
Written by: Graham Yost</PRE>
<P>Vic Deakins (John Travolta) and Riley Hale (Christian Slater) are two top 
notch air force pilots on a training mission involving a stealth bomber and 
two nuclear warheads. While things are going fine at first, Deakins suddenly 
tries to kill Hale and take over the plane. Gunfire ensues and the plane 
crashes, but not before both pilots manage to eject. Hale lands safely and 
meets up with park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis), whom he 
convinces to help him. Meanwhile, Deakins is in league with a group of 
terrorists who want to steal the two nuclear warheads and get millions from 
the government. The president, realizing there's a broken arrow situation 
(that's when we lose nuclear warheads. Apparently it happens quite often), 
sends in a recovery team. What he doesn't realize is how carefully Deakins 
has planned for everything the government is going to throw at them. Now the 
only people who have any chance at stopping Deakins are Hale and Carmichael, 
and they're running out of time.</P>
<P>Here's a little tip to all future writers out there: when your script is a 
blatant attempt to cash in on recent genre success (in this case the success 
of films like Speed), don't include words like "broken" in your title. So, 
does Broken Arrow live up to its title? Is the film truly broken? Not 
exactly, but it's certainly in need of some repairs. All the requisite 
elements for a classic '90s action flick are here (I didn't think it was 
possible for the words classic and '90s to appear in the same sentence). 
We've got betrayal by a friend, a love interest that begins with mistrust, a 
few shoot-outs, at least one really big explosion, and a villain who acts 
obscenely calm no matter what might be happening around him. So, with all 
the necessary elements present, what could go wrong? Well, in some ways, 
having all the necessary elements is exactly what goes wrong. There are 
simply zero surprises in this movie (aside from the appearance of Howie 
Long, but that doesn't exactly count), and it's in desperate need of a few. 
Is the film still enjoyable? Yes, but in the same way sitting down in your 
favorite beat up, knocked around, but broken in easy chair is enjoyable. You 
know it's bad, you know it should be replaced, but you just can't help 
yourself.</P>
<P>Obviously the acting in a movie like Broken Arrow isn't of supreme 
importance, but I feel it's worth mentioning anyway. John Travolta leads the 
way with his usual over-the-top performance, though thankfully this time 
around it suits the character. I'm sure this man can act in another way, he 
showed he could in Pulp Fiction, but he seems to feel obligated to act 
maniacal in everything else. It works here, but it won't always, and it's 
going to get on peoples' nerves in time. I've always found Christian Slater 
to be a rather underrated actor. People seem to label him as a Jack 
Nicholson imitator and not give him a second thought. I'm not saying the man 
is a great actor, but he's certainly a good one, and he occasionally borders 
on greatness (True Romance for example). This isn't one of those times, but 
Slater does what he can with some wooden dialogue and a cliched character, 
and manages to keep us entertained. Samantha Mathis (Pump up the Volume) 
does a spectacular Sandra Bullock impersonation in the movie, but that's not 
exactly a good thing. As I said, Howie Long shows up, but don't worry, he 
has about five lines so he's tolerable. Delroy Lindo (Gone in Sixty Seconds) 
and Frank Whaley (Swimming With Sharks) both make brief appearances, but 
Whaley is given one of the film's really good lines after being told what a 
"Broken Arrow" is. He gets a shocked look on his face before muttering "I'm 
not sure what's scarier, that we have one right now, or that it happens so 
often you actually have a term for it."</P>
<P>Perhaps what I find most disappointing about Broken Arrow is Graham Yost's 
(who also wrote Speed... what a surprise, eh?) script. It's not that it's a 
bad script, it's simply that it takes no chances. Yost is obviously content 
to write something very similar to Speed and let John Woo work his magic 
(which he does, but more on that later). Not only are there no surprises, 
there's very little excitement this time around. The script places the 
actors in predictable situations, and they respond to these situations 
exactly as we expect them to. The actors all seem to realize they're in a 
film that's little more than a rehash, and they act accordingly. Is it 
possible I'm expecting too much out of the script that it throw some 
surprises at us? I suppose it could be, but I don't think so. Alright, 
script aside, are there any other flaws to the film? Well, the suspension of 
disbelief factor runs just a little bit high. We're expected to believe 
things like a nuclear blast underground would have zero effect on the 
surface, that a nuke is so light it can be dragged up the stairs by one 
person, and of course that the military doesn't monitor those who deal with 
nuclear weapons all that closely. Now, I can look past those things, but I 
can suspend my disbelief pretty well. Your average movie goer might have a 
harder time with it.</P>
<P>What makes the film work despite these things working against it is John 
Woo's ability to direct an action scene like few men can. I'm not saying his 
direction is flawless, mind you. The film's pacing is a little off, jumping 
frantically from scene to scene at times before suddenly slowing down for no 
apparent reason. Still, that's easy to forgive when you see what Woo can do 
with a scene as simple as a shoot-out in a mine. It's really quite 
mesmerizing, watching men jump from cover to cover, blasting everything in 
sight and switching from slow motion to real-time movement every now and 
then. There's something poetic about these scenes, and I fear they can't be 
described adequately. Also working in the film's favor is an enjoyable score 
by Hans Zimmer (Gladiator), and particularly a quaint little bit he wrote 
which plays every time Travolta appears on screen. Broken Arrow does run a 
bit too long at 108 minutes, which could easily have been chopped down to 
90. I'd recommend the film to those of you who love Woo's style of 
direction, Travolta's style of overacting, and Graham Yost's style of 
re-using the same script over and over again. I give the movie three and a 
half out of five stars.</P>
