<P>THE SILENCE OF THE SEA (director: Jean-Pierre Melville; cast: Howard
Vernon (Werner Von Ebrennac), Nicole Stéphane(The Niece ), Jean-Marie
Robain (The Uncle), Ami Aaröe (Werner's fiancee), 1947-Fr.)</P>
<P>A German Lieutenant, Werner Von Ebrennac (Vernon), is stationed in
France during the time of the occupation and moves into the rural
village cottage of an elderly, scholarly gentleman (Robain) and his
niece (Nicole).They take a vow of silence toward the German intruder,
sitting by their fireplace night after night when the officer returns
from his duty, never saying a word to him during his entire stay with
them. The officer never shows his animosity towards them as he uses
their silence to fill in details about what he is thinking: his love of
music, his life story, the girl he almost married, his love of French
culture, and his belief that this occupation will be good for both
countries, he says it will be like a marriage. His political naivety (in
civilian life he is a musical composer) and underestimation of the evil
government he represents, comes to light for him when he meets with
close friends who are in Paris to negotiate the political arrangement
between the two countries. It is then that he is shocked into realizing
the barbaric designs that are intended by them to reduce the world to be
submissive to a dominant Germany, the aim being to rip the soul out of
each country it conquers. His more benevolent ideas, for the mutual
countries to co-exist, are sneered at by his cultured German friends.
Fed up with this, but resigned to the fact that there is nothing he
could do about it, he volunteers for duty in the war zone of WW11.</P>
<P>The old man has left a copy of one Anatole France's books out for him to
see just as he leaves for the front, the quote reads, "That it is a
soldier's duty to disobey a criminal order given by his superiors." The
niece also yields a muffled "adieux", that he might have heard, but does
not respond to. That he leaves just at a time when they are questioning
if their silence was the right thing to do, adds an argument that
Melville might have been particularly interested in, by showing that all
parties have to get rid of their hatreds before they can communicate
with each other to extract any positive results.</P>
<P>This film was made so close to the end of the war, that it seems to be
trying desperately and as intelligently as it can, to understand what
went through the minds of those who participated in those infamous days
of occupation and how it is possible to begin a healing process between
such sworn enemies. In any case, it captured the climate in France
during the war and the humiliations the French went through in the hands
of their captors.</P>
<P>The Nazi holocaust and its diabolical war machine, were not broached in
any of the officer's soliloquys with the couple held hostage in their
own home. But how would he have treated them if they were Jews, remains
unanswered. It is through this officer, that Melville symbolized the
best of the German's intentions, someone whom there is some hope for if
the world is to have a saner future.</P>
<P>What happened in that occupied house was a one way dialogue, with
silence winning and losing. Winning in the sense, that there was no
other way to conduct oneself with dignity when your enemy takes over
your homeland, and the dignity of those who formed the Resistance
Movement is undoubtedly honored by Melville for the rightful stand they
took. Melville was in real-life a member of that Movement. Losing,
because silence means you can't voice what is in your heart and mind,
and by remaining silent it can be interpreted as a tacit acceptance of
defeat and an unwillingness to call out for what is right and wrong.</P>
<P>In the end, it was the German officer who remained silent by going off
to fight a futile war, a war which made no human sense from his side of
the fence.Which means, when the chips are down, he is still a believer
in the motto: My country, right or wrong.</P>
<P>Melville's film is stimulating and perplexing, yet it is simple in tone
and in human spirit. It gave me chills to watch how natural it all
seemed; firstly, because the protaganists were so real and the situation
was so menacing; and, secondly, everything happens in such a matter of
fact way, enhanced by being shot in the harsh and convincing tones of
black-and-white, giving the film a certain disquiet with the sea in the
background that is unsettling to behold.</P>
