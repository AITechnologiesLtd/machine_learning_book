Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</P>
<P>     Many films have traced the arc of a romantic relationship in which
the two principals, despite initial appearances that they are a perfect
pair, are destined never to be happy together.  They have been sweet
(ANNIE HALL), sad (CASABLANCA), even sordid (9 1/2 WEEKS); indeed, they
have come in virtually every possible permutation.  THE DREAMLIFE OF
ANGELS is the first film I can recall which traces the arc of a platonic
friendship in the same terms.  Sparked by two superb performances in
complex roles, it's as affecting and involving as any tale in which the
doomed couple are romantic partners instead of pals.</P>
<P>     The two pals in THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS meet while working at a dress
factory in the French city of Lille.  Isa Tostin (Elodie Bouchez) is a
21-year-old itinerant stranded without a place to stay when the friend she
has coming looking for is nowhere to be found; Marie Thomas (Natacha
Gregnier) is a hard-edged woman living for free in the apartment of a
woman and her daughter severly injured in an auto accident.  Marie invites
Isa to stay with her, and the two kindred free spirits quickly become
inseparable.</P>
<P>     The dynamic between the two central characters works from the outset
only because they are so carefully, beautifully drawn by Erick Zonca and
Roger Bohbot.  The punky Isa and hair-trigger Marie click from their first
meeting, two rebels without a cent who delight in taunting bouncers at a
local nightclub or coming on to random men in a mall.  Their playful
irreverence makes for some entertaining scenes, and allows the two lead
actresses to develop a believable chemistry.  That kind of chemistry is
critical to a story about a relationship -- if Isa and Marie don't seem
like ideal best friends when they first get acquainted, the rest of THE
DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS becomes utterly irrelevant.</P>
<P>     It's just as important that the appearance of an ideal pairing proves
deceiving, and the film works just as well revealing that truth.  Where
Isa is sincerely searching for someone with whom she can connect, Marie
consistently sabotages every stable thing in her life.  Isa finds the
diary of the comatose teenager whose room she is occupying, and begins to
visit the girl in the hospital while manufacturing a dialogue with her.
Marie, meanwhile, dumps the chubby but loving Charly (Patrick Mercado) for
the callow, abusive Chris (Gregoire Colin), and refuses to put forth an
effort to land another job.  Though the psyches of the two women are
perhaps too easily distilled into a brief discussion of their respective
parentage, Bouchez and Gregnier flesh out their roles as opposite sides of
the same wounded coin.</P>
<P>     The character study of THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS is so strong that it's
easier to overlook its short-comings:  a drawn-out prologue before the two
women meet, under-developed supporting characters, and a third act which
takes an unnecessarily melodramatic turn.  Zonca's minimalist direction
never gets in the way of the performances, but it also does little to
complement them.  In fact, the story might have worked even better as a
two-character stage play.  That's not to take anything away from the
effectiveness of those characters in the film, or the skilled actresses
who bring them to life.  It's a thoroughly compelling exploration of
female bonding and un-bonding, a "chick flick" turned on its head.  The
disintegration of a friendship has rarely felt quite so tragic.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 sinking friend-ships:  8.</PRE>
