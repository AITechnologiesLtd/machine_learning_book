 Life (1999) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence</PRE>
<P> In Life, Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence play two young men wrongfully
convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.</P>
<P> After about an hour of watching this movie, you begin to realize how their
characters feel. Fortunately, for audience members there's a chance to
escape  the nearest exit.</P>
<P> This, undoubtedly, is Eddie Murphy's worst movie  and that's an
accomplishment.  Remember The Golden Child, Harlem Nights? Compared to
Life, they look like Citizen Kane.</P>
<P> Life is long, predictable, foul-mouthed and only intermittently funny. Its
100-minute running time feels like 100 years. Robert Ramsey and Matthew
Stone's script basically consist of Murphy and Lawrence referring to
everyone around them as "motherf...s" or "n ..... s."</P>
<P> You lose count how many times both those obnoxious, offensive words are
used. And if that all it takes to write a script, than any illiterate
jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie.</P>
<P> But, like Life, it will probably stink.</P>
<P>To be honest, the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked
it up. But these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and
fat jokes as well.</P>
<P> Life is as sophisticated as a belch. It's crude and stereotypical.
Years ago, movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient,
second-class people, good for being only maids and servants. For the most
part, the lot of blacks  and other racial groups  have improved.</P>
<P> But a new, more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies. In many
recent films, through actors such as Murphy and Chris Tuckers, blacks are
presented as fast-talking, conniving, scam artists or hip-hop, gun-crazy,
sex-crazed youths.</P>
<P> Both sets of caricatures are demeaning. And the fault does not rest with
the actors. They have to eat, too. It is with the people who write the
scripts, the studios who green-light the projects and the audiences who
accept these portrayals without protest.</P>
<P> Life's only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend Rick Baker
who flawlessly ages Murphy and Lawrence into 90 year olds.</P>
<P> Otherwise, Life is an embarrassment, a blot on the resumes of those
associated with it. See it at your own risk.</P>
