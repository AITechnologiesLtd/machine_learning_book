<P>I've always been oddly attracted to the dark and the beautiful, the strange
and the black, the surreal and the imagined. I've also loved the leaves of
autumn, the nights of breeze and cold when I could just curl myself up into
bed and wrap my daily reality into dreamy visions of wonder and fantasy,
while knowing full well that not one person on this planet, including
myself, truly knows why we exist. The only thing that we do know is that we
are all lucky enough to have a director like Tim Burton who also seems to
affiliate himself to the surreal and beautiful, and likes to slap his tales
of the absurd with some darkly mined humor.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Constable Ichabod Crane is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow in order
to investigate a recent rash of murders by decapitation. Basing his findings
solely on scientific factors and evidence, the detective respectfully
brushes off the townfolks' allegations of a "headless horseman", but soon
discovers much personal evidence to confirm the people's outlandish claims.
Headrollings ensue.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Beautiful. A film which draws you into its grungy world with its impeccable
style and attention to dreary detail, woos you in further with a charmingly
pure performance from an actor who is firmly solidifying his place amongst
his peer group of esteemed thespians, namely Johnny Depp, and topping the
whole gothic show up with an interesting tale of the legendary unknown,
mixed in with some timely humor and bloody carnage courtesy of the coolest
scary son-of-a-bitch of the year, put your hands together for...the headless
horseman. You know I really dug a movie when I run off and into 100-word
sentences, so grammatically wrong, but so emotionally right! This is the
ultimate Tim Burton movie. The entire presentation is a flawless visual
feast which makes you feel like you are really in this dingy town in upper
New York, when in reality, the whole film was shot on sets in London,
England.</P>
<P>I always knew Johnny Depp was a different kind of actor, but also suspected
that he might be taking his goofy roles to hide his lack of true acting
chop, but boy, did this film ever prove me wrong. Johnny chomps up his
scenes during this entire film and had me utterly convinced of his presence
in the year of 1799, engulfed in his character's arrogance on one side and
cowardice on the other. Excellent job! He made this film so much more
enjoyable for me along with the haunting score from Danny Elfman, the wildly
effective sets, the dreamlike cinematography and let's not forget, the
ultimately cool clompety-clomps of the headless horseman riding his way into
town. Brrrr...cover that neck, this bastard's pissed and he's got no head!!
I love this movie! It looks awesome, it feels awesome, it sounds awesome,
it's got Johnny Depp in top form, Ricci letting it all hang out, humor,
thrills, romance, drama, a little murder mystery tossed in, and oh yeah,
let's not forget all the bloody decapitations that you could shake a stick
at!</P>
<P>You'll be happy to know that I've also invited this film back for an annual
visit inside my DVD player every season of the pumpkin, joining its
Halloween staple brother in law, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
And someone tells me that the actual town of Sleepy Hollow is only about
two hours from where I'm stationed. Hmmmm....interesting.
Clompety-clompety-clomp.</P>
