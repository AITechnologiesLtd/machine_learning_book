<P>"A gift of God?  Can I give it back?"  It's a legitimate question that is
asked by Frankie Paige, a 23 year old hair stylist from Pittsburgh who
inexplicably develops an affliction allegedly only experienced by the
deeply religious.  The fact that she's an atheist is stumping the
religious investigators who have come to study her.  They've come because
her body is being assaulted by an invisible attacker, leaving on her the
marks of the stigmata.  "Why her?" is the question they want answered.
What does it mean?</P>
<P>STIGMATA, a new release from MGM, bears a passing resemblance to THE
EXORCIST, and is being released on the heels of THE SIXTH SENSE and STIR
OF ECHOES, two other supernatural thrillers.  Unlike its two recent
predecessors, STIGMATA focuses upon the depiction of religious phenomenon
and the response of the Roman Catholic Church in the face of such
unexplained events.  As such, it has the rare distinction of being
accurately inaccurate.</P>
<P>After receiving a rosary which belonged to a dead priest, Frankie
(Patricia Arquette, THE HI-LO COUNTRY) begins experiencing attacks from an
unseen force which causes deep wounds through her wrists and feet as well
as lacerations on her back and forehead... the same wounds experienced by
the crucified Jesus.  Such wounds are known in religious circles as
"stigmata."  Hearing of these attacks, the Vatican sends its emissary,
Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Bryne, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK) to
investigate and prove or disprove the phenomenon.</P>
<P>As Father Kiernan becomes convinced of the spiritual nature of Frankie's
experiences, other factors begin to come to light which implicate the
Roman Catholic Church and its obsessive need for secrecy and
self-preservation at any cost.  Cardinal Houseman (Jonathan Pryce,
TOMORROW NEVER DIES), a high-ranking Vatican official takes a deep
interest in the ongoing investigation and when Frankie begins to speak and
write in Aramaic, the language of Christ, he comes to America and
ominously takes personal command of the situation.</P>
<P>The acting is first rate.  Patricia Arquette is amazing as a young night
clubbing party girl who has no way to understand or comprehend what is
happening to her.  She maintains her believability even in the midst of
unbelievable occurrences.  Gabriel Byrne is appropriately cast as a
scientist turned priest whose faith is tested and even potentially
strengthened by this experience.  Jonathan Pryce is downright
Machiavellian as the evil hearted Cardinal Houseman.</P>
<P>While the movie is both visually stunning and intense in nature, the
story it tells fails to adequately explain the various questions that it
brings to mind.  The concluding scenes, which unsatisfactorily resolves
the storyline, are disappointing on two levels:  From a narrative
perspective, the ending is implausible and only serves to raise a slew of
other questions.  From a spiritual perspective, it is misleading and in
many ways completely inaccurate.  It is impossible to go into more details
without revealing the ending but the scripture references I list at the
beginning of the review will allude to some of the untruths I find
objectionable.</P>
<P>The "gift of God" comment (which comes midway through the film) was a
lame attempt to explain why the stigmata is only experienced by the deeply
religious.  To believe that God would inflict such pain and suffering upon
anyone is beyond blasphemous.  It would contradict everything that God
reveals about Himself through His Word.</P>
<P>Jesus Christ endured the pain of the cross and the physical torture which
led to it (which was far worse than anything seen in the film... The
scriptures state that his body was ravaged so badly he was
unrecognizable.)  He did so for a specific purpose, the redemption and
salvation of all mankind.  To think that there is a godly reason for
anyone else to be subjected to that level of human suffering is to demean
and bring to naught his accomplishments.</P>
<P>Because of his accomplishments, we are able to claim physical wholeness,
manifest power from on high, understand spiritual matters, and lead a life
that is more than abundant.  That is the true gift of God in all its
beauty and divine glory.  Anything else, especially anything so obviously
devilish, is counterfeit.</P>
