<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>It takes too much of a suspension of reality to believe in this
outlandish plot: the devil is in our heads and was placed there by
ordinary contact with others (it spreads like germs do), even though it
is played with zeal and candor by Denzel Washington, who is the
squeaky-clean super Detective John Hobbes. He works with his partner of
12+ years, Jonesy (John Goodman), on homicides. The occult thriller
takes too long to develop (over two hours) and when it finally gets to
where it is going, it ends up nowhere.</P>
<P>The film is basically a horror film teaser, trying to say something
about Azazel that it really can't say without sounding ridiculous. It
uses the Rolling Stones' 1960s theme song of "Time Is on My Side" to
make its own theme become indelibly linked with all the serial murders
and tries to give the film a noir feel to it, with a constant voiceover
by Denzel trying to explain how incredible it is that his life is
falling apart. There is also heavy use of fuzzy camera images by the
cinematographer to indicate that the devil was being photographed from
his point of view. These shots of the devil's viewpoint were overworked
into the script to the point of overkill. The film worked only on a
superficial level, as light entertainment and should be given credit
for, at least, attempting to have a literate script. It is basically an
escapist film, that failed to build-up tension as the story went on.
Indeed, by the film's last scene, the story waned in interest, proving
mosly that time wasn't on its side.</P>
<P>The film opens with a flashback and voiceover by Detective Hobbes: "I
want to tell you about the time I almost died,'' and then he tells of
the events that led up to the dire predicament he now is in, as we see
him crawling on his hands and knees in an isolated snowy area in the
woods. It then cuts to Death Row, where a killer, Reese (Elias Koteas),
is about to go to the gas chamber. His death is being filmed by the
ACLU. Hobbes is among the witnesses to the execution and sees the killer
in his cell before he is brought out to the gas chamber, where the
killer sings to him "Time Is on My Side," mumbles some mumbo jumbo,
grabs the detective's hand, and tells him a riddle: Where is there a
space between Lyons and Spakowsky? The camera shot of his death in the
gas chamber, shows his physical death, but there is a point-of-view
aerial shot that reveals that the evil spirit is loose. In seconds, the
spirit climbs into the body of its next victim and takes him over.
Thusly, we have all been duly prepped for the supernatural part of the
story to follow.</P>
<P>Hobbes then returns to the police station in Philadelphia, which he
loves so much. We see him smugly on TV as the hero cop who made the
pinch of the executed killer; we see him happily at home with his
brother and nephew; and, then we see him interact good-naturedly with
his co-workers-- his boss, the reticent Lieutenant Stanton (Donald
Sutherland), his good-friend Jonesy, and a sleazy cop, Lou (Gandolfini),
who tries to ride him for being a saint. These scenes have a good feel
to them as they are grounded in reality and capture the feel of the
detective world Hobbes inhabits.</P>
<P>Soon he begins receiving late-night hang-up phone calls, just like Reese
used to do to him. Then a copycat killer starts working on apparently
random victims, as the police can find no motives for the crime. A
corpse is found in a bathtub while the killer, strangely, stayed for
breakfast being in no rush to leave the apartment. Hobbes notices that
the dead man in the bathtub is the same man who brushed past him last
night, noticeably trying to draw his attention. The linguist brought
into the case, says that the words on the videotape of Reese, were
spoken in ancient Aramaic, a language not spoken in the last two
thousand years.</P>
<P>Through the inadvertent help of Lou, Hobbes discovers the answer to
Reese's riddle is on the wall plaque for hero cops in the stationhouse,
where the missing name between Lyons and Spakowsky is of a former hero
policeman, who was later accused of being a serial killer and committed
suicide. Hobbes researches the cop's name on an internet search engine
and then contacts his daughter, Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz), to ask
her why her father went to his country house to commit suicide. When
Hobbes visits the country house, he finds books on the occult and the
word Azazel written on the dusty wall.</P>
<P>Ms. Milano, who conveniently happens to be a professor of theology,
tells Hobbes, "If you value your life, if there's even one human being
you care about, walk away from this case." But it is too late for the
detective, as his fingerprints are found in two serial murders uncovered
and he is being falsely accused of these crimes just like her father
was.</P>
<P>By this time, the story lost its base of reality. The evil spirit that
couldn't die moves from person to person, and there is a chase scene in
a crowd where the possessed pursuer could be anyone, which was exciting
to watch, but added little to the meaning of the story.</P>
<P>Denzel's noir-like voiceover seemed artificial, an imitation of how a
real noir film operates. He was also not convincing as a noir
protagonist, he seemed more like a cop who was in a horror movie but
might have been better off being in a straight movie about a cop being
framed by corrupt cops. The premise of the occult tale was too silly to
take seriously. But the film plodded on, getting more ridiculous by the
minute, until it ended on a note of surprise, in the twisted manner one
expected a film like this to end on.</P>
