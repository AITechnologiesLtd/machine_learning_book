<PRE>                              THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
                        Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: ***1/2 (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>The imposing New England homestead that serves as center stage in "The Myth
of Fingerprints" also serves as an obvious yet apt metaphor for the
dysfunctional American family that was raised there.  In long shot it's
strikingly handsome, but up close its cracked and peeling paint indicate
the need for repair.</P>
<P>In a wintry November setting writer/director Bart Freundlich weaves his
discriminating, multi-layered story of a family reunion that's wrought with
angst and grief.  On the surface, "The Myth of Fingerprints" might seem
like any old home-for-the-holidays scenery chawfest in which the central
characters get toasted and roasted along with the bird.  But Freundlich's
take is a little different.</P>
<P>Why do people subject themselves to such familial hostility each and every
year?  What causes grown children to revert to infantile behavior in the
presence of their parents?  And do you have to have had a healthy family
life in order to have a successful relationship?</P>
<P>While "The Myth of Fingerprints" is bigger on questions than it is on
answers, it challenges its audience to think.</P>
<P>Bigger, perhaps, and more intimidating than the ancestral centerpiece is
Hal (Roy Scheider), the impassionate, detached patriarch.  He's a little
odd and visibly wrestling some deep, dark secret.  It's Thanksgiving, and
Hal and his faithful, nurturing wife Lena (the dependable Blythe Danner)
are welcoming their four adult children home after a three year absence.
Eldest daughter Mia (Julianne Moore, who's a hot property these days) and
son Jake (Michael Vartan) are bringing along their significant others,
causing Dad to comment "There's more of them than I remember."</P>
<P>The film is almost perfectly cast with performances to match.  Noah Wyle,
who brings the discontent son Warren to life, is a quivering mass of
brooding sensitivity.  Laurel Holloman plays the pesky younger daughter
Leigh to coquettish perfection.  Moore, too, is especially good.  Mia's
bitterness almost single-handedly makes the tensions run high.</P>
<P>First-timer Freundlich resists the easy temptation to bring these tensions
to an explosive, emotional head and instead develops the characters slowly
and with subtlety, drawing us in, exploring their motivations, their
weaknesses, and their desires.</P>
<P>But there is laughter among the tears; the director balances the drama with
humor and pointed observations, lightening the mood with a flurry of eager
bedfellows.  In addition, the film has a palpable sensuality; you can feel
the cold of the New England air and smell the antiquities, the wood smoke,
the oil on a gun stock.  "The Myth of Fingerprints" shows us how families
interact, collide, kiss, and maybe even make up.  It's about lovers and
friends, and how interchangeable these sometimes are.  And how mistakes can
turn a family inside out.</P>
<P>Family gatherings are often fraught with stresses and anxieties and "The
Myth of Fingerprints" skillfully demonstrates that you don't have to use
bombast--just high-caliber acting and introspective writing--to make these
things interesting.</P>
