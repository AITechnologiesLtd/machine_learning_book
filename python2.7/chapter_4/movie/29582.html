<P>First things first: David Lynch's latest film has absolutely nothing to do
with that stupid 1996 Chinatown rip-off called Mulholland Falls (you should
always be wary of a film that's selling point is how realistic its hats
are). Mulholland Drive was something Lynch made years ago as a two-hour
pilot for ABC, but it was ultimately never picked up by the network...and
with good reason.  This shit would have terrified a television audience.
The notion of Fred and Mary Lou Cornpone from Peoria watching Who Wants to
be a Millionaire lead in to this must have been too much for the network
brass to handle.</P>
<P>Luckily, a French company gave Lynch (The Straight Story) $7 million to turn
the unresolved pilot into a movie.  The writer/director re-shot some
existing scenes and added new material to Drive, which ultimately netted him
the Best Director Award at this year's Cannes Film Festival.  As you would
expect from a movie that made the unusual transformation from television
drama to feature-length picture, Drive becomes garbled and unintelligible
over its last 30 minutes, which, presumably, is what Lynch added to the
film's original format.  If you can understand the last half-hour, you
should either be heading up your own brain trust or immediately locked up.</P>
<P>While Lynch might be best known for his surreal takes on small-town America,
Drive seems like his spooky tribute to Hollywood.  The film's opening
credits play over what could be a Gap khakis commercial, but it only takes
about three minutes to get seriously creepy.  The action begins with a vampy
looker (Laura Harring) riding in the back of a limousine.  The car stops on
Mulholland Drive and the driver orders the woman out at gunpoint, but before
she can react, the parked limo is creamed by an oncoming car.  The woman,
who appears to be the only survivor of the crash, stumbles away and passes
out, Margot Kidder-style, on somebody's lawn.</P>
<P>The lawn in question belongs to an elderly couple who are on their way out
of L.A. and have left their gorgeous apartment (which looks a lot like
Melrose Place) to their equally gorgeous niece Betty (Naomi Watts), who is
naive, chipper and eager enough to have been teleported from the '50s.  She
wants to be an actress and has just arrived in town from Deep River, Ontario
(which drew a huge laugh from the audience at the Toronto International Film
Festival), presumably making the journey on a turnip truck.  The crash
survivor, now suffering from amnesia, is discovered by Betty, and like any
native of Deep River, she bends over backward to help the stranger, who says
her name is Rita (as in Hayworth) after seeing a movie poster hanging in the
apartment.  The mystery deepens when Rita's purse is opened to reveal stack
upon stack of large bills.</P>
<P>The third leg of Drive's story is about a young, hotshot movie director
named Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux, American Psycho), who is appalled to
learn the producers of his latest film want to replace his lead actress.  In
a very surreal business meeting, his producers show him a picture of the
woman they'd like him to cast, repeating the phrase "This is the girl" over
and over again.  If that wasn't odd enough, Adam heads home and finds his
wife getting reamed by Billy Ray Cyrus, who then proceeds to beat the
stuffing out of him.  Former tap dance legend Ann Miller even makes an
appearance as Betty's nosy landlord.</P>
<P>The tales of Betty, Rita (couldn't Lynch have just named her Veronica?) and
Adam intertwine and are added to other set pieces (some involving curtained
rooms with a certain midget Lynch fans have grown to love) that barely make
sense but are so damn entertaining and visually pleasing that it hardly
matters.  Angelo Badalamenti's score is typically strong and simultaneously
eerie, while cinematographer Peter Deming, who also does a great job on the
upcoming From Hell, makes everything shadowy and claustrophobic.</P>
<P>In Story, you kept waiting for something dark and weird to happen, but it
never did (which was part of the film's genius).  That dark, weird stuff
happens here, and often.  Drive is likely to divide critics and fans as
decisively as last year's Cannes champ Dancer in the Dark did.  Of the three
relatively unknown stars, Watts steals the show and could be the new Meg
Ryan (because I think we're all a little tired of the old one, aren't we?).
And she's involved in some of the hottest non-porn girl-on-girl action you'
re likely ever to see in a mainstream film.</P>
<P>2:26 - R for violence, language and some strong sexuality</P>
