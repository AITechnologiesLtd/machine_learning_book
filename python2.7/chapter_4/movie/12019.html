<PRE>THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI (1919)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Robert Wiene
Writers: Han Jonowitz and Carl Mayer
Starring: Werner Krauﬂ, Conrad Veidt, Friedrich Feher, Lil Dagover, Hans
Heinrich von Twardowski, Rudolf Klein-Rogge, Rudolf Lettinger</P>
<P>It's amazing how older films like "Metropolis" hold up today: even when we
can do pretty much anything with special effects, films like this still
astound us, not just because it's incredible that the filmmakers were able
to do such wild things, but also because they just look amazing.  What
would otherwise be interpreted as "inefficient" by today's standards is
labeled as "moody" and "incredible."</P>
<P>"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is a simple, subversive film made all the
more interesting because of its style, some of which is due to exactly how
old it is.  For instance, the sets are incredible as they are, but are
given an extra eery tone precisely because of the lack of technology
available at the time of its creation.  Any film which would use lighting
this bright in some cases would be deemed awful and its crew incompetent. 
But here, it creates a great sense of atmosphere which is unavailable
today.</P>
<P>"Dr. Caligari" is also a pretty amazing film, not just be a technological
standpoint, but also becaues the story is so fascinating and creepy.  The
story deals with a crotchity white-haired old man, Dr. Caligari (Werner
Krauﬂ), who gets a booth at a traveling fair to show of a zombie-like
somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt), who has the ability to tell the
future to any paying customer.  But at night, Caligari sends Cesare out to
kill innocent people.</P>
<P>One of the victims is a friend of a student named Francis (Friedrich
Feher), who becomes obsessed with tracking down the friend's murderer. 
When his fiance (Lil Dagover) is almost killed by Cesare also, the evidence
leads him to Caligari, who, as it turns out, is the director of the local
Insane Asylum.  From here, there's the fantastic finale, and big twist
which concludes this film (which is only about an hour long).</P>
<P>This film, along with such films as Georges Melies' "Trip to the Moon,"
Fritz Lang's "Metropolis," and King Vidor's "The Crowd," is heralded as one
of the best examples of the silent era, and perhaps the best example of
German Expressionism at its most expressionistic.  The sets are some of the
best ever put in a film: every building is designed so it looks crooked,
and everything is grand and wild.  The ligthing, which would be off today,
puts every shadow in the correct place, giving the film an intense
atmosphere.  The costumes and make-up, particularly that of Cesare's, are
out of a nightmare, sticking in the mind long afterwards.  Some images are
just incredible, such as the look of Dr. Caligari, who is one of the
scariest characters ever put on celluloid.</P>
<P>Apart from being visually stunning and ultimately engrossing, the film is a
protest against the government's attempts to control the population like
zombies.  Cesare is the representation of society in the film, blindly
following the mad Caligari, who's thoughts and orders are totally devoid of
contemplation or reasoning.  It's a film that is so angry that it's
difficult to believe that it was ever given the get-go in the beginning.</P>
<P>But, as the story goes, the government interfered with Robert Wiene, the
director, who was then forced to tack on a beginning and ending to his film
where the entire message was supposed to be reversed.  In it, the entire
story, which works as angry, perfect satire against the government, is
revealed to be a lunatic story by a member of the asylum.  But looking back
at it today, especially with that final shot, it actually makes the film
creepier and scarier.  We wonder if the story did or did not happen, and
this the fact that we never really find out is even scarier.</P>
<P>One of the things I like most in films are when they combine a great
stylistic atmosphere and an intriguing story, which holds our attention,
and may even carry a strong political message.  "The Cabinet of Dr.
Caligari" is a perfect example of this kind of film.  Here's a film which
was made when film was still in the pioneer stages, and it takes advantage
of everything it has, turning any kind of fault it may have into an
advantage.</P>
<P>Afterwards, we're left with not only an idea of how many people felt of
themselves being a society as well as their government, but we also see
some of the best example of style ever put on celluloid.  Images like that
of Dr. Caligari looking up at Francis midway through the film, and the
streets of the city are what remain with us forever.  A scene like that
where Cesare tries to kill Francis' sleeping fiance and the following chase
are what we'll always remember.  And "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is a
film which is not only one of the best films of the silent era (or the
German Expressionist era), but also one of the best films ever made.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
