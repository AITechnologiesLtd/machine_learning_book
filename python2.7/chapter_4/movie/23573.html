<PRE>                              MY DOG SKIP
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A well-textured true story of a boy
          and his dog made with high production values is
          marred by what seems like exaggerated story
          telling.  Willie Morris, former editor-in-chief of
          HARPER'S MAGAZINE, recalls his close relationship
          growing up with the title character.  It is a
          beautiful recreation of 1940s wartime Mississippi
          with a good score, and at times the story line is
          moving, but Skip is a little too intelligent to be
          believed.  Not the best dog story going but still
          one of the better family films of the year.
          Rating: 6 (0 to 10), +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Roger Ebert talks about going into MY DOG SKIP expecting it to be
just another animal film and being won over by it.  It reminded him of
his dog when he was growing up.  I have to say my experience was just
the opposite.  I admit I happen to like a good sentimental animal story
and particularly a dog story.  Growing up I also had a dog, Sam, whom I
loved very much.  And before, during, and after my experience of
growing up with Sam I thoroughly enjoyed dog films.  Not just the big
famous ones like OLD YELLER, but I still get misty over GOODBYE MY LADY
and the 1959 A DOG OF FLANDERS.  More recently I enjoyed SHILOH.  And
it was in this vein that I went into MY DOG SKIP actually expecting to
like it, even if other people would think me silly.</P>
<P>     Quite to my surprise, in spite of expectation and good reviews, it
is not a good dog story.  And for one very important reason.  For a dog
film to work, the dog has to be believable.  I consider a dog to be a
very intelligent animal, but not like Skip.  Skip does things that I
cannot believe any dog would do.  In one scene, Skip's master Willie is
supposed to be playing football, but freezes up when the ball falls at
his feet.  Sizing up the situation, Skip the wonder dog runs forward,
picks of the football in his teeth and jumps into Willie's arms.  Also,
several times in the film Skip plays matchmaker, getting his young
master together with a cute little girl.  A dog is an intelligent
animal, but it is too hard to believe he is that intelligent.  Too
often when we should be drawn into the story we feel the presence of
Skip's trainer just out of camera reach.</P>
<P>     Growing up in Yazoo, Mississippi, in 1942 is not easy for Willie
Morris (Frankie Muniz).  Willis is something of a loner anyway, picked
on by the local bullies.  Willie does not make friends easily.  His
closest friend was his next doors neighbor, Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson)
a local sports hero.  But Luke went off to war and Willie is lonely and
virtually friendless.  Willie cannot think of a single friend his own
age to invite to his birthday party.  And Willie desperately needs
friends.  Willie's father Jack (Kevin Bacon) seems to have lost any
human warmth he had along with a leg in the Spanish Civil War.
Willie's loving mother Ellen (Diane Lane) sees her son's loneliness and
wants to get the boy a dog.  But Jack absolutely refuses.</P>
<P>     Of course, we know that eventually Willie will get his dog, but
what is unexpected is how having Skip changes Willie's life so
completely.  Through the dog's ministrations Willie proves himself and
befriends the local bully who formerly preyed on him.  Skip also
arranges to have the prettiest girl in school spread a fondness from
Skip to Willie.</P>
<P>     The film chronicles Willie's adventures with Skip.  Seeing a
newsreel about the Canine Corps, Willie becomes obsessed with giving
his best friend away to the military effort.  (Somehow this seems
unlikely but possible.)  In another subplot, Dink returns from the war
somewhat less a hero than he had been in local sports.  Skip will in
his way also help Dink.  The film frequently repeats an anti-violence
message as warfare and hunting are shown to have as ugly a side as is
possible to show in a family film.</P>
<P>     Frankie Muniz as Willie Morris has to hold the film together as
much or more than Haley Joel Osment did in THE SIXTH SENSE.  He has an
expressive face without the exaggeration that a Macaulay Culkin.  Diane
Lane is a little idealized as a mother, but less so than the dog.
Kevin Bacon seems a little young for fatherly roles.  William Ross's
score is sentimental and pleasant, though in one action scene seems a
little too close to John Williams's style.</P>
<P>     Perhaps some leeway is acceptable for sentimentality, but this
film was a little too hard to believe at face value.  This is an
acceptable dog story but not one of the best.  I rate it 6 on the 0 to
10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
