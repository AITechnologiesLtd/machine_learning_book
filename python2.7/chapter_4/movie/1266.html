                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     EUROPA, EUROPA is a film by Agnieszka Holland.  Rated R due to
nudity and violence.</P>
<P>     EUROPA, EUROPA (released in Europe as SOLOMON HITLERJUGEND) is the
true story of Solomon Perel who traveled not only through the geography
of central and eastern Europe in war but more importantly through the
ideological minefields of its competing systems -- Nazism and its war on
Jews, Communism at war with Hitler.  Solek joins every side, and
successfully hides his Jewishness and his circumcision for years.  He
survives to find finally an identity.  He is the ultimate chameleon, but
he is a charmed one.  He is a very cute boy and his physical
attractiveness make him acceptable to every group.  He is almost too
lucky--one has to be reminded that Holland's script is based on the
autobiography of the real Solomon Perel, a man alive in Israel
today--the level of coincidences, breaks, and miracles is almost too
high to work.</P>
<P>     But it is Holland's script and her sure-handed direction that yield
up a a delightful, horrifying, funny, intensely human movie.  There are
many excellently drawn characters who pass through Solek's bizarre
adventure: the gay German actor who discovers the secret of Solek's
circumcision and who becomes a beloved friend.  There is an hilarious
Nazi functionary who has her way with the new hero of the Fatherland.
There is the sweet and chilling Leni who wants to bear a baby for Hitler
and to slice Jewish throats.  And there are telling moments, little
epiphanies like Solek practicing his Hitler salute which becomes a
little jazz dance step.</P>
<P>     This is a brilliant, biting, funny, disturbing, threatening,
affirming film.  It has been playing in the Seattle area since last June
28 and is still drawing crowds.  Germany declined to make this its
official entry in the Oscar competition for a variety of bogus reason.
Obviously, EUROPA, EUROPA hits the wrong buttons in today's unified
Germany.</P>
<P>     I regret I hadn't gotten around to seeing it before today.  I
recommend you see it as soon as possible.  It is worth full price at the
box office.</P>
