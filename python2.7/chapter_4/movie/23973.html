<PRE>ROSEBUD</PRE>
<PRE>RETURN TO ME
Directed by Bonnie Hunt
Screenplay by Bonnie Hunt & Don Lake
With David Duchovny, Minnie Driver
(Theater)   PG     116 min.</PRE>
<P>     This is Bonnie Hunt's "Citizen Kane".  The talented second banana
comedienne wrote the story and the screenplay, starred, and directed.
In case you think the Welles connection slipped by Bonnie, the first
line uttered by her heroine is "Rosebud."</P>
<P>I've seen "Citizen Kane", Ms. Hunt, and "Return to Me" is no
"Citizen Kane".  On the other hand, it's a lot funnier and a lot more
romantic than "Citizen Kane".</P>
<P>A good bit of the action takes place at O'Reilly's Italian
Restaurant in Chicago, where Grace (Minnie Driver) works when she has
the heart for it.  She gets the heart for it when a zoologist (Joely
Richardson) dies in a car crash and her ticker is transplanted into
the expiring Grace.</P>
<P>The grieving widower (David Duchovny) shows up at O'Reilly's one
night a year or so later, and it's love at first sight.  Theirs is a
sweet, totally PG romance - he's the jacket-sharing, hand-holding
type, she's a winsome virgin whose dating career has been curtailed by
her bad heart.  She knows she should tell him about her heart
transplant, but can't seem to work up the nerve.  Then she discovers
whose heart it is she has.</P>
<P>The premise is a tad unlikely, but Hunt and her company play it
with such sweetness and good humor that it hardly matters.  There's
even a lovable dog and gorilla in case things aren't cute enough
already.  Duchovny files away Fox Muldur and learns to enjoy life.  He
and and Driver are appealing lovebirds, and when things threaten to
falter Hunt steps in with her unfailing charm, and brings along James
Belushi for some likable vulgarity.  And if that's not enough, there's
the gang in the back of O' Reilly's, an over-the-hill Irish-Italian
Rat Pack led by Robert Loggia and the wonderful Carroll O'Connor as
Grace's doting grandfather.  This isn't an Oscar-breeding kind of
movie, but worse performances than O'Connor's have grabbed the gold.</P>
<P>Hunt keeps the hankies popping out of the pocket pack with her
hearts-and-flowers story, but she never lets herself wallow too long
in sentiment before nudging things back onto the laugh track.  She
directs with the same pure timing she shows as an actress, and it
makes for a lovely movie.</P>
