<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A rather flat film noir that never gets that interesting. Eddie Shannon (Rooney)
is a lonely grease monkey and amateur racing driver, who is cruelly ribbed by
most of the men he works with and is insecure around women. Suddenly a very
attractive lady, Barbara Mathews (Foster), lures him to be her steady date
because her boyfriend, Steve Norris (Kevin McCarthy), whom he doesn't realize is
her boyfriend, wants her to get him to drive the getaway car during the robbery
of the Palm Springs bank. The gang needs an expert driver to go over a rough
road and get to an exit in a short time so that the robbers will avoid the
police roadblock. </P>
<P>Eddie only does it because he's afraid of losing Barbara, someone he has come to
love, even though they have no physical contact, in the week he has known her.
She cons him into doing it and he's so naive and hungry for her love that he's
clueless as to what she's up to. Steve's strong-arm partner, the wisecracking
Harold (Kelly), is ordered by the boss to bump off the poor sucker when he
returns to Steve's place after the successful heist and the guilt-ridden Barbara
tells him that he was setup as a chump. </P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in the next paragraph. </P>
<P>But Eddie skillfully crashes the car headed for a secluded Santa Monica beach
spot, where Steve is ordering him to go at gunpoint. This kills Harold, but the
injured Eddie returns to Steve's house, where he shoots him when he sees him
beating Barbara for disobeying his orders to not tell Eddie anything. The police
arrive, as Eddie comforts Barbara. </P>
<P>The film is best at capturing how lonely and isolated Eddie is, and how his
dreams of being a Grand Prix champion rider seem out of the question but are the
only tangible things he has going for him until Foster enters his life. Eddie is
portrayed in a sympathetic light, despite his poor judgment exercised. It's the
simpleness of this tale and lack of any pretensions that makes it convincing but
not necessarily sparkling. </P>
