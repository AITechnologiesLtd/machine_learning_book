<PRE>GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI
by Chad Shonk</PRE>
<PRE>The truth is boring.</PRE>
<P>A couple of months ago, I remember some customer telling me that they liked
FARGO because it was based on a true story. And I was like, yeah, that's kind
of cool that that's a true story. When people ask me about DONNIE BRASCO,
People say "another gangster movie?" and I'll be like "Yeah, but this one is
based on a true story." I thought that it being a true story somehow made it a
better movie.</P>
<PRE>What a load of horseshit.</PRE>
<P>For every GOODFELLAS or FARGO, there are FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND made-for-TV
shitfests that are based on every single goddamn true story that ever happened.
Life itself is boring as shit. That's why we need movies. But every once in a
while something hapens in real life that is worthy of a movie. Quite simply, a
movie is a movie, whether its source is reality or or the mind of Yahoo Serious
or a best-selling pulp novel. </P>
<P>This all brings me to Rob Reiner's GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI. This movie was
virtually ignored at the box office and by critics (except for James Woods'
performance, and rightfully so) but it really isn't all that bad. Alec Baldwin
was a little stiff and Whoopi Goldberg has been better. The supporting cast was
good and Reiner's directing is solid. But I was watching this movie and
thinking, "This is boring." Why was it boring? Because I had seen it all
before. It was familiar ground. There wasn't anything original about it. </P>
<P>What bothered me about these observations is that it was a true story.</P>
<P>GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI tells the story of a civil rights leader named Medgar
Evars who was shot in his driveway by an assassin in the early sixties. Thirty
years after the crime, the killer is finally brought to justice by the
Mississippi DA. Alec Baldwin plays the Great White Hope lawyer who loses his
wife and his respectability and gets his life threatened because of his
dedication to the case. He gets called a "nigger lover" and cries a lot and
shit. At the end, they get the conviction and everybody's happy. </P>
<P>Before seeing this movie, I did not know anything about Medgar Evars. I still
do not. A daring movie to make would have been a biography of Medgar Evars, but
they didn't do that. Instead, they reduced the film in to the generic courtroom
drama that we've seen a million times in Grisham adaptations and the like. The
white DA gets the case, and dedicates himself to it against the advice of his
wife and other people involved. He goes around gathering evidence with the help
of a few loyal friends (one of which plays comic relief) and then goes to court
and gets death threats and learns something about himself and then makes a
heart-stirring closing argument and justice is served and everything is okay in
the end. A TIME TO KILL and A FEW GOOD MEN (also by Reiner) are the same exact
thing. That's just off the top of my head. I'm sure there are more. </P>
<P>The Great White Hope thing didn't bother me as much as others because of the
way it happened and and also because, well, I'm white, and we've been taught to
feel that we are the world's only saviors. It was the fact that this TRUE story
was presented in such an unoriginal way. But how else could they have presented
it?</P>
<P>The dream racial courtroom drama would take the cast of A TIME TO KILL and and
have them play the parts in GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI because it's a true story. I
dunno. Everything's been done I guess. Even stories that have never been done
before have been done before. That sucks.</P>
