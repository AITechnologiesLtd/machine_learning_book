<P>     Nickelodeon's first foray into feature filmmaking is an overlong
kiddie drama that stars Michelle Trachtenberg as a precocious sixth-
grader and self-proclaimed spy.  Her afternoons are spent sneaking
around and spying on people.  She writes down everything she sees in a
private notebook, which later falls into the hands of her classmates
with predictably disastrous results.  The story, adapted from the
classic children's book by Louise Fitzhugh, plays like a pre-teen
version of WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE.  They act cruel, she acts crueler,
and then everyone goes off to apologize and live happily ever after.
Unlike Dawn Weiner, the central character from DOLLHOUSE, Harriet also
gets to exact revenge on her classmates.  However, this being a movie
intended for kids, she must be taught a lesson and doesn't get to savor
the pleasures of being mean.  Too bad she can't get back at her busy
parents, who have long-since delegated the responsibility of raising her
to a live-in nanny.  Now *that* could be considered cruel.</P>
