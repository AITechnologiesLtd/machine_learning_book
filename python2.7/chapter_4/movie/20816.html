<P> A documentary with James Newton, Thomas Edison, Harvey Firestone, Henry
Ford, Charles Lindbergh. Not Rated (nothing offensive).</P>
<P>James Newton is one fortunate fellow. The 94-year-old Floridian can tout
being intimate friends with some of the world's most influential people.
Yes, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh and Harvey Firestone
were all Newton's cronies and the man is quite proud of his relationship
with them. Uncommon Friends of the 20th Century, a new documentary
narrated by Walter Cronkite claims to tell Newton's story; in reality,
however, it is only a mildly diverting history lesson, and not a very
complete one at that.
The film tackles its subjects almost methodically, starting with Edison
and wrapping up with Lindbergh. Insight isn't this 63 minute
production's forte; we do, however, get enough interesting tidbits to
hold our attention for its mercifully short running time. We learn, for
example, that Thomas Edison loved children and did his best to boost
their self-confidence. We discover that Lindbergh's greatest foe on his
journey across the Atlantic was sleep. Firestone, evidently, was the
"human portrait of dignity". We are given countless little factoids like
that which, while interesting, don't amount to much.</P>
<P>Much of Uncommon Friends feels utterly authentic, with genuine, well-
edited footage of its subjects and compelling narration by the
dependable journalist Cronkite. Unfortunately the film is intercut with
"dramatic reenacments" that are lame, inept and horrifyingly cheesy.
They undermine the film's otherwise prevalent sense of verisimilitude,
making it seem phony, somehow contrived (especially in retrospect).</P>
<P>This is a very conventional documentary hiding behind a rather original
facade. You see, it has very little to do with James Newton, and the
material they put in about him is little more than a justification to be
able to put his name in the synopsis and name the film Uncommon Friends
of the 20th Century. This doesn't, I suppose, negatively affect the
movie if judged on its cinematic merits, but it does add to its
fabricated feel.</P>
<P>Considering all its flaws, Uncommon Friends of the 20th Century is
really better than it deserves to be. Truth be told, I enjoyed it
despite its reenactments, deceitful title and hollow structure. The
movie ends, as many documentaries do, by updating us on the current
status of its (alleged) subject. As we were being told that James Newton
lives in Florida with his wife, likes long walks on the beach, etc., All
I could think was "Who cares?" But the stories of Edison, Firestone,
Ford and Lindbergh, American legends, still manage to be compelling.</P>
