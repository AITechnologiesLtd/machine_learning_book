<P>One Fine Day must've seemed like a great idea at the time. Let's pair up 
Hollywood's latest heartthrob with Michelle Pfeiffer. I can see why the 
studio and the stars fell for it. Heck, I even fell for the idea. I was 
eagerly anticipating this movie. Unfortunately, the movie is empty, 
unfunny, and unromantic until the last 10 minutes.</P>
<P>Clooney stars as Jack Taylor, a newspaper columnist whose picture is on 
alot of busses. His wife drops his daughter off because she is going on a 
honeymoon with her new husband. Jack receives very specific instructions 
to call Melanie Parker and let her know if she doesn't need to pick his 
daughter up for a feild trip. Obviously, Jack forgets, and both Jack's 
daughter and Melanie's son miss the feild trip. This begins a long day 
(especially for the viewer) where they go on misadventures around the 
city with their kids, while trying to get their jobs done.</P>
<P>The first problem with the movie is it actually thinks we care wether or 
not Melanie and Jack are able to get their jobs done in time. It also 
thinks we care that Melanie's son has a deadbeat father who is touring 
with Springsteen. I cared about Melanie and Jack, because Clooney and 
Pfeiffer make them into interesting characters that I would like to see 
together. Unfortunately, the movie throws in a dozen subplots, few of 
which are interesting. I mean, I don't care if Melanie's son likes to 
stick things up his nose. I don't care if Jack's daughter has a penchant 
for wandering off. And then there is a scene with a kitten that is just 
so stupid it's not even funny.</P>
<P>There were some good moments in the film. Charles Durning has some 
hilarious moments as Jack's editor. George Clooney shows considerable 
skill at light comedy. He has a natural screen presence, and never seems 
like he's trying to be funny. Michaelle Pfeiffer is is terrific as always.
The final scene between Clooney and Pfeiffer is sweet and touching. 
After waiting the whole time for the movie to end, sudeenly I didn't want 
it to. But then it did.</P>
