<P>Anthony Hopkins could very well be the greatest actor alive today.  Cuba
Gooding Jr. could very well be the greatest young actor alive today.  What
happens when you mix then in a film similar to one of Hopkins' classics,
Silence of the Lambs?</P>
<P>Primatologist Ethan Powell, played by Anthony Hopkins, has an obsession with
the species of gorilla.  For a long time, Ethan lived with gorillas in the
forests of Africa, abandoning his wife and daughter Lynn, played by Maura
Tierney, taking on their behavior, becoming a part of their family.  After
being found, Powell is accused of clubbing two park rangers to death, but he
chooses to remain silent at all times, so therefore he cannot represent himself
in court to defend himself.  To try to break the barrier, to try and regain the
person that Dr. Powell once was, psychiatrist Theo Caulder, played by Cuba
Gooding Jr. is sent in to try to put an end to the mystery.</P>
<P>As Theo continues to meet with the strange man, he starts to unravel the
mystery behind him.  During every visitation between the two, Theo unlocks
another secret that start to lead to the question- Is this man really that bad?
 The two start to become friends of sorts, speaking frequently.  Unfortunately,
to Lynn's dismay, Ethan refuses to discuss her, and when her name comes up he
becomes very angry.  Theo is now not only meeting with his main focus, but
other patients at the high security Florida prison.  The film goes off into a
sub-plot about morals, and treating people right, especially in prison.  I
would have liked it if the writers stuck with the main plot, and not gone off
with a much seen plot. </P>
<P>Cuba Gooding Jr. is exceeding any past performance of his in Instinct, but
unfortunately, the rest of the cast, plot, and the poor directing by John
Turteltaub do not live up to the astonishing performance that he put forward. 
Believe it or not, Anthony Hopkins actually didn't do all that admirable at his
underwritten role.  Maybe if the screenplay writer, Gerald Di Pego, had done
more with Dr. Ethan Powell than have him sit there and say a word here and
there, Anthony Hopkins could have given a much more commendable performance.</P>
<P>Instinct frustrated me with all of my might.  It is one of those films that is
like a go-cart.  It gets going, and then it stops.  It slowly gains speed, only
to be shut down once again.  Instinct is the exact same way.  The perfect time
to set off something happens all over the place, but nothing happens, except
for the scenes comes to and end.  Because of this, Instinct never really went
anywhere.  It ended up being more of a history book than a movie.  The moral of
the story was an exceptionally brilliant one, but it has been used so many
times in other movies, the repetitiveness is getting annoying.  Yes, we know by
know, Hollywood, that killing animals and judging people is wrong.  Can't we
move on?  I'm not saying this movie is bad for this repetitive moral, I am just
saying that filmmakers today should move on to bigger and better things.   The
plot and characters barely develop, and barely anything is accomplished during
the entire film.</P>
<P>When going into Instinct, I expected a thrilling, exciting film with starring
two of today's greatest actors.  Instead of that, I got a slow drama, copying
off of many past films, trying to mix Silence of the Lambs with Patch Adams,
and excluding Cuba Gooding Jr., the actors seemed like copycats trying to act
like the actors.  Is this because of the poor writing and directing, or are
these actors really running out of steam?  Director Turteltaub tries to use the
same sort of style he did in the wonderful film Phenomenon, where everything
came pretty slow, and ended up in something great, but in Instinct, it doesn't
really end up anywhere.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- Cuba Gooding Jr. and Anthony Hopkins should have used their
instincts, and stayed away from this poorly written drama.</P>
