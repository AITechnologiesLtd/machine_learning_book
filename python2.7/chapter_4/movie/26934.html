102 Dalmatians</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Usually, I like kid's flicks - I loved "Rugrats." But I growled through both
live-action 101 and 102 - ultimately all two hundred and three of these
Dalmatians. Despite my feelings, apparently allure exists, since Disney
opted for a sequel. And admittedly, I did overhear two young boys excitedly
telling each other their favorite movie parts while exiting the theater.</P>
<P>After a miraculous psychological cure, Cruella loves puppies and hence is
released on parole. Her parole officer is none other than Dipstick's owner
Zoey.</P>
<P>The few tricks deserving praise:
1) Again, grand costuming, especially on Cruella de Vil. 2)Nice opening
credits (you'll see spots). 3) When a cute puppy Dalmatian peers with sad
eyes at his spotless reflection in a mirror. 4) When the new Cruella shouts
"Murderer." Alonzo makes a great nervous butler. 5)Cruella's transformation.
6) "Lady and the Tramp" homage and Tony's restaurant reprise. 7) Parrot that
sings the cop to sleep. 8) Skinny dog with wild hair.</P>
<P>And the theater did explode with laughter twice - maybe three times, but not
more than that.</P>
<P>My bones:
In addition to the near total lack of any bones thrown to the adult
audience, here are some specific dog bites that left me gritting my teeth,
1) Giving a dog a new hairdo might sound good on paper, but on screen wasn't
funny. 2) One minute the dog is on the roof, the next cut he's hanging from
some ascending balloons. Where was the leap? Did the dog refuse to do the
trick? 3) The dogs pick out Zoey's clothing, another careful scene that
didn't hit the mark. 4) Cruella's cohort exclaims, "Steeling puppies is like
taking the baby from the candy." I don't know if kids find that cute, but to
an adult it's as painful as the empty chime of ... "I'm really beginning to
dislike that woman." 5) As we approach the climax a pseudo car-chase is
injected but with absolutely no point - perhaps only to amuse the youngsters
who don't need a point. 6) Continuing in the theme of pointlessness, the
film wraps itself up in a pie machine simulation from "Chicken Run."</P>
<P>To be honest, I just don't know how your kids will react to this film; you,
however, might want to bring something to read.</P>
