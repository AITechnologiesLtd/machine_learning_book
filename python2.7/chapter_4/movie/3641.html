<P>     A "family movie" is often loosely defined as a motion picture that, 
aimed at children, is likely to bore parents to tears.  Numerous 
examples leap to mind, most of them from Walt Disney Studios, a 
production company that holds the curious distinction of making animated 
features that are more mature than live-action ones.  However, A LITTLE 
PRINCESS isn't from Disney, it's from Warner Brothers.  Most 
importantly, it's not only suitable for consumption by those over age 
10, it's actually enjoyable.   </P>
<P>     The film is based on the popular 1888 children's book SARA CREWE by 
Frances Hodgson Burnett.  This is the third filmed version, following 
1917's A LITTLE PRINCESS with Mary Pickford and 1939's, which featured 
Shirley Temple.  While not as good as 1993's THE SECRET GARDEN (another 
movie based on a Hodgson story), this new version of A LITTLE PRINCESS 
can more than hold its own in a sea of overly-commercial attempts to 
grab children's hard-earned money.  Unfortunately, since it actually 
takes the time to develop characters and a story while eschewing 
explosions, it's unlikely to garner much at the box office.  Witness the 
performance of similar recent films if you doubt that. </P>
<P>     The main character is Sara, played delightfully by newcomer Liesel 
Matthews.  The motherless girl has grown up in India, a land where "the 
air is so hot you can taste it."  In fact, the scenes there are filmed 
with warmth and color to emphasize the beauty as seen through Sara's 
eyes.  The year is 1914, and World War One is in full swing.  When 
Sara's father (played by Liam Cunningham), a British army captain, 
decides to rejoin his regiment, he deposits Sara in an exclusive girls' 
school in New York City.  Run by the nasty Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron), 
this is a place that stifles creativity in favor of etiquette and strict 
rules.  Sara is immediately unhappy there, but her fortunes go from bad 
to worse when her father is declared dead in Europe and all his assets 
are seized by the Indian government.  Sara is left penniless and forced 
to work as a servant to earn her keep. </P>
<P>     A LITTLE PRINCESS is an engaging tale about self-respect and the 
importance of imagination.  In India, Sara is told that "all girls are 
princesses", and this is a lesson she clings to when forced to mop 
floors and serve meals.  Even dressed in rags and living in a bare attic 
room, she is special -- and so are all the others around her, regardless 
of whether they're nice, snobbish, or bossy.  Princess or pauper, 
there's no difference in Sara's eyes.   </P>
<P>     She also accepts magic.  In her father's words, "Magic has to be 
believed -- that's the only way it's real."  Her stories about Princess 
Sita and Prince Rama not only enchant her schoolmates, but they give 
Sara an escape route once her father has been declared dead.  She uses 
fantasy as a tonic for her bleak reality without ever losing sight of 
what's happening around her.  Together with her friend Becky (Vanessa 
Lee Chester), she ventures to amazing places without leaving her room. </P>
<P>     To be sure, A LITTLE PRINCESS has a few missteps.  For one thing, 
Miss Minchin could have been played with less villainy, but younger 
viewers will probably appreciate the one-dimensional nastiness.  There 
are also a few moments of overt sweetness, but these are easily 
forgiven.  Actually, there's very little this movie has to apologize for 
-- it's the rare kind of picture that can be enjoyed by viewers of 
eight, eighteen, and eighty. </P>
