<P>Review by Lars Lindahl (<A HREF="mailto:larsattacks@mail.com">larsattacks@mail.com</A>)</P>
<P>"Evil Dead II" (1987) ***1/2 (out of four)</P>
<PRE>Directed by Sam Raimi
Written by Sam Raimi and Scott Spiegel</PRE>
<P>Starring Bruce Campbell, Sarah Berry, Dan Hicks,
Kassie DePaiva, and Denise Bixler</P>
<P>Is Evil Dead II a bad movie? It's full of terrible
acting, pointless violence, and plot holes yet it
remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its
release. Explaining why this movie stands out from
others with similar plots (including the original Evil
Dead) is extremely difficult.</P>
<PRE>`Well what's it about?'</PRE>
<P>`Five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of
nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from 
a variety of ugly, hairy, wart covered monsters.'</P>
<P>`Come on I saw a movie just like that on Monster
Vision last week. Why should I see it again?'</P>
<P>`No Evil Dead II is different, it's funny.'</P>
<PRE>`It's funny to see people die? Are you sick or
something?'</PRE>
<P>Maybe I am and maybe director Sam Raimi is as well to
create such an enigma of a movie. His unique execution
is as sarcastic as subtle, as disturbing as it is
hilarious. An example of Raimi's odd approach: a
monster (formerly protagonist Ash's girlfriend of all
people) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave
of blood comes from the open wound. Sure it's
over-the-top, but it is so over-the-top that it is
laugh out loud funny; just try watching Ash with a
straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten
gallons of blood, staining his face and knocking him
back a few feet. The whole movie is like this, watch
Ash get beat up, watch Ash defeat the monster, watch
Ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster.
The more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets,
the more amusing it becomes. No matter how sick it may
sound, it is funny to watch Bruce ampbell's Ash get
his butt kicked every five minutes.</P>
<P>And Raimi takes advantage, he has Ash tormented by the
head of his girlfriend, by the body of 
an old lady, even by his own right hand. Like the less
superior Idle Hands, we watch Ash uncontrollably hit
himself over and over again until he is forced to cut
off his own body part. But it doesn't end, Ash now has
to fight his severed hand which now moves with the
same celerity as Thing from The Addams Family. All of
these events, thrown at you from minute one with
roller coaster- like camera movements, at first become
shocking, then inexplicably funny. Raimi expects the
audience to laugh and as the film progresses, he seems
to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the
classic mirror scene from the Marx Brothers' Duck
Soup, then bringing more characters into the picture
to comically kill them off. With a running time of
less than an hour and a half, Raimi gets away with the
impossible, making a horror film with more gore than
plot and intentionally more laughs than scares. Ending
Evil Dead II with an opening for the third film in the
series, Raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this
movie and couldn't wait to make it's sequel.</P>
<PRE>Grade: ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
