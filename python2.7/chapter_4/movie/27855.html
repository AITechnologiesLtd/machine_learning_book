Susan Granger's review of "THE MEXICAN" (DreamWorks)</PRE>
<P> Not only is vibrant Julia Roberts America's Sweetheart but
she's also this year's Golden Globe winner with a lock on the Best
Actress Oscar for "Erin Brockovich." Brad Pitt's been voted People
magazine's "Sexiest Man in the World."  They possess two of the
screen's most photogenic faces, so teaming them, along with "The
Sopranos" Joe Gandolfini, was a stroke of marketing genius. Based on a
fateful screenplay by J.H. Wyman, directed by Gore Verbinski ("Mouse
Hunt"), the story follows a reluctant bagman (Pitt) who is sent to
Mexico to retrieve a legendary pistol, known as The
Mexican. Supposedly, it was crafted as a wedding present for a
nobleman if he'd marry the gunsmith's daughter who, in turn, loved her
father's apprentice who rigged the gun to misfire if it fell into the
wrong hands. He figures this errand should end his indentured
servitude to an underworld crime boss for past misdeeds.</P>
<P>  While Pitt, a lovable dork, has a serious problem with
moving vehicles, he's got even more of a problem with his group
therapy-addicted girl-friend (Roberts) who spouts psycho-babble and
demands that he join her in Las Vegas. ("When do you get to that point
if enough is enough?" she muses.) Finding the cursed pistol is easy
but getting it back is complicated, particularly when she's taken
hostage by a hitman (Gandolfini). This divergent plot is important
because the stars actually have few scenes together - which is a
mistake. Both exude charm and handle the comedy well but the pacing is
uneven and the pairing unsatisfying. The soundtrack's fun,
particularly Nancy Sinatra's "These Boots Were Made for Walkin'". On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Mexican" is a visually
stylish 7. It's a quirky caper movie about destiny.</P>
