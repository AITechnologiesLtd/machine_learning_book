<PRE>                       THE WINGS OF THE DOVE 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                  3 :-) :-) :-)  for the wings of love</PRE>
<P>Cast: Helena Bonham Carter, Linus Roache, Alison Elliott, Charlotte
Rampling, Elizabeth McGovern, Michael Gambon, Alex Jennings Director:
Iain Softley</P>
<P>Silently she walks across the train carriage, her delicate eyes at first
downcast, her porcelain complexion hiding the pounding excitement that
fills her veins. Timidly she looks up, to find a gentleman who stands,
allowing her to take his seat. She trembles as her hand brushes against
his coat; momentarily she closes her eyes to allow his presence to fill
her. Her fingers long to touch his, but precaution restrains temptation.
Wisely she waits for the train to stop. Departing the carriage like a
bird taking flight, he follows like a moth attracted to the flame.
Together they enter a lift, when alone at last restraint falls from the
hand like a misplaced glove. The first touch, the kiss and embrace is
passion defined. She is an heiress, awaiting her fortune, to be disowned
if found in his presence. He is a man of no consequence, with everything
to gain and nothing to lose. She is Kate and he is Merton and when their
lust is forbidden, a way is found to find a fortune to fulfil their
communion.</P>
<P>There is another, her eyes are sad. An orphan who has everything in life
except for one true love, and nothing in death, except a wealthy
inheritance to fall where true love lies. Life has cursed her with frail
health and death bids his time at her doorstep. Her gift to the world is
her choice to see the good in all, and generosity is her mantle piece.
So these sad eyes fall on a man of no consequence and to him she bestows
her parting gift, for she can only see the good in him. She is Millie
and he is Merton. When death comes on raven wings to this sweet child,
regret and sorrow fills the man who deceived innocent love. For nothing
can lift his heinous crime except for the wings of the dove.</P>
<P>Reflections on ‘The Wings of the Dove' by TMT Voon.</P>
<P>This movie is beautifully crafted and almost flows like poetry. The
hauntingly sad tale carries with it complex issues about love and
betrayal. Helena Bonham Carter is exquisite as the passionate Kate, who
devises the plan to obtain Millie's fortune. Linus Roache plays Merton,
the man who agrees to win Millie's affections and thus her inheritance,
before being filled with despair for having partaken of the evil deed.
Lastly, Allison Elliot plays the role of Millie, the dying heiress whose
trusting belief in others is abused by the aforementioned. This is a
touching story, which may not be appreciated by all, but is a
wonderfully acted and performed piece of cinema. Well worth watching.</P>
