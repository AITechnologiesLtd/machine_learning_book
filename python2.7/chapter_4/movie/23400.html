<P>Is it somehow bending the rules of screenwriting not to insert the
intended title of your project into a script nowadays? We witnessed it
just last week in `The Whole Nine Yards', in which a certain character's
vocabulary stumbled over the phrase, even though it didn't necessarily
apply. It's a similar case with `Reindeer Games', a limp new heist
thriller utterly devoid of the kinetic energy and stimulating action
that it requires to heat up the cineplex during the snowy season. The
villain, a shaggy, long-haired trucker named Gabriel (Gary Sinise,
channeling Lieutenant Dan from `Forrest Gump') stands over our
protagonist Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) with gun in hand. In a moment of
questioning Rudy's honesty, Gabriel threatens him by incorporating
Rudolph & Co. into the conversation: `Don't you play no reindeer games
with me.' Now, what exactly are ‘reindeer games'? The term is fairly
vague. Originally, I thought it was a catchy title for a
Christmas-oriented action/adventure, but having a character utter it so
deliberately is just plain goofy.</P>
<P>Granted, there are bigger problems with `Reindeer Games' and its overly
trite, fatigue-ridden script (written by flavor-of-the-month Ehren
Kruger, the `Scream 3' scribe). After a striking opening collage of
snow-covered imagery, we cut to a Michigan prison environment. In for
auto theft, Rudy and his cellmate Nick (James Frain) are eagerly
anticipating their release in a mere two days - Nick in particular, who
has been carrying on a steamy postal relationship with a beautiful
pen-pal named Ashley Mercer (Charlize Theron). But in the aftermath of a
violent cafeteria scuffle, Nick is stabbed to death. This leaves Rudy in
a certain dilemma of conscience: once he sees Ashley outside the prison,
should he explain the tragic situation or walk on by? Ignoring those
options, Rudy does something really absurd... he poses as Nick. Having
never seen a photo of the real Nick, Ashley will not be able to identify
the impostor, leaving the cute couple with a sexy Christmas holiday for
roasting chestnuts on the open fire.</P>
<P>The situation, however, is complicated by Gabriel - Ashley's criminal
brother. Gabriel and his elite team of gun-runner underlings (Danny
Trejo, Clarence Williams III and Donal Logue) want to take down The
Tomahawk, a wealthy casino built on an Indian reservation. To do this,
they require Nick's expertise of the structure and the security, some
knowledge he would have attained from working at The Tomahawk a few
years back. Unfortunately, Gabriel and his goons don't have Nick....
they have Rudy posing as Nick. Kruger proceeds to complicate matters
even further, tossing in a few 360 degree twists and thickening the
mixture drastically as the casino robbery nears execution. It may read
like a made-for-cable plotline, but Kruger's premise is both a clever
and promising set-up for high-wire action/adventure. Imagine my
disappointment when I realized how sluggish and unexciting `Reindeer
Games' actually was. It's a thriller of perplexing tedium, limply
directed by aging legend John Frankheimer (`The Manchurian Candidate'),
which is a surprising pratfall given his last film was the rousing chase
film `Ronin'. The fact that `Reindeer Games' is thoroughly lacking
visual flair and animation coupled with the detached presentation of a
few action sequences makes for... well, a rather ho-hum experience.</P>
<P>The proverbial nail in the coffin, however, was an insipid move that
Kruger could now label his trademark punch: the final twist. It worked
marvelously for him in the terrorist thriller `Arlington Road', but here
Kruger indulges to the point of idiocy. No one will be able to foresee
such a doozy of a twist, but that doesn't mean it's clever - a better
choice of words would be ludicrous and illogical. Kruger does have the
talent to make a name for himself in the screenwriting underworld of
Hollywood. His script for `Reindeer Games' is not a total loss, with a
pair of genuinely funny one-liners and a handful of inventive moments
sprinkled with humor and suspense. He just underestimates the
intelligence of the audience too often.</P>
<P>‘Tis a shame, because Frankenheimer does coax a few enjoyable
performances from Sinise (taking the villainous grunge look to new
extremes) and Theron (beautiful and light-footed wherever her travels
take her). Affleck has trouble convincing us that he's an ex-con, but he
does alright. While not totally defective in the suspense department,
`Reindeer Games' doesn't succeed at much anything. It's a mediocre
mystery, a lazy action film and a decidedly unfestive Christmas movie.
Let the `Games' begin.... at your own risk, of course.</P>
