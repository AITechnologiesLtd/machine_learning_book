<PRE>                             BELLS FROM THE DEEP
                       A film review by Max Hoffmann
                        Copyright 1993 Max Hoffmann</PRE>
<P>Seen: Fri 5/7/93, Camera 3 San Jose, SF Film Festival
Rating: 10 (scale of 1->10)</P>
<PRE>Director: Werner Herzog
Camera: ???
Editor: ???
Running Time: less than an hour</PRE>
<P>     There were no program notes on this late entry at the festival,
and it was too dark in the theatre to capture the rushing credits.  In
a nutshell, Herzog sets his camera running with beautiful backdrops
throughout Russia.  He places various peasants and country folk who
speak directly to the lens about their religion/faith/superstitions.
It's fascinating viewing.  This would be the equivalent to letting the
camera roll in the backwoods of America to let snake handlers and holy
rollers tell their view of reality.</P>
<P>     Near Mongolia, we see the "Yulas," tribes who make strange, deep
frog-like croakings to reach a meditative state.  View old people on
their hands and knees crawling around Lake Kitesh, where they believe
there is an enchanted city with angels at the bottom.  More chilling is
the image of the faithful crawling out "on thin ice" as far as they can
to "view" the city below them.  As they do, you hear the eerie tearing
noises of cracking ice.</P>
<P>     A believable "Rasputin" (redeemer) makes frequent appearances and
comments, with a DaVinci like river background.  You hear him speaking
in endless New Testiment-like platitudes reminiscent of Elizabeth
Claire Prophet.  (In light of the recent Waco faithful-fry, it's
sometimes chilling.)  In the director's Q/A afterward, Herzog revealed
at the time of the filming last year there were about a hundred
"Rasputins" claiming to be Jesus returned.  Now the number is closer to
three hundred.  This s a normal phenomenon that occurs whenever Russia
is in a state of crisis and the faithful have trouble coping with a
changing world.</P>
<P>     Although you try not to snicker, some of the images approach Monty
Python humor; like the "grand sorcerer of Russia" who tries a mass
exorcism of a dozen highly spiritied "possessed" women on a high school
gymnasium stage.  Herzog takes a similar tack to LESSONS OF DARKNESS
where there is no narration to add judgement or a spin to what you are
viewing.  To an American audience, conditioned by CNN sound bites and
news images that resemble action sequences from a Bruce Willis trailer,
it's remarkably refreshing to have an extended view of a phenomenon and
be forced to draw your own reaction, without help.</P>
<P>     Very striking photography, and a lean but touching score.</P>
