<P>     THE YEAR OF MY JAPANESE COUSIN is written badly, acted poorly, and 
filmed with an amateurish lack of style.  This is what might result from 
a group of people deciding to put together a movie without a clear idea 
of what they're attempting.  THE YEAR OF MY JAPANESE COUSIN is 
essentially a rock music video that's extended to seventy minutes by 
including elements of a trite and melodramatic narrative.</P>
<P>     The story, such as it is, introduces us to Stevie (Selene Vigil), 
the lead singer of the band Scuba Boy.  Stevie's life is turned upside 
down when her Japanese cousin, Yukari (Janis Tanaka), arrives in the 
States for a visit.  Stevie starts out as Yukari's mentor and guide, 
but, as the young Japanese woman gains familiarity with America and 
displays a remarkable aptitude with a guitar, she becomes a popular 
performer.  Soon, she has usurped Stevie's place as Scuba Boy's leader, 
and the jealousy between the cousins threatens to destroy not only their 
relationship, but the band itself.</P>
<P>     THE YEAR OF MY JAPANESE COUSIN fails to take advantage of an 
opportunity to examine cultural differences between Japan and the United 
States.  The characters, like the script, are too shallow for any such 
meaningful exploration.  In fact, aside from a couple of throw-in lines, 
these issues are largely ignored.  Writer/director Maria Garguilo is 
obviously infatuated by Seattle's alternative rock scene, and all she 
shows a real interest in is capturing a segment of it on film.  She 
would have done better to try her hand at a documentary.</P>
<P>     Neither Vigil nor Tanaka shows a glimmer of acting ability.  They 
have a lot of energy and drive, which comes across in the concert 
scenes, but it's dreadful to watch them attempt drama.  None of the 
supporting performers are any better.  </P>
<P>     The movie's sole attraction is the rock soundtrack.  I suppose it's 
possible to derive limited enjoyment from THE YEAR OF MY JAPANESE COUSIN 
if you close your eyes, but, even then, you'll be subjected to a barrage 
of inept dialogue.  It's unlikely that this film will obtain significant 
exposure, which is fortunate, since its obscurity will spare most 
unaware viewers the indignity of sitting through it.</P>
