<P>There's nothing like taking a big, post-holiday breath, only to
experience something that smells like the ass of a man allergic to
toilet paper.  It happens every January, and unless you live in Iowa,
the stink is coming from your local megaplex.  Each year, as
Oscar-caliber films that saw limited release in major markets slowly
make their way to smaller cities, the big studios try to sneak their
worst films into theatres in the hope that you'll mistake Bette Midler's
Isn't She Great for Magnolia.</P>
<P>The trend continues this year with Double Take, a horrible film about
two characters who swap identities for reasons that still remain
unclear.  It's like a third-rate version of Kid 'N Play's Class Act,
which was a third-rate version of Trading Places, which I'm sure was a
third-rate version of something I'm just too young to remember.</P>
<P>Take stars two black men at opposite ends of the Manhattan social
spectrum. Daryl Chase (Orlando Jones from the 7UP commercials) is a
well-mannered, affluent "sell-out" who works for The Man and has a
supermodel girlfriend, while Freddy Tiffany (Eddie Griffin, Malcolm &
Eddie) is phat, hip and, supposedly, phunny.  They meet when a thief
snatches Daryl's briefcase on the way to work.  We don't ever learn what
it is that Daryl does for a living, but know it must be important when
Freddy exclaims, "Man, how you get a big-ass office like this?" after
following Daryl to work.</P>
<P>We do know that Daryl's company is involved in some shady dealings with
a lazy-eyed Mexican, and before you know it (literally - because it
makes no sense), he's discovering dead bodies and being attacked by
gun-wielding maniacs because of his business connections.  A few really
bad explanations later, Daryl is mistaken for a murderer and hops on a
train in search of a CIA agent who can get him out of this pickle.
Freddy tags along, doing his best impression of Liza (loud, theatrical
and exceedingly annoying).</P>
<P>Take features more double-crossing, backstabbing and hidden identities
than either of the two Mission: Impossible films, which means, for a
film of this magnitude, that the whole thing is a lot more complicated
and messy than it needs to be.  Writer/director George Gallo,
responsible for the equally awful Trouble in Paradise, seems more
concerned about the big surprise ending (which is sooo not a surprise)
than trying to establish any continuity to the film.</P>
<P>There is a seemingly endless string of completely ludicrous events, like
when Daryl and Freddy take the train from New York to Texas and get
there overnight.  In another scene, which takes place in the middle of
nowhere, Daryl is able to procure a car and a fake moustache to alter
his identity in an attempt to cross the border.  It would be one thing
if it didn't make sense and was funny, but there isn't one second of
entertainment for anyone that doesn't require a drool bib.  Most of the
jokes come at the expense of the NYPD and the Mexican character's lazy
eye – all things that are so, like, 1999.</P>
<P>Jones is likeable enough as the straight man, but Griffin is so bad, he
would have ruined the picture even if it wasn't poorly written and
directed. When the film's only real talent (Vivica A. Fox) gets gunned
down in the first ten minutes, you know you're going to be in for a long
ride.  There's also a whole lot of swearing, but nothing bad enough to
warrant an "R" rating.</P>
<P>1:30 – PG-13 for violence and adult language</P>
