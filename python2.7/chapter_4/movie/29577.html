<P>Synopsis: Chris Cole (Wahlberg) is the lead singer of a tribute band which 
covers his heavy metal idols, Steel Dragon. But Chris is so obsessed with 
getting the imitation precisely right that he finds himself drummed out of 
the group. As it happens, this coincides with Steel Dragon's ousting of 
their lead singer, and soon Chris -- together with girlfriend/manager 
Emily (Aniston) -- finds himself summoned to audition for the gig of his 
dreams.</P>
<P>Review: "Rock Star" probably could have been a much better movie had it 
been either much more humourous or much more serious. As it stands, it's 
an uncomfortable hodgepodge of melodrama and comedy, stuck in a hopelessly 
formulaic script by Stockwell, uninspiringly directed by Herek. "Rock 
Star" is like "Almost Famous" without a soul; there are no true characters 
here to explore, no situations of genuine pathos or wit. Instead, we are 
subjected to yet another brainless average-joe-makes-good plotline; there 
are a few decent laughs -- a fight between two competing tribute bands is 
a definite sight to see -- but more which fall flat. Stockwell's script is 
marred by moments of truly bad judgment; a post-concert orgy is apparently 
intended to demonstrate the seedy side of fame, but simply feels 
gratuitous. Some of the performances are worthy of praise; Spall in 
particular is good as jaded Steel Dragon road manager Mats. And Wahlberg 
brings a lot of enthusiasm to Chris, despite his lack of depth. But 
Aniston is just dull as Emily, and the rest of the supporting cast is 
singularly unmemorable. (Actually, I lie: Matthew Glave has two great 
early scenes as Chris' brother, but sadly is thereafter forgotten.) So 
trifling is the synergy between characters and audience that by the time 
we get to the pat, syrupy ending, it's frankly hard to care much anymore.</P>
