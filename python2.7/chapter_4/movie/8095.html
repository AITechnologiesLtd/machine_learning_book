<PRE>THE NUTTY PROFESSOR
 A film review by Timothy Voon
Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Eddie Murphy (Prof. Sherman Klump, Buddy Love, the entire Klump
family), Jada Pinkett (Clara Purty), Larry Miller (Dean Richmond).
Written by
David Sheffield, Barry W. Blaustein, Tom Shadyac, Steve Odekerk,.
Directed by Tom Shadyac.</P>
<P>I had heard rumours that Eddie Murphy had used this movie to poke fun at
fat people. After watching the movie, I remain unsure. It's like that
episode of ‘Seinfeld', where the dentist becomes Jewish, and has a field
day cracking jokes about Jews.</P>
<P>Whatever his intentions (money making I'm sure), at least the themes of
accepting yourself as you are come through by the end of the movie. Yes,
that cliched term ‘beauty comes from within' and, no, it's not something
that only fat and ugly people say to make themselves feel better.</P>
<P>Eddie Murphy has enough split personalities, to easily fill the roles of
Buddy Love and Sherman Klump with ease. He just acts himself to play
Buddy, and pretends to be nice  when Sherman. I still feel shivers
running down my spine when he does one of his cheesy smiles.</P>
<P>Sadly to say, much of the humour is generated at the expense, and
improper portrayal of fat people. Sitting around a dining table laden
with food enough to feed a glutton, bingeing in front of the T.V. set,
and stashing snacks is not a problem of the obese, but the bulimic.</P>
<P>Comment: Sherman Klump NOT Forrest Gump.</P>
