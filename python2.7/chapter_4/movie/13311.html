<P>This 40 minute Titanic is a beautiful, eerie piece of work, plunging 12,
500 feet beneath the unforgiving waters of the North Atlantic to examine 
the remains of the doomed ship. After seeing James Cameron's epic, gazing 
at the real thing becomes even more chilling. </P>
<P>The camera glides silently through the watery depths, capturing ghostly 
images: dinnerware strewn over the ocean floor, the remains of the 
steering mechanism of the captain's wheel, J.P. Morgan's cabin. For me, 
the line between fiction and reality blurred for just a moment, as I 
caught myself scanning the sandy sea bottom looking for Rose's necklace.</P>
<P>Intercut with the remarkable deep sea footage are vintage photographs of 
the ship and an interview with Eva Hart, who was 7 years old when her 
father placed her in the lifeboat and said "Be a good girl, hold mummy's 
hand." She never saw him again. </P>
<P>Eva's commentary is memorable. "I was calm until I saw the ship sinking 
and heard the people screaming," she explains in quiet tones, "I remember 
everything." Sitting in her English garden, the elderly woman reflects on 
the ship billed as unsinkable, saying "Mother thought to call it 
unsinkable was flying in the face of the Almighty."</P>
<P>Hart was worried when she heard about the 1985 discovery of the wreckage, 
fearing the site would be looted. Two years later it was. "They robbed a 
grave," she says, "The IMAX Titanic expedition weren't going down to 
plunder it. I think it's splendid."</P>
<P>The documentary is splendid as well. Commentary from a salty Russian 
expedition member adds welcome humor while maintaining the dignity such 
an excursion demands. Even in the huge theater, you feel a bit 
claustrophobic watching the two small submersibles fighting the 
incredible deep sea pressure as they head for the ocean floor. The 
photography is stunning, amazingly well-lighted and so clear that in some 
scenes it's difficult to remember that there is water between the camera 
and the remnants of the ship. </P>
<P>The film ends with an appropriate and touching gesture, as the crew 
leaves a bundle of flowers on the ocean floor, "for the children of 
Titanic." Like "Titanic," "Titanica" is a thoughtful remembrance of the 
lives lost when mankind's reach exceeded its grasp.</P>
