<PRE>                           THE CELLULOID CLOSET
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     The dictionaries define "unique" as "one of a kind."  No more
apt description fits The Celluloid Closet.  Narrated by Lily Tomlin,
using over one hundred film clips from the Thomas Edison experimental
film to the Oscar-winning Philadelphia, the movie is frequently
hilarious, thoroughly entertaining and always informative. The film is
based on the book by Vito Russo, the story of how Hollywood has over
the years shown gays and Lesbians.</P>
<P>     Having seen most of the films from the Chaplin days through the
present, I was surprised to find how little I knew about them.  I
never thought of the comic Edward Everett Horton  as supposed to be
portraying a gay character.  He was just funny and made us laugh.
The truth is I did not even know what a "gay" was.</P>
<P>     We knew about the Hays Office that had the power to censor films.
We knew that the Catholic Legion of Decency  made a list of films
which  good Catholics were forbidden to see.  That was then and
this is now but we still have those who would censor what can be seen,
The rating system is still with us.</P>
<P>     How we learned to view gays and Lesbians and how they learned to
view themselves came in large part from the Silver Screen.  Any
reference to homosexuality was sure to bring a laugh just as comedians
used Brooklyn and Cucamonga as laugh=getters.  Gayness on the screen
could be funny but it could also make you pity the poor unfortunates
A male costume designer was good for a laugh. . . . or a flouncy
waiter . . . . or any of a dozen stereotypes.  No one thought of
them as being homosexual; they were just sissies.  On the one hand
there were the John Waynes and on the other were the sissies.
Quentin Crisp remarks that when a man dresses as a woman, we find it
funny (SOME LIKE IT HOT) but a woman dressed as a man (Dietrich,
Garbo) was not only accepted but even was a source of titillation.</P>
<P>     Again, the film is unique.  My own favorite scene is at the end,
a clip of Tom Hanks and Anthony Banderas in their Navy uniforms, and
the voice over commentary that sums up this wonderful film.</P>
