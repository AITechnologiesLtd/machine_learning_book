<P>   When you pass by the doorman in front of that fairly
ordinary building, the security guard in a run-down
department store, the older man who sweeps up inside
McDonald's, does this thought cross your mind..."I wonder
whether this guy always dreamed of becoming a doorman, a
security guard, a sweeper?"  People do have youthful
dreams.  Go into any high school and ask the kids what they
expect to be doing in ten years, and you'll find one student
who is not even on the J.V. basketball team envisioning his
becoming the next Michael Jordan.  Another who hasn't taken
a course more difficult than health ed. is going to become a
neurosurgeon.  </P>
<P>   But as Jessica Lange's character once said, "People in hell
want ice water.  That doesn't mean that they get it."  Most of
us are bound to be thwarted.  It's only natural for our reach to
exceed our grasp.</P>
<P>   This motif of frustrated ambition is an old one: even less
fresh is the theme of adultery.  Yet when the two concepts
combine in Tony Goldwyn's directorial debut film, "A Walk on
the Moon," the story works, largely because of unusually
good casting combined with an engrossing authenticity. 
Those in the audience who have personally lived through the
period described and vacationed in locales similar to the one
portrayed here will feel a gratifying connection to the piece.  </P>
<P>   "A Walk on the Moon," which takes place in the Catskill
Mountains resort area in 1969 (actually filmed in Quebec's
Laurentien Mountains), is a poignant tale of a woman who
became pregnant at age 17, got married too young, and
regrets never having sown her wild oats.  Her husband,
however stymied in his job as a TV repairman because he
did not have the funds to go to college, comes across as
more accepting of his fate.  And therein lies the conflict
between the two.</P>
<P>   The story opens as Pearl Kantrowitz (Diane Lane) and her
devoted husband Marty (Liev Schreiber), pack up his mother,
their two kids, and an array of belongings, and head for their
usual summer bungalow resort in the mountains.  As was
typical during this period and in this culture, the husband
would work in the city and come up only for the weekends. 
When Pearl, envious of the sexual and other freedoms that
the youth culture of the late sixties were enjoying, became
attracted to an unconventional blouse salesman named
Walker Jerome (Viggo Mortensen), she indulges herself in an
affair with the young, handsome Gentile man without a
thought of the effect of this liaison on her marriage.</P>
<P>  At times the dialogue is laughably stilted, as when Pearl
tells her incensed husband, "I disappeared.  I wanted to be
the person you fell in love with."  The story flirts with cliche
as when Marty retorts, "Do you think you're the only one who
had dreams that didn't come true?"</P>
<P>   The tale, written by Pamela Gray under a production team
led by Dustin Hoffman, is an old-fashioned one told in the
most conventional, straightforward way. And yet it is more
affecting than quite a number of the so-called hip and edgy
comedies that come out of festivals like Sundance each year.
Director Goldwyn could not have hoped for a better performer
than Liev Schreiber to portray the stereotypical Jewish
husband, perfectly willing to sacrifice his own vacation so that
he could make enough to keep his family upstate, away from
the city heat.  At times Tovah Feldshuh steals the show as
the Bubbie, a visionary who can tell other people's fate from
their tea leaves and who quickly fathoms that her daughter-
in-law is straying.  Anna Pacquin as the 14-year-old daughter
who is experiencing her first period and her first date during
that summer of '69 dishes up a subplot, her own coming of
age paralleling her mom's newfound freedom and ecstasy.</P>
<P>   Goldwyn displays a decent emulation of the Woodstock
Festival of that momentous year, a time in which Neil
Armstrong walked the moon and young, groovy people were
making love, not war, in a way that would infuriate the uptight
elders.  "A Walk on the Moon" is a low-key romantic comedy
with melodramatic undertones--not a momentous film but one
whose superlative cast and accurate portrayal of what we
once did on our summer vacation is altogether pleasing.</P>
