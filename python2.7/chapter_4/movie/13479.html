<PRE>THE OPPOSITE OF SEX (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Don Roos
Starring: Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan, Lisa Kudrow, Ivan Sergei, Lyle
Lovett, Johnny Galecki, Colin Ferguson</P>
<P>Love.  Sex.  Motherhood.  Matrimony.  Obsession.  These, along with others,
are just some of the American ideals that are given a good skewering in
"The Opposite of Sex," a film that is as hilarious as it is blunt about
life, and is as edgy as it is trashy.  We have here a refreshing, amazingly
acted, and sometimes even romantic comedy that holds more outrageous twists
and selish and/or shallow characters than the entire run of "Melrose Place"
ever will, and makes itself extremely entertaining thanks to a fresh format
and a plot that just never stops becoming more and more weird.</P>
<P>The key to the whole film is that at some point, all of the characters
becomes selfish in one way or another, all because of ideals they hold
higher than anything else.  They bullshit themselves about things that
don't matter as much, and the one character who doesn't bullshit is the
film's protagonist, Deedee Truitt, a 16-year-old bottle-blond Lousiana
trailer park scumbucket who just happens to be the composite of every smart
blond from any film matched with every single femme fatale to ever grace
the screen.  Two catches: she's played to perfection by Christina Ricci,
who is finally coming into her own as a serious actress by destroying her
childhood movie career (and sucessfully); and she's our friendly narrator
for the entire duration of the film.</P>
<P>The film is just jam-packed with plot, so here's a quick run-down: Deedee
runs away from home with her one-testicled Christian-as-hell boyfriend
following the death of her tryannical stepfather, and ends up ditching him
so she can stay with her wealthy half-brother, Bill (Martin Donovan), an
openly gay school teacher.  She soon seduces his young dim live-in lover,
Matt (Ivan Sergei), who allegedly impregnates her after a couple romps in
the sack, and upon Bill's discovery of their tryst, the two hike off with
$10000 of Bill's.  That's only in the first fifteen minutes.</P>
<P>I won't reveal much more, but I will reveal some of the important
characters in the story, the most notable being Lucia (a non-dim Lisa
Kudrow), a bitter shrew who's opposed to sex and is friends with Bill
because her brother, Tom, was Bill's boyfriend for years until his
sorta-recent death, leaving the two in different forms of mourning.  Also
on the character list is Carl (Lyle Lovett), the lonely local sheriff who's
forced to investigate Bill because of molestation charges brought on by a
gay ex-pupil of his, Jason (Johnny Galecki), yet another weird character in
the film who's funniest moment comes towards the beginning when his pelvic
skwirming is explained as a "new piercing."</P>
<P>As the 100 minutes of the film fly by, covering everything from a sloppy
stakeout to even a murder and a birth, this film completely trashes every
ideal that its characters bring up, all skewered by our lovely narrator,
Deedee, who's cynicism is so seductive that some scenes I almost prayed for
her to come in with obnoxious commentary...and she did.  Two characters
will be discovering they are finally in love and Deedee will suddenly come
onto the soundtrack and say "Yuck."  Just what we were thinking.  Deedee
gives the film the exact feel it is going for, that of our reaction to
people's bullshit actions at that point in our lives when everything seems
phony.  Like Holden Caulfield, Deedee is convinced that everyone is not
being true to themselves, and that they are the only ones in the entire
world who are actually not lying to everyone else, even when she's twisting
people's arms and screwing people over.  She's just being true to her
nature, after all.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the characters in this film who are not Deedee are for the
most part likable, especially Bill, the poor guy who's career and basically
entire life are trampled over by the results of Deedee's actions, but who
still retains his dignity and respect.  And the film even boils down and
finds depth in the character of Lucia, who's at first just a bitch with a
whole bunch of great one-liners up her sleeve, but then discovers
everything she didn't know in the first place by finding love with the last
person in the cast you'd think would be a suitable mate.</P>
<P>It even deepens Deedee, who's unswerving for the basically the entire film,
and comes out of it as the one character who doesn't discover something
about themselves after all the shit has come down.  She comes off as a lot
like Linda Fiorentino in "The Last Seduction," and is played with the same
amount of talent by Ricci, who has finally come across as one of the best
younger actresses around, and one of the few, like Jodie Foster, to make
smart career moves by starring in risky movies.  Her character, who says in
the beginning "I don't have a heart of gold, and I don't grow one later,"
is almost the tragic character of the film, the one who spoils everything
yet learns nothing.  Yet by the end, we're still not sure if we want her to
grow a heart or not.  Would it spoil the movie or wouldn't it?</P>
<P>The film was written and directed by Don Roos, writer of such chick flicks
as "Single White Female" and "Boys on the Side," but who has finally struck
gold with "The Opposite of Sex," his directorial debut.  It has all the
edginess and hilarity it needs to suceed, and never comes across as cheap
or bitchy.  His direction is also extremely competent, and he proves
himself a great director of good actors, getting amazing performances from
everyone, most especially Donovan and Kudrow, the latter who proves she so
much more than the ultimate vapid actress.  Even Lyle Lovett's apparent
woodiness in acting actually works with his character, who ultimately comes
off as sweet.  But it's really Ricci's picture, and she embodies her with
so much flare that she's impossible to hate or root against, mostly thanks
to her narration, which is exactly what we want to hear when things are
happening in this film even if they aren't always the human.  And weirdly
enough, the best thing about this film is that it does eventually allow
humanity to seep in without corrupting its integrity.</P>
