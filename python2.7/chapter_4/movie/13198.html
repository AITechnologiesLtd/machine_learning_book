<PRE>WILDE (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Brian Gilbert
Writer: Julian Mitchell (based on the book by Richard Ellmann)
Starring: Stephen Fry, Jude Law, Michael Sheen, Jennifer Ehle, Tom
Wilkinson, Vanessa Redgrave, Gemma Jones, Judy Parfitt, Zoë Wanamaker, Ioan
Gruffudd, Matthew Mills</P>
<P>I think that the greatness of a person can be judged in how much of a
bullshit artist they are, the least being more commendable.  In that
respect, playwright/philosopher/world's most famous bisexual Oscar Wilde is
definitely one of history's most commendable presences, right up there with
Thomas More as people who stayed completely true to who they were, no
matter what the consequences...and of course, there were consequences. 
This is just one of two things that the biopic on his life, "Wilde" is
trying to say, the other being that no matter what the time period, a man
like Oscar Wilde cannot exist on the world for a wide variety of reasons.</P>
<P>The film chronicles the latter years of his life, starting in 1882 during
his one year trip to America, and then showing him in the prime of his
life, when he wrote his only novel, "The Picture of Dorian Gray," and
numerous plays, such as "Lady Windermere's Fan" and "The Importance of
Being Earnest."  But unlike most authors and playwrights, Wilde was as
dynamic and witty as the plays he wrote.  As played to total perfection by
Stephen Fry, a big fan of Wilde's work, Oscar is probably the most charming
man to ever walk the earth, as well as the greatest conversationalist, at
least of his time.  He can charm anyone, even the most ignorant brutes, and
has the ability to shoot out intelligent, aphoritic one-liners on cue, such
as "It's appalling what people do in front of works of art," and "Alcohol,
taken in large quantities, can bring about all the effects of drunkeness"
(I'm paraphrasing here).</P>
<P>What some encyclopedias and various history books leave out, though, is
that Oscar was one of the very first widely known open homosexuals.  The
film shows what may be his fictitious epiphany when a visitor to his house,
Robbie Ross (Michael Sheen), seduces Oscar once his wife, Constance
(Jennifer Ehle), is asleep, and ends up carrying on a short-lived affair
with him.  After a couple other suitors, Oscar falls deeply in love with
Lord Alfred "Bosie" Douglas (Jude Law, the bitter, scene-stealing cripple
from "Gattaca"), an incredibly selfish, sometimes ill-tempered young man
who captures Oscar's heart because: a) he thinks he's so beautiful that
he's a work of art, and Oscar is obsessed with beauty in art; and b)
because he generally feels bad for what a hard life he's had so far.</P>
<P>The film plays two ways: as a literal lifeline of Oscar's life, showing his
plays being written, and depicting his tragic downfall; and as every biopic
should be told, as a parable for our own lives.  Every great biopic finds
some way of connecting the people they glamorize to our own lives, and the
film views Oscar as the thing we all should be, and the thing we can never
be.  His life, at least the better part of it, is a wonderful dream, where
we discover who we really are, and instead of doing things we never want to
do, we be what we think we are.  Oscar discovered who he was in the middle
of his life, and from that point on, decided to live life to the fullest.</P>
<P>But the film depicts the reason why this is a fantasy-like fallacy, showing
Oscar as one of the world's great selfish people.  Characters pop up from
time to time, are given a lot of attention, and then disappear for long
amounts of time, reappearing for a brief scene of two, then disappearing
again.  Characters like his patient wife, who has had two kids with him,
and wishes him to come home, hardly sees him, and the movie sometimes seems
to forget her.  The same goes for Robbie Ross, who, despite knowing that he
was merely the man who opened up Oscar to homosexuality, remains totally
loyal to him, and tries to help in the later years of his life.</P>
<P>Despite a few shortcomings, "Wilde" is a magnificently film, filled with a
sometimes sensual feeling, and filled with the same way of looking at
history as "A Man for All Seasons" did.  The sets and costumes are
beautifully lavish, the cinematography is utterly gorgeous, and even the
numerous gay love scenes are tastefully handled, never seeming a bit like
pornography.  And we see a wonderful, loving portrait of Oscar Wilde, who's
own time was not kind to him, but who's seen that history has seen him as
almost a martyr for true self identity.  Yes, you can easily point out that
the way he lived was selfish, and that his downfall was not really Bosie's
fault but really his, but you can't deny that you wish that you could
discover yourself like Oscar did, and have the courage to act on it.  This
is why Oscar Wilde is viewed so favorly in history, and why someone lke
Bosie, who was a homosexual more out of revenge against his tyrannical
father (Tom Wilkinson from "The Full Monty") and society as well, is viewed
as merely "at one time the object of Oscar Wilde's affections."</P>
<P>One more final note, actually more of a redundant note, in all actuality,
should be made towards Stephen Fry, who plays Oscar Wilde (I can't believe
that I almost forgot to praise him more).  Fry's performance is probably
the most natural and dead-on performance I have seen in a very long time,
and I'm starting the campaign now to get him nominated for an Oscar. 
Folks, you will probably not see a better performance this year by an
actor, because, for all intensive purposes, Stephen Fry IS Oscar Wilde, and
every time I read Wilde's literature or hear one of his hilarious
aphorisms, I will hear the voice of Fry.  That is all.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
