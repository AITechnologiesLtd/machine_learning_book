<PRE>                              SCENES FROM A MALL
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     SCENES FROM A MALL is the new Paul Mazursky film starring Woody
Allen, Bette Midler, and the Beverly Center shopping mall.  Paul Irwin,
the "new vaudevillean," appears as the mimic.</P>
<P>     It's an incongruous casting idea putting Woody Allen, the ultimate
New Yorker, in a Southern California mall with Bette Midler, who may
just be the last word in ditzy rich California.  If it had worked, it
would have been brilliant; it didn't and it ain't.  All that is left to
us the audience is assigning the blame.</P>
<P>     First off, there's Mazursky, who when he's good is very, very good.
However, he seems constitutionally incapable of making two good movies
in a row.  Now, he's done nothing quite as wonderful as his early NEXT
EXIT GREENWICH VILLAGE, but his last Beverly Hills movie, the name of
which escapes me just now, had a wonderful zany chaos about it, a kind
of kitchy UP STAIRS, DOWN STAIRS, that approached at least the lost art
of the screwball comedy.  SCENES, on the other hand, instead of opening
up Beverly Hills to satire and humanization, traps us in its own
self-referential claustrophobia.  Several times, Nick and Deborah, the
major characters, almost succeed in breaking out of the mall, only to be
dragged back in by some circumstance or other.  Their failure to leave
is the movie's failure, too.</P>
<P>     Then, there's Woody Allen looking and sounding as natural and
naturalized as a Martian at a Ku Klux Klan rally.  He's got a
preposterous tuck of hair gathered in a teeny tiny ponytail.  That's the
signal that he's a real California sports agent/lawyer.  Allen is too
familiar to us to be anything but Woody Allen, and no one who knows
Allen thinks that he would ever be a Californian.  Neither is there
anything in his performance that in any way makes it possible for us to
make the leap of faith to enable us to forget ANNIE HALL and a lifetime
of slamming L.A.</P>
<P>     Finally, there's Midler, fussy and over-upholstered as usual, but
totally unable to convince us that she is a licensed psychologist and
successful self-help author.  She's not the Beverly Hills princess she
was in her previous B.H. films -- the one with Nick Nolte and company
[DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS] or the one with Danny DeVito [RUTHLESS
PEOPLE].  Neither is the vulgarian with the heart of gold that she's
played opposite Shelley Long [OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE] or in BEACHES.  What
is she, who is she, how does she succeed either professionally or
personally?  She hasn't a clue how the play Deborah and we haven't a
clue how to read her.</P>
<P>     If this is satire, it is a cold, uncaring kind.  If it is a tribute
to SoCal culture, it misses altogether.  I think of SCENES and then of
L.A. STORY as the portrait of Lotus Land.  Steve Martin's got this movie
beat all hollow because there is love behind his movie.  There is
nothing behind Mazursky's.</P>
<P>     I can recommend this film only to those fans who have to see
everything with Allen and/or Midler in it.  The rest of us would be
better off shopping.</P>
