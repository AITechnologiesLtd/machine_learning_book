<P>Popular FOX TV series makes its big screen debut helmed by a veteran
director of at least 25 of the small screen episodes, Rob Bowman. The
paranormal vibes. During this year's last episode, the X-Files were
shut down by the FBI. That's pretty much all the intro you need to know
before you see this film.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A bomb blows off a big chunk of a federal building in Dallas, Texas. As
Mulder and Scully step up their investigation into the bombing, they
begin to uncover many zany theories and cover-ups about the puzzling
explosion. While delving further into the case, the defiant duo find
themselves trapped in an international game of intrigue, mystery and
extra-terrestrial politics.</P>
<P>***Understand that my critique comes from a solid streak of experience
with the show. Having said that, an inexperienced viewer can also enjoy
this critique, since you need not have seen one episode of the TV
series, to truly appreciate this well-developed movie***</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Mysterious, moody, exciting at parts, this movie succeeds in bringing
the spookiness and interest of the television series to the big screen.
Having said that, the film did at times feel like one big television
episode, with a larger plot line and greater special effects. Also, it
did seem to go on for a tad too long. </P>
<P>The plot of the film is interesting, the characters are believable, and
the action is exciting and scary at times (The scenes with the aliens
are very cool and exciting). Mulder and Scully have no discernible
problems tackling the big screen, while adding words like "shit" to
their vocabulary. While the suspicions about their possible romantic
entanglement in this film are also answered, they certainly will not be
given away by JoBlo here. Also, there did seem to be a touch more
humour on the big-screen than the show, which helped many long-winded
and jargon-filled scenes move along at an easier pace. The creators of
the film also took the time to "piss" all over the greatest box-office
science-fiction success from 1996, INDEPENDENCE DAY (6.5/10), in a most
interesting and "subtle" way.</P>
<P>Overall, the movie worked for me as a thriller and a science-fiction
fable, but somehow seemed to run a little too long, and lacked the
earth-shattering ending that I was expecting. Having said that, they
have now added many new elements to explore in the TV series, which
will most certainly pick up many new viewers after this slick film.
Warm up your nachos and cuddle up with your love-bunny on this one,
folks...it's gonna be a bumpy ride!</P>
