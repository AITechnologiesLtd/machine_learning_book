Susan Granger's review of "PERMANENT MIDNIGHT" (Artisan Entertainment)</P>
<P>         There are two primary pitfalls in making movies about drug
addiction. First: the subject matter has already been covered,
beginning in the '50s with "The Man With the Golden Arm," so the
audience knows the protagonist will inevitably collapse. Since then,
the real-life dramas of Janis Joplin and John Belushi have already
been explored and exploited. Second: if the story proceeds through
rehabilitation, there's the challenge of not being preachy. "Clean and
Sober" (1988) is one of the few films that avoided
this. Writer/director David Veloz's "Permanent Midnight" falls into
both pitfalls - and worse - as it chronicles TV comedy writer Jerry
Stahl's real-life recovery from heroin addiction in the form of a
confessional, filled with flashbacks. Stahl was one of the writers for
"Alf" and other sit-coms. Ben Stiller, who has made a career out of
playing nice guys who are losers, plays Stahl. He's graphically shown
shooting himself up with smack, complete with blue-hued skin,
blackened eyes and drops of blood squirting onto the bathroom ceiling.
He behaves like an idiot and epitomizes decadence. Once he gets into
rehab, of course, this predictably changes. Problem is: he's miscast
and it's all very episodic and ultimately boring. British
model/actress Elizabeth Hurley appears briefly as his ambitious
wife-in-name-only, the result of a green-card marriage, as do Cheryl
Ladd, as a TV star who recognizes his problem, and Janeane Garofalo as
an inquisitive agent. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Permanent Midnight" is a sordid, junkie 3. Just say no.</P>
