<P>Very Bad Things
Directed by:  Peter Berg
Starring: Christian Slater, Cameron Diaz, Daniel Stern, Jeanne
Tripplehorn, Jon Favreau, Jeremy Piven, Leland Orser
Running time:  111 minutes
My rating (5 star scale): No stars</P>
<PRE>Very bad is very apt.</PRE>
<P>You're a young actor who wants to be a young director.  You know a
bunch of other young actors who want to be young stars.  You
haven't any real ideas, but you figure that if you put all those 
young actors in one movie, it will be just as good as having a real 
star.  And if you move the camera around a lot, it will look as if you
were a real director.  And if people shout all the time, it will look
as if you have a real script.  And if your movie is dark and everyone
in it hateful, it will look as if you are really deep.</P>
<P>I don't know how many drugs or how much liquor you have to take to 
believe all that, but somebody involved in this movie does.  Very Bad
Things is about a stag party gone bad.  A bunch of guys, middle class 
white collar type guys, head to Vegas for a stag.  They gamble, snort
coke, get drunk, and hire a stripper to entertain in their hotel room.  
Unfortunately, she ends up dead.</P>
<P>For most of us, this would be a good time to sober up, call the cops,
and pray to God they will hush it all up.  Given that Vegas is a tourist
town and dead hookers aren't a big tourist draw, the odds are in your 
favour. And the cops are likely to believe it's an accident. After all,
they have the word of a bunch of nice middle class guys and only a dead
hooker on the other side.  But these guys don't take that chance.  Even
though they are in Vegas, gambling capital of the world, they aren't
ready to roll the dice.  Instead, they start an elaborate coverup.  
And it just gets more elaborate, more complicated as things go on.</P>
<P>People start dying left and right, but apparently no one notices.  No
one investigates, and the most important event in the movie, the wedding
goes on as planned.</P>
<P>For a movie like this to work, you have to like somebody in it.  You don't
like anybody in this film.  These aren't people like you and me, these
are people like characters in a bad screenplay.  One dimensional cretins
with just enough wit to further the plot.  Not that there is much of a
plot.  Just one death after another.</P>
<P>Berg leaves no cliche unturned in his fruitless attempt to become a real
director.  The movie could have been a learning experience for him. but
I doubt it.  At the screening I attended he spoke and told us all how 
wonderful the script was and how great the film.  I got the feeling he 
felt that if the AFI had waited another year, he would have beaten out 
Citizen Kane for the number one spot on the top 100 list.</P>
<PRE>Give it a miss.</PRE>
