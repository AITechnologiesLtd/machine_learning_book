<P> Franta Louka has his hands and life full with his mother's
deteriorating house, his lack of money, and simply just trying to make
ends meet. Once a famed cellist in Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia's
philharmonic orchestra, Louka (played by Zdenek Sverak) is now forced to
play at funerals and gain extra cash by painting tombstones. Director
Jan Sverak paints a wonderful portrait of a grumpy bachelor who can't
seem to catch up on his debts. Not wanting to let his badgering mother
find out what he has been doing to keep up with the constant monetary
demands, Louka reluctantly decides to engage in some illegal activities
that end up filling his plate with much more than he can handle. Louka
ultimately finds himself in the awkward position of caring for a small
boy that he neither wants nor needs to have around. Fear of getting
himself jailed, however, forces him to keep the boy and make do with the
situation. Andrej Chalimon playes the adorable Kolja who makes the
screen sparkle with every moment that he is on it. The movie follows the
unlikely pair as they both make important realizations about themselves.
Entertaining from start to finish KOLYA is an incredible offering from
the Czech Republic.  Academy Award and Golden Globes winner for Best
Foreign Language Film.3 ½ spots (out of 4) </P>
