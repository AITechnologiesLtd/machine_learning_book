<P>Nick Cassavetes' second attempt at directing is based on a script
written by his late father, indie-actor/director John Cassavetes.
Nick's initial foray into the world of cinematic direction produced the
touching UNHOOK THE STARS (7.5/10) back in 1996, starring his mother,
Gena Rowlands.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Husband/wife Eddie (Penn) and Maureen (Wright Penn) are two poor, wild,
crazy kids in love. One day, Eddie's erratic and aggressive behaviour
goes too far. He snaps a twig in his brain, and is committed to an
institution for 10 years. When he gets out, Maureen has divorced him,
re-married another, had three kids, and resides in the suburbs. Eddie
wants her back. Joey (Travolta), Maureen's new husband, doesn't
appreciate Eddie's sentiment.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This movie was hard to rate because I really liked the first half of
the film which dealt with the life and times of the young couple in
love. Sean Penn and Robin Wright Penn put on some amazingly gritty
performances (Sean received a best actor award at the 1997 Cannes Film
Festival for his role) during this first period, and truly transport
you into their loving eyes and hearts. The rest of the movie....well...</P>
<P>Unfortunately for all involved with this picture, the second half of
the film turns into a completely unrealistic and outrageous scenario,
in which we are meant to understand things which simply do not make any
sense, and given very little support by way of the script by
Cassavetes. I especially didn't care about the way the kids were
treated in this film ("drink your beer!" to a nine-year old?).</P>
<P>Admittedly, perhaps the success of the first half, left me with a
greater disappointment with the latter half, but either way, I would
say that the ending of this movie does rate as highly unbelievable and
unsubstantiated. Having said that, the first half was very good, and so
were the performances by real-life husband and wife team, Sean and
Robin Wright. Travolta was okay, but he is only in the movie for about
20 minutes or so, and does little more than smoke and swear.
Cassavetes' follow-up to the endearing UNHOOK THE STARS seems to have
been a great vehicle for the Penns to showcase their acting talents,
but lacks the solid finale or any realistic conclusions in the second
half. </P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
This film was previously dubbed SHE'S DE LOVELY and CALL IT LOVE.
Sean Penn was married to Madonna from 1985-89. He has since been quoted
as saying "I'm very fond of my ex-wife, but at twenty-four I didn't
realize the difference between a great first date and a lifetime
commitment." 
Sean's brothers include musician Michael Penn and fellow actor Chris
Penn. Sean and brother Chris used to hang out with Martin's Sheen's
sons, Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez, throughout their junior high
and high school years, occasionally dabbling in filmmaking with their
handheld Super-8 cameras.
When Robin Wright Penn was 15, she used to date Charlie Sheen. She was
also married to fellow actor Jason Patric from 1988-90.</P>
