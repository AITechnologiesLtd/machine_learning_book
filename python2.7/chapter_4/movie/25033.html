Susan Granger's "LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST" (Miramax Films)</PRE>
<P> Having done "Henry V," "Hamlet" and "Much Ado About Nothing"
on film, Kenneth Branagh, who comes from working-class background,
continues his determination make Shakespeare more relevant to
contemporary audiences. This time, he punctuates the Bard with '30s
and '40s musical numbers. Set in Europe in 1939, just before the
outbreak of W.W.II, the romantic comedy begins when the King of
Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and three companions (Kenneth Branagh,
Matthew Lillard, Adrian Lester) swear to shun all distractions and
study for three years. But no sooner have they made their monastic
vows than the Princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and three lovely
ladies-in-waiting (Emily Mortimer, Carmen Ejogo, Natascha McElhorne)
show up, and the four flirtatious couples pair off to songs from Cole
Porter, Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, George and Ira Gershwin. The fact
that his cast has mediocre musical ability didn't deter Branagh's
enthusiasm. "It wasn't our ambition to achieve the slickness and
impossible perfection of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers," he
explains. "What we did want was abandonment to the enterprise, joy and
commitment to the songs and dancing." Indeed, singing "Cheek to Cheek"
mid-air, they float to the rafters of a library.  Branagh wavers
uncomfortably between the various styles of American musicals,
attempting to combine the crisp, formal precision of Busby Berkeley's
choreography with the more relaxed ambiance of Gene Kelly. Also, in
his ambitious attempt to condense the narrative and combine the
ensemble numbers, Branagh loses much of the comedy, except for Nathan
Lane as the clown. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Love's
Labour's Lost" is a whimsical 7, putting a frothy, new spin on old
Will.</P>
