Running time: 95 minutes. </P>
<P>If John Hughes had made a version of Pygmalion, then chances
are that it would resemble She's All That.  First time feature
director Robert Iscove takes the basic plot, updates it to an American
high school setting, and gives it a contemporary soundtrack.  Iscove,
who hails from a background in television and live theatre, gives the
familiar concept a new spin, making it fresh and relevant for younger
audiences.</P>
<P>Zack Siler (Freddie Prinze jr, from I Know What You Did Last
Summer, etc) is the most popular guy at school - a sports star,
brilliant student, and president of the student body, he seems to have
it all.  But then his long time girl friend Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn
O'Keefe, from Halloween H20) dumps him for the improbably named Brock
Hudson (Matthew Lillard, from Hackers, etc), the narcissistic and
dopey star of a tv sitcom.  Crestfallen and humiliated, Zack enters
into a bet with fellow jock Dean Sampson (Paul Walker, recently seen
in Varsity Blues) that he can transform any girl in the school into a
beauty and potential prom queen in just six weeks.</P>
<P>The chosen subject turns out to be Laney Boggs (newcomer
Rachael Leigh Cook), the elusive, uptight outcast.  Under Zack's
attention, Laney slowly blossoms into a beauty, and gains a new lease
on life.  Romance also blossoms, as the shallow Zack finds himself
drawn by Laney's combination of intelligence and good looks, hidden
beneath her usually dowdy exterior.  But the transformation is not
without its set backs, as jealousy and rivalry raise their ugly heads
as the prom night approaches.</P>
<P>The primarily youthful cast mixes fresh young faces, many of
whom have appeared in a number of recent teen slasher flicks, with a
couple of rap stars (Usher and Kimberley "Li'l Kim" Jones).  Their
performances are solid, although Prinze, Cook and a wonderfully bitchy
O'Keefe are the standouts.  Kevin Pollack (The Usual Suspects, etc)
also delivers a nicely underplayed performance as Laney's father, who
initially seems to live in a different world from his two children,
but who ultimately turns out to be sympathetic and understanding.</P>
<P>She's All That is a teen movie that doesn't always resort to
the usual clichés or stereotypes of the genre, nor does it
patronise its audience.  It's all the better for this.  There are a
few gross out moments along the way, but overall She's All That is
more entertaining than one would expect.  Somewhat surprisingly, this
film comes from successful independent studio Miramax.  Not content
with the room full of Oscars their films have earned, the Weinstein
brothers seem to be moving away from the strictly art house movies of
the past to embrace more shamelessly commercial, mainstream product.</P>
