<PRE>                               RADIO FLYER
                       A film review by Dwight Joe
                        Copyright 1992 Dwight Joe</PRE>
<PRE>     I just came back from seeing a free sneak preview of RADIO FLYER.</PRE>
<P>     The picture opens with Tom Hanks telling two kids about his life
growing up with his younger brother.  His real dad disappears early in
the picture, and in steps the "king", who turns out to be a child
abuser.  Simultaneously, the younger brother, who is the direct object
of the king's (that is the nickname conferred on the child abuser)
beatings, yearns to convert his 4-wheeled red wagon, called the "Radio
Flyer", into an airplane because he wants to fly.  Mentally, he really
yearns to fly away from the king.</P>
<P>     The only depth to this whole movie is that the kid wants to somehow
build the airplane to fly away from the king's beating.  Of course, he
doesn't really build a real airplane.  The whole action is just his
crying out to escape the pain, from which he really can't escape (at
least not until the king is thrown in jail).</P>
<P>     From the adult perspective, this was a pointless picture that
is worth about 0.5 star out of 4.</P>
<P>     The big problem with the picture is that it mixes comedic parts
with deadly serious parts.  On the one hand, we see the kids
romping around, making fools of themselves.  On the other hand,
we see major hints (like a horribly bruised back) of serious
child abuse.  These two aspects are juxtaposed inanely.  If anything,
this movie does a great disservice to the very serious issue of
child abuse--either physical or mental.  How can anyone mix
humor with child abuse?</P>
<PRE>     Two thumbs down!</PRE>
<PRE>.
