LOST SOULS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>LOST SOULS, opening on a carefully chosen Friday the Thirteenth, is 
liable to elicit strong reactions from its audiences.  The emotion 
realized, however, will likely not be what the filmmakers intended.  The 
overwhelming feeling that the film imparts is pity, not fear.  We feel 
sorry for the talented actors who perform their craft as hard as they 
can but have no hope of overcoming Pierce Gardner's uninvolving, 
unimaginative and unoriginal script and first-time director Janusz 
Kaminski's lackluster direction.   </P>
<P>The only moments of fright come from a couple of unexpected loud noises.  
You can create much scarier moments in the privacy of your own home 
simply by coming up behind someone and screaming, "Boo!"</P>
<P>LOST SOULS is a supernatural thriller that borrows so liberally from 
previous movies that you'll swear that you've seen it before.  But, no, 
you haven't since this is a new movie and not a re-release.</P>
<P>An Academy Award winning cinematographer (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), director 
Kaminski has LOST SOUL's cinematographer, Mauro Fiore, serve us some 
artsy images that look like homages to other thrillers from SEVEN to 
STIGMATA.   The truly awful STIGMATA is also the picture to which 
moviegoers will most likely compare LOST SOULS.  Personally I'd prefer 
LOST SOULS, but it's a close call.  In defense of STIGMATA, it was at 
least laughably bad.  LOST SOULS is more likely to have you just staring 
at the screen.</P>
<P>As the story opens, an older priest, Father Lareaux (John Hurt), 
accompanied by an attractive younger assistant, Maya Larkin (Winona 
Ryder), is busy behind closed doors performing an exorcism.  I know what 
you are thinking now, "Been there. Done that."  And if you want to see 
it done right, a re-release of THE EXORCIST is in the theaters now.</P>
<P>Well, the exorcism doesn't go as planned, but the exorcisee, Henry 
Birdson (John Diehl), does conveniently provide the name of the 
anti-Christ, Peter Kelson (Ben Chaplin), the best selling author of 
"Vicious Intent," a book about serial killers.  Actually, Henry puts 
Peter's name in code, but the code appears to be so simple that a third 
grader could break it.</P>
<P>Peter, of course, doesn't know that he's about to become the number one 
bad guy of all time, and, of course, Maya will risk life and limb to 
keep it from happening.  People run around saying "The time of the 
transformation is near!" like the colonists saying "The Redcoats are 
coming!"  If this transformation occurs, Peter will become the devil on 
earth just as God became man in Christ. </P>
<P>When one of the movie's tag lines -- "They've had their 2,000 years. Now 
it's our turn."  -- is finally spoken, it produces the movie's only big 
laugh, albeit an unintentional one.  The story, however, is instructive.  
We learn that if your digital clock ever reads 666, it's not a good 
sign.</P>
<P>LOST SOULS runs 1:35.  It is rated R for violence/terror and some 
language and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
