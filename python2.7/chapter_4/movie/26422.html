<PRE>                         SOLOMON AND GAENOR
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: 1911 South Wales is the setting
          for this tragic love story, a sort of Romeo and
          Juliet told in the bleak style of Thomas Hardy.
          A Jewish boy and a coal miner's daughter fall in
          love and grab some small happiness from a dreary
          environment only to be torn apart by their
          families.  Well-acted and frequently moving.
          English, Welsh, and Yiddish language.  Rating: 7
          (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The poignant setting is a misty, cold mining town in Wales,
1911.  Not unlike the setting of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF the town has
two nearby communities, one Christian, one Jewish.  In the Jewish
community the Lewinsky family is composed of pawnbrokers and cloth
merchants.  Solomon (played by Ioan) is about twenty years old,
good-looking, and enjoys his work as a "pacman"--going into the
Christian section leaving samples of cloth and taking orders for
larger pieces.  When asked, Solomon denies being Jewish, just to
escape trouble.</P>
<P>     Solomon finds himself particularly attracted to one customer, a
woman about his own age Gaenor (Nia Roberts).  As he continues to
see her, professionally and otherwise, hiding his religion.  He
takes the name Sam Livingstone.  Gaenor is from a family of poor
miners.  Her very large brother Crad (Mark Lewis Jones) immediately
takes a dislike to the stranger who he thinks is less than a man
since he does not have callused hands.  But Solomon and Gaenor are
attracted to each other and are willing to risk the consequences.</P>
<P>     The story is very much the star-crossed lover story, but if
that was all there was to this film it would be mundane indeed.
However, writer and director Paul Morrison does not make this the
film expected.  First and foremost, the two main characters are not
totally blameless in their fates.  There is enough fault in the plot
so just about everybody gets a piece.  It would be very easy to
present the Jewish community as blameless and purely the victims of
intolerance as well-meaning literature has done since IVANHOE.  The
Jews do appear more sinned against than sinning, but they are also
at fault and have their own intolerance.  Gaenor is too fast to
accelerate her relationship with Solomon, whom she hardly knows, and
then refuses to tell him when she needs his help.  Even the
countryside comes in for its share of the fault.  Instead of the
lovely pastoral scenes that usually grace this sort of film,
cinematographer Nina Kellgren's camera accents the unpleasant in the
climate and locale: the stony landscapes, the cold, the gray mist,
the fog, and the snow.  People's lives are as bleak as the
countryside.  Everything in the country seems muted blue and gray.
The only bright color is a dress that Solomon sews for Gaenor, red
the color of sin and rebellion.  Early in the film we see the Welsh
taking turns having kitchen baths, using the same dirty water.  They
sleep two in a narrow bed.  The Jewish and Christian community each
has its restrictions an intolerance of the other.  The Christian
religion appears to be as bleak and unforgiving as the landscape,
the seem a little more positive.  The Jews are given a slight edge
here as we see a meeting where they are discussing the importance of
understanding the writings of Dickens.</P>
<P>     Ioan Gruffudd as Solomon seems a little old to be acting in the
irresponsible way that his character does.  Gruffudd is best known,
to me at least, as a young Horatio Hornblower from a series of TV
movies.  Of the two, Nia Roberts as Gaenor seems the better actor.
She exhibits an odd characteristic of brightening up and being more
attractive when Solomon is around.  As tales of star-crossed lovers
frequently are, this is a story of pain and tragedy.  There is more
pain in one of Morrison's fist fights than in all of the fighting
and shooting and killing in THE MATRIX.  Ilona Sekacz's score
combines Jewish and Celtic themes, an unusual combination.</P>
<PRE>     SOLOMON AND GAENOR is a textured moody love story and quite
worth looking for.  I rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
