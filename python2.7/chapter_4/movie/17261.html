<PRE>THE CORRUPTOR (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Steve Kong

<P>I was once asked if I biased my film reviews based on the presence of a
particular performer. Definitely! My admiration of Chow Yun-Fat comes from
his collaborations with legendary action director John Woo (Hard Boiled,
The Killer, Once A Thief). And like anyone who loves the work that these
two have accomplished in Hong Kong, I await the day that these two will
pair up again to do another film together. For now, I have to live with the
above par releases of Woo sans Chow (Face/Off) and the below par releases
of Chow sans Woo (The Replacement Killers). So, I was a little disappointed
by the film The Corruptor, a Chow release without Woo at the helm. The
Corruptor is an above average cop-buddy movie that is lifted up by the
presence of Chow Yun-Fat but then dragged down by Mark Wahlberg and
director James Foley.</P>
<P>Similar to The Replacement Killers, the title of The Corruptor does not
refer to the character portrayed by Chow Yun-Fat. Nick Chen (Chow Yun-Fat)
is a detective in the NYPD Asian Gangs Unit. The AGU is run by a tight knit
group of cops, all Chinese. A bombing at a local convenience store changes
all this. A new gang in town kills a foreigner and the mayor is screaming
to have the AGU expanded. And before you can scream "buddy-film", Mark
Wahlberg (Boogie Nights) shows up.</P>
<P>Chen who is on the take from a Chinatown businessman, Lee (Ric Young),
re-evaluates his beliefs and actions when he has to take on the new
recruit, Danny Wallace (Wahlberg). When Lee tries to put Wallace on the
payroll, this tests Chen's loyalties -- as the film progresses, Wallace is
also forced to take a close look at his loyalties through a great twist in
the story.</P>
<P>The script by first-time pen Robert Pucci has enough twists in it to keep
the attention of the moviegoer looking for a film filled with double-fisted
gunfights, because the action in The Corruptor is sparse. And when the
action fires up, it is done with such MTV style shooting and editing that I
was expecting to find a complimentary airsickness bag.</P>
<P>The one thing that I despise most about the current crop of action films is
the use of the "Shaky Camera" technique. This is a technique in which the
director and cinematographer (Juan Ruiz-Anchia) decide that action is
enhanced by bouncing the camera around. Put this together with quick cuts
and razor sharp editing and what you get are action sequences that no one
can follow. If you've seen the car chase in Michael Bay's The Rock and
thought the camerawork and editing in it was horrible, wait till you see
what James Foley can do with the car chase in The Corruptor. This car chase
had me dizzy. I don't understand why directors haven't learned that the
"Shaky Camera" technique does not heighten the tension in an action scene,
but detriments it.</P>
<P>The one thing that saves The Corruptor is Chow Yun-Fat. And though Foley
does not use Chow's talents to their full potential, there is enough of
Chow in the film to make it a worthwhile screening. In every way Chow is
the epitome of coolness. Whether he has two guns in hand pumping 50 rounds
into a bad guy or just standing around talking to another cop: he is cool.
In The Replacement Killers, Chow was held back by his weak understanding of
English. In that film, his US premiere film, he was stoic and boring -- but
still cool. In The Corruptor, his English is much better -- by leaps and
bounds -- and he is freed to do what he does best: Act. In The Corruptor,
Chow is freed to show off his onscreen charm. His low-key humor shines
onscreen and that makes the film all the more better.</P>
<P>What drags down Chow is Wahlberg. Wahlberg tries to underplay his part,
playing his Wallace more like his character in Boogie Nights than a real
cop. The problem was that I never accepted Wahlberg as a cop. His
performance in The Corruptor was horrible. Wahlberg adds nothing to this
film except for some bare-chested scenes that are guaranteed to bring in
the female audience.</P>
<P>Director James Foley tries his best at putting together an action film, but
fails.  The action in The Corruptor lacks excitement and tension, it is
flat as can be. More often it's just a series of images flashed onscreen
with loud noises. Foley is able to keep the story moving, but unfortunately
he is unprepared for doing the action portion of the film.</P>
<P>I'm convinced that had two small changes been made to The Corruptor, it
would have come out a much better and more highly enjoyable film. The
changes would be the replacement of director James Foley with John Woo and
the recasting of Danny Wallace with a stronger actor than Mark Wahlberg. As
it stands, The Corruptor is still a Don't Miss film, but only because of
Chow Yun-Fat's presence in the film. See The Corruptor for Chow Yun-Fat.</P>
