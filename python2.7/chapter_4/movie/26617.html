DROP ZONE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>John Badham was never considered to be among the best
American film directors, but his work in 1990s represents
huge disappointment to those who are familiar with his
achievements in previous decades. One of the reasons for the
decline in his career is the lack of inspiration. On too
many occasions Badham tried to find that inspiration from
the past triumphs, whether other people's (like in his 1992
American remake of Besson's NIKITA) or his own (like in his
sequel to STAKEOUT one year later). In 1994 he probably
remembered his past success with BLUE THUNDER, one of the
best action films of 1980s, and thought that the success had
something to do with spectacular helicopter stunts. The
result was DROP ZONE, action film that dealt with another
kind of flying objects.</P>
<P>The protagonist of this film is U.S. Marshall Pete Nessip
(played by Wesley Snipes). Federal prisoner and former
computer wizard Earl Leedy (played by Kevin Jeter) is to be
transferred by commercial flight, and Nessip and his brother
and partner Terry (played by Malcolm Jamal-Warner) escort
him. Routine task gets turns into nightmare when the plane
gets taken by the group of hijackers, led by Ty Moncrief
(played by Gary Busey). They snatch Leedy from Nessip's
hand, blow a hole in plane and jump out with parachutes
leaving Nessip's brother dead. Nessip is blamed for the
disaster, disgraced and suspended, but he decides to pursue
his own private investigation, although everyone tells him
that nobody could survive skydiving from such altitude and
with such speed. The trail leads him to Florida skydiving
circles, so he enrols in skydiving school led by tough
instructor Jessie Crossman (played by Yancy Butler). In the
meantime, Ty Moncrief plans to parachute himself and his
gang on the top of DEA headquarters, use Leedy's hacking
abilities to penetrate computer databases, gather top secret
data about informants and undercover agents and sell them to
top drug dealers afterwards. The raid is about to take place
on July 4th, where the airspace over Washington D.C. is open
for the annual skydiving event, which is going to be
attended by Crossman and Nessip.</P>
<P>Badham still knows how to shoot action films, judging by the
series of spectacular scenes in this film, as well as the
way he handles skydiving stunts. Some of those stunts with a
passage of time get somewhat monotonous (at least for those
who aren't enthusiastic about extreme sports), but the pace
of the film is rapid. Unfortunately, even with plenty of
"cool" scenes and fast tempo, audience still has time to
notice gaping plot holes, preposterous premise and series of
implausabilities in the screenplay by John Bishop and Peter
Barscochini. Many of them (two brothers working as partners
in federal agency, parachute landings in the middle of town
being mistaken for covert action etc.) seem to insult
viewer's intelligence. The actors also seem discouraged by
the lack of plot or credible characters, so their
performance is either bellow expectations (Wesley Snipes in
many instances hyperventilates), uninspired (like in the
case of Yancy Butler) or routine (Gary Busey again playing
his trademark blonde psychopath). Although some elements of
the film make it barely watchable, DROP ZONE in many ways is
quite suitable title for the movie that deserved to bomb.</P>
