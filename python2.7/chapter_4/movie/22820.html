<PRE>BRINGING OUT THE DEAD (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>>From a novel by Joe Connelly.
Director: Martin Scorsese
With: Nicholas Cage, Patricia Arquette, John Goodman, Ving Rhames, Tom
Sizemore</PRE>
<P>Nicholas Cage is Frank Pierce, an ambulance driver in a rough area of New
York City. We follow him during three nights at work. For five years he has
been an ambulance driver, working the night shift, and it is starting to
get to him. Every night he sees the worst of human suffering and
depredation, trying to save the lives of assorted slum-dwellers,
drug-addicts and victims of gang-shootings. Professional detachment is
getting harder and harder to maintain. What makes the job worthwile is the
feeling he gets after saving a life. It makes him feel like God. But now,
he hasn't saved anyone in months, and he's getting to the point where he
tries to avoid calls, so he won't have to face losing another patient. He
is also haunted by the memory of one particular girl that he couldn't save,
and has started to see her face in people around him. A nervous breakdown
seems imminent, and Frank knows it, but he can't seem to get away from the
job. </P>
<P>Onto the scene comes Mary Burke (Patricia Arquette), whose father is being
kept artificially alive in hospital after being initially kept alive by
Frank. Frank is attracted to her, but he is also troubled as to her father,
who goes into cardiac arrest several times a day - is it right to keep him
artificially alive? </P>
<P>Every night he is partnered with a different co-worker (John Goodman, Ving
Rhames and Tom Sizemore). They can tell he is on the edge, but they
themselves range from the wildly eccentric to the barking mad. If only he
could save a life again, maybe the ghosts would go away...</P>
<P>The New York of this movie is a bleak place. The streets are lined with
prostitutes and homeless people, the buildings are sometimes practically
ruins and the hospital is overcrowded, underequipped and understaffed. The
gloom is not alleviated by the fact that practically all the scenes take
place at night. It is not a pleasant movie to watch. But, of course, it's
not supposed to be. Nicholas Cage is well suited for the part of the
burnt-out ambulance driver. He is good at displaying Frank's caring for his
patients, and at the same time his general exhaustedness. Other members of
the cast are also good, special mention goes to Cliff Curtis in the role of
a super-cool drug-dealer. </P>
<P>A possible minus about the film is a certain lack of purpose - there is not
really a clear cut storyline, the whole thing comes across more like a
series of snapshots. Obviously this could be a completely valid way of
making a film - not all films need clear cut storylines - but I think this
films ends up as something a bit undecided. There is a storyline in there,
among all the snapshots, but it can be difficult to see among all the other
things that are going on, and so it can be difficult to find out what
exactly the movie wants to bring across. All in all though, I would say the
end-result is quite good. It is certainly difficult to remain unaffected -
and that is always a good sign in a film.</P>
<P>Who should see this film: People who want to see a good film, and are
prepared not to come out of the cinema smiling. Europeans who want
confirmation of their belief that the USA is, socially, a third-world
country.</P>
<PRE>My verdict: 4+ (out of 6)</PRE>
