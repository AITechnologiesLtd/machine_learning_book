<P> Buffalo 66 (1998) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Vincent Gallo, Christina
Ricci, Ben Gazarra and Anjelica Huston</P>
<P> Buffalo 66 is a very odd movie. It features a hero who for nearly 99
percent of the movie seems to be totally alienated and a rather unpleasant
guy.</P>
<P> Yet in some kind of strange way, Buffalo 66 turns out to be a charming
little love story about two people who find themselves alone in the world.</P>
<P> Buffalo 66 is different. It's not your mainstream linear type of story as
it makes some curious detours from the focal plot then casually goes back
to its story.</P>
<P> The movie is the singular vision of Vincent Gallo, who not only stars, but
directed, wrote and composed the score for Buffalo 66.</P>
<P> Gallo plays Billy Brown, released from prison after serving five years for
another man's crime. He served the time to pay a $10,000 debt he owed a
bookie on a football game lost by the Buffalo Bills because the team's
kicker missed a crucial field goal.</P>
<P> Upon his release Billy only seeks three things: the first, and most
important, is a place to go to the bathroom. The second is the respect of
his parents, who believe Billy works for the government and has been away
on an overseas assignment. The third is revenge; he wants to kill the place
kicker who missed the field goal, thus ruining his life.</P>
<P> After a few comic attempts to find a place to relieve himself, Billy winds
up at a tap dance school where he kidnaps Layla (Christina Ricci), a blond,
Barbie-doll-like cutie who doesn't offer much resistance.</P>
<P> Billy explains that he needs her to act as his wife since his parents
believe he is married. He renames her Wendy and they proceed to visit
Billy's parents.</P>
<P> The family is from dysfunctional hell. Dad (Ben Gazarra) hardly speaks,
spending most of his time glowering at either his wife or Billy. Mom
(Anjelica Huston) is a rabid Bills fan who complains that the only game she
ever missed was on the day she gave birth to Billy.</P>
<P> But Billy's parents, while virtually ignoring him, fall madly in love with
Layla/Wendy, who tries to build Billy up in their eyes, all to no avail.
She even tells them she's pregnant.</P>
<P> Ricci is a sweet innocent as Layla. She seems to immediately have fallen
in love with Billy; how or why is not explained. We need to take it on
faith.</P>
<P> After all, Gallo's story is sort of a dark, urban fairy tale, and his
Billy is a scruffy, demanding and overbearing prince.</P>
<P> Gallo's Billy is filled with self-loathing. He won't let Layla touch him.
He bosses her around like a boot camp drill sergeant, and yet she accepts
all the abuse without much complaint.</P>
<P> The story's suspense hinges on whether Billy will carry through with his
revenge or will Layla's love soften his resolve.</P>
<P> Gallo has created a rather eccentric movie. It will require patience to
sit through this enterprise, but it will be worth the effort.</P>
<P> The film features fine performances throughout, from Gazzara and Huston,
Gallo and especially Ricci. At one point in the story, she does a little
tap dance at a bowling alley. Why? Who knows? It's really not important.</P>
<P> But this fine young actress has seen her reputation soar during the past
year as she has taken up some demanding and interesting roles in both
studio works (The Ice Storm) and independent features such as Buffalo 66.</P>
<P> If you're looking for something different, a movie that will challenge
you, then try Buffalo 66. It may surprise you.</P>
