<PRE>***1/2 out of *****</PRE>
<P>Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are at it again.  Their
grumpy old men shtick, which was at its best in the
film GRUMPY OLD MEN, gets another go round, this time
with writer Neil Simon in THE ODD COUPLE 2.  It's the
sequel to THE ODD COUPLE, which started the whole 
grumpy old men thing.</P>
<P>Seventeen years after Oscar Madison (Matthau) has moved
to Sarasota, Florida, nothing has changed.  He's still
a unreformable slob of a sports writer who plays poker
for stakes of 30 cents with a group of old women.  At
one of these games, he gets a phone call from his son,
Brucey. (Jonathan Silverman)  Brucey has great news:
he's getting married.  Then he tells his dad to whom:
Hannah Ungar, daughter of Oscar's old roommate, 
ultra neat freak Felix Ungar. (Lemmon)  Time hasn't
changed Felix either.  He's still, in Oscar's words,
"a human vacuum cleaner."  The two reunite at the 
airport out in California to go their childrens'
wedding which is in "San something"--they can't
remember the last part.  From there, the rest of the
film is basically a road buddy movie, that depicts
the various misadventures the pair gets themselves 
into.</P>
<P>A great plot?  No.  Are there plot holes?  Yes.
Do some jokes fall flat?  Yes.  But is it funny the 
great majority of the time?  Undoubtedly.  Neil Simon 
shows he still has the touch, not as powerful as it once
was, perhaps, but it's still there.  Lemmon and 
Matthau display their always great chemistry as 
the churn out Simon's frequently funny one-liners
at one another.   The situations themselves are 
amusing.  The dance with two biker chicks and the
next morning they get taken hostage by the womens'
angry boyfriends.  They get dusted by pesticides,
arrested for hauling illegal immigrants, their
car rolls down a hill and explodes, and the list
goes on.  </P>
<P>The movie's funniest moment comes when they hitch
a ride with an old geezer in his antique car.
They drive very slowly.  So slowly, in fact, that
they are soon being passed by everything imaginable.
It's hilarious to watch as the car gets passed by things
whose speeds get progressively slower.  Then the
old man dies, leading to yet another great scene where
his toupee blows off and Oscar has to retrieve it.</P>
<P>Many people have raised the cry of "enough is enough" with
regards to Lemmon and Matthau.  I say, if it's done well,
bring it on!  And this film is done well.</P>
<P>THE ODD COUPLE 2 is a light, funny, inoffensive comedy
with great stars and a great writer.  It certainly won't
win any awards or go down in history as one of the 
great comedies of all time, but it is still a good, fun
way to spend an afternoon or evening.</P>
