<P>Set over a 24-hour period in 1978, "Detroit Rock City," directed by 
first-timer Adam Rifkin, is nothing much more than an ode to the hard 
rock/heavy-metal music scene, particularly the band, KISS, fans of which this 
loud, lewd, and crude comedy was made exclusively for. You do not, however, 
have to like them in order to enjoy the film, as proven by myself. Watching 
the film, I was entertained for the most part, even though it was obvious 
where the story was going every step of the way, but once it was over, the 
nagging question on my mind, as well as probably everyone else's, was, "What 
exactly was the point?" </P>
<P>The movie doesn't take any time to get started, nor does it ever stop until 
the end credits begin, as we follow four stoner teenage boys who are 
determined to acquire tickets to the highly-publicized KISS concert in 
Detroit, Michigan, no matter what. Comprising an amateur metal band of their 
own, the members that make up KISS are their ultimate role models, and seeing 
them perform live has been something they have been attempting to do for 
three years straight. Once in Detroit, the film breaks off to follow each of 
the four protagonists on their own wild and wacky adventures. After Jam's 
(Sam Huntington) religious, chain-smoking mother (Lin Shaye) catches him with 
KISS tickets (whom she has dubbed the "Knights In Satan's Service"), she 
quickly dispatches of them and takes him to a boarding school. When Jam's 
three friends break him out of the joint and make it to the titled city, 
Jam's mother, there to protest the concert with other outraged parents, sees 
her son in the crowd and forces him to go to church and make a confession. 
While in there, a girl from school (Melanie Lynskey) who has had a long-time 
crush on him and is about the move away with her parents, runs into him and 
they have a quick tryst within the confessional. The leader of the group, 
Hawk (Edward Furlong), doesn't have enough money to pay the scalper, so he 
enters a strip contest at the local bar, and inadvertently catches the eyes 
of a voluptuous older woman (Shannon Tweed). Trip (James DeBello) attempts to 
steal some tickets off of a young kid at a convenience store, and gets into 
big trouble when he finds the child is with his much, much bigger older 
brother. And Lex (Giuseppe Andrews) must save Christine (Natasha Lyonne), a 
teenage disco diva who is being held hostage by a pair of car thieves.</P>
<P>"Detroit Rock City" has enough extra energy for several movies, and with a 
constant fast pace and 94-minute running time, doesn't overstay its welcome. 
Slight, stupid, and sparingly sweet in a few spots, the film fails, in part, 
due to the characters themselves. All of the subplots that are developed 
throughout are instantly dropped once the foursome inevitably make it inside 
the concert, watch KISS perform one song, and...well, that's it. The end 
credits blaze across the scene so quickly that it not only leaves you feeling 
unsatisfied, but also clueless as to why some of the up-and-coming actors 
even appeared in the movie, only to be wasted. </P>
<P>The performances of the four main characters are servicable enough, but are 
no match for the colorful supporting players, all of which give it their 
valiant best, even when they have nothing to do. After making a splash in 
Woody Allen's magical 1996 musical, "Everyone Says I Love You," Natasha 
Lyonne has mostly been placed in small secondary roles (also see 
"Krippendorf's Tribe" and "American Pie") that do not give this big talent 
nearly enough to do. As the disco-loving Christine, Lyonne garners one of the 
film's biggest laughs but disappears for almost the rest of the film, only to 
make a brief appearance towards the end that has no payoff. Also a standout 
is Lin Shaye, as Jam's strict mother. Shaye not only has the most fun in her 
somewhat juicy comic role, but is also downright hysterically funny, and has 
a concluding scene that is even a little touching. Shaye, notable mostly for 
her standout role in "There's Something About Mary," is quickly becoming one 
of the queens of the "supporting roles," right up there with Janeane Garofalo 
and Parker Posey. And Melanie Lynskey, as the girl who pines for Jam from 
afar, momentarily brings some unexpected warmth to her scenes, but like the 
rest of the minor characters, leaves the proceedings too soon.</P>
<P>With one of the best film soundtracks to come along in some time (right up 
there with "Dick" and "Summer of Sam"), the '70s music keeps the movie 
energetic and lively, with a few original, lesser-known song choices. 
Additionally, the outstanding costume designs and set decoration capture the 
period flavor extremely well, and the lively cinematography, by John R. 
Leonetti, often feels like you are watching a prolonged MTV advertisement. 
"Detroit Rock City" is a passable time-waster, but shouldn't director Rifkin 
have aimed just a little bit higher in the substance department, so that the 
movie wouldn't be totally devoid of a reason for being? Coming at a time when 
"American Pie" has already depicted four boys losing their virginity at the 
same time, and "Forces of Nature" involved a comic scene in a strip joint, 
most of the movie feels just plain outdated, even for being set over two 
decades ago. A nice, respective try, but "Detroit Rock City" just misses the 
mark.</P>
