<P> I've got a thing about horror movies… I hate 'em.  Almost every horror film
put in front of me comes off with a review filled with complete disgust at
its plotless nature and its annoying dialogue.  Even more than horror films,
however, I hate movies about the end of the world.  Imagine my surprise when
Stigmata was neither.</P>
<P> Although horror is the closest place to put Stigmata, it actually lies in
the category of religious drama.  Thankfully, the film has nothing to do
with the end of the world.  What it has to do with is the end of the
Catholic Church via a gospel according to Christ that is delivered in the
form of a possessed Frankie Paige (Arquette).</P>
<P> It has all of the elements required of a film to appeal to the mainstream:
suspense,  a cool soundtrack, a good-looking actress and an actor that your
date will think is sweet because of the Irish accent.  Yet something lurks
beyond this.  Something is hidden in the folds of what appears on the
surface to be a complete idiocy of a mainstream film.</P>
<P> The film features, although laying it on thick at numerous times, an
anti-Catholic church political agenda.  It spends half of its time scaring
most of us with a mystery and a few Exorcist rip offs, and the rest of the
time involving us with a conspiracy concerning the covering up of the Christ
Gospel (as the movie calls it).</P>
<P> Luckily, the people to whom which this will hit too close to home will
probably not be found in a movie theatre for a film already declared a
sacrilege.  As many Lenny Bruce-esque jokes as I could prattle off in the
next few paragraphs, I will refrain from doing so for the fact that, at
least in this case, I do not want to offend anyone.</P>
<P> The film has an incredibly dark and stylish feel to it, befitting of the
better half of MTV directors who made the transition to film.  A sad
offshoot of this industrial feel is that they felt the need to pick
Pittsburgh as their locale -- a city which no rickety subways that is in
general about as dark as Mickey Mouse (although, to its credit, it is highly
industrial).  Glossy effects are used, but not overused.  A techno
soundtrack and a heavy percussion score marks the film's suspenseful half
while allowing just enough time for our brains to contemplate what is
happening.</P>
<P> One of the things that is scary as a society came in an ad-libbed review a
friend gave me of The Blair Witch Project: "It made you think, and that was
scary."  Although this was highly ambiguous as to whether the fact that you
thought during a horror film was scary or the thoughts you were having were
scary, Stigmata barks up the same tree.  It makes you think.  The thoughts
you think are downright terrifying, the distrusts in Catholicism are as vast
and as paranoid as anything Chris Carter thought up for "The X-Files."  At
the same time, however, Stigmata leaves you in such a way as to examine the
role of God and faith and the church in life, a subject too many of us spend
too little time thinking on.</P>
<P> With this final couplet I end my review,</P>
<P> It's sad when Hollywood's more pious than you.</P>
