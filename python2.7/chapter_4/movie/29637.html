<PRE>"Jeepers... Creepers... Where'd you get those
peepers?"</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Justin Long, Gina Philips. Directed by Victor
Salva. Rated R.</PRE>
<P>Jeepers Creepers is a functional, crafty, genuinely
scary little chiller that delivers exactly what it
promises and more. There's nothing extraordinary about
it - except, perhaps, the ending; more on that later -
but it's a masterpiece of utilitarian effectiveness.
My friends tell me that copious amounts of movies have
desensitized me to the thrills of a good horror flick;
it's saying something, then, that during Jeepers
Creepers I had to look at the people around me and
remind myself that it's only a movie.</P>
<P>Horror movie characters are almost invariably "hip"
now, flouting the clichés of the genre while at the
same time bowing to them. So I was pleasantly
surprised to see one that - with the exception of a
single, inconsequential line of dialogue - plays it
completely straight. It begins with Trish and Darry, a
brother and sister - the lack of a token "romance" is
also refreshing - driving on a deserted rural road.
Their bickering is interrupted when they are hassled
by an old farm truck that pulls up behind hen, bumps
them, swerves, honks, and finally runs their car off
the road and into a field. They dust themselves off,
recover, mutter something to the effect of "crazy
asshole" to themselves and continue on their way.</P>
<P>A few minutes later, they pass an abandoned church.
The menacing truck is parked nearby, and a
shady-looking man is throwing elongated objects
wrapped in red-stained sheets down a pipe. Rattled,
they pull over a couple of miles down the road. After
deliberation, they decide to go to the nearest police
station, alert the authorities and be on their way.</P>
<P>Well, that would have been the smart thing to do, at
least. But then we wouldn't have a movie, would we?
Actually, they decide to go back and investigate, with
the hopes of helping anyone who is still alive. And
though this action is undoubtedly stupid, Darry's
childlike curiosity is almost believable, like a
preteen's fascination with the hospital morgue or the
graveyard. What they find matches both of those
descriptions, and before long they are chased by that
same old farm truck, the driver's identity remaining a
secret until they get a mysterious phone call from a
psychic who tells them that once it has their scent,
it won't chase them to the end of the earth and back.</P>
<P>Though Jeepers Creepers does not occupy a respected
genre, it is charged, masterful filmmaking. It cuts
through the crap associated with teen horror films -
pop-culture-filled dialogue, corny in-jokes, love
triangles - and gives us what we want: white-knuckle
suspense, good jolts, serviceable acting and a villain
who is actually scary. Even the title, which seems at
first like the creation of a mildly retarded
publicist, has a logical and frightening relevance to
the plot.</P>
<P>Justin Long and Gina Phillips are competent in the
lead roles, which is all that the plot requires. We
sympathize: they're frightened and so are we. The
opening sequence, the only part of the film that can
be described as "low-key" also establishes their
characters as likeable, which is a plus because it
ensures that we won't be cheering for them to be
eaten.</P>
<P>Then there's the ending, which is as abrupt as it is
surprising. I'll say nothing more about it, except to
mention that though others in the theater were
shouting "That's it?!" I found it more satisfying than
any number of conventional dispatchings of the villain
that you always see in monster movies. I expected
another fade-in, and had to sit there and blink for a
while when the credits unexpectedly began to roll.
That sort of incredulous shock is what Jeepers
Creepers is all about. </P>
