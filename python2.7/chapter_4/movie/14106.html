Review:        Why Do Fools Fall In Love</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox, Lela Rochon
                Larenz Tate, Little Richard</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:        Gregory Nava</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>It's interesting that the credits of Why Do Fools Fall In Love show that
it was written by Frankie Lymon and Morris Levy, because that's what the
movie is all about.  Following Frankie Lymon's death, the song once again
becomes a hit and each of Frankie's  three widows decide to see Morris
Levy for the widow's share of the royalties.  </P>
<P>They go to court where the story unfolds as each one states her case for
Judge Lambrey, played perfectly by Pamela Reed.  Just as you are really
getting into Zola's story [Halle Berry], you are interrupted by Elizabeth
[Vivica A. Fox].  At first, you resent her, but then, you start seeing her
side of the story.  The same goes for Emira [Lela Rochon].  It seems that
Frankie was a different person with each wife.  Who was Frankie, really? 
It is interesting to see his biography unfold.  It points out the racial
barriers that minorities encountered.  In those days their audiences were
totally Caucasian.   It is probably a concept that today's teens can't
comprehend.</P>
<P>Some of the best moments in the film include Little Richard.  He is
hysterical when testifying in court and he makes some very valid
statements on the treatment of performers by producers.  In flashback
scenes the young Little Richard [Miguel A. Nunez, Jr.] is a perfect
replica. </P>
<P>The music that is featured will get to everyone.  From Tutti-Fruitti  to
California Dreamin.  Even if the movie weren't as great as it is, you'd
get your money's worth from the soundtrack alone.</P>
<P>It is definitely one of the better pictures of the year.  Everything
about it is good: plot, direction, script, acting, score, costumes, sets,
etc.  The different sets of Zola's house overlooking Los Angeles will stay
in your mind.</P>
<P>I won't tell you how the judge rules, but I will add that I wondered
about Herman Santiago.  He is the one who originally wrote the title song
with Frankie.  His name was on the original record.  In searching the
Internet, I found that he, and another of the performers, did file suit. 
However, their claim was denied because they waited too long, after
turning 21, to file their claim.  It doesn't seem fair.</P>
<P>I definitely want to see this again, if not in a theater, I'll probably
buy the video.
It gets an A- in my books.</P>
<PRE>SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES. </PRE>
