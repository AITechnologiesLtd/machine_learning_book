<PRE>DRIVE ME CRAZY (M).  
(Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: John Schultz
Stars: Melissa Joan Hart, Adrian Grenier, William Converse-Roberts, 
Stephen Collins
Running time: 91 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Occasionally an adolescent romantic comedy will unexpectedly
break out of the mould and cleverly subvert the formula (Clueless,
Election, etc).  Drive Me Crazy, on the other hand, steers an
unadventurous course through a succession of clichés that will be
immediately obvious to audiences who sat through last year's
procession of bland, formulaic teen comedies.  Drive Me Crazy shares
numerous thematic and plot similarities with films such as She's All
That, 10 Things I Hate About You and even Never Been Kissed.</P>
<P>While tracing the tricky path of adolescent love, Drive Me
Crazy also explores the bitchy politics of high school.  Drive Me
Crazy offers up yet another exploration of the hierarchy of high
school, from the jocks to the geeks, the elite in-crowd to the
outcasts who desperately want to be accepted, from the cool to the
uncool.  There is also plenty of jealous plotting and subterfuge that
inevitably comes to a head during the climactic school dance.  This
clueless comedy has been written by Rob Thomas, one of the writers on
popular teen soap Dawson's Creek, but it is rather superficial stuff
that lacks any real insight or freshness.</P>
<P>Nicole (played with some charm but a lack of real charisma by
Melissa Joan Hart, better known as TV's teenage witch Sabrina) and
Chase (Adrian Grenier) have lived next door to each other all their
lives, but their childhood friendship has cooled.  When Nicole tries
to make Brad, the hunky but vapid school basketball champ, jealous,
she enlists Chase's help.  She pretends that she and Chase are an
item.  Chase is initially willing to go along with the scheme because
he has just been dumped by his shrewish girl friend, and hopes to make
her jealous as well.  Nicole gives Chase a make over and introduces
him into the school's elite, which gradually alienates him from his
friends.</P>
<P>But sparks fly, and the pair discover that there is a
chemistry between them, which leads to further complications.  Drive
Me Crazy essentially follows a paint by numbers scenario, and most
audiences will be able to predict the outcome of this tangled web of
adolescent lust and romance well before the climax.  John Schultz, who
gave us the moderately interesting Bandwagon last year, directs this
material in surprisingly lacklustre fashion.</P>
<P>This innocuous and decidedly lightweight comedy will certainly
appeal to its target audience, but adult audiences will probably find
that it drives them to distraction.</P>
