<P>     THE NEWTON BOYS illustrates that it's possible to make a film about 
gangsters and gunplay without an abundance of bloodshed, violence, and 
death.  In fact, for this account, which depicts "the true story of the 
most successful bank robbers in the history of the United States," 
director Richard Linklater has consciously kept the tone playful.  
That's not to say that THE NEWTON BOYS doesn't have its grim moments, 
but Linklater limits the shadows.  The result is a fast-paced, 
entertaining motion picture that replaces gritty tension with a lightly-
dramatic character interaction that occasionally borders on straight 
comedy.</P>
<P>     The real Newton Boys started their crime spree in 1919, and 
finished it five years later, in 1924.  During that time, the four 
brothers -- Joe (Skeet Ulrich), Jesse (Ethan Hawke), Willis (Matthew 
McConaughey), and Dock (Vincent D'Onofrio) -- and explosives expert 
Glasscock (Dwight Yoakam) broke into more than 80 banks and committed 
the largest train robbery in U.S. history -- the famous June 12, 1924 
Rondout Robbery.  Their illegal activities took them from their native 
Texas, through dozens of small towns and major cities all across the 
country, and into Canada.  Linklater's film recounts the Newton gang's 
exploits with all of the fondness of a grandfather relating a favorite 
story to a child.</P>
<P>     One thing that differentiates the Newton Boys from America's 
numerous, other well-known bandits is that they never killed anyone.  
They used guns, but rarely fired them, and almost never at a living 
target.  All they wanted was the money, and they were often kind to the 
men they held at gunpoint.  Moreover, they viewed themselves as 
champions of the undertrodden -- little thieves stealing from big 
thieves (the companies insuring the banks).  Linklater presents all four 
brothers as happy, good-natured fellows -- the kind of guys no one would 
mind hanging out with.  </P>
<P>     The violence in the film is kept to a minimum, and, while THE 
NEWTON BOYS depicts a few of the robberies from start-to-finish, most 
transpire as part of a montage that shows images of money, exploding 
safes, and newspaper headlines.  The film's narrative spotlight shines 
brightest on Willis, but finds time to illuminate the other three 
brothers, as well.  Since it spans a five-year period, THE NEWTON BOYS 
is understandably episodic.  Several key events from the characters' 
lives are highlighted.  There's even time for a love story -- that of 
Willis and an attractive single mother (Julianna Margulies) he falls for 
in Omaha.  </P>
<P>     To emphasize THE NEWTON BOYS' cheerful nature, Danny Barnes' score 
remains upbeat.  Linklater opens the film to this music with credits 
designed to evoke memories of the silent era.  The end credits are no 
less interesting, since they feature a series of video clips of 
interviews with the real Willis and Joe (the former from a 1975 
documentary; the latter from an appearance on an episode of THE TONIGHT 
SHOW with Johnny Carson).  In addition to assuring that no one will 
leave the movie early, these excerpts deepen the sense of closure 
offered by the series of captions that finish the narrative.  </P>
<P>     None of the actors in THE NEWTON BOYS gives a standout performance, 
but no one seems miscast, either.  Linklater has gone with a group of 
hot, young stars.  Matthew McConaughey, Ethan Hawke, and Skeet Ulrich 
are all desirable names to have on a marquee.  The lower-profile Vincent 
D'Onofrio (last seen as the hulking villain in MEN IN BLACK) gives the 
strongest performance of the lead quartet, and Dwight Yoakam proves that 
his work in SLING BLADE wasn't a fluke.  Julianna Margulies, the E.R. 
actress who is beginning to forge a big-screen name for herself, 
provides solid support for the mostly-male cast.</P>
<P>     The film is something of a departure for Linklater, whose previous 
efforts (including SLACKER, BEFORE SUNRISE, and SUBURBIA) have been 
dialogue-and-character-centered pieces, whereas THE NEWTON BOYS' 
greatest strengths are tone and narrative.  Going into the film, I knew 
little about the Newtons (except that they were pre-Depression era bank 
robbers), and, while I'm always wary of being "educated" by fact-based 
motion pictures (no matter how scrupulously they have been researched), 
I left the theater with a better idea of who these men were.  More 
importantly, I was entertained, and, for that pleasure, I can forgive 
any dramatic license that Linklater may have taken.</P>
