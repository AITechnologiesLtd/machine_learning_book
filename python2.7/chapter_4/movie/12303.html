<P>Determined to separate their film from this season's other "Yikes! 
There's a giant rock headed straight for Earth!" movie, the "Deep Impact" 
producers emphasize that "Armageddon" (due July 1) is an action flick, 
while their story is an emotion-propelled, realistic drama. "It's about 
what you'd do if you were told you only had a year to live," said 
director Mimi Leder, "I want the audience to walk away from this thinking 
about their own lives."</P>
<P>Lofty sentiments aside, "Deep Impact" is just another disaster movie, and 
an exceptionally clumsy one at that. In fact, after two hours of enduring 
the film's poorly drawn characters, insipid dialogue, and clichéd 
storylines, it's difficult not to root for the comet instead of the 
people.</P>
<P>There's something inherently awkward about the very notion of a comet 
collision movie. Presumably, no one wants to see humanity wiped out, but 
the whole lure of this type of film is the promise of witnessing disaster 
on a mammoth scale. It's like watching an auto race; no one wishes death 
or injury on the drivers, yet most people love to see a splashy wreck. In 
1951's "When Worlds Collide," the problem was solved by having two 
objects headed for Earth, one on a collision course and one that narrowly 
misses. An intrepid group of travelers takes off in a rocket. After Comet 
A destroys the Earth, they colonize Comet B, which just happens to have 
an oxygen atmosphere and beautiful green foliage.</P>
<P>"Deep Impact" isn't quite that ridiculous, but it comes close. Here, the 
president announces that Earth has a year before impact. In the interim, 
a group of astronauts will attempt to blow up the rogue rock. In case 
they fail, the government will house one million people in an underground 
shelter to begin life anew. A national lottery will be held. If your name 
is selected, you go into the shelter. If no...well, feel free to start 
smoking again.</P>
<P>Had the film seriously examined the societal consequences of a planet-
wide death sentence, "Deep Impact" could have meant something. Instead, 
they follow the "Cheesy Disaster Movies 101" lesson plan to the letter. 
The production hops between three storylines, none particularly inspiring.</P>
<P>While investigating what she believes to be a Washington sex scandal, 
plucky reporter Téa Leoni uncovers the classified information about the 
comet. Like any reputable journalist, she uses the information to strong-
arm the President and further her career. After marveling at her ease in 
cracking open the government secrets (she secures the information in 
about five minutes, using the search engine on her PC,) you can amuse 
yourself by counting the number of plugs given MSNBC, the fledgling cable 
news network. If the president was really concerned with national 
security, he should have told her to go ahead and broadcast the story on 
MSNBC, thus insuring that nobody would ever hear about it.</P>
<P>Storyline Two follows the astronauts as they attempt to destroy the comet.
 Robert Duvall heads up the team, which includes "Swinger's" Jon Favreau 
and TV mainstays Ron Eldard and Blair Underwood. Despite choppy editing 
in the action scenes and a contrived subplot involving the generation gap 
between Duvall and the younger astronauts, these segments carry the most 
emotional resonance, thanks to several poignant exchanges, plus solid 
acting from Duvall and company.</P>
<P>The third storyline is the most ludicrous, focusing on Elijah Wood, the 
kid who discovered the comet, and his girlfriend, Helen Hunt Jr. (her 
real name is Leelee Sobieski, but after one look at her, you'll 
understand.) Elijah snares a spot in the underground cavern, while Helen 
Jr. elects to stay with her parents. Will cruel fate keep the young 
lovers apart? Fat chance. Try to keep a straight face as Elijah tells his 
folks he's leaving the cavern for almost certain doom with his sweetie. 
Their response? "Well son, you take care now." </P>
<P>There isn't room to cover all the howlingly bad scenes in a film that 
seems brain-dead, even by disaster movie standards. Witness President 
Morgan Freeman solemnly tell the world about the comet, urging the 
populace to stay calm while describing the pending collision in terms 
alarming enough to send nuns screaming panic-stricken into the streets. 
Watch as people outrun a thousand foot high tidal wave moving at the 
speed of sound. Gaze in amazement as Elijah takes off on an highway 
clogged with thousands of cars, finds Helen Jr. in seconds, then easily 
navigates through the traffic jam that has everyone else trapped.</P>
<P>All this and more awaits you in "Deep Impact," the first major 
disappointment of the summer movie season. Incidentally, those whiz bang 
special effects you've seen in the film's trailers don't happen until the 
last twenty minutes of the movie. Unless you're a connoisseur of bad 
movies, wait until this dud collides with your TV and see them then.</P>
