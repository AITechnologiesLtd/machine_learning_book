<PRE>My Best Friend's Wedding
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**** (out of 4) MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is not what I expected. The
previews made it look like a fluffy romantic comedy that follows formula
exactly. After the opening title sequence, I was certain the movie would
be trite and airheaded. </P>
<P>In fact, the movie is NOT shallow and it breaks from formula in
interesting ways. It was surprising to see that the movie had a soul. </P>
<P>Julianne (Julia Roberts) gets a call from her long-time bachelor friend
Michael (Dermot Mulroney), three weeks before her 28th birthday. They
had agreed to marry each other if they were both still single by 28, so
Julianne is expecting "the question." If you've seen the previews, you
know that Michael has called to tell her that he's engaged to someone
else, and that Julianne decides that SHE wants to marry Michael, and she
wants to do it now. Meanwhile Kimmy (Cameron Diaz), Michael's fiance,
wants to make Julianne her new best friend, both from Michael's
flattering descriptions and as an alternative to jealousy. </P>
<P>It's easy to picture such a plot degenerating into a cheesy sitcom:
Julia Roberts concocting zany schemes to break up the wedding, creating
truckloads of wacky hilarity. P.J. Hogan's direction, Ronald Bass's
insightful script and the performances of all the main characters never
allowed that to be a real possibility. The movie is imbued with human
qualities - honesty, kindness, humanity - that most sitcoms - most
MOVIES - never even consider. </P>
<P>The movie treats all of its characters well. Nobody is evil. Nobody is
"the bad guy" in the disposable villain sort of way. When Julianne
springs a trap on Kimmy, we don't cheer the cruelty because Kimmy is not
a 2-dimensional punching doll. Even the pair of man-hungry sisters
(Rachel Griffiths and Carrie Preston), who are in the movie mainly as
comic relief, are given self-awareness and self-respect. Other family
members may put them down, but the movie itself never condescends. </P>
<P>MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is effective - some might say manipulative --at
winning you over to its side. For example, Julianne claims to be cynical
about big traditional weddings. But when she sees that her best friend
is going to have one without her, it turns out to be exactly what she -
and we, by our association with her as the hero - wants. Kimmy confides
to Julianne that she is just as sentimental as all the flighty nitwits
she's always pitied at weddings. Her heartfelt confession puts her on
our level and makes it okay for us to open our sentimental sides to the
movie. Even the trailers are effective(/manipulative) by making the
movie look much more simple than it is. I went to the movie "knowing"
exactly how it would play out based on the previews. As I said above, I
was pleasantly surprised by its depth and complexity (though perhaps
only relative to what I expected). </P>
<P>There is one scene, however, that really won me over and made me love
this movie as much as I did. One of Julianne's schemes is to make
Michael jealous by claiming her handsome gay friend George (charmingly
played by Rupert Everett) is her fiance. </P>
<P>There is a scene where George spontaneously starts singing shamelessly
in a restaurant. One by one, the other people at the table shed their
inhibitions and join in. Soon the whole big extended family is singing
boldly (and not too badly). After one chorus, the restaurant gives them
a round of applause. Not wanting the moment to end, someone from the
restaurant jumps on the piano and introduces another chorus, and now the
whole restaurant joins in. Everyone in the restaurant becomes one huge
family joined together to sing a love song for the young "couple," (and
each to remember their OWN first love). </P>
<P>The scene is a modern parallel of a whole tribe joining together at a
feast to celebrate a marriage. What makes it even better is that
everyone in the room wants to join in, but modern barriers of politeness
among strangers keep them from doing so. One by one, the people join in
anyway until the whole room is included. They collectively agree, for a
wonderful moment, to be family, not strangers. </P>
<P>Not only is this a great moment, but it also adds to the whole of the
movie. During this scene, the only person not singing is Julianne. Her
guilty conscience is starting to haunt her and she can't really
participate in the sincere expression of joy that everyone else in the
restaurant feels. </P>
<P>Twice I thought the movie's heart was in the wrong place. During the
credit sequence, the movie appears to be about how to win a man. The
notion of treating men as marriage objects seems as shallow and wrong as
treating women as sex objects. Later, Julianne insists that her motives
in chasing Michael are 100% pure love (and not jealousy or "winning").
Both times I winced with disappointment at the movie's vapidity. Both
times, the movie came back to show that the characters themselves, and
not the movie, were wrong. </P>
<P>Hogan's only other notable experience is his direction of MURIEL'S
WEDDING, which is another great movie that takes the romantic comedy and
adds a difficult twist. One wonders if he will be as good in another
genre, or if it's necessary that he even try. For the meantime, though,
he has found his niche: directing comedies with "Wedding" in the title.</P>
