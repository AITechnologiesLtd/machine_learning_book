<P>There's a lot to admire about Jeepers Creepers.  It's a horror film, but
it's packed with neither the hottest modern rock tracks nor acting talent
from any show on the WB.  It doesn't start with a pre-opening-credits
killing to whet your sick whistle, and there aren't any sex scenes
interrupted by a knife-wielding psycho.  That's enough to break the
conventional horror mold right there, but Creepers is actually somewhat
frightening, as well.</P>
<P>Instead of raiding the WB's casting closet, Creepers' producers turned to
two other networks from which to pluck their plucky leads.  Ed's Justin Long
and Boston Public's Gina Philips play Darryl and Trish, a brother and sister
who have chosen to take the back roads on their way home from college.  The
ride is full of good-natured ribbing and a time-passing license plate game,
but things take a turn for the worse when a creepy-looking truck with an
even creepier-sounding horn appears behind them and tries to run them off
the road before disappearing over the horizon.</P>
<P>Of course, that's not the end of Darryl and Trish's trip to the dark side.
Further down the road, they find an abandoned farmhouse with the beat-up
truck parked next to it.  As they slow down, the siblings see a dark figure
removing what appears to be corpses from the back of the truck and dropping
them down a sewer pipe protruding from the ground.  Like every other horror
film moron, the two decide to check things out, making themselves targets of
a man in black (whom we'll call Creepers, just because he doesn't really
have a name).</P>
<P>Creepers' first half is very promising, but then writer/director/child
molester Victor Salva (Powder) starts in with the typical horror clichés.
I'm talking about stuff like having the car run out of gas or refusing to
start at an inopportune moment - not the other stuff that's been "borrowed"
from other films, like self-mockery of the genre (a la Scream), bad stuff
happening at a secluded farmhouse (a la The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and
references to urban legends (a la, uh, Urban Legends).  Even the scenes
where Creepers tries to run Darryl and Trish off the road seems to be taken
right out of Duel, and the whole evil truck thing is done much better in the
upcoming Joy Ride.</P>
<P>One of the things that makes Joy Ride so enjoyable is the fact you never see
the bad guy.  Not here, though.  Creepers, who was frightening at the
beginning of the film, becomes pretty lame once you get a good look at him.
He's like the WWF version of evil.  Salva also inserts a completely
unnecessary psychic character (Patricia Belcher) into the action, just to
explain why Creepers is doing what he's doing, but it was a lot scarier when
we didn't know.</P>
<P>Still, Creepers is the most original mainstream American horror film I've
seen in a while.  It's better B-movie horror than John Carpenter has made in
a long time, with a darker baddie and leads that genuinely appear terrified.
Creepers is certainly entertaining enough, but in this sequel-crazy world,
I'm almost hoping nobody goes to see it, just so there won't be a lame
Jeepers Creepers 2 out next Halloween.</P>
<P>1:30 - R for terror violence/gore, language and brief nudity</P>
