                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>        Doomed to the humiliation of resignation over the two bit
Watergate burglary, shattered and dangerously close to the emotional
brink, Anthony Hopkins as Oliver Stone's NIXON stands before an
appropriately sorrowful portrait of JFK and says, "They look at you and
see what they want to be. They look at me and see what they are." It's a
powerful, stinging moment because it's catheterizing: the words channel
not only into Hopkins but also into us as if insertions of excruciating
self-recognition. The complexities of Richard Nixon were and remain his
pathology of lies and fabrication of enemies, which held hostage an entire
nation. Though the only solution the anesthesia of his departure, the
legacy of the politician who built his career on dirty tricks and the
surreptitious continues unabated: the GOP owes its current fair fortunes
on Nixon's devious, sleazy methodology. While Senator Allscum D'Amato subs
as the Nixonian dirty deed plotter for the time being, Robert Dole sobbing
at the Lyin' King's funeral is a most defining, foretelling moment. </P>
<P>        Anthony Hopkins isn't the first choice most of us would have made
to play our 37th president. And, as we now know, when Stone and Hopkins
started filming, the Welsh actor was deep in prosthetics and voice
duplication. Didn't work because no matter how good an actor Hopkins is,
he couldn't rise above the weight of caricature. Lest we forget, we've
already had that anyway: for example, in the TV miniseries BLIND AMBITION,
Rip Torn mimicked the president so uncannily, so incorrigibly that while
he drafted us into watching him, we wondered if he realized that his
acting had turned into a masquerade of old plaster. A super-scummy
mechanical contraption, we became as exhausted by Torn's preparations -- I
swear that we were able to see them being processed -- as he seemed to be.
Granted, taking on the role of a famous contemporary, particularly the
infamous, is a harder challenge for an actor than trying to bring to life
a famous figure who is historically out of our time. Creating a character
who can't be traced through the omnipresent media can give an actor the
edge; he can take chances in bringing the personage to life in his own way
without having to repeat exactly what we already know, which, right now,
is the most popular form of "acting." For instance, Derek Jacobi stunned
viewers with his title role in I,CLAUDIUS; watching him stutter, squint,
shake and fumble, grow from presumed idiot to master politician, one felt
that not only can history come alive but that TV performance can also
become art.  Like Rip Torn's Nixon, however, Jacobi's Hitler in INSIDE THE
THIRD REICH is a victim to all the media-produced history available. It
can be said that because there's a plenitude of material -- in Hitler and
Nixon's cases next to impossible to digest -- the roles seem safe only
when the actors lip-synch the parts. What happens when actors do this is
that when they imitate the more notorious media-framed impressions, they
become the imagery of our worst, most superficial suspicions about the
people they're only playing. It's not acting, in search of a fresh
perspective or new insights, it's kareoke as verdict. </P>
<P>        Is the art of respectable representation of the famous in danger
of turning into the art of trashing? If Torn's performance in the
parody-by-accident, bizarrely cast BLIND AMBITION begs the question, maybe
there's no other way to play other than "dress up," which provides a
safety net for audiences so they can somehow believe no one could be like
that or permit such the atrocities Hitler did -- a mechanism to relieve
themselves over the horrible fact that they voted for them. TNT's
KISSINGER AND NIXON, wanting to play it straight, reinforces the dilemma:
drenched in prosthetics, fat pads and speech affectations, Ron Silver as
Henry and Beau Bridges as Tricky Dicky soak up the good intentions and
what seeps out is slightly elevated Mad magazine; it's a drag show in
suits. The TV pic is further robbed of its seriousness because the script
can't cover in two hours (and probably not even in six or eight) the
verbosity and pompous megalomania of Kissinger. Most harmful is that
KISSINGER AND NIXON lacks establishment of fact and clarity of
after-effect. If healing is time's greatest virtue, one of its dangers is
that we forget how the duplicitous shenanigans of statesmen can put a
trusting nation in the vise: Henry and his boss were two of the biggest
prevaricators of their political time who, while playing games with each
other, kept us as emotional prisoners. KISSINGER AND NIXON doesn't flush
us with that kind of fear; instead, it turns an elected sociopath and a
German Machiavelli into pop-up cartoons. </P>
<P>        If only it were that simple -- to laugh off the damage they
inflicted. But the tragic travesty of Watergate can be comic: Of the
movies and television that have reconstructed the fiasco, my favorite is
Michael Lindsay-Hogg's NASTY HABITS, set in a Philadelphia nunnery and
based on Muriel Spark's satire THE ABBESS OF CREW. It's a delicious little
mockster that didn't do very well back in 1977, having come after the
overrated, chiaroscuristic ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, which used an unnamed
Judas to make us feel good about the press. (As timely as it was, a
catharsis of sorts, its grungy-grim dramaturgy is, now, unwatchable; it's
as paranoid as its target.) NASTY HABITS, however, is extremely watchable;
attacked by many for being an offender of Catholicism and therefore a
sacrilegious format to mock Nixon, it's a classy burlesque that wouldn't
be nearly as effective as it is without Glenda Jackson. Her Nixon is a
performance tilted to disturb on various levels, the most obvious being
the worrisome Nixon loner imperialism, his unearned haughtiness, his
terseness in speech and manner. Neither heavy handed impersonation like
Torn's nor the effervescent demon of Jason Robards Jr.'s portrayal in
WASHINGTON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, Jackson gets the hard-boiled covering of
Nixon down so pat that sometimes, briefly, Nixon's impenetrable persona
seems to suddenly appear. It's a little alarming, and meant to be, because
at times, when Nixon was publicly emoting, he scared the hell out of us in
that we hadn't a clue as to what he was really feeling. Having been
deceivingly shallow and contrived for so long that when he did display
emotions we had to wonder what new tricks were being employed. NASTY
HABITS is too short to get into psychology, but Jackson isn't afraid to
show us the slippery side, and she achieves this through crisp,
ultra-sharp enunciation that is like hot ice. Male actors playing Nixon go
for the piercing cold too, but Jackson's scenario isn't "just the usual
confession," it's hypnotic. </P>
<P>        Hopkins as Nixon is a real reach into the man that all the other
performances have shied away from, and primarily, one might assume,
because no director had the guts to try for a definitive study. This is
the surprise of NIXON: that Oliver Stone of all possible directors
attempted to do it. Scene for scene, it's his most balanced, even
honorable work. The caveat is that it's as balanced and honorable a
portrait of Nixon that Stone could accept as the kind of prejudicial,
provoking artist that he is. Because of JFK, Stone has made it easy for
his detractors to attack him for alleged distortion and out and out
fantasy, and, not unexpectedly, the Nixon daughters have issued a
statement of public condemnation over NIXON. Not unlike Dole carping about
violence in movies he never sees, or the  Christers screaming about
Scorsese's LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST before they ever viewed it, the Nixon
girls, at the time of the statement, hadn't seen Stone's three hour etude.
If or when they do, there's a slim chance they're feel embarrassed by
rushing to premature conclusions. Stone's script, annotated to support the
wormiest of claims made, won't pass muster with them, but watching their
father through Hopkins is likely to cause flashes of hurtful memories when
they hear this Nixon warn about "the lie" and "the cover up." And deep
pain when they watch Hopkins achieve an intense, extraordinary dimension
built from torment, especially when his Nixon asks Paul Sorvino's
Kissinger to knee with him and pray; when Hopkins is consoled by Joan
Allen's Pat just before they climb the White House steps to the
presidential quarters for one of the last times; and when Hopkins
verbatims Nixon's farewell to the White House staff. It is not possible to
be unaffected by these progressions into dissolution. </P>
<P>        Hopkins validates the famous Nixon imagery; Stone's "fairness,"
though, isn't the same as fact. Before the movie starts, we're told that
the screenplay is based on what's published, that much of what is
available is contradicted by an equal amount of material, and that the
play condenses, composites and conjectures. Well, that's more honest than
he usually is about his subjects, yet that doesn't stop him from
theorizing without much solid support: that Nixon got involved with
attempting to execute Castro, but the mess backfired and JFK was
assassinated as punishment. And that that is the reason why Castro has
been left alone: like J. Edgar Hoover, Castro knows where the bodies are.
There are slimy insinuations that Nixon was involved in Bobby Kennedy's
death, and in the shooting of George Wallace. (Stone must have read the
predictions of computer pioneer Edmund Berkeley.) The director's not above
putting accusations of crimes into Pat Nixon's mouth: she reminds Nixon
that she knows what he did to Alger Hiss, who unwittingly made Nixon
nationally recognized. As Stone postulates, NIXON becomes a badly edited
Reader's Digest version of Fawn M. Brodie's RICHARD NIXON: THE SHAPPING OF
HIS CHARACTER: lots of smeary quotes, gossipy tidbits, truncated
flashbacks, but no shaping. </P>
<P>That's what makes NIXON a less than satisfactory picture: there's so much
peripheral garbage thrown in that you end up fighting to stay interested
-- you can feel yourself pushing away all the Adobe After Effects in order
to get to the man. The graphic pizzazz in NATURAL BORN KILLERS might have
been all right for the twentysomethings fed on MTV, but it not only
doesn't belong in NIXON, the filler takes away from Stone's limited
respectability. Cautioning about the psychology of deception, of envy, of
enemies, and how they almost always backfire when used to maintain power,
Stone is striving to produce a rather admirable examination. But he's only
got himself to blame for not getting the kind of positive reaction he
wants, because I doubt anyone begged him to infuse NIXON with an overload
of junked up technology. What hasn't been intended by Stone is what seems
clearer now than during the turmoil of Nixon's immediate and post
presidency: that the myth of Nixon's cavernous complexities is just that.
Through fuzzy-of-meaning flashbacks, which include scenes of Nixon's
parents Frank and Hannah, Stone tries to establish the origins of Nixon's
behavior, but as one watches, and notices what's missing -- like when at
seven he slammed a hatchet into the head of a six-year-old boy after he
refused to give Dick a jar of pollywogs; or Dick's disappointment in not
being able to attend Yale (that, had he attended, might have abated
instead of exacerbated his vengeful hate of the rich) -- it's apparent
that the director can't get to any root causes and linking manifestations
because he can't see where they are. All of us are thicker and fuzzier
psychologically than we'd be willing to admit, but with Nixon, once you
"get it," much about him falls into place. </P>
<P>        The star-studded cast is, overall, unobjectionable, with Madeline
Kahn as big mouth Martha Mitchell very funny. (There are other laughs in
the movie, but those few of us who managed some chuckles did so with
inexplicable discomfort.) There's a wonderful bit of E. G. Marshall as
John Mitchell in shadow; David Hype Pierce's John Dean a semi-serious
equivalent to Sandy Dennis' ditzsy Dean in NASTY HABITS; Sorvino looking a
little too tanned but getting Henry's speechiness down quite well; and
last but not least, Joan Allen as Pat. Here's a first lady we still know
next to nothing about, and even if Stone claims that sufficient research
has gone into the part, and backed up by advisers who supposedly knew the
"inside story," this Pat is conceived as the public wants to see her.
She's the public "silent majority," mutely suffering for her husband's
sins, but privately she's a chain-smoker (the real Pat died of lung
cancer), drinker, embittered by a lack of love, affection and sex. And a
sort of secret liberal needler: You really want to believe it when she
tells Hopkins' Nixon, "I know why people hate you." If Kahn is close to
looking like Martha, Allen's resemblance to Pat is spooky. In their
understandable protectiveness, the Nixon girls will tell us neither their
mother nor father were drinkers, but the evidence is strong that they
were. (Considering the pressures, you can't condemn them; and Nixon blames
Pat's stroke in 1976 on Woodward and Bernstein's THE FINAL DAYS.) Many of
us regret that Pat Nixon never spilled the beans. No one could have been
more authoritative.</P>
<P>        The passing of Richard Nixon has been an excuse for some, like
Kissinger, Alexander Haig and that weeping Dole, to wax a certain kind of
poetic mendacity about the late president's achievements. But thanks to
the myriad of books, articles, movies, miniseries and, most damning of
all, news film and those tapes on Watergate, eternal reminders of the sad
fact that a stultifying break-in snowballed into the self-destruction of a
president, Nixon will never be allowed to escape his true heritage. No
adversary could have concocted a more just finale: everything we ever
suspected about Nixon was confirmed almost daily during the prolonged
crisis, especially that he was liar, obstructionist, and, maybe most
dangerous of all, paranoid. Could Nixon have survived despite these sins,
if he had destroyed the tapes, as Pat in NIXON suggested? Most of us
probably doubt it. While some evidence would have been more difficult to
attain, the arrogant act of burning them would be tantamount to guilt and,
inevitably, he'd have been re-crucified by the press, who, some are sure,
would have found ways to muddy up his foreign policy triumphs -- China,
mainly -- by calling them betrayals to his hatred of the Reds. (Nixon's
domestic policies were disguised liberalism.) Our national hate for Nixon
goes back to the late 40s, and, though we have forgotten, even Eisenhower
detested him, having twice wanted to remove him from the Republican
ticket. But by the time Nixon was finally elected president in 1968, with
indeed the horrible help of the assassinations of the Kennedys, we were
swirling in the maelstrom of Vietnam, unable to convince ourselves that
the war was, one, strategically unimportant, two, our fault, and three,
immoral. Nixon's close victory came about because his stalwart
anti-Communist stance -- which was a political expedient and leftover from
the old McCarthy days -- still resonated; enough fear-loaded voters fell
for his lie about a "secret plan" to end the war and agreed with him that
the press was to blame for our mounting losses. (Anti-Communism, the press
and the hippies were used by a sick nation to forgive itself for Kent
State.) Shortly after he was reelected in a landslide in 1972, the
still-raging war had two fronts: in the jungles of Vietnam and at home, in
the offices of the President. When the burglary of the Democratic National
Party offices was irrefutably linked to Nixon, every lie converged and
nineteen months after his January, 1973 inaugural, he resigned in
disgrace. What didn't go away, and remain rampant as ever, are the tools
scumbags use to lord over those who elected them or read them: when a
former Nixon propagandist, blinded by the black blizzard of Watergate and
suspiciously forgetful of Nancy Reagan's shadow governance, calls Hillary
Rodham Clinton "a congenital liar," what's being sanction by the New York
Times are promulgation of agenda and, make no mistake about it, a
columnist's and a New York senator's infectious misogynistic obsessions to
destroy a first lady who was once a part of the legal legion investigating
Watergate. They're creating enemies who needn't be, just like Nixon who,
according to that columnist on an A & E Biography, "redeemed himself" in
the end. Only a patent liar, a virtual son of a male bitch, could mouth
the biggest lie of all.</P>
