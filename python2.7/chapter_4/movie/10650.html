A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Martin Scorsese</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Melissa Mathison</PRE>
<P>Starring: 
Tenzin Yeshi Paichang, Tulku Jamyang Kunga Tenzin, Gyurme Tethong,
Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong, Tenzin Trinley, Tencho Gyalpo</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Tibet, Tibetan music, Tibetan mountains, Tibetan costumes, Tibetan
villagers, Dalai Lama</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
KUNDUN is the pictorial biography of the fourteenth Dalai Lama, who is
still alive today (but exiled and living in India since the Chinese
military takeover of Tibet). The Dalai Lama is the religious leader of
Tibet. Tibetans revere him as the fourteenth reincarnation of a
compassionate holy man. KUNDUN traces the Dalai Lama's life story from
'pampered tot in training' to exiled leader. </P>
<P>Opinion: 
1. The cinematography in KUNDUN is priceless and extraordinary.
2. The plot is so unnecessary you can turn off the dialogue and replace
it with music.
3. The music says 'Tibet' but is a bit repetitive and is suspenseful in
the wrong places.
4. Tencho Gyalpo does a superb supporting job as the Dalai Lama's
mother.
5. KUNDUN is an unconventional spiritual film with searing
cinematography.</P>
<P>In my hometown there was once a murder (where a dorky middle-aged guy
living with his wife in a cheap house killed her because she found out
he was involved with the mob. Hollywood turned it into a TV movie). They
portrayed the dorky balding guy as confident, muscular, square-jawed and
handsome. And they portrayed his nagging potbellied wife as a sultry,
hot seductive blond babe. The Hollywood-ized version of the story turned
their shabby roadside shack into a sprawling Beverly Hills countryside
mansion. But that's the way Hollywood movies are. They dramatize and
glamorize, trying to offer us better looking versions of ourselves doing
exaggerations of normal life. </P>
<P>What if movies didn't do this? Then they might turn out like KUNDUN.
KUNDUN takes the opposite approach. Instead of giving us a glitzy,
schlocky 1990s Hollywood version of Tibet, with a slick plot, and
charming Beverly Hills guys and gals, KUNDUN gives us Tibet, in all its
peculiar timelessness. It plunges us into a weird kaleidoscope world of
ice-capped mountains and swirling robes and reincarnation where time
doesn't exist and neither do stories. KUNDUN is like opening a religious
photo album and seeing pictures come to life: individual grains of
falling sand; a holocaust-like dream scene of hundreds of dead monks
clad in red; a young bespectacled man looks wistfully through a car
window. With no big emphasis on plot, we in the audience are left to ask
ourselves what it all means in the grand scheme of things. Which is
probably just what Martin Scorsese, the director of KUNDUN, intended.
Remarkably, the entire film is a metaphor meant to mirror the mentality
of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.</P>
<P>This makes KUNDUN the cinematic equivalent of staring at the Grand
Canyon. There are only two possible outcomes. Either you'll wonder why
you should stare for two hours when the film apparently doesn't move the
way 'normal' films do. Or you'll be awed by the fantastic visuals and
emerge with a deeper sense of spirituality.</P>
