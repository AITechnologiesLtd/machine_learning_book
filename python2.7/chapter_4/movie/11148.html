                      A film review by Timothy Voon

<P>Cast: Djimon Hounsou, Matthew McConaughey, Morgan Freeman, Anthony
Hopkins, Nigel Hawthorne, Stellan Skarsgard, David Paymer, Pete
Postlethwaite, Anna Paquin Director: Steven Spielberg Screenplay: David
Franzoni</P>
<P>I have perhaps wrongly felt that Steve Spielberg excels better as a
director of action packed adventure movies, than one needed to handle a
sensitive melodrama. With the exception of SCHINDLER'S LIST, which was
too intense for my comfort zone, I have continued to hold to this
generalisation until now. The AMISTAD is exactly this, a tense courtroom
drama with a powerful, universal message – Freedom!</P>
<P>Set in the 1800's, this is the true story of a group of African slaves
who manage to mutiny aboard a Spanish ship in their desperate efforts to
return home.  Recaptured of the coast of the United States, they are put
through the mill of judicious trials before reaching the Supreme Court
to be represented by the ex-President himself, John Quincy Adams
(Anthony Hopkins). The nature of this case was not as simple as letting
a few African slaves go, but would become the thorn of contention over
which North and South would go to war.</P>
<P>Spielberg draws horrific pictures of the maltreatment of slaves aboard
the slave ships. This is not dissimilar to the horrific suffering he
recreated during the Jewish Holocaust. The AMISTAD is also full of
powerful, sickening images of human beings subjected to torture, rape
and murder. Human life is reduced to a mere commodity and is as easily
exchanged for coin, as it is to toss into the sea as unwanted cargo. It
is these images that tell us of their unimaginable suffering and the
reason why slavery must and should always remain abolished.</P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins once again scores another Academy Award nomination for a
finely tuned character performance in portraying the great Quincy Adams.
Morgan Freeman says little in the movie and has little room to manoeuvre
with his character except to silently voice his protest through others.
Matthew McConaughey is no stranger to the courtroom (A TIME TO KILL) and
does well as the property lawyer who defends the Africans up until the
Supreme Court. But it is the African slave Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), who
shows us the torment of a captured human being with his every defiant
expression and shed tear. He gazes up at the night sky and carries with
him all the hopes of one looking for the way home. This movie is a long
sit, but should be worth your while if you are willing to understand the
plight of the human spirit.</P>
