<PRE>ROB ROY   ****</PRE>
<P>Directed by Michael Caton-Jones
Starring Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth, John Hurt, Brian Cox</P>
<P>     Based on the famous Scottish legend, Director Caton-Jones
(Scandal) gives this story top notch treatment.  Neeson stars as Rob
Roy McGregor, a highlander who is the leader of his clan, which with
himself work for the Marquis of Montrose (Hurt) and also owns his own
piece of land.  Making the decision to borrow money from the Marquis
and try to sell cattle he herds with the men of his clan, Roy steps on
the toes of a visitor of the Marquis played by Tim Roth, and the
Factor, Brian Cox.</P>
<P>     The story then unfolds as Roy must prove to the Marquis he did not
steal his money and also confront Roth, who is the most devilish
villain in quite some time.</P>
<P>     Being Scottish,  I was a little apprehensive about this film, but
Jones really has done a superb job.  There is great detail given to the
way of life and to every facet of Scottish civilization in this
period.  Neeson is the quintessential hero, and is overpowering in the
fight scenes. Lange (BLUE SKY) once again proves why she is one of the
hottest actresses around, giving a memorable performance and pulling
off quite a good accent.  The supporting cast is first rate as well.
Hurt (ALIEN) is perfect as the pompous, yet fleeting Marquis, and Cox
(HIDDEN AGENDA) is extremely well cast as the Marquis right hand man.
However, as has been said by almost all reviews so far, the film
belongs to Roth (PULP FICTION, RESERVOIR DOGS) who steals every scene
he is in.  With just the right amount of effeminate gesturing, his
ruthlessness is all the more disturbing.  Truly one of the best
villains in the past few years.</P>
<P>     Karl Walter Lindenlaub's cinematography is exquisite, showing the
simple beauty of Scotland.</P>
