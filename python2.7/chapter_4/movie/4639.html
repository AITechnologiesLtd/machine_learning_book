<PRE>                             FORT APACHE (1948)
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>FORT APACHE (1948) Directed and co-produced by John Ford, from
a screenplay by Frank Nugent, suggested by the story
"Massacre" by James Warner Bellah. Photography, Archie Stout.
Editing, Jack Murray. Art direction, James Basevi. Music,
Richard Hageman.  Cast: John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Shirley
Temple, John Agar, Pedro Armendariz, Dick Foran, Victor
McLaglen and others from Ford's repertory company. 126 min.</P>
<P>A genuine, entirely American masterpiece. The first of the
Ford U.S. Cavalry trilogy. Longish work centers on a military
garrison out West, mostly manned by veterans of the Civil
War--tactfully called here "the late war"-- most of whom had
held higher battlefield commissions. They live in rowdy
harmony until  the new colonel, Thursday (Fonda), a vain,
arrogant, class-conscious martinet, upsets all, from the
cavalrymen to the sensible, humanitarian Captain (Wayne), and
the Apaches of Cochise, whom he first betrays, then attacks
suicidally.</P>
<P>The film takes its delicious time with vignettes of the men
and their families, comic Irish shenanigans, and sub-plots.
The only weak subplot is the romance between Philadelphia
(Temple),the Colonel's daughter, and O'Rourke (Agar, in his
debut,) the new lieutenant from West Point.</P>
<P>It's an affair that starts before the film can get going.
Temple is all smiles and simpers. Agar, as the son of Sergeant
Major Ward Bond and lovely Irene Rich,  is overshadowed by the
masterful acting of his screen parents. But even this romance,
superfluous in other hands, scores some touching points with
Ford.</P>
<P>Whatever the minor flaws, these are entirely made up by the
excellence of the rest of the cast, from the trio of Agar's
three godfather sergeants (here McLaglen partly reprises his
role in "Gunga Din") to the Fonda-Wayne contrast.</P>
<P>Fonda is obviously patterned after General Custer, down to a
superbly filmed Last Stand. Ford has tremendous control over
his film. Army life may have never been quite the way it is
depicted but that's a moot point, one that you raise for
ordinary or "historical" films but not for Ford's stylized
masterpieces. By the standards of the genre, "Fort Apache" is
rather complex in plot, characters and visuals, but it feels
simple because it so cleanly made that even familiar devices,
treated in a fresh manner, become rituals and look un-cliched. </P>
<P>The film has grandeur but no grandiloquence. Though everything
is a little or a lot bigger than life, nothing seems
self-conscious or artsy. Ford's eye for authenticity, forswift
and effective details of pathos or satire, is amazing. Compare
the brevity and genuiness of Wayne's encounter with Cochise
(whom he respects) with the same situation in another fine
film, Delmer Daves's "Broken Arrow." Ford's talent comes even
more sharply into focus. Even when horses ford a stream,
there's something more striking in their movements than in
most movies by others.</P>
<P>Morally, Ford is walking a tightrope. He blames military
folly, but at the same time he is so taken with the values of
the Army--a wonderful institution, an expanded family --that
at the end there is an inevitable cop-out when Wayne pays an
unconvincing tribute to Fonda. Yet it may be this very
partisanship that, in part, gives this and other Ford movies
their conviction. The warm poetry and lyrical visuals have not
dated a bit. Freeze the frames on a VCR and you get a
collection of splendid individual shots, compositions that
stand as single images and also flow in beautiful continuity. </P>
<P>To my taste, Richard Hageman's score dates, now is
inappropriate, now like music for a B-movie. This is a
forgettable imperfection in a work that justifies those who
call Ford "King John." Please turn the control to defeat
colorization, if any.  (Edwin Jahiel) </P>
