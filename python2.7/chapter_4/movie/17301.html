<PRE>THE SON ALSO RISES</PRE>
<PRE>THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN
Directed by Ulu Grosbard
Screenplay by Steven Schiff from Jaquelyn Mitchard's novel
With Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams
 PG-13    108 min.</PRE>
<P>     The good news is that Ulu Grosbard's adaptation of Jaquelyn 
Mitchard's kidnapping bestseller steers scrupulously clear of the tear-
jerking excesses you might expect. The bad news is it seldom engages your 
emotions.  It's got moments of tremendous tension, and it provides a lot 
to think about.  But it never pierces the place where we feel.  
     The story, for those who have ignored Oprah's exhortation to read 
the book, is about Beth Cappadora (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose 3-year-old 
son Ben disappears from a crowded Chicago hotel lobby while she is 
registering for a high school reunion (it was a very good-looking class.) 
 She's wracked with guilt, and shuts herself off emotionally from the 
rest of her family -- 7-year-old Vincent (Cory Buck), baby Kerry, and 
husband Pat (Treat Williams).  
     And then nine years later, when the family, still miraculously 
together, has moved to Chicago, a neighbor boy named Sam (Ryan Merriman) 
shows up at the door to mow the lawn.  Beth takes one look at him and 
knows: it's Ben.  
     But we're only halfway through the movie, which extends way beyond 
the normal kidnapping story and explores the complexities of what's right 
and what's wrong for all involved when nobody still alive is to blame.  
Like Natalie Wood in John Ford's "The Searchers", the boy has forgotten 
his first family and loves the one he's grown up in.  When he does return,
 he doesn't know them and they don't know him.  "We've missed a lot of 
years," says Pat.
     Grosbard digs around in a cold fire of family and social issues, 
prodding sparks out of the embers.  He keeps us busy with things to 
consider, such as the role of the press, which the family uses to 
publicize and plead when the boy goes missing, and then shuts out when it 
swoops down on them in a feeding frenzy of intrusive questions.  We're 
asked to think about such things as how much grief and guilt is allowed 
and how much becomes excessive when you lose a child.  "You may think 
you're a rotten mother," the detective 
(Whoopi Goldberg) tells Beth, urging her back to her other two kids, "but 
you're the only one they've got."
     But they don't get enough of her, and neither does her husband; a 
big piece has gone with Ben, and though she pastes on smiles and goes on 
living, she's a long way from whole.  
     There's some excellent acting, led by the tightly-wound and wounded 
Pfeiffer, whose early radiance vanishes under her burden of guilt.  
Vincent (as a teenager played with compelling sullenness by General 
Hospital's Jonathan Jackson) has his load of guilt too -- he let go of 
his brother's hand when he was minding him.  And Pat labors under the 
guilt of blaming Beth, though he tries to conceal it.  They're a poster 
family for dysfunctionality.  The trouble is, they're so unable to 
communicate that they fail to communicate with us as 
well.  
     Grosbard doesn't pander to his audience, but he seems to be trying 
so hard not to that he skips along the surface of this story, hurrying 
from this scene to that, telling us with edgy coolness what's at issue 
and what's at stake, but never bringing us in to share it.</P>
