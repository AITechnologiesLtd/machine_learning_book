<P>        If it's true society is losing its attention span, and appreciation of the
finer things in life then it makes perfect sense a film like `Rush Hour' would
be a big hit. It has two big stars, a classic premise and promotions that
promise both comedy and action, and yet there's almost nothing to it. It's
Hollywood's definition of productivity - to put in the least amount of effort
as possible and be successful with it.</P>
<P>        This film capitalizes on what I refer to as `the dead weekend monster,' a
film that wouldn't succeed during the war of the special-effects-summer-movies
or during the holiday seasons. A smart Hollywood exec knows when movies make
money and when they don't, it's all a matter of timing and the right timing
can anything look good.</P>
<P>        Let's look at the facts: it's a `cop-buddy,-but-not-really' movie starring
two semi-big celebrities who have become quite popular due to starring and/or
co-starring in several smaller films. Chris Tucker seems to be marketed as the
next Will Smith while Jackie Chan, who is a legend in overseas martial arts
flicks, is just now getting the attention he deserves. Neither have a thing to
lose by being in this film, no matter how bad reviews it gets it's guaranteed
to win at least a few weekends' top gross. Everyone involved with this film
will most likely go on to do just slightly better next year and every year
until they reach the top. In the meantime, we'll just have to stick it out.</P>
<P>        To say the film is paint-by-numbers is an understatement to be sure. At least
it tries to have a little fun with the hand it's dealt. We start out in Hong
Kong, the last day of British rule where the basic plotline is set up and some
of the main characters are introduced. There's a little action on Chan's part,
he plays a Detective named Lee who's been tracking a notorious villain named
JunTao (Warner) for years. We never learn much about JunTao except that he's a
really mean guy and has a bad reputation, whether he's into a specific vice
such as selling drugs or weapons or the whole mob scene isn't quite clear.
What is clear is that he's the one who always gets away from Lee and follows
his friend, a Chinese diplomat named Han (Tzi Ma) to Los Angeles and kidnaps
his daughter for a hefty ransom (dut dun duh!)</P>
<P>        At least the film is consistent in its flaws. The Chinese aspects are
portrayed as quite serious with the whole system of honor and everything and
immediately we cut to the American counterpart - LAPD Detective James Carter
(Tucker), who's a trash-talking, hyperactive, loose canon that isn't afraid to
break the rules, risk lives and property damage, but that's what cops in L.A.
in the movies do (you don't think they actually find clues and follow leads do
you?).</P>
<P>        And then there's our friends the Feds, who are supposedly the smartest
criminal-catchers in the world and have access to advanced technology, but
still can't figure out how to get out of unusual personnel moves. After Han's
daughter is kidnapped, the FBI steps in but the feds are almost outraged when
they learn Detective Lee is on the way to help them out, so they somehow get
Carter to `babysit' him because `he'll just get in the way' while they handle
business.</P>
<P>        Naturally the first act is concentrated mostly on the comedic aspect with
Tucker doing his spiel while Chan handles the action. The film wastes a large
chunk of time with a chase scene in which Lee runs from Carter all the while
making for comedy and action with the mix of stunts and one-liners and
slapstick. Eventually the two start to work together towards solving the case,
even though it's quite clear they've been asked not to and don't know where to
start.</P>
<P>        Throughout most of the duration of the events, as silly as they often seem,
they're at least consistent and full of energy. Tucker can be funny, as his
appeal lies in his delivery and attitude, not the script. The said can be said
of  Chan, who has almost nothing to do, he's either getting into fights or on
the verge of tears when he spits out rhetoric at the villains. Watching his
fight scenes are more interesting on a mathematical level than they are as
pure adrenaline excitement. He uses everyday objects to disarm his enemies and
always has perfect timing. No matter how by-the-book the story is, Chan's
action always seems spontaneous and improvised.</P>
<P>        Eventually the film does begin to concentrate a little harder on the more
taxing elements such as the plot and the mystery of where the little girl is
and how Carter and Lee are going to find her when the feds can't. A few
interesting detective skills are thrown in that give the film a ray of hope
every once in a while, but they all end up following the same lead - ending
with zany fight scenes. Not to say the fight scenes are all that bad, it just
seems repetitive after a while.</P>
<P>        And what's an action film without a major action-packed finale with a twist
of the ol' timebomb and the villain-almost-gets-away and the hero-almost-dies?
Surprisingly, the ending here is quite weak. Throughout the film the action
had always been coupled with comedy, but here it's mostly just chaos.</P>
<P>        There's just not much of anything of any value to `Rush Hour.' Will anyone
think much of it a year from now? There's nothing insightful or innovative to
it, and yet it's just part of a trend. Movies shouldn't be made as fast food
for the eye.</P>
