<P>Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin are two of today's biggest names in comedy.  Both
of them are well-known for movies such as The First Wive's Club (Hawn), Shampoo
(Hawn), Father of the Bride (Martin), and The Jerk (Martin).  Mix these two
comics together and what do you get?  The Out of Towners.  The Out of Towners
is a remake of the 1970 classic starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis.  With
such a great cast this time around, how could it fail?  Well, I was worried it
was, but I was not let down.</P>
<P>Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin are Nancy and Henry Clark, a middle aged couple
from Ohio.  Right now, they are experiencing hard times because their son
(Oliver Hudson) just went off to college.  Their daughter is also away, so they
are living by themselves now.  They look at it in two ways.  1. They have more
time to themselves.  2. They will be lonely without their kids.  Another
problem the two are facing is one that Henry is keeping from Nancy- that he has
been fired.  He most go to an interview for a job in New York City, and when
Nancy tags along unexpectedly, the two are off for an adventurous, wild ride
through the vast place they call New York City.</P>
<P>Things get off to a bad start when their bags turn up lost after arriving in
New York City.  What occurs from here is incident after incident that puts the
two into more and more trouble.  They have no money, no bags, and the police
are even after them.  Whenever they try to get themselves out of trouble, they
just get burrowed into it more and more and more.  </P>
<P>Goldie Hawn is the best part of the film.  Her dialogue is absolutely
hysterical.  She whines a lot, which makes for a lot of laughs.  I always enjoy
Goldie Hawn.  She has a way of making me laugh, just when I look at her.  As
more problems arise for Martin's character, he starts to go, well, crazy.  He
does make for some funny sequences when he becomes very stressed out, but some
of the comedy that comes from Martin is not funny, but obnoxious.  A scene in
which Martin takes a hallucinogenic is very well done and funny.  John Cleese
as Mr. Mersault is very funny and gives some unexpected laughs.  For the most
part, The Out of Towners humor is very well used.  In some parts of the film,
it starts to use the slapstick comedy method, which did not work for the type
of movie this was.  Some of the slapstick did work though.</P>
<P>One thing that I really didn't like about The Out of Towners that it wasn't
much different from anything else.  The events that take place are highly
predictable and overused in movies such as this one.  It was pretty
forgettable, and only after one week of seeing it, I am having a very hard time
writing a review for it.  This movie is not the type of movie teens would like.
 They are better off seeing movies such as She's All That or 10 Things I Hate
About You.  The movie won't really appeal to older audiences either,
considering the amount of slapstick comedy involved.  It won't even appeal to
little kids because of some of the more mature themes, violence and stealing,
will not be appropriate for them.  So who does this movie appeal to?  The
answer is: Pretty much no one.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- The Out of Towners shouldn't be in town for long.  </P>
