<PRE>                A REVIEW OF "CENTRAL STATION"
                       by Ryan Ellis</PRE>

<P>        With the exception of the Akira Kurosawa classic "Throne Of
Blood", I had never seen a foreign language film until "Central
Station". Reading subtitles while trying to watch the facial
expressions, set details, and technical aspects of a movie is not
always fun. Heck, it's downright annoying. Still, if the acting
is good and the story is compelling, you have to be willing to
let your eyes do a little walkin' around the entire screen, from
top to bottom.
        This late '98 release is an art film from Brazil about one
lonely woman's seemingly pointless struggle through life. Dora
(Fernanda Montenegro in an Oscar-nominated performance) is an
older woman who spends her time writing letters for people at the
central station. She's become incredibly cynical and doesn't even
bother to mail many of the letters she's entrusted to send to the
intended. A feisty woman named Ana (Soia Lira) and her spunky
son, Josue (Vincius de Oliveira), stop by to send some angry
words to the boy's estranged father. Shortly thereafter, Ana
returns to revise the letter and make a plea for reconciliation.
That day she is run over by a bus and killed instantly, leaving
Josue all alone.
        Dora continues on and the boy, with no place to go, camps
out at the station. He and Dora begin a volatile relationship.
For a short time, she invites the lad to move in with her until
she can handle him no longer and pawns him off on a couple who
"pay" for kids. She buys a TV with the money, which makes her
neighbourly chum, Irene (Marilla Pera), happy, but Dora soon
regrets the decision and rescues the angry kid. From here, this
film has "It Happened One Night" overtones with reversed roles.
Dora sets out on a bustrip with Josue to take him "home" to his
father in another town.
        She takes him about halfway, gets off the bus, and plans to
let him go the rest of the way by himself. Instead, he also gets
off the bus, stranding them both with no money, and forcing her
to continue on the journey. Along the little odyssey, they hitch
a ride with a friendly truck driver, steal food, and learn a
great deal about themselves and each other. When they finally get
to his father's home, they've created a bond of friendship that
transcends age and loneliness.
        This is a story about friendship and love. It's about
discovering your father (metaphorically and literally) and
finding someone to keep you safe. The pains of alcoholism are a
factor, too, since Josue's dad is rumoured to be a drunk. While
Dora is no saint and she tends to push away every man she meets
(including the trucker), she's a lonely woman who is simply
trying to survive.
        Montenegro is solid and heart-felt in this role and, while
the Academy probably won't give her the award, she's a
distinguished nominee for Best Actress. She's the main reason to
see "Central Station". In supporting roles, de Oliveira and Pera
are pretty good, too, and provide comic relief. In fact, this
movie knows when to crack a joke and when to tug at the heart.
Director Walter Salles provides good balance with those aspects
of the script and he uses the camera well.
        "Central Station" is a poetic movie, but it wouldn't be
getting much recognition if not for Fernanda Montenegro. She is
the backbone of this film chronicling the day-to-day hardships of
Brazilian life for the under-privileged and unloved. And those
darn sub-titles aren't so bad when the performances and story are
sweet and agreeable.</P>
