<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The Devil made him do it, and the Devil's a gorgeous she in a revealing
red dress. "Bedazzled" is a story about a desperate computer geek who
signs away his immortal soul in exchange for seven wishes, which all
center around him getting a girl from his workplace he has fallen in
love with, but who doesn't even notice him.</P>
<P>Before Hollywood got a hold of this theme, literature did. Writers such
as Christopher Marlowe, in his 16th century book on Faust and Goethe,
writing about Faust in the 18th century, used this theme. However,
"Bedazzled" is a remake of a more vulgar source for the Faust legend,
Stanley Donen's 1967 very funny satire, which starred (and was written
by) Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. This "Bedazzled" provides some
lighthearted fun with the theme, but is not quite as wicked and not as
funny. It allows the main character to learn the folly of getting what
you wish for, as in the process of seeing all his wishes fizzle out
after he gets them, he smartens up and learns to tone down his obnoxious
behavior and relax by being himself, therefore becoming a much wiser
person. It almost seemed ridiculously out of place to hear him become so
virtuous from this experience, a humanitarian who realizes that he can't
sell his soul because he never owned it.</P>
<P>The action takes place in modern San Francisco. Brendan Fraser is Elliot
Richards, a loser with a nerdy smile, who is a computer tech-support
worker whose fellow workers find him intolerable and make a considerable
effort to find ways of not being with him. The Devil comes by way of the
very sexy and witty Elizabeth Hurley, who tempts him with a chance to
get his workplace Alison (Frances O'Connor), if he just signs the
contract. Hurley gives this film its purpose and sense of tart humor,
but even her role seems punchless and absurd. Though, it is hard to
understand why the geek wasn't more tuned into her and used one of the
seven wishes granted to bag her instead of the rather ordinary Frances.
Frances O'Connor does an adequate job in a role that mainly requires her
to be desirable in many different ways. She has a sweet smile and shows
she can display a nifty tantrum, but compared to Hurley's beauty and
wit, she comes off second best in both categories and would not have
been my first wish. Besides, the Devil owns a trendy nightspot and
drives the stylishly expensive Lamborghini Diablo, and seems to have her
pulse on what's happening in town.</P>
<P>All seven wishes are played out as comedy sketches, with some being
terrible, filled with stereotype gags and dull-witted humor, such as the
one where he becomes the witty author who is well-equipped but learns
that he is gay; some of them do have some spark, like the dumb giant
N.B.A. basketball player with the tiny private part, and the one with
the Colombian drug lord who is married to Alison, but she hates him and
disses him for one of his underlings. Fraser draws great comedy from his
ever-changing facial expressions as he learns he can speak Spanish, and
the best of these is, when he becomes the most sensitive man in the
world who loses Alison to a beach jock, as she can't take his
sensitivity anymore as he cries at how beautiful the sunset is; while
others were too thinly sketched and drew no laughs, such as when he is
President Lincoln.</P>
<P>The film uses the same actors who play Fraser's unfriendly co- workers
as comic characters in all the wish sketches, which adds a feeling of
continuity, but it is played as if this material was more suited for a
revue than a film.</P>
<P>What this film lacked was a real sense of outrageousness, it seemed more
like a benign TV comedy hour program than a satire that goes for
something devilish. It painted too clean a picture of everyone. Every
wish seemed reduntant and doomed to failure because Fraser didn't know
how to be specific when he made his wishes. I think Harold Ramis could
have come up with funnier and less obvious skits, there was a lot to
play around with here that wasn't even attempted. The film went mostly
for the physical humor of Brendan Fraser, who is no Buster Keaton and
can't carry an entire film with his comic antics. The viewer watched him
transform himself cleverly in each skit, but the film wasn't funny
enough for it to sparkle that way, except in a few instances. I think
when you make a remake, it should clearly be better than the other
version or else it seems to me, there is no reason to make a remake.</P>
