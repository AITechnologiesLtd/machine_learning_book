THE RUGRATS MOVIE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>THE RUGRATS MOVIE, being little more than a magnified version of the
television series, will undoubtedly be well received by its fans.  Those
who think that movies should be more than extended length television
shows will likely be disappointed.  And parents of kids younger than 5
or 6 may be shocked to find all the frightening images and gross humor
in an inappropriately rated G movie.  Given the popularity of the series
with the preschool set, the audience is likely to be filled with that
age group.</P>
<P>"Hold on to your diapies, baby, we're goin' in," Tommy Pickles (voiced
by Elizabeth Daily, who is also the new voice for BABE) commands his
diaper wearing brigade in the movie's opening sequence.  To the Indiana
Jones tune, they are recreating in a dream sequence the famous boulder
scene from RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.</P>
<P>The very talky picture is only sporadically funny.  In the film's first
act, the Pickles have a new arrival.  Mrs. Pickles has a new baby called
Dylan, Dil for short.  Get it?  Dil Pickles.</P>
<P>When they go to the maternity ward, there is a large board overhead as
you would find in an airport arrivals lounge.  As the signs flip over,
they announce baby arrivals rather than planes.  The kids in the
audience may not get it, but it is one of the few jokes thrown to the
adults to keep them awake.</P>
<P>Perhaps the movie's funniest scene occurs when the sleep-deprived dad
goes hysterical and whines along with his baby.  The wise mom knows just
the cure.  She grabs a pacifier and sticks it firmly in the Dad's mouth.</P>
<P>Although filled with bright colors, the film's animation has a cheap
two-dimensional look to it as if they did the same slapdash job expected
for a kid's television show.  The backgrounds are almost always static
with only the characters given motion.</P>
<P>The reason that another production company, Pixar, has deservedly won so
much praise for their movies stems first from the imagination of the
storyline with the technology being an important second.  THE RUGRATS
MOVIE fails on both of these measures.  The scary story about young kids
lost in the wilderness has no more originality than one would find in a
weekly, television cartoon series.</P>
<P>Parents have a right to expect that G-rated movies should, without
question or research in advance, be acceptable for all ages.  THE
RUGRATS MOVIE may find parents of little tykes feeling a need to walk
out of the theater.  The list of questionable activities for a G-rated
movie is long, so I'll just touch on a few of them.</P>
<P>The kids are lost in a dark and ominous forest without their parents.
They encounter a drooling wolf with razor sharp teeth that tries to bite
off their heads.  Menacing monkeys attack them in packs.  To be fair,
directors Igor Kovalyov and Norton Virgien put a happy gloss on the
scary images.</P>
<P>Even if your kids have long since been anesthetized to violence, there
is still the issue of the bathroom, or more precisely the poopy, humor.
We have kids peeing in the air to make a rainbow.  Boys look in their
diapers to complain about circumcision.  There is a vomit scene, and the
movie is filled with defecating baby jokes.  One of the characters sums
it up well, "Hey, this is more fun than picking noses."</P>
<P>"I don't like this adventure anymore," Lil tells her twin Phil as their
fortunes turn from bad to worse.  And that is exactly what your
preschoolers may tell you before the ending credits roll.</P>
<P>THE RUGRATS MOVIE runs 1:19.  It is inappropriately rated G and would be
fine for kids older than 5 or 6.  People older than 10 will find little
of interest in the movie.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 9, said that he's always loved the TV show, and this
movie has the same activities so he really liked it.  His favorites were
the Reptar Wagon and the character of Dil.</P>
