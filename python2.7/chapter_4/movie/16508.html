<P>In the 60's, John Frankenheimer was without peer as a director
of taut action films and riveting political thrillers.  His more
memorable films included Seven Days In May, The Manchurian Candidate,
Seconds, and The Birdman Of Alcatraz.  Since the 70's though his
career seems to have stalled with a succession of grim, second rate
thrillers, like French Connection II, Prophecy, 52 Pick Up, and The
Fourth War, that only showed brief glimpses of his true talent.  His
tv career has thrived in the meantime, with a number of critically
acclaimed HBO features.  But now, the 68 year old returns to form with
Ronin, a gutsy post cold war thriller that shows many of today's hip
and flashy MTV inspired younger directors a thing or two about making
tough, stylish action films.</P>
<P>Historically, the ronin were disgraced samurai of feudal Japan
who hired themselves out as bandits or body guards.  In this action
thriller, their modern day counterparts are a group of free lance ex-
spies, former mercenaries and disillusioned cold war warriors, who are
gathered in Paris for a mysterious mission.  They are to snatch a case
from a heavily guarded escort.</P>
<P>But once these experts in the clandestine arts have
successfully stolen the case, they find themselves ensnared in a
labyrinthine web of treachery and murder.  Gregor (Stellan Skarsgard,
from Breaking The Waves, etc) double crosses everyone and makes off
with the case himself, hoping to sell it to the highest bidder.  Sam
(Robert De Niro), a former CIA agent, and Vincent (the wonderfully
droll Jean Reno, from Mission Impossible, etc) join forces to retrieve
the case and uncover the identity of their mysterious employer.</P>
<P>The deft and sinuous plot has been written by J D Zeik,
Richard Weisz and an uncredited David Mamet.  As with both Pulp
Fiction and Robert Aldrich's tough noirish thriller Kiss Me Deadly,
what's actually in the case is never revealed.  The contents are
immaterial; they are what Alfred Hitchcock used to refer to as a
macguffin, a red herring that is irrelevant to the central plot
development.</P>
<P>The tough characters are suitably enigmatic, and we learn
little of their background or motivation.  The performances from the
ensemble international cast are solid, and of an unusually high
calibre for the action genre.  Both De Niro and Reno in particular are
excellent as a pair of cynical former spies, while Natascha McElhone
(from Surviving Picasso, etc) is alluring and mysterious as Dierdre,
their nominal boss.  Ronin also includes appearances from three former
Bond villains - Sean Bean, Jonathan Pryce and Michael Lonsdale - which
adds to its flavour.</P>
<P>Ronin is a tense action thriller that delivers on its promise
with brutal efficiency and energy.  But the highlight of Ronin is
undoubtedly its series of superbly executed car chase sequences, which
eclipse most recent cinematic car chases, and a gun battle in the
streets of Nice that recalls Heat.  Cars race at breakneck speeds
through the tunnels and crowded autobahns of Paris and the narrow,
twisting streets of Nice, leaving a trail of carefully orchestrated
destruction in their wake.</P>
<P>This adrenaline charged and testosterone fuelled film keeps
the audience hooked throughout its numerous twists and turns and
improbabilities.  Frankenheimer directs the material at a slick,
bruising pace that rarely lets up.  Ronin is indeed a welcome return
to form for one of Hollywood's most influential premier action
directors!</P>
