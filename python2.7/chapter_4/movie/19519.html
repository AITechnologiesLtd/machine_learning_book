<P>The Blair Witch Project will go down in the books as one of independent
filmmaking's biggest triumphs because of the extent which it has broken
through to the mainstream. Not only has it gotten an inordinate amount
of unabashedly positive reviews from critics but in its first few weeks
of limited release it has also achieved commercial success of gargantuan
proportions. Whether this $20,000 project can attain box-office bliss by
studio standards remains to be seen, but, if nothing else, it's already
a cult hit.</P>
<P>Popularity is fine, but is the movie any good? That's unrelated to its
Hollywood status and it demands more thoughtful discussion. It's
certainly original -- I've never seen anything like it. But does it have
any cinematic merit? Is it junky fun or is it a serious movie? This is
one of those films, I think, where the answers to all of these questions
are solely in the eye of the beholder -- and that's okay. What seemed to
me clearly true, however, is that this is no masterpiece of American
cinema: it is far too flawed to attain that status even though many fans
and even some critics, who have gone off the deep end, insist the
opposite.</P>
<P>Three student filmmakers -- Heather, Josh and Mike go on a hike into
Maryland woods to film a documentary on the Blair Witch, a local urban
legend. They disappear. A year later their footage is found. The Blair
Witch Project is that footage and nothing but that footage. They film
the whole trip, from the interviews they do with people in a Maryland
town to the hike. When one of them loses the all-important map they are
lost in the middle of nowhere with something mysterious and frightening
on their tail.</P>
<P>Inevitable tensions escalate within the group. Josh and Mike are furious
at Heather for refusing to turn the camera off and and focusing on their
dire situation. Heather and Josh are furious at Mike for apparently
kicking the map into a creek. Their desperation and refusal to cooperate
with each other threatens to destroy them. So, evidently, does the Blair
Witch.</P>
<P>The Blair Witch Project is constantly creepy and occasionally unnerving
but up until the gut-wrenching climax its format prevents it from being
genuinely scary and even then it seems to dilute it somewhat. It's a
grand idea -- making a movie solely filmed with a hand-held camera by
its characters -- but it has its drawbacks. All too often it's slightly
hard to tell what's going on because, understandably, the camera doesn't
stay steady when the people behind it are in hysterics. It's very
difficult to argue that being sure of what's happening is scarier than a
menace unknown, which is why something like The Game or the best of
Hitchcock's stuff is always more frightening than any slasher movie.
Tense anticipation makes the "boo" moment anticlimactic. Still, when the
viewer is utterly confused (which, luckily, happens only in a few
instances here) horror films tend to have less effect.</P>
<P>The dialogue, much of it improvised (the directors sent the actors alone
into the woods to film the movie), surprisingly comes off as realistic.
It's not particularly witty but it seems to resemble what real people
would utter in that kind of situation; it never feels fabricated or
manipulative. Profanity abounds but hey -- would you expect anything
less from three mightily pissed-off young college students?</P>
<P>Some will insist that even adequate execution of such brilliantly
original idea is enough to make this movie a milestone in cinema;
especially horror cinema. I disagree strenuously. It's enjoyable stuff
but folks, it's nothing to write home about. The climax approaches
terrifying and it contains many suspenseful, well-made sequences but by
the same token The Blair Witch Project is inconsistent, confusing and
unevenly paced. In a word (three, actually, but never mind): hit and
miss.</P>
<P>This nifty little film gets off to a slow start (to the extent that is
possible in a film running barely over 80 minutes) and drags through
some of its first half. But when it's going, it's good. Crafty,
visionary and enjoyable, this may not be a masterpiece, but it's a
refreshing digression from the pretension that indie filmmaking tends to
represent and from the horror movie clichés that make this movie's
companions so dull.
