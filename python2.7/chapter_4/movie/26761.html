<PRE>                              DESECRATION
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Indie horror is always a hit-and-miss affair, but true splatter
fans will find a lot to like in Dante Tomaselli's Desecration, a truly
bizarre tale of a boy (Danny Lopes) who accidentally kills a nun and
then suffers the otherworldly consequences.</P>
<P>     As cinematic oddities go, Desecration ranks right up there with
Eraserhead, rarely making much sense but creeping you out every chance
it gets.  Made on a $150,000 budget, the film has a lot of big-budget
flourishes made possible by clever camerawork and odd lighting coupled
with good sound effects.  Does it work as a story?  No, but it is
genuinely creepy and would probably work better as atmosphere for your
Halloween party, what with its demonic nuns and clown-men, than anything
else.</P>
<P>     In many ways, Desecration reminded me of the original Phantasm,
long on cheese but leaving you scared to death -- of all things -- of a
metal ball.  You'll never look at nuns the same way again.</P>
<P>     The DVD also includes an excerpt from the original short film of
Desecration, which, if it's possible, is even weirder than the feature.</P>
