<P>The last time he directed a screen adaptation of a best-selling book -
Robert James Waller's "The Bridges of Madison County" - Clint Eastwood was
working with a slender piece of fiction that required extensive reworking
and fleshing-out. With John Berendt's "Midnight In The Garden Of Good and
Evil," he faces exactly the opposite dilemma: You need not have read the
book to suspect that, even with its generous two-and-a-half hour running
time, the movie is a severely abridged version of a longer, richer story.
That said, it should also be noted that much of what Eastwood has managed to
capture is deliciously decadent, and it's crowned by a smashing performance
by the always-mesmerizing Kevin Spacey as Jim Williams, the story's pivotal
figure.
Even amongst the numerous eccentrics who populate sultry Savannah, Williams
is a true character, a suave antiques dealer who's amassed a fortune in the
past decade and isn't shy about showing off his money. "I'm nouveau-riche,"
he tells Town & Country magazine reporter John Kelso (John Cusack), "but
then, it's the riche that counts."
But in the shadows of his lavish lifestyle lurks a slightly sordid secret
life involving young hustlers and drugs. When Williams wraps up one of his
sumptuous Christmas parties by shooting a young man he's been arguing with,
he simultaneously blows off the door of his closet as well, and the
skeletons come tumbling out.
New Yorker Kelso, who's in town to cover the annual holiday bash, finds
himself perversely enchanted by Williams and the sundry other locals he
encounters in the Georgia town. "It's like "Gone With The Wind" on
mescaline!" he enthuses to his editor.
That proves to be only a slight exaggeration, what with a voodoo priestess,
a local lunatic who keeps horseflies tied to his shirt, and a devoted
servant who still tends to the ghost of a long-dead dog, all walking the
streets. Topping them all is The Lady Chablis (played by, uh, herself), a
showgirl who looks like Mary Wilson, talks like Cher, and behaves like a
less-inhibited Madonna.
Each of these people is intriguing, but "Midnight" can't find the time to
give each his/her due. Remember those "Want to know more?" buttons that
surfaced throughout "Starship Troopers"? You'll be wishing they'd pop up
here.
Eastwood packs many amusing and eerie moments into "Midnight," elegantly
evoking both the wearying heat and the wild heart of Savannah, and treating
his cast of eccentrics with a certain degree of dignity. By this time
though, he ought to have learned that nepotism doesn't pay: Casting his son
Kyle in "Honkytonk Man" handicapped that film, and putting daughter Alison
in "Midnight" is a similar mistake.
While by no means a disaster along the lines of Sofia Coppola in "The
Godfather III," Ms. Eastwood doesn't demonstrate much allure as the siren
who puts the make on Kelso; the part seems to cry out for an Ashley Judd or
a Mira Sorvino instead.</P>
