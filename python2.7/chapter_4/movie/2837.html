Poland 1984</PRE>
<P>     Antek is dead, but his ghost lingers on to watch his wife Ulla and
their son Jacek grieve for him.  The parallels with Kieslowski's later
film BLUE are striking.  Both films focus on a woman whose husband has
died in a car and who leaves behind unfinished business--in BLUE, the
"Song for the Unification of Europe," in NO END, the legal defence of a
strike organiser (it is 1984, and Poland is under martial law)--which
his wife initially resists but eventually becomes involved with.  She
discovers evidence of her husband's lover.  She befriends another
woman.  And the music that dominates NO END is the moving funeral march
that is attributed to the fictitious composer "van den Budenmayer" in
BLUE.</P>
<P>     The treatment of this subject in NO END is grittier, more
realistic, less optimistic.  There is no suggestion that Ulla will find
fulfilment in her new-found liberty.  All struggle seems futile--sex
is joyless, even hypnosis cannot make Ulla forget, and even though the
striker is freed, everyone knows that this is because he gave in to the
system instead of fighting it.</P>
<P>     In BLUE, the presence of Julie's husband Patrice is hinted at
through Julie's memories of his music.  In NO END, Antek's ghost looks
on unhappily as people's lives unravel.  The title may refer to the
unfinality of death, but it also seems to suggest that the painful
struggle of life is unending.  This is the most fatalistic of
Kieslowski's films.</P>
