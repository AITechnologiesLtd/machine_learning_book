<P>
Firstly, "Twin Falls Idaho" goes for the too cute punning movie title,
sort of along the lines of "Good Will Hunting" being side-swiped by a
certain David Lynch TV series.  Once we get over this fact, groaning if
necessary, we have a neat little indie movie with a certain Lynchian
spirit of the ordinary grotesque; I don't think the title's allusion to
"Twin Peaks" is coincidental.  Ignore it's occassional obviousness,
like we see in the title: the film is worth seeing.</P>
<P>The basic plot of the film involves an archetypal hooker with a heart
of gold, named Penny in this case, going to a seedy hotel to meet her
next john.  This john isn't Richard Gere, come to rescue her from her
troubles; this john turns out to be the conjoined Falls twins.
Freaky.</P>
<P>Certainly Penny thought so, as she panics and leaves as they're in the
bathroom politely getting her a glass of water.  Realizing her purse
was left in the room, she sheepishly goes back to claim it, and finds
that the twins are busy having a quiet birthday celebration for
themselves.  With this sad scene, we begin the strange friendship that
turns into a love story between Penny and Blake, the stronger of the
twins.</P>
<P>Here and there, the "twins" and "pairs" images and puns are a little
strong and unnecessary.  Yes, we get the picture: the twins are a
particular entity, and separation would destroy them.  Perhaps the most
heavy-handed image is when the twins are in public, drying to reach
their hotel room during daylight: they sit down, exhausted with their
flight, and a crowd gathers around them to take pictures of this
spectacle of Siamese twins.  Yes, the bars represent how zoo-like the
scene is, and how the twins are treated by most of us as animals, not
humans.  We get it.  </P>
<P>Along with the love story, a love story in which the two lovers can
never be alone, the film develops the twisted family relationship of
the twins.  Their mother abandoned them; they are brothers that can
never be apart; and so on.  The notion of solitude and the unending
lack thereof is, of course, a central theme.  The movie is primarily a
series of quiet conversations between the twins and Penny -- the twins
themselves speak to each other in whispers -- exploring these ideas.
The set-piece exception is a Halloween party Penny takes them to: the
twins are simply "in costume" there, and can move around in the open
without stares.  There, of course, is another of the heavy-handed
images, where another pair of costumed Siamese "twins" get fed up with
each other and split up.</P>
<P>Ultimately the story moves in this direction.  In the film's last act,
Francis, the weaker twin, falls mortally ill, and it becomes clear that
the twins will have to undergo their own separation.  The split is
final: Francis won't survive the operation.  The dreamy sequence
showing this works well, far better than any of the other more obvious
symbols the film tosses at us.  I feel that it's the climax of the
film, though there is a nice, bucolic coda that follows, tying up the
lose ends.</P>
<P>Overall, despite my harping on the film's occasional heavy-handedness,
I liked the film.  Certainly it's different from the usual,
action-laden summer flick.  Further, the twins are each fully realized
individuals, nothing like stock evil-twin-good-twins or
angry-at-world-misfits from Central Screenwriting.  Real people.  And
the pace is slow:  it allows you to savor the characters the Polish
brothers have created here, the appreciate the strangeness of the
situation.</P>
