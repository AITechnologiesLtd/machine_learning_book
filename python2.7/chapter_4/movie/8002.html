<PRE>                          PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4 = good)
1985, PG, 90 minutes [1 hour, 30 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Paul Reubens (Pee Wee Herman), Elizabeth Daily (Dottie), Mark
Holton (Francis), Diane Salinger (Simone), written by Paul Reubens, Phil
Hartman, Michael Varhol, produced by Robert Shapiro, Richard Gilbert
Abramson, directed by Tim Burton.</P>
<P>"Pee Wee's Big Adventure" is a live action cartoon farce that epitomizes
stupidity... and I  liked it. It's the story of an immature, idiot manchild,
and because he is so ridiculously silly, it makes for brilliant comedy.</P>
<P>Paul Reubens stars as Pee Wee Herman, an adult with a 4-year-old boy's face
and personality. Pee Wee does not live in the real world; his house is a
cross between an amusement park, a funhouse, and a huge toy store. He has an
"Absent-Minded Professor"-type device that makes his breakfast for him while
he wraps Scotch tape around his head in the bathroom. This opening scene is
only the first of countless sight gags, and what's amazing is they actually
work! </P>
<P>The zaniness continues throughout the film with one of the best scenes
occurring when Pee Wee opens his secret storage facility for his bicycle
(which looks like the kind of bike the guys from "Mission: Impossible" would
have used as kids). The music becomes overly dramatic and spotlights and
dramatic camera angles are used to highlight the bike's gizmos and gadgets
and its importance to Pee Wee. </P>
<P>But where there is good there must be evil, and we get the typical rich,
snobby "kid" Francis (Holton), who wants Pee Wee's bike more than anything.
As Pee Wee goes shopping for x-ray glasses and boomerang bow ties (to match
the tight grey suit he always wears), he is shocked to find his bike missing
from the robotic clown he chained it to. </P>
<P>And so we get the typical road trip comedy as our small hero tries to
hitchhike 2,000 miles to San Antonio, Texas because a phony psychic told him
his bike is in the basement of the Alamo. First he is picked up by an escape
convict, who kicks him out after he drives the car over a cliff, then he is
picked up by an eccentric old truck driver who turns out to be a ghost. And
if that wasn't enough, he must escape the 300-pound boyfriend of a friendly
waitress, and is almost killed again when he accidentally messes with a biker
gang.</P>
<P>Although most of the jokes stem from Pee Wee's wild antics and zany sight
gags, there is a good amount of witty satire here. In fact, the film uses its
childish attitude to make for some of the funniest satire I've ever seen.
There are many "goofs" throughout this film where crew and/or equipment is
visible, but since there is such a "don't care" attitude to everything, it's
funny and quite original.</P>
<P>"Pee Wee's Big Adventure" isn't anything genius, but it is very funny. There
is a laugh-out-loud joke a few times a minute and most of them work (unlike
most commercial comedies). Maybe it's likable because it speaks to the child
inside of us, or maybe we just like to see stupidity once in a while. </P>
