<PRE>Rating: * out of  * * * * </PRE>
<P>Rated: R for strong violence, language, drug use, nudity, and some sexuality. </P>
<P>Starring: Wesley Snipes, Anne Archer, Michael Chaykin, Donald Sutherland, 
Marie Matiko. </P>
<PRE>Running Time: 117 minutes </PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Christian Duguay </PRE>
<P>I've never fully understood Wesley Snipes's career. He has his ups and downs, 
but mostly the downs. His best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that 
movie was entitled "Blade". He has had his typical action movies, "Boiling 
Point", "Passenger 57", but his new movie "The Art of War" should just be 
called "Rising Sun 2: The Art of War" cause basically it's a semi-remake of 
the same plot, with a different cast, and forced to be a ridiculously 
unbelievable thriller, that is high on style and low on substance. </P>
<P>Wesley Snipes plays a James Bondish type secret agent working for the U.N. 
After a chinese ambassador is killed, he is on the track of the killer, 
trying to find out who it is, how it happened, where the killer was, and what 
to do. Anne Archer plays his "boss" type person of the U.N. and she has hired 
Snipes to track down the killer. Well Snipes is mistakenly framed as the 
killer, and is now an outlaw, kidnapping a Chinese woman with him, and having 
her help him along the way. All this leads to a finale that is so dumb, and 
so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb, and the stunts, dialogue and acting 
all ruin this movie. </P>
<P>Wesley Snipes isn't one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the 
character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie 
before. The only good role Snipes has really had was in 1998's "Blade". I 
walked into "The Art Of War" expecting a good, high octane thriller, and all 
I got was a pile of mush. The only real 'good' thing the movie has is action, 
and plenty of it, but I noticed it is badly filmed, the camera is so shaky 
you cannot even tell what is going on. The ending finale is so worthless and 
pitiful, that it even tries to mock "The Matrix", laughably funny, it is 
undeniably stupid. </P>
<P>Christian Duguay's direction is also not that great. His camera angles and 
sense of style are all in place, but sadly his lighting and editing are all 
badly done. Even the whole "Matrix" ending wasn't even good. The stunts and 
action are badly filmed, and badly choreographed. His placing of the 
characters, and the assination of the Chinese Ambassador, and the plotting of 
the movie are so predictable and laughable, that it just takes all the fun 
out of the entire movie. Anne Archer who is usually good in her roles, turns 
in a horrible job here. She is sour, downbeat, and dreadfully dull with her 
forced dialogue, and dumb moves. Even Donald Sutherland as a co-star can't 
save this movie from being a bust. </P>
<P>So for an overall opinion: "The Art of War" is a total waste of time. It's 
not entertaining, nor exciting, or even action packed. It is a pointless 
movie, and makes absolutely no sense at all. If you really want to see a good 
version of "The Art of War", rent the Wesley Snipes and Sean Connery action 
vehicle of the same kind "Rising Sun", it isn't a great film either, but at 
least it's better than this. </P>
