<PRE>TRUE LIVES OF THE COMMON PEOPLE</PRE>
<P>Jarvis Cocker of Pulp once said that he wrote Common People after
noticing Mike Leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling
that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the
well-off. Maybe it's a classic case of displacement : it's easier to
see Jarvis' own lyrics (obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the
wall) as a fetishization of lowlife, rather than Leigh's films. But
it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of
working-class characters don't make for a guarantee of 'authenticity',
let alone a good film. It's the triumph of SECRETS & LIES, then, that
it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a
probing of just what it means to seek 'authenticity' and honesty in
everyday lives.</P>
<P>Following her adopted mother's funeral, Hortense, a young
black optometrist, sets out to find her birth mother, and is disturbed
to find out that she is white. It is Cynthia, a factory worker who
lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter Roxanne.
Cynthia's younger brother Maurice is a successful photographer who has
not seen his sister for ages, largely because of his wife's animosity
towards her. Hortense calls up Cynthia, who initially breaks down in
tears and refuses to see her. But their mutually suspicious meeting
gives way to a warm friendship eventually. Cynthia invites Hortense to
come along to a party, which Maurice is hosting...</P>
<P>SECRETS & LIES has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one
character puts it, "Best to tell the truth, isn't it? That way nobody
gets hurt.". But if the film delivers much more than a trite message,
it's because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly
truths, even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke
us.</P>
<P>Hence, Cynthia's difficulty with acknowledging (first to herself, then
to others) that Hortense is her daughter. One of her first reactions
to seeing Hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever "been with a
black man", before a long-suppressed memory seizes her. At the party,
Cynthia's pretense that Hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to
ever more convoluted lies, as agonizing as they are funny.</P>
<P>Little lies seep into every corner, like Maurice pretending that he's
"just dropping by" when he visits Cynthia after much deliberation.
Maurice's job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side
comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that Maurice coaxes
to smile, a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring
and argue about his spectacles. One of the most startling images is of
a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs
the photo to look "as bad as possible" to collect insurance money, yet
the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies
behind the scars.</P>
<P>There are occasionally hilarious moments, as when Cynthia attempts to
give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception, "I've got a
Dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs"; or when Cynthia stares
at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells Roxanne, "If you've got
it, flaunt it, is what I say."</P>
<P>As played by Brenda Blethyn, Cynthia comes close to being a
caricature, with her nervous, somewhat disconnected way of talking.
But she's really just right for the role of someone who inspires
sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her, precisely
because she's so needy of love, perhaps. Indeed, the whole cast gives
warmly rounded, detailed performances. The script was developed partly
through improvisations, and the fusion of cast, script and director
shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the
same time, and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout.
In a very different way, but also using a long single shot, the scene
of Hortense and Cynthia's first meeting in a lonely caf=8A achieves a
touching intensity, all the more for their reticence and unspoken
feelings.</P>
<P>The film's climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out
in Ibsen-esque revelations, and everybody hugging each other - is the
one thing that seems false about this film. However, it's a film that
truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the
character's lives. When Cynthia says near the end, This is the life,
innit?, you get the sense that, following the cynicism of his last
film NAKED, Leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all,
without comforting illusions.</P>
<P>THE FLYING INKPOT's rating system:
 * Wait for the video.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
