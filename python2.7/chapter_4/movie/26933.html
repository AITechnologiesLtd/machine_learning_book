<PRE>Identity Crisis
Unbreakable</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Hmmm. Well, I absolutely loved "The Sixth Sense." In fact, I did back flips
over that film. But M. Night Shyamalan's newest effort, "Unbreakable" failed
to ignite that same enthusiasm.</P>
<P>This is still an interesting film complete with scenes to marvel over
sharing screen time with the not-so-great moments. Generally speaking, too
much time is spent in the set up and not enough on the punch.</P>
<P>I've said before of "The Sixth Sense" that I didn't need the ending kicker
twist - I still would have loved that film. Not so of "Unbreakable" which
titillates unevenly like glitter in a murky stream. The opening shot between
seats is clever, but becomes tiresome. In fact, the whole first act could
have used a shot in the arm. Willis, Penn and Woodward are strong,
believable and likable. But, I've seen Jackson give better performances
(though the actor playing the younger Jackson does a fine job).</P>
<P>I particularly enjoyed the meaty sequence just prior to the end; more of the
like was needed as lead-ins to it. Perhaps they were written, but cut for
time. Too bad, cuts in the first act would have made for a better film.</P>
<P>Overall, the finished product is lumpy - a way-cool idea that is no doubt
way-difficult to translate to film. Shyamalan makes a respectable attempt in
"Unbreakable," but lands shy of the excellence he'd achieved in his earlier
work</P>
