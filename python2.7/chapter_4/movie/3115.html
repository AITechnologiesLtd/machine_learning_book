<PRE>                                  FORREST GUMP
                       A film review by Gregory N. Bond
                        Copyright 1993 Gregory N. Bond</PRE>
<P>[Old news to 'merkins, but it's about to open locally]</P>
<P>Stars: Tom "Philadelphia" Hanks, Robyn "The Princess Bride" Wright</P>
<P>     This was previewed for local audiences on the weekend, prior to
official release this week.  The film is basically story of Forrest
Gump (Hanks), a borderline moron with a perfect soul, who rises from a
tough childhood to become football star, war hero, world pingpong
champion, shrimp fisherman and millionaire.  Through it all Gump is the
anchor for the soul of Jenny (Wright), an abused child and a deeply
troubled woman, and "Lieutenant Dan," the officer Gump rescues from his
fate to die in glory in Vietnam, leaving him a bitter cripple.  Gump is
also remarkably unaffected by all that life has brought him: "So I went
to the Whitehouse--AGAIN--and met the President--AGAIN" in a very
ho-hum voice.</P>
<P>     The story is told initially as a series of flashbacks, with Gump
sitting at a bus stop, relating his life story to a series of interested
or incredulous listeners.  The later part of the film takes a more
conventional narrative form.</P>
<P>     The whole saga of Forrest Gump the person is set against the saga
of America the nation, centered mainly in the 60s and 70s.  The most
fascinating thing about the film is the brilliant use of computer
graphics (attested to in the long list of technicians in the credits)
to completely seamlessly merge action from the film with the archival
footage of the events of the era.  Hence you have Gump meeting various
Presidents, shaking hands, etc; the Vietnam rallies with hundreds of
thousands of people in Washington imperceptibly merging with the
characters.  (In fact, it was not until the credits rolled that I
realised this was real footage, not just look-alikes.  I suspect some
of these film clips are much more famous in the US than they are out
here.)  Even the Vietnam scenes are some of the best (and most
frightening) war footage I have seen, and the serious digital sound in
the Russell Cinemas certainly aided the impact.  (The weakest part of
the computer graphics also occurs in Vietnam--a Napalm attack by F-4
Phantoms had a very matte'd look.)</P>
<P>     In all the incidents, the basic humanity and downright niceness of
Gump is used as a telling contrast to those around him, even the best
intentioned.  The man is *way* too perfect.  A Saint.  Mother Teresa is
nothing on him.  Despite a character that could be a major pain in the
arse, Gump is someone you feel for, sympathise with, and by golly you
wish you could meet him.  Hanks handles a very demanding role very
well, the script is excellent, and Wright (who obviously appreciates
the chance to show she is an actress, not just a princess) is also
excellent.</P>
<P>     The film is full of humor, the writing excellent, the acting
great, the effects stunningly seamless.  A lot of fun.</P>
