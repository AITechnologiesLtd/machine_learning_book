<PRE>                                   TANK GIRL
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Lori Petty, America's number one Madonna wannabe, is back in action
as TANK GIRL, a comic book character come to life.  Actually, the whole
movie is a comic book come to life.  Live action is spliced with still
shots of comic strip panels and some full-motion animation, so if you get
bored with the live-action part of this picture (and you probably will),
at least you can look at the cartoons.</P>
<P>     Not that these bits are any more entertaining, but at least they're a
change of pace from the dull storyline.  The filmmakers use them any time
there is the possibility for a neat special effect or some potential for
plot development, so they don't waste any money on actually interesting
footage, instead copping out to some goofball crayon scribbling.</P>
<P>     The thin plot goes like this:  the earth is dried up, Malcolm
McDowell is the bad guy, Lori Petty is Tank Girl, and she wants to kill
him.  McDowell barely saves this picture from being a complete failure,
reprising his classic psycho bad guy role in fine form.  His support is
terrible, from Ice-T as a mutant kangaroo, to Petty herself, who I was
hoping would get killed by the movie's end.</P>
<P>     No such luck.  Petty ruins this movie with her bad acting, inability
to crack jokes, and the ability to look stupid no matter what she is
doing.  I guess that was the point, but I can't understand why it needed
to be made.  Recommended only to fans of Petty:  both of them.</P>
