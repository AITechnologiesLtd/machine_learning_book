<P>Reading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy, "Analyze 
This," I asked myself, "how could this miss?" Robert De Niro ("Taxi 
Driver," "Raging Bull"), Billy Crystal ("City Slickers"), Lisa Kudrow 
("The Opposite of Sex"), and Director Harold Ramis ("National Lampoon's 
Vacation"). These are usually reliable filmmakers (well, okay, Crystal 
has been in a sizable slump lately), and tellingly, the first half-hour 
of "Analyze This" was very funny. Unfortunately, as the running time 
ticked away, I began to think that the first thirty minutes had, 
unbeknownst to me, been rewound and were being replayed another 
two-and-a-half times. The film has obtained a clever premise, but does 
not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more 
and more repetitive until I finally stopped enjoying or caring about 
what was happening on the screen.</P>
<P>Middle-aged psychoanalyst Ben Sobel's (Billy Crystal) life is finally 
going very well. Although he has never gotten along with his own 
uncaring parents, especially his father, who is also a psychiatrist, Ben 
has an easy-going teenage son (Kyle Sabihy) and is about to travel down 
to Miami to get married to his TV news reporter girlfriend, Laura (Lisa 
Kudrow). In little but a flash, however, Ben suddenly sees his plans 
ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently 
gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro), who 
desperately wants counseling, even though he himself won't even admit to 
having anxiety attacks. Ben tries to help Paul, mostly so he will get 
him off his back, but the plot gets more complicated when Paul follows 
Ben to his wedding, which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his 
death. It seems to Ben that no matter what he does, Paul Vitti will not
 go away, and the more they become involved, the more Ben's potentially 
happy life gets into danger.</P>
<P>"Analyze This" has a few laughs sprinkled throughout (mostly in the 
first half), but I always had the nagging thought that what director 
Ramis and writers Peter Tolan, Ramis, and Kenneth Lonergan had done was 
thought of one joke (Robert De Niro lightly spoofing his serious past 
mafia roles, while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic Billy 
Crystal) and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 
106-minute running time. Admittedly, De Niro is very funny here (and I 
can't remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe 
him), and Crystal is in top-form, but the whole movie is weighed down 
directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them, including 
a substantial plotline.</P>
<P>Since "Analyze This" bills not one, not two, but three writers, you'd 
think that they would have been able to work together to fix the 
noticably large flaws, but they must have all been on auto-pilot. One of 
the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way 
the movie deals with the supporting characters, all of which have next 
to nothing to do and aren't even given multi-dimensional characters to 
attempt to develop. Coming off of her Oscar-caliber work in two of last 
year's best films, "Clockwatchers" and "The Opposite of Sex," Lisa 
Kudrow's throwaway "girlfriend" role is an incredible step down. Sure, 
Kudrow's fellow "Friend" Jennifer Aniston did the same thing two weeks 
ago in "Office Space," but at least we got to spend a little time with 
Aniston. Kudrow, meanwhile, mostly just stands around, no doubt 
wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place. 
Chazz Palminteri, as rival gangster Primo, fares even worse, in a role 
that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character. Finally, 
Molly Shannon (rising film star and cast member on "Saturday Night 
Live") has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning 
as one of Crystal's patients and then completely disappears. Too bad, 
considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have 
the abilities to support De Niro and Crystal.</P>
<P>Once "Analyze This" approached its second wedding scene leaving Kudrow's 
Laura standing alone at the altar once again, I had become thoroughly 
annoyed by where the story had gone, and had mostly lost respect for the 
character we were supposed to sympathize with the most, Ben. Afterwards, 
the climactic scene with Ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the 
depressed Paul, became a real laugh-free dead-zone, losing its last 
remaining comic punches. "Analyze This" proves that talent can certainly 
help any film out, but when the written material isn't up to their 
level, what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air.</P>
