<PRE>Ingredients: Fate</PRE>
<P>Synopsis: 
NEXT STOP WONDERLAND is a pleasant, independent, romance movie which
explores the idea of fate in romantic searching. Basically, a gal and a
guy (who are unknown to each other) are fated to get together and become
soulmates, but they keep narrowly missing bumping into each other
throughout the movie, until guess what happens? </P>
<P>The lady is a nurse named Erin (Hope Davis) whose activist boyfriend has
just left her. The man is a nice guy named Alan (Alan Gelfant) who is
burning the midnight oil studying to be a marine biologist, but comes
from a family business of plumbing. Both are attractive, middle class
types, living around the Boston area near the Wonderland train station.
The background music is soft and Brazilian.</P>
<P>Opinion:
If your romance life has ever gone down the tubes - - say, you've just
been dumped (or duped) by a potential boyfriend or girlfriend and end up
sitting alone in a theater watching a movie - - you'll understand the
humor and appeal of NEXT STOP WONDERLAND, which makes subtle
observations about people looking for love and advocates the notion that
fate has predestined a partner for us all. It's just a matter of
accidentally bumping into them on a train or something.</P>
<P>Unlike the tired formula of "girl meets boy; girl loses boy; destiny
throws them back together" NEXT STOP WONDERLAND  is an exploration of
the myriad coincidences and all the little near misses that happen
BEFORE the momentous "girl meets boy" in the first place.</P>
<P>Bucking this year's embarrassing trend of pairing old guys with romantic
partners less than half their age (Ernest Borgnine with Jenny McCarthy
in BASEKETBALL; Nicholson with Hunt, et cetera) instead of with normal
ladies, Hope Davis and Alan Gelfant do an excellent job as the people
who are oblivious to what fate has in store for them. In the movie she's
29 and he's 35. </P>
