<P>     "The Best Man" is a potboiler told with inoffensive slickness and
dependable moral values, and peopled with an attractive ensemble cast.  Its
paperback plot involves Harper (Taye Diggs), whose first novel is about to
be published as he heads for New York to be best man at his best friend's
wedding.  Advance copies are already circulating among the old college pals
who are the core of the wedding party.  Skeletons come tumbling out of
closets as his friends recognize themselves and the things they did in
college thinly disguised in Harper's autobiographical fiction.  Since one
of the things he did was sleep with the bride (Monica Calhoun), and since
the groom (Morris Chestnut) is Lance, a monster running back for the New
York Giants, this ill-timed early sampling of his roman-a-clef is
particularly awkward for Harper, although the alert viewer will be
wondering what the hell he thought the effect of his revelations would be
on his pals if they'd surfaced after the wedding.</P>
<P>First time writer/director Malcolm D. Lee has a terrible weakness for
exposition in the early scenes (which is where exposition traditionally
rears its ugly head.)  "Oprah wants my new unpublished novel *Unfinished
Business*" Harper sings out to his girlfriend Robin (Sanaa Lathan) as he
comes in the door.  When Lance is introduced, Lee gives us a long closeup
of the cross hanging around his neck, to establish his credentials as a
Christian running back, which we will find out anyway soon enough.</P>
<P>But once you get by the exposition, the talented and beautiful cast of
young African-American actors takes over and delivers a story of passions
and friendships and self-discovery that, while far from original, still
makes itself agreeable and satisfying.  Taye Diggs, the hunk from "How
Stella Got Her Groove Back" whose career is justifiably in meteoric rise,
smiles his jaw-to-jaw perfect smile and takes his shirt off and throws in
some good acting to boot.  There's no letdown with the other actors, with
the exception of Melissa DeSousa's gratingly bitchy Shelby, and
particularly good are Harold Perrineau as the sweetly unassertive Murch and
Terrence Howard as the sly, troublemaking Quentin.  There are no white
characters, which seems a little contrived in a group so pointedly
mainstream.  </P>
