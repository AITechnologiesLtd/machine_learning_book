<P>STOP MAKING SENSE, the 1984 Talking Heads movie, is a masterpiece of
the concert film genre. Conceived for the stage by lead singer David
Byrne, and directed by Jonathan Demme (Silence of the Lambs,
Philadelphia, and Swimming to Cambodia), the film is a visionary
presentation of stage performance, sound, rhythm, choreography, and
soul.</P>
<P>The film begins when Byrne, wearing a gray suit and impeccably white
sneakers, walks onto the barren center stage and sets a boom box down
on the floor. "Hi. I've got a tape I want to play," he says, as if the
crowd consisted of three friends sitting on his living room couch. As
the opening beats of "Psycho Killer" emerge from the tape player, the
camera slowly rises from Byrne's tapping sneaker to his guitar, and
then up to his head, which bobs hypnotically to the music.</P>
<P>STOP MAKING SENSE contains well-edited footage from three concerts. It
eschews elaborate sets, long-winded speeches, and special effects, and
relies instead on Demme's minimalist camera skills and the band's
considerable performing capabilities. Three of the band
members--Byrne, bassist Tina Weymouth, and drummer Chris
Frantz--attended the Rhode Island School of Design, which may be why
the set looks so good.</P>
<P>After the first song, during which the boom box is Byrne's only
accompaniment, Weymouth enters the stage and joins Bryne in a spare,
beautiful rendition of "Heaven" (whose haunting refrain is "Heaven is
a place where nothing ever happens"). One new band member arrrives
with every song, so that the film builds with rhythmic intensity.</P>
<P>Demme's pace, and his use of light and color (deep blues and reds),
reminded me of Stanley Kubrick, who displayed similar skills in his
masterpiece, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. In STOP MAKING SENSE, Demme
includes shots of black-clad stagehands wheeling pieces of the set
onto the stage. The cumbersome metal objects, which float serenely
through hazy backlighting, resemble the ships that drift through space
in Kubrick's austere epic.</P>
<P>The relationship between the core musicians of the Talking Heads, who
are white, and the musicians who perform with them, who are black, is
fraught with interesting contrasts and tensions. In many ways, the
band draws its energy from the intersection of a variety of
cultures. The Talking Heads temper punk, soul, avant-garde design
aesthetics, and new-wave style with a nicely skewed sense of irony. As
he dances through the show in white sneakers, Byrne forms a bridge
over a wide variety of cultural gaps. The only weak spot in the film
comes when Byrne steps off the stage to let the remaining band members
(the Tom Tom Club) perform--without his vision, the sound is just
ordinary.</P>
<P>The performers have a great deal of fun with one another. At one point
in the movie, Byrne turns to face the two background singers. He
smiles, and starts to imitate their dance step. Without missing a
beat, one singer begins to strum an air guitar in imitation of
him. It's just one of the many moments of pure exuberance that grace
this film.</P>
<P>Most of that exuberance is conveyed through dance--these musicians
know how to move. Watch all of them dance--especially the backing
vocalists (Ednah Holt and Lynn Mabry), the guitarist (Alex Weir), and
the percussionist (Steven Scales)--and your eyes will be dazzled, your
feet will start to tap. Watch Bernie Worrell (of
Parliament/Funkadelic) swivel his head as he adds dollops of funk to
the proceedings. Watch Tina Weymouth swing her knees and
shoulders. Watch Scales, who personifies the movie's energy, cheer on
the crowd. But above all, watch David Byrne, who seems to dwell in the
eye of a dance hurricane.  Whether he's slithering like a charmed
snake, stumbling like a confused professor, or hanging his arms like a
crucified office worker, Byrne's movements are precise and hypnotic.</P>
<P>In the end, however, it's the choreography (the coordination of music
and movement), rather than the dancing alone, that makes STOP MAKING
SENSE such a treat. One shouldn't forget that this movie was carefully
molded, that it was crafted from the footage of three separate shows;
it wasn't just cobbled together without thought. There's someone
moving in almost every frame of the film, and Demme's camera is rarely
still--he's always approaching or circling or panning. There are
limits to a concert film, to be sure, and I'm certain that this movie
will appeal most to people already interested in the Talking
Heads. But fanhood is not a prerequisite because this is more than
just another concert film: it's a celebration of manic energy, a
tribute to the joy of performance.</P>
