<PRE>HALLOWEEN: H2O
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1998) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        If I've learned something in twenty years as a moviegoer, it's 
that no matter how many times Hollywood has beaten a dead horse, 
there can always be another unwarranted sequel. In the late '80s, we 
hoped HALLOWEEN 5 would be the last. Then came the even more 
dreadful sixth installment in 1995; now, for the original movie's 
twentieth anniversary, out comes HALLOWEEN: H20, which SCREAM 
writer Kevin Williamson fought to bring to the big screen.</P>
<P>        Ignoring the last four sequels (probably the brightest flash of 
inspiration this movie had), H20 goes back to the roots of the series -- 
Michael Myers stalking Jamie Lee Curtis, who is now well into her 
40s and drinking vodka straight from the bottle. Laurie Strode, the 
archetypical babysitter victim, is now the head mistress at a private 
school, living under an assumed name as Halloween 1998 rolls 
around. It's the twentieth anniversary of the Haddonfield murders and 
Laurie/Keri is rightfully freaked out.</P>
<P>        Besides being an alcoholic, she's a frighteningly 
overprotective mother. Her son (Josh Harnett) attends the same 
boarding school, and she won't let him go with the other students and 
faculty on a Yosemite camping trip (the requisite plot devise to clear 
out the facilities). So he stays behind with three other delinquents 
(Michelle Williams, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe and Adam Hann-Byrd, at least 
one of whom is on "Dawson's Creek") who plan a night of booze, sex 
and food. Way to go, Mom.</P>
<P>        Rounding out the cast of those left behind are LL Cool J as an 
erotica-writing security guard and Jamie Lee's boyfriend, played by 
Adam Arkin of "Chicago Hope." He's a therapist, which proves 
opposites attract, and seals his own fate when she tells him about her 
past and he replies, "That's sucky." It's a fun game early on to guess 
who will get killed and by which instruments, although there are few 
surprises and the movie seems to have far fewer substance than even 
the bad sequels.</P>
<P>        Then there's Myers, also known as The Shape. He emerges on 
October 29 to kill the nurse from the first two HALLOWEEN films and 
Joseph Gordon-Levitt of "3rd Rock From the Sun" with an ice skate to 
the face (which will probably be worth full ticket price for people who 
find little Joseph annoying). Then he steals two cars and heads to 
California to catch up with Jamie Lee, making the rest of us wonder if 
he really wears that mask when he drives. It would tend to impair 
vision, I imagine.</P>
<P>        Bringing Jamie Lee back and bringing Williamson aboard 
made this the sequel with the most appeal since HALLOWEEN II, but 
there comes a point where it's really ridiculous to see the same woman 
run from the same masked killer for the umpteenth time. Not only is 
Curtis pre-menopausal (though her character is only supposed to be 
37) but Michael Myers himself is over the hill. Every time a nubile 
teen runs from him, I'm waiting for him to say, "Come back here, you 
damn kid. I'm too old for this shit."</P>
<P>        The idea here is to invoke the familiar, to the point where 
Jamie Lee ends up reciting some of the exact same dialogue from the 
first movie ("Do as I say!") and yelling the f-word when she realizes 
the only place to hide is in a closet. This movie is more a nostalgia 
kick than anything, up to its ears in in-jokes, down to having Jamie's 
real mother (Janet Leigh, the famous shower stabbing victim in 
PSYCHO) pop in a cameo to "be maternal."</P>
<P>        HALLOWEEN: H20 has a few shocks but no real scares. Then 
again, it comes from Steve Miner, who directed FRIDAY THE 13TH Parts 
2 and 3. There's no hope for a classy horror movie when the director is 
best known for a 3-D movie where Jason popped some kid's eyeball 
from its socket. At least the movie has a sense of humor, most of 
which from some uncredited Williamson script moments. And finally 
we get a HALLOWEEN movie that ends exactly like all the other ones 
should have. Maybe Laurie Strode has wised up a little in the past 
twenty years. Let's hope Hollywood has, and there's no HALLOWEEN: 
H21.</P>
