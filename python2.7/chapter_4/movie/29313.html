<PRE>Heat (1995) 171m</PRE>
<P>It's almost unbelievable that Robert De Niro and Al Pacino had never played 
a scene together until they appeared in this crime picture by Michael Mann.  
This alone would be enough to earn the film a following, but even if you'd 
never seen these two actors before, HEAT would still make good viewing.  It 
began life as a screenplay written by Mann in the 70s, which was then 
reworked as a TV-movie called L.A. SHAKEDOWN in 1989 and filmed again six 
years later as he had originally envisaged it.</P>
<P>With two veteran players like these it's a tossup as to who plays the cop 
and who plays the bad guy, and in a perfect world Mann would have made two 
versions of this film, with the De Niro and Pacino roles switched (that 
would have been an interesting concept!).  In this version, it's Pacino 
who's the good guy, a cop on the trail of career criminal De Niro, whose 
gang has just pulled off an armored truck robbery.  He's been in the police 
business too long and has seen too much, and De Niro is his polar opposite, 
although just as professional in his approach to his work.  While the pair 
of them reveal their more personal selves to women, they communicate 
primarily in terms of business with their male associates.  It's only when 
Pacino and De Niro meet face to face at the hub of the story that their 
dialogue becomes a meld of both personal and professional, confirming our 
suspicions that each of them has only the other to identify with in this 
world.</P>
<P>Mann's use of neutral colours (all slate greys and chilly blues) and urban 
settings also appear to freeze emotions throughout the film.  He doesn't 
allow any humor to relieve the tension of the film's three-hour running 
time, turning HEAT into a brooding epic of masculinity - the title isn't 
just referring to police and pressure but also to the testosterone powering 
its protagonists.  Pacino and De Niro make pains to show they're in control 
while also being aware that they operate on personal codes that protect them 
from being emotionally vulnerable.  On one hand, they provide each other 
with distraction from the issues of commitment that puzzle and hurt them; 
however they also know that they are helping each other tear their worlds 
apart.  When they're forced head to head, they come out with guns blazing.  
In most other crime films, this shootout would serve as the story's climax, 
but as it deals with the characters' conflict on a superficial, machismo 
level  we don't expect it to be any suitable resolution.  That's why Mann's 
lengthy story doesn't seem overlong - or rather, it doesn't seem 
inappropriate that it's overlong.  Beyond the shootout there must be another 
more intimate - but just as deadly - confrontation.  Mann's precise 
direction (the timing of every scene and cut seems flawless) and investment 
into the hearts and minds of the characters make HEAT something grander than 
the flashy crime films we're most often accustomed to.  Actors who have 
worked with him agree that he's a perfectionist, and here it pays off.</P>
