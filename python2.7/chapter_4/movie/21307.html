JAWS
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>George Lucas is often blamed for the great decline in the
quality of American movies, because the success of his STAR
WARS in 1977 introduced the concept of blockbusters to
Hollywood producers, and redirected most of the studios'
capital towards utterly expensive, sometimes lucrative but
usually artistically insufficient movie products. Lucas
might be one of the people responsible for that, but the
very first summer blockbuster was shot and distributed two
years before his - JAWS by Steven Spielberg, one of the most
successful and most influential films of all times.</P>
<P>At the time of the production, Spielberg was still young and
relatively unknown director, far from being critics' darling
and successful crowd-pleaser. The producers, David Brown and
Richard B. Zanuck, were actually quite sceptical towards him
when they hired him to direct movie adaptation of Peter
Bentley's best-seller novel about man-eating shark that
terrorises small town on New England coast. Their suspicions
proved almost correct, because the production of JAWS was
plagued by rising budget, huge technical difficulties
associated with the shooting at sea, problems with casting
and, finally, rows between screenwriter and director. In
many ways, production of JAWS resembled the production of
ill-fated WATERWORLD twenty years later. Many people
actually questioned producers' sanity, because the film
needed almost impossibly high earnings in order to cover its
expenses. But, unlike WATERWORLD, miracle happened. JAWS was
not just the first film to break 100 million US$ mark in
box-office totals; it turned out to be one of top grossing
films of all times, where it remained for many years,
together with many other films created by Lucas and
Spielberg. Its popularity among the audience, surprisingly
in tune with the perception of critics, could be witnessed
by endless references and homage, from disco-tunes of John
Williams' musical score in 1970s, till plenty of horror
films still being inspired by it today, like Harlin's DEEP
BLUE SEA.</P>
<P>The plot takes place in the small island town of Amity, off
the coast of New England. Its beaches are very popular among
tourists, including group of young, carefree students that
spends a pleasant evening there. One of them is Karen
Watkins (played by Susan Blacklinie), who flirts with a boy
and goes skinny-dipping, only to never come out of water
again. Investigation is led by Martin Brody (played by Roy
Scheider), former New York cop who took the job of police
chief in small community only to evade violence of large
urban centres. When he finds the dismembered remains of a
girl on the beach, he is almost certain that the large shark
was perpetrator. He wants to close the beaches, but the city
administration, led by Mayor Larry Vaughn (played by Murray
Hamilton) is against it, fearing for the precious tourism
dollars. Brody reluctantly agrees to file the incident as a
boating accident, but later regrets his decision after few
more fatal incidents. City fathers are still stubborn, even
after marine biologist Matt Hooper (played by Richard
Dreyfuss) warns them that they have man-eating and very
territorial Great White shark in their waters. Brody is
willing to take his advice and company, and decides to hire
services of Quint (played by Robert Shaw), eccentric
fisherman and local shark expert, who would lead their
little shark-hunting expedition.</P>
<P>JAWS is often called one of the best horror films of all
times. It is quite understandable, since very few movies
manage to cause so intense feeling of anxiety and fear among
the audience. The fear felt by the viewers is a reflection
of subconscious fear of the Unknown. And the deep, blue and
dark depths of the ocean are perfect embodiment of the
Unknown. People watching this film are more than aware that
some unspeakable horrors lurk in those deeps and that any
man entering the water runs the risk of being nothing more
than a helpless victim. What makes this film even more
effective than other horror films was the fact that it dealt
with nothing supernatural or exotic; the audience knows that
creatures like Great White sharks exist in the oceans and
that some unfortunate people occasionally do indeed suffer
the gruesome fate of the fictional victims in this movie.
And, in this film, unlike many horrors and, same as in the
real life, nobody is immune - children, pets and even the
protagonists can be killed. The element of realism, very
rare in horror genre, made this film very effective indeed,
and it is quite understandable why many people, author of
this review included, feel rather uneasy when they enter
ocean water for a swim (although the streets and roads are
more life-threatening places, according to statistics). It
is somewhat ironic that JAWS as a very un-cliched horror
still uses the very popular horror cliche of "sex equals
death" in its opening.</P>
<P>The realism of the menace is just one part of the
explanation for the success of JAWS. The other part of the
answer lies in a way that Spielberg used to portray that
menace. Faced with huge technical difficulties and accidents
involving underwater equipment, together with a relatively
crude and still undeveloped special effects, Spielberg was
using many simple, but ingenious and very effective ways to
portray the fictional sea monster. He used unusual shooting
angles, but the best and most effective method was in not
portraying the monster at all. We actually don't see the
shark until late in the movie; before that we saw it only
through its own POV or actions that very convincingly give
away its huge size and incredible physical strength (one of
the most memorable and effective scenes is an entire pier
being pulled towards the ocean). When we finally see the
monster, the result is fantastic, since the otherwise
down-to-earth fish (relatively speaking, of course) had
already been connected with the scariest results of our
imagination.</P>
<P>The most important factor that contributed to the realism of
the film are, naturally, the characters. And this film
introduces them gradually, in orderly but very effective
action. First the deadly but magnificent menace of the dark
ocean deeps is contrasted with the quiet, every- day life of
semi-rural would-be utopia. Roy Scheider, one of the best
Hollywood actors of the 1970s (and, unfortunately, almost
forgotten now), plays the role of his life. His Brody is a
dedicated family man, whose need to protect his wife and
children led him to small town where the biggest crime
happened to be children vandalising picket fences. Every
action or choice he makes in this film, even the wrong one,
like leaving the beaches open, was motivated with the need
to protect his job and family bliss provided by it. Then we
are introduced to Richard Dreyfuss as rich and arrogant, but
in the same time very valuable scientific expert. Dreyfuss
played this role very well, in many ways trying to become
Spielberg's alter ego and he is often most remembered for
this particular role. It is ironic that the actor himself
forgot about it, according to the anecdote that later led to
the movie trivia reference in 1987 film STAKEOUT. But the
most memorable performance comes from Robert Shaw. His
Quint, rude working class eccentric whose rugged, easy-going
personality hides tragic secret from the past, is one of the
most vivid characters in the history of cinema. The late
actor's contribution to this film is even more important
when we take into account that the credit for most memorable
words in the film - legendary USS Indianapolis story (itself
being based on real life history, another element of realism
in this film) - must go exclusively to him. All three actors
had wonderful interaction, both in the scenes of male
bonding and exciting but very realistic and believable
action scenes.</P>
<P>Those three giants of course, shadowed other actors.
Lorraine Gary was good as Brody's wife, but the script
didn't give her much material. Murray Hamilton was wonderful
as mayor; at first he is a creep whose actions and
mishandling of the crisis was motivated only by greed; at
the end he reveals himself as normal, caring human being.
Lee Fierro as Mrs. Kintner also delivered few powerful
scenes in short space. The acting talent was accompanied by
the talents of almost anyone else in this film, especially
Verna Fields with its perfect editing and John Williams with
his effective, "Oscar"-awarded and now all-too-familiar
musical score. Talents of those two combined provided some
of the scariest and most memorable scenes in the history of
film.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, even the greatest of all films age through
the time and JAWS, the first film of modern Hollywood era,
didn't escape that fate. Compared with plenty of similar,
more recent films with bigger budgets and modern special
effects technology, it seems somewhat obsolete. It is
especially so in some of the night scenes, with sometimes
annoying use of "day for night" techniques that provide too
dark picture. On the other hand, such minor flaws were not
the authors' fault and insistence on them would look like
unnecessary nit- picking. All technical insufficiencies of
JAWS are still being, same as they always were, compensated
with excellent story, atmosphere and characters that work
now as effectively as they worked quarter of a century ago.
JAWS is one of those rare films that really deserved its
commercial success and its place among the best films of all
times.</P>
