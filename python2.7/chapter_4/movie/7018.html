                       A film review by Zak Forsman

<P>"A film about looking into the heart of a killer and finding the soul of a
man." These were the words used to describe DEAD MAN WALKING in the
trailers and commercials that ran for the film. They're dead on, it's
exactly what this film is about. It is not about the death penalty or
right and wrong. It is about taking responsibility for your actions,
honestly.</P>
<P>Based on the book by Sister Helen Prejean, played by Susan Sarandon, DEAD
MAN WALKING is a film about her experiences with death row inmate Matthew
Poncelet. And at the same time that she is fighting to have his sentence
reviewed, she is meeting with him and trying to get him to understand what
he did. The film is about the process of working toward redemption.</P>
<P>The screenplay by Tim Robbins is first-rate. The dialogue between Sarandon
and Penn is smart and never dull. Their scene together just before Penn is
to be executed is one of the most moving experiences I have ever had in a
movie theater. The dialogue is fresh and quick. Ideas, thoughts and
subjects move quickly--they never drag--and much of this can be accredited
to the two actors' performances. There was only one line that I was
disappointed with. When Sean Penn is about to be executed, he expresses
tearful apologies to one of his victim's father. Just then, the father of
the other victim quips, "What about us," to his wife. This may be trite,
but it was distracting in an otherwise solid screenplay.</P>
<P>Tim Robbins also directed this film. He did a fantastic job capturing (and
never intruding on) Sarandon and Penn's scenes together. He also
introduced some interesting aspects with regard to his shots. For example,
there is a mesh-wire divider between the two actors much of the time.
Robbins used that to symbolize a character's emotional state by how much
the divider was obstructing the view of the actor's face. Much of the time
Sarandon's is out of focus, well beyond the camera's depth of field, her
face shown clearly. However, Sean Penn's wire-meshing is often as in focus
as his face is, blocking his face more and making him appear hidden or
closed off. Later, when the divider is changed to a clear plastic one,
Robbins makes use of the actor's reflections in each other's shots under
similar motivations.</P>
<P>If you have not seen this film, you are missing one of the greatest scenes
between two actors that have ever been filmed. These two deserved their
Oscar nominations and although only Susan won hers, they both deserved to.
Once Sean Penn began to cry, I was sold.</P>
<P>This film has been accused of being pretentious for presenting Sean Penn's
character as a Christ metaphor during the execution sequence because the
table he is on requires his arms be strapped down out to the sides in a
fashion similar to the crucified Jesus. Tim Robbins said that he was aware
that the scene could be taken that way, but he was more interested in the
fact that the table and equipment used were exact replicas of what was
being used for actual executions. The table actually is designed that way
and the only thing in that scene that they changed was how long it took to
kill him. In the film it takes two or three minutes, in reality it takes
about twenty. </P>
