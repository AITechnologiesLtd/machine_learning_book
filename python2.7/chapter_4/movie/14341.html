                                 SIMON BIRCH
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1998</PRE>

YEAR:       1998

<PRE>                   RATING: *** 1/2 (out of a possible *****)</PRE>
<P>        "You're already a bastard; you may as well be an enlightened
one."  Such is the advice twelve year-old Simon Birch offers to his
best friend Joe Wenteworth, but the remark is not a flippant one: Joe
was born out of wedlock and has never learned the identity of his
father, a fact for which he is mercilessly ridiculed by his schoolmates.
Simon knows how he feels.  Suffering from a rare form of dwarfism, he's
so incredibly tiny that the members of his Sunday School class fling
him around like a medicine ball whenever the teacher steps outside the
room.  Since both boys are basically outcasts, they've developed the
kind of deep, fiercely loyal friendship reserved only for those who
have no one else to turn to.</P>
<P>        "Simon Birch" is a remarkable film.  Loosely based on John
Irving's novel "A Prayer for Owen Meany," the story follows a year in
the life of these two unusual friends, allowing us to witness their
intense devotion to each other.  The film works best when tiny Simon
(played with warmth and zest by Ian Michael Smith) and Joe (played as
a child by Joseph Mazzello and as an adult by Jim Carrey) are simply
being kids.  One of my favorite scenes is their charmingly naive
discussion about breasts, which takes place on a dock early in the
story.</P>
<P>        The film is episodic in structure, divided into a number of
separate but interrelated tales.  Most interesting are the stories
involving Joe's quest to discover the identity of his father, and
Simon's constant disagreements with the local church officials.  A
devout Christian who believes that God has a special plan for him,
Simon takes exception to the bland, uninteresting services performed
by Rev. Russell (David Strathairn), leading to some hilarious confron-
tations.  These scenes provide a touch of religious satire completely
unexpected in a film of this type.  A paraphrased example:</P>
<PRE>      REV. RUSSELL: God has a plan for our church and its
                    activities.
             SIMON: If God has made our bake sale a world
                    priority, we're all in serious trouble.</PRE>
<P>        The cast is very good.  Ian Michael Smith is entertaining as
Simon, and young Joseph Mazzello (who you may remember as the little
boy from "Jurassic Park") is excellent, traversing the widest emotional
arc of any character in the film, and always making us believe him.
Jan Hooks from "Saturday Night Live" turns in a thankless performance
as the slimy "holier-than-thou" Sunday School teacher, Miss Leavey.
Ashley Judd and Oliver Platt are pleasant as Joe's mother and her
boyfriend, and have a sweet screen chemistry together.  And Jim Carrey
is fine in his second consecutive dramatic role, though he isn't really
the star: his primary function is to provide the movie's "Wonder
Years"-style narration, though he does appear onscreen during the
opening and closing scenes.  Only David Straithairn (Rev. Russell)
seems unsure of how to play his part.  After leaving the theater, I
found that I still didn't understand him... and considering that much
of the film's final scenes revolve around him, that's unfortunate.</P>
<P>        But "Simon Birch" is a lot of fun, maintaining a sweet,
innocent tone for most of its two-hour running time.  One disappointing
event occurs at roughly the film's two-third mark, however: Simon
plays Baby Jesus in the church's Christmas padget.  Now that's fine: as
a deeply religious young man, Simon is certainly capable of performing
the role.  But during this scene, Simon exhibits behavior totally
against his character, for no discernable reason.  I won't reveal what
he does, but it causes the entire film to screech to a halt while we
witness what basically amounts to five minutes of "Home Alone"
outtakes.  It just doesn't make sense, and is a jarring change of tone
from the rest of the story.  See if you don't agree.</P>
<P>        And yes, the rumors are true: the film has a tremendously sad
ending, with two of our most likeable characters dying over the course
of the movie.  If "Titanic" caused you to reach for a hanky, be warned:
you may need to bring two this time.</P>
<P>        But "Simon Birch" leads us through its plot with great joy and
exhiliration; I found it impossible not to be moved by little Simon
and his irresistable pluck.  Although clearly influenced by "Stand By
Me" and "The Wonder Years" (with just a hint of "Forrest Gump"), Mark
Steven Johnson has created a thoroughly enchanting movie which can be
enjoyed by all but the most stone-hearted.  I was surprised by how much
I liked it.  Bring the whole family, but don't forget the tissues.</P>
