<P>In 1992, actor John Malkovich appeared as a clown in a Woody Allen movie
called Shadows and Fog.  Veteran British actor Donald Pleasence, best
known for his role in The Great Escape, played a doctor in that movie.
Pleasence played a preacher in a 1968 movie called Will Penny, with
Charlton Heston in the title role.  (With me so far?)  In 1995, your
humble reviewer met Charlton Heston at a Republican fundraiser in
Dallas.  This, therefore, gives me three degrees of separation from John
Malkovich.  (Your mileage may vary.)</P>
<P>The conceit of Being John Malkovich is that you can reduce that "Six
Degrees of Separation" we're all supposed to have down to one.  For two
hundred dollars, we're told, you can enter a portal leading into the
brain (consciousness?) (soul?) of John Malkovich for fifteen minutes.
You are with him as he eats breakfast, or rehearses a play, or catches a
cab.  After your time is up, you fall into a drainage ditch on the New
Jersey Turnpike and have to hitchhike back to New York.</P>
<P>Now this... this is a brilliant idea, no mistake.  In our fantasies
about writing the Great American Screenplay, this is the kind of idea we
wish we all had.  It's an idea that's just beyond the cutting edge of
reality while still being instantly comprehensible to everyone.  It
gives you a lead character that everyone knows and recognizes.  And its
one sentence summary -- evoked by John Cusack as "You see the world
through John Malkovich's eyes, then after about 15 minutes, you're spit
out into a ditch on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike!" -- may be the
best pitch since "Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito are twins."</P>
<P>And, of course, with this wonderful, creative idea as the backbone, you
can do pretty much whatever you want.  You can assemble all sorts of
characters, put them in almost any setting you want, slide them through
the portal, and see what they're like on the other side. You can,
literally, do anything with this idea.</P>
<P>This is the promise of Being John Malkovich, but it is also the danger.
C.S. Lewis noted that the problem with great ideas like this is that
they exploit themselves spontaneously.  Lewis, talking about his big
idea in The Screwtape Letters, said that his demonic correspondence,
like a runaway horse, "would run away with you for a thousand pages if
you gave it its head."</P>
<P>What happens to Being John Malkovich is that writer Charlie Kaufman and
director Spike Jonze give their imaginations free rein, and the movie
runs away on them.  Being John Malkovich is less like a runaway horse
than it is like a runaway carousel, with horses and bodies flying around
at top speed in dizzying arcs.  But there's no centripetal force to keep
the movie from spinning wildly out of control.  Being John Malkovich
spits out eccentric, inventive ideas at a mile a minute.  Each of the
ideas isn't really bad, in and of itself, but there are so many of them,
piled one on top of the other, that the whole movie is a walk through
Bizarro World.</P>
<P>Take the characters, for instance.  John Cusack is a quirky puppeteer
whose idea of puppet shows is Heloise and Abelard instead of Punch and
Judy.  Early on, he gets beat up by a critic, which apparently happens
often.  Cameron Diaz plays his wife, who's sort of a cross between a
young Geena Davis and Dr. Doolittle.  (She's got the funniest line in
the movie, which I won't share with you, as it changes the course of the
movie.)  Catherine Keener plays his co-worker and partner in the
burgeoning business of sharing slices of Malkovich's life.  She seems
perfectly normal for a while until she becomes a walking icon of lust.
(Really.)  It says something about Being John Malkovich that the only
character who looks and acts normal the whole way through is Charlie
Sheen.</P>
<P>But despite all of the layers of self indulgent weirdness, Being John
Malkovich has three fantastic, wonderful elements that make it a must
see.  The first, and most obvious, is the performance of Malkovich
himself.  Malkovich may not win Best Actor, but he's the Best Sport of
the year for even agreeing to participate in this project.  It's easy to
imagine what would have happened had he said no -- we might have gotten
something skin-crawlingly godawful like "Being Fran Drescher" -- but
Malkovich shows us all why this movie is only possible with an
undeniably great actor in the title role.  Part of the role is an
inspired self-parody, part of the role shows off the best possession
scenes since Steve Martin in All of Me, and part of the role is his
participation in two of the weirdest sequences ever shot on film.</P>
<P>These are the other two reasons to see the movie.  Twice, we're
transported into John Malkovich's subconscious, and these two scenes
completely redeem the movie.  All of the bizarre and odd things that
infest the movie come together in two thrilling, jaw dropping moments
that are completely original while being completely unlike each other.</P>
<P>The key thing to remember about Being John Malkovich is that the whole
concept of the portal is a misdirection.  The audience isn't really
being sucked into Malkovich's brain, it's being sucked into the
imagination of Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze.  This is not a
comfortable place for everyone, and when you get dumped out of the
theater, you may feel disoriented and dizzy.  But the high points of
this thrill ride are well worth the price of admission.</P>

<P>"So how does a conservative movie reviewer, who doesn't want to spoil
the movie, write a review? The same way he takes the lamb chop from
rottweiller -- carefully. Another way is to fill two-thirds of the
column with irrelevant woolgathering about other topics so that you
only have room for a paragraph for the real review."  -- Jonah Goldberg</P>
