<PRE>THE PEACEMAKER

<PRE>Review Date:         May 18, 1998
Director:                Mimi Leder

                Nicole Kidman as Julia Kelly        
Genre:                 Thriller
Year of Release:         1997</PRE>
<P>Mimi Leder's directorial debut was also the first theatrical release
from the newly formed Hollywood studio Dreamworks SKG. S for Steven
Spielberg, K Jeffrey Katzenberg, G for David Geffen. </P>
<P>PLOT:
Russian bad guys steal some nuclear warheads from a train. Good
Military Guy Devoe (Clooney), and Nuclear Expert Kelly (Kidman) are the
two American wunderkinds appointed to find the warheads and save the
world from a possible nuclear disaster. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Mostly unexciting, humdrum romp that doesn't really offer us any real
action or suspense until the last half an hour. Set in various
international destinations, this jargon-filled strategy session set
amongst military folk, nuclear experts and politicians, is the movie
equivalent of a long day at the dentist's office. Warning: There is a
lot of talking in this film, and very little action. The special
effects are limited to one great nuclear blast at the beginning of the
picture, and many redundant explosions throughout the rest of the
flick.</P>
<P>Clooney does okay in his wise-cracking, super-Special-Forces dude role,
while Kidman literally runs through her part like she's in a hurry to
get to London to film Stanley Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT with her
husband, Tom Cruise. The rest of the cast just seem like a bunch of
people standing around and taking orders from either of the two stars.
And coincidentally enough, both stars always seem to be right. How
exciting! Yawn.</P>
<P>The last forty minutes finally wakes us from the numbing sensation
induced by the film's first hour and a half delivery (alas, Mrs. JoBlo
couldn't make it all the way through), and does actually deliver some
pretty neat suspense, good action, and a centered point of reference.
Other than that, this film does not deliver in regards to its "thrills"
moniker one bit, and will leave many a thriller fan invariably
disappointed. Mind you, if you enjoy films that seem to realistically
encapsulate the essence of being part of an actual governmental body of
people chasing after bad guys, then you might enjoy most of the
talkie-talkies in this film. I did not. </P>
<P><Semi-Spoiler> I would like to take this moment to thank those "powers
that were" who did forsake us from the otherwise obvious Clooney/Kidman
cheap romance. For that, and only that, I thank you.   </P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
George Clooney stands 5"10, was born in Kentucky, owns a pet pig, has
taught actresses Kirsten Dunst to drive (on a golf cart) and Laurie
Metcalf to drive a stick shift, is cousins with actor Miguel Ferrer,
and nephew to singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. He also flailed through
many TV sitcoms before settling into his dramatic shoes at ER
("Roseanne" and "The Facts of Life" are two of the shows in which he
briefly participated).
Nicole Kidman also stands 5"10, was born in Hawaii, but brought up in
Australia, and has two adopted children with her husband of eight
years, Tom Cruise. She is a high-school dropout.
Mimi Leder directed many episodes of the popular NBC TV drama ER,
starring the ever-popular George Clooney, before making her debut as a
movie director with this film (I wonder how he got this gig?).<HR>Visit JoBlo's Movie Reviews
