<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars</P>
<P>Screaming and groaning with his distinct,
screw-you-I-won't-do-what-you-tell-me tone, Adam Sandler also screams
down the throat of Hollywood's carefully evolved comedy genre.  The
comedy that we love to watch, or closer to the truth, the comedy that
Hollywood execs like to think that we love to watch, now seems stale and
uninspiring in comparison to Sandler's eruptions of cheap insults and
dry, unemotional observations.  Not just in his own right but in every
right, Sandler is a Superstar, a wild animal in Hollywood's fun park who
is not only able to jump in and out of his pen, he also gets paid and
celebrated for it.  Adam Sandler is cool…and funny…and cracks lots of
great jokes…or is he the greatest joke of them all?</P>
<P>Sandler's been around for a reasonable time - in the public eye, at
least, since 95's 'Billy Maddison', if you're a 'Saturday Night Live'
fan, even longer - so one might expect (and many would hope) that in
1999, he would go ballistic.  Rock the censors, Adam, shout your loudest
and fart your proudest, make monkey noises and let us roll on the floor
in shameful fits of laughter.  Alas, far before his time, he's taken the
coming-of-age approach and found (shudder) maturity and slight depth in
at least two of his roles.  In 'Big Daddy,' he preaches that love and
companionship make for a fulfilling life, in 'Happy Gilmore,' he
accidentally shoots a nail into his boss' head and later makes fun of
it.  Not that sentimentality has never been in a Sandler film -
'Gilmore' and 'Maddison' had romantic subplots and 'The Wedding Singer'
was obviously a love story - it's just never been this bleeding obvious,
or this forced.</P>
<P>There's a Cute Little Kid in 'Big Daddy' (played by identical twins Cole
and Dylan Sprouse) who also happens to be an orphan, and then there's
Big Daddy Sonny Koufax (Sandler) - a Homer Simpson prodigy who works one
day a week at a toll booth - who acts as his surrogate father, as a
means to impress women.  And it works, too, as Sonny meets Layla (sue,
Clapton, sue!), played by 'Jerry Maguire's' Joey Lauren Adams, and his
life soon begins to take direction.</P>
<P>Sonny raises his voice enough times to remind us that this _is_ an Adam
Sandler movie, although the jokes seem more marketed to a lawn bowls
club - perhaps with a free luncheon and cup of tea after the movie -
than the teenage audience.  Director Dennis Dugan, who actually has a
tiny role in the film as a reluctant Trick-or-Treat giver, is careful to
keep his material easily digestible and feel-good.  I find it hard to
believe that this is the same man who manipulated Sandler for some of
his most effective work thus far in 'Happy Gilmore,' a film that
effortlessly took the piss out of itself and never looked back to see
whether the audience was still smiling.  Signs that his comedic timing
is still on cue are evident in 'Big Daddy,' especially when Steve
Buscemi, who's always fun to watch, plays a homeless cynic with
effortless and hilarious conviction.  The difference between Buscemi and
Sandler: Buscemi can manage to look good in a bad picture.</P>
<P>However, I certainly wouldn't call 'Big Daddy' a bad picture.  I'm more
inclined to describe it as a piece that can't grasp or manipulate the
audience's emotions, and that makes for some amusing viewing when one of
its final scenes intends us to cry.  Instead, it's purely laughable.</P>
<P>How lovely that the film's centerpiece scene is in a courtroom, near the
film's conclusion, in which Sandler recites a bloated speech about his
undying love for Julian and his new found responsibility.  I had my
fingers crossed that the judge would recite a few lines from 'Billy
Maddison': "What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic
things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent
response were you even close to anything that could be considered a
rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having
listened."  Now _that's_ an Adam Sandler movie.</P>
