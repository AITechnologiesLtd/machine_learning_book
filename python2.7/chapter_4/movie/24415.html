<PRE>IN SHORT: Feh.</PRE>
<P>Sometimes a movie with a minority cast will do big business, even if
it's a real stinkeroo, because that minority will turn out to see their
fellows on the screen. Such is the case with Luminarias, a histrionic
stage play which has forgotten that moviemaking requires actors to turn
it down a notch. Even though its stage production came first, Luminarias
is a lowbrow Waiting to Exhale . . . and I didn't care for that poorly
made flick either. If I wanted to watch incredibly negative Latina
characters, I'd be popping a beer in front of MadTV. If I wanted to take
it on the chin for being in the majority according to skin tone, then
Luminarias  would sure teach me a thing or two. This film is so focussed
on, what I'm guessing to be, the rage of the Latina author that anyone
outside with non-Hispanic origins is dissed. And so, for that matter,
are non-Mexican Hispanics.</P>
<P>The film begins at the anniversary party of Andrea (Evelina Fernandez)
and Joe (Robert Beltran of Star Trek: Voyager) at which Joe is caught
swapping tongues with the blonde gringa hottie he's been doing on the
side. Apparently he's done this many times before and Andrea boots him
out of the house. Usually Joe comes back all respectful and apologetic.
This time he wants a divorce.</P>
<P>So we've got four single Latinas who hang out at a restaurant called
Luminarias, doing shots and talking about looking for love. Besides
Andrea, a divorce lawyer, there is Sofia (Marta Du Bois), a therapist,
who likes white guys and is in such denial of her heritage that she
barely speaks the language; Irene (Diana Ortelli) the clothing designer
who likes her studs young and Latin (but has given up sex for Lent); and
Lilly (Angela Moya), a visual artist, usually ends up with men who are
most likely undocumented, unemployed and married.</P>
<P>Sofia, hoping to get her friend a taste of something exotic, fixes up
Andrea on a surprise blind date with Jewish lawyer Joseph Levinson
(Scott Bakula) -- who, unknown to Sofia, is handling the opposite side
of a divorce case Andrea is working on. Andrea, as noted, doesn't like
white guys, but a couple of shots of tequila, and the sight of her ex
and his blonde, take care of that. Joseph finds himself introduced to
Andrea's family, including cousin Jesus (Cheech Marin) and a pair of
horny aunts. They're more excited about having a gringo in the family
than Andrea seems to be.</P>
<P>It must be noted that only Bakula, Marin and Liz Torres (in a very minor
role) know how to play to the camera. Everyone else is overacting so
badly that many of the smaller stories -- the effect of the divorce on
Andrea's son; Lilly facing the kind of discrimination the girls discuss
and/or preach, because she's fallen in love with a Korean -- are
overshadowed by weaker, lowbrow gags -- Irene's homosexual transvestite
brother. Regardless, every story turns sloppy sentimental as the play
forces one happy ending on top of another.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Luminarias, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$0.00</PRE>
<PRE>Nothing shines about this thing.</PRE>
