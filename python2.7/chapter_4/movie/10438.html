<PRE>.                                  TITANIC
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     So here I am, newly engaged, and the subject of honeymoons comes up.  I
hate the sun, and I don't like flying, so naturally, I say: Cruise!  How about
Alaska?  This is the best idea we've come up with so far... and then we go to
see TITANIC.</P>
<P>     Well, I can't think of anything that would change my mind faster than the
sight of 1500 ice-covered dead bodies, bobbing up and down in the ocean, after
the sinking of a luxury liner.  Let's jump right on the boat, huh?</P>
<P>     And maybe that speaks to the power of the film.  When the ship is
launched on its maiden voyage, you can feel the splendor in the theater.  When
it bangs against the iceberg and starts to sink, you can feel the death in the
air.  When all that's left is ocean and darkness, you shiver in your seat with
the dying.</P>
<P>     The point I'm getting at is that this is a movie about *atmosphere*.  The
Titanic itself is the star--the only star--and the only reason to leave your
house.  Leonardo DiCaprio as a third-class drifter?  Forget it.  Kate Winslet,
one of my favorite actresses around, as a first-class dreamer who falls for
the lug?  She's fine, but sounds like she belongs in the Valley.  Billy Zane
as her betrothed?  Puh-leeze.  These parts could have been played by anybody
and then forgotten.  The movie would remain the same.</P>
<P>     Don't even think about waiting for video or cable with this film.  You'll
hate it.  I also think it's safe to say you can arrive 90 minutes late and
still see the good stuff (the rest is Cameron's sappy love story that is both
exceedingly phony and wholly unoriginal, not to mention the scenes from "the
present.")  Then again, lots of sobs in the audience attest that the film is
both an effects extravaganza *and* a chick flick (and a dessert topping, I guess).</P>
<P>     Whatever it's pigeon-holed as, you're going to love the movie, even if it
is 3 1/2 hours long.  But I've rambled too much.  I've got a honeymoon to plan.</P>
