<P>As the 21st century rapidly approaches, much is being made about the 
public's obsession with material that is, to put it frankly, none of 
it's business. The stories that attract America's attention for the 
longest periods of time have not been the cold war's termination, 
fleeing refugees from 3rd world countries or even the state of the 
union. Albeit that those are all issues that get a fair amount 
attention, the larger coverage is given to stories like the assault of a 
fellow skater that was linked to Tonya Harding, the trial of O. J. 
Simpson, and the relationship between a certain world leader and a young 
intern. It can be argued that this is due to people's need for 
knowledge that they are not the only ones with imperfections, and there 
are others with even greater dilemmas. But whatever the cause, there 
seems to be little more that the public enjoys, as the latest Ron Howard 
film, Edtv demonstrates, than being able to turn on the television or 
pick up a newspaper and see, hear or read about someone else's 
problems.</P>
<P>Ed Pekurny (Mathew McConaughey) is little more than your average guy 
with real world problems. He is about 30 years old, single and has an 
ordinary job at the local video store. His role model is Burt Reynolds, 
and yet the two seem to have little in common. His father left him when 
he was 12, and his mother lives with his step father, Al (Martin 
Landau), who raised him for all intensive purposes. His older brother, 
Ray (Woody Harrelson) is very similar to Ed but features a far more 
attractive life with six month girlfriend, Shari (Jenna Elfman).</P>
<P>On the other side of the ball there is Cynthia (Ellen DeGeneres) and Dr. 
Whitaker (Rob Reiner) who are both executives at a documentary based 
television network. They are wealthy and don't face problems similar 
to Ed's, but rather one major issue, that of slumping ratings. As of 
late, their network has been doing so bad that it actually lost out to 
"the Gardening Channel." Cynthia has a plan that will either bring them 
back to the top, or lose it all. The risk is major, but she is confident 
that if you put one person on television and follow every moment of 
their life, people will watch.</P>
<P>Of course, Ed is selected as the one and agrees. This process is most 
predictable and often is actually boring to watch. However, that soon 
ends when the great television experiments begins and "coincidentally" 
things start to become interesting. (A typical Hollywood touch to a film 
of this nature.)</P>
<P>Mathew McConaughey is less than stellar in his lead role. Often upstaged 
by Woody Harrelson, Martin Landau, Jenna Elfman, and even in a cameo by 
Dennis Hopper, his performance is most ironic as it often resembles a 
poorly acted television drama. One scene in particular features him with 
a love interest where his every move seems staged leading up to the soon 
to be stolen kiss. Other scenes are remarkably similar, but they are 
supposed to be staged to some degree, so it is harder to assign blame to 
McConaughey alone for them.</P>
<P>Fortunately, the supporting cast is absolutely brilliant. As the movie 
takes turns towards the melodramatic, and becomes more and more 
predictable, they seem to be the only saving grace in scene after scene. 
Ellen DeGeneres in particular stands out as someone who could have 
easily overplayed her role, but instead chose to turn in a refreshingly 
smart performance. At one point she has what is scripted as a break down 
type scene at a conference table, that could have very easily not only 
ruined her job, but Reiner's as well. However, instead of going for 
the over used Hollywood effect of over the top acting, she keeps it very 
light and actually makes a very good statement in doing so.</P>
<P>Despite the fine ensemble acting minus McConaughey, Edtv has a major 
flaw that reaches far beyond one poor performance. The movie has a very 
black and white message that is an opposition to scandalous 
entertainment, in particular it uses the given example of a man's life 
on television. The problem with that is 90% of the entertainment in this 
film does not come from the scenes focussing around this 24-hours a day 
documentary, but rather from us watching the man on television. So, 
despite sending a heavy message against the monitoring of other lives 
for entertainment, the movie relies on that very concept.</P>
<P>However, the question must be posed if the film itself is at fault for 
this. After all, almost all movies rely on the life and times of one 
person, fictional or real, as their main source of entertainment. But 
when a comparison is drawn to The Truman Show, an earlier release about 
a similar situation, you realize that films like this can be done 
tastefully. And you also realize that most films focussing on an 
individual, do so in a less scandalous and more pure fashion.</P>
<P>A realization must be made though. And that is that the public does seem 
to enjoy this type of "real life" trash. We may not want to admit it, 
and we may know that it is wrong, but we do like seeing other people's 
flaws. And this movie is masterful at doing that. It pokes fun in a way 
that is absolutely hysterical and keeps you interested for the two 
hours.</P>
<P>So, overall Edtv has some positives and negatives. The acting is good; 
but that is countered by one central performance that is horrendous. The 
message is very moralistic and delivered in an enjoyable fashion; but 
that is countered by a contradiction that undermines the entire film. 
Ultimately I did enjoy this film, as I have enjoyed the various scandals 
of the past few years. But I never gave my approval to OJ, or Tonya, or 
Monica, and I don't plan on starting here.</P>
