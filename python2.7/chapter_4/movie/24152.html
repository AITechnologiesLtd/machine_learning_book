<PRE>READY TO RUMBLE</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Brian Robbins
Written by: Steven Brill</PRE>
<P>Walking into "Ready to Rumble", the new film from Hollywood's biggest
goofball, David Arquette ("Scream", those annoying 1-800-call-ATT
commercials), I figured there were two possibilities for this movie. It was
going to be stupid, the previews had already given that much away. The
question now, was whether it was going to be the sort of stupid which you
can't help but chuckle at, or the just plain moronic kind. It turns out that
the movie has a little of both. While there are a lot of faults, there are
also one or two really funny scenes and a few others you can't help but find
amusing no matter how low brow they might be. However, the film's biggest
problem is the premise itself. How can one make a movie that pokes fun at
professional wrestling when wrestling already pokes fun at itself?</P>
<P>Gordie (David Arquette) and Sean (Scott Caan) have only one great love in
their lives. This all consuming passion is professional wrestling, and
specifically worship for their idol, Jimmy "The King" King (Oliver Platt).
They have just obtained tickets to the latest match between The King and
Diamond Dallas Page (Page Falkinburg). They are horrified to find that
King's manager, Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano), has rigged the match so
that King will not only lose, but will be ejected from the wrestling circuit
forever. Now Gordie and Sean have only one purpose in life: to get The King
his crown back. However, they soon discover that their idol may not be all
they thought he was, and professional wrestling may be *gasp* fake afterall!</P>
<P>When I said there are one or two really funny scenes in this movie I wasn't
kidding. Fortunately, there are enough mildly amusing scenes to make up for
this. The interesting thing is that, the best part of this movie isn't the
comedy, it's the massive wrestling match at the film's end. The problem with
this is that it's a long, and at times very dull, trip to that payoff.
Another problem is that while the majority of the jokes may fall flat, at
least the actors are trying their best to pull something out of them.
However, at other times the movie seems to be trying to convey some message
about wrestlers and their fans and this not only doesn't work, but seriously
detracts from the rest of the film. I suppose this is because anything
serious seems completely out of place in a movie this goofy.</P>
<P>As for the actors, I've never really cared for David Arquette. He may have
been somewhat entertaining in the "Scream" films, but I think this is
because Wes Craven kept him tightly reined in. Otherwise, he has a tendancy
to overact to the point where the audience expects him to rip out of the
screen and start bouncing off the walls. Scott Caan ("Boiler Room", "Black
and White") hasn't appeared in much till now, but he turns in a remarkably
restrained performance considering his co-star. As for Oliver Platt ("Lake
Placid"), whom I consider one of the better comic actors working in
Hollywood, he is woefully miscast as a professional wrestler. The problem
is, Platt is not particularly tall, rather overweight, and about as vicious
looking as a small dog. Being surrounded by real wrestlers, like Bill
Goldberg throughout the movie, only makes him look more ridiculous in this
role.</P>
<P>"Ready to Rumble" has a typical soundtrack for this type of movie. It's
filled with popular alternative music, and it was certainly a welcome change
from the constant rap soundtracks I've been hearing lately. Brian Robbins
("Varsity Blues") doesn't exactly seem to be directing this movie. He simply
seems to be allowing the actors to do whatever they feel like to try and get
a laugh out of Stephen Brill's ("The Mighty Ducks") rather weak script. I'm
not sure if this was a good idea, but keeping David Arquette under control
certainly couldn't have hurt the film. "Ready to Rumble" runs far too long
at 122 minutes, and should have been no more than 95. I'd recommend "Ready
to Rumble" to wrestling fans since they will most likely recognize a few
familiar faces and give it three out of five stars.</P>
