<PRE>Men in Black 
Review By David Wilcock (C)1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<P>Starring Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent D'Onforio. 
Directed By Barry Sonnenfield
A Columbia Picture</P>
<P>Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones team up for yet another special
effect laden summer movie. And, like The Lost World,
this one isn't half bad. It centres more on the comedy and
characters than the special effects themselves, which is
damn good, and movies should follow this example! </P>
<P>The Men in Black (MIB) are a agency which moniter extra
terristial life on Earth. However, these aliens don't LOOK
like aliens, they look like humans. At one point, a board
comes up showing who some of the aliens are, and these
include George Lucas and Sylvestor Stallone. A nice joke
there. Anyway, an evil alien, who steals D'Onforios skin, is
on a plot to take over the world. So, the MIB are called in
to stop this. </P>
<P>What follows is 90 mins of non stop action and laughs. '90
minutes?' I hear you cry? Yes, thankfully, MIB is a very
short film. Not that it's too short. 90 minutes is the perfect
running time. It's not too much, and it's not too little.  Will
Smith does a good Eddie Murphy impression, and delivers
his jokes in his Fresh Prince style. Jones, however, does
his Leslie Nielson impression, and delivers his jokes in a
perfect deadpan way. These two comedic styles go
toghether prefectly. Rip Torn also gives a good
performance as their boss. One of the best performances is
D'Onforio. Watching him lumber around, in skin which is
too big for him, is hillarous. He dosen't say much, but he's
very, very good. However, Linda Fiorentino (The Last
Seduction, 1994) is dissapointing as a leggy coroner. Her
performance is good, but her part is hopelessly
underwritten. She just seems to be there to help with the
ending. The special effects, and the aliens created by Rick
Baker (The Nutty Professor, 1997) are excellent. </P>
<P>This film may cause some trouble with easily scared
children. Although nowhere near as intense as The Lost
World, there are some scenes which could be scary, even
though they're not meant to be. So don't take the PG
rating lightly. The ending is probably the worse bit,
although they're little bits throughout which might upset
kids. Like most Spielberg adventure films, there are intense
scenes. If your child went through The Lost World OK,
though, or the Indiana Jones films, then they should get
through this OK. Overall though, I think only a few
children would be scared by this film. MIB, then, is highly
recommended. </P>
<PRE>Overall Rating=**** out of ***** (Very good film)
