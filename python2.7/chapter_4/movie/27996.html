<P>   When I was in high school I had a choice of trying out for
the rifle team or the cross-country squad.  The former
seemed like a less taxing option, so I took careful aim at the
target and fired.  So did my fellow sophomores, who were
also out to get a varsity letter for what was called for
purposes of the school yearbook a sport.  I didn't make the
rifle team, but I did make the running squad and to my credit,
I finished every race on the 3-1/2 mile course, over inclines
and knolls.  But to this day I don't understand the rifle bit. 
What did it take to hit the bullseye like half of my
competition?  I didn't drink, smoke, or do drugs and had
20/20 vision corrected.  My hand was steady, my motivation
unimpeachable.  Now, let's a telescopic sight to the gun
--such as existed even in the days of ancient history (World
War II)--and you can spot the enemy in the cross hairs. What
could be easier? You have steady hands and a penetrating
blue eyes.  What makes one guy a sniper first class while the
rest of us miss a target the size of a large head?  This
question is unanswered in Jean-Jacques Arnaud's strikingly
photographed story of the Battle of Stalingrad, involving
combat that would change the course of the war and lead to
the ultimate victory of the Soviet Union over Germany--in
much the way the Battle of Saratoga was the turning point of
our own War for Independence.  According to the story jointly
scripted by Alain Godard and the director, the entire course
of the war was decided High Noon style, but a single bullet
from the gun of a distinctly hawk-eyed sharpshooter.  </P>
<P>   What gives "Enemy at the Gates" a particular distinction is
not only that it's about World War II, a subject that Steven
Spielberg revived with his far superior and more involving,
realistic and non-mushy "Saving Private Ryan," but that no
Americans are involved in the action.  (Will a stateside
audience be drawn to the box office? We'll see by Sunday.)</P>
<P>   In an attempt to appeal to women and to youthful filmgoers
who might consider this a date movie, Annaud throws in a
love triangle that leads the guy who never had a chance to
erupt in a jealous rage that could have cost the West the war
but who, we expect, will redeem himself soon thereafter. 
Leave out the romantic slush and Annaud could have cut the
movie's 131 minutes to a fast-paced 95 while giving
heartthrob Jude Law a chance to play a Soviet Gary Cooper
to the Third Reich's most illustrious gunman.  The movie
merits an audience for two of its motifs: one showing the
horrors of the battlefield, particularly the opening shots of a
Soviet led, suicidal, "Gallipoli"-like charged against well
protected and heavily armed German forces; the other an
intriguing chess game between two shooters of about equal
ability and cleverness.</P>
<P>   As for the story behind the dramatic activity: Vassili (Jude
Law), an almost illiterate shepherd from Urals who as a kid
was trained by his dad to shoot wolves preying on the flock,
develops remarkable skill with his rifle and, once baptized by
the fire of the big war he gets the attention of a political
officer, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) for picking off five Germans
in the midst of battlefield anarchy.  The poetic Danilov proves
that the pen deserves a place next to the sword by writing
about this hero in terms that could embarrass even a film
publicist--thereby reviving the morale of the entire Soviet
Union.  Vassili, an aw-shucks guy who simply does not have
the confidence ascribed to him by the journalist, knocks off
five Germans, becoming the pride of Nikita Khruschev (Bob
Hoskins), prompting the Germans to send their own best
marksman, Major Konig (Ed Harris), to take him out.</P>
<P>   The latter half of the film is taken up by a cat-and-mouse
game between the two people, each respectful of the other's
abilities, each using his wit as much as his shooter's eye to
corner the other and release him with a single bullet.  An
eight-year-old Russian kid, Sacha (Gabriel Marshall-
Thomson), wise beyond his years, is the only human being
who knows both marksmen, as he has been shuttling back
and forth giving away secrets to the German major in return
for chocolate.</P>
<P>   While the women around me said that they couldn't take
their eyes from Jude Law, Ed Harris is the real prize with a
controlled performance as a Nazi major.  Harris's Konig
shows his humanity in his conferences with the kid,
superimposed by a steely determination to win the war
singlehandedly for the Fuhrer.  Rachel Weisz as Tania, a
Russian-Jewish combatant with a fluent knowledge of
German, is courted by the Jewish Danilov as well as by
Vassili--but by never at any point giving Danilov a chance to
win her heart, Annaud strips away the possibility of surprise.
The focus changes from the gunplay to the courtship, even
tossing in the obligatory sex scene--that takes place amid the
mud and slime of the barracks at Stalingrad with the two
lovers surrounded by grunts (while adding their own).</P>
<P>   The war is shown in part as a battleground between two
ideologies, Nazism and Communism--which as practiced by
the century's two most notorious butchers, Stalin and Hitler,
are alike in many ways.  Two Soviet combatants, Koulikov
(Ron Perlman) and Danilov, wax cynical about Stalin's vision,
insisting that there's no such thing as The New Man which
Communism is supposed to engender, nor can an individual's
talents and jealousies be uprooted by some government-
imposed dogma.  Amen to that.  Lose the romance. Save the
picture.</P>
