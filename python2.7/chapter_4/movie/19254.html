<P>"Goodbye 20th Century!," a Macedonian sci-fi/drama, is a visionary motion 
picture full of many startling, bold images, and reminiscent of French 
director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 1995 fantasy, "City of Lost Children." From a 
camera travelling through a toilet drain and into outer space, to a beautiful 
shot of the exterior of a shopping mall as a New Year's celebration goes on 
inside, "Goodbye 20th Century!" directors Aleksandar Popovski and Darko 
Mitrevski prove to have a huge amount of style and visual flair to spare. 
Among these especially stunning technical attributes, however, is a motion 
picture that is as frustrating and incomprehensible as I can remember seeing 
in recent memory. No attempt to follow any sort of coherent path is made, nor 
is there any way that we can identify with the severely selective and vaguely 
written main characters and, therefore, what we are left with is a bunch of 
jumbled storylines that have nowhere to go but crash into each other and 
explode.</P>
<P>The film is made up of two loosely-related 40-minute stories, intercut with 
what is supposed to be the first-ever wedding captured on film in the early 
1900's, between a brother and sister who are deeply in love. Beginning in the 
aftermath of a war in the year 2019 that has left the Balkans a desolate, 
sparse landscape, a man named Kuzman (Lazar Ristovski) is abruptly shot into 
a grave by his fellow comrades after being suspected as the cause of the mass 
deaths of their children. Rising up from the grave afterwards, and 
subsequently, after being shot several more time, Kuzman discovers that he is 
immortal because, as one person notes, "the ground will not take him." 
Meeting a prophet, Kuzman is instructed to travel to the Glass City and kill 
the Man With The Green Hair, who guards a wall that foretells everyone's 
future, including his own.</P>
<P>The latter half of the film then goes back in time to New Year's Eve 1999, at 
the turn of the century. Following a mysterious man dressed in a Santa Claus 
outfit, he solemnly attends an otherwise joyous New Year's party and then 
rents a purely white room from a guy named Peter, which also holds various 
people mourning the recent death of his brother. Discussing different 
theories on what the 21st Century will hold, Santa states in all seriousness 
that time as we know it will stop at the strike of midnight. Everyone laughs 
the notion off, of course, but might this obviously psychotic man dressed as 
Santa Claus be able to correctly prophesize the future? Oh, and the briefly 
aforementioned wedding in 1900 between the brother and sister, find their 
festivities cut short when the brother is shot dead. </P>
<P>When the confused (to put it mildly) proceedings conclude with the titled 
quote, "Goodbye 20th Century!," you are left with the nagging question, "what 
exactly was the point?" Is the film taking these fantasy elements to make a 
statement on the currently bleak state in the Balkans? Perhaps, but only 
those who are closely related to Macedonia will be able to grasp this 
concept. Besides, even if the film is trying to be earnest, that doesn't 
erase the blatant ludicrous and misguided nature of the narrative, in which a 
farting wheelchair-bound woman; a tattoed, nude hussy who has sex with her 
brother in a bathtub; leather and iron-clad futuristic men; and an old lady 
who gets her brains blown out by Santa, all figure into the story. </P>
<P>With everything taken under consideration, maybe "Goodbye 20th Century!" is 
simply a parable letting us know that the world has always been a bad place, 
as noted with the murder of the groom in 1900, and is not likely to get any 
better, as the question of apocalyptic doom sweeps over on the eve of the 
year 2000. If this is the case, not only is the film shoddily made on the 
screenplay level, but also comes off as arbitrary and simple-minded, a 
virtual waste of the viewer's time. </P>
<P>One of the most offensive things about "Goodbye 20th Century!" is its 
treatment of incest, which flows throughout the picture. Not only does Kuzman 
gain his own mortality after animalistically having sex with his sister in 
the first story (which could be looked upon as a good or bad thing), but the 
siblings who are getting married during the interlude between the two 
vignettes are negatively looked upon, and the ceremony ends in death. So, 
what does this mean? Do directors Popovski and Mitrevski believe incestuous 
relationships are a virtuous thing (as referenced with the immortal man)? And 
if so, then why do they go back on their word to portray it in a bad light 
with the wedding? If they are trying to only push their point more firmly 
across that the world is an unfair place, then why must they focus their 
attention on incest, especially since they have nothing interesting or 
insightful to say about the controversial subject?</P>
<P>If this is an example of the best in Eastern European cinema, which I 
certainly don't believe it is, then perhaps filmmakers in that section of the 
world should rethink what they want to say with their films, instead of 
trivializing them with artificial and silly plot occurrences and having 
nothing substantial to say about their subjects to begin with. In short, 
"Goodbye 20th Century!" is an ambitious film on many different levels, and I 
can appreciate that, but it rarely succeeds on any of them. </P>
