<PRE>REVIEW:  Good Will Hunting</PRE>
<PRE>by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<PRE>3 and a half stars out of 5</PRE>
<P>Theres something a little unsettling about Will Hunting.  Sure  hes a genius
born on the wrong side of the tracks, with the IQ of Einstein and a PHD in being
a smart-ass.  But lets look at the situation seriously: Will is smart enough to
solve an equation that few people in the world are able to, but dumb enough to
continuously punch a guys head in when he can hear the cops a coming.  Not to
mention being caught for theft, fights and other fairly pathetic crimes.  He may
be able to recite word for word a chapter from a book and solve complicated
equations, but he doesnt seem to be quite so smart when it comes to simple
everyday actions and thoughts.  This is why he mucks up a good relationship with
his girlfriend, lands himself in a low paying job and fails to grasp the idea of
loving anybody but himself.</P>
<P>Will (Matt Damon) works as a cleaner at one of Americas prestigious schools.
When he secretly solves a complex maths problem written on a black board, maths
Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgerd) attempts to track down the mystery
intellect.  But when he eventually discover who it is, Will has been arrested
and given a prison sentence.</P>
<P>Lambeau is able to convince the judge to free Will on two terms: that he spends
one day a week meeting with Lambeau and one day a week meeting with a therapist.
After quickly humiliating two shrinks (one in a hilarious afternoon delight
scene), he meets his match when introduced to the wise Sean McGuire (Robin
Williams).  Wills best mate (Ben Affleck) and new girlfriend (Minnie Driver)
also complicate his bewildered life.</P>
<P>The exquisite scenes of tense and ardent drama between Will and Sean are the
core of the film.  The rest of it, however, is a fairly ordinary story simply
told well.</P>
<P>Its been quite some time since Robin Williams has performed in such a mature
and robust way.  Many of his recent films (Flubber, Jumanji, Mrs Doubtfire) have
been laughable in more ways than one.  At last we have something that can stand
up against the microscope and exploit Williams skill; reassuring us that he is
indeed an actor capable to appeal to people above the age of twelve.</P>
<P>Good Will Hunting is fundamentally a fairly ordinary show.  Gus Van Sant (and
the films writers, Damon and Affleck) deserves credit, though, as what we have
here is a solid and clever concoction of socially aware drama.  But what could
have been a physiological battle of emotions gets tangled up with silly little
detours into childish relationships and situations.</P>
<P>Its good  yes, but Good Will Hunting does not match up to the hype which so
wholly surrounded it.   It shouldnt be known as the savoir of teen dramas, the
Oscar winner or the lavish masterpiece that perhaps something like Titanic is.</P>
<P>The thin line between good and great is often crossed in Good Will Huntings
duration  but only to find that it stabs itself in the foot when trying to be a
far too complete film.</P>
