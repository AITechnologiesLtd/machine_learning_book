<P>Fresh off of his Oscar winning performance as Best Supporting Actor in
1997's 'Good Will Hunting', Robin Williams is to be commended for his
efforts in continuing to find good dramatic roles.  In fact, teaming up
with 1996's Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actor in 'Jerry Maguire',
Cuba Gooding Jr., the two of them make an interesting pair on screen, if
only they weren't in such a hauntingly unpleasant film as 'What Dreams
May Come'.  Don't get me wrong.  Unpleasant films can make for good
entertainment if mixed with some elements of film making redemption
contained within the story but this film has about 90% of its running
time locked in the ultimate nightmare about the balance between Heaven
and Hell and then it pays off mildly at the end but I'm ruining nothing
because I won't tell you exactly how except to say otherwise that the
film suffers from over length and has a visual style that is comparable
to a tour of droll and unattractive art.  The acting in this film is,
however, simply superb from all involved.</P>
<P>Williams plays a doctor with two children and a wife (Annabella
Sciorra).  The couple are more than husband and wife as we discover in
the film, they are actually soul mates.  The children die in a dreaded
traffic accident and few years later, after stepping out of his vehicle
to help victims of another traffic accident, Williams is killed by an
oncoming vehicle.  He goes directly to Heaven where he is greeted by
Gooding who is the angel of explanation and a comfort in welcoming
Williams to his new and presumably eternal home.  But there's one
problem.  After being in Heaven for a while, Williams discovers that his
wife committed suicide and went to Hell.  Refusing to accept her fate,
Williams learns that he can go to the farthest depths of the black abyss
to bring her back.</P>
<P>Max Von Sydow plays The Tracker, a figure who takes Williams on his tour
of Hell in search of his wife.  Seeing Von Sydow in this film brings up
memories of 'The Exorcist' as this is another look at the elements of
Hell, striking terror into the hearts of people bound for that terrible
place.</P>
<P>Director Vincent Ward has made a film that is too offbeat to be seen
again and again by mainstream audiences.  Once is more than enough for
this film and the biggest problem the film encounters is that the
screenplay by Ron Bass based on the novel by Richard Matheson, tries too
hard to explain its message of the next world and eventually it over
emphasizes the bearings that make you eligible for your eternal destiny,
no matter what it is.  Vincent Ward's vision of both Heaven and Hell are
convincing but the film's explanation of what makes a person bound for
one place or the other is also confusing and it tries to cover all the
bases in what people have discussed in written theology over the years
or discussed with each other on talk shows, religious programs or even
around the water cooler at work about just WHAT EXACTLY Heaven and Hell
are.</P>
<P>The most exhilarating look at the after life and its qualities designed
to make you feel good are 1978's 'Heaven Can Wait', 'Always' (1989) and
'Ghost' (1990).  These films are a pleasure to watch over and over again
with a richly textured message that makes you feel positive about the
after life, if there is one.  Their entertainment value is simple and
these three films, unlike 'What Dreams May Come', have almost no
religious over tones to think about.</P>
