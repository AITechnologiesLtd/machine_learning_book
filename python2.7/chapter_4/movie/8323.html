                                BATMAN & ROBIN
                          A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1997) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I'm as big a fan of the Batman franchise as any, but I think 
it's time for a mercy killing. BATMAN & ROBIN is easily the worst 
of the four recent BATMAN films. It's about on the level of the 1966 
BATMAN movie; and that's no compliment. The '60s Batman was 
taken as an abomination of comic book purity, but it was at least 
funny and well-written at times. Akiva Goldsman's script for 
BATMAN & ROBIN would probably earn him a D+ in a ninth grade 
creative writing class.</P>
<P>        The dialogue is a long string of horrible puns and cliches, 
and the serious parts are even worse. The core of a good movie is 
good writing, and rotten writing lies at the heart of a bad movie. The 
art direction here is about the same as BATMAN FOREVER, even 
using the same black light costuming and computer-generated 
swooping graphics of Gotham City. The movie looks great but still 
sucks because core is crap. You can dress a turd up in a nice little 
baby bonnet, but it's still a turd.</P>
<P>        Nothing remains the same from movie to movie in the 
BATMAN films. Different costumes, different villians, different 
Batmobile, even a different Batman. In one of those casting 
decisions I'll never understand, they picked George "ER" Clooney 
for BATMAN & ROBIN. He was passable in FROM DUSK TILL 
DAWN, but he does nothing here to distinguish himself as Batman. 
He's neither good nor bad nor memorable, but then again, it doesn't 
really matter who's under the mask as long as it's a slim, dark-haired 
white guy. It could be Howard Stern or John Bon Jovi for all we 
care.</P>
<P>        It's always the villains that distinguish BATMAN films, 
from Jack Nicholson's Joker to Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. 
Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze seemed like a good 
idea until I actually saw him in costume. Head shaved, painted silver 
from head to toe in foreboding Tron armor that glows in the dark. 
The bad writing is spread all around, but Freeze is the only 
character who delivers 100 percent rotten lines, from "The iceman 
cometh!" to "Forecast: cool!" They make comic book dialogue 
balloons seem like they were written by Hemingway.</P>
<P>        The rest of the cast is more or less adequate, although we 
can never get over the garbage that's coming out of their mouths. 
Returning actors Chris O'Donnell as Robin, Michael Gough as 
Alfred and Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon all step right back 
into the roles they've filled before, and cameo players with five or 10 
lines each, like Elle MacPherson as Bruce Wayne's steady girlfriend 
and Vivica A. Fox as Freeze's lusty henchwoman (FOX: I'm hot for 
you. FREEZE: I'm cold for you.) liven things up a little.</P>
<P>        Then there are the two leading babes -- Uma Thurman and 
Alicia Silverstone. Thurman plays comic book creation Poison Ivy, a 
character irresistable to men who is similar to Carolyn "Morticia" 
Jones as Marsha, Queen of Diamonds in the "Batman" TV show. 
She's beguiling as always, even with green plant eyebrows, but her 
character is written as a retread of Catwoman in BATMAN 
RETURNS. Both had origins as hard workers who stumbled upon 
their evil bosses' secrets and then the bosses tried to kill them. 
Catwoman was brought back by cats, now Poison Ivy is revived by 
nature itself.</P>
<P>        Silverstone, who already seems past her prime, is Batgirl, 
whose origin is a retread of Robin's. Like O'Donnell in the last 
movie, she comes to stay at Wayne Manor after her parents are 
killed (I don't think people are allowed into Wayne Manor unless 
their parents are dead), stumbles upon Wayne's secret and decides 
she wants to fight crime too. There's even a repeat of the scene 
where Robin goes out by himself to battle a gang of neon thugs, 
then ends up being bailed by Batman. Here, it's Batgirl who does the 
fighting and Robin who does the bailing.</P>
<P>        Just about everything in BATMAN & ROBIN borrows from 
past films. Mr. Freeze's origin story is similar to Two-Face's. Both 
did good for their fellow man -- Freeze as a scientist trying to find 
the cure for his wife's disease (This is the second time in three years 
Schwarzenegger has been uncredible as a scientist.) and Face as a 
district attorney -- and went awry after an on-the-job accident. 
Freeze falls into a vat of freezing solution and somehow survives, 
although his appearance is greatly altered. In that respect, he might 
as well be the Joker.</P>
<P>        The two villains eventually pair up, just like Penguin and 
Catwoman in BATMAN RETURNS and Riddler and Two-Face in 
BATMAN FOREVER. Villains in Gotham City have to pair up 
sooner or later, and this time there's a third super-villain. It's Poison 
Ivy's henchman Bane, a grunting bohemoth who is created out of 
some kind of super plant solution. In the comic book, Bane was the 
ultra-intelligent villain who put Bruce Wayne out of commission; 
here, he's dumbed down to make Schwarzenegger's character seem 
like his IQ is above 100.</P>
<P>        The plot is pretty shoestring here. Freeze wants to freeze 
the city; Poison Ivy wants to kill Batman and Robin. There's not 
much else to it -- a fourth of the movie is pure, convoluted action, 
another fourth is origin scenes, a third fourth is criminal activity and 
the last part is trouble in the Wayne household. Alfred's dying, and 
they draw it out as much as they possibly can, so that eventually we 
want to kill the old guy ourselves. Then there's Batman and Robin 
fighting amongst themselves over Poison Ivy and how Batman 
always has to be right. The height of this pathetic dramatic 
exchange is Robin's line, "I'm sick of the Batsignal, I want a 
Robin-signal!"</P>
<P>        BATMAN & ROBIN is on the elementary level as far as 
writing goes. Schumacher has taken the worst elements of 
surrealism and bad dialogue in BATMAN FOREVER and run with 
them. Nothing is the least bit believable anymore, from the opening 
stratosphere fight with Freeze on. There's a fifth BATMAN script 
finished, but if it has the name Akiva Goldsman on it, I doubt many 
people would tune in tomorrow. Same bad writing, same plot 
cliches.</P>
