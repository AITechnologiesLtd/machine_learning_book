<PRE>                          THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The long-awaited follow-up to DELICATESSEN is another surrealist
adventure into the questionably sane minds of French creators
Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro.  It's been four years since that
film, and their new picture, THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, is twice as
strange and almost as good.</P>
<P>     A twist on the typical fairy tale, THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is
the story of an evil genius named Krank (Daniel Emilfork) and his
henchmen of mechanically-enhanced Cyclops, six identical Clones (all
played by Dominique Pinon), the tiny and bossy Miss Bismuth (Mireille
Mosse), and a disembodied brain (voiced by Jean-Louis Trintignant)
which provides the philosophical foundation for the group.  The band of
genetically-engineered characters live on a man-made island off shores
of a coastal city, and it is from this city that Krank's thugs kidnap
children.  Why?  Because Krank is unable to dream, he attempts to steal
them from the children's minds.</P>
<P>     When the adopted brother (Joseph Lucien) of a circus strongman
named One (Ron Perlman) is stolen, One goes on a crusade to save him.
On his way, he hooks up with a nine-year-old ingenue/street punk named
Miette (Judith Vittet), and they develop a symbiotic bond in their
quest to destroy Krank's plot.</P>
<P>     If you saw DELICATESSEN (and I highly recommend you do), you'll
know what I mean when I say it gets *much* stranger than this.  Full of
vibrant imagery and elaborate sets that seem half from the 1700's and
half from the 2100's, THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN pushes style to the
limit, while occasionally causing substance to lag behind.  While the
movie sometimes gets so convoluted it's impossible to tell exactly
what's going on, it's always fun to watch.</P>
<P>     Be sure you know what's on the menu if you decide to see this
film.  Expect some incredible effects, especially Pinon's unprecedented
six-fold presence, plus one of the best serendipitous-chain-of-events
sequences ever filmed.  Angelo Badalamenti (who scored "Twin Peaks")
provides appropriately haunting music as well.  You might not "get"
this film when you leave the theater, but you'll be sure to have had a
terrific time.</P>
