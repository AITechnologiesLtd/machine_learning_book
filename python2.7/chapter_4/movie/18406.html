<P>THE SCHOOL OF FLESH (ECOLE DE lA CHAIR, L') (Director: Benoit Jacquot;
cast: Isabelle Huppert (Dominique), Vincent Martinez (Quentin), Vincent
Lindon (Chris), Marthe Keller (Madame Thorpe), Dani=E8le Dubroux (Marine
Thorpe), Francois Berleand (Soukaz), 1998-France)</P>
<P>Adapted from a novel by Yukio Mishima, THE SCHOOL OF FLESH tries to
get us to believe in the sexual relationship and power play between a
wealthy middle-aged Parisian woman Dominique (Huppert), who is in the
fashion business. She falls madly in love with a much younger, Arabic
lower-class boxer, bartender and bisexual hustler named Quentin
(Martinez), and is willing to pay him to live with her. His great sex
is supposed to be the reason she loses control of herself and can't be
without him and will do anything for him, even as he acts nasty and
repugnant and they have nothing in common that they can talk about,
only sharing in an animal-like lust. This is asking a lot to believe,
and though it is possible, it would have been more possible to believe
if Quentin possessed some charm or something about him that would give
us a clue that he was such a good catch, because he sure couldn't act,
and since he is the focal point of all the attention, able to have his
way with either men or women, we should also have felt this
electricity generated on screen, instead of being forced fed by the
director into believing something was happening when we couldn't see
it.</P>
<P>Just what was supposed to be so compelling about this relationship, that
would make it interesting ? I'm afraid I don't have the answer, since I
can't find a thing about this relationship or this movie that kept me
tuned into it, as I tended to drift out of the story somewhere in the
middle, and just watched for the street scenes of Paris in the
background, which I found to be more pleasurable viewing than the movie
itself, even more erotic than the unerotic love scenes between the
lovers, and this is being said by a big fan of Isabelle Huppert, who is
usually quite engaging in the various roles she has played during her
long career, but here it is embarrassing for me to watch her vacuous
performance.</P>
<P>We first see Dominque pick Quentin up in the gay bar he is working at,
after several intense eye contacts, where a former gay lover and
employee of the fashionable gay bar where Quentin works, Chris (Lindon),
explains to Dominque, as he is badly emoting his part as a queen,  the
lure and treachery and violence of Quentin. But this does not stop this
ill-conceived relationship from taking place, as they spend a night
together, first in a power struggle to see who is boss, as she takes him
to a fancy restaurant which he pretends not to like, and then he takes
her to the arcades, which she honestly detests, this culminates in a
night of lovemaking, where sex is acclaimed as the sole keeper of the
relationship, in fact the sex is so good that he refuses payment for it,
but she insists, wanting to keep him on her payroll, not willing to take
the chance of losing such a good catch. The only problem with this, is
that we didn't see how good the sex was, we had to take the word of the
actors that it was so good, as dialogue came out of their mouths that is
totally forgetable or regretable or whatever, but their love was not
passionate or credible.</P>
<P>Once Quentin is paid for, that is his so-called debts are paid off by
Dominque to Chris, who is probably his pimp, the story limply moves
along, as some subtext to the already lame story is introduced, about
wealthy friends of Dominque's meeting Quentin through Dominque and
Quentin marrying their spoiled daughter with her parents' approval, that
was unconvincingly done.</P>
<P>There is one line from the film that summed up how I really felt about
what I was seeing, when at a fashion party for Dominque's wealthy
Parisian fashion clients, Quentin tells her, "seeing all these rich
people makes me want to puke." Quentin must be psychic or something,
because he was just regurgitating what I was thinking about the
characters in this film.</P>
