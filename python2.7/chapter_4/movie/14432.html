<P>I like this film, despite a few people not thinking it is ( either ) good or
worth it.</P>
<P>And perhaps much of it is because I like to 'study' historical characters in
the field of the arts, compared to their artistic endeavors.</P>
<P>In this film, we can see a little of FRANZ LISZT, FREDERIC CHOPIN, GEORGE
SAND, and a few other artists which stuck together, as the scenes in Europe
tend to do.</P>
<P>Franz Liszt is a part of the 'high' society which has helped him become
famous for his talented ability to stand up to the already famous pianist
Chopin.  And as a member of that society which champions as patrons of  the
arts, he is also affected by the many women, in search of a match to set
them up for life.  The writer George Sand ( a woman ) happens to be on the
outside circles of this group, and does her writing in her own manner
despite herself, and manages to do alright, even competing with  the women
who are always in a position to outdo each other.  The game is fun as long
as no one steps on anyone's toes.  On a given evening, Sand discovers the
music of Chopin, and proceeds to write one of her books, which gets quoted
all around, but is hidden from Chopin by his lover since she doesn't want to
lose him.  The lover manages to use quotes from the book and keep the
composer's attention, until one day he happens to discover why it is that
this other woman is infatuated with him.  He
reads the book, and voila, a new relationship is born.</P>
<P>While there may not quite be a lot of truth, or guarantee that it is all
quite correct, there is a nice touch of the 'muse' which drives many artists
to create what they do, and in this area, the film is excellent.  This is a
film for both literature, and music lovers, for it treats both quite
importantly.  And as such, it also puts down the mistress system as a bit
corrupt on its own feet, and that even women are adapt at playing this game.
At the time, I presume that it was the thing to do, and was expected to be
done without second thought by any woman.  Whereas the English Restoration
lifestyle openly flaunted the 'cuckold' theory, here they are at least a bit
more modest, except when the lights are out.  The ladies even suggest
several times that they had had affairs with other men, in some orgies,
which has always been very well known enjoyment of the European upper crust.</P>
<P>Judy Davis as George Sand is very good, as is Julian Sands as Liszt.  And it
certainly is ten million miles from the Ken Russell treatment of the same
subject.  This is serious about the art, where Ken's is a bit more on the
unusual side, if not too extravagant.  All the ladies in this film have a
good time as the courtesans they are, and the film plods
along an incredible barrage of gossip and small events, which make it
difficult to follow at times.  It's difficult to realize that a subtle shot
of two women in the background chatting, will eventually come up as an
agreement to get something done.  But it all ties together well in the end.</P>
<P>A FILM FOR MUSIC ( AND LITERATURE ) LOVERS. Someone says to
DELACROIX....paint something 'dead' this time.... you have to know the
romantic artists for this film to make better sense.</P>
