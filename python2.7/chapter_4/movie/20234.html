<PRE>The 13th Warrior
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) THE 13TH WARRIOR is a fantasy/action movie that has
none of the trappings of the usual modern action movies. There are no
snappy insults, no romantic subplots, no comic sidekicks, and no
gratuitous pop songs blaring over the film or the credits. None of them
were missed.</P>
<P>It's worth mentioning that the two producers of this film were the
story's author (Michael Crichton) and the director. Perhaps it is
because the people close to the story had control, that the film didn't
become watered down. If so, it's a pairing I hope to see more of.  </P>
<P>Antonio Banderas plays Ahmed, an Arab poet. He is caught in a
compromising affair with a young princess and banished, along with his
teacher (Omar Sharif). The two head north out of the city.</P>
<P>Later, fleeing some bandits, the two invite themselves into the
hospitality of a tribe of Vikings who have wandered south. The next day,
a boy arrives from farther north, asking for help back in his home
village. The Viking fates decree that 13 warriors must go help, and that
the 13th man be not a northman. Ahmed the poet is drafted and his
teacher is sent back home.</P>
<P>The thirteen arrive at the besieged village to find almost no men of
fighting age left alive. The king welcomes the heroes-to-be, and tells
them that the Vin, a mysterious race of man-bear creatures, have been
making raids. The Vin always decapitate their victims and gnaw on the
remains.</P>
<P>It eventually becomes clear that 13 warriors and a village of farmers
are no match for a burgeoning tribe of cannibals. Expecting death and
defeat, they struggle for a plan that will make every life count.</P>
<P>Not many movies portray Vikings in the dark ages. In fact, the only one
that has had an impact on my generation is MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY
GRAIL. So the setting in THE 13TH WARRIOR is fairly original for 1999
(that is to say, unexploited by Hollywood).</P>
<P>The movie gives us a speculative glance at the lives the Vikings might
have led as well. Since our hero is an outsider, he gives the audience
someone to identify with as he learns their customs and ways. Having
that hero be Muslim adds an exotic flavor. It makes the entire setting
all the more exotic and foreign.</P>
<P>The movie has high production values, (a trait I admittedly respect more
highly than other critics). I was impressed by the look of the movie,
and by some of the obviously unfaked settings. A Viking village was at
least partially created, as was a great wooden Viking ship. A long scene
in a cave appeared to actually be lit by the torches carried by the
characters, and the cave itself appeared to be real, or at least made of
more substantial stuff than can be seen in STAR TREK.</P>
<P>Much of the movie was shot on location in British Columbia and other
parts of Canada. The cinematography (by Peter Menzies) captures the cold
outdoor atmosphere of northern climes. Whether it was the unsoftened
shadows at midday or some trick with the lens, the air in the north
looked crisp and cold.</P>
<P>In contrast, the nighttime battles and inky cave interiors were a dark
black, lit by harsh orange torches. The look could have been a cheap way
to save on precise special effects, but it was an effective way to
convey fear and claustrophobia.</P>
<P>One last noteworthy detail is the way in which McTiernan handles the
language barrier between Arabic, Latin, and Norse. It's the same trick
he used in THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, and it works very well. Perhaps he
drew too much attention to his trick, but it forestalled an objection
that had been forming in my head.</P>
<P>Yet in spite of the best things about THE 13TH WARRIOR, I still found
myself less than entirely engaged. I kept waiting for the REALLY
thrilling parts, always expecting something more. Clearly, my
expectations were wrong, but it's also probably fair to criticize the
movie for being slow in parts, and for meandering at the beginning.</P>
<P>THE 13TH WARRIOR never really wowed me while I was watching it, but I
grew more impressed with it afterwards. You won't find explosive,
blockbuster action in THE 13TH WARRIOR, but see it if you'd like
something a notch older, more serious, and more mature.</P>
