<P>Because many Americans feel awkward around people with handicaps, one 
might think a film starring two mentally challenged young people would 
not have a chance.  But the acting of Juliette Lewis, as Carla Tate, and 
Giovanni Ribisi, as Danny McMann, saves the film from the dangers of 
patronizing overtures and maudlin sentimentality.</P>
<P>Carla Lewis, the daughter of wealthy parents, has spent the last decade 
growing up in an exclusive boarding school for the mentally challenged.  
The film opens with her father, Dr. Radley Tate (Tom Skerritt), picking 
her up and flying with her back to their mansion and family.  Mother 
Elizabeth (Diane Keaton) is overprotective, but eventually gives in to 
various manifestations of Carla's independence.  First, Carla desires a 
high school diploma, and after her mother's resistance she succeeds in 
enrolling in a vocational school, her goal to become a veterinarian's 
assistant.  Goal number two is to obtain her own apartment, an idea she 
conceives initially from school mate Danny McMann.  Danny is also 
mentally challenged, and lives in an apartment paid for by his father.</P>
<P>Of course Carla's largest wish is for freedom within her relationship 
with Danny.  As the two fall in love, Carla becomes more concerned with 
her mother's opposition.  Carla has seen how her mother treats Heather 
and Caroline, Carla's sisters;  Mrs. Tate bullies one about her 
impending wedding, and refuses even to meet the lesbian lover of the 
other.  So the stage is set for extended conflicts, especially after 
Danny alienates himself from the family by humiliating Carla in front of 
the Tates' friends at Sutter Hills Country Club.</P>
<P>The partial result of these conflicts is a predictability that hinders 
the film.  Diane Keaton's character is so afflicted by tunnel vision 
that we begin to dislike her.  Her bull-headedness may have roots we can 
understand - an old worry about protecting the girl from childhood 
taunting.  But writers Bob Brunner and Garry Marshall extend her concern 
into obsession.  At least Keaton never becomes hysterical, but it's just 
hard to watch her redundant characterization.  As her husband Radley 
Tate - a dentist, we presume, as he gives out toothbrushes for Halloween 
- Tom Skerritt is miscast.  Skerritt is the right age to have three 
grown daughters, but perhaps the role is underdeveloped.  In any case, 
Skerritt does not seem to inhabit the role in a sense large enough to 
make it convincing.</P>
<P>Hector Elizondo gets to play a more fleshed-out father figure.  As 
Ernie, the owner of the apartment occupied by Danny, Elizondo is 
compassionate and supportive, if a little dry.  He also gets to show off 
his guitar playing skills, and it's always good when a director utilizes 
an actor's particular talents.  Ernie is another example of the film's 
realism, the extra dimension added by a well-written supporting role.</P>
<P>The best things about the picture are Lewis and Ribisi, though.  The 
nuances of their performances are quite engaging.  Just as Lewis seems 
to be in peril of over-acting, she tempers her portrayal with the 
pronunciation of a single word or a careful stride.  It is a studied 
performance - one can imagine Lewis practicing how to move or react;  
but the sweetness she brings to the role imbues the movie with a 
lightness that makes the viewer more comfortable with the subject 
matter.  Ribisi does not emphasize his mannerisms as much as Lewis does, 
but neither is his manner subtle.  "I love you more than marching bands 
and more than cookie-baking," Danny tells Carla, with one line showing a 
sincerity that makes us love him.</P>
<P>Another admirable trait the film displays is not solving serious 
problems easily.  The approach is almost unsettling when the characters 
disagree to the point of alienation;  although it takes awhile to set up 
and then to close these conflicts (the film runs two hours and ten 
minutes, just a little long), we are gratified by the realistic 
handling.  </P>
<P>For fans of 'The Graduate,' there is a wonderful schtick in which Danny 
plays the Dustin Hoffman role.  The older film is worked in wonderfully, 
and is played both for comic and serious effect.  Viewers should take 
note of another scene, a flashback Carla recalls as she ascends the 
stairs to her old bedroom.  Kendra Krull plays the young Carla with a 
sign "Follow Stupid" taped to her back, a line of children following her 
up the stairs.  When Carla lashes out and pushes a teasing boy down the 
stairs, we see the older Carla's horror instantly relived, a mix of 
guilt and revulsion at mockery.  And Carla is made touchingly human, 
feeling emotions as sharply as anyone around her.</P>
<P>Even though all the characters are not flawlessly written, 'The Other 
Sister' is a moving and original treatment of the boy-meets-girl, loses 
her, etc. scenario.  The film is to be admired for its gutsy approach to 
an oft-avoided topic:  it neither condescends nor lectures about 
society's treatment of people with handicaps.   'The Other Sister is 
rated PG-13 due to discussions of sex, and would be fine for children 12 
and up.</P>
