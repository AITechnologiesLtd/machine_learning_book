<PRE>                          THE ENGLISH PATIENT
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: In the late days of World War II in
          Italy a badly burned patient is the center of two
          love stories, one that led up to his plane crash,
          one that is going on while he is cared for.  This
          is a long and a lushly produced romance with a few
          surprises along the way.  The photography and the
          period feel are a definite advantage.  This is a
          film that is at once thoughtful and sensuous,
          though it may not pack the emotional impact it
          wants to with all audiences.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     A biplane flies over the North African desert, the pilot alert,
the passenger, a beautiful woman draped sensuously over the side of the
cockpit.  The plane flies too close to a German position below and they
fire at invader overhead.  The plane bursts into flames.  The pilot
tries to pull out the woman in front of him but ends up being badly
burned himself as the plane crashes.  Some passing Arabs rescue the
badly-burned man and take him to a hospital.  The man cannot tell the
medics what his name is or how he came to be flying over the desert.
The story advances in two lines, one of the disfigured patient (played
by Ralph Fiennes) and his relationship with Hana (Juliette Binoche), a
Canadian nurse who more or less adopts the dying man. Hana is a little
shell-shocked herself as anybody that she grows to care about dies or
is killed soon after. Feeling almost cursed she forms a close
attachment to the scarred patient who is apparently dying anyway. Hana
transports the patient to an abandoned farmhouse near Leghorn/Livorno
and begins tending him full- time.  Soon they are joined a the
farmhouse by Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who takes a strange interest in
the scarred man and at times seems to know something of the patient's
past.  They are joined by two more residents, bomb disposal experts.</P>
<P>     The flashback story starts in 1938 before the war and leads up to
the plane crash.  The man who will be the patient is Count Laszlo
Almasy, a handsome young man in the employ of the British government.
Based in Cairo, Almasy is taking part in a project to map the uncharted
regions of the North African desert.  He makes friends with Geoffrey
and Katherine Clifton (Colin Firth and Kristin Scott Thomas).  Together
they discover in the desert a cave with paintings of great
archeological significance.  This throws Laszlo and Katherine together
frequently and though they try hard to ignore each other, but there is
a sexual tension between them and they will inevitably be drawn
together.  The film is based on the novel by Michael Ondaatje, who was
born in Sri Lanka and educated in England, but lives in Canada.
Anthony Minghella wrote and directed this adaptation.</P>
<P>     Ralph Fiennes gives a cool and controlled performance as he always
seems to do.  As in his other films he cuts a dashing figure but
underplays rather than overplaying.  Even in scenes that should call
for deep emotion, his performances are muted and controlled.  He lets
the viewer read emotion into his actions and but for the exception of a
few scenes, that is true for most of the cast of THE ENGLISH PATIENT.
Kristen Scott Thomas is radiant in the desert but uninvolving, more an
icon and an image than a fully developed character.  She seems more
willing to bare her body than her emotions.  Though she has more screen
time than Binoche, I suspect, she never exhibits a personality that
goes much beyond bland.  Binoche is sort of the ideal nurse, but we see
little of what makes her fixate on this one patient.  Still we are able
to react with her in ways we cannot with the other three leads.</P>
<P>     John Seale photographs the story, using pleasant aerial
photography and sprawling views of the desert. There is an effective
scene of a sandstorm.  Minghella takes the image of the Swimming Man,
from the cave found in the desert, and uses it as an image repeatedly
as if it has for him specific meaning.  In fact he opens the film with
the image of the Swimming Man.  He must be seeing Almasy as being in
some way the Swimming Man.  It is a mysterious visual image to make as
important as it is in the visuals.  Its meaning remains a matter of
conjecture for the audience.  For the most part Minghella places
emotional barriers between the characters and the audience, all but
Binoche.  For the most part these figures remain as untouchable and
unemotional as the swimming figures on the cave wall.  Then
surprisingly toward the end of the film Minghella does give us one very
tense, almost melodramatic, scene.  It seem almost a throwaway and out
of place.</P>
<P>     THE ENGLISH PATIENT is a truly adult love story, generally well-
crafted if a little uninvolving.  I rate it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
