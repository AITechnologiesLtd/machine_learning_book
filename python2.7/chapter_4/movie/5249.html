<PRE>                       THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS & DOGS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     If you are looking for an entertaining film, and who is not, you
could do a lot worse than dropping in on THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND
DOGS.   The title comes from a radio talk show whose host, a
veterinarian,  is Abby Barnes (Janeane Garofolo).   With charm and wit
she hands out advice to those who call in asking for  advice about
their animals.  Abby is very good at helping those with problems but
her own, as is often the case in Life,  are not as easy for her to
solve.</P>
<P>     For one thing, the adorable and charming Abby thinks she is
neither adorable nor charming, so when Brian (Ben Chaplin) phones in
about his dog who loves to lick his face and Brian likes both the
advice and the sound of the voice dispensing the advice , Abby is at a
loss when Brian asks if he can meet her at a restaurant .and thank her
personally.  "What do you look like?" Brian asks.   "There goes the
ballgame," Abby thinks.   In a panic she describes herself as tall and
blonde, a description that  fits her neighbor, Noelle (Uma Thurman).
In any case, she has no intention of meeting Brian so what is a little
lie?</P>
<P>     Much like a female version of Cyrano, THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND
DOGS, has just what it takes to make the film so much fun to watch.
Brian searches for Abby and finds her. As the tall, willowy blonde
Noelle happens to be visiting her friend, it is natural that Brian
thinks Noelle is Abby; the description fits what Abby had told him.
>From there, Brian's falling in love with the woman he thinks is Abby,
makes for a funfilled film of mistaken identity but with its own
clever version.   It's a delight.</P>
