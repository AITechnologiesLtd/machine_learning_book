<PRE>                       BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     I realize, right from the start, that absolutely *nothing* I say
about BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA is going to sway you at all, one
way or another, about whether or not to see the film.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, I'm going to comment, mainly out of habit.</P>
<P>     If you've read this far, I just have to wonder -- what are you
expecting from this film?  A work of genius?  A breakthrough performance
for the two delinquent boys made famous by MTV?  What kind of a bunghole
reads a review of a Beavis and Butt-head movie without knowing from the
start exactly what's coming???</P>
<P>     BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA is exactly what it claims to be --
no more, no less.  It's about 78 minutes of spare animation, butt jokes,
rock & roll music, and enough Technicolor slapstick to... um, well,
um... hu-huh... I said "stick."</P>
<P>     Okay, now *I've* got Mike Judge's grating characters on the brain,
so I've got to give him credit.  Who would have thought that in the time
it takes to eat lunch, two kids who do nothing but watch TV all day
could get involved with a tale of a stolen biological warfare device,
hitmen, ATF agents, and the collapse of Hoover Dam, and live to watch TV
again?  Far-fetched, you say?  It's a *cartoon*, people.</P>
<P>     Well, the film is already destined to be a cult classic, I'm sure,
so I guess you'd better see it too.  For the record, the jokes are above
average for typical B&B material, there are a number of celebrity voice
cameos that I won't spoil for you, plus enough movie spoofs to entertain
even a non-fan of the show.  And, it's only 78 minutes long -- it's
like, you can either catch the movie, or you can watch an episode of
"Baywatch."  Take your pick.</P>
<P>     In the end, I was relatively amused and entertained.  Beavis and
Butt-head "do" America -- in every sense of the title -- and the movie
is simply a fine homage to a movie whose parts add up to less than its
whole.</P>
<PRE>     Hu-huh, hu-huh.  I said "hole."</PRE>
