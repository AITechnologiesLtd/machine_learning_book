<PRE>The Olympiad (1938) 205m</PRE>
<P>Leni Riefenstahl's film of the 1936 Berlin Olympic games is considered to be 
among the greatest documentaries ever made.  It's important both as a 
historical document and as an example of film-making technique, but while 
the grandeur of the event and the film's mammoth running time do infuse it 
with an epic sense, modern-day audiences may find their attention wandering. 
  Hitler and Goebbels saw the spectacle of the games as an opportunity to 
show off the new Reich, but neither were responsible for employing 
Riefenstahl, who had made the jingoistic Nazi rally film TRIUMPH OF THE WILL 
a couple of years earlier.  Riefenstahl's attachment to the project, via an 
Olympic official, ensured that the film of the event would not escape being 
viewed as a propaganda piece in itself,  although this seems arbitrary 
insofar as the Olympics are a hype vehicle for every participating country 
anyway.  Riefenstahl, who had previously directed and acted in features, 
puts a creative spin on her document and utilizes different technological 
innovations.  She embellishes the events without changing facts, but lays 
herself open to charges of pro-fascist imagery - the opening sequence, for 
example, depicts buffed, nude athletes flexing their muscles against 
dramatic skies and has obvious Aryan overtones.  But if this is the case, 
why would she include so much footage of black athlete Jesse Owens winning 
event after event and debunking the Aryan supremacy myth right before 
Hitler's eyes?  Riefenstahl has always claimed her life's work as being 
artistically motived, and it's at least easier to believe this in OLYMPIAD 
than it is in TRIUMPH.  Notice that there wasn't any of this fuss when a 
group of directors similarly fetishized athletic bodies in the 1972 Olympics 
movie VISIONS OF EIGHT.</P>
<P>OLYMPIAD is split into two parts, 'The Festival of the People' and 'The 
Festival of Beauty'.  Part one focuses on track and field while part two 
looks at other events outside the stadium - but there's only so much running 
and jumping a viewer can endure.  By the time the film returns to pentathlon 
and decathlon events already covered in the first half, it starts getting 
tedious.  OLYMPIAD doesn't start off too excitingly (watching people 
throwing shot and hammers isn't too exciting at the best of times) but picks 
up once the races start - visually these are more involving because at a 
glance we can tell who is winning at any moment throughout the event, even 
if we don't know who they are.  You'd have to assume that Riefenstahl did 
the best job she could editing the 400,000 feet of film she'd retrieved from 
the 30 camera operators stationed around the Games, and there are some 
interesting moments to be found.  For example, the 1500 meters is filmed in 
one continuous take (it's odd seeing the New Zealand victor accompanied by 
sieg heils from the crowd);  we see a shot of Hitler looking deflated after 
a German relay runner drops the baton when victory appears imminent; 
Riefenstahl inserts shaky close-ups of hands and feet as a marathon runner 
is on the home stretch, projecting to us his physical and mental exhaustion; 
the horses on a steeplechase regularly dump their riders into a ditch and a 
pond; and in the film's famous closing montage, Riefenstahl makes high 
divers appear weightless by filming them at dizzying angles and variable 
speeds.  It's also interesting to see how much has changed since the days of 
the 11th Olympics - the stadiums and uniforms aren't plastered with crass 
product logos, the winners are presented with wreaths instead of medals, and 
the sporting equipment is simpler (e.g. non-flexible vaulting poles).  It's 
disquieting to see competitors on the shooting range firing at human-shaped 
targets when we know that World War II was only three years away.  Couple 
that with the final images of the flags of all nations bowing slowly to the 
ground and the smoke from the extinguished Olympic flame rising into an 
ominous sky, and you'll see why its impossible to view OLYMPIAD nowadays 
without irony.</P>
