<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A bloodthirsty revenge film based on a childish incident in a nightclub,
where three yuppie office workers make fun of the way three men at the
next table are dressed. The director has gone after style and has thrown
substance out the window, as the film follows this war of words as it
escalates into an ugly scene of macho posturing and then into gore. The
three stylishly-dressed ad executives are: Taki (Kato), who is prone to
wearing Hermes ties and acting cool; Nambu (Takeuchi), who is the most
bellicose; and, Konishi (Nakano), who is bespectacled, fearful and
pudgy. They leave the bar after the other table answers their taunts
back, and when Konishi returns to get his umbrella, he is set upon and
has a broken bottle smashed over his face, causing him to be
hospitalized.</P>
<P>The film takes this childish revenge-fantasy film into an unbelievably
crude depiction of gun fights, arrow attacks, knife and fist fights, and
a scissor attack. All the fight scenes were choreographed and looked as
phony as Confederate money. The film was a clear imitation of a Hong
Kong action film. The protagonists were three unlikable snobs, concerned
with their image, talking about name-brand products as if someone was an
idiot who didn't adhere to their tastes, and getting into the tussle
because they were loudly attacking the other table for being tacky.</P>
<P>This unoriginal film has nothing to say about these faceless executives
or their counterpoints, who up the dissing into physical violence. The
mystery is supposed to be sparked by guessing if the antagonists are
office workers, yakuza, or police. The paranoid thriller is callibrated
to show how the men feel when their masculinity is being questioned.</P>
<P>Not able to forget the attack on Konishi, even after he is released from
the hospital and is walking with his pals down an alleyway, the men
recognize the Rolex watch guy and pounce on him, supposedly beating him
to death. Things take a harrowing turn for the men, as they each receive
phone calls threatening revenge for the death of their friend. But to
their surprise, no body is ever reported found, and the police are not
looking for them. The menacing caller tells them, he is not concerned
about telling the police, he'll take care of the problem.</P>
<P>Poor Konishi is severely worked over and sent to the hospital again,
this time with scissor wounds to the stomach, when he agrees to meet the
threatening caller. Nambu is attacked with arrows and slain, while Taki
picks up a girl on the rainy road, Rika (Hiromi), with whom he has a
quickie. He is supposedly serious about his workplace girlfriend Reiko
(Yumi), but finds time to play, probably to take his mind off those
coming after him.</P>
<P>With the death of Nambu, Taki becomes frightened and goes to the police,
telling them the truth. But they can't help. The main villain, the guy
with the Zippo lighter, meets up with Taki and they have one of those
ridiculous Hong Kong gunfights. Zippo is one of those villains who just
can't seem to die (I suppose he's supernatural!). The awkward story
moves on its pointless and bloody way, clearing nothing up by the end,
though it tried when it had Detective Karaki (Nezu) say that the
attackers are part of a new Japan, where punks who used to become part
of a yakuza crime family now become businessmen.</P>
<P>Shundo Ohkawa's direction is meant to be glossy, high-tech, but suffers
from being amateurish and outdated, overrun with trick camera shots to
capture the violence. The director's color scheme was nightmarish and
depressing, some scenes were smothered in metallic blue shadings.</P>
<P>The film was about as uninspiring as reading GQ. The only fun in the
film, was in the opening scene, watching the two tables trade
smart-alecky digs at each other, other than that this film was as much
fun as watching someone get hit over the head with a bottle.</P>
