<PRE>Topsy-Turvy</PRE>
<P>Gilbert and Sullivan and so much more.</P>
<P>A film review by Robert Marley - Copyright © 2000 filmcritic.com</P>
<P>One of my earliest childhood remembrances was watching a performance of
H.M.S. Pinafore. I thought it was really neat. The costumes and music
were amazing and even though I couldn't understand all of what was going
on, I was fascinated by how all of these people worked together.</P>
<P>Now 20 years later, while watching another Gilbert and Sullivan
performance (of sorts) I am still thinking the same things.</P>
<P>`Topsy Turvy' is the story about the two collaborators who during the
late 19th century created such musical masterpieces as H.M.S. Pinafore,
the Pirates of Penzance, The Mikado and many others.</P>
<P>William Schwenck Gilbert (Played by Jim Broadbent) is the librettist,
writing the words. Arthur Sullivan (played by Allan Corduner) is the
composer, writing the music. Gilbert is the very model of a 19th-Century
British gentleman, an overly proper married man certain that he knows
best – which he often does. Sullivan lives a freer life, almost
libertine by comparison; but there is a seriousness of purpose in him.</P>
<P>For nearly a decade, Gilbert and Sullivan's collaborations have
delighted the English people. Their popular comic operas have recouped
handsomely for the successful Savoy Theatre; impresario Richard D'Oyly
Carte (played by Ron Cook) himself is a stabilizing influence, gently
but firmly overseeing the two men.</P>
<P>But, in 1884, as a London heat wave cuts into the theater trade, their
latest work, `Princess Ida' receives only lukewarm press. Sullivan
wants to quit and compose more serious music, but the two are
contractually obligated to create a new work for Carte. Sullivan rejects
Gilbert's next idea as `topsy-turvy' and unbelievable, and although
Gilbert tries to accommodate him, they cannot agree. Mired at a creative
impasse, Gilbert and Sullivan can barely converse.</P>
<P>Then, Gilbert's wife, Lucy `Kitty': Gilbert (Lesley Manville), drags him
along to a Japanese exhibition. Exposure to the very different culture
sparks inspiration in Gilbert. He rebounds, conceiving `The Mikado.' The
concept encourages Sullivan, and the production comes together, which is
when the TRULY hard work begins.</P>
<P>Written and Directed by Mike Leigh (Secrets and Lies, Life is Sweet) the
film is visually impressive and amazingly well performed. However, the
pace of the movie is leisurely at best, which unfortunately makes for an
ass-numbing collection of costumes, characters and sub-plots. There are
so many characters and background stories introduced through the film
that you almost need a playbill just to keep up with everything. What's
worse, is that after spending so much time working through all of the
developing plots, all the stories seems to get wrapped up at a blinding
pace towards the last 30 minutes of the film.</P>
<P>Fans of Gilbert and Sullivan's work will no-doubt delight in the
fantastic musical numbers (some performed in their operatic entirety),
but will they want to see all of the this combined with the backstage
bickering and headaches that it took to accomplish such memorable
pieces?</P>
<P>Overall the movie looks good, the costumes are beautiful and its
fascinating to watch all the people working together, but when spread
out over the 160 minutes of running length, it just makes for a long,
drawn-out film appealing primarily to most viewers' mothers.</P>
<P>My opinion: a good rental for a rainy day.</P>
