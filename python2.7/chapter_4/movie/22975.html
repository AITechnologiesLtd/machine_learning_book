<P>Orphans.  How they are often forgotten.  Having known a couple growing up, I
won't pretend to know what it feels like to be one, but some of their
stories are unforgettable.  'The Cider House Rules' takes a look at the
orphan's way of life, from a positive and very sensitive point of view and
stretches its story to include the adventures of one who is now a man,
setting off to experience the world for himself.  Tobey Maguire
('Pleasantville'), is Homer Wells, a young man working at an orphanage (and
abortion clinic) in Maine during World War II and is loved by all who live
and work there.  Homer is a right hand man to Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael
Caine...playing with an American accent in his finest work in years which
will bring him an Oscar nomination).  Dr. Larch sees Homer as the one who
will carry on his work at the orphanage when he leaves.  Community
bureaucrats want Larch relieved of his position.  Some critics are making
this film a political issue by saying that it is really about abortion at
its deepest roots but this argument doesn't wash.  Abortions are only a part
of the story to wash away the false notion that they didn't occur 50 or 60
years ago.  It's like a gangster film.  The main plot is about crime.  You
don't look at a gangster film as being a study of guns!</P>
<P>Dr. Larch comforts the boys each night as they get tucked in and as he turns
off the light and closes the door to the room, he says: "Good night, you
princes of Maine, you kings of New England!"  Homer desires to leave the
orphanage and see the world for himself.  He is tempted by Candy Kendall
(Charlize Theron) and her boyfriend Walter (Paul Rudd).  They arrive one day
at the orphanage clinic to have an abortion and Homer decides to go off with
them and experience the free side of life.  Homer says that he's never seen
the ocean and gets a chance to look at it.  He also takes up a job picking
apples at Walter's family owned farm and befriends Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo)
and his daughter Rose Rose (Erykah Badu).  After going off to fight in the
war, Walter leaves Candy behind and she and Homer have an affair.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the story shifts back and fourth at times to the adventures of
Homer's strengthening as a man and the events taking place at the orphanage.
One of the things most unexpected but welcomed as a piece of exceptional
drama, are the scenes which take place at the farm where Homer works.  There
is a story of disenchantment involving incest, violence and disagreement
about the way of life there.  The film is ideal at examining the reality
that people from "the greatest generation" were the same as people today in
terms of personal behaviour, and in the film industry recently, we have had
a number of examples that show that times change but people don't.</P>
<P>The film is directed by Lasse Hallstrom, the Swedish director responsible
for such films as 'My Life as a Dog', 'Once Around' and 'What's Eating
Gilbert Grape?', a movie with a curious tie-in to this film about a young
man coming of age and seeing the world in more realistic terms than he's
been used to.  The film is also written by John Irving, based on his novel
and his screenplay is without pretentious qualities, sentimentality or
cliches.</P>
<P>As for the cast, there are many things you can say.  I look back to 1987's
'The Untouchables' and my father and I still have a debate over the way
Kevin Costner played Elliot Ness.  My father called it a "wet wash cloth
performance" while I was impressed by it.  The whole point of the film was
to draw wisdom from a more experienced character, that of Jimmy Malone (Sean
Connery).  That's the way I saw 'The Cider House Rules' play out.  Tobey
Maguire's character of Homer is rather toned done but Maguire draws his
experience in life from those more experienced and becomes a better man for
it, especially when he finds out at the end what Dr. Larch does for him.</P>
<P>Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo, along with Jane Alexander and Kathy Baker who
plays nurses at the clinic are characters who aren't really given a deep
sense of focus as much as they should be but their contributions to the film
and still significant.  Michael Caine is the real treat of this film, giving
his best performance since his Oscar win in 1986 for best supporting actor
in 'Hannah and Her Sisters'.  Caine won rave reviews in 1998 as a third
string English talent agent in 'Little Voice' and while winning a Golden
Globe for it, he was snubbed by the Oscars and didn't even get nominated for
the role.  'The Cider House Rules' may bring Caine another Oscar win as he
was sort of the surprise winner in 1986 and Caine's clever talent as an
actor is matched by his willingness to diversify himself and he is one of
the best at it.</P>
