<P>Kid yourself not, Patch Adams is an awful comedy. The jokes are rare, 
and often are overpowered by the circumstances surrounding them. 
Fortunately, though, despite Universal's advertising campaign, Patch 
Adams is far from a comedy, and most certainly a drama. And one of the 
best films of the year at that. Through a combination of a strong story, 
brilliant acting, and overall power, Patch Adams is one of the best all 
around films of the decade.</P>
<P>Hunter "Patch" Adams is a suicidal mental patient in the beginning of 
the film. Early scenes show him as what appears to be the one sane 
person in a crowd of insanity. Much resembling the 1975 film, One Flew 
Over The Cuckoo's Nest, this part of the film is remarkably powerful and 
stunningly effective. But the similarities between the two films are few 
enough that Nicholson's role seems to be missing, and just the scenario 
seems familiar.</P>
<P>Soon Patch leaves this institution, and begins a new life with a new 
goal. His objective is to become a doctor and help people. So it is that 
we now move to medical school, were the rest of the film is to take 
place. Patch is a new student who is clearly older than the rest of the 
crowd. He has a "prick" for a roommate, and is immediately thrown into 
classes that offers principles he disagrees with. He becomes a rebel 
constantly fighting for humanity, and is perceived to be far from a hero 
in doing so.</P>
<P>The rest of the film tracks these adventures of the medical student that 
dares. Patch encounters everyone from a love interest to a pancreatic 
cancer patient to a friend that seems to be little more than the 
stereotypical medical student. The story is clearly the force behind 
this incredible film. Based on the autobiographic book, Gesundheit! : 
Bringing Good Health to You, the Medical System, and Society Through 
Physician Service, Complementary Therapies, Humor, and Joy by Hunter 
Doherty Adams, the films goes on to explore many darker and harsher 
realities. This is far from a hero-always-does-well type story, and no 
part of this incredible film seems to be too much like Hollywood, always 
maintaining a real world aspect to it.</P>
<P>Robin William is OscarAE worthy as Patch Adams. He gives what is most =
certainly the best performance of the year by anyone. Despite much 
resemblance to his previous film, Awakenings, he has created a new and 
original character here. He also seems to have proven once again that 
his talent reaches so far from comedy alone, that he truly can do 
anything. But the talent doesn't stop there. Hollywood newcomer Philip 
Seymour Hoffman (Bullworth, Happiness) and Monica Potter also give award 
worthy performances as the roommate and love interest respectively.</P>
<P>Director Tom Shadyac has truly created a film that is an all around 
masterpiece. Parts are visually stunning, others are tragically 
dramatic, and some just a pleasure to watch, but none are anything less 
than extraordinary. Although it is Williams' performance that will be 
remembered, this film goes so far beyond one man's talents, not matter 
how perfect that man.</P>
<P>To not see Patch Adams would be to deny yourself one of the great 
privileges of the film industry. It is an incredible achievement worthy 
of the highest praise possible. So, do yourself a favor and don't miss 
this one, it's worth every penny of the $7.50.</P>
