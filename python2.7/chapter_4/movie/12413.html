<PRE>BLACK DOG
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>It's been quite a while since there was a good trucking movie, and the
streak doesn't change with Black Dog.</P>
<P>Jack Crews (Patrick Swayze) is an ex-con trying to make ends meet.
Imprisoned several years earlier for involuntary manslaughter, he has
lost his livelihood: his trucking license.  Now he relies on a lowly
mechanic's job to provide for his wife (Brenda Strong) and daughter.</P>
<P>That is, until his boss (Graham Beckel), offers him an illegal trucking
run up the east coast which will solve all his financial problems.
Reluctantly, Jack agrees, and soon he's on the road with three
suspicious characters:  Earl (Randy Travis), Sonny (Gabriel Casseus) and
Wes (Brian Vincent).</P>
<P>His trucking run is far from easy.  He's dogged at every turn by a pair
of federal agents (Charles S. Dutton and Stephen Tobolowsky), and a
group of inept hijackers who are trying to seize his cargo. And with
each mile Jack gets closer to home, the stakes grow higher and higher.</P>
<P>The film itself is named for a trucker's superstition.  Just when
everything is going good...if you push yourself too far, a black dog
will appear and take everything away from you.  However, it also happens
to be an unfortunately apt title to place on this dog of a movie.</P>
<P>For the record, there are a couple of good truck stunts in the film, but
not nearly enough to make this worth watching.  Most of the film is
packed with "character defining" moments which serve little purpose
except to make the dismal characters more annoying than they previously
were.</P>
<P>The movie actually doesn't sink to its lowest depths until the finale.
Just when you think the movie can't get any more contrived, it continues
to surprise you.</P>
<P>Patrick Swayze tackles the everyman-trucker role with gusto, but this
material is beneath him.  Of the rest of the cast, only Gabriel Casseus
creates a somewhat likable character.  Dutton and Tobolowsky never fall
into the easy repartee which their comic-relief roles require.  The
additions of Randy Travis and Meat Loaf (as Jack's Atlanta connection,
Red) seem like pure stunt casting.</P>
<P>There may be worse films out there, but that's little consolation.  Your
time would be better spent watching The World's Deadliest Truck Chases
on television.</P>
