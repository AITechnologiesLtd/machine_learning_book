<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 and a half stars</P>
<P>Critics everywhere have compared Disney Pixar's A Bug's Life to
Dreamworks' Antz.  Don't expect me to be any different; it is virtually
impossible not to compare these two pretty special films.  As I was
wracking my brain trying to figure out why I liked Antz more than this,
it suddenly hit me: Antz deals with its themes in more of a theoretical
sense, whilst A Bug's Life is very practical.  For example, in Antz, the
enemy was depicted as the colony itself - their inability to think for
themselves.  But in this film, the enemy is in the very practical form
of ruthless grasshoppers.</P>
<P>It is rare for Disney films to have a good amount of depth and meaning
(The Hunchback of Notre Damne is the only in recent memory), but A Bug's
Life - a potentially brilliant film - is just a little too thin an
experience.  But without being hyper critical, this is a very good and
solid film, which will no doubt score big with the Christmas box office.</P>
<P>The dangerous Hopper (voice of Kevin Spacey) and his ruthless band of
grasshoppers threaten to wipe out a colony of ants, which is led by the
ant queen (Phyllis Diller) and Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus).
Flik (Dave Foley, of TV's NewsRadio) is an ant whose experimental views
on technology get him in deep trouble, but he rises to the challenge of
saving the colony by enlisting the help of "warrior bugs."
Unfortunately, he mistakes circus-performing insects for warriors, and
disaster brews as Hopper's threats become closer to reality.</P>
<P>One of the foremost reasons to see A Bug's Life is its clever jokes,
some of them parodies of our modern world.  When a fallen leaf
interrupts a group of ants collecting food, one ant screams "I'm lost!
Where's the line?"  Rescue workers quickly arrive at the scene.  "This
is nothing compared to the twig of '93!"</P>
<P>Many other gags, courtesy of script writers Andrew Stanton, Donald
McEnery and Bob Shaw, evolve around the crazy personalities of the
circus performers.  A repressed stick insect, a male ladybug and a
chubby caterpillar (who is eager to transform into a "beautiful
butterfly") are among the delightful characters delivering the jokes.</P>
<P>Kevin Spacey plays Hopper with a wickedly placid presence.  His voice is
controlled but his anger is fierce, a little reminiscent of his role as
a serial killer in Se7en.   Spacey is the best part of A Bug's Life, as
this superb actor proves that not being seen doesn't remove any power
from his performances.  Dave Foley plays a similar role to his part in
NewsRadio; acting as the sane center - the instigator that all the other
characters can react around.  David Hyde Pierce's voice is instantly
recognizable from the hit sitcom Frasier, and is a welcomed presence who
delivers his trademark personality of intelligence amongst confusion.
Almost everyone else seems uniformly average, ranging from the lifeless
Julia Louis-Dreyfus to the over the top Madeline Kahn (playing the
caterpillar).</P>
<P>A Bug's Life may have had it a little easy from critics.  Its plot is
lightweight, but it is not hard to be sucked into the films illustrious
computer animation.  These visuals are often a delight, although I was
surprised to find that they are significantly less detailed than those
in Antz (especially when we get a peek at the world beneath the ground).
A Bug's Life also looks much more spherical, with a smooth and shiny
design.</P>
<P>Definitely the best moments of A Bug's Life are near its end, in the
final battle between Flick and Hopper, and the delightful roll of film
through the credits (when an original gag is staged, which gives us an
insight into the film's real actors).  Whether you prefer these types of
films as theoretical or practical, sophisticated or slim, Antz and A
Bug's Life are both terrifically entertaining.  Now it's just a case of
whether or not Disney can provide depth and meaning in the same package.</P>
