Starring Loren Dean, Hope Davis
Directed by Lawrence Kasdan
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>There are many different types of Hollywood productions. Some are loud and
noisy, filling the screen with images of violence and heroes saving big
breasted women. Others show comedies that have to do mainly with all of the
character's (possibly) budding sexuality and how it's related with the real
world. These are simply the type of movies that studios like to make. So when a
modest film like Mumford comes around, it should be a great oppurtunity to
spread the word about a quiet, no flashly effects, funny, Hollywood film.</P>
<P>A psychiatrist named Mumford (Dean) moves to a town called Mumford where he is
instantly greeted with plenty of patients with lots of interesting problems. He
enjoys listening to people and hearing what they have to say. Now it just so
happens (like in most movies) that the people in this small town are very
eccentric and very strange. Mumford is called on various outings to try and
help people all of the little city. But the two resident doctors of the town
begin not to take a liking of him and think it's interesting that everyone who
could confirm his graduation from school have tragically died.</P>
<P>Then he meets Sofie (Davis, playing somewhat of an extension of her character
in Next Stop, Wonderland) in one second, he instantly falls in love. Now
falling in love with a patient is a bad thing, especially if her mother is a
bitchy Jane Adams, but there is another twist. It turns out Mumford isn't even
a psychiatrist at all. He just thought it would be a good way to get away from
his former life. I won't give you the full story, but basically he used to be
on drugs and was sent to a rehab center run by monks. When they think that he
has magically disappeared they run a segment looking for him on Unsolved
Mysteries. So what should he do? Face what he has done? Or go into hiding once
again?</P>
<P>And so Hollywood once again regains my trust that they can produce a quality
feature film. Mumford is very modest, very quiet, and nothing really seems to
happen but I still found myself enjoying it immensely. The ensemble cast (Ted
Danson, Jane Adams, Jason Lee, Alfre Woodard, and others) are great. Especially
Ted Danson whose six minute scene has him as a cigar smoking jerk whose
concerned about his wife. Dean has an interesting smile, which could possibly
become a trademark if he becomes a big star. Of course I have to congratulate
Hope Davis, has she ever been bad in a movie? While not outstandingly great,
Mumford is fun, and it gets *** stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: Three views of breasts and naked female androids, plus medium
language make up the film's bad content. Good Age 13 & Up</P>
