<PRE>                               MONEY TRAIN
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     In the New York City subways, and probably at other subway systems
as well, there is a special train that comes by each station every
night to pick up the day's fare that has been collected. There are
about a half dozen guards who accompany each train allowing Donald
Patterson (Robert Blake), the very tough chief of Metropolitan Transit,
to boast that never, but never, has one of his trains been robbed.
Blake, best known for the TV show where he starred as Baretta, has not
been in a film in about ten years.  That is a pity because he is in a
class by himself.  No one would ever mistake him for some other actor.</P>
<P>     Back to the story:  There are two brothers who, despite an unusual
situation, would die to protect the other.  When Charlie (Woody
Harrelson), who is white, escaped from an orphan asylum when he was
very young, he was taken in by John's (Wesley Snipes) family who is
black.  Charlie has always been on the wild side and foster brother
John has been kept busy keeping Charlie from getting into deep
trouble.   The two bicker but they love each other as siblings should.
It is that relationship that gives the film a real boost.</P>
<P>     Now grown up, they are transit police who work for a division of
Patterson's subway security.  Their job, however, involves much acting,
pretending to be drunk or asleep in the subway while the other watches
to see what petty thief will attempt to prey on the seemingly
defenseless . Their apprehending of criminals in the subway trains and
at subway stations is what keeps whatever safety there is.</P>
<P>     When Charlie runs up a $15,000 gambling debt that he will
obviously never be able to repay, his life is in danger.  A way out
occurs to him; what if he and John were to make off with some of the
money bags being transported by the Money Train?   Despite John's
strenuous objections, ("We are cops!  We don't steal!") Charlie decides
to take a crack at doing it himself.</P>
<P>     Up until then, MONEY TRAIN is very funny, with snappy, witty
dialogue (written by Doug Richardson and David Loughery from a story by
Richardson).  Add some love interest by the beautiful Grace Santiago
(Jennifer Lopez) who is a new recruit, and you have a very entertaining
film.</P>
<P>     So what went wrong?   A couple of things: the runaway subway train
scene seems to go on forever; too much of a good thing.  In addition,
like so many movies, the writers do not know how to end it.   MONEY
TRAIN, unfortunately, falls into that category.  The ending has much to
be desired, especially from a moral standpoint.</P>
