<P>"Out of Sight" - Clooney Robs Banks, Steals the Show </P>
<P>Who said that the bad guys were the ones that always ran from the law?
If you find the rare opportunity to talk to a person like Jack Foley
(George Clooney), you'll find out that he's intelligent, personable and
loves the movies.  He has admirable principles, possesses an understated
charm, and is a likable guy.  Never mind the fact that he has been a
bank robber throughout his life, and never mind the fact that he has
just escaped from prison.</P>
<P>During his escape, Foley is forced to take hostage FBI agent Karen Sisco
(Jennifer Lopez).  However, Foley doesn't resort to threats and scare
tactics during this period of tension.  Rather, he is collected and
begins to engage in a conversation about his ex-wife, friends and his
love of movies.  Though she is scared, there's a sort of comfort that
she gets from his voice.  A strange but believable attraction begins to
take shape.  "What if we met under different circumstances," he muses.
Yet despite their developing bond for one another, Sisco knows that she
ultimately must arrest the escaped convict.  Meanwhile, Foley has his
own agenda, which leads him and his friend Buddy (Ving Rhames) to
Detroit where a former inmate now lives.  This inmate (Albert Brooks)
once ill-advisedly bragged how he kept $5 million in diamonds at his
place.  For Foley, this could be his big break.  If he can successfully
pull off the robbery, allude the tenacious Agent Sisco, and also stay
ahead of a rival gang of former inmates who also know of the diamonds,
he can retire and escape to some far away island.</P>
<P>"Out of Sight" incorporates much of the skewed humor, sharp dialogue and
absurdly violent situations seen in "Jackie Brown" and "Get Shorty" (in
fact, all these movies are adapted from work by Author Elmore Leonard).
This is the kind of film where we become more interested in what a
character thinks and not what he does.  Clooney does a terrific job as a
man who is constantly looking for ways to maneuver through various
obstacles in order to reach his goal, whether its finding a way to meet
Sisco or finding the stash of diamonds.  Lopez is also very good and
projects the right look of a woman who wants to make the arrest while
teasing with the idea of first having an affair with him.  Together,
they have chemistry and a smoldering sexuality.  Meanwhile, they are
surrounded by a colorful and rich cast of supporting characters, and
each of them gets ample opportunities to show us how unique, strange,
and odd their crime world is.</P>
<P>The film makes me wonder how interesting it must be to be a part of this
kind of world, as fragile and hostile as it may be.  The film's greatest
pleasure comes from it's dialogue.  Add a funky electronic piano and
bluesy guitar score, and you have a film that looks good, sounds good
and feels hip.</P>
