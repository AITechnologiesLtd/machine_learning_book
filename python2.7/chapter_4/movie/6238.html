<P>    To the credit of Spike Lee and screenwriter Reggie Rock Bythewood,
GET ON THE BUS *did* get me thinking.  I thought about the fifteen men
bound for the Million Man March and wondered how many of them were
representations of Mr. Lee.  (The film student is an obvious choice, but
do we see a side of Spike in the macho actor played by Andre Braugher?
Or, maybe, in the mulatto police officer portrayed by Roger Guenveur
Smith?) I thought about Ossie Davis and wondered how many times I'd seen
him playing the wise old man.  (Remember how good he was with Burt
Reynolds on that TV show, some years back?) I thought about all the
weighty issues riding on that bus and wondered if any of these preachers
would stop sermonizing long enough to simply "be." (The one passenger
who stays silent is a Nation of Islam attendee and what does that tell
you?)</P>
<P>    I thought about the great state of Tennessee and wondered if a bevy
of black men would find hospitality in a Memphis redneck bar.  (I bought
the State Police stopping them on suspicion of drug traffic, though.)
Mostly, I thought about Albert Einstein and wondered how he would
explain the stretching of time inside of a movie theater.  (The film
runs two hours and feels like three.  Wait, I remember an exciting
exchange!  Yes, somewhere in the second hour, when an auto dealer gets
on da bus and begins offering some choice opinions about affirmative
action.)</P>
<P>    GET ON THE BUS is clearly the best movie that Spike Lee has made in
a while, or, at least, since before CLOCKERS and GIRL 6.  (When was the
last *funny* Spike Lee movie?  CROOKLYN in '94?  JUNGLE FEVER in '91?)
Those reading their eyelids may beg to differ, but Lee has very nearly
succeeded with this rolling sermon that, like the Million Man March
itself, pushes the promotion of unity among African-American males.
Leave it to Lee to bring nobility to the multiplex.  Now, if only he'd
though to put Sandra Bullock behind the wheel of that rig...  Pop quiz,
Hotshot:  you've got a movie about a bus, loaded with black male
stereotypes and rigged to make the viewer fall asleep no matter how fast
it goes.  What do you do? </P>
