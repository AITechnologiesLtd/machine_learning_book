<P>        They say royalty doesn't exist in the United States, but "The American
President" proves it does. This is a really enjoyable film that wonders what
would happen if the president was single. And the answer is a funny,
romantic, and sentimental story that really touches your heart and makes you
feel good for many reasons.
        Michael Douglas stars as President Andrew Sheperd, a democrat who was
elected as a widower. A lot of good characterization is portrayed by
Douglas's character due mostly to the fact he is the president but also a
single father. We see the relationship between him and his daughter who is a
nice and caring girl who loves her dad and understands his job.When he meets
a woman, she is not jealous, she is very supportive and tries to give him
hints on how to impress her. This is just one example of the film's charming
creativity.
        Annette Bening co-stars as Sydney Ellen Wade, a single, 30-something woman
who is one of the top executives of an environmental lobbying group. When she
visits the White House she tells the President's aides his environmental
policy "sucks" and bashes him, not knowing he was standing behind her the
entire time. That's a typical joke-making device, but nevertheless, it works
really well here and thus our two main characters finally meet. 
        One of the best scenes takes place soon thereafter, as Sheperd and his
friend, Chief-of-Staff A.J. MacInerey (Sheen), are playing pool and discuss
whether or not they think Sydney likes him. It sounds like something kids in
high school would say. Sheperd: "She didn't say anything about me?"
MacInerey: "Well, I'll pass her a note in study hall."
        The president gets Sydney's phone number and calls her, at first she thinks
it's a prank call, but finally realizes it is him and he asks her out. Sydney
and her sister act like real people and not movie characters - they discuss
what to wear and all the little idiosyncrasies of dating and whether or not
he's cute. It's everyday girl talk, the guy just happens to be the president.
        The chemistry between Douglas and Bening is excellent, and they make one of
the cutest couples. The original screenplay drives this film, but Reiner's
direction and the acting make it even better.
        Both Sheperd and Sydney are trying to get bills passed, and they make a
"deal" to help each other out. Most of the movie is spent showing the
relationship between the two and their independent efforts to pass their
bills. What it all comes down to is the fact the president's relationship is
affecting his status and if he passes the crime bill without passing the
environmental bill first he will regain some of his popularity but will also
cross Sydney. Which is more important - his job or his love life? It's a tough
 decision and he ultimately makes the right one for him, but he can't forgive
himself.
        I really liked this film. It was creative, witty, funny, and romantic. It
shows no matter how high up on a pedestal we put people, they are still human
and still have the same problems as everyone else. (3/10/96) (2/11/97)
