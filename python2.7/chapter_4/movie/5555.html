<P>     "It's not SHOWGIRLS" one trailer for STRIPTEASE bluntly announces,
capping off a marketing campaign which may be the first in recent memory
to attempt to convince the movie-going public that a new film is _nothing_
like a previous film.  Sure, it works the other way all the time, thanks
to pre-fabricated critical blurbs like "This year's FORREST GUMP" or
reminders of the director's previous successes, but the stink of SHOWGIRLS
is such that it threatens to contaminate anything featuring a pelvis and a
pole.  Of course, if you remembered that writer-director Andrew Bergman is
behind such comedic gems as THE IN-LAWS, THE FRESHMAN and HONEYMOON IN
VEGAS, you'd know not to expect SHOWGIRLS.  The real question is whether
you'd expect STRIPTEASE, a film as inconsistent in its tone as it is
occasionally hilarious.</P>
<P>     Demi Moore stars as Erin Grant, a Miami woman forced to extreme
measures when her pill-popping, police-informant ex-husband Darrell
(Robert Patrick) is granted custody of their 7-year-old daughter Angie
(Rumer Willis, Moore's real-life daughter).  To earn the necessary money
for the appeal, Erin takes a job dancing at the Eager Beaver, a topless
bar which counts Congressman Davey Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) among its
regulars.  One night, Dilbeck is caught on film assaulting another patron
at the bar, a fact which deeply concerns Dilbeck's staff and corporate
supporters.  When the photographer and another man turn up dead, homicide
detective Lt. Garcia (Armand Assante) begins an investigation which draws
Erin and her daughter into a nasty mess of sleazy politics.</P>
<P>     Moore received the surprising sum of $12.5 million to bump-and-grind
her way through STRIPTEASE, and at the very least the producers should
take solace in the fact that she picked up dancing a heck of a lot faster
than she has picked up this whole acting thing.  There is something both
smug and overly earnest about Moore's standard screen pose, as though she
never wanted there to be any doubt that she felt deeply about whatever her
predicament might be, but also that nothing could stop her if she set her
mind to it.  In STRIPTEASE, that is a major problem.  This is supposed to
be a frisky comedy, but Moore's deadly serious performance acts like ankle
weights on a swimmer.  There are scenes between her and Armand Assante
which seem to come from a second-rate TV-movie -- "Baring Her Soul: The
Erin Grant Story."</P>
<P>     That's a real shame, because there are plenty of moments in
STRIPTEASE where Bergman's wonderfully weird sense of humor gets to shine
through.  Ving Rhames has a great role as the Eager Beaver's put-upon
bouncer Shad, a man looking for the get-rich-quick scheme which will allow
him to get out of the bouncer business; he gets one of STRIPTEASE's best
moments as he impresses a couple of thugs with tales of his
responsibilities "auditioning" topless dancers.  Burt Reynolds is
completely over the top as Dilbeck, a pathetic, fetishistic drunkard who
coats himself in Vaseline and sniffs Erin's dryer lint before addressing a
Young Christians' conference, and there is something improbably enjoyable
about the way Reynolds doesn't even pretend to modulate his performance.
Bergman makes fine use of oddball supporting characters, and seasons
STRIPTEASE liberally with his trademark unpredictability, like a priceless
scene during the film's climax involving Erin's daughter, two well-endowed
dancers and a jump-rope.</P>
<P>     There are plenty of laughs in STRIPTEASE, enough to make it
moderately entertaining, but the reason STRIPTEASE isn't a better movie is
that they're the wrong _kind_ of laughs for the material.  Based on Carl
Hiaasen's novel, the story demands a darker edge in its political satire,
a sense of irony that the topless dancer is one of the few characters in
the film with any morals.  That simply isn't Andrew Bergman's style; his
comedy may be wild, but it's always good-natured.  When Burt Reynolds'
Congressman is as absurd a character as the general played by Richard
Libertini in THE IN-LAWS, it's tough to extract any biting commentary.
The result is a film which is moving in several different directions at
once:  the source material is trying to make it dark, Bergman is trying to
make it silly, and Moore is trying to make it serious.  When it's silly,
STRIPTEASE is super, but a lot of the time it's not clear _what_
STRIPTEASE is.  Except, of course, that it's _not_ SHOWGIRLS.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Demi-clad women:  6.</PRE>
