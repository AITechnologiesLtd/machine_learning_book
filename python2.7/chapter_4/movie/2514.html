<P>     THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS is a huge, sprawling train-wreck of a
drama that requires some serious suspension of disbelief to take
seriously.  The problem here is casting and if you can accept Jeremy
Irons as a South American and Meryl Streep as a psychic and Winona
Ryder as a mother, then you're halfway on your way to "enjoying" Bille
August's adaption of Isabell Allende's acclaimed 1985 novel.</P>
<P>     THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS opens in a rather Chile South American
country in 1926 and introduces Esteban Trueba (Irons).  He's a young
miner who plans to prosper and, later, marry the daughter of a
prominent aristocrat (Mueller-Stahl).  But by the time he strikes gold,
the daughter is dead--an event foreseen by her psychic little sister
Clara.  Esteban rides off into the hills and Clara, shocked by her
ability to foresee fatality, turns mute.</P>
<PRE>     (Oh no! Not another mute heroine! :-))</PRE>
<P>     Twenty years pass and Esteban has become a powerful (and quite
cruel) rancher.  When he returns to town to mourn his mother, he spies
the now-grown and now-gorgeous Clara (Streep) at the funeral.  He
proposes, she speaks, the furniture levitates on their honeymoon and,
at the moment of her impregnation, Clara jumps up and declares "it will
be a girl."  Said girl grows up looking like Winona Ryder and takes a
lover (Banderas) who is a revolutionary and causes her father all sorts
of grief because, by that time, Dad is a senior member of the
conservative government.</P>
<PRE>     Soapy?  Yes.  Super?  No.  THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS is a long-sit,
no matter how high you can rise off your seat.</PRE>
<P>     The initial problem is pacing and SPIRITS doesn't flow worth a
damn.  The director's eye is good--there's no shortage of arresting
images here--but his timing is awful.  Much of the first half of the
film is comprised of truncated scenes--powerful, inspiring incidents
that are compressed into moments so momentary that they barely stay on
the screen long enough to register.</P>
<P>     (The first eighty minutes could be highlights from *another* film,
for all we know!)</P>
<P>     SPIRITS slows in the second half, thank God, and spends *some*
quality time with the story.  But even a lively coup d'etat--complete
with Winona Ryder undergoing torture--is no help to the viewer, who
has been stuck in a twilight zone where the chracters age at different
rates.</P>
<P>     Watching THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS is like watching a high-school
production where all of your best friends are playing people of older
ages.  Except, instead of kids playing adults, it's adults playing
kids.  Come on, Jeremy Irons in his twenties?  You can't tell the age
of *any* major character without doing some serious in-your-head
arithmetic.  And that's no fun.</P>
<P>     Age, innocence, or otherwise, the "international" cast is a bust.</P>
<P>     The less-than-ethnic-looking Irons puts a wealth of effort into
his role of Esteban even though he's saddled with a goofy accent and,
what looks suspiciously like, Dustin Hoffman's fake teeth from HOOK.
Streep is graceful and serenely strong and has her hilarious moment
when filmed asleep in her bed with her hair, arms, and cheekbones
perfectly poised.</P>
<P>     Vanessa Redgrave and Armin Mueller-Stahl are all but wasted as
Clara's parents.  So are Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas--though
listed in the credits, they do little more than stand around and look
sincere.  By default, the standout is Glenn Close as Esteban's spinster
sister.  She stares and glares and never wears anything but black.  But
she *does* walk away with most of the film's funny lines.</P>
<P>     In fact, THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS is filled with more
*un*intentional humor than otherwise.  Stop, look, and listen for such
laughable laurels as Ryder's drab narration, inexplicably awful
dubbing, and a vintage automobile that collides with a train and
explodes like something from a Mel Gibson movie.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:       THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS is a huge, sprawling,
                   epic-wannabe that takes more effort to watch than to
                   enjoy.  You'll laugh, you'll sleep.</PRE>
