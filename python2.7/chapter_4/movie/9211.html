<P>Sometimes, knowing the unpleasant and unfortunate outcome of a story,
before it unfolds, will destroy ones appreciation of the movie itself.
Yes, I watched a documentary on Eva Peron, before I watched the
musical "Evita." What shocked me about the documentary was the abuse
that the mummified body of Eva Peron suffered at the hands of the
anti-Peronists. I won't go into gory details but here's the low down.
After the fall of the Peron government, Eva has some of her fingers and
part of her ear cut off for an identification process. She is stored
away in a plain wooden coffin, at a secret location for fear that her
dead body will spark a revolution. Somehow, her body and coffin end up
in a shady general's office, where it is rumoured that the general
committed acts of necrophilia. After another change of government, her
body is sent to France and buried under a false name for a number of
years. The winds of change blows frequently in Argentina, before another
change of government finally allows the return of Eva's body to her
family. She now lies buried beneath fifteen feet of marble.</P>
<P>If this sad finale, doesn't wreck one's appreciation of Evita, I'm not
sure what will. On a brighter note, I was impressed with the lyrical
style of the movie, which is mostly photogenic images of Madonna,
Antonio and Jonathan set to song. It is a long sit with no dialogue, but
the patient will eventually end up appreciating the music of Andrew
Lloyd Webber. The most moving moment is when the title song "Evita" is
sung. Although Madonna does not have the voice to perform the song to
it's full impact, she manages to hold her notes. In fact watching
Madonna's solid performance as Eva Peron, was perhaps this movie's
greatest surprise. I'm quite shocked that I am actually complimenting
the likes of this pop diva. Maybe it's because she is only allowed to
sing and not speak, which makes her believable as Peron. It's like the
Holly Hunter paradox in "The Piano", where she acts better when she
isn't given any dialogue. Antonio Banderas is ever reliable as the song
and tune narrator who appears at every scene to give the viewers some
perspective on where they are on the Perone timeline. Jonathon Pryce a
talented character actor, fills the shoes of Juan Peron with ease.</P>
<P>So if it wasn't for the fact that I had seen the documentary before the
film, I would have appreciated "Evita" more. Cause every time I saw
Eva on screen, I couldn't help but want to barf at knowing what would
happen to the poor women after she died. Here I go again, where's the
bathroom?</P>
