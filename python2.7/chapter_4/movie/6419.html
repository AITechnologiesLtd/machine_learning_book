<PRE>                      ARMOUR OF GOD II: OPERATION CONDOR (1990)
                       A film review by Christopher E. Meadows
                        Copyright 1996 Christopher E. Meadows</PRE>
<P>(1990; American release 1997; written and directed by Jackie Chan,
produced by Leonard Ho)</P>
<PRE>My Rating: 8/10 (**** of *****)</PRE>
<P>Jackie Chan's "Armour of God II: Operation Condor" is scheduled to hit
American theaters sometime early next year (with the "Armour of God
II:" part of the title removed so as not to confuse the American
audience).  In an effort to make a pre-emptive strike on
rec.arts.movies.reviews well ahead of the crowd, I went out and rented
it from a local specialty film rental shop [any specialty film buffs
in or near Columbia, MO who don't know about it already, email me!] to
see what I thought.</P>
<P>The version I rented was dubbed, using actors whose voices I
recognized from Streamline Pictures's anime releases.  It was actually
a pretty good dub, compared to some I've seen, but it will almost
certainly be redone for American release, likely with Jackie Chan
doing his own voice.</P>
<P>Dub quality aside, this is what I have to say about the film.</P>
<P>It will be interesting to see how "Operation Condor" goes over in
America.  The two prior Jackie Chan films to see American mass-market
cinematic release (both directed by Stanley Tong), "Rumble in the
Bronx" and "(Police Story III:) Supercop," mostly follow the
traditional Western action-movie formula--relatively tight plotting, a
straight and serious story, lots of action.</P>
<P>"Operation Condor", on the other hand, typifies the traditional
Hong Kong movie style--more laid back, with abrupt and sometimes
bewildering mood swings--fairly serious one moment; complete goofball,
often slapstick humor the next moment.  It's directed by Jackie Chan
himself; this is the style of movie he likes to make.  But is it the
style of movie that American audiences will like?</P>
<P>In "Operation Condor", Jackie Chan reprises his "Armour of God"
role as "Jackie," a gadgeteering fortune hunter who is kind of a cross
between Indiana Jones and James Bond.  Shortly after a narrow escape
from a savage tribe, Jackie returns to civilization to find himself
asked to assist the hunt for hidden Nazi gold, buried in a secret base
in northern Africa at the end of World War II.</P>
<P>However, this expedition is not going to be easy.  Along the way,
Jackie has to contend with the three inept women who comprise the rest
of his party, and at least two different groups who both want to get
their hands on that gold.</P>
<P>The word that best describes "Operation Condor" is "zany".  Here
are some of the most oddball chase scenes and fight sequences ever
filmed, including a car chase where Jackie just can't seem to stay on
his motorcycle, and hand-to-hand combat in a wind tunnel blowing at
full force.  Jackie fans won't be disappointed; the fight scenes are
some of the best since the original Police Story.  It remains to be
seen whether American audiences will enjoy the odd mix of humor and
action, or else just not "get it".</P>
<P>In a way, both "Armour of God" movies contain some not-so-subtle
homages to the James Bond films, from the pre-theme opening gambits to
the gadget-laden vehicles and devices Jackie uses, and Jackie's
character also borrows from the Indiana Jones films.  One of the later
scenes is drawn almost directly from "Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade".</P>
<P>All in all, I'm not surprised that "Operation Condor" is acclaimed
by Chan fans as one of his all-time greatest films.  I just wonder
whether American mass-market audiences will agree.</P>
