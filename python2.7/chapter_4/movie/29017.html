<PRE>DREAM FOR AN INSOMNIAC (1998)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
August 1st, 2001</PRE>
<P>Roman Polanski once said that the best love stories are the tragic ones. I am
inclined to agree. I also think ambiguous endings in love stories work, as is
the case with Mike Nichols' fabulous "The Graduate." Then there are the forced
happy endings, notably the finale of "Pretty Woman." "Dream for an Insomniac" is
your standard, cookie-cutter formula crap where the happy ending is not only
forced but also downright shameful. </P>
<P>The insomniac is Frankie (Ione Skye), an aspiring actress who has not had a
decent night of sleep since she was six-years old. Since this story is meant to
be a modern-day fairy-tale, I'll forgive that implausibility for the moment.
Frankie lives above a coffee shop run by her Italian uncle (Seymour Cassel), who
keeps Frank Sinatra pictures on the walls and constantly plays Old Blue Eyes'
music. Frankie is convinced that once she leaves for L.A. with her best friend,
Allison (Jennifer Aniston), she will find her dreamboat, someone with "the soul
of a poet and eyes like Frank Sinatra." That is until a new employee of the
coffee shop comes around named David (Mackenzie Astin), a wannabe writer with
the blue eyes of Sinatra. He also happens to be full of quotations from
Shakespeare and Sartre to pop-culture references. Frankie is instantly in love
but how can she leave for L.A. in four days since she met her dreamboat? </P>
<P>I've never been in love but if I were, I would not fall so hard for someone like
Frankie. Her character is shown to be a pessimist, overtly cynical and smug so
how can she also be so optimistic about finding the right kind of man? And what
kind of man is that supposed to be? One who can quote endlessly from different
literary sources? The scene of Frankie and David's first meeting smacks of
sentimental implausibilites. I am not sure if I would be crazy about someone who
feels that if you can quote from the literary gods and can keep up with her
stream of quotes, then you are worthy. The whole scene as directed by Tiffanie
Debartolo is forced, romantic hogwash, as is most of the movie. The shift from
black and white to color only enhances the lack of credibility.</P>
<P>There are revelations that can be seen coming from miles ahead of the cinema
meter. Frankie's male cousin, Rob (Michael Landes) is homosexual but his father
does not know it - their inevitable scene where Rob has to confess his nature is
predictable. Then there is David's little secret, also foreseeable. And there is
the stereotypical Generation X-er who can drink and eat anything he wants for
free. And so on. </P>
<P>The one comic surprise that often took me out of my dull stupor is Jennifer
Aniston. She plays the best friend, which is a considerable waste of her talents
since she does the exact same role on her famous sitcom. Anytime Aniston showed
up on screen, I was elated. Aniston is funny, engaging, sprightly - a real
fireball that enlivens the proceedings and makes us wish her role had more
development. If Frankie had been played by Aniston, I might have had more fun
watching the film. </P>
<P>"Dream for an Insomniac" is fabricated, dull, formulaic, unsurprising, dishonest
nonsense. Dishonest in that it wants to reinforce the belief that love at first
sight still exists, even for two charismatic people who have no business being
together. Watching Cassevettes regular Cassel spouting cliche-ridden dialogue is
enough cause for a Cassevettes retrospective. And if you happen to be an
insomniac, then this film will prove to be a dream come true. </P>
