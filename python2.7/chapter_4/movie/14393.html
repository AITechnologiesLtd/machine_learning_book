<PRE>Simon Birch

<P>Movies cheat, everyone knows that.  There's a whole industry dedicated
to special effects, the smoke and mirrors filmmakers need to create
whatever illusions they need to tell their story.  However, we've gotten
so used to looking at the visual effects that sometimes we forget the
other tricks of the Hollywood trade.  Simon Birch has no visual
gimmickry to speak of.  The only special effect used is not a model or a
CGI bluescreen computerized image but an idea -- the idea of destiny.
Unlike giant cruise ships or frothing tyrannosaurs, destiny is cheap.
All you have to do is write the script so that you tip the audience off
to what's going to happen.  It's called foreshadowing -- and if
foreshadowing were eyeshadowing, Simon Birch would look like Tammy Faye
Bakker.</P>
<P>The movie starts off in a graveyard, (in a town called Gravestown, no
less) with narrator Jim Carrey standing over the graves of his mother
(Ashley Judd) and his childhood friend Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith).
You would think that would be enough to inform us of the fate of the
characters, wouldn't you?  Well, you'd be wrong.  When the time comes
for the mother to die, it's set up by more earnest, serious narration
(yes, it's that Jim Carrey) and an agonizingly tedious slow motion shot
of the errant foul ball that hits her in the head and kills her.  In
fact, it's so slow that the dimmer members of the audience could be
heard to say, "Hey, that lady's gonna get hit in the head with that
baseball."</P>
<P>And if the clunky foreshadowing of the plot weren't enough, we are left
with the character of Simon Birch.  Simon is a tiny little boy, with
thick Coke-bottle glasses, hearing aids, and a whiny, annoying voice --
"like strangled mice", we're told.  He is the movie's chief
standard-bearer for the idea of destiny.  He tells everyone that he is
God's chosen instrument, and that God has destined him to be a hero.  He
is called on to make oracular pronouncements from time to time -- he
tells poor Oliver Platt that he doesn't think he has long to live, just
as if he's read the script.  Predictably, this attitude gets annoying.
In fact, I could start the next twelve sentences with the word
"predictably", because so much about the plot is predictable -- and
what's not given away in the storyline is given away by the narration or
the background music.</P>
<P>Having said that, it's still possible to make a good movie that's
predictable, just as it's possible to enjoy a trip to somewhere you've
been a thousand times.  Simon Birch ends up being a decent movie, even
if it can't overcome the limitations of its script. The heart of the
movie is the relationship between Simon and his best friend Joe (Joseph
Mazzello).  They're both very gifted actors who happen to be under
voting age.  When you think about it, it's a little odd.  You have
big-time Hollywood producers forking over millions of dollars to make a
movie and placing their trust in two kids who can't drive.  The best
thing about Simon Birch is that Smith and Mazzello prove that they're
worthy of such trust.</P>
<P>The first thing that I noticed about Smith was that he wasn't on the
movie poster.  The poster depicts a small baby being held out of a pool
of water by two disembodied hands.  Smith is about 3 feet tall, with
teeth jutting out at ninety-degree angles, and while he's no poster boy,
we're constantly reminded that he's "cute, like a little doll".  And he
is cute, the audience likes him, and that goodwill is enough to carry
him through some very odd moments -- such as when he stands up in church
and asks, "What do coffee and donuts have to do with God?"  Smith does a
superb job in a role that would be difficult for an actor of any age.
Mazzello's part isn't as showy -- he's basically a nice kid getting
picked on by life.  (It's sort of like a Wonder Years episode where Fred
Savage's mom dies.)  On the surface, there's not a lot of emotional
depth to his character -- but what there is, he brings out.  Mazzello
does himself proud in his first major leading role</P>
<P>In comparison, the adult parts are drab.  Ashley Judd is luminous as the
doomed mother, but she's not onscreen long enough to make any kind of
impression.  Oliver Platt is the designated Good Guy, and he's given
little to do other than be good.  Only David Strathairn makes any kind
of impression as the erring New England minister.</P>
<P>If life is, as Forrest Gump tells us, like a box of chocolates, Simon
Birch is a Hershey bar.  You know what you're going to get -- but it's
good and sweet and something of a guilty pleasure, and can be enjoyed
for what it is.</P>
