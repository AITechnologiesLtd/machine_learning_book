<PRE>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong

<P>Saving Private Ryan is a haunting and moving movie that will live in my
head for a long time to come. There are good movies that come around only
once in a long time and Saving Private Ryan is one of those. </P>
<P>I never write a review immediately after seeing a movie. I like to let the
movie sink in for a day or two before setting out to write the review.
After Saving Private Ryan, I'm sitting here two hours later writing the
review. The movie is so unsettling that I feel that writing this review
might help me come to grips with some of what happened during the film. </P>
<P>Saving Private Ryan opens with a 30-minute sequence of the Omaha Beach
D-Day invasion; this is a war sequence is so realistic and raw that I will
be remember it for a long time. I must warn you now, Saving Private Ryan
deserves its R-rating. This is not a movie for young children and if you
are squeamish, you might want to cover your eyes here. The opening sequence
is so extremely violent and realistic that it not only leaves you
breathless, but it leaves you unnerved and senseless. I have not seen
anything like this before and I doubt that I will see anything close
anytime soon. Spielberg shoots this opening sequence with such intensity
that I was left to wonder why all these unnecessary atrocities were committed.</P>
<P>What we find out is that three brothers from the Ryan house were killed
during the war, and all three telegrams are being delivered to the mother
on the same day. However, there is a fourth still in the war. A group of
eight soldiers led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is sent out into the
middle of the war to find Private James F. Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him
home to his family. The journey is long and hard, and about halfway through
the film I was already reeling.</P>
<P>Those of you who read my reviews know that I rarely cry at movies. And even
when I do cry, it usually comes at the end. Saving Private Ryan is the
first movie where I found myself crying halfway through. There are many war
movies, and many of them are about the Second World War. But, most all of
them are candy coated.</P>
<P>Spielberg takes the gloss out of the war; he strips the war down to its
most natural form, and he shoots this war from the point of view of a
soldier. Having done this, Spielberg has made less of a war movie and more
of an anti-war movie. Saving Private Ryan left me wondering why we fight wars.</P>
<P>Is there anything to criticize about Saving Private Ryan? No. In every
sense, this is a perfect movie. Spielberg, who pumped out some mediocre
stuff lately (Lost World, Amistad), comes back strong with Saving Private
Ryan. This movie will make my top ten list this year, and will likely be
the number one film on the list.</P>
<P>Things to note about Saving Private Ryan range from the score to the
acting. The score by the ever-talented John Williams is just as raw as the
film is. It takes our emotions and leads us in all the right directions,
all the while not being overly melodramatic or distracting.</P>
<P>The acting is top-notch, from the leads (Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore) to the
supporting cast (Matt Damon, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns, Adam Goldberg,
and Barry Pepper). Spielberg is able to get great performances out of
everyone onscreen. </P>
<P>Kudos to Robert Rodat for writing this powerful and moving movie. Kudos
also to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski for shooting this film in the way
that it is. The film is not a colorful film, nor is it bright. Kaminski
strips the colors out of the film leaving us with just enough colors to
live with, leaving us feeling slightly uncomfortable. Kaminski's work is
some of the best I've seen this year. Pay close attention to detail during
the first thirty minutes or so. That shows just how good Kaminski is.</P>
<P>Saving Private Ryan is one of the most shocking and memorable films of this
year - and of this decade. There is imagery from this film that I will
never forget and there are characters that will haunt my memory forever.
This is a motion picture that doesn't make war look like a glorious thing;
it shows war as it is, a stupid thing. Don't Miss Saving Private Ryan.</P>
