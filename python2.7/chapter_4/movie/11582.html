<PRE>PRIMARY COLORS</PRE>
<PRE>Dear Caroline --</PRE>
<P>        It almost seems appropriate that the much-anticipated
political flick "Primary Colors" is as two-faced as its main
character, Gov. Jack Stanton played by John Travolta.
        Based on the best-selling book by Newsweek editor Joe Klein,
aka Anonymous, "Primary Colors" follows the eerie parallels of the
Clinton 1992 Presidential campaign. Travolta really is a look-alike,
sound-alike to President Bill Clinton, right down to the home-spun
stories, jogging suits and appetite for women and food. In fact, where
ever Stanton is seen, there is something to eat. In the course of this
movie, Stanton has eaten barbequed ribs, fried chicken, donuts, apple
fritters and Chinese food.
        The first half of "Primary Colors" is a wonderful,
humor-filled political satire that rivals Tim Robbins' "Bob Roberts,"
one of the best movies of 1992 that nobody went to see. When Stanton
is accused of an unforgivable sex act, "Primary Colors" makes a wrong
turn near Albuquerque that takes the film in an unexpected direction
that it is not completely able to recover from. The first half may
follow closely to Clinton's first presidential campaign, but the
second half is quite fictional. "Primary Colors" uneasily turns from
comedic satire to moody drama. There is not a single laugh in the
film's second half.
         Frank Capra's classic "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" can pull
off the adjustment from satire to moody drama. Its ending, when Jimmy
Stewart's Smith nearly becomes a beaten man, is as dark as any other
Capra film. I know Jimmy Stewart (figuratively) and Travolta is no
Jimmy Stewart.
        It appears director Mike Nichols ("The Birdcage") and
screenwriter Elaine May wanted to have it both ways. The former
University of Chicago comedy partners try to cover all grounds with
subplots right out of TV's "Spin City" and final ethical tests similar
to what Spencer Tracy faced in Capra's "State of the Union."
        The satire in "Primary Colors" follows "Bob Roberts," a funny
semi-documentary, behind-the-scenes look at a Pennsylvania
businessman's run for senator. Jack Stanton and Bob Roberts could feel
right at home together as couch potatoes watching college football on
the tube.  Actually, they are both frauds. They know it. The voters
don't.
        When "Primary Colors" opens, Stanton is a Southern governor
from an unnamed state, who is trying to get known in New Hampshire,
site of the first presidential primary. Ivy-League trained political
advisor Henry Burton (British actor Adrian Lester) is reluctantly
brought in to assist. Emma Thompson plays Stanton's wife, Susan, while
Billy Bob Thornton is the skilled campaign manager and Kathy Bates
steals the show as troubleshooter Libby Holden.
        Need a scorecard to find the modern parallels?
        Travolta is Bill Clinton, Thompson is Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Lester is George Stephanopoulos, Thornton is James Carville and Bates
is advisor Betsy Wright. There is also a Gennifer Flowers look alike,
who publicizes her affair with Stanton -- Clinton -- through a popular
supermarket tabloid.
        Bates clearly steals the show in an Oscar-caliber supporting
performance as the hired gun brought in to fight off troubling news
about Stanton's philandering ways. Bates has mastered the style of the
tough-as-nails, cranky boss.
        One problem with May's script is that we never fully get to
know Stanton. Why is he running for president after all, and beyond an
adult literacy issue, what else does he stand for? I guess I shouldn't
feel so badly that I would rather vote for Kevin Kline's Dave rather
than a politician that seems more like the real thing.
        In 1993, documentary filmmakers D.A. Pennebaker and Chris
Hegedus released "The War Room," which filmed Clinton's Little Rock
campaign headquarters in '92. It's easy to see how Stanton's small
staff equalled Clinton's inner sanctum, though "The War Room" is set
only a few months after "Primary Colors."
        "Primary Colors" clocks in at a too-long 2 1/2
hours. Travolta, who seemingly dances in every one of his movies
("Saturday Night Fever," "Grease," "Perfect," "Pulp Fiction," and
"Michael") gives his worst dance performance of his career since
"Staying Alive."
        One trivial note: That's former "Dukes of Hazzard" tow truck
driver, Rep. Ben Jones, as one of Stanton's campaign advisors.
        Rating: Two-and-a-half stars</P>
