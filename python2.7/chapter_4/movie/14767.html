<PRE>               THE HOLE (Taiwan/French with subtitles)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: A science fiction allegory.  At the Millennium a lethal
contagious virus has hit Taiwan.  Officials have cut off water and
other services to the center of contagion.  Life there devolves and
degenerates.  A man in an apartment has a hole in his floor and with it
harasses his downstairs neighbor.  A slow but harrowing film to be
missed if possible.  Rating:  2 (0 to 10), low -1 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - The Taiwan Virus is ravaging Taiwan and the part of the city that
     is the center of the contagion has been evacuated of anyone who
     will go.  One apartment building still houses people.  A woman,
     formerly an office worker, (Yang Kuei-mei) is tormented by her
     upstairs neighbor (Lee Kang-sheng) who has a hole cut by a plumber
     in the floor and is using it as a drain.  Neighbor runs a small
     failing grocery store.
   - To make things more depressing, it is constantly raining hard.
   - Upstairs neighbor vomits through, pours water, etc.  A small and
     almost entirely one-sided war starts.  Allegory about callousness
     and selfishness.
   - Woman is living on a pile of rolls of toilet tissue.
   - Incongruous songs added to show downstairs neighbors dreams.
     These are the songs of popular Taiwanese singer Grace Chang.
   - Apartment is falling apart.  Wallpaper is separating from walls.
     Plumbing is failing.
   - Boredom shown by long cuts in which nothing happens.  A lot of
     film seems to be used up.
   - This story might have been done much better as a ten-minute
     animated film.
   - Stars are considered to be great dramatic actors by one reviewer.
   - This film seems longer at 95 minutes most two-hour films.</P>
