<PRE>`The Siege' - A Senseless Attack</PRE>
<P>You won't find a more determined and passionate FBI agent than Hubbard
(Denzel Washington), who now has the very difficult task of
confronting a new wave of terrorism that is spreading across New York
City.  But what makes his job virtually impossible in stemming the
tide is that the perpetrators, in this case Arab fundamentalists, are
all suicide bombers that do not hesitate to take their own lives as
long as it means the utter destruction of some building or the
meaningless death of innocent civilians.  What's worse, these
terrorist cells work independently of one another, which means that
there is no way to bring down the operation in one fell swoop.  The
first act of aggression is truly terrifying and leaves a lump in your
throat as you watch the scene unfurl.  Hubbard will summon all of his
resources to combat the situation.  </P>
<P>The fact that the suspected terrorists are Arabs brings Agent Elise
Kraft (Annette Benning) onto the investigation.  She has special
knowledge of the Arab sector, but also seems to have an ulterior
motive for being there.  Continually trying to circumvent Hubbard at
every turn, she wants to help the determined agent, but has her own
agenda to follow.</P>
<P>The first 40 minutes is actually quite intense, and really sets the
stage for possibly a great and thrilling movie.  But knowing that
Hubbard would be fighting several terrorist cells, I could see that
this film would suffer from a glaring weakness.  And it did.  Great
movies always have a great villain that masterminds the evil scheme. 
Remember `Speed', a movie about a mad bomber and a bus (played with
malicious intent by Dennis Hopper)?  But here, the fundamentalists are
all suicide bombers all too ready to take their own lives.  Once we
learn who they are, they are soon dead, either by bombing themselves
or shot down by the local police.  The all-important
‘hate-the-villain' factor is completely missing.</P>
<P>Terrorism and violence escalates.  The city streets are becoming
deserted.  Hubbard still can not locate the remaining terrorists
cells.  A state of martial law is thus declared and the film
completely shifts gears, now emphsizing a message over the manhunt. 
Suspicious of all Arabs, they are herded into interrogation camps
where they are harassed and humiliated.  It seemed like a strange turn
of events for the audience member.  I can't imagine that this movie
ever intended to be a statement on our constitutional rights.  If it
was, it was upstaged by a marvelously intense beginning.</P>
<P>I give credit to Washington who infused energy into his role and
Benning, who showed sass and smarts as well.  Bruce Willis, however,
had a thankless role as the General that oversaw the city during its
state of martial law.  His role asked him to do nothing but verbally
punch out military rhetoric and patriotic jingoism.   But the real
problem with this movie is that it hits the ground running, but
ultimately gets lost because the story abruptly shifts gears and
because the terrorists want to die.  `The Siege' starts with a
blitzkrieg of suspense, but its power wanes considerably over the
final 90 minutes.</P>
