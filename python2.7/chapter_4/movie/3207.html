<P>     If the score of IMMORTAL BELOVED is remarkable, that of THE
MADNESS OF KING GEORGE is no less so.  With the clear strains of
Handel's "Water Music" and "Zadok the Priest" in the background, THE
MADNESS OF KING GEORGE ascends to a level that it might never have
attained using a modern composer.  The musical selections (made by
George Fenton) are so perfectly and expertly interwoven into the film
that one might easily assume the score had been specifically written
for Nicholas Hytner's production.</P>
<P>     Opening in 1788, more than five years after England lost her North
American colonies, THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE relates a dark episode in
the king's reign.  Bothered by increasingly painful abdominal pains,
George (Nigel Hawthorne) begins to act irrationally and belligerently.
The doctors--mostly a bunch of jumped-up quacks--do nothing for
him.  His eldest son and heir, the Prince of Wales (Rupert Everett) is
eager to see his father declared mad so he can take over as regent.
Ministers, retainers, and others at court begin to scheme how to get
the most out of the king's indisposition.  At last, when all appears
lost, Prime Minister Pitt (Julian Wadham), aided by Queen Charlotte
(Helen Mirren); her Mistress of the Robes, Lady Pembroke (Amanda
Donohoe); and Greville (Rupert Graves), one of the king's aides; sends
for Dr. Willis (Ian Holm), a doctor of the mind with a reputation for
curing dementia.</P>
<P>     THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE is much more than a simple study of one
man's descent into insanity.  With a style that's more tongue-in-cheek
than melodramatic, the film is always witty and occasionally
satirical.  The characterizations are flawless (as well as historically
accurate), and the political wrangling of the Tories and Whigs (led by
PM Pitt and Charles Fox, respectively) provide a deliciously complex
backdrop.</P>
<P>     Medical historians are generally agreed that the cause of George's
madness was something called porphyria, an acute, intermittent,
hereditary disease that is physical (rather than mental) in nature. The
king's symptoms, including blue urine and gastric crises, match those
of porphyria, although some have postulated that there may have been a
secondary affliction, such as manic-depression, involved.  Whatever the
case, as this film illustrates, it's clear that there were times when
George was unfit to rule.</P>
<P>     Anyone who dislikes being poked by and prodded at by doctors will
find some amusement in the petty disagreements within the small corps
of physicians attending the king.  One insists that blistering the skin
is the only way to extract the bad humours that cause the madness.
Another constantly takes the king's pulse.  A third advocates examining
the royal chamberpots--the stool being "more eloquent than the
pulse."  Only Dr.  Willis, with his hypnotic gaze, gives the impression
of competence.</P>
<P>     Without exception, the acting is top-notch.  The four
principles--Hawthorne, Mirren, Holm, and Everett--do fine jobs.
Hawthorne's performance is especially noteworthy, allowing us to
understand, and occasionally even sympathize, with a decidedly arrogant
and dislikable personality.  The supporting players, which include such
recognizable faces as Amanda Donohoe and Jim Carter (as Charles Fox),
are of equal quality.</P>
<P>     Despite allusions to KING LEAR, this movie's strength is in its
story breadth, not its depth.  A lot happens here, but few of the
themes take root beyond their surface meaning.  Adapted from the play
THE MADNESS OF GEORGE III, the film trims copious portions of dialogue,
leaving behind a tightly-paced picture that has the feel of something
created for the screen rather than for the stage.  Certain subplots are
watered down or eliminated, but what survives is more than enough to
keep KING GEORGE a source of solid entertainment.</P>
