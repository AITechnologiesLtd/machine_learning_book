STAKEOUT (1987)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>Movie-loving people who used to live in former Yugoslavia
probably had the best times of their lives in a short, but
blissful period between mid 1980s and early 1990s. That
Golden Age happened thanks to the mass advent of VCRs -
something that took domineering socialist economy by
surprise. Legislation of the dying Communist regime wasn't
prepared any better, so the legal limbo was (mis)used by the
cunning entrepreneurs of the private sector, ready to flood
the hungry market with bootleg tapes of the latest Hollywood
blockbusters. Average video-consumer of those times had an
excellent opportunity to enjoy latest Hollywood products
sometimes only few weeks after U.S. premiere, which was
great improvement over pre-video era, when the average wait
used to be 3-4 years. Of course, there were drawbacks - the
picture quality was abysmal, and the translation on
subtitles was sometimes even more imaginative than the movie
itself. In a few rare occasion that benefited slumping
theatre industry, because people were inclined to go see
movies on the big screen, simply to find out what really
went on at the movie. But sometimes, on even rarer
occasions, people who had previously seen movie on video,
went to the theatre to re- watch it, simply because they
liked it on a small screen. The first movie that did that
for the author of this review was STAKEOUT, 1987 action
comedy by John Badham.</P>
<P>The movie plot begins when Richard "Stick" Montgomery (Aidan
Quinn), sociopathic cop killer, escapes from the maximum
security prison with the help of his cousin Caylor Reese
(Ian Tracey). FBI organises the nation-wide manhunt, and one
of the possible leads could be Montgomery's ex-girlfriend
who lives in Seattle. Two Seattle police detectives - Chris
Lecce (Richard Dreyfuss) and Bill Reimers (Emilio Estevez)
are assigned for the stakeout. At the beginning, two men
hate the boring job, but everything changes when they
finally see the object of their surveillance - beautiful
Maria McGuirre (Madeleine Stowe). That is especially true
for Chris, who, after a while can't stop bumping into the
woman, against Bill's better judgement. After a few
accidental encounters, it turns out that the feeling is
mutual and one thing leads to another.  However, the romance
seems ill-fated from the start, due to some practical
problems. Chris must hide his true identity from the woman
he loves, and at the same time he must find the way to hide
his unprofessional behaviour from the colleagues and
superiors.</P>
<P>Some of today's viewers might be tempted to consider this
movie as nothing more than just another in a series of "high
concept" cop movies. That trend indeed produced mostly
disappointments, including some really unwatchable garbage,
but sometimes we could enjoy some real pearls including this
one. Screenplay was written by Jim Kouf, writer whose work
before and after was of a mixed quality (most notable is his
underrated SF thriller HIDDEN, made in 1986).  He decided to
avoid the usual formula of such movies (main attraction -
e.g. pairing of black woman detective with epileptic partner
-  plus series of clich‚s and conventional storyline
automatically patched together) and really worked to make
the plot as realistic as possible. His characters are also
real human beings, and the best example could be Chris and
Bill, two policemen who, unlike their cardboard or
superhuman colleagues in other movies, really talk and act
like someone we could envision as real-life cops. The life
of policeman, as portrayed in STAKEOUT, isn't fascinating
nor exciting at all - most of the time is spent on routine
and mostly boring assignments. Even the high- tech
surveillance, something that used to be portrayed as
frightening future in previous movies by John Badham (BLUE
THUNDER) here becomes boring part of everyday life, and even
the vouyeristic benefits soon lose their appeal. Instead of
becoming obsessed with the object of their surveillance, our
heroes are more concerned with ways to fight boredom; one of
them, that provides charmingly realistic comic relief, is
practical joke war with another surveillance shift. The
general realistic tone of the movie is good ground for the
successful blend of standard cop action and comedy.</P>
<P>Sadly, this combination of action and comedy was the last
big movie of John Badham, whose career later sunk into
mediocrity (including the disappointingly bad sequel ANOTHER
STAKEOUT). However, in this movie Badham has a nice
opportunity to combine his skills of action-oriented
director with comedy. STAKEOUT might be almost two hours
long, but Badham knows how to wrap a lot of attractive
material in that package. One of those materials is a
photography by John Seale that provides a nice contrast
between grey Vancouver exteriors (x-philes would recognise
not only the locations of their favourite series, but also a
some notable members of supporting cast) and warm interiors
- contrast that illustrates the warmth in the hearts of our
heroes. The soundtrack of Arthur B. Rubinstein isn't too
inspired (some elements of BLUE THUNDER musical score  might
be recognised) and more often than not Badham uses songs in
the background to advance the plot. Perhaps the only major
flaw would be Badham's acceptance of Hollywood's formulaic
big showdown in the finale - but even the standard showdown
in an empty warehouses provided some room for minor twists
and some humour.</P>
<P>However, the biggest attraction of the movie are the actors,
or, to be more specific, one single actor. Richard Dreyfuss
had proved his comedic potential long time ago, but here he
shows that he can do the same thing as Eddie Murphy - carry
out entire movie almost single-handedly due to his talent.
His portrayal of Chris is wonderful - grey-haired,
experienced policeman whose mature exterior seems to be in
great contrast with his comic personality and flaws that
seem to impair his efficiency as policeman. Another amusing
contrast is provided by his partner, played by Emilio
Estevez (who had to grow moustache to look older in his
first adult role), who happens to look more mature than his
twice older partner. Chris' immaturity and irrational
acting, however, is quite justifiable since the object of
his attention is played by Madeleine Stowe, one of the most
beautiful actresses in Hollywood. Stowe, who would repeat
femme fatale routine in many other movies, here shows a
great comic talent and her interaction with Dreyfuss is
delightful. All the other supporting actors are good, even
Aidan Quinn in the role of psychopatic boyfriend, who had
enough space to make his token bad guy multi-dimensional.</P>
<P>All in all, STAKEOUT is full of contrasts - it is realistic,
yet entertaining movie; serious and funny in the same time.
But, more than anything, it is that kind of movie that would
make people enjoy it without feeling guilty.</P>
