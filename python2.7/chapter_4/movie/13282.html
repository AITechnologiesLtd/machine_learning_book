<P>Gary Fleder's sophomore film after THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE
DEAD (7/10) explores the seedy world of the serial killer.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Forensic doctor and cop Cross gets heavily involved in a serial
killer's dossier, after his niece becomes one of the psycho's kidnapped
victims. Kate also gets nabbed by this lunatic (the self-professed
Cassanova), but quickly escapes and teams up with detective Cross to
locate her sick captor and the rest of the victims.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Eerie, dark and effective serial killer thriller. I like to call it
SEVEN (8.5/10) "light". It certainly has a lot of the qualities of
SEVEN, with the competent acting of Freeman, a pretty neat and at times
claustrophobic directing style, and a decent "who donnit" twist. Mind
you, that's about where the similarities end. This film goes deeper
into the "backdoor" shenanigans of said killer, and shows his
techniques and despicable methods of capture. The scene in which Judd
gets kidnapped by the psycho is also very terrifying.</P>
<P>The premise of the film is good, and so is most of the build-up,
although I did find some of the methods used to find the homicidal
maniac a bit far-fetched, the overall film worked for me on a suspense
level. The bad guy was totally creepy and mysterious. The plot twists
were good, but admittedly full of holes. And the style and acting in
the film was top-notch (I'm also a big Ashley Judd fan, so sue me!).</P>
<P>On the down side, I guess that it was a little too much like SEVEN and
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (7.5/10), but without their great plot lines or
extreme suspense. Also, the plot did contain many holes, the ending was
weak, and Elwes' Southern accent was awful. But overall, it still works
as an effective thriller with some thrills, a couple of chills, and a
good night of fun stuff!   </P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Ashley Judd's mother and sister are country singers Naomi & Wynona
Judd. She had a role in Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS (8/10), but
it was left on the cutting room floor. The movie does contain evidence
that she was in it though. She is fluent in French and once dated Bobby
DeNiro, Matt McConaughey, and Mickey Bolton.
In the early seventies, Morgan Freeman became widely known for his role
as Easy Reader on PBS's educational television program, The Electric
Company.
Cary Elwes' real name is Ivan Simon Cary Elwes. He was born in London,
England. <HR>Visit JoBlo's Movie Emporium
