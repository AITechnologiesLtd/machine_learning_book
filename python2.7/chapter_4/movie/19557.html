<P> In famous words: they don't make em like they used to.</P>
<P> When they used to make serial killer movies, the serial killers were guys.
When they used to make serial killer movies, the serial killers used an axe
or a chainsaw.  When they used to make serial killer movies, the serial
killers weren't happily married with children.</P>
<P> Hey, things change, and change is good.</P>
<P> Serial Mom is a serial killer so different from the norm that you have to
laugh out loud.  Sure, its got enough gore to satisfy any horror fan, but it
also has a nice satiric edge to it, one that will make anyone with a dark
sense of humor laugh.</P>
<P> Taking a stab (sorry, couldn't resist) at the golden age of television, you
have Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner), who appears to be a nice mother on
the surface but inside is a completely deranged serial killer.  The motives
for her crimes are silly breakings of social convention (cutting people off
in the parking lot of Jo-Anne's fabric, standing a girl up at a flea market,
eating chicken, wearing white shoes after labor day, etc.), to which she
responds with a viscous psychopathic murder spree (is there any other
kind?).</P>
<P> Her son is obsessed with horror movies, her husband a mild mannered
dentist.  Her daughter is a social reject, and she is a pillar of the
community.</P>
<P> The film goes incredibly fast, displaying the time periodically at the
bottom of the screen, so as you are constantly aware of how quickly the
story is progressing in the scary world that the movie creates.  As she
kills, evades police officers, and goes on car chases, Beverly acts as if it
was all a game (she's smiling and giggling all the time).</P>
<P> Almost a precursor to Scream (which ironically also featured Matthew
Lillard), Serial Mom also picks on horror movies.  A trio of teenagers is
always watching them, and the movies are what initially piqued Beverly's
fascination with gore.  Of course, she only likes gore in the movies.  When
the time comes that she has to remove a bodily organ from the end of a fire
poker, she's all "ewww."</P>
<P> A warning for potential viewers of this film: you must have a dark sense of
humor.  I'm not talking pseudo-dark. I'm not talking "I thought Scream was
funny" dark.  I'm talking laughed like Robert DeNiro in Cape Fear during
Very Bad Things dark.  You've got to be able to find humor in the most
pessimistic of situations, while keeping your mind open to the general gist
of the movie (the McCarthy era was that of complete repression, which has
potentially insane side effects), and that's very tough.</P>
<P> Another warning, this film is not for the weak of stomach.  It's got gore
all through, and has enough violence to generate a lobbyist feeding frenzy.</P>
<P> This film should also probably be seen as a warning against those that are
fascinated and deify the violence on the screen.  A highly comedic and
strangely moral story, Serial Mom is a film that makes every other horror
movie you have ever seen seem tame in comparison.  It can function as a raw
horror movie, but can only be truly appreciated outside of the realm of
campy teenage viewing.  Half of the jokes are too old for most teenagers to
get, anyway.</P>
<P> Kathleen Turner shines as the psychopath, giving one of the most memorable
performances as a villain in the 90s.  Sam Waterson crawls out of his usual
"Law & Order" shell as the husband of a serial killer.  Mathew Lillard
reminds me of Nicole Kidman's character in To Die For: someone willing to
ride the hype wave of a murder for all that its worth.  Ricki Lake actually
gives a half decent performance, but she's under the skillful direction of
John Waters (Pecker).</P>
<P> If you're not weak of stomach, heart, or mind, go see Serial Mom.  If you
are weak in any one of these three aspects, the film will murder you.</P>
