<P>Black Dog
Rated PG-13
By James Sanford
The Kalamazoo Gazette<HR>----
If you've ever wondered what really goes on in those truck-weighing
stations, "Black Dog" will be an edifying experience. If you've often
dreamed of seeing 18-wheelers plunging off cliffs, rolling down embankments
or careening all over the road, here's your chance. If you sometimes find
yourself trying to imagine what Randy Travis would sound like if he
intentionally tried to sing badly, the answer comes in this movie.
But those people who manage to pass the Freightliner lot without drooling
will probably find "Black Dog" pretty much bites. Though the quartet of
screenwriters who churned out this little pot-boiler devised dozens of ways
to stage crashes - in this movie, no truck goes off the road unless there's
a train, a building or a tanker marked "ultra-octane" in its path - they
failed to work in any suspense or real drama, relying instead on stock
situations likely to prompt snickers from even the least-discriminating
audience.</P>
<P>Determined to never say die even though he's failed as a muscle-bound hero
before in "Roadhouse," "Next of Kin" and "Steel Dawn," Patrick Swayze takes
the role of stolid Jack Crews, an ex-trucker and ex-con who served two years
for vehicular manslaughter.</P>
<P>Since his license is now revoked, Jack wants to work as a mechanic, but his
crooked-as-a-Black Dog's-hind-leg boss Cutler (Graham Beckel) pressures him
to accept $10,000 to get behind the wheel again and haul a mysterious cargo
from Georgia back to New Jersey. Though a nightmare involving a snarling
black pit bull portends bad luck, Jack agrees to make the run when he learns
the bank is about to foreclose on his house unless he can come up with
$9,000 right away.</P>
<P>So Jack heads for Atlanta (which a title helpfully identifies as "Atlanta,
Georgia" so we won¹t mistake the location for Atlanta, Hawaii), commandeers
an imposing-looking Peterbilt from the nefarious Red (Meat Loaf) and rolls
north. However, a series of attacks from machine gun-toting motorcyclists,
road-hogging rigmasters and Red himself - who frequently quotes the Bible,
which in the eyes of Hollywood, must mean he¹s a nut - cause Jack to realize
he's transporting more than just a cargo of toilets.</P>
<P>Jack would dearly love to put on the air brakes on the whole situation, but
scheming Cutler has resorted to the unorthodox employee-motivation technique
of holding Jack's wife and daughter hostage until the job is done. Oh yeah,
the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are also involved,
just for good measure.</P>
<P>Although there are no stops along the way for showers or hair appointments,
Swayze manages to stay neatly coifed throughout the arduous trip, despite
being shot at and slapped around at every turn. Since Swayze's dour
performance is strictly one-note Travis' rugged but relaxed charm is most
welcome. Loaf is tiresome as the villain, and though director Kevin Hooks
went to the trouble to hire the marvelous character actors Stephen Toblowski
and Charles Dutton for his supporting cast, they have nothing to do but bark
at each other as feuding Feds.</P>
<P>As a second feature at a drive-in, "Black Dog" might serve as a passable
time-killer, but it's far too ludicrous and deadpan to cut it as a
legitimate action movie. The script introduces the potentially interesting
element of one of Jack's co-workers being a traitor only to throw it away
minutes later, and other opportunities for plot development are also quickly
squelched as the pile-ups just keep on a-comin'.</P>
<P>Those who enjoy laughing at lousy dialogue will find "Black Dog" contains
numerous howlers, such as Cutler¹s claim that Jack "could drive a truck
through Hell on the Fourth of July." Also rich is Jack's impassioned speech
to his wife: "We moved out of Newark so Tracey could have a yard and go to a
school without metal detectors in the hallways. I¹m not going back!"</P>
