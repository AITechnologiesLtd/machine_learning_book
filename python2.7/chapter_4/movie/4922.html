<PRE>                               THE BIRDCAGE
                       A film review by Ed Powell
                        Copyright 1996 Ed Powell</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, and Gene Hackman.
Directed by Mike Nichols, a United Artists release.</P>
<P>This is a terrific movie for the 1990s.  "The Birdcage" is a tale about a
young man (whose parents are a gay couple (played by Robin Williams and
Nathan Lane) and he has never met his biological mother), who meets a
young woman (whose father is an ultra-conservative Republican senator
(played by Gene Hackman) and mother looks and sounds like she came
straight out of the world of "Leave it to Beaver") and they decide to get
married.</P>
<P>The problem is that the woman's parents want to meet the man's parents. In
order to keep the woman's parents from flat-out going insane at the
concept of the inlaws being a gay couple (as a stereotypical conservative
Republican is want to do), they try (with very limited success) to make
everything seem like a normal, "moral ideal American" family.</P>
<P>Robin Williams proves once again that he is a great dramatic actor as well
as a foot-stompingly funny comedian, Nathan Lane played his role as a man
acting as a woman so well, it scared me, and Gene Hackman is, as always,
good in anything.</P>
<P>Although I have never seen "La Cage Aux Follies", on which this film was
based, I imagine that an extensive rewrite was required to make this film
a
fable for the 1990s.  We could all learn a little something about
tolerance
and accepting lifestyles that are unlike our own from this film.  Bravo to
the writers, bravo to director Mike Nichols, and bravo to the actors and
actresses who made this film an entertaining work of art.</P>
<PRE>Score:  57 out of 60  (9.5 out of 10)</PRE>
