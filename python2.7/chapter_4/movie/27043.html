<P>   I once worked with a guy--we taught together in a New
York City public high school--at a time that teachers had
become unionized and were making fairly good pay.  He
wasn't happy. I thought we were doing OK.  He said, "C'mon,
Harv...everyone I graduated from college with is making lots
more than we are.  When the big corporate boys tell you that
teachers are doing fine, that's just to keep us quiet, to make
us think we're better off than we really are."  This fellow
sounded unhappy.  Despite the allegedly low pay he griped
about, he had purchased a three bedroom house--OK, it was
in a less fashionable area of New Jersey--but it was a new
house, it was built by Levitt (so there was not much
differentiation between his and his neighbors') but, what the
heck.  He had a nice wife, three kids who didn't become
dopers or criminals, a new car every five years.  He kept
talking about Harry, Dave, and Mike who got out of Columbia
U. the same year as he did who were making big bucks on
Wall Street or in the computer business.  "But are they
happy?" I'd say with a grin, knowing that this led to his usual
response.  "Damn right they are, and you would be too if you
made their dough."</P>
<P>   There we go with the old question: does money buy
happiness?  Or to put this another way, can you be
pleased most of the time if you made a decent, honest living,
had a loving wife that made you the envy of your neighbors,
and two adorable kids...and if so, what are the chances you'd
be happier as this family man than as an arbitrage expert
living in a posh Manhattan pad with no wife and no children? 
Who knows?  We send a man to the moon but we still don't
have a happiness meter.</P>
<P>   No matter.  Brett Ratner tells us the answer in "The Family
Man," a Capra-esque comedy-drama not as sentimental as
"It's a Wonderful Life" but with some acting that updates the
Jimmie Stewart-Donna Reed qualities to the 21st century. 
About the big question: wonderful family with a decent living
vs. no family and big bucks, which is better...would I be
giving it all away if I mentioned that the movie opens during
Christmas week?</P>
<P>   Turns out that "The Family Man" is the best date movie of
the year.  The individuals whose lives are explored are not
callow twenty-somethings who are too young to have a clue
beyond their sophomoric discussions, but two people in their
mid-thirties who are leading a mostly wonderful life in their
modest New Jersey dwelling with a daughter of about six and
an infant still in diapers.  The story takes off during an
emotional scene at JFK airport as Kate (Tea Leoni) tries to
persuade her boy friend Jack Campbell (Nicolas Cage) to
chuck his flight to London where he is to begin a promising
career in high finance.  She wants him to look at a modest
life with her, convinced that once Jack gets on the fast track,
it's goodbye relationship.  Jack pulls away, boards the plane,
and some time later is seen as the president of a company
about to arrange a 130 billion merger deal.  But he's single,
he has lost touch with Kate, and he lives in a tony co-op on
Manhattan's East Side.  He's content enough until he finds
out what he could have had--as a mysterious man (Don
Cheadle), not quite a Bagger Vance type but still equipped
with formidable powers--transports Jack temporarily into the
kind of life he would have had if he took the road not taken.  
Instead of reporting to CEO Lassiter (Josef Sommer), he
takes on the responsibilities of being husband to a far prettier
person and father to two adorable but demanding youngsters.</P>
<P>   Nicolas Cage does best when he's cornered...put into
dramatic situations whether of life and death (as with his role
as the suicidal drunk in Mike Figgis's "Leaving Las Vegas") or
off-the-wall intensity as in John Woo's "Face/Off"--in which he
and Travolta both fly over the top beautifully.  Life-and-death
stakes are introduced here, but Brett Ratner--giving a well-
paced visual display of Diamond and Weissman's screenplay-
-is more interested in spiritual life than in the physical one. 
The one flaw that I see in the film is that Cage's character is
hardly dead spiritually when he is doing the job he was made
for across the polished mahogany tables in his high-stakes
firm.  He sings in the elevator, he is delirious at the thought
of sewing up another difficult deal, he has a beautiful woman
visit him in his Manhattan digs quite enough to satisfy him. 
Should he give it all up to grow old with the likes of Tea
Leoni's Kate?  Take a look at this riveting beauty and you
might be tempted to say so.</P>
<P>   Ratner should elicit considerable interest from his audience
with a sci-fi gimmick which has us think: How would I survive
if suddenly I were plunged into a world in which none of the
people I work with recognized me and all the people of my
new life knew me while I was acquainted with only one of
them?  The picture combines a twilight-zone ambiance with a
sentimental, but not cloying, comedy-drama making "The
Family Man" some difficult-to-beat holiday fare.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 120 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
