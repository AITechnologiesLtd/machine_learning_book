<P>    If only "Together" came out on the big screen in 1975, during
the year that is actually represented by Lukas Moodysson's often
hilarious comedy about life in a Stockholm commune!  Better still,
wouldn't it have been grand if the movie existed in, oh, about
1948.  Invite Mao and Fidel, Nikita and Leonid, even the
incorruptible Pol Pot to the screening instead of a group of critics
who are hardly about to change the world.  Then, maybe--not
likely but maybe--they'd see the silliness that Communism
represents.  We wouldn't have had to go through a Cold War after
1945, there would have been no Berlin Wall to knock down, no
Cambodians would be driven out of the cities by Kampuchean
nut-cases.  We'd even get to see whether these Reds were as
humorless as Reds are made up to be, because if they couldn't
get a laugh out of "Together," they're probably hopeless.</P>
<P>   OK, granted that the type of Communism that these politicians
preached was not the pure kind envisioned by the inhabitants of
Tillsammans.  Their lives were more like those of utopian
communities like Oneida in upstate New York or, on a larger
scale, similar to the Israeli kibbutzim--the only example of real
Communism in the world today.  Through Moodysson's tale, we
get quite a bit of insight into why these perfect communities have
all failed, why only two percent of Israelis choose to live in
communal conditions, why Communism has not brought
prosperity to a single state in which it ever existed.</P>
<P>   But enough serious philosophisizing because there's nothing
deadly serious about this comedy of proletarian manners. 
Moodysson introduces an array of characters from his country
who, during the time that the hippie movement was on its last legs
in the U.S. are still true believers in equality and, yes, even the
type of free love practiced by the Woodstock generation in the
U.S.   They're more interested in discussing politics and
philosophy than in sex, it seems (except for one horny female),
spending their time making up lists of chores to be done and
dividing the responsibilities equally--until, that is, one woman
challenges the concept of washing the dishes because she
considers such cleanliness and neatness "bourgeois."  The work
detail is just one of the points of disagreement that would
eventually cause the commune to crack at the seams.  The
principal catalyst is the introduction of two bourgeois kids into the
home,  one being the 14-year-old daughter of Elisabeth (Lisa
Lindgren), a newcomer to the collective who has fled from an
abusive husband to be with her communard brother; the other,
the son of the folks across the way who tut-tut about their
neighbors' way of life but look kind of envious as they train their
binoculars on the people whom they assume are conducting
round-the-clock orgies.</P>
<P>   "Together," however, is not a pro-capitalist movie any more than
it is in favor of the strict kind of communal living that these people
are striving to maintain.  While there is not a single really
obnoxious person in the company (at least when you get to know
all of them and dismiss such things as wife-slapping), they seem
to be clueless about things that other people take for granted--
people  who do not live in their heads and do not even know the
meaning of the term "ideology."  TV.  Vegetarianism.  Equal
sexual access to men and women.  These are not the issues that
face the rest of us--the bourgeois people who are damn proud of
their conventional, middle-class lives, but they are the things that
erode the well-being of the experimental community.  No sooner
do the two 14-year-olds--who have a crush on each other once
they discover that their eyeglasses are interchangeable--introduce
a small, black-and-white TV and a handful of hot dogs into the
community, things begin to change.  We'd say that they move
politically to the center without embracing the bold new world
envisioned by George W. Bush.</P>
<P>   "Tillsammans" shows those of us who witnessed the Woodstock
generation that the hippie movement was in no way restricted to
the U.S. and that the seventies were nothing more than a phase
that seems to have lasted just a bit longer than hula hoops and
D.A. haircuts.  These endearing young people look goofy to us,
but at least they had more on their minds than piercing their
tongues and abusing the word "like."  A fun picture all the way.
