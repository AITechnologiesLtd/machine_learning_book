<P>ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (1969) **</P>
<P>        In between YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and DIAMONDS 
ARE FOREVER was this odd little James Bond film.. I shouldn't call 
it a little film; it's 140-minute running time is the longest of the Bond 
series. It's also the only one to star George Lazenby (Never heard of 
him? Neither have I.) as 007. Being sandwiched between two Sean 
Connery movies makes this one look that much more amateurish in 
comparison.</P>
<P>        The epic running time is absolutely unnecessary, as the real 
story doesn't begin for an hour and a half, by which time most other 
movies would be almost over. That first 90 minutes gives us a lot of 
expository information with little action, save the traditional opening 
teaser, and that's not even up to par with the other movies in the series.</P>
<P>        Bond is still after Blofeld (who first popped in YOLT and 
again in DAF and is now played by Telly "Kojak" Savales) here, but 
tired enough of chasing him to take a two-week leave of absence from 
the service. That's when he meets Tracy (Diana Rigg, a.k.a. Emma 
Peel of "The Avengers"), the first woman he truly falls in love with. (I 
guess 700 really is his lucky number.) And certainly his plans for 
marriage don't have anything to do with the fact that Tracy's father, a 
crime boss, offered valuable information about Blofeld's whereabouts if 
Bond would marry his daughter.</P>
<P>        So Bond rushes off to Blofeld's mountain hideout, populated 
by a bevy of beauties who think he's curing them of their allergies, 
when he's really grooming them to destroy Western civilization as we 
know it. (Talk about your unconventional therapy techniques!) Bond 
meets his three-woman quota there before Blofeld discovers that he's 
not really a genealogist on research. The usual death traps and chases 
ensue, including a ski run chase that would be redone and improved 
upon in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.</P>
<P>        ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE has a little merit. 
The story is decent, albeit way too overblown and long-winded, but 
adding the romance aspect to the Bond series was a good idea, even if 
they did have to add the obligatory young-couple-in-love song 
montage. And there is a truly touching moment at the end of the 
movie. But on the whole, this movie is to be viewed only by the Bond 
fan who absolutely has to see every movie in the series. Otherwise, just 
skip right over it and you won't miss a thing.</P>
<P>        OHMSS has far less action than the others and George 
Lazenby doesn't quite cut the mustard as James Bond. (He does cut the 
cheese a few times, to the disgust of the other characters.) Rolling 
Stone called Lazenby "a one-shot joke" and I have to agree. The 
Rolling Stones called him "Jumpin' Jack Flash" and I have to say I 
have no idea what that means.</P>
