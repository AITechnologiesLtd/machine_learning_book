<PRE>                                     SIRENS
                       A film review by John M. Bozeman
                        Copyright 1994 John M. Bozeman</PRE>
<PRE>        CAPSULE REVIEW:  A minister and his wife head into the nether
        regions of Australia to try to tone down the scandalous
        content of an artist's pictures.  Set in the first quarter of
        the twentieth century and laden with artistic pretensions,
        this flawed film does contain a few redeeming qualities.</PRE>
<P>     The movie reviewer for the Charlottesville regional arts newspaper
hates most new movies, so when he called SIRENS a "cheesy bit of soft
core porn [that] masquerades as a meditation of repression and sexual
liberation," I thought that he was exaggerating.  Unfortunately, he was
not.  Not since the unfortunate film adaptation of LADY CHATTERLY'S
LOVER (starring Sylvia Crystal) have I seen such a slick, high-budget,
and clumsy attempt at dealing with sexuality on the silver screen.</P>
<P>     The basic story goes as follows: an Australian painter (played by
Sam Neill) is creating a stir as a result of his voluptuous paintings
of classical subjects.  The Church dispatches an English minister (Hugh
Grant), accompanied by his wife (Tara Fitzgerald) to try to persuade
him to tone down the brazen nudity found in the artwork.  In the face
of cavorting, flirtatious, unbelievably beautiful models, the minister
remains affable but resolute in his quest--but wait!  His wife, against
her will, comes to appreciate the earthy passion on display here,
eventually sharing a night of ecstasy with the seemingly handicapped
(supposedly almost blind and perhaps mute) handyman with the body of
Adonis.  We also see the prejudice and hypocrisy of the nearby
townspeople, who shun the artist and his models while clandestinely
longing to engage in the very acts that he portrays in his work.</P>
<P>     When it comes to symbolism, this film surely puts the "b" back in
"subtle."  Like THE FISHER KING, SIRENS is laden with pretentious
symbolism that hits one in the face again and again; one can almost
hear the film's creators patting themselves on the back over their own
cleverness.  On the one hand we have the minister, representing dry,
intellectual, passionless, asexual, conventional, dull traditional
reason; on the other we have joy, passion, intensity, sexuality, and
artistic spontaneity represented by the artist and his crew of
mischievous vixens.  I suppose that the minister's wife is supposed to
represent us, the audience, who for a while partakes of the sublime
essence of raw art, but who in the end goes back--though leavened a
bit, and even perking up her rather bookish husband.</P>
<P>     In spite of these limitations (along with a few sex scenes so
pretentious as to be embarrassing), this movie does have some redeeming
qualities--but probably not the ones that the film's creators
intended.  Far more than the silly, prevalent ideology of sexual
liberation, the most impressive aspect of the film was the occasional
humanity that creeps in:  the frustration of the models with their
being shunned by the townsfolk; the superficially silly, but in
actuality profound devotion of the minister for his wife, despite his
knowledge of her participation in activities with lesbian sexual
overtones; the minister's liking and apparently honest concern for one
of the younger models.</P>
<P>     Indeed, I suppose I am a bit of a conservative, but I found the
minister to be the most enviable person of the bunch, and for this I
commend the producers.  Rather than being portrayed as a stodgy,
doctrinaire fuddy-duddy, he is intelligent, well-read, honest,
generally faithful, and (within his context) tolerant of the
narcissistic, hedonistic silliness going on around him.  Both he and
his wife retain an honest ability to care for others, in the face heady
passions with strong undercurrents of insincerity bordering, in some
cases, on duplicity.</P>
<P>Overall grade:  C+ (OK for a half-price matinee)</P>
