<PRE>_Analyze_This_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>In its first two acts, Harold Ramis's comedy uproariously mines
co-scripters Kenneth Lonergan, Peter Tolan's premise for all its comedic
worth.  Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal make a terrific team as,
respectively, a tough mob boss and the shrink who reluctantly treats him
for recurring panic attacks.  Crystal's effectiveness comes as no
surprise (OK, maybe so in light of recent pathetic efforts such as
_Forget_Paris_ and _My_Giant_), but the true comedic firecracker of the
two is DeNiro, who is explosively funny taking a self-deprecating spin on
his usual mafia screen persona.</P>
<P>So when DeNiro's character disappears for a good chunk of the home
stretch, so does the explosive energy of his performance and presence. 
Strangely enough, Crystal cannot pick up the comedic slack; the film's
climax is his showcase, and his schtick comes off as just that, schtick,
in comparison to DeNiro's relaxed comic ease.  One performer who could
have possibly risen to the challenge is co-star Lisa Kudrow, but she is
woefully underused in the equally as undeveloped role of Crystal's
fiancee.  But even if it does not end quite as well as it begins,
_Analyze_This_ offers more laughs than any other comedy so far released
in 1999.</P>
