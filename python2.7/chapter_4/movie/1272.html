<PRE>                            THE ADDAMS FAMILY
                      A film review by Ken Johnson
                       Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>100 min., PG-13, Comedy, 1991
Director: Barry Sonnenfeld
Cast: Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, Christopher Lloyd, Christina Ricci,
      Elizabeth Wilson, Judith Malina, Dan Hedaya, Jimmy Workman</P>
<P>     Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston head the bizarre Addams family.
Julia has a fortune in money hidden in his gigantic house.  An evil
family wants to take Julia's money.  They send in Christopher Lloyd, who
looks just like Julia's brother, Uncle Fester who disappeared twenty
years before.  Lloyd has to fit in with the Addams family in order to
find out where the money is hidden.</P>
<P>     I found THE ADDAMS FAMILY to be a very good and funny film.  THE
ADDAMS FAMILY is slapstick comedy, but not as good as THE NAKED GUN 2+:
THE SMELL OF FEAR.  On a zero to five scale I give it a four.  THE
ADDAMS FAMILY is rated PG-13 for explicit language and adult situations.</P>
<P>     THE ADDAMS FAMILY, until just recently, has been playing in most of
the big theaters, it is now playing in the smaller theaters, and will
soon be coming to video.  I just saw the film at a reduced rate, and
found it worth the money.  I highly recommend if you are a fan of comedy
you watch this film at a small theater or wait for the video.  Not
everybody will like this film however.  My father gave up on the film
after about ten minutes because he said that the film was pointless,
plotless, and filled with corny gags.  My mother was not very impressed
with the film either because she said that it had a stupid plot, was
pointless, and during the entire film she laughed only four times.
However, I know several people who enjoyed the film very much.   So,
because of the wide range of reaction to the film you might want to wait
for the video so that you don't feel that you wasted your money.</P>
<P>     THE ADDAMS FAMILY is based on an old black-and-white television
show by the same name.  The actors/actresses have been changed.  I have
never seen the television show so I don't know if it is like the film,
but episodes have recently come out on video because of the popularity
of the movie and I plan to rent them to see if they are any good.</P>
<P>     My favorite character/thing in the film was the hand; I also feel
that it was the most likable thing in the film.  I liked the idea of
having just a hand and giving it personality, however, it is totally
unrealistic, and that might turn some people off from the film.  I also
really liked the Addam's neighbor.  He's not on for much time but was
funny when he was on.  The two kids Pugsly and Wednesday (played, in
order, by Jimmy Workman and Christina Ricci) were cool, but not as good
as the rest of the cast.  I felt their roles were under written.  Raul
Julia and Anjelica Huston were ... well ... bizarre.   And Christopher
Lloyd (Dr. Emmett Brown in the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy) was good, and
funny, as the fake Uncle Fester.</P>
