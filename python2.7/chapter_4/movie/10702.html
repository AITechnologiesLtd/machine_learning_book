<P>   "No matter how much you try to be a creator, you're only
along for the ride," concludes Jack Morrisey (Dennis Leary),
the principal character in Argentine-born writer-director Juan
J. Campanella's movie.  Based on the Latin American novel
"Ni El Tiro Del Final" by Jose Pablo Feinmann, "Love Walked
In" is yet another entry into the noir genre, a story of a writer-
pianist who is hoist by his own petard but who is ultimately
redeemed.  Campanella's story fall into the age-old category
of fables that illustrate the saying, "The grass is always
greener on the other man's side," featuring a guy who has a
sexy wife but wants money pitted against another who has
the cash but desires a sexy woman.</P>
<P>   Life just isn't always fair and doesn't Morrisey know it.  Here
he is, a fine cocktail pianist who accompanies his sultry wife,
Vicky (Aitana Sanchez Gijon), a singer in a Long Island
supper club, but he is unhappy about the kind of living he's
making with these gigs.  After all, he's a multi-talented man,
an unpublished writer who creates melodramatic mystery
stories in his spare time, has a vivid imagination, and best of
all can articulate his philosophy of life with ease and savoir
faire to a mostly apathetic audience.  Puffing on a cigarette
and assuming a Brechtian tone of voice, he insults his bored
audience with his view that they are the haves and he a have-
not, yet what have they done to deserve their money?  One
particular member of the crowd who happens to own the club
and a spacious mansion nearby--as well as property in
Europe and a pied-a-terre in New York City--acquired his
fortune simply by marrying well.  A regular guest at his own
club, Fred Moore (Terence Stamp) is under the surveillance
of a private detective, Eddie Bianco (Michael Badulucco),
hired by Fred's wife (Marj Dusay) who suspects her mate of
infidelity.  When Eddie proposes a sinister plan to his friend
Jack to extract a large sum of money from Mrs. Moore--one
which recalls the situation attending the far more commercial
movie, "Indecent Proposal," Jack goes along.  The scheme is
to have Vicky seduce Fred while the private eye snaps
pictures of the infidelity, and blackmail Fred lest the evidence
go to Mrs. Moore's attention.</P>
<P>   To add gravity to the narrative, Jack imagines an assembly
of characters in a similar situation, an alter-ego named
Howard who is likewise exploited into committing unethical
and illegal acts.  Jack's mistake is in thinking that reality
follows art: that an invented scheme put on paper will not
necessarily work in real life.  So while Jack's fictional
characters proceed, smoothly at first, to carry out their evil
deeds, Jack runs into several detours which cause him to
think anew about what he already has rather than obsess
about the money he would like to possess.  Denis Leary, who
has already shown his depth by succeeding as a stand-up
comic, and as a romantic hero (in "Two If By Sea"), and who
has appeared not only on the screen but on English and
American stages, turns in an adept performance as a man
overtaken by greed. His chemistry with his charming wife,
played by Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (best known to American
moviegoers for "A Walk in the Clouds"), is palpable, though
the latter's affinity for the much older millionaire played by
Terence Stamp is unconvincing.</P>
<P>   "Love Walked In" has the look of a low-budget movie but
makes up for a deficiency in polish by an absorbing plot and
exceptional acting by Mr. Leary.   Rated R.  Running Time: 90
minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten</P>
