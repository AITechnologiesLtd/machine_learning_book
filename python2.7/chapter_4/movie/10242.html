<PRE>RATING: **1/2 (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>Miramax / 2:06 / 1997 / R

Screenplay: Ben Affleck; Matt Damon </P>
<P>Just in time for the holidays comes "Good Will Hunting," a 
well-cast drama intent on delivering that warm-and-gooey feeling, 
so much that it's a surprise to learn this wannabe-uplifter comes 
from usually-dark director Gus Van Sant. A December 25th release 
date actually couldn't be more appropriate, because this movie is 
so much like the big Christmas dinner you'll be downing on that day 
-- it certainly looks appetizing, but it'll leave you overstuffed, 
even ending with a send-off so drawn out that it's the cinematic 
equivalent of L-tryptophan. </P>
<P>Good's icky title refers to its main character -- Will Hunting 
(Matt Damon), a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. Will's secretly much brighter than most of the students 
attending there; said attribute is revealed after esteemed 
Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård from "Breaking the Waves") 
posts a too-tough math problem on a blackboard for his students to 
solve, and only Will is bright enough to crack the answer. 
Initially, Will and Lambeau are rivals, but the latter comes to the 
former's aid after the young ruffian is jailed on an 
all-too-frequent assault charge. </P>
<P>Lambeau has a couple conditions for keeping Will on the streets: 
One, they work side by side on math theory; two, Will see a 
psychiatrist on a regular basis. After several unsuccessful 
pairings, a spark is ignited with unorthodox therapist Sean McGuire 
(Robin Williams), an old friend of Lambeau's. Will's time is then 
divided between being helped by McGuire and hanging out with his 
old Boston buddies, namely best pal Chuckie (immensely likeable Ben 
Affleck from "Chasing Amy"). There's also time for a romantic 
subplot involving Skylar (Minnie Driver), a beautiful, brainy 
Harvard student who falls for Will. </P>
<P>Van Sant, who last directed the explosive media satire "To Die 
For," keeps things moving in a conventional way. The movie bears 
none of his eccentric trademarks; just when you think things are 
about to get engaging, they stay steady with disinteresting 
development. The screenplay, co-written by Damon and Affleck, is 
pretty standard; they know how to create compelling characters but 
don't do much compelling with them. At best, "Good Will Hunting" is 
watchable, but it's rarely moving or sentimental. </P>
<P>If the heart of "Good Will Hunting" is the relationship between 
Will and McGuire, then it's a shockingly empty one. Their first few 
sessions, as they begin challenging each other's minds, hold 
promise, but future interaction is formulaic, predictable and 
uninvolving. Far better is the screen time devoted to Will with 
Skylar and Chuckie. There might be a better movie there, but the 
problem is that this development is secondary to Will's therapeutic 
process. Damon and Affleck are close friends in real life, and 
their chemistry is apparent, adding much potency to scenes that 
aren't very important. Driver, as she did in last April's "Grosse 
Pointe Blank," turns what could have been a throwaway role into 
something special; I found her scenes with Damon to be far more 
concentrated than anything else in the film. </P>
<P>Because "Good Will Hunting" is a performance-driven piece, I can 
recommend it. There's an abundance of good acting here, including 
Williams scoring big with an atypically serious role; he does that 
goofy shtick so often (most recently in tripe like "Flubber" and 
"Fathers' Day") that it's easy to forget what a good dramatic 
player he is. It's just that there's little emotional investment 
made in the story. When "Good Will Hunting" stacks on a plethora of 
stirring climactic events, it's akin to going to a party where you 
don't know anyone and something disastrous happens -- you really 
just don't care. </P>
