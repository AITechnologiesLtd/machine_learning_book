<PRE>THE MOD SQUAD
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>The Hollywood creative rut of recycling old TV show reruns has finally
gotten deep enough to reach The Mod Squad.  A ridiculous show to start
with, should we be surprised that it has spawned an even more ridiculous
movie?</P>
<P>It seems that the qualifications to work as a cop are completely
optional.  At least that is what Detective Greer (Dennis Farnia) decides
when he recruits three young criminals to form an elite, though
weaponless, undercover squad...the Mod Squad.  Whose great idea was
this?!?  The film conveniently starts in media res, so we never get to
hear Greer's arguments for turning the justice system on its head.</P>
<P>In any event, the Squad is composed of Julie (Claire Danes), Linc (Omar
Epps) and Pete (Giovanni Ribisi), guilty respectively of assault, arson
and robbery.  Their mission in the movie is to infiltrate a high class
prostitution ring.  Oh, and to look cool while doing it.</P>
<P>But things quickly go wrong.  Soon, The Mod Squad are embroiled in a web
of murder, deceit, drug deals and police corruption.  Before you jump to
the conclusion that this sounds interesting, let me assure you that any
life and excitement that may have one time inhabited this plot has long
since fled the scene.</P>
<P>The Mod Squad's best attribute, nay, its only positive attribute, is its
sense of style, and even that is troublingly forced.  Shot with moody
colored lighting, and the occasional wild angle, The Mod Squad is less
of a film that an extended length music video...without the
entertainment factor.</P>
<P>There are a few good actors buried under the moldy plot and pointless
dialogue.  The film tries to give each of the Mod Members a poignant
scene or two.  Julie runs afoul of an old flame (Josh Brolin), Pete
tries to reconcile with his parents, and Linc...well, Linc really likes
his car.</P>
<P>But then, there's the plot.  Ugh...what a plot!  The whole thing relies
on the bad guys clearly stating their evil intentions in a loud enough
voice to make any James Bond villain proud.  I guess since policework is
this easy, it's no wonder any random criminal can be a cop.</P>
<P>And don't go to see The Mod Squad expecting any excitement.  The
characters themselves even remark how incredibly boring it is, sitting
around in cars.  And yet, nothing is ever done to liven things up.  Even
the few "action" scenes are dull and lifeless.</P>
<P>The Mod Squad is the type of film that is best enjoyed merely from
watching its commercials.  Subject yourself to this mindless movie in
quantities larger than 30 seconds, and you'll certainly regret it.</P>
