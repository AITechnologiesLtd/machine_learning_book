                   CURDLED and 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY
                   A film review by Michael Dequina
                    Copyright 1996 Michael Dequina</PRE>
<P>Curdled (R) ** (out of ****)
2 days in the Valley (R) ** (out of ****)
        Those looking for evidence that Quentin Tarantino is the most
influential filmmaker of the moment need look no further than not one, but
two recent releases, the macabre comedy Curdled and the ensemble
comedy-thriller 2 days in the Valley.  Pairing black humor with bloody
violence, both attempt to duplicate, to paraphrase the Coens' Barton Fink,
"that Tarantino feeling"... and come up short.
        Tarantino himself executive produced Reb Braddock's Curdled, based
on Braddock's short of the same name.  The film centers on Gabriela (Angela
Jones), a Miami woman who has a had a fixation on death since she was a
little girl in her native Colombia--she even keeps a scrapbook of newspaper
articles about murders, drawing depictions of the crimes next to each
article.  When she sees a TV ad recruiting people for a company that cleans
up after murder scenes, she knows she's found her calling and immediately
signs up.  Of course, her new job puts her into contact with danger, namely
one Paul Guell (William Baldwin), a.k.a. the Blue Blood Killer, who stabs
and beheads women from Miami's upper social echelon.  It also just so
happens that Paul's murder spree is Gabriela's latest morbid obsession.
        The plot is enough to sustain 28 minutes, which is how long the
original Curdled short lasted.  Stretched out to a little over 90, the
thinness of the premise is all too evident; a number of scenes and
characters feel like padding, and the movie doesn't kick into full gear
until the last act, when Gabriela and Paul finally meet.  And for a black
comedy, writers Braddock and John Maass are a little too heavy on the
"black" and too light on the "comedy."  While the entire package is amusing
and never boring (look out for the connections to From Dusk till Dawn), real
laughs are few and far-between; however, the film never skimps in terms of
blood, the letting and collection of it.  The wallowing in gore is more
sensational and exploitative than anything else, and it is bound to turn off
many a moviegoer.  I suppose Braddock was trying to get under people's skin,
but the subtler moments, like Gabriela's haunting
retrace-the-steps-of-the-murder-victim dance, are more disturbing and funny
than, say, the gruesome finale, which comes equipped with a joke that's more
cheesy than hilarious.
        The performances are a mixed bag.  Jones and her fascinating
character of Gabriela (of which she played a variation in Tarantino's Pulp
Fiction) are by far the best thing the film has going for it.  Gabriela is
an interesting paradox--a woman who  always wears dresses and speaks in
soft, accented, little girl tones but on the inside is far from an innocent.
Baldwin, on the other hand, picks up where he left off in the awful Fair
Game, relying on a single facial expression to convey certain
characteristics.  In Fair Game, Baldwin made his eyes bulge and gritted his
teeth to convey toughness; here, he constantly makes his upper lip curl to
signify evil.  Mel Gorham is quite good as Gabriela's all-business cleaning
partner, and MTV personality Daisy Fuentes makes her acting debut as another
co-worker, but her role is so minute that it's still not clear whether she
can really act or not.
        Strong performances are about all there is to second-time
writer-director John Herzfeld's 2 days in the Valley, an interesting but
none-too-funny ensemble piece.  Herzfeld's knotty scenario has a murder in
California's San Fernando Valley link ten diverse characters: an Olympic
skier (Teri Hatcher); a no-nonsense hitman (James Spader); his icy Swedish
girlfriend (Charlize Theron); a past-his-prime hitman (Danny Aiello) deathly
afraid of dogs; an effete British art dealer (Greg Cruttwell); his put-upon
assistant (Glenne Headly); his nurse half-sister (Marsha Mason); a has-been
TV director (Paul Mazursky); and two vice cops (Eric Stoltz and Jeff Daniels).
        Actually, I should say _nine_ characters, for Daniels's racist cop
disappears midway through the action and thus has really nothing to do with
anything.  Aside from his anomalous presence, Herzfeld does find interesting
and creative ways to link these characters.  But structure isn't everything
to a picture, especially not a comedy, and 2 days's slapstick farce is more
labored and silly than funny despite some high points (the vicious brawl
between Hatcher and Theron being the highest).  With his wide assortment of
oddball characters and flashes of violence, Herzfeld was obviously shooting
for a mix of Tarantino and Robert Altman--Pulp Fiction meets Short Cuts, to
use the popular comparison.  The film does come off as a Tarantino/Altman
hybrid, but it's more like Four Rooms meets Pret-a-Porter.
        So just what does the mediocrity of the Tarantino-inspired Curdled
and 2 days mean?  Quentin, get thee back behind the camera--quick.<HR></P>
