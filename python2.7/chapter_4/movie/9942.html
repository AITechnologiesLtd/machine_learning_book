<PRE>THE RAINMAKER (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>The Rainmaker is an utterly predictable film. With that said, I have to
tell you that I really loved The Rainmaker. Being predictable is a small
flaw that is easily overlooked because of it being a well-directed,
well-acted, and fun movie.</P>
<P>Having come out of seeing the last courtroom drama, Red Corner, The
Rainmaker comes as a surprise to how it handles the courtroom scenes. Which
is to say the courtroom scenes are put at a minimum while the personal side
of the lawyers is shown more. This easily takes away most of the cliched
courtroom scenes (the surprise witness, the talking killer, etc) and
introduces a warmth to a courtroom/legal system film.</P>
<P>Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is newly out of law school. He joins up with a
firm that is, unbeknownst to him, dirty and is headed up by a scoundrel
lawyer, Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke). While in the firm he has two cases
that he continues to pursue from a law workshop, the big one is what the
film concentrates on, but the smaller one is not overlooked either.</P>
<P>The enemy in The Rainmaker is an insurance company. Rudy's first big case
is for a young man with leukemia fighting against the big insurance
company. On the side he has a smaller case of writing a will for an elderly
lady. And while at a hospital trying to field clients he meets and
inevitably falls in love with a married and abused woman (Claire Daines).
All these plot lines work well together during the film, and each touch the
other in one way or another.
As the cops and a Federal probe gets closer and closer to Rudy's dirty boss
Bruiser, Rudy and Deck (Danny DeVito) take a wad of cash that Bruiser gives
them and they start up their own law firm. What is nice is that the
courtroom scenes are not "played up" for drama. Ford Coppola actually lets
the two, Rudy and Deck, act nervous in court, and this puts a good
down-to-earth spin to the courtroom scenes.</P>
<P>There is an added touch of comic relief that is added to The Rainmaker this
makes the movie so much better than the average courtroom drama. The
Rainmaker is not a comedy in any sense, but Ford Coppola is able to insert
these small moments to get a laugh out of the audience.</P>
<P>There are some pretty big names in this film and they go from small parts
to big parts. There are three big name stars in The Rainmaker that I loved
the best. The first is a major role and that is Danny DeVito as Deck, the
legal assistant to Rudy. Deck has tried the bar exam six times, but has yet
to pass. Though at times it seems that Deck knows more than Rudy, who has
passed the bar. DeVito gives a great performance in The Rainmaker. The
second big name performance that I loved was that of Danny Glover as the
judge Tyrone Kipler. Though Glover's part is small, he does a wonderful job
with it, and he is just a joy to see on the screen again (I last saw him in
Switchback). Last but not least is Jon Voight as the high paid scummy lead
lawyer serving for the insurance company. Voight who I last saw overacting
in the horrible Most Wanted, redeems himself here in The Rainmaker. His
performance as the lead lawyer, Leo F. Drummond, is brilliant, and you can
just seem the slim dripping off of him.</P>
<P>But, the real star of The Rainmaker is Matt Damon as Rudy. Damon gives a
wonderful performance as Rudy and as the film is setup he has a lot of
performing to do. His part is the center of the film, and the film is
basically a character study of his character. Damon does wonderfully in his
part, and I hope to see him in more films soon.</P>
<P>The music by Elmer Bernstein is strange, but it most definitely fits the
movie in most places. It changes moods constantly and consistently with the
action on the screen, but for me the score sometimes sounded out of place.</P>
<P>After seeing a slew of bad films this fall, I'm happy to say that The
Rainmaker is great movie. It is highly entertaining and though somewhat
flawed it shouldn't be missed because it is well-directed, well-acted, and
just plain fun. Don't Miss this film.</P>
