<PRE>PUSHING TIN (M).  
(Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: Mike Newell
Stars: John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett, Angelina Jolie, 
Jake Weber, Vicki Lewis, Kurt 
Fuller, Matt Ross
Running time: 124 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Pushing Tin takes us inside the rarely seen, high pressure
world of air traffic controllers.  These are the men who are
responsible for the safe landing of thousands of planes at New York's
three busiest air ports daily.  It's a stressful job, with a high rate
of suicide, severe depression, alcoholism and marriage breakups.  Like
MASH, this comedy/drama explores the sense of camaraderie that binds
over-stressed workers together, both at work and at play.</P>
<P>Pushing Tin is based on a magazine article written by a tower
insider and, frighteningly enough, reeks of authenticity.  While the
film often presents the human face of this intense but little known
environment, it doesn't exactly instil those who may be flying
somewhere in the near future with a sense of confidence.</P>
<P>Nick "the zone" Falzone (John Cusack) is New York's cocky
young hot shot controller, who is good at his job and revels in the
notoriety.  He finds his status challenged by the arrival of Russell
(Billy Bob Thornton), a maverick veteran who has come to New York
seeking greater challenges.  Russell once stood under a landing 747
just for the experience.  Testosterone quickly fills the air, and a
fierce spirit of competitiveness erupts between the two star
controllers as they attempt to upstage one another and prove their
machismo.</P>
<P>But then Nick breaks an unwritten rule of the tower fraternity
when he sleeps with Russell's seductive young wife Mary (Angelina
Jolie, from Hackers, etc).  Wracked by guilt, Nick slowly comes apart,
and both his career and his marriage are threatened by his
uncharacteristic and increasingly erratic behaviour.</P>
<P>Writers Glen and Les Charles, who wrote for tv sitcoms Cheers
and Taxi, explore this world with plenty of humour, although the
script contains a few slow and awkward patches.  British director Mike
Newell (Four Weddings And A Funeral, Donnie Brasco, etc) maintains a
fairly light tone throughout, although he does bring an edgy humour to
the material.</P>
<P>The central performances are all superb.  Cusack gives a solid
and increasingly neurotic edge to his performance and catches that
fragile line that most controllers walk.  Thornton brings his
characteristic droll style and down to earth charm to his role, and
does his best with a slightly underwritten role.  Aussie actress Cate
Blanchett is strong and appealing as Nick's bored suburban wife,
heavily into self-improvement courses, while Jolie brings a seductive
and sexy quality to her lesser but pivotal role.</P>
<P>Pushing Tin is an enjoyable enough film, but somehow its
melodramatic plot development leaves one feeling vaguely unsatisfied
that it didn't cut closer to the bone in exploring the on-the-edge
lifestyle of these men.</P>
