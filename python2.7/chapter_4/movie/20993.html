<P>Even if you know the premise of Being John Malkovich before you see it,
the story will still seem very odd.  The idea is simple – a struggling
puppeteer takes an office job and finds a portal to John Malkovich's
brain behind a filing cabinet – but it's still quirky enough to dance
circle after circle around its unoriginal competition.  The film is a
daringly creative, visually stunning and wonderfully acted fantasy.</P>
<P>The film opens on a blue curtained stage, where a marionette performs an
intricate dance before what sounds like a very receptive audience.  We
soon learn that the puppet was created in the image of its maker and
operator, Craig Schwartz (John Cusack, Pushing Tin), that the stage is
located in his workshop and that the crowd noise was just a tape.  An
incredibly gifted but tormented puppeteer, Craig is unable to find work
in the dummy business and is often reduced to working for spare change
on the streets of New York.  He claims that the puppet business shuts
him out because he `raises issues.'</P>
<P>Although Craig's wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz, There's Something About Mary)
has a full-time job at a pet store, he can no longer afford to wait for
his big break in puppetry.  One day, while perusing the employment
notices, he finds an ad for a local business that is looking for a man
with fast hands.  Thinking this could be the best opportunity to earn
some cash and keep his digits in shape, Craig heads for LesterCorp, but
doesn't bother to cut his Jesus-hair, shave or even change his clothes.</P>
<P>This is when things begin to get weird, as Craig enters LesterCorp's
building only to find it listed in the lobby directory as being located
on Floor 7½.  There is no elevator button for 7½, which presents an
immediate problem.  Then, when Craig finally makes it onto 7½, he finds
a hallway with ceilings only five feet high.  But the furniture and
people are full-sized, which makes everything seem very Alice in
Wonderland-ish.</P>
<P>Craig gets his job – speed filing – and immediately begins working for
his new boss, the 105-year-old Dr. Lester (professional game-show
panelist Orson Bean) and his hearing-impaired `executive liaison' Floris
(Mary Kay Place, Pecker).  His orientation consists of a videotaped
history of his employer's compact floor, where he meets and instantly
falls for the lovely Maxine (Catherine Keener, Your Friends and
Neighbors), before eventually finding the entrance to Malkovich's brain
after accidentally dropping a file behind a cabinet.</P>
<P>Once in Malkovich's brain (Malkovich plays himself), you see things as
he does for fifteen minutes before being shot out of the sky somewhere
over the New Jersey Turnpike.  One of the film's true joys is the
excitement people have about the sheer banality of the famous actor's
life, whether its eating toast or ordering linens.  By the end of the
picture, Craig is able to control Malkovich like a giant puppet, in the
only predictable facet of the inventive story from debut scribe Charlie
Kaufman, who also served as an executive producer.</P>
<P>Aside from the highly original script, kudos must be given to multi-MTV
Video Award winner Spike Jonze, who has made a rather auspicious feature
film debut, and cinematographer Lance Acord, who filmed the equally
creative Buffalo '66.  The acting is fantastic, especially Cusack and a
nearly unrecognizable Diaz, and Malkovich (The Man in the Iron Mask)
appears to have a grand time making fun of himself.  Look for cameos
from Sean Penn, Brad Pitt and a very funny Charlie Sheen.</P>
<P>If you're looking for something daringly original, do not miss this
film.  If you liked Runaway Bride, you should probably stay away.
Really far away.</P>
<P>1:52 – R for adult language and strong sexual content</P>
