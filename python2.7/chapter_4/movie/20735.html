<P>You've got to hand it to Lawrence Kasdan .  When he finds a niche he
likes, he stays with it.  Once again, the writer/director of THE BIG CHILL
has taken a large talented cast and multiple story lines, woven them
together and formed a mostly comedic, but sometimes touching movie.</P>
<P>MUMFORD takes its name from the small town that serves as its setting.
Also from the last name of the central character, "Doc" Mumford.  Though
he has only arrived in Mumford four months, two and one-half weeks ago, he
already has more patients than the town's other two headshrinkers.</P>
<P>Doc Mumford is a young psychologist with an unusual methodology... He
makes it up as he goes along.   He has to, seeing as he has never taken a
course in psychology.  But that doesn't stop him from "treating" the
residents of Mumford, who respond by revealing their "secret lives" to him
without knowing that he has one of his own.</P>
<P>Never having taken the Hippocratic oath, Mumford's amateur status is
manifested in other ways:  He has a tendency to talk about his patients
and their problems to other townspeople, he refuses treatment when it
suits his purposes, and he falls in love with one of his patients.</P>
<P>If having three psychologists (actually, one's a psychiatrist) in a small
town seems excessive, it is only because you haven't met the good people
of Mumford.  They are an eclectic group in need.</P>
<P>Doc Mumford's patients include:  Althea Brockett (Mary McDonnell,
INDEPENDENCE DAY), a compulsive shopper who takes that condition to a new
high; Henry Follett (Pruitt Taylor Vince, COLD AROUND THE HEART), whose
1940's style sexual fantasies somehow don't include a role for him; Skip
Skiperton (Jason Lee, DOGMA), a goof-ball, skateboarding,
multi-billionaire who has learned that it is lonely at the top; Nessa
Watkins (Zooey Deschanel in her film debut) a teenager unhappy with her
looks and life but way too cool to admit it; and Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis,
ARLINGTON ROAD), suffering from the symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
and in whom Doc Mumford takes a special interest.</P>
<P>While the movie's structure prevents them from becoming a truly ensemble
cast, each of the actors do fine, credible work in their respective
scenes.  Loren Dean (ENEMY OF THE STATE) appropriately underplays the role
of Doc Mumford, allowing our focus to remain on the various supporting
characters and the effect the "doctor" has upon them.  Alfre Woodard (DOWN
IN THE DELTA) has some good moments as Lily, Doc's friend and sounding
board and perhaps the only resident of Mumford not in need of his help.</P>
<P>While MUMFORD is, at its core, a sweet, charitable film, for some
miscalculated reason Mr. Kasdan included enough sexual images and nudity
to bump the MPAA rating to a well deserved R.  This inclusion distracts
from and weakens the film instead of adding to it.  MUMFORD is a "PG"
movie dressed in "R" clothing that satisfies neither audience.</P>
<P>  The miraculous treatment that the "doctor" has stumbled upon is nothing
new.  It is called "listening and caring."  The people who came to Doc
Mumford needed someone with whom to share their innermost thoughts and
Doc, via his non-clinical, nonprofessional responses, communicated to them
that he genuinely cared for them.  Thus they began their first steps on
the road to healing.</P>
<P>God has called us to do the same for each other:</P>
<P>"Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as
also ye do."  1 Thessalonians 5:11 [KJV]</P>
<P>There is no godly reason for anyone to ever feel alone in this world.  If
nothing else, we can pour our hearts out to God Who always hears us.  And
as we include God in our lives, we are welcomed into and become part of a
larger community comprised of a family of believers and a household of
faith.</P>
