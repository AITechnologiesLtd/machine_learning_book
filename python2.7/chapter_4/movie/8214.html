<PRE>                               DREAM WITH THE FISHES
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
          Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: **1/2 (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>When you know you're going to die, the food looks better but you can't
smell it.</P>
<P>That's just one of the many bittersweet observations about death in "Dream
With the Fishes," writer Finn Taylor's offbeat directorial debut.  An
official selection at this year's Sundance Film Festival, the film can
easily be described as "promising."  Viewers with little sympathy for
missed opportunities, however, are likely to be more interested in Finn's
*next* project.</P>
<P>"Dream With the Fishes" is pretty quirky.  Much of its quirkiness is drawn
from the fact that its lead characters, Terry (a nervous, voyeuristic dweeb
solidly played by David Arquette) and Nick (awkwardly realized by Brad
Hunt), are both close to death.  When Nick--who's dying of some unspecified
disease--first meets Terry, Terry is about to commit suicide by jumping off
a bridge.  Rather than talking him out of it, Nick suggests a less messy
but ultimately unsuccessful alternative, and their evolving friendship
leads to a bizarre pact: if Terry will help Nick live out his fantasies
before his time is up, Nick will return the favor by killing him.</P>
<P>Taylor could have gone on a shopping spree with this setup.  Instead, he
tries to balance the story with a combination of offbeat and serio-tragic
episodes.  The quirky ones work: the two engage in some late night nude
bowling with a couple of hookers, for example.  The script's more serious
turns, unfortunately, don't.  When Nick returns to his childhood home in
order to make good on his estranged relationship with his father, their
conversation deteriorates into embarrassing cro-magnon hijinks.  It's
obvious that Taylor is less comfortable with these scenes of domestic
reconciliation than he is with his characters doing--and talking
about--wacky things.</P>
<P>A lot of the ground is familiar or just plain stolen (including a lottery
sequence lifted straight out of a "Full House" episode).  A psychic down at
Fisherman's Wharf tells Nick "you will be given the job of protecting all
the fishes."  This results in him, off-camera, stealing a fish, just the
one fish, from the local aquarium and letting it loose in the sea--huh?.
Often Nick asks Terry about fulfilling *his* fantasies too, but the best
Terry can come up with is "all you can eat Cracker Smacks."  A strange
response from a man we've already witnessed spying on Nick's tattoo artist
girlfriend, Liz (Kathryn Erbe) and other sad women through binoculars.</P>
<P>Grainily photographed (at least in the beginning; for some reason the
graininess disappears about halfway through the film--perhaps this is what
the Sundance people mean by a "lean style"), "Dream With the Fishes" offers
a wonderful soundtrack of tunes by the likes of the Waterboys, Squirrel Nut
Zippers, and Sun Volt that, unlike many pre-packaged indie song scores,
actually fits the mood.  Taylor also employs the splendid Cathy Moriarty as
Nick's Aunt Elise, a faded dancing queen, but her presence is another
example of unrealized promise.</P>
<P>Auspicious is too strong a word to describe the director's first effort,
for "Dream With the Fishes" gets by less on what might have been and more
on its implicit assurances of what's to come.</P>
