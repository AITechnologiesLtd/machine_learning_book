MY NAME IS JOE (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Kenneth Loach</PRE>
<PRE>Writer: Paul Laverty</PRE>
<P>Starring: Peter Mullan, Louise Goodall, David McKay, Anne-Marie Kennedy, 
David Hayman, Gary Lewis, Lorraine McIntosh</P>
<P>Lucky for us, "...and I'm and Alcoholic" didn't fit on the marquee, 
because then we may have been guaranteed another tiresome story of a 
man's struggle against his past cornball affliction, which it could have 
very well been. It also could have been yet another in a long line of UK 
social commentary, where the characters and everything else that 
possibly go into filmmaking take a distant backseat to sometimes sharp, 
sometimes unabashedly naive satire - basically one of my major pet 
peeves - but miraculously enough, social commenter Ken Loach opts to 
toss that in the backseat, and run away with everything else, including 
characterization and emotion. And thank god, because not only have we 
seen too much UK social commentary in the last decade to last us our 
entire lives, but we've not had many films that are this alive and this 
intelligently realistic. Love stories these days seem to follow a 
tiresome group of cliches, like the people in love are merely taking the 
appropriate steps, and trying to get from point to point without every 
just savoring moments like the ones here. And when "My Name is Joe" is 
lingering over shared moments between not only its two protagonists, but 
with others like a soccer team and other aquaintances of the leads, it's 
one of the best films of the year. It has such a natural energy to it 
that doesn't feel put-upon, and such a whimsical brand of charm and wit 
that even when it begins to look like it may fly into Mt. Cliche, it's 
easily forgivable because we're near sure that other great moments and 
scenes are going to come up and bring us back into the movie, and only a 
couple more times does the alcoholism and recovering from thereof come 
back into play, and only once in a cliched fashion (that's not a bottle 
in his hand, is it?!).</P>
<P>And without all the great stuff that Ken Loach and company bring to the 
film, it would have been yet another movie about a man's escape from his 
past, which it basically is, only here the emotions are felt and earned. 
Joe, the main character, is played by Peter Mullan as a energetic, 
un-bitter man who's had a rough life before the present, but is eager to 
make up for his past life and maybe even find happiness. Many of we 
yanks may actually recognize Mullan: he's starred in not only in Danny 
Boyle's "Shallow Grave" (as one of the doomed henchmen), but also in 
"Trainspotting" (as the bald, buff, drug dealer, Mother Superior), and 
here finally comes into light as a strong and wonderful actor (he's 
already won himself an award at Cannes, and rightfully so). He has a 
welcoming presence, kind of like a more appreciable Will Patton, with a 
deep tobacco voice and an instantly aimiable presence that makes his 
character effortlessly sympathetic. He wears a windbreaker and sneakers, 
and seems impatient and always on the move, despite the fact that he's 
currently jobless.</P>
<P>He's also the coach of a local soccer team, which he handles like a 
father fusses over kids, and one day when picking up one of his players, 
he runs into a social worker named Sarah (Louise Goodall), has a bit of 
a tiff with her, and runs into her later on. Pushy yet not creepily, he 
gives her his phone number, offering to do her wallpaper for some extra 
money, and is soon flirting with her and then going out on a date with 
her. They get alone greatly and quickly, because they've both in their 
own way been beat down and aren't expecting much, and are soon carrying 
on a relationship that makes the both of them extremely happy. These are 
the best parts of the film because, depsite a couple put-upon instances 
(she locks herself out of her house and has to stay at his house for the 
night...), they have a natural comedy and feel that never succumbs to 
cornball sentamentalism (even a scene where he tells her about why he 
has a Beethoven tape that opens up a deep wound feels completely and 
100% real). The second half, which adds local drug dealing tension to 
the story, seems less real, though, and more like a need to fulfill the 
otherwise-goodguy-pulled-back-to-his-past formula. One of his soccer 
players, an otherwise superb chap named Liam (David McKay) finds he owes 
a good sum to a local mafiaso named McGowan (David Hayman), but can't 
pay it, even after his wife had tried to pay it off by dealing while he 
did a brief stint in jail (and ended up using a bunch of it). Feeling a 
father-like relationship with him, Joe goes to bat for him, and agrees 
to pick up two cars for McGowan filled with drugs, despite his wondering 
why Liam can't just do it.</P>
<P>Basically, it's a guess-what-happens-next rhetorical question here, but 
strangely enough, while the actual plot elements of Joe picking up drugs 
and trying to save Liam feel a touch on the fake side, the love story 
and the story of Joe never feel like they've been trifled with, and, in 
fact, they seem to only be accentuated and built upon because of them. 
This is because through everything, we understand Joe's character, and 
we can realize that despite doing otherwise stupid things, he's really 
trying to prove himself a good person all along, even if he can't 
correctly balance everything. And when the romance slowly becomes 
severed because of his involvement with McGowan, we feel that what's 
happening as a result is real, even if what has actually happened to 
cause the complications seem a bit fake. Even by the time he's resorted 
to the cliche of doing away with his alcohol aversion, we don't feel so 
much that a cliche has been touched upon, but that Joe himself as a 
character and as a person has been deeply woudned, perhaps without any 
hope. Frankly, despite the rampant use of cliches and contrivances, "My 
Name is Joe" posesses a really damn good story because it's told so well 
and in such an involving and unique manner.</P>
<P>And because Joe is seen as a good guy but with flaws (the occasional 
outburst of dramatics, the need to always do the right thing and be 
selfless, his desire to be happy, etc, etc), it's easier and much more 
comfortable to feel that Joe is a character worth caring about, and 
through most of it, he's not been destroyed by his past but by his own 
personality. He's not controlled by a plot, which is giving him a shit 
deal; he's giving himself a shit deal, and it's more justified for we 
the audience to care about what happens to him. A subject like this is 
many a time more interesting than a social commentary or another 
recovering alcoholic story, and it's told by Loach in such an 
idisoyncractic way, making due notice of the foibles and characteristics 
of its characters, that it's almost a shame that it does introduce the 
McGowan subplot at all. Loach has shot it using a dark, pale tone, 
accentuating the more dark aspects of the film's undertones (of a 
plagued society - thankfully, this is left as merely an undertone), but 
this is not a depressing movie - it's filled with life and the 
cinematography only gives it a deeper feeling of naturalism, despite the 
fact that the stateside print of this film has been given distracting 
(though helpful to some - not me, though) subtitles, perhaps a result of 
bitches about the regional accents in such UK films as "The Full Monty" 
and "The Butcher Boy," which start out I thought as a joke, but then 
continue on, like annoying closed-captioning.</P>
<P>And by the end, despite a rather sobering stream of tragic events, "My 
Name is Joe" is less of a social commentary or a traditional story of 
good guys with tragic lives and more of a celebration of life, since the 
best moments are the moments where the characters are just being, and 
these moments tend to overcome the otherwise traditional moments that 
populate a good deal of the second half. Even the ending, which could 
have otherwise been maudlin and generic, seemed like an emotionally 
devastating blow to the head without ever going too far, and without 
tending to stand out as bad moves in a film which is so filled with 
humor and wit (the comedy in this film, including stabs at a bagpipe 
player and the soccer team's uniforms, peeks its head up sporadically 
without feeling like it was tossed in there as a break). My only wish 
was that this film was more affecting, and took more advantage of the 
naturalism that it so wonderfully displays in the less didactic scenes, 
which are amongst the best of the year. For a film that steers so far 
away from sucumbing to becoming maudlin, it'd be nice if it just went - 
and excuse my clumsy allusion to a recent Disney movie here - the 
distance.</P>
<P>(And yes, that's Gary Lewis, of Gary Lewis and the Playboys, as Joe's 
chum, Shanks).</P>
