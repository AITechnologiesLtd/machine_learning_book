<PRE>Review: One Tough Cop</PRE>
<P>Starring: Stephen Baldwin, Chris Penn, Gina Gershon, Michael McGlone</P>
<PRE>Directed by Bruno Barreto</PRE>
<PRE>Approx 95 min</PRE>
<P>Unfortunately it doesn't get much more formulaic than One Tough
Cop. There's the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many
problems to explain. The renegade has to prove his good name and is
trapped between the good guys, the bad guys and some woman who really
has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the
purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film.</P>
<P>Bo Dietl (pronounced Deedle, Baldwin) is one tough cop, a guy who is
being investigated by hardass FBI agents due to his association with
the NY Mafia. On top of that problem, he has a drunk, gambling
addicted partner (Penn) who has a penchant for collecting parking
tickets (I guess cops aren't immune?). Then, throw into the mix the
femme fatale (Gershon). Right there you have plenty of ammo for a
decent cop drama. But right in the middle of the film, they throw in a
completely un-related plot point. Dietl and his partner Duke try to
solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from. The film
spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and
raped to near death. Once the case is solved, the film shifts focus
back to the mafia issue. Whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to
create between the two stories failed miserably.</P>
<P>Aside from being asked to accept Michael McGlone as a Mafioso (an
insult if you ask me) the performances were pretty good. Baldwin,
though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother Alec,
does a fine job as one tough cop. Penn, who also slips into an
impression of HIS brother Sean, is even better as a loser tough guy
cop.</P>
<P>What One Tough Cop lacks is originality. This film offers nothing
new. Nothing that you can't get from any cop film. It screams Sidney
Lumet all over the place, perhaps because it was produced by Marty and
Michael Bregman, producers of Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon and
Serpico. But even the masterful Sidney would not have been able to
make One Tough Cop into a good film. Too much else is lacking.</P>
<P>I also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on
in the picture, something that I almost never notice. But once I saw
that, I had it in the back of my mind every time I saw a medium or
long shot. At times, I was hoping to see it.</P>
<P>One Tough Cop isn't laughable, nor is it a terrible film, but it just
isn't unique. It is a classic example of a film that didn't need to be
made. But one thing is for sure, it could really use a better title.</P>
<PRE>* 1/2 out of * * * * stars.
