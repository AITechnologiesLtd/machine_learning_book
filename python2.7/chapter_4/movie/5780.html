<P>     Last seen making trashy vampire movies, Francis Ford Coppola
directs this low-powered, light-hearted drama about a boy with the body
of an adult.  Sound familiar?  This time the magic is medical:  an
infant who is growing at four times the rate of normal.  Cut ahead to
age ten and Jack Powell, played by Robin Williams, looks like your
average forty-year-old adult.  (Or, with those hairy arms, your average
forty-year-old lumberjack.) Jack is a boy in a suburban bubble.  He's
tutored at home, his mom doesn't work, and he's given everything he
wants, *except* the chance to play with kids his own age.  So what
happens?  Jack Goes to School, where he experiences a bunch of new
things, from alienation to acceptance to, finally, awareness about
himself and his condition.</P>
<P>     Though ultimately unsuccessful as a message movie-- the moral of
the story is...  people get old?  Well, duh-- JACK is endearing enough.
And entirely recommendable.  Given plenty of room to act his age, Robin
Williams delivers a performance that is warm, funny, and far from
ingratiating.  No Oscar baiting here; not in a movie featuring such
frivolity as fart lighting.  (Suggested story idea for CHAIN REACTION 2:
Keanu Reeves spends two hours fleeing his own flatulence.  Sorry.) The
pokey pacing, however, makes for a bit of a long sit.  As does the
occasionally gushing sentiment and the ever-dawning realization that the
story isn't going anywhere in particular.  Except, perhaps, as fodder
for the next Mel Brooks spoof.  (Suggested title: LARGE.) With strong
supporting work from Bill Cosby, Fran Drescher, and Michael McKean.</P>
