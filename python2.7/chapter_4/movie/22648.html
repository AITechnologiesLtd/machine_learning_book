<P>   The 1940s have often been considered a more innocent
age than our own, but of course those were years of global
disaster.  World War II, the most cataclysmic of all conflicts,
caused the deaths of at least a half million Americans, with
the Holocaust forming the backdrop as the most devastating
event of the century, if not of all time.</P>
<P>   Ironically, though, for those who stayed at home protected
by the two oceans, the forties was a period made for Norman
Rockwell's paintings of a bucolic America, one in which a
single breadwinner was enough to support a family in decent
comfort allowing parents to spend Sundays watching the little
ones play Little League ball in the clean, country air. 
Segregation of the races was a fact of life that seemed to be
endured in the south by those kept down by racial laws, and
small-time harmony was taken for granted.  Such is the ideal
time for dog stories, of which the great "Lassie Come Home"-
-like Babe Ruth's home run record--seemed unbeatable (and
still is).</P>
<P>   Jay Russell's new period piece, "My Dog Skip," features a
Jack Russell terrier (actually six were used in the movie) who
is not only a joy to watch but who acts principally as a
catalyst to bring a shy nine-year-old boy into well-adjusted
young adulthood.  Based on Willie Morris's actual memoirs as
a young lad in Yazoo, Mississippi and filmed on location in
Yazoo and other spots in the state that appear untouched by
time, "My Dog Skip" is made for the kids but will please those
old enough to remember that tokens of life during a simpler
time.  Television was not to enter American homes for
another few years, and a nine-year-old did not call his
buddies on a cell phone to arrange a meeting.  Dog leashes
appeared to be as rare as a lock on the front door and
canines of all sizes wandered about the sylvan hamlets as
though they were furry people out for a stroll--occasionally
dropping into the local butcher shops to pick up a slice of
bologna.  It's no wonder that Willie Morris, who at the age of
nineteen left Yazoo to attend Oxford University on
scholarship and become the youngest editor ever at Harper's
magazine, returned to his roots some years before dying in
1999 at the age of 64.</P>
<P>   Willie (Frankie Muniz), a kid showing off the most
expressive eyes since Jim Carrey's imitation of Andy
Kaufman in "Man on the Moon," is an outsider.  An only child
where five kids per family was the norm, he was not good at
sports, and his shyness led only to his being bullied by a
gang of three led by Big Boy Wilkinson (Bradley Coryell). 
Unable to approach the prettiest girl in town, Rivers
Applewhite (Caitlin Wachs), he could have gone through life
as a drudge in some office--unloved, unsung, unknown--had
his mother (Diane Lane) not presented him with a Jack
Russell Terrier for his birthday.  Though Willie father, Jack
(Kevin Bacon) did not approve (for unconvincing reasons),
the overprotective dad--who lost a leg in the Spanish Civil
War--relents.</P>
<P>   In a movie which wisely uses the book simply as a take-off
point for key steps in Willie's rites of passage, we see the lad
lose some regard for his ball-playing hero, Dink (Luke
Wilson), who went AWOL from his army outfit while gaining
the respect of the bully boys and the affection of the adorable
Caitlin.  Not surprisingly, it is the furry little creature who
brings him out of his funk--romping about the town, leaping
gaily on trees, chasing his tail, and in the picture's iconic
moment, figuring a way to leap onto the toilet seat to fetch a
drink.</P>
<P>   No dog person can sit through this homespun, relaxed
picture without shedding a tear as poor Skip is hit with a
shovel by a couple of (cartoonish) moonshiners, his life
hanging in the balance in the vet's office as the tearful Willie
says silent prayers for his canine friend on the operating
table.  The charming, largely unpretentious, and thoroughly
sweet movie is marred only by Harry Connick Jr's incessant
and affected narration, not unlike the pseudo-philosophic
nonsense on the soundtrack of "The Thin Red Line."  Surely
scripter Gail Gilchriest could have fashioned some dialogue
to make this rendering wholly unnecessary.  </P>
<P>Rated PG.  Running Time: 90 minutes.  (C) 2000
