<PRE>                                GROUNDHOG DAY
                       A film review by Lon Ponschock
                        Copyright 1993 Lon Ponschock</PRE>
<P>     The premise of GROUNDHOG DAY is well-known by now: Bill Murray
finds himself living over the same day many times and the film recounts
how he takes what he knows from the previous day (the *same* day) and
applies it anew.</P>
<P>     As the film unfolds, we are drawn into this world of the same day
beginning with the same tune on the radio and the same remarks from the
radio personnel, the same photo shoot of the Groundhog Day celebration,
and the same snowstorm etc.  We follow Murray along as he learns more
and more about his surroundings and of the events of that particular
day.  I will not provide any spoilers for the various comic routines to
which  this premise gives rise for those who wish to see the film.</P>
<P>     I will only ask a question:  What would you do if you could live
the same day over and over and learn from each experience?</P>
<P>     GROUNDHOG DAY is a romance.  Bill Murray's object of affection is
his female producer played by Andie McDowell.  I'm not giving anything
away by saying that it has a 'happy' ending.  I didn't run into anyone
with any grumbles about the film when I saw it or in reviews or anywhere
else about this fact.</P>
<PRE>     It was only after I thought about it for a while that something
struck me.</PRE>
<P>     Before I get to that, let me say that I always try to look for what
a particular work is saying about the culture ... how it gets made and
why.  What need does it fulfill?  And I came up with this:</P>
<P>     GROUNDHOG DAY is a fantasy fulfillment (for men in this case) of
the need to *control* and *manipulate*.  The day is played over until
the *manipulation* achieves its desired goal, then the day is over and
life goes on.</P>
<P>     What has come out from the professional press and the Usenet
reviewers has been nearly uniform: The director Harold Ramis is
applauded for his ability to shoot the same day again and again without
allowing the repetition to become boring.  He provides enough detail on
each ensuing day to hold the audience's interest.</P>
<P>   But how would *you* like to be Andie McDowell in this scenario?  All
of her buttons get pushed until she responds in *exactly* the right way
and our story ends.</P>
<P>     I want to beg off of being some kind of Women's Rights apostle
here.  But try the shoe on for size and see how you would feel if you
were put through the same drill.  If you *knew* that you were being
manipulated, how would you react?  Well, I suppose there could be a
sequel called GROUNDHOG DAY II: THE WRATH OF ANDIE, but somehow I just
don't see that happening.</P>
<P>     GROUNDHOG DAY is cleverly crafted and nicely edited and contains
many good performances.  If you are a fan of the Sunday night comedy
shows on the Fox television network, you will see quite few familiar
faces including Ken Hudson Campbell of "Herman's Head," Chris Elliot and
Brian Doyle Murray from "Get A Life," and an actress whose name I can't
remember from the short-lived "Woops!"</P>
<P>     As usual, if I am caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow any
knowledge of my actions.  :-)</P>
