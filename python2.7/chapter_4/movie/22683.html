<P>Befitting of its picturesque name, SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS sure is pretty
to watch.  But it doesn't take long to realize that the film moves with
the same plodding pace as a man trying to trudge uphill along an unplowed
street following a blizzard.  Exquisitely beautiful but excruciatingly
slow sums up Scott Hicks' (SHINE) latest endeavor.</P>
<P>The film takes a look at stateside Japanese-American relations during the
time of the Second World War.  Set in the scenic Pacific Northwest, SNOW
FALLING ON CEDARS centers around a murder trial where American-born Kazuo
Miyamoto (Rick Yune in his film debut) is accused of murdering his boyhood
friend, an American fisherman.</P>
<P>Covering the trial is Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke, GATTICA), a young
newspaperman for the small community on San Piedro Island.  As we see in a
series of flashbacks, Ishmael has a number of conflicting emotions at
work.  Most importantly, the defendant's wife, Hatsue (Youki Kudoh,
MYSTERY TRAIN) was Ishmael's secret childhood sweetheart in a severed
relationship which was never reconciled.  At least, not as far as Ishmael
was concerned.</P>
<P>Secondly, there's the memory of his father (Sam Shepard, SAFE PASSAGE),
also a newspaperman who had the conviction to take an unpopular stand
against the injustice being carried out via the internment of
Japanese-American citizens during the 1940's.  This earned Ishmael's
father the respect of the Japanese community and has given Ishmael some
mighty big shoes to fill.  The tension, what little there is, comes from
our wondering whether Ishmael will even try.</P>
<P>Based upon the award winning novel by David Guterson, the screenplay (Ron
Bass, ENTRAPMENT and Scott Hicks, SHINE) takes a non-lineal approach to
telling its story, jumping from decade to decade, from prewar to postwar
to finally, in the war.   While this can often be an effective device,
here it serves to distance us from the characters instead of drawing us
into them.  Instead of revealing more about the characters' lives, each
flashback merely adds another layer onto them, like a fresh snow will add
a pristine blanket to a rural landscape.</P>
<P>Mr. Hawke underplays his character and his conflicting emotions almost to
the point that we will be excused for thinking that he didn't have any.
Whether mooning  or pining away for his "forbidden love" of Hatsue, most
of his anguish is internalized and unexpressed.</P>
<P>Ms. Kudoh is just as enigmatic, leaving Hatsue's emotional life to be
displayed by the actress who played the character as a young girl.  In
fact, we gain more insight into Ishmael and Hatsue from the fine work done
by young Reeve Carney and Ann Suzuki who play the same characters as
children than we do from their adult counterparts.</P>
<P>Max Von Sydow (WHAT DREAMS MAY COME) as Kazuo's defense attorney,
provides support in what is a relatively minor role as does Sam Shepard as
the principled newspaperman and father to Ishmael.</P>
<P>Taking a stand by publicly denouncing the government's mistreatment of
the Japanese-American community who lived on San Piedro Island was not
without a price.  Ishmael's father was scorned, his paper lost
subscribers, and his family was threatened with physical harm.  That type
of reaction is one which we conceivably may experience in our own lives
whenever we choose to stand upon the truth of God's Word.  God's Word
prepares those who choose to follows Its teachings by letting us know what
to expect from those with opposing views:</P>
<P>"Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you."  1 John 3:13 [KJV]</P>
<P>"I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they
are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."  John 17:14 [KJV]</P>
<P>Taking a stand because it is the right thing to do is oftentimes hard
because we know that it may make us unpopular for a time.  What we should
remember is that it also makes us well-pleasing in God's sight.  And
ultimately, it is for Him we live.</P>
