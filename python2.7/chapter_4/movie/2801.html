<PRE>                             NATURAL BORN KILLERS
                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1994 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     No matter what you think of the content of his films, it is hard
to deny Oliver Stone is one of the most innovative mainstream
filmmakers in Hollywood.  Few directors are as consistently willing to
take major chances.  With NATURAL BORN KILLERS, he has created a film
that is unlike any other movie ever made.  Some people are going to
absolutely love the film and others are going to absolutely hate it.
Far more are going to be left exhausted, bewildered, and generally
undecided about whether or not it worked.  I fit into the latter
category.</P>
<P>     The first half of this mostly plotless film is a warped road
picture as we follow mass-murderers Mickey and Mallory Knox (played by
Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis) as they go on a rampage committing
one violent murder after another.  About half-way through, Mickey and
Mallory are captured at which point this turns into a bizarre prison
film.  Much of the action in the last half revolves around a
unscrupulous reporter (played by Robert Downey Jr.) who will do pretty
much anything for a prison interview with Mickey, a borderline crazy
prison warden (played by Tommy Lee Jones), and the corrupt police
detective (played by Tom Sizemore) who captured Mickey and Mallory.</P>
<P>     All of these characters are written and played so completely over
the top that they are essentially live-action cartoons.  Very little
effort is expended trying to develop any motivation for the behavior of
the characters.  Other than a couple very brief flashes of childhood
memory, nothing is told about Mickey's background.  An early flashback
sequence does give us a little background into Mallory's childhood, but
it is one of the most bizarre movie sequences in recent memory.  The
whole thing is shot like a TV sitcom (including a laugh track) with her
abusive father played by Rodney Dangerfield and her weak mother played
by Edie McClurg.  Dangerfield and McClurg play the characters like
typical sitcom parents, except for Dangerfield's occasional tendency to
verbally, physically, and sexually abuse his daughter.</P>
<P>     The whole movie is so intensely stylized and throws so many
cinematic tricks at us that this flashback sequence doesn't even seem
particularly out of place.  In fact, I'm not sure that much of
*anything* could seem out of place in this movie.  The audio/visual
style of this movie is virtually impossible to describe.  It basically
has to be seen to be believed.  Stone uses virtually every conceivable
type of film stock and photography, even throwing in bits of animation
on occasion.  Scenes constantly switch from color to black and white
and from 8mm to 16mm to 35mm.  The viewer is rarely given the
opportunity to begin to digest an image before something completely
different is up on the screen.  The overall result is a sensation of
constant chaos, but it is also virtually impossible to take your eyes
off the screen.  It is simultaneously exhausting and exhilarating.</P>
<P>     It all may seem virtually random on first glance, but in truth I
suspect that every frame of this film is carefully crafted and
deliberate.  This is definitely a film that primarily came together in
the editing room.  The whole movie is full of rapid cuts and all kinds
of abstract imagery.  Special effects are often used to combine
seemingly unrelated images on the screen all at once.  Oliver Stone has
never been known for subtlety and much of the symbolism here is
extremely obvious.  In particular, the frequent use of snakes is rather
unsubtle.  Still, this film is a major achievement in cinema editing
and if this film fails to win the "Best Editing" Oscar, then the
Academy simply isn't paying attention.</P>
<P>     The actors all seem to be given little restraints on their
performances.  Harrelson, Lewis, and Jones are essentially playing
their standard screen personas here, but in a highly exaggerated
manner.  Harrelson plays Mickey as if Woody from "Cheers" finally
snapped and became violent.  This is the dark side of the simple-minded
hick that he has been playing for years.  Lewis plays another of her
sweet-looking oddballs.  She is petite and soft-spoken, making it all
the more shocking when she suddenly becomes violent.  Finally, Tommy
Lee Jones has seemed to constantly be on the verge of going
out-of-control in his last few roles.  This time, he is finally allowed
to cross that line.  As you might expect, he is a lot of fun to watch.</P>
<P>     Robert Downey Jr. gives the most entertaining performance in the
film as the reporter.  His character is the most fully formed in the
film and is generally the only one that changes much in the film
(although not necessarily for the better).  Most importantly, he is
given most of the best lines in the film which he delivers with a great
deal of finesse.  On top of all that, he plays the character with a very
convincing Australian accent (although I never was quite sure *why*).</P>
<P>     One significant way in which this movie differs from Stone's past
work is the fact that it is primarily done as satire.  The film
actually is very funny, although much of the laughter is nervous
laughter.  Sometimes you may even feel slightly guilty about what you
are laughing at.  The script contains quite a bit of witty dialog, most
of which is given to Robert Downey Jr.</P>
<P>     Much has been made about the amount of violence in this film.  It
certainly *is* an incredibly violent film and is very much deserving of
its R rating.  Much of the violence is really more implied than
explicit, though, and the rapid editing means that the violent acts
(and their results) are never really on the screen long.  I suspect
that a lot of people will come away from this film thinking that it was
a lot more graphic than it really is.  Still, this is probably not a
movie for the extremely squeamish.</P>
<P>     The one big question that may remain with many viewers after
seeing this movie is what the film is really trying to say.  While the
two films couldn't be more different in content, I suspect that the
reactions to this film may be similar to some of the reactions people
have had to FORREST GUMP.  Like that film, NATURAL BORN KILLERS has a
relatively simple and obvious message on the surface.  This basic
message is about the fact that the media tends to glorify violence and
make celebrities out of criminals.  Unfortunately, the film really has
little of substance to say on this matter.  As a result, many may find
the movie to be shallow.  On the other hand, some people may read
meanings into the film that other people simply don't see.  I suspect
that many people will be left with feelings that are so abstract that
they are virtually impossible to articulate.  I'm left with the strong
feeling that there is a lot more to this movie than meets the eye, but
I really don't know how I can sufficiently explain that fact to someone
else (particularly if they don't see it themselves).</P>
<P>     NATURAL BORN KILLERS is one of the most audacious and original
films to come along in a long time.  It is a two-hour assault on the
senses which will likely leave audiences simultaneously dazzled and
confused.  It is an impressive film that is likely going to generate a
ton of varied reactions and debate.</P>
