<PRE>                               TURBULENCE
                     A film review by Chuck Dowling
                      Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Turbulence (1997) *1/2 out of ***** - Cast: Ray Liotta, Lauren Holly, Ben
Cross, Hector Elizondo, Rachel Ticotin, Catherine Hicks, J. Kenneth
Campbell. Written by: Jonathan Brett, Steven E. De Souza and John Herzfeld.
Directed by: Robert Butler. Running Time: 100 minutes.</P>
<P>Say, tell me if you've seen this before: a crisis on-board a commercial
airliner causes a stewardess to have to fly and land the plane herself.
Airport '97 anyone?</P>
<P>Ray Liotta is a psychotic serial killer being transported from New York to
California on Christmas Eve.  Amazingly, on what would seemingly be a busy
day of travel on one of the most flown routes, only about six other
passengers are on the flight.  Anyway, they take off, Liotta escapes and
kills all the police and the pilots, and stewardess Lauren Holly locks
herself in the cockpit to fly the plane.  The story is beyond routine, the
script is
embarrassing (at one point, this jumbo jet is flying completely upside
down), the characters are worthless, and the performances are annoying.
Surprisingly, co-writer Steven E. De Souza actually wrote the first two "Die
Hard" movies!</P>
<P>"Turbulence" takes place at Christmas time, yet the film was released a few
days AFTER the holidays.  Brilliant marketing, as no one cares about anything
having to do with Christmas after December 26th.  The studio knew they had
a bomb, and purposely dumped it out when the fewest number of people would
see it. [R]</P>
