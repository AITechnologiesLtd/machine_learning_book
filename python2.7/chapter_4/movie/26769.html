<PRE>"Charlie's Angels" - Girls Just Wanna Have Fun (And
You Will Too)
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Incredibly, Hollywood has the courage to create yet
again another feature-length film based on a classic
TV show.  You may remember a recent handful of similar
attempts that have made disastrous transitions from
the small screen to the silver screen.  These
forgettable projects included "The Avengers," "The Mod
Squad," and "Shaft."  Received poorly by audiences and
critics alike, all were money-losing debacles.  </P>
<P>This time around, the latest attempt is the
resurrection of "Charlie's Angels," the jiggly and
feathery-haired 70's detective show.  Would this
update suffer the same fate as those other fiascoes? 
The project certainly had many studio executives
scratching their heads in doubt as the film underwent
massive rewrites and last-minute reshoots.  Gossip
also surfaced that there were severe creative
differences among the stars, and in particular,
between Lucy Liu (who plays Alex, the techno-whiz
Angel) and Bill Murray (who plays Bosley, Charlie's
avuncular assistant).  Meanwhile, production costs
skyrocketed to $90 million while people began to
wonder about the viability of a film that was taken
from a show that had scripts that were so light. 
Original Angel, Kate Jackson, once mused that "it
would take a week to get to the floor if you dropped
it from the ceiling."</P>
<P>Happily, reports of its demise are greatly
exaggerated.  The new "Charlie's Angels," as it turns
out, is an unabashed romp.  It's a fine mix of action,
camp and self-parody.  I'm surprised to say this, but
this is the most fun that I've had at the movies in
weeks!</P>
<P>If you've seen the television show, then you're
familiar with the setup.  Three beautiful women (Drew
Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu) work together
as an elite trio of detectives who receive their
assignment over speakerphone from the disembodied
voice of Charlie (spoken, as in the original show, by
Baritone-voiced John Forsythe).  Of course, they're
still glamorous and great to look at.  But these new
Angels have powered up.  They aren't shy about
employing their saucy feminine wiles.  Their
impressive skill sets range widely from speaking
Japanese to Indy Car racing.  And, thanks to
Matrix-like effects, they can really kick some butt.</P>
<P>Their latest case involves thwarting a scheme that
threatens to end privacy.  The film's elements borrow
heavily from any number of James Bond films.  There
are high-tech gadgets, a notable henchman (a silent,
sword-wielding, thin man played by Crispin Glover), a
host of enjoyable action sequences and a final
showdown at the villain's stronghold.  </P>
<P>While the plot is serviceable, the film is more about
flash, style, and good-looking babes.  The filmmakers
know that this isn't matter to be taken seriously. 
Consequently, they have great fun with this film. 
Guest stars include comedic lightweights Luke Wilson,
Matthew Perry and Tom Green as the Angels' love
interests.  Diaz energetically wiggles her booty while
dancing on Soul Train as Sir Mix-A-Lot's anthem, "I
Like Big Butts," plays in the background.  Barrymore
enjoys a victory moonwalk after dispatching a group of
thugs.  Liu dons a dominatrix outfit as she trains a
group of gawking, bespectacled engineers.  What's not
to like?  Completely watchable, this is the kind of
playful material that attracts people to magazines
like Maxim or FHM.  For this Maxim-reading guy,
"Charlie's Angels" was more entertaining than I ever
thought possible.</P>
