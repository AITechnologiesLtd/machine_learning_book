<P>A Review by Akiva Gottlieb
You know it's the year 2000 when the most significant
form of teenage musical rebellion involves the embrace
of technology and, dare I say, materialism. `Better
Living Through Circuitry' is the perfect title for the
first film to document rave culture, because it
inadvertently hints at why the scene may have a shelf
life. As long as there are new advances in the digital
world, the music will keep bumpin', the drugs will
keep floating, and the newest breed of DJ's will
continue to preach their gospel through the language
of music. Rave, the biggest underground party scene in
the world, has moved above ground, and no one is quite
sure when the `comedown' will begin.</P>
<P>Jon Reiss' `Better Living Through Circuitry' is an
insightful commercial for rave culture; a collection
of interviews with major stars of the rave world, some
of whom (Moby, Crystal Method) have gone on to become
major international bestsellers. Reiss also talks to
kids in the scene, who explain how their subculture is
about `rebelling against being pissed off.' How could
any parent disapprove?</P>
<P>Well, it takes a while for the film to get into the
most controversial aspect of the all-night rave
parties; the incessant use of hallucinogenic drugs.
Ecstasy, a `happy' drug, is the most common choice
among ravers. Thankfully, `Circuitry' gives a clear
anti-drug message, with party kids claiming that the
music and energy of a rave is enough to bring on
euphoria.</P>
<P>Rave culture is so powerful that, to some, it is
almost a religious experience. One look at the faces
of the folks dancing the night away and it is clear
that it's about more than just the music. The bouncing
beats and electronically charged rhythm provide an
ironic helping of soul food for today's disaffected
youth. It's not just the `happy drug' that puts these
kids in a trance.</P>
<P>`Better Living Through Circuitry' is directed with a
style that emulates the `empowerment through
technology' theme of rave culture. `Circuitry' was
filmed with a small Sony VX1000 digital video camera,
which director Jon Reiss took into raves in a
backpack. All post-production was performed using
various programs on a Power Macintosh computer.</P>
<P>`Better Living Through Circuitry' is being released on
the heels of the criminally under-seen rave flick
`Human Traffic', and is an effective `digital odyssey'
which adds new understanding to my limited knowledge
of the booming underground youth culture. The film
doesn't give the viewer the rush that one could get at
a rave, but Reiss' camera takes you deeper into the
lifestyle than you may ever want to be.</P>
