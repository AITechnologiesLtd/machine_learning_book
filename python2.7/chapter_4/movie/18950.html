<PRE>Tarzan
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>** (out of 4) I went to TARZAN hoping to hate it. I am generally cynical
about Disney movies, and I hoped I could pull a "Mr. Cranky."</P>
<P>I still won't say I liked TARZAN, but I liked parts of it, and on the
whole I couldn't really fault it, given the genre. But it never wowed me
and won me over. I never felt sheepish for having doubted Disney, as I
did with A BUG'S LIFE.</P>
<P>Plotwise, TARZAN is a fairly traditional retelling. A shipwrecked couple
are killed and their infant son is adopted by gorillas. The boy grows up
never knowing why he looks different from his friends, never knowing
about human beings.</P>
<P>One day, after Tarzan (voiced by Tony Goldwyn) has grown, he hears a
loud bang in the distance. It is a party of people. A ridiculous-looking
naturalist (Nigel Hawthorne), his daughter Jane (Minnie Driver), and
their trophy-hunting bodyguard Clayton (Brian Blessed) are looking for
gorillas.  </P>
<P>After their first encounter, Tarzan and Jane start hanging around
together (ouch, sorry). Meanwhile, the goofy professor Porter and the
slippery villain try to get Tarzan to say where the gorilla nesting site
is, the prof so he can study them, the bodyguard so he can cage them and
sell them.</P>
<P>As with other recent Disney cartoons, this one is a musical. Phil
Collins belts out the pop hits over montages of Tarzan "skating" down
tree branches. (The music is always over a montage because the cast
members don't perform their own songs. For example, Tarzan's "mother"
starts the first few bars of a lullaby, then Collins takes over the
soundtrack and the visuals shift into MTV mode.) None of the songs are
too saccharine, and there's even one that's fairly catchy -- "Trashing
the Camp."</P>
<P>Another trademark of Disney cartoons is that they always manage to top
themselves when it comes to technical innovation. First it was the
spinning ballroom shot in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Then it was the focus
pulls on THE LION KING. In TARZAN, the trick is "hand-held" camera.</P>
<P>Early in the film a leopard is chasing Tarzan's adoptive mother. The
scene happens very quickly anyway, and the "camera" hops around trying
to follow the action as though the virtual camera operator had legs.
(The same technique is repeated later in the movie.) So why create this
effect? Because they can? Because it hasn't been done before? To get
film nerds like me to say "whoa"? Whatever the reason, it's a neat
gimmick, even if it's gratuitous.</P>
<P>That brings me to a fairly big complaint about the movie. Because of the
animators' acute technophilia, TARZAN is stylistically incoherent.
Technical innovation may be neat, but that alone shouldn't be reason
enough to include it in a movie.</P>
<P>The characters in TARZAN are all traditional-looking animated creatures.
They could have been drawn for THE JUNGLE BOOK forty years ago. But the
setting they inhabit has become hyperrealistic. With computer-modeled
jungles, rivers, sunlight and shadows, it has become hard to tell for
sure where the cartoon ends and "reality" begins -- until you change
your focus to the cartoon apes in the foreground.</P>
<P>This inconsistency is a stylistic mistake. It keeps the audience from
understanding and getting into the animated world. The characters and
settings ARE animated separately, but they shouldn't look that way. Even
assuming there were a good reason to mix two such disparate styles,
Professor Porter's character introduces a third style that's even
further out of place.</P>
<P>Set in the "real" jungle, Tarzan was animated with sharp, heroic lines,
as was Jane. Clayton's figure was a bit more exaggerated, but as the
villain, it was excusable. But professor Porter's form was neither
realistic nor heroic. He was so flat, round, silly, and, well,
cartoonish, that he would have fit in better with Mickey Mouse and
Donald Duck. Each style might work on its own, but to ignore how they
integrate is a mistake.</P>
<P>I have one more complaint, and to discuss it, I'll have to give away the
ending. (That's okay, though. If you're familiar with the Disney
formula, you already know what the ending is.) </P>
<P>The kid-movie justice system is insane.</P>
<P>My sister said it best: her daughter was telling her about a movie that
had a happy ending because the bad guy died at the end. Later, to me, my
sister was incredulous. "It's a HAPPY ending because someone you don't
like is DEAD? What kind of message is that?"</P>
<P>Having observed this childish system of justice in movies ranging from
TARZAN and A BUG'S LIFE (rated G) to CON AIR and THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE
CRADLE (rated R), I've discovered a few other "rules." The good guys
never do their own dirty work. The bad guy always dies because of his
fatal flaw, usually greed, rabid perseverence, and/or pure, inhuman
evilness. The more gruesome, sudden, and irreversible the death, the
better. The Greeks had DEUS EX MACHINA endings. We have MORTIS EX
FORMULA endings.</P>
<P>Ideally, we'd be teaching our kids to outwit their oppressors, not to
hope for luck to bring their deaths. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen
very often in movies. (A noteworthy exception is last year's "Ever
After," which I strongly recommend.) No wonder we are a nation in love
with the death penalty, where bad guys die without the rest of us
getting blood on our hands.</P>
<P>Back to TARZAN, I'm probably being too hard on this movie, when my real
complaint is with the formula. Still, I wouldn't say I liked it, and I'd
even go so far as to say that it doesn't quite measure up to other
Disney offerings. I'm sure those of you with younger kids would enjoy an
afternoon at TARZAN. But the rest of us could probably skip it.</P>
