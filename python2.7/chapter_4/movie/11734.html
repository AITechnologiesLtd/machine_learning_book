<P>   Not all propositions are indecent proposals, but cinema
today has less use than ever for affairs freely entered
between consenting adults, the sorts of liaisons that do not
hurt anyone.  In "Indecent Proposal" (1993) Robert Redford
proposed to give one million dollars for a night to remember
with Demi Moore and the audience wondered why HE would
have to pay HER.  In "The Proposition," the issue--one which
would be considered vulgar by some, respectable by
others--is more complex and with a better script could have
been more involving.  Arthur Barret (William Hurt), a
fabulously wealthy lawyer, is sterile, unable to present the
wife he adores, Eleanor (Madeleine Stowe) with the child she
so intensely craves.  Through an intermediary, Hannibal
Thurman (Robert Loggia), Arthur hires a bright young stud,
Roger Martin (Neil Patrick Harris), offering $25,000 if he
would spend a night with his wife so that she would have
what she so desperately wants.  Would you believe that he at
first refuses, even after seeing the beautiful Eleanor?  But
hormones triumph over ethics, and when the youthful Harvard
graduate falls in love with his conquest in just one night
threatening to expose his benefactor for the pimp he
considers him to be, the boy must be eliminated.</P>
<P>   "The Proposition" is an uneasy mix of soap opera and
feminism with an occasional burst of clever humor.  Situated
in the Boston of 1935, the tale is told in flashback by Father
Michael McKinnon (Kenneth Branagh), whose role in the
melodramatic yarn is not entirely priestly.  In typical potboiler
mode, the story focuses on the growing affection between
Eleanor and the priest who turns out to be the nephew of the
affluent Arthur, a man who entered the priesthood to get back
at his father--who was materialistic almost to the point of
treason.  Suggesting Kennedy-style with specific reference to
Joseph Kennedy, Lesli Linka Glatter's production displays the
pomp and palatial splendor of the Barret estate, complete with
a head servant, Syril (Blythe Danner), who is dressed as
elegantly as the woman of the house and who has more than
employee-employer feelings for her boss, adding to the class
politics of the drama.</P>
<P>   For feminist resonance, Rick Ramage's screenplay portrays
Eleanor as a novelist in the style of Virginia Woolf, a woman
who despite her love for her husband has a separate room--
all the more convenient for both the welcome and the
unwelcome trysts.  Despite some droll moments, particularly
in the lovemaking scene between the callow Roger and the
sophisticated and understanding beauty, the performers take
themselves entirely too seriously.  Though he hired the young
man to perform studly services, Barret conspicuously scowls
from his car at the Don Juan has created and later admits
that he hated the boy.  Even worse, Father Michael is
insufferably solemn throughout, displaying his displeasure at
the follies of moneyed aristocrats, particularly when they
invest their money in Germany at a time that Americans are
out of work in appalling numbers.  Despite his rugged good
looks, you wonder how Eleanor could become so animated
over this priggish man of the cloth whose hormones do battle
with his oath to the church, the victor never in doubt.</P>
<P>   David Brisbin's production design is impressive, featuring
the stately autos of the 1930s and Anna B. Sheppard's
costume design seems right on the money.  But the drama
becomes too fogged by suds to offer the clarity of a well-
developed fable.  Rated R.  Running time: 114 minutes.  (C)
