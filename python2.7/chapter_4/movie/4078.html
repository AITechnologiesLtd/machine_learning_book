<PRE>                           THE LAST ACTION HERO
                  A film review by Anna G. McDougald
                   Copyright 1995 Anna G. McDougald</PRE>
<P>     When a theatre owner assures a film fan that there are far worse
things than movies in this world, and that "Politicians are twice as
bad as any of the rest"--you wonder just who he is really speaking
for.</P>
<P>     John McTiernan's LAST ACTION HERO seems, at times, a furious
manifesto crafted specifically to answer official posturings on "movie
violence." The roster of stars McTiernan has recruited for cameo
appearances in this film would suggest his concerns are fairly
widespread.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, it debuted at a time when the words ACTION and
HERO, together, were as fondly received as a leper's warning-bell.
(Just how the Tutsis, Yugoslavs and Khmer Rouge learned to commit the
most awful outrages without help from Steven Segal remains a mystery!)</P>
<P>     Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) is a young man any parent would
happily claim.  Neat, attentive, and properly respectful toward
policemen and old folks, he finds cheerful solace in the campy "Jack
Slater" movies, one of which his friend Nick (Robert Prosky) graciously
premieres after presenting Danny him with a "magic ticket."</P>
<P>     Danny is a Director's dream as well; corny dialogue and hokey
effects don't bother him at all, if they're carried off with wit and
style.  As the the on-screen action starts to heats up, the ticket
"activates" itself--and Danny is catapulted directly to his hero's
side.</P>
<P>     Unmoved by steadily escalating explosions, artillery barrages, and
music blasts, Danny desperately tries to convince Jack Slater (Arnold
Schwarzenegger, in a lovely bit of self-mockery) that this *is* after
all, "just a movie."  (It's amusing to note just who shows "real"
intelligence here, and who has trouble with the concept!)</P>
<P>     Before Danny can succeed in making Jack aware of the facts, the
ticket activates itself again, this time in reverse, and expels the
two into the "real" world as it falls into the hands of master-criminal
Benedict (Charles Dance).</P>
<P>     We are battered by what approaches cinematic overkill as Jack
finds himself facing his old Nemesis (made corporeal as well with
Benedict's help), and Danny frantically searches Nick's theatre for the
other half of the ticket.  Only by reclaiming it can Danny prevent the
unleashing of even nastier monsters and assure Jack passage back to a
world where the worst of wound is simply an inconvenience.</P>
<P>     Was there a conspiracy in place to discredit this film, and its
Director, from the very start?  Granted, LAST ACTION HERO has plenty of
flaws--length, and excessive self-reference being merely two.  But what
it says about movies of this genre must strike certain people as being
totally unacceptable.</P>
<P>     The notion that children can be quite capable of sorting fact from
fantasy, that our fictional heros may be the only ones who never let us
down, and that every movie ticket is "magic" in that it grants us
access to worlds we could never otherwise visit, where we may view Evil
in any number of guises while retaining the power to leave it exactly
where it is--these, to some, are truly "dangerous" ideas.</P>
<P>     Perhaps McTiernan tried a little too hard to make his point.
Perhaps he let his penchant for irony at times get the upper hand.  But
if this is failure, it counts as a noble one.  For, how else can you
even begin to argue with people who won't believe it's "just a movie"?</P>
