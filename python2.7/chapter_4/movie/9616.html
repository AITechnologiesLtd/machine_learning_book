<PRE>The Peacemaker
A review by David Wilcock
(C)1997 David Wilcock </PRE>
<P>Although it's another action flick, this film will be looked at more
closely than others. Why? Because it's the first film from Steven
Spielbergs new production company, Dreamworks SKG. Hopefully, not all
their films will be like this one.  A nuclear missile has been
'stolen' by a terrorist group, and it's up to Clooney and Kidman to
stop the nutty terroists from setting it off in New York. It basically
involves them running around exotic locations, tracking down the
terrorists. There's some good action sequences in there, but this film
is decidely average.</P>
<P>The film is directed OK, and there are a few good scenes (including
one with a car hanging over a cliff) But there's nothing startingly
orinigal about it. The plot is hardly orinignal or exciting, which is
not a good start for a new studio. It's also hard to see why this film
cost $50 million to produce, as the special effects are nothing
special.</P>
<P>The performances are OK, with Clooney giving us the Clooney grin
throughout, and Kidman looking lovely, but not being able to work with
a strong character. The bad guy, however, is excellent. He's not an
outright nutter, such as Daefoe in Speed 2, but a normal, calm, and
disturbed nutter, who believes what he is doing is right. He's very
good. The direction (from a director previously from T.V's ER) is
fine, and there are some striking scenes (but not much)</P>
<P>Dosen't look too good, then, for Dreamworks so far. What they've
delivered is a sub-standard film, which will be forgotten as soon as
it's finished it's video release.  It's a shame really, this could of
been an potential Raiders of the Lost Ark. But with a dull plot,
standard acting, and average action scenes, and a rather large budget,
it's all a bit of a letdown for Spielbergs new studio. Maybe if he had
some creative input into it, it would of been better. Overall, then,
disappointing.</P>
