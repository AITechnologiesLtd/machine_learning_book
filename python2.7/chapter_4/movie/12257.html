<PRE>LES MISERABLES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Victor Hugo's famous novel, "Les Miserables," has now been made
into - count 'em - 16 different movies, and that doesn't include the
filmed version of the musical from a few years back.  What THE HOUSE OF
THE SPIRITS director Bille August is trying to say with his version of
the movie that has not been said so many times before remains unclear.
Although he assembles a strong cast to tell a powerful story, he has
trouble breathing much life into it.  Most scenes are staged strictly
by the book with only the brilliance of the source material and the
extremely handsome production raising the picture above the ordinary.</P>
<P>     Anna Asp's sets are picture postcard perfect, especially the snow
encrusted village.  Jorgen Persson's cinematography dazzles the eyes
with its lush colors.  And the romantic music by Basil Poledouris has
best seller written all over it.</P>
<P>     As the story opens, Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson) has been released
after 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread.  After being
befriended by a kindly bishop, Jean goes on to make his fortune as a
factory owner and to become the mayor of a small town.</P>
<P>     One day Inspector Javert is sent from Paris to Jean's town to be
the new prefect of police.  Javert recognizes Jean as an ex-prisoner,
and he abides no belief in criminal rehabilitation.  ("Reform is a
discarded fantasy.")  The rest of the story becomes a long
cat-and-mouse game with Javert trying to capture and reincarcerate
Jean.</P>
<P>     SHINE's Academy Award winner Geoffrey Rush, as Inspector Javert,
proves to be the film's most troubling choice.  Unlike the highly
emotive and agitated character in SHINE,  Rush makes the key role of
the story's villain into a lifeless enigma with a single facial
expression that looks like a head from Mount Rushmore.  One wonders why
the director didn't snap his fingers and ask Rush to get with the
program.</P>
<P>     Almost as unsatisfying is Uma Thuman as Fantine, the dying factory
woman with an out-of-wedlock child.  Thurman turns the character into a
mawkish cliche.</P>
<P>     Although Neeson does a good job, the only outstanding performance
comes from Claire Danes in her fairly small part as Fantine's daughter,
Cosette.  (The movie takes several large leaps in time.)  She is the
only one to demonstrate strong emotions, both tragic and romantic.
When she sticks her hand through the hole in the family's door to brush
fingertips with her lover, a revolutionary played by Hans Matheson, the
air becomes electric with her passion, proving again that filmdom's
most erotic moments can occur fully dressed.</P>
<P>     In the film's final battle sequence, complete with the killing of
small children I should warn you, the movie gets the energy so absent
from the body of the picture.  A disappointing film that can be
strangely cold and antiseptic, its wonderful story and its production
save the day in the end.  But if you don't want to see this version,
you can rent one of the others or wait a few years for the next one.</P>
<P>     LES MISERABLES runs a bit long at 2:09.  It is rated PG-13 for
violence and for some sexual content and would be fine for kids around
twelve and up.</P>
