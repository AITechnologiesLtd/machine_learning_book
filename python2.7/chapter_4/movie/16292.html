<PRE>                             RUSH HOUR 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
                     3 out of 4 for Jackie and Chris</PRE>
<P>Cast: Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, Tom Wilkinson, Elizabeth Pena.
Screenplay: Jim Kouf and Ross LaManna.
Director: Brett Ratner.</P>
<P>In RUSH HOUR, we have one of the oddest pairings of action movie heroes
since Lethal Weapon  - and it works! We have partly to thank Jackie Chan
for his gimic humour and Chris Tucker for being overtly hysterical. The
result is one of balance, when east meets west, in a fast paced, comical
action thriller which has both actors showing off what they are best at.
There have been comments that Jackie's hands and feet aren't as fast as
they used to be – give the man a break – he's forty plus! He may be
slower, but his choreography is also smoother and mature. As for Chris
Tucker, there isn't anyone to out speak him in this movie, which is just
as well, because the last thing you want is another smart mouth adding
to the cacophony of noise. Jackie is polite, sincere and nice, finely
balancing the rude, loud, manic Chris. If there was any other paring
outside these two actors, we may not have the success that is RUSH HOUR.
With a reasonable plot, fast action, humour and above all onscreen
chemistry between two unlikely co-workers – we have an assured hit on
our hands. Just watch out for the sequels in years to come, which is
likely to be far inferior to the parent.</P>
