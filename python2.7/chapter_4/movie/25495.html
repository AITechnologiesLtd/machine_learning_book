<PRE>THE NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Gosh, aren't fart jokes funny?  And if you've blown upwards of fifty 
bucks to take your family to the movies, you'll certainly want lots of 
them for your entertainment dollar.  How about flatulence so intense 
that it literally sets a restaurant on fire?  Now, that would really be 
funny.  Right?</P>
<P>Well, so apparently believes the studio which spent over seventy million 
dollars coming up with the sequel to THE NUTTY PROFESSOR starring Eddie 
Murphy.  This time called NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS, the movie 
again stars a trash-talking Eddie Murphy, playing a host of roles.  The 
only commendable part of the production is the amazing make-up effects 
that allow Murphy to look like a wide variety of obese characters.</P>
<P>The writing credits for this abomination are shared by no less than 5 
writers: Steve Oedekerk, Barry W. Blaustein, David Sheffield, Paul Weitz 
and Chris Weitz.  I'd recommend that they all hide their heads in shame.  
The movie will probably make a bundle, but, surely, they could have come 
up with more imaginative material than this smelly batch of recycled 
bathroom humor.  They even stoop to having an octogenarian mistakenly 
eat a large piece of feces.</P>
<P>This "R" movie, which is incorrectly rated PG-13, is actually written 
with dumbed-down humor that seems designed to appeal to 8-year-old boys' 
crude sensibilities.  But, the movie would certainly not be appropriate 
for anyone younger than their teenage years. Among other offensive 
scenes are those of killer turds and an animal having anal sex with a 
human.</P>
<P>Moreover, crudeness does not equal funny, as the renowned Farrelly 
brothers (THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY) demonstrated recently in ME, 
MYSELF & IRENE, a much better film than NUTTY PROFESSOR II.  At least 
the MPAA correctly rated ME, MYSELF & IRENE as an R.  Both films share 
about the same level of coarseness in their brand of attempted humor.</P>
<P>When not dispensing one disgusting joke after another, the movie follows 
a plot that has Professor Sherman Klump (Murphy) trying to rid himself 
of his nefarious alter ego, Buddy Love (Murphy).  There are plenty of 
subplots involving the rest of the fat Klump clan.  Typical of these is 
an unfunny bedroom scene between Papa Klump (Murphy) and Mama Klump 
(Murphy).  "Viagra doesn't work for me," he tells her, spurning her 
advances.  "I've been taking them like M&Ms."</P>
<P>I tried hard to think of good things about the movie other than the 
make-up.  All I can come up with is that Janet Jackson, as the 
professor's girlfriend, does have a particularly inviting smile.  
(Another would be that Murphy mumbles half of his lines, which partially 
spares us from some of the film's inanities.)  That's it.  If you're 
still dead set on wasting your money on this film, don't say I didn't 
warn you.</P>
<P>NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS runs a long 1:50.  It is officially rated 
PG-13 for "crude humor and sex-related material."  Consider it an R.  It 
would be acceptable for most teenagers, but I'd certainly advise against 
anyone seeing it.</P>
