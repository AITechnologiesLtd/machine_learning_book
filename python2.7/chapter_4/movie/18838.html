<PRE>The Apostle </PRE>
<P>Robert Duvall has been in some of the greatest movies of our time, but
never seems to get the kind of recognition afforded to Jack Nicholson
or Robert Redford. Duvall's resume contains some of the greatest
movies in history: To Kill a Mockingbird, M*A*S*H, The Godfather and
The Godfather II, Apocalypse Now, Network, Tender Mercies, The Natural
and Sling Blade. Normally, a list like that would make you a Hollywood
legend, but Duvall has never been a megastar. He is a consummate
professional, a workingman's actor.  Instead of playing Robert Duvall
in every movie, he becomes the character. He blends into the work, but
would be vitally missed if he were not there.</P>
<P>In stunning contrast to some of his most famous roles, Duvall explodes
off the screen in The Apostle. With great skill, Duvall serves as the
writer and director as well as playing a difficult character.  Duvall
portrays Sonny, a flawed southern preacher. Since he was a little boy,
Sonny had the gift of preaching the Lord's word.  Unfortunately, he is
also a deeply flawed man who has cheated on his wife and may have even
stolen some money from the church collection plate.</P>
<P>Finally, his wife (Farah Fawcett) tires of Sonny's problems. She takes
away everything he holds dear, his children and his church.  After
being removed as pastor of his small Texas church, Sonny is lost. He
turns to alcohol and begs for God to give him a sign telling him what
he should do. At his lowest point, Sonny confronts his wife, Jessie,
and her new boyfriend. This leads to a struggle where Sonny kills
Jessie's boyfriend in a fit of rage.</P>
<P>Sonny realizes what he has done and flees. After communing with the
Lord, Sonny realizes that he must right the wrongs he has committed in
life. He realizes that he must preach the word of the Lord without
straying and committing sin, so he heads to a small Louisiana town to
start a new church. Will Sonny be able to bring salvation to this
small town? Will he be able to leave his sinful past behind?</P>
<P>There are some great moments in this film. Duvall's performance is
legendary. His preaching ability could bring atheists to their
feet. He creates a montage of fantastic scenes showing Sonny preaching
to many different audiences. In one scene, Sonny and his fellow
preachers engage in a preach-off, trading the microphone and
compelling each other to new heights. Duvall effectively uses
flashbacks to show the life Sonny has led and the events that
influenced him. He also creates a beautiful scene with Sonny praying
at the crossroads after he has killed his wife's boyfriend and one
scene showing the re-birth and baptism of Sonny. We get a good sense
of the desperation his character feels after breaking one of the ten
commandments.</P>
<P>There are some problems with the movie. When Duvall was writing all
those fantastic scenes for himself, he forgot about the rest of his
cast.  He dominates every scene in the movie. The movie would have
benefited from more character development for the secondary
characters. These characters could have helped to explain more of
Sonny's past and the sins he has committed. Unfortunately, the
audience is left to theorize what he has done.</P>
<P>Specifically, two actors put in fine performances, but should have
been used more.  First, Duvall does not use Billy Bob Thornton in an
effective manner. Billy Bob is fantastic in this movie, but serves no
purpose. His character has no motivation and we don't know enough
about him to understand his anger. He just shows up from time to time
with no rhyme or reason.</P>
<P>Farrah Fawcett also does a fine job in the movie. She isn't given much
to do, but does a good job playing Sonny's frustrated and fed-up wife.</P>
<P>The Apostle is a great film for actors to study Duvall. He was
deservedly nominated for an Oscar and a Screen Actors Guild award. He
won best actor from the Independent Spirit Awards, the LA Film Critics
Association, and the National Society of Film Critics.  The
Independent Spirit Awards also rewarded Duvall by naming the film best
film of 1997 and picked him as the best director.</P>
