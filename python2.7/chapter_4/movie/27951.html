<PRE>THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE
-----------------------</PRE>
<P>Romulus Ledbetter (Samuel L. Jackson) is a homeless man who lives in a cave
in Central Park.  The former Julliard-trained pianist/composer's descent into 
madness cost him his home, wife and (now adult) child.  Now he spends his
days trying to thwart his nemesis, Cornelius Gould Stuyvesant, whom he 
believes tracks him from atop the Chrysler Building.  When Romulus finds a
frozen body in the tree outside his cave, he summons his police officer 
daughter and tries to convince her superior that the victim was murdered by
Stuyvesant in "The Caveman's Valentine."</P>
<P>Adapted from his own Edgar winning novel by George Dawes Green, "The Caveman's
Valentine" is a most unusual murder mystery.  Because the audience receives 
its point of view from Romulus, the perspective is always off kilter.  We
see Romulus' delusions, such as his estranged wife (Tamara Tunie) acting as a 
sounding board, which other characters in the film do not see.</P>
<P>Romulus has seen a message for help on a large ad for the work of David
Leppenraub (Colm Feore, "Titus"), a Mapplethorpe-like photographer who has some 
nasty rumors circulating involving torture, drugs and death.  As the victim 
was Leppenraub's last model, Rommulus switches his suspicions from Stuyvesant 
to Leppenraub, arranging to reenter society to get close to the man.</P>
<P>Director Kasi Lemmons ("Eve's Bayou") was smart to choose to work once again
with Jackson, as his acting is the most compelling aspect of the film.  He
lumbers about like a Rastafarian bear in Central Park.  Ledbetter is fearless
except when he perceives Stuyvesant's rays eminating from the Chrysler,
confident in his convictions except when he attempts to pass himself off as
the man he used to be.</P>
<P>Anthony Michael Hall ("Sixteen Candles") is the New York financier who supplies
Romulus with the trappings of his former life in exchange for party tricks.
Ann Magnuson ("Love and Sex") is Moira, Leppenraub's spiritted but dependent
sister who takes Romulus as a lover while he's investigating her brother.
Feore gives his character an appropriately enigmatic threatening quality.</P>
<P>While the actors, music, locations and art direction all feel right, the story 
is too muddled to make the film a total success.  We're never given enough 
backstory on Romulus' family to understand his wife and daughter's extremely
negative reactions.  The film's conclusion wraps everything up too hurriedly,
with the protagonist suddenly dispensing numerous facts which the audience
hasn't been privy to.  The whole Stuyvesant concept never really goes anywhere.</P>
<P>While Lemmon's film is uneven, it's still a unique piece of work by an
inventive filmmaker willing to take risks.  That coupled with Jackson's 
masterful lead performance make "The Caveman's Valentine" more worthwhile
than most of the Hollywood mainstream product in theaters now.</P>
