<PRE>L.A. STORY
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     L.A. STORY (1991), a beautiful parody and homage written by and
starring Steve Martin, opens to a carefully choreographed water ballet
of lawn sprinklers.</P>
<P>     As L.A. wakes for another morning of glorious California sun, the
image is subtitled "Los Angeles, California, Temperature 72 degrees."
We see Los Angelenos going about their morning routines, switching from
one sleepy guy in shorts busily dragging his Christmas tree to the curb
to a suit who chats away on his cell phone as the stretched limo he is
riding in is being towed.</P>
<P>     "I live in Los Angeles, and I've had 7 heart attacks -- all
imagined," explains meteorologist Harris K. Telemacher (Steve Martin).
"That is to say, I was deeply unhappy, but I didn't know it because I
was happy all the time."</P>
<P>     "When the weather dropped to 58 degrees this weekend, how did you
cope?" asks Harris in a man-on-the-street interview.  As a wacky
television weatherman, he fits right in with the area's "culture."
Even so, he is almost fired by the show's producer, played devilishly
by a candy sucking and Hawaiian shirt wearing Woody Harrelson, when the
producer claims Harris was doing some intellectual thing during another
of his slapstickish weather reports.</P>
<P>     In a film so rich that it would take at least three viewings to
sift through all of the humor and subtleties, the show's subtext is
highly romantic and poignant.  The humor is presented with such
delicious seriousness that it becomes almost an anthropological
exploration of West Coast tribes.  ("Hi, my name is Bob," chirps Dennis
Dragon as a saccharinely polite thief.  "I'll be your robber.")  The
resulting film by director Mick Jackson is so funny that I could not
control myself at times -- one belly laugh would not subside before
another began.</P>
<P>     In a completely plastic city, where Harris drives a hundred yards
to his next door neighbor's house, he meets his would-be wife, Sara
McDowel (Victoria Tennant), who has just arrived from her home in
London.  She shocks the locals by saying exactly what is on her mind.</P>
<P>     When not attempting to date someone his own age, Harris goes out
with Sandy, who, after all, is just "4 years shy of 27."  Although the
credits list her as "Sandy," she carefully writes her name for Harris
as "SanDeE" with a star at the end and a heart encasing the name.
Sarah Jessica Parker, who has been too often miscast as she was in THE
SUBSTANCE OF FIRE, plays free spirit SanDeE with perfection.  The woman
is incapable of standing still and constantly dances and twirls, while
throwing her long, curly hair about.  Having not a care in the world
and not burdened with excessive brain power, she lives an experiential
lifestyle.</P>
<P>     An electronic highway sign plays perhaps the sweetest, and
certainly the most unusual character in the story.  The sign gives
Harris prescient advice and even speaks in riddles -- unscramble "How
Daddy is Doing," commands the sign.</P>
<P>     The show is full of well chosen cameos by known actors playing
against type.  Rick Moranis, in a Hamlet take-off, appears as a
gravedigger with a thick English accent.  Best is Patrick Stewart as
the maitre d' of a restaurant so exclusive that Harris has to accompany
him to the maitre d's bank (Fourth Reich of Hamburg) to review Harris's
financial statement before he can get a reservation.  And since his is
deemed deficient in several areas, he can order only a limited number
of items on the menu, and certainly not the duck.</P>
<P>     Thanks to the sparkling and romantic cinematography by Andrew
Dunn, the picture has a magical sense of wonderment about life.  Amidst
all the humor is a sensitive story about a man in search of meaning for
his life.  And in a quest for love.  ("Forget for this moment the smog
and the cars and the restaurant and the skating and remember only this.
A kiss may not be the truth, but it is what we wish were true.")</P>
<P>     "Wow, that was something!" says Harris as the show draws to its
delightful conclusion.  "That was really something!"  As my newfound
friends faded away, I thought, "My sentiments exactly!"</P>
<P>     L.A. STORY runs a fast 1:35.  It is rated PG-13 for very brief
nudity and a little profanity.  The show has so much mature humor that
I think kids would need to be nine or ten to appreciate it.  I strongly
recommend this gem to you and give it *** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
