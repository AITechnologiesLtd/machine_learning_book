<PRE>                              MEET WALLY SPARKS
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Meet Wally Sparks (1997) NO STARS out of ***** - Cast: Rodney Dangerfield,
Debi Mazar, Cindy Williams, Burt Reynolds, David Ogden Stiers, Alan Rachins.
Written by: Harry Basil and Rodney Dangerfield. Directed by: Peter Baldwin.
Running Time: 105 minutes.</P>
<P>With pointless cameos by: Tim Allen, Richard Bey, Michael Bolton, Tony
Danza, Lesley-Anne Down, Morton Downey Jr., Karen Duffy, Gilbert Gottfried,
John Henson, Ron Jeremy, Rikki Lake, Jay Leno, "Stuttering" John Melendez,
Sally Jesse Raphael, Michael Rooker, Bob Saget, Julia Sweeney.</P>
<P>You know that pain you get in your throat when you eat ice cream too fast?
There's nothing you can do, you just have to sit there and wait for it to go
away? Well take that pain, multiply it by 100, and you still wouldn't know
the agony that is "Meet Wally Sparks".</P>
<P>Rodney Dangerfield is talk show host Wally Sparks, although he's basically
just Rodney Dangerfield. After the network threatens to cancel his show, he
sets out to keep it on the air, and somehow ends up living in the house of
the governor of Georgia (Stiers). Countless penis jokes and other crude
sexual humor follows.</P>
<P>The film is remotely interesting for the first 30 minutes or so, only
because of the numerous cameos. But those soon stop and nightmarish agony
begins. Of all the players, only Burt Reynolds (as a network executive)
fares well. Unfortunately, his role is brief. I'm almost convinced now that
Dangerfield's entertaining 1986 film "Back to School" was a complete fluke.  [R]</P>
