<P>LOVE AND LIQUOR SWIRL IN A MADLY INTOXICATING CONCOCTION OF TRAGIC ROMANCE</P>
<P>This movie's a sure-fire hit for romantic maniac-depressives. It's
bleak, its leads do not philosophize from moralistic high stools and
its ending does not pander to the Disney crowds. Enjoying yourself
already, Bob?</P>
<P>Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is a previous human being who's present
existence is completely fuelled by alcohol. Alcohol to him is more
consuming than the air he breathes, more important than the family he
no longer has and more crucial than the Hollywood screenwriting job
from which he has just been fired. In a flash of insight while in one
of his rare sober moments, he recognises that there is no way out of
his longdrawn downward spiral. Hence, he burns all his belongings,
sells all his assets and then heads for the Las Vegas, capital of
self-loathing, with the specific intention of drinking himself to the
grave.</P>
<P>At Vegas, he almost runs down a streetwalker named Sera (Elisabeth
Shue), before promptly suggesting she keep him company for the night,
"no sex please I'm drunk", for a princely sum of $500. Henceforth, the
two social marginals hang on to each other with a poignantly warped
sense of acceptance for each other. She accepts the fact that there is
no recourse for the deathlock that alcohol has on him, while he
understands that prostitution is just a job.</P>
<P>After that night, she invites him to move in with her, vodka
and all, so that she might feed off whatever emotional morsels he has
to offer. In the meanwhile, she steers the both of them on the course
with as much semblence of a normal couple as she can possibly manage.
But as it is with any realtionship whose demands on both partners
increase with time, life for them is terrible difficult to steer under
the haze of alcohol on one hand and with the inconvenient working 
hours
on the other.</P>
<P>Much credit must go to director-screenwriter Mike Figgis (Stormy
Monday, Internal Affairs) for his screen adaptation of author John
O'Brian's (who killed himself a couple of weeks after clinching the
film deal) autobiography. Despite the melodramatic pote ntial of the
script, his cast never once wallows in the mires of self-pity but
instead, goes about trying to manage their damaged lives as best as
they can. Cage throws in much sincerity into his Oscar deserving role,
especially at the oddly endearing mom ents when his likable character
spews gems like "Looks like I'm with the right girl." when Shue
presents him with a silverflask as a gift.</P>
<P>Still, one suspects that the sentiments of the film are somewhat
exploited during the pervasive nights of quiet sobriety; with the
heavy cloak of nighttime jazz inspired blues courtesy of the ever cool
sounding Sting. That aside, it is also worthwhile not ing that the
gritty effects via Super 16 film stock on hand held cameras contribute
imensely to the film's sense of quiet, lean unsettledness.</P>
<PRE>REVIEW's rating system:
* Wait for the video.
** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
*** Pretty good, bring a friend.
**** Amazing, potent stuff.
***** Perfection. See it twice.</PRE>
