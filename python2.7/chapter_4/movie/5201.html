<PRE>                              BILLY BATHGATE
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1991) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Dustin Hoffman is undoubtedly one of the best actors of the 
past thirty years, but even the best stars appear in mediocre films at 
times. I'd compare Hoffman's role in this movie to Al Pacino in CITY 
HALL. His performance is decent even though he's relegated to a 
supporting role and the movie is mostly boring. Another similarity 
between the two films is that both focus on a young man who looks up 
to the veteran actor as an idol. Pacino was the mayor that the deputy 
mayor (John Cusack) looked up to in CITY HALL and Hoffman is the 
mob lord that Billy Bathgate (Loren Dean) idolizes.</P>
<P>        Bathgate realizes that, in Great Depression America, his only 
real chance for monetary success is in the organized crime game, 
which he enters after Dutch Schultz (Hoffman) notices him juggling 
four balls at once (and, yes, he is fully clothed at the time). Suddenly 
he's able to give out dollar bills to his friends and family, with the 
admonition to, "Go out and buy yourself something nice." BILLY 
BATHGATE is about as cliche-ridden as a movie in this genre can be. I 
was waiting for the phrase "dirty copper" to come into play somewhere 
along the line.</P>
<P>        The plot has Schultz distracted by his upcoming court trial for 
tax evasion. Bathgate has to look after the mobster's girlfriend (Nicole 
Kidman) in the meantime. Kidman plays a married woman who is just 
coming out of an affair with a double-crossing mobster (Bruce Willis) 
who's now making love to the ocean floor. Bathgate becomes her third 
extramarital conquest, after he teaches her the secret of juggling balls. 
This time, that does have a sexual connotation. To put it another way, 
it's Prohibition but he's slipping her a longneck anyway.</P>
<P>        BILLY BATHGATE was a box office bomb for a reason. It's 
just not a good movie. Besides being poorly paced and thinly plotted, 
the ending still doesn't resolve much. You're almost as surprised to see 
the credits roll as you are relieved that the movie's over. Even big stars 
make mistakes sometimes. It's just too bad these three didn't learn 
their lesson after BILLY BATHGATE. Hoffman went on to do the 
bland HERO, Kidman starred in the boring Irish epic FAR AND 
AWAY and Willis, well, does the name HUDSON HAWK ring a 
bell?</P>
