<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Mildred Pierce is a noir melodrama that served as a comeback film for waning
star Joan Crawford, who was recently dumped by MGM. Producer Jerry Wald insisted
she get the part over director Michael Curtiz's objection that she was a prima
donna and difficult to work with. The film was nominated for 6 Oscars, and Joan
won the Best Actress award. The star actresses on the Warner studio lot, such as
Barbara Stanwyck, turned down the part because they didn't want to be seen in a
part that called for them to have a 16-year-old daughter. After this film's
success, Joan was back on top. She also won Curtiz over, who was very pleased
with her work attitude and performance. </P>
<P>Screenwriter Ranald MacDougall toned down James M. Cain's steamy novel, where
Cain had Mildred Pierce as a waitress who slept her way to financial success to
provide her daughter with all the things she never had while growing up poor,
such as music lessons and a rich wardrobe. But her daughter betrayed her by
stealing her true love away from her. There is no murder in the novel, which in
the film is what the story revolves around. In the movie Mildred is a mother who
has spoiled her rotten daughter by giving her too much, as the sex scenes get
replaced by an overbearing mother not knowing how to handle her spoiled
daughter. She has become obsessed with providing her daughter with materialistic
luxuries and living only for her. </P>
<P>The film begins with the murder of unctuous playboy Monte Beragon (Zachary
Scott) in the swell house he lives in with his wife Mildred Pierce Beragon (Joan
Crawford), as four bullets are fired into him at close range and he dies while
calling out Mildred's name. Mildred walks in a drizzle down a pier and appears
to be the one who killed him. She certainly had a reason to. </P>
<P>The film is told in flashback from his murder, as all the suspects are brought
at night to the Los Angeles police station and Inspector Peterson (Olsen)
interrogates them until morning. The suspects include former husband Bert
(Bennett), whom she married at 17; business associate and close friend, the
wisecracking Ida (Eve Arden); a rapacious former real estate partner of her
husband's, Wally Fay (Jack Carson); and, the beaten-down Mildred. </P>
<P>Mildred reveals how her once happy marriage changes when her intransigent
husband loses his real estate broker partnership with Wally and starts seeing
another woman over her objections. To try and make it on her own, she gets hired
by restaurant manager Ida and becomes a waitress to support herself and her
gentle younger daughter Kay and her obnoxiously snooty 16-year-old daughter,
Veda (Blyth). With the help of Wally's keen business skills, who makes a crass
play for her which she easily fends off, she secures an ideal place to open a
restaurant. She purchases the land from wealthy society loafer Monte Beragon.
The place is an overnight smash and Mildred is now wearing fur, living in a
mansion, and providing Veda with all the love that money could buy. But this kid
is so rotten and has such a vile mouth, that it's impossible to believe that her
mother could still like her so much. Soon her sweet younger daughter dies from
an illness and Mildred becomes even more obsessed with Veda. </P>
<P>Monte turns out to be a snaky guy, playing off both mother and daughter for his
love. When he has cash problems, Mildred helps him out despite how he looks down
upon her, just like her daughter does, as someone with greasy hands from working
in the kitchen. </P>
<P>After divorcing Bert, Mildred, nevertheless, falls for the handsome Monte and is
beguiled by his charms. She marries him, despite not loving him, because she
wants Veda, now 17, to stop being a tramp and return home. But he turns out to
be scoundrel and bankrupts her chain of restaurants. </P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in next paragraph revealing the killer. </P>
<P>The climax is when she sees Veda and Monte embracing in their house and they
reveal their long time affair, and she goes to get her gun. But she can't kill
him and leaves the two parasites together. When Monte refuses to marry Veda,
saying: "You're a rotten little tramp," Veda picks up the dropped gun and kills
him. Her mother hears the shots and tries once again to protect her daughter by
setting up Wally to be in her house with the dead body, while Veda tries to flee
the state. </P>
<P>The acting and cinematography and Curtiz's directing were fine. The story didn't
make too much sense, but it was lively. It places all the blame on Mildred for
the evil that ensues, all because she did not realize how bad her daughter
really was and how desperate she was to make up for a poverty stricken
childhood. Blyth is over-the-top bitchy in her femme fatale role. </P>
<P>In the end Mildred can't save her family through money and misplaced love, and
must learn how to survive without the parasites, Veda and Monte, who ripped her
off. </P>
<P>All these melodramatics seemed heavy-handed and her selfish desires are hard to
explain, except she's someone who encouraged others to take advantage of her
because she never found satisfaction in either marriage or with herself. It was
hard to feel sorry for her, since she brought this tragedy onto herself. But the
noir film also is intent on making the point, how difficult it is for a woman on
her own to make it in a patriarchal society. The film is very reflective of
1940s attitudes about independent women who desert the idea of a nuclear family,
and how dangerous it could be for them to do that. </P>
