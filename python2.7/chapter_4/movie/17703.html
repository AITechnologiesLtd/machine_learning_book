<P>   Two giants of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud and Wilhelm
Reich, wrote profusely, but you can boil their ideas down to
two words: love and work.  If you have found love in your life
and if your career affords you satisfaction, you've got it made. 
Chances are your mental health is sound.  If you do not find
fulfillment in your work or gratification in love, you are likely
as not to be neurotic.  If we define a neurotic as a person
with unresolved anger or eternal anxiety, then Belgian
director Yvan Le Moine's title character, the red dwarf, is his
embodiment.  Shot in black-and-white to cast a distinctive
effect (Le Moine considers color photography drab), "The Red
Dwarf" uses the figure of an actual dwarf, Lucien Lhotte
(Jean-Yves Thual), to represent the small, frustrated person
locked up inside each of us straining for relief and
redemption.  This is a simple story remarkably told, yet for all
its directness "The Red Dwarf" possesses the impact of a
classic parable about the life of the ordinary person.  If we
represent banality by Arthur Miller's Willy Loman, a salesman
whose life is rooted in illusion, then the red dwarf is a
constructive icon for today's thwarted everyman--for every
worker whose job offers little satisfaction and whose leisure
hours yield little contentment.  </P>
<P>   Director Le Moine shuns not only color for his photography
but has his camera person, Danny Elsen, shoot scenes that
are personally lit by Le Moine to cast a dusty glow upon the
principal sets: the law office, the diva's luxurious villa and the
traveling circus.  The opening scene is stark, setting the tone
for the tragi-comedy.  In an old-fashioned work place, several
lawyers are seated in what could be called a Kafkaesque bad
dream.  A supervisor sits facing the staff.  Lucien, the dwarf,
is seated in the rear of the room, his expression set in the
rigid carriage of man who is bottling up enormous wrath.  His
job with the firm involves composing phony love letters that
can be used as evidence in divorce cases. Sexually he is so
repressed that he remains a while after the closing of the
office to admire the cleaning woman's wiggling butt.  At
home, he throws the phone to the floor in impotent rage.  A
chance meeting with an 11-year-old  trapeze artist, Isis (Dyna
Gauzy), who works with a traveling circus, leads to the girl's
attaching herself fondly to the dwarf.  Yet another meeting
with a battered, fabulously wealthy, aging diva, Countess
Paola Bendoni (Anita Ekberg) leads Lucien to make a bold,
successful attempt at seduction.  When the countess returns
to her husband Bob (Arno Chevirer), giving up the idea of
divorce, Lucien is filled with a desire for revenge.  He
commits an existential act that changes the life of the
miserable little thirty-five-year old man.</P>
<P>   In satirizing office politics, Le Moine mines the comedy that
has driven far more commercial movies like "Office Space,"
but he emphasizes the near-tragic, dreary undertones that
are so familiar to men and women who are alienated in the
work force.  Lucien feels the disaffection more than the
average fellow because his height makes him the object of
condescension whether he is on the job, shopping in a store,
trying to enjoy a drink at a bar or simply walking in the street. 
The people he runs into seem to think that they can play with
him, to treat him generally as they would a child.  Only when
he takes a job in the circus does he put his handicap to good
use, though his aspirations to be a big man--exhibited by his
use of stilts and his climbing on the shoulders of a bulky co-
worker--do not yield the satisfaction he ultimately gains when
he returns the innocent love a child.</P>
<P>   The entire work is suffused partly with the influence of
Fellini, and indeed Anita Ekberg--who starred in the master's
"La Dolce Vita" some 35 years ago--has returned in the role
of a dissipated has-been.  But a better case could be made
for the influence of Piers Paolo Pasolini on this Belgian
director.  Pasolini, at once a Marxist and a man given to
mystical religious feeling, had the same sympathetic feelings
for the working class, shown most strongly in his images of a
slum kid in "Accattone."  Like Pasolini, Le Moine reaches
back to medieval legend in composing a parable about wrath,
one of the seven deadly sins, making this film the first of a
planned series of seven on that very subject.</P>
<P>   Mixing comedy and tragedy, debauchery with redemption, a
lust for revenge with the ache for inner peace, "The Red
Dwarf" is an impressive first work indeed for Mr. Le Moine,
who shows promise to develop a sparkling series of tragi-
comedies on humankind's favorite failings.  </P>
