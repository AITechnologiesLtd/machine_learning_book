<P>     In the words of actor Douglas Henshall, ANGELS AND INSECTS, the 
latest film from MUSIC OF CHANCE writer/director Philip Haas, is 
"Merchant Ivory meets Tennessee Williams."  It's a fair comparison.  The 
movie is a period piece, taking place in the late 1850s and early 1860s, 
but the air of Victorian restraint is frequently disturbed by aggressive 
displays of sexuality.  However, unlike the work of either Merchant & 
Ivory or Tennessee Williams, ANGELS AND INSECTS is a presentation of 
ideas over characters.  And, although competently acted, it lacks the 
one standout performance which could have transformed it from a 
fascinating motion picture to a great one.</P>
<P>     ANGELS AND INSECTS, based on A.S. Byatt's novella MORPHO EUGENIA, 
opens in Victorian England with the arrival of naturalist William 
Adamson (Mark Rylance) at the demesne of the Alabaster family.  William 
was recently shipwrecked on his return journey from South America, and, 
in that disaster, lost all of his worldly possessions.  Reverend 
Alabaster (Jerermy Kemp), keen to have an educated scientist help with a 
book he is writing, invites William to live in his house.  Once there, 
he becomes infatuated with the serenely beautiful-but-cold Eugenia 
(Patsy Kensit), the eldest daughter of the Alabasters.  Although not 
hopeful that a match is likely, William nevertheless courts Eugenia, and 
is greatly surprised when she accepts his marriage proposal.  But a dark 
secret in her past cannot stay buried forever.</P>
<P>     In many ways, this film is a study in contrasts:  the passionate 
abandon of the South American natives to the structured restraint of 
England's Victorian aristocrats, Darwin's evolution to the Bible's 
creation, butterflies to ants, and beauty to intelligence.  Haas wants 
us not only to understand the rigidity of life on the Alabaster estate, 
but to see the decadence that bubbles just beneath the surface.  
Eugenia's apparent physical perfection, which enthralls William, hides a 
dead, ravaged soul.</P>
<P>     Haas has elected not to reveal the horror of Eugenia's situation in 
one melodramatic moment of discovery.  Instead, he gradually unfolds the 
truth, feeding it to the audience bit-by-bit, clue-by-clue, so that when 
the generally-oblivious William finally learns his wife's secret, we are 
already cognizant of it.  The entire narrative of ANGELS AND INSECTS is 
fashioned like this, with slow, steady revelations.</P>
<P>     If Eugenia is the butterfly -- beautiful, fragile, and as vapid as 
"colored air", then Matty Crompton (Kristin Scott Thomas), an educated 
woman living with the Alabasters, is the ant -- plain, resourceful, and 
intelligent.  It doesn't take William long to learn that he has married 
the wrong woman.  Matty is his perfect companion, but he recognizes too 
late how little value should be placed on physical appearance.  </P>
<P>     ANGELS AND INSECTS compares human life to that of an ant colony.  
The similarities and differences are striking.  Like men and women, ants 
are organized, social creatures whose primary purpose is reproduction.  
However, in the kingdom of the insects, there is no decadence, no 
hatred, and no duplicity.  Ants serve their queen selflessly rather than 
always seeking their own ends.  Humans think of themselves as civilized 
-- the product of generations of sexual selection -- but the true 
barbarism of their nature often surfaces.</P>
<P>     The drawback of ANGELS AND INSECTS is a combination of lackluster 
characterization and mediocre acting.  None of the men or women 
populating this film grab our sympathy.  In the case of someone as 
shallow as Eugenia, this is entirely appropriate, but William remains 
strangely distant, in part because of a bland performance by Mark 
Rylance.  As Anthony Hopkins has shown, it's possible to present a 
passionate portrait of restraint.  Unfortunately, Rylance's William is 
too often without soul or heart.  This leads us to watch him with 
interest, but never become emotionally engaged in his travails.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, the reason to see ANGELS AND INSECTS is for its keen 
and intricate explorations of human sexual and social interaction.   In 
the world of insects, there is only one layer, but men and women hide 
truth beneath many facades.  Yet perhaps the most striking similarity is 
how members of both species are capable of stinging without remorse, 
unconcerned about the consequences.  That's an uncomfortable message 
that everyone can relate to.</P>
