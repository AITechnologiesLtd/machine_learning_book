<P>    So, you have to see this one in Chapel Hill, at the Carolina, and
they're conveniently charging $7.50 for all shows.  Price gouging is
what it's called and, if you arrive early, you'll have time to (a.) get
incensed and (b.) deliver a monologue about it in the lobby.  I just
took my seat, as I was already spent from having an aside on Franklin
Street, after a traffic ticket informed me that the Elvismobile was
parked approximately one inch into a towing zone.  Sigh.  I can report
that $32.50 buys a lot of movie.  Four hours worth, actually, with the
complete text, a zany international cast, Elsinore imagined as a bright
and sunny palace, and Kenneth Branagh, Mr. Shakespeare himself, spitting
spittle as the peroxide-blonde brooder.  (His Hamlet is quite the
shouter.) The twenty-minute intermission is helpful, though, by the end,
I wanted even more movie.  I wanted more action, more sprawl, and more
visual space, especially in the flashbacks and exterior scenes.  I
wanted to witness Ophelia's final fate, for example, and see more of the
Norwegians, who storm the castle at the end of the story.  Mr. B.  has
made a big play at a big play, but, you know, it still doesn't feel like
a big-enough movie.</P>
