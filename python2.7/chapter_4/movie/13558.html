<PRE>                           THE MASK OF ZORRO
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Perhaps the greatest of all
          swashbuckling heroes is back on the screen.  The
          new story offers us not one but two different
          Zorros played by Anthony Hopkins and Antonio
          Banderas as the mask and cape are passed to a new
          generation.  THE MASK OF ZORRO may not all make
          sense, but it is great to have a big, brash
          historical adventure back on the wide screen.
          Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4).  Spoiler
          Warning: some comments about the plot follow the
          main review.  They could be spoilers.</PRE>
<P>     I think I qualify as a Zorro fan.  When I finally finished the
serial SON OF ZORRO last month I had seen every live-action Zorro film
or serial ever released in the English language.  And I am one-up on
even some of the most confirmed Zorro fans, having found and read THE
CURSE OF CAPISTRANO by Johnston McCulley years ago.  [It was nearly
impossible to find until its paperback reprint this year as THE MARK OF
ZORRO.]  The legend of El Zorro, the Fox, began when Johnston
McCulley's story was serialized in five parts starting August 9, 1919,
in ALL-STORY WEEKLY.  In the story the character of Zorro, dashing
outlaw on the side of good hiding behind the guise of the effete fop,
was almost a direct steal from the Baroness Orczy's Scarlet Pimpernel,
created in 1904.  The following year the story was made into the film
THE MARK OF ZORRO with Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.  The 1920 film was very
faithful to the novel, but it revealed much sooner who was behind the
mask so it would better show off Fairbanks's talents.  Through the
years Zorro has graced several English-language films, serials, and a
TV series. Zorro was the original "Caped Crusader" of American pop
culture and undoubtedly was part of the inspiration for Batman.  As
popular as he is in America, he is even more popular abroad and has
been portrayed in an astounding number of Italian, French, Spanish, and
Mexican films.  The most recent film version was the 1980 ZORRO, THE
GAY BLADE, a strained comedy starring George Hamilton.  Now Tristar
Pictures has brought back Zorro in a (mostly) serious film adventure.</P>
<P>     The film THE MASK OF ZORRO might more aptly be called THE RETURN
OF ZORRO.  Departing from the canon of the earlier stories Diego de la
Vega (also known as Zorro and played here by Anthony Hopkins) is
captured by an arch-enemy Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson), the Spanish
Governor.  In the process Esperanza, Diego's wife whom both men loved,
is killed.  Rafael takes Diego's daughter Elena, adopting her as his
own, and returning to Spain.  Twenty years later the real story begins
with Rafael returning to California where Diego is still imprisoned.
Diego escapes and runs into Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas), a
young man that Diego had known before his imprisonment.  Murrieta has
turned into a somewhat incompetent bandit with a vendetta against
Captain Harrison Love (Matthew Letscher) who happens to be an ally of
Montero.  Diego decides not just to befriend this enemy of his enemy,
he decides to make the young man into a new Zorro.  Completing the set
of principles is Elena (Catherine Zeta Jones), a grown woman and
returned from Spain to be with Montero, whom she believes to be her
father.</P>
<P>     The script for THE MASK OF ZORRO was written by Terry Rossio, Ted
Elliott, and John Eskow, who seem most familiar with the Disney version
of Zorro.  At least, when they need to coin new names, they use Garcia
and Bernardo, taken from the Disney version.  The score by James Horner
makes heavy use of crisp flamenco rhythms.  But Horner had his work cut
out for him to try to match the great Alfred Newman score of the 1940
film THE MARK OF ZORRO.</P>
<P>     Anthony Hopkins proves once again how versatile an actor he is as
Diego de la Vega.  He does a decent job playing a dashing swordsman
considerably his junior.  It is obvious that he has a double for some
of the most vigorous scenes, but he is apparently doing much of his own
swordplay.  Antonio Banderas is to the best of my knowledge the first
Hispanic to play El Zorro on the American screen.  The character Zorro
has always been played with some wit, though a little less might have
been more.  Catherine Zeta Jones's Elena has more than sufficient fire
for the role.  Perhaps the best scene in the film is a quiet
conversation between her and Hopkins.  The film was directed by Martin
Campbell, best known for directing GOLDENEYE.</P>
<P>     Perhaps not everything works, as I relate in the spoiler section
to follow.  But as a Zorro fan I just know that had they called me in
as a consultant I could have fine-tuned this film to perfection.  There
was a lot that bothered me, but I still hope it makes a mint and we get
some more.  After all, you just can't have too many Zorro films, can
you?  I rate THE MASK OF ZORRO a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     Spoiler... Spoiler... Spoiler... Spoiler...</P>
<PRE>     Some random comments:</PRE>
<P>     There is one very big hole in the plot. Rafael Montero intends to
buy California from Santa Ana in the name of the Spanish government,
but actually for himself.  I strongly doubt that Santa Ana would sell
in the first place even to the Spanish.  The US-Mexican War, 1846-8,
was fought to force Santa Ana to sell Texas and other territories to
the United States.  Santa Ana did not want to sell off his country.
But if Santa Ana agreed to sell California to Spain, then what?  When
he discovered the Spanish government knew nothing about the transaction
he would declare the sale null and void.  He would field an army
(probably with Don Rafael's own gold) and retake California.  If Don
Rafael had had the strength to defend California he would not have
needed the gold in the first place.  If he did not have the strength
the fact that had given Santa Ana some gold and lied about whom he
represented would have amounted to no more than a political
contribution.</P>
<P>     The climactic explosion would have killed all the laborers, at
least the way the sequence is edited.  In most films that would be a
problem.  Here I will consider it a nod to the impossible escapes in
the Zorro serials. Another problem with the plot is that at the end of
the film a lot of people know that there is sufficient gold in
California to make mining highly profitable.  California would have had
a very different history if that information were public so early.</P>
<P>     But not all my comments will be negative.  Usually the scripting
of this sort of film is straightforward and not very subtle.  I would
like to point out what I found a clever piece of plotting.  It was
going to come down to one man's word against another who Elena's father
was.  A lessor script might have left it strictly an emotional
decision.  The double coincidence that Diego is here with such a hatred
for her father and that Elena so resembles Esperanza is just too much
coincidence.  She might not know who her father is, but logically
Esperanza has to be her mother.</P>
<P>     The ending of the McCulley's Zorro was never quite satisfying.  He
was to become a wealthy landowner and "raise fat children."  There is
something satisfying in having Zorro not go gently into that good
night.</P>
