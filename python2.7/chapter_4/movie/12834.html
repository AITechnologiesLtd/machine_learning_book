<P>Cannonball Run II (1984) ***1/2 out of ****</P>
<P>Starring:  Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, Shirley MacLaine, Marilu Henner, 
Telly Sevalas, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Catherine Bach, Jack Elam, 
Jackie Chan, Frank Sinatra, Don Knotts, Tim Conway.</P>
<PRE>Directed By: Hal Needham</PRE>
<P>This movie has to be one of the funniest movies of the 80's and sadly 
overlooked.  It is often relegated as a second-rate Burt, but this movie 
packs so many cameos and awesome stunts by director Hal Needham that it 
achieves a surrealism that almost makes it a commentary on pop-art 
culture.  Let's me describe the plot  What do you get when you mix a 
pair of bogus nuns, inept undeworld warfare, and a bunch of crazies 
willing to risk their necks in a all-out cross country race?  All out 
mayhem!  Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise star once again as the heroes who 
must win their prize at the end of road away from stiff competitors who 
will do anything to get their hands on the gold.  Cameos range from 
Jackie Chan to Frank Sinatra as the President.  The stunts are 
spectacular and the laughs fast and furious.  And, of course, there's 
Dom DeLuise burning up the screen as Captain Chaos that adds complexity 
to the story.  A true-crowd pleaser if there ever was one. Dig this one 
up, invite some friends, and make a double-bill with Reynold's new 
classic, Boogie Nights, for a great night at home.  It will be well 
worth it!</P>
