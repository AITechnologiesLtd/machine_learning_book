<PRE>                             MEN IN BLACK</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: 8.0 and $7.50</PRE>
<P>    FINALLY.  That was my reaction 1/3 of the way into MIB.  Finally a
movie this summer that I could enjoy!</P>
<P>    This movie is everything _Batman & Robin_ failed to be.  It held my
attention start to finish, and I enjoyed every minute of it.</P>
<P>    Everyone in the movie gave excellent performances.  Mr. Jones and Mr.
Smith were outstanding.  Jones's dead-pan humor and seriousness clicked
wonderfully.  Smith's quick wit and slick style were a perfect fit.</P>
<P>    But, surprisingly, the most impressive performance for me was Vincent
D'Onofrio as the major evil character.  His performance was so unstressed
and dynamic that it was completely believable.  Furthermore, it looked
like he threw himself wholeheartedly into the part.  He should win an
Oscar.</P>
<P>    The effects were special, but not overbearing.  Their subtlety
helped to leave me feeling like the movie _just might_ be true.</P>
<P>   My only criticisms are that the film seems to end much too soon and
hurriedly, and Linda Fiorentino's part is far too minor.  Not only is she
gorgeous (even moreso now that we have seen her as a coroner), but she is
also a very talented actress.  It is too bad this movie didn't offer her
much of an opportunity to show that off.</P>
<P>    You want to see this movie at least once at a theatre.  I'd recommend
you see it at least three times.  I wouldn't recommend it for the littlest
members of the family, but bring everyone else.  Make an event of it.  Do
not miss this movie.</P>
<P><HR>My #1 rule in reviewing is: NO SPOILERS.  Instead of discussing the
plot, I choose instead to discuss performances, believability,
entertainment value, etc.  If you want the plot, see the movie.</P>
<P>I give two ratings: An arbitrary scale of enjoyability (1 to 10) and
a maximum price I would pay to see the movie.<HR></P>
