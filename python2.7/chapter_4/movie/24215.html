<P>The "submarine" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing
and compelling types of storytelling there is.  Think about it... these
films are completely based in reality, yet only a handful of people have
ever been on one, making them fascinating to the general public.  They
aren't like movies that take place on a plane or a train, as anybody can
get on one of those.  And they aren't like movies that happen in outer
space either, because no one's done any of that stuff yet.  When a new
one comes out, you don't hear anyone say "ugh, another submarine movie"
like people tend to say "ugh, another boxing movie".  Look at modern
movies that involve submarines: Das Boot, The Abyss, The Hunt for Red
October, Crimson Tide... all are well regarded as top-notch
entertainment. </P>
<P>Gladly joining that bunch is U-571, which stars Matthew McConaughey as
the executive officer of a U.S. Naval submarine during World War II. We
learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his
superior (Bill Paxton).  McConaughey's crew then receives orders that
they will be boarding a disabled German submarine to steal the Enigma, a
German communications encoding device that has stumped Allied
Intelligence.  The mission goes horribly wrong however, and as a result,
McConaughey and only a handful of his crew (as well as a captured
German) become trapped aboard the U-571 in enemy waters. </P>
<P>The first great thing about U-571 is the film's opening sequence.  The
German crew of U-571 are under attack, which sets the events of the rest
of the film into motion.  It's tense, exciting and fascinating.  And I
applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the
entire sequence in German with English subtitles.  Most movies with a
scene this long would have panicked and had the German crew speaking
English right away. </P>
<P>Once the plot gets moving, U-571 gives us action sequence after action
sequence, making the audience wonder "Ok, now how do they get out of
this?".  The stakes keep raising (much like in Executive Decision, an
excellent action-thriller), and even though the audience knows how the
film will end, it's a lot of fun getting there. </P>
<P>I only have two minor complaints about the entire film.  The first comes
from the scenes which follow the opening sequence.  While their purpose
is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going (which
they do), I feel as though it could have been done much quicker, and
less conventionally.  I mean, did we really have to see the ship's crew
at a wedding?  Because of that, you now know exactly what's going to
happen to the groom! </P>
<P>My other gripe would be during the film's finale.  There's an explosion
which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking CGI effects since
the President's plane crashed into the ocean at the end of Air Force
One.  I cannot stress this enough... until a CGI effect can be made to
look like a model effect, stick with using models. </P>
<P>Yes, U-571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics
in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you
"that couldn't happen", but the overall point of this film is
entertainment.  It succeeds fantastically.  [PG-13]</P>
