<P>It had been a while since I had seen a movie this bad. I honestly thought
that they just didn't exist anymore. Sure, this year was filled with a lot
of so-so movies, even a few films that just plain sucked, but none had
actually managed to make me physically ill as this film did. By the first 45
minutes, I wanted to all-out kill the lead character, who could not have
been a worse human being. Were we supposed to care about this woman for some
reason?! I don't know. Was it all supposed to be funny?! Not sure. All I
know is that this was one of the sappiest, stupidest, most embarrassing
films put to the screen over the past few years. And now, I will go puke and
hopefully feel a little better afterwards. PS: Skip this movie!</P>
<P>PLOT:
An ugly duckling girl turns into a moderately attractive woman and somehow
manages to become Miss Illinois and get a shot at the Miss America Miss
contest. Despite paying her own daughter no mind and treating everyone else
around her like they didn't exist or matter, the woman somehow manages to
make it into the finals, where she must inevitably decide what she wants out
of her own life. Yugh! (and believe you me, I've actually left out the
stupidest parts!)</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This movie is hilarious...hilariously bad! The lead character in this film,
played by Minnie Driver, is one of the most reprehensible human beings that
I have ever had the displeasure of watching at the movies. She is shallow,
self-centered, rude, vain, egotistical, a bad sport, a bad friend, a bad
mother, a bad person, bad with kids, horrible with her own kid...and just a
big ol' despicable human being. Not many qualities, I assure you. Why oh
why, the folks behind this wretched film thought that anyone in the audience
would give a rat's ass about a lady who treats everyone around her like
garbage, most especially her own kid (!), with only her idiotic dream of
winning the Miss America Miss contest as her goal in life, is beyond me! But
sadly, she is not the film's only problem. The biggest issue that this movie
has is its terribly formulated screenplay. I am honestly still not sure
whether or not this was supposed to be a drama or a comedy, but either way,
the film is just howlingly bad. The dramatic moments were humorous (one of
Minnie's friends is in jail on a murder rap and all she wants to discuss is
her upcoming beauty pageant...and yes, that was supposed to be a dramatic
moment!), and the funny moments, just plain stupid (Minnie puts crazy glue
on her competitor's baton so that she could sabotage her
performance...hahaha, look at her, she can't let go of the
baton...hahaha...ugh!).</P>
<P>Add that to the embarrassing plot device used to get the mother and daughter
together (I won't ruin it here, but it is one of the most nonsensical plot
twists that I have ever witnessed in a movie), the pathetic acting
performance given by Joey Lauren Adams (the thought of her prison
"confrontation" scene still makes me cringe), the extreme disservice that
this film does to all beauty pageants and the pseudo-lesbian undertones, and
God-oh-mighty, how the heck did this one get past the guards at the gate?!?
The smartest person in this whole film is a 7-year old kid, who manages to
say all the right things, while the only man in the script is a
child-molesting drunk? Yeesh! C'mon ladies, are we really that bad? Director
Sally Field also paces the film all wrong. Too much time is spent on the
childhood, the film goes on for too long, and without a proper line between
humor and drama, the film just dies all around. And what's with Minnie
looking like a transvestite in the final "talent" contest? Yikes! And that
dress! Ugh. Bad decisions all around! But when the lead character can be
described in three simple words, bee-a-tch, you know the movie isn't gonna
touch many hearts. Men, stay away, and I mean FAR AWAY from this one. And
women...stay away also. But if you do decide to go, please just do me one
favor: DO NOT BRING YOUR KIDS TO THIS FILM! The lead is an egotistical,
selfish, lying phony who will give your loved ones nothing but bad advice
and offensive moral values. Actually, you might want to take them in order
to show them what NOT to become in their lives! I gave this movie one point
because of the lovely Bridgette Wilson, who looked real pretty in the film.
Other than that, a complete and utter waste of time. I'm gonna go brush my
teeth now.</P>
<P>Having done a little bit of research into the screenwriter of this film, Jon
Bernstein, I found that he had only written one other movie project before
this one. Do you want to guess what it was? It's actually a perfect
companion piece to this film...Jerry Springer's RINGMASTER! Oh
my...Jon...please...for the love of God and all that is good and sacred in
this world and in screenwriting...put down the pen and concentrate your life
on something else. You're "hurting" the world by writing movies.</P>
