<PRE>                                CAST AWAY
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Only a year ago, Cast Away would have been subject to unavoidable
and endless Gilligan's Island comparisons.  Now, it will never hear the
end of Survivor analogies, and that's too bad, because the film really
has no resemblance to either TV show.</P>
<P>     Cast Away is The Big Tom Hanks Movie of 2000, the latest in a long
line of Big Tom Hanks Movies that stretches back to include The Green
Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Apollo 13, Forrest Gump, and Philadelphia. 
However, Cast Away has the distinction of being the only Tom Hanks Movie
to star no one but Tom Hanks.</P>
<P>     Just about, anyway.  As you've undoubtedly heard, Cast Away largely
concerns Hanks' character Chuck Noland, stranded and forgotten on a tiny
island in the South Pacific after his plane goes down in the drink. 
Ruthless in business (living and dying "by the clock,"), yet deep down
kind enough to give you the shirt off his back, Noland is a FedEx
manager constantly jetting around the globe to fix things that go awry. 
And that means lots of plane time.</P>
<P>     In one of the most spectacular, realistic, and harrowing crash
sequences put to film, Noland's sudden Christmas Eve flight goes off
course and then plummets into the ocean, only hours after Noland has
handed a small, conspicuously ring-sized box to his earthbound
girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt).  Karma and Hollywood being what they are,
Noland survives the crash and winds up on the aforementioned island. 
And get comfy, because he's going to spend a long time there.</P>
<P>     Skeptics be damned, Cast Away's finest moments consist of Hanks
alone with his surroundings.  I never thought it would be any fun to
watch Mr. Gump parade around on the beach solo, but it simply is, a
testament to the man's serious acting chops.  As Noland figures out how
to survive against impossible odds -- from opening a coconut to making a
fire to collecting fresh water to drink to dealing with a toothache -- I
found immense satisfaction in viewing his daily rituals.  The actual
experience of being on that island would be unfathomable and
unbearable.  To have turned it into a very watchable movie is
unthinkable.  And yet they've done it.</P>
<P>     I'm not giving anything away that isn't part of the trailer by
saying that, years later, Noland escapes his gulag, whereupon he must
come to terms with a world that has cast him away (get it?). 
Unfortunately, once Hanks is back in civilization, the movie completely
bogs down with soulful soliloquies, mainly between Noland and his lost
girl Kelly, who has had to move on with her life.  None of this epilogue
offers anything in the way of surprise, mainly because director Robert
Zemeckis cuts out what stood to be the most thrilling part of the film
-- the first month that Hanks spends back in civilization.  I mean, if
you spent four years alone on an island, do you know how seriously
fucked up you'd be?  Hell, I start to itch if the TV is off for an hour.</P>
<P>     But in Cast Away Hanks is a longhaired near maniac one minute.  The
next he's shaved and fine, with a little insomnia and sun-bleached hair
his only apparent problems, mental or physical.  You could have made an
entire film about his reconditioning.  Or you could have just ended it
when he makes his escape.  Anything but this hour of padding that
leeches from what is otherwise an emotional tour de force.</P>
<P>     It is certain that Hanks's name will be up in lights again come
Oscar nomination time.  The same can't be said for Helen Hunt, an
unfortunate casting mistake whose innate, hard-assed unlovability makes
you wonder why Noland was interested in her to begin with.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, Cast Away rests wholly on the strength of its second
act and its leading man.  The supporting cast, the editing, the
camerawork -- everything else is completely swept aside to make way for
our survivor.  And that's funny, because if you'd told me yesterday that
Tom Hanks, a movie camera, and a whole lot of nothin' would be the
recipe for great cinema, I'd have told you to take a flying leap in the
ocean.</P>
