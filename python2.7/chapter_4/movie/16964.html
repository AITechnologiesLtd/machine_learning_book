<P>What is pornography? Is it the showing of forbidden areas on a human 
body? Do they need to be shown in a sexual fashion to constitute 
pornography? Does the goal of the exploitation have to be sexual 
gratification for the viewer? The Supreme Court of the United States of 
America once spoke of pornography, and gave the explanation "You know it 
when you see it." After seeing 8MM, the latest film from director Joel 
Schumacher, I am convinced that the Supreme Court was absolutely 
correct.</P>
<P>A multi-millionaire widow discovers an 8mm film in her husband's safe, 
in which a young girl appears to raped and murdered in a most violent 
fashion. So, her and her attorney hire private detective Tom Welles 
(Nicholas Cage) to look into the authenticity of the film, and determine 
whether or not this could be a real snuff film, or if the murder is 
faked. Welles assures her that the film must be fake, saying that snuff 
films are "basically an urban legend--makeup, special effects" 
However, nonetheless, he agrees to look into it. He decides that the 
most effective way would be to treat the girl in the film like a missing 
person, and see what turns up.</P>
<P>He soon finds the girl and discovers that she is, indeed missing, and 
had run away to Los Angeles, where she found a home in the underground 
porn industry. So Welles makes his way into this dark, sick, and 
disgusting underground world with the help of Max California (Joaquin 
Phoenix), a clerk at a porn store. And that is what this film deals 
with, the underground porn world, and the people involved with it. It 
introduces characters that star in and make these various S/M films 
which feature everything from the mild beatings and whippings, to lewd 
images of children in those acts, to bestiality. His goal is to find the 
people that dealt with this girl, and what happened to her.</P>
<P>He also finds the girl's mother, which becomes an interesting side 
plot to the story. The film deals with her coping with the loss of her 
only child for no apparent explanation. She becomes one of the films 
most intriguing characters, because her and Welles are the only people 
in this movie that average persons can relate to. And they are opposites 
of each other. She is dealing with the loss of a child and husband that 
has left her. He is a new father with a wife that is just starting to 
detect marriage problems due to his work.</P>
<P>At one point, Max California tells Welles that he will "see things you 
can't unsee." That is a drastic understatement, as Schumacher chose to 
allow the audience to view almost everything that Welles does. And some 
of the images are absolutely haunting. You, the audience member, ask 
yourself the questions that Welles is asking the people behind these 
films, namely "why?" It is incomprehensible to me how some of these 
people could exist in the real world, or how some of them could be sick 
enough to engage in these behaviors, and yet that is the most 
frightening element of this film, that people like those doe really 
exist.</P>
<P>With that said, my largest gripe with this film is it's rating. 
Probably due to the big names behind it, 8MM was issued an R rating by 
the MPAA. The first realization that I came to is that 8MM is not 
pornography in any way shape or form. It contains scenes and images that 
would, without question, constitute pornography, but it itself is not. 
What it is is a frighteningly real and intense film that audiences 
won't enjoy as much as be shocked by. And, as it is warned, you cannot 
unsee some of the things in this film, they just don't go away. For 
that reason, 8MM is more than deserving of an NC-17 rating, as films 
like Showgirls, Orgazmo, and Kids look like a humorous family films when 
in comparison.</P>
<P>Nicholas Cage is absolutely phenomenal in his role. He acts like your 
tour guide through this deep, dark underground world, and is masterful 
in doing so. At one point he holds a sick, twisted, murderer at his 
mercy, but cannot come to execute him. So he calls the victim's family 
and requests permission to do so. That is one of his moments of pure 
humanity. At other times he comes closer to insanity. Another scene 
features him with a different murderer, just muttering the question 
"why?" over and over. The response is chilling as he snaps "The things 
I do - I do them because I like them. Because I want to." That is what 
this film is about.</P>
<P>Director Joel Schumacher has once again created a dark film that is 
truly dark. Literally, less than 10 minutes of this film are in well-lit 
areas. That adds a creepy and intense feel to the film, which is backed 
up by a frightening score throughout the film, which is only substituted 
for an eerie silence. Quite literally, from the first scene, you find 
yourself on the edge of your seat, not because you don't know what 
will happen next, but rather because you are too scared to sit back.</P>
<P>When all is said and done, 8MM is a frightening, dark, intense movie 
that will stay with you for a long time. It has it's flaws in that 
some of the acting is less than ideal, and there may just be such a 
thing as too much darkness for one movie. But it is good in principal, 
and features a wonderful performance by Nicholas Cage, and one of the 
most amazing character studies since Hannibal Lector in The Silence of 
the Lambs. I only warn that "you see things you can't unsee."</P>
