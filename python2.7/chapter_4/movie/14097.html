<P>     Mike Myers transforms himself in 54, in virtually every way a
performer can transform himself.  Myers plays Steve Rubell, the nightclub
impresario who created the Manhattan disco to be the center of the party
universe in the closing years of the 1970s.  Rubell presides over his
kingdom in a heavy-lidded barbiturate stupor, wheezing a forced monotone
cackle as he moves among his glitterati guests.  In his first truly
dramatic screen performance, Myers is still recognizable with his
open-mouthed little boy grin, but here he uses it to create an overgrown
little boy convinced he can only find friends by throwing the coolest
party.  Wearing Izod shirts and sweaters, thinning hair perched
pointlessly on top of his head, Rubell is a proto-Gates portrait of
entrepreneurial geekdom.  If people won't play with him because they like
him, he'll make them play with him because they need him.</P>
<P>     Rubell is a fascinating character, performed by Myers with a mix of
savvy, pathos and self-absorption.  If writer/director Mark Christopher
had had the common sense to make 54 the story of Steve Rubell, he might
have created a great film.  Instead, he makes his protagonist a New Jersey
kid named Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe) who comes to Manhattan in 1979 to
break away from his dead-end family.  He first manages to catch Rubell's
eye and gain entry into the club, then lands a job as a busboy, eventually
moving up the Studio 54 social ladder to bartender.  Along the way he
befriends another busboy named Greg (CLUELESS's Breckin Meyer) and Greg's
wife, aspiring disco diva Anita (Salma Hayek).  He also becomes infatuated
with Julie Black (Neve Campbell), a soap opera ingenue whose
Jersey-to-the-big-time success story inspired him to action.</P>
<P>     54's base-line narrative is so trite it almost plays like a parody, a
disco-era goof on MIDNIGHT COWBOY or some far less seminal corruption of
the innocent melodrama.  Naturally, the fame and flash go immediately to
Shane's head as he poses for modeling shoots and buys a Camaro with
personalized plates; naturally, he is lured into a sordid world of sex,
drugs and money; naturally, he begins to alienate his friends and family.
Christopher heads down every obvious path in the interactions between
Shane, Greg, Anita and Julie, apparently oblivious to the fact that every
one of those characters is a piece of cardboard.  Perhaps it was his idea
of irony:  like Studio 54 itself, his movie invites people in so they can
stand around and be attractive.</P>
<P>     The plotting and pacing are so relentlessly predictable that the film
doesn't even work well as a sociology lesson.  Occasionally it offers
peeks at the side rooms or basement hot spots where the elite meet to
revel in their elite-ness; occasionally it focuses on the politics of
succeeding in an environment of glamour for glamour's sake.  Shane's
voice-over narration dutifully informs us why Studio 54 was so unique and
popular, but there's never enough energy for us to believe him or care.
54 spends 91 minutes pointing off-handedly at this or that detail like a
bored tour guide.  For a film that includes money-laundering, ripping off
the mob, sex, drugs, celebrities and plenty of boogie oogie oogie-ing, it
almost never gets the pulse racing.</P>
<P>     The notable exceptions are the scenes involving Myers as Rubell.
Sure, the character isn't perfectly realized; in fact, it probably seems
better simply because it's surrounded by so much uninspired junk.  There
is something undeniably intriguing about Rubell, however, as his king of
the playground glee mingles with self-destructive anxiety and paranoia.
It's also amusing watching him tell a talk show host "the road of excess
leads to the palace of wisdom" after we've seen him lying in a pile of
money, drooling vomit.  There's a great story in that unhappy collection
of contradictions, but you won't find it amidst the smothering cliches of
Mark Christopher's script.  With all the stranger-than-fiction truth at
his disposal, he somehow found the least interesting approach possible.
Steve Rubell would have been disgusted to see Studio 54 turned into
something so...mundane.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 disco balls:  4.</PRE>
