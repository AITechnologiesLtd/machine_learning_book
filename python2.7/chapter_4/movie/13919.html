<P>As of 1997, Jack Nicholson has won three Academy Awards.  In 1975 as
Best Actor in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' even though Nicholson
should have won for 'Chinatown' in 1974 and Al Pacino should have won
for 'Dog Day Afternoon' the year that Nicholson won for 'One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest', but that's the way things go.  Nicholson has also
won in 1983 for Best Supporting Actor in 'Terms of Endearment' and in
1997, again for Best Actor in 'As Good As it Gets'.  Nicholson's only
other Oscar nomination in the 90's so far has been for Best Supporting
Actor in 1992's 'A Few Good Men'.  Nicholson's portrayal of a deranged
and fanatical Marine named Col. Nathan Jessep is largely the strength
that holds 'A Few Good Men' together for its entire run of 138 minutes.
As a courtroom drama for much of its running time, it has the potential
to fizz out quickly but Nicholson's appearance in the movie's climax is
the film's defining moment.  Whenever a movie runs over two hours in
length, I always get nervous, fearing over length but that doesn't occur
in this film in which Nicholson appears only in four key scenes but they
are the most powerful in the film.</P>
<P>The film opens on a U.S. military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba where two
Marines are seen bursting into the room of another where they gag him
with electrical tape, tie his hands and feet with it and stuff a rag
into his mouth.  As we cut to the opening credits list, we are treated
to a sequence of drills performed by a squadron of Marines in full
formal dress who perform some fancy movements with their rifles.  As the
film begins its basic run, we discover that the opening sequence has led
to the death of the Marine ambushed and legal counsel is assigned to
represent the two other Marines charged with the crime of murdering
him.  Lt. Commander JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) asks for the job but
the assignment goes to Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) who has only been
out of law school and in the Navy a short while.  Kaffee's specialty is
plea bargains.  He is reluctant to go to court.  His investigation of
the case leads him to go to court eventually to defend the Marines
charged with murder.</P>
<P>Kaffee's colleague and the lead prosecutor is Capt. Jack Ross (Kevin
Bacon) who is extremely convincing in this film and the matching of
court skills between Bacon and Cruise is one of the film's greatest
strengths.  There are no dirty tricks involved between the two in order
for one to win his case.  They are friends through and through the
trial, and this, while not that noticeable at first, is one of the
film's greatest assets.  One scene in a bar during the trial even has
Ross admitting to being Kaffee's friend and he advises Kaffee that his
conduct in court could land him a court-martial.</P>
<P>After reading a plot outline from any description of the film, it would
lead you to believe that 'A Few Good Men' has its share of good guys and
bad guys.  Partly true, and partly false because the characters
perceived to be the villains believe in what they're doing from an
extreme position taken in their military duties and also believe they
aren't guilty of any crime because of their "code" in protecting their
country.</P>
<P>Jack Nicholson's counter parts on the base in Cuba are Lt. Col. Matthew
Markinson (the late J.T. Walsh) and Lt. Jonathan Kendrick (Kiefer
Sutherland), a nasty redneck of a Marine who would probably shoot you if
their was an improper mark on your uniform.  J.T. Walsh is probably the
film's weakest character, not because of his skill as an actor, but
because he is over shadowed by many other popular superstars.</P>
<P>Tom Cruise and Demi Moore are joined by co-counsel Sam Weinberg (Kevin
Pollak) who is the pillar of strength for both of them and a voice of
intelligent reason at the times that are the most tense.  Director Rob
Reiner keeps the film moving at a brisk pace and the film doesn't have a
single boring spot and the screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, based on his
play, isn't full of surprises but is full of snappy dialogue and in the
film's final resolution, Sorkin sets out to resolve what was originally
discussed by the characters earlier in the film.  It's not a
conventional court room drama but one with an off beat texture.  The
most interesting thing about Sorkin's script is that even though the
plot lacks depth, it still requires your full attention as it looks and
feels like putting pieces of a jigsaw puzzle together.</P>
<P>Nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, 'A Few Good
Men' is a film with universal appeal as its main focus isn't only about
finding the truth, it's about the main character, Tom Cruise's lethal
performance as a Navy officer and lawyer, and his willingness to earn
the respect of his peers.  Something we all want.</P>
