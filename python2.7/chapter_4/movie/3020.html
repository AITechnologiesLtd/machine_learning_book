<PRE>                               PULP FICTION
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     PULP FICTION is a fun film with rich philosophical undertones.
Much has been made of its violence, but here the violence plays only a
secondary role (unlike, say, NATURAL BORN KILLERS.)  Only a blue-nose
could find this film anything but funny.</P>
<P>     I am reminded of a play which I know only from the title and a
very brief description: ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD.  This
takes the minor characters from HAMLET and makes them the central
figures; it turns out they have a lot of interesting things to say.</P>
<P>     The Rosencrantz and Guildenstern characters here are two mob hit
men played by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson.  They work their way
through murders, discussing philosophy and religion.  Travolta's
character has a remarkable knack for pursuing an argument to its
logical conclusion, like a philosophy professor; Jackson's character,
however, comes closer to the real point of the movie.</P>
<P>     The point of the movie is the manipulation of these people's lives
by God.  Some are miraculously saved; others are killed through
arbitrary accidents.  Characters meet each other accidentally, leading
to incredible confrontations; they are momentarily inattentive and
die.  In the face of these manipulations some, through strong
character, achieve control over these events and end up going
toe-to-toe with God in influencing the story.</P>
<P>     The real god in this movie is the playwright and director, Quentin
Tarentino, of course.  He shows up in a cute vignette as the wimpy
put-upon friend of Jackson's character.</P>
<P>     There are a number of good performances here.  The most amazing is
that of John Travolta, who has perhaps never been given proper credit
for his earlier roles, where he may have been acting much more than
people realized.  Certainly his character here is complex and deeply
felt.</P>
<P>     Samuel L. Jackson establishes himself here as being able to play a
straight, solid, serious character, which must help him in the future.
After the madness of JUNGLE FEVER and this, he's shown he can play
quite a range of types with great force.</P>
<P>     As always I'm amazed by Bruce Willis's appeal.  He plays the same
character here as always--strong, wise-cracking, etc.--good as ever
if you like him. (Though I don't; I'm always reminded of the "Saturday
Night Live" skit where the truth comes out--he made a deal with the
devil.)</P>
<P>     Uma Thurman plays a role that seems to have been written for
Winona Ryder.  Certainly she looks quite a bit like her, and her
character is more Ryder-esque than Thurman-esque.  She's not bad at it,
but I don't think she added a lot to the role.</P>
<P>     Maria de Medeiros has a sweet and memorable role as Bruce Willis's
girlfriend.  She's quite appealing, and I look forward to seeing her
expand on this character in the future.</P>
<P>     Harvey Keitel plays a somewhat expanded version of his character
from POINT OF NO RETURN.  Here he talks more and has more class (he's
wearing a tux at 8:30 in the morning.)  Nice, but nothing new.</P>
<P>     Eric Stoltz is great as the drug dealer--his panic, etc., is great
comedy.</P>
<P>     Roseanne Arquette does a brief turn as his wife; the glee that
crosses her face in the piercing scene is worth a good fraction of the
price of admission.</P>
<P>     I really liked Christopher Walken's scene.  It's nothing he hasn't
done before, but the story is perfectly told, and the choice of Walken
is just perfect.</P>
<P>     Amanda Plummer goes a little farther into madness this time.  I
see her as getting increasingly typecast, and I feel sorry for her
since I think she has much greater range than she's being given a
chance to exhibit,</P>
