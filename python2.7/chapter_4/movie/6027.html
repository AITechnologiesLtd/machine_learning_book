                       A film review by Alex Fung

<PRE>Me: *** (out of four stars)</PRE>
<PRE>   Note:  Some may consider portions of the following text to
          be spoilers.  Be forewarned.</PRE>
<P>CURDLED is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy, but its
humour won't appeal to everyone.  To be specific, let me give
you an example.  Do you know in PULP FICTION where Jules and
Vincent go on brain detail after Marvin and his head accidentally
get separated?  If you thought that was completely tasteless and
unfunny, don't see CURDLED.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if you found that sequence to be pretty funny,
you have the sense of humour that CURDLED is aimed at.</P>
<P>Our film's heroine, Gabriela, played by Angela Jones, is a woman
obssessively curious about murder and serial killers; she even
keeps a scrapbook of news articles.  Luckily for her, Miami is
being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting
pretty big.</P>
<P>The killer's nickname in the press is The Blue Blood Killer, because
he preys on older rich socialite women, and he's played by William
Baldwin (this is not a spoiler).  One particularly striking M.O. on
the Blue Blood Killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims.</P>
<P>Gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an
advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned
to her interests.  She immediately quits her job, and signs on
with PFCS, which stands for Post-Forensic Cleaning Service.  No
points for guessing what they do.</P>
<P>Her workmates are confused by Gabriela's fascination with murder;
to them, it's just a day job.  There's a hilarious locker room
scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk, and
what they would say.  Gabriela's partner, Elena, played by Mel
Gorham, is particularly perturbed by Gabriela's wide-eyed fascination,
and becomes really upset when Gabriela volunteers them to clean up
The Blue Blood Killer's latest scene - they're the messiest, you see.</P>
<P>Unbeknownst to them, the last victim left something on the scene which
would ID The Blue Blood Killer, so he's also heading over there..</P>
<P>The comparison to PULP FICTION earlier on was not accidental -
Quentin Tarantino executive-produced this film, which began life
as a short film he saw at a film festival.  Apparently Tarantino
was so impressed that he helped Braddock convert this into a
feature-length film.</P>
<P>There are other parallels - the star of CURDLED is Angela Jones
(the top billing goes to William Baldwin, but really, Jones is
the central character), who's probably best known for her role as
Esmerelda Villalobos, the death-obssessed taxi driver in PULP FICTION.
That role was written specifically for Jones based upon her similar
character in the aforementioned short film, CURDLED JR.</P>
<P>Jones is great in CURDLED - she's wonderfully funny and maintains
an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising
her character's innocence or likeability.  She can express so much
with one lift of her eyebrow.  It's a great performance.</P>
<P>Reb Braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever, toeing the
line between black humour and bad taste.  The best scene in the
film is an outrageously funny sequence involves Jones and dancing
- any more than that would be a spoiler.  The opening credit sequence
is also inventive and amusing.  Of course, it's impossible to really
take this stuff seriously, but then again you're not really supposed
to - Braddock knows the audience is in on the joke, and makes it a
fun little romp as a result.</P>
<P>The one drawback of CURDLED is that it was based on a short film, and
it feels like it; the material is just stretched too thin in order to
fulfill a feature length running time, and some parts just seem to drag.
While its running time is already a short 94 minutes, it could really
stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing.</P>
<P>CURDLED seems destined to be a nice cult film for Miramax.  It'll be
interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well.</P>
