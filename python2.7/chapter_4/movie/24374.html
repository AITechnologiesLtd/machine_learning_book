<PRE>Mission to Mars</PRE>
<P>A Postview, copyright 2000 by Paul-Michael Agapow.</P>
<PRE>"Mission to Mars"
Released 2000.
Directed by Brian De Palma.
Starring Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle and (very
briefly) Kim Delaney.</PRE>
<P>A heroic crew struggles to rescue a team of astronauts stranded on
Mars, stopping only for product placement and triumphant fanfares.</P>
<P>It has become traditional with every new Brian De Palma film to
tut-tut about how it's not up to his usual standard.  Which brings to
mind the question: Exactly what is De Palma's usual standard?  "Snake
Eyes"?  "Bonfire of the Vanities"?  Now to build on this history of
failed expectations comes Mission to Mars, a Steinbeckian idiot of a
film that smothers any sense in the script with its desperate clammy
grip.</P>
<P>The setup is this: the year is 2020 and Earth is going to Mars.  Of
course, when I say "Earth" I mean "America", just like when the film
says "international effort", they mean "NASA".  Now, Ray Bradbury
wrote about the small-town America going to Mars, with colonists
building homesteads and sitting on their front porches sipping
lemonade.  In contrast, "Mission to Mars" has a bunch of smug,
laddish, middle-class baby boomers going to Mars.  (I say "baby
boomers" but the characters are of course 30 years too young for the
way they dress, talk and the music they listen to.  I say "laddish"
but there are three female characters: one whose main function is to
fret, one that dies twenty minutes into the film and another who dies
before the film even starts.)  What we have here is "2001" as done by
Ron Howard.  Note: this is not a compliment.</P>
<P>But anyway, Earth is going to Mars.  Unfortunately (for the audience)
the first expedition is composed of Z-list actors and is thus doomed
to be wiped out by a mysterious alien artefact.  (Don't you hate it
when that happens?)  So a rescue mission is mounted DR PEPPER and is
entering Martian KAWASAKI orbit when disaster PENZOIL strikes and
their M&MS ship is BUDWEISER struck by SONY meteorites.  BUY MORE
STUFF. "Put on your helmet or you'll embolize!", worries the
femme-astronaut.  At first I thought it was a warning to the audience,
but it turns out the ship is in danger and mission commander Tim
Robbins is making his big bid to escape the script.  (The plucky
little guy looked kinda peaceful at the end, a happy little smile on
his face as he froze to death.)  The chick panics for a while, they
make a crash-landing on Mars and find the lone survivor.  ("Hey, we're
the rescue team!  Uh, you wouldn't have a spare spaceship lying around
would you?")</P>
<P>As bogus as the first part of the film is, it at least shows some grip
of orbit al mechanics and physics.  By contrast, the biology appears
to have been lifted from "Pokemon".  You see, the aliens have left a
secret message for humans, a message that may only be decoded by
someone who has seen "Contact".  The message turns out to be a DNA
sequence that is "missing a chromosome".  (Two possibilities: 1. 
No-one on the team knows anything about biology, or 2.  The
astronauts' confusion over basic molecular biology is due to NASA's
affirmative action policy on hiring the chromosomally challenged.) 
The astronautrix panics for a while, then concludes that if they fill
in the "missing chromosome", the mysterious alien artefact will usher
the astronauts into a really cool planetarium.  This happens. 
(Although surely it would have been a lot simpler and cheaper for NASA
to just send the guys to the Field Museum for the afternoon.)</P>
<P>The basic goofiness of "Mission to Mars" is compounded by lugheaded
dialogue and direction, with characters explaining what they have just
done or are just about to do, and computers helpfully announcing "AT
POINT OF NO RETURN" or "AIR LEVELS FALLING TO 30 PERCENT".  Note
please this is a film that has three names credited for the "story"
and three more for the "screenplay".  This smacks of writers who did
all their research by watching other movies - "Contact", "The Abyss",
"Apollo 13", "Close Encounters", "2001", "Silent Running" - while
watching the Discovery Channel for flavour.  Add in the strident
soundtrack and gobs of pseudoscience and you have a very unhappy
audience.</P>
<P>I'd describe "Mission to Mars" as dull, dumb and shitheaded but that
would be insulting other dull, dumb and shitheaded films.  It's not
even stupid enough to be fun.  It makes one yearn for the intellectual
thrust and parry of Starship Troopers.  [*/misfire] and that long
empty stretch of road north of Port Augusta on the Sid & Nancy scale.</P>
