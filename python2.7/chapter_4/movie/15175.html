<P>Knock-Off (1998) - Jean-Claude Van Damme, Rob Schneider, Lela Rochon, Paul
Sorvino</P>
<P>   What do you get when you bring together sometimes-memorable action
   star Jean-Claude Van Damme, former "Saturday Night Live" comic genius
   Rob Schneider and the lovely Lela Rochon?</P>
<P>   I'm not sure either, but that particular chaotic mishmash is in
   theaters everywhere under the oddly appropriate title "Knock-Off."</P>
<P>   There is something vaguely resembling a plot, but it's so convoluted
   that any attempt to summarize it would only lead to even more
   confusion. Schneider and Rochon are CIA agents investigating a flood
   of such fine products as "Pumma" sneakers and other cheap copies, or
   knock-offs.</P>
<P>   Van Damme's character figures in there somehow, and so do the Russians
   in a cliched attempted to take over the world. As this film is
   nominally set in 1997, during the return of Hong Kong to China, this
   is just one of many things that utterly defy logic.</P>
<P>   Why would the CIA have people in Hong Kong, investigating a small ring
   of petty thieves?</P>
<PRE>   Isn't the KGB dead?</PRE>
<PRE>   And why should we care?</PRE>
<P>   The actors certainly don't do much to make the audience care. Van
   Damme seems only to be there to crack heads in, showing remarkably
   little personality. Rochon is treated a bit better in her
   action-intense role, but is also stifled in the acting department.
   Schneider manages to show off a bit of his comic talent, whipping out
   the occasional witty one-liner, but that's just not enough to save
   this movie.</P>
<P>   So we're left with gratuitous violence, and at least a noble effort is
   made. Famous Hong Kong director Tsui Hark does the best with what he
   has to work with, using all the tricks that made him famous -
   slow-motion, stop-motion, dizzying camera angles and the occasional
   blur. "Knock-Off" ends up looking like a good Hong Kong film, just
   waiting for Jackie Chan or Chow Yun-Fat to show up.</P>
<P>   They don't show up, of course. All three of the leads do their best,
   and should at least be credited for the effort, no matter how far
   short it may fall of the goal.</P>
<P>   In the end, "Knock-Off" is itself just a knock-off of all the good
   films you could be watching instead. Save the 5 bucks and go rent
   "Hard Boiled" or most any Jackie Chan flick. That way you'll be sure
   of getting the real thing.</P>
