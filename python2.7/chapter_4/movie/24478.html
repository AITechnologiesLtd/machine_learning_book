<P>         Although the movie ``Washington Square'' bears the same title
as Henry James' novel, it takes considerable liberties with the source
material, much in the same way the recent ``Wings of the Dove'' did
with another James novel.</P>
<P>  Carol Doyle's screenplay remodels the character of Catherine
Sloper into something of a fledgling feminist, rather than the meek
and pathetic victim she was in ``The Heiress,'' the popular stage
adaptation by Ruth and Augustus Goetz.</P>
<P>  The transformation works, thanks to a typically edgy
performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh and unfussy direction by Agnieszka
Holland. Despite its turn-of-the-century setting, this retelling of
the story rings with contemporary resonance, and although Doyle has
tweaked the original, particularly with regard to the ending, she has
retained the gist of ``Washington Square.''</P>
<P>  It's still the bittersweet tale of well-to-do, woebegone
Catherine's flirtation with the penniless Morris Townsend (Ben
Chaplin) and her domineering father's (Albert Finney) stringent
objection to it.</P>
<P>  Holland and her production team have created an excellent
example of how to open up a play and make it cinematic by taking the
action out of the Sloper family's parlor and moving it into the
streets of New York, the gardens of high society, the mountains of
Europe and a variety of beautifully evoked locations.</P>
<P>  With her usual abandon, Leigh at first loses herself in
Catherine's gaudy dresses and nervous tics. As the story progresses,
however, the actress lets us see there is considerably more going on
with this girl than first meets the eye.</P>
<P>  Beneath her awkwardness is a hint of a sharp, sly mind at
work, and Doyle allows us to wonder whether Catherine is being used by
Morris or if she is in fact using him to make one final stand against
her father.</P>
<P>  Finney's vivid portrait of Dr. Sloper is one of the actor's
strongest performances since ``Under The Volcano'' 15 years
ago. Throughout the story, Sloper drops potent little bombs on his
graceless daughter's dreams, building up to the devestating moment
when he laments, ``How obscene that your mother should give her life
so that you can inhabit space on this earth.''</P>
<P>  Yet Finney doesn't allow him to sink into either
conventional villainy or melodramatic excess.</P>
<P>  Sloper remains imposing and, even though he's a terrible
father, he isn't entirely heartless. Though he may well be more
concerned with his daughter embarrassing him than shaming herself,
Sloper at least wants to spare her any undue humiliation.</P>
<P>  Chaplin - best known as the love interest in ``The Truth
About Cats and Dogs'' - lends surprising richness and depth to
Morris. Like Leigh, Chaplin is purposefully oblique about Morris'
motives, thus enhancing the drama.</P>
<P>  As played by Maggie Smith, the spinster aunt Lavinia comes
off as being slightly smarter and a trifle more infatuated with Morris
than she was in ``The Heiress.''</P>
<P>  Even so, ``Washington Square'' is ultimately Leigh's show,
and she effortlessly carries the picture. Few other young actresses
have Leigh's knack for quietly exposing tormented souls.</P>
<P>  Her consistently intriguing performance here should sway
those who still have reservations about her, while giving her cult of
admirers one more reason to celebrate her gift.</P>
