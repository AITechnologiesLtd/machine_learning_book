<PRE>                              ANTONIA'S LINE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a film with a lot going for
          it but which is still hard to like because at core
          it is so hypocritical, both in its story and the
          way the distribution has been handled.  This is a
          sweeping film about four generations of women on a
          communal farm overcoming obstacles put in their
          path by sexist men.  Rating: 0 (-4 to +4).  Some
          spoilers in the review.</PRE>
<P>     According to VARIETY, when ANTONIA'S LINE was premiered at Cannes,
"only women buyers and press were allowed into the first screening.
Even the film's male producers were excluded from the good- humored
solidarity screening."  (Please don't confuse this policy with sexism.
This is, of course, a blow for equality of the sexes and should in no
way been seen as justifying anyone else's policy of discrimination by
sex.)  Indeed, ANTONIA'S LINE is a sometimes good-natured, often very
angry story looking at four generations of women running a sort of
communal farm in what is probably Holland or Belgium.  As the film
opens Antonia (Willeke Van Ammelrooy) is an old woman is an old woman
who is still apparently healthy but knows that this is her final day
alive.  In flashback she remembers the preceding forty or fifty years.
The story picks up after World War II when Antonia returns to this
unnamed village, the site of her youth.  With her she brings with her
teenage daughter Danielle (Els Dottermans).  Together they start to run
a farm.  Sebastian, the farmer who runs a neighboring farm expects he
will acquire the two ladies in a manner not unlike the way he acquires
cattle.  In fact, like cattle is how he and his sons treat his own
homely daughter Deedee (Marina De Graaf), showing her off in the local
pub by holding up her breasts to accentuate them.  But when Deedee's
own brother rapes her, it is the Antonia's farm that acquires Deedee.
And so begins the communal farm that takes on all comers willing to
work.  The farm is, of course successful and never has any agricultural
problems.  The only problems we see come from Sebastian's sons.  But
that is only to be expected because men will be men.  Just made that
way, I guess.  Not that all men in the village are bad by any means,
but when there is trouble it is generally caused by a man.  One is
given the impression that if there were no men around everything would
just go swimmingly.</P>
<P>     Danielle decides to have a daughter and has a friend arrange a
one-night stand with a hunk in a local town.  (Please don't confuse
this with the way men use women as sex objects!  This is just an
example of what an unfeeling society forces a woman to do if she wants
to have a man's child but then never see the man again.)  The product
of this union and enlightened child-rearing techniques is a child who
is both a brilliant mathematician and a composer of music.  There are
more problems (including another rape) to come.  But through it all
tolerance and enlightened thinking are more than a match for any
problem that arises.  Before we are done there are four generations of
women on the successful farm.</P>

<P>     The makeup design by Jan Sewell is terrific.  Antonia ages forty
or fifty years in the course of the film and yet one never doubts that
she is the age she is playing at the moment.  The same goes for other
women in the film.  I would be very curious to the actual age of the
various actresses.  I suspect they must be young because it is easier
to make a young person look old than an old person look young.  The
acting must be good because it takes more than makeup to make these
people look the right age.  The casting is also very good with people
who look like people you might find in such a town.</P>
<P>     This is a film that I tried very hard to like but there is just
too much sanctimony here.  This is a film with strong virtues, but at
heart there is also a lot of sexism here.  It is really hard to respect
a film that condemns sexism on one hand while practicing it on the
other.  I guess on balance I would give it a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
