<PRE>                                 EXOTICA
                       A film review by Edgar Sommer
                        Copyright 1994 Edgar Sommer</PRE>
<PRE>A film by Atom Egoyan 
(Canada, 1994)</PRE>
<P>     The Exotica is a nightclub on the outskirts of Toronto, where
Eric, DJ and sort of MC/animateur, watches nightly as his ex-girlfriend
Christina performs.  Watches jealously, especially as far as the extra
attentions regular customer Thomas (or Francis?) garners are
concerned.  Francis (or Thomas?), meanwhile and erstwhile, goes through
a series of, um, interesting situations involving his pet shop, a gruff
taxi-sharing stranger, unexpected tickets to the opera and smuggled
eggs of some rare bird.</P>
<P>     Multiple story lines unfold in a splendid tangle of cutbacks,
forward and backward references and recurring themes, all woven around
the Exotica, its customers and the people who work and live there.</P>
<PRE>What struck me was, in random order:</PRE>
<PRE>        - The atmosphere in the night club: less sleazy than you
        might expect, almost comfortable (don't quote me on this).</PRE>
<PRE>        - The depth of the characters: ick, what a cliche, but
        it struck me. What can you do? The nightclub owner,
        for example, I found at times & simultaneously appealing
        and repulsive and a black box, and sexy and neurotic,
        and I wish I lived next door and we could have arguments
        once in a while and take turns watching the kids.</PRE>
<PRE>        - The ability of several characters to talk about
        things, to utter phrases, that would normally have me
        squirming in the seat with empathetic shame, wishing I
        were somewhen else, without causing me to do so in the
        least.</PRE>
<PRE>        - The light.</PRE>
<PRE>        - The colors, their cornedness, you know like blowups of
        old photographs.</PRE>
<PRE>        - The music.</PRE>
<PRE>        - The music! The credits hint that some of it was
        recorded in Bombay; I believe it & approve most deeply.</PRE>
<PRE>        - The plot as such, and manner in which it is conveyed.
        I shall not begin to attempt--just go see it.</PRE>
<P>     This is a calm roller-coaster ride of a movie, if that makes any
sense to you, visually and plot-wise (plot-wise indeed) and
intriguingly and emotionally and acoustically moving.</P>
<PRE>     My wife thought it was quite good, too, thanks.</PRE>
<P>     Rating? What rating? See the most excellent Internet Movie
Database at <A HREF="http://www.cm.cf.ac.uk/Movies/moviequery.html">http://www.cm.cf.ac.uk/Movies/moviequery.html</A> for all that
technical stuff.</P>
