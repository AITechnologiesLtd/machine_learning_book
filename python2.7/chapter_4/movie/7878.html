<PRE>                                  SERIAL MOM
                       A film review by David Wilcock
                        Copyright 1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<P>Here we have another watered down John Waters film. While his earlier
films were, frankly, digusting (see Pink Flamingos) after Hairspray
(1987) his films generally toned down quite a bit. So although this
does have a few gross things in it, theres nothing here that will make
you physically sick.</P>
<P>Turner plays a mom who cares about her family. A lot. in fact, if you
say anything nasty about them, she'll probably kill you. So, a lot of
murders are going on in her town, and gradually the police narrow down
the murderer to her.</P>
<P>The films deaths are actually quite funny, and Turner gives a good
performance as the murderous mother. Also, the film isn't very long
(just over 90 mins) so it isn't one of those films that go on for
another 30 mins even though they've ran out of jokes. It is directed
well enough, and the supporting cast (which includes Ricki Lake) are
good.  In fact, it is the strengh of the cast that makes this film much
funnier than it really ought to be. Overall, enjoyable, trashy fun.</P>
