<PRE>                                CARRINGTON
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Production values are absolutely
          first rate, but the story is worthy of Harold
          Robbins.  This is a true story populated with
          supposed geniuses, but we learn little about them
          except about their sex lives.  With this budget,
          Emma Thompson, and Jonathan Pryce, somebody should
          have asked if this story was really worth the
          telling. Rating: 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     This is the true story of a woman who made all her own choices.
She chose to love a man who (in addition to being much older and a bit
repulsive) was gay and could not give her a sexual relationship.  She
chose her lovers, ruining their lives.  Yet she still ended unhappy
because a gay man could not love her back the way she wanted.  It seems
to be the point of view of the film that we should feel very sorry for
Dora Carrington.  But you know, life is tough.  In spite of the best
efforts of the filmmaker to make Carrington a sympathetic character
there is roughly 98% of humanity more deserving of sympathy.  And the
tears that some audience members shed for her could have been much
better spent.</P>
<P>     Dora Carrington (played by Emma Thompson) is a young but very
promising art student when she first meets Lytton Strachey (Jonathan
Pryce).  Strachey is a most disagreeable and self-centered man.  For
reasons never really shown in the film Carrington falls in love with
him.  Their relationship is mostly platonic since Strachey is gay and
not interested in sex with her.  However at this point in life
Carrington is not interested in sex at all, so his orientation is nota
problem.  That will change.  It is to be presumed that their
relationship is on a higher and more intellectual plane, though
writer/director Christopher Hampton does painfully little to us show
this.  Later when Carrington decides that she does like sex after all,
she takes a husband to whom both she and Strachey are attracted and
apparently tries to make up for lost time.  Even more fascinated by sex
as she gets older, Carrington takes multiple lovers including her
husband's best friend.  She apparently has the looks to attract men and
is little fettered by contemporary (1930s) morality or even decency.</P>
<P>     In all this time we see little of Carrington's supposed intellect.
Hampton shows us far more of her body than we see of her mind.  Her
talent for painting seems to be channeled mostly into home decoration.
Her attraction to Strachey is never explained since he seems to have
the sex appeal of an old book consumed by mildew.  His conversations
are more cutting than clever.  Through the middle of the film nearly
every scene seems to concern in some way the sex lives of the
characters.</P>
<P>     Much of CARRINGTON seem well photographed, though at times there
are disturbing and obvious shifts in filters giving some scenes a
disagreeable yellow tint.  The directing and acting are quite up to
what you would expect for the prestige production this was intended to
be.  Jonathan Pryce gives an appealing portrait of a most unappealing
character.  Emma Thompson never gives a bad performance, but did not
noticeably show us anything new in her acting besides a willingness to
take her clothes off.  She shows us too much of the flesh of Dora
Carrington and not enough of the person.</P>
<P>     I saw this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival.  It had already
won a Special Jury Prize and a Best Actor Award to Pryce at Cannes.  I
had high expectations and I certainly expected better than what was
basically a Harold Robbins sort of sex story, only set in the first
third of the century and made with high production values.  I cannot
rate this higher than a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
