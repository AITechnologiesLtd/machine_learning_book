<P>KISS THE GIRLS (Paramount)Directed by Gary Fleder</P>
<P>Based on James Patterson's best-seller, "Kiss The Girls" comes on like an
intelligent, intense psychological thriller, and for about half an hour you
might suspect you've found the new "Silence of the Lambs," or "Seven '97."
But like a good-looking blind date who promises dinner and a movie, then
takes you to Burger King and "Wishmaster," the spell dissipates quickly,
leaving you feeling seduced and abandoned.</P>
<P>Put the blame partially on Patterson and screenwriter David Klass.  After
an arresting set-up involving a voyeur who kidnaps bright young women and
imprisons them in an underground lair, the story turns into a flat
combination of John Fowles' "The Collector" and "Silence," with scraps of
the far-superior "Copycat" thrown in to no good effect. Morgan Freeman,
excellent as always, plays Dr. Alex Cross, a forensic psychologist from
Washington D.C. who travels to Durham, N.C. to probe the disappearance of
his niece. Down South he runs into snickering cracker cops (are there any
other kind in second-rate movies?) who try to give him the brush-off, and
Cross, despite being hundreds of miles outside of his jurisdiction,
determines to investigate the kidnapping personally.</P>
<P>That's just the first of many incredulities the audience is asked to
swallow. Even more improbably, Cross teams up with a civilian, a doctor
named Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd) who's the only victim to have escaped
from this covetous captor, who identifies himself as "Casanova." The
multi-layered relationship that appears to be developing between Cross and
McTiernan is by far the most original and intriguing aspect of "Kiss The
Girls," but the movie largely ignores it, choosing instead to trot out the
usual cat-and-mouse games and an anti-climactic trip through a haunted
house that's hauntingly similar--and inferior to--the finale of "Silence."
 Only the charisma of Freeman and Judd (who's rapidly developing into a
reliably solid performer) keeps the movie afloat and the audience awake,
since the excellent supporting cast (Cary Elwes, Jeremy Piven, Tony
Goldwyn, etc) is woefully underutilized. Cross' frequent snafus make you
wonder what this man is doing calling himself a cop, but Freeman's poise
and intelligence allows you to give the guy the benefit of the doubt.
Though McTiernan is called upon to behave almost as recklessly and
unconvincingly, Judd gives the woman a daunting sense of conviction.
 "Kiss" is further hobbled by the
look-at-me-I-just-got-out-of-film-school style of director Gary Fleder
("Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead"), whose motto seems to be "when
in doubt, shoot it with a jiggly hand-held camera." Several scenes in the
film also feature pointless slow-motion, the trademark of many a desperate
director, and those who like to spot continuity flaws will marvel at how
McTiernan's scarred face heals almost overnight and how Cross emerges from
a dunking in a well with remarkably dry clothing.
