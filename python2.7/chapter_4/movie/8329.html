                            MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING
                          A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1997) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Julia Roberts made the world love her back in 1990 with 
PRETTY WOMAN, but since then she's been in eight consecutive 
bad movies. DYING YOUNG, MARY REILLY and I LOVE 
TROUBLE hardly rank in the annals of filmed entertainment. It was 
only at the end of 1996 in Woody Allen's EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE 
YOU that she seemed like America's sweetheart once again. But no 
one besides me watches Woody Allen movies anymore; it's going to 
take a far inferior, watered-down romantic comedy to return her to 
public graces again.</P>
<P>        My guess is, MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING will be 
Julia's big comeback vehicle. She's got her big permed hair and lips 
fuller than ever, but even more important, she looks happy again. 
No mad Doctor Jekyll to deal with this time, just a wedding to break 
up. She's on a romantic mission that involves chicanery and 
deception, and the breaking up of a happy couple, but because she's 
Julia Roberts with her gracious beauty and awkward charm, we love 
her character anyway.</P>
<P>        Julia plays a food critic for a newspaper, probably the only 
anorexic food critic ever (although she can recommend the best 
lettuce leaf and Tic Tac in the city), who has been as of yet 
unsuccessful in her quest for a man. The two most important men in 
her life are her Stallone-faced best friend and her gay editor. It's an 
implausible movie -- I mean, how could any man spend time around 
Julia Roberts and still be gay? -- but still a mildly appealing 
diversion with cast of beautiful people on both sides of the fence.</P>
<P>        The best friend is played by not-so-young gun Dermot 
Mulroney, who was once involved with Julia but now plans to marry 
Cameron Diaz. Good choice. Diaz plays an eternally-perky college 
student who immediately tries to make Julia into her best friend as 
well. Julia instantly hates her, of course, which provides the 
interesting scene where Julia makes Cameron sing in a karaoke bar 
and she's so off-key that everyone loves her. Off-key isn't always 
bad; Alanis sold 12 million albums.</P>
<P>        Yes, the marriage setup is an excuse for Julia to be rude, 
manipulative, sneaky and just plain mean once she realizes she's in 
love with Mulroney herself. Like I said, we love every second of it, 
because seeing Julia in the not-so-innocent roles brings the most 
comedic reward. She's got that innocent yet worldwise quality that 
made her a charming hooker in PRETTY WOMAN, and it still works 
here. It would have been better to stick with the premise and break 
convention, but the ending is completely sappy and predictable.</P>
<P>        It's the sap and predictability that keeps MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING from being more than pretty good. The 
writing follows the track we'd expect, giving us a handful of truly 
funny jokes and only a couple memorable scenes like the "Say a 
Prayer" sing-along sequence in the restaurant. The rest of the time it 
relies too heavily on Roberts to fall off the bed, accidentally rip her 
dress, knock things over, and so on. We love you, Julia, but your 
name isn't Lucy.</P>
