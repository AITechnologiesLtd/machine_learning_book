<PRE>Léon (The Professional)
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>It's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the
original director's cut of the film.  Films such as Aliens, The Abyss,
The Wild Bunch, Blade Runner, and Terminator 2 are all prime examples of
a filmmaker's integrity, later chopped up or mucked with by the studio. 
The advent of the DVD format has provided a more accessible way to get
these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself
the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such
classic films.</P>
<P>The DVD release of the original international version of Luc Besson's
1995 masterpiece The Professional, which is known as Léon around the
world, is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant
classic as a director's cut.  For years, I have heard of an
"international" version available only in laserdisc format, which has
eluded me for years.  I even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle Don
for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors' cuts - including Léon. 
But after countless searches in laserdisc stores, I could never find
it.  Until now.</P>
<P>The film follows the story of Léon, played by Jean Reno, a professional
hit man for an Italian Mob crew run by Danny Aiello.  He lives next door
to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named Mathilda - played by
then newcomer Natalie Portman, whose father is involved in drugs and
crooked cops.  One day, a crew of the cops - lead by Gary Oldman in an
over-the-top performance - kills her entire family while Mathilda is out
buying groceries.  Taking pity on her, Léon hides her in his apartment
when she returns to save her life.  Mathilda learns of Léon's hit man
profession and decides to follow in Léon's footsteps as a "cleaner." 
She then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within
Léon he has kept locked away as part of his profession.  At this point,
the differences in the American version and the International version
really kick in.</P>
<P>The International version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage
that pertains directly to the relationship of Léon and Mathilda, footage
that American censors deemed "too explicit."  I assume that American
censors feel that defining character development is too much for
American audiences to handle.  The best part of this extra footage is
that gives better understanding of both Mathilda's and Léon's
motivations pertaining to later actions involving Oldman and his crew of
bad cops.  There's even a previously unseen cameo by the great French
actor Jean-Hugues Anglade - star of Queen Margot, Besson's La Femme
Nikita, and Killing Zoe.  With these additional scenes replaced, Léon
and Matilda's relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and
draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the
American version.</P>
<P>The most ironic thing about the International version of the film is
that with the inclusion of the missing scenes, the film becomes
primarily a heavy, emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at
the beginning and the end of the film.  The film betters reflects the
serious drama of French cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the
brutality of American cinema.</P>
<P>My advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of The
Professional, throw down twenty bucks, and pick up this newly restored
cinematic masterpiece.</P>
