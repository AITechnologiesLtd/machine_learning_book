<PRE>A BETTER TOMORROW (1986)
(YIN HUANG BOON SIK)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Few people in the history of film had the honour of an
entire subgenre or filmmaking style being made after them.
John Woo, first Hong Kong filmmaker to continue successful
career in Hollywood, is one of those precious few. In late
1980s and early 1990s he made a series of action films that
managed not only to redefine the genre but also to bring
global respect and admiration to previously overlooked Hong
Kong cinema. In previous decades John Woo was undoubtedly
one of the most influential filmmakers, at least judging by
the multitudes of action-oriented filmmakers who tried to
recreate his style in their films. Although Woo had directed
before, there is a single point in his career when all the
elements of his formula came into place. That point is A
BETTER TOMORROW, 1986 action film that brought him his first
major success and later paved the way for other Hong Kong
directors willing to explore similar avenues of filmmaking.
It is understandable why A BETTER TOMORROW is now often
referenced as "The movie that began it all".</P>
<P>Plot of the film revolves about two brothers. The older is
Ho Tse Sung (played by Ti Lung), gangster who runs smooth
and successful counterfeit operation with his trusted aide
and friend Mark Lee (played by Chow Yun Fat). The younger is
Kit (played by Leslie Cheung), graduate of Hong Kong police
academy and blissfully unaware of the true nature of his
brother's business. Ho's routine business trip to Taiwan
starts the series of violent and tragic events that would
shatter his life and family - while Ho himself gets ambushed
and forced to turn himself to the police, his ailing father
gets killed in botched kidnapping attempt by rival gang.
Three years later Ho is out of prison and doesn't want
anything but to live an honest life and reunite with the
brother. But this is harder than he had ever imagined - Kit
blames him for the death of their father and apparent
failure of his own police career, while his former
employers, including Mark, crippled while conducting a
retribution raid three years ago, want him back in their
organisation. Kit, on the other hand, starts his own
investigation on counterfeiters, this time led by new young
and ruthless boss Shing (played by Waisee Lee), and Ho is
forced to choose sides in a violent confrontation that is
about to begin.</P>
<P>The formula for movies most usually associated with John Woo
- gangster setting, choreographed violence, themes of male
bonding combined with sentimentality - was comprised of the
elements present in previous films, albeit made in cinema
industries other than Hong Kong. Apart from Hollywood as
most obvious source of inspiration, John Woo's films were
influenced by French gangster films of Jean-Pierre Melville
and Jose Giovanni. Woo pays tribute to those films by
dressing his gangster protagonists in long trenchoats,
similar to those worn by Alain Delon's character in
Melville's SAMOURAI. Choreographed violence, on the other
hand, can be attributed to the influence of great Sam
Peckinpah and his disciple Walter Hill, two men usually
referred as the best action directors until John Woo era.
However, Woo creates something original out of those foreign
elements by putting them in the very specific context of
Hong Kong - place with ethical codes, culture and moral
alignments are slightly different than in the West. For
example, the line that separates legitimate business from
organised crime is much more blurred, and this was even
reflected in this film; drinking incident, referred by Ho
and Mark, was allegedly based on real-life adventures of
Hong Kong film producer who got too close with the wrong
people. Even the title of the film has ironic twist,
considering A BETTER TOMORROW was made eleven years before
Chinese take-over - event that had apocalyptic meaning for
many citizens of Hong Kong, including Woo. Because of that,
A BETTER TOMORROW is at times very dark and melancholic film
- which later became an important part of John Woo's
formula.</P>
<P>Being the first film, of course, meant that some elements of
that particular formula weren't exactly polished. The script
was simple and tight, yet almost ruined by using few
completely unnecessary characters, like Kit's girlfriend or
Taiwanese police inspector (played by Woo himself). The
musical score by Ka Fai-Koo at first sounds very corny, but
after a while becomes quite adequate for this kind of films.
Woo displays his skills in few very effective action scenes
- the best of them is hit in the restaurant that combines
slow-motion with explosive actions and lots of fake blood.
The actors are great, especially Ti Lung as world-weary
gangster and Cheung as his neurotic brother, but the show
was stolen by the actor who played supporting character.
Chow Yun Fat displays whole variety of talent in his
portrayal of Mark - at first he is cocky, almost comical;
later in the film he is pathetic wreck of his former self.
We seldom have opportunity to watch character who is "cool"
and vulnerable in the same time. It is hardly surprising
that the same actor appeared in the sequel of this film few
years later, this time established as Hong Kong's top movie
star. In the end, even those who don't particularly like
John Woo and Hong Kong cinema would probably agree that A
BETTER TOMORROW was a title quite fitting for this film.</P>
