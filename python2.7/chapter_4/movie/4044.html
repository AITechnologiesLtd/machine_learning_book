<PRE>                                    SEVEN
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Would somebody turn on the lights already?  Geez ... in the
nameless city that is the setting of SEVEN, it seems you can only get a
ten-watt bulb, and that's when the power works at all.  I liked the
film, but with the constant thunderclouds, rain, and shadows, it's
terribly difficult to tell what's going on.</P>
<P>     The title refers to the Seven Deadly Sins--and a serial killer who
is planning to knock off one "evil person" for each vice.  The first to
go is "gluttony," an obese man whom the killer force-feeds until he
pops.  And trust me, after that, it only gets worse.</P>
<P>     On the case is veteran detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and
new-to-town Mills (Brad Pitt).  After 30 minutes of wry chit-chat, the
pair finally get down to business, as two more victims are found.
After that, it's a perfectly choreographed game of cat and mouse,
culminating in a horrific finale that will have you on the edge of your
seat.  I won't reveal the identity of the killer, but I will say he's
very well cast.</P>
<P>     The story (written by schlock horror veteran Andrew Kevin Walker)
is excellent.  Some unfortunate problems get in the way, especially the
constant lack of light and the use of quick-image shock photography,
which make things all the harder to follow.  But I suppose with Pitt
sleepwalking through the opening of the film, at least that gives you
something to watch instead of his droll acting.  I guess when he breaks
his hand (both the character and Pitt himself) during the movie's
dynamic foot chase, the adrenaline finally starts to flow, and Pitt
appears much more alive.</P>
<P>     Also, while the "suspense" is great, watch out for the
touchy-feely family scenes with Mrs. Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the
occasional soliloquies the characters get into about the nightmares of
city life and the evils of the world.  None of this is very well done,
but it is rather important to the film, and thankfully, there's always
another gruesome murder around the corner to distract us.</P>
<P>     Despite its faults, SEVEN remains a worthwhile and very watchable
film, but don't look for a lot of deep social commentary.  Lean back,
peer into the darkness, oh, and hold on to your popcorn and your date
exceptionally tight when they get to "sloth."</P>
