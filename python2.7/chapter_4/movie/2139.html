<PRE>                            THE AGE OF INNOCENCE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Martin Scorsese's adaptation of the
     Edith Wharton novel is like a beautiful, detailed painting of
     an entire period, yet it remains static and uninvolving.  The
     characters seem to be all bland and mostly convention-bound.
     By the time we can work up any pathos for the principals, it
     is too late.  Rating: low +1 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     Somehow one of the last things we would have expected from Martin
Scorsese is is a foray into the Merchant-Ivory territory of adapting the
early-20th Century social novel.  That is exactly the field he is entering
with THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, but his results are of mixed quality.  He has
created a beautiful recreation of 1870s New York City high society and the
bloodlessness that it required from its denizens, but in doing that so well,
he has created characters that it is hard to care very much for and their
story is considerably less engaging as a result.</P>
<P>     The story is of a love triangle that flies in the face of he
conventions of society.  Daniel Day-Lewis plays Newland Archer, a handsome
and intelligent young lawyer engaged to May Welland, a lovely childlike
woman played by Winona Ryder.  Newland meets and is struck by May's cousin,
Countess Ellen Olenska (played by Michelle Pfeiffer).  The Countess is
rebounding from the scandal of having left her husband, a Polish Count, but
upper-class society will not let her forget her past.  Newland slowly
realizes that he really loves the countess and that she loves him, but he
cannot decide if he is willing to fly in the face of convention.  And for
roughly two hours of screentime this latter-day Hamlet remains indecisive.
Certainly things happen in that time, but this heart of the story does not
advance until it is over.</P>
<P>     What we get in that static two hours is a beautiful depiction of
society in that time and place.  Lavish detail shows us what parties were
like, what food was eaten at lavish social dinners, what table arrangement
there was, what the streets looked like (though many of the exteriors had
unconvincing matte paintings that called attention to themselves).  Watching
this film reminded me a lot of my visit to the Victoria and Albert Museum in
London.  A segment of society is perfectly preserved in this film.</P>
<P>     The visuals, however, are almost unused in telling the story.  This
story is almost literally a novel on film.  The story is told in words in
dialog and narration.  The narration is by Joanne Woodward, and is said to
be a late enhancement to clarify the plotline after editing the film down to
136 minutes.  In any case this is a film that genuinely requires
concentration on the dialog and a good memory for character names.  There
are a lot of characters in the book and Jay Cocks and Martin Scorsese did
not pare them down by many in the screenplay.  The film boasts an impressive
cast including Richard E. Grant, Alec McCowan, Geraldine Chaplin (could this
be a sly nod to plot similarities in DR. ZHIVAGO?), Mary Beth Hurt, Sian
Phillips, Michael Gough, Alexis Smith, Jonathan Pryce, and Robert Sean
Leonard.</P>
<P>     Notable also is another great opening credit sequence by the master
photographer of such sequences, Saul Bass (and Elaine Bass).  Saul Bass is
the Michelangelo of film credit sequences.</P>
<P>     There is a lot that works in THE AGE OF INNOCENCE and a few very basic
and important aspects that fail.  This is an accurate adaptation of a
classic novel not well suited to film adaptation.  My rating would be a low
+1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
