<P>Like another film from last year, BURNT BY THE SUN, this one has to travel
through an area where sentiments are not comfortable to get its point
across. But unlike BURNT BY THE SUN which has irresistible charm in the form
of a young girl, this film has to live and die by how well it can convey a
sense of humanity in what otherwise is really a bad conflict, in an area
where the outsiders can rarely win in the first place.</P>
<P>But the price, the locals have to pay, is real sad, and terribly destructive
for all the parties concerned.</P>
<P>A group of Russian soldiers are ambushed in the Chenchen region, and two men
survive. The apparent reason for the attack seems to be a certain
Abdul-Mourant, who has decided to take the war in his own hands, since the
Russians are keeping his son in jail. He hopes to trade the two prisoners
for his son.  And the Russian contingent, does not seem interested in
parlaying a peace, and neither does it seem interested in seeing that the
older man gets to see his son.  By now, the Russian men in charge have
become complacent and couldn't careless about the war. They have the guns
and the power, and they probably figure that they can clean house at any
moment they feel like.</P>
<P>The two prisoners seem to do well, despite having a bad start. One is
aggressive, and the other a young one who failed to fire a shot in the
ambush. They befriend a young girl, Dina - Abdul's daughter, who takes care
of them and brings them food and water. And it is in the end Dina who really
has helped create the only level headed decision, going into the last minute
of the film. The hope is that her plight and goal will last and survive, for
Dina is much better centered than all of them.</P>
<P>In the middle of the film, one of the prisoners, the aggressive captain,
decides that he wants to escape, and he does so, and they survive, with the
exception that they do not know where they are going. He makes the mistake
of killing a shepherd, and this brings about a change in the film's
direction and a serious problem for Abdul. The town wants the prisoners
killed, or gotten rid of, as they are a walking problem.  But others have
better ideas. The rebels want to use the two Russians to find the field
mines and disarm them, which they do.</P>
<P>And in between, one comes to find that some locals are not happy either. One
has a son in the Russian army, stationed in town. And this elder is ashamed
that his own son is turning against the town's own people. And the old man's
indiscretion gets Abdul's son killed, and places the film in a terrible
dilemma.</P>
<P>The villagers have gotten even with the prisoner that killed the shepherd.
They killed him in the same spot. But the young soldier, has been a man of
peace, for the most part and has not displayed anything violent... he has
befriended Dina nicely, and he probably wishes that they would have had a
chance though she is young, but as Dina says, "around here they marry off
very young". Abdul, takes his last prisoner to the top of a mountain where
he will kill him... and in the film's turnabout ending, Abdul misses the
shot on purpose and goes home. His own personal war is over. He has lost his
son, but this young man is not the cause or the reason for the conflict. And
a new reason has been uplifted. But sadly, the film hints that the Russian
military leaders have other reasons in mind, as we see four bombing
helicopters fly over their very own, and not pick him up.</P>
<P>The innocent get screwed, in a puzzle and game, that in the end is
meaningless, and can only bring about hate and destruction..... story has it
that Boris Yeltsin saw this movie and immediately signed a pact to end the
war and help the region..</P>
<P>Based on a Tolstoy novel, this adaptation came around at the right time, and
brought about a point.</P>
<P>The film is very good, and has some very beautiful moments, specially in the
way that it displays the cultures through its own music. The Russian styles
are almost, by comparison, stupid and are seen through the prisoners minds
when they hear their Russian songs. But right after it, we often hear the
Moslem tinged musical style that the region has, and its power is much more
evident than the words in the Russian songs.</P>
<P>Full of beautiful cinematography, and moments, this is a very good film, and
really deserving of an Oscar nomination. But it fits into the category of
the films like Burnt by the Sun, as an anti war film, that really destroys
innocent lives needlessly. Still, it is strong, and well done.</P>
<P>Nice performances, and magnificent moments. Dina is excellent. As are Abdul
and Hassan's characters. The two soldiers come off as childish next to them.
But it is clear that this is just the way it is.</P>
<PRE>Nice film.</PRE>
