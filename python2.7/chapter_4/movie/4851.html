<PRE>                             SECRET CEREMONY
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>     A list of loony tune movies out of the 60s wouldn't be complete
without Joseph Losey's SECRET CEREMONY. The 11th Hour psycho craze had
already started ebbing by the time prostie Elizabeth Taylor and
unhinged, rich waif Mia Farrow pretended to be mother and daughter,
with Robert Mitchum sniffing around as a nubilphile stepdaddy. But the
shock of Liz -- double chinned, teeth eaten away by the booze, in
Woolworth black pajama-like blouse and skirt, legged in diamond-shaped
mesh stockings -- on her way to St. Mary Magdeline Church to pray after
apparently fellating a john and then heading towards the church's
cemetery to drop flowers on her daughter's grave, with wacky Mia
trailing her, delusionally believing Liz is her own mother come back
from the dead,is just too irresistibly bad not to get suckered in.</P>
<P>     Adapted by George Tabori from an award-winning short story by
Argentinean Marco Denevi, SECRET CEREMONY was at first a vehicle for
Ingrid Bergman, who wanted to make in South America. Difficulties with
rights and other factors intervened, and it's our loss, because, one
surmises, Bergman probably wanted a stab at "magic unrealism," which is
the territory the original story seem to be headed. Under Tabori, and
Losey's dullard's cool, it has become a crash course on pseudo Henry
Jamesion schizophrenia, molestation and a mother's love gone bonkers.
Throw in Dames Peggy Ashcroft and Pamela Brown as "slightly Jewish" dyke
kleptos for good measure and it all becomes a comedic 60s freakfest. We'll
never know what Bergman would have allowed; with Liz, any pretensions
toward refinements were put on the back burner and what's cookin' is a
meal of mockery, debasement and sexual peccadilloes. She serves up one
deliciously bad entree after another: every moment she's in she's so
over-seasoned that watching her could cause a fast track to the toilet.
But she's a shitcan kind of actress anyway -- blowing out lines and facial
reactions that only the trisulfide of matches could dissipate. One of the
worst sequences she's ever had as an actress is here: dressed in a grape
juice lavender suit to hide her bulging tummy and flabby ass cheeks
(Mitchum's Albert calls her "a cow"), she warns Ashcroft and Brown to quit
their heisting at Mia's mansion or she'll "cig the cops" on them. You
can't quite be sure if Lousy, I mean Losey allowed Liz her various bad
accents, her awful inflections and readings, because it would be best to
leave well enough alone -- this movie being one of the few in which the
world's most famous movie star never caused any trouble -- or if he
thought that what's transpiring is supposed to this terribly funny. There
is, to be sure, intentional satire: Liz has the queenly first name of
Leonora, but we hee-hee at her last: Grabowski. She's a blond when
prostituting but in natural dark when washing out her mouth and on a bus
on her way to church. The quintessence of self-ridicule is when, roughly
twenty minutes into the movie, Mia, calling Liz "mummie," serves
breakfast. Stuffing her face with sausages and croissants, belching
afterwards, it's got to be Liz deprecating, because if it were anything
else, we'd all die from the embarrassment. </P>
<P>     After we get to know famous actors' acting styles, in most cases
we end up unavoidably "seeing" their duplication of technique; we see in
their performances a laziness, a reliance on what worked in the past,
using tricks and methods we reluctantly accept out of fondness. And no
celebrated star as actress has been more guilty of laziness than Liz. Out
of the MGM School of Acting, Liz knows how to hits her marks and play
scenes, as opposed to playing a sustained characterization. I don't think
she has ever been totally successful as an adult character, not even in
WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, in which she has about a half dozen of
cinema's greatest bitchouts. Part of this has to do with her lack of
training, part of it her own limitations, part of it directors afraid of
her fame and its accompanying power. Most of it has to do with Liz's own
use of fame: she does what she pleases because she is Liz. Her string of
flops after WOOLF? -- including SECRET CEREMONY -- are no one's fault but
hers; she took the millions and in the process lost millions of viewers.
People got tired of seeing her in roles she was too old for (THE TAMING OF
THE SHREW, THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN) and too young for (BOOM!), and most
especially got fed up with her variations of Martha: in BOOM!, SECRET
CEREMONY and, though she's as her most zesty and audience-pleasing vulgar,
X, Y AND ZEE. She got so lazy as an actress that she accepted herself in
movies she clearly shouldn't have done: HAMMERSMITH IS OUT, the abominable
DIVORCE HIS; DIVORCE HERS, NIGHT WATCH, THE MIRROR CRACK'D. Even if it's a
dressup fantasy, ASH WEDNESDAY has a few scenes in which the old Liz magic
of "scene playing" is on display: looking more beautiful than one can
imagine, she dances with butched up (well, as butch as possible) Helmut
Berger and you can really feel her apprehensions. To her credit, Liz has
never been afraid of doing the controversial: CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF,
SUDDENLY, LAST SUMMER, WOOLF?, as well as the way off offbeat stuff --
REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE, SECRET CEREMONY and THE DRIVER'S SEAT. She
was onto something daring, onto modern madness in SEAT, about a woman bent
on having someone kill her, but she needed a director who knew what a
movie should look like, and how to frame the subject. (It's appalling, but
that's what makes it watchable.) For SECRET CEREMONY, Losey decided to let
Liz look as seedy as the story and as seedy as he looked (see pictures of
him in Michel Ciment's CONVERSATION WITH LOSEY), and while more effective
today because the movie's a curiosity piece, he'd have gotten more out of
his star had he curbed her swaying delineation: she's all over the place,
grabbing bits of Martha's shrew for this scene, faking two or three
accents for that scene, going for a displaced glamour when everything else
fails. She looks fat, but seems the smallest, most inconsequential against
skinny Mia.</P>
<P>     Farrow is absolutely terrific as the deranged nubile with the
nail-scratching-against-the-blackboard name of Cenci who may or may not be
a vixen - a fruitcake bi-Peter Pan trapped in permanent adolescence. I can
recall that when I first saw the movie, I was turned off by her; maybe I
couldn't get passed the fact that she could never be Frank Sinatra's wife.
(Ava Gardner's famous quip still resonates: "I always knew Frank would end
up in bed with a little boy.") In fact, the marriage was in deep trouble
during the movie's filming, so this could be one of those "lose myself"
roles as form of protection; whatever it is, it works. She's a marvel at
every turn: she's instant bananas when she sits down next to Liz on the
bus; she's eerily uncomfortable to us when she's brushing Mummie's hair
and could be attempting to put the make on her; and again she unnerves us
when she joins Liz in a post-CLEOPATRA bathtub; she has just the right
teasing ambiguity playing games with stepdaddy Mitchum; she's
indescribably perfect feigning rape and pregnancy; she's flesh crawling
when rubbing Liz's back; and she pulls out all the sedated
dementia-in-full-bloom stops to achieve her finale -- not unexpected but
very effective. If SECRET CEREMONY eventually becomes  a cult classic --
and it could -- it will be Mia who gets the credit: here's a lunatic eager
for sin.</P>
<P>     In his leprechaun beard, great swagger (which Brown and Ashcroft
have fun mimicking) and boozy W.F. Buckley face, Robert Mitchum's a rather
subdued roue, a stepfather who casually dismisses incest as "a rather
boring symptom of the private property system." He can never give a
permanent address because he's always on the run from the law, chasing him
down over his inability to keep his hands off female students. When
Mitchum signed on to do the role of Albert, he said Losey and Tabori did
"some weird things with that script. They were in trouble when I got
there, and I don't think I improved the situation any." Yet he did: though
Albert isn't in the original story, his inclusion - however Psyche 101, or
powered as if on remote control - is part of Mia's Cenci's cause and
effect of sexual precocity. </P>
<P>     The craziness is the intended star, but it's the real house that
steals the picture. Colder, mazier urban British digs would be difficult
to find: construction starting in 1898, and completed five years later,
its eclectic style is the result of several architects, and its most
outstanding features, aside from the labyrinth of halls, rooms, nooks and
crannies, are the Moorish style balconies and woodwork and the blue and
aquamarine tiles that are in the interior and on the exterior. Scouting
locations, Losey remembered the house because he'd often pass it when he'd
take his son to a nearby school, and even production Richard MacDonald
knew of it, though at first he thought it wasn't quite right for the
picture's neurotic ambiance. Until, that is, he and Losey went to see it:
having ironically been used for a time by a church organization to house
the mentally ill, they found it a gold mine of possibilities. (They only
had to clean up grounds, restore the William Morris wallpaper, the art
nouveau objects, fixtures and add furniture. Mia's mother's bedroom and
attached bath were sets but their designs were faithful to the house.)
Notwithstanding Losey's claims, there's nothing about the sickies who live
within the story that we'd care to believe as "realistic," but we can
giggle our way through the psychoturgy by seeing these dementia peacocks
perform their rituals as a result of the house's influence: they've been
overtaken by the its maddening esoterics.</P>
