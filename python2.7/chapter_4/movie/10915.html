The Big Lebowski (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Leave it to the Coen brothers to use a man urinating on a rug as the
catalyst for an entire film's events.  No, an Oscar win and wide-spanning
critical acclaim has not put a mainstreaming damper on the reckless
imagination of bros Joel and Ethan, who have made an instant cult hit with
their warped but hilarious comedy-thriller, The Big Lebowski.</P>
<P>Said urinating man is a thug out to collect a debt owed by Bunny Lebowski
(Tara Reid), young trophy wife to Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston),
wheelchair-bound Pasadena millionaire.  The problem is, he urinates on the
rug of the _wrong_ Jeffrey Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), a.k.a. "the Dude," a
lazy loser who wastes his days drinking and bowling with his buddies Walter
Sobchak (John Goodman), a short-tempered Vietnam vet; and Donny (Steve
Buscemi), a slow-witted ex-surfer.  When the Dude attempts to receive
compensation for his soiled rug from "the Big Lebowski," he sets off an
outrageous chain of events that involves everything from kidnapping,
ransom, double crosses, and pornography to a writer for the vintage TV
western Branded, a gang of German nihilists, and their lethal pet marmot.</P>
<P>Needless to say, The Big Lebowski's story is intricate, out-there, and
distinctly Coenesque; it is just about impossible to sum it up in a single
sentence.  While the Coens' unpredictable, ridiculously complex, and
consistently funny plotline is one of the film's greatest virtues, the most
pleasures lie with the cast of colorful characters.  Standing first and
foremost is the easily excitable Walter, prone to violent outbursts and
suspicious of just about everyone. Goodman, in the film's standout
performance, brings him to life with appropriate bluster without going too
far; he's a blowhard, but he's a very loyal and helpful one, and as such we
understand why anyone would want to be his friend.  Making their marks on a
smaller scale are Julianne Moore, who continues to shine as the perpetually
robe-clad Maude, the Big Lebowski's sophisticated feminist artist daughter;
John Turturro as flamboyant bowling adversary Jesus (_not_ pronounced the
Spanish way) Quintana; Philip Seymour Hoffman as the Big Lebowski's geeky
assistant; and Buscemi, who is endearing, if underused, as the
mild-mannered link in the Dude-Walter-Donny trio.</P>
<P>But what about the Dude?  Out of the odd array of characters in The Big
Lebowski, he is by far the least interesting.  Sure, he's a layabout; he
pays grocery bills for 69 cents by check; he likes drinking White Russians
and smoking a joint here and there; he always looks like he just got of
bed; he loves Creedence Clearwater Revival; and he has vivid fantasies
involving bowling, including one elaborate Busby Berkeley-style musical
number complete with dancers wearing bowling pin headdresses.  He's
certainly not a conventional mystery "investigator" hero, and Bridges
manages to make the slob likable, but he's a downright bore compared to,
say, the vibrantly boorish Walter or even cameo characters such as a giddy
art world contemporary of Maude's played by David Thewlis.</P>
<P>To call The Big Lebowski "strange" or "quirky" would be an understatement;
at times it's flat-out weird.  Its unconventionality (another
understatement) is sure to leave many a moviegoer perplexed, but that's
exactly what makes the film such a fresh and imaginative piece of
entertainment.  (opens March 6)</P>
