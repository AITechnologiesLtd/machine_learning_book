<PRE>Charlie's Angels
A film review by Max Messier

<P>The spy game is up.  You can thank Charlie's Angels -- the movie -- for
that.</P>
<P>When did banality and pandering become okay?  Just steal from Hong Kong,
The Matrix, and a kitschy TV show from the mid-1970s and that's a
movie?  Charlie's Angels is one of the worst examples of action film
homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film I've seen in ages.</P>
<P>Charlie's Angels is dumb.  Just plain dumb.  As we all know, three of
the hottest females on the planet -- Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and
Lucy Liu -- are three super-agents working for the mysterious
millionaire named Charlie.  They all drive fast cars, look
oh-so-fabulous even in the morning, and don't seem to get a scratch even
when fighting armed men, having buildings explode ten feet in front of
them, or flying through the air in Matrix slow-motion.  And while the
entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage-busting wetsuits,
cleavage-busting waitress uniforms, and cleavage-busting wet t-shirts,
they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying,
drunk sorority girls, the kind who hit on everybody at a party.</P>
<P>The actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire
computer engineer -- the great Sam Rockwell -- who gets kidnapped by a
mysterious rival computer company.  Of course, the rival wants control
of his new personal identification system, which involves such
latter-day buzzwords as GPS, cellular tracking, and even mainframe.  The
amazing Crispin Glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen
involved in all the nasty things that happen to the Angels -- like
battling each of them in many round-robin Matrix rip-off (again) fight
sequences and harboring a strange attraction to sliced-off locks of the
Angels' hair.  The coup de grace is Bill Murray as Bosley, serving as
Charlie's manservant, or, more to the point, the Angels' pimp.</P>
<P>The rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc, enough costume changes to
fill three productions of Les Miserables, carbon-copy fight sequences
that would lend credible evidence to a Jackie Chan and the Wachowski
brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft, and the strange
transformation of Sam Rockwell into Mickey Rourke's long-lost brother.</P>
<P>Charlie's Angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy
burrito left out overnight.  Nothing is difficult, plausible, or
believable in any of the Angels' actions.  It feels like The Matrix,
Mission: Impossible 2, and Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold all
rolled into one.  Diaz is a knucklehead.  Barrymore is the "dangerous
one," mean and tough and about as believable as Katie Holmes in the
role.  Liu is just... Lucy Liu, looking good in a skin-tight black
leather suit.</P>
<P>The list of movies from which Charlie's Angels is directly lifted is
equally astonishing.  The writers apparently ran the copier all night
stealing scenes from Armageddon, Lethal Weapon II, all of Jackie Chan's
movies, The Great Escape, Saturday Night Fever, Revenge of the Nerds,
Payback, Darkman, Dr. No, The Matrix (as mentioned), and even TV's
Friends.  It's a shame, too, because one of the many screenwriters, John
August, was at the helm of last year's favorite, Go.  Then again, what
can you expect from a director known solely as "McG."</P>
<P>There is no camp value in the film, no interesting main characters, no
invigorating action scenes, no reason at all to waste your time except
to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of a few supporting
players.  Note to Hollywood: Next time, let's leave the TV shows on the
TV.</P>
