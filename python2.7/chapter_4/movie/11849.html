<P>     In an era of soaring stock markets, Republican Revolutions and enough
backlashes to give you whiplash, Michael Moore is something of an
anachronism:  part stand-up comic, part guerrilla film-maker but always
100% old-school liberal.  Moore became famous for his successful 1989
documentary ROGER & ME, in which he chronicled his Quixotic quest to speak
with General Motors CEO Roger Smith about the colsure of a manufacturing
plant in Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan.  The intervening years have
found him dabbling in feature film-making (CANADIAN BACON), television
("TV Nation") and book writing (the best-selling "Downsize This! Random
Threats from an Unarmed American"), but the unifying thread in his work
has continued to be the deflating of corporate America, the anger
sweetened with a wink and a smile.</P>
<P>     Moore might be considered one of the most dangerous radicals in
America if only you didn't want to giggle every time you saw him.  His new
documentary THE BIG ONE is a hilariously unique piece of social commentary
as vaudeville, a cross between "60 Minutes" and David Letterman which
draws most of its laughs from Moore's mere presence.  The film follows
Moore on what is supposed to be a book tour for the 1996 release of
"Downsize This!", but actually serves as an excuse for Moore to pounce on
corporate down-sizers around the country.  In Centralia, Illinois, he
meets with a representative from Leaf Candy who explains that workers'
jobs could have been preserved "if (the factory) had been making less
money;" in Cincinnati, he hands Proctor & Gamble reps a Dubious
Distinction Award even as he shares his fondness for Tide detergent.</P>
<P>     The confrontations which make up the backbone of THE BIG ONE easily
could have been humorless kamikaze journalism if not for the fact that
it's Michael Moore holding the microphone.  With his round face, shaggy
hair and omnipresent baseball cap, Moore looks less like an investigative
reporter than he does the kind of guy who goes shirtless at Green Bay
Packer games.  He has an agenda, to be sure, but he's also a splendid
performer who makes it look easy drawing his flies with honey rather than
vinegar.  As entertaining as he may be in full concert mode -- describing
how 1996 presidential candidate Steve Forbes never blinks; explaining the
role of "shareholders" in the U.S. Constitution; suggesting that our
country change its name from the boring "United States" to the more
intimidating "The Big One" -- Moore is at his best as the self-effacing
goofball who ends up making others look like even bigger goofballs.</P>
<P>     Nowhere is this gift better displayed than in Moore's already
controversial encounter with the first CEO who ever agreed to meet him
personally, Nike boss Peter Knight.  When Moore asks Knight why Nike
employs child labor in Asia rather than American workers, Knight calmly
replies that "Americans don't really want to make shoes."  If Knight comes
off looking like the devil -- and with his Tim Curry grin, he certainly
looks the part -- it's not because he's acting in the economic best
interest of his company.  Knight simply doesn't have the guts to come out
with such an admission, a fact largely attributable to Moore's preferred
conversational style.</P>
<P>     It's rather foolish to accuse Moore of blantant propagandizing, since
he never bothers to hide the fact.  Occasionally he butts heads with
recalcitrant company drones past the point of diminishing returns, and a
couple of moments with "average Americans" (including a tearful session at
a book signing) appear either staged or needlessly like photo
opportunities.  Still, it's hard to imagine that even the staunchest
Libertarian won't find something to smile at in Moore's singular tapestry
of 1990s Americana.  That goofy round-faced guy in the baseball cap sure
knows how to make a lecture not seem like a lecture.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Moores, the merrier:  8.</PRE>
