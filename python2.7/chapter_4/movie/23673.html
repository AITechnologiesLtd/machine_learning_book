<P>There is a fine detectable line separating a children's movie from a
family movie. In a film aimed squarely at the younger crowd, there are
usually goofy physical antics, wisecracking sidekicks and strained
moralizing extracted from obvious universal issues. Sometimes this
formula supplies harmless entertainment, but the family movie experience
is always more gratifying when the filmmakers have envisioned no
particular target audience or age group. `My Dog Skip', a gentle and
cuddly boy-and-his-dog story, is a heartwarming tale of love and
sacrifice that will appeal to audiences young and old. For flustered
adults seeking redemption from another 90-minute live-action opus with
cartoonish villains and immature gags, `My Dog Skip' is the perfect
antidote.</P>
<P>One of the trailers at the movie advertised - God help us - `Pokemon:
The Movie 2000'. The original `Pokemon' grossed roughly $80 million at
the North American box office, and for what? Don't sink your money into
that inane animated cult. While viewing the trailer for the sequel, the
‘strict kid movie' siren went off in my head. I could already picture
the parents being dragged unwillingly to the cineplex to satisfy their
7-year old Pikachu fan. `My Dog Skip' is not this type of movie, and in
that sense, it is somewhat of a wonderful rarity: a film that is special
and rewarding for movie-goers of all ages.</P>
<P>I'm not a particularly avid fan of the TV hit `Malcolm in the Middle'. I
have caught the show on a few occasions, but I haven't allowed it enough
air-time to grow on me. The reason I'm babbling about `Malcolm' is
because that primetime success serves as a showcase for the young,
talented protagonist of `My Dog Skip': Frankie Muniz. Muniz, a charming,
innocent stringbean of a boy, seems to be making his bid for childhood
stardom by displaying his surprising range. Here, Muniz plays
mischievous 11-year old Willie Morris, a lonely boy living in
Mississippi via 1942. Unable to make appropriate friends with kids his
age, Willie looks up to his neighbor and personal idle Dink Jenkins
(Luke Wilson), a star baseball player who promises to teach Willie the
secret to a great curve ball. When Dink is called away on overseas war
duty, Willie's mother (Diane Lane) opts for a four-legged adoption into
the family - that of a terrier named Skipper. Despite the initial
objection of Willie's strict but caring father (Kevin Bacon), a war
veteran himself, Skip is granted shelter under the Morris' roof and
becomes quite attached to young Willie.</P>
<P>`My Dog Skip' is a sweet, touching adaptation of a novel by Willie
Morris himself, who shared with the world his tender childhood
experiences... including how Skip helped him to overcome his fears and
evolve emotionally into a young man. Director Jay Russell has crafted a
magical film that embodies the essence of childhood and captures the
special nature of raising a pet that you hold dear. Sure, the narration
(by Harry Connick Jr.) is occasionally plodding and unnecessary, not to
mention laced with distracting corniness. And the script has a tendency
to delve too deeply into its subjects to a point where the message
becomes preachy and sentimental. These are still minor drawbacks in a
superb family film... one that seems to be honey-coated with warmth and
inviting innocence.</P>
<P>I was surprised at how effective `My Dog Skip' was. It tugs at your
heartstrings gently, paying close attention not to venture into blatant
dramatic territory that insults the viewer's intelligence. Over time,
the soft, heartwarming approach grows powerful - resembling somewhat of
a strategically played game of emotional chess. I don't give in to
dramatics very often, but I admit I was getting a trifle misty-eyed
during `My Dog Skip'. The wonderfully honest performances only help to
enforce the subtle power the film contains. Bacon and Lane are both
terrific. Luke Wilson was a pleasant surprise, for in a rare dramatic
performance, he excels at everything that he usually accomplishes in a
comedy. There is a lot of honest discovery channeled through the
character of Dink Jenkins, who, in cinematic form, is a well-realized
addition to Morris' childhood adventures.</P>
<P>Frankie Muniz is the heart of `My Dog Skip', offering a thoroughly
convincing portrait of a lonely small-town boy with eyes aglow with
alarm and innocence. I'm looking forward to seeing him in future
projects. Concentrating on the present, Jay Russell's `My Dog Skip'
submits an early bid for family film of the year. Sure, it will likely
be toppled by a show-stopping Disney picture, but I'll hold a place in
my heart for this little wonder. `My Dog Skip' is something to wag your
tail about.</P>
