<PRE>                         THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The third artificial reality film in
          about a month is the most stylish and best
          photographed with the most coherent plotline.  Had
          this been the first of the three to be released, it
          would be recognized as the best.  Roland Emmerich
          finally has produced a quality science fiction
          film.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The year is 1937.  As our story opens we follow an elderly man
(played by Armin Mueller-Stahl) from his mistress's bedroom to a
nightclub.  He leaves a letter he has written someone in the care of a
bartender (Vincent D'Onofrio) and goes home to his wife.  As he lies in
bed, suddenly he is propelled into the present. The world of 1937 was a
fully functioning world, realistic is every respect but one.  It was
not actually real but a total computer simulation.  And it was a very
complete computer simulation.  It is not just a virtual reality program
creating for one person what could be a three-dimensional world.  Each
person in the 1937 world has a life and personality of his or her own
and continues even when there is nobody to see him.  It is an entire
virtual world functioning on its own.  And our elderly gentleman is
Hammond Fuller, "the Einstein of our generation" who created the
cyber-world.  But tonight Hammond Fuller is going to be murdered and
suspicion will fall on his chief programmer Douglas Hall (Craig
Bierko).  Hall and his friend and coworker Whitney (Vincent D'Onofrio)
have worked for Hammond for years and think that they know him fairly
well.  Now that he is dead, they are not so sure.  A daughter (Gretchen
Mol) has turned up mysteriously and nobody knew Fuller had a daughter.
Discovered also is that Fuller has been repeatedly projecting himself
into his created world of 1937. Even Hall had not realized that was
possible yet.  Now Hall will have to solve a mystery spread across two
different worlds.</P>
<P>     Part of what makes this film as remarkable as it is is that it
comes from Centropolis Film Productions, Roland Emmerich's company.
Until now the best thing we have seen coming from Centropolis is their
imaginative opening banner. However, the approach for THE THIRTEENTH
FLOOR is entirely different from that of STARGATE, INDEPENDENCE DAY,
and GODZILLA.  Director Josef Rusnak, experienced mostly in European
films, has kept the use of special effects modest.  Rather than having
a visual carnival, this film is instead intelligent and filmed with a
great deal of visual style.  Cinematographer Wedigo von
Schultzendorff's style uses relatively modest special effects.  His
views of 1937 Los Angeles are lush and gorgeous, generally filmed with
a sepia filter to give us a Los Angeles where Philip Marlowe would feel
right at home.  von Schultzendorff has made his modern-day Los Angeles
looks like a giant electric-blue circuit pack.  Where the 1937 city has
a rich period feel, 1999 feels electronic and electrically charged.</P>
<P>     Rather than paying expensive stars, Rusnak has two little known
actors, Craig Bierko and Gretchen Mol, in the two top-billed positions.
He has saved the familiar faces for supporting roles.  His familiar
actors are more known for good performances than for powerhouse marquee
value.  Armin Mueller-Stahl had a long career in Germany and now
frequently appears in English-language films including SHINE, THE GAME,
and THE X FILES.  Vincent D'Onofrio has also been a familiar character
actor since his pivotal role as a somewhat retarded Marine recruit in
FULL METAL JACKET.</P>
<P>     So now we have had released in about a month three films about
worlds that seem real but are in reality created in computers.  We can
see how three different filmmakers have each handled the theme in an
action-adventure.  This is a rare opportunity.  The Wachowskis created
in THE MATRIX a future world that was visually imaginative and gave us
a plot that to a very great extent was chases, fighting, and martial
arts.  David Cronenberg's worlds in "eXistenZ" are basically our world,
but ones where the line between the totally inanimate and the
biological is breaking down.  Josef Rusnak has dusted off the 1964
science fiction novel SIMULACRON-3 by Daniel F. Galouye, toned down the
Frederik Pohl aspects (in the novel the world are used to predict
public opinion) and played up the Philip K. Dick aspects.  He has given
us a beautiful sepia-toned view of the 1930s to compare with an
electrically charged view of the present.  Perhaps which you prefer
says something about you.  THE MATRIX will clearly be the most
profitable, but THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR is the one I want in my
collection.  I rate the latter film 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high
+2 on the -4 to +4 scale. (Oh, and when we see a newspaper toward the
end, June 21 should be a Friday, not a Monday.)</P>
