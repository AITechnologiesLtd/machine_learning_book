<PRE>                        DROWNING MONA
                      A film review by Bradley Null
                       Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P> If you've ever found yourself in a theater watching a movie like THROW
MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN or DON'T TELL MOM THE BABYSITTER'S DEAD, then
you'll understand my experience with DROWNING MONA.  DROWNING MONA is
one of those films that you might hear about and shrug it off as a bad
idea.  Then you'll see a trailer and realize that your first instinct
was right.  There is no logical reason for you to ever see this movie.
It looks unfunny, moronic, and you have already crossed it off the list
of all the movies you are potentially interested in ever investing your
time in.  But despite all of that, you somehow end up forking over eight
bucks for the privilege to see it.  And your worst fears are realized.</P>
<P> Suffice it to say that DROWNING MONA is a bad film.  It is a very bad
film.  Let us count the ways.</P>
<P> First, there is the plot.  Everybody hates Mona.  Mona gets killed.
And the question is not who did it, but who didn't do it.  As far as
this plot goes, let me just ask, can anybody think of a good whodunit
black comedy?  Hell, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY was Alfred Hitchcock's worst
movie.  I'll even go so far as to say that it's simply not wise to
attempt to conjure any sort of comedy out of movies about mean and/or
dead women.  Anyone who has seen either of the two movies cited above
should understand this concern.  In the particular case of MONA, it
seems to be an important element of the plot and theme of the movie that
nobody seems to care who killed MONA.  They are just glad that she is
dead.  Well, I ask, if nobody in the movie cares, then why the hell
would we?</P>
<P> The second problem with the film is the characters and the acting.  The
actors were actually the reason I talked myself into seeing this film in
the first place.  I mean sure, Danny DeVito and Bette Midler have a
tendency to not discriminate when it comes to scripts.  And they also
have a tendency to sink to the level of their material.  But here we had
Jamie Lee Curtis, William Fichtner, Casey Affleck, and Will Ferrell, all
actors whom I before had thought either had some talent or were at the
very least a little funny.  But none of them pulled it off here.
Affleck particularly, who was hilarious in GOOD WILL HUNTING, turns in a
conspicuously morose performance as the good kid that turns into the
prime suspect.  Fichtner has the sole funny line in the script.
Ferrell, as the funeral home director, trying to pull off yet another
variation of his Saturday Night Live stock character (half shifty, half
outright weird), just can't seem to suck enough out of the script to
generate a single laugh.</P>
<P> The third problem with the film is the theme, otherwise known as the
point.  To put it bluntly, this movie has no point.</P>
<P> So just in case your best judgment has left you and you find yourself
standing at the ticket booth.  Maybe everything else is sold out.  Maybe
you feel a sudden compulsion to experience the entire oeuvre of Bette
Midler.  Maybe you're just not thinking.  Please, DO NOT SEE THIS
MOVIE.  If movies like this perform poorly enough at the box office,
maybe we won't be subjected to any more of them.</P>
<P> That's my public service announcement for the month.  Black comedy is
hard.  Only the select few, like the Coen brothers or Stanley Kubrick
seem to be able to pull it off.  Please note that none of them had
anything to do with this film.</P>
