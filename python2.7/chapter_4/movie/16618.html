Reviewed November 15, 1998.</P>
<P>I have always been a fan of director Neil Jordan, from his early work, 
such as 1984's "The Company of Wolves," to 1992's "The Crying Game," and 
1994's "Interview With a Vampire." His latest film, "The Butcher Boy," 
is a return to his roots in Ireland, but unfortunately, it is not a 
successful homecoming.</P>
<P>Told through the eyes of a 12-year-old Irish boy, Francis (newcomer 
Eomann Owens), this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about 
his decidedly unstable life. His father (Stephen Rea) is an indifferent 
alcoholic, his mother (Fiona Shaw) is mentally ill and always in and out 
of hospitals, and Francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of 
one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore. Francis is 
the type of boy who always has a lot to say, but mostly fluctuates 
between sarcasm and frightening honesty, and it quickly becomes apparent 
that he may very well be a little psychotic, even capable of brutal 
murder.</P>
<P>The premise of, "The Butcher Boy," is one that could have very well been 
turned into a thought-provoking, disturbing motion picture, but somehow 
nothing works. Francis is in almost every scene, but we learn very 
little about him, as if the film was distancing itself away from him 
when, I suspect, we were actually supposed to sympathize with him. This 
is definately not young Owens fault, however, because he gives a 
brilliantly accurate performance, and is able to also seem menacing as 
well. The fact that we don't get close to his character is because of 
the sloppy screenplay.</P>
<P>The supporting characters are no help, though. Rea is wasted, and has 
practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son, or to anyone 
else for that matter. He usually seems to just be sitting watching the 
television throughout. Shaw has a little bit more to work with, since 
she has one touching scene in which she talks to Francis in a time of 
despair, but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her. 
And singer Sinead O'Connor appears rather effectively as the Virgin Mary 
who occasionally gives Francis advice. </P>
<P>The pacing is all off in, "The Butcher Boy." Although the story could 
have been dynamite, it moves at a deadeningly slow rate, and I found my 
mind wandering every once in a while. It is also very episodic, because 
the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs. At one 
point, Francis is sent away to a juvenile prison, and an odd, possibly 
sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself, but 
nothing comes of it. </P>
<P>I'd rather think of, "The Butcher Boy," as a brief diversion for 
director Jordan, rather than a total misfire. He has already proven to 
be a strong director, but he lucked out with this latest film. What 
could have been a courageous, unsettling character study of an 
emotionally disturbed young boy, only manages to be an ineffective, 
uninvolivng bore.</P>
