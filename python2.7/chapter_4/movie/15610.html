THE GODFATHER: PART II
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>The real importance of any movie can't be adequately
appraised solely by the box- office success or critical
response, or even combination of both. Movies, no matter how
popular or critically acclaimed, cease to be important when
the passage of time erases them from collective memory. Only
those films that defy such oblivion are really grand, and
the nice example are first two movies of the Godfather Saga.
Their grandness can be seen not only in their quality and
the influence that had over the generations, but also by the
endless debate that lasts among the critics and film
scholars until this day. The debate was created due to the
fact that the second movie of the Saga, THE GODFATHER: PART
II, represents one of the first examples of now generally
despised practice in modern Hollywood - making sequels out
of the successful, great movies. Such practice earned the
utter disdain of contemporary critics because the sequels
almost always fail to meet the hard standards of its
predecessors, and, more often than not, succeed only in
tarnishing their great memory. However, in 1970s, during the
golden age of so-called "New Hollywood" such rule wasn't
universal, and some films turned out to be even better than
the first in the series. THE GODFATHER: PART II by Francis
Ford Coppola is often referred as one of them.</P>
<P>Reason for the high status of THE GODFATHER: PART II lies in
the fact that the sequel to THE GODFATHER, very personal
movie, was authored by the very same author with very same
personal agenda. While the other sequels usually serve as
nothing more than easy way for unimaginative producers to
cash on previous successes, THE GODFATHER: PART II was a
nice opportunity for Coppola to experiment, correct some
possible flaws or even answer to critics of his previous
work. Luckily, in the atmosphere that encouraged creative
freedom, Coppola also used the immense resources of big
Hollywood studios, whose chiefs gave him an utmost control
of his work. The biggest and most serious objection to THE
GODFATHER was Coppola's allegedly apologetic portrayal the
Mafia - portrayal that would encourage similar more or less
apologetic movie stereotypes in decades to come. Coppola was
accused of showing organised crime more noble and less
violent than it actually was - his Mafiosi are shown as
dedicated family men, opposed to narcotics and any
unnecessary violence, and in some way even better
alternative to legitimate government. In his second part of
the saga, Coppola intended to use the story of the first
part to paint more realistic and, consequently, much darker
picture.</P>
<P>The plot of the movie is rather complex, thanks to the
revolutionary yet ingenious idea by Coppola to mix two
stories. First one begins roughly one decade after the
events of the first GODFATHER, with Michael Corleone (Al
Pacino) now tightly in control of the Corleone crime family,
left to him by his late and charismatic father Vito in the
previous film. The second story deals with young Vito
Corleone (Robert de Niro), first as boy forced to flee to
America from Sicilian Mafiosi who had killed his entire
family, then as young immigrant who must turn to crime in
order to feed his wife and children. Those two stories are
connected by good editing and Coppola's directorial
techniques (the example in the beggining is the scene when
9-year old Vito Corleone that morphs into another scene,
with Vito's 9-year old grandson), although at times the
transition isn't so smooth or symbolic.</P>
<P>The story of young Vito Corleone seems more pleasing for the
viewer, and is definitely more fascinating. Coppola
obviously enjoyed recreating the harsh life of his Italian
American ancestors, and he even indulged himself with the
little humouristic episode that would remain the sole
uplifting piece in this otherwise extremely grim and
pessimistic movie. Robert de Niro was perfectly cast as
young Vito, and his legendary method acting techniques -
like living in Sicily in order to perfect the use of local
dialect and accent - are here in full swing. Vito Corleone
in his early years is as charming as he was charismatic in
his GODFATHER incarnation. Sympathetic portrayal in the
previous movie wasn't accidental - Corleone is shown as
basically honest human being who is simply driven to the
other side of law by harsh circumstances. Ironically,
Corleone was actually the victim of Mafia in his youth -
first, by losing his family, then by losing his job (his
employer being forced to find job for mafioso's relative) -
but he became first the member, than the leader of that very
same organisation nevertheless.</P>
<P>His son Michael in the latter story is shadow, not only of
his father, but of his own self being presented in THE
GODFATHER - generally nice guy who transformed from
idealistic youth into pragmatic maturity. Michael's plan to
carry on with his father's ambitious plan brings disastrous
results - he loses his family, the most important thing and
the very reason he decided to follow the father's criminal
footsteps in the first place. Lacking father's charisma,
Michael leads the family with the iron hand, thus alienating
his closest relatives - his sister Connie (Talia Shire) left
her own children and turned to debauchery; her wife Kay
(Diane Keaton), disgusted with the loss of her freedom and
ideals, plotted the vengeance of Medean proportions; his
weak and neglected brother Fredo (John Cazale) decided to
prove his own identity by betrayal.  Even the most loyal
member of the family - adopted brother and family councillor
Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) can feel Michael's loss of
affection and desperately tries to regain it by speaking
Italian, without any significant result. This segment is
probably the darkest, least sentimental and most brutal part
of the Godfather saga; Coppola obviously didn't like the
object of his presentation and even the photography by
Gordon Willis illustrates that - while the outside is
sharply lit, the interiors of the Michael's luxurious
buildings are mostly dark, symbolising the corruption and
decay of his criminal empire.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, that segment was probably the weakest -
weaker than the prologue and THE GODFATHER. The main reason
lies in the screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo, and the
plot that lacks coherence. This segment introduces two new
major characters - Michael's underboss Frank Pentangelli
(Michael V. Gazzo) and Jewish mobster Hyman Roth (Lee
Strasberg). Those two men has some serious inconsistencies
in their characterisations. Pentangelli is at first simple
street thug, only to be revealed as well-read cultivated man
in the film's finale. Roth is also inconsistent - his
character, based on Meyer Lansky, real life underworld
legend, is someone too clever and experienced to allow
himself to engage in something as doomed as investing in
Cuba at the brink of the revolution. Those flaws are
somewhat compensated with the great actors in those
characters' roles. That can't be said for other plot
problems - lack of clear explanation for the conflict
between Michael and Roth, and many subplots dealing with the
real life events and anecdotes dealing with Mafia (Valacchi
testimony in the Senate and JFK assassination). Finally, the
lack of originality is revealed at the end, when Coppola
almost recreates his multiple massacre scene from the end of
THE GODFATHER.</P>
<P>Despite repetitiveness and lack of originality, THE
GODFATHER: PART II remains truly grand movie. Production
design by Dean Tavoularis is superb (especially in the first
segment); same can be said for the costumes by Theadora van
Runkle (expensive white suit serves as wonderful character
trait by Don Fanucci), but most of all the music by Nino
Rota and Carmine Coppola is almost perfect. The lead actors
are wonderful - Pacino, De Niro, Keaton, Shire, Cazale,
Duvall, Gazzo, Strasberg, as well as those in supporting
roles (Bruno Kirby as young Clemenza, Gastone Moschin as Don
Fanucci, G.D. Spradlin as Senator Geary).</P>
<P>At the end of the day, perhaps even such great,
"Oscar"-worthy film can suffer from dreaded "sequel
syndrome". However, those flaws didn't prevent it from
becoming a true classic, one of the pillars of modern
cinemas, with its quality seldom matched. After almost
quarter of century new viewers should be able to enjoy it -
both those who didn't see THE GODFATHER and those who did.</P>
