                                 [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Maria Vitale
                        Copyright 1994 Maria Vitale</PRE>
<PRE>Starring: Jessica Lange, Tommy Lee Jones, Amy Locane, Powers Booth,
          Carrie Snodgress, Chris O'Donnell.
Director: Tony Richardson
Rated: PG-13
Running time: 101 minutes
Studio: Orion Pictures</PRE>
<P>     The year is 1962 and the military is conducting nuclear testings.
Involved in these tests is Hank Marshall (Jones), an army colonel who
is critical of the above-ground tests that are being done.  He urges
below-ground tests which no one will consider at the time until it is
learned that the Soviets have conducted underground tests of their
own.</P>
<P>     Marshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to Carly (Lange)
who is topless on the base's beach in full view of the entire
personnel.  Hank's reaction is one of amusement.  He's been here before
and he deals with it in the only way he knows how.  The problem is
Carly is a manic-depressive and when she isn't flirting with any man
who happens to be near her, she's fantasizing about a fictious world
where she'd rather be.  Typical of the mental illness, she also is
promiscuous and foul-tempered.  The mood swings are quick and violent
and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is
considerable.</P>
<P>     From Hank's reports which state his opposition to the
Army's methods of testing, he is transferred from Hawaii to Alabama.
Carly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become Marilyn
Monroe, bleach-blond and all.  The new home in Alabama is pretty
run-down and depressing and sets Carly off on a violent tantrum.  After
meeting his new commanding officer (Booth), Hank sees an all too
familiar pattern begin to repeat.  Carly openly flirts with the CO.
Hank tries to deal with the situation, but his only resort is to carry
her off and throw her into a nearby pool.  Arguments ensue.  The family
becomes even more alienated.</P>
<P>     The CO is very interested in pursuing an encounter with Carly and
sends Hank off to observe an underground test which causes the
irradiation of two local ranchers, much to the vocal objections of
Hank, who spots them but is unable to cancel the detonation of the
bomb.</P>
<P>     Back at home, the two girls try to hold things together but they
wonder why their father can't deal with their mother's problems.  One
daughter says, "He's blind and she's crazy." The other answers,
"They're perfect for each other." It reaches the breaking point when
the older girl (Locane) and a boy, the CO's son (O'Donnell) see her
mother and the CO making love in an abandoned shed.  She forces her
mother to tell Hank and get it all out into the open.</P>
<P>     Hank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical
put on by the military wives, including the CO's wife (Snodgress).  He
confronts the c.o. but not about Carly.  He is upset over the coverup
surrounding the accident during the testing.  A fight breaks out
between the two when the CO accuses Hank of not being able to satisfy
his wife.  Hank is arrested.  What follows is manipulation and revenge
on the part of the CO.  He convinces Carly to commit Hank to a hospital
for observation.  Instead, they fill him with so many drugs that he can
barely cope.  He foams at the mouth and cannot even finish sewing a
leather wallet as presents for his daughters.</P>
<P>     Carly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the
Army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the
family for the first time.  The film has an upbeat ending with hope
that the family has found a way to deal with its problems.</P>
<P>     The performances are solid throughout.  Jones is sympathetic and
loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to
deal with his wife's rage.  He comforts her and offers protection.
Lange gives a strong and spirited portrayal of a woman on the edge who
draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family.  Amy
Locane is very good as she fights to keep her family together while
struggling with her own doubts as to whether she even should.</P>
<P>     BLUE SKY is based on the story of the Stagner family.  The
screenplay was written by Rama Laurie Stagner (with Arlene Sarner and
Jerry Leichtling).  The film marks the final work of Tony Richardson
who died shortly after its completion in 1991.  He had made such
classics as LOOK BACK IN ANGER (1958) and TOM JONES (1963).  Orion
Pictures underwent bankruptcy and caused the film to sit on a shelf for
three years.  The film joins an alread promising fall line-up of films
and is well worth catching for the performances alone.</P>
<PRE>My rating: 4 out of 4.</PRE>
