France, 1967</PRE>
<P>     One of my favorite unanswered questions in all of the movies is
this: What does the Japanese client keep in his box in BELLE DE JOUR?</P>
<P>     A little background is in order, in case you've never seen the
film. Belle de Jour is a definitive statement on eroticism, and a
deeply personal experience.  Catherine Deneuve gives a flat yet
evocative performance as Severine Sevigny, a virginal newlywed whose
everyday life is broken up by masochistic fantasies in which she's
beaten, smeared with filth, and humiliated by a variety of men. Her
husband, Pierre, seems gentle and loving, but Severine remains in
thrall to the idea of less wholesome relationships. When Severine
probes one of her husband's friends for information, he gives her the
address of a Parisian brothel catering to businessmen. Severine dons
black hat, coat, and sunglasses, and wanders through the neighborhood,
finally working up the courage to enter the establishment, where Madame
Anais agrees to let her work as a prostitute (Severine is just the
right type, she says -- fresh and classy). Because Severine is
insistent that she must be free to leave by evening, Anais christens
her Belle de Jour.</P>
<P>     The remainder of the film is broken into episodes, as Severine
confronts new and different clients while living a second life at
home.  For the most part, the customers are vaguely repulsive
caricatures: the fellow who fancies himself a ladies' man, and forces
himself clumsily on her; "the Professor," a mousy gynecologist who
insists on being scolded, whipped, and trod upon. More intriguing is
the Japanese businessman who carries with him a small box. He shows the
contents to one of the other two prostitutes, who snaps "Not for me,
thanks," and turns away in a hurry. When Severine peeks inside, her
eyes grow wide and we hear a soft whirring noise.  "Don't be afraid,"
she is urged.</P>
<P>     When the man leaves, closing the latch once more on his little
box, Severine lies spent, stretched across the bed as the maid tidies
her room. She confides to Severine her understanding of what the
prostitutes go through; even the maid finds men like the Japanese
client somewhat frightening. Severine looks up from the bed with an
expression of exhaustion and bliss. "What do you know?" she spits.</P>
<P>     Director and co-screenwriter Luis Bunuel is one of the most
subversive of filmmakers.  His career began in 1939, with UN CHIEN
ANDALOU (An Andalusian Dog), a classic of Surrealism that he made with
artist Salvador Dali. The first scene featured a razor blade slicing
sideways across a woman's (actually an animal's) eyeball. That most
offensive of all images, which creates an uproar to this day whenever
it's shown to a classroom full of first-year film students, is a
challenge to viewers, renewed with each project in Bunuel's long
career. Here, he seems to be at first challenging us to identify with
Severine and her deviances, convincing us to distance ourselves from
them, and ultimately to examine our own responses to her situation.</P>
<P>     Bunuel is aided and abetted in this perverse venture by Sacha
Vierny, the cinematographer who worked with Alain Resnais on NIOGHT AND
FOG, HIROSHIMA, MON AMOUR, and LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD, and who has
lately been salvation for British filmmaker Peter Greenaway, whose
films take divine advantage of Vierny's cool, stately image- making. A
good deal of BELLE DE JOUR's quiet power comes from the mannered beauty
of its compositions, as Vierny catches the light on Deneuve's face just
so.</P>
<P>     Eventually, Severine pays a terrible price for pursuing her
aberrant fantasies, and the film could almost be a treatise on the
importance of prudence and fidelity. It's tempting to assume that
Bunuel is blaming Severine for giving in to her own desires and
betraying her husband -- blaming Woman for the ruin of Man. Perhaps he
is, but it's maddening to try and prove it. The movie is quite clearly
Severine's story, not Pierre's. Her status as perpetrator of a misdeed
is undermined by her status as a tragic hero (which is bolstered as
Bunuel goes out of his way to develop Severine's character). What's
important isn't what Deneuve gives away in her low-key performance, but
what she doesn't show -- the essence that the audience itself has to
fill in. Typically, the director gives us something more intriguing and
revealing than a simple narrative. Bunuel plays our own judgmental
tendencies against our desire for erotic satisfaction, and leaves us in
a quandary.</P>
<P>     Which brings us back to one of the great questions of the
cinema.  What's in the Asian client's box is the same thing that's in
Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION briefcase. It's the MacGuffin from a
dozen different Hitchcock films. Judging from the look on Deneuve's
face as she recovers from its effects, it may be, like the Maltese
Falcon, the stuff dreams are made of.</P>
<P>     But as far as dreams go, it's the stuff that's outside the
frame that matters. Our own moral scheme, shaped by personal loves,
regrets, and fantasies, surrounds and permeates Bunuel's deliberately
ambiguous value system. Like Greta Garbo's at the climax of QUEEN
CHRISTINA, Deneuve's face is a mask, and also a receptor for our own
emotions. The final truth of this film is that we are forced to do our
own moralizing, if we feel it needs to be done -- no matter how
skillful the intrusion of Bunuel as auteur, Severine's life-changing
experience is unmistakably a function of our own.</P>
