<P>Almost all movies start on paper somewhere - perhaps something a
production exec scribbles on paper during lunch or an idea that a writer
beats around in his head awhile before scripting a rough draft. From
there, if it sounds good, the thing gets pitched to a studio that might
be interested; if so, the movie is greenlighted into a production phase.
Considering this process for Vincent Ward's latest drama, WHAT DREAMS
MAY COME, it's possible to think that everything sounded good until the
movie was actually laid on plastic and sent to movie theaters
nationwide. And in all fairness, it most likely was a good idea. But in
this case, it's just one good idea that wasn't suited for film. </P>
<P>It's possible to see the shortcomings of DREAMS at the outset. Director
Ward wants to work with a very metaphysical and esoteric concept for two
hours, while simultaneously trying to mix solid drama and a sprinkling
of Robin William's characteristic wit. It doesn't work, for there's just
too much going on in his head for everything to come together onscreen.
At times, the movie reaches inspiring levels of thought-provoking
scripting, but these arrive at unexepected moments and it's likely that
the audience will miss many of them. As a whole, the script is not very
well done for such a good idea. It's a very muddled foray into an area
of screenwriting that takes a very committed and experienced writer to
perform well in. Writer Ronald Bass, basing it on the Richard Matheson
novel, certainly has experience (RAIN MAN), but he doesn't have
commitment, and the movie suffers because of it. </P>
<P>The cast has the goods but does not deliver. Williams is fun to watch,
but he lacks the flair that he had in GOOD WILL HUNTING, and,
ultimately, DEAD POETS SOCIETY. Here, he plays the lead of Chris
Nielsen. Chris meets the lovely artist Annie (Annabella Sciorra) while
on vacation in Europe, and the two fall in love and are married soon
after. They have two kids, but not long after the movie's opening
credits are the children killed off in a car accident. The couple
suffers but survives until Chris is also killed in a car accident. He
goes to Heaven, which, for him, is composed of his wife's paintings.
It's there that he meets spiritual tour guide Al (Cuba Gooding Jr.), who
gets him to know the hereafter. Back on Earth, Annie can't take the
grief of losing her entire family and commits suicide; she goes to Hell.
When Chris learns of this, he takes Al and an ancient netherworld
tracker (Max von Sydow) on a journey to Hell to find Annie. </P>
<P>The rest of the cast is rather drab, including Cuba Gooding Jr. Gooding
had showed promise after his Academy Award-winning performance in JERRY
MAGUIRE and a delightful turn in AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Here, his job seems
forced, and he doesn't fully become the character. The only one to lend
any substance is Annabella Sciorra, who provides a solid sense of
motivation for Williams' character. This rather mediocre cast doesn't
help the script any, and so the movie's truly redeeming facets are the
special effects and set design. WHAT DREAMS MAY COME makes very dynamic
use of extreme color and lack thereof; the movie has a very powerful
vision. It's watchable for the most part, but not extremely so. And
unfortunately, it's about a subject that won't fly well with everyone,
so you may have trouble convincing yourself that this one's worth the
bucket of popcorn.</P>
