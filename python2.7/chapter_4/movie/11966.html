<PRE>LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Richard Kwietniowski
Writer: Richard Kwietniowski (based on the novel by Gilbert Adair)
Starring: John Hurt, Jason Priestly, Fiona Loewi, Sheila Hancock, Maury
Chaykin, Gawn Grainer, Elizabeth Quinn, Bruce Filmore, Tom Hurst</P>
<P>One day, reclusive British Writer Giles De'Ath (John Hurt) locks himself
out of his flat, and stumbles upon a poster advertising a screening of a
film adaptation of an E.M. Forster novel.  Arriving there, he's shocked to
see that it's not really E.M. Forster, but instead a teen schlock film
called "Hotpants College II," and that the Forster film was the prior week.
 But as he's getting up to leave, he stops, and the camera pulls in on his
shocked face, which is frozen on the screen.</P>
<P>What he's seen is an actor on the screen who mesmerizes him for some untold
reason.  He sits down and watches the rest of the film, and when the
credits come up, the film highlights the actor's name: Robbie Bostock
(Jason Priestly - yes, THAT Jason Priestly), and Giles becomes completely
obsessed with this man, awkwardly buying teen magazines, renting his films
(with titles like "Tex Mex" and "Skin Marks"...but alas, no "Hotpants
College I").  He even tells his maid that she is no longer allowed to clean
in his study so that he can secretly watch his films, and make an album of
cut-outs and what-not just like some pre-pubescent Leo DiCaprio-freak.</P>
<P>It's the alienated Giles messy attempt to re-enter society that this film
is about, and, in fact, most of the film plays like a giant
Fish-Out-of-Water film with substance.  The film is a semi-comedy,
semi-philosophical drama which gets most of its laughs from bits like Giles
ordering a VCR but not understanding that you need a television to watch
the tapes on, but also has the guts and brains to make something out of all
this.</P>
<P>The first half of the film deals with his obsession with Robbie, but the
second half has him taking a "vacation," if you will, in Chesterton, Long
Island where Robbie apparently lives.  There, he sets out on a quest to
track down Robbie, and get to know him or something.  Eventually, he does
meet him, and he desperately tries to make it sound like it's really his
fictitious niece who is in love with him, but can't help but tell him
repeatedly how great he is.  Things get generally uncomfortable from here.</P>
<P>"Love and Death on Long Island" has been said to have been based on certain
themes in the novel "Death in Venice" (which I have yet to read, but yeah,
it's next on my long list of books I have to read now), and I can only
guess that some of those themes are the negative parts of seclusion,
worshipping false idols, and alienation in general.  But the film deals
with all of these in mostly comical ways, making the film easier to digest
and also more fun to discuss later on.  As I watched the film, I was
laughing a lot of the time at everything, but afterwards, I was thinking
what the film was trying to say about everything.</P>
<P>Giles, who's brilliantly played by John Hurt (relatively unknown, unless
you bring up the fact that he was the guy in "Alien" who had the alien pop
out of his chest, and that he was the Elephant Man once, but you couldn't
recognize him in the latter anyway), is portrayed not as a mere stupid man,
but as one who is completely out of touch with reality.  He has built an
emotional and philosophical shield around himself, so much that when
someone asks him in an interview if he owns a word processor, he just
stares at her and says "Am I in the business of just processing words?"</P>
<P>That's why his obsession with Robbie is so great.  We don't fully
comprehend his obsession, although I doubt it's the homosexual obsession
many people may find (he was married to a woman once, but she died, and we
don't know his past or anything), but whatever it is, it's so huge that it
grows out of control.  By the time he's in Long Island and searching for
his house by foot, we are near cringing everytime he gets closer to his
target.  And when he literally runs into Robbie's gorgeous model wife
(Fiona Loewi) at the supermarket and gives her a false story, we can't
believe he's gone this far.</P>
<P>But all of this is handled lightly, so as not to talk down to people.  The
film is just hilarious to watch, filled with lots of great quick comic
moments, like a scene in a taxi where he rudely disses a cabbie's attempts
to get him to put out a cigarette, or just weridly subtle characters, like
a diner owner named Irv (Maury Chaykin, who's really making his rounds
these days) who describes absolutely everything as "very attractive."</P>
<P>The performances are quite amazing as well.  John Hurt gives what may be
his best performance, which is a tough thing to beat, in my opinion.  And
Jason Priestly nails his performance.  I really liked how his character
wasn't a self-mockery or anything - it almost seems that this is exactly
how Priestly is in real life, or at least used to be.  I'm almost afraid to
say this: he's great.  Also giving great performances are Loewi as
Priestly's wife, and Chaykin, who's humerous in every way, not just in his
choice of hair cuts.</P>
<P>All this makes "Love and Death" a really fun film to watch, although some
of it is uncomfortable in the same way "King of Comedy" is (although not
that much, to tell the truth).  It's a film that could be passed off as
mere FOOW (Fish Out Of Water) material, but afterwards it can be looked at
philosophically.  Like the way Giles can look at something that seems
kiddie and find something redeeming in it, you can look to this film with
its false facade and find something even more redeeming.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
