<PRE>"How the Grinch Stole Christmas"</PRE>
<P>There has been a great deal of hoopla, over the past months, about the
coming of the big-screen recreation of the Grinch tale that debuted in 1966
as the Boris Karloff-narrated, Dr. Seuss classic. As everyone must know,
feel good director Ron Howard was teamed with zany Jim Carrey to bring the
animated tale to live action life and create the feature length fantasy,
"How the Grinch Stole Christmas."</P>
<P>The anticipation of this new rendition of the Christmas TV classic has
probably set expectations extremely high for fans who have eagerly awaited
the new Grinch. As such, I think that there may be some disappointment on
the entertainment horizon for many of us. And, I think this is due to our
fond memories of the original that color our recollection of that venerable
oeuvre. If you think about it, the original "Grinch" had four things going
for it - the Grinch, his faithful dog Max, the wonderful reading by Boris
Karloff and the brilliant imagination of Theodor S. Geisel, A.K.A. Dr.
Seuss. Beyond these four things (and the great songs - make that five
things), there are the Whos and they are really boring. The Whos could be
interchanged with Munchkins or Ewoks and it wouldn't have mattered. I never
liked any of the little buggers anyway.</P>
<P>In the modern remake, produced by longtime partners Howard and Brian
Grazer, we pretty much get the same thing, but with an attempt to flesh out
the Who society. Unfortunately and inexplicably, the Whos are shown from
the very start to be a culture of crass consumerism where buy, buy, buy is
the name of the game and the spirit of Christmas is completely lost -
except for little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen). The best things in the
movie are still the Grinch (Jim Carrey) and Max (Kelley), but there is an
effort to create a complete world on the screen.</P>
<P>Helmer Howard evokes a vision that is reminiscent of the one that Robert
Altman created in his interesting and artistic flop, "Popeye," with Robin
Williams. There, too, a fantasy world is built around a strange central
figure and is populated by all manners of cartoon creatures. In both films
the protagonists are loners who aren't accepted by society. The difference
between the two films, and the thing that will make the new flick a success
to Altman's ambitious failure, is Jim Carrey.</P>
<P>In a scant hour and a half or so of screen time, Carrey and makeup maestro
Rick Baker have created a living, breathing version of the creature that
came to life for so many of us in the Chuck Jones cartoon of 35 years ago.
Way back then, the Grinch became a sustained Christmas icon and Carrey and
crew have reinvented the creature whose heart "grew three times that day."
The best moments on the screen are when the Grinch is giving his mordant
soliloquies to no one save his faithful dog, Max. Remember how much you
liked Max in the original? You're going to like the new Max at least as
much, maybe more.</P>
<P>The Who world we are shown is glitzy and spangled with holiday cheer, but
it is a forced world, at best. The makeup for the adult Who population
takes on a feral quality that isn't very pleasant to look at and the petty
and selfish dealings of the Whoville mayor, May Who (Jeffrey Tambor), are
to be loathed. Only Cindy and her father Lou Lou Who (Bill Irwin) come
across with any intelligence or integrity. Momsen may be a little too old
to be an appropriate Cindy Lou Who, but the young actress makes her a real
person, I mean, Who. The rest of the Who world are consumed by their
rampant Christmas buying and holiday competition. Cindy's mom, Betty Lou
Who (Molly Shannon), is obsessed with having the best Christmas light
display and competes fanatically with her neighbor Martha May Whovier
(Christine Baranski), who, we come to find out, has the hots for the
Grinch.</P>
<P>Tech credits beyond Rick Baker's marvelous makeup are first-rate. Whoville,
created by production designer Michael Corenblith, is bright and colorful
with a slight off-kilter look that keeps up the fantasy flavor of the film.
The Grinch's lair has all the paraphernalia necessary for him to perpetrate
his grand theft of Who Christmas, including the requisite antler to
disguise Max as a reindeer. High marks are due costume designer Rita Ryack
who creates a furry skin for Carrey that is a match for Baker's makeup.
Lenser Don Petermen does a yeoman's job capturing the action on film.</P>
<P>The part of the story that recreates the venerable 30 minute TV show and
shows the Grinch go from lonely ogre to loving friend of the Whos is
captured with care by the filmmakers. Those things that are invented
specifically for the film - Who society, the flashback story on how the
Grinch became the lonely creature he is - do not have the same imagination
as the original Dr. Seuss work and it shows.</P>
<P>The brilliant casting of Jim Carrey and the intelligence to allow the actor
to become the character are what make "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" a
must see for the holiday season. It is certainly going to be a staple for
holiday video watching that will be a perfect companion piece to the
original. Carrey gives one of the most memorable performances of his career
and is a new Grinch icon. I'm still not a fan of the Whos, though, and I
give it a B.</P>
