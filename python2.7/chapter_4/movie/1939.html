<PRE>                         SUPER MARIO BROTHERS
                     A review by Steve Baumgarten
                           (<A HREF="mailto:sbb@panix.com">sbb@panix.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     Kiddie films are doomed to be dismissed by us professional film
critics almost regardless of how good they actually are.  And because
it's so easy to categorize a kiddie film as something that couldn't
possibly be worth seeing -- regardless of what the critics say -- a
vicious circle is set up: because you don't see it, you don't recommend
it to your friends, who themselves haven't seen and recommended it to
you.  So I expect that no one but eleven-year-old boys will wind up
seeing this summer's first big-budget kiddie film, SUPER MARIO BROS.</P>
<P>     As it happens, I'm entirely undiscriminating when it comes to
films that might, in some way, prove entertaining.  After all, I"m a
horror buff, and I've learned to sit through dozens of lousy horror
films on the off-chance that one of them might prove worth watching.
This is the "panning-for-gold" theory of movie-going, a technique
responsible for the success of an appalling number of truly awful
films.  How otherwise can we understand the success of the obviously
lousy film SLIVER, if not because people assume it will be just like
BASIC INSTINCT and so probably worth taking a chance on?  When it comes
to Hollywood films, far too many of us are willing to take our chances,
critics be damned.</P>
<P>     Yet whereas most people are willing to take a chance on a film
that's similar to one they've seen before, they're resolutely unwilling
to consider one that doesn't seem "suitable."  We want the "right" kind
of action, violence, sex, and story lines, so while we warmly embrace
insanely violent and graphic films like TOTAL RECALL and soft-core
exploitation films like BASIC INSTINCT, we'd never go see a really good
horror film.  And while CLIFFHANGER opened to a $20+ million box office
its first weekend, SUPER MARIO BROS. managed only $8 million, much of
which I suspect was tendered in nickels and dimes from smashed piggy
banks and horded allowances.</P>
<P>     But the eleven-year-olds have the right idea -- sometimes it's
best to be a little undiscriminating and take a chance on a movie that
might prove entertaining in a thoroughly unpredictable way.  As SUPER
MARIO BROS. does, consistently, with good humor, intelligence and wit.
It is as well-made, thoughtful, and respectful of its audience's
intelligence as CLIFFHANGER and SLIVER are mechanically assembled and
insulting -- and yet it is, first and foremost, a film for
eleven-year-olds.</P>
<P>     Quite a trick, and one rarely seen in the world of live-action
kiddie films.  But it's not as unusual as you might think: after all,
it's only recently that Disney has been making (and, more important,
marketing) their cartoons for an adult audience.  Before THE LITTLE
MERMAID, only animation fanatics suggested a trip to the cinema to see
SLEEPING BEAUTY or DUMBO; yet today no adult would bat an eye at such a
suggestion, and truth be told, most of us over the age of eleven await
the next Disney cartoon almost as eagerly as those who still get carded
at lemonade stands.</P>
<P>     That no one but the Nintendo-set was eagerly awaiting SUPER MARIO
BROS. made it all the more amazing to find that a silly, sloppy, poorly
made kiddie film was nowhere to be found.  In its place is a
well-directed and -edited film, featuring a top-drawer score by Alan
Silvestri; the best production design since BATMAN; enough special
effects to keep any eleven-year-old's (or even thirty-year-old's)
attention; and a truly goofy story line that's backed up with enough
Bullwinkle-style humor to keep everyone smiling.</P>
<P>     The story has little to do with the film's video game namesake;
although the instantly recognizable name reportedly cost the filmmakers
$2 million, it's obvious that the license was picked up purely for
marketing reasons.  The "Super Mario" name is enough of a hook to
attract attention and draw in the film's target audience, but beyond
that it doesn't play an important role in the film.  (In fact, Bob
Hoskins -- who plays Mario Mario -- claims not to have known what Super
Mario Bros. was before one of his children pointed to a squat,
mustachioed animated character jumping around on his television screen
and exclaimed "Dad!  That's you!".)  It's probably just as well, given
how limiting such a literal translation would be; instead, the
filmmakers felt free enough to devise their own story, and to a great
extent, their own world.  And it's this that makes SUPER MARIO BROS.
so successful and such a consistent joy to watch.</P>
<P>     Let me run through a few of the things I liked a whole lot about
this film.  First and foremost, the storyline has a certain resonance
for me.  It starts with a short prologue and the tag line "Brooklyn --
65 Million Years Ago"; in no time at all we've heard about the meteor
that crashed to earth and caused it to split into two dimensions: one
in which the dinosaurs became extinct and man eventually evolved to
take their place as rulers of the world; and another where the
dinosaurs themselves evolved into human-like form and run their own
slightly off-kilter society.  As a long-time resident of Brooklyn, I
found this to be entirely plausible -- I personally don't understand
why some critics found the storyline incomprehensible.  It's all very
well explained as the film goes along, and at the very least it's
internally consistent -- once you buy the premise, everything makes
sense.  (Contrast this with a film like CLIFFHANGER, which has a
premise only slightly more plausible, but doesn't make a whole lot of
sense once things get going.  At least once you've convinced yourself
that there might in fact be a parallel dimension ruled by the
descendants of dinosaurs -- and by Dennis Hopper in particular -- SUPER
MARIO BROS. doesn't insult your intelligence.  Even eleven-year-olds
have their self-respect, though Sylvester Stallone may not.)</P>
<P>     Hopper, who seems to be having an immense amount of fun in his
role as King Koopa, the ruler of the alternate dimension, is bent on
getting his claws on Princess Daisy and her magic amulet, which
contains a piece of the meteor that originally caused the split.  Once
the meteor is made whole again, the dimensions will be rejoined and
he'll be able to achieve his dream of total world domination.  (And let
me tell you:  if he decides to start by running for New York City
Council, he'll have no problem at all getting himself elected this
year.)  Standing between him and the culmination of his life-long dream
is Bob Hoskins as Mario Mario and John Leguizamo as Luigi Mario, two
small-time Brooklyn plumbers who -- just by the purest of coincidences,
mind you -- get to know Daisy and then do what they can to save her
when she's taken captive by Koopa's exceedingly silly henchmen.</P>
<P>     There's plenty more plot in this film, but what surprised me is
how the film itself only rarely got bogged down in the mechanical
aspects of moving the plot forward.  From beginning to end, this film
flows very smoothly from one entirely implausible situation to the
next, and it's rare that the filmmakers content themselves with a
generic chase scene, filmed over a backdrop of generic pop music.
Often the backdrops themselves are more diverting than the action in
the foreground: from the alternate Brooklyn, which is obviously a fond
take-off of BLADE RUNNER's Los Angeles; to Koopa's reelection posters
(Koopa on the environment: "Don't worry -- we'll get more."); to the
police cars involved in many of the film's chase scenes -- all powered
by an overhead electric grid.  It took me a while to realize that the
police cars were little more than glorified bumper cars, straight out
of an amusement park, and as such represented for eleven-year-olds the
coolest possible design for police cars you could have in an alternate
dimension.  Small touches like this either make or break a film;
putting aside SUPER MARIO BROS.' always striking production design (by
David Snyder), it's obvious that the police cars could have been
designed as little more than the kind of souped-up police cars you'd
expect to see in any city, regardless of dimension.  That someone sat
down and thought about what kind of police car would be absolutely
*right* for this city impresses me no end.</P>
<P>     The film deftly avoids any serious violence; likewise, there
aren't any cloying or maudlin scenes to suffer through.  Both Hopper
and Hoskins revel in their roles, and each manages to make what might
have been an ordinary villain or hero into a truly memorable character
(I particularly liked Hopper's attention to detail -- look carefully at
how he holds his hands as he walks around to see clearly the influence
of his great-grandfather the Tyranosaurus Rex).  I found it heartening
to see the very large number of alarmingly goofy touches scattered
throughout the production, from the exceedingly small-headed security
guards (the aptly named "Goombas") who chase the Mario brothers but
aren't too mean-spirited to get all silly and start dancing when they
hear the love theme from DR. ZHIVAGO; to Hopper's evolution /
de-evolution machine that can turn people into Einsteins or balls of
slime at the flick of a lever; to the mistakenly kidnapped Brooklyn
girls who, confined as they are in a sub-basement, sit around, smoke,
do their nails, and in every way act in perfect, stereotypical Brooklyn
girl fashion; to Koopa's henchmen, who trade lines like "You tried five
times and failed five times -- what percentage is that?"; to the street
food of choice, salamanders-on-a-stick.</P>
<P>     As a physical production, SUPER MARIO BROS. benefits greatly from
Alan Silvestri's outstanding score -- something missing from all too
many "adult" films these days; excellent 6-track Dolby sound design;
and some of the best special effects I've seen in a while, including
the much-maligned "morphing" process, which here isn't nearly as
annoying and trite as I expected it to be.  There's also the matter of
Yossi, Koopa's pet dinosaur, which is rendered through a combination of
stop- motion model, puppet, and computer-enhanced special effect well
enough to satisfy the dinosaur-lover in all of us.</P>
<P>     I can only think of one other kiddie film that had significant
appeal for adults: Mike Hodges' FLASH GORDON, which also featured a
striking production design, a fine score (by Queen), and a good amount
of tongue-in-cheek action.  But FLASH GORDON, fun as it was, played
every scene for maximum irony; the genius of SUPER MARIO BROS.  is in
its ability to play everything straight -- on the surface.  But it only
takes a moment or two to realize how much intelligence and wit are
backing up such a straight-faced production.  As Mario Mario says to
his brother Luigi: "Sure there were dinosaurs in Brooklyn.  There were
even Dodgers in Brooklyn."</P>
<P>     I fully intend to see this film again; my feeling is that for
every three sly references and witty asides I caught, there was
probably one I missed.  If you think any film with a name like SUPER
MARIO BROS. is beneath your adult sensibilities, all I can say is that
while when it comes to Hollywood films, it's usually "something
ventured, nothing gained", in this case it's just the opposite.  Much
to my surprise, I found this film to be one of the most enjoyable I've
seen all year, and I especially recommend it as an "antidote" to the
predictable, intelligence-insulting, mean-spirited and overly violent
CLIFFHANGER.  If you must see that film, see it first, then see SUPER
MARIO BROS.; you'll find that you enjoyed CLIFFHANGER a lot less in
retrospect, but at least you'll have seen one thoughtful and finely
crafted film out of two.</P>
