<PRE>                                MAVERICK
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     MAVERICK is an irreverent, zestful romp for three stars who team
up to poke fun at every imaginable Western cliche.  With winks in their
eyes, they play games with a runaway stagecoach, the hangman's noose,
crooked card games and bank robbers.  Their good spirits lift the
picture to inspired spoof status in the avalanche of New Age westerns.</P>
<P>     Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson), Annabelle Bransford (Jody Foster) and
Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) are charming rogues, con artists who
can barely contain the pleasure of their wicked ways.  Outdoing each
other is their delight, and they sustain the contest with good humor
for two hours.</P>
<P>     Maverick wears the persona of a gambler who pretends to be a
coward.  The truth of that lighthearted lie is that his gun fairly
jumps out of its holster every time someone crosses him, and he loves
every second of the confrontation.  On the prowl for entry fee money
for the poker sweepstakes in St.  Louis, Maverick sits down to a
small-town card game and meets Annabelle Bransford (Foster), whose good
looks mask her bad intentions.</P>
<P>     Gibson sets the tone in the first scene.  In the classic
catastrophe of the man with his head in a noose, astride a horse about
to turn skittish at approaching rattlesnakes, he begs his animal to
stay "steady, fella, don't move now." Any word or deed of substance
would be ridiculous after that, and, mercifully, none is forthcoming.</P>
<P>     Maverick is uncharacteristically slow to realize that Annabelle is
his match in deviltry, but when he does, their competition becomes the
funny bone of the movie.  Jodie Foster shows a new side of her talent.
Unpredictable, light and subtle, she plays equally well with each of
her leading men.  James Garner, who brought Maverick to the small TV
screen in 1957, deadpans the jokes with the same charm he used all
those years ago.  It's great fun to see him lean into a major role and
steal scenes from his young colleagues.  This is a happy band of
scoundrels.</P>
<P>     Filmed in the glorious country of Utah's Glen Canyon National
Recreation Area, the movie peppers the grand landscape with colorful
characters and ludicrous action.  Powered by jokes and sight gags, the
very thin plot leaves you waiting for the one-liners, and enough of
them come to keep most people happy.  But these spots of genuine fun
just aren't enough to make the whole thing a winner.</P>
<P>     When it starts to drag badly, the colorful finale of the St.
Louis poker game saves the day with a nice assist from James Coburn as
the man who can charge a $25,000 entry fee and still create an
extravaganza.  It is the charm of the principals that carries the
film.  Foster, Gibson and Garner have linked arms, it seems, caught the
script that was thrown them and said, "Let's have fun with this one."</P>
