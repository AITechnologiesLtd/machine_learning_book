<PRE>                          THAT OLD FEELING 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Bette Midler, Dennis Farina, Paula Marshall, Danny Nucci, Gail
O'Grady, David Rasche, Jamie Denton Director: Carl
Reiner Screenplay: Leslie Dixon</P>
<P>A warning. The review you are about to read will feature mood swings
not too dissimilar to those expressed by Midler and cast throughout
this laborious labour of love (the movie).</P>
<P>HATE: is the basis. A failed marriage, divorce and a illegitimate
daughter (Marshall) fourteen years ago. The players. The author father
(Farina) who slept with the interior decorator before marrying
her. The movie star mother (Midler) who slept with the marriage
counsellor before marrying him. HAPPINESS: when newlyweds. The
illegitimate daughter is to wed a promising young congress man. This
is soon followed by FEAR: when she has to invite her parents to the
wedding. ANGER: at a photographer who keeps taking 'fat pictures' of
the movie star mother.  JEALOUSY: when the movie star mother keeps
making 'liposuction' jokes about the interior decorator with much
tit-a-tat.  RAGE: as the bride's parents attempt to strangle each
other at the wedding reception. LUST: when car-rocking sex occurs
between the bride's parents outside the reception. DISMAY: when the
adulterous pair run off with each other, leaving the interior
decorator and marriage counsellor to sulk. This is followed by more
LUST, HATE, ANGER, REJECTION, GUILT, LUST, HATE, LUST, LUST, RAGE,
RAGE, LUST, HATE, LUST, HATE, RAGE, RAGE - Hey are you all beginning
to feel the beat of the movie?</P>
<P>This movie is an overload of confusing, schizophrenic emotions. The
audience is not allowed to settle into any particular mood or feel for
the movie, because of the tumulus over the top, hysterical shift of
emotions displayed between Midler and Farino.  They are either
persistently yelling at each other or kissing each other; and the
scary thing is that you never now when the mood is going to swing from
RAGE to LUST. If the director Carl Reiner was intending to make the
movie unpredictable with these overly-exaggerated personifications of
character, he has missed the plot, and achieved the unthinkable by
making his characters REPREHENSIBLE.</P>
<P>I am a great fan of Midler's work, but her character in this movie is
purely loud, without self-control. It is also partly the fault of the
script which lacks true witty dialogue. I don't know much about
Farina, but it is suffice to say he's a loud Italian. However, some
charm and redemption was brought to this movie by the petite,
delightful performance of Paula Marshall as the confused daughter. I
mean who wouldn't be confused after witnessing your parents display
such ABHORRENT shifts of temperament.</P>
<P>So which of these overused 'Old Feelings' could this movie possibly be
referring to? Could it possibly be LOVE? Well if memory serves
correctly - this is the one feeling mercifully forgotten by the
moronic handlings of director, cast and crew involved with this
pathetic fiasco of emotions. If you failed to get the 'feeling' of my
words, I was attempting to express great DISPLEASURE.</P>
<P>Comment: Air these negative, bottled up feelings somewhere else.</P>
<P>Feeling Scale: 0% *PAINFUL* / Indifference / Love 100%</P>
