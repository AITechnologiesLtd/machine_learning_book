<PRE>The Shawshank Redemption (1994)
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: A rare one. A grand and wise movie about cosmic patience, hope
found, and hope kept.</P>
<P>The beauty of THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is in the slow and careful way it
works towards its conclusion. Which is, I have to say, a deceptive one: the
movie starts by making you believe it's going to find its subject in one
man, but in reality is about another.</P>
<P>The two men in question are Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan
Freeman), inmates in Shawshank Prison. Dufresne, as we learn in the opening
credits, has been sentenced to two life sentences for murdering his wife and
her lover. We are shown quite plainly that he didn't do it, but in prison
everyon's innocent: his factual innocence means nothing there.</P>
<P>Dufresne is assaulted brutally over a period of years. The way the movie
deploys this is heartbreaking: this is not one of those cheapjack movies
where the hero sits up all night working to conceal a rock in his fist and
then creams his tormentors with one blow each. He will only be able to
survive by outlasting others, by outthinking them, and by putting himself
out of their reach.</P>
<P>Red is a procurer: for the right price, he can get you anything short of
escape. But in Shawshank, any escape is worth it -- even a poster of Rita
Hayworth -- and so Red is constantly in business. Dufresne and Red slowly
grow to like each other, Red warming to Dufresne's quiet, persistent manner.</P>
<P>Slowly, over the course of time, Dufresne begins to make changes in the way
the prison operates. He has all the time in the world; why not make the most
of it? And while this is happening, another, more subtle series of changes
is taking place inside Red -- one which we see dramatized in each of his
consecutive parole board meetings, ten years or so apart.</P>
<P>The movie is patient. There is no hurried scurrying from one forced plot
point to another, but instead the wonderful feeling of a story developing on
its own, flowing naturally from its material and its characters. And what
characters: as Dufresne, Tim Robbins is almost invisible, but all the better
for it. When he finally smiles and raises his face to the rain near the end
of the movie (in a shot which was better off being kept out of the
trailers), he's earned it. Freeman, as Red, does gradual things with his
role that are worth watching the movie a second time for. Maybe a third,
since he's a lot more important to the significance of the title than we
think at first.</P>
<P>There are some deviations from the original Stephen King novella, and some
people will no doubt find this irksome, although it's probably inevitable.
But they don't damage the movie as a whole -- in fact, it would probably
take nothing short of a missing reel of film to do that.</P>
