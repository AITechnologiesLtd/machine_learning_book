<PRE>Red Corner (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>** out of *****</PRE>
<PRE>Cast: Richard Gere, James Hong, Peter Donat
Written by: Robert King
Directed by: Jon Avnet
Running Time: 122 minutes</PRE>
<P>Red Corner, just like other movies of it's type (The Trial, Closet
Land), reaffirms why I'm never going to a foreign country.  Now how
many times have we seen a movie about an American (in this case,
Richard Gere) going to a foreign land (in this case, China), only to
be accused of some crime (in this case, murder and rape) and then
whining for the whole movie about American rights and ideals and all
that? I mean yeah sure, we're a great country and all, but how many
movies like this do we really need?</P>
<P>I'm not ruining anything by telling you that Gere is framed in the
film, because never once is the audience led to believe that there's
even the possibility of guilt on his part. Remember, movies today have
no guts. Instead, we just watch Gere deal with being imprisoned in a
foreign land, dealing with the foreign people, complaining about
foreign law, etc. etc. We even know from the beginning why he's being
framed, and this may sound stupid but it's technically all based
around a clone of the TV show Baywatch. Yes that's right, a rip-off of
Baywatch causes Gere to be framed for murder.</P>
<P>Red Corner is a film with no new concepts or ideas whatsoever, but yet
is still slightly compelling enough to remain watchable, for the most
part anyway. By the last 10 or 15 minutes though I was just ready for
the film to be over and done with. Once the culprits were revealed, I
just couldn't have cared less. [R]</P>
