<P>     DRINKING GAMES is an uninspired, often-insipid Generation X version 
of THE BIG CHILL.  Recycling plot elements from better films, DRINKING 
GAMES never establishes a unique identity.  From start to finish, this 
movie is derivative.  It's basically about a bunch of post-college 
friends spending a night sitting around a table, drinking, reminiscing, 
and speculating about the future.  There are an equal number of men and 
women, so, in the end, they pair off and have sex.  It's all pretty 
routine and predictable -- writer/director Joseph Lawson never attempts 
anything daring or original.</P>
<P>     The six friends -- Noah (Christian Leffler), Whitney (Dinah 
Leffert), Scott (Geoffrey Smith), JC (Brian Anthony), Alex (Melanie 
Koch), and Heather (Andrea White) -- gather following the funeral of 
Tara, a member of their inner circle who recently committed suicide.  
During their all-night gab session, they talk about everything from sex 
to reincarnation, including such offbeat topics as how to dispose of a 
dead body and giving an iguana an enema.  Few of the conversations are 
interesting, because none of the characters attains any aspect of three-
dimensionality.  We're a fly on the wall, watching these people as they 
drink themselves into oblivion as a balm to their grief, but we never 
get a sense of any genuine personalities beneath all the dialogue.</P>
<P>     The actors, all of whom are relative unknowns, acquit themselves 
nicely despite the script's limitations.  Dinah Leffert, who plays the 
sexually voracious Whitney, is especially noteworthy.  But the 
performances are about all that's worthwhile here.  Lawson may think he 
has his finger on the pulse of today's twenty-something men and women, 
but, as is the case in so many Generation X pictures, all he's doing is 
recycling familiar cinematic conventions.</P>
