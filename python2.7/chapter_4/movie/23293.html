<P>Susan Granger's review of "THE NEXT BEST THING" (Paramount Pictures)</P>
<P>  Madonna's fans will be lining up to see The Material Girl
tackle this timely, thoughtful dramatic comedy, directed by John
Schlesinger. What they don't realize is that America's first openly
gay leading man, Rupert Everett, steals the show, just the way he did
in My Best Friend's Wedding.  Madonna and Everett play best
friends. They're both bright, unconventional and impulsive - with
lousy taste in choosing lovers. One evening, after a few too many
drinks, they wind up in bed together - and, soon afterwards, she
discovers she's pregnant. Eager for motherhood, she offers Everett a
choice: he can either stay uninvolved, be the baby's "uncle," or
assume the role of father. He opts for fatherhood, so they decide to
live together and raise their son (Matthew Stumpf).  Theirs may not be
the perfect family - but it's the next best thing. Everett proves to
be an ideal father, putting the child's interests first and foremost,
refusing to develop other attachments in his life. Their good-natured,
non-traditional arrangement works superbly for several years - until
Madonna meets the man of her dreams (Benjamin Bratt) and ends up in a
nasty fight for custody of the boy. That's when Thomas Ropelewski's
character-driven script gets serious. Keep in mind, this is not a
controversy about homosexuality. It's about significant human
emotions, ties that bind, and commitment. Unfortunately, Bratt's
underdeveloped role is less sympathetic, particularly since the
audience has formed a compelling attachment to Everett, making the
courtroom scenes anticlimactic. And don't miss Madonna's rendition of
Don McLean's American Pie over the final credits. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, The Next Best Thing is a thoroughly enjoyable,
enigmatic 8 - asking: What is a father? What is a family?</P>
