<P>   This picture looks as though it were written by a committee,
but not your usual group of Hollywood honchos brainstorming
in the backlot of Universal Studios.  The panel would be
composed of Franz Kafka, Soren Kierkegaard, Jules Verne,
Sigmund Freud, Edgar A. Poe, and George Orwell.  They'd 
bat around some ideas for a fiction, cramming their signature
elements helter-skelter into a one-hundred page manuscript. 
The novel would eventually fall into the hands of Richard
Purvis, looking to compose his first feature screenplay, and
Eran Palatnik, seeking to direct his first feature movie.  A
limited budget would allow these two fellows only eighteen
days to shoot the genre-bender which, in just 84 minutes,
could be classified as noir, sci-fi, horror, political, or what-
have-you, but not comedy, as the dialogue lacks humor and
its principal performer never smiles.  How does it sound? 
Turns out "The Rook" is better than you might expect, an
intriguing detective story whose pieces come together only in
the concluding moments with a production design that mixes
clothing from the early 19th century with outfits of 1950s
design and positions a computerized office against the
English countryside circa 1800.  </P>
<P>   The world of "The Rook" looks like one imagined by a
medieval futurist, i.e. by someone living in the Britain of 1580
making like Alvin Toffler, dreaming up how the British
countryside would appear in 1800.  Given the nature of
religious warfare that took place in this visionary's Europe at
the time, he could not imagine a world at peace, but rather
considers that even if various religions ceased their clashing
with one another, at the very least humankind would be in
conflict over what function the state should have in religious
affairs.</P>
<P>   Martin Donovan dominates the film in the role of John
Abbott, a detective from Greenwich who travels by horse-
drawn carriage to the broken-down hamlet of Sutheridge to
investigate the murder of one Wain Sheperd.  He is escorted
to the morgue by the town's chief of police, Bob Brice (John
A. MacKay) who appears to cooperate.  Though the
investigation is stymied by a lack of evidence, Abbott is
supremely confident: he is a man of God who is convinced
that, given his religious principles, he will solve the murder. 
He is besieged by strange occurrences.  Someone has drawn
a coded message on the corpse, a drawing which later
appears on a wall.  Abbott becomes aware of a maze of
secret tunnels within the village.  He visits an office and
interviews a woman who sits on a chair that moves
mechanically back and forth--a seemingly useless device
fantasied by our unseen friend back in the 16th century.  That
fellow has imagined such a contraption just as he had
conceived of the first phone system and a prototype of Ada
Byron King's first thinking machine.  Showing up at the office
of Dr. Abby Trent (Diane Grotke), the woman who has
autopsied the murder victim, Abbott is told that he does not
have an appointment; and yet on the following day the
physician--dressed in 1950s clothing in contrast with Abbott's
Victorian threads--speaks freely with him.  During the entire
time the investigation of a single murder is proceeding, a
revolution is taking place and the town of Greenwich is about
to fall to the rebels.  Abbott is nonetheless convinced that the
forces or evil--that is, the insurgents who favor a separation
of church and state--will be defeated by the current autocratic
government with its established religion.  But as the
insurrectionists pile on victories, Abbott writes that he
believes that God has abandoned him.  Winding up alone and
wounded in a cave from which he envisions no escape, he is
forced to confront himself and discover his true convictions.</P>
<P>   What are director Eran Palatnik and writer Richard Purvis
getting at here?  Obviously this is no simple detective story
but an allegory, albeit with a limited budget and with a writer
and director who must have been captivated by their course
in Philosophy 101. In an interview reported in the production
notes, director Palatnik confesses that the movie means
whatever the viewer wants it to be mean.  The story line
lends itself to multiple interpretations, yet what is most
praiseworthy about the film is the degree of ambiance that
photographer Zack Winestine and composer Robert Een have
squeezed out of it, given their finite funding.  The office which
serves as the center of the local government bureaucracy
evokes the most curiosity with its movable chairs and creaky
decoding machines while the green hue eclipsing the town
invokes sheer corruption.  Donovan performs his role with
intense sobriety and is perhaps a symbolic stand-in for
today's self-righteous religious zealots who presume to have
all the answers but who are gradually doing themselves in
politically in the United States and in some fundamentalist
countries.  </P>
<P>   Palatnik means for us to figure the significance of the
movie's title, and if I may take a stab at it...a rook is the
chess piece representing the castle, in this case the particular
citadel of Kafka's story which was made into the film "The
Castle" in 1968.  Rudolf Noelte's movie starring Maximilian
Schell is, like "The Rook," an appropriately vague filmization
of the novel in which K, a land surveyor, is called to a castle
for work but (like John Abbott, at least symbolically) is unable
to gain admittance.  A rook is, of course, a swindle as well. 
Palatnik's film features a rather large one at that.  This is a
first feature which, however incoherent at times and at other
times conventional in plotting, portends a fertile future for its
director and scripter.</P>
