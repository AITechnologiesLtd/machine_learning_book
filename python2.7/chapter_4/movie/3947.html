<PRE>                                MORTAL KOMBAT
                       A film review by Jack Forrest
                        Copyright 1995 Jack Forrest</PRE>
<P>Starring Christopher Lambert as Rayden
and Bridget Wilson as Sonya Blade</P>
<P>        A wicked sorcerer named Shang Tsung has been holding tournaments
called "Mortal Kombat" for nine generations.  Everytime one of the contenders
dies at the hands of his combatants he can take their soul.  He needs a
great number of souls from great warriors to open the portal between the
earth realm and the dark realm so Shao Kahn, the Emperor of the dark realm,
can come to this dimension.  Shao Kahn gave Shang Tsung Goro, a Monster
Prince, to be his champion.  Goro was unstoppable because of his bronze
skin, being eight feet tall, having four arms and being immensely strong.
The main contenders are Liu Kang who is seeking revenge on Shang for killing
his brother, Sonya Blade who is trying to capture Kano, Kano who is working
for Shang Tsung, Johnny Cage who is trying to prove he is an amazing martial
artist not a phony actor, Sub-Zero who is working for Shang Tsung, Scorpion
who is working for Shang Tsung and hates Sub-Zero, and princess Kitana who
is the princess of the outworld.</P>
