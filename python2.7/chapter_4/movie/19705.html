<PRE>LAKE PLACID
**1/2 (out of five stars)
A review by Jamey Hughton</PRE>
<PRE>Starring-Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman, Oliver Platt and Brendan Gleeson
Director-Steve Miner
Rated 14A</PRE>
<P>Lake Placid is probably the best rampaging crocodile movie I've ever
seen. Oh wait... it's the only one I've ever seen. Yes, ruling out
1980's Alligator (which, of course, was about a rampaging alligator),
Lake Placid is in a league of it's own. Or... is it?</P>
<P>The set-up is short and sweet. After a mysterious and grizzly murder on
a small lake in Maine, local Sheriff Hank Keough (Brendan Gleeson) calls
in the necessary officials. They include Fish and Game warden Jack Wells
(Bill Pullman) and New York palaeontologist Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda),
called in to investigate an unusually large reptilian tooth found at the
murder scene. After they bicker for a while about the greeny locales and
buggy atmosphere, the group stumbles upon something very interesting
inhabiting the lake. Hint: it's not a giant mutated beaver.  It's a
30-foot crocodile which has supposedly swam all the way from Asian
waters and found a home in the peaceful confines of Black Lake. And so
they have to blow the croc up before it manages to chow down on more
local residents.</P>
<P>Actually, there is only one local: an eccentric old woman (played by
Betty White) who has adopted the big reptile as a pet, and feeds it her
own livestock on a regular basis. Former Golden Girl White spews out
many obscenities at the officials when they try to interfere, especially
when  they start asking questions about the strange disappearance of her
husband. Lake Placid was written by David E. Kelley (creator of Ally
McBeal and The Practice) in a campy, ludicrous but shamelessly
entertaining fashion. The croc hunt is merely an excuse to unite
Kelley's quirky characters in a unique situation. Yes, this film is
essentially a comedy with a premise that could be easily mistaken for
horror.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, a large portion of the budget has been dedicated to making
the monster look appropriately convincing. Creature effects Stan Winston
has created an excellent animatronic croc, and the computer generated
effects are, for the most part, largely impressive. Unfortunately, there
is a depressing lack of crocodile action to be found. The best scene
happens early on, when the beast attacks a helpless bear by slamming it
around like a sack of quivering potatoes. There are many brief scares,
but nothing entirely prolonged to hold your excitement for a period of
over four or five minutes. In a movie that clocks in at just under
ninety minutes, the thrills and chills are few and far between. Luckily,
Lake Placid does have a delightful sense of humor to at least compensate
for some of these shortcomings.</P>
<P>The cast tries hard to salvage the material. Fonda is originally fun,
but it soon becomes clear that Kelley is using her character as the
`woman in distress', and little more. She falls out of a boat about
eighteen times, and whines constantly to the dismay of the local law
enforcement. Pullman is earnest and charming, but carelessly wasted.
Chemistry between Kelly and Tom is flat and unconvincing from square
one, and their romantic interludes are too hollow to be relied upon on
such a regular basis. Needless to say, the movie belongs to two of the
supporting players. Irish actor Brendan Gleeson breaks through the
restrictions of his two-dimensional character and delivers an enjoyable
portrait of a distraught small town sheriff. And Oliver Platt continues
his string of authentic loons, playing an uninvited mythology professor
named Hector Cyr who regards crocodiles as treasured, `godly' creatures.
The insults exchanged between Hector and the sheriff are consistently
the best and funniest in the movie.</P>
<P>But somewhere, the fun expires. While Kelley's script delivers
unexpected laughs, it becomes unclear whether they are intentional or
lamely forced. And the actors can only do so much for the characters,
until their presence becomes meandering and pointless.</P>
<P>Of course, similarities to Jaws are obvious. How could you make an
underwater creature feature without avoiding them? Lake Placid is
ridiculously plotted, silly summertime entertainment for less demanding
viewers in need of bloody carnage. But folks, for a horror/comedy about
a lakeside man-eating crocodile, this ain't half bad.</P>
