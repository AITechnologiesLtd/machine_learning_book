<P>           Steven, Steven, Steven. Your movies used to be fun to
watch.  ``Hard To Kill,'' ``Marked For Death,'' the first ``Under
Siege'': terrific stuff.</P>
<P>  But somewhere along the line Mr. Seagal changed and so did
his films.  It's not enough for them to be simple entertainment now;
these days, they have to carry foreboding messages about social
responsibility and ecology.</P>
<P>  They also have to carry Seagal himself, which is too much
for any movie to bear. Early in his career, Seagal seemed to have a
sense of humor about himself: Recently, he's become a vainglorious
joke.</P>
<P>Barbra Streisand is often accused of admiring herself too much
but she's got nothing on Seagal, whose latest epics devote substantial
portions of their footage to lovingly lit close-ups of their star.</P>
<P>  At least Streisand has reasonably reliable taste in scripts.
Seagal chooses projects like ``Fire Down Below,'' which, despite its
title, has nothing to do with Bob Seger or sailors on shore
leave. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with entertainment either.</P>
<P>  Instead, ``Fire'' relies on the timeworn tale of
tight-lipped country folk hiding a dirty secret, in this case an
underground stockpile of toxic chemicals. Some of these poisons have
been leaking into the water supply, killing fish and giving some of
the young'uns powerful rashes.</P>
<P>  So EPA investigator Jack Taggart (guess who) goes undercover
in the rural hamlet of Jackson, Ky., as a minister's assistant. To
make sure he blends in with the locals, Jack packs a dazzling array of
expensive custom leather jackets, sporting everything from fringe to
candy-stripes, and to get maximum use from this wardrobe he changes
coats at least a couple of times a day.</P>
<P>  That's typical of the foolishness that runs throughout
``Fire Down Below,'' even behind the scenes. While Seagal poses and
preens, he warbles several country-fried tunes offscreen, and suffice
to say there won't be a run on the soundtrack album.</P>
<P>  Marg Helgenberger takes her best stab at playing Jack's love
interest, the kind of tormented backwoodsy recluse Helen Reddy used to
sing songs about. The stultifying aw-shucks courtship between the two
is like a nightmarish version of ``The Bridges of Madison County,''
and an incest subplot involving Helgenberger and her wild-eyed brother
(Stephen Lang) is laughably mishandled.</P>
<P>  A slumming Kris Kristofferson drops by a few times as a
generic corporate meanie, a sleazy casino owner who has a bedroom
adjacent to his business office. His redneck henchmen seem to exist
solely so that Jack can snap their bones and they can sing his praises
afterward, noting ``I've never been hit so hard in my life!'' and ``I
think he broke my jaw!''</P>
<P>  Like his earlier turkey ``On Deadly Ground,'' ``Fire Down
Below'' also makes time for Seagal to - quite literally - take the
pulpit and sermonize on the evil that rich people do to the
environment for the love of money.  The speech is so heavy-handed it
would make Jane Fonda squirm, and it somehow never mentions the
pollution wealthy Steven Seagal has dumped in our theaters in the form
of ``Fire Down Below.''</P>
