<P>Sometimes when I feel lazy I sit on the couch and flip through satellite TV 
channels. One of my discoveries is a station called Granada Plus. In the 
daytime it airs a lot of the programmes that I saw when growing up  -- cop 
shows like "Starsky and Hutch" and "Cagney and Lacey", as well as 
science-fiction fare like "The Time Tunnel", "The Incredible Hulk", "The Six 
Million Dollar Man", "Lost in Space" and "Star Trek".</P>
<P>I thought of such delicious pieces of pop culture while watching "Galaxy 
Quest". The movie opens at a comic book convention, where the celebrity 
guests were performers in a very "Star Trek"-like TV show called, well, 
"Galaxy Quest". It was cancelled in the early 1980s, and now its actors are 
out of work, spending their time showing up at gigs to sign autographs. Main 
star Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), who bears a suspicious resemblance to William 
Shatner, is a goofball who drinks too much and takes his fans' affections for 
granted. Blonde bombshell Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver) still laments that 
interviewers only ever asked her about her breasts. Classically-trained 
thespian Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman) is known for his moaning: "I played 
Hamlet once!" he wails into the mirror.</P>
<P>These guys, along with three other former cast members, run into some 
strange-looking fans who talk in robotic voices and make jittery movements. 
They make a plea of Jason, which he interprets as a request for another star 
appearance. As it turns out, though, this band of admirers are actually 
aliens who have seen and admired "Galaxy Quest" from outer space, believing 
it to be a set of historical documents. They want help from their heroes to 
battle their intergalactic foes.</P>
<P>After a period of initial shock, Jason excitedly leaps into this opportunity. 
"It'll be fun! Just like being on the show!" His colleagues have to take him 
aside to remind him that they are not real space warriors, just actors. Not a 
problem, it turns out: The friendly aliens' spaceships have been modelled on 
those of "Galaxy Quest", and the controls have been based on the actors' 
movements.</P>
<P>What I love about this movie is that it replicates the feel, structure and 
rhythm of sci-fi adventures with a rejuvenating sense of lightheartedness. In 
other words, it's as exciting as those old shows were from a kid's point of 
view, and very funny, too. The film has a lot of self-referential dialogue, 
but that's nothing new any more -- its general sense of whimsy is much more 
enjoyable. And it has a moment I've been waiting to see for years: Instead of 
the spaceship pulling out of its tiny loading bay with perfect ease, the 
pilot ends up bumping it against the wall, and having to say "Oops! Sorry!"</P>
<P>The cast is terrific. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman and Tony 
Shalhoub are familiar faces, and look so out of their depth in the middle of 
all this silliness that of course we find ourselves smirking. They also 
create characters we care about. Just because they're in a comedy doesn't 
mean they turn into robots who spit out one-liners -- they interact like real 
people, making everything they have to deal with just that little bit more 
absurd, and entertaining.</P>
