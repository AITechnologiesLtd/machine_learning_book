<PRE>                    BABE: PIG IN THE CITY
                A movie review by Joe Barlow
                    (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:  Magda Szubanski, James Cromwell, Mickey Rooney
DIRECTOR:  George Miller
WRITERS:   George Miller and Judy Morris
RATED:     G
RELEASED:  1998</PRE>
<PRE>          RATING: ** 1/2 (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        As a critic, "Babe: Pig in the City" paints me into a
difficult corner: on one hand, I was charmed by the sheer visual
delights which awaited me; on the other, I was mortified that
Hollywood actually considers this a "family" film.  Parents who
are expecting a light-hearted distraction for little Junior had best
be warned: young children have no business anywhere near this
movie.  The simple fact that "Babe: Pig in the City" (which for
the sake of brevity will henceforth be referred to as "Babe II")
received a G rating is a disconcerting affirmation of just how far
out of touch the MPAA is with its own rating system.</P>
<P>        "Babe II" is a contradiction in terms, a disquieting but
frequently enchanting blend of humor, warmth and darkness that
has the misfortune of being marketed as children's entertainment.
It's hard to review a film like this, as two of the factors I use to
critique movies are: 'How entertained was I?' and 'How successful
is the movie in achieving its goals?'  With "Babe II," there's a
substantial conflict in the answers to these questions: while I was
admittedly entertained, I was also shocked by the story's surprisingly
dark tone.  It's as if director George Miller is trying to mimic the
style of Tim Burton's "Batman," but replaces the grim, human
characters with funny, colorful animals who talk and sing.  Talk
about surreal!</P>
<P>        The bleak overtones start early, with kindly farmer Arthur
Hoggett (James Cromwell) suffering a severe accident for which his
beloved pet pig Babe (voiced by Elizabeth Daily) is inadvertently
responsible.  Unable to work, Hoggett stands in danger of losing his
farm to the bank.  His wife Esme (Magda Szubanski) takes matters
into her own hands, and heads to a county fair to give a demonstration
of Babe's sheep-herding skills (depicted in the first film), an event
which will help raise the money needed for the mortgage payment.  Fate
conspires against them, however, and through no fault of their own
they miss their connecting flight, leaving them with a multiple-day
layover in a strange city.</P>
<P>        Eventually finding a hotel that will allow pets, Mrs. Hoggett
thinks the worst of her trip is over.  She is mistaken.  Babe is
essentially pig-napped by Fugly Floom (Mickey Rooney), a clown who
uses chimpanzees as part of his act.  Babe is eager to participate,
mistakenly believing that his show-business antics are helping the
farm: "I'm a pig on a mission," he explains proudly when the other
animals question him.  The hotel has its own problems, however: the
dozens of animals who live there are a clear violation of city health
laws, and the hotel operates much like the Underground Railroad, with
animals sheltered in secrecy, out of sight of the villainous law
enforcement agencies.</P>
<P>        This tone of shadow may not sit well with many viewers,
particularly those who liked the upbeat innocence of the first film.
"Babe II" is to "Babe" what "The Empire Strikes Back" was to
"A New Hope"; a mature, thoughtful work, covered by a layer of
darkness.  Be aware: animals and human alike are severely injured
(and nearly die) on at least three occasions in the film.  A chase
sequence between Babe and a mob of angry dogs could potentially
horrify young children.  And a scene in which the hotel is raided
by animal catchers is so bleak that I was reminded of the liquidation
of the Ghetto, from "Schindler's List."  While I did not personally
object to the tone, I remain unsure who "Babe II" is supposed to
appeal to: families who enjoyed the first film?  No, not really.
Fans of film noir?  No, because they're unlikely to see a movie
starring talking animals.</P>
<P>        One thing for which Miller cannot be faulted is a lack of
vision: the city in "Babe II" looks great, recalling the looming
skyscrapers and slippery shadows that marked "The Crow,"
"Dark City," and the aforementioned "Batman."  Comparisons
with Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" are unavoidable, and the film beats
viewers to the punch by borrowing the name of Lang's wonderous city
(the film's working title was "Babe in Metropolis").  As envisioned
by Miller, Metropolis is a city unencumbered by both time and space:
The Statue of Liberty is visible on the horizon, along with the Eiffel
Tower, the Hollywood sign, the canals of Venice, and other instantly
recognizable landmarks from around the world.  Modern cars share the
road with Model-T Fords, and we understand the point: Metropolis
exists anywhere and everywhere.</P>
<P>        Fans of the original "Babe" may be a little disappointed by
the fact that Babe himself isn't really the focus of this outing;
although the plucky little pig gets plenty of screen time, the
emphasis is more on the interaction of the animals, all of whom work
together to solve the various dilemmas, rather than on Babe himself.
Most of the important resolutions occur despite, rather than because
of, his presence here.  That's not to say that Babe is irrelevant to
the story; he functions as a sort of lighthouse through the dark
events, dispensing advice and wisdom.  (A mean stray dog explains, "I
have a professional obligation to be malicious."  Babe helpfully
suggests, "Maybe you should change professions.")</P>
<P>        But if Babe is content to stay in the background for much of
the time, the story doesn't really suffer.  Dozens of animals dot the
landscape of Metropolis, all of whom are fun and interesting in their
own right (watch for the singing cat choir!).  My favorite character
by far was a Godfather-like orangatan named Thelonius (voiced by James
Cosmo), who possesses a sad weariness that suits his character
perfectly.  You can actually see the regret in his eyes as certain
events unfurl, giving him a better range of expression than some of
the human characters.  He's a shoo-in for "Best Supporting Chimp."</P>
<P>        "Babe II" isn't a bad film by any stretch of the word: I found
it visually stunning and a great deal of fun; nonetheless, I think it
will distress its intended audience: young children are going to be
confused or scared (if not both) by what they discover in this
particular city.  My relatively low rating of two and a half stars is
an attempt at compromise: I liked the film a good deal more than
this review indicates, but I can't actually "recommend" it with a
clear conscience to anyone under the age of ten.</P>
