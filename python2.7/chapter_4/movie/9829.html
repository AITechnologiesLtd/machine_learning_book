<PRE>I'M A DREAMER (AREN'T WE ALL?)</PRE>
<PRE>by Kristian Lin</PRE>
<P>There's still some time left, but I'm nominating A LIFE LESS ORDINARY as
the year's most unfairly bashed film.  You'd hate to think of a better
film getting worse treatment from the critics.  There have been some
good reviews, but the early negative ones have probably killed whatever
chance this movie had of doing much business.   That's too bad, because
A LIFE LESS ORDINARY is a true oddity with enough marvels in it to
gratify you.</P>
<P>This road film begins when a recently-fired janitor named Robert (Ewan
MacGregor) decides to kidnap Celine (Cameron Diaz), a spoiled heiress on
the outs with her father.  They're pursued by two angels (Delroy Lindo
and Holly Hunter) who are masquerading as hit men and whose real mission
is to make sure that Robert and Celine fall in love.</P>
<P>Most of the bad notices have taken an aggrieved tone of "How dare the
people who made TRAINSPOTTING do something as light as this?"  You'd
think that the reviewers would appreciate the adventurous spirit that
director Danny Boyle and writer John Hodge bring to this genre picture. 
Instead, though, they've criticized the filmmakers for going off the
rails, as if the Coen brothers or Quentin Tarantino never went too far. 
A LIFE LESS ORDINARY isn't a great film, and it certainly isn't fully 
realized the way TRAINSPOTTING is.  But the filmmakers seem relieved to
have turned from TRAINSPOTTING's bleakness to making this giant piece of
candy.  Yes, Boyle and Hodge lose their judgment in the last half hour,
and the movie's ending really goes splat.  That's more than compensated 
for by the number of ideas that take flight, like Robert serenading
Celine with a karaoke version of "Beyond the Sea."  The dance that
follows has an exhilarating lyrical joy that you won't find in any of 
Boyle's previous movies.  A LIFE LESS ORDINARY may be excessive, but
it's certainly preferable to the slick, soulless efficiency of Boyle and
Hodge's debut film, SHALLOW GRAVE.</P>
<P>In addition to the filmmakers' off-kilter point of view, A LIFE LESS
ORDINARY also boasts some old-fashioned movie-star glamor.  Early on,
Robert is accosted by a menacing redneck named Tod Johnson (a hilarious
Maury Chaykin).  Just when the scene seems to be building to a
hysterical climax, it goes in an entirely different direction, as Celine
defuses the situation by showing up wearing a bedsheet and spinning 
a story about Robert being a pop star who's hiding from the press with
his new wife.  The scene was obviously written with a disarmingly sexy
actress in mind, and could have easily fallen flat, but Cameron Diaz,
who proves what a nimble actress she is, brings it all.  Diaz, you'll
remember, put some teeth into a wimpy, underwritten part in MY BEST
FRIEND'S WEDDING.  Here, she's not afraid to emphasize Celine's
unattractive side, playing the character as bratty, impatient,
headstrong and dangerous to be around - she even points a gun at a
12-year-old girl's head.  Now how many actresses could get away with
that?  Diaz does, and it's because she finds the neglected child inside
the character and lets her find redemption when she falls in love.</P>
<P>So completely does she inhabit the character that she darned near
obliterates MacGregor, engaging and hugely talented fellow that he is. 
That's only appropriate, since Celine takes over her kidnapping, that 
Diaz take over the movie.  Nevertheless, he projects a genuine and
unobtrusive sweetness that's really likeable, and it's refreshing to see
the lead in a movie like this behaving unheroically.  One of the movie's 
funnier scenes comes when he's told he's going to be killed - and he
bursts into tears.  Still, even though Celine's attraction to Robert's
regular-guy charm is credible, MacGregor's overmatched by his leading 
lady.</P>
<P>Something similar happens with the angels.  Holly Hunter and Delroy
Lindo have been paired up not because of their chemistry (which they
have little of), but because of how they look together.  Lindo's a 
fine actor who has a nice understated moment when he reminisces about a
girl he once knew, but Hunter gets the better of this duo.  Her accent
goes from Cruella de Vil to a fearsome hillbilly drawl, she vamps 
madly when auditioning for the hit man job, and gets this terrifying
gleam in her eye when she menaces the lovers with a gun as she's hanging
onto the hood of their truck.  She can be bizarre and intense under 
normal circumstances, and here she's downright crazed, but the odd part
is that she's somehow cuddly, too.  It's possible that this is her
funniest performance to date.</P>
<P>To be sure, A LIFE LESS ORDINARY is definitely not for everyone.  A lot
of violence is played for laughs, which doesn't always work.  The
filmmakers really let their imaginations run amuck, and it results 
in a wildly uneven crazy quilt of a film.  But A LIFE LESS ORDINARY is
more than good enough to deserve a following, and the tremendous skill
and inspiration of Danny Boyle and John Hodge renders them as promising
as any other new filmmakers in the world.</P>
