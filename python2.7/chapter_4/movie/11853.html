<PRE>"She So Lovely" (USA/France, 1997)
A Film Review by James Kendrick</PRE>
<P>Director: Nick Cassavetes / Screenplay: John
Cassavetes / Stars: Sean Penn (Eddie), Robin
Wright Penn (Maureen), John Travolta (Joey), Harry
Dean Stanton (Shorty), Debi Mazar (Georgie), James
Gandolfini (Kiefer), Kelsey Mulrooney (Jeanie) /
MPAA Rating: R / Review: ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>The only way to approach "She's So Lovely" is with
the understanding that everyone in the film is
crazy in one way or another. Their decisions are
illogical and often infuriating, and the movie has
no pretension of passing judgment on them or even
understanding why they are the way they are. You
must come to this film with the anticipation that
little or nothing about these characters makes
sense, because if you try to understand them, you
will be completely frustrated.</P>
<P>Personally, I am not a big fan of this kind of
film, and I have to admit this movie frustrated
me. I don't mind crazy characters, but I like to
have some kind of reasoning behind their mania. In
movies like "She's So Lovely," the characters'
weirdness is just taken for granted with no frame
of reference, and it gives license for the
filmmakers to do almost anything, because it can
be explained away. Remember, they're crazy -- it
doesn't have to make sense.</P>
<P>The film was directed by Nick Cassavetes, the son
of legendary actor and pioneer independent
writer/director John Cassavetes, who wrote the
script. The elder Cassavetes had originally
intended to direct and star in the film himself
back in the 1970s, but he was never able to get
the project off the ground before he died in 1989.
While his son's directing style is much more
controlled and refined than his father's, he
respects the manic people which are so dear to his
father. Alcoholism, insanity, and violence are all
at the heart of "She's So Lovely," although at
times it's intended to play as a comedy.</P>
<P>The film opens with Maureen (Robin Wright Penn),
waking up in a drunken stupor to find that her
husband, Eddie Quinn (Sean Penn) is still missing
after three days. She's pregnant, and apparently
Eddie is having trouble dealing with that fact, so
he tends to disappear for days at a time. She goes
down to the seedy, smoke-filled local bar where
Eddie usually hangs out, but his best friend
Shorty (Harry Dean Stanton) hasn't seen him.
Maureen ends up having drinks with her neighbor,
Kiefer (James Gandolfini), and when they go back
up to his apartment, he attacks her and beats her
up.</P>
<P>Maureen is terrified that Eddie will find out
Kiefer beat her up, because she knows Eddie is
slightly imbalanced and has an intense violent
streak. So, when she finally finds him, she lies
and says she fell. It doesn't take Eddie long to
figure out what happened, and he goes after Kiefer
with a gun. Maureen calls the local mental
institution to pick Eddie up, and when the
orderlies arrive to take him away, Eddie shoots on
of them in the stomach. He is eventually caught by
the police, and locked up in the institution.</P>
<P>Fast forward ten years, and Maureen has cleaned
herself up, gotten off drugs, divorced Eddie,
stopped wearing heavy black eye make-up, and is
now married to a rich contractor named Joey (John
Travolta). She and Joey have three daughters, one
of whom is actually Eddie's, and they live in
comfortable suburban splendor. Unfortunately, that
splendor is disrupted when Eddie is released from
the institution, and comes looking for Maureen,
sure that he still loves her and she still loves
him. In fact, he's absolutely right. Maureen tells
Joey to his face the morning Eddie is being
released, "I love you, but I love him
<I>more</I>."</P>
<P>"She's So Lovely" begins and ends very abruptly.
Many people will be extremely baffled by it,
especially because the previews made it look like
a quirky romantic comedy. The movie seems to want
to tell a simple story, but it has everything
going against it. It comes at you in sudden
bursts, and there is little explanation about
characters or situations. For instance,
Maureen-Eddie and Maureen-Joey is bridged with a
black screen and the titles "Ten Years Later."
There movie doesn't go into how and why Maureen
and Joey got together and, more importantly, why
their marriage seems so unhappy.</P>
<P>Although it's readily apparent that Maureen will
most likely leave Joey for Eddie, you don't feel
sorry for Joey because he's a loud-mouthed,
obnoxious, boor of a man. Was he like this when
Maureen first met him? If he was, is it because
she's naturally attracted to crude, violent men?
In fact, the movie doesn't give us anyone to
identify with (unless you're a sociopath), so we
are given the strange opportunity to sit back and
not take sides while Maureen, Eddie, Joey and even
Shorty fight it out in the living room like a
sitcom on acid.</P>
<P>The saving grace of "She's So Lovely" are the
performances, especially Sean Penn's which won him
top honors at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. His
Eddie is a constant enigma, ranging from fiercely
violent to almost child-like passivity. Travolta
plays strongly against type, and it is only his
insensitive idiocy that adds any laughs to the
film. Robin Wright Penn, who is married to Sean
Penn in real life, gives an affecting performance
as the woman caught in the middle (although her
New York accent is a bit overbearing at times).
She is the most confusing character because you
keep wanting to believe that she is sane, when in
fact, she may be the craziest person in the whole
movie.</P>
<P>"She's So Lovely" is really more of a curiosity
piece than anything else. It's not really
satisfying as a well-told story or as a character
study, so it can only be taken as an off-beat
movie that defies all the typical rules of comedy
and drama. Not for all tastes, but some will find
it quite fascinating, although I wasn't one of
them.</P>
