<P>Ever get claustrophobic even though you have an entire city in which to
roam?  That's just how Tanya and Artyom feel when they try to move from
Moscow to London in Last Resort, the first film from Shooting Gallery's 2001
Film Series.  The film, which could possibly redefine the word "bleak," has
won awards at a number of festivals and garnered director Pawel Pavlikovsky
the Most Promising Newcomer Award at the British version of the Oscars.</P>
<P>Upon arrival in the UK, young mother Tanya (Dina Korzun) and her
ten-year-old son Artyom (Artyom Strelnikov) are given the third degree by a
customs officer.  Tanya, who doesn't have a firm grasp of the English
language, explains she and her son are heading to London to meet her fiancé.
Because she has little money and no work permit, Tanya tells the customs
officer she's a refugee in the hopes they'll leave the pretty children's
book illustrator alone long enough to contact her beau.</P>
<P>They don't, though.  Tanya and Artyom are taken to coastal Stonehaven, which
is, essentially, a holding area for immigrants that England doesn't want
wandering around London.  They get a free flat (in a building called
Dreamland," of all things) and vouchers for food, but as political asylum
applicants, they must stay in Stonehaven for at least a year.  Withdrawing
the application can take up to six months.  So Tanya is stuck with no work
permit (and no jobs even if she had one) and a fiancé who won't return her
calls (shades of Felicia's Journey) while she tries to get by in a drab town
full of security cameras and fish dinners that contain no fish at all.</P>
<P>While the street-smart Artyom (think a Growing Pains-era Leonardo DiCaprio)
begins to associate with a seedy crowd, two men offer to give Tanya (think a
Russian Emily Watson) a hand - one is a successful businessman and the other
is an ex-con.  The entrepreneur is an Internet porn guru (Lindsey Honey -
he's the Al Goldstein of the U.K.) who wants Tanya to drop her knickers for
a live video stream that could net her big bucks.  The ex-con (Paddy
Considine, Born Romantic), a kindly arcade manager and part-time bingo
caller (making Resort the second Brit film of the year to feature a bingo
caller - the other is House!), is a sweetie who falls for Tanya, befriends
her boy and helps them out with furnishing and decorating their tiny
apartment.</P>
<P>Resort, which has an ending that's just about as un-Hollywood as they come,
is reminiscent of Jim Jarmusch's Down By Law, which featured characters
spending the entire film trying to escape from a dreary place only to end up
in a place just as dreary.  Pavlikovsky, who has made a career of filming
documentaries for the BBC (they financed Resort, too), does a great job
wielding his handheld camera to make this film feel like a documentary, as
well.  He and cinematographer Ryszard Lenczewski also add a few startlingly
well-composed shots that are beautiful, yet add to Resort's overall
dreariness.</P>
<P>1:17 - Not Rated but contains adult language, brief nudity and strong sexual
content</P>
