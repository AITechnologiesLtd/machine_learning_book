<P>There are undoubtedly thousands of kids in America who are growing up in
dismal situations similar to that of Homer Hickam, the young hero of
"October Sky," and for them, this movie could provide a much-needed shot
of inspiration.</P>
<P>After all, the real-life Hickam managed to use his brain to escape a
trap of a small town, at a time when the only possible way for boys like
him to get to college was on a football scholarship. His is a story that
says there's no shame in being smart, and it could easily lead younger
viewers to think seriously about what they want to do with their
futures.
But far from being a sermonette about the virtues of  education,
"October Sky" is spirited, exciting entertainment that delivers on any
number of levels - and you don't have to be a youngster to enjoy it.</P>
<P> Taken from Hickam's book "Rocket Boys," the screenplay by Lewis Colick
skillfully sidesteps most of the potential pitfalls of such a
rags-to-rockets tale and, on the occasions when it stumbles upon a
cliche, "Sky" usually finds a way to reinvent it.</P>
<P> As played by Jake Gyllenhaal - he looks like a friendlier, more
emotionally balanced Robert Downey Jr. - Homer is remarkably easy to
identify with, an athletic underachiever who lives in the shadow of his
older brother Jim (Scott Miles), a star with the Big Creek Owls football
team. Most of his friends have problems of their own: Roy Lee (William
Lee Scott) is regularly devastated by his alcoholic stepfather; O'Dell
(Chad Lindberg) lost his father in a mining accident; brainy Quentin
(Chris Owen) is regarded as an object of ridicule by his classmates.
And, as the name tells us, the boys' hometown of Coalwood, W.Va., offers
exactly one occupational opportunity.</P>
<P> With the October 1957 launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union, "things'll
never be the same again," says Homer's teacher Miss Riley (Laura Dern).
She's talking about the international balance of power, but she might as
well be referring to the lives of Homer and company, who challenge
themselves to build a working rocket of their own in the face of
overwhelming skepticism, particularly from Homer's dad (Chris Cooper)
who regards the conquest of space as "a novelty."</P>
<P> "Sky" works as well as it does because of a feeling of total conviction
from everyone concerned, from director Joe Johnston ("The Rocketeer,"
"Jumanji") on down. Barry Robison's production design offers a vividly
drab depiction of 1957 West Virginia, from the well-weathered bleachers
adorned with the motto "for our Owlstanding fans" to the mine elevator
that looks like a man-eating prison cell. Sincerity rings in the acting
of Gyllenhaal, Dern and Cooper, while the scene-stealing Scott and
Natalie Canerday as Homer's mom who dreams of tropical paradises turn
their
supporting roles into little triumphs. James Sanford</P>
