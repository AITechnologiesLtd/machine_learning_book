<P>    Freud once threw up his arms in frustration and said,
"What do women want?"  The most incisive answer usually
given by people who know women or at least have seen
hundreds of romances on the screen is that women want
men who can make them laugh.  This is valid.  What Kwyn
Bader may be adding to that in his quirky little fluff of a
comedy, "Loving Jezebel," is, surprisingly enough, that
women want men who love women.  Bader does not, of
course, mean that a woman wants her man to be looking at
every pretty sight that passes in the street, but there is a
difference between an egotistical Lothario and a basically
healthy guy who genuinely likes, repeat, genuinely likes, the
opposite sex.</P>
<P>    The idiosyncratic but otherwise normal fellow in this film,
Theodorus Melville (Hill Harper), turned out OK despite his
having an irritating mom, Alice (Phylicia Rashad) who often
does her best to convert her vigorous son into a mixed-up
dude with an unresolved Oedipal conflict.  In the one scene
that can give audience members the willies, she asks the
young man not to go out on a date but to stay home with her-
-as she sits beside him on the sofa and holds his hand.</P>
<P>    The women he dates are, like the mom, all eccentric, but
not a one is really irritating.  This is part of what raises
"Loving Jezebel" well above yet another 20-something sitcom
with a plodding narration.  Bader opens the movie toward the
end of the story as the delightfully confused and paradoxically
focussed Theo races grabs a coat and almost literally flies
out the back door just a few paces ahead of a gun-toting
man, Gabe Parks (David Moscow), whose wife Samantha
(Laurel Holloman) has been seeing Theo behind Gabe's
back.  To explain the background of his plight, Theo, with
heavy use of narration, takes us back to his kindergarten
class where he is smitten for the first time with a girl who
soon ditches him for another man.  As he moves up the
grades to Brooklyn's wonderful school, Poly Prep (my alma
mater) and then to Columbia College, Theo has unusual
flings with a plethora of women who all sense that the man
genuinely loves their gender, causing troubles as well with
the men he befriends throughout his school years.  Yet all the
women are using him as an interim boy friend (oh, the
delights of being used), including one with a fetish for stuffed
Winnies the Pooh (Elisa Donovan); the cultured Trinidadian,
Mona (Sandrine Holt)' and nicest of all the unhappily married
poet, Samantha (Laurel Holloman)--who is the only one in
Theo's life who genuinely loves him.</P>
<P>   Kwyn Bader, using his own screenplay, has created a work
that will remind any moviegoer of Woody Allen and Spike
Lee, as his central character exhibits both the anxieties of Mr.
Allen (as in "Small Time Crooks") and the congenial
assertiveness of Spike Lee in the role of Mars in that
director's funky 1986 film "She's Gotta Have It."  One of the
whimsical scenes has Theo chasing after Frances (Nicole Ari
Parker) on the college campus--which mimicking Mars's plea
to a girl, "Please baby, please baby, please baby."</P>
<P>    The breeziness of the relationships is matched by some
sharp writing, as when Samantha counsels Theo, "You loved
all these women--except maybe the one with the Winnie
dolls," sewing up her case by telling Theo that "You loved
that elusive part that allows them to follow their passions, the
part that wants understanding and tenderness."  This is a
surprisingly refreshing comedy.</P>
