<PRE>                                  THE SPECIALIST
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Luis Llosa
Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, James Woods, Rod Steiger,
          Eric Roberts
Warner Bros.</PRE>
<P>     Once upon a time Warner Bros. churned out B gangster movies at an
incredible rate.  Some of these were punishment films.  A popular star
would get the notion he or she could refuse scripts or ask for more
pay, and he or she would be forced to star in a B film.  This told them
who was boss, the studio.  They would work with a group of standard
Warner contract actors and studio hack technicians on some left over
sets.  Cut in some  stock footage and in a few weeks the studio had a
violent genre piece, based on some trash novel the studio bought at
bargain prices.</P>
<P>     It is fitting that Warner Bros should be behind this overwrought
action misfire.  It plays like a punishment picture.  The dialogue is so
corny and the plot so transparent, that you can hardly believe A-list
stars are in it.  Character development is like examples from a
how-to-write-good book.  Sly Stallone is sensitive, show him adopting a
stray cat.  Sly Stallone is un hombre mas macho.  Show him throwing a
radio-weilding punk out of a bus window.  Show him flex for no real
reason.  Sharon Stone is a femme fatale bent on revenge.  Give her blue
tinted flashbacks, over and over again.  Give her peek-a-boo costumes
and let her walk into exclusive parties without an invitation.  Give her
double entendre dialogue about the heat from Sly's controlled
explosions.  Hype her nude scene all over TV and magazines for months.
That and the explosions are really all the film is about.</P>
<P>     The supporting B-film cast is on firmer ground doing what they do
best, trying to breathe some sense of life into ridiculous dialogue and
ponderous scenes.  They try but lose an uphill battle.  The big book on
how to make bad films highly recommends casting people to play the most
distant ethnic group from their real one.  Rod Steiger is a master at
this.  He discovered long ago that when cast to play a Latin American,
all one needs to do is say words like "djoo" and "leesen" for "you" and
"listen."  Add to that the crowning touch of always fidgeting with a
gold crucifix, and there you have it, aging Latin American drug lord..
James Woods manages to be a creepy ex-CIA guy very well.  That is his
bread and butter role.  He is given such ridiculous scenes, such as
having a breakdown yelling at a tape recorder, that one ponders why he
isn't simply committed by his friends for the safety of all.  Eric
Roberts plays a creepy character as well.  He is remarkably good at it.
So good that it is, well, creepy.</P>
<P>     The title refers to Sly Stallone's character being an explosives
expert.  This is the biggest fumble of the film.  He has a talent for
"focused explosions."  Somehow he can set off a big wad of plastic
explosive in a busy night club and kill only the one person in a room
that he targets.  He hangs around to watch his success. (1) How does the
bomb know not to send debris into innocent people? (2) If he's going to
hang around, why not just shoot the one guy with a sniper rifle? How he
manages to set up some of the more elaborate "controlled" explosions is
never made clear.  A major plot point involving an explosion victim is
also never explained, leaving one of the biggest plot holes in recent
film memory.  It does provide James Woods with one stray truly funny
scene.</P>
<P>     The stars' clothed and unclothed bodies (Rod Steiger excepted)
provide something pleasant to look at, and Miami provides some nice
scenery.  If you demand more than this from a film, then THE
SPECIALIST is not for you.  It is at times so overdetermined an example
of macho film making that it might qualify as a guilty pleasure, but a
very guilty one indeed.</P>
