<P>     While it is commonly assumed, and is often true, that the motion 
picture industry mirrors real life, there are instances when Hollywood 
has had a marked influence on society.  No more is this more apparent 
than in the case of homosexuality.  The thesis of Rob Epstein and 
Jeffrey Friedman's film, THE CELLULOID CLOSET, can be summarized by a 
line from the production:  "Hollywood, that great maker of myths, taught 
straight people what to think about gay people, and gay people what to 
think about themselves."  Unfortunately, most of those lessons have been 
negative.</P>
<P>     THE CELLULOID CLOSET presents a fairly comprehensive overview of 
how the gay/lesbian community has been portrayed in American films.  
Clips from dozens of motion pictures are included -- everything from 
1912's ALGIE, THE MINER to 1993's PHILADELPHIA.  In between, there are 
such well-known titles as MOROCCO (1930), THE GAY DIVORCEE (1933), 
REBECCA (1940), THE MALTESE FALCOLN (1941), ROPE (1948), GENTLEMEN 
PREFER BLONDES (1953), REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (1955), BEN-HUR (1959), 
SPARTACUS (1960), ADVISE AND CONSENT (1962), CABARET (1972), THE COLOR 
PURPLE (1985), TORCH SONG TRILOGY (1988), THELMA AND LOUISE (1991), and 
FRIED GREEN TOMATOES (1991).  Well-known gay and straight personalities 
are on hand to offer opinions and observations.  These include Tom 
Hanks, Whoopi Goldberg, Susan Sarandon, Tony Curtis, and Harvey 
Fierstein.</P>
<P>     In the silent era, gay characters were used for comic relief.  With 
exaggeratedly effeminate gestures, these thinly-drawn caricatures were 
foils for numerous silent stars, including Charlie Chaplin, who kissed a 
cross-dresser in BEHIND THE SCREEN.  With the arrival of the talkies, 
"the sissy", Hollywood's first stock gay character, arrived.  This 
cliched image of the gay man could be found in such films as THE GAY 
DIVORCEE and CALL HER SAVAGE.</P>
<P>     In the 1930s, Hollywood decided to begin censoring its own films.  
The result was the infamous, and largely ineffective, Hays Code.  While 
the Code didn't eliminate the presence of gay characters in films, they 
became less obvious.  It was also during this time that homosexuals 
started to appear as villains.  During the 1950s, with "masculinity" on 
the upswing, the vitriol against being gay grew more pronounced.  It's 
ironic that one of the biggest stars of the era was Rock Hudson, a gay 
man impersonating a straight man.</P>
<P>     It wasn't until the late '60s when a few films appeared that dealt 
intelligently and sympathetically with homosexuality.  For most of the 
decade, characters of "questionable sexuality" were depressed, unhappy, 
and suicidal -- worthy only of pity and fear.  Few survived the final 
reel.  However, with the 1968 British film, THE DETECTIVE, and 1970's 
THE BOYS IN THE BAND, a slow change was initiated.  The attitude shift 
took a long time to grow roots, however, as the '70s and '80s saw many 
more films with gays as victimizers than as genuine characters.  It was 
only with the advent of the '90s and movies like PHILADELPHIA, THE 
WEDDING BANQUET, GO FISH, and JEFFREY that the homosexual community 
finally had something of quality to celebrate.</P>
<P>     THE CELLULOID CLOSET is one of the most fascinating documentaries 
to put Hollywood under the microscope, standing alongside the THAT'S 
ENTERTAINMENT series and VISIONS OF LIGHT.  In about one-hundred 
minutes, this film convincingly defends its thesis.  Along the way, it 
uncovers some fascinating behind-the-scenes tidbits that few in the 
audience will be aware of (like the motivation for scenes between Masala 
and Ben-Hur in BEN HUR).  THE CELLULOID CLOSET is top-notch 
entertainment, not only because it's enjoyable, but because it argues 
its case with an effectiveness that would impress even a top-notch, 
homophobic attorney.  Now, as more and more men and women emerge from 
the closet, it appears that Hollywood may be taking steps in that 
direction, as well.</P>
