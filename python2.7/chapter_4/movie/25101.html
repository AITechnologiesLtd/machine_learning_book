<P>     When your comic inventiveness runs to a guy crapping on his 
neighbor's lawn or commandeering a suck at the breast of a nursing 
mother, you'd better have a helluva comic actor to bail you out.  This 
must have been the game plan of the Farrelly Brothers, looking to ride 
the wave of their gross-out blockbuster There's Something About Mary.  
They hired Jim Carrey, filmdom's highest-priced comedian, and gave him a 
script that could have been written during recess at junior high.  The 
guy does his best, but it's like bailing with a sieve.</P>
<P>     Carrey leaps, he crawls, he slithers, he rubber-faces, he crashes 
through windows and tumbles down embankments, he even drops his pants 
for that revenge squat (not the only time he'll lower his trousers in a 
search for laughs), but it's no use; Carrey is funny, but he's not that 
funny.</P>
<P>     He plays Charlie, a mild-mannered Rhode Island highway patrolman.  
His troubles start when he's humiliated on his wedding day by the 
African-American Mensa-president dwarf who chauffeurs the limo.  When in 
the fullness of time his wife produces black triplets, Charlie willingly 
suspends disbelief.  He raises them on Richard Pryor videos, and grown 
up, they become huge louts (Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee, and Jerod 
Mixon) who use "motherfucker" as everything from article to adverb, but 
are actually smart.  When Charlie's wife runs off with the dwarf, he 
sublimates his feelings.  And develops Advanced Delusionary 
Schizophrenia with Involuntary Narcissistic Rage.  In other words, a 
split personality.  His alter ego is Hank, a mean, crude bastard with a 
Dirty Harry swagger who dishes out revenge.  Charlie has medicine to 
keep him bottled up, but when he forgets it, his evil genius bursts 
loose.</P>
<P>     There's a plot.  Irene P. Waters (get it?), played as wallpaper by 
a resigned Renee Zellweger, is a greenskeeper who may know something 
about a nefarious scheme that involves a rich guy and a golf course and 
most of the New York State Police.  It's important enough to have almost 
everyone in the movie except Carrey trying to kill her, but not 
important enough to tell us what it is.  Charlie's supposed to escort 
Irene back to New York and turn her over to the authorities, but when 
the attempts on her life start, he and Hank spring to the rescue, and 
both fall in love with her.</P>
<P>     By the end of this mess I was trying to find places to laugh out of 
sympathy for Carrey, who really tries.  He does some nice 
two-characters-fighting-for-control-of-the-same-body schtick, but Steve 
Martin did it better in All of Me.  He works hard for his $20 million, 
but that sieve just won't hold water.</P>
