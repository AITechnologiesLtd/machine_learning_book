<P>    First off, let me state categorically, that I was never a fan of the
original TV series "Lost in Space" or it's Disney source "Swiss Family
Robinson". That being said, let me sum up this review in as few words as
possible... Tedious, Meandering, and worse of all, Boring.
    We are introduced to the plot with a spectacularly dizzying space
battle between Earth's forces defending their under-construction space
warp portal, from an unknown group of terrorists. Matt LaBlanc as Major
Don West commands one of the fighter ships and easily destroys the
attackers and rescues his best friend without so much as building a
sweat. The reasoning for this Space Warp Portal is for the eventual
evacuation of planet Earth for the greener pastures of another planet in
a far distant galaxy. It seems that Earth is on the verge of
environmental collapse and it's up to renowned scientist John Robinson
to journey to the distant planet to establish the construction of a
second Portal. This is explained in such a way that it sets up the drama
but also leaves a tremendous plot hole. John Robinson has decided to
take his entire family with him on this excursion to a distant world.
But on a ship as large as the Jupiter 2 you would expect a full crew of
technicians and mechanics and laborers to help facilitate this enormous
project. But no, only the Robinson family and their new pilot Don West
are set to be on board.
    Dr. Zachary Smith is in the employ of the terrorists intent on
destroying the space portal (for what purpose is never explained).
Having botched an earlier attempt, Smith is plied into sabotaging the
Jupiter 2's Robot, re-programming it to destroy the Jupiter 2 and kill
the Robinson family. Dr. Smith boards the ship without so much as a beep
from any security system (which is highly unlikely considering the
war-like atmosphere surrounding the project), and succeeds in doing his
dirty work. And just to make maters worse, his employer then calls him
on his holographic cell phone and zaps him into unconsciousness.
    Now of course the ship takes off in a blaze of pyrotechnics and CGI
effects. The Robot dutifully emerges from it's storage compartment
ominously repeating "Destroy the Robinson's.. Destroy.. Destroy". The
Robinson's having enclosed themselves in hyperbolic chambers for the 10
year journey to their new planet, are unaware that the Robot is
destroying their navigational system. Just in time, our hero's wake up
and stop the Robot before it can cause enough damage as to endanger the
franchise.
    I'm not going to give out anymore of the plot, as from here on the
film becomes very episodic. It is paced like a miniseries, with one
cliff-hanger coming every 15 minutes. The problem is, these cliffhangers
are not suspenseful. Scenes of attacking metallic spiders are almost
comical. One interesting bit of short sightedness on the part of the
production is that a reference is made that these spider creatures
devour their dead. But we never see this. So where this choice piece of
information comes from is anybody's guess. But it does make for a nice
solution towards the end of the film. And the introduction of a Computer
generated monkey like creature is used solely for the purpose of
marketing. You can see the plush toys lining the selves, as kids across
the country line up to own their very own Blaap (that's what it's
called, don't ask me why). This annoyingly cute beastie pops up when you
least expect it and for no purpose other that to remind the audience
that it's there!
    The film is loaded with every conceivable clichi. It's familial
drama revolves around John Robinson's emotional detachment from his son,
Will. Now of course, Will is a technical genius, (Cannon Films Alert!)
having build his own Time Machine for a school science project, which
for some inexplicable reason comes into play later on in the plot. After
the destruction of the Robot, it takes Will Robinson only a few hours to
re-build and re-program the machine into a familiar and friendlier
companion. Don West is portrayed as an over sexed pre-teen. The dialogue
the Matt LaBlanc utters in his attempt to woo Judy Robinson (played by
Heather Graham - the Rollergirl from 'Boogie Nights') is utterly
childish and unlikable. It's almost like a ten year old impersonating
Andrew Dice Clay without the vulgarity. If not for his skills as a
pilot, Major Don West would be a strong candidate for Euthanasia.
    Dr. Zachary Smith is locked in his room for the majority of the
film. His character is only brought out when something needs to happen
to move the story forward. When he is first locked in his quarters, he
smashes everything in his room, for what purpose, we are never told. The
women in the film are giving even less to do as the story progresses,
becoming by the end of the film nothing more that furniture. While the
men are outside of the ship trying to discover an answer to their
situation, the women sit back in the spaceship and wait, occasionally
looking out through a window. Maureen Robinson, (played by Mimi Rogers)
wife to Professor John Robinson is given so little to do, you wonder
what the character was included for in the first place. She has neither
the warmth nor, seemingly the caring of June Lockhart's character in the
original series. Heather Graham, is as well given nothing to do other
that to make faces at Matt LaBlanc, in a vain attempt to create sexual
tension. I'm sorry to say, but maybe if she had roller skates on..
    Gary Oldman is completely wasted in what has become the most enjoyed
character in camp celebrity. Oldman's portrayal of  Dr. Smith is neither
effeminate or masculine. The character is neutered from the start. And
having him off screen for more than half of the film is painfully
evident, as the picture only really tends to come to life when Oldman is
on screen. When Goldman becomes fused with the mechanical spiders later
in the plot (which strains credibility on more than one front) his
performance is limited to only voice work as physically he is replaced
by a not very effective special effect. But credit must be given to
Director Hopkins, he has done the one thing no other director has been
able to do.. get a bad, and subdued performance from Gary Oldman. Think
about it. Oldman may have given poor performances before. But they were
always memorable ('Leon' comes to mind, as does 'Bram Stoker's
Dracula'), but he's never been boring. Until now that is.
    William Hurt gives a sleep inducing performance that would have been
more convincing had he called it in. While there are moments where Hurt
seems to be getting into the camp spirit of the piece, the film
resolutely refuses to cater to that. Therefore, Hurt's performance is
not given the spotlight the character demands. As for the child actors
in the film, the less said the better. While  Lacey Chabert (Penny
Robinson) and Jack Johnson (Will Robinson) are attractive and
personable, again the script short shifts them with superfluous teen
angst.
    Director Hopkins handles the film well enough. But the film seems
overly long and disjointed. This is a case of poor editing as the tempo
of the film changes constantly in mid-scene. The spider attack sequence
is a case in point. While there is some degree of suspense built up to
the spider's appearance, it is drained of that energy by the
introduction of the aforementioned Blaap creature. And having Will
Robinson take control of the Robot and use it like a video game
controller to blast the spiders points up a fundamental problem. How can
a child handle a problem that an adult cannot. If a 11 year old kid can
beat these critters like he was playing a video game, where is the
danger?! Hopkins is a director who has shown considerable ability. His
earlier films "A Nightmare on Elm Street 5", the underrated "Blown Away"
and "The Ghost and the Darkness" proves he is a director capable of
handling actors and effects with a sure and steady hand. But here, it's
only fair to say that he is overwhelmed.
    The biggest question I have about the film is the credit of
Animatronic Creatures by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. What animatronics
were there? If there were any, other than a limb of a spider or the top
of Blaap's head, I didnt notice one live effect. So it that isn't the
case, I'm afraid we may still be subjected to a Director's cut of this
film later on which may include a full grown Blaap. The mind shudders.
    This film has proven to me, beyond a shadow of a doubt that Avika
Goldsman's script for "A Time To Kill" was a fluke! I'm sorry to say,
but Mr. Goldsman is rapidly becoming as inept a writer as Joe Esterhaus
has ever been. The entire structure of the plot is so convoluted and
meandering as to be mind numbing. Scenes are set up without any
resolution or explanation (Dr. Smith's breaking of everything in his
room), and Character development is ignored until it is required by the
plot, which at times contradicts the character.  I never thought that I
would see a film as poorly written as "BATMAN & ROBIN" again in my
lifetime. I guess it pays to be cynical.
    All in all "Lost in Space" has only one thing going for it. And
that's is it's visual effects which are the only reason to see the film.
But at 2 hour and 10 minutes. There aren't enough effects to keep ones
attention diverted away from how poor this film really is. As much as I
disliked the original TV series.. I would definitely recommend those old
shows to this overblown tripe.</P>
<P>On a scale of ***** "Lost in Space" rates *=
This may not be the worst film of the year. But it's definitely in the
running.
