<P>   Did you ever experience a devastating experience--your
dog gets hit by a car, your lover leaves you, your
grandmother is seriously ill, your plane is descending at ten
times the normal speed, your spouse catches you in flagrante
delicto--and you pray: "God...if you can make everything well
again, I will a) always believe in you; b) never ever leave that
individual's side again; c) leave that person and stop sinning
with him?" Sure you have.  Many of us have entertained
doubts about spiritual matters, particularly about the
existence of a divine being, but to coin a mixed metaphor,
when the chips are down, there are no atheists in foxholes. 
If you experience a crisis more powerful than any you'd
known, you are likely to make the most heart-wrenching
promises to the Almighty if He will make everything right--or,
as the song goes, "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far
away."</P>
<P>   "The End of the Affair," Canadian novelist Graham
Greene's most autobiographical novel in that it was inspired
by the writer's adulterous affair with the American Catherine
Walston, has been given a second screen adaptation. 
Written in the 1950's, "The End of the Affair" received
cinematic life in 1955 by Edward Dmytryk, featuring Van
Johnson as the Greene stand-in Maurice Bendrix and
Deborah Kerr as Bendrix's neighbor, Sarah Miles.  Filmed
with the slow pace and patient style of the fifties, the movie
was well received despite the feeling of some critics that
Johnson and Kerr were mismatched.  </P>
<P>   Though the theme of adulterous liaisons with the
jealousies, hatreds, and guilt feelings that ensue are universal
themes, the current offering by Neil Jordan ("The Butcher
Boy," "The Crying Game") comes across as too literary, too
uncinematic, too darn old-fashioned for a contemporary
audience.  Nor can we quite understand the attraction that
Maurice Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes) has for the bored Sarah
Miles (Julianne Moore) since Bendrix is, after all, not greatly
different from Miles's colorless husband, Henry (Stephen
Rea).  While we can imagine the effeminate Ralph Fiennes in
the role of a man whose principal claim to exertion is a
workout on a smudgy-ribboned typewriter, we simply cannot
see how Sarah could replace the antipathy she feels for her
rising, career-civil- servant-husband with a passion for this
delicate author.</P>
<P>   Further marring the film, the elegant lyricism of the book--
which comes across, now and then in the film's dialogue and
Bendrix's narrative--would serve us better on the printed
page.  On the large screen, the images that the words
convey, best left to the imagination, are ploddingly displayed
for the audience.</P>
<P>   As Bendrix clacks away on the machine in his study, he
tells us that he is a man full of jealousy and hatred, passions
which only once come across toward the conclusion of the
story but which appear to be so repressed in this man that
such sentiments are difficult to believe.  Through a number of
flashbacks, Neil Jordan first shows us a meeting that Bendrix
has in the ever-present English rain with his friend Henry
Miles in 1946.  Miles is depressed, lost in thought, wandering
about the streets lost in thought.  For several years he has
surmised that he was emotionally losing his wife, Sarah, a
woman he feels he cannot live without.  When Jordan takes
us back to 1939, we observe the meeting of Sarah and
Maurice Bendrix at a party which Sarah's husband Henry is
giving.  The two fall immediately in love and begin an
adulterous affair.  During a raid by the Germans, Bendrix's
house is hit by a bomb, knocking the writer down the stairs
where he appears to be dead.  Though Sarah and Maurice
had promised each other that their love would last forever,
Sarah inexplicably ends the affair on that day, leaving
Bendrix hopelessly baffled, enraged, and jealous of the man
who he believes has stolen her affections from him.  </P>
<P>   "The End of the Affair" is a film that takes itself so seriously
that the few comic interludes are much appreciated.  The
light parts, such as they are, are supplied by a Mr. Parkis
(Ian Hart), a private detective hired by Bendrix to follow
Sarah everywhere to determine the source of her alleged new
infatuation.  But the chief rewards of this flawed film are
religio-mystic theme--wonderfully underplayed given the
hysteria that we've come to expect from the likes of
"Stigmata," "Dogma" and "End of Days"--and the literate-
philosophic dialogue produced by the novelist.  "Do I exist for
you when you are with him?" Bendrix wonders in what is
almost a takeoff of the usual metaphysical query, "If a tree
falls and no one witnesses the sound, did it indeed fall?"  For
her part Sarah contributes "People go on loving all their lives
without seeing each other," while Bendrix, disagreeing,
debates the point.  Bendrix draws inappropriate laughter from
the audience when, in adjusting Sarah's hosiery after a bout
of lovemaking he remarks, "I'm jealous of your stockings
because they kiss your whole leg...I'm jealous of your shoes
because they take you away from me."  Later on he
continues the jealous lover bit by exclaiming, "We only made
love: but you shop and cook and fall asleep with him."</P>
<P>   This is heady stuff: a combination of Philosophy 101 with a
basic course in Comedy Corner Improvs.  "Happiness is
harder to write about than goodness," complains the novelist
at one point, to which we say, "Sometimes, writing is harder
to put on the screen than in a book."</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 100 minutes.  (C) 1999
