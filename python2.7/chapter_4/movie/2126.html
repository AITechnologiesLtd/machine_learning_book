<PRE>                             THE REAL MCCOY
                       A film review by Jon Webb
                        Copyright 1993 Jon Webb</PRE>
<P>     I decided Kim Basinger must be taken more seriously as an actress
if she's smart enough to turn down BOXING HELENA, at the risk of her
personal fortune, so I went to see THE REAL MCCOY.  I hoped it would
be a ripoff of POINT OF NO RETURN.</P>
<P>     But it is not.  The problem is that it is not an action film, and
only vaguely a conventional film about a female cat burglar bank
robber.  Instead, the story revolves around Basinger's relationship
with her son -- it seems even famous bank robbers have sons, if they
are women.</P>
<P>     Sigh.  How I wish Hollywood would get out of this mold of having to
mix a little of conventional women's roles into every film they make
with a woman star.  POINT OF NO RETURN would have been better if
Bridget Fonda hadn't felt the draw of conventional relationships quite
so strongly (why couldn't she end up sophisticated and happy like James
Bond?), and this movie would have been better if the role Basinger's
son would play hadn't been so obvious. (Hint: She gets out of jail, and
wants to go straight.  Some bad guys want her to rob another bank.  She
loves her son.  So what do the bad guys do?)</P>
<P>     I thought the role for Basinger was actually pretty good,
though.  She gets to play a more three-dimensional character than she
has in any other recent film.  She reminds you of why she has become
famous; she really can act, though between this film and BOXING
HELENA, she's not getting offered roles that will take her any place.</P>
