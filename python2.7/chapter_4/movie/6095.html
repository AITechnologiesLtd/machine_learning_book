<PRE>                                 BIG NIGHT
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     One reality in this world is certain:  nice guys finish last.  And
while the case can be made that Primo and Secondo aren't the nicest guys
around, it's pretty clear from the beginning of BIG NIGHT that they are
doomed to be taken advantage of.</P>
<P>     This little gem, a darling of the festival circuit and cause for a
huge rebirth in star, co-writer, co-producer, and co-director Stanley
Tucci's career, tells the beautiful and touching story of two brothers
(Tucci as Secondo, and "Wings" cab driver Tony Shalhoub as Primo) trying
to make it as restaurateurs, straight off the boat from Italy.</P>
<P>     Primo, the head chef, refuses to compromise on the tiniest detail
regarding the food, while Secondo does battle on the business end.  The
meals they serve are second to none, but all the customers go down the
street to their rival's (an Italian Ian Holm) thanks to his singing
waiters.  With the bank ready to foreclose, Primo and Secondo try to
turn things around, and they put all they've got into one last feast in
honor of jazz great Louis Prima, who may or may not actually be showing
up.  A big night indeed.</P>
<P>     Intertwining the restaurant drama with the brothers' unsatisfying
personal lives, Tucci and co-writer Joseph Tropiano tell a beautiful and
touching story that resonates with a authenticity rarely found in
today's films.  Tucci, Shalhoub, and Holm are all excellent, as are
Isabella Rossellini and CIRCLE OF FRIENDS's Minnie Driver as Secondo's
love interests.  Tucci and co-director Campbell Scott (co-star of
SINGLES) also do excellent work considering their amateur status.</P>
<P>     While the film can get a bit talky at times (beware of the scenes
with subtitles), it's overall a very moving and delightful first work
for these guys.  Deserving special notice are the exquisite
cooking/dining scenes, which do for Italian food what EAT DRINK MAN
WOMAN did for Chinese.  All-in-all, it's a warm, funny, and at the same
time heartbreaking look at one big night in the company of some truly
interesting people.</P>
