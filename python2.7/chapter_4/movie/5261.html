<PRE>                       ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1991)</PRE>
<P>        ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES--you have to wonder if the critics
and the public saw the same movie.  The critics generally regarded the film
as a dreary waste of two hours, while the movie-going public found the
classic Robin Hood legend irresistible.  Who was right?  If you ask me, the
truth lies somewhere in between.</P>
<P>        Without question, the film falls victim to numerous plagues, the
most lethal of which is an unusually shaky performance by Kevin Costner,
who is tragically miscast in the title role.  Additionally, the movie
suffers from a wildly inconsistent tone, which is somber one minute and
airy the next.</P>
<P>        But somehow, warts and all, the film manages to offer a rollicking
good time.  PRINCE OF THIEVES is an undeniably entertaining crowd-pleaser,
thanks to rousing action scenes and robust performances from Morgan Freeman
and Alan Rickman.  Be careful not to confuse the movie with the inept 20th
Century Fox version starring Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman, which truly is
an appalling waste of time.</P>
