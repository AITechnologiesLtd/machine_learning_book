<PRE>                                 DAYLIGHT
                       A film review by Steve Kong
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Well, I know that Stallone is 50 years old now, but in Daylight he doesn't 
look it!  Daylight is a great disaster movie.  If you've seen Cliffhanger, 
you'll know Stallone's character already.  A guy with a bad past, but is in 
the right place at the wrong time.  A tunnel connecting New York and New 
Jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck 
carrying *very* flammable toxic waste.  A dozen or so people survive the 
collapses and the incinerating fireball (and what a fire ball it was!)  
Stallone, a former Emergency Medical Service man, is chauffeuring a rich 
couple around, when they reach the outside of the tunnel, before the 
explosion.  Then, 30 minutes into the movie, BOOM!</P>
<P>>From here on, the plot takes a back seat, and we are treated to some of the 
best camera work and action staged.  Most all the action is plausible and will 
hold you at the edge of your seat.  There are a few melodramatic parts here, 
but, they tend to work out well.  There is no general antagonist in this film, 
but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that.</P>
<P>Daylight is a great film, I saw a non-matinee showing of it, and I thought it 
was worth every penny.  The characterizations are mostly flat, one dimesional, 
but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters.   
Rob Cohen (Dragonheart) does a great job with this film.</P>
