MOULIN ROUGE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>MOULIN ROUGE is the most audacious effort yet from director Baz 
Luhrmann, who last, in ROMEO + JULIET, imagined two Shakespearean lovers 
in a modern Verona Beach setting.  This time, Luhrmann turns his 
considerable talent to bringing back the movie musical, an art form 
whose obituary had supposedly long since been written.</P>
<P>Starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, as Satine and Christian, two 
star-crossed lovers, this fairytale of a movie is a cornucopia of 
singing and dancing.  In fact there are probably enough songs in it for 
three musicals.  McGregor's big role of late was as Obi-Wan Kenobi in 
THE PHANTOM MENACE and Kidman's was in EYES WIDE SHUT.  She is, however, 
perhaps best known these days for her well publicized contract dispute 
with a guy who has impossible missions.</P>
<P>The movie's phenomenal sets look like a Tim Burton production of WILLIE 
WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.  Among many imaginative and magical 
scenes, one has Satine and Christian standing on a cloud between the 
starry, deep blue sky and the twinkling apartment lights of Paris in 
1899 -- "the summer of love."</P>
<P>The film opens with such a long cacophony and montage of blurring images 
that it seems that the picture might be one of those near storyless 
movies like PINK FLOYD THE WALL.  This all changes when McGregor and 
Kidman begin to sing, "The Hills Are Alive With The Sound Of Music" in 
his case and "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" in hers.  To answer 
your first question: Yes, they sing all of their own songs.  And to 
answer your second: Yes, they are quite good, especially McGregor.  Best 
of all are their love duets, and their chemistry together is both 
credible and touching.</P>
<P>The story, which is filled with humor as well as love, concerns a 
fantastical nightclub called the Moulin Rouge, which is run by an 
impresario named Zidler (Jim Broadbent from TOPSY-TURVY).  He transforms 
his nightclub into a theater in order to put on a play called 
"Spectacular Spectacular," written by Christian.  The leading role will 
be sung by Satine, a courtesan.  </P>
<P>In order to get the funding Zidler gives the deed to the Moulin Rouge, 
and effectively to Satine as well, to the evil Duke of Monroth (Richard 
Roxburgh).  This deal might have worked out, had Christian and Satine 
not fallen in love.  A hopeless romantic, Christian's fundamental 
believe is, "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and to 
be loved in return."  The tragedy of the story comes from Satine's 
health -- she's dying of consumption -- and Christian's 
self-acknowledged "ridiculous obsession with love."</P>
<P>Operatic in scope, the film assaults our senses with the sumptuous 
music, costumes, sets and story.  With its rapid pacing, jump cuts, 
speed ups and slow downs, the film will leave you emotionally drained 
and exhilarated by the end, which does more with the "show must go on" 
than you could ever imagine.  It is also a rare film that is such a 
crowd-pleaser that you're likely to hear, as we did, spontaneous 
applause during the movie.</P>
<P>MOULIN ROUGE runs 2:10.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual content and would 
be acceptable for kids around 12 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave the film ***.  He had trouble with the 
intensity of the dying part but liked the music and the dancing.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, June 1, 2001.  
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the AMC and the Century 
theaters.</P>
