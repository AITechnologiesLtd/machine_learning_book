                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>DON QUIJOTE DE ORSON WELLES (DON QUIXOTE OF ORSON WELLES)
Produced, written, directed by Orson Welles
Cast: Francisco Perez, Akim Tamiroff, Orson Welles, 
Editor and head of post production: Jess Franco
Mexico/Italy/ Spain 1955-1969, Post Production Spain 1992</P>
<P>     When Orson Welles died almost ten years ago he left several nearly
finished but unreleased films.  Most Famous of these is THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE WIND, tied up in a legal dispute with Iranian financiers.  Other
projects included the fragments of IT'S ALL TRUE, his aborted
documentary on Brazil; and a film called THE DEEP, apparently similar
to the recent DEAD CALM.  Most legendary and speculatively exiting of
the projects is DON QUIXOTE.  Over the years this unseen project has
gained a reputation as one of his best films, because the match of
Welles and the character of Cervantes' novel seemed perfect.  Welles
used his own money, completely, and between 1955 and 1969 filmed enough
footage to make at least three films, changing his concept constantly.
If any of these films would have been a masterpiece, it is impossible
to say.  The project currently being screened by his former long time
companion Oja Kaddar, who has the rights to his unfinished projects, is
an insult to the memory of a sometimes brilliant director.</P>
<P>     Technical considerations make this film close to unwatchable.  A
film consists of nothing more than a visual or image track, and a sound
track.  The visual track of this film is incredibly poor.  It seems as
if, and this is a guess, an early rough cut of  film was transferred to
primitive home video some time in the sixties.  This poorly focused and
washed out video then was retransferred to film.  The result is
something not as good as the "Lost Episodes" of the Honeymooners TV
show.  Cut into this are a few better quality close-ups.  An occasional
original quality shot sneaks in, reminding one of the great visual
quality of other Welles films.  This poor footage makes up most of the
film.  About three quarters of the way through, there is a very good
twenty minutes of high quality footage of the running of the bulls in
Spain.  Welles appears in this, making a film called DON QUIXOTE.
Henry Fonda can also be seen briefly.  The film the returns to poor
quality images as the editors struggle to make an ending out of the
available footage.  The running of the bulls section seems to be edited
by Welles, or at least a professional.  The rest, the mixture of poor
quality footage, lacks any sense of pacing or focus.  The cut in close
ups are obviously left over scraps used to stretch out the scenes to
accommodate the narration.</P>
<P>     The audio track of the film is even worse.  Bad sound plagued
Welles later works.  Why a film maker who got his start in radio and
made sound innovations on his early Hollywood films used such poor
sound technique in later life is a subject of speculation among film
scholars.  Many film makers shooting in Spain and Italy in the sixties
did not use direct sound, since the films would be dubbed for different
markets.  As a result, Welles shot most of this film silent, hoping to
use his own voice for the English language version.  He recorded about
ten minutes.  The rest of the sound was created in post production.  It
is an incredibly poor dubbing job that would not pass muster in a
kung-fu film.  The head of modern post production was Jess Franco.  His
own films include the women's prison film 99 WOMEN and horror opus
NIGHT OF THE BLOOD MONSTER.  His team added a flat and hollow track
of bored actors trudging through the dialogue, making no effort to
match the lips of characters.  It is difficult to tell if some lines
are supposed to be narration or dialogue.  This is accompanied by stock
sound effects and almost no music.  It is like watching the 'Here's
Harold' television versions of Harold Lloyd shorts.</P>
<P>     The climactic scene of the film, jousting the windmills, is
created by matting a long shot of the actors on their burros over
stills, similar to some of the "restoration" Georgio Moroder did on
METROPOLIS.</P>
<P>     I doubt that this version will get any distribution in the US.
For Welles fans I will recount the basic storyline.  The story of the
film, as it is in this version, has Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in
armor wandering through the landscape until all of a sudden they
encounter a woman, (Oja Kaddar) on a motorcycle.  It is Franco-era
Spain.  They encounter several modern people, mistake sheep for an
army, joust windmills, etc.  Don Quixote and Sancho Panza then split
up.  Sancho Panza hears that Orson Welles is making a film about Don
Quixote.  Panza wanders through the running of the bulls looking for
Orson Welles, who might know where Don Quixote is, or have a use for
him in his film.  After encountering Welles, Sancho Panza finds Don
Quixote.  People recognize him Don Quixote as the guy from the book.
He passes a Don Quixote restaurant and a Don Quixote Beer sign.  They
wander off again into the distance.</P>
<P>     If the images can be digitally cleaned up, and the sound recorded
by true professionals, with a solid score and convincing sound effects,
this film would make an interesting footnote to Welles career.  As it
is, this version should be avoided by all but serious film scholars
that need to see what Welles possibly had in mind.  Compared to the
brilliant OTHELLO; recently cleaned up and restored; DON QUIJOTE DE
ORSON WELLES looks like PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE.</P>
