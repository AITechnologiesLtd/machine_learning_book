<PRE>"Hearts in Atlantis" – Innocence Lost, Adulthood Found
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>"Hearts in Atlantis," set in a sleepy neighborhood in
the carefree era of the early 60s, follows in the vein
of other Stephen King tales about nostalgia and
innocence lost (most notably "Stand by Me" and "The
Green Mile").  It is a purposefully paced story that
focuses on the uneasy transition from boyhood to
adulthood.  It reminds us of the gentle awakenings to
the often-sinuous world that lie waiting for us when
we finally grow up.  It sympathizes the inevitable
fact that growing up frequently leaves us more
disillusioned and less hopeful.</P>
<P>Adults and children view the world in very different
ways.  For the grown-up, what they see is panoramic in
scope.  They see much of what is good like the
innocence of children, the beauty of books, and
rejoice in the ever-lasting effect of that first kiss
by which all others will be judged.  </P>
<P>However, with the wisdom that they have acquired over
a lifetime of experiences, they also see what is bad. 
They recognize the presence of things that are
ominous.  Such is the case of the mysterious Ted
Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins), a transient fellow who
shows up one day at the home of young 11-year old
Bobby (Anton Yelchin).  He has come to rent out the
extra room upstairs.</P>
<P>His mom (Hope Davis) is unsettled by his appearance. 
"I never trust a man who carries his possessions in
grocery bags," she says.  But that doesn't matter to
Bobby.  For children, what they see is more selective.
 It's as if they are looking into a mirror, gazing
upon a reflection, and seeing only what they want to
see.  </P>
<P>Currently, Bobby's world centers on his best friends,
Sully (Will Rothhaar) and Carol (Mika Boorem), and a
lazy summer that never seems to end.  It consists of
reading books on a giant tree branch that rests over a
babbling brook, the hope that a new bicycle awaits
him, and a glorious night at the local fair.</P>
<P>This is the last summer of Bobby's childhood. 
Partially, it's because he's 11 going on 12. 
Partially, it's due to his emerging friendship with
Ted.  Bobby's Dad died seven years ago, and his mom is
too distracted with her job to invest the kind of love
that every 11-year old needs.  Meanwhile, Ted offers
cold root beer, will pay Bobby a dollar a week to read
him the newspaper, and asks him to keep an eye out for
"Low Men" who wear dark hats and drive
official-looking cars.  They are the bullies in his
life.</P>
<P>Bobby begins to slowly learn that it's time to stop
gazing into the mirror and to try to struggle with the
world's realities, even if it is more than any 11-year
old can hope to imagine.  Sully is more than just his
friend.  Carol is more than just the pretty girl next
door.  Mom does love him.  And the world is bigger
than the block on which you live, meaner than the
local bully, and more complex than your feelings after
your first kiss.  Alas, the mysteries of adolescence
may never be understood.  And, as Ted so eloquently
yet sadly remarks, "there are some moments of
happiness that you live in some place magical that
Atlantis must have been.  Then we grow up and our
hearts break into two."</P>
