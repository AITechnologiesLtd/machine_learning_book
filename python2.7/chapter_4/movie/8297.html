<P>     Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence are certainly the oddest couple to
come down the pike in a while.  Mr. Susan Sarandon plays Nick Beam, a
Southern California ad executive whose car is jacked by an unemployed
electronics expert (Lawrence).  The catch?  Nick has just discovered his
wife in bed with the boss.  "Boy, did you pick the wrong guy on the
wrong day." Click go the door locks, squeal go the tires, and you can
take it from there.  Yes, they become reluctant best buds.  Yes, they
become partners in crime.  Yes, these and other ridiculous plot points
are cheerfully telegraphed in advance by writer/director Steve Oedekerk
(THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, ACE VENTURA 2: WHEN NATURE CALLS).  Though the
shaggy dog story grows increasingly (and distressingly) warm and fuzzy,
Robbins and Lawrence have a remarkably playful chemistry.  In fact,
they're almost *too* playful.  During several exchanges, the actors
appear barely able to maintain straight faces.  With John C.  McGinley,
Giancarlo Esposito, Kelly Preston, Michael McKean, and, whap!, Irma P.
