<PRE>Enemy Of The State
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Will Smith; Gene Hackman; Jon Voight & Lisa Bonet</P>
<P>If nothing else, Enemy Of The State will do one thing. It leaves no doubt
that Will Smith is officially a movie star. While Smith has been in other
hits like Independence Day and Men In Black, their success could be
attributed as much to their high-end special effects and not so much to
Smith's presence. Well, no more. While Enemy Of The State has great action
sequences and special effects, the main attraction here is Will Smith. He
does a great job in this film, and when you throw Gene Hackman and Jon
Voight into the mix, you can almost guarantee that you have a very
entertaining movie. Smith plays an attorney who becomes mixed up in
something that he wants no part of. A secret US Government agency thinks
that Smith's character has acquired some very sensitive information that
they don't want him to have. They are afraid that he may leak this
information to the press and ruin them. So the agency, led by a very nasty
Jon Voight, sets out do discredit him as a preemptive strike, in case he can
use this information before they can get it back from him. Along the way
Smith enlists the help of a former Government surveillance expert (Gene
Hackman) in order to get his life back.</P>
<P>Enemy Of the State is a top notch movie in every sense of the word. The
acting is terrific, the writing is intelligent, and visually it looks great.
Smith does a great job carrying the film, and he very easily proves that he
is capable of more than just comic relief in a movie. No surprises when it
comes to the performances of Gene Hackman and Jon Voight. These two men
leave little doubt why they are two of the most talented actors working
today. In a little bit of irony, Hackman's paranoid surveillance expert
could almost be the same character that he played back in the early
seventies in The Conversation. The irony being that The Conversation in one
of the worst films of all time and Enemy Of The State is one of the better
movies of the year.</P>
<P>The other thing that is worth mentioning is the fact that unlike many other
similar cloak and dagger type movies, Enemy Of The State doesn't suffer from
the inevitable confusing plot twists that usually plague this type of movie.
At no point will you find yourself scratching your head wondering what the
heck is going on. This is not to say that Enemy Of The State is without it's
intricate plot twists, quite the contrary. The writing is simply so slick
that a brain-damaged chimpanzee could follow along. Another interesting part
of this movie is the technology that the government uses to track and spy on
Will Smith's character. You can't help getting just a little uneasy when you
wonder just who much of this stuff is real, and how much of it is just
strictly a work of fiction. My money is on very little fiction.</P>
<P>Enemy Of The State should appeal to action fans and fans of the suspense
genre alike. Will Smith fans will not be disappointed either. While he isn't
cracking jokes in this movie, his charisma makes up for it. Enemy Of The
State is a very entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.</P>
<PRE>8/10</PRE>
