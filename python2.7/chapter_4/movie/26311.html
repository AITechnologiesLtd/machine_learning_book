<P>Revenge seems to be a popular motif in films nowadays. Last year, Ashley
Judd pulled in over $100 million for her woman out for revenge flick
entitled DOUBLE JEOPARDY. 1999 also showcased Steven Soderbergh's nod to
revenge in THE LIMEY starring Terrence Stamp, which was about a man lookin'
to kick ass in the name of vengeance. And Quentin Tarantino is also rumored
to be scripting his next picture about a woman out for revenge. So what's
everybody so pissed off about? Not sure but after seeing this movie, I
wouldn't want to be caught on the wrong side of Sly Stallone's cranky
mood...brrrrr...</P>
<P>PLOT:
A professional "financial adjuster" (aka mob enforcer) comes home after
hearing of his younger brother's death and questions the drinking and
driving story which apparently killed him. The man suspects foul play and
goes looking for payback. He kicks a lot of ass, asks a lot of questions and
then kicks a little more ass. He also gets to know his late brother's
daughter a little better.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Although not an action movie as portrayed in the hip trailer, this highly
stylized crime film worked for me despite its slow pace and somewhat
predictable story line, because of the sharp turn given by Sly Stallone, its
groovy tunes and its generally dark and gritty nature. I think that most
people who go in expecting a typical Stallone movie, or what the trailer
makes the film appear to be (an all-out brawl), will be disappointed. So try
to go in with an open mind and think about the film more in the realm of
last year's THE LIMEY, about a guy just looking out for his family...and
pissed! He goes from place to place, questions people, kicks a little ass
when he needs to, and moves on to the next clue. I enjoyed the movie on the
basis of style, soundtrack, the cool fight scenes and the 70s style car
chases. I also really liked the character that Stallone was playing, a bad
guy who despite his badness, wins our hearts because of the supposed good
that he's looking to do in honor of his brother's untimely death. Okay, so
he won my heart...he might not win yours! One definite problem that the film
does have, besides a mystery which to be honest, wasn't all that mysterious
in my eyes, is the supporting characters, who ultimately don't add up to
much. Miranda Richardson is given second billing but I have no idea why. She
is barely in the film. The same could be said for any of the other bit
characters, Mickey Rourke, Alan Cumming and John C. McGinley. Small roles
which don't really give you much insight.</P>
<P>Rachael Leigh Cook does get in the mix with Stallone a bit, and the
chemistry between the two was good, but the bottom line with this movie is
Stallone, Stallone, Stallone! If you dig the big lug, you will more than
likely enjoy this easy-paced dramatic turn for the puppy-eyed bastard!
(Bastard meant in a "good" way here, folks. No letters, please!). I was
personally very happy to see Sly up on the big screen again with some solid
acting on his part, palpable screen presence and plenty of cool one-liners
(And yes, despite most of the one-liners being good, some did fall flat).
This film is not for everyone, not sure if Jimmy Jack Corn will appreciate
the extreme darkness of the lead character, but if you're looking for a
tough, intense, gritty character...don't look any further than this dude,
Carter. He simply doesn't f**k around. Stay tuned for a particularly
effective scene of him and another guy in the woods...nuff said! So overall,
despite the film's predictability and underdeveloped side-characters, the
movie's got a lot of style, a great soundtrack, an awesome performance from
Stallone as the ultimate man on a mission and boy, does he look great in
those suits or what? Anyhoo...not a keeper but definitely one to check out
for all Stallone fans. Adriaaaaaaaaannnn!!!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Sylvester Stallone's middle name is Enzio. And yes, he has been MIA since
1997's COPLAND, a film which ironically landed him many an acting praise and
only $60,000 in salary. One of Stallone's earliest roles was as the "Subway
Tough Guy" in the 1971 Woody Allen comedy BANANAS. He did not have a line in
the movie. You may have also heard about his up and coming Formula One movie
which is scheduled to come out in 2001 entitled DRIVEN, but did you know
that other than starring in the film, Stallone also wrote the screenplay? Of
course, Stallone received an Oscar-nomination for writing 1976's ROCKY.
Stallone has an autistic son named Seargeo.
The man who wrote this film, David McKenna, also wrote one of the best
movies of 1998 entitled AMERICAN HISTORY X.
This is director Stephen T. Kay's second feature film, his first was 1997's
THE LAST TIME I COMMITTED SUICIDE starring Keanu Reeves. Sadly, he also had
something to do with the screenplay for last year's THE MOD SQUAD debacle.
He's known primarily as an actor with his many stints on TV shows such as
"General Hospital", "Party of Five", "Murder, She Wrote" and
"Thirtysomething".
This film is "based on" the 1971 film GET CARTER starring Michael Caine, and
not an exact remake. Caine played Jack Carter in the original and plays the
bar owner in this one. Both films are actually based on Ted Lewis' novel
entitled "Jack's Return Home".</P>
