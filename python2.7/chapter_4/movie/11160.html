<P>In the press kit for "Krippendorf's Tribe," director Todd Holland states 
"I was attracted to the sort of journey that this family goes through. 
It's a family story with a lot of heart. They lose the glue of their 
existence when the mother dies but then, through some quite ridiculous 
and desperate actions, they start to see each other again." Apparently 
Todd has been sniffing the glue of their existence. "Krippendorf's Tribe" 
is a loud, rowdy farce that's occassionally funny, but "a family story 
with a lot of heart?" Give me a break. 
The film begins as James Krippendorf (Richard Dreyfuss) looks at video 
footage of his late wife. He stares wistfully at the screen, drinking in 
the images of three happy kids cavorting with their parents, a mom and 
pop anthropology team, and members of a cheerful New Guinea tribe. Those 
days are gone. Deeply depressed following the death of his wife, 
Krippendorf has spent the last two years hanging around the house, living 
off a grant to study an "undiscovered" tribe in New Guinea. His alienated 
kids co-exist with him, glowering in varying degrees of hostility. Then, 
overbearing anthropologist Veronica Micelli ("Dharma and Greg's" Jenna 
Elfman) pops up to inform Krippendorf that he must deliver a lecture 
about the tribe that evening. A panicked Krippendorf bluffs his way 
through the lecture, answering questions about the non-existent 
Shelmikedmu tribe, (the name is cobbled together from Shelly, Mike, and 
Edmund, the names of his kids) while senior anthropologist Ruth Allen 
(Lily Tomlin) looks on with suspicion. The Shelmikedmu capture the 
imaginations of academia, and Krippendorf races off to create film 
footage of the tribe, using his family as bogus natives.
So where is our "family film with a lot of heart" at this point? 
Following the loss of their mother, the kids have lived in a trashy home 
for two years, watching their father lay on the couch, living off stolen 
money. Faced with the possibility of being caught, he bullies the kids 
into helping him create an elaborate series of lies to cover his crime. 
Gosh, I'm tearing up just thinking about this family film with a lot of 
heart, and we haven't even got to the parts about ritual circumcision, 
menstruation, flatulence, pig urine, and eating bugs yet. 
Oddly enough, the bodily function jokes are actually pretty entertaining, 
providing most of the occasional laughs in a movie that's far more 
frantic than funny. The creation and presentation of the "ritual tribal 
circumcision" footage provides some amusement. Later, young Mike apes his 
father's behavior at a school pageant, causing a riot when he explains 
how the Shelmikedmu "purify menstruating young virgins with pig urine," 
using a real classmate and a real pig for his demonstration. The scene is 
gross, but genuinely funny.
The same can't be said for most of the film. Despite loads of gross-out 
gags, "Krippendorf's Tribe" just isn't funny enough. The cast spends a 
great deal of time racing about frantically, providing far too few laughs 
for all the fuss. Todd Holland produced and directed many episodes of one 
of the funniest programs on television, "The Larry Sanders Show," but he 
doesn't handle this material with the same skill. The film suffers from a 
rushed feeling, with too many characters and too little character 
development. Lily Tomlin's Ruth Allen is an example of great potential 
that is wasted. The smug, self-righteous anthropologist hurries off to 
New Guinea to prove that the Shelmikedmu aren't real. Stomping through 
the jungle barking orders at her tribal guides, Ruth begins to come alive 
as a comic creation, but the scenes are merely used as quick-cut 
throwaways, never allowed a chance to fully blossom. That's typical of 
the film, as Holland takes a simple story concept and tries to jam way 
too much into it. 
Instead, we get an overdose of Jenna Elfman's terminally-perky Veronica. 
The in-your-face opportunist is overdone and annoying, becoming funny 
only when she's mad. After spotting herself in one of Krippendorf's bogus 
documentaries, demonstrating the "mating patterns of the Shelmikedmu," 
she becomes enraged, enacting revenge on Krippendorf during a moderately 
amusing talk show segment. Richard Dreyfuss, by the way, handles the 
central role with his usual staccato gusto. 
Ultimately, one wonders who "Krippendorf's Tribe" was made for. Adult 
audiences will have little patience for the large gaps between laughs. 
Family audiences are unlikely to appreciate a feel-good comedy where the 
hero gets a woman drunk, then films her having sex with him so he can 
show it on TV to bolster his massive fraud. But there is an upside. On 
the way home, Mom and Dad can spend quality time with the kids, answering 
all of their questions about circumcision and menstruation. Have fun, 
folks!</P>
