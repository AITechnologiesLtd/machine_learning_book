<PRE>Spanking the Monkey (1994)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 82</PRE>
<P>When is a black comedy not a comedy?  When the humor is
occasional and ironic, and when expressions of frustration
are incorrectly interpreted.  "Spanking the Monkey" is
a family drama and not a comedy, and its themes (which,
yes, include incest) are nothing to wink at.</P>
<P>Raymond (Jeremy Davies) has finished his first year of
pre-med at MIT, and has landed a desirable summer internship.
Unluckily, his attractive young mother (Alberta Watson)
has broken her leg and is bedridden.  Raymond's father
(Benjamin Hendrickson) is a struggling travelling
salesman.  Raymond is forced to forsake the internship and
play nurse to his mother, a duty which soon includes
giving her showers and massages, which lead to... well,
'nuff said.  Further complicating Raymond's life is a
forward but inexperienced neighbor girl (Carla Gallo).</P>
<P>Raymond's joyless family is in trouble.  The problems are so
deep as to be unsolvable.  Mom is bored, lonely, isolated and
sexually frustrated.  Dad is interested only in the family
dog, exercising control, and philandering.  Raymond wants to
escape the unhappy family for his internship, and lacks
sympathy for his parents' plight.  With Raymond at college,
Dad out on the road and Mom left home, the family
members seem driven apart from each other.</P>
<P>"Spanking the Monkey" was the debut feature for director
David Russell, who also wrote the script.  One source
says the budget was all of $80,000, but it couldn't
have been that low!  While the film has the feel of an
indy release, the cinematography is on a par with a major
studio release, and the casting is excellent.  "Spanking"
provides proof that all that is required of an excellent
film is good writing, direction and casting.  My favorite
supporting character is Aunt Helen (Judette Jones), whose
maternal eccentricities make her the film's only true
comic character.</P>
