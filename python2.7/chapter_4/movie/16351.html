_You've Got Mail_</PRE>
<P>_You've Got Mail_ is the latest of the Nora Ephron/Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan
movies in which, like _Sleepless in Seattle_, the two lovers, are
destined for each other, but are oblivious of this fact until the very
end.  It takes place in New York, where the two both work in the book
retail biz.</P>
<P>Side note: I love those huge bookstore chains with comfy chairs and
capucchino. It's a great place to relax, quick-skim potential purchases,
and try one of those forbidden pastries.  I frequent them at least once
a week.</P>
<P>Therefore, I'm not the most objective reviewer when it comes to this
film.  Its underlying subplot is of the huge corporate chains destroying
the Mom + Pop shop.  It's not unlike those annoying op-ed pieces I've
read about how those huge megalomaniacal theater chains running the
small theaters to the ground (lessee... better seating, greater
selection, better sound...).</P>
<P>It's been done before, but it doesn't seem to work in current films.
_What's Eating Gilbert Grape_ comes to mind.  In that, the small grocery
store is being put out of business by the huge grocery chain (with
double coupons, one-stop shopping, ATMs, etc. etc...).  _Big Night_
comes to mind.  I think only _It's a Wonderful Life_ was the most
successful.</P>
<P>Let the truth be proclaimed: the consumer is ALWAYS right.  If you like
the Mom and Pop shop, GO THERE.  If it doesn't stand up to the huge
chains for the many aforementioned reasons, then those stores may just
go out of business.  Sad, but think: the former employees may find a job
that better uses their skills for the general public.</P>
<P>So when _You've Got Mail_ rehashes this same plot-line, I get
distracted.  Frankly, as a former New Yorker, I've never encountered a
store equal to "The Shop Around the Corner" (only in Greenwich, CT).
The popular metropolitan bookstores are the Barnes & Nobles, the
specialty bookstores (i.e. technical books, religious books), and used
books (_The Strand_, promoted in _Six Degrees of Separation_).</P>
<P>Why couldn't have the store's owner, Birdie (Jean Stapleton) have
transformed the shop into one of these stores?  Or better marketed it's
children's book niche?  Instead, the screenplay sells out and
has it run into a bigger issue than it has any right to be.  The
campaign for market takeover turns into a battle that goes city-wide,
with local newscasters enterring the ring.  This goes on for twenty
minutes, is futile, and other than a few chuckles, just buys time.</P>
<P>So we are treated to the obligatory scene where Kathleen Kelly (Meg
Ryan) is sobbing, finally entering the chain store, and wells up in
tears when overhearing a conversation between a consumer and a
know-nothing employee.  A real cheap jab.  It is very likely the same
conversation could have occurred in _her_ store, with Steve Zahn's
character being the know-nothing employee.</P>
<P>Otherwise, _You've Got Mail_ is a funny, cute, romantic comedy.  Tom
Hanks and Meg Ryan play characters they know well. Nora Ephron displays
an uncanny West-Side New York tone: if you can stand the occasional
stench, you'll have a good time.</P>
<PRE>Nick Scale: (1 to 10): 6.</PRE>
