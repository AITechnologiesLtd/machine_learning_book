<P>   When the Japanese anime people get together to make a
political movie they are not going to be concerned with the
latest development in the race for the Akita City Council or
with the progress of the anti-noise lobby in Narita.  Anime
folks are prone to deal with nothing short of the
apocalyptic: the end of the world.  This is a theme not
unknown in America, which recently saw Peter Hyams direct
Arnold in "End of Days" and Don McKellan ask "where were
you on the final night of the earth" in "Last Night."  Where
Americans are the last word in special effects, first prize goes
to Japan in the sheer color and audacity of its animated
features.  Remember the marvelous "Princess Mononoke,"
which was Hayao Miyazaki's take on the final struggle
between good and evil (a major theme of the Zoroastrian
religion as well, by the way)?  Given the penchant for color
and design of Miyazaki (and let's not forget Satushi Kon's "A
Perfect Blue"), don't be surprised if the integrity of plot is not
uppermost.  If you go to "X" expecting anything like a linear
narrative or slow-moving, step-by-step development of story,
forget about it.  Don't worry if you don't comprehend much of
what's going on or see redundancy in the explosions of
buildings, laser beams that dwarf the rays and shafts of "Star
Wars," and characters who can fly through the air and are
nonetheless vulnerable to thrusts of the sword.  The biggest
audience laugh of the 98-minute film comes about 3/4 of the
way through when one of the central characters says,
"What's going on here?"--the understatement of the evening. 
Look for color, texture, animation, and the sheer joy that the
animators must have had in pushing graphic software to the
limit.</P>
<P>   But if you insist on the age-old need for a plot to give you
half an understanding of the fable, the world is about to end
(so what else is new)?  Only one man, Kamui, can save it. 
He faces the big decision: side with the fear-inspiring
Dragons of Heaven who opt to preserve Tokyo and the rest
of the world with all its problems, or take arms with the
Dragons of Earth who are intent to destroy our planet to save
it. (Huh?)  In a Jekyll-Hyde dualism similar to a theme
explored in "Princess Mononoke," whichever side Kamui
takes, his brother, whom he had early-on sworn to protect
forever, automatically becomes his bitter enemy pledged to
fight Kamui to the death, Star-Wars style.</P>
<P>   The director of this colorful bit of nihilism, Rintaro, has
been in the anime business for over 30 years, known in the
U.S. for directing the TV series "Kimba the White Lion" and
"Astro Boy."  The animation is done by Clamp, aka four
women from an all female animation studio.  The market for
this product is the massive number of comic book fans in the
U.S., say about 14-17 years old, usually associated with the
brightest people in their special-progress high-school classes. 
In Japan, in fact, the word is that this age group is going
more to anime films than to the reactionary passe stuff
peopled by human actors.  If one insists on interpretations of
the allegory, the two brothers represent humankind at war. 
Though alle menschen wierden bruder (says Beethoven in
the fourth movement of his ninth symphony), remember that
the tale of Cain and Abel ended in a not so fraternal manner. 
Are we doomed to be killed by our fellow creatures who look
more or less like us but have different political or religious
ideologies?  It sure looks that way if you go along with the
flow of "X."  Aside from that, a happy ending and we all go
home.  All of us, that is, who are about 16 and chose to see
and probably groove on this film while they could--somehow
knowing that ten years from now, they could see the same
thing and say, "Huh...I really went for something like this?"</P>
<P>Not Rated.  Running Time: 98 minutes.  (C) 2000
