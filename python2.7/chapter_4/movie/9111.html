<PRE>In & Out (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Some movies are bettered remembered by their trailers. In & Out is almost
that kind of movie. The trailer for In & Out is hilarious and reveals a
large chunk of the movie. Can the movie itself stand up to the trailer?</P>
<P>Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is an English teacher in the small town of
Greenleaf, Indiana. He wears a goofy bow tie and loves Barbra Streisand. He
is getting married in a few days, this after being engaged to his fiancée,
Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack), for three years. Howard's life is pretty
uneventful. That is until a former student, Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon),
blurts out that Howard is gay during his Oscar acceptance speech. This puts
a big spin on Howard's life. In come the media, friends, and family asking
if Howard really is gay. Howard denies it at first, but then starts to
confront the issue. And both him and we are trying to figure out if he's
gay or not.</P>
<P>In & Out is a light-hearted comedy that had me laughing hard at times, but,
there were some lulls. Kevin Kline is hilarious as Howard Brackett. He uses
some pretty amusing body language in his portrayal of Howard. As a student
tells him, "Watch the hand thing." As Howard tries to find out who he
really is, he tries a do-it-yourself package on exploring your manliness.
As he taps his feet and throws his arms in the air to start dancing the
tape tells him, "Truly manly men don't dance."</P>
<P>Tom Selleck is a gay reporter covering the news extravaganza, and he does a
good job with his somewhat limited role. Debbie Reynolds is absolutely
psychotic as Howard's mother.</P>
<P>The real star of In & Out is Joan Cusack as Howard's three-year fiancée
Emily. Cusack is the psychotic and unstable Emily who looks like she is
going to go nuts at any given moment. As psychotic and unstable as Emily
is, Cusack makes Emily very innocent, and willing to do anything for
Howard, including losing 75 pounds for the wedding.</P>
<P>Frank Oz has a great sense of comic timing and keeps the laughs rolling,
even up to half way through the credits. The macho man ending to the film
leaves the audience with a silly grin walking out the door. Though, the
ending events are somewhat contrived, but they work to make for a happy
ending.</P>
<P>Though I loved the trailers, the movie is not a letdown. In & Out has its
small flaws but in the end, the humor overshadows the flaws. In & Out is a
hilarious film that I highly recommend. This is a must see movie.</P>
<P>"Do you know how many times I've seen Funny Girl?!" - Emily. </P>
