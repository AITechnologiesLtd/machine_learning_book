<P>It starts as a tragedy when Bengt (Malmsten) goes blind after an accident
at a military rifle range, but develops into more of a comedy (perhaps
unintentionally) - Ingmar Bergman's fourth movie as a director.
 The script by Dagmar Edqvist presents dialogue sometimes laughably
naive, and the cliches come close. It's hard to tell sometimes if you're
laughing at the poorness or the funniness of the script. What saves the
film, though, is the beautiful photography and the performances of
Birger Malmsten and Mai Zetterling, who plays the housemaid who falls in love
with Malmsten. The presence of Zetterling is indescribable. More than
once the camera takes a close-up of her face which makes you think
of silent movies and Greta Garbo. Is it a message from Bergman that he
rather would have made a silent ? 
 During the final scene in a train-coupe, someone in the audience shouts
to his friends: - Wasn't that Bergman behind the window ? Neither I nor
anyone else seem to have recognized Bergman. Looking this up at home I
can't find any certifying proof of this Bergman appearance. Maybe the
man just saw the early films' hard-recognized spirit of Bergman's later
so recognizable style ?</P>
