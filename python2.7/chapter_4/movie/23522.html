<P>As a movie critic, I take copious notes (yes, it's pretty tough to do in 
a darkened theater, but I manage), even though I rarely use them for my 
reviews unless it's been awhile since I've seen the movie in question.  
Usually, I refer to my notepad to pinpoint an interesting bit of action, 
or as a reminder of what the movie is trying to "say".</P>
<P>In the case of this movie, it didn't help.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below):
Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a creative-writing professor, constant 
joint-smoker, and burnt-out writer whose current wife (of many previous) 
left him a few hours before he finds out that his girlfriend, university 
Chancellor Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand) is pregnant--a fact that 
"would greatly surprise" Walter Gaskell (Richard Thomas), Sara's 
husband.  As if that wasn't enough, one of his students, Katie Holmes 
(Hannah Green) has a crush on him; another student, James Leer (Tobey 
Maguire) has the potential to be a top-notch writer, but is...a bit 
off-kilter; and Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.), his book editor, is 
pressing Grady to finish his second novel.  Oh yeah: I shouldn't forget 
Walter's blind dog Poe, who doesn't like Grady, much to his demise.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
That's pretty much the storyline, I reckon.  But throughout my copious 
notes, I seemed to keep noting, "so what's this story about?"  I still 
don't know.  This, my friends, is Not A Good Thing.</P>
<P>I've been wanting to see this movie from the first time I saw the 
trailers for it.  And from the storyline, it reads like--in the right 
hands--it could be a pretty funny comedy.  With the pedigree the movie 
had going for it--Douglas has been known to be funny in a movie or two; 
McDormand was wonderful in "Fargo" and could certainly tickle a funny 
bone on her own; Maguire, great in "The Cider House Rules" and 
"Pleasantville" would be, if nothing else, a decent straight-man; and 
in-between prison terms, Downey has the acting chops to be capable of 
greatness--from all that, I would've sworn that those were the "right 
hands".  So wha' happened? </P>
<P>Two things, I think: first, contrary to the misleading trailers, "Wonder 
Boys" was not an all-out comedy.  True, it had some humorous moments, 
but for the most part, it was much heavier on the "drama" part of the 
"dramedy" equation.  Second, it seemed more literary (for lack of a 
better term) than most movies; while some of that can be attributed to 
the movie being about writers, I wouldn't be surprised if writer Michael 
Chabon was more a novelist than a screenwriter.   Strangely enough, that 
particular attribute didn't work in this movie's favor: perhaps because 
I've become so accustom to movies being written as movies as opposed to 
being written as literary stories, the "feel" of this movie didn't click 
for me.  In fact, it wasn't until the ending that it seemed like a 
movie-movie.  And strangely enough, that scene felt out of place.</P>
<P>While I think it would've done better as a comedy than as the thick, 
somewhat dragging Social Statement (of what? I still ask) that it was, 
"Wonder Boys" still had its moments--most of which were populated by 
Robert Downey Jr. in a performance that actually angers me.  It angers 
me because he was so naturally good--something rare in actors these 
days, especially younger actors--that it only highlights the mess he's 
made of his personal life: last I knew, he was in prison for, basically, 
stupidity (something about not fufilling probation terms for his 
habitual drug abuse).  When he's on his game, I'd take Downey over a 
dozen DiCaprios, any day; Robert acts circles around Leo and his posse.  </P>
<P>Just as his costar in "Cider", Charlize Theron, did in "Reindeer Games", 
Maguire disappointed me here.  His depressed (and depressing) James did 
not suit him well; his boyish face betrayed his scripted lines, and the 
bizarre storyline he was involved in, just wasn't working.  As for the 
rest of the cast, Douglas' uncanny resemblance to "Mrs. Doubtfire" threw 
me for a loop at first--and Grady's whole makeup (constant marijuana 
smoker, non-committal boyfriend, "blocked" writer who refuses to 
acknowledge his block) didn't do much for me.  I was never sure what The 
Point was with him (unless it was to say that Drugs Make You Look Bad.  
If so, that was a long way to go to make a weak point).  It was 
refreshing, though, to see what happened between Hannah and Grady; as 
much as I liked "American Beauty" (which has a comparitive situation 
between an older man and younger girl), it was nice to see Holmes play 
Hannah's attraction to Grady, in a non-dysfunctional manner.</P>
<P>I'm still at a loss to know what purpose Quentin "Q" Morewood (Rip Torn) 
played; maybe his Important Scenes were left on the same cutting-room 
floor that Thomas' "Outraged Husband" scenes surely were left on (which 
would be the only explanation I can see for not further exploring the 
dynamic that must have existed between Walter, Sara and Grady).  But 
perhaps that's another movie--the movie that I would've preferred to 
watch way more than this one.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
In one of the many "huh?" moments that seem to be generously scattered 
throughout this flick, a Little Richard-lookalike takes issue with Grady 
having possession of his vehicle, and Does Something About It.  I'd be 
tickled pink if someone could explain what that whole subplot was about 
to me, so I can stop going, "huh?".</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
...and continuing on with our "Just Say No" theme for the week 
("Reindeer Games" having led us off), "Wonder Boys" serves as a strange 
vehicle for Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Frances McDormand; they 
each seemed out-of-place in this trippy tale.  But "Just Say No--NOW!" 
Poster Boy Robert Downey Jr. was brilliant, as he often is when he puts 
his mind to it.  And where has Richard "John-Boy" Thomas been all these 
years, anyway?</P>
<P>"Wonder Boys" (rating: yellowlight): 
I still Wonder about them thar Boys--and about why Downey insists on 
derailing his career.  There's nothing more galling to me than wasted 
potential, and he has it in spades.</P>
