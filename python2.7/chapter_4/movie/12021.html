<P>Belle Epoque is a fun film to watch, but one better be prepared to get a
handle on the political jokes, or this film will simply come off as a bit of
a weird, and unusual story.  What really drives this film, is not the story,
or the lucky young man, but the political upheavals that even the family is
going through, from the father, to the daughters, and finally, the mother.</P>
<P>It is the story of a young man that deserts the army because it has gone
crazy on him, and is fighting too many political battles that don't make
sense at all.  And he wants out of it.  But his wanting out of it, only
lands him in a place where politics reigns supreme, even if not honorably.</P>
<P>When he is ready to leave the place he wound up in, he finds out that the
old man he has befriended has four daughters.  And he decides to stick
around.  In no time he makes himself helpful in the
household where he cooks up some specialties that everyone enjoys, from the
priest to anyone else, even if their politics are all screwed up.  At least
they agree on something.... food..... and well .... sex.</P>
<P>But what starts out as what might appear as a good intention on the young
man's part, becomes either a joke, or just another conquest. And everyone is
on a conquest, except Don Manolo.  And he is the
best part of the story, and the most interesting.  Surprisingly enough he is
the only not walking around thinking of sex.  Well for good reason, if we
can appreciate the fact that his own wife is also on a conquest.</P>
<P>But BELLE EPOQUE is a fun film to watch, as things turn so quickly and get
so mixed up that it is a wonder that worse things do not happen all the
time.  While well directed, with almost all the political stuff as throw
away lines and bits of comedy, Fernando Trueba's terrain seems to indicate
that the area of love is never to be mixed up with politics.  One of the
daughters lives a terrible ( is it.? ) mess because of it, but takes
advantage of it when it serves her.</P>
<P>Eventually Fernandp finds his match, well, the one that he got caught with,
anyway. And the film comes to a nice close.... nothing changed, it seems.
And politics are still alive and well. And maybe Juanito and Luz will make
it and have a better time for it. But after three sisters, this may take
some doing.</P>
<P>Unlike some other spanish films that take the political situations
seriously, this one makes a complete mockery of them, starting with Juanito,
who has a terrible problem with his mother.  But even their politics only
last as far as the guns seem to be aimed at certain political factions.  In
1931, and after the second world war, this was a serious problem.  Many
country folks did not take to the new system as easily as the town folks did
under the pointed guns.</P>
<P>BELLE EPOQUE is a fun film to watch and stay with, even if it appears to
drag here and there.  All the girls are interesting and everyone of them is
well defined as a character.</P>
<PRE>Fun film.</PRE>
