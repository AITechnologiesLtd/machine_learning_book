<PRE>THE PRINCESS BRIDE (1987)</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Simon Doherty</PRE>
<P>Any director who can make films as diverse as Misery, This is Spinal
Tap and The American President deserves kudos for variety.  Rob Reiner
has displayed as much range as anyone around, and what's more his
films are always entertaining.  Here he turned to the fantasy genre,
and again came up with a winner; a film that will genuinely be enjoyed
by both children and adults.</P>
<P>The story: A boy (Fred Savage) is ill in bed so his grandfather (Peter
Falk, of Columbo) comes to read a book to him: The Princess Bride.  It
is this book that makes up the bulk of the film.  Robin Wright plays
Buttercup, a girl who finds True Love with her farmhand Westley (Cary
Elwes).  However, Buttercup hears one day that Westley has been killed
by pirates, and so she submits to Prince Humperdinck's (Chris
Sarandon) desire to marry her.  After she is kidnapped, though,
Westley comes to rescue her.  He later has the help of Mandy Patinkin
and Andre the Giant, playing a master swordsman and ... a giant.  To
be fair to Andre, he displays an acting ability that far surpasses the
standards usually seen in the WWF, and he doesn't let the film down in
the slightest.</P>
<P>I first saw this movie when I was about ten, and I absolutely loved
it.  It had it all; a mysterious hero, fantastic sword fights, an oily
villain and giant monsters.  It was the kind of film that we would
re-enact countless times on the playground, after prolonged arguments
over who got to play whom.  I truly wished that I was Westley, almost
as much as I wished I could be Marty McFly.  Few things could be
cooler than being able to sword fight, although being able to play
Johnny B.  Goode is one of them.  It's a rare movie that captures a
kid's imagination so completely.</P>
<P>Now, at the cynical, world-weary age of 18, it's still great fun to
watch.  The film retains the best aspects of the fantasy genre while
also gently satirising it.  The scenes between grandfather and
grandson are well observed and stay the right side of sentimental.
There's also amusing cameos from Mel Smith and Billy Crystal, and
unfortunately an unamusing cameo from Peter Cook (It's basically him
talking with an exaggerated lisp).</P>
<P>Who would I like to be now?  Hey, I'll be an ill kid if it means Columbo
is my grandfather.</P>
