<PRE>                                 28 DAYS
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Everyone knows that writers are drunks.  I mean, I'm drunk right
now.  I'm surprised I can type, you know, since my hands are shaking so
bad and my vision is so blurry.</P>
<P>     If you're ready to buy in to the writer-as-alcoholic cliché, you
should just love 28 Days, which pulls out every stereotype in the book.
Sandra Bullock stars as Gwen, the aforementioned drunk writer (living,
naturally, in New York City), who ruins her sister's wedding by
insulting her during the toast, falling on the cake, and wrecking the
"just married" car by crashing it into a house!  Off to rehab for her,
where she meets a cast of characters drawn so broadly they could
populate a sitcom on UPN.</P>
<P>     Those also trying to sober up include heroin addict Andrea (TV's
Azura Skye), sex fiend Oliver (TV's Michael O'Malley), and drunk
ex-doctor Daniel (TV's Reni Santoni).  There's the requisite love
interest, drunk baseball pitcher Eddie (Viggo Mortensen), plus the devil
on poor Gwennie's shoulder, boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West), whom she's
left back at home to carouse through the big city while she sobers up.</P>
<P>     Gwen and co. are put through their 12 steps in short order,
hugging, chanting, cleaning, climbing, singing, taking classes, and
bonding with one another over this horrible, horrible disease they all
must learn to deal with.  See Gwen try to charm a horse.  See Gwen's
sister (Elizabeth Perkins) confront her.  See Gwen sob over mother (also
an alky), who died when she was a kid, safely laying the blame off on
someone else.  See audience roll eyes.  Wow, these 28 days really only
feel like 19!</P>
<P>     The whole movie walks a tightrope between farce and melodrama, but
falls liberally into both.  In fact, the only saving graces of the film
come from the caricatures of supporting characters: Steve Buscemi as
Gwen's fallen angel counselor; Alan Tudyk stealing the show as a
flamboyantly gay, vaguely Teutonic basket case.</P>
<P>     Regular readers of filmcritic.com will know that I've never been a
fan of Miss Bullock's work (see also The Net), and her "Golly, I hope I
get an Oscar" performance here doesn't do much to change my opinion.
Director Betty Thomas (The Brady Bunch Movie) is also completely out of
her element.  She even shot six episodes of the faux soap opera "Santa
Cruz" featured as a running gag in the film -- time that might have been
better spent teaching Sandra how to do drama.</P>
<P>     But what am I saying?  I'm just a drunk writer whose only worry is
where his next martini is coming from.  Don't listen to me.  Hey,
bartender!</P>
