<PRE>PRIMARY COLORS (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Primary Colors is more than a retelling of the 1992 Clinton campaign; it's
an in-depth look at the political machine.  Surprisingly, the film does not
belong to John Travolta.  Yes, Travolta is in the film, but Adrian Lester
is the one to watch.</P>
<P>Primary Colors follows the presidential campaign of Jack Stanton (John
Travolta) who is a man of virtue that will not go dirty in order to win a
campaign.  He is a man who stops being a politician and starts telling the
truth.  In addition to his headstrong and clear-headed wife, Susan (Emma
Thomson), Stanton has a great campaign team behind him: Daisy Green (Maura
Tierney), Richard Jemmons (Billy Bob Thornton), Libby Holden (Kathy Bates),
and Henry Burton (Adrian Lester).</P>
<P>As in the real Clinton campaign, we have this historical stuff: a
womanizing president, the 'other woman,' and the spin-doctors that try to
hide the Presidential candidate's misdeeds.</P>
<P>The posters feature Travolta and Thomson prominently, but that is only a
way to draw the crowd in.  Yes, they have big roles, but they are not the
main characters.  Henry Burton, played well by Adrian Lester, is the main
character, and we see the campaign through his eyes.  Burton is at first
reluctant to join up with Stanton as his campaign manager.  After seeing
how selflessly Stanton reacted to group of illiterate adults who took their
own time to learn to read, Burton reconsiders.</P>
<P>In addition, we are introduced to the moral issues through him.  Lester
handles his role beautifully and draws us into the film.</P>
<P>The main scene-stealer, next to Lester, is Kathy Bates as the loud
potty-mouthed dirt digger, Libby Holden.  Her character becomes pivotal
late in the movie.  Bates, who I last saw in Titanic, has more to do here
and she handles it well.  I loved the scene in which she goes to talk to a
tabloid news guy about an audio tape.</P>
<P>Travolta is Bill Clinton.  He has the speech patterns, voice, and
mannerisms of Bill Clinton so well that it's scary.  Though Emma Thomson
has nothing in common with Hilary, she plays her part well.</P>
<P>The script by Elaine May is an adaptation of the book by the same name,
written by "Anonymous."  I have not read the book yet, so I cannot comment
on how well the book translated into the screenplay.  As it stands, the
screenplay is well written except for a few details.</P>
<P>Two big details bugged me.  The biggest was the 140-minute running time of
the film.  Director Mike Nichols should have edited some of the scenes.
The other complaint, and this may seem weird, is that the film seems to end
too abruptly.</P>
<P>However, as I drove away from the theatre, the ending seemed fitting and
after a few minutes of thought, I saw how well this ending works.  Most
people, though, will probably think that the ending was a bit forced and
abrupt.</P>
<P>Primary Colors is a good look into a campaign and the continuing dilemma:
should the candidate give up virtue in order to win?  This movie is not as
harsh as Wag the Dog was, but it still attacks Clinton in a softer, more
comical and satirical way.  In the end though, you'll walk out of the
theatre wondering what you would be willing to give up in order to win a
Presidential race.</P>
