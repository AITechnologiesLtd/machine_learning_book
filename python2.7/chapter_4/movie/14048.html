A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Pat Proft</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Pat Proft</PRE>
<P>Starring: Leslie Nielsen, Richard Crenna, Kelly LeBrock, Melinda McGraw</P>
<P>Ingredients: Parody about fugitive searching for the real killer</P>
<P>Synopsis:
In this farcical spoof of THE FUGITIVE a concert violinist named Ryan
Harrison (Leslie Nielsen) is seduced by someone else's wife (Kelly Le
Brock), and invited for a late night rendezvous. Reaching the mansion,
Harrison gets attacked by a mysterious one-armed, one-legged, one-eyed
terrorist, and framed for the husband's murder. Thanks to a lucky
accident, Harrison escapes from the prison bus, becomes a fugitive, and
attempts to find out who framed him. Meanwhile a crack team of lawmen
led by Fergus Falls (Richard Crenna) is hot on the trail.</P>
<P>WRONGFULLY ACCUSED is not an action movie, but a Leslie Nielsen comedy
similar to the  NAKED GUN series. The main idea is to poke fun at movies
such as ANACONDA, TITANIC, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, BRAVEHEART and THE
FUGITIVE through the use of unlikely comedic situations and rambling
dialogue containing movie theme cliches and catchphrases. </P>
<P>Opinion:
The main character's name (Ryan Harrison) is obviously an amalgam of
Harrison Ford and Jack Ryan (Ford played the Jack Ryan character in the
movies PATRIOT GAMES and CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER), so most of the
parody revolves around Harrison Ford movies. In fact, there's even a
sendup of the scene where space hero Han Solo gets encased in a block of
carbonite. </P>
<P>The comedy, however, is hit or miss. The farce is good (typically he
escapes one danger only to get bonked on the head by another), but the
parts of dialogue where Harrison goes on rambling discourses concerning
the Beatles and other topics are more boring than funny. On a scale of
one to ten on the comedy scale, I'd give it a six. </P>
