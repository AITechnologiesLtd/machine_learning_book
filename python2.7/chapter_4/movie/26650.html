<P>"Bedazzled" should have been a corker of a movie. A loose remake of the
well-regarded 1967 comedy written by and starring Peter Cook and Dudley
Moore, the story of a love struck loser who sells his soul in exchange
for seven wishes is serviceable enough. Leading man Brendan Fraser has a
good track record with comedy and Elizabeth Hurley certainly has the
physical assets necessary to make a sultry Devil. As if all that wasn't
enough, the director of the production is Harold Ramis, the man behind
"Caddyshack," "Groundhog Day" and "Analyze This."</P>
<P>"Bedazzled" should have been a corker, but the results are only
moderately amusing. Fraser is overly cartoonish, as are most of the
supporting players, and the love story is too superficial to be
involving. Overall, the film plays like an expensive episode of a TV
sketch comedy series.</P>
<P>The problems begin with a sloppy script by Larry Gelbart ("M*A*S*H"),
Ramis and Peter Tolan. Their story revolves around Elliot Richards
(Fraser), a computer tech-support worker with godawful social skills.
Mocked and shunned by his co-workers, Elliot pines for Alison (Frances
O'Connor), a beautiful fellow employee he has worshipped from afar.
After blowing an encounter with her at a nightspot, he says aloud that
he would "give anything" to have the woman.</P>
<P>Enter Lucifer, in the form of Elizabeth Hurley. In exchange for his
soul, she offers him seven wishes. Elliot leaps at the chance, only to
discover that Beelzebub has no intentions of giving him a smooth ride.
Elliot wishes he was rich, powerful and married to Alison. In a flash,
he gets his wish, only to learn that he is a rich, powerful Colombian
drug lord with enemies everywhere. Alison is indeed his wife, but she
detests him.</P>
<P>And so goes the game, as Elliot keeps trying to make the perfect wish,
while Satan continues to find some flaw in his wording that will allow
her to make his life a nightmare.</P>
<P>This type of story has been done a million times, but even the most worn
idea can work if the writers are sufficiently inventive. In "Groundhog
Day," Ramis took a similar set-up, which gave the hero multiple chances
to win the heart of a woman, and crafted a comedy that was as sweet and
touching as it was funny. He did so by allowing his protagonist to grow
from a one-note wiseass into a rounded human being and by allowing the
romance to grow from superficial attraction to something far more
substantial.</P>
<P>Don't look for any growth here. Elliot remains a buffoon throughout the
film, until the closing moments, when Ramis and company whack him upside
the head with an unconvincing epiphany. In the romance department, don't
expect anything deeper than "I want her. Let's cast another spell."</P>
<P>There was a moral to "Groundhog Day," one that was appreciated because
we saw it lived out on the screen. The moral in "Bedazzled" is so
slapped on that the filmmakers actually feel the need to have a
character state it aloud.</P>
<P>As for the comedy, where "Groundhog Day" moved from physical shtick to
subtler humor, "Bedazzled" sticks with slapstick and sight gags. The
story trudges from one sketch to another, a la "Saturday Night Live,"
with varying degrees of success. Expect everything from dick jokes to a
short, but sweet Abe Lincoln routine. The worst is a dated Dennis Rodman
bit, while the best is a cute piece of business, nicked from the
original film, involving Satan and a row of parking meters.</P>
<P>The lead actors add to the film's troubles. As Elliot the nerd, Brendan
Fraser overplays his part. In the "Superman" movies, Christopher Reeve
made a great Man of Steel, but a lousy Clark Kent, burying his character
in a load of facial twitches and excessive stammering. Fraser does the
same thing, turning Elliot from an insecure guy to a grating dork
caricature. As with Reeve, Fraser fails to realize that, when it comes
to self-conscious males, less is more.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Elizabeth Hurley is content to coo her way through the film,
changing costumes frequently, to the delight of the guys in the row
behind me. While most of her outfits are red designer devil wear, her
sexiest moment comes during a classroom scene, where she sports the
adult version of the classic Catholic schoolgirl outfit. Hurley's acting
is competent at best, though she does get to coolly informs Elliot,
"Yes, there's a God and, yes, he's a man. Most men think they're God –
this one just happens to be right."</P>
<P>Despite the occasionally solid one-liners, Hurley's performance lacks
bite, which is the main failing of "Bedazzled." If talented filmmakers
take on themes as familiar as this, it should be because they have
designed a bracing new approach to the material. When they put their own
movie on cruise control, you wonder why they bothered with the project
at all. Or more to the point, why should we?</P>
