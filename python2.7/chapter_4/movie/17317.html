<PRE>FORCES OF NATURE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In FORCES OF NATURE, Sandra Bullock's fans, who have had to watch her
talents wasted in mediocre films (PRACTICAL MAGIC and HOPE FLOATS) and
downright stinkers (TWO IF BY SEA), finally have a film of hers again to
cheer about.  Bullock, tapping her vast reservoir of charm and
confidence, gives her best performance since SPEED.  And with great
chemistry, Ben Affleck, from GOOD WILL HUNTING and CHASING AMY, plays
opposite her in an absolutely delightful romantic comedy.</P>
<P>In what is clearly a romantic takeoff on PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES,
the movie's script by Marc Lawrence is as intelligently funny as it is
good-spirited, and it has just enough of a serious underbelly to move
your head as well your heart.  Second-time director Bronwen Hughes
(HARRIET THE SPY) has a perfect sense of comedic timing as well as the
ability to make the mundane seem magical.</P>
<P>The story opens in New York with Ben Holmes (Affleck) being suitably
embarrassed at his bachelor party.  Shortly afterward, he leaves to
catch a plane to marry his fiancée, Bridget (Maura Tierney), in
Savannah.  Before he leaves, his grandfather gives him a shocking piece
of advice in one of the first instances of the movie's recurring
anti-marriage joke.  "Even if you love a woman, don't tie yourself
down," his long-married grandfather advises him sternly.  "Marriage is a
prison."</P>
<P>In a plane accident on the runway, Ben aids his free-spirited fellow
passenger Sarah (Bullock), who is extremely grateful.  With him scared
of flying and with no cars available for rent, they hitch a ride with a
harmless looking middle-aged guy named Vic (Jack Kehler).  This will be
the first of many mistakes they make on their ill-fated journey to
Savannah.  (Meanwhile, down on the plantation, Bridget, surrounded by
more Southern Belles than Scarlet O'Hara at Tara, becomes increasing
bored and frustrated.  Her story makes a nice companion piece to the
larger one of Ben and Sarah.)</P>
<P>Ben, who has no trouble making silly baby-talk phone calls to his future
wife, loathes taking risks of any kind.  A "jacket copywriter," his work
product includes calling a book "a scintillating tale of erotic
mummification."</P>
<P>Sarah, who represents everything that Ben isn't but deep down wishes he
were, is a born rebel.  She has gone from job to job with a typical one
being a hostess at an auto show.  She's also been an airline stewardess
and a stripper, the latter skill will prove useful later in the story.</P>
<P>A "seize the moment" kind of gal, she takes it as her role in life to
break Ben out of his rigid mold.  "Do you want to be on your deathbed
saying 'I played by the rules' or 'I lived'?" she asks him bluntly.</P>
<P>Bullock, who has never been more likeable than in FORCES OF NATURE,
charms Ben as well as the audience, but, being a loyal kind of guy, Ben
resists the temptation as long as possible.  Affleck, with his boyish
grin, is a perfect match for Bullock, and their chemistry is simply
adorable.</P>
<P>Among the movie's sight gags is a chintzy honeymoon suite they end up
in.  Ben, infatuated with Sarah but loyal to his fiancée, plunks down on
the bed only to hear the water slosh and the radio play "Love the one
you're with."  Although he tries to look away, he can see the outline of
Sarah's naked body torturing him through the semi-translucent glass
separating the bathroom from the bedroom.  Even the bathroom door, which
should provide a safe barrier, will not close.</P>
<P>The viewers become as conflicted as poor Ben.  The reasons for Ben not
to choose Sarah mount as fast as her desirability increases.</P>
<P>The picture is gorgeous, thanks to Elliot Davis's stunning
cinematography and Lester Cohen's brightly colored sets, full of
dramatic shades of green accentuated by lavish, contrasting colors.
Among the many memorable scenes are those featuring the forces of
nature.  Never have hurricanes or hailstorms looked so mystical and
inviting.  The leading edge of the hurricane, for example, causes
colorful strips of paper to swirl around the cast like a multicolored
snowstorm.</P>
<P>In a story that revels in chaos and ambiguity, the final resolution
wraps things up way too neatly and quickly.  The story's freshness goes
out the window as the writer seems in a hurry to close off all the loose
ends and take a more typical Hollywood approach.</P>
<P>FORCES OF NATURE runs a fast 1:40.  It is rated PG-13 for sensuality,
some profanity and a brief dope smoking scene and would be fine for kids
around 11 and up.</P>
