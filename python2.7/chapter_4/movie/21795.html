<P>Anywhere But Here (1999) by John Sylva    Rating: A</P>

<P>Director Wayne Wang (Smoke) and two time Academy Award winning writer Alvin
Sargent (Ordinary People) bring us Anywhere But Here, a touching, powerful film
based on the hit novel of the same title by Mona Simpson.  Anywhere But Here
tells a tale often told, but the actors and masterful screenplay make this one
of the year's best films that succeeds at being moving, without being overly
sappy.   </P>
<P>Anywhere But Here tells the story of Adele (Susan Sarandon) and Ann August
(Natalie Portman), mother and daughter (respectively), and their journey to
find freedom, independence, and success.  The duo lives a simple life in Bay
City, Wisconsin, a quiet, ordinary town in which the majority of residents
don't escape from once growing old.  Fourteen year old Ann is an intelligent,
bright girl who spends her leisure time with her cousin and best friend, the
always happy Benny (Shawn Hatosy), who understands and loves Ann with all his
heart.  When Ann learns her mom as decided to pick up and run off to Beverly
Hills, California with her, she is instantly crushed, as leaving Benny and her
hometown is not an easy transition to make.  The two travel across the country
in their gold colored Mercedes, having their share of laughs, but also their
share of fights. Ann feels constantly unhappy and frustrated during their trip,
as she always has around her mother.  Her mother is a woman who always wears a
gleaming smile, even when her daughter screams, "I hate you!"  Adele is rarely
hurt by Ann's cruel words, as she knows it is just part of Ann feeling
frustrated, and she's simply releasing cruel words, although they are only
somewhat true, to release that anger.  The two can get along better then any
pair of best friends at times, giggling and dancing around with joy, but when
Adele starts bringing in issues of where she wants and expects Ann to go in
life, the smiles fade, and the tears start running.  </P>
<P>The pair arrive in Beverly Hills, and from the get go they realize it's not all
that they were hoping for.  It's hard enough for them to find a place to live,
let alone to make a living there.  As hard as it is, Ann starts a new life
there, making new friends and taking on a new lifestyle.  Adele gets a job
working at a large school, which pays their bills.  They have made it this far,
but how much longer can Ann take Adele's manipulating ways?  </P>
<P>The relationship between Adele and Ann is composed of strong sincerity and
realism.  The mother/daughter relationship is one of the most real, honest
situations in a movie this year.  The dialogue, the fights, the troubles,
everything about the pair is so true to life, it's scary.  I get a kick out of
one of the most real situations in the movie, in which Adele and Ann are
cruising down a long, calm road, listening to the snappy music of The Beach
Boys on the radio.  Adele is tapping and singing happily, and doesn't seem to
have a care in the world.  Ann is slumped in the corner of her seat looking
truly unhappy.  Ann turns the radio off and quotes, "I hate the Beach Boys." 
Adele turns the radio back on, and simply replies, "No one hates the Beach
Boys."  For all us children in the world, this happens day in and day out to
us.  It is wonderful to see such realistic phrases used in a movie about
bonding, as through watching Anywhere But Here, some of that frustration felt
within a child can be released, and that child can find humor in situations
that they are presented with daily, because it is on screen, all part of a
fictional story.  Although Anywhere But Here is fiction, much of the film feels
like reality, in that it captures the parent/child relationship perfectly, and
lets the viewer relate every step of the way.  I often so myself in Ann, seeing
her pain in the exact situations I have been in.  It's astonishing how Alvin
Sargent captures such reality in his script.  </P>
<P>Anywhere But Here tells it like it is, and doesn't make an exaggerated, over
the top metaphor about growing up.  Unlike most teen movies to be released this
year, Anywhere But Here contains lines that teens and parents actually say, and
puts the characters in situations that people are really in- compared to the
teeny bopper movies, where all kids have it perfect, and parents don't care
what their children take part in. </P>
<P>The relationships between all of the characters are shockingly real, as when
Benny and Ann are together, you'll think that Wayne Wang was videotaping real
teens, catching them in their most natural state.  Unlike how friends are
portrayed in most movies, Benny and Ann share a connection that you can feel
just by seeing them together, as the actors bring their teen characters to life
extraordinarily.  </P>
<P>Sarandon is astonishing as her eccentric, charismatic character, as she
convinces you of her deep, impassioned love for her daughter, and lets you feel
the fact that Adele may seem over the top, or a little nuts at times, but she
just doesn't want to let go.  Sarandon gives her second Oscar worthy
performance in two years, (the other being her role as a cancer diagnosed
mother in 1998's Stepmom) but she has never shined in a role like she does in
Anywhere But Here.  Susan succeeds at being funny without being ridiculous, as
she easily resembles any parent of a child out there today.  At times, you feel
sympathy for Adele, as you understand her cautions of letting go, but at times,
you downright despise her, as she is unnecessarily rude to Ann on numerous
occasions, but in the end, it's easy to understand: It's all out of love.</P>
<P>Although Sarandon is captivating, she is upstaged by Natalie Portman, who at a
ripe 18 years old, is one of my favorite actresses.  Most recently seen in last
summer's Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, Portman gives an Oscar worthy
performance that I doubt any other actress her age, or even two times her age
at that, could master as well as she does.  Portman's character couldn't be any
more realistic, as the 14 year old has frequent mood swings, feels consistent
conflicted feelings, and is frustrated with her life and where it is going. 
Portman lets the viewer feel every possible emotion with her character, making
you relate, sympathize, and understand her character through every moment. 
Natalie gets her first, largely publicized, leading role here, and proves that
she is going to become a screen legend in the years to come. </P>
<P>Anywhere But Here features an all star, powerful soundtrack used effectively in
the film.  The right song at the right moment makes you feel more emotion then
the actors do themselves, and this film uses this tactic to the fullest.  In an
especially powerful scene, Sarah McLachlan's "I Will Remember You" is used,
letting you feel unspeakable sadness for the characters.</P>
<P>All in all, Anywhere But Here is remarkably flawless.  You'll laugh with the
characters, you'll cry with them, and you'll change with them.  Anywhere But
Here is a movie of unspeakable realism and power, and should be cherished by
anyone that has ever gone through the troubles of being a kid.  Anywhere But
Here hardly covers any new material, but because the characters and the
relationships between them are so complex and genuine, the film engrosses you
from start to finish.  The message behind the film is an important and real
one, and told in a way that makes Anywhere But Here for boys and girls, of all
ages.  Wayne Wang, Alvin Sargent, and everyone else involved with the film
should be proud of themselves, and realize what an achievement they have
accomplished: crafting one of the year's most memorable, finest, real films.  </P>
<P>The Bottom Line: Like Ann says about her mother... "There is some romance, some
power about my mother," there is some romance, some power about this movie that
gives it a special place within me.</P>
