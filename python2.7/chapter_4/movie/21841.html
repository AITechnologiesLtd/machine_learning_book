<P>End of Days (1999) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger,
Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollak.</P>
<PRE>MEMO #1112699</PRE>
<PRE>FROM: AGENT 999 (HOLLYWOOD BUREAU)</PRE>
<P>TO: SATAN, THE DEVIL, BEELZEBUB, PRINCE OF DARKNESS, LORD OF THE FLIES,
ETC., ETC.</P>
<PRE>Sire,</PRE>
<P> Your plan to take over and rule the earth is proceeding smoothly. The
movie, "End of Days", has been released and in it you appear so inept and
lame-brained that mankind will be lulled into a state of inertia upon your
return.</P>
<P> To review: A while back I possessed the soul - what little of it there was
- of an executive at Universal Pictures and green-lighted a preposterous
and silly screenplay entitled "End of Days."</P>
<P> As you know, it's the story of your return to Earth at the millennium to
sire a child and thus begin your reign of darkness. Why you must impregnate
a woman is never really made clear, but at least it gives us some
opportunities to show some female skin, thus assuring us the young male
audience.</P>
<P> To further our endeavor we lured Arnold Schwarzenegger back to the screen
to play your adversary, a former cop turned security specialist named
Jericho Cane.</P>
<P> Casting him was a God send, if you'll pardon my expression.</P>
<P> What better way to prove your vulnerability than by having the stuffings
beaten out of you by the wooden Schwarzenegger. Forget that he can't act or
that his emotional range is a wide as a matchstick. He knows how to handle
firearms (throughout, he continually shoots you with an arsenal of useless
weaponry), can throw a punch and can also take a lickin' and keep on
tickin'. (Sorry, boss, since I've lived among the humans I've become
addicted to their television.)</P>
<P> Plus, we had the screenwriter, one Andrew W. Marlowe, throw in so many
obstacles and conditions that it makes it almost a certainty that you will
fail.</P>
<P> For example, you have to impregnate the young woman while in human form
and must do so between 11 p.m. and midnight on Dec. 31.</P>
<P> Of course, this is all piffle and nonsense, but it gives old Arnie a
fighting chance to stop you - as if he could in real life. (Boss, you'll
love the scene in which an old lady almost beats Cane to a pulp.)</P>
<P> And just to try stirring up some controversy for the film, we've
incorporated a fanatical set of gun-toting, knife-wielding priests whose
mission is to kill the girl before you can get your hands on her. If the
church got honked off about "Dogma", this one will drive them over the top.</P>
<P> And the scene of Schwarzenegger as a Christ figure crucified to the side
of a building will surely make those do-gooders foam at the mouth.</P>
<P> Oh evil one, I wouldn't lie (not to you, at least), but "End of Days" is
so bad that it is almost comical.</P>
<P> To ensure that it is not taken seriously, I hired Rod Steiger, the king of
overacting, for the pivotal role of a priest. Of course, he did just as
expected. You could smell the bacon when he was on the set.</P>
<P> Also, we cast Gabriel Byrne, a decent actor, but not particularly a
charismatic or good-looking guy to play you. No offense, sire, but the idea
wouldn't work if we cast some hunk like Brad Pitt or Edward Norton as
Satan. What young woman wouldn't want to bed down with either of them?</P>
<P> As they say out here, the movie will do boffo at the box office - at least
for a week or two, just long enough to lull people into complacency for
your real return.</P>
<P> My only regret, chief, is that we didn't plan for a sequel. But, who's
going to need one when, right? To paraphrase a pop cult line from an
earlier Schwarzenegger movie, "You'll be back."</P>
<P> P.S. Pardon my presumption, sire, but I just had a devilishly brilliant
idea. Delay your takeover until we get the grosses. If "End of Day" does
well, it will revitalize Schwarzenegger's career - and that will be hell on
earth.</P>
