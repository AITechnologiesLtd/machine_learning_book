<P>     The public relations people at Universal Pictures are going out of 
their way to emphasize that THE JACKAL is not a remake of Fred 
Zinnemann's 1973 masterpiece, THE DAY OF THE JACKAL.  While 
acknowledging that this new motion picture is based on the original, 
producer James Jacks stressed that the first film's "central premise 
[serves] as the basis for a whole new suspense thriller."  Actually, the 
more distance the studio places between the two films, the better, 
because the 1997 production can't hold a candle to the 1973 release, and 
an attempted comparison only makes the new Bruce Willis/Richard Gere 
vehicle look worse.  Anyone who believes the least inspired remake to 
star Willis was LAST MAN STANDING (a re-working of A FISTFUL OF 
DOLLARS/YOJIMBO) may have reason to re-think that position after seeing 
this movie.</P>
<P>     What has survived?  Not much, and certainly not any sense of true 
suspense.  THE DAY OF THE JACKAL was a real white-knuckler.  THE JACKAL 
is so lifeless that there are times when it's in danger of putting the 
audience into a coma.  The central idea -- about an expensive assassin 
being hired to kill a high-profile target -- remains the same.  This 
time, the Jackal is played by an uncharismatic Bruce Willis, whose 
interpretation does little to efface the mark left by Edward Fox.  
Beyond the bare-bones plot skeleton, however, screenwriter Chuck Pfarrer 
has changed a lot, albeit little for the better.  And director Michael-
Caton Jones, who did wonderful work on both SCANDAL and ROB ROY, fails 
to connect with this material.</P>
<P>     On this occasion, the Jackal is a high-tech killer.  His arsenal 
includes state-of-the-art, computer-controlled weapons, he's plugged 
into the Internet, and he uses a cellular phone.  Like Val Kilmer in THE 
SAINT, he's a master of disguise, although Willis is recognizable no 
matter what color his hair is, what clothes he's wearing, or how much 
makeup he has on.  The Jackal's target is a highly-placed person in the 
United States -- perhaps the director of the FBI, and his asking price 
for the hit is a cool $70 million.  For that, he will do the deed then 
disappear forever.</P>
<P>     But a deputy director at the FBI, Carter Preston (Sydney Poitier), 
knows that something is up, and he suspects that the Jackal, an almost-
mythical killer (at one point, Preston states: "We've never been able to 
prove if he even exists"), may be involved.  So, along with Major 
Valentina Koslova (Diane Venora), a member of the Russian police force 
involved in the case, Preston seeks the aid of Declan Mulqueen (Gere), 
an IRA terrorist serving a prison term for weapons violations.  Mulqueen 
has knowledge that's vital to stopping the Jackal, but there's a catch -
- he won't divulge it unless his demands are met.  Eventually, Mulqueen 
is out of jail, albeit in FBI custody, and the chase is on.</P>
<P>     The problem is that the chase, which should be a taut nail-biter, 
is dull.  Yes, it zips from country-to-country, globe trotting from 
Moscow to Helsinki to Montreal to Washington D.C. to Chicago, but, aside 
from a few interesting explorations into the complexity of the Jackal's 
methods, there's very little of interest here.  In the original THE DAY 
OF THE JACKAL, the buildup was the payoff.  Here, it's just filler while 
we're waiting for the predictable final show-down between the two leads.  
And, if you can't guess how that turns out, you don't see many movies.  </P>
<P>     In the place of genuine tension, THE JACKAL resorts to bloody 
violence.  Plot contrivances abound as well.  Aside from the gaping 
holes in logic, there's the simple matter of the Jackal's supposed 
intelligence.  I say "supposed," because there are times when he comes 
across as a borderline-moron.  During the course of the film, he has 
several chances to kill Mulqueen, but what does he do instead?  Stares 
at him for an inordinately long time, then smirks once or twice -- 
that's the method of a Hollywood invention, not a believable expert.  
Mulqueen, on the other hand, makes so many brilliant leaps of intuition 
that one suspects him of having a direct link to the Psychic Network.</P>
<P>     The two lead characters, the Jackal and Mulqueen, are described as 
"ice" and "fire."  It's easy to see Willis' performance as icy -- the 
Jackal is completely emotionless throughout.  Gere, on the other hand, 
doesn't do much to infuse Mulqueen with tangible passion, although the 
actor is better here than in his recent anti-Chinese flop, RED CORNER 
(and his Irish brogue is an improvement over some of the recent accents 
we've been subjected too).  In supporting roles, Sydney Poitier exudes 
more dignity than the film deserves, and Diane Venora is credible as a 
tough-as-nails MVD officer.  Mathilda May has a small role as an old 
flame of Mulqueen's who knows the secret of his connection to the 
Jackal.</P>
<P>     THE JACKAL starts strongly, but it doesn't take long for the film 
to devolve into a series of familiar formulas.  And, without a sense of 
mounting tension or at least a few interesting characters, the movie's 
trajectory propels us into a realm of burgeoning boredom.  Despite being 
30 minutes shorter than its 1973 inspiration, this incarnation feels 
three times as long.  When it comes to animals, THE JACKAL is just a dog 
in disguise.</P>
