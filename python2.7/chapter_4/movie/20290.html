<PRE>THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE</PRE>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten
 New Line Cinema 
 Director: Rand Ravich
 Writer:   Rand Ravich
 Cast: Johnny Depp, Charlize Theron, Nick Cassavetes, Blair
Brown, Joe Morton, Donna Murphy, Tom Noonan, Clea
DuVall</PRE>
<P>   My esteemed online colleague, Bryant Frazer, suggested
that this picture be called "Apollo 13 Meets Rosemarie's
Baby," which suggests that perhaps the reason New Line
Cinema chose not to screen the movie for critics is its belief
that the derivativeness would turn off reviewers.  You can find
in "The Astronaut's Wife" elements of "Rosemarie's Baby,"
but also some of "The Thing," "Species II," "The Brood,"
"Village of the Damned," and a host of other sci-fi thrillers. 
Since the picture avoids the usual schlock shockers like eels
crawling out of bellies and snakes from eyes, the picture
might suggest even "The Blair Witch Project."  After all,
except for a quick, understated flash of the usual
horror-genre special effects near the conclusion, "The
Astronaut's Wife" is free of shoddy visual disturbances.  </P>
<P>   Stylishly designed and photographed, the movie recalls
Robert Altman's "Ready to Wear," except that first-time
director Rand Ravich's piece gathers increasing momentum
as the story glides and then lurches toward its predictable
conclusion.  Like Altman's fashion statement, Ravich's movie
seems conceived as a showcase for one of Hollywood's
prettiest performers, Charlize Theron, in the title role.  With
her hair cut short to accentuate every aspect of her alluring
features, Theron becomes a veritable object of love for Allen
Daviau's camera.  And what a wardrobe has been set out for
her!  Theron's character, Jillian, dons dresses for all
occasions--black for formal wear when she is at a party of
her fabulously wealthy New York neighbors, a lovely
chocolate-brown turtleneck for more casual days around her
Washington Square digs.  Her ensemble cannot quite cover
up her emotional instability, however. While we in the
audience are always aware that something may have gone
terribly wrong with her marriage after her husband returns
from space, we can't help feeling that her psychological
condition merely reflects stress from her move to New York
and from her new experience with pregnancy.</P>
<P>   While "The Astronaut's Wife" focuses on Theron's
character, Jillian Armacost, Ravich's script provides ample
possibilities for Johnny Depp to play against type as a
straight, all-American space traveler who raises few
suspicions about his emotional stability for the major part of
the drama.  Depp plays an astronaut, Commander Spencer
Armacost, who travels on a shuttle mission with co-pilot Alex
Streck (Nick Cassavetes).  When the two-man crew loses
contact with mission control for two minutes, the ship is
brought swiftly back to earth, where Streck soon dies of a
heart attack and Armacost refuses to discuss the
phenomenon of the lost minutes in space.  When Jillian
becomes pregnant, she begins to suspect that her husband is
not the man she knows, but is afraid to reveal her suspicions
for fear they will be mistaken for the musings of a woman
undergoing hormonal changes.  </P>
<P>   The major part of the picture is paced slowly.  Ravich is
more interested in exposition than in punctuating the story
with crude shocks, trusting that the payoff will be all the more
dramatic when the situation heats up.  Since we're bound to
be a couple of steps ahead of Jillian, having perhaps seen
more sci-fi movies than she, the outcome is anticlimactic, and
what's more we're not entirely clear what a sinister, alien
force has in store for us human beings.  We can live with
these flaws given the stylish design that Ravich throws on the
proceedings, almost as though he had chosen to compete
with John McTiernan's  "The Thomas Crown Affair" for lavish
settings.  We get some good, satiric insight into the life of
New York society as the wife of an aerospace executive,
Shelly McLaren (Blair Brown), talks of fashion and the French
Caribbean, and as a guest at a company party finds better
things to do than to waste time with a second-grade teacher. 
Joe Morton doesn't fix any pinball machines this time around
but puts in a reliable performance as a NASA official who
goes half-crazy when he discovers some frightening
information, and Johnny Depp glides confidently through the
picture as the blond-haired hero with a trophy wife that he
genuinely adores.  </P>
