<P>   If sales of Deer Park, Poland Spring, Evian and 170 other
bottled water brands did not skyrocket after John Travolta's
heroic role in Steven Zaillian's "A Civil Action," they're not
likely to zoom this time around either--notwithstanding Steven
Soderbergh's frightfully similar tale, "Erin Brockovich." 
Soderbergh's story follows the outline of "A Civil Action" up
and down the line: the small-town lawyer who hocks
everything just before he is about to retire to Palm Beach,
even taking a second mortgage to pursue the big, evil
company; the heavily bankrolled legal team hired by a
billionaire corporate steamroller; the pollution which the
company knew about but did little to curtail; the illness and
death of both adults and children from a combination of
cancers including leukemia, and carcinomas of the ovaries
and breasts; the merely remote chance of winning anything
substantial.</P>
<P>   This time around the true story revolves not around the
Grace Company but about PG&E, or Pacific Gas and Electric,
with assets of $28 billion and an obstinacy about negotiating
anything close to the amount of money that could
compensate over 600 families afflicted by water poisoned
with chromium.  Why would the producers bank on a yarn so
similar to Zaillian's scarcely more than a year later?  Two
words: Julia Roberts--whose main assets are her big mouth
and, as one Internet critic puts it, her possession of a
wonderbra.  Travolta may know how to dance, but Julia has
the cleavage needed to bring in the crowds--particularly since
"Erin Brockovich" is a feel-good film with all the numbing
predictability movie-goers seem to demand.</P>
<P>    While this obvious little yarn sorely lacks irony, the one
paradoxical point is that so many Americans do not like or
trust lawyers and yet flock to the cinema for any adaptation of
John Grisham book, preferring plots highlighting small-town
Davids taking on big-city Goliaths.  We eschew the $400-an-
hour attorneys in their dark, pin-striped suits who haunt the
top floors of Wall Street offices or, on the other hand the
small-potatoes advocates who make their living chasing
ambulances.  But give us an avuncular counselor, preferably
getting on in years, who risks his entire retirement in a
gamble for justice, and we're suckered in--particularly if the
jokes are discreetly mixed with the poignancy and are sexual
in nature.  Throw in a few cute tykes and a romantic lover on
the side and you've got "Erin Brockovich."</P>
<P>   The title character (Julia Roberts) is at her wit's end,
bogged down with the care of three kids, her two husbands
having left her with $74 in her bank account (with which she
is able to afford rent, a car, and a dazzling array of
provocative outfits).  With no fancy degrees to her name and,
despite her looks, an inability to charm a series of potential
employers, she finagles a job as a research assistant to an
attorney, Ed Masry (Albert Finney).  By sheer coincidence,
her new neighbor, a biker named George (Aaron Eckhart), is
(by choice) unemployed and willing to take care of her kids
while she's in the legal office scraping out a living.  When
Erin comes across evidence that an epidemic of illnesses in
the town can be traced to the presence of chromium in the
water supply, she convinces her boss to take on the perps,
PG & E, despite the time, money, and energy needed to
pursue the case against an array of slick corporate lawyers. 
The hearings, the petitions, the meetings with the largely
unsophisticated and mistrusting townspeople are by now so
easy to follow by anyone who has ever been the movies that
there's scarcely a need to reveal the plot, nor would we risk
much by disclosing the final result of the litigation.  At least
John Grisham's stories, commercial though they may be, do
not end with unmitigated victories for the little guys who are
besieged and corrupted and made ill by the malefactors of
great wealth.</P>
<P>   Director Soderbergh is best known for "Out of Sight,"
considered quirky for a commercial movie in that it credibly
shows a romantic connection between two people on
opposite sides of the law.  But Soderbergh's real
achievement before becoming stridently commercial is his
1989 indie "sex, lies and videotape," blessed with real actors
like James Spader, Andie MacDowell and Peter Gallagher--in
which a selfish lawyer with a frigid wife and sister-in-law-lover
has an unpredictable effect on an old college friend who
comes up for a visit.</P>
<P>   If Soderbergh wanted to get serious with the true story of
the PG&E lawsuit, he would have used Cherry Jones in the
principal role of research assistant instead of shoving her into
the background as a reluctant witness who finally comes
around when she realizes how wonderful Ms. Brockovich is. 
I'd not be surprised to see our online colleagues on the World
Socialist Website take writers Susannah Grant and Richard
LaGravenese to task for reinforcing the idea that if you want
to succeed and make a fortune with just two years' hard
work, you'd better be gorgeous.  When asked by her boss
how she was able to get so many people to cooperate with
the plaintiff's cause, Erin replies, "It's called boobs, Ed." 
Absent the bosom and the thigh-length skirt, would this case
have ever made it out of the initial deposition stage?  Would
this movie not be shipped off to videotape after a quick run in
the theaters?</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 130 minutes.  (C) 2000
