<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Roman Polanski sets up a tense atmosphere for this macabre tale, where
every black-and-white shot is subjectively motivated by the deranged
character played with quiet brilliance by Catherine Deneuve, until the
final shot becomes one of objective reality.</P>
<P>Carol Ledoux (Deneuve) is from Belgium. She's a very attractive blonde
but a timid young soul, working in an upscale hairdresser' salon as a
manicurist, and is sharing a dreary flat in London's Kensington section
with her sexually liberated older sister Helen (Yvonne Furneaux). She
always seems depressed, repulsed by everything she comes across. She
looks repulsed at an elderly, wealthy salon customer getting a mudpack
who is spouting her cynical opinions of men, at eating a fish and chips
lunch, at seeing a would-be pushy boyfriend, Colin (Fraser), who tries
unsuccessfully to date her, and when she comes home, she is repulsed by
her sister's nervy boyfriend Michael (Ian Hendry). That evening, she
lies awake in her bed and is repulsed by her sister's intimate moans and
groans during lovemaking, which she hears from her adjoining bedroom.</P>
<P>Carol's world comes apart when her sister goes off on a holiday to Italy
with her boyfriend and leaves her alone in the apartment. She starts
hallucinating and having nightmares, which show her loneliness and
sexual repressions. She watches as cracks in the wall appear to widen,
hands come out of the wall groping her, and she imagines being raped.
Unable to get her mind in order, she appears unfit at work and is sent
home, and this is after three days of staying home from work without
calling in.</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoiler to follow.</PRE>
<P>When her would-be boyfriend goes into a rage that she wouldn't see him
or answer the phone, he breaks into her apartment and Carol responds to
his sexual advances by fatally bopping him over the head and dumping his
body in the bathtub. When the landlord (Patrick Wymark) comes by for the
late rent and then calls the flat a pig sty, observing the deteriorating
cooked rabbit carcass still uneaten on her dinner plate which is
attracting flies. Nevertheless, he finds himself attracted to her and
tells her if you look after me, you can forget the rent. She will also
brutally murder him when he makes a sexual advance towards her. The only
thing to be said in favor of these ghastly murders are that these men
were not nice and were extremely pushy, wanting to use her and not
caring that she didn't even show the slightest interest in them.</P>
<P>This is an austere and timeless Grand Guignol work, one with little
dialogue. This is the first of Roman Polansky's English language film's
and his second feature (the first was "Knife in the Water"-1962), and
this one might be his best work. It is eerie, unsettling and
intelligently created, showing Deneuve's emotional breakdown in an
impactful way, by showing it in psychological terms of deterioration and
not as a creation of special effects. This is a scary film, one of the
best in the world of horror films.</P>
