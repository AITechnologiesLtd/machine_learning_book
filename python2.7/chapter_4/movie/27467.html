<PRE>O Brother, Where Art Thou?
A film review by Michael Redman
Copyright 2001 by Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>After such a dismal year that "Castaway" is considered one of its best
films, the release of a Coen Brothers film is certainly cause for
celebration. Luckily for us, this one is near perfect.</P>
<P>No deep messages here, just a collection of hilarious episodes as Homer's
"Odyssey" is overlaid on a tale of a thirties prison break in the deep
south. Exactly what we need during the chilling gray days of January.</P>
<P>With a collection of actors including Holly Hunter, John Turturro, Charles
Durning and John Goodman, it's surprising that George Clooney emerges as the
stand-out. His comedic bits are masterful and his face so rubberized that at
times he appears to be an animated character. This could be Clooney's
break-out film.</P>
<P>There are so many surrealistic scenes (the Klan rally, the sirens, the
Soggybottom Boys and more) that you'll sit slack-jawed during the entire
film amazed that anyone would put these on the screen. And even more amazed
that they work so spectacularly.</P>
