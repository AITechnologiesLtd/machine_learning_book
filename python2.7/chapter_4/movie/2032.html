<PRE>                                 RISING SUN
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Culture clash and high-tech
     manipulation of reality are the themes that combine with a
     mediocre murder mystery in this adaptation of Michael
     Crichton's novel RISING SUN.  Much of the anti-Japanese and
     anti-Western-decline diatribe from the book are toned down
     for the film.  Rating: high 0 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     A party slogan from Orwell's 1984 said "who controls the past controls
the future and who controls the present controls the past."  RISING SUN is a
high-gloss technological murder mystery that, as everybody already knows, is
about xenophobia, xenophilia, and Japanese-American relations, but what is
getting less attention is that it is also about how electronic and computing
technology is changing what we think of as reality.  As portrayed in the
film, the Japanese are masters at the electronic manipulation of reality--an
art that gives them an immoral advantage over their American counterparts.
This, by the way, is an interesting reversal of the 17th Century Japanese
policy to suppress the Western technological advance of the gun which gave
its wielder what was considered by the Japanese an immoral advantage over a
swordsman.  Times have changed and tables have turned.</P>
<P>     In Los Angeles Web Smith, a liaison officer with the police department
(played by Wesley Snipes), is investigating a murder in a Japanese
corporation's skyscraper.  Assisting him as a guide is John Connor (played
by Sean Connery), a mysterious expert on Japanese culture.  An American
woman who was deeply into drugs and kinky sex is found dead, presumably
murdered, on a conference room table.  The police should have a big jump on
solving the case with four observation cameras trained on the room, but that
is electronic data in the hands of people who are masters of the
manipulation of data.  Also complicating the investigation is the amoral,
financially-motivated, chauvinistic presence of the Japanese business
executives.  This aspect is toned down from the novel, but it is still very
present in the film.  But also toned down is the aspect of the novel being
arguably as critical--or more so--of the cultural decline of the West as it
is of the Japanese.  Michael Crichton's book was intended as a wake-up call
to the American people.  Not surprisingly, that message has been completely
obliterated in the transition to film, along with a large proportion of what
was negative about the Japanese.</P>
<P>     What we have left here is an okay murder mystery revolving in large
part around technological elements.  It is then given Hollywood gloss with
high production values and a notable cast.  Sean Connery is, of course, Sean
Connery.  His performance is exactly what you would expect it to be.  In
this film he also has the title "executive producer."  Wesley Snipes is a
good actor who balances the cast racially but unless I am mistaken, it is
very unlikely that the LAPD would have a black in the diplomatic position of
liaison officer to the Japanese, who have a very low regard for blacks.
Also present is Harvey Keitel, certainly one of America's most highly
regarded character actors.  Japanese playboy Eddie Sakamura is played by
Cary-Hiroyaki Tagawa, somewhat familiar for having played an alien lifeform
in the crew of the short-lived television series SPACE RANGERS.  But for all
the gloss and high-tech hardware, the mystery just fails to be intriguing.
This is not a puzzle mystery where the clues are all in front of the
audience.  It is more a "follow the police and all will be revealed" sort of
mystery.  I would have to give it a high 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
