<P>"Dark City" is a very special movie. Published in 1998 it creates a very
interesting atmosphere by using many good ideas from different
sf-novels, -short-stories and -movies. For me it can be described best as a
mixture of Franz Kafka and Philip K. Dick. Maybe that's the main reason why
I like the movie that much.
The movie starts with the main character John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) lying
sleeping in a bath. Very soon he awakes and recognizes that he has lost his
memory. Neither can he remember who he is nor where. He gets to know that is
in a strange hotel and after a while he finds out that he is wanted for a
series of brutal and very bizarre murders. In panic he leaves the house to
find himself on the dark and cold street near a ringing telephone. He
answers the telephone and a man who introduces himself as Dr. Schreiber
(Kiefer Sutherland) tells him that something has gone wrong and that he has
to hide because "they" are searching for him and that they must not get him.
Although he flees the same moment "they" are able to find him shortly
afterwards. Being attacked by them he uses the ability to "tune" that means
to use a supernatural power which originally only "them" had. This power
allows him to make things happen while only thinking of them. He did not
knew that he had those power but now he has a weapon to defend himself. Of
course he tries to find out the following: Who am I ? Why do I have those
powers ? Why are "they" hunting me ?
In the further story he gets to know that he is the only human in the dark
city who has such powers and that these powers must be a result of the
failed experiment that "they" had done to him. What he also gets to know is
that the whole city is used by the aliens as a big labor to study human
behaviour. "They" are from a dying race which believe it's only chance to
survive is to find out what makes humans humane. To study the humans "they"
have brought some ten thousand of them to a synthetic city which drives
through space. From where they have been kidnapped no one knows. But on the
asteroid only the city exists there's nothing around it although all people
of the believe so. Only our main character realises that but he is always on
the run so that he can not be caught and he doesn't know how or if he can
change the things. "Shell-Beach", in the memories of many people of the town
a wonderful place, doesn't exist too. It is false as nearly all the peoples
memories are.
Every night at 12 o'clock the strangers stop all motion in the city and all
the human inhabitants fall asleep from one second to another. The strangers
then visit all humans sleeping and manipulate their memories with the help
of Dr. Schneider by injecting a special liquid directly into the people's
brains. Every portion of the liquid includes new memories which erases the
old ones. So when the people finally awake they are absolutely sure that
they are someone else, have another job and another personal history. The
strangers' work is perfect which means that "they" are not only changing the
people's memories but that they also change their environment. The whole
environment is changed in that way that it fits the people's new image of
themselves including photographs of their last holidays which have never
taken place but their wrong memory tells them that it has been and the
photographs or other things confirm their belief.
The strangers who are searching for the secret of humanity, for the "soul"
as they call it, have a collective conscience similar to the borg in "Star
Trek". While hunting John Murdoch everyone of them gets to know when and
where he is found by someone of the collective. But by using his
tuning-abilities he is always able to escape from them.
On his run step by step he finds out all the secrets of the dark city and of
their "owners". He discerns that "they" can not cope with sunlight and that
"they" hate every form of water. That is also the reason why there has never
been a day, never been a ray of light in the dark city. The whole town lives
in an endless night although the human inhabitants believe that they live a
"normal" live with day and night because of their synthetic memories.
During one of the nightly tuning-sessions John Murdoch meets Dr. Schneider
who tells him the whole story and promises to help him. "They" are finally
able to find him because one of "them" has been injected the same memories
he has and so he is able to think just like Murdoch. Threatening his "wife"
(also a false memory) Emma Murdoch (Jennifer Connely) they force him to give
up. Although he knows that she is not his real wife he loves her and to save
her he accepts to be captured. In "their" central "they" want Dr. Schneider
to let his spirit melt with "their" collective conscience but doc Schneider
injects him something else which makes him even more powerful. With the help
of those new powers he faces "their" leader in a final fight and as he wins
he is in the city's control. He frees the dark city and lets the sun shine,
in the end he creates shell-beach where he meets his "wife" again.</P>
<P>Although "Dark City" uses a lot of old ideas from Kafka, Dick, Star Trek and
many others it is able to create an own atmosphere and a very special dark
and mysterious mute. Maybe the single ideas aren't new but in this special
mixture they are ingenious. Many critics accused Alex Proyas, the author and
director of "Dark City", of having created a movie which looks really good
but which story isn't worth to talk about. They said that he has
concentrated himself too much on the visual effects and therefore has
forgotten the content. In my opinion it is true that the backgrounds of
"Dark City" are fabulous and that they can be best compared with "Blade
Runner" which is a real compliment for every movie. But I don't think that
Proyas has forgotten the content. Not only that the movie has a very intense
atmosphere it has also a story which in my eyes is worth to think and talk
about. The music fits the style and mute of the movie perfectly, it is dark,
mysterious and powerful. I can't remember who composed that music but
whoever it was he has done a really good job. Regarding the movie as whole
"Dark City" is in fact one of the best science-fiction movies ever, watch it
