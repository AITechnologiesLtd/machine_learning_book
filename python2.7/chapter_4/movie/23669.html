<P>`Erin Brockovich' is the first movie of 2000 that made me want to stand
up and exclaim `You go, girlfriend!' during showtime.</P>
<P>Hoping to keep my personal dignity intact, I waived that opportunity to
thoroughly embarrass myself, although I sensed the other theater patrons
would have supported my bombastic outburst. After all, the title
character of Steven Soderbergh's `Erin Brockovich' is such a smart,
sassy heroine. Although her manner is laced with brash, foul-mouthed
terminology and her wardrobe is indicative of a street-corner
prostitute, Erin generates an instantly likable presence of good looks
and quick wits. The twice-divorced mother of three shows admirable
persistence as she claws at accomplished lawyer Ed Masry (Albert
Finney), demanding a position at his law firm by attacking him like an
unleashed pitbull as opposed to kissing up. While in certain
circumstances it proves to be more of a distraction than a
reinforcement, a big name star like Julia Roberts seems to only further
the bolstering appeal of the snappy `Erin Brockovich'.</P>
<P>Roberts is certainly positioned at center-stage, delivering a powerhouse
performance that could be the definitive achievement of her career, but
she is backed by a beneficial slew of wonderful supporting performances.
An early prediction for the 2001 Oscar telecast: Albert Finney for Best
Supporting Actor. Erin first meets Masry after she is involved in an
auto collision and he is assigned to represent her. Unfortunately, even
though it was the fault of the other driver, Masry loses the case
because of Erin's feisty attitude and flagrant use of profanity.
Afterward (and I'm sidestepping some big complications), when Erin
begins working at the firm as a legal assistant, the interaction between
Roberts and Finney becomes some of the most fun and tractable I've ever
witnessed between two polar opposite characters. Finney (most recently
in `Simpatico') is such a joy to watch; as Masry slowly progresses to
the point of accepting and understanding Erin, we believe every ounce of
it. More enthusiasm should be directed to Aaron Eckhart as friendly
biker boyfriend George, who acts as nanny to Erin's three kids while she
discovers the demanding conditions of a business environment. The main
concentration of Susannah Grant's funny, observant screenplay is Erin
herself (a wise move given the compelling nature of the character), and
yet the film achieves measurable success on a collective level as well.</P>
<P>Did I mention this is all based on a true story? The accolades of the
real Erin Brockovich are unbeknownst to me (like many), but whether it
is entirely factual or not, Soderbergh's film visibly flounders only
during the opening minutes. The plot, involving Erin's investigation of
a possible hexavalent chromium contamination in the local water supply,
is strictly recycled Hollywood formula -- often bearing resemblance to
the 1998 legal thriller `A Civil Action' -- but the dramatics are
enhanced by the compelling human details, and a briskly enjoyable
character study only further motivated by top-flight performances.
Soderbergh's latest work includes the revenge thriller `The Limey' and
the comic crime caper `Out of Sight', but the director will be forever
known for the independent landmark `sex, lies and videotape'. Just as
Soderbergh revolutionized the Sundance Film Festival with `videotape' in
1989, he has breathed new life into the formulaic courtroom drama with
`Erin Brockovich'.</P>
<P>More likable magnetism comes from the fact that `Erin', at its core, is
a feel-good movie. The grin on your face will spread ear-to-ear as you
exit the theater, because the story of a little nobody striving to make
a big difference is always a crowd-pleasing antidote. It's all the more
acceptable in `Erin Brockovich', where the familiarities seem fresh and
involving because the characters entangled within the regular genre
clichés are not just boring, career-driven caricatures. It's nice to be
able to identify with Erin's plight, as she becomes torn between work
and family, than simply understand the verdict she is battling for in
court. Soderbergh puts little strain on the viewer in his journey to
help us encompass this fact. Let's hope `Erin Brockovich' isn't too
early an addition for possible Oscar attraction next year. If the
Academy members have forgotten the stellar performances and direction
that this film has to offer by then, I will weep for the filmmaking
community. Just as the title character conducts herself, `Erin
Brockovich' goes for the throat and wins you over.</P>
