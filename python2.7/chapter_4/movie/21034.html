<PRE>Ninja's Revenge
Owls' Castle</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Hopelessly underdressed at the premiere (shorts, ratty gymies and a neon
jacket), I couldn't easily blend into the sea of very well-dressed Japanese
celebs and esteemed guests. My father once told me "never be embarrassed by
what you're wearing," so I grinned and nodded and held my head high as if
they were the ones who'd attired far too needlessly.</P>
<P>The director (at the Academy's podium) opened his picture with a short
sentence, "Our Ninja are stronger than ...." I didn't quite get that last
word, though the point seemed obvious.</P>
<P>"Owls' Castle" saturates the white screen with rich color. The hues so
intense, you can almost taste them. The feel of the motion across the screen
suggests some medium other than film. Though, I have no inside information
on this, I suspect many of the sequences where partially or entirely filmed
on high quality digital tape. This is not at all a criticism. Digital cinema
is more or less inevitable, film stock being so expensive to purchase,
duplicate and distribute.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the feel, color and texture of the picture, where perhaps
it's most redeeming qualities. The plot ... a group of Ninja watch their
town get destroyed and ten years later seek revenge, is complicated a bit by
politics. The pace is needlessly slow, dragging the production over the two
hour mark. While the acting is strong and the main character (Ninja Juzo)
endearingly likeable, the relationships between the characters fall
secondary to cinematography which alone simply does not carry the
production.</P>
<P>Interestingly, Shinoda brings a kind of 1970's American Western feel to the
film with it's staleness and Japanese traditional music punctuated with a
20th century classical score. The beginning is enticing and the climax
nearly wonderful. I enjoyed the idea of the heartless Ninja, so committed to
mission that he's lost a sense of himself and cannot even love. However,
this concept is sorely underplayed, Juzo seldom seeming less than content --
 it's impossible to pity him.</P>
