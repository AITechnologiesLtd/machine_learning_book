<PRE>SIMON BIRCH
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        A cinematic version of one of John Irving's novels is always cause
for celebration even if, as in the case of "Simon Birch," the treatment is
merely "suggested by," rather than strictly based on, the book.</P>
<P>        Suggested means that Irving, author of the acclaimed "The World
According to Garp," sold the rights to his novel "A Prayer for Owen Meany"
to the Disney machine for $1 million, but wouldn't grant them permission to
use either the title or any of the character names.  That's an odd
decision--Irving claims it's to protect both himself and the novel--but
it's one that doesn't unduly harm the finished product.</P>
<P>        Irving's books are rich and complex works, full of intriguing,
colorful characters.  "A Prayer for Owen Meany" is no exception; it tells
the story of an unusual boy--called Simon Birch in the film version--who is
uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice,
"like strangled mice."  Simon believes himself to be "God's instrument,"
placed on this earth to somehow effect God's plan.</P>
<P>        Simon is played by Ian Michael Smith, who suffers from a rare
enzyme disorder known as Morquio Syndrome which, among other things,
prevents bones, ligaments, and joints from developing normally.  Smith's
debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for "Simon
Birch"; however, the producers unwisely favored form over function--Smith's
acting abilities are limited at best.</P>
<P>        Another drawback is that in the book, Simon's condition is
described the way Irving describes any of his characters--in careful,
loving detail.  Watching "Simon Birch," however, creates a different
feeling altogether; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship
with the character, surely something Irving would not have intended.</P>
<P>        Simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating, a combination of
Smith's rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he's forced
to deliver, courtesy Mark Steven Johnson, the film's director and
screenwriter.  Fortunately, Simon Birch isn't the real star of the film
that bears his name.  Simon is more of a catalyst, allowing his co-stars to
shape the story, and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding
supporting performances, saving the film from an obsequious, manipulative
destiny.</P>
<P>        First and foremost is Joseph Mazzello ("Jurassic Park"), who is
nothing less than remarkable as Simon's best friend, Joe.  Mazzello turns
in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old, ripe with laughter,
pain, and tears; he is certainly an emerging talent.  Ashley Judd
positively beams in her role as Rebecca, Joe's single mother, and Oliver
Platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend, Ben.  David Strathairn and Jan
Hooks play the town's reverend and Sunday school teacher respectively and
their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others.</P>
<P>        There's even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo
performance from...  Well, that would be telling.</P>
<P>        Perhaps "suggested by" the novel is the appropriate way to go after
all, since "Simon Birch" only focuses on one chapter, one year, of Simon's
extraordinary life.  The film also changes the book's ending to one that is
more melodramatic, yet necessary given Simon's lot.</P>
<P>        The flavor of Irving's original novel remains, however--the
passions, friendships, and insecurities that come with a change of seasons
to the little community of Gravestown, Maine, and the engaging oddballs,
both big and small, who reside there.</P>
