<PRE>Cruise Control
MI-2</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Remember MI-1? Tom Cruise hanging from the ceiling while performing all
sorts of spy operations? Yep, that's all I remember too. I wasn't crazy
about MI-1, and am feeling nearly the same about MI-2. Inversely, if you
liked the first, perhaps you'll enjoy the later.</P>
<P>I'm a big Cruise fan and willing to take the heat for it. He's a good actor
and looks great at the end of a string, or tumbling backwards while kicking
the bad guys in the face. In an MI-2 introductory scene, Cruise climbs Utah,
getting that red dirt under his nails. Woo does a fantastic job of putting
it all to the wall with aerial photography. This quietly huge moment is
boosted even higher via a screaming contrast with the previous airplane out
of control opening sequence. This is the scene I will remember from MI-2,
and Cruise doesn't even know his mission yet.</P>
<P>Ambrose (the biggest bad guy) gets a hold of the cure for the nastiest
man-made disease to date, all he needs is the actual virus to infect the
masses, shakedown the head of a pharmaceutical company, invest in the stock
market, then hand over the cure and badabing badaboom, he's a billionaire. A
simple enough plan were it not for Cruise's hand-picked spy team.
Professional thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), the beautiful key player in
his alliance, steals the affections of both Cruise and Ambrose, and that's
no coincidence.</P>
<P>Though, these spies handle the art of science well, there's little chemistry
between Cruise and Newton. However, in perhaps the first "romantic car
chase" ever to grace the screen, the two tango in the dust and gravel of
their spinning convertible sports cars, artistic and elegant - kudos again
to Woo.</P>
<P>And that's it. No major twists, aside from some very nicely simulated
cyber-face changing, but after the first face-lift ... well, you get the
idea.</P>
<P>The dialogue is routine, dipping at times to below average. You know, the
familiar, "Get him!" and "Put a sock in it!" and "Ha, you should have killed
me when you had the chance." Plus, the filmmakers made every effort to
repeat import information for us, dangling there on the edge of insulting.
In fact, the overall production feels like an artfully crafted episode of
the "A-Team." At age ten, I would have been ecstatic over it.</P>
<P>Most of the big action is big; though often popping wheelies into the
ridiculous - it's still fun. Unfortunately, the momentum stalls in-between,
while many presumptions just don't hold water.</P>
<P>Though at times he gets carried away, still true, Woo is cool. This mission
would have been next to impossible without him.</P>
