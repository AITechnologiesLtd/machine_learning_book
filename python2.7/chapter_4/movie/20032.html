A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Frank Oz</PRE>
<PRE>Written by Steve Martin</PRE>
<P>Starring: Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Heather Graham</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this comedy small-time moviemaker Bowfinger (Steve Martin) dreams of
creating his first movie but is locked out by the big entertainment
monopolies. One day Bowfinger is 49 years old and still hasn't accomplished
his dream, so he pulls out his live savings, grabs a B-movie script about
aliens taking over the world, assembles a no-pay crew of misfits, dreamers,
and illegal immigrants and takes the plunge. </P>
<P>When paranoid big-name action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) refuses to do
the film, Bowfinger hits upon a novel solution: to film Ramsey without his
knowing it and use a geeky double named Jiff (also played by Eddie Murphy)
to act the rest of the scenes. Will Bowfinger's alien film CHUBBY RAIN ever
make it out of production? </P>
<P>Opinion:
Amazing. What a great week for movies! Whether you see THE IRON GIANT,
DICK, DEEP BLUE SEA, THE SIXTH SENSE or BOWFINGER you can't lose. They're
all good.</P>
<P>Steve Martin is known by his fans as a comedian, but in this one Martin
plays the straight man while the comedy is left to Murphy and jibes at the
Hollywood moviemaking system. It works. Murphy is hilarious both as
paranoid star Kit Ramsey, who thinks he's seeing aliens in the corners of
his eyes, and as Jiff, the dimwitted video renter who must try to appear
like an action hero. </P>
<P>Heather Graham does a realistic job portraying an actress who can't act.
Federal Express, and Starbucks also make noticeable appearances. </P>
<P>BOWFINGER is funny. Whimsical, yes, but get ready to chuckle your socks off
and smile for a good 90 minutes. </P>
