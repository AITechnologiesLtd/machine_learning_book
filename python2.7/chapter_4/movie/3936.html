<PRE>                                NINE MONTHS
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     NINE MONTHS is certainly the longest pregnancy I have ever
experienced.  It is a very silly movie.  Whether it is also funny will
depend on you.</P>
<P>     Pregnant Becca (Julianne Moore) is stranded in the current
stereotype of the young woman who lives with a man she loves in an
arrangement that includes hard work and fun, but not marriage or, God
forbid, children.  Why would the "he" of this movie want responsibility
or commitment when the woman of his dreams is already in his bed, and a
red Porsche and San Francisco Bay are immediately outside the window of
his perfect apartment?</P>
<P>     When Becca decides her clock is ticking, she has a tough
conversion on her hands in the person of her lover, Samuel, who is
played--dare I say the words--by Hugh Grant.  For one hour and
forty-two minutes we watch Hugh pout, growl, and overact.  It would be
nice to think he is trying to lift the movie upward, but it is remotely
possible that he thinks the audience just can't get enough of him.  So
overdone is his mugging that the pregnant woman becomes the movie's
brightest spot.  Actress Julianne Moore is a very appealing actress and
has all the right reactions to the ludicrous chaos that surrounds her.</P>
<P>     On their first visit to the delivering O.B., Becca and Samuel run
smack into Dr.  Kosevich (Robin Williams), a newly arrived Russian
veterinarian who has recently decided to switch his specialty to
babies.  Williams causes a lot of spontaneous laughter with his
malapropisms.  He calls for "Anastasia" to anesthetize and discusses
Becca's "Volvo" with gentle discretion.</P>
<P>     Williams is very funny here, but he carries the rest of the cast
straight into the familiar spectacle of Americans falling from farce to
slapstick whenever they try a British specialty.  The whole silly thing
dissolves finally into a hospital scene full of enough fuzzy love to
please Newt and the whole of America's heartland.  This might have been
a romantic comedy or a zany farce, but no one made the choice, so we
have a little of everything and a whole lot of nothing.</P>
<P>     And then there's the "incident."  Although there can't be many
Americans who would be shocked by a celebrity indulging in one-stop
shopping, it may not be what people most want from the charming,
awkward bumbler they had come to love in FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.
The box office will tell whether the laughter that rocks the theater at
the sight of his face is derisive or affectionate.  It hardly matters;
the movie is still a bust.</P>
<P>     Let's not blame the whole thing on Hugh Grant.  Writer/director
Chris Columbus has the distinction of creating three of the most
intolerable movies ever made: MRS. DOUBTFIRE and those violent assaults
on sensibility, the HOME ALONEs.  NINE MONTHS is not as excruciatingly
bad as the others.  Let's assume Columbus is in a lull.</P>
