                                 Snake Eyes

<P>        Paul Thomas Anderson's "Boogie Nights" wow-ed the critics last
year, and rightfully so: the film's frank portrayl of the pornographic
industry/drug culture of the late seventies was highlighted by a great
script, virtuoso acting, and some of the most innovative cinematography
ever seen in a low-budget film.  Virtually every review mentioned its
incredible opening shot, in which a "God's-eye-view" camera swoops down
from the sky, pans over the exterior of a popular night-club, then drifts
inside.  We then "walk" through the club, meeting our primary characters
as we dodge the dancers and waitresses.  This description may not sound
terribly impressive, but look closely: the shot was filmed in ONE
continuous four-minute take, with no cuts or edits.  The effect is
subtle, but it effectively draws us into the twisted world of the movie
by removing the cinematic devices (including edits) that tend to distance
audiences from the action.
        Director Brian De Palma, probably best-known for his famous film
adaptation of Stephen King's "Carrie," does Anderson one better with his
new movie "Snake Eyes."  In the opening scene, we meet Rick Santoro
(Nicholas Cage), a New Jersey police officer in charge of security at a
championship boxing match.  We follow Cage as he places a bet on the
match, fights a criminal, chats with both his wife and his mistress on
the telephone, hangs out with his best friend Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise),
notices two suspicious women, watches the fight... and witnesses
a murder.  That's a lot to absorb in the opening scenes of ANY movie,
but get this: De Palma shoots it all in a single unbroken take, lasting
nearly twenty minutes!  It's a flawless performance from all involved, and
the actors never falter as the camera works its magic.  No matter what the
critics may think of the movie, this scene is going to get attention.
        The murder victim is an influential politician, heavily involved
with a secret government project (is there any other kind?) designed to
produce a new type of missile.  Santoro knows two things: other people
will die if the killer is not apprehended, and if he doesn't get to the
bottom of the case before the FBI arrives, his friend Dunne (who was away
from his post at the time the shooting occurred, violating the orders that
he'd received) may be blamed for the murder.  A tropical storm will
prevent the arrival of the FBI for ninety minutes, and the two men begin
their investigation.  The exits to the arena are sealed, and 14,000
people, one of whom is a killer, watch and wait.
        The film uses a creative technique to get us involved in the
mystery: we, the audience, never witness certain important events (such
as the boxing match, which contains an important clue) for ourselves.
Instead, we must rely on the recollections of the various characters, who
disagree with each other as often as not.  What really happened?  Who's
right?  This is the mystery that Santoro (and we) must find out.
        One of the many wonderful touches in this film is the passage of
time: one minute of screen-time equals one-minute of real time, so when
Santoro announces that they have ninety minutes to solve the crime, you
can set your watch by his word.  The film's attention to detail does not
rest there: one of our characters has very poor eyesight, and when she
loses her glasses early in the film, her subsequent scenes are shot out
of focus, giving us a window into her confusion.  The intelligence of the
movie is clearly shown via shots like this; De Palma clearly is a master
of drawing an audience into his world, something he demonstrated equally
well in "Carrie."  Our characters are consistently interesting, their
urgency is communicated, and the air of mystery is so high that when one
of our characters turns out to be something other then he/she initally
appears, we simply accept it.  We're too lost in this world to argue.
        Although we're not privy to everything, De Palma does allow us
access to certain information that the onscreen characters don't have.
In one scene, Sinise's character stands outside of a door, listening,
trying to decipher what he's hearing on the other side.  De Palma does
not leave us in suspense, though: the camera, initially behind Sinise,
rises, hovers over him, then gives us a peek over the wall and into the
room beyond.
        Another effective shot occurs later in the film, in which Cage's
character compares notes on the shooting with one of the "suspicious
females" he saw at the outset.  We get a "split-screen" display, in which
Cage's memory of the shooting is displayed in the left half, and the
woman's in the right.  They run tangent, in perfect synch, with only very
slight differences which reflect their own conflicting memories.  The
scene is brilliantly edited, and offers new insight into the crime.
Stylistic touches such as these make it impossible not to get drawn in.
        Sadly, it all comes undone in the film's final moments.  A major
plot problem: a murder has been committed, and the staff of the arena
knows that the police want to see all the security tapes that were shot
during the fight.  All of them are viewed, but the information they need
is not there.  Then, towards the end of the movie, an employee suddenly
remembers that he just installed a NEW, SECRET security camera that
very morning!  Sheesh, how do you forget about something like that?
        But the film's biggest offense is the final confrontation between
Cage and the villain.  It's an absolute joke: the outcome is decided not
by the chess-like strategy that the story has shown us thusfar, but by
dumb luck: imagine if, in the final lightsaber battle between Vader and
Luke in "The Empire Strikes Back," a giant asteroid had appeared from
nowhere, crashed through Cloud City, and knocked Vader down the exhaust
shaft.  That's the same ballpark as the plot-twist used to resolve "Snake
Eyes."  After being riveted by the movie up until this point, it was
impossible not to feel a bit cheated.  Pardon my crassness, but if this
film were a woman, she'd make out with you for two hours, rip off all
your clothes, then suddenly announce that she has to leave.  Sure, it's
fun at the time, but ultimately unsatisfying.
        Nonetheless, there's much to like about "Snake Eyes."  I'll
probably see it at least once more, if only for the flawless opening
scene and the other stylistic touches that typically mark De Palma's work.
I doubt I'll stay for the final fifteen minutes again, though.</P>
