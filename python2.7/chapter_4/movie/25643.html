<P>A boy dinosaur is raised by monkey-like creatures and takes on their 
charming, playful personality. When
the dino and his family find themselves struggling for survival with a pack 
of dinosaurs the film turns into a
preachy debate over Darwinian philosophies. </P>
<P>Parents, don't be fooled, this isn't "Toy Story" with dinosaurs, it's pretty 
much a soap opera and a horror
movie meant for children. Since there's dinosaurs you know there's going to 
be the friendly, cute ones we
love versus the huge, ugly, scary monsters that make a lot of noise and want 
to eat our heroes. At least that
would be original, which is more than I can say for the script which is so 
lame and boring it just keeps
wandering for most of the film without much characterization or point. The 
battle scenes are pretty intense
and will probably scare younger children. </P>
