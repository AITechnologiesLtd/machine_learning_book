<P>     I like Steve Buscemi.  I really do, which is why it's such an
disagreeable task to write a review that condemns his directorial debut
as a waste of film.  I'm not talking about a good idea gone awry, I'm
referring to something that's rotten to the core.  If I hadn't been
preparing to write a review, I would have walked out on this one.  It's
a pointless, lackluster, unpleasant character study of a bunch of
pointless, lackluster, unpleasant people who sit around a bar all day. 
Imagine CHEERS with all the comedy and life drained away and you'll have
an idea what TREES LOUNGE is like.</P>
<P>     Buscemi has starred for some of the best young talent in
independent cinema: Quentin Tarantino (RESERVOIR DOGS), the Coen
Brothers (FARGO), and Tom DiCillo (LIVING IN OBLIVION).  Apparently, he
wasn't paying attention to their methods of direction, however, because
nothing appears to have rubbed off.  TREES LOUNGE, despite its nods to
John Cassavetes, is stillborn.  I find it somewhat astonishing that
Buscemi managed to round up such a respectable cast (which includes
cameos by the likes of Michael Imperioli, Seymour Cassel, and Samuel L.
Jackson) and secure a distributor. </P>
<P>     Supporters of this film will undoubtedly claim that it's an
examination of a middle-aged man going nowhere -- a portrait of the
wasted life of a rootless individual.  I can't argue with that, but I'm
not sure what the point is of putting the audience through such a
shallow and tiresome account.  It's not interesting.  It's not
entertaining. There are some attempts at humor, but, for the most part,
they don't work.  It's one thing to have a slow moving story with a
compelling character.  It's quite another to have the situation that
exists here:  a nonexistent plot about a man who means nothing to us.</P>
<P>     We meet Tommy (Buscemi) in a suburban New York City bar called
Trees Lounge, watch him hit on the bartender (Carol Kane), and see him
pal it up with another regular (Mark Boone Junior).  A little later, he
goes and stands outside the garage where he used to work as a mechanic. 
His  former boss, Rob (Anthony LaPaglia), accosts him, and the two
almost come to blows before Tommy's pregnant ex-girlfriend (Elizabeth
Bracco), who is Rob's current squeeze, breaks it up.  So Tommy goes back
to the bar, tries to snort some cocaine (it's a running gag that
something always comes up to prevent him from doing the drug), fails in
an attempt to pick up a girl, then ends up in bed alone.  And so it
goes=85</P>
<P>     For a few minutes, just past the midpoint, the movie turns
interesting.  Tommy becomes romantically involved with his ex-
girlfriend's seventeen year old niece, Debbie (Chloe Sevigny, from
KIDS).  She's the only worthwhile character in this whole mess, but her
predictable relationship with Tommy is never well-developed, and we're
left wondering whether they slept together or just "made out like a
couple of teenagers".  The resolution of this situation, like almost
everything else in TREES LOUNGE, is dissatisfying.  Debbie's father runs
after Tommy with a baseball bat.  If you want to see a thoughtful
examination of an older man/young girl relationship, check out Dennis
Hopper and Amy Locane in CARRIED AWAY.  That film shows how clumsily
Buscemi handles similar material.</P>
<P>     There's more that I could say about TREES LOUNGE, but my words
would be nasty and repetitious, so why bother?  As it is, I've wasted
more time and ink on the movie than it's worth.  I hate to be so
negative, but better luck next time, Steve.  This one's a real dud.</P>
