<PRE>HE GOT GAME
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Spike Lee tackles the subject of basketball in his new movie, He Got
Game. However, this isn't your traditional basketball movie (in fact,
aside from short clips, the game is only played once during the movie).
Instead, the film works best as a relationship drama...detailing the
estrangement between father and son.</P>
<P>Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington) has been imprisoned for the last
six years, when the warden (Ned Beatty) offers him a deal which could
grant him a pardon.  It seems that Jake's son, appropriately named Jesus
(Ray Allen), has become the country's top basketball prospect.  If Jake
can convince Jesus to enroll in the governor's alma mater, Big State,
the governor might find it in his heart to cut Jake's time in prison
short.</P>
<P>The problem is Jake and Jesus haven't been on talking terms since Jake
killed Jesus' mother.  Jesus has raised himself and his sister Mary
(Zelda Harris), and wants nothing further to do with his father.  Jake
has one week to reconcile with his son before the NCAA deadline...and it
won't be an easy task.</P>
<P>With the deadline looming, everyone wants a piece of Jesus.  His family,
his coach, his schoolmates, and even his girlfriend all have angles, and
there's seemingly no one that Jesus can trust.  It's not a good time for
a reconciliation.</P>
<P>The pressures of basketball have been explored several times before, but
He Got Game does an adequate job at showing the temptations and dangers
involved.  However the more interesting story here is the family
relationship between father and son.</P>
<P>But the film is easily sidetracked, offering up plenty of boring
subplots that add little to the story.  As a prime example, take Jake's
romantic involvement with Dakota (Milla Jovovich), a hooker with a heart
of gold. What does this add to the movie?  Another stereotypical
character and an unexploited chance for Denzel's acting skills (which
could have been put to better use by furthering the story).</P>
<P>Denzel Washington delivers the strong performance he is known for, but
the wildcard in the movie is Ray Allen.  He performs better than your
typical athlete-turned-actor, but (a fact which is particularly obvious
when he's paired up with someone of Denzel's caliber) his talents truly
reside on the court rather than the set.  Spike Lee would have done his
movie a favor if he hired an actor rather than an athlete.</P>
<P>The central plot of He Got Game, however, is still compelling enough to
recommend the movie purely on its own merits.  As a Spike Lee movie it
is a little disappointing.  It's not among his best work, but neither is
it down among his worst.</P>
