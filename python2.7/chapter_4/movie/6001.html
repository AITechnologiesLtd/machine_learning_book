<PRE>                                FOUR ROOMS
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) *1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Four stars for FOUR ROOMS? Not quite. This one was 
lucky to scrape up the paltry one-and-a-half star rating it got. An 
interesting concept was drug into the ground by an aimless script 
and annoying lead actor. Tim "Pumpkin" Roth plays an idiotic 
English bellboy trying to run a hotel by himself on New Year's 
Eve. Four hot young directors (Quentin Tarantino, Robert 
Rodriguez, Allison Anders and Alexandre Rockwell) each wrote 
and directed a segment of the movie, none of which ever rise 
above the level of mediocre and two of which are completely 
beyond redemption.</P>
<P>        The first, Anders' "The Missing Ingredient," is one of 
those. Madonna is a witch who wants sperm... I know you're all 
thinking, "Yeah, I know that, but what part does she play in the 
movie?" and to that I have to say shame on you. She and the rest 
of her coven meet in one of the hotel rooms to mix a witch's brew, 
with one pivotal ingredient missing -- the aforementioned life juice 
of a man. So one of the witches has sex with Roth. End of segment. 
The whole thing is pointless and unentertaining, with Madonna 
and the sexy Valeria Golino standing around, their talents 
unused.</P>
<P>        Then comes the equally-bad "The Wrong Man," directed 
by Rockwell. This time Roth is the wrong man entering the wrong 
room at the wrong time in the wrong movie. Some guy has his wife 
tied to a chair, and goes from thinking Roth slept with his wife to 
kissing Roth full on the mouth, which has to be the absolute low 
point of the movie. It doesn't elevate itself too much more when 
Roth tries to escape and ends up stuck in the bathroom window, 
pleading the drunk man on the next floor up for help. The man 
vomits on his face, physical comedy at its finest.</P>
<P>        The third segment, Rodriguez's "The Misbehavors," is 
the best of the movie, which definitely isn't a distinction to brag 
about. Roth is paid to look after the mischevious children of a 
Mexican gangster and his Asian-American wife. The second Roth 
leaves the room, they break open the champagne, watch adult 
movies, throw hypodermic needles at the painting on the wall and 
unearth a dead body hidden in the mattress springs. By the time 
the parents return, all hell has broken loose, although Rodriguez 
never shows how Roth escapes the gangster's wrath.</P>
<P>        He instead cuts to a phone conversation Roth has with 
a stoned Marisa Tomei, in which he threatens to walk off the job 
but finally agrees to take some food up to the visiting Hollywood 
star in the penthouse. Begin the final segment of FOUR ROOMS, 
"The Man From Hollywood." This is Tarantino's segment and he 
of course plays the man from Hollywood, who shows Roth around 
the room before offering him money to officiate a bet that he and 
his drunken friends (one of which is an uncredited Bruce Willis) 
have made. It's interesting but incredibly slow-moving except for 
the ending, which is resolved in the five seconds before the credits 
roll. Even Tarantino can't do much justice to a fallen movie that has 
goes nowhere in ninety minutes and is only slightly entertaining 
during its final half.</P>
