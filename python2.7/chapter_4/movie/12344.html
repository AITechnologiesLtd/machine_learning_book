<P>Uggh, tabloid t.v.  Catering to the lowest common denominator.  That's
nothing new.  Before the trashy antics of these sleaze profiteers there
were other, more innocuous attempts to get people hooked on boob tube
entertainment of a low class nature.  'The Gong Show' perhaps?  The
'Unknown Comic', 'Gene, Gene, the dancing machine' and that curly haired
host were all bad enough but 20 years ago who would have thought that
during a television talk show, fights would break out.  Now it seems
that during fights on these shows, audiences keep waiting for a talk
show to break out.  When Geraldo had his nose broken some years ago,
many thought that sort of thing was the exception rather than the rule
and while few people get injured on these shows, at least what the
audience sees first hand, I truly believe that these scenarios are
REAL!  Perhaps not all the time, but surely the famous incident
involving the murder of a young man by another man as an alleged result
of appearing on one of these shows, makes you wonder how much is staged
and how much is indeed real.  In case you don't know what I'm talking
about, there was an incident a couple of years ago where a certain trash
talk show had people on stage waiting to meet their secret admirers.
Each person greeted a member of the opposite sex except one, a man, who
had another man admit he had a crush on him, causing him great
embarrassment.  You can guess the rest.</P>
<P>In 1976, when the film 'Network' came out, it was about a fourth place
network, UBS, and ABC, NBC, and CBS all finishing ahead of it in the
ratings each week.  Desperate to get ratings and offset huge annual
financial losses, they luck into something.  A washed up television
anchor man named Howard Beale (Peter Finch, in his Oscar winning role as
Best Actor), has his employment terminated because of low ratings and
announces during a live broadcast that he will commit suicide on live
television in the near future before he leaves for good.  Causing panic
among the executives watching, they remove him by force and after some
thought, Beale convinces another executive and his best friend, Max
Schumacher (William Holden), to put him back on to rectify the
embarrassing statement.  Given this opportunity, he causes more
embarrassment for the network by using the word "bull****" and the
ratings jump 5 points during that broadcast.  Taking advantage of this
situation, a ruthless female executive named Diana Christensen (Faye
Dunaway in her Oscar winning role as Best Actress), convinces her boss
in charge of programming, Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) to put Howard
Beale back on the air and keep him on despite the irresponsible nature
of his content and the shocking nature of his messages.  He agrees and
thus 'The Howard Beale Show' is born.  He is described and an 'angry
prophet, denouncing the hypocrisies of our time'.  His show influences
the network to include other tabloid segments and this shocking new
brand of television causes a fury among angry broadcast regulators and
government officials who want the show stopped.</P>
<P>Screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, who won his third Oscar for the scathing
script of 'Network' was a true genius way ahead of his time.  He
predicted back then that television standards would get lower and lower
and they most definitely have.  In addition to tabloid talk shows,
people have to contend with sitcoms that all look the same, recycled
from ideas of the past without a clue in proper execution or hint of
original thought.  '3rd Rock from the Sun'/'Mork and Mindy',
'Frasier'/'Cheers'.  Even highly charged dramas such as 'ER' and 'NYPD
Blue' bring up memories of 'St. Elsewhere' and 'Hill Street Blues'.
Chayefsky's observations of television programming are not cynical, just
the thoughts of a realist.  For all of you doubting Thomas' out there,
ask yourself why many shows debut in the fall while only two or three
survive after the first year.</P>
<P>Misery loves company and the high ratings enjoyed by tabloid trash
television shows are in large part, a  reflection of people with similar
lives.</P>
<P>Nominated for 10 Oscars in 1976, including Best Picture and Best
Director (Sidney Lumet), 'Network', as I mentioned, won Best Actor and
Actress Oscars for Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway.  Finch died before the
awards were given out and received his award posthumously.  In addition
to the acting awards won by Finch and Dunaway, Beatrice Straight won the
Best Supporting Actress Oscar as Max Schumacher's tortured wife living
with the reality that her husband is in love with and is having an
affair with another woman.  Straight's performance is an example of why
the Supporting acting categories were created.  She only appears in a
couple of scenes but they are brimming with talent and a convincing
portrayal of her character.  The most unique performance in 'Network'
comes from Ned Beatty who plays the top executive in the television
company who delivers his philosophy of the corporate world like a
television evangelist.  He received a Best Supporting Actor nomination
and finally, William Holden was nominated along side Finch for Best
Actor.  Not many films get the distinction of having five cast members
nominated for Oscars, and as of 1997, 'Network' and 1951's 'A Streetcar
Named Desire' remain the only two films to receive three Academy Awards
for acting.</P>
