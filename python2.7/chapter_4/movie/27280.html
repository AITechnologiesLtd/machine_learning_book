<P>   Robert Zemeckis' "Cast Away" explores what happens one
an individual is trapped and isolated with nothing but a
volleyball for a companion. Alfred Hitchcock's "Lifeboat"
reveals what happens when shipwreck survivors are adrift in
a lonely lifeboat during World War II, trapped not only with
their compatriots with a Nazi whom they take on board.
Kristian Levring's "The King is Alive" joins the many films that
explore what happens when people are trapped, either alone
or together, for extended periods of time.  This type of setting
is the essence of theater: put a few people in a room
separate from the rest of society and watch the fireworks. 
What happens?  What do you expect!  All sophisticated film
buffs realize that civilization is but a gossamer tapestry which
could unravel under trying circumstances.  Trap any group of
people together for an extended and life-threatening period,
whether they'd known one another or are strangers.  Watch
them tear one another apart, giving vent to their bottled
resentments, frustrations, angers, and feelings of self-pity.</P>
<P>   Kristian Levring gives his view of such an event in a
theatrical piece co-written by Anders Thomas Jensen, adding
emphasis by sticking to the Dogme 95 manifesto.  Levring
strips away not just his characters' veneer of civilization: he
pares down all pretensions of fancy cinematography to focus
exclusively on the bare bones of story.  Using some
improvisations of his talented and experienced actors
together with the screenplay, Levring knocks out what could
be called an intellectual horror story which unfortunately could
remind us of the ghastly hit, "The Blair Witch Project," both in
the dizzying use of handheld cameras and the unresolved
conclusion of the tale.  The skills of such major performers as
Bruce Davison, Janet McTeer, Romane Bohringer and
Jennifer Jason Leigh are not exactly wasted, but because of
the predictability and repetitive nature of the story, our own
patience is challenged and we in the audience summon up
our own belligerence toward the work on the screen.</P>
<P>   Filmed on location in the deserted southwest African
mining town of Kolmanskop, Namibia, "The King is Alive"
takes us on a small busload of people of mixed nationalities
on a desert safari that goes awry when the electronic
compass is find defective and the vehicle veers hundreds of
miles from the beaten path.  After Jack (Miles Anderson), an
Australian confers with an aging African who watches all
(Peter Khubeke), he decides to walk off alone for help letting
the others know that he expects to be back within five days. 
As the anxiety-ridden vacationers wonder whether this will be
their last trip, a former actor and writer Henry (David Bradley)
copies "King Lear" from memory onto rolls of paper to distract
the group from their plight.  As Ashley (Brion James, who
died a month after the completion of the film), Catherine
(Romane Bohringer), Ray (Bruce Davison), Charles (David
Calder), Gina (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Liz (Janet McTeer) and
bus driver Moses (Vusi Huhene) rehearse their parts, the
women tend to keep their control as though figures from a
Lina Wertmuller movie while some of the men become
emotionally (as well as physically) devastated by what
transpires--particularly by the ways that the women release
pent-up venom against them.</P>
<P>   As we were leaving the screening, one member of the
audience commented, "Isn't it something how a single actor,
Tom Hanks, could hold and audience for about hour as the
sole performer on the big screen in 'Cast Away?'  And how
this accomplished band of thesps in "The King is Alive" are
mired in the sand by a script that simply travels in circles--like
lost, compass-less voyagers who run through a one hundred
ten minutes' story as though it were a twenty-minutes'
journey five-and-one-half times told?</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 100 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
