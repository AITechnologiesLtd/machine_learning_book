                       A film review by Michael Stoneheel
                        Copyright 1993 Michael Stoneheel</PRE>
<P>     Many Western fans consider this genre to be a cinema par
excellance, while other persons claim that only a few Westerns are good
films.  UNFORGIVEN is a perfect opportunity to confront this issue.  It
seems to me that this film is about the Western myth, but what is that
myth?</P>
<P>     It is the myth of open landscapes and wide spaces, a hero on his
horse, the good prostitute and the pure virgin, the progress against the
primitive, and the use of Christian values.  But most of all, it is the 
myth of the border between good and evil (usually the good hero is a 
reformed criminal, that could hardly be considered pure--like John
Wayne in STAGECOACH) which resolves in a conflict between individual 
morality and the law.</P>
<P>     Does Clint Eastwood follow this pattern?  Certainly yes!  The
landscapes are as wide as ever, the hero is a reformed not in shape
gunfighter (this is almost a cliche), the good guys act to restore the
dignity of a prostitute, the only way to solve problems is by lynching
and at the end we have a spectacle duel between the hero and the evil.</P>
<P>     Actually, we could not have been more wrong.  It seems that Clint
Eastwood tried to break the myth from every possible angle.  The abuse
of a woman is very rare in Westerns and it is more likely to be done by
Indians.  All the good gunfighters are being humiliated during the film
(either they cannot shot or cannot ride on their horses).  Can anyone
imagine a film in which John Wayne would be bitten by someone without
responding?</P>
<P>     From the narrative perspective, some things are worth to be pointed
out.  The tremendous use of closeups and the photographing of the hero's
face during a gunfight are against the principles of the old Western in
which everything was done to increase the myth.  Another way that
Eastwood use to break the myth is by making the Western more realistic
(the curses, showing scars and wounds, the way sex is treated and the
realistic killing).</P>
<P>     One may presume that Eastwood was trying to define the limits of
the myth.  If such a claim is correct than the limits could be pushed
even further.  The cause for the struggle could be less moral, the
sheriff could be more (or less) cruel, and the stereotype of the hero
could be less conventional.  At the end of the film the myth is as valid
as ever (not only for the spectator but also for everybody in the
film).  Could it be shattered?</P>
<P>     If Gene Hackman (or someone from the town) had made the score even,
the answer would have been probably yes.  Not only would such an act
break the myth, but it would shutter a much more important thing, the
myth of Clint Eastwood, the actor.  In fact, Eastwood has demonstrated
that even if he looks ugly, being humiliated, has a dubious sense of
morality, the myth of him as a super hero actor is greater than ever.
It is quite impressive, but should we admire him for it?</P>
<P>     Actually, the myth of the hero is being finally realized in the
duel scene.  Eastwood has found the primer component in the aesthetics
of the struggle, namely, the sympathy and admiration for the weak
against the strong, for the few against the numerous and for the
individual against everybody else.  The result is a transformation of
the conflict between the individual and the society from the moral
level to a struggle dealing with action.  Are all the ideas, stated so
far, sufficient for explaining the evolution of the myth?</P>
<P>     One must admit that the myth exists inside of us from the first
moment we lay our eyes on the screen.  To understand it profoundly, one
should see classic Westerns like STAGECOACH, SHANE, RED RIVER, THE MAN
WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE etc., but even by watching BONANZA much of the
myth is becoming a part of the viewer.  If many years ago the myth was
a benefit for the Western, at some stage the overloaded self concern
with it became an artistic obstacle.  When discarding the exhausted
self concern with the myth, there is no form of expression and not much
is left.  I'm not saying that there aren't Westerns which are great
films.  Usually, such films are being consisted of more aspects.</P>
<P>     Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN is probably the best Western created in the
last ten years, nothing less and nothing more.</P>
