<P>     The first thing I thought of when I heard the title of this film 
was a line from THE GODFATHER:  "Luca Brasi sleeps with the fish."  
(Translation: Luca's dead.)  Granted, sleeping isn't the same thing as 
dreaming, but it's close enough.  However, although DREAM WITH THE 
FISHES deals with death and dying, those are just vehicles for other 
themes:  the difficulty of communicating in today's world and the fear 
of living.  </P>
<P>     It could be argued (fairly successfully, I think) that DREAM WITH 
THE FISHES doesn't do enough with its subject matter.  But, while it's 
true that there's a wealth of untapped material here, what is on screen 
is handled with the necessary aptitude to captivate an audience.  
Because the dialogue has a tendency to be trite, the characters are 
spottily-developed, and the acting is variable, DREAM WITH THE FISHES is 
not a great film.  Nevertheless, it is a good film, and it's hard to 
deny the simple power of the climax.  </P>
<P>     The movie opens in a strange fashion, with images of a man using a 
pair of binoculars to gaze through neighboring windows.  Moments later, 
the watcher, a reserved guy named Terry (David Arquette), and one of his 
objects, Nick (Brad Hunt), pass each other in a convenience store.  
Terry buys a bottle of booze that he takes with him to a nearby bridge, 
where he silently debates the virtues of jumping.  Nick, who has 
followed Terry, offers an alternative:  he'll trade a bottle of sleeping 
pills for Terry's watch.  But is Terry really ready to die?  Nick, on 
the other hand, doesn't have a choice in the matter.  He has a terminal 
disease and the doctors give him only a month to live.  So, rather than 
spending his last weeks in a hospital or with his concerned fiancee, Liz 
(Kathryn Erbe), Nick makes a pact with Terry and the two of them go on 
the road together, trying to determine which of them is better off:  a 
dying man who wants to live or a living man who wants to die. </P>
<P>     First time director Finn Taylor successfully avoids the pitfall of 
skidding into melodrama.  DREAM WITH THE FISHES never goes for a 
"heartwrenching" payoff.  The characters are presented on their own 
terms, and they don't lose their abrasive sides simply to make us more 
comfortable with them.  The director also doesn't opt for the "arm's 
length" perspective -- we may not find either Terry or Nick appealing, 
but that doesn't prevent us from empathizing with them.  DREAM WITH THE 
FISHES isn't meant to be watched from a detached viewpoint any more than 
it's intended to provoke streams of tears.</P>
<P>     However, while the movie's approach, which shuns the nihilism of a 
SAVAGE NIGHTS and the mawkishness of a MY LIFE, is on-target, the tone 
is off.  The opening scenes are rife with the mistakes of a freshman 
film maker, and it shows.  For a while, Taylor doesn't seem to know 
where he's going and the actors don't have a solid handle on their 
characters.  Although David Arquette, Brad Hunt, and Kathryn Erbe 
gradually grow into their on-screen alter egos, the first third of the 
picture is marred by awkward, unconvincing performances.</P>
<P>     The good news is that as DREAM WITH THE FISHES progresses, it 
exhibits considerable improvement.  Actors like Cathy Moriarty (as 
Nick's aunt) and J.E. Freeman (as Nick's super-macho father) add a 
little color and flavor to the proceedings, and an interesting contrast 
is presented between Nick's dream woman and his real one.  We also learn 
that the tragedy of Terry's life isn't what we think it is.  He's the 
epitome of loneliness and isolation, cut off from the rest of humanity 
by his perception of himself and his inability to interact with others.  
Despite his constant assertion that he has no fantasies, we learn that 
his entire life is balanced on an intricate fabrication less stable than 
a house of cards.  While the ending offers hope, it remains carefully 
ambiguous, shunning an obvious Hollywood denouement.</P>
<P>     At times, DREAM WITH FISHES is dream-like.  The film's grainy look 
creates a gritty, down-to-earth mood.  There are no pastels or beautiful 
vistas here.  Irrespective of the heavy nature of the story, there are 
moments of sharp comedy (a cop's reaction to a dose of acid) and giddy 
exuberance (naked bowling).  However, DREAM WITH THE FISHES is still 
afflicted with the kind of quirkiness that has become a hallmark of 
Generation X films.  At least in this case, it seems better controlled 
than in many similar films about ennui.</P>
<P>     DREAM WITH THE FISHES is definitely flawed, and many of its faults 
are opaque, but the film possesses a compelling quality that can draw an 
audience into the story and make us care about the characters.  Taylor 
gets many of the details right and offers enough small surprises to make 
his directorial debut worthwhile.  This combined buddy movie/road movie 
veers off the interstate to follow a less commonly traveled course.</P>
