<PRE>TRUMPET OF THE SWAN
-------------------</PRE>
<P>Louie is a trumpeter swan with no voice.  In order to woo his lady love
Serina,
Louie makes friends with a young boy, Sammy, who persuades teacher Mrs.
Hammerbottom (Carol Burnett) to allow Louie to attend class.  Louie learns to
read and write and returns to his flock, but is laughed at once again when
no other swans can understand his message of love for Serina.  To make matters
worse, Louie's father feels he's lost his honor because of the trumpet he
stole for his son in this animated version of E.B. White's "Trumpet of the
Swan."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>As Jane Austen and Henry James have become popular sources for adult
filmmakers over the past decade or so, E.B. White is being returned to for
children's films.  The animated "Charlotte's Web" has become a minor classic
since its release in 1973 and 1999 brought us a live action version of "Stuart
Little." "Trumpet of the Swan," directed by Richard Rich (1999's animated "The
King and I," the "Swan Princess" series), is unlikely to be remembered along
with those two.</P>
<P>"Trumpet of the Swan" is receiving a regional theatrical release, but is sure
to quickly appear on home video.  Boston is one of the targetted cities
because our hero Louie becomes famous playing his trumpet in Beantown.  He
encounters a gypsy-like con man in the public gardens who pitches Louie and his
trumpet as an added attraction to Boston's swan boats.  Louie stays at the Ritz
Carlton before giving a concert at the Hatch Shell along the banks of the
Charles River.  At this point, Louie's earned enough money so that dad can pay
for the trumpet and become musically capable enough to win over Serina's
father.</P>
<P>"Trumpet of the Swan" features flat background art, some poor sound syncing
and insipid, sugary songs.  This effort would be better suited to Saturday
morning television than the big screen, but may be OK for the real small set.</P>
