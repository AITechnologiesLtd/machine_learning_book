<PRE>                          THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<PRE>        Geena Davis: Action Star. Whose bright idea was that?</PRE>
<P>        THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT plays like a two-hour 
comic book, with tongue-in-cheek dialogue, caricatures instead of 
characters and more violations of the laws of physics than the Big 
Bang theory... No, I don't want hate mail from scientifically-minded 
people out there, so if you didn't like that "Big Bang theory" 
reference, just change it to "creationism" and everyone will be 
happy.</P>
<P>        Davis plays a conservative school teacher in a small town. 
She's got a daughter and a decent boyfriend, but there's only one 
problem. She doesn't remember anything from her life before eight 
years ago. No childhood memories, no teenage memories, nothing 
prior to 1988. She's hired private detectives to dig up dirt on her 
past, but has so far discovered nothing. Until one night, when she 
hits a deer and runs off the road. She starts having weird dreams 
and finds her mood changing every once in awhile.</P>
<P>        That's when Samuel L. Jackson, the lowest-rent P.I. she 
hired, finds an old postcard with her handwriting on it, announcing 
her engagement. When Jackson is bringing this information over to 
Davis' house, someone else is already at her house, trying to kill her. 
She discovers she somehow knows how to fight, and kicks the guy's 
butt while her meek boyfriend watches.</P>
<P>        Davis and Jackson head off the next day to track down the 
address on the postcard, eventually finding out Davis used to be an 
assassin working for a secret government organization. She slowly 
regains her old personality as more and more people try to kill her 
and she continues to send them to their graves. The transformation 
is complete when she cuts most of her hair off and dyes the rest 
platinum blonde. Then she sings "Heart of Glass."</P>
<P>        The conspiracy to murder her, predictably, stems from the 
same organization that she used to work for. It also involves a bomb 
somehow and Davis' kid gets trapped in a tractor-trailer. Along the 
way, Davis and Jackson outrun fire, jump out a window and land in 
an icy pond, and survive explosions and electrocution. None of it is 
believable, particularly Davis as Tank Girl.</P>
<P>        THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT at least has a sense of 
humor itself, Jackson's character in particular. Without Jackson, 
who is quintessentially cool no matter what movie he's in, this 
movie would have been damn near unbearable. This movie is only 
for those people who like cliched, cartoonish action movies that 
have no bearing whatsoever on the real world. There are good 
movies that fall into that category, but as far as this one goes, you 
can kiss it goodnight.</P>
