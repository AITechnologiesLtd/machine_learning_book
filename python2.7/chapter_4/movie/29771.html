<P>_The_Musketeer_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)</P>
<P>        It appears that venerable, time-tested approaches to adventure yarns
just aren't good enough for Hollywood these days.  Coming fresh off the
ready-for-the-WB-network Gen-Y western stylings of _American_Outlaws_ is
_The_Musketeer_, which presents an even more curious take on melding the
traditional with the current cinematic trends: placing Hong Kong-style wirework
choreography in the world of Alexandre Dumas' ageless swashbuckling heroes.  Not
a terrible idea per se, but entrusting a hack like Peter Hyams to pull off such
a risky endeavor is.</P>
<P>        Xin-Xin Xiong, an esteemed HK action veteran who has worked with no less
than Tsui Hark on several occasions, choreographed the high-flying swordfights,
but as captured by Hyams' inept camera, it's difficult to tell if he's done a
noteworthy job.  If there is a wrong angle to shoot from or an ill-advised edit
to make, Hyams goes for it, and the choppy result are a number of incoherently
assembled flips and leaps being passed off as action scenes.  Hyams only figures
out where to place the camera for an elaborately staged duel that takes place on
a number of unsteady, ever-shifting ladders, but this one genuinely interesting
set piece--the only one that allows one to clearly follow the action--also
happens to be the film's last.</P>
<P>        But there are plenty of other problems plaguing _The_Musketeer_.  The
title character is young D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers), who has two goals in
life: to follow in his father's footsteps and join the King's royal fighting
force; but most of all to seek out the man who killed his parents 14 years
prior: Febre (Tim Roth, appropriately camping it up), a ruthless enforcer to the
scheming Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea, sleepwalking).  That the film is
called _The_Musketeer_ rather than _The_Three_Musketeers_ is no accident;
actually, a more appropriate title would've been _The_Super-Musketeer_, for this
version of D'Artagnan is downright invincible, able to defeat any number of
opponents with his gravity-defying derring-do.  Such a heavy-handed approach is
made even more ridiculous by the charisma vacuum known as Chambers, who lacks
the forceful presence to make an engaging hero, let alone a convincing
superhero.</P>
<P>        However, it's doubtful any lead could have made the awful script by Gene
Quintano (who previously worked with Hyams on the Van Damme vehicle
_Sudden_Death_) any more tolerable.  The primary revenge plot is a bore, which
is still better than can be said about D'Artagnan's soggy romance with a
chambermaid (a very out-of-place Mena Suvari); that thread is memorable for all
the wrong reasons, in particular some forced and downright embarrassing sexual
innuendo.  Too bad Quintano didn't heed a line he gave the Suvari
character--"Sometimes it's better to say nothing"--for the dialogue as a whole
is atrocious, especially the clanging one-liners that pop up at the most
inappropriate moments.  Take this gem during what's supposed to be the "tense"
climax: "I'm not dead, so why don't you hurry up and kill him already?"  While
enduring the ordeal that is _The_Musketeer_, you may find yourself asking the
person next to you--that is, if there is anyone else in the auditorium--"I'm not
dead, so why don't you hurry up and kill _me_ already?"</P>
