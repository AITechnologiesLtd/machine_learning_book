Director of Photrography  John Toll</P>
<P>     There are times when art touches a personal chord, and for me the
viewing of Mel Gibson's BRAVEHEART was one of those times.  I was born
and raised not far from Stirling in Scotland where William Wallace's
monument stands and his first battle took place.  As you can imagine,
the stories of Wallace abound in that area, and it is of great joy to
review that Gibson has done those stories and legends proud.  As with
any historic film, Gibson has taken some liberties with fact, but
overall he has kept to the spirit of Wallace and that is extremely
important.  It is the best film to grace the screens so far this year.</P>
<P>     Set in 13th Century Scotland,  we find the Young William Wallace
ready and willing to go and fight with his father and brother against
Edward II who killed off the nearest threats to his throne in
Scotland.  William's father tells him something which will stay with
him throughout his life and throughout the film: "It's our wits that
make us men."  Wallaces father and brother are killed and the young
William is taken from his home by his uncle Argyle, played by the
brilliant Scottish character actor Brian Cox.</P>
<P>     After some years, Wallace returns to his village and meets up with
his old friends and an old flame from his father's funeral, Morren.
They two fall in love, wed secretly and seem happy in their intended
life together.  However, the local English lord thwarts these plans
when he kills Morren, and then waits for Wallace.  This is the start of
a life of battling for Scotlands independence for Wallace.</P>
<P>     Wallace gathers an army and fights of the English at Stirling, and
then continues to York where he takes over the Northern English
castle.  The battle scenes in the film are quite amazing, and the gore
and bloodshed only help the gritty, realistic feel Gibson has given
this film.  From the battle scenes to the romance sequences Gibson
really has done a superb job and has shown he can Direct action as well
as anyone at the moment.  I would go as far as to say the battle scenes
are as energetic, exciting and well done as the action scenes in
SPARTACUS and BEN HUR.  But above all this, Gibson has a good grasp in
this film of the spirit and romance we surround with the time.  He is
not afraid to let images and little dialogue tell the story, which is
too often a mistake made by young directors.  Two scenes early in the
film prove this.  At his father and brother's funeral, William is given
a thistle by a young Morren and this is done with such beautiful and
simple imagery it is quite breathtaking.  Also, shortly after William
stands outside at night with his uncle Argyle and sees people up by
the graves with a piper, he asks what is going on.  Argyle replies,
"They're saying goodbye in their own way.  Playing outlawed tunes on
outlawed pipes."  Gibson doesn't ram down your throat the fact that
the King banned Pipes, but he uses it in a subtle way to show that the
Scots are a proud race, and not beyond taking risk for their culture.
Beautiful!!</P>
<P>     Scenes like these are all the way through BRAVEHEART, and never
let you realize the film is three hours long.  The acting is very good
throughout, and many of the supporting cast are as well written as
primary characters in most other films.  Gibson makes great use of
slow-motion, and also keeps a great sense of humour in the film.  I
would be surprised if John Toll, last years Academy Award winner for
Cinematography, is not up for the honors again this year.  His work
here is really gorgeous.</P>
<P>     This film I highly recommend, and do not worry about the graphic
violence, it is all in proper context.</P>
