<PRE>A Passion in the Desert
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) A PASSION IN THE DESERT has good cinematography and an
inventive story. A slowly paced midsection and an off-putting subject matter
keep it from being great (or widely distributed), but for the adventurous
moviegoer, it's worth a look.</P>
<P>Augustin (played very well by Ben Daniels, in a role with little dialogue)
is a soldier in Napoleon's army. Augustin's unit is transporting Venture
(Michel Piccoli), one of Napoleon's artists, to some of the sights in the
Egyptian Desert. After a martial skirmish, Augustin and Venture find
themselves alone and lost in the desert.</P>
<P>Augustin leaves Venture in search of water (both men knowing that he's
leaving Venture to die). Time passes, Augustin walks, and eventually, his
horse dies. He keeps plodding on foot and finally comes to a tent, where he
steals some water. He is chased from the tent and flees into a desert
canyon, where he hides in a cave. As his pursuers approach, he discovers
that he is sharing his cave with a leopard. The cat leaps out of the cave
and kills one of the men, giving Augustin the opportunity to find a new
hiding place.</P>
<P>The surrounding desert condemns Augustin and the leopard to share the same
canyon. The leopard has spared Augustin's life once, but the two still don't
trust each other. They come to terms with each other around the watering
hole, learning to share the water without hostility. Eventually, they learn
to share food, and finally, affection.</P>
<P>Augustin's affection for the leopard takes an unnatural turn after several
nights spent sleeping near each other. A passionate lick is all we see (or
all that transpires, for all we know), but it changes an interesting
hypothetical situation into something more fantastic. It severs some of the
the audience's empathy by being more than most of us would be willing to share.</P>
<P>At this point, it seems that Augustin has given up on being human. After
desperate days wandering through the desert and facing his own death, he
adapts to life with the leopard (whom he names Simoom). He has given up on
finding a way out of the desert and has instead chosen to fulfill his needs
in Simoom's canyon. Being a French soldier has not allowed him to survive;
being this leopard's partner has. When a troop of French soldiers comes
within earshot, he hides himself from them. He truly has shunned humanity.</P>
<P> Augustin's passion turns into jealousy when a male leopard shows up and
mates with his newfound love. He takes this insult badly. The problem, as he
sees it, is not his unnatural passion and jealousy, but his species. In
another of the film's awkward moments, Augustin strips naked, makes paint
from different-colored rocks, and cakes himself with orange and black mud.</P>
<P>Simoom seems to understand the limits of their relationship much better than
Augustin, and eventually she convinces him to rejoin his own species.</P>
<P>Daniels had a tough job in this role, and he pulled it off very well. The
range required for the part is expansive, and Daniels was convincing at each
level, from competent soldier to near-dead mummy to leopard-man. The
"acting" on the part of Simoom was also incredible (though some credit for
the "performance" should surely go to the director and editor for filling in
the gaps). The leopard had to, and did, communicate distrust, trust, and
affection. </P>
<P>The cinematography (by Alexei Rodionov) was also very good, although it's
hard to go wrong when you are filming in a desert. The film was shot in
Jordan and in Moab, Utah, both of which seem naturally photogenic. The same
could be said for Daniels' piercing blue eyes and the leopard's sleek form.
Not to detract from Rodionov's accomplishment, but it would have been hard
to shoot this film badly.</P>
<P>With all this going for it, A PASSION IN THE DESERT should be an outstanding
film. But Augustin's unnatural passion keeps us from really empathizing with
him, and thus from getting caught up in the film. His behavior is
explainable, but it is not fathomable. And because this was so integral to
the movie, its length could not have been easily cut. Perhaps the setup
could have been shortened, but then we would not be able to see the change
in the man so drastically. The movie, too long by a couple of minutes, had
nothing left to trim.</P>
<P>Still, the movie is quite original, so if you're feeling daring, go and see it.</P>
