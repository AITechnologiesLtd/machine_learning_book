<PRE>A Virtual Thriller
13th Floor</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Another "Twilight Zoney" Sci-Fi where what is real and what is merely
virtual aren't easily distinguished. The film starts strong presenting a
captivating scenario, then somewhere in the second half dips into a sappy
romance.</P>
<P>Sporting a great 1937 reconstruction of Los Angeles and good performances by
all involved, "13th Floor" looses focus when a love scene comes out of
nowhere. Most of the real action is reserved for the end, but the tension is
enough to keep the mystery ball rolling until then.</P>
<P>Starring Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio, Dennis Haysbert and
Armin Mueller-Stahl.
Directed by Josef Rusnak.
Screenplay by Josef Rusnak and Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez.
Produced by Roland Emmerich/Ute Emmerch/Marco Weber at Columbia/Roland
Emmerich.
Rated R.</P>
<P>Grade..........................B+</P>
