<P>      Why do we like sex?  Because it feels good? 
Undoubtedly.  Because it is a physical expression of love for
our partner?  Very likely.  Because it gives us a feeling of
power and dominance over our confederate?  Ah, there's the
most mysterious aspect of the thing, the angle which lends
itself to literary and cinematic manipulation.  In "L'Ennui," a
French movie which almost literally outruns this year's solid
German hit "Run, Lola Run," the soft-core sex is frequent, the
dialogue motormouth, the frenetic activity of the principal
character alarmingly fleet.  "L'Ennui" is a psychological thriller
without guns, yet a picture which explores relationships with
the psychological intensity of a rousing Hitchcock feature. 
Don't be misled by its title: this is a portrait of madness, of
obsession, of a passion all the more unconventional because
of the disparity of the sexual couple in age, temperament,
and motivation.</P>
<P>   The third film feature of Cedric Kahn, who is known mostly
to a French audience for two films about teen sex "Bar des
Rails and "Trop de bonheur," "L'ennui" is an adaptation of a
story by the Italian writer Alberto Moravia.  Moravia was one
of the first novelists of this century to declare that the goal of
sex was not pleasure or reproduction but rather dominance
over others. Since sex sells, we're not surprised to discover
that Moravia's novels have been made into films, such as
Vittorio De Sica's 1961 "La Ciociara," Jean-Luc Godard's "Le
Merpris," or "Contempt," and Bernardo Bertolucci's "The
Conformist."</P>
<P>   Charles Berling, running through the central role like a
horny and otherwise demanding middle-aged guy on speed,
turns in a dynamic performance as a 40-something professor
of philosophy.  Martin, who, despite the rigorous training he
presumably received in ontology and epistemology, is not
above asking a waiter in a cafe, "If a woman stands up a
guy, does it mean she does not love him?"  ("Not
necessarily," says the waiter, obviously knowing how to tell
the distraught customer what he wants to hear.)  Martin, who
maintains a friendship with his ex-wife Sophie (Arielle
Dombasle), uses the slim, sophisticated Parisian woman as a
sounding board for his new obsession.  By accident, he
meets the plump, uncomplicated Cecilia (Sophie Guillemin) in
the apartment of a 65-year-old painter who has just died.  We
learn later that the 20-year-old Cecilia's physical demands
were just too much for the aging artist.  The professor is
intrigued by this placid but promiscuous youth--who seems
positively unconcerned about the ethics of her actions and
seemingly as blase about bedding her partners as she would
be about relieving herself.  Martin knows enough about
himself to be aware that he wants to possess this woman, but
here's the great paradox so skillfully brought out by Berling:
the more he makes love to the object of his desire, the less
he possesses her.  Cecilia, who at first is agreeable to
meeting Martin daily for the sessions on the bed or against
the wall, drives him to the point of insanity when she begins
to draw back and to acknowledge that she loves another
man, Momo (Tom Ouedraogo) as much as she cares for
Martin.  "You can't," cries Martin, "Our semen mixes in your
stomach!"</P>
<P>   The picture is loaded with lines of that nature which come
across as unintentional humor but which, on reflection, are
creations of genuine waggery by Kahn and his co-writer,
Laurence Ferreira.  As the couple doomed by a conflict of
temperaments, Charles Berling and first-timer Sophie
Guillemin evoke the frustrations the complex man must face
when confronted by a girl who is the pillar of simplicity. 
"What do you think of me?" Martin wonders aloud. "I don't
know--tons of stuff," replies Cecilia.  Multiply this dialogue 20,
30, 40 times as the philosopher undertakes futilely to gain
answers from a woman with nary a shred of complexity and
you can readily believe that Cecilia is well on her way to
driving her second lover to self-destruction.</P>
<P>   The script is clever enough to contain several ironies. 
Martin has access to the girl's body but not her mind. 
Though he at first wants her only for physical release, he is
increasingly baffled, even foiled, by her inability or
unwillingness to share verbally with him.  Now there's a
gender switch on the usual men-are-from-Mars-women-are
from Venus hypothesis!  This is not the usual French
romance featuring a seductive vamp who drives a needy man
nuts by her physical unavailability, but one that subverts the
expected by highlighting a most ordinary, barely attractive
young woman pursued avidly by a man unable to extract
answers to his demanding and increasingly vehement
questions.  Director Kahn throws in a Fellini-esque scene of
Cecilia's father, a mute who is dying of laryngeal cancer, the
purpose of which becomes clear only near the conclusion. 
"L'Ennui" is anything but enervating viewing for its intelligent
targeted audience.</P>
