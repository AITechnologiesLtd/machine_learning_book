<P>1969. The year has been explored numerous times, most notably(to me)
in "The Wonder Years", which is the only T.V. show that I actually
enjoy watching.  In 1969, man landed on the moon, and Woodstock hit
the world like no other musical event had before. Actor Tony(GHOST,
NIXON) Goldwyn's directorial debut, A WALK ON THE MOON, tells the
story of a family whose lives are turned upside down during the summer
of '69 in a Catskills bungalow colony.</P>
<P>Pearl Kantrowitz(Diane Lane) is a Jewish housewife from the city who
seems to be bored with her marriage to straightforward Marty(Liev
Schreiber). She got pregnant at 17 and forfeited her young life to
take care of her two children, Alison(Anna Paquin) and Daniel(Bobby
Boriello). She seems to want to experiment more, to be young again,
and there is no better time than the summer of '69. It is then that
the blouse salesman(Viggo Mortensen) arrives at the bungalow
colony. His name is Walker Jerome, and he is quite the hippie. He
rides around in his bus full of blouses, and soon, the married Pearl
is joining him. Pearl's psychic mother-in-law(Tovah Feldshuh) knows
about her little outings with the blouse man and urges her to stop it
for her family's sake.  Meanwhile, the teenage Alison is coping with
her first boyfriend, and her first period.  She is also going through
an experimental hippie phase, and it is not long before she catches
her mom at Woodstock with the blouse man. Pearl's mother-in-law
finally calls up her son and forces him to get up to the Catskills
immediately to try to fix up the whole mess.</P>
<P>There is nothing especially groundbreaking about the story or the
technique, but the story is told in such down-to-earth fashion that
you can't help feeling intrigued by the coming-of-age of Pearl and
Alison. Mortensen's Walker is never more than a caricature though, and
the story is by-the-numbers, but the film does manage to capture the
whirlwind of turmoil in the Kantrowitz family. Diane Lane is very
good, and Academy Award winner Anna Paquin gives her character as much
life as possible. All in all, Tony(grandson of Samuel) Goldwyn's A
WALK ON THE MOON doesn't offer much insight into the lively 60's, but
it does present us with a nice little slice of life that is sure to
charm most viewers. No matter how much Miramax has sold out, the
company still knows how to put out good movies year-round.</P>
