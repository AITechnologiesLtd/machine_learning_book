<P>Starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi.
Directed by Jonathan Mostow. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Jonathan Mostow is a director with few pretensions. He knows what genre
he is working in -- so far it has been pure action -- and invests all
of his efforts in making the best damn genre movie possible. His first
two Hollywood projects, the Kurt Russell thriller Breakdown and now the
splendid submarine movie U-571 have both been rousingly successful in
doing one thing: generating pure, unadulterated suspense. The dialogue
is minimal, the characterization is purely perfunctory but with Mostow,
it doesn't seem to matter. I doubt anyone is going to accuse Mostow of
being the next Hitchcock, but I doubt he'll mind: he's too confident
and smart a director.</P>
<P>The film has one of my heretofore least favorite Hollywood actors earn
at least a little of my respect. Matthew McConaughey, whom I had given
up on a long time ago, plays Tyler, an executive officer in the Marines
who, in the beginning of the film (and in the middle of WWII), is
complaining to his superior (Bill Paxton) about his being refused his
own submarine to commandeer. Literally moments later, he gets his wish.
He and a varied group of Marines, some experienced and some not, are
being sent on a covert mission: to retrieve the Enigma, a machine that
would help the Allies decode secret messages that the Axis powers are
sending to each other. This involves pretending to be a Nazi submarine
to raid another one that is broken down at sea.</P>
<P>As the film's marketing campaign reveals, the operation does not go
smoothly. They retrieve the Enigma and are about to get back on their
sub and go home when it is blown up by torpedoes. McConaughey and Co.
are now stuck on an unfamiliar German submarine. Only one of them knows
how to read German and extensive repairs are necessary to get the sub
moving again. As if that wasn't enough, they also have a Nazi
battleship to contend with...</P>
<P>U-571 simulates the same creaky, dripping underwater atmosphere as did
Das Boot, the mother of all submarine movies, as well as The Abyss,
which went quite a bit deeper into the blue sea. There have been
others, but few done as well as this one. Not since Titanic has a
camera been so much a part of the action: it tirelessly chases after
the actors, sweeps around the cramped sets and goes in for terrifying
close-ups of the soldiers' wrenched faces. The film doesn't bother to
define interesting characters -- the people here are mostly just
composites of conventions from earlier films -- and yet we worry about
the people we see on the screen.</P>
<P>Mostow effectively uses silence to help the excitement along. I'm a
firm believer that a strong soundtrack can save an action movie but
moments when we hear nothing can be just as suspenseful as blaring
music. As Alfred Hitchcock said, it's not the bang that scares you,
it's the anticipation. When the aforementioned battleship starts
dropping charges in the water above the submarine, we hear the muffled
explosions get louder and louder. Before we know it, we're on the edge
of our seats awaiting the "Boom" that will send our beloved crew
members flying. We know it will happen but Mostow stages these scenes
so masterfully that we have fun simply waiting for it.</P>
<P>McConaughey, it seems, has finally found his niche. Much like Keanu
Reeves, the actor is most effective when the least is required from
him. There is no complexity to this role -- I don't even remember the
character's name -- and he shines in it. He doesn't have to emote much
and he manages to make his character sympathetic.</P>
<P>U-571 is frightening and claustrophobic and yet it is never cold or
unpleasant. Like he did in Breakdown, Mostow creates heroes we can root
for, puts them in a situation we can get interested in and then has
them solve the conflict at hand in spectacularly exciting ways.</P>
