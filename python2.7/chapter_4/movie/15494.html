A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Tony Kaye</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: David McKenna</PRE>
<P>Ingredients: neo-Nazi, redemption, legacy, family</P>
<P>Starring: Edward Norton, Edward Furlong</P>
<P>Synopsis:
When Venice Beach high school student Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong)
becomes drawn to the neo-Nazi movement, the principal puts Danny in a
personal tutoring program whereby he must write about the life his older
brother Derek (Edward Norton), whom he idolizes. Through Danny's eyes,
AMERICAN HISTORY X tells the tale of how wayward brother Derek became
involved with the neo-Nazi movement, was sentenced to prison for a
shooting, served time, and faced the legacy of his mistakes.  </P>
<P>Opinion:
AMERICAN HISTORY X is a non-formula movie that approaches neo-Nazism
from a non-stereotypical view. It shows how seemingly average teens with
empty lives might get caught up in a racist social movement perpetrated
by demagogues with political ambitions.  Aside from redemption, another
central theme of AMERICAN HISTORY X is the concept of legacy. A man
might serve time in prison, but for both victims and aggressors, the
consequences of former actions continue. Although the pace of the film
somewhat uneven at times, and there is perhaps one unnecessary scene in
the last third of the movie, AMERICAN HISTORY X is an excellent family
drama that is well photographed and poignant as well as superbly acted.</P>
