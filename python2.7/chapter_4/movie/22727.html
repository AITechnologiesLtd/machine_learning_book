<PRE>Titus
A film review by Max Messier

<PRE>Titus Andronicus: One mean bastard.</PRE>
<P>Okay... I'm kinda lost.  Who the hell is Titus Andronicus, you may ask,
fellow reader, and why the hell was I never forced to read this
Shakespearean play in high school or English 1A in college.  Well, Titus
A. was the first play by Bill Shakespeare, but if I am wrong, you crazy
Shakespearean cultists out there, please don't hunt me down and make me
read the unabridged version of Hamlet, about the usual themes of the
mighty Bill: Revenge, hatred, a little bit of incest, honor, mental
loopiness, and damn good human mincemeat pie.  The hard part of trying
to bring Shakespeare to life through either film or stage production is
trying to cut through all of the pompous attitude of the director and
making an understandable, comprehensible piece of narrative.</P>
<P>The pompous attitude of this version of Titus, not to be confused with
the 1998 Germany TV movie `Titus und der Fluch der Diamanten', is what
drags this film along like a squirrel caught in the wheel well of a semi
driving cross country.  When I watch a film, I want to watch a film, not
a play.  When I watch a play, vice versa.  When Titus explodes across
the screen in the first five minutes, I was intrigued by the imagery of
a child making a mess of things with G.I. Joes and every condiment in
the fridge -- and then the whole world exploding outside his window.
Then as I settled in and began to take account of the situation during
the next twenty minutes of the film, my inner child screamed for mercy.
I was mentally beaten by the `imagery' and the ridiculousness of how
dramatic a person can be just by standing up and walking a few steps and
then sitting down again.  Where is Kenneth Branagh when we need him?</P>
<P>For the next 2 1/2 hours of sheer torment, I was witness to a parade of
the absurd.  Jessica Lange in an orgy, Hopkins naked in a bathtub makin'
drawings of his bum with the blood of his severed stump for a hand,
cannibalism, a drag queen for an emperor, a frame-up job that pales next
to the works of Mamet, and (yes) a human mincemeat pie.  I think the
spookiest thing I witnessed was a strange Blair Witch Project reference
with a chick whose tongue was cut out, like Josh the camera guy, and her
hands cut off and replaced by twigs.  Somebody better make a call to
Artisan and report this travesty.</P>
<P>The root of all of these errors falls on the heads of the production
crew that steered this oil tanker of a film onto the rocky cliffs of
Schumacher-land.  The clash of costume design that resulted in a strange
mix of both Mad Max and Flash Gordon outfits.  The flamboyant, over-done
MTV montages of dreaming and non-dreaming states of consciousness.  The
inclusion of Jessica Lange in a Roman orgy: Run away -- run away!  The
dead weight of subplots that needed a good dose of Walter Murch editing.</P>
<P>So why did I award this film with two stars instead of one?  Two
reasons: Human mincemeat pie and one great orgy.</P>
