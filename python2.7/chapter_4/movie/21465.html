<PRE>REFORMED DRUNK</PRE>
<PRE>MUSIC OF THE HEART
Directed by Wes Craven
Screenplay by Pamela Gray from the memoir by Roberta Guaspari
With Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn
De Vargas     PG     124 min.</PRE>
<P>     To repeat that Meryl Streep is the most gifted movie actress of her
generation is to be the bearer of no startling news.  One of Streep's most
remarkable qualities as an actress is that she finds her personality and
mannerisms in her characters, whereas most actors, even very good ones,
bring their own personae to the character.  In "Music of the Heart", a
movie based on a true story previously told in the documentary "Small
Wonders", she plays Roberta Guaspari, a determined woman who teaches violin
to kids at an East Harlem elementary school.  Streep spent two months
intensively learning the instrument, and she hardens her jaw and thickens
her speech into the patterns of a small-town girl and Navy wife whose
horizons are defined by her marriage and her music.  </P>
<P>When the marriage falls apart, she's helplessly adrift until a chance
meeting with an old friend (Aidan Quinn) leads to her traveling to New York
to land a job.  Streep's face as she rides a taxi through Harlem, clutching
her pocket book to her breast, tells you everything you need to know about
this woman.</P>
<P>Sadly, there is more to the movie than Streep's acting.  There is also
a screenplay, stitched together by Pamela Gray like a quilt of the most
familiar material she can find.  Gray has gathered her patches from every
movie ever made about teachers in inner city schools, without ever
stumbling across any with dramatic value.  The result is a series of
monotonous, colorless, repetitive and boring scenes about a life that would
not appear to be worth the telling if it were not for a lively and stirring
grand finale at the movie's end.  When Guaspari's school program is
threatened with a budget redline, she pulls together a benefit "Fiddlefest"
that winds up in Carnegie Hall with guest artists like Itzhak Perlman and
Isaac Stern sharing the stage with Roberta and her students.  Only at this
late point does the Kleenex come out, and the two hour ordeal rises at last
to a satisfying conclusion.  The presence of these virtuosi and the
legendary venue brings some magic, but it is magic that is borrowed, not
earned.  </P>
<P>The role of Roberta Guaspari was originally Madonna's, but she took a
powder a couple of weeks before shooting started.  Too bad.  Madonna's
acting talent would have been less at odds with the level of the material. 
The shocker is that this drab and uneventful exercise is directed by that
master slasher, Wes Craven ("Nightmare on Elm Street", "Scream").   In his
effort to mend his ways, Craven has crawled into the soft shell of the
reformed drinker who used to be life of the party, but now bores everyone
to tears.  </P>
