<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 stars</P>
<P>The mid-to-late 90's obsession with urban crime fables has resulted in
some sensational efforts, most of which aspire to the success -
artistically and commercially - of a Quentin Tarantino movie.  I never
expected that the Australian film industry, famous for its quirky and
simple-minded films, would enter the realm of these violent and often
darkly humorous pieces of in-your-face entertainment.  The film in
question is 'Two Hands,' an engaging and often intense picture that is
fresh, lively and different to the norm.  Debut writer/director Gregor
Jordan finds a pulsating energy in his production elements - ranging
from the cast's diverse appeal to the film's bright cinematography, it's
clear that this one is out to impress.  Impress it does, and in large
abundance.  'Two Hands' is a breath of fresh air for the Australian film
industry; a fun adrenaline rush that will probably linger in your memory
for some time.</P>
<P>Rising Aussie star Heath Ledger plays Jimmy, who works in Kings Cross,
Sydney, as a street promoter for a strip club.  Hoping to improve his
salary and his work, Jimmy accepts a job from neighborhood goon Pando
(Bryan Brown).  He is given $10,000 in an envelope and an address to
deliver it to, but, as the plot unfolds, the job goes drastically wrong,
and Jimmy is being chased all over town by Pando and his goons.  Still,
he makes sure that he has enough time to pursue love-interest Kate (Rose
Byrne), a friendly art student who enjoys taking photos.  Also involved
in the story are two homeless kids, played by Mariel McClorey and Evan
Sheaves, who have small but integral parts, and serve as tools in which
to question audience morality.</P>
<P>It seems inevitable that titles like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Lock, Stock and
Two Smoking Barrels' will be mentioned in a review of this film, for
their obvious familiarities in genre filmmaking.  'Two Hands,' like
these films and many more, is distinctive in its own way.  For starters,
the film has an obvious Australian touch to it - the dialogue is laid
back and relaxed, the settings are not glamorous or appealing.  The
screenplay doesn't delve into stories and debates like 'Pulp Fiction',
and its editing doesn't produce the clockwork pacing that made 'Lock,
Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' fast and furious.  There is something
different here, a kind of new texture to the genre.  'Two Hands' doesn't
constantly try to win audiences over, it simply follows its narrative to
the end without glancing back to notice whether we were still watching.</P>
<P>Chances are, you will be.  'Two Hands' is a bold drama wrapped around a
comedic lesson of morals, wrapped around a simple, even slightly messy
thriller. Gregor Jordan captivates his audience time and time again,
reaching a good mixture of amusing gags and fast action.  What he
doesn't create is a film that is engaging as a whole, but rather one
that has plenty of memorable and amusing scenes and subplots.  It's
bound to be a crowd pleasing movie, and contains enough jags and
recurring plot elements to keep the viewers who don't find the central
plot interesting still amused.</P>
<P>Heath Ledger struts his stuff so confidently as the title character that
there is absolutely no doubt that we will be seeing him again in the
future (in fact, in his next film, he plays Mel Gibson's son).  I'm not
sure whether he channeled that energy into a good performance, though
it's certainly an entertaining one.  Bryan Brown also fares very well as
the married, and quite amusing tough guy Pando.  Others are slightly
less impressive, like Rose Byrne, who is solid but her part is
considerably underdeveloped, probably as a result of the film's
ninety-two minute running time.  Come to think of it, that's an odd
choice for a running time in a film of this nature - the story unfolds
fairly slowly (although its never boring), and even then, there's some
unnecessary bits like its narration by Jimmy's dead brother.  'Pulp
Fiction,' which I've refused to mention too much in this review, was
almost double its length.  Perhaps 'Two Hands' could have benefited from
a little more meat.</P>
<P>But there's still so much here to like. Jordan's direction is
multi-layered with impressive production elements; the cinematography,
the music, the camera shots and the editing all give the film a truly
cinematic feel.  The jokes - I wished there was more of them - are funny
and memorable.   'Two Hands' is a likeable film that isn't original
enough to become a cult classic, but a damn good time at the movies.
Sometimes you don't get everything, but sometimes, you just enjoy what
you've got.</P>
