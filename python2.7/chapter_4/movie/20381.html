Longing for a good KISS (Concert)
Detroit Rock City</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Teenage pot-heads risk everything to make it to a KISS concert.</P>
<P>With a synopsis like that, a lot of you may shrug off this picture as cheap
teen cheese. And for the first third, you'd be right. But like a discounted
junkie that straightens out his life surprising everyone with some actual
success, "Detroit Rock City" pulls itself out of high school mediocrity and
into actual good moviedom.</P>
<P>Picking up where Cheech and Chong (1970's comics who relied heavily on weed
for their humor, audience and perhaps inspiration) left off, "Detroit Rock
City" begins with a basement rock band of high school burnouts hell-bent on
finding their way into a local KISS concert. Mildly interesting during its
setting, the little film seems to lack what it finds later on -- heart.</P>
<P>After a series of mishaps the four boys decide to split up and have a try at
obtaining their individual "ins." This is where the story really takes off.
Each stumbles across a find more valuable than that prized entrance. The
film shows its true colors as a coming of age story.</P>
<P>One boy (Furlong) decides to enter a nearby male stripper contest. This
scene is a laugh riot and deserves high praise.</P>
<P>Set in the 1970's and produced by Gene Simmons (among others), this scrawny
little script eventually becomes a rich film.</P>
<P>Starring Giuseppe Andrews, James De Bello, Edward Furlong, Sam Huntington,
Lin Shaye.
Directed by Adam Rifkin. Written by Carl V. Dupre.
Produced by Gene Simmons, Barry Levine, Kathleen Haase at
Newline/Takoma/Base-12/Kissnation.</P>
