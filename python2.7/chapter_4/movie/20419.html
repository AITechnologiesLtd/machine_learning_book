<P>After lying on the shelf for over a year, this epic tale based on Michael
Crichton's novel is released with little fanfare right before the Labour Day
weekend, a time generally reserved for servings of crap cinema. Is it that
bad? Not really. In fact, it does generate several scenes of decent combat,
but all in all, a wasted opportunity.</P>
<P>PLOT:
An exiled Arab is chosen to be the 13th warrior in a pack selected to defend
a king's homeland against the legendary half-man/half-bear predators from
the mist. The man is reluctant at first, but slowly acclimatizes himself to
the group and acquires the aptitudes of a true warrior.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This movie starts off real slow and boring, has way too many scenes hidden
by darkness, way too many lines lost due to badly spoken dialogue, but does
offer a few invigorating sequences of violent battle and a couple of gory
scenes as well. If you are expecting another epic classic a la BRAVEHEART,
you may as well save your money right now, and rent a quick & easy pornos
instead. But if you don't mind a rinky-dink story and enjoy seeing
Viking-like men kick bear ass, this film might be of healthier interest to
you. I thought the second half of the film was much more enjoyable than the
first, but could not help but feel like there could have been so much more.
For one thing, it would have been nice to SEE many more of the battle
sequences, most of which were unfortunately masked by the darkness and lost
to my weak eyes. It also would have been nice to toss some speech therapists
the way of Antonio Banderas and the mighty Nordic men who all seemed to be
mumbling their incoherent lines through the entire gig.</P>
<P>On top of that, this is not necessarily a picture that needs to be seen on
the big screen. In fact, you may want to check it out on a lonely video
evening sometime next year, when the bad blood behind the making of the film
has all but dissipated. It may just go down better at that point. I also
think this film would have benefited from a name change. Forget THE 13TH
WARRIOR, which centres around the Banderas character, who to me, seemed
little more than a whiny beeyatch. How about the original novel title of
"Eaters of the Dead"!? Yeah, now there's a cool title! And those crazy
man-bears sure were creepy enough to merit that designation. Which reminds
me of a film that came out earlier this year, a cannibal tale it was, which
entertained me so much more than this sub-par offering. It was called
RAVENOUS (7.5/10) and supplied plenty of narrative, action and cannibalism
to whet anybody's bloody appetite. Now there's a movie to see! This one,
well, see it if you like films which start off slow, have plenty of scenes
in the dark, a few good battle sequences and incomprehensible men talking
bunk. Otherwise, stick to the cooler cannibal tale of 1999 and check out
RAVENOUS!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Antonio Banderas' full name is José Antonio Domínguez Banderas. Born in
Málaga, Spain, Antonio originally wanted to play soccer professionally. His
dream crashed when he broke his foot at the tender age of fourteen. That's
when he started acting. He was a staple in the Pedro Almodovar films of the
'80s, and he crossed over to American films in 1992 with THE MAMBO KINGS,
which he did phonetically. He is a Libra, and currently married to
big-breasted actress Melanie Griffin.
Actor Omar Sharif's birth name was Michael Shalhoub. He was born in 1932, in
the city of Alexandria, Egypt. He is also known to be a world-class bridge
player.
Author Michael Crichton stands 6'9" and was apparently exorcised in 1986. He
may be best known for having written the novels upon which the hugely
successful JURASSIC PARK films were based.
Director John McTiernan is probably best known for directing the original
DIE HARD movie with Bruce Willis. He also directed the third and crappier
one, called DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE.
After an earlier version of this film performed badly in sneak previews, new
scenes were reportedly shot under the direction of author Michael Crichton.
The budget of this film apparently ballooned close $100 million.
Screenwriter William Wisher Jr. is known to have written the screenplay for
TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY.
This film's title was changed from THE VIKINGS to THE EATERS OF THE DEAD to
THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR.
Ironically, much of the movie was shot on location in British Columbia and
other parts of Canada.</P>
