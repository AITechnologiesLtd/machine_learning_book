<PRE>                               THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS
                       A film review by Christopher E. Meadows
                        Copyright 1996 Christopher E. Meadows</PRE>
<P>My score: 2/10 (* out of a possible *****)</P>
<P>    If you loved Highlander and groaned at Highlander II and III...if
you loved Alien and Aliens but Alien^3 made you want to beat your head
repeatedly against the wall...if you enjoyed The Crow, then use the
money you would have spent on City of Angels to rent the original and
watch it again.  City of Angels is a waste of money and a waste of
time.</P>
<P>    Why did the original Crow work so well, and the sequel fall so
flat?  Let's compare the two movies, look at what The Crow had that
COA (or, perhaps more appropriately, _DOA_) did not.</P>
<P>    Leaving aside the issue of morbid curiosity and publicity (which
shouldn't have anything to do with how good the movie actually is in
the first place), firstly, The Crow had Brandon Lee.  His poise, his
screen presence, his sardonic humor...the more I watch The Crow, the
more I mourn his premature passing.  City of Angels had Vincent Perez,
who just went around killing people.</P>
<P>    When it comes right down to it, one of The Crow's greatest assets
were its characters.  Brandon Lee's Eric D'Raven, Ernie Hudson's
sympathetic beat-cop Albrecht, Michael Wincott's fiendishly
charismatic Top Dollar, the thugs, Sarah, Sarah's mother, the whiny
pawnshop owner...whether you loved them or hated them, they were all
memorable, they said memorable things ("At least he didn't do that
'walking against the wind' shit.  Man, I hate that...") and it made a
difference to you whether they lived or died.  </P>
<P>    City of Angels gives us cardboard cutouts who wander the movie's
dark backdrop and occasionally get killed and/or mutilated, many of
whom are direct clones of characters or aspects of characters from the
first movie.  Whereas in The Crow, I watched Eric Draven hunt down and
kill his murderers and relished every moment, in CoA I just wished he
would get _on_ with it.  We just don't _care_ about these people,
which means what happens to them has very little impact upon the
viewers.</P>
<P>    And then there's the story of the film itself.  It may not be _War
and Peace_, but there _was_ a story to The Crow that was, if I might
be so bold, uplifting.  It wasn't just a "guy comes back from the dead
for revenge" movie; in a very real sense it was a story about seeing
the desolation and depravity of your surroundings and rising _above_
them--as the song went, "it can't rain all the time."  Some people are
capable of this redemption on their own (like Sarah); others (like her
mother) need a little help, and there are still people out there
trying, even if they doubt they'll ever make a bit of difference
(Albrecht).  City of Angels, on the other hand, just gives us a dead
guy running around killing people.</P>
<P>    City of Angels, while it rips off the basic plot of The Crow and
even clones a scene or two, so utterly and completely misses the point
that it's just not worth sitting through.  More attention is paid to
the atmosphere than to the story, and with the rock soundtrack and the
avante-garde cinematography, it sometimes feels more like you're
watching a 90-minute music video on MTV.  Viewers are treated to an
hour and a half of depravity and violence, with none of the humor, the
emotion, the redemption of the original movie.  Not only is it
pointless, it commits the cardinal sin of being _boring_, and it
cheapens the first film.</P>
<P>    Leave this one for the same teen Goth crowd that keeps White Wolf
Games in business...I imagine _they'll_ eat it up.</P>
