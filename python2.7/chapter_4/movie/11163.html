<P>Marlon Wayans (yet another Wayans brother?) is a pretty funny guy.  He
seems pretty nice, too.  Even though he doesn't have a lot of screen
presence, he made me laugh quite a bit as I watched Senseless.  And I
suppose that this is the point of the film--get us to like Marlon
Wayans.  Unfortunately, Wayans can't significantly overcome this dopey
script.  The movie has funny moments, yes, but most of them originate
with the profoundly dumb idea on which Senseless is based.  The comedy
is an excuse for the lame story, but everything would be so much funnier
and less painful if this statement were the other way around.</P>
<P>Wayans stars as Darryl Witherspoon, a poor (money-less) college student
trying to make money in order to pay for school, and to help out his
mother and his three siblings.  He tries giving blood four times a day,
but this proves tiresome.  He does various odd jobs about campus, but
none of them seem to pay well.  Finally, he agrees to be part of an
experiment led by Dr. Wheedon (Brad Dourif).  The experiment has Darryl
injecting glowing green slime into his buttocks (and we get to see this
process several times!).  The end result allows Darryl's senses to
become hyper-alert.</P>
<P>He can read microscopic typing from hundreds of feet away.  He can
smell non-existent body odor.  He can hear the ticking of a watch ten
feet away as if it were church bell in his ear.  Once he is able to
control his senses (and the rectal itching dies down), he finds that his
new heightened senses will be particularly useful to win a coveted
accounting job for a big company.  His primary competitor for the job is
the evil Scott Butler (David Spade, who is totally hilarious here), a
Rich Boy who gets everything handed to him by his rich father.  Along
the way, there is the obligatory love affair with a beautiful woman
(Tamara Taylor).</P>
<P>I suppose a pretty good word to describe this film is generic.  Aside
from Wayans, there's nothing much new here.  Not that this is
necessarily bad:  stock-comedies can be enjoyable, even if they aren't
very original.  As a story, however, Senseless is particularly bad.  The
screenplay doesn't even ask me to suspend my disbelief (uhhh, so what
are the side effects of this miracle drug?), so I didn't feel inclined
to take any of it seriously.  Was I supposed to?  Well, the film itself
takes all the moments with Darryl's family extremely seriously.  Most
dopey comedies like this require that there be serious moments, even if
the tone doesn't match the rest of the film.  </P>
<P>This is where director Penelope Spheeris comes in.  I remember her work
on Wayne's World to be pretty good, and here it's certainly not awful. 
But scenes within the film clash magnificently with the rest of the
film, such as all the subplots revolving around Darryl's pierced-up
roommate, Tim (Matthew Lillard from Scream).  And in one moment, a
strange revelation is made about Janice's heritage, and I was very
curious as to why.  It provides an interesting sequence in which Wayans
fondles Rip Torn...and I suspect that this is the sole reason that this
plot detail was included.</P>
<P>And that's what Senseless comes down to.  This is not the kind of film
one can hate--it's just kind of there.  There's no objectionable
material (well, I suppose there's some toilet humor).  Wayans is funny,
Spade is funny, and all of the actors are competent, but the story is
here for no other reason than to provide a few funny sequences for
Wayans to run through.  When the film is over--should you decide to see
it--take a step away and just think about how phenomenally absurd the
entire thing is.  Then ask yourself if you cared as you watched the
film.  When I ask myself that question, I realize that I didn't care too
much.  I guess it deserves points for that.</P>
