<PRE>CROUPIER
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Heavy on style and seductiveness, the British film "Croupier" is
one of those unassuming Channel Four franchises that creeps out of nowhere
and provides a thought-provoking alternative to the blather of Hollywood's
summer lead-in.  In Mike Hodges' film, a blocked writer (expertly played by
Clive Owen) takes a temporary job as a croupier in a London casino to make
ends meet and soon becomes drawn into the complexities of gambling,
gamesmanship, and goodness knows what else.  It's a simple enough storyline
but it's given remarkable depth by writer Paul Mayersberg and significant
worth by its stellar cast, mostly unknowns on this side of the Atlantic
(although the croupier's girlfriend, played by Gina McKee, will be
recognized from "Notting Hill").  Owen, handsome as all get out with his
jet-black hair and matching tux, commands the film with a smoky, smoldering
performance that's matched only by his own smoky voiceover, often times
nicely at odds with--or second guessing--the narrative, and a smooth jazz
scoreline by Simon Fisher Turner.  "Croupier" is more a character study
than a card-sharp drama, yet Hodges scores some winning touchdowns in the
casino proper.  Here the hush of a dealt card and the chink of one chip
against another provide delicate soundscapes that contrast with the glam of
the ensuing roughness.  Good stuff this, as Jack (Owen), who was raised in
South Africa and did some dealing there, soon regains his wonderlust for
watching people lose as he tries to walk the straight and narrow.  But it's
a wicked twisted world out there where temptations are ripe and
commonplace, more frequent, certainly, than the turn of a friendly card.</P>
