I'M ALRIGHT JACK (***** out of ******)</PRE>
<PRE>A review from the Stockholm Film Review
<A HREF="http://www.reviewfilm.com/">http://www.reviewfilm.com/</A></PRE>
<P>It is the 1950's in Britain, and the nation is undergoing social 
and economic changes after the long depression of World War Two. 
Stanley Windrush (Ian Carmichael), newly-graduated from Oxford, 
and most decidedly 'old money', decides to dabble in industry. 
Despite the absolute disapproval of his aunt Dolly (Margaret 
Rutherford), who is appalled that a gentleman should actually have 
to toil for a wage, he goes looking to various companies for an 
executive position. The problem is, though well-meaning and charming, 
Stanley is a useless twit. He infuriates his interviewers and causes 
chaos when shown around the factory floor wherever he goes.</P>
<P>Stanley has become desperate when his uncle Bertram Tracepurcel 
(Dennis Price) offers him a job at his armaments factory, Missiles 
Ltd. The catch is that Stanley must start at the bottom. Bertram 
also advises him not to mention the fact they are related, 'in the 
interests of industrial relations'.</P>
<P>Stanley runs into problems on his first day. He is put to work moving 
crates, but since he hasn't done a days work in his life, he cannot 
operate the forklift, and his accent is obviously not working class. 
His work-mates have reason to be suspicious of him, since they have 
discovered that the management has been secretly observing their work 
practices in a 'time and motion' study. The workers immediately tell 
the head of the Works Committee Fred Kite (Peter Sellers), who demands 
an instant meeting with the general manager Major Hitchcock 
(Terry-Thomas),who offers to fire him (since he knows that the real 
'time and motion inspector (John Le Mesurier) hasn't begun working yet. 
Since it goes against all of Kite's beliefs to let management fire a 
worker, he takes Stanley under his wing. He has mistaken Windrush for a 
well-meaning intellectual, and when Stanley moves in with Kite and his 
family, he subjects Stanley to long-winded discussions on socialism, the 
Soviet Union and Marxism. Stanley had only moved in because he got a 
glimpse of Fred's blonde bombshell daughter Cynthia (Liz Fraser).</P>
<P>John and Roy Boultings 1959 comedy is a brilliant satire on both the 
class struggle and industrial relations in Britain of the 1950s. As the 
movie shows, both were closely intertwined. Despite a complete absence 
of any natural talent, Stanley Windrush expects to become an executive, 
because he has been educated at Oxford and is a 'gentleman'. The 
management structure in industry mirrored the Army structure from the 
war, which of course mirrored society: - Major Hitchcock is the manager 
of the factory and had been an officer in the Army. Another factory 
owner, Sidney De Vere Cox (Richard Attenborough) had served with Stanley 
as officers. 
The workers were all non-commissioned soldiers.</P>
<P>The workers are, to a man, bone-idle at Missiles Ltd. Any attempts to 
improve productivity or change work practices are stoutly resisted. And 
the heart of that resistance is Fred Kite. Fred, sporting a Hitler 
moustache, sees life as one long class struggle. He takes his 
inspiration from socialist struggles across the world, and is 
permanently on guard against any change to the status quo. Again, this 
reflected the wider situation in society. It was difficult for anyone to 
move out of their class (in an upward direction anyway), and since a 
worker would get paid anyway, why bother do a good job? The management 
doesn't really care too much about quality or efficiency either - since 
most of their business is dependent on the 'old boy network'.</P>
<P>In the case of Missiles Ltd., Tracepurcel has employed Stanley for a 
reason. Knowing him to be useless, he figures that it will only a matter 
of time before he causes trouble. Tracepurcel has hatched a plan with De 
Vere Cox and needs a strike at his factory. The plan seems to be working 
when the union vote to 'send Stanley to Coventry' (i.e. ostracise him) 
for raising productivity. Stanley had unwittingly quadrupled the 
productivity requirements of the workers by showing off his prowess with 
a forklift in front of the undercover 'time-and-motion' inspector. Kite 
calls a strike, which then escalates as other factories go on strike in 
sympathy. Soon, half the country is on strike. Since a nation-wide 
strike would jeopardise Tracepurcel's plan, Stanley comes under pressure 
to quit, from both the management and the union.</P>
<P>The depiction of the factory atmosphere is both hilarious and deadly 
accurate. On his first day, Stanley comes across 4 workers playing 
cards. These are not mere idlers - their role has been eliminated but 
the company cannot fire them (or the union will strike, so they are paid 
to come in every day and do nothing. The American author and journalist 
Bill Bryson, in his best-selling memoir of living in Britain, Notes from 
a Small Island, recalls his time working for a British newspaper during 
the mid-1980's. At one point, auditors discovered an extra 300 printers 
on the payroll of another newspaper (i.e. they weren't actually 
reporting for work at the newspaper). From the Fifties to the Seventies, 
British industry grew more strike-prone and less efficient. All was to 
change with the election of 
Margaret Thatcher in 1979, which, after traumatic confrontation, lead to 
the dismantling of union power in the UK. </P>
<P>In contrast to the dodgy work practices depicted in the film, the 
production values in I'm alright Jack are of Rolls-Royce standard. The 
Boulting twins, having produced some fine dramatic pieces during the 
1940s (most notably Brighton Rock), turned out a number of light 
comedies during the 1950's, most with the same cast. Indeed, I'm alright 
Jack is actually a sequel to Private's Progress (1956), which featured 
Terry-Thomas, Carmichael, Price and Attenborough playing the same 
characters (but in the Army). And in 1959, the Boultings also released 
Man in a Cocked Hat (a.k.a. Carlton-Browne of the F.O.), starring 
Terry-Thomas and Sellers.</P>
<P>All of the performances are hugely enjoyable. The cast had spent the 
entire decade working almost as an ensemble (and very often for the 
Boultings) and it shows. If I have one regret, it is that we don't see 
enough of either Terry-Thomas or Sellers. Terry-Thomas played much the 
same role in many of his movies, but he was always enjoyable to watch. 
Sellers is a revelation. He completely inhabits the persona of a man for 
whom the union is his life, and is his only source of power. Speaking 
entirely in bureaucratic gobbledegook, and delightfully mispronouncing 
any word over three syllables, Seller's Fred Kite demonstrates not just 
his comic touches but also his undoubted acting ability. Sellers was on 
the verge of discovery in 1959. His third movie of that year, The Mouse 
That Roared, would attract the attention of film producer Blake Edwards, 
who decided that Seller's comic talent would be ideal for a David Niven 
star vehicle which he was planning. That movie was The Pink Panther and 
it was released in 1964, the same year as another Seller's film, Dr. 
Strangelove.</P>
