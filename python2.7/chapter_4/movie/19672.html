<PRE>
 The Red Violin (1999) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Samuel L. Jackson.</PRE>
<P> "The Red Violin" is a cold, sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and
detached.</P>
<P> It's a movie that seems almost clinical, as it traces the 300-plus-years
history of the legendary musical instrument of the title.</P>
<P> Opening in the 17th century, the story shows how violin-maker Nicolo
Bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son. But when
tragedy strikes, the violin becomes the personification of its maker's
grief.</P>
<P> From there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at
an Austrian monastery. Again, tragedy strikes as the child is struck down
at the moment of his triumph.</P>
<P> We follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in England
and in Mao's communist China before being discovered by expert Charles
Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson), who mounts a painstaking investigation to
prove its authenticity.</P>
<P> The violin becomes Morritz's obsession, just as it is for all those who
converge on a Montreal auction house to bid on it. Morritz, however, is the
only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and
appreciate its creator's intention.</P>
<P> "The Red Violin" could have been a touching, inspirational story, as
soaring as a Beethoven symphony.</P>
<P> However director Francois Girard fails to make any emotional connection
with the viewer. Here is a story that could have made use of various camera
angles and lighting to heighten its impact.</P>
<P> Girard, for some unknown reason, uses mostly master shots, keeping his
camera - and thus us - at a distance. We get no feel for the miracle that
is the violin. It's resonance, its purity of sound are not emphasized
enough to make an impression.</P>
<P> Nor are any of the performances memorable. It's as if Girard wanted all
his actors to play second fiddle to his violin.</P>
<P> "The Red Violin" promises much, but delivers little. It is dull at times,
a bit pretentious and a might murky. The movie's music soars over its story
and performers. And that is its only saving grace.</P>
