<P>   If you found a porno tape discarded in the trash, would you
take it home and screen it?  Destroy it so that no one could
do so? Would you instead take it right to the police?   Would
you simply pass it by?  The chances are that whatever you
answer, you could not justifiably be labeled a pervert for your
curiosity.  But now take another situation.  You see in the
trash what looks like a snuff film.  What would you do?  For
the more pristine among us, let it be known that a snuff film
takes s&m to its extreme.  Such a work depicts the actual
brutalization and murder of a woman at the hands of one or
more sadistic men.  From what I hear, the vast majority and
perhaps all snuff films in existence are fakes.  Given the
ability of today's movie technology to do just about anything
you want it to, it would be no difficult matter to feign a
sadistic killing and to pay the "victim" for her role.  After all,
why show the real thing if nobody can really take a fake from
the McCoy?  Simple: there are people out there willing to pay
big bucks to witness actual murders close up, and then to
pocket the film for future viewing.</P>
<P>   After you see this new psychological thriller featuring
Nicolas Cage and directed by Joel Schumacher ("The Client,"
"A Time to Kill"), you could not be blamed if you decided to
do absolutely nothing but to get as far away from a snuff clip
as you can.  Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage), a private
investigator, chose otherwise, and got himself and a number
of others into a heap of trouble, almost destroying his
marriage and losing his life in the bargain.  Though he
emerges a hero, he treads way over the line of duty.  Any
rational person in his shoes would have turned his situation
over to the police, but in this taut story penned by Andrew
Kevin Walker ("Seven"), Welles becomes obsessed with what
is easily the most exotic and dangerous case he has handled.</P>
<P>   The first person who should have let sleeping dogs lie is
the fabulously wealthy Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter) who upon
her husband's death discovers a small reel of 8 millimeter
film in his wall safe.  The film depicts the violent death of a
16-old-girl by a masked sadist, who beats her and then
plunges a knife into her chest in order to capture the girl's
look of absolute terror at the moment of impact.  (Yes,
Virginia, apparently there are people who get off on this sort
of thing.)  The wheelchair-bound widow hasn't the foggiest
idea what the film is doing in her late husband's possession,
and hires Welles to find out whether the murder was actual or
simulated.  Treating the situation as a missing persons case,
Welles discovers the identity of the victim, interviews the girl's
mother, Mrs. Mathews (Amy Morton), travels from his
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania home to the runaway teen's
Hollywood destination, and becomes immersed in every
level of the porno industry.  He buddies up with a smart, adult
bookstore clerk, Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), and
ultimately exchanges details of the case with some of the
sleaziest individuals seen on the screen since scripter
Andrew Kevin Walker's depravity-bathed movie "Seven."</P>
<P>   "8mm" starts calmly as though Tom Welles were a modern
Perry Mason rationally investigating a predicament, but
director Joel Schumacher steadily turns on the tension as the
obsessed Welles sinks deeply into the muck of the
underground porn distributors.  As Welles meets such dirt
bags as Dino Velvet (Peter Stomare), the artistic director of
the snuff works; Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini), whose
studio deals in the films; and Machine (Chris Bauer), a black-
hooded individual who performs the alleged murders--we in
the audience are left to ponder Welles' motivation for risking
his neck over a complete stranger who may not even be
dead.  Does he see his own baby daughter, or even his
concerned and frightened wife  Amy (Catherine Keener) as a
potential victim of these vermin?  Or does he become himself
turned on by the intrigue of the seedy industry?  </P>
<P>   "8mm" is for an audience that relished David Fincher's
1995 movie "Seven," which featured a striking cast including
Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth
Paltrow.  "8mm" s not as well crafted as screenwriter
Walker's previous film, which was exceptionally  organized as
a search for a serial killer out to punish those who commit
one or more of the seven deadly sins.  But it's virtually as
unsettling, considerably more violent, and likewise appears to
wallow in human depravity.  Nicolas Cage, whose career took
off after portrayals of eccentric characters in offbeat movies
like "Raising Arizona" and "Moonstruck," is appropriately
called one of the great actors of his generation (he's 34). 
Said to have had two of his teeth pulled for his role in "Birdy,"
swallowed a live cockroach for his part in "Vampire's Kills,"
and slashed his arm while preparing to take on "Racing with
the Moon," he is the ideal choice to portray the intensity of a
man obsessed with finding a killer and making the
acquaintance of men on whose sight you'd not hesitate to
cross the street.  He is ably paired with the California porn
industry's only good-guy, played by Joaquim Phoenix as a
guy who reluctantly takes a gig selling sleaze but who reads
Truman Capote disguised within a porno paperback cover.  </P>
<P>   Cage becomes as violent as Mel Gibson's Porter in Brian
Helgeland's "Payback," and features one off-the-wall
filmmaker played by Peter Stomare (an expert with the
crossbow who takes pride in directing teen murder) and the
owner of a film company played by James Gandolfini who
self-destructively curses a man bent on revenge, daring him
to pull the trigger.  As though the on-screen violence is
insufficient to get the audience juices flowing, Mychael Danna
raises the intensity with an unusual score featuring Middle
Eastern music at one point.  Photographer Robert Elswit
keeps us in the dark a good deal of the time, particularly
when demonstrating the nitty gritty, but puts outdoor
Hollywood in a coarse light to signal its spunkier side. </P>
<P>   Those of us who want to see a major statement
promulgated by the film will point to the latest incidents of
man's inhumanity to man--in Kosovo, in Bosnia, in Sierra
Leone--butchery that appears to be done for its own sake, for
the pleasure it brings to the killers.  Others will see "8mm" as
a popcorn flick, yet another effective and furious product from
Hollywood's dream factory.  In either case, consider leaving
grandma home this time around.</P>
