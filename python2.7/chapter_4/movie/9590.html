<P>     Apart from the enormously entertaining finale, THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE
is one Hell of a long sit.  Keanu "Now you know why I avoid ocean lin-
ers" Reeves plays a hotshot Florida attorney with an unbroken winning
streak and one small problem to go along with it:  he's increasing
sickened by the scum that he's chosen to defend.  Before he can reflect
on the matter-- or at least give a call to Dr.  Laura-- he's offered a
dream job in New York City, at a high-powered law firm, where he and his
doting wife (Charlize Theron) are given personal attention by the found-
er, John "Paradise Lost" Milton (Al Pacino), a cackling, charismatic
character who keeps a fire burning in every room, prefers to travel
underground, and seems willing to grant their each and every imaginable
desire.  Hmmmm, could this be... Satan?</P>
<P>     If you didn't catch the tell-all trailer, director Taylor Hackford
(DOLORES CLAIBORNE) flashes the secret sign at least a double-dozen
times.  All the usual tricks are trotted out-- quoted scripture,
religious imagery, exaggerated sound effects, and, even, a handful of
mighty morphin' power demons.  (The latter are first imagined/ actually
seen by the wife, whose sanity starts to go the moment that she sets
foot into their enormous Park Avenue apartment.) The director doesn't
sustain that sinister sense of dread, though, and that's one of the
fundamental problems right there.  The other is an imbalance in plot:
we get too much of Reeve's character and not enough of the wife.  She
descends into madness much too quickly, while it takes forever and a day
for him to come back to the moral crisis that got him into trouble in
the first place.  (Of course, it doesn't help that Reeves is entirely
wrong for the role.  He doesn't have the swagger that the role requires.
Hell, he isn't even fully awake in every scene.)</P>
<P>     Damned by a flabby midsection and a stiff leading man, THE DEVIL'S
ADVOCATE is saved by a strong supporting cast (Heather Matarazzo, Craig
T. Nelson, Don King, etc.), sumptuous set design (by Bruno Rubeo), and
Pacino's command performance as ol' Scratch.  Al plays it cool for most
of the movie-- a leer here, a flickered tongue there.  For the grand
finale, though, he throws the door wide open.  You can almost hear the
director yelling "more!  more!" as Pacino abandons any remaining notion
of restraint, tearing into a priceless monologue that allows us to
finally hear what the Big L. has to say on the subjects of God ("he's a
sadist"), love ("biochemically, it's no different than eating large
quantities of chocolate"), and man ("guilt is like a bag of fucking
bricks.  All you gotta do is set it down").  Even Reeve's mush-mouthed,
come-and-go Southern accent can't ruin the moment.  I haven't been this
grandly entertained in months.</P>
