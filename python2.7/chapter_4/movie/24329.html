<PRE>_Timecode_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Without question, Mike Figgis has to be one of the most boldly
experimental filmmakers working today.  So it would only follow that his
track record in recent years is among the most inconsistent; gambles
wouldn't be labeled as such if they paid off every time.  While he hit
the jackpot with a little no-budget, 16mm effort called _Leaving
_Las_Vegas_, the risks he's taken since haven't been so successful.  Last
year's non-linear, non-narrative _The_Loss_of_Sexual_Innocence_ was
indeed, as he described, his most "personal" film--that incoherent,
indulgent jumble could only make sense to him.  Immediately prior to
that, he tried to do the impossible--turn Joe Eszterhas-originated sleaze
cheese into gold--with _One_Night_Stand_.  It goes without saying that he
couldn't make that work.</P>
<P>It's hard to imagine a more daunting task than that one, but leave it to
Figgis to come up with the ultimate sink-or-swim cinematic proposition,
which now hits the screen as _Timecode_.  The story (or, rather, stories)
being told does not qualify as being revolutionary by any stretch.  What
does, however, is the storytelling--which, to use an overused bit of
hyperbole, is unlike anything anyone has seen before.  And this time
around, the perpetual gambler clearly comes out on top.</P>
<P>Based on the plot alone, the title _Timecode_ would not appear to fit. 
The film follows a number of characters over as they wander in and around
the Ticketmaster building on Sunset Boulevard over a single, continuous
stretch of 93 minutes.  The primary players: Rose (Salma Hayek), a
vivacious aspiring actress; her jealous lover, Lauren (Jeanne
Tripplehorn); boozed-up and drugged-out Alex (Stellan Skarsgård), head of
the motion picture production company Red Mullet (which also happens to
be the name of Figgis' real life production company); and Emma (Saffron
Burrows), his unhappy wife.</P>
<P>These and many other characters crisscross during this 93-minute span,
not unlike the multicharacter epics made familiar by Robert Altman.  This
being a Figgis film, though, there is a radically different spin, which
is threefold: (1) the film unfolds on a screen split into four quadrants,
with each portion following a different character and/or storyline all at
once; (2) each of the four "sub-movies" were shot continuously for those
93 minutes, without any cuts, on digital video cameras; and (3) there was
no set script, only a basic story outline from which the actors entirely
improvised their dialogue and a few storyline turns.  The project being
entirely dependent on the precise timing of the cast and crew, the title
_Timecode_ is only too apt.</P>
<P>A label that perhaps isn't so apt is that of "director" for Figgis. 
This is not meant as a slight on his work; far from it.  His meticulous
direction and arrangement of the individual pieces is more befitting of
the label of "conductor"--very appropriate, considering that Figgis wrote
_Timecode_'s score (as he does with most of his films) and mapped out the
entire work on sheet music paper.  It's nothing short of astounding how
he was able to perfectly sync the four individual pieces, which all
seamlessly interlock at various moments in time and tone.  But even more
impressive is how he makes the four-POV approach feel necessary and not
merely as a shameless gimmick (which it is to some degree).  If
_Timecode_ were edited like a normal film, there's no doubt that some
valuable moments of story and especially performance would be lost.</P>
<P>The latter loss would be most unfortunate, for its the actors that makes
_Timecode_ more than a cold exercise in the possibilities of digital
video technology.  The entire cast--which also includes Holly Hunter,
Leslie Mann, Kyle MacLachlan, Steven Weber, Alessandro Nivola, and a
hilarious Julian Sands (playing a masseur) in smaller roles--appear to be
energized by their high wire task, and their immersion into character
shines through; none of the improvised dialogue sounds awkward, but
rather quite convincing and real.  For example, when Rose tells her
secret lover to not place a piece of food on a surface because "we just
had sex there," it is a natural wisecrack and completely in line with her
character.</P>
<P>As well as the improvisation works as a whole, it does contribute to
_Timecode_'s biggest shortcoming, which is in the story department. 
While what goes on is fairly eventful for a 93-minute stretch of life, as
a self-contained movie, the plot threads are all fairly thin and "made up
as they went along" approach makes for a certain lack of urgency. 
Despite the fresh visual technique, _Timecode_ still suffers from the
same problem of these multicharacter pieces, which is that some plot
threads don't work well as others.  While most characters jump from
quadrant to quadrant as the film progresses and stories overlap, Burrows'
Emma remains fixed in the upper right hand corner, and, not surprisingly,
her storyline is by far the weakest; she has the least amount of
interaction with others, which is the primary catalyst for story
developments and interesting moments of improv.</P>
<P>As much as I enjoyed _Timecode_, I am not eager to see every movie
employ its revolutionary splitscreen storytelling technique; it does take
some getting used to, even when the shifting emphasis of the sound mix
helps direct one to the most pertinent action.  But if Figgis were able
to make something this strange, funny, and exciting to watch without a
script, imagine the possibilities of its use at the service of a more
concrete story.  Unfortunately, that likely won't happen for a long while
(if ever), and in the meantime one can only admire Figgis' audacity, for
going through with such a crazy idea--and his talent, for making it work.</P>
