<PRE>The Usual Suspects</PRE>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>There are really two types of crime movies: the ones that suck you in with
their complex plots, interesting characters, and intense situations, and the
ones that you spend two to three hours in front of a television bored out of
your gourd. With two Academy Awards (Best Supporting Actor, Kevin Spacey,
Best Original Screenplay, Christopher MaQuarrie), I shouldn't have to tell
you which category "The Usual Suspects" falls under.</P>
<P>The movie, filled with intricate plot twists, follows a five-criminal bunch
who you love to hate as they get their revenge upon the NYPD for arresting
them one too many times – only to discover that the scheme itself has more
to it than it seems, cumulating with 27 bodies on a pier in San Pedro,
California and $93M sitting in a truck.</P>
<P>Believe me, no matter how smart you are, the ending to "The Usual Suspects"
will never strike you as Usual.</P>
