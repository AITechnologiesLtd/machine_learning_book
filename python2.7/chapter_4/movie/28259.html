PEARL HARBOR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, using the same sensitivity that he did in 
COYOTE UGLY, turns his attention from scantily clad women who make their 
living by dancing on a bar to one of the seminal moments in our nation's 
history.  The result is that PEARL HARBOR is a lame love triangle in a 
patriotic wrapper.  It's the movie that everyone feared, incorrectly as 
it turned out, that TITANIC would be -- a big, expensive special effects 
extravaganza without a heart.  And it's the kind of movie that leaves 
viewers angry for wasting incredible amounts of their time with such 
drivel.</P>
<P>You'll laugh.  You'll cry.  You'll undoubtedly laugh out loud at its 
many sappy moments of ridiculous hokum.  And you probably at least feel 
like crying that such an important event in our country's history has 
been turned into a silly romance with one clichéd line after another.  
What a colossal wasted opportunity.</P>
<P>Buy the popcorn and go for the big tub.  You'll need something to do as 
you wait forever for the movie to get to its raison d'être, the 
destruction of most of the United States's navy at Pearl Harbor.</P>
<P>The movie's story concerns a pair of hotdog pilots, Rafe McCawley (Ben 
Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), who grow up together and 
"fly" their first plane at age 9.  Once grown, they both end up as 
military pilots and in love with the same woman, Evelyn Johnson (Kate 
Beckinsale).  All of the characters are reduced to stereotypes so that 
you'll likely care little when tragedy strikes them.  Even the movie's 
sex scene, which is shot with a soap commercial gloss, is laughable.  
Sometimes the film gets so over-the-top that you begin to wonder if it 
is an intentional parody of a wartime romance.</P>
<P>The trite dialog includes such gems as, "You don't dogfight with a 
manual," "If I had one more night to live, I'd want to spend it with 
you," "All I ever wanted was to have a home and grow old together," and 
"Good huntin'."  After most such lines, the music is brought up 
dramatically.  The movie, with its heavy, syrupy score, frequently seems 
more like a music video than a movie.</P>
<P>Writer Randall Wallace (THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK) does come up with one 
good line.  When Rafe is asked by Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) if he knows 
what a "top secret mission" means, he replies that it's "the kind of 
mission where you get medals, and they send them to your relatives."</P>
<P>Yes, PEARL HARBOR, directed by Michael Bay (ARMAGEDDON), does have one 
of the best trailers ever.  The trailer scenes form the body of the 
movie's only successful part, the half-hour section that occurs just 
past the midpoint in this endurance contest of a picture -- it's over 
three hours long.  My advice to you is to arrive ninety minutes late 
since nothing, absolutely nothing, of interest happens until the 
Japanese Zeros arrive to obliterate our fleet.  A typical scene during 
the cinematic wasteland that is the movie's first half has Rafe stealing 
a police boat so that he can show the New York City lights to Evelyn.  
What, you will be asking yourself frequently during this period, does 
this all have to do with Pearl Harbor?  And, as you twiddle your thumbs 
waiting for something to happen, you'll keep asking yourself, "Why does 
this story have to be over three hours long?"</P>
<P>Responding to a compliment on his brilliance, the Japanese officer 
planning the infamous sneak attack, replies, "A brilliant man would find 
a way not to fight a war."  Which brings us to the movie's most 
intriguing revelation.  Pearl Harbor was our fault!  In a fascinating 
bit of revisionist history, the movie has the Japanese leader explain 
how they were forced into it.  Kind of makes you wonder what insights a 
Bruckheimer story about Hitler would divulge about his real motives.</P>
<P>If you're willing to put up with the saccharine nonsense of the first 
half, the movie's middle section -- a CGI tour de force -- will send 
chills up your spine as our boys are almost completely annihilated and 
sent to watery graves in which many still lie.  The computer generated 
effects are awesome, which is a good argument for seeing a film about 
the making of PEARL HARBOR.</P>
<P>"I'm not going to make it," one of the brave soldiers says at the end.  
I know just how he feels.  I barely made it through the long ordeal of 
watching the movie.</P>
<P>PEARL HARBOR runs a butt-numbing 3:03.  It is rated PG-13 for sustained 
intense war sequences, images of the wounded, brief sensuality and some 
language and would be acceptable for teenagers.  Its PG-13 rating is 
quite questionable since the horrific scenes of the wartime wounded, who 
squirt blood everywhere, are much more intense than you'd ever expect to 
find in a PG-13 film.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, May 25, 2001.  
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the AMC and the Century 
theaters.</P>
