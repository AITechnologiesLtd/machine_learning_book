<PRE>                                  HIGH HEELS
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     HIGH HEELS is a film by Pedro Almodovar.  The film stars Victoria
Abril, Marisa Paredes, Ana Lizaran, Miguel Bose, and Feodor Atkine.  In
Spanish with English subtitles.  Rated R for brief nudity, profanity,
and "adult themes."</P>
<P>     HIGH HEELS is minor effort by a major director, another of his
satirical melodramas, but without his usual compelling coherence.  The
initial promise is of something off-beat, complex, psychological rich,
stylish and stylized.  Alas, Almodovar failed quite to live up to this
promise.  The end result is a vague, cluttered whodunit, with too many
side stories and characters that are mostly beside the point.</P>
<P>     The point is, after all, the relationship between the legendary pop
diva Becky Del Paramo (Marisa Paredes) and her grown daughter Rebecca
(Victoria Abril, last seen in TIE ME UP, TIE ME DOWN), a TV news anchor.
Becky hasn't seen Rebecca for 15 years when she returns to Madrid to
mount a new show.  The two women share more than a blood relationship --
they are destructively competitive of each.  In symbol of their
belligerent and similarity, Becky wears Armani and Rebecca Chanel.</P>
<P>     The two principal women are excellent actors and their characters
are presented in some depth and sympathy.  Unfortunately, Almodovar
chooses to more often tell us who they are, rather than show us.
Ultimately, the women in WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN are
more complete, more sympathetic, and a whole lot funnier.  Instead,
although HIGH HEELS has its moments and its lines of dark and ingenious
wit, it wants to be tearjerker, but fails to earn the right.  As for the
major male characters, one is a oversexed, another is sexy, but mostly
they are the usual drones in the Almodovar hive.</P>
<P>     As a piece of design, HIGH HEELS comes up to the usual high
standard of Almodovar films.  Likewise, the photography is tropically
color-saturated, with sensitive use of natural light.</P>
<P>     In general, I would not recommend HIGH HEELS as an introduction to
Almodovar.  See either (or both of the other films mentioned above, or
LAW OF DESIRE, if you want to know what the excitement is about.  If you
already know and dote on Almodovar, as I do, then you will want to see
HIGH HEELS, despite its limitations.  In that case, I suggest you seek
out a cheap matinee.</P>
