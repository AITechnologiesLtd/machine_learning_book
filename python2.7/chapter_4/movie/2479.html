<PRE>"Welcome to the real world, where, most of the time,
 things don't go the f***** way you want."
                        - Denis Leary to a teenager, whining about life.</PRE>
<P>     Just in time to fill the void left by GRUMPY OLD MEN comes THE
REF, a gleeful celebration of cynicism and "bad will toward men" that,
for my money, is a bona fide Christmas classic.  THE REF *works* and, as
a Spring seasoner, it's the classiest current comedy out.</P>
<P>     Dennis Leary is "Gus," a burglar whose Christmas in Connecticut is
heisting for the holidays.  But Gus gets a lump of coal after botching
a burglary on Christmas Eve.  Alarms go off, his partner gets scared,
and Gus is left fleeing on foot.  To better his escape, Gus hijacks a
married couple (Davis and Spacey) and directs them to their home.</P>
<P>     One problem: the couple is returning from their marriage counselor
and they *cannot* stop fighting.  Even after being tied-up and held at
gunpoint.</P>
<PRE>     (Leary instructs: "I have a gun.  It's loaded.  Shut up.")</PRE>
<P>     Things quickly go from worst to awful with the arrival of the
police, the teenage son, and the in-laws.  The film climaxes in a
hilarious dinner/present-opening scene with Leary posing as marriage
counselor "Dr. Wong".</P>
<P>     Everyone in THE REF is madder than hell and they spend the entire
film venting it at each other.  Normally, this would make for a very
oppressive occasion--holiday film or otherwise.  But director Ted
Demme, nephew of Jonathan, keeps the tone carefully balanced between
hateful and humorous.  Even the most caustic comments are amazingly
amusing.  Anyone who's ever held their tongue for the holidays will
delight in this fiercely frank farce.</P>
<P>     With only a couple sight gags and a minimalist plot, THE REF
succeeds on the virtues a great script and a great cast.</P>
<P>     Denis Leary is an exasperated marvel, cursing in bewilderment and
punctuating every double-take with a variation of the f-word.  Judy
Davis is a gem, playing her "wicked wife" very close to her character
from HUSBANDS AND WIVES.  And Kevin Spacey is a surprise standout as
the henpecked husband who gets to speak his mind *and* whack a
Christmas tree with a fireplace poker.</P>
<P>     The three wise leads--who share equal screen time--are backed by
a super supporting cast that includes Richard Bright, Robert
J. Steinmiller Jr., and Glynis Johns.  The latter once played the mother
in MARY POPPINS.  Here, she's the "Mom from Hell."</P>
<P>     The screenplay, by Richard LaGravenese and Maria Weiss, is black
comedy at its best and has enough great lines to warrant a second
viewing.  Or third.  Or fourth.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:     THE REF is a hilarious black Christmas comedy about a
                 husband and wife and son and mother-in-law who get to
                 tell each other *exactly* what they feel, courtesy of a
                 calls-it-like-it-is burglar who's holding them hostage
                 for the holidays.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: A-</PRE>
