<P>PLOT:
After graduating from high school, two girl best friends try to figure out what
they want to do with their lives. In the meantime, they make fun of people
around them, attempt to get real jobs and play a dirty trick on an older, lonely
guy. That being done, one of the girls gets a job, hoping to move on with her
life, while the other, falls for the older, lonely guy, and starts hanging out
with him more. Okay, so it doesn't sound all that exciting, but trust me...it's
got some cool insight, great characters and a wonderful ambiance all around. See
below...</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
There are great movies and then there are movies that hit you on a personal
level and elevate it to an even greater level. Does that make any sense? Well,
either way, I really loved this flick. It's not a "big movie" by any stretch of
the imagination, but its characters, its environment, its authenticity and its
capacity to capture the feeling of an outsider living in society today, well,
really drew me into its story. A story which incidentally, doesn't have a
typical structure. It's basically about these two high school girls who are
trying to figure out what the next step in their lives will be. This leads to
self-discovery, some introspection and an insightful look at the way people use
facades in order to get by in life. Of course, you don't have to be a teenage
girl to be able to relate to any of their feelings of alienation, concern for
their futures, non-conformity and the general notion of not being able to "fit
into" society (do you ever just feel trapped?). For many, there is a fine line
between "putting food on the table" and "selling out".</P>
<P>I've personally always had a fascination with the so-called "weirdos" from high
school (especially the goth chicks and girls with Doc Martens...yeah, baby!)
Maybe because I was kinda weird myself (or maybe I still am...not sure). But the
bottom line with most of these folks, as with the two girls in this film, is
that they're basically just like the rest of us, but with some deeper
insecurities, and a greater need to put up walls. The two ladies in this film
put others down in order to feel better about their own stations in life and
because they cannot seem to pursue their own goals. Of course, they don't do any
of this consciously, but just like in real life (boy, do I ever know a lot of
people like this!), it happens and it's interesting to watch them interact with
the rest of the characters in this movie.</P>
<P>But don't let me make this film sound too profound! It's actually very funny,
clever, extremely well-written and everyone in the cast fits their parts to a
tee. Especially Buscemi and Birch, who are both perfect in their roles, and
really give their respective characters the added layer of vulnerability needed
to pull you in even further. I also appreciated the various plays on stereotypes
in this film, but with a twist. Buscemi plays the typical "collector guy" with
all of his anal habits ("I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests. I
hate my interests!"), but he's surprisingly very conscious of himself being that
person. He doesn't pretend to be anything else. He's honest about it and that's
what makes him that much more appealing. Birch's friend is also very typical of
your know-it-all, sarcastic chickie-dee at the beginning of the film, but as
their lives move forward, she grows, adapts and accepts some of what her life is
offering, as opposed to Birch's character, who simply cannot seem to let go of
her irresponsible teenage self.</P>
<P>Man, but there's so much more in here as well. There's drama, there's a genuine
sense of empathy for the characters, there's an open-ended resolution that could
not have been more ideal for a film as such, there are some nifty old-time tunes
and there is an incredible feeling of loneliness woven deep within the film's
fabric. Mind you, if you've read my entire review up to this point, you should
also note that this is not your typical movie for your everyday moviegoer. Let's
face it...it's a bit of an "art-house" movie, but a damn good one! (in the same
vein of a, let's say...RUSHMORE) Oh yeah, I also forgot to mention the entire
sub-plot with Illeanna Douglas playing the over-the-top "performance artist"
teacher, who skewers all of those pretentious bastards and the whole lesbian
undertone running throughout the entire picture, between Birch and her "best
friend" (or was that just me?). Anyway, as you can see, I really, really loved
this movie, even more so because I'm quite confused about my own dinky future at
this point in my life as well, so it likely struck a chord, or
actually...several chords! Either way, check it out if you're looking for a
sardonic flick with a unique point of view, some great performances, fun
dialogue, a catchy soundtrack, many clever bits and a resounding, heart-felt
message.</P>
