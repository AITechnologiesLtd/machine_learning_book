<P>     Here I offer a bit of free, friendly advice for film-makers:  if you
are going to make a two hour long film, please don't make it feel like a
four hour long film...and for heaven's sake, don't title it INFINITY.  You
just can't feed a critic a straight line like that; I'm only human, and
it's too easy.  INFINITY is a Moebius strip of a movie experience, a film
which goes on and on and on without a single compelling situation or
character to hold your attention.  Under the rookie direction of Matthew
Broderick, INFINITY inspires an almost suffocating boredom and the
question of why he even bothered to hire an editor.</P>
<P>     Broderick also stars in this fact-based story as Nobel Prize-winning
physicist Richard Feynman, who is a brilliant young student in Queens, NY
when the main plot begins in 1934.  He meets Arline Greenbaum (Patricia
Arquette) at a high school party, and the pair soon become inseparable.
Their romance continues while Richard attends college, but an even greater
impediment than distance soon arises.  Arline is stricken with an illness
which eventually is diagnosed as tuberculosis, at the time an incurable
and contagious disease.  Despite the grave circumstances and against the
wishes of family, Richard and Arline marry in 1941.  That is also when
Richard is recruited to join a top-secret program in Los Alamos, New
Mexico as part of the team handed the task of developing the atomic bomb.</P>
<P>     On one level, INFINITY is a difficult film to hate actively, because
it clearly was made with some care.  The film is lovingly photographed by
Toyomichi Kurita and scored by Bruce Broughton, and its period detail is
meticulously re-created by production designer Bernt Capra.  That makes
INFINITY a nice film to look at, at least for a little while, until it
becomes apparent that there is not a single thing going on worth caring
about.</P>
<P>     The crushing flaw of INFINITY is that it is almost entirely about the
romance between Richard and Arline, and not once does a spark fly between
Broderick and Arquette.  The script (by Broderick's mother Patricia)
focuses on the intellectual nature of their relationship without paying
much attention to developing them as individuals, resulting in characters
constructed mostly of thick Queens accents and episodic eccentricity.
Arquette is more successful at giving Arline some small measure of appeal,
but she is unable to make this love affair matter.  With no other
character in the film provided even a glimmer of a personality, INFINITY
rapidly begins to sink under the weight of a painfully dull central
relationship.</P>
<P>     It is not Broderick's fault that the real-life circumstances of this
story have Arline dying for nearly four years, but it is definitely his
fault that I was placed in the ghoulish position of hoping she would just
get it over with and die already.  For nearly ninety minutes Arline is
alternately sick and well, and over the course of that ninety minutes we
move abstractly between Richard's personal and professional life, with
scene after scene inspiring me to throw up my hands in exasperation at the
utter lack of a point.  I counted ten scenes in INFINITY which literally
served no narrative or dramatic purpose, and countless other instances
where the judicious use of a knife on several hundred frames of film might
have made me less eager to use one on my own throat.</P>
<P>     Much is made of Richard's unwavering rationalism, as when he reads to
Arline from a medical book detailing what her condition might be while her
doctors insist on protecting her, and I suppose the intention is to convey
the unique nature of their love.  What it really does, however, is make
for a love story without a drop of emotion until Broderick breaks down in
the film's last scene.  At that point, I was sort of feeling like crying
myself, mourning two hours of my life which had begun to feel like
infinity.</P>
