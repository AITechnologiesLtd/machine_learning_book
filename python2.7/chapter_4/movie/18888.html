<PRE>***1/2 out of four</PRE>
<P> Starring Nicholas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, Michael Stormare. Rated R.</P>
<P>Director Joel Schumacher must be a very hated man. He is, after all,
responsible for single-handedly destroying the whole Batman franchise
with the embarrassing Batman & Robin. Is it fair, for Batman fans
everywhere, to say that Schumacher redeems himself with 8MM? Well,
perhaps not. And I suppose there is no form of redemption for making an
awful movie; that'll stay with you forever. But in its own right, the
new Nicolas Cage thriller 8MM is an excellent film.</P>
<P>The ordinary-man-suddenly-thrown-into-oblivion story has been told over
and over, both by excellent films (Enemy of the State, A Simple Plan,
The Man Who Knew Too Much) and not-so-excellent ones (In Dreams, etc.).
And, I suppose, 8MM is another of these films, but instead of it being
the whole movie, it uses that general storyline framework as a set-up
for bigger and better things. Cage plays Private Detective Tom Welles, a
loving husband dedicated to his profession, who spends most of his time
following around various adulterers and other such scum. So, it is
rather surprising to him when he is called in by the wife of a recently
deceased millionare. It seems that she has found a film in her husband's
safe that seems to depict a girl being brutally raped and murdered.
Welles' mission, which he chooses to accept, is to find out whether that
girl was really killed in that film.</P>
<P>He tackles the problem head-on by going to Cleveland and by visiting a
part of that city known as an adult entertainment heaven. He enlists the
help of an intelligent but destitute porn store clerk, Max, to acquaint
him with the dark world of hard-core pornography. He begins to dig deep,
and finds out that "snuff" films, a sort of "urban legend" in the porn
world really do exist. For the uninitiated (God, I hope there are many
of you out there), a "snuff" film is an unproffesionally made porno
where one of the stars is beaten and killed.</P>
<P>>From a technical perspective, this is a fine achievement. Filmed in
bleak, dark tones, 8MM is a beautifully moody picture, even if it
doesn't present any original concept in cinematography (and it didn't
have to, either). The movie's general style resembles that of last
year's A Perfect Murder in camerawork, lighting and tone.</P>
<P>As Welles submerges himself in this insane world, he begins to wrestle
with murderous instincts. But he is not a killer. At one point, in a
very powerful scene, he has to call a family member of one of the
victims to literally talk him into killing one of the villains.</P>
<P>Schumacher tries to touch on many philosophical concepts in 8MM. Some
work, some don't, but his movie is really notable for many very
suspenseful scenes, compelling action, and for building up a steady
rhythm that really draws the audience in. Cage gives a none-too-subtle
but still riveting performance as Welles, but his performance gets is
quite overstated if you watch closely.</P>
<P>8MM is quite graphic in terms of depiction of these "snuff" films, but
it manages not to stray into NC-17 category. Still, I would guess that
many people would find much of this film disturbing, and some might even
think of it as repulsive. But try and look beyond the violence. Welles'
reaction to everything he sees is quite real. The villains' motives as
depicted here are rather thought-provoking. When you really look, 8MM is
quite a restrained, even timid picture when you think about what it
could have been. Had it been an "exploitation" movie, much like the porn
that it's about, my reaction would have certainly been different.</P>
<P>Nor is this a preachy "porn is bad" movie, as a matter of fact 8MM does
not seem to be too concerned with porn. It seems to be trying to get a
message through our heads that has to do with criminality in general.
The notion that all criminals have a troubled past is what Schumacher
seems to be trying to disprove ("I do these things because I want to.
Because I like them"). Like last year's Enemy of the State, 8MM uses
action and violence for something other than simply displaying action
and violence.</P>
<P>This is Schumacher's breakthrough film, his first good one since Falling
Down. It's a comlpex achievement; exciting, sad and profound at the same
time. It's also one of the year's first pleasant surprises.
