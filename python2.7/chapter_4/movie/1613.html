                       A film review by Roger Snappy Rubio
                        Copyright 1992 Roger Snappy Rubio</PRE>
<PRE>BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA
Starring Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, Keanu Reeves, and
        Cary Elwes
Directed by Francis Ford Coppola</PRE>
<P>     Now I must admit I did read a lot about this movie before I went to
go see it; saw a lot of TV stuff on it, read about it in the newspaper,
read about it in magazines, even read another review about it (ack!  I
violated the ethics of all good reviewers).  So maybe I was a little
biased when I went in to see this movie.  Most movies like to embellish
or even enhance the image or the persona of the vampire in general, but
very few treat the vampire as a human being.  BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA
attempts to portray the vampire not only as a human being, but as a
tragic figure as well.  This attempted portrayal as both a human being
and a tragic figure is where I believe this film falls short.</P>
<P>     BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA is supposedly based on Bram Stoker's original
novel.  In the film story, Dracula is a knight called Prince Vlad the
Impaler, who comes home from battle only to find his beloved has killed
herself because she thought he was dead.  In his fury, he renounces God
and is banished to walk the Earth living only on the blood of others.
Four-hundred years later, he finds a woman who looks exactly like her,
and travels to London to see if she is the reincarnation of his beloved.
Of course, that's the story in a nutshell.  And I don't even know if
that's true to the original novel, for the following reason.</P>
<P>     I had heard through my 'biasing' foray to study this film before I
saw it that the screenplay was based on the novel, but during shooting
the actors pretty much had their way with the script.  Now I know movies
always allow for creative license, but I saw the original novel in a
bookstore with the movie's concrete logo on it, and another book based
on the SCREENPLAY with Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder on it.  Did they
change the story so much that they had to make a novel based on the
screenplay, or is this just some marketing technique to make more money?
Is this really Bram Stoker's incarnation or Hollywood's?  I would hate
to see Coppola stoop to Hollywood's level, even if he is bankrupt.</P>
<P>     I have no qualms with the movie as a whole--I hardly ever do when
Francis Ford Coppola is at the helm--but I believe this movie was a
little overdone.  Coppola tries so hard to pay homage to all the great
horror flicks of the past that in the process of paying tribute he
engages in overkill.  The same thing happened with THE GODFATHER PART
III.  This is not to say that it was not a great movie (in fact it's one
of the most beautifully filmed masterpieces I have ever seen) but did
you hear about the budget?  It was rumored at $60 million, mostly
because Coppola had to get the right shade of ivory for Al Pacino's
shirt and things like that.  The operatic climax at the end, while
trying to be suspenseful, dazzled the eye, but left the stomach settled.
And the ending!  The ending was fine, but I failed to feel as much as
the characters did.  GODFATHER III was a prime example of sentimentality
(in my humble opinion), and DRACULA is teetering on that edge.</P>
<P>     I think Coppola tried to do two things at the same time with
DRACULA.   He tried to make it a mainstream film, but at the same time
an art film.  In my opinion, mainstream movies leave everyone happy,
while art films leave everyone thinking.  BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA didn't
do either of these things to me, and that is where I think it falls
short.  But like I said, maybe I went into the movie biased by all I had
read and seen.  In my experience, most critics go into a movie to
criticize, not have any fun.  I try to temper my movie-viewing with a
little of both, but in this movie, I think I was left with more to
criticize than to have fun with.  The make-up was great, the story was
okay, and the acting ranged from dry to 'a-kid-in-a-candy-store'
eagerness, but it just didn't give me the chills or make me feel sad for
this poor creature stripped of his life and love.  It's great to look
at, but it's a little confused as to where it wants to go, and it
doesn't entertain.  At least it wasn't gratuitously bloody!</P>
