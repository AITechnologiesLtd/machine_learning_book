FISTFUL OF DOLLARS
(PER UN PUGNO DI DOLLARI)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Long time ago, I was in a used book store and stumbled upon
a scholarly book about westerns. The book covered all major
westerns up to 1975, but the chapter I had been interested
in was conspicuously short. The author gave only a lip
service to "spaghetti westerns", considering them to be
nothing more than the travesty of the genre. Validity of
such notion might be debatable, but not for the critics in
late 1960s and early 1970s, who had been seeing that genre
with the same snobbish disdain as blaxploitation or kung fu
movies. However, there was one director who had managed to
give "spaghetti westerns" good name. Sergio Leone is one of
the greatest and most influential Italian directors and his
films often considered to be masterpieces. That was
especially the case with three of his films known as Man
With No Name trilogy, which brought subgenre of "spaghetti
westerns" to the perfection. However, every beginning was
hard and FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, made in 1964, is a proof for
that.</P>
<P>Leone was often accused of not being too original in his
first major film. Plot of FISTFULL OF DOLLARS looks very
much like the one used in YOJIMBO, 1960 samurai classic by
Akira Kurosawa. However, even Kurosawa found his inspiration
elsewhere, and Dashiel Hammett's 1931 novel RED HARVEST is
often credited as the first one to use the same plot. Some
of the latter critics, on the other hand, claimed that Leone
found his inspiration in 18th century comic stage play by
Italian author Carlo Goldoni.</P>
<P>In any way, original or not, plot of this film begins when
Joe (played by Clint Eastwood), mysterious poncho-wearing
and mule-riding stranger, comes to San Miguel, small Mexican
town on US border. The town seems dead, and the reason for
that is soon revealed in the conversation with local
bartender (played by Joseph Egger). Town is ruled by two
gangs - Rojos brothers, liquor smugglers led by vicious
Ramon (played by Gian Maria Volonte) and Baxters, arms
smugglers nominally led by sheriff John Baxter (played by
Wolfgang Lukschy) and really by his wife Consuelo (played by
Margarita Lozano). Those two gangs are fighting for the
control, and the town is full of hired guns and killings
became part of every day life. Joe, being fast on the
trigger, sees that as an opportunity. He offers his
gunslinging services to both clans, switches sides and then
manipulates them into shootouts, earning lots of money in
the process.</P>
<P>FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, being the first Leone's spaghetti
western, is, naturally, inferior to his latter classical
works like THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. The cheap budget
is much visible, script seems rather unpolished and full of
some interesting plot holes (town on Mexican side of the
border having the sheriff is one of them). The acting at
times, especially during the ultra-sentimentalist scenes in
Marisol subplot, is plain terrible. The ending is weak,
sacrificing believability for the sake of the neat little
happy end.</P>
<P>On the other hand, even at his worst, Leone shows his
immense talent. Pacing is brilliant, scenes excellently shot
and his trademark of extreme close-up used with great
success. Black humour is also present in this film. And, of
course, Leone used services of great Ennio Morricone, one of
the best and most prolific music composers in the history of
cinema. Leone has, as he would do in all of his latter
films, used Morricone's score as the basis for his scenes,
and not the other way around. Morricone (billed as Dan Savio
on the credits) was here in his prime, using some of the
motives that would be enhanced and even more effective in
FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY.</P>
<P>Apart from Leone, this film was important for another great
talent. Clint Eastwood had already became famous in
TV-series RAWHIDE, but the role of The Man With No Name
(although actually named in this film) was the one that
launched him to orbit. Eastwood here plays one of the first
great antiheroes of cinema - tough, cynical and utterly
materialistic man who doesn't have any problems with money
through bloodshed. The audience roots for him not for the
sake of his moral superiority, but simply because he happens
to be much smarter and more successful than others. On the
other hand, Leone's script shows that under the mask of
cynicism lies kind human heart; Joe doesn't want to do the
right thing not because he is bad; he is pragmatic because
he knows better. And when actually does the right thing, he
suffers because of it.</P>
<P>Eastwood was the only major American actor in this film, but
that didn't prevent him for being partner with truly
talented actors. Gian Maria Volonte (billed as Johnny Wels)
is impressive as villain, and he would improve his villainy
in next Leone's film. This film also features whole bunch of
actors whose faces are more than familiar to the fans of
Leone's spaghetti westerns.</P>
<P>FISTFUL OF DOLLARS is definitely pale in comparison to other
films by Sergio Leone, but even such imperfect and inferior
example of that master's work should be recommended as very
entertaining film, even for those who are familiar with his
masterpieces.</P>
