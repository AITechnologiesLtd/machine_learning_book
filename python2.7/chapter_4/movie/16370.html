<PRE>Hope Floats (1998) 2 1/2 stars out of 4</PRE>
<PRE> Birdee Pruitt's life is a mess.</PRE>
<P> On a nationally televised daytime talk show, she learns that for the past
year her high-school sweetheart husband has been having an affair with
Birdee's best friend.</P>
<P> Shattered and humiliated, Birdee packs up her belongings and her daughter,
Bernice, and flees for home - Smithville, Texas.</P>
<P> Here, the former high school beauty queen seeks escape and solace, but
finds neither. Instead, her life grows even more complicated as she has to
deal with an eccentric mother whom she never really took the time to know,
a daughter who desperately misses her father and the prospect of a new
romance.</P>
<P> These are the paddles that turn the plot wheel of Hope Floats, a
two-hankie tearjerker, ably directed by Forest Whitaker and starring Sandra
Bullock, trying to make amends for Speed 2: Cruise Control.</P>
<P> Whitaker has a wonderful eye for composition, keeping his camera close to
the protagonists, giving the viewer an intimate picture of their
interactions.</P>
<P> Where Hope Floats goes wrong is in Bullock's interpretation of Birdee.
Bullock, who is also one of the movie's executive producer's portrays
Birdee as a wounded bird afraid of trying to fly from the nest.</P>
<P> Birdee spends most of the film moping about and complaining, dwelling on
the shambles that once was her life.</P>
<P> Birdee is a one-woman pity party, so much so that instead of feeling any
empathy for her, you want to grap her by the neck, give her and good shake
and berate her into moving on with her life.</P>
<P> Yet by the time Birdee does change course, spurred on by a family tragedy,
the movie is almost over.</P>
<P> Bullock makes a valiant attempt to elicit sympathy for Birdee. She
sprinkles humor throughout, but it's not enough to compensate for all that
comes before.</P>
<P> Whitaker, however, has surrounded Bullock with a fine cast and it is these
people, especially Mae Whitman as Bernice and the timeless Gena Rowlands as
Birdee's mother, who help carry the picture.</P>
<P> Whitman is a delight as the confused little girl forced into a situation
beyond her control or comprehension. She continually switches from berating
and sassing her mother to displaying her need for love and affection from
the parent who did not desert her.</P>
<P> Whitman's best scene is a heartbreaking encounter with her visiting father.</P>
<P> Rowlands has made eccentricity an artform. Her Ramona is a flamboyant,
Auntie Mame-like, larger-than-life Texan. Yet she is wise enough to see the
pain and suffering Birdee's continued wallowing is inflicting not only on
her daughter but on her granddaughter as well.</P>
<P> Harry Connick Jr. as Justin, the quiet man who wants to become part of
Birdee's life, gives a low-key performance. Without being pushy, he gently
tries to glide Birdee onto a new path through continual support and
displays of affection.</P>
<P> Hope Floats, at a little under two hours, moves gracefully, thanks to
Whitaker's wonderful eye for composition and detail. The director, as he
showed in Waiting to Exhale, has an affinity for actresses.</P>
<P> He elicits a textured performance from Bullock. She is the antithesis of
the usual perky characters she has played on screen. But in Hope Floats,
she goes a bit too far in the other direction, nearly becoming one of the
walking dead.</P>
<P> Still, amidst a summer of rampaging lizards and calamitous comets, Hope
Floats is a nice quiet respite.</P>
