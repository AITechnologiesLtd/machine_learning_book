<PRE>Godzilla (1998) 140m. </PRE>
<P>It's getting harder to stay ignorant.  In the mid-80s it was possible to 
see films like ET or GREMLINS without knowing what the effects-generated 
critters looked like beforehand.  It was a luxury that imbued these 
films with a sense of mystery and event.  Godzilla (the monster, not the 
movie) has been a different matter.  Toy catalogues, film reviews, 
television advertisements, and every other medium have been spewing out 
images of the Scaly One with such prevalence that sneak previews of the 
lizard itself are almost unavoidable.  And if it's not pics of Godzilla 
then it's the gossipy giveaways of the storyline, or the reviews that 
get released even before the movie makes it to the local multiplex.</P>
<P>I generally shut myself off from such spoilers, but this time around the 
tone of the local reviews has made itself quite clear: The lizard is a 
turkey; GODZILLA bites; the movie is a bomb.  So it was hardly 
surprising by the time I got to the cinema that the non-expectations I 
usually try to maintain had given way to very low expectations indeed.  
It was after seeing GODZILLA for myself, however, and thinking "This 
isn't that bad…actually it's fun", that I suddenly realized I had been 
missing the point all along: GODZILLA had been made specifically for an 
audience of middle-aged film critics!  Not the teenagers and families 
and SF/Fantasy/FX fans that filled the screening I had attended.  
They're not the target audience.  Obviously: they're not the ones 
writing the reviews.  How could I have been so blind?</P>
<P>I'm aware that this is an old argument, and that sarcasm is a shoddy 
platform on which to build it, but I don't see that it is any less true.  
Reviewing the reviewers, I discovered that every last grumpy 
reptile-hating one of them had been over the age of 45.  I would propose 
from this sample that this age henceforth be the point at which all 
critics in the public domain are reassessed, in much the same fashion 
that drivers licenses are renewed at certain age limits.  It's clear to 
me that there are quite a few current reviewers licenses that need 
serious re-examination, if not revoking.</P>
<P>It's clear also that the writing-directing-producing team of Roland 
Emmerich and Dean Devlin knew the kind of critical reception their 
popcorn movie would get, which explains why the film's most ineffectual 
character is a non-too-subtle lampoon of critic Roger Ebert, who had 
panned Emmerich and Devlin's earlier collaborations INDEPENDENCE DAY and 
STARGATE.  I wouldn't think they are singling Ebert out personally; it's 
just that he represents a critical homogeneity they resent.  The 
collective hostility of this faction will, I guess, be mainly directed 
to the contrast of two films, JURASSIC PARK and the 1956 GODZILLA.  It's 
true that GODZILLA poaches a lot of imagery from JURASSIC PARK and then 
simply amplifies it under its self-promoted precept 'Size Does Matter', 
but if you view it in terms of how Spielberg's film would look under the 
influence of a couple of bennies then I don't see how you can miss the 
trippy, demented fun of it all. If it's not a rush, it's still a ride.</P>
<P>It's the original GODZILLA, a cult movie with a huge following, that 
provides the more challenging comparison.  It was a landmark film of its 
type which established a new export market for Japanese films, but at 
the risk of offending all Gojira fanatics, I have never understood the 
appeal of the Toho-produced Godzilla films.  It was only when the 
momentum of the series reached DESTROY ALL MONSTERS, in which every 
available rubber suit was brought out of mothballs for one last 
free-for-all scrap, that I could appreciate the divine absurdity of it 
all.  Also going for the original was the large-scale destruction of 
Tokyo (Godzilla's a lot meaner in his first appearance) which, again, 
must have been impressive in 1956 - but isn't the destruction just as 
impressive in 1998, even taking into account the current sophistication 
of CGI?  And even the appeal of seeing cities flattened was lost in the 
original series when the studios realized it was a lot cheaper for 
Gojira and his cronies to slug it out in open countryside.  From this 
point on it simply became men in costumes wrestling each other, a trend 
which has still, mystifyingly, remained popular today with such shows as 
POWER RANGERS.</P>
<P>But finally, I suppose, it is the allegorical connection that critics 
will play as their trump card.  The original GODZILLA meant something: 
it was a national psyche which watched itself being destroyed over and 
over again, still smarting from the humiliation and disenfranchisement 
of losing the war and the traumatisation of genbaku-sho and other 
effects of the Holocaust.  How can the 1998 version compete with that?  
It can't, and it doesn't try.  Instead, it's a calculated, hypermarketed 
cash cow.  If Godzilla allegorizes anything , then it is the seemingly 
unstoppable power of the Hollywood money machine, trampling merry hell 
over all those who have grown out of its demographic.  GODZILLA becomes 
a battle of beasts; not just Ebert versus a lizard, but the Godzilla of 
film critics against the Godzilla of summer blockbusters.</P>
<P>At the end it appears I have not said one thing, good nor bad, about 
GODZILLA itself.  But that's okay.  It may leave you free to see it for 
yourself without any expectations.  And if you still have no idea what 
the monster looks like, I take my hat off to you.  By this stage that 
would be no mean feat.  But I should point out, however, that I still do 
not know what happens in the final episode of SEINFELD.  Beat that if 
you can.</P>
