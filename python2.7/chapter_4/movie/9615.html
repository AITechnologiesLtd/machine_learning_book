The Devil's Advocate
Starring:
Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron, Craig T. Nelson and Jeffrey Jones
Directed by Taylor Hackford
Running approx 140 min.</PRE>
<P>Taylor Hackford has crossed over to the Dark Side. Perhaps he has tiptoed his
way there with films like "An Officer and a Gentleman", "Against All Odds",
and "Dolores Claiborne", but with his latest "The Devil's Advocate", there is
no turning back. </P>
<P>He has assembled quite a fine group of talent for this twisted satire;
 Veteran Director of Photography Andrzej Bartkowiak, 8 time Oscar nominee Al
Pacino, and special effects and make-up guru Rick Baker. Bartkowiak is of
particular interest to this writer because of his extensive work with master
filmmaker Sidney Lumet. Baker is known for his work on "The Nutty Professor",
"Coming To America" and "Wolf" (as well as Michael Jackson's "Thriller"
video.)</P>
<P>Reeves stars as a Florida Assistant DA turned defense lawyer Kevin Lomax who,
after the realization of his client's guilt, decides to go for the gold and de
stroy a key witness on the stand in a cruel and heartless manner. His
unblemished record catches the eye of a major Manhattan law firm and it's
senior partner John Milton, played by Al Pacino. Reeves and his wife
(Charlize Theron, in a break-through role) are given the royal treatment and
a glorious appartment on the upper west side.  Lomax is the new ace of the
firm, aided without question by the mysterious Milton, and is given a triple
homicide trial. But as Lomax becomes more greedily involved in his case load,
his neglected wife witnesses gruesome and violent scenes, from
disembowelments to gruesome murders and flashes of demonic faces. Her visions
lead to insanity, and Lomax is forced to choose between  his wife and the
case. We realize that Milton is indeed Satan, and is controlling the lives of
this young couple, and virtually everyone else around him. (And Milton
spelled backward is Notlim...think about it.)</P>
<P>This bold and daring film makes a number of interesting statements, some more
 obvious than others. It is no mistake that attorneys are chosen to represent
evil here. They control the law, and the law controls us. But the movie is
telling us that evil easily appeals to our vanity, and that our egos will
give in. Even when we think we've managed to dodge it, or even stop it, evil
remains, lurking around the corner.</P>
<P>"The Devil's Advocate" is dangerously close to an NC-17 rating. The violence
is rather grotesque, but spread out in small amounts over two and a half
hours, and thus not terribly overdone. The full frontal nudity and graphic
sexual situations, though, rival that of any erotic piece of recent
filmmaking. Demi Moore would have needed a lot more than $12 million to
expose her breasts as long as some of the women in this film. Due to the
extensive and intense dialogue, the intriguing storyline and the beauty of
the cinematography (and again, a two and a half hour running time....) this
can't be categorized as a horror film, but it comes close. Don't bring your
10 year olds, folks.</P>
<P>Pacino gives a top-notch performance as Lucifer. His loud, over-the-top
actions that became so popular with his performance in "Scent of a Woman" are
brought out again, this time in a much more devious and cocky manner. Pacino
manages to get in a few chuckles from the audience as well. Indeed, this fine
actor is worthy of another Oscar nomination. And you can certainly win for a
bad-to-the-bone villian. Just ask Anthony Hopkins. Pacino certainly may once
again be nominated twice in the same year for an Academy Award. Recall his
performance as Lefty Ruggerio in "Donnie Brasco".</P>
<P>Reeves is trying so hard to show us that he really thinks he is a good actor,
and he certainly manages to impress now and again. But as happens so often,
the actor's power is lessened by his silly attempt at holding an
uncomfortable accent. Reeve's southern accent, though always slight, flutters
in and out so often, you just don't know who he is trying to be. This
inconsistency really knocks a few points off of an otherwise superb
performance. Theron plays Reeve's wife and may have just signed a letter of
intent for stardom. Her sexuality and porcelain doll face make her the
perfect victim for Satan to crush. Though she spends much of her time yelling
and crying, she does a perfect job of portraying her frustration at not being
able to communicate with her husband. Theron breaks to pieces in the film,
but does so slowly and methodically, and really gives a grade-A performance.
Jones and Nelson met with chuckles from the audience upon their first
appearance on-screen. Obviously, "Mr. Rooney" and "Coach" were the first
thoughts on the minds of many, but that shouldn't get in the way of these
fine performances.</P>
<P>This twisted tale of sexual depravity and omnipresent evil makes for a good
scare, and some deep thinking. Some of the visuals may be a bit harsh now and
again, but it isn't overbearing. The editing is astonishing throughout.
Mostly because it is so bad in some cases and so fantastic in others. But
Bartkowiak's and Hackford's camera work is brilliant and worth a second look.
The special effects are simple but un-aviodable. They make themselves
apparent in every effects scene, however they don't ruin a thing. Rick Baker
certainly leaves his mark. "The Devil's Advocate" doesn't need to be as long
as it is. (Yes, two and a half hours.) Fifteen minutes could easily have been
cut. But Pacino, Theron and even Reeves to some extent, as well as
Bartkowiak's masterful work, and the exceptional Art Direction, make this a
thrilling and creepy ride. It keeps you on your toes to the end. And when I
say "end" I mean the final shot. Don't leave to go to the bathroom. </P>
<P>Three out of Four stars.
