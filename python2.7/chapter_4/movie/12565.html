<PRE>THE BIG HIT</PRE>
<P>STARRING: Mark Wahlberg, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christina Applegate,
Avery Brooks, Bokeem Woodbine, Lainie Kazan, Elliott Gould WRITTEN BY:
Ben Ramsey DIRECTED BY: Che-Kirk Wong.</P>
<PRE>OVERVIEW</PRE>
<P> Melvin Smiley (Walhberg) can't stand anyone not liking him.  This is
strange considering Melvin is a professional hit man.  He has a Jewish
fiancée, Pam (Applegate) and a mistress.  The stress of these
radically diverse lifestyles clashing forces Melvin to drink Mylanta
out of the bottle daily.</P>
<P> He really wants to close down many of these problems but that would
mean hurting people he doesn't want hurt.  Course, you would think of
all the people he killed, most of their families probably don't like
him very much.  Now consider his partners, all of which take advantage
if easy-going demeanor.  One is Crunch (Woodbine) who has just
discovered masturbation.  In fact, he loves it so much, he has decided
to swear off women.  As a running joke, we constantly see him with
some hand gripper, continually pumping up.</P>
<P> Melvin's best friend is Cisco (Phillips), who uses his friends
vulnerabilities against him, even to the point of getting the bonus
from the last mission from their employer, Paris (Avery Brooks).</P>
<P> However, Cisco next job is personal.  He devised a plan to seal the
daughter of a famous Chinese millionaire and then ransom her for his
fortune.  Cisco cons his friends into joining, not knowing that this
kidnapping is unauthorized.  Complications further ensue when the
group discovers not only is the millionaire broke, swindling his money
on a film about himself, but that his daughter is the goddaughter of
Paris.</P>
<P> Soon, favors are pulled and without knowing the truth, Paris calls
upon Cisco to find the kidnappers.  Meanwhile, the daughter, Keiko
(China Chow), was held up at Walhberg's mistress's place but she soon
dumps him and the girl and his place, as Melvin is hosting a dinner
with his fiancée and her two very old-fashioned parents.</P>
<P> To cover his own rear, Cisco decided to frame his own group.  Melvin
also seems to have a crush on his kidnapped victim.  Keep downing that
Mylanta.</P>
<PRE>REVIEW:</PRE>
<P> The Big Hit is more a comedy than an action movie, as the tries to
make fun of itself as it tries to still maintain its own cliché's.
Meaning it seems to know the problems with today's action films but
does them anyway.  Melvin's character seems too one-sided; you can't
understand why he refused to tell some of these people off.  The
script tries to be funny, and it succeeds in many fields.  As an
action film, it doesn't fare well.  The action scenes are good except
there are infrequent and every stunt is in the commercial.  This
leaves very little left over for us to enjoy.  Luckily, the humor kept
me occupied.</P>
<P> Walhberg is convincing in his role and I especially liked Lou Diamond
Phillips.  In fact, there was no real bad acting in the film.  Yes,
Even Christina Applegate proved her worth.  I especially liked Avery
Brooks as a villain in comparison to his heroic Captain Sisko on Star
Trek: Deep Space 9.</P>
<P> The directing was good to, with interesting camera work in many
scenes.  One stand out shot shows Cisco smoking a cigarette.  As the
smoke falls from his fingers, the camera move up and past him
surprisingly fast-the cigarette still falling.  It moves right past
him, and follows another Paris.  It stayed in my memory as being very
clever.</P>
<P> Besides one or two scenes, The Big Hit is forgettable.  In one ear
and out the other.  The acting is good and the film tries, but it
still cannot break free of its own mold...even though, unlike other
films, it knows its fit and enjoys the comfort.  I jus wished it broke
out and explored new things in the genre.  The Last Action Hero was an
action film that poked fun of Hollywood action but it couldn't break
out of its own cliché.  The Big Hit is the same way, forced into
the creaks and crevices of the Hong Kong action-fest.  It acknowledges
its problems, but doesn't fix them.</P>
<PRE>PLUSES: +DIRECTING +ACTING</PRE>
<P>MINUSES: -LACKLUSTER PLOT -CORNY CLICHES</P>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2 Stars out of five</PRE>
<PRE>DEMOGRAPHIC:
You would
think this
films
would be
more
attractive
to younger
viewer.
It tries
to appeal
to its
teen
audience
by having
people
that this
generation
would
relate to,
but it
also adds
in some
inappropriate
violence
that
unfortunately
garners
its R
rating.</PRE>
