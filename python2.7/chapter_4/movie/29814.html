<P>  MARRIAGE OF THE BLESSED (Arusi-ye Khuban) (director/writer/editor: Mohsen
Makhmalbaf; cinematographer: Ali Reza Zarin Dast; cast: Mahmud Bigham (Haji), 
Roya Nonahali (Mehri); Runtime: 70; Farabi Cinema Foundation; 1989-Iran) </P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A film that is political in nature and very controversial for the Iranian
authorities to deal with, as it shows the effects of shell-shock and a mental
breakdown in a photojournalist returning from the frontlines of the Iraq-Iran
war. Haji (Mahmud Bigham) has been in a hospital mental asylum recovering from
the effects of the war explosives and the doctor dismisses him to go home and
recover, advising his family that he should seek a life of gaiety and should get
married. </P>
<P>Battling with his depression, Haji feels it's unlikely he will ever recover.
When his fiancée 
Mehri (Roya) feels he should just surround himself with pleasant things, he
instead is filled with images of starving children in Africa and of the images
that still haunt him when he covered the conflict in Lebanon. Her wealthy
merchant family does not approve of this marriage, but she is attracted to the
goodness she sees in him. </P>
<P>Returning to his newspaper, he's assigned to take photos of life in Tehran. He
is determined to take photos of the poor and the homeless, showing the failures
of the Islamic Revolution to eradicate poverty as promised and live up to their
ideals. This was a revolution the director was a supporter of, but has now
gotten into trouble with the censors because of his film's contents. What he
sees is that things are economically the same as before the revolution and this
is a slap in the face of the post-Khomeini government. When he presents these
human condition photos of all the poverty he sees in the city to his newspaper
editor, they are discarded and no newspaper will publish them. </P>
<P>To lift his spirits, Haji's fiancée rushes up their wedding plans against her
father's wishes. At the banquet he gives a solemn toast, dampening the
festivities as he says in repeated hysterical tones: "Eat the food robbed from
the poor--robbed food tastes best." </P>
<P>The film was unique, honest, raw, and daring. Makhmalbaf shows a great passion
for dealing with the ironies of modern Iran. </P>
