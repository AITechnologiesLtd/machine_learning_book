<P>     Ugh.  Director John Singleton's dramatization of a little-known
piece of Florida history-- when a black town was burned to the ground by
whites in 1923-- is this month's longest sit.  The padded (and often
predictable) plot is punctuated by increasing acts of violence and
racial hatred.  No, no punches are pulled, which makes for a history
lesson as unpleasant as it is important.  The technical credits are
strong, though, and there's a well-acted cast of non-compelling char-
acters.  (But what the Hell is mush-mouthed Michael Rooker doing here?
Here's barely intelligible as the local law.) Regrettably, the drama is
further diminished by the effect that this story is likely to have on
the more-reactive members of the audience.  Folks get worked-up in the
movie, folks get worked-up in their seats, and everyone ends up talking
back to the screen.  So, when the camera passes a young woman's corpse,
and someone behind you invariably yaps "she's dead!," be prepared to
turn around and shout "gee, do you think so?"</P>
