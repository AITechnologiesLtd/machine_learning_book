<P>It is the near future.  Ubiquitous genetic screening and engineering 
has divided society in two: the genetic gifted, their organic problems 
ironed out and their futures assured; and the "in-valids", those whose 
chromosomes make them a poor risk and suited for only menial labour.  
Vincent (Hawke) is the result of a natural birth, untouched by the 
genetic scalpel.  But he dreams of going to the stars and when chance 
comes to assume the place of the genetically perfect Jerome (Law) he 
jumps at it and enters the starfaring Gattaca corporation.  However a 
police investigation brought about by the murder of one of Vincent's 
new colleagues threatens his identity.</P>
<P>Films with broad themes often stumble, particularly those adapted from 
books.  The metaphors that can suspend disbelief in print, on film may 
appear exaggerated and cartoonish.  Recall "1984" and "Brave New 
World".  Thus, "Gattaca" is fighting an uphill battle.  Despite this, 
first-time director and writer Andrew Niccol has achieved something 
rather wonderful, a good looking picture with no glitzy special 
effects nor choreographed fighting but instead a thoughtful, 
intelligent air.</P>
<P>Perhaps he learnt his lessons well from predecessors.  The large 
echoing sets are reminiscent of Godard's "Alphaville" with their 
depiction of the future-as-present.  Conversely, the past-as-future 
gets a run (via "Bladerunner") in the details on the set.  Large 
finned sedans abound, Vincent's childhood home has an antique fridge 
(that I remember from a student shared household in the late 1980s), 
he reads worn handset books on astrogation.  The identical suited 
masses of the Gattaca corporation could come straight from 
"Metropolis" or "2001".</P>
<P>Neither Hawke nor Thurman are (yet) great actors, yet they are oddly 
suited to their roles.  Hawke's Vincent is an energetic dreamer whose 
optimism has been filed away to leave a repressed, fearful soul.  
Thurman (as Irene, a coworker of Vincent) has an alien look and manner 
suited to the genetically blessed.  The supporting cast is full of 
rather nice performances as well: Jude Law as an empty and angry 
genetic superman, Gore Vidal as a patrician bureaucrat ("I haven't a 
violent bone in my body," he sniffs, without being in anyway 
figurative), Alan Arkin as a grungy old-hand detective.  Resisting the 
Hollywood ploy of sprinkling one-liners through the script, "Gattaca" 
nevertheless slips in some sly humour.  Irene sneaks a hair of 
Jerome/Vincent's in for genetic analysis, and browses the resultant 
pages of polynucleotide strings like a womens magazine.  The dour 
police, anonymous in identical fedoras and grey trenchcoats, are 
dubbed "hoovers" - two jokes for the price of one.</P>
<P>Then we come to the heart of "Gattaca", the idea of rational 
discrimination.  When the frail child Vincent is turned away by a 
school - which can't afford the insurance in case something happens to 
him - their bias is completely sensible and still wrong.  (The 
parallels to HIV-positive children is irresistible.)  When he is 
refused a job because of his genetic profile, the action is entirely 
logical.  Despite his dedication and superb work-record, his true 
identity would lead to his firing.  You can't help but think about 
racism and sexism (and all the other "isms") and how one doesn't need 
prejudice - just unfeeling rationality - to support discrimination.  
If a system tipped in the favour of a particular class recruits the 
best candidates, it will select those like itself.  In "Gattaca" this 
is the genetically pure, for our own world white heterosexual males.  
And this requires not the slightest bigotry.  Perhaps the road to hell 
is paved not with good intentions, but with cold logic.</P>
<P>"Gattaca" leaves us much to think of on these lines, an issue that 
is highly relevant in an age rich with information and genetic 
technology.  Yet it does not look at this starry eyed.  Vincent 
sacrifices a lot, even something of himself, to reach his goals.  His 
victories are small, but touching.  I would be tempted to give 
"Gattaca" the highest score and recommendation, but two things prevent 
me.  First, it is perhaps slightly - just 10 minutes - longer than the 
material will bear.  Second, some viewers will find its slightly aloof 
air too remote to enjoy.  But otherwise it comes well recommended 
[***/interesting] and "I Heard the Owl Call My Name" on the Sid and 
Nancy scale.</P>
