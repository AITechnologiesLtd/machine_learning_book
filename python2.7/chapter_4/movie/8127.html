<P>Sneakers
Chad'z rating: ***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)
1992, PG-13, 126 minutes [2 hours, 6 minutes]
[thriller]
starring: Robert Redford (Martin Bishop/Brice), Sidney Poitier (Donald
Crease), Dan Aykroyd ("Mother"), Mary McDonnell (Liz), Ben Kingsley (Cosmo),
produced by Walter F. Parkes, Lawrence Lasker, written by Phil Alden
Robinson, Lawrence Lasker, Walter F. Parkes, directed by Phil Alden Robinson.</P>
<P>Most high-tech thrillers make the mistake of taking themselves too
seriously, so when the movie machine kicks in and the cliches pile up, no one
can enjoy the ride because the flaws are distracting. "Sneakers" is another
one of those flicks in premise, with lots of cool gadgets, computer hacking,
and amazing break-ins. However, it's lighthearted with a good distribution of
comedy and important themes to make for the adventure the other films try
for, but usually don't achieve.</P>
<P>Like most stories about government-level crime, this film uses some cliches
to establish its complicated story, but it's interesting and suspenseful and
you have to respect that. Two college buddies break into the government (both
physically and via computer) to electronically transfer funds to "more worthy
causes." When one (Martin) goes out for pizza, the other (Cosmo) is arrested.
The story then jumps to the present day as an older Martin (Redford) leads a
team of thieves who break into a bank.  We later learn they are actually
super security sneaks (if they can break into your place then it's definitely
not safe). </P>
<P>Martin's team is made up of five guys including: himself; Donald Crease
(Poitier), the stern ex-CIA guy; "Mother" (Aykroyd), a paranoid conspiracy
theorist; "Whistler" (David Strathairn), a blind man in tune to the sound of
electricity; and Carl (River Phoenix), a 19-year-old hacker who fits in
somewhere. These guys make for the generic spy team, but they have great
camaraderie, which is due to the clever, witty dialogue. Even when they argue
it's funny, which shows the film's humbleness - it knows it's a typical
thriller, but it doesn't knock you over the head trying to prove itself.</P>
<P>Although the mood is initially nice and light, the story becomes a bit more
complex than it needs to. National Security agents show up and tell Martin
they know about his past. They cut a deal, if he and his team perform a
slightly illegal operation for them (stealing a microchip which is supposedly
the ultimate code-breaker), his record will be erased and he can get his true
name back.</P>
<P>The second act is full of detail and typical thriller stuff with many
characters introduced and clues dropped about the story, as we eventually
realize there's something much bigger going on. Suddenly, we are just as
confused as the characters when everything we thought to be true turns out to
be wrong. </P>
<P>You probably wouldn't expect a film like this to make such great use of
mood, but it does through James Horner's cubist/jazz score, which makes the
atmosphere so dark you can feel it. Not to mention many key scenes which
become horrifically frightening because of their basis in reality. </P>
<P>Through a series of strange events Martin finds himself face to face with
his old friend Cosmo (Kingsley). Cosmo had orchestrated a massive conspiracy
in order to get the microchip (which explains the film's complexity), and
when he tells Martin the power it contains it is another example of the
film's ability to be moving even though it shouldn't be. </P>
<P>The final act involves a fantastic effort on behalf of the gang to pull off
a conspiracy of their own and steal back the microchip from Cosmo's highly
secured headquarters (a modern "fortress" if you will). Accomplishing their
mission is a difficult and delicate task, and although few errors crop up,
the suspense is so exciting, it more than makes up any distractions. The
ending is pretty much what you'd except, but because of the charm the film
had throughout, I didn't doubt it for a minute.</P>
<P>"Sneakers" is a great adventure that could have been even better. It
incorporates computers in a realistic, believable manner and poses many
relevant theories regarding their use and importance. It's not often we get
commercial movies as well crafted and moving as this one. </P>
