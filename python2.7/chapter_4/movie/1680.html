<PRE>                              SCENT OF A WOMAN
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  SCENT OF A WOMAN is slick and well-
     made, making 157 minutes seem like a lot less.  It makes the
     audience feel all the right emotions at the right turns.  But
     ultimately there is less here than meets the eye.  While the
     last fifteen minutes will please some, the same segment will
     strike others as pat and contrived.  Rating: high +1 (-4 to
     +4).</PRE>
<P>     Curiously, SCENT OF A WOMAN is a film of a man's journey from childhood
to adulthood.  Charlie Simms (played by Chris O'Donnell) goes to a very
upper-class private prep school where the nicest kids are super-snobs and
most others are worse.  Charlie has two problems over Thanksgiving weekend.
In the days just before Thanksgiving he saw some students setting up a prank
that went very wrong.  Now the administration is using both a big carrot and
a big stick to pry out what Charlie knows.  His other problem is Lt. Colonel
Frank Slade (played by Al Pacino).  Charlie has been hired to care for Slade
over the weekend.  Slade is very much like the Jack Nicholson character in A
FEW GOOD MEN, but now a blind alcoholic who hates the world.  What makes the
story curious is that it is Slade who must make the journey to adulthood.
Charlie learns a different lesson, that of seizing opportunity.</P>
<P>     Charlie's job is just simple baby-sitting, but Slade has other ideas.
He drags Charlie to New York City on a mission of Slade's own planning.  As
you could predict, the two men who start by hating each other have
adventures together and learn to respect and admire each other.  Their
togetherness is just what each turns out to need, to nobody's surprise.</P>
<P>     Much has been said about how good Pacino's acting is in SCENT OF A
WOMAN, but in fact he seems to overpower every sentence he speaks.  Like his
character, he forces himself to be the center of attention in every scene
where he appears.  If Chris O'Donnell is remembered for the film, it is for
the scenes where Pacino did not appear.  Incidentally, this film also
exploits the myth that blind people seem to develop their other senses to
super-human levels.  Pacino's Slade can judge the quality of a salute
without actually seeing it.  He also can identify the perfume and even the
soap a woman uses, hence the title of the film.  Bo Goldman's screenplay has
good dialogue but ultimately falls into the not uncommon cinematic irony of
pulling all the familiar strings and pushing all the familiar buttons to
tell the audience not to let themselves be manipulated nor should they
manipulate others.  I give this SCENT OF A WOMAN high +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
