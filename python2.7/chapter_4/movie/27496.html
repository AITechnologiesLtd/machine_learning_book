<P>   People still marry largely on the basis of the chemistry they
feel during their courtship period.  In other words, hormones
rule.  But if hormonal changes go southward at a fortunately
gradual pace, the initial half-crazed passion of two lovers is
bound to fade somewhat after a year or two--which is good,
because if people felt toward each other the way they did
while first discovering each other's bodies, nothing much of a
mundane nature could get done.</P>
<P>   With "The Price of Milk," New Zealand filmmaker Harry
Sinclair ("Topless Women Talk About their Lives")
investigates a similar phenomenon, which is, how do you
know that the person you are about to marry really and truly
loves you in the first place?  The obvious answer is to test
that love.  In medieval times, the nobility would prove their
affection by drinking fair maiden's bathwater out of her
slipper, but in New Zealand, the pixies are relied on more
frequently.  In this fairy tale, in fact, Auckland-born director
Sinclair positions a couple, Rob (Karl Urban) and Lucinda
(Danielle Cormack) amid the rolling hills of his country, pretty
much a unit unto themselves except for their heads of dairy
cows and an agoraphobic dog named Nigel (Pirate).</P>
<P>   Rob is a natural as a dairy farmer, possessing $400,000NZ
or cows who reply to his greeting of "good morning" every
day with a chorus of thunderous moos.  His girl friend,
Lucinda, appreciates Rob's talent with the animals but
despite their passion under the sheets (or in this case under
a colorful quilt), she wonders whether his affection toward her
is at least as much as his attractive to the bovine.  As quickly
as you can say "Taumarunui," Lucinda literally runs into the
fabulous Auntie (Rangi Motu), who because of a lack of
heating in the boonies needs as many quilt blankets as her
golf-crazed nephews can produce.  When Auntie's Maori
nephews steal the blanket in the dead of night, Lucinda is
required by Auntie to swap her most valuable possession to
get the comforter back.  The tradeoff leads to a severance of
her relationship with Rob, who is seduced by Lucinda's so-
called best friend Drosophila (Willa O'Neill).</P>
<P>   Despite the unobtrusive but effective presence of an
enchanted soundtrack produced by the Moscow State
Orchestra, this "Milk" is frightfully skimmed.  Though Danielle
Cormack sports long, curly locks giving her the appearance of
a Rapunzel. and conveys her naivete by widening her eyes
as though as student of Rodney Dangerfield, she is
unappealingly masculine.  One can easily see what the
comely Karl Urban sees in the competition. Though Willa
O'Neill's Drosophila drives a wreck of a car, she has far more
charm and allure. The real trouble, though, is in the script,
which comes across as though Mr. Sinclair simply allowed
the ensemble to improvise and settled for the first take in
each scene.  If it's true that only a Western urban audience
can appreciate the humor of the highly metropolitan Woody
Allen, then perhaps logically enough the waggery allegedly
present in a pastoral "The Price of Milk" became shipwrecked
somewhere in the Tasman Sea.</P>
