<PRE>.                               ROUNDERS
                      A film review by Bradley Null
                       Copyright 1998 Bradley Null</PRE>
<P>     Eighty bucks.  That's about how much money I've lost playing poker
since I saw ROUNDERS.  Not that this statistic is an inherently bad sign for
the movie or anything.  In fact, the fact that I was so motivated by the
movie to put all that money on the table speaks positively of the picture.</P>
<P>     ROUNDERS (the name is short-hand for people who make their living
playing poker) stars Matt Damon and Edward Norton as poker playing buddies
going in different directions.  Damon, after losing a VERY big money hand,
has given up his cardsharping ways for law school and a career as a lawyer. 
Norton, on the other hand, just out of prison, is eager to build a new
bankroll at the tables.  As you might expect, for a number of reasons, Damon
cannot stay away from the table forever, and consequently his budding law
career and relationship with newcomer Gretchen Mol are both put in peril. 
The trouble Norton's character (not so subtly nicknamed Worm) gets into does
nothing to make Damon's life easier.</P>
<P>     Director John Dahl (THE LAST SEDUCTION) and the film's writers
glamorize the world of professional poker playing from the outset, so be
wqrned.  If you don't feel that you can sympathize with trials and
tribulations of professional gamblers, this film is probably not for you. 
If on the other hand, you are like me, and not only revere the strategy,
psychology and probability of gambling, but also dabble in it from time to
time, you will probably be drawn in and (hopefully not) inspired by this
film.  (You'll still probably need to reference the poker glossary on the
film site's webpage.)  Just don't let it make you think you are a better
poker player for having seen the film.  Trust me, you're not.</P>
