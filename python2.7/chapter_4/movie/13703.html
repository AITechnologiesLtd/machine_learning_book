<P>   Ever since the first Flintstone clubbed his buddy on the
head over a woman some 2 million years ago, the world has
been plagued by power politics.  In the 1990s, we're more
civilized.  We use words instead of clubs.  Our willingness to
do damage to our fellows on the job over our business status
was wonderfully interpreted by Neil LaBute in last year's "In
the Company of Men," a picture which aroused many in the
audience to want to throw clubs and stones at the screen.  "In
the Company of Men" featured a struggle between two co-
workers, drinking buddies in fact, over possession of a high-
status position in an office.  Now, office politics takes a back
seat to bedroom management in LaBute's "Your Friends &
Neighbors," a movie which implicitly asks, "Wouldn't you love
to spy on the folks next door with a hidden video camera?" 
LaBute appears to say that you're not so likely recognize the
bland, hale-fellow sports you greet every day like the folks in
"The Truman Show," but are more likely to discover that their
everyday demeanor is just a pleasant act--as it is to the
players in that Peter Weir film.</P>
<P>   As with "In the Company of Men," LaBute's latest effort
comes across not so much like a filmed play: that would be
deadly.  Rather, it's the sort of tale to which the stage could
do equal justice.  Whereas "Company" featured three players,
"Friends" juxtaposes six people, three of each gender, and
sets them off on a sexual roundelay exposing their intense
needs, their vulnerabilities, their willingness to betray even
best friends to satisfy their cravings.  Freud was right: libido is
everything.  Just observe the opening scene, featuring college
theater instructor Jerry (Ben Stiller) re-enacting a sexy
Elizabethan scene with a student to the appreciative eyes of
his adoring students.  "What do these characters want?" he
asks the class after thrusting up his partner's frilly skirt. 
"Sex."  Life follows art which follows life in Neil LaBute's
remarkable script which he directs sharply, satirically,
humorously.  "Friends and Neighbors" has a looser structure
than its predecessor, as the six-member cast frenetically
switch alliances.  But LaBute's edginess is present virtually at
every moment.</P>
<P>   The six friends and neighbors are: Cary (Jason Patric), who
works out with his pals Jerry (Ben Stiller) and Barry (Aaron
Eckhart); Cheri (Nastassja Kinski), who meets the others
while serving as an artist's assistant in a posh gallery; Mary
(Amy Brenneman), who is unhappily married to Barry; and
Terri (Catherine Keener), who is unhappily living with Jerry. 
Though the six frequently interact, they are quite different
from one another in temperament.  Terri is hard-shelled and
cynical; Cary is intensely hostile to the women he beds and is
fond of making tapes of his sexual banter; Mary is a gentle
soul constantly at the verge of weeping; Jerry is talkative and
analytical to a fault; Cheri is arty and desperate for a
significant relationship with someone of either gender; and
Barry has the appearance of a jock gone to seed--plump,
mustachioed and bewildered.  (Aaron Eckhart, who plays this
last character, turned in a dynamite performance as the
hostile and manipulative Chad in LaBute's previous work.  For
this role he gained quite a bit of weight, bleached his hair,
and comes across as a wholly different personality.)</P>
<P>   While no one on the street would begin to guess the
neuroses that plague each one, the movie hones in on the
unrequited needs that drive all to unstable frenzy.  Jerry, for
example, is looked up to by his students, a dynamic and
highly competent teacher.  But he has unbridled chutzpah. 
Soon after breaking bread with his live-in woman, his best
friend Barry and Barry's wife Mary, he corners Mary to ask
her whether he can call her.  Breaking the taboo against an
intimate relationship with your best friend's wife, he
rationalizes: "You're married to Ben...OK he got there first...It's
not a big deal."  Mary is shocked but accepts.  She does not
yet know that Jerry is despised by his mistress for--among
other things--talking incessantly during sex.  Seeking a
partner who does not talk while in bed, Jerry's wife winds up
with Cheri, Barry remains unable to perform appropriately with
Mary, and Cary, not satisfied with his one-night stands, comes
on in an extraordinarily hostile and shocking way to Terri.</P>
<P>   As the film comes to a close, Jerry is involved in a dress
rehearsal of a play by William Wycherley, presumably that
Seventeenth-Century playwright's "The Country Wife." 
Wycherley's London is inhabited exclusively by hookers, flirts,
cuckolds and seducers, with one character, Horner, feigning
impotence in order to have a go at women without their
husbands' suspecting the worst.  Neil LaBute indicates that
we have not progressed one iota from Wycherley's vision. 
With his latest film, slickly and slyly acted by a company of
men and women, he proves himself a writer-director with his
fingers on the contemporary--and timeless-urban pulse.</P>
