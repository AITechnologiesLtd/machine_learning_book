<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A well-crafted submarine psychological thriller, from a novel by Richard
Sale. Lt. Cmdr. Barney Doyle (Glenn Ford) is the hard-nosed,
no-nonsense, taciturn submarine commander, who is considered by the
higher-ups to be the most competent submarine captain in the South
Pacific Islands. The story begins just before WW11 and is set in 1942 in
the Pacific. Barney's second-in-command is his long-time and loyal
friend, Lt. Archer Sloan (Ernest Borgnine), who is honest to a fault.
Archie is someone who has risen from being an enlisted man to his
present position, who is awaiting a command of his own.</P>
<P>On leave, Barney and Archie visit with Barney's wife Jane (Diane
Brewster), who was born in Manilla, where the couple now live with their
young daughter. Expecting war to break out soon, Barney implores his
wife to leave Manilla, but she insists on staying, saying she can take
the family and the servants to the hills if Manilla was invaded. Just
before Barney leaves, he is informed about the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor.</P>
<P>Out at sea for the next 10 months, Barney learns that the Japanese
invaded Manilla and overtook it. He later on learns from Admiral Setton
(Philip Ober), who is head of operations for the Pacific, that his wife
and child are in an internment camp. The good news being, is that they
are alive. Meanwhile, he is on a mission to get the Japanese destroyer
that led the attack on Pearl Harbor. This mission is classified as
top-priority by the navy. Barney's "Greyfish" submarine locates the
Japanese destroyer in Tokyo Bay and breaks through the netting to pursue
it, the first time an American submarine was in these waters during the
war.</P>
<P>But Admiral Setton learns through intelligence some bad news, that all
1,400 prisoners from the internment camp were placed on a freighter,
which will act as a screener for the chased destroyer. With the news
sinking in fast that his wife and child are aboard the freighter, Barney
must make a decision whether to fire or not on the prize aircraft
carrier that he locates, as Archie tells him not to, that the odds are
remote of hitting it, and are almost a certainty of hitting the
freighter. Barney makes the impossible decision in a flash and his
submarine releases two torpedos. To Barney's dismay, the torpedoes hit
the freighter sinking it. He even refuses to go after any survivors,
figuring the destroyer is using that freighter as bait to torpedo his
submarine. No one will question Barney Doyle's patriotism.</P>
<P>Barney visibly shaken and tense, knowing his family is dead, becomes
obsessed with getting the destroyer. To the film's credits, Ford's
performance is well-mannered and credible. The action scenes of the
eventual show-down between the rivals, makes for exciting cinema. It was
also a good idea to show how much the captain cared for his family by
showing in flashbacks how their relationship evolved. What weakened the
story somewhat, is all the self-congratulations that kept being passed
around among the higher-ups, with everyone a man of his word and a team
player. It was hard to believe that everyone who wore a navy uniform
could be that perfect. Thereby a certain banality crept in to this
otherwise compelling presentation. As for submarine type action films,
this one as for human drama far outweighs the recently released U-571,
and also for authenticity, acting, and suspense. The only thing the
newer version has over this submarine flick, is that it makes good use
of how far the technology has come, as its digital special effects take
full-advantage of that.</P>
