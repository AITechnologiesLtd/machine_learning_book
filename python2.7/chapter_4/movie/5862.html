<PRE>                               ESCAPE FROM L.A.
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Walking into the theater, I was expecting a teched-up sequel to the 15
year old "Escape From New York". Seeing only four people seated, I
should have guessed that the word of mouth wasn't phenomenal. After the
first few minutes of the film, I could see why.</P>
<P>The earlier film, also starring Kurt Russell and directed by John
Carpenter, featured a post-apocalyptic NYC turned into a prison island
populated by off-beat an colorful gangs. Tough (but lovable) Guy Snake
Plissken (Russell) is recruited by the powers that be to rescue the
President who crash landed in the middle of the mess. To keep Snake on
track, he is booby-trapped so that if he doesn't deliver the Prez within
a time limit, he dies.</P>
<P>Once inside the city, our antihero locates the chief executive and
fights his way out, guns a'blazing. Zillions of bullets zoom towards
Snake with his name on them, but he emerges virtually unscathed, ready
to deal with the governmental double-cross.</P>
<P>Why talk so much about the original? The plots of both films are nearly
identical. Substitute New York with "Los Angeles after the big one" and
President with "President's daughter and mysterious black box" and
you've got "Escape From LA".</P>
<P>In this version, the Christian right has taken over the country and
sentenced the whores, atheists, meat-eaters and smokers to LA. It's
debatable which side of the wall is the actual prison. If it weren't a
deportation facility, it would be marketed as the perfect vacation spot.
Like many films with Roman numerals in their titles, this is no sequel.
Sequels continue the story: this is more of a re-make. Even worse, this
is a shabby re-make.</P>
<P>The original gave us an occasionally humorous, entertaining action film
where the effects worked even though some things didn't make sense. Now
that they've spent six times what the first one cost, we get an
over-the-top tedious movie with badly done models and poor computer
animation where nothing makes sense.</P>
<P>There are attempts at humor. If you think that Snake Plissken and Peter
Fonda surfing a tsunami down Wilshire Boulevard while trying to catch up
with a convertible sounds hilarious, this may be the film for you.
Russell does as much as he can with his Clint Eastwood impression and is
the only thing consistently worth watching. On the other hand, Carpenter
should be ashamed. Perhaps his next movie should be "Escape From Bad
Films".</P>
