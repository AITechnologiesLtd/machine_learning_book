<P>   Who do you think would fare better...a 21st Century New
York City resident suddenly transported 800 years into the
future, or a 12th Century European conveyed about the same
number of years into today's Chicago?  This question might
conceivably pop into the minds of the audience for "Just
Visiting," and in fact is probably the only thought that would
stimulate the brain in a movie which, despite good intentions
and a couple of superior performances, is overwrought with
pratfalls and dated slapstick humor.  We can only guess what
this country would be like in the year 2801, but since modern
time travelers presumably know how to read and have kept
up on books like Alvin Toffler's "Future Shock," they might be
in awe of what they see but would not react to the culture as
do the folks in Jean-Marie Gaubert's film.</P>
<P>  A re-make of Jean-Marie Poire's 1993 French blockbuster,
"The Visitors"--which broke all sorts of records in its home
country--"Just Visiting" introduces Americans allergic to
foreign films with English subtitles to the broadly comic tale of
a reluctant tourist who agrees to swallow a wizard's potion in
order to keep his head on straight after killing his intended
bride, Rosalind, while under the influence of a sorcerer's
LSD-like concoction.</P>
<P>  Jean Reno and Christian Clavier relive the roles that
charmed the French eight years ago, this time speaking a
perfectly good English with a delightful Gallic accent.  Reno,
introduced to a broad cross-section of American moviegoers 
in the action-adventure thriller "Ronin," shows his mettle (so
to speak) as a knight in shining armor, specifically the Count
Thibault, who drags around a wide-eyed, Sancho-Panza-like
servant Andre (Christian Clavier--who co-write the script to
both this version and the original French interpretation). 
About to wed the fair Rosalind (Christina Applegate), he
becomes the victim of a plot by an envious earl who is
himself seeking Rosalind's hand.  Having stabbed his fiance
to death while under the influence of this villain, Thibault
escapes the executioner by swallowing a flawed potion
administered to him by a wizard (Matthew McDowell) and
together with his paunchy servant lands in a Chicago
museum where he springs to contemporary life.  By a
pleasant coincidence, he meets up with Julia (Christina
Applegate in her modern guise) who he believes is his bride
only to realize after much coaching that she is his
descendant thirty generations removed.  Eager to get back to
his own time--since failing that, Julia would never have been
born--he sprints and travels up and down Michigan Avenue
and environs by foot and on horseback seemingly
unencumbered by his iron getup and immense sword.  The
one-joke film is essentially a series of skits based on his
misadventures in the magic land that would draw millions of
others from his home continent to its shores.  By the
conclusion of the story, Thibault learns the meaning of
humility, his servant Andre the essence of freedom--while
these medieval wayfarers ironically teach the lovely Julia,
bullied by her browbeating boyfriend Hunter (Matthew Ross),
the meaning of women's liberation.</P>
<P>   "Just Visiting" appears targeted to a youthful audience,
given its predilection for pratfalls and fondness for faux pas. 
During the course of the journey, Thibault and Andre trash
the most formal restaurant in Chicago where Andre
consumes chicken a la umbrella, eat "mints" used to
deodorize a urinal, use a $2,000 bottle of Chanel #5 as bath
oil and generally proves that the last thing most modern
women would want is a knight in shining armor...most
women, that is, but not the newly emancipated Julia or her
gardener neighbor Amber (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras), who
develops a crush on the peasant.  The pratfalls become
repetitious, but Christina Applegate surprises as a performer
who has retained the good looks that charmed admirers of
the ribald and usually hilarious TV series, "Married...with
Children."  Happily, with just eighty-eight minutes to gross us 
out, these visitors do not overstay their welcome.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 88 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
