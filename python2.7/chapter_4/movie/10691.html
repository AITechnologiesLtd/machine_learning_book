<PRE>THE BOXER (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Jim Sheridan
Writers: Jim Sheridan and Terry George
Starring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Emily Watson, Brian Cox, Ken Stott, Gerard
McSorley, Ciaran Fitzgerald, Elanor Methaven, Kenneth Cranham</P>
<P>Contrary to the title, "The Boxer" is not another Rocky story only this
time spliced with some cold hard politics.  It's actually three movies
in one: a political film, a boxing film, and a love story.  All of these
work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt
the three elements of the story, but somehow it seems kind of cliched
and unoriginal.  We've seen it all before, and we're just not blown away
with it like we should be.  Oh well.  It's still an excellent irish
story.</P>
<P>"The Boxer" of the title is Danny Flynn (Jim Sheridan staple Daniel
Day-Lewis), an ex-IRA member who gets out of a Belfast prison after 14
years, and finds out that his troubles are far from over.  First off,
the IRA is having a small civil war between its leader Joe Hamill (Brian
Cox), and one of its sub-leaders, Harry (Gerard McSorley), both having
opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail.</P>
<P>While this is going on, Danny and his old drunkard buddie, Ike (Ken
Stott, who played the chief inspector in Danny Boyle's "Shallow Grave"),
re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects,
Protestant and Catholics, to work together.  Danny not only begins
teaching kids how to box, but has stayed in great shape whilst in
prison, and is ready to start boxing real people again.</P>
<P>And Danny runs into his ex-love, Maggie ("Breaking the Waves"'s Emily
Watson), who hasn't seen him since he went in.  They don't easily start
up their romance again because she's the wife of a prisoner whom she
married during Danny's tenure in prison, and also has a son, Liam
(Ciaran Fitzgerald), from him, whom Liam is hoping will get out soon. 
But the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again, and this begins to
complicate things.</P>
<P>The political story is nothing really special but works in itself. 
We've seen it many a time before, but it's at least interesting,
sometimes emotional, and even riveting at times.  There's a big riot
towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and
honesty.  The boxing story is very minor to the story, but does
represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly, and even
with good sportsmanship.  There are only a few boxing scenes, but
they're never like "Raging Bull"/let's-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones
brilliant.  They're more realistic, and instead of bone crunching, we
hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother, which is slightly
unerving at times.  And I didn't know Daniel Day-Lewis was in such good
shape.</P>
<P>But the backbone of the story is the love one.  Because these characters
are given such horrible circumstances, and since the two leads have such
great chemistry together, we really feel for their plight.  As the film
goes on, and circumstances get worse and worse, the characters have to
make real human decisions, and we can sympathize with them as humans not
characters.  This is how you write a love story - take note, Hollywood.</P>
<P>These elements are pretty much equally balanced, with each of the parts
of the stories working hand-in-hand with eachother.    I loved how each
of the different parts of the plot mattered, and sometimes spilled over
into the next.  It made sure that we didn't just care for one of them. 
I'm not saying they're all equally great, because the love story really
carries the film, but at least they all work out respectively.</P>
<P>The acting is amazing, with Day-Lewis and Watson giving excellent
performances and showing great chemistry.  I'm not sure if they're
Oscar-nominee bound, but they're very good.  In the supporting roles,
Billy Cox is greatly sympathetic as the IRA leader losing control of his
daughter and his workers.  But the film is stolen acting wise by Ken
Stott as Ike, who is just a great scene stealer.</P>
<P>The direction and co-writing by Jim Sheridan (with the other co-writing
credit going to Terry George) is excellent, rounding out the characters
well, but not pacing everything greatly.  I noticed that the first half
was very leisurely (yet fascinating), but the second half whirls by at a
quick pace, and ends much too quickly.  More time could have been spent
thinking up the ending, since it does seem quite sloppy.</P>
<P>Though "The Boxer" is a good film, it never achieves the greatness that
it should.  Sure, it's a masterpiece compared to most of the Hollywood
drivel we usually get, but on it's own, it just could have been better. 
But it still works out, gives us a great love story combined with a
political and boxing drama, and features great acting.  Even if it could
have been better, this'll do.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
