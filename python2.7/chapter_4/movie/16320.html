<P>Enemy of the State, starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight
2 1/2 stars out of 4</P>
<P> Depending on your level of paranoia, you will either scoff at Enemy of the
State or check your toothbrush, smoke alarm, cell phone and various items
of clothing to see if Big Brother is indeed monitoring every moment of your
life.</P>
<P> Enemy of the State builds upon the concept that ours, because of video
camera, spy satellites and other technological marvels, is a world in which
privacy is a quickly becoming an illusion.</P>
<P> As chief villain Jon Voight explains, soon the only privacy will be what's
in your head.</P>
<P> As the film opens, a congressional committee is looking at a bill that
will allow the government to conduct unfettered surveillance of its
citizens. After all, supposedly lots of people out there - in and out of
the country - hate the United States and its way of life and want to
destroy it. Thus the justification for the bill's passage.</P>
<P> To get what he wants, Voight, a top government official, resorts to
murder. Unbeknownst, at least at the outset, to Voight and his team of
techno-nerds, is that the crime was caught on tape.</P>
<P> This discovery sets off a chain of events that eventually involves Robert
Dean (Will Smith), a labor lawyer whose life is turned upside down - and
for most of the proceedings he doesn't even know why.</P>
<P> It seems he was slipped a copy of the incriminating footage copied onto a
computer disk, and Voight's operatives are trying to retrieve it wouth
tipping their hands.</P>
<P> What makes Enemy of the State work, and it does up until the last reel, is
the little voice it sets off in the back of your mind. Sure, it's fiction,
a movie.</P>
<P> But, does the government have the capabilities to watch our every move,
and if it does, are we being spied upon right now.</P>
<P> The movie plays off the now common usage of video cameras everywhere - in
restaurants, department store changing rooms, sky cams, cameras that
monitor busy intersections.</P>
<P> Do they all feed into a mainframe somewhere that the government can log
onto the check up on us? Possible, but highly, improbable. Or is it?</P>
<P> Eventually Dean teams up with a former operative (Gene Hackman) and all is
made right with the world - or at least Dean's portio of it.</P>
<P> Director Tony Scott keeps the paranoia level high, continually showing
scenes of a spy satellites being moved around merely to spy on one
individual, while his operatives plant bugs and transmitters on Dean's
clothes, shoes, phone and pen.</P>
<P> But eventually Scott and and his four screenwriters run out of imagination
and resort to a ludicrious finale involving a stereotypical Mafia boss, who
acts like a grade Z Don Corleone.</P>
<P> This nearly destroys all the nearly one hour and 45 minutes that lead up
to this point.</P>
<P> Smith works very well as the confused, but determined lawyer who is in
over his head, and completely unaware of the machinations going on around
him.</P>
<P> As in Independence Day and Men in Black, Smith works best when paired with
an older, more experienced actor. In ID4 it was Jeff Goldblum, Tommy Lee
Jones created chemistry in Men in Black, and in Enemy of the State, Smith
teams with Hackman, as a disheveled, semi-paranoid ex-operative who helps
Dean regain his life and in the process, gets one for himself.</P>
<P> The real treat is watching the young supporting actors who play Voight's
team of computer nerds who treat the entire affair as if it the planet was
their own private video screen and we were all pawns they could move around
in a game of life and death.</P>
<P> They're not evil, per se, just deadened. They have lost their humanity to
their computers and are either unconcerned or unaware of the havoc they
wreak.</P>
<P> Enemy of the State is a colorful political thriller. You may find it
perposterous or you may think it hits too close to him - maybe too close.
Either way, after seeing it, you'll be more conscious of the technology
surrounding you.</P>
