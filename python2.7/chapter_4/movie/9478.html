<PRE>ON DEADLY GROUND (1994)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Steven Seagal
Writers: Ed Horowitz and Robin O. Russin
Starring: Steven Seagal, Joan Chen, Michael Caine, John C. McGinley, R.
Lee Ermey, Billy Bob Thornton</P>
<P>Martial arts master Steven Seagal (not to mention director!) has built a
career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who
never gets hurt in fights, talks in a hushed tone, and squints at any
sign of danger.  He's also the most consistent individual in Hollywood
today, since all his movies suck.  They basically represent his
egotisitical tendencies about his art (that is, martial art).  I'm sure
the guy's good, and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows, although a
tad haughty, but these movies he makes are all the same: a guy who is
basically indestructable, is maybe wounded supposedly mortally, then
comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses
(although I kinda liked "Under Siege").  Of course, this one, as a
change, has a "message" that is drilled into our mind...of course, after
he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people.</P>
<P>So why do I watch his crap?  I usually don't.  I will never, and you can
hold me to this, I will NEVER pay to see this man's movies, unless, and
only unless, he's in a supporting role (i.e. "Executive Decision") and
I'd definitely pay if he dies (i.e. "Executive Decision").  But this one
has a special place in my heart.  This doesn't mean it's good or that I
even liked it.  This was the last movie I watched with my deceased
uncle, and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la "Mystery
Science Theatre 3000," and this was a couple years before I had heard of
"Mystery Science Theatre 3000."</P>
<P>In this one, Seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in Alaska
and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain, this time played by
an Oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - Michael Caine.  It
seems that Caine wants to do something with his oil factory that
includes him dumping oil all over Inuit land.  Around the 20-30 minute
point, Seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to
all the vain entrepeneurs (what with his new "Fire Down Below," another
"message film"), and Caine has him bumped off...or does he?</P>
<P>Seagal is rescued by some Inuits, and falls in love with one of them,
played by Joan Chen, who CAN act, hypothetically, but, for some reason,
not here.  One of Caine's cliched henchmen (played here with a lot of
overacting by John C. McGinley) shoots the cheif of the Inuit clan, and
Chen and Seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory...literally,
of course.  At one point, Seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech
about how he doesn't have any options but blow stuff up.  He even goes
as far as to say, "I don't want to kill someone," and in the same
breath, he asks some guy where the arsenal is.</P>
<P>I have no problem with violence.  I'm a huge John Woo fan, but he paints
his films with suspense, skill, style, depth, characterization, and just
plain cool violence.  In the films of Seagal, the suspense mainly
consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly, and him either wounding
or killing them.  At some points, they use the cliche of the talking
villain, where the villain has the advantage, can shoot Seagal, but
begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan, or saying a
corny line, to which Seagal says something hokey back, and has had
enough time to devise of a way to do away with them, and does.  This
would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn't take itself
seriously at all, like in the case of this summer's "Con Air."  But
Seagal is serious about his skill, and of course, his message.</P>
<P>I wouldn't mind if this was a message film in the way that they present
it to you with evidence.  But Seagal has no idea how to present a film
where the message is subtle, not pounded into the viewer's mind.  The
villain is totally shallow and cartoonish, thus we can't take him and
his motives seriously, and while Seagal talks about being kind to the
environment, he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig, and
kills some workers who were just doing his job.  Then at the end, he
spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech, just in case you didn't get
the message from the trailers.  What Seagal doesn't realize is that no
one takes his films seriously (although maybe a couple do) and any
message he has is no only redundant, but doesn't comfortably fit in his
film, which is filled to the brim with hokey violence, crap suspense,
stupid melodrama, and characters who have about as much emotional depth
as a petri dish.</P>
<P>As far as Seagal and his acting, he's rather boring.  He squints, he
kills.  Period.  Nothing else.  Oh, yeah, there's corny one-liners ("I'm
gonna reach out and touch someone!").  Of course, he's the star, and
we're supposed to root for him and all, so he makes all the villains
unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks.  Michael Caine, who's a great
actor, is just supposed to yell and look cold.  He does it well, I
guess, but this is no "Alfie."  Of coure, no one was expecting that
caliber of performance from him.  His big henchman, John C. McGinley is
kinda boring as well, but is not horrible.  And we even get a small
performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid, R. Lee Ermey
(from "Full Metal Jacket") as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to
say the obligatory speech about how dangerous Seagal is, just for the
movie trailers and for Seagal's ego.  And also, look for Billy Bob
Thornton as one of Ermey's assasins.</P>
<P>Anyway, to conclude this all, to judge one of Seagal's movies is to
judge all of them (except for "Under Siege" and "Executive Decision,"
though the latter is not really a "Seagal movie").  They all have this
same formula, they all have the same action, same villain, same plot,
but this one has that message, which makes it more excrucitating to
watch.  I mean, if you do rent it, and I don't reccomend you do, make
sure you just skip the last 10 minutes.  But I have to put it to Seagal
for creating a film so bad, that the last film I viewed with my uncle
was a pleasurable one.</P>
<P>MY RATING (out of 4): * (extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock)</P>
