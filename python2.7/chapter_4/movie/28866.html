<PRE>BROTHER
A film review by Rachel Gordon
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Violence is bad.  Violence is ugly.  Violence breeds yet more violence. 
Kids, don't try this at home.  This weighty message isn't the only
barrier to enjoying Brother, but it's certainly one of the largest.</P>
<P>Written, directed by, and starring the infamous Takeshi Kitano
(Kikujiro, Sonatine) Brother is his first film made outside his familial
Japan, bringing the yakuza tradition to Los Angeles.  (Yakuza translated
for the average American is the Japanese mafia.)</P>
<P>If you piss a "family" member off, or dishonor yourself in any way, the
usual punishment is public display of self-mutilation, usually resulting
in the loss of limbs.  A definition of dishonor can be anything from
making a stupid decision to leaving one family for another.</P>
<P>It would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs
come from.  Unfortunately the film doesn't give too much of an
explanation, assuming its audience is aware of Kitano's earlier work. 
There are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that
spread across the entire back of the yakuza members, leading one to
assume they would be symbolic of something, but you never know what. 
Then there's a scene in which a man kills himself in front of a rival in
exchange for that rival joining the family.  Granted, this is one of the
best scenes in the movie, but it doesn't make a lot of sense.</P>
<P>Instead, the two hours are basically spent watching the following: 
people go out and shoot each other, talk about it for ten-plus minutes,
then go out and do it again.  The consistently repetitive discussion of
territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning.</P>
<P>There are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose.  All
of the sudden Yamamoto (Kitano) has a girlfriend.  He barely speaks to
her, treats her like crap, and then sends her away.  Another missed
opportunity, considering it is such a big deal for Kitano to bring his
magic to the United States, is the combination of cultures, which rely
too heavily on overused stereotypes.</P>
<P>Though slow moving, Brother does have good elements.  The action scenes
are well directed, clearly defined, and interesting to watch.  Some of
the violence is more hinted at than shown, which produces the luscious
squirm that one goes to see such films for.</P>
<P>The actors would be more enticing if they had more to do.  Shirase's
(Masaya Kato) loud, sarcastic coolness set against Yamamoto's quietly
threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination.  Their
moments together or apart steal the rest of the show.</P>
<P>Also to its credit, Brother tackles the cause and effect of crime with
realism.  A life of crime is easy to get sucked into with the first
reward of quick cash.  Sure people get rich, but they can also lose just
as easily.  It's a great moral, with a great cast, just not much
substance to back it up.</P>
