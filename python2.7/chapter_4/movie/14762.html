<PRE>                          DOG PARK (Canadian)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: Yet another comedy about the singles scene, dating, who
is going to have sex with whom, and what relationships are going to
last.  This one is also about dog owners and a dog psychologist and
obedience trainer.  Nothing in this film is heavier than a cocker
spaniel.  Rating:  6 (0 to 10), 1 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Bruce McCulloch wrote and directed as well as having a role.
   - Luke Wilson plays Andy, a man who has just broken up with his
     girlfriend and is again looking for someone to share his life.  In
     a singles bar he meets Lorna (Natasha Henstridge) whose job is
     being Miss Bookworm on children's television.  He is interested in
     her, but in part because of a friend's philosophizing she is not
     interested in him.  "People should provide you with romantic
     resumes."   From the start we know they are perfect for each
     other.  Ta-da, ta-da, ta-da.
   - There is also some titillation in liberal doses of sex scenes.
     This too is part of the formula.
   - Being about singles and dogs, of course, it has Janeane Garofalo.
   - Janeane Garofalo plays a friend of Andy, part of a "perfect
     couple."
   - These people don't know what they want and end up being stupid and
     hurting each other.
   - Some of the best humor is from the absurdity of the dog
     psychologist played by "Kids in the Hall" alumni Mark McKinney.
   - When the story gets slow they bring a dog on-stage.  Dogs are
     natural entertainers.  That's why they were domesticated in the
     first place.</P>
