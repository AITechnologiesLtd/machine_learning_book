<P>by Curtis Edmonds -- <A HREF="mailto:blueduck@hsbr.org">blueduck@hsbr.org</A></P>
<P>EDtv is the story of a man named Ed (Matthew McConaughey) whose life is the
subject of a television show that runs all day, every day, across the
nation, up close and personal.  And if that sounds familiar, keep reading.</P>
<P>Ron Howard's EDtv was unfortunate enough to follow the similarly-themed The
Truman Show into theaters, and as a result, it may never find as wide of an
audience or as generous a critical reception.  What a pity.  EDtv is
everything that The Truman Show isn't:  funny, smart, entertaining,
sophisticated, and wry.  The Jim Carrey effort is as monolithic, grandiose,
and pretensious as the giant dome of its soundstage, and as bland as its
population of Stepford extras.  EDtv is as quirky and funny as the streets
of San Francisco where it's set, and is populated by a small, diverse
universe of off-beat characters who would be quickly shooed out of
Seahaven.</P>
<P>It helps that the protagonist of EDtv isn't making any great acting
stretches.  Where Jim Carrey was straining to talk out of his mouth instead
of his butt in Truman, all McConaughey has to do is play a good ol' boy
from Texas transported to San Francisco.  Ed is, perhaps, the only
thirtysomething video store clerk in California who's not working on an
independent movie -- the only thing he's working on is the beer he has on a
leash around his neck.  He's picked almost by accident to be the star of
the new show on the "True TV" network, and accepts the idea of having the
cameras watch every detail of his life because it pays pretty good, and
hey, how else is he ever going to be on TV?</P>
<P>Whether by design or accident, Ed turns out to be an ideal personality for
live TV.  He's got a good up-and-down relationship going with his brother's
ex-girlfriend (Jenna Elfman) and a riotous family led by his dimwit brother
(Woody Harrelson) and his elderly stepfather (Martin Landau, who gets
laughs every time he opens his mouth.)  The funniest scenes in the movie
are the ones that highlight these relationships, primarily because the EDtv
show allows them to keep tabs on Ed through their Trinitrons.  EDtv does a
wonderful job of setting up these relationships and using the TV show as a
vehicle to transform them.</P>
<P>And McConaughey's easygoing charm and appealing smile don't hurt one bit.
Ed seems like a guy you'd want to hang out at the pool hall with, and
McConaughey never makes him annoying, never mugs for the camera, never uses
his newfound celebrity to push people around.  You couldn't ask anyone to
do a better job in this role than McConaughey does.</P>
<P>To have a good TV show, though, you have to have more than just a good
star.  For one thing, it helps to have an audience.  The audience was one
of the annoying conceits of The Truman Show was the audience.  Every once
in a while, the story would cut away to someone watching -- nay, staring --
into their television set, watching the antics of Truman Burbank with rapt
attention.  The Truman Show audience was wise to every nuance of the show,
schooled in the protagonist's history, and seemingly is unable to move from
their couches.  This may not be all that different from your typical
television audience.  To be honest, it's not all that different from what I
do on a Sunday afternoon watching the Cowboys play the Giants.  But the
constant image of millions silently staring at flickering screens,
enraptured by the life of a tremendously boring insurance salesman, did
nothing but accent the annoying smugness of The Truman Show.</P>
<P>The audience is a part of EDtv, too, but it's a different audience, and a
better one.  The pretensious Truman Show would have us believe that it's
the number-one show, worldwide, has been for years, will be forever.  EDtv
executives know better:  all they need to be successful is to have people
watch for five or so minutes, two or three times a week.</P>
<P>It's a smaller audience, and a busier audience.  We see people watching
EDtv while going about their daily chores, exercising, chopping bell
peppers, what have you.  Only the teenagers and college kids are watching
closely (which tells you all you need to know about the types of shows that
are on TV nowadays).  It's a smarter audience, too.  The EDtv show runs
sixteen hours a day, with the network wisely deciding that no one really
needs to see Ed sleeping.  But most importantly, the EDtv audience, unlike
The Truman Show audience, is actually being entertained.</P>
<P>Both EDtv and The Truman Show make the same assumptions about our culture,
or significant lack thereof.  As our technology explodes, making more and
more bandwidth available, the quality of programming has imploded.  What
we're left with is an even vaster wasteland than we've ever had before,
populated by "irritainment" and least-common-denominator programming.  EDtv
and Truman are the reductio ad absurdum of this line of thinking, but at
least EDtv realizes that even the most absurd of shows has to entertain on
some level.  The scene where Ed trims his toenails is more entertaining
than anything we see in The Truman Show.  More than that, EDtv is a more
realistic look at television, and as such, has more success as a satire.
Compare the harried, frenetic workplace of the TrueTV headquarters to the
serene, Godlike lair of Ed Harris and tell me what's the truer picture of
entertainment today.</P>
<P>I can't say for sure, but I think EDtv works better as a movie because its
creators have more television experience.  (If anyone in this country has
grown up on TV, it has to be Ron Howard.)  Howard wisely decides to forego
the highbrow approach and make a well-written middlebrow comedy -- higher
quality than you get on Must See TV, but in the same spirit.  Most of the
supporting actors are best known for their TV roles:  Ellen DeGeneres as
the harried True TV producer, Rob Reiner as her boss, Woody Harrelson as
the steroid-crazed brother, Jenna Elfman as the pouting girlfriend.  (Not
to mention Howard's Happy Days buddy Donny Most as a colorless network
yes-man, and brother Clint Howard as the harried man-behind-the-curtain
directing the show.)  TV types don't get a lot of respect in Hollywood for
some reason -- witness Oscar shutouts for Howard's Apollo 13 and Reiner's A
Few Good Men -- but the hilarious, well-crafted EDtv demands a level of
respect at least equal to that of you-know-what..</P>
<P>In fact, forget I ever said anything about The Truman Show.  Remember
Splash?  Tom Hanks and John Candy and Darryl Hannah as the mermaid?  It's
like that:  a good, funny, warmhearted Ron Howard comedy, as welcome as
bluebonnets in the Texas springtime.  Go see EDtv and forget you ever heard
of a movie called...</P>
<P>Wait a second... forget... I forgot something... dangit, what was it...</P>
<P>Oh, yes!  Fellow members of the Elizabeth Hurley Admiration and
Appreciation Society, front and center.  Our Liz has just but a short role,
but it's well worth the price of admission... especially if you can catch
the Entrapment trailer with Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Enjoy.</P>
