<P>By all rights and properties of the American movie-going public,
TWILIGHT should and will not be a popular movie. It has a target
audience of people who were in the prime of their life the last time
Paul Newman was in a feature film and it opens on a very crowded weekend
with three other, more popular releases (by "popular" I mean a wider
target audience). But popularity and weekend gross statistics are by no
means a measure of a film's quality, and every once in a while a gem
such as TWILIGHT slips through the net. </P>
<P>The storytelling style that Director Robert Benton adopts is equal parts
film noir and complex mystery thriller. Although the plot isn't too
confusing, it is a prerequisite that the viewer follows along throughout
the entire movie: characters' names are important and connections are
immediately lost if a role is regarded as unimportant. Although Paul
Newman's tongue-in-cheek voice-overs are part of the film noir style,
they don't really help to keep the story clear. Fortunately they don't
get tiresome or annoying - they were written in to elevate the
comfortable level of cyncism that Newman's character of Harry Ross
shows. </P>
<P>Harry Ross (Newman) is an ex-police officer, ex-private investigator,
and current friend to Jack and Catherine Ames (Gene Hackman and Susan
Sarandon). Both former thespians, the Ames' have their share of
antagonists. At the time of the movie, which takes place in the
Hollywood area, Jack Ames is at the beck and call of a blackmailer (Liev
Schrieber) who has information about the death of another actor. At the
onset, the danger of this information is unclear, until Jack calls Harry
in to pay off the blackmailer. Harry, being an former investigator and
policeman, checks out the situation a bit more thoroughly and discovers
that Jack and Catherine may not be as innocent as they seem. </P>
<P>The main cast is pretty small, which allows for a lot of plot
intricacies to develop. I can't remember the last time I've seen a noir
drama with as many plot twists as TWILIGHT. Even the likes of MISSION:
IMPOSSIBLE, which countless people have told me was far too confusing,
didn't have as many turnabouts as TWILIGHT. Even so, some supporting
characters were a bit superfluous: both Jack's daughter Mel (Reese
Witherspoon) and the blackmailer's parole officer (Margo Martindale)
were nothing but excuses to show off a lot of Hollywood's immoral
excesses (sex and money, respectively). Nevertheless, quality
performances from the upper-echelon likes of Hackman, Sarandon, and
Newman didn't hurt, and a believable and interesting story were what
powered this movie. Recommendable to everyone except the
action-at-any-cost types.</P>
<PRE>FINAL AWARD FOR "TWILIGHT": 3.0 stars - a good movie.
