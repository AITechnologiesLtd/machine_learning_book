<PRE>* * *
w/  Michael Douglas,  Gwyneth Paltrow,  Viggo Mortensen,
     (that chick from MISSISSIPPI MASALA)</PRE>
<P>As antiquated as the formula is, I'm surprised Hollywood keeps it
around: wife cheats on abusive spouse and, instead of leaving him,
convinces her lover to kill him so they can be together and get all
his money.  Or, roles can be switched and jealous husband can be the
one doing the plotting.  As is the case with MURDER, nicely conceived
and gamely acted.</P>
<P>Douglas plays a businessman, Steven Taylor.  His business is about to
go bankrupt.  His wife, Emily (Paltrow), is having an affair with a
painter across town, named David (the expressionless Mortensen).  They
plan to let Steven in on it - she more than he: "It's not fair to
him".  But, Steven is no dupe.  Though, how he knows, or even
suspects, enough to have the two photographed during an afternoon
rendezvous, is never explained.</P>
<P>Standard stuff.  But, the movie has smart, thinking individuals.  Like
Douglas, who has his plan to do away with his wife down to how and why
to do what with keys.  And, Mortensen - a scamster - who agrees to do
the "wet work", but has plans, also.  Every detail of the murder plot,
and the complications that inevitably arise, seems to be coherent and
logical, and it's kind of fun watching the genre played out
intelligently for once.</P>
<P>I liked someof the physical acting between Paltrow and Mortensen, as
during an art exhibition where he sees her, starts walking toward her
and she inconspicuously waves him off.  Then, once they've met in the
corner, and Douglas comes upon them, they act completely natural and
never give any sort of nervous reaction that maybe he knows.</P>
<P>And I liked the way Douglas seemed to have everything figured out, and
together.  He's able to verbally explain his motives with well- chosen
words.  I like dialogue where people come at the subject of discussion
from not just one angle, but think a situation through, think about
every possibility.  MURDER has that kind of banter.</P>
<P>I just wish the film had been about more.  I kept waiting for it to
ask questions movies like this never ask.  For instance, why does the
Paltrow character keep saying it's not fair to her husband to keep her
affair a secret?  As if she's concerned about how he feels.  I'm
wondering why she would've had the affair in the first place, and not
worry about how it may or may not affect him, and why it would only
hit her a good ways into the affair to at least let him know about it.
Does she love her husband?  People don't usually get married
otherwise, right?  And if she does love him, how much or how little
that she can't try and work things out?  Or, _has_ she tried?  Does
she care about whether or not she has hurt him, or that she'll hurt
him again?  Steven doesn't seem like such a bad guy (of course, he
_is_, but that's only later on).  He's rich.  He likes being rich,
gives him a certain air of superiority (at one point he tells Paltrow
which dress to wear - so, you know he's a real creep).  Maybe he makes
her feel small, and insecure, but has it always been that way?  How
did it _get_ that way?  Also, there's no tangible chemistry between
Paltrow and Mortensen, furthering my question into
why-is-she-with-either- man territory.</P>
<P>The same goes for Douglas' character.  He has multiple reasons for
wanting his wife dead, not just the obvious (which, come to think,
isn't really a reason at all, considering what he's most worried
with).  But, why is he married to her?</P>
<P>It's an inconsequential line of inquiry in the end, I guess, but
wouldn't answering such questions - or even addressing them - give the
film a little more dramatic depth?  Of course, that would make a
longer movie.  But hey, attention spans do exist.</P>
<P>And why, oh why, do they have to revert to a violent ending?  I saw a
movie once called, I believe, LADY BEWARE.  It starred Diane Lane.
The storyline wasn't quite the same, but it, too, could have ended in
a violent way.  Instead, it chose a more subtle approach that was
much, much more effective.  A PERFECT MURDER deserved one of those,
because it has a lot going for it already.  -R-</P>
