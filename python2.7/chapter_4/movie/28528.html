Reviewed by Dustin Putman, June 23, 2001.</P>
<P>"Dr. Dolittle 2," a pointless sequel to the 1998 hit, is superior to its 
hideously misguided predecessor, and yet it's still pretty bad. Aimed more 
squarely for children than the original (this one is rated PG; the original 
was PG-13), it is harmless and fluffy, with a few scattershot moments of mild 
amusement. It is also painfully routine, more often boring than not, and 
instantly forgettable. </P>
<P>Dr. John Dolittle (Eddie Murphy), the famous veterinarian who has the gift of 
being able to understand what animals say, is back, along with his lawyer 
wife, Lisa (Kristen Wilson), and two children, Charisse (Raven-Symone) and 
Maya (Kyla Pratt). When a forest is threatened to be torn down by a nasty 
land developer (Jeffrey Jones), Dr. Dolittle is given a month to perform the 
impossible: take a circus bear (voiced by Steve Zahn) and get him to mate 
with a country bear (Lisa Kudrow).</P>
<P>Written by Larry Levin and directed by Steve Carr (2000's despicable "Next 
Friday"), "Dr. Dolittle 2" is placed firmly in the category of "unnecessary 
sequel." The premise of saving land from being torn down is as old as the 
hills, and doesn't help matters; certainly a more original idea could have 
been concocted if a follow-up had to be made. </P>
<P>The various interactions between the doctor and the animals are predictable 
and too often tiresome. While children may enjoy much of this, it doesn't 
successfully carry over for the adult audience, which all good family films 
do. Better is a subplot involving the rocky relationship between the doctor 
and his 16-year-old daughter, Charisse, who has begun to date. This section 
of the movie does away with the main attraction of the animals, but it also 
offers up a fairly accurate, if PG-rated view, of the growing pains of an 
adolescent. It is surprising to see Raven-Symone, who once played little 
Olivia on TV's "The Cosby Show," all grown up, and she certainly has the 
charisma of an actress with a definite future in films.</P>
<P>As for Eddie Murphy, does he really have nothing to do anymore than make 
sequels to successful first pictures? Last year it was the perfectly 
dreadfully "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps," and now it is "Dr. Dolittle 2." 
Since he is so clearly upstaged by the animal performers, and doesn't get 
nearly enough comedic material for himself, Murphy's role could have been 
played by anyone and it wouldn't have made a bit of difference. Likewise, the 
film itself could have never been made, and it wouldn't have been missed. If 
anything, it could have saved millions of wasted dollars.</P>
