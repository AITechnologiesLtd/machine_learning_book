<PRE>Urban Legend (1998)
* *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>I had this stupid little smile on my face during the opening scenes of URBAN
LEGEND.  I thought back, fondly, to CANDYMAN, an intensely disturbing little
movie that took the idea of urban legends and invested it with a grand and
primordial dread.  The only dread I felt during URBAN LEGEND was the fear
that my watch had stopped.</P>
<P>Okay, maybe I'm being too cruel.  URBAN LEGEND was obviously put together,
post-haste, to cash in on the success of movies like SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT
YOU DID LAST SUMMER -- a movie where teenagers and proto-twenty-somethings
get sucked into various horrible happenings, but maintain the ability to
spit out ironic one-liners and wisecracks.  LEGEND is competent and amusing,
and gory without being excessive, but barely worth more than a glance when
it comes on cable TV.  We've seen it all before, better.</P>
<P>This time around, the premise is that various students on a college campus
are being stalked by a nutcase whose methods of dispatching his victims are
patterned after various urban legends.  There's the Man With The Axe In The
Backseat, the Microwave Death, and so on.  About all that's missing is the
Death By Broiling In A Tanning Salon and the Choking Doberman -- and if you
don't know about those, go ask the guy who writes "The Straight Dope".</P>
<P>Once the movie gets rolling, though, there's not much to look forward to
beyond the unmasking of the killer.  But along the way there are some cute
stops.  Robert Englund (the voice and face of "Freddy Krueger" from the
NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET movies) plays a professor on campus who runs a class
on urban legends, and one of his hallmarks is that the camera never just
seems to SHOW him.  We'll see a bunch of students in a hallway or something,
and then the camera will slam-pan to the side with a ZOINK! of horror-movie
synth music, and there he is.  I guess it goes without saying that he's one
of the suspects.</P>
<P>Movies like this inspire a great deal of free-association in me.  For
instance, why is it in films like this that the killer always chooses to
dress so homogenously?  In ...SUMMER, it was a yellow rain slicker; in this
movie, it's a parka with a fur-trimmed hood, which in the middle of a
non-snowbound campus, would be sure to grab anyone's attention.  And do the
people who compose the scores for these movies all use the same orchestra
hit synthesizer patch?  It sure sounds like it.</P>
