<P>The Game
Michael Douglas reprises in part his tough, award-winning Wall Street
character in The Game's lead role as a successful businessman who decides
one day to take part in a "game" his wayward brother (the excellent Sean
Penn) invites him to play. The problem is, Douglas has no idea what the game
is, or what its objectives are, or even when it does begin. He finds out
quickly enough that there are no rules in this game.</P>
<P>The confident Gekko within Douglas disintegrates swiftly as his fragile self
stumbles upon puzzle upon mayhem upon deceit. Suddenly the self-control
which he relishes is wrested from him as he begins to perceive,
McCarthy-like, the reality around him and its events as manifesting
plausible connections to the game. Mirroring games in general, the adventure
escalates with Douglas discovering how the puppetmasters behind the game are
first, after his money, and then, after his life as well.</P>
<P>I followed the movie eagerly waiting for the next twist in the tale to
emerge, the next pitfall Douglas would be lured into. The realisation at the
end of the movie that it was a huge, expensive practical joke played on him
by his brother for his birthday was an annoying dis-revelation, but it did
not detract from the fun I had going through the show.</P>
<P>Granted, all movies manipulate the viewer's perspectives and affectations
and involve them to some degree in the story. But The Game is singularly
unique because it does so ironically. The movie itself is a linear game with
a closed ending, and it ultimately plays us the viewers, not Michael
Douglas. After a while, it is the movie-goer who is taken heart and soul
into the game, pondering over what had happened and attempting to predict
the course of events. To weave the various threads of the movie into a
coherent whole and wring out some underlying significance - that's what
movie-goers do. The recurrence of Douglas' anguish over his father's suicide
when he was a child, and the impressionable reference to the Bible seemed to
suggest some deeper moral that Penn is trying to get Douglas to perceive
through the game, at the end of which one may argue it has been achieved.
But I don't see any such thing; it is after all just a game.</P>
