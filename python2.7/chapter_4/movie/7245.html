<P>BE WARNED.. BRIT LOVE STORY IN THE OFFING.</P>
<P>     Effeminate, mild-mannered Karl is about to take a beatng from
a bunch of ruffians at school as he bathes himself under a shower,
his genitals tucked between his legs in the manner of a posing 
transvestite.  He is only just saved by Prentice, who appears in
all respects barring his protective attitude towards Karl to be your
average street-wise punk-in-the-making.  The ensuing scene ends up
with both boys being ridiculed and then unfairly expelled from the
school. They do not see each other for another eighteen yeas.      </P>
<P>     In that time, Prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable, if
brash and bull-heaed goon who screws up his jobs and relationships
while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets,
motorcycles and punk rock music.  Karl, on the other hand, has grown 
up to become Kim, a drabby, insecure woman who works as a verse writer
for a greeting card company.  Chance brings the two together, and love,
such as will inevitably blossom in your quirky British romantic comedy, 
is what this skewed little story is largely about.    </P>
<P>     If at this point you think you're going to get any cheap laughs 
with that gender-bending theme (see THE BIRDCAGE, TO WONG FOO..., 
PRISCILLA QUEEN OF THE DESERT), you can just go home and brood on
your own maladjusted sexuality you low-life deadbeat. Kim is a 
post-operative transsexual, thank you very much... a new-born woman 
for all purposes, with confusions and sensitivities that deserve 
treatment with a touch of delicacy.  </P>
<P>     Personally, give me those cheap laughs any day.  I'd rather 
enjoy obvious camp than endure the shallow exploration of a soft-
hearted transsexual love story.  DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS comes up with a
promising enough proposition, but does nothing that surpasses the
merely workmanlike with it.  By refusing to make the audience 
really uncomfortable with the notion of Kim and Prentice's relation-
ship, or at the very least feel uncomfortable for them (Prentice for
example, doesn't seem to give hiself all that much grief when he
becomes attracted to Kim despite being a fight-picking, beer-drinking,
macho kind of guy, and Kim, for all her insecurities and fears is always
saved any truly disturbing victimisation in the film), and instead
drawing them into a basically wimpy love story, the film manages to
lobotomise itself.  </P>
<P>     Lightweight comedy as it's doomed to be, it could've still have
hacked it with the requisitive endearing couple.  But this doesn't
either, since even Mrs Doubtfire is sexier than Steven Mackintosh's Kim
Foyle, and as either sex, he's just plainly a simpering wanker nobody
should like.  Prentice does though, and that's never explained.  But
then Rupert Graves gives us so heroic performance as Prentice, the guy who 
never grew up (and if there is a BAFTA prize for Most Convincing 
Portrayal of a Rabid Fan at a Buzzcocks' Concert, he should win that 
too) that I guess there's no reason to explain why he's so screwed up.</P>
<P>     If oddly enough you grow to like this show, you'll be wanting
your happy ending, and the film won't fail you there either.  Snide 
underling at Kim's office gets her come-uppance.  Misogynistic police 
officer who beats up Prentice gets his come-uppance.  The couple 
prevail against a disagreeable society and come together in Kim's
apartment.  Kim's sister and her impotent sarge-type husband kiss and
make up after a tiff (TV movie sub-plot with incidental juxtaposition).  
And best of all, Kim sheds her insecurities and learns how to ride
the motorcycle and wear leathers, making Prentice ride pilion.  Awwww.
Terrific closure.  Happy ending.  But just what is it that's differnt
for girls anyway?  If you figure that one out, let me know.  </P>
