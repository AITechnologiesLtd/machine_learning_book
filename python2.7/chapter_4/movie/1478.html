<PRE>                                  UNFORGIVEN
                       A film review by George V. Reilly
                        Copyright 1992 George V. Reilly</PRE>
<P>     UNFORGIVEN is a film directed and produced by Clint Eastwood, from
a script by David Webb Peoples.  It stars Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman,
Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris, Jaimz Woolvett, Saul Rubinek, Frances
Fisher, and Anna Thompson.  Rated R for violence.</P>
<P>     I went to see UNFORGIVEN with fairly high expectations, having
heard that it was Eastwood's best picture--as director or star--in
years.  I wasn't disappointed.</P>
<P>     There are no white hats and black hats in this Western; all of the
characters wear grey hats, though some hats are darker than others.  No
character is without flaws.  Revenge begets revenge, and brings out the
worst in everyone.</P>
<P>     Eastwood is Will Munny, a former gunslinger and drunkard, saved
eleven years before by the love of a good woman.  Freeman plays his old
partner, Ned Logan, another killer-turned-farmer.  Hackman is Little
Bill Daggett, a brutally sadistic sheriff, none too fastidious about how
he enforces law and order in his town.  Harris plays English Bob,
another old killer, with an ego so large that he travels with his own
biographer in tow.  Woolvett is the Schofield Kid, a callow,
bloodthirsty, myopic, would-be bounty hunter, who lures Will and Ned
back to being killers.  Rubinek is Beauchamp, the fickle biographer who
transfers his allegiance from the Duck, er, Duke of Death to Little Bill
after the sheriff beats English Bob to a pulp and discloses his feet of
clay.  Thompson plays Delilah, the scarred young prostitute whose
mutilation serves as the starting point for the story.  Fisher is Alice,
the tough senior prostitute who puts up a bounty for the lives of the
two cowboys who cut up Delilah.</P>
<P>     For the first hour, the film is somber in tone, leavened with
occasional humour: Munny fumbling in the mud of the pigsty, the old
killer who can't even get on a horse or shoot straight anymore, and the
young killer who can't see more than a few feet.  Thereafter UNFORGIVEN
becomes much darker, indeed unrelentingly grim, as death follows upon
death.  If there's any message to be drawn from all of this killing,
it's that violence solves nothing; quite the contrast to most of
Eastwood's earlier films.</P>
<P>     Those who go to UNFORGIVEN in the expectation of seeing a
Dirty-Harry-kicks-ass-in-the-West movie will be disappointed.  There is
violence aplenty, but it is not glorified.  When Little Bill starts
beating up English Bob or Will Munny, they go down and they stay down,
rolling in agony, taking days to recover.  When people get shot, they
are hurt, and sometimes they die, often with a great deal of noise.</P>
<P>     The rest of us will take pleasure in seeing a dark, moral tale, a
story of the West as it probably was instead of the simplistic good
guys/bad guys tales that Hollywood used to so revel in.</P>
<P>     Eastwood excels, both as star and director.  His character is old
and often pathetic, a washed-up has-been, and quite unglamourous.  He
progresses from being a somewhat befuddled pigfarmer who has forgotten
all of his old killing skills to being a lethal instrument of vengeance
after the sheriff kills his longtime partner, all the while staying
wholly believable.  As a director, he keeps the film focused.  There are
no wasted scenes and he coaxes fine performances from the rest of the
cast.</P>
<P>     Hackman too gives a first-class performance.  His competent, brutal
sheriff commands attention.  Little Bill runs the town of Big Whiskey
and has no compunctions about discouraging any killers who hope to
collect the bounty on the cowboys who cut up the prostitute.</P>
<P>     Freeman and Harris are the other two stars of the film who receive
top billing, but neither is on screen long enough for my liking.
Indeed, English Bob is run out of town before Will, Ned, and the Kid
ever get there and is seen no more.  While they are present however,
they also give of their best.</P>
<P>     Woolvett, a newcomer, has a big role as the young would-be killer
who discovers too late that he has no stomach for killing, and he makes
a good start.  Fisher plays the tough, loyal prostitute to perfection,
and Rubinek and Thompson are good in their supporting roles.</P>
<P>     The photography is worthy of note, particularly that of the
countryside and the high country.  The film was shot in Alberta, though
the story takes place in Wyoming and Kansas.</P>
<PRE>Recommended.
