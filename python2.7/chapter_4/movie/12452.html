 Director: Noah Baumbach
 Writer: Noah Baumbach
 Cast: Eric Stoltz, Annabella Sciorra, Chris Eigeman, Carlos
Jacott, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Brian Kerwin, Peter
Bogdanovich, Bridget Fonda, John Lehr</P>
<P>   The most sparkling line in Noah Baumbach's follow-up to
"Kicking and Screaming" is a retort by Ramona (Annabella
Sciorra) to her boyfriend Lester (Eric Stoltz): "You're jealous
of yourself."  It's no wonder the name of his new movie is "Mr.
Jealousy."  Lester, an immature and neurotic thirty-one year
old who was never married and is still playing the dating
game is overcome with resentment toward all his girlfriend's
past and present lovers.  And isn't this an emotion that quite a
lot of us feel, one which few of us would own up to?</P>
<P>   Baumbach, who has cast a some of the actors he used to
good effect in his 1995 film--Eric Stoltz, Chris Eigeman and
Carlos Jacott--improves upon his earlier work, which was one
of those "we just graduated: what do we do now?" 20-
something, angst-ridden feats of which some of us have
becomes justifiably tired by now. This time the folks are past
thirty, and while they have had a succession of relationships,
they each have flaws that prevent them from permanent
commitment.</P>
<P>   We should say that Lester is not jealous of himself, as his
current love believes.  Disturbed, in a way, that Ramona slept
with him on their first date, he wonders just how many other
men had met with the same good fortune.  This is reasonable
enough, and is perhaps the principal basis for women's
conservatism when they enter new relationships.  "Mr.
Jealousy" is narrated throughout, a feature that interferes with
the smooth flow of the action but which has been justified by
director Baumbach as a way to dispense with tedious
exposition so that he can get right down to the essence of the
story.</P>
<P>   The tale centers on Lester, who drifts from job to job and is
currently a substitute Spanish teacher who does not speak or
understand Spanish.  He has been accepted into the
prestigious University of Iowa writing program but simply does
not want to go back to school.  In short, he's the laid-back
sort we've become used in movies featuring Eric Stoltz,
agitated only by the thought that Ramona has been with other
men--26 by her own count.  Suspicious that she is still seeing
a published writer, the insolent, full-of-himself Dashiell Frank
(Chris Eigeman), he follows Dashiell around and discovers
that he attends a psychotherapy group presided over by Dr.
Poke (Peter Bogdanovich). Enrolling himself in their company,
he intends to find out just how much influence this Dashiell
has in Ramona's life, but to do so without revealing much
about himself, he registers with the name of Vince, who is
actually his best friend (played by Carlos Jacott), who is also
unsure of himself and unable to commit to his girlfriend,
Lucretia (Marianne Jean-Baptiste).  Much of the humor of the
movie comes from Stoltz in a double role as himself and as
his friend.  As he works out Vince's problems, Vince himself
becomes increasingly eager to hear about "his"
psychotherapy.</P>
<P>   Baumbach seems always to be holding back as though
afraid of off-the-wall humor, and as a result his plot, though
satisfyingly complicated, never really rises to flat-out good
laughs.  The concept is such a good one--that of a guy so
obsessed with finding out the nature of his girlfriend's loyalty
that he will impersonate another in his psychotherapy group--
that we are surprised when the scenes peter out.  Stoltz and
Sciorra appear too old for their roles, though in fact Stoltz is
just six years older than his character, but they come across
as too naive for their age.  Annabella Sciorra is splendid in
her part, a slightly wacky woman who dashes around the
Brooklyn Museum giving lectures on the artworks there, while
Chris Eigeman, in particular, shines as the arrogant writer
who drops hints about the professional people chasing after
him with offers and options.</P>
<P>   As urban comedy (provided that you accept Brooklyn as a
hip, urban location), the picture will remind you of many of
Woody Allen's creations, though the omnipresence of the
narrator and the overuse of film techniques like irises call too
much attention to themselves.  The most puzzling bit of
casting involves Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Vince's fiance. 
The English actress Ms. Jean-Baptiste, who was wonderful in
"Secrets and Lies," adopts an American accent but simply
does not fit in with her current role. Bridget Fonda, who
cannot do wrong, knocks out a cute little role as the shy,
stuttering girlfriend of Dashiell, yet another character who
seems not suitable as the soulmate of a pompous and
outspoken writer.  Rated R.  Running time: 105 minutes.  (C)
