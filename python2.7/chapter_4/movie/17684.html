<PRE>Gods and Monsters
Directed by Bill Condon
Starring Ian McKellan, Brendan Fraser, Lynn Redgrave</PRE>
<P>`To a New World of gods and monsters!' – from James Whale's classic film,
Bride of Frankenstein.</P>
<P>Some films are just so amazing that they have to be seen more than once.  Gods
and Monsters is one of those films.</P>
<P>This film is about the last few weeks of director James Whale's life
(Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, Showboat).  It delves very deeply into
his personal life and his past, showing his day to day routine after a stroke
has destroyed a portion of his brain and is causing him to hallucinate.  Of
course, it's the revelations that occur during this process which make the
movie so good.</P>
<P>The story is fictional, but based on real-life accounts of Whale's life.  As
far as anyone knows, Brendan Fraser's character is fictional, though Lynn
Redgrave's character, Hanna, is based on Whale's real-life maid and caretaker,
and of course several supporting characters are based in reality.</P>
<P>The film starts out by showing Whale as a dirty old man, interested only in
getting young guests out of their clothes and into his pool in a state of
nakedness.  It immediately becomes apparent that this is not going to be an
ordinary Point A to B to Z story as most Hollywood movies are.  In this case,
this is a very good thing.</P>
<P>The story weaves its web around you, slowly introducing those characters who
are important, and through a series of flashbacks, hallucinations and
monologues explains Whale's childhood and young adult years.  This all helps
to bring McKellan's character even more to life, and to bring sympathy to an
otherwise misogynistic man.  All the meanwhile, subplots are evolving and
coming to a head in a brilliant climax which will remain unrevealed here.</P>
<P>Ian McKellan, Lynn Redgrave and Brendan Fraser all give great performances
here.  McKellan and Redgrave both have received Oscar nods for their work in
this film (we'll see if they win on Sunday…), and both deserve to take home
the Golden Boy.  Fraser's performance seems to have been underrated because
he plays `the dumb guy'.  I don't see it this way at all, since Fraser's
character is completely believable.  No, he's not an Oxford-educated snob,
he's a regular joe, and he plays it that way.  He also shows with a few
simple gestures that there's a lot more going on under the surface.  As the
movie progresses, Fraser's character literally `bubbles' with interesting
revelations, and this helps to keep the movie flowing.        An absolutely
stunning performance, and proof that there's more to this guy than Encino Man
or George of the Jungle (though both are films which I enjoyed immensely,
they hardly stretch his acting muscles).  Unfortunately, Fraser still spends
a lot of time in this movie with his clothes off…maybe in the Mummy he'll get
to wear a shirt.</P>
<P>Needless to say, Bill Condon has impressed me with this film.  I'm even more
impressed when I consider that Condon's previous work is the little-seen
horror flick sequel Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh.  It's obvious that
Condon sees a little bit of himself in James Whale, and allows that to
reflect into his vision.  The difference is, that whereas Whale is best
remembered for his films which he didn't really care for, Condon will easily
be remembered for brilliant works of art if this is to be his quality of film
from now on.  Of course, with him being such a close friend of Clive Barker,
there is a very real possibility that he could end up back in the horror
genre before long.  With the right script, though, this could be a great
thing for horror.</P>
<PRE>Until next time, go see a movie!</PRE>
