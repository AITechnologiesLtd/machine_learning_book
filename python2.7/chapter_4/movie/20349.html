Outside Providence *1/2</PRE>
<PRE>rated R
Miramax Films
starring Shawn Hatosy, Alec Baldwin, Amy Smart, George Wendt, Jack Ferver,
Jon Abrahams
based on the novel by Peter Farrelly
written by Peter Farrelly, Michael Corrente, and Bobby Farrelly
directed by Michael Corrente</PRE>
<P>In Michael Corrente's "Outside Providence", the first image we see is
that of a boy on his bicycle.  Behind him, tied to his bike with a
rope, is a kid in a wheelchair, throwing newspapers to people's
houses. Tied to the wheelchair is a three-legged dog, limping for his
life.  We've seen this picture before, now haven't we? If "we" have
seen a film by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, then yes, we have.</P>
<P>But then again, the Farrelly brothers' three films("Dumb And Dumber",
"Kingpin" and "There's Something About Mary") all had something going
for them. A hilarious sense of humor and an aura of
unpredictabililty. "Outside Providence", which is based on the
"semi-autobiography" of Peter Farrelly, shares neither of these two
qualities, and doesn't have much to offer.</P>
<P>Peter Farrelly's alias in the film is Tim Dunphy(Shawn Hatosy), a
teenager who lives in 1970's Pawtucket, Rhode Island with his
wheelchair-bound little brother and his alcoholic, aggressive
father(Alec Baldwin), who refers to Tim as "Dildo". Tim lives a
somewhat bored existence in Pawtucket, where he spends his time going
to parties and getting high with his friends. However, when he
accidentally crashes into a parked police car, he is given no choice
but to spend his senior year at Cornwall Academy, a strict co-ed
private high school.</P>
<P>Tim makes a few new friends, and manages to break just about every
rule the school has. But it isn't until he meets Jane Weston(Amy
Smart), the best-looking and perhaps smartest girl in school, that he
begins let go and just try to have fun. And of course, through Jane,
Tim learns about real love, and starts to do better in school.</P>
<P>"Outside Providence" also relies on a small subplot which has Old Man
Dunphy(Alec Baldwin) and some of his buddies sitting around playing
cards. In one particular scene, a guy named Joey(George Wendt) admits
to being gay, and the guys kick him out of the house. This scene and
another awful subplot involving Tim's dead mother make up the dramatic
core of the film, which is not good news.</P>
<P>Not only is "Outside Providence" a story we seem to have seen before,
it is also a very poorly made film. It's predictable, corny, unfunny
and gratuitous. Why do I have a good feeling that the Farrelly
brothers were forced into adding a three-legged dog and a barfing
scene?  Maybe because I took a look at Miramax's marketing push behind
the movie.</P>
<P>The acting isn't very good either. Shawn Hatosy and Amy Smart are
one-dimensional as the leads, and even a "different" performance by
Alec Baldwin, who surprisingly takes a supporting role here, is only
marginally good. "Outside Providence", the book by Peter Farrelly, was
blasted by critics, so it doesn't surprise me that the Farrelly
brothers would be the ones adapting it for the screen.</P>
<P>Being a Farrelly Brothers movie, the movie obviously has some fun
scenes, but the film as a whole feels pointless, and without
direction, thanks in a large part to first-time director Michael
Corrente.  Miramax Films has made some very smart moves in the past
few years, and financing this piece of recycled trash was not one of
them.</P>
