Key to rating system:

3.5 stars - I am biased in favor of the movie
4.0 stars - I felt the movie's impact personally or it stood out
*********************************</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Carl Schenkel</PRE>
<P>Written by: Bayard Johnson, J. Anderson Black
from stories and characters by Edgar Rice Burroughs</P>
<P>Starring: Casper Van Dien, Jane March, Steven Waddington</P>
<P>Ingredients: True love, Tarzan, Jane, lost city of Opar</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Tarzan, (Casper Van Dien) jungle lord turned society guy, is in Britain
preparing for his wedding to Jane Porter (Jane March) when he receives a
psychic call from an African medicine man, telling him that white men
are plundering Africa. Some bad guys led by Mr. Nigel Ravens are on an
expedition to find and loot the lost African city of Opar, considered
taboo and sacred by the African natives, who unfortunately, don't have
the guns to stop Ravens and his men. Tarzan sails back to Africa to stop
Ravens. Jane soon follows Tarzan to Africa and is captured by Ravens. </P>
<PRE>Can Tarzan stop Ravens?</PRE>
<P>Opinion:
Other than less vine-swinging for Tarzan, and a more liberated Jane,
there is nothing new to be found here. Like Kevin Coster's accent in
ROBINHOOD, the African language, songs, and drum rhythms in TARZAN AND
THE LOST CITY are obviously faked. Tarzan's British accent seems to come
and go as well. </P>
<P>The plot also has a big hole in it: the African medicine man Mugambi
supposedly summons Tarzan for help, but the shaman apparently possesses
enough magical powers to easily handle the white men on his own; he can
turn himself into giant bulletproof snakes and hordes of bees, and can
make dead bones turn into magical warriors. Even the non-magical African
villagers are able to send Raven and his looters scurrying away into a
cave - - using mere spears and arrows. So why ask Tarzan to come over
from England? The only real purpose Tarzan serves is to rescue Jane,
who, predictably gets captured following Tarzan to Africa.</P>
<P>Is it bad? Not really. TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY feels a lot like a
Saturday afternoon made-for-TV movie. With the same movie set and
characters but a different plot, language, and music, it would have been
a sharper, more exotic film.</P>
<P>Actually TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY reminds me a lot of the 12 BOMBA OF
THE JUNGLE action series movies made between 1949 and 1955, which - -
according to MATT'S BOMBA THE JUNGLE BOY MOVIE GUIDE - - were created by
hiring a B-movie veteran as the director/writer, and using "a shoestring
budget with predictable plots and a heavy reliance on stock jungle
footage."</P>
<P>Campy and predictable? Yes, but good enough for a Saturday afternoon. </P>
