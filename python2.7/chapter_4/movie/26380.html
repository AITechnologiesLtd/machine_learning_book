<PRE>Meet The Parents </PRE>
<P>As a single guy I know there's few things in life more uncomfortable than 
meeting your girlfriend's parents. You have this feeling that in the back of 
their minds they're thinking, "This is the guy who's corrupting my daughter." 
After years of movies and sitcoms with stories about this experience you tend 
to psych yourself into the worst, most nerve-racking scenario possible about 
meeting the parents. Thankfully, what actually happens isn't as bad as you 
had expected unless you're Ben Stiller in "Meet The Parents" where just the 
opposite happens. He goes in thinking positively and Murphy's Law takes over. 
The result is a funny but somewhat familiar comedy. </P>
<P>Stiller stars as Greg, a male nurse who works in the ER of a Chicago 
hospital. He's been dating Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), a kindergarten teacher, 
for over 10 months and is totally smitten by her. The opening scene shows us 
Greg's love for Pam is true because he's about to propose to her in a rather 
unique way. It's cute and funny (it involves little kids trying to spell) but 
due to some circumstances he aborts it at the last second when he realizes 
he's never met Pam's parents and gets the feeling they're the old fashioned 
type who would forever malign him if he didn't get their blessing first. </P>
<P>Greg and Pam fly to one of Long Island's many upscale suburban towns - not 
unlike those neighborhoods from all the 1980s John Hughes comedies. The only 
reason this story doesn't take place there too is because there's a few 
crucial plot points and funny jokes that could only happen at an airport. </P>
<P>Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner costar as Jack and Dina Byrnes and make for 
really convincing parents. You get the feeling they're a close family from 
their hospitality and how well they get along with each other. Greg feels 
welcome at first but he's still nervous because of what Pam has told him 
about her overprotective father. When she throws his cigarettes on the roof 
of the house he's already pretty freaked out and it's a mentality he's never 
able to snap out of (and with good reason). </P>
<P>What ensues is a mixture of many formulas of commercial comedy. It's 
slapstick, it's one-liners, it's sight gags... and anything and everything 
else that involves being in the wrong place at the wrong time saying the 
wrong thing while doing the wrong thing. You get the feeling you've seen 
these things done before, and you have but only individually. "Meet The 
Parents" is not a carbon copy of any one movie, sitcom or specific plot - 
it's a hybrid of many of them and it works rather well. </P>
<P>I'm not even sure how I would go about describing and analyzing the comical 
elements here. This is a big-budget Hollywood comedy directed by Jay Roach - 
the guy who brought us the "Austin Powers" movies, and his strategy here 
isn't all that different. The jokes are funny, they don't have a lot of setup 
for their execution to pay off (although there are quite a few long-running 
and foreshadowed jokes which work for the most part). Unlike the "Austin 
Powers" films which had much derivative British humor, "Meet The Parents" 
invokes more American humor. It's all about a nice guy who tries his hardest 
just to make his girlfriend's parents like him after he says or does 
something embarrassing that proceeds to compound after he tells a little 
white lie to try to get himself out of the corner he has backed himself into. </P>
<P>The chemistry between Stiller and De Niro is great, one of the best 
father-and-son-in-law relationships I have seen. De Niro's Mr. Byrnes is a 
passive guy who rarely yells or loses his temper but you get the feeling that 
at any given moment he could snap and rip Greg's head off. Byrnes is 
constantly on Greg's case, busting his chops whenever he says something 
without properly thinking it through first (mostly for his own amusement, not 
because he's a mean codger or anything). The scene in which Greg claims he 
milked a cat is funny in and of itself but De Niro closes the scene with a 
hilarious one-liner. He upstages Stiller and humiliates the character Greg in 
one nonchalant breath. Who says De Niro can't do comedy with the best of 
them? </P>
<P>Watching this film I made a mental list of other comedies I could compare 
individual aspects to: "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation;" any given 
episode of "Frasier;" "Father Of The Bride;" "Planes, Trains & Automobiles;" 
"There's Something About Mary;" and a few others I can't think of now. And I 
just want to make it clear that I don't think this movie is ripping off any 
of these works, it's just reminiscent of them. </P>
<P>"Meet The Parents" works because every character and his or her actions and 
reactions are convincing in every situation they're thrown in to. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B </PRE>
