<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Basically a ‘90s twist on Some Like it Hot, high-profile Sundance
acquisition Happy, Texas is cute, lightweight and not unlike a big bowl
of Chinese food – damn enjoyable while you're wolfing it down, but
ultimately leaving an empty feeling in your belly an hour after you
consume it.  Here, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are replaced by Jeremy
Northam and Steve Zahn, and instead of posing as female musicians they
must pretend to be homosexual beauty pageant coordinators.</P>
<P>The film opens with three convicts chained together while on highway
clean-up detail.  There is a brainy one named Harry Sawyer (Northam, An
Ideal Husband), a brawny one named Bob (M.C. Gainey, ConAir) and a
goofy, short one named Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Zahn, You've Got Mail).
There is also a funny gag involving a dead armadillo (if you find dead
armadillos humorous) which leads to the three felons being driven back
to prison for punishment.  But their van crashes during a fight between
Wayne and Bob, and the jailbirds escape.</P>
<P>Bob heads in one direction while Harry and Wayne steal a recreational
vehicle from the parking lot of a convenience store gas station.  While
parked in the dark several miles later, they are picked up by Happy's
Town Sheriff Chappy Dent (William H. Macy, Mystery Men), who leads the
men into the courthouse packed with local officials.  Harry and Wayne
think they're about to be thrown back into the clink, while everybody
else assumes that they are David and Steven, the national beauty pageant
experts that Happy has hired to boost the chances of a local girl
qualifying for a state beauty pageant.  When the locals begin to
negotiate their salary, Harry and Wayne think that their prison sentence
is being haggled.  Hilarity ensues.</P>
<P>The cons plan on picking up their fee in the morning and skipping town,
but the observant Harry overhears the potential for a bigger score while
waiting in line at the town bank.  In two weeks, local farmers will cash
giant checks for the year's harvest, meaning the bank will have a ton of
cash ripe for misappropriation.  So Harry and Wayne decide to stick it
out and pretend to be the pageant pros, thinking that watching teen-aged
girls prance around in leotards may not be a bad way to spend some time
while laying low.</P>
<P>Surprise No. 1 comes when they find out that the contestants in the
Little Miss Fresh Squeezed Pre-Teen Talent Competition are about half
the age they expected.  Surprise No. 2 comes when they find out that the
guys they're impersonating are a gay couple.  The whole town of Happy
thinks the manly jailbirds are in a relationship and they have no choice
but to play along.  Apparently above the usual opinionated views that
small-town Southerners may have about alternative lifestyles, the
residents of Happy embrace Harry and David as celebrities, acknowledging
their obvious talent for pizzazz by admitting `They're crafty that way.'</P>
<P>Things proceed predictably from here, with Harry beginning to con the
relationship-phobic banker (Ally Walker, Profiler) and eventually
falling for her, while Wayne is stuck with the talentless kids, forced
to learn how to sew and dance.  Not to be outquirked, Sheriff Chappy
even has a sexual identity crisis.</P>
<P>Prior to the screening of this film at the Toronto International Film
Festival, first-time director and co-writer Mark Illsley (who was the
assistant on Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) explained that about fifteen
to twenty minutes of footage was reshot and inserted into the film after
it played the Sundance Film Festival (where Zahn earned special acting
honors).  It appeared to me that most of the new scenes center around
the relationship between Harry and the banker, which is too bad because
I would have preferred to see more of the pageant preparation (Zahn) and
less of the romance.  You could also tell new footage from the old by
Zahn's disappearing soul patch (the hair right under his bottom lip).
But the film is still a blast to watch, if not just for the wonderful
actors involved in the project (Zahn took home a special acting award
from Sundance), who reportedly all worked for scale.</P>
<P>1:44 – for mild violence, sexual content and adult language and
situations</P>
