<P>ONE FALSE MOVE
(IRS)
 Originally given a brief theatrical run in 1992 --just long enough to
attract the attention of some major critics-- and quickly shuttled to video,
director Carl Franklin's "One False Move" is a tight, tense little thriller
that's most notable today as a launching pad for the careers of Bill Paxton
and Billy Bob Thornton. Thornton co-scripted (with Tom Epperson) this tale
of three drug-dealing killers who cut a bloody path from Los Angeles to the
sleepy hamlet of Star City, Arkansas, the hometown of Fantasia (Cynda
Williams), the least psychotic of the trio. Keeping the peace in Star City
is Dale "Hurricane" Dixon (Paxton), an underworked police chief with dreams
of someday being a supercop. Dale wants very badly to impress the two L.A.
officers (Jim Metzler and Earl Billings) who've arrived in town, unaware of
the fact that his idols ridicule him behind his back. Even though Dale never
seems to listen to anyone but himself, when he accidentally eavesdrops on
the big-city cops making fun of his ambitions, his face all but cracks from
the silent pain surging through it.
 It's this kind of attention to character that sets "One False Move" apart
from the usual crime drama as Thornton and Epperson somehow manage to offset
the story's gorier moments --including a savage opening sequence featuring a
multiple murder-- with some smart twists. There's a terrific backstory
between two of the main characters that turns out to be a crucial plot
pivot, and Dale ultimately reveals himself to be much more than just a
high-energy hick in a violent, well-handled climax.
 "One False Move" has too many flaws to qualify as any sort of classic:
Franklin routinely oversells the comic relief, and Thornton was a better
writer than he was an actor at this point. Paxton's outstanding work is
something to see however, Michael Beach is truly scary as Thornton's quietly
menacing partner, and Williams shows she's a talent whose potential has not
been tapped as effectively in the movies she's done since. "One False Move"
is also historically important as a film that helped pave the way for such
later independent filmmaking triumphs as Quentin Tarantino's "Reservoir
Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction": Like those creations, this was a picture that
dared to veer outside the boundaries of traditional cinema and to take its
audience along for a dizzying ride. James Sanford</P>
