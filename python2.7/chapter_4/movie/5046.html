                       A film review by Randy Parker

<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        GLORY--starring Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, and Morgan
Freeman--is the true story of the 54th Regiment of Massachusetts, the first
black fighting unit recruited by the North during the Civil War.  Broderick
plays Robert Gould Shaw, the young white officer who led the black soldiers
into battle.  Shaw, the son of well-to-do abolitionists, hailed from Boston
high society.  The letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are
on display at Harvard, and were, evidently, the inspiration for GLORY.</P>
<P>        As the film begins in 1862, Shaw is a Captain in the Northern
forces.  Like Private Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) in CASUALTIES OF WAR, Shaw
initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is, until his company
is attacked by enemy forces.  Shaw experiences first hand the horror and
chaos of battle, witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound
himself when a bullet grazes his neck.  Soon after his recovery, Shaw is
promoted to Colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war
effort.</P>
<P>        GLORY is the story not only of Colonel Shaw, but also of the black
soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery.
The film periodically jumps between Shaw's point of view and the
perspective of the black soldiers.  The movie introduces us to a handful of
black recruits, and we follow them from their enlistment through basic
training and finally into action.</P>
<P>        The large black cast is uniformly outstanding, especially
Washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth.  He is
brash and pushy, always getting into trouble and always looking for a
fight.  His bitter, tough guy facade is really just a mask for his
loneliness and vulnerability.  Washington provides much of the film's
intensity and emotional power.  In one heartbreaking scene, he is whipped
for allegedly deserting the army.  When he removes his shirt to receive the
punishment, you cringe at the sight of his back, which is riddled with ugly
scars from his days as a slave.  It makes your blood boil.  The humiliation
of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it
brings; a tear rolls down Washington's cheek--and will probably run down
your cheek as well.  The episode becomes even more tragic when we learn
that Washington wasn't deserting the army at all; he left camp to look for
shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores.</P>
<P>        Freeman is, as usual, a strong presence, even in a small supporting
role.  He plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he
cares to remember.  He quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers,
holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers.
Colonel Shaw recognizes Freeman's leadership ability and promotes him to
sergeant major, making him the first black officer in the army.</P>
<P>        Andre Braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of Thomas
Searles, a free black who is one of Shaw's close childhood friends.
Searles is educated and refined, like a white man, prompting Washington to
nickname him "Snow Flake."  The burning question is whether Searles is
tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat.</P>
<P>        The road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for
the black regiment.  The soldiers suffer innumerable hardships, but somehow
they never lose their morale.  The army treats the black soldiers like
second class citizens, subjecting them to racism and discrimination.  They
are paid only $10 a month, whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen,
and, for a long time, they have to go without shoes, guns, or uniforms.  To
make matters worse, the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to
allow the blacks into action, preferring instead to use them for manual
labor.  Eventually, however, the regiment receives its boots, uniforms,
rifles, and right to fight, thanks to the stubborn resolve of Colonel Shaw.
Shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers, and he fights tooth and nail to
get them what they deserve, even if it means threatening a general with
blackmail.</P>
<P>        Broderick, in fact, is most convincing in the scenes where Shaw
stands up for the regiment.  Unfortunately, however, Broderick's uneven
performance is, in many respects, the weak link in the movie.  In an effort
to look more mature, Broderick sports a mustache and a goatee, and
throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony Boston accent.  He is
never altogether convincing as Shaw since much of the time his emotions
seem forced.  The film places too much weight on Broderick's character and
not enough on the black soldiers, who are more intriguing.</P>
<P>        GLORY regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war.  The
movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily
graphic gore which marred BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.  GLORY does not try
to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts.  Except for a few bullet
wounds and one exploding head, the film, for the most part, leaves the gore
to your imagination, which is not to say that the battle scenes in GLORY
are timid.  To the contrary, they are chaotic and horrifying; it's just
that director Edward Zwick (the co-creator of "thirtysomething") films them
with far more subtlety and restraint than Oliver Stone could ever muster.</P>
<P>        The key to GLORY is the group dynamic among the black soldiers.
The movie depicts some of (but not enough of) their customs and rituals.
In one scene, for example, the soldiers motivate themselves by singing
prayers around the campfire.  Each man has a chance to relay a few words of
inspiration.  A couple of the movie's most touching moments involve young
black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe, disbelief and
pride.  The regiment's greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish
themselves in battle, thereby earning the respect of their white peers and
earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on Fort Wagner.</P>
<P>        Like any war film, GLORY has its share of gloom and despair, but
ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important
history lesson, a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say
(or, more precisely, what they do not say), blacks played a critically
important role in the North's victory over the South--forever changing the
evolution of America.</P>
