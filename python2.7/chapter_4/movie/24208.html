<P>         Perhaps it's written in stone somewhere in Hollywood that every
animated film has to include songs, whether they suit the story or not.</P>
<P> But "The Road to El Dorado" is a shining example of a film that
would have been much stronger if it didn't have to pause every 15
minutes for a musical number. The score in this case was penned by Elton
John and Tim Rice, but the old "Lion King" lightning has not struck a
second time: These ditties are ho-hum instead of hummable and several of
them, particularly the ballads, bring the action to a near-total
standstill.</P>
<P> That's a shame, since "El Dorado" is an otherwise enjoyable
adventure, with a delightful beginning and an exciting finale making up
for a somewhat muddled middle. In many ways the plot is reminiscent of
Rudyard Kipling's tale "The Man Who Would Be King," which was
beautifully filmed in 1975 with Sean Connery and Michael Caine. Like the
Kipling yarn, "El Dorado" introduces us to a pair of fortune-seekers,
Miguel (voice of Kenneth Branagh) and Tulio (voice of Kevin Kline), who
find more riches -- not to mention more headaches -- than they ever
dreamed of when they stumble upon a secret civilization.</P>
<P> Escaping a shady past in Spain, the two accidentally become
castaways and travel to South America, where a mysterious map leads them
into El Dorado, the legendary lost city of gold. Their arrival time
couldn't have been better: It seems the citizens were awaiting the
appearance of a couple of gods who would help usher in "the time of the
jaguar," and Miguel and Tulio cheerfully take advantage of the natives'
hospitality.</P>
<P> The first portion of "El Dorado" is by far the funniest section
of the film, featuring a highly amusing episode at sea, some bouncy
banter between our heroes and the intoduction of a saucy, sinuous thief
named Chel (voice of Rosie Perez) who provides a bit of romantic
interest. El Dorado itself is introduced in a glorious sequence that
allows the animators to pull out all the stops.</P>
<P> Once Tulio and Miguel have settled in, the movie settles down
-- perhaps a bit too much, as John and Rice haul out their maudlin
melodies. It's only when Tzekel-Kan (voice of Armand Assante), the
blood-crazed high priest, starts to get suspicious of the visitors that
the picture begins to regain its momentum. Certainly there's nothing
like the unveiling of a spectacular monster and the arrival of a tidal
wave to get kids back in their seats.</P>
<P> "El Dorado" comes from Dreamworks, which previously produced
the scintillating 1998 feature "Prince of Egypt." Despite some
eye-popping effects and luscious colors, this one isn't in the same
class, although parents and older siblings who have to accompany little
ones to the theater will probably find this much easier to take than
"Pokemon" or "Snow Day." "The Road to El Dorado" has its potholes, but
it's definitely a scenic route. James Sanford</P>
