The rise of certain indie filmmakers is somewhat baffling to me. You have a guy
like Morgan J. Freeman who directed HURRICANE STREETS, a flick that was lauded
as a "gritty" street drama, and ended up being about as authentic as
confederated products. His picture was a Sundance Film Festival favorite paving
the way for more mediocrity from Freeman (namely, DESERT BLUE). Then you have a
talented guy like Larry Fessenden, who directed the chilling urban\gothic
horror tale, HABIT on 16mm film, because he could not secure a budget large
enough to make it on 35 mm. Maybe this is because of the increasing
"mainstreaming" of indie films. Is HAPPY TEXAS (1999's Sundance champ) a clever
indie, or a very 80's one-joke buddy movie? It feels an awful lot like the
latter, yet it received many accolades for essentially being a low budget
throwback to the days of WHAT ABOUT BOB? So many indies are being produced
(every major studio has an indie wing that specializes in "alternative" films)
that many have began ripping each other off (example: ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE
is DRUGSTORE COWBOY minus Matt Dillon plus James Woods). The independent film
makers who kick started the "indie revolution" in the early 90's (David
O.Russel, Robert Rodriguez, Richard Linklater, Todd Solondz) have turned to
major studios for their funding, while Tarantino wannabes churn out the junk
that now passes for independent film.
This brings me to Darren Stein, who directed SPARKLER in 1997, later released
in 1999 presumably because of Freddie Prinze Jr.'s rapid rise to stardom. This
picture gave Stein a chance to direct the similarly awful JAWBREAKER (also
released in 1999). Both films bare the mark of an overzealous film geek with
little to say of his own. JAWBREAKER was like a Puff Daddy remix of popular
teen flicks from the past and present, incorporating bits form CLUELESS,
SCREAM, HEATHERS, the T.V show PARKER CAN'T LOSE, and CARRIE to form a
look-at-how-hip-I-am pastiche of bubble-gum teen alienation with nary a genuine
emotion to be found amid the stolen celluloid. So, SPARKLER'S gotta be better
right? After all this was the film that studio executives at Sony Pictures saw,
thus giving them the incentive to sign this guy, and fork over the cash for him
to direct JAWBREAKER.
Well, it isn't the first time nor will it be the last time that studio
executives were wrong. And I knew I was in trouble after the first five minutes
whereupon we are introduced to a group of stereotypically cartoonish trailer
trash. The SPARKLER is Mattie (sitcom veteran Park Overall) a little girl stuck
in a middle-aged woman's body (figuratively of course). She's a
head-in-the-clouds dreamer, who finds an opportunity to pursue her dreams after
discovering her husband is cheating on her. She dresses herself in a bright
green, sparkly get-up and saunters off to a local bar. Meanwhile three city
boys on their way to Vegas converge at the bar after a flat tire stalls them.
The leader of the click appears to be Brad (Freddie Prinze Jr.), a bossy
aspiring Hollywood agent. Joel (Steven Petracca) is a grumpy, hapless fellow
with a secret, and Trent (Jamie Kennedy) is the sweet puppy dog of the group.
They spot Mattie from far away, commenting on her fashion sense ("Wow, somebody
actually morphed a human being and a disco ball"). She approaches the boys
querying them for a dance, to which only Trent responds. He is enchanted with
her for whatever reason. However the boys find it more difficult to ditch her
then they originally thought. Following circumstances too moronic to recount,
she winds up meeting them in Vegas, while searching for an old high school
friend, Dottie (Veronica Cartwright). Dottie is an ex-showgirl, now a stripper
in a scruffy lesbian strip joint, complete with overzealous transvestites.
Meanwhile Mattie's redneck husband comes looking for her.
At first Stein's movie is like a sweeter, less satiric, more amateurish, John
Waters film. Like Waters he pores on the sleaze (we get the aforementioned
transvestite strippers, cursing old biddies, and Dottie's attempted molestation
of Freddie Prinze Jr.), though unlike Waters he isn't intelligent about it. His
sleaze serves no purpose. None of it is well done enough to be entertaining,
nor is it thoughtful enough to be absorbing. It's just there. His characters
are all caricatures (just like in all Waters' films), but they aren't smartly
drawn caricatures. They're simplistic and predictable.
It's a shame that Stein had to cast Overall in his hodgepodge of rubbish. She
seems to have really invested in her part. Overall has a smokey-hickory
southern accent that's both grating and comforting. She's an aged dreamer with
a shimmering naïve smile, and the actress sometimes suggests depth and
poignancy in simple gestures. It's too bad that it's at the service of this
dull tripe.
While I actively disliked both of Stein's films don't think I'm dooming his
career. After all M. Night Shyamalan directed two completely forgettable
formula pictures (PRAYING WITH ANGER, WIDE AWAKE) before turning out the very
well made (though still slightly flawed in my book) THE SIXTH SENSE. Sometimes
talent seemingly springs out of the places you least expect it to. Maybe Stein
will grow up by his next endeavor. Then again, maybe it will take longer than
that: His upcoming project has been described as a combo of SEVEN and BLADE
RUNNER.</P>
