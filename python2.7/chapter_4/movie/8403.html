<PRE>                               GOOD BURGER</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: 5.5 and $4.00</PRE>
<P>    I accidentally saw Good Burger when I was trying to go to Nothing to
Lose.  Hint:  The "Camillus Mall -- Route 5" is neither in Camillus nor on
Route 5.  It would take you at least a half hour to figure that out on
your own, and you would miss Nothing to Lose and be forced to see Good
Burger too.</P>
<P>    As for the movie, it is overall fairly enjoyable.  It does suffer from
several weak performances and weak filler, but there are much worse movies
this summer (Batman & Robin!  Wee!  What a waste of $7.50!!!).</P>
<P>    I can't point to any one actor as having a performance that really
"worked".  They were all fairly competent, but none really excited me.  I
was especially disappointed by Abe Vigoda, who looked very old, very
tired, and very bored.  I did like Shaq, who does a great job just being
himself.</P>
<P>    The movie starts out strong, with strong action and comedy bits, but
then falls flat and drags through the middle to a nearly-believable
ending.</P>
<P>    The target audience for this film appears to be 13-15 year olds.  So
take one of them with you and laugh when they do.  Otherwise, wait until
it moves to the cheap section of your video store.</P>
<P><HR>My #1 rule in reviewing is: NO SPOILERS.  Instead of discussing the
plot, I choose instead to discuss performances, believability,
entertainment value, etc.  If you want the plot, see the movie.</P>
<P>I give two ratings: An arbitrary scale of enjoyability (1 to 10) and
a maximum price I would pay to see the movie.<HR></P>
