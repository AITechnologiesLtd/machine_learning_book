<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A strangely conceived neo-noir tale, set in a decaying fictional English seaside
resort town called, Farhaven. It's a slow-moving visual piece, setting a bleak
moody atmosphere as it touches on voyeurism and misplaced love and obsessions
and childhood abuse. The film's title comes from an Elvis Costello song of the
same name. </P>
<P>The film is seen through the eyes of a scraggy, mute fourteen year-old
Yugoslavian refugee boy, Honda (Luka). He has not spoken since he found the body
of his mother who committed suicide. He's in the habit of riding his bike around
town and of recording private conversations. When he runs into attractive,
23-year-old hairdresser, Helen (Weisz), he becomes obsessed with her as he
starts stalking her and giving her presents and secretly recording her
conversations, all in the hope that she would sleep with him. </P>
<P>Helen has trouble dealing with the sexually aggressive men she dates in town, as
she withholds sex from her deejay boyfriend Bob (Daniels), much to his
displeasure after going out with her for half a year. There are hints that she
was sexually abused as a child by her father. The film slowly keys in on what's
been bothering Helen for the last nine years, as her former boyfriend, the
33-year-old Martin (Nivola) has been released on parole a year ago after serving
eight years for murdering her father. They were lovers, with Helen being
underaged, who got caught in the sack by her father which led to the murder.
Finding out he's been released, she does not want to see him. But Martin is
obsessed with her and can't keep away from her any longer, even though he knows
he would be violating his parole and would be sent back to prison for another
five years. </P>
<P>Honda lives with his sexually liberated, older, nightclub singer sister, Smokey
(Labina), who does what she likes without having any inhibitions and enjoys her
frequent one night stands. All the characters intermingle without realizing the
dark secrets each has. Martin, as he stalks Helen, does not realize that the
refugee child has Helen under surveillance and has a deep need for her love. In
order to relieve his sexual tensions, Martin has exotic strippers do private lap
dances for him, as Costello's 'I Want You' plays. One day Helen lets him make
love to her, but she then reports him to his probation officer as stalking her.
The confused Martin goes to see her for one last time before he plans leaving
town, and he cries out for the troubled woman to tell him that she loves him.
This ill-fated relationship comes to a sudden tragic culmination, which gives
power to all the visual images leading up to this surprising climax. </P>
<P>He's so obsessed that he can't make love to the more than willing Smokey, as he
burns inside from anger and alienation and frustration. But the story is too
slight to make much inroads into those deep emotional directions, except the
power in the film comes from the aftershocks that set in long after viewing the
film. That is when one has time to reflect back on the destructive relationship
and all its implications. It mainly holds one's interest because the story is so
oddly told and all the characters seem to have dark sides ready to burst open at
any time. When they do, it seems to make sense. Its best feature comes by way of
Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak, who uses his noted method of filtered
filming to great advantage here to capture the angst of the characters and their
dark love life. </P>
