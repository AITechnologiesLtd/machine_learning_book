<PRE>                                    CARPOOL
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1996 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>(1996) *1/2 - C:Tom Arnold, David Paymer, Rod Steiger, Rhea Perlman.</P>
<P>Keep in mind that this film is directed by Arthur Hiller, the man who is the
president of the Motion Picture Academy. The man who theoretically should
have seen every good movie made since his term of office began. The man who
directed the hilarious Alan Arkin/Peter Falk comedy "The In-Laws" and also
such acclaimed films as "Love Story" and "The Hospital". Keep in mind that
the film's producer, Arnon Milchan, has produced some of the best films in
the last fifteen years, such as "The King of Comedy", "JFK", and "Falling
Down". With such experience, these men know exactly what makes a movie
great. Which is why it's so shocking that "Carpool" is a truly horrible
mess.</P>
<P>The plot is extremely simple. As a matter of fact, the plot is beyond
simple. Tom Arnold robs a gourmet pastry shop, kidnaps David Paymer and
takes his minvan, only to discover that Paymer was driving the neighborhood
kids to school. And for the rest of the film they have to not get caught by
the Seattle police, who are portrayed as the most inept police force on the
planet.</P>
<P>What's so troublesome about the film is that it's "PG". It's meant to be a
kids film. But there are things in this film that are completely
inappropriate for kids. There are gay jokes, jokes about breast enlargement,
young teenage boys grabbing and feeling young teenage girls, and other such
things. Also, Tom Arnold is portrayed as a hero and the cops, of course, are
idiots. Good message for the children. And the worst thing about the film,
regardless of what kinds of jokes there are, they just aren't funny, no
matter how old you are. The crowd in the theater when I saw the film laughed
once, and that was when a kid stuck a gummi bear up his nose. Comedy gold to
little kids you know. There were one or two lines in the film which I found
humorous, but certainly not enough to carry the entire film.</P>
<P>There's one ridiculous thing about a scene in the film I'd like to comment
on (there are many actually, but I just don't have that kind of time to
comment on all of them). At one point the "good guys" are at a carnival,
fleeing from the bad guys. One of the kids is riding a ferris wheel and
someone bumps a lever and the ferris wheel starts to spin dangerously fast.
And of course they have to save the kid. Now, why would an amusement park
ride have a setting on it which would never be used and is certain to cause
death? Just a thought.</P>
<P>Now I need to justify why I saw this film. The ONLY reason I watched it was
because my favorite actor, Rod Steiger, was in it. Arthur Hiller was smart
enough to get an actor he's worked with in the past (1976's "W.C. Fields and
Me") and then not smart enough to give him anything to do. He's in the last
five minutes of the film and he does a good job as always with what he's
given, but it's just not enough. And Hiller should be beaten for actually
putting Steiger in a clown outfit at the end and having him sell doughnuts
at a carnival. Booooooooooo Mr. Hiller.</P>
<P>At one point in the film, David Paymer says to someone "This isn't
funny".  Mr. Paymer, you're exactly right.</P>
