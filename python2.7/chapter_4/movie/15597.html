<PRE>Review:         The Cruise</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Timothy Levitch</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:        Bennett Miller</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse [1998]</PRE>
<P>Visually and vocally, Timothy Levitch is a cross between Woody Allen
and Tiny Tim. Unfortunately he doesn't have the talent of either
and his voice is reminiscent of fingernails on the blackboard. This is
particularly unfortunate as he is the narrator of the film,
essentially the only one who speaks.</P>
<P>It has been said that each person will ultimately have his 15 minutes of
fame. In this movie, even 15 minutes is too long. The premise is a good
one: following a sightseeing cruise bus through the streets of New York
City. There are occasional shots of points of interest, like the Empire
State Building, the Chrysler Building, and The World Trade Center, but
they are too few and far between. Sights such as the UN Building, Fulton
Fish Market, etc are but a blink of the eye.</P>
<P>A very nice musical score is almost hidden beneath the rambling
narration. The viewer is asked to care about this totally strange
person. It is learned that he works twenty hours a week; clears $200
per week after taxes; carries his belongings with him; sleeps in a
friend's room; and has a criminal record.</P>
<P>In all I counted 27 people who walked out of the theatre. There are
sure to be people who may be moved by Levitch's wordy dialogue and
repetition of `big' words such as cacophony and malaise, but I
cannot recommend it for most people. All in all, I not only feel sorry
for the people who buy tickets to this film, but I really sympathize
with those tourists who paid to go on sight-seeing tours of NYC with
him as their guide.</P>
<P>I have no desire to ever see this movie again. I give it a D-.</P>
