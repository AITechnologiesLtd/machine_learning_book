Inspector Gadget (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>

<P>"Inspector Gadget," directed by David Kellogg, is another live-action 
version of a Saturday morning cartoon, and indeed the places in which it is 
most successful are those that show cartoonish silliness.</P>
<P>Matthew Broderick plays the rather dull-witted police inspector dedicated to 
justice. His character, John Brown, is at first an ambitious security guard 
at a medical clinic. The clinic is run by Dr. Brenda Bradford (Joely 
Fisher), who has just about perfected a high-tech program in robotics. When 
an arch-criminal - Sanford Scolex, played by Rupert Everett -- kills 
Bradford's father and makes off with essential components of the "Gadget" 
program, the main plot devices are set in motion. Scolex lobs a dynamite 
cigar and blows Brown up, and himself loses a hand. Hence the nickname 
"Claw."</P>
<P>In an oblique nod to "Robocop," the damaged semi-officer is robotized, his 
head his only human part. Meanwhile, the slimy Claw has recruited Dr. 
Brenda Bradford, offering her unlimited funding and control. His plans are 
sinister, of course: he wishes to build robotic warriors to create 
invincible armies for the highest bidders. The rest of the story follows 
Claw's evil wanderings, including his manufacturing an evil twin for 
Inspector Gadget.</P>
<P>This double is the highlight of Broderick's performance. Rather ordinary in 
his title role, Broderick sets off the twin with a wise-cracking, 
teeth-clicking twist of attitude. It's unclear exactly why Claw has made 
the twin, except to clone the convention of smearing the good guy. Further, 
not enough is made of the wondrous Gadget, so his character seems 
underdeveloped in the public's eye; the real Gadget does not seem to suffer 
from the public's scorn. Clearly, the writers didn't think of everything.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Rupert Everett saves his character with exaggeration - 
laughs and scowls reminiscent of the best mad scientists. In this 
telescoped plot - the whole film under 80 minutes! - Claw's motivations are 
muddy, his background almost completely absent. But Everett makes his bad 
guy actually likable, a feat only good cartoons accomplish.</P>
<P>Joely Fisher as Brenda Bradford is passable. Too much emphasis is placed on 
her beauty, not enough on her intelligence. And I got the feeling that she 
found it difficult to make us believe a human could fall in love with her 
Frankenstein, although it is a fascinating possibility.</P>
<P>The self-relexive humor goes a long way toward making "Inspector Gadget" 
watchable. When the Gadgetmobile (a souped-up white Lincoln convertible 
voiced by D.L. Hughley) quips that this is "a Disney movie," we get a taste 
of wit that appears too sparsely in so many other parts. Mini-parodies of 
movies like last summer's flop "Godzilla" also kick the quality up to 
average.</P>
<P>What pulls it so far down, though? For one, editing done in a chop-shop. 
Many moments that we have seen in trailers for months either do not appear 
at all in the film, or surface at points that are at times awkward or even 
incoherent. I should add that a couple of thought-balloon sequences do 
succeed in offering tiny, cartoon-y flashbacks. But much of the exposition 
we need to comprehend the storyline is lost to the editor's hatchet. 
Another aspect that falls flat is the role of Gadget's niece Penny (Michelle 
Trachtenberg). The actress does a fine job; it's just that she is used for 
ridiculous purposes. Her pooch, the beagle Brain, has simply too little 
screen time to matter much.</P>
<P>Visual effects do a nice job in emulating the outrageous gadgets that spring 
out of the inspector's body. His arms and legs extend for yards, weapons 
shooting out of every portal, even his hat. There's a particularly neat 
scene in which a boy on the street asks for an autograph from the evil 
Gadget, and all kinds of evil-looking weapons pop out of the copy's arms, 
scaring the boy. Unfortunately, we were overexposed to this scene in the 
trailers.</P>
<P>To get a little more of your money's worth if you see this film in a 
theater, stay for the closing credits. Some of the best segments of your 
viewing will include Brain talking in the sharp voice of Don Adams (Gadget's 
voice in the creative cartoon), as well as one of Claw's henchmen in a 
Minion Support Group, characters like Richard Kiel's "Jaws" and an Odd-Job 
impersonator sitting among the listeners.</P>
<P>But I'd advise to skip paying today's big bucks for first-run admission in 
favor of second-run or video rental. That way there's no chance for the 
regret I experienced in paying for a movie I had heard was bad.</P>
