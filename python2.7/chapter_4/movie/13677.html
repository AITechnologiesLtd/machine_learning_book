<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>Sometimes, when I decide to write a short story or a poem, I think of a
title first, and then think of a subject to go with it.  It seems that
the makers of Disturbing Behavior had a similar train of thought when it
came to the title sequence.  I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys
got together and created the opening credits, and then someone saw it
and made up a story to go along with it.  The title sequence is so good,
so ominous and original, that it had me engrossed before the picture
even began.</P>
<P>Of course, my attention dwindled shortly into the film.  Disturbing
Behavior, like so many thrillers, starts off interesting and ends up
laughably ridiculous.  It's a teen horror film with no interesting
violence or sex.  It's a suspense film with no suspense.  It's an Evil
Small Town story with no story to speak of.  It's a disaster, a listless
and uninspired disaster, that just barely misses one-stardom because of
a few good sequences, a mercifully short running time, and one terrific
set of opening credits.  </P>
<P>Our main man is a fellow named Steve Clark, blandly played by Jimmy
Marsden.  He moves to a small town with his family after, tragically,
his brother shoots himself.  Steve is very upset about the untimely
death of his brother; we learn this through strange home-video like
nightmares that he has occasionally.  The big trial for Steve is, of
course, to fit in at school and make new friends.  Marsden looks like
your stereotypical jock down to the last detail, so he seems a poor
casting choice for a social reject.  </P>
<P>As a social reject, he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking
philosophers, Gavin (Nick Stahl) and Rachel (Katie Holmes).  Gavin
informs Steve that the local group of jocks, known as the Blue
Ribboners, are actually a bunch of zombies, assimilating new members
into their group, while sporadically killing innocent people.  So, it's
up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1) solve the mystery, and
2) do something about it.  By the end of it all, something has happened
and things have been explained, but the film still doesn't make any
sense.</P>
<P>Disturbing Behavior was written by Scott Rosenberg.  I've seen his name
around recently (he was one of the toucher-uppers on the Armageddon
script), and I imagine that, for the most part, he knows what he's doing
when it comes to screenwriting.  He did, however, have a complete lapse
in judgement when he got the idea for this film, and then decided to
actually take the time to write it out.  Evil Small Town films are
pretty common (the last one, Phantoms, is also a dismal failure), but it
takes a lot of skill to make the formula work.  Rosenberg's script is a
complete mess, lacking in even the most basic attempts at
characterization. </P>
<P>And it makes no sense, nor is their any purpose when things are finally
"explained."  There is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see
what is happening to the jocks, but the film never explains exactly what
*is* happening.  They get strapped to chairs, a microchip is inserted
into their eyes, and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed, superviolent,
machine-like creatures.  The doctor responsible for all this, Dr.
Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood), must be pretty nuts for thinking that this
kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually
behave (or, perhaps, this is the only realistic element in the film).</P>
<P>Much of the writing is simply bad, and Rosenberg has no intuition when
it comes to the way high school kids act.  In one terrible scene, Gavin
explains to Steve all of the high school cliques, while pointing them
out in the cafeteria.  Up front, I should say that, in four years of
high school, I did not eat in the cafeteria even once.  That aside, the
various social groups he points out are general, uninteresting, and
poorly-shown.  For instance, he points to the "nerds," who are all
wearing glasses and playing with their laptops.  It's such an obvious
cliche that I can't believe Rosenberg even bothered.  Most of the
dialogue is forced (no one says, "Bite me!" anymore), and none of the
scenes have any degree of wit.</P>
<P>This picture is not inspired, and most scenes flop from one to the
other, with no sense of momentum or energy.  The blame for this can be
placed on director David Nutter, who apparently likes his films dry. 
Horror films should at least exploit violence, but this one is
shockingly timid.  There are a few good scenes, though, such as an
interesting trip through an insane asylum (this is, however, the most
forced scene in the film, for how our heroes get there or why they
bother are things we never learn).  I also liked the school janitor
character, played by William Sadler.  He has a few lines that are
surprisingly thought-provoking.</P>
<P>The acting is largely a waste of talent.  Marsden is, as I said, bland
(thought not particularly bad).  Bruce Greenwood is shamelessly wasted. 
Stahl and Holmes both show they have talent, but the direction isn't
good enough to hone in on their skills (Stahl's performance seems more
like a parody of high school potheads).  None of these characters expand
beyond their one dimension, and, frankly, watching cardboard cut-outs of
human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn't all that
cool.  </P>
<P>Disturbing Behavior is a wreck of a film, and it started out a wreck
before shooting even began.  I'm surprised there were producers who read
this script and thought that it would make a good film, or that it would
make a lot of money at the box office.  It's not boring, or even
blatantly awful, but it's an uninspired lump of a film.  It sure starts
off nicely, but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent
that the very last scene is outright laughable.  So, if you go to see
this film, take my advice:  appreciate the credit sequence, and pray it
never ends.</P>
