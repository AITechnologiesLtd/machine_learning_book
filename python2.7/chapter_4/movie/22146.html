<P>Wow.  Awesome.  Wonderful.  Excellent.  Speechless. </P>
<PRE>Wow.</PRE>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Set in 1935 Louisiana, "The Green Mile" revolves around a few good men 
(and a couple'a scoundrels, a Chick or two, and a mouse) caught up in a 
bad situation.</P>
<P>In Louisana's Cold Mountain State Penitentiary, Corrections Officer Paul 
Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), along with his fellow guards Brutus "Brutal" 
Howell (David Morse), Harry Terwilleger (Jeffrey DeMunn), and Dean 
Stanton (Barry Pepper), are responsible, with the help of trustee inmate 
Toot-Toot (Harry Dean Stanton), for preparing Death Row inmates to walk 
the Last Mile (called the Green Mile here because of the green-colored 
floor tiles) to "Old Sparky"--the electric chair.  Inmates Eduard "Del" 
Delacroix (Michael Jeter) and Arlen Bitterbuck (Graham Greene) are 
joined by "Wild Bill" Wharton (Sam Rockwell), an vile inmate who Warden 
Hal Moores (James Cromwell) describes as a "problem child", and John 
Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a magnificently large man accused of 
raping and killing two young girls--and in a study of contrasts, Coffey 
is brought in to Death Row's E-block by Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), 
a small (in every way) man whose sense of self-worth is achieved solely 
through his connections to the state governor.  Edgecomb and his crew's 
task of leading the inmates to their death, as calmly as possible, is 
hindered by Percy's small-mindness - but Coffey has a special gift that 
will play a significant role in all of their lives (not to mention the 
life of a wee rodent...)</P>
<PRE>The Upshot:
Wow.  But I said that already.</PRE>
<P>I prepared myself for "The Green Mile" keeping a few things in mind from 
what I've read about the movie in the trade mags, and saw in various 
trailers: first, that the character John Coffey was a big ("huge", 
actually, fits better) Black man accused of rape and murder in the South 
of the 1930's--which is to say, there'd likely be plenty for me to write 
about in the "Black Factor"; second, that there was some conceptual 
"magic" involved in the story (which meant that my Suspension Of 
Disbelief bar would have to be raised a bit); and third, that I'd 
probably want to go to the bathroom beforehand, since at 3 hours and 15 
minutes (with trailers), it'd be a long stretch.  Armed with the 
knowledge of these things, and that this flick is based on horror 
novelist Steven King's novella, I went in prepared for anything to 
happen.  And came out awed. </P>
<P>Reminiscent of King's previous against-the-grain work, "The Shawshank 
Redemption", TGM lived up to its hype, and then some.  The protagonists 
in each--Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins in "Shawshank",  Hanks and 
Duncan here--have similar roles to play in each others' lives; and 
though "Shawshank" was more about the prisoners than "Mile", they both 
reflected excellently on how prison affects the guards as well as the 
guarded.  (As an aside, I had the privilege of watching both "Shawshank" 
and "Mile" with a Corrections Officer--my husband, Bear--and was 
heartened by his saying that he tries to be the kind of guard that Paul 
was; though "The Green Mile" was a fable, the idea that the kind of 
guard that Percy was--a troublemaker who could only be strong if others 
were weak--was not someone to be emulated, wasn't lost on either of us).</P>
<P>The performances were outstanding; there was hardly a missed note from 
any of the actors.  Of the three leads that are normally bandied about, 
Hanks was as Oscar-worthy as he has been in the past, playing a man 
whose pain goes deeper, much deeper, than the physical ailment from 
which he suffers (man, it's hard to believe that this is the same actor 
from TV's "Bosom Buddies", eh?); Hutchison made me want to pimp-slap 
Percy every time I saw him (which is to say, Hutchinson did his job 
well); and if Duncan doesn't get a nomination from this, There Is No 
Justice In Hollywood (yeah, I know; I'm just sayin'); who says that Big 
Men can't act?  </P>
<P>But the "secondary" characters and actors don't get enough props for 
their roles in this flick, so let me remedy that here.  As I said in my 
review "Crazy In Alabama", David Morse is one of the most underrated 
actors in the business; neither acquiesent nor living up to his moniker, 
Brutal had my attention in every scene he was in, and it's a tribute to 
Morse's acting skills that he was more than able to hold his own against 
the Powerhouse Three that are Hanks, Duncan and Hutchison.  DeMunn and 
Pepper blended more into the background, but that's pretty much where 
their characters should've been; Cromwell, like Morse, is an 
extraordinary character actor, and his warden, grieving over the illness 
of his wife Melinda (Patricia Clarkson) showed a more tender side of 
Cromwell than he usually plays (Clarkson, on the other hand, just on 
this side of hammy; fortunately, we didn't see her for long).  Michael 
Jeter, as creole inmate Delacroix, was interesting though a little 
annoying; Green's Bitterbuck was barely there; having only a few lines, 
maybe his performance mostly wound up on the cutting-room floor; but the 
inmate to watch was the villainous (though amusing at times) Wild Bill.  
Whoever came up with the term "over-the-top", must've had Sam Rockwell 
in mind; but "over-the-top" was what Wild Bill called for, and Rockwell 
delivered.</P>
<P>As Jan Edgecomb, Bonnie Hunt once again added a playful quietness to a 
supporting-wife role, that matched Hanks' Paul Edgecomb nearly perfectly 
(the picnic scene with their knowing glances, was nice to see with 
someone I've shared such glances with); and nearly stealing the show was 
Harry Dean Stanton as Toot-Toot.  Besides the creepiness of the actor 
sharing a name with one of the characters, Toot-Toot was a riot ("still 
prayin' down here!").  And though he was in a 
blink-and-you'll-almost-miss-it cameo, Gary Sinise, Hanks' co-star from 
"Forrest Gump", makes an appearance as Coffey's lawyer 
(court-appointed?) Burt Hammersmith, that, had it been dragged out, 
would've impacted negatively on the believability of the story.</P>
<P>All that said, I'm glad I waited until this morning to write my review 
(I watched it late last night, and was exhausted, but gladly so, when I 
finally got home); the passage of time gave me a chance to reflect more 
objectively on it, which allowed me to recognize some flaws that I all 
but ignored last night.  Length aside, "Mile" did lay the 
mystical/spiritual nature of Coffey on pretty thick; I haven't read 
King's book, but one couldn't help but notice The Point that was being 
driven home, especially in the scene where Coffey holds Edgecomb hands 
to "share a piece of himself" with Edgecomb.  Building on to this, the 
weakest link in the movie was the flash-forward to Old Paul (played by 
Dabbs Greer, reportedly because Tom Hanks didn't look right in Old Folks 
makeup); if we hadn't gotten The Point from Coffey and young Edgecomb, 
Old Paul made sure we did, with his speech to Elaine (Eve Brent).  It's 
too bad that this was included; it provided unnecessary foreground noise 
that distracted from the story, told well enough in the timeframe of the 
1930s.</P>
<P>But that was a minor hiccup; the body of the film played just fine.  So 
fine that, if I can ever block out 188 minutes of my time for it, I plan 
on seeing it again.  Can't think of a better recommendation than that.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
It takes a strong Black man, secure in his Blackness and acting 
capabilities, to agree to play what on the surface appears to be a 
"simple nigra"; but Michael Clarke Duncan (a former ditch digger; 
"Entertainment Weekly" did a six-part spread on "The Green Mile" that is 
good reading for a lot of background details on the movie and its cast 
and crew) was wise enough to know that Coffey needed to be played 
exactly as he played him.  Coffey's humbleness belayed an inner strength 
that was felt by all the characters--yes, even the vile ones; and unless 
I miss my guess, that was no accident of acting on Duncan's part.  Good 
for him, I say.</P>
<P>Further, the idea that TGM was Yet Another "White man redeems the 
pitiful pathetic Black man" film, is dispelled not long into the movie; 
in fact, the opposite is more accurate.  So to those who saw it and 
tripped out on his "yassuh boss" acting, remember the times and the 
character that Duncan was playing, and talk to someone that was from the 
South in the 1930s to see if his characterization was on the money or 
not.  And to those who haven't seen it and are still trippin', go see 
it, or hush up.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
I liked this quote from Jim "Chante" Hill so much, I asked him if I 
could use it here: 
  "If you crank out as many books as [Steven King] has, you're bound 
   to get a good one every now and again.  'Mile' is excellent, because
   like 'Shawshank' it is not a traditional horror movie but is rather
   an exploration of the good and the evil in man, cast in stark relief
   by the confines of prison."</P>
<P>I couldn't have said it better myself.</P>
<P>"The Green Mile" (rating: greenlight) 
A green light for "The Green Mile".  Seems apropos, no?</P>
