<PRE>Hi,
review below,
Best regards,
John Smyth<HR>Blade (** out of ******)</PRE>
<P>A review from the Stockholm Film Review
<A HREF="http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/heat/435/">http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/heat/435/</A></P>
<P>Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a vampire hunter with a difference - he seems 
to be part vampire himself. With the help of his assistant, Dr. Abraham 
Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), he emerges after dark to do battle with 
the blood-sucking creatures of the night, who prey on humans. The 
vampires 'infect' humans with their bite and contaminated humans become 
vampires too. 
Based on the eponymous comic-book hero, Blade is breathtaking in its 
monotony and lack of originality. The twist, if you can call it that, is 
that the vampires consist of two classes those who have always been 
vampires, and those who have been infected, but who were originally 
human. The two factions are engaged in a power struggle, with the leader 
of one faction, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) planning to overthrow the 
present leadership. And that is as complex as the movie gets, 
unfortunately.
The story of vampires has inspired many filmmakers, from schlock-horror 
hacks to A-list directors. Since F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu (1922), the 
themes of immortality, the allegory between sex and the vampire's bite, 
and the blood imagery have inspired works by Neil Jordan, Francis Ford 
Coppola, John Landis, Abel Ferrera and Tony Scott amongst others. 
However, David Goyer's script seems to be content to leave these themes 
unexplored and Stephen Norrington's heavy-handed direction consists of 
one tedious, overblown fight scene after another.
The prospect of Blade as a sort of iconic figure is simply risible. 
Wesley Snipe's performance makes one yearn nostalgically for Passenger 
57 and Demolition Man, while I hope Stephen Dorff sent a good portion of 
his fee to Kiefer Sutherland, since Dorff's performance is a leaden 
imitation of Sutherland in The Lost Boys (hardly a classic in itself). I 
can only presume Kris Kristofferson is saving up for something expensive 
as an excuse for appearing in Blade - I hope he got well paid. This is 
completely forgettable stuff.</P>
