<PRE>Crazy In Alabama
A film review by Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 by Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The human mind spends a lot of time trying to make sense of things. We devote
an amazing amount of energy sifting through chaos, trying to find the
patterns. It's why optical illusions work. It's why everyone has their own
ideas of how life works.</P>
<P>The idea that there is no pattern, no "why," is so alien that we reject it. We
need order and connections, even if they are illusions.</P>
<P>Attempting to find the connections between the two stories in "Crazy In
Alabama" is not only a fool's errand, but it ruins what might have otherwise
been an acceptable little film.</P>
<P>Lucille (Melanie Griffith) is fed up with her cruel controlling husband. He
beats her. He's kept her pregnant for years by punching holes in her
diaphragm. She's so tired of him that when he tells her she can't go to
Hollywood to pursue her dream of stardom, she poisons him and cuts off his
head with her electric carving knife.</P>
<P>She stuffs his body in the family freezer, drops off her seven young kids at
mama's house and hits the road for sunny California with poor hubby's head in
a Tupperware container by her side.</P>
<P>Back at mama's place, the influx of youngsters forces her to move Peejoe
(Lucas Black) and his brother, orphaned grandsons she has been raising, to
their uncle Dove's (David Morse).</P>
<P>Living in the small town of Industry, Peejoe soon comes face-to-face with the
racial unrest that was Alabama in 1965. When Sheriff Doggett (Meat Loaf Aday)
kills a black teen trying to swim in a public pool, Peejoe becomes radicalized
to the plight of Negroes.</P>
<P>So there you have it. Zany Lucille is driving to the big city on a one-woman
"Thelma And Louise" trek to strike it big and 13-year-old Peejoe is immersed
in the civil rights movement. What's the connection?</P>
<PRE>Hell if I know.</PRE>
<P>Sure there are some thematic similarities. Women and Blacks have been kept
down for centuries and both are beginning to awaken. But Lucille's half of the
film is played for laughs and Peejoe's is deadly serious. Although the film
was adapted from Mark Childress' novel, it doesn't work as one story. It feels
like the studio had two completely different tales and stapled the scripts together.</P>
<P>The frustration is that either could have been a satisfying film. Lucille's
search for self identity and fame has some hilarious moments. Peejoe coming of
age in the turbulent sixties is often poignant.</P>
<P>Either story could have worked. Not both.</P>
<P>It's too bad. Watching the film, trying to fit the two together, I kept making
excuses because there are so many good scenes. I kept hoping that it would all
fall together in the end. Ultimately it doesn't.</P>
<P>Actor Antonio Banderas' directoral debut takes a few more wrong steps than
just the juxtaposition of the mis-matched plots. Both have some problems. The
decapitated head talking to Lucille is neither funny nor entertaining. The
depiction of the plight of oppressed people told through white eyes is an
overworked error.</P>
<P>Griffith has played this part a number of times before and often succeeds,
especially in her "I'm so sexy you can't stand it" scenes. Unfortunately she
occasionally appears disconnected from her character.</P>
<P>Black is grand as the homegrown southern kid. His role here rivals his
performance as the trusting boy in "Slingblade". Kids who come across as real
children on the screen are rare. He does it to perfection.</P>
<P>A few of the supporting characters are strong also. Morse turns in a good
understated job as the liberal mortician. Meat Loaf's redneck sheriff is fun
to watch, cliched as it is. Rod Steiger show up as a judge at the courtroom
finale. He almost seems like he's in a different film than the rest of the
cast, but adds a touch of energy.</P>
<P>Wait until this comes out on video. Then do your own editing, putting the
scenes from each story together and watch it that way. You'll have two
acceptable short films rather than one longer one that just doesn't work.</P>
