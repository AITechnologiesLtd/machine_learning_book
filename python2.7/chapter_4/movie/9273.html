<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>It's difficult to imagine a screenwriter like David Mamet not receiving the
respect he deserves from the Hollywood community.  In 1992 he presented two
screenplays which made one good and one great film.  'Hoffa', the good film
starring Jack Nicholson was an original screenplay written by Mamet based on
the real life Teamsters president and the great film was 'Glengarry Glen
Ross' based on Mamet's own Pulitzer Prize-winning play.  Mamet received no
Oscar nomination for either script.  In fact, I believe Mamet has only been
nominated once for adapting 1982's 'The Verdict' from Barry Reed's novel.
 Mamet also adapted 1987's 'The Untouchables' for the big screen.  Mamet
wrote and skillfully directed 1991's 'Homicide' which made many '10 best
lists' about a Chicago policeman coming to terms with his faith and his
duties of conscience.  Mamet is the finest writer in Hollywood along with
other greats like William Goldman, Woody Allen, Oliver Stone and the Coen
Brothers.  All of these people have won Oscars for their writing but not
Mamet.  To many the Academy Award is of no great importance but even though
some say it's no big deal, they're liars if they don't feel a certain sense
of pride in being recognized by their peers.</P>
<P>In 'The Edge', Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin star as two men eventually
trapped in the Alaskan wilderness (the film was in fact shot in Alberta,
Canada) and they fight to survive the climate, hunger, the lack of shelter
and the occasional bear !  The story begins at a vacation getaway where we
learn that Hopkins is a billionaire married to a fashion model (Elle
Macpherson) and there are other assorted friends and business associates
tagging along including a fashion photographer, played by Baldwin who has an
eye for Hopkins' wife.  Baldwin suggests that he and Hopkins and another man
go on a short plane ride to visit a native American whom Baldwin feels will
be instrumental in photographing for his most recent layout.  Their plane
crashes and the pilot is killed and the third man along with Hopkins and
Baldwin is mauled by a bear leaving Hopins and Baldwin to fight for
themselves.  Before the plane crashes, Hopkins hints that Baldwin's agenda
for the trip is to kill him in order to claim his wife the fortune she will
possess.  </P>
<P>The interesting thing about this movie is that Hopkins plays his role of the
billionaire as a man who always desired to have something unlikely happen to
him so while he would like to be rescued eventually, the audience sees him
almost enjoying the challenge of being put to the test for his time in the
wilderness and his character never loses his cool and by recognizing the
potential of becoming a victim of his own panic and avoiding any sense of
shame that may do him in makes his character noble and beyond the stereotype
many have of the wealthy.  Baldwin's character is not nearly as interesting
but he pulls off his role with a passing grade.</P>
<P>David Mamet has addressed all the important formulas in screen writing such
as grabbing audience attention within the first ten minutes, having a plot
point turn setting up the important part of the story at about the half hour
point, keeping his writing alive and addressing the three basic points of
conflict, man vs. man., man vs. nature and man vs. himself.  With stimulating
direction from Lee Tamahori and sensational photography to boot, 'The Edge'
is a gripping morality tale which is absorbing, convincing and ends perfectly
in a very subtle fashion.</P>
