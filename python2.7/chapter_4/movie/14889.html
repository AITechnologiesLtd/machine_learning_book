<PRE>The Mask Of Zorro
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Antonio Banderas; Anthony Hopkins; Catherine Zeta-Jones; Stuart
Wilson & Matthew Letscher</P>
<P>The Mask Of Zorro is by far the best movie of the summer of 98. While
Armageddon and Deep Impact wowed we the audience with spectacular special
effects, no other movie was as much fun as Zorro. I've never been a big
Antonio Banderas fan -- actually to be perfectly honest I've never thought
that he could act his way out of a paper bag. Maybe in retrospect that's
because he has never had the right roles. There is no doubt that he was very
good in The Mask Of Zorro. It takes real talent to shine when you are acting
next to Anthony Hopkins in a movie. Hopkins plays Zorro, who, after being
imprisoned by the Spanish government escapes to try to make contact with the
daughter (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who was taken from him many years ago when
she was just an infant. Now, many years later she is all grown up. And may I
be the first to say WOW! Catherine Zeta Jones has got to be one of the most
beautiful women that I have seen in a movie in a long time, and unlike some
of the other lovely starlets that populate today's movies, Zeta-Jones is
actually a very good actress. But I digress. Hopkins meets up with a thief
(Antonio Banderas) who has a score to settle with some of the same people
that Zorro does. Since Zorro is now in his late 50's, he really can't don
the mask anymore, so he sets out to train Banderas' character to replace him
as Zorro. Going into much more detail would probably ruin the movie, but
lets just say that tons of sword fighting and other assorted action abound
in this movie.</P>
<P>I can't say enough about how impressed I was with Banderas' performance. He
was charismatic and funny, and if he can continue to find roles as good as
The Mask Of Zorro, he will undoubtedly become one of Hollywood's biggest
stars. As usual, Hopkins gave a tremendous performance, and manages to make
a role his own to the point where you could never imagine another actor
playing that role.</P>
<P>I can't say enough good things about The Mask Of Zorro. It was funny; well
acted; great sets; the fights were well choreographed and Catherine
Zeta-Jones, well, I could go on for hours about her. Do yourself a favor. Go
see this movie.</P>
