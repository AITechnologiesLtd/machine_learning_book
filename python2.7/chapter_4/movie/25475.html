<P>Ginger has been taken to the shed. There lies Mrs. Tweedy's new machine -- 
where chickens go in, and pies come out. Rocky runs in to save her, and 
together they must dodge chutes, chopping blocks, mincers, gravy squirters, 
pastry cutters and an oven.</P>
<P>This is an amazing moment in "Chicken Run", the first animated feature to be 
co-directed by Nick Park of "Wallace and Gromit" fame. The plot involves the 
escape attempts of chickens on Tweedy farm, where the lady of the house has 
decided to ditch egg production and focus on selling meat. If everything had 
been in the same vein as the scene above -- vital to the characters, true to 
their nature, staged excitingly -- then the movie might live up to its ad 
campaign, which hypes it as the latest kiddie flick to revolutionise the 
genre. It doesn't, and isn't even a very good film.</P>
<P>The chickens hold meetings in Hutch 17, there is a Cooler King and a 
hyperactive Scot, and a character played by Mel Gibson at one point shouts 
"Freedom!". But references to "Stalag 17", "The Great Escape", "Braveheart" 
and countless other pieces of pop culture feel forced, because they're 
stuffed into scenes without any thought, like a desperate attempt to make the 
humour hip. "The Simpsons" satirises pop culture with subtlety; "Chicken Run" 
feels like "Scream 3" for primary-schoolers.</P>
<P>That might be less irritating if the movie worked on some basic level. "Toy 
Story" allowed us into the world of toys, "Babe" into that of animals -- so 
long as we suspended disbelief enough to accept toys coming to life or 
different species of beasts communicating with each other. The creatures in 
this picture can read words, write maps, sew, conduct detailed medical 
examinations and perform amazing feats of engineering... so what's the point? 
Is there any interest or suspense in watching poultry act human, when there 
is no logic or limitation to their reality? The climax sees them escape by 
building a plane. Go figure.</P>
<P>Small tots will enjoy "Chicken Run" for its visual delights. The Claymation 
process here has advanced significantly from the "Wallace and Gromit" days -- 
it now involves a different form of shooting, and models built around 
detailed synthetic skeletons. For older children and adults, it's thin soup. 
Watching chickens behave like people, even if they have been brought to life 
with fluid dimensionality, is like watching kids dress in their parents' 
clothes -- cute and amusing for about five minutes, and then you just wish 
they'd find another game to play.</P>
