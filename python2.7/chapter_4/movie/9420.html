<PRE>The Crow: City Of Angels</PRE>
<PRE>Chad'z rating: ** (out of 4 = fair)</PRE>
<P>1996, R, 90 minutes [1 hour, 30 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[fantasy]</PRE>
<P>Starring: Vincent Perez (Ashe - The Crow), Mia Kirshner (Sarah), Richard
Brooks (Judah), Iggy Pop (Curve), produced by Edward R. Pressman, Jeff Most,
written by David S. Goyer, directed by Tim Pope.</P>
<P>The legend of the Crow states when someone dies a crow takes their spirit to
the realm of the dead, but if something went wrong in the land of the living,
a person can come back to set the wrong things right. That's a fantastic
concept, but "The Crow: City Of Angels" proves it's an idea that can only be
used once.</P>
<P>Vincent Perez stars as Ashe, a man who lives in an a futuristic version of
the Gothic city of the original film, only this setting is much more surreal
than Gothic. He and his son were killed when they witnessed a vile gang
killing, and much like the original, we are constantly shown flashbacks of
their execution. The problem is, as innocent as Ashe and his son may have
been, we don't learn anything about their characters. There's too much
implication of the good versus evil forces at work, and not enough detail and
depth to move us in any way.</P>
<P>A now adult Sarah (Kirshner) meets Ashe and explains he is an invincible
ghost who must get revenge. Perez makes for a convincing common man, but his
transformation into a vengeful, almost superhero-like man is not transitioned
well at all. He seems like Jean Claude Van Damme trying to imitate Brandon
Lee.</P>
<P>Richard Brooks co-stars as Ashe's arch nemesis Judah, who is some kind of
Sadomasochist drug dealer, who, much like Top Dollar, has a supernatural
presence to him. But Brooks is unconvincing, he is too cliche for his own
good, and the story isn't original or detailed enough to make us hate him.
Iggy Pop also co-stars as Curve, a typical villain who is more talk than
anything else.</P>
<P>Although the first film did not have a straightforward style to it, this one
is just poorly assembled to begin with. There are long durations between
scenes with important characters, endless supposedly evil rhetoric, overly
violent fight scenes that are not exciting, and a complete lack of plot. Ashe
is not as cunning as Eric Draven was, he seems to just stumble upon his
enemies.</P>
<P>The ending is so insanely strange (and just plain cheesy), there is no way
the sense of justice the film wants you to feel could possibly be felt. It's
hard to sympathize with characters who are just going through the motions.</P>
<P>"The Crow: City Of Angels" had a lot going for it. Its production design was
a bit too surreal, but certainly interesting to look at. The elements of
character, mood, and theme made the original excellent, this one simply apes
the mood and makes up the rest. </P>
