<PRE>REVIEW: Species 2
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</PRE>
<P>Cast: Michael Madsen, Natasha Henstridge, Marg Helgenberger, Justin
Lazard, Mykelti Williamson, George Dzundza, James Cromwell
Director: Peter Medak
Screenplay: Chris Brancato
Australian theatrical release date: July 9</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
Half a star</PRE>
<P>The premise of Species 2 is not much different from the first: a hybrid
alien/human is on the rampage in the US, screwing any and everyone it
encounters in order to reproduce.  Wisely put by Michael Madsen, "It
could fuck the human race out of existence."  And if this isn't an
example of cinematic dopiness in its prime, I don't know what is.</P>
<P>Returning from Species is Natasha Henstridge, playing a half-human,
half-alien government creation named Eve.  Also returning is Dr. Laura
Baker (Marg Helgenberger), who conducts cruel experiments on Eve, and
Press Lennox (Madsen), an ex-military assassin.  Lennox joins with
astronaut Dennis Gamble (Mykelti Williamson), and chases another
astronaut, Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard), who has been infected with
alien DNA on a recent trip to Mars. Patrick has cross-country sex,
impregnating hookers and, for that matter, almost anyone he encounters.
Thus aliens burst out of the women's stomachs, and in no time Patrick's
hideaway is chock a block with cocoons, ready to spit out fully grown,
deadly reproductive killers.</P>
<P>Generally speaking, Species was a largely entertaining piece.
Henstridge's seductive alien character Sil was tantalizing to watch; she
was dazzling when she took her shirt off, and spine chilling at the same
time.  Though it sometimes pushed itself to the edge of acceptance, most
of Species was guiltily enjoyable as a popcorn flick.  Dopey, yes.  But
obliging and exciting - and that's what really mattered.</P>
<P>Species 2 quickly finds itself full of the cliches and witless formulas
that its predecessor only narrowly avoided.  The characters appear as
lifeless textbook creations, the action scenes look amateur and the
special effects are dull and somber.  It's a pity that the screenplay by
Chris Brancato (Hoodlum) has not been able to defy all odds, and make a
film with a silly initial idea become a film with a worthwhile Sci Fi
flavour, letting us suspend disbelief for the parts that don't make much
sense.  But Brancato's writing is so consistently sluggish, so
consistently stale that it ends up not only being a terrible Sci Fi, but
also a terrible drama and a terrible action adventure.</P>
<P>But whatever it is, Species 2 is definitely not a terrible comedy.  It's
just a shame that the most funny parts - and boy, there are quite a few
of them - are it's most important, "serious" parts.  At the media
screening, howls of laughter flew over the audience; with seemingly
everyone eager to mock the film's pitiful dialogue.  It may not have
been widely enjoyed, but people sure did enjoy not enjoying it.  Simply,
because it is that bad.</P>
<P>I cannot understand why James Crowell decided to play the degrading part
of Patrick's father, Senator Ross.  It's hard to believe that this is
the same man who was Oscar nominated for his memorable performance in
Babe, and who delivered a dynamic role in L.A. Confidential.  And for
that matter, why Ben Kingsley played one of the main parts in Species.</P>
<P>As for the other cast members, Michael Madsen looks good on the screen
in his relaxed role, but there's not much else he can do with a script
as bogged down as this.  Justin Lazard is as stiff as a board and twice
as boring, whilst Natasha Henstridge performs adequately but ultimately
serves simply as something nice to look at.</P>
<P>I can't say that I couldn't have seen this coming.  When I informed my
local video clerk that the film was a disaster, he replied "You mean you
needed to see it to know that?"  But even if, like me, you did enjoy
Species, some valuable advice would be to stay far away from its sequel.
Species 2 is without a doubt the worst written, and most horrifically
sluggish film so far this year.</P>
