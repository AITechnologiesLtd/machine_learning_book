<PRE>                            UN AIR DE FAMILLE
                      A film review by Bradley Null
                       Copyright 1999 Bradley Null</PRE>
<P>There are exactly three moments in this movie that are really worth
watching, and one of them comes when a fashionable woman's choker is
mistaken for a dog collar (an obvious joke I know, but always funny). 
The other two moments are the only two times that this relentless work
of realism even begins to approach optimism.  </P>
<P>UN AIR DE FAMILLE, or "Family Resemblances" by its English title, is
your typical under-drama from the French cinema.  It is a single setting
observation of the interactions of an estranged family at the weekly
family dinner, when tensions begin to run high.  I would mention the
performances here, but they all kind of run into one melancholy melange,
ultimately resulting in very striking resemblances between the
characters, at least insofar as my opinion of them.</P>
<P>Getting back to my opening point, the basic problem with this movie is
that it is quite simply depressing.  And isn't life too short to be
getting so depressed all the time.  Maybe some people can view this type
of film as an instructional feature helping us realize what not to do
with our lives.  Or maybe some get a kick out of realizing that their
lives aren't THAT bad.  Or maybe some really have lives as bad as these
and use the experience to feel like they're not alone.  In my opinion
though, the point of realist cinema is to display the apparently mundane
and find something magical in it, which UN AIR DE FAMILLE does only
twice.  Once, about two-thirds of the way through the film, when one of
the characters, Yoyo, celebrating her birthday is swept off her feet on
the dance floor.  And the second time, in the last scene of the movie
when it is revealed that not every event of the evening was a wash, and
something good may come.</P>
<P>But in the end, it is too little, too late.  You can talk about the
well-written script, the nuances, etc.  But if we want to analyze the
average family, we can go home for the holidays.  The real power of
realist drama comes out when it shows us how something extraordinary can
blossom from the ordinary.  UN AIR DE FAMILLE hints at this magic in its
last three minutes, but the first 100 were a pain to sit through for the
small payoff.</P>
