LITTLE VOICE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Painfully shy but with an amazing ability to mimic the songs and voices
of classic entertainers, including Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe and
Billie Holliday, LV appears at first to be a mute.  Her mother says that
LV, short for Little Voice, is called that "on account of being
soft-spoken like."  LV eventually speaks in her own, whispery voice in
the film LITTLE VOICE, but her preferred means of expression is to belt
out some old song like "Over the Rainbow."</P>
<P>As LV, Jane Horrocks, in a stunning performance, is so completely unlike
the anorexic she played in LIFE IS SWEET that most viewers will have
trouble believing it is the same actress.</P>
<P>The movie begins with Michael Caine playing a promoter who is known as
the "king of cabaret" and the "manager of miracles."  He dresses in
gaudy shirts and tons of gold jewelry in a failed attempt to recapture
his long-lost youth.  The agent is currently managing a topless dancer
without much talent, but he's dating LV's obnoxious mother, played by
Brenda Blethyn from SECRETS & LIES.</P>
<P>The mother is as crude and unlikable as LV is delicate and winsome.  The
mother hates and resents LV, calling her "dumb and selfish" and claiming
that all she does is "whimper and whine."</P>
<P>LV developed her considerable talent through endless sessions listening
to the old phonograph records once owned by her revered, deceased
father.  His picture hangs on the wall over her bed in the spot reserved
frequently for crucifixes.</P>
<P>When Cain's character hears LV sing, he sees her as his gold mine in the
making.  He books her into the local club, where, after a disastrous
first appearance, she eventually becomes a big hit.  The long, energetic
scene of her bravado performance is the movie at its best.  Great period
songs are belted out by Horrocks herself -- no lip syncing in this
movie.</P>
<P>The story contains many needless extra characters and subplots.  One
involves a telephone installer who has a wayward homing pigeon, and
another concerns a standup comic who isn't funny.</P>
<P>The movie, written and directed by Mark Herman, is based on the play
"The Rise and Fall of Little Voice" by Jim Cartwright, in which Horrocks
also starred.  Although Horrocks's characterization is phenomenal, the
rest of the story is not as strong or as fresh.  The film's ending is a
manipulative tearjerker that it is an unbelievable plot device better
suited for some other movie.</P>
<P>LITTLE VOICE has many magical sequences, but it never quite lives up to
the promise of its premise.  Stripped away of the uninteresting
supporting characters and refocused on LV, the film would be infinitely
better.  And rather than one big singing number, give her two or three.
Horrocks deserves them.</P>
<P>LITTLE VOICE runs 1:39.  It is rated R for mature themes, brief nudity
and profanity and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
