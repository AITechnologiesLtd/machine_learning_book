*** out of ****
Year: 2000. Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa L. Williams, Christian 
Bale, Jeffrey Wright, Busta Rhymes, Toni Collette, Dan Hedaya, Ruben 
Santiago-Hudson, Richard Roundtree. Written by John Singleton & Shane 
Salerno (story) and Richard Price (story & screenplay). Directed by John 
Singleton. Rated R.</P>
<P>Coolness is hard to attain. It's really not something you can learn: 
Richard Nixon spent much of his administration trying to figure out how 
to be cool, and he failed miserably. What's worse, he wasn't the only 
one. No matter what they do, there are some people that just can't be 
cool. Martha Stewart can't be cool. Barry Manilow can't be cool. Pat 
Boone, despite his most bizarre efforts, can't be cool. John Shaft, on 
the other hand, was one cool motherf***er. He was played by Richard 
Roundtree, and Richard Roundtree is cool. The new edition is played by 
Samuel L. Jackson, and Samuel L. Jackson can't help but be cool. His 
Shaft 2000, nephew to the original, fights a war against all the 
seriously uncool enemies trying to bring him down. The bad guys might 
claim money or racism as their reasons for going after Shaft, but make 
no mistake; the bad guys are against Shaft because they're jealous of 
his ultimate coolness. Can you dig it?</P>
<P>Shaft 2000 is most definitely a new Shaft; this film goes to great 
lengths to explain that Jackson's John Shaft is the nephew of Richard 
Roundtree's original, and *not* the same guy. He's angrier, perfectly 
willing to punch a suspect in the nose right in front of all his 
supervisors. His sense of humor is a bit stronger: he enjoys making 
threatening movements towards criminals, watching them jump, and 
laughing at them. He's also been updated for the new millennium. Uncle 
was a "sex machine to all the chicks," but the new guy was obviously 
brought up with a slightly more modern worldview. He respects women and 
keeps his distance, though he doesn't mind a bit of flirting now and 
then. This is a good choice -- the 1970's Shaft held a rather cavalier 
attitude towards sex that simply wouldn't fly in today's HIV-infected 
society. Shaft 2000 may be a flaming heterosexual, but he's not stupid. 
Secondly, a "sex-machine" version of Shaft wouldn't work with Jackson in 
the role. We all know Jackson is an actor of many talents: his line 
readings are perfect, making even the clumsiest passage of dialogue 
bearable, and when he's really on (as in the scripture-quoting scene in 
"Pulp Fiction"), his unmatched intensity can galvanize an audience like 
no other. Jackson, in most ways, is a far better actor than Roundtree 
ever was. But Roundtree had something that can't be taught: sexual 
allure. He has it; Jackson doesn't.</P>
<P>Therefore I find it amusing to read several critics expending great 
energy writing long-winded analyses that all boil down to one complaint: 
not enough sex. If this were a remake, I'd see where they were coming 
from, but "Shaft 2000" is very much a sequel, and as such, the new Shaft 
is in no way required to mimic his predecessor. Director John Singleton 
has gone on record as saying that he wanted to update "Shaft," and it's 
a good idea. The original 1971 film has many good elements, but it's 
also badly dated. Nowadays, it exists mainly as a cinematic relic, 
historically important to the development of black film, but not 
terribly relevant to contemporary society. The 2000 version updates the 
dialogue and attitudes, but keeps the issues that made "Shaft" and its 
fellow blaxploitation movies important.</P>
<P>Shaft is still a character that fights not only against criminals, but 
against an indefinite, institutionalized force. While his superiors make 
thinly-veiled racist remarks to him, Shaft watches a rich white punk 
(Christian Bale, in a one-dimensional, but effective, performance) get 
away with killing a young black man because of his wealthy connections. 
Shaft vows to bring him to justice, quitting the police force. But he's 
now got to contend with crooked cops, a local crime boss, calling 
himself Peoples (Jeffrey Wright, strangely compelling despite a 
caricatured accent), who wants to expand his drug trade uptown, and an 
eyewitness who won't testify in court out of fear for her life (Toni 
Collette). Singer Vanessa Williams and rapper Busta Rhymes give Shaft 
support as, respectively, an old partner and a loudmouth Rastafarian 
sidekick.</P>
<P>As in most action movies, "Shaft 2000" draws up a very clear line 
between who is a "good guy" and who is a "bad guy." Here, it could not 
be simpler: the good guys are cool and the bad guys are not. Shaft is 
cool, obviously. Ditto Uncle Shaft (the original, played again by 
Roundtree). Other characters are cool by their willingness to hang with 
Shaft. The bad guys, meanwhile, couldn't be cool if their lives depended 
on it. Christian Bale's character may have lots of money, but he 
wouldn't know coolness if it jumped up and bit him in the ass. He's 
thoroughly outclassed in a restaurant by the young man he eventually 
murders, and watching him stroll through the 'hood, with his cap pulled 
forward and his collar turned up, he could not be more of a square. 
Peoples wants to be cool, but his goofy accent and even goofier 
entourage keep him from attaining his goal. Dan Hedaya plays half of a 
crooked-cop team, and there's no way this guy can be cool. He played 
*Nixon* (in 1999's "Dick"), for God's sake! Shaft, meanwhile, thrives on 
cool; he does things a person of lesser cool wouldn't even bother 
trying. His coolness makes him invincible. What else then do we require 
of an action hero? Shaft is ideal because nothing fazes him. Under 
pressure, he always keeps his head.</P>
<P>All of this is neatly packaged by director Singleton. The plot is simple 
and easily comprehensible, the action scenes are exciting, and there are 
bits of humor spread here and there to keep things from getting too 
somber (Busta Rhymes provides the most amusing moments). So what if the 
conclusion seems to come straight out of nowhere in particular, and the 
characters' motivations are about as subtle as a shovel to the forehead? 
What really matters is that the new John Shaft stands as a fine example 
of how to be a cool action hero. As for his movie, it's cool too.</P>
