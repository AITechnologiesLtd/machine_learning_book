<P>     A word of sympathy, first, for WHAT LIES BENEATH's director Robert
Zemeckis: It's probably not his fault that DreamWorks has been marketing
the film with one of the most appallingly wrong-headed trailer and
advertising campaigns I've ever seen. My critic colleagues and I often
respond to certain overly-expository trailers with the comment, "Well, I
don't have to see the movie now." Never has that been more true than in
the case of WHAT LIES BENEATH. If you've seen the theatrical trailer for
the film -- or virtually any of the commercials or plot summary blurbs,
for that matter -- you've been cheated. WHAT LIES BENEATH is one half
creepy, effective suspense thriller and one half predictable, over-wrought
suspense thriller ... and the creepy, effective half is utterly destroyed
by too much foreknowledge.</P>
<P>     If you have the good fortune to enter WHAT LIES BENEATH without that
foreknowledge, you'll be introduced to Norman (Harrison Ford) and Claire
Spencer (Michelle Pfeiffer), a married couple in a newly empty nest after
sending their only child off to college. Norman, a noted genetic 
researcher, at least has is work to keep him busy; Claire was once a
gifted cellist, but gave up her career for family and is now left to
putter about their over-sized Vermont home. And with all that time on her
hands, she starts to notice things. Their next-door neighbors seem prone
to violent arguments, and she sees strange comings and goings in the
night. Soon, there are also some alarming events in the house itself.
Doors open by themselves, pictures fall from the shelves ... and Claire
becomes convinced that a dead woman is trying to contact her.</P>
<P>     You will find no reference herein to a later turn of plot that
dominates advertising for the film. There may be someone out there who
could be thoroughly caught up in Zemeckis' knowing homage to Hitchcock
(most specifically REAR WINDOW), with its instantly loaded atmosphere of
menace and a notable absence of underscore that makes many scenes even
more unsettling. Unlike that hypothetical someone, however, I knew what
was coming. I knew the developments that would dominate the second half
of the film, and their relationship to the events in the first half of the
film. I realized that my time was being wasted on a set-up that had been
blasted into irrelevance by some marketing wizard with an itchy trigger
finger, the sort of cinematic thickhead who would have looked at PSYCHO in
1960 and said, "Hey, let's put that girl getting stabbed in the shower in
the trailer -- that's good stuff." And I grew angrier, and angrier, and
angrier.</P>
<P>     I grew angrier still when I saw the frantic mess that DreamWorks had
seen fit to promote so hard. It's bad enough that the potentially eerie
ghost story of WHAT LIES BENEATH's first act turns into run-of-the-mill
run-from-the-killer movie. Worse yet is the way the film's conclusion is
drawn out to such an agonizing degree that the approximately 2,647
individual shock scenes -- each one accompanied by a burst of Alan
Silvestri's strings, of course -- become numbing in their every-60-seconds
predictability. The final 25 minutes of WHAT LIES BENEATH eventually
degenerate into such an absurd parody of scary movie climaxes I kept
waiting for a Wayans brother to appear and exclaim, "Whazzup?!?"</P>
<P>     I won't deny that much of WHAT LIES BENEATH works on a purely
visceral level -- I jumped a few times, I was tense a few more times, and
so on. There's also one great sequence near the end involving a threat of
slow drowning that works on almost every possible level. It's the kind of
sequence that makes it hard to hate a film, even when the people selling
the film show such open contempt for the audience. And really, there's no
other way to describe what DreamWorks has done. Their marketing department
has decided, "Our job is to get the people into the theater; we don't care
if we've ruined the experience of actually watching the film in the
process." I don't think WHAT LIES BENEATH would have been a particularly
good film even without that disastrous decision -- there's far too much
laughable dead weight down the stretch -- but it would have been a much
more watchable one. Critics are often accused of being too hard on films
because of expectations based on how much we know about them ahead of
time. At least this time we're going to have plenty of company.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 ass marketings:  4.</PRE>
