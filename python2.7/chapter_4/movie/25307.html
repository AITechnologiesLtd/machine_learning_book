<PRE>                              SUNSHINE
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Covering the last 140 years of
          Hungarian history and anti-Semitism, SUNSHINE is
          the story of one Hungarian Jewish family, each
          willing to do what is necessary to be successful
          and safe with the current regime and each
          finding it impossible to be accepted.  Ralph
          Fiennes plays three generations of fathers and
          sons.  The film does not quite live up to its
          ambitions, but in trying it is far better than
          many a film that succeeded in less ambitious
          undertakings.  Rating:  9 (0 to 10), +3 (-4 to
          +4).</PRE>
<P>     SUNSHINE chronicles four generations of the Hungarian
Sonnenschein family, from around the 1870s to recent history.  Three
generations of sons share a common desire to be accepted Hungarians.
They have more loyalty to the country than to their religion.  Each
finds sooner or later that they can deny their religion, but they
cannot become what they are not.  Each new regime uses the family's
Jewish origins as a weapon against them.</P>
<P>     Emmanuel has two sons, Gustave and Ignatz.  He also adopts as
his daughter his niece Valerie.  To his horror, as his sons age they
become romantically interested in Valerie.  Since he has raised all
of them as his children this has the feel of incest.  And there is
some truth to his fears because they are cousins.  But Ignatz and
Valerie as adults (Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Ehle) are willing to
ignore Emmanuel's wishes and marry.  And Ignatz has a bright legal
mind.  He is willing to give up his religion, change his name to the
non-Jewish name Sors, and surrender his scruples to advance his
legal career in the military, yet he is always limited by the
Hungarian aristocracy who cannot accept a man born as a Jew.</P>
<P>     Ignatz's son Adam (Fiennes again) makes himself the finest
fencer in Hungary.  Even one generation removed from his Jewish
origins, the Hungarian aristocracy still holds his religion against
him.  In the 1936 Olympics he becomes a Hungarian national hero.
And in his success he feels he is at last free of his origins.  He
is three ways exempt from the new Jewish laws that the Nazis bring
on Hungary.  But he discovers all the barriers he has placed between
himself and his religion are to no avail.</P>
<P>     Adam's son Ivan (a third personality for Fiennes), indignant at
the horrific treatment of his father at the hands of the Fascists,
eagerly joins the Communists to embrace their reforms against the
previous regime.  But he is unwilling to learn from the history of
his own family that political regimes come and go, but the same
prejudices remain with all political systems.</P>
<P>     SUNSHINE was written and directed by Istvan Szabo, director of
MEPHISTO and HANUSSEN.  At just three hours it strikes the viewer
not so much as being long for a movie but as being short to
chronicle a family over so many years.  Sadly, there are few media
for a drama whose natural length is something like five hours.
Szabo is able to give us a textured view of Hungary, occasionally
doing it by giving in to artificial devices, especially camera
filters, to suggest the age of chapters.  The change of filters
jarringly announcing the beginning of a new chapter of his story.  A
different filter still is used where there is documentary footage.
In each generation there is a different personality for Fiennes, but
each makes much the same decision to try to fit in and assimilate.
Each has the same pessimism that he must cover his origins and the
same optimism that it will help.  Each generation rebels, but at
last the similarities in the stories are greater than the
differences.   And over it all is watching Valerie, played by
Jennifer Ehle and later Rosemary Harris, in reality daughter and
mother actors.  The choice of Maurice Jarre to score is well in
keeping with its historical sweep.  Lajos Koltai's camera frequently
beautifully recreates Hungary through the 1930s, until there is much
less beauty in Hungary to film.  Viewers should expect some fairly
explicit depictions of love and just as explicit are the depictions
of hatred.</P>
<P>     As rushed as it is this is a film with a sweep of history, a
personal story within the turmoil.  It is a remarkable document and
one worth seeing.  I give it 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</P>
