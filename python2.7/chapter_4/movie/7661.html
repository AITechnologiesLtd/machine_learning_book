<PRE>               A film review by Matthew Ignoffo</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1997 Matthew Ignoffo</PRE>
<P>The film is well intended, but like many films of plays, it doesn't have
the impact. It is well done and has a good cast in a nice setting. The
first problem is that the character who is supposed to hold the whole
plot together (the owner of the house in the country) is such a vacant,
bland person (and is played that way by the actor) that the story is
just a lose set of scenes. Jason Alexander does a good job with the part
played by Nathan Lane on stage. Bobby, the blind lover, has a wonderful
sweetness that is really appealing. Hot latino Ramone is very impressive
as the "other man." John Glover really steals the film as two brothers
named Jeckyll -- undoubtedly an allusion to Jekyll & Hyde since the two
brothers are opposites. One is nasty and bitter. The other is very
likable and is dying of AIDS. We see most of the cast fully nude
although Mr. Alexander graciously shows us his tush but nothing else.
The mood, especially the mood music, comes off as a bit syrupy. But the
strongest appeal of the film is that it is about human relationships.
Ultimately it is not about gay men, but people.</P>
