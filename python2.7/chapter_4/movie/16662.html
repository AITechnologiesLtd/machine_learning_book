<P>Brendan Fraser revisits his role as the "fish out of water" from his famous
ENCINO MAN (7/10) hit back in 1992, while Alicia Silverstone continues to
don her title as the Queen of the cuties, in this romantic comedy released
just in time for the big Valentine's weekend.</P>
<P>PLOT:
It's 1962, and an extremely paranoid man suddenly fears the launch of a
nuclear war. He locks himself and his wife in a bomb shelter underground for
the next 35 years (until the radiation clears away), where they raise a baby
from birth. When the time comes, the boy, now a man, has to go "up" and get
more supplies, and if possible, meet a nice, healthy girl to love as a
companion.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Utterly predictable, this movie touches upon a cute little love story while
sprinkling itself with some jokes that work, others that don't, an overly
emphasized soundtrack and a nice chemistry between the two main leads. And
this is despite the fact that Brendan Fraser does seem to have played this
endearing dimwitted role once too often, and Silverstone yet to have
conquered her puppy-eye and droopy face acting chops (Darn all that, cause
she's still damn cute, and that's notwithstanding the slo-mo shot of her
triple chin chugging up and down near the end of the movie). Their cutesy
but highly foretold love story is one reason that I barely recommend this
film, but the goofy performances of the two seasoned actors, Christopher
Walken and Sissy Spacek, is yet another. Mind you, if you don't like either
one of these actors, skip this flick altogether, cause there ain't much here
that you haven't seen before.</P>
<P>I actually thought that the script could've been much, much funnier, and the
story a hunka-hunka more original, with most of the semi-funny scenes having
been covered in the TV adverts anyway. This film is obviously geared towards
those film-loving teens again, and I guess that in their respect, it might
just be a hit, with the presence of two charismatic actors, an overly slick
soundtrack and a Valentine's weekend love connection release date. But as
for the rest of us, I doubt that it will register any higher than a late
summer Saturday night video rental night tied to some nachos. Maybe even a
Sunday night rental. All in all, a brainless revisited concept done with a
hip 90's soundtrack, a couple of solid veteran actors playing funny,
charming leads, and an overall unmemorable time.</P>
<P>Oh yeah, and their characters are named Adam & Eve. Cute or corny? You
decide.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Brendan Fraser was raised in Holland, Switzerland, and Canada. He was
educated at the Upper Canada College in Toronto, the Actor's Conservatory
and the Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle. He stands 6'3".
Alicia Silverstone became legally emancipated at the tender age of 15 in
order to work the hours required for the shooting schedule of THE CRUSH. She
was turned down for the role of Juliet in 1996's ROMEO & JULIET (6.5/10), a
part that later went to Claire Danes. Her first ever acting role was on TV's
"The Wonder Years" in 1988. She was 12 at the time. She is also well-known
for her starring role in three of Aerosmith's coolest music videos "Cryin",
"Crazy" and "Amazing".
Sissy Spacek is cousins with actor Rip Torn, the man who played the
wonderful role of the producer "Arty" on TV's "The Larry Sanders Show".
Actor Christopher Walken was assaulted in a street in New York in 1980 when
he asked two men to turn down their music. His nose was broken in the
incident. He also worked briefly as a lion tamer in a circus at age 15, and
has a phobia of going too fast in cars.
Director Hugh Wilson's big-screen directorial and writing debut was on the
infamous 1984 POLICE ACADEMY. He's best known for having created, written,
produced, directed and even guest starred in the slick TV sitcom "WKRP in
Cincinnati".
Renny Harlin, the producer of this movie, is also a director in his own
right. He's done THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT (7.5/10), DIE HARD 2 (7.5/10) and
CLIFFHANGER (7.5/10), amongst others. He was married to actress Geena Davis
for about four years.</P>
