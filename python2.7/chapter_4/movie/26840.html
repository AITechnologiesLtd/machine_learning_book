<P>   When Texas Governor George W. Bush and his Pardons
Board refused to reconsider the death sentence against Karla
Faye Tucker, a national debate ensued and continued for, oh,
about a couple of days after her execution.  Though Tucker
committed an atrocious axe-murder in her youth while high as
a kite, she became a model prisoner, counseling others and
proving among other things that she would be no threat to
society even if released.  Patrice Leconte explores this theme
of murder and redemption, particularly society's ways of
dealing with one particular killer who, like Karla Faye Tucker
was out of his mind (on liquor) when he committed a
senseless crime.  His "The Widow of St. Pierre," following on
the heels of the director's "The Girl on the Bridge," "Ridicule,"
"Monsieur Hire" and other works shown in American art
houses during the past dozen years, joins two of France's
greatest performers for the first time.  Daniel Auteuil ("The
Girl on the Bridge," "Lucie Aubrac") performs in the role of a
captain in charge of the jail of St. Pierre, a godforsaken dot
on the map off the coast of Nova Scotia and belonging to
France in 1850, the scene of the action.  His idiosyncratic
wife, known simply as Madame La (an appellation used to
avoid calling her Madame La Capitaine), is played by Juliette
Binoche ("Alice et Martin," "The English Patient").  The
deadliest character is not the murderer but the eponymous
widow, French slang for the guillotine.</P>
<P>   The story begins when a drunken, illiterate, essentially
stupid and naive fisherman, Neel (the Bosnian director of
"Black Cat, White Cat," Emir Kusturica), senselessly stabs a
local resident to death during a drunken brawl "to find out
whether he was big or whether he was fat."  Condemned to
death by a court led by a judge appointed by Paris, Neel is
taken under the wing of the captain and particularly of the
wife whom the official loves very much.  While the residents
of the island wait for months for France to ship a guillotine
over to St. Pierre by way of Martinique, Madame La refuses
to allow the condemned to rot in jail but instead uses him to
cultivate her greenhouse, later lending him out to neighbors
for odd jobs.  After one heroic deed, Neel becomes the most
popular guy in St. Pierre, so much so that only the French-
appointed governor (Michel Duchaussoy) and a couple of his
cronies want to carry out the sentence required by law.</P>
<P>   While examining the theme of redemption and the effects
of kind treatment of unfortunate fellows as splendidly as did
only one other movie this year--"Quills", which illustrated the
marvelous effects of an Abbe's kindness on the prisoners at a
French asylum for the insane--Leconte uses gestures as
much as words to survey the nature of a government in
crisis, the boredom of life on a barren stretch of land, the
ways that the powers that be can corrupt a person with
money, and the courses of action that people can take when
in love or, conversely, deprived of devotion.  Leconte's
photographer, Eduardo Serra, depicts the tough lives led by
the people of St. Pierre by contrasting the dull, foggy air of
the town with the power of the ocean as it rages against the
jagged rocks.  </P>
<P>   Unlike so many French movies, the dialogue from Claude
Faraldo's script is relatively sparse, giving all the more
power to the expressions on the faces of the craggy men and
their bored wives, for whom this murderer provides the
excitement they crave.  Auteuil shows us a character whose
love for his horse is more powerful than his fear of the
French government, Binoche how passion for a husband can
pilot her toward good deeds for others, and Kusturica how a
a simple man, loyal to a fault toward his benefactors, can be
a prince among men.  "The Widow of St. Pierre" is as razor-
sharp as its eponymous widow is dull and rusty, an
examination of some of life's major themes explored through
the lens of some master story tellers.</P>
