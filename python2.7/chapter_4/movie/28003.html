WITH A FRIEND LIKE HARRY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Dominik Moll's WITH A FRIEND LIKE HARRY (HARRY, UN AMI QUI VOUS VEUT DU 
BIEN), a quirky and eventually dark comedy, raises intriguing questions.  
Can one have too good of a friend?  And what does it take to remove a 
20-year writer's block, especially if the writer isn't aware that he has 
it in the first place?</P>
<P>When we first meet Michel (Laurent Lucas) and his wife, Claire (Mathilde 
Seigner, VENUS BEAUTY INSTITUTE), they aren't happy campers.  Driving an 
old jalopy without air-conditioning, they have to endure the heat-flamed 
temper tantrums of their three young girls screaming in the backseat.  
It's a frustratingly familiar scene to which most parents can easily 
relate.</P>
<P>As Michel tries to beat the heat by splashing water on his face in a 
public restroom, an old classmate of his, Harry (Sergi López, AN AFFAIR 
OF LOVE), comes up and shakes his hand.  Looking like he's thinking, 
"Who is this clown?", Michel has no idea who this man with the frozen, 
silly grin on his face is.  Only after Harry reveals enough shared 
school trivia does Michel realize that maybe, just maybe, he may have 
known him a couple of decades ago.</P>
<P>The persistent Harry finagles a dinner invitation from Michel for 
himself and his voluptuous girlfriend, Plum (Sophie Guillemin), whom the 
credits list as Prune -- go figure.  Harry, who is rolling in the dough, 
turns out to be a big fan of Michel's school writings, including his 
poem ("The Danger in the Skin of Night") and his unfinished science 
fiction novel ("The Flying Monkeys," about gibbons with propeller hats).  
Harry is such an enormous admirer of Michel's work that he can recite 
Michel's poem by heart, which surprises Claire who didn't know that 
Michel ever wrote anything.</P>
<P>The ever-perturbed but resilient Michel has more problems than growing 
girls.  He calls his parents "modest pains," which is an understatement.  
Always butting in where they're not wanted, their most recent and 
unappreciated gift is a new, bright pink -- they insist it's fuchsia -- 
bathroom in the country farmhouse that Michel has been working on 
restoring every summer.  </P>
<P>But not to worry since Harry, whose motto is "Excess is the only way to 
fulfillment," is there to help Michel.  The story's dark second half, 
full of morbid humor, concerns Harry's unsolicited help with every 
aspect of Michel's life.</P>
<P>Only the story's predictability and the plot's long setup detract from 
its enjoyment.  The wickedly funny film leaves you with lots to talk 
about when you leave.</P>
<P>WITH A FRIEND LIKE HARRY runs a little too long at 1:57.  The film is in 
French with English subtitles.  It is rated R for language, some 
violence and a scene of nudity and would be acceptable for most 
teenagers.</P>
