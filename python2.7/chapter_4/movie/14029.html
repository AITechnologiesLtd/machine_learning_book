A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Stephen Norrington</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: David S. Goyer</PRE>
<P>Ingredients: Vampire society and culture, a half-vampire hero who hunts
vampires, martial arts</P>
<P>Starring: Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe
Wright</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Accepted by neither vampires nor humans, Eric (Wesley Snipes) is a
half-vampire, born of a human mother who was killed by vampires. He has
the strength of a vampire but the mortality and daylight immunity of a
human. Rejecting his vampire heritage, Eric now goes by the name of
Blade. He survives on serum rather than blood, and hunts vampires for
vengeance, using martial arts skills honed by years of training under
the tutelage of a friend named Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). Blade
slays vampires because he's hoping to find the vampire who killed his
mother. </P>
<P>In BLADE, Blade makes a moral decision. He saves a hematologist named
Karen (N'Bushe Wright) against his better judgement. She has been bitten
by a vampire, and has only days to cure herself, before turning into a
vampire.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), a megalomaniacal vampire with
minions of thugs, plots to capture Blade and use Blade in an evil occult
ceremony that will increase Frost's powers.</P>
<P>Opinion:
The visual artistry and choreography of BLADE, highlighted by excellent
color and camerawork, is superb. BLADE showcases the Filipino fighting
arts (Kali/Arnis/Escrima). The character Blade keeps his stances deep,
as in karate, begins his sword battles with a two-hand kendo grip, and
then switches to a Filipino stick fighting style as the fighting gets
thick. He also uses the occasional wrist throw or the handstand kick
(found in Brazilian Capoeira). Snipes does his own combat stuntwork, and
possesses a fast-paced eclectic fighting style. His familiarity with
martial arts and his emotional intensity as an actor make Snipes perfect
as Blade.</P>
<P>In BLADE all of the main characters are emotionally intriguing, whether
it is Blade (the vampire hunter who loathes himself for being part
vampire), Karen (the hematologist who learns that she doesn't have long
to live), or Whistler (Blade's human mentor). Even bad guy Frost is more
than just a cardboard cartoon: within the strict vampire society power
structure, he's fomenting a revolution against the older traditionalist
clans. </P>
<P>One main strength of the movie is its excellent re-interpretation of
vampire society and mythology. The characters act the way they do
because they live in a interesting world. In the BLADE universe a
powerful international vampire society lives quietly and secretly among
oblivious humans. Mafia-style vampire clans are ruled in a hereditary
manner, consisting of born vampires who follow traditional ways. A
faction rebelling against the ancient order consists of non-hereditary
vampires: bloodsucking bite victims who have survived, who are more
attuned to human ways (dance clubs, etc.), and technology. There are
also fanatical human cultists called "familiars." Secret power struggles
and cultural revelations (clan tattoos, hieroglyphics, etc.) make the
complete vampire world of BLADE as least as fascinating as the X-Files
or Star Trek fictional universes.  </P>
<P>My one complaint about BLADE is the comic bookish plot, which is just
OKAY. When you have a movie where your bad guy's master plan is to
"resurrect Amagra the blood red god" it kind of narrows your marketing
audience.</P>
<P>SEQUEL POSSIBILITIES:
A good BLADE sequel should concentrate on three pillars: all-around
character depth, action choreography, and inner moral
conflict/temptation. The action should be plentiful and chaotic, the
gizmos uncomplicated (no batmobiles or remote control mosquitoes), and
the villains should always be emotionally deep and steeped in lore (no
cardboard). This basic formula should then be delivered through a
down-to-earth plot that offers us glimpses of a hidden 'culture' that
entertains and intrigues. </P>
<P>For example, I like how the ancient and traditionally rigid vampire
hierarchy contrasts starkly with the disorderly, culturally relative
human world in BLADE. Other points of intrigue include: fast-paced
Filipino martial arts; Wesley Snipes' choreography input and acting;
uncovering hidden vampire culture, history, or power struggles, and;
deep or interesting ensemble characters all around, with many points of
internal or external conflict. </P>
<P>In the sequel there could be several points of dramatic tension, such
as: Blade forging a temporary alliance with someone he hates; Blade
dealing with human weakness, tragedy, or a young child; Blade searching
for his unknown father; clashing with other "day walkers" or vampires
with abilities similar to his own; crossing paths with evil or good
non-vampires such as HIGHLANDER immortals; being approached by someone
with a fatal disease asking to be bitten in order to prolong life;
reacting to tabloid exposure; et cetera. </P>
<P>For plot improvement I'd suggest a straight-shot, non-complicated plot
that's not too comic book-ish or over-the-top, with a villain that's
deliberately puzzling or enigmatic. The creators of BLADE should also
make sure not to go too high tech. Like the HIGHLANDER, Blade is
essentially a masterless samurai. He may seem to have strange powers
compared to normal humans. But the essence of Blade is that he relies on
martial valor and a personalized code of honor, while the unsuspecting
and pampered humans rely on political expedience, money, technology, and
moral relativity - - this makes the toiling Blade more human than the
humans (and stricter than the vampires).</P>
