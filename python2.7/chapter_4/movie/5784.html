<P>     There is nothing quite as sad for someone who loves movies as
watching a rookie film-maker who really wants to say something, but turns
out not to have very much to say, or appears unable to say it in a way
that connects.  Lisa Krueger states in the production notes for MANNY & LO
that she began with questions of "what is motherhood" and "what is family
made of," and you can tell that she is quite earnest about answering those
questions.  She has a Sundance Institute-approved screenplay, and all the
studied quirkiness she can fit into 89 minutes.  But Krueger has created a
predictable story with characters who still look like they exist on 3x5
notecards on her desk.  MANNY & LO is a comedy-drama without enough of
either.</P>
<P>     The title characters are two orphaned sisters:  16-year-old Laurel
(Aleksa Palladino), known as Lo, and 11-year-old Amanda (Scarlett
Johansson), known as Manny.  Runaways from their respective and separate
foster homes, Manny and Lo travel together, stealing groceries, gas and
free lodging in model homes in an effort to stay a step ahead of the
authorities.  There is about to be a major hindrance introduced into their
lifestyle, however.  It turns out that Lo is pregnant, and into her third
trimester before her deep denial gives way to reality.  Desperate for
someone to help them, Manny and Lo kidnap Elaine (Mary Kay Place), an
employee at a maternity store who seems to know everything there is to
know about babies, and hole up in an unoccupied mountain vacation home to
hide out until Lo gives birth.  Though they begin as enemies, the three
develop an understanding, and slowly begin to become an unlikely family.</P>
<P>     I suppose one of the things which irritated me most about MANNY & LO
is that for an ostensibly original independent film, its basic premise has
been done and done and done again.  As comedy, think of RUTHLESS PEOPLE;
as social drama, think of last year's WHITE MAN'S BURDEN.  And those are
just recent examples of stories which make the very Psych 101 observation
that kidnapers and their hostages aren't always so different, and
sometimes bond to fulfill their respective needs.  MANNY & LO doesn't
offer much of a twist on the movie truism that if the plot is about a
kidnapping, abductors and abducted will go from antagonism to uneasy truce
to friendship.  There wasn't a moment when I didn't know exactly where
Krueger was taking me.</P>
<P>     Her only chance at selling MANNY & LO was to create characters who
were interesting and worth spending time with in spite of the stock
situation, and she doesn't exactly set the world on fire.  Manny and Lo
are like a collection of eccentric traits from a screen-writing exercise
rather than fully realized people -- Manny collects pictures of happy
families, is obsessive about time and measurements, and sprays her
mother's preferred deodorant on whatever bed she is sleeping in; Lo
likes to practice for her chosen career as flight attendant by standing on
Manny's unstable back.  Scarlett Johansson and Aleksa Palladino look
adrift, young actors struggling to find the center of characters without a
center; it is as though Krueger had built them a house with lovely
curtains and landscaping, then didn't put up any walls.  Mary Kay Place, a
much more experienced performer, turns Elaine into something intriguing
almost in spite of Krueger.  There is a unique dignity about her, though
there are carefully parceled out hints about a troubled past, and Place
uses her own experience as a writer and director to fill in the blanks.</P>
<P>     I think there is a tendency to give first-timers the benefit of the
doubt on independent projects like this, because critics are usually aware
of the limitations of time and money.  I'm not sure that any of that
matters to the audience.  Lisa Krueger's intentions are good; she wants to
explore what can make a dysfunctional family functional, and how whether
or not you perceived your family as dysfunctional can determine the effect
it has on you.  She also leaves threads dangling, introduces characters
who do little or nothing to advance the story (like Cameron Boyd as the
terribly cute Chuck, who hands out his signature to Manny), and doesn't
direct her script with an eye to making either the humor or the 
relationships as effective as they might have been.  MANNY & LO is a slow,
rather simple and not terribly entertaining film, and that doesn't change
because Krueger is inexperienced, or a woman, or not working for a major
studio.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 parent traps:  4.</PRE>
