<P>   "Go," Doug Liman's film using a faster-than-a-speeding-
bullet screenplay by John August, borrows mightily from the
genre made famous by Quentin Tarantino, to show the frantic
antics of a group of adventurous twenty-somethings.  "Go,"
which was the hit of the recent Sundance Festival left the
auditorium crammed, 1300 people staying out in the January
Utah cold.  We can see why.  "Go" has everything the
youthful generation and the young-at-heart seek from a
movie, all spinning before us at high-octane tempos.  The
movie juggles what passes for romance among 1990s youth
with car chases, drug deals gone awry, a weird cop,
a hip dude that seems to have come from the 1970s
blaxploitation genre, and altogether an assortment of people
whose daytime jobs belie their off-hour penchants.</P>
<P>   Dividing the non-linear story into three segments, each
from a different character's point of view, "Go" at first shows
us a dramatic incident in the life of a supermarket checker,
Ronna (Sarah Polley), and then, by exhibiting the same
actions from the viewpoints of the people with whom she
comes in contact gradually allows us to see the whole
picture.  After his debut film "Swingers"--a hip update of
"American Graffiti" with its entertaining look at single life in
L.A.--Liman has come back with a better-developed, more
mature black comedy with action that spills across the screen
at a breakneck pace with ultra-contemporary, sharp dialogue. </P>
<P>   The opening story, which unfolds in a more involving style
than the subsequent pair, centers on young Ronna (Sarah
Polley), a supermarket checker who needs $300 fast to avoid
eviction on the following day.  Bypassing the usual drug
channels, she contacts drug dealer Todd Gaines (Timothy
Olyphant) and buys 20 hits of ecstasy for two customers,
Adam (Scott Wolf) and Zack (Jay Mohr).  Taking the bottle to
her client's apartment, she senses that she is being
entrapped by a police officer, Burke (William Fichtner), and
takes rapid action to escape.</P>
<P>   In the second segment, which involves Ronna's co-worker
Simon (Desmond Askew), Simon and his friend Marcus (Taye
Diggs) get into hot water while enjoying a lap dance in a
Vegas topless bar, while in the final segment, the most
awkwardly paced letdown, Zack, his actor friend Adam, and
police officer Burke are working out a deal to get the young
men off the hook for drug dealing only to find out that the
older cop and his wife are even more adventurous and kinky
than they.</P>
<P>   Liman must have had barrels of fun shooting this
thoroughly contemporary tale of mayhem and escapades. 
Taye Diggs stands out as Simon's friend in Vegas, where he
is twice mistaken for an employee--first by a man using the
bathroom who tips him for being handed a towel, then by a
guy who hands him keys to park his sports car.  </P>
<P>   "Go" is loaded with all the surprises that a viewer should
rightfully expect from a film with Tarantino earmarks and is
highlighted by a sharp performance from Sarah Polley--who
wowed the Academy and the public as a vindictive teen in
Atom Egoyan's arty "The Sweet Hereafter."  There isn't a
mediocre piece of ensemble acting here, as Jay Mohr more
than redeems himself after suffering through the torpid New
Year's Eve embodied in "200 Cigarettes."  </P>
<P>   Next time you see those innocent young women pushing
those frozen peas through the laser beam in the
neighborhood supermarket or the kindly, nice looking fella
lounging lazily in the coffee shop, you'll be able to imagine
the far more potent lives they lead to compensate for the
hours of mere existence.  The ubiquitous posters advertising
the film do not do credit to the comely Sarah Polley, nor do
they justice to the zaniness that assails these buddies in this
crackling good story.</P>
