<PRE>THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"I always thought it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real
nobody," Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) says in his most revealing line of the
Hitchcockean tale, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, by writer/director Anthony
Minghella (THE ENGLISH PATIENT).  Tom, an almost accidental killer, is
the hero of the story.</P>
<P>It all starts when Tom, pretending to be a Princeton grad, meets Herbert
Greenleaf (James Rebhorn).  Herbert likes Tom and thinks he's just the
man to go to Italy to bring back Herbert's wayward son, Dickie (Jude
Law).  Accepting Herbert's $1,000, the innocent, well-scrubbed Tom is
off on his big assignment to Europe.  The film, which could as easily
have been ironically titled AN INNOCENT ABROAD, follows Tom as he
quickly moves up in the world.</P>
<P>With his milk white skin and nerdy glasses, Tom stands out on the beach
among the bronzed bodies of the idle rich in Italy.  Law (GATTACA), who
looks like a Greek god, is perfectly cast as a guy who fully intends to
live the rest of his life on his father's money.</P>
<P>Set in 1958, the movie's lush color palate makes it look like it was
filmed back then.  John Seale's inviting cinematography gives the
picture a travelogue gloss.   But with creepy music reminiscent of an
old thriller and with the sinister events of the story, you may have
second thoughts about your initial inclination to leave the theater to
book your seat on the next flight out.</P>
<P>Using his newfound knowledge and love of jazz, Tom becomes bosom buddies
with Dickie, a saxophone player.  Soon Tom, Dickie and Dickie's fiancée,
Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow), become inseparable.  Not only does
Damon play out of character as a sociopath, Paltrow too renounces her
usually tougher roles for the part of a vulnerable woman who becomes
trapped in the center of a whirlwind that she doesn't understand.  All
of the acting is superb, but it is Damon's Oscar quality work that
stands out the most.</P>
<P>Dickie says that everyone has one talent (Marge's is making the best
martinis) and asks Tom what his is.  With deceptive honesty, he replies,
"forging signatures, telling lies and impersonating other people."
Truer words were never spoken.</P>
<P>Dickie grows to love Tom, but Tom is fickle.  As Marge explains, his
attention is like the sun.  When it's on you, you feel warm and happy,
and, when it isn't, you're cold.</P>
<P>Most of the surprising story, based on a Patricia Highsmith's novel, has
Tom realizing just how good his impersonation skills are.  In a
wonderfully nuanced performance, Damon reveals much while seeming to
reveal little about Tom.  Some of the twists in the plot are obvious but
many aren't.  The surprises are delicately presented with subtlety being
the story's trademark.  Tom doesn't plan most of his nefarious
activities, and the movie has that same easy naturalness as if the story
just unfolds organically rather than being tightly scripted.</P>
<P>The talented cast includes Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman as
two other Americans in Italy who find themselves caught up in Tom's
complicated web.  Philip Baker Hall plays a tough, no nonsense private
investigator.  "I don't care for BS," he says coldly.  "I don't care to
speak it.  I don't care to hear it."</P>
<P>"You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person," Tom says
perceptively.  Certainly Tom doesn't see anything wrong with his
actions.  He has no regrets.  And the subversive show has us rooting for
him all along the way.  THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY may be an odd and
disquieting choice for a holiday release, but it is nevertheless a
fascinating one.</P>
<P>THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY runs 2:15.  It is rated R for violence, language
and brief male full-frontal nudity and would be fine for most teenagers.</P>
