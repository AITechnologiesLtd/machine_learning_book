<PRE>                         INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                Copyright 1994 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT 1994</PRE>
<P>     There is a scene in INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMMPIRE when the nefarious
Lestat (Tom Cruise) takes a rat, kills it and pours its blood into a
wine glass for his new, angst-ridden companion and fellow vampire,
Louis (Brad Pitt) to drink.  This scene is both revolting and silly and
is indicative of the film's dual nature.</P>
<P>     Adapted for the screen by Anne Rice from her best-selling novel,
INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE is a story told in flashback by Louis to a
young interviewer (played by Christian Slater in a role originally
intended for River Phoenix) that begins with him as a rich, New Orleans
plantation owner who has given up on life after the death of his
family.  The lonely Lestat discovers Louis and gives him the choice
between death or eternal life.  Louis picks the latter and from there,
the story takes us on a trip through two centuries, from 18th Century
New Orleans to 19th Century Paris to the present.  Like the characters,
we live in the dark and are surrounded by blood, angst and suffering.
We watch as Louis struggles to come to grips with what Lestat, a
vampire who relishes his own evilness and who kills the unsuspecting in
large numbers, has made him.</P>
<P>     After sleepwalking through his last several roles, Cruise has
taken on a hefty challenge playing Lestat and the results, while not
disastrous, are not terrific either.  At times, his performance works,
the evilness and selfishness of his character is convincing and his
English accent isn't even that bad.  Other times his performance makes
you want to bust out laughing.  There are moments where, despite all
the make-up and fangs (created by Alien and Jurassic Park effect's
wizard, Stan Winston), Cruise's illusion falters.  The performance
weakens because we know its Tom Cruise and his movie star persona that
he carries with him from film to film lessens our fear of him.  In the
final analysis, however, Cruise is just fine, it's just that movie
isn't.</P>
<P>     Brad Pitt has the film's critical role and it is a difficult one.
He has to spend most of the time being terribly depressed, brooding
over his fate as he walks the dark, empty streets of Paris.  He also
must make a vampire, an evil being, sympathetic.  Pitt pulls off the
sympathy because his character loathes the taking of human life, but in
the area of the struggle to maintain his last few drops of humanity,
Pitt's performance comes up short.</P>
<P>     The toughest character to play actually comes off the best.
Kirsten Dunst must be commended for rising to the very difficult
challenge of playing the pre-pubescent vampire, Claudia.  The twelve
year-old actress (she was ten when she started filming) is able to find
the right blend of sadness, scariness, and even sweetness for Claudia
who is simultaneously innocent and evil.</P>
<P>     There are other vampires such as Armand (Antonio Banderas), a
400-year-old Parisian of the night who desires Louis and Stephen
Rea as the fiendish, clown-like Santiago.  There is quite a bit of
homo-eroticism amongst these vampires.  Their longings are surges of
desire for companionship, for mothers, for fathers and for lovers all
at the same time.  These moments are reminiscent of the old days of
cinema when filmmakers were forbidden to show a man and a woman in a
bed, even if fully clothed, much less anything more risque.  In those
days, the acts of love, lust and sex were suggested through looks and
gestures not all that different from the way the Lestat, Louis, Armand
and Claudia look and gesture to each other.</P>
<P>     For his part, Neil Jordan did an excellent job directing this
film.  There is a never-ending supply of stunning imagery and he was
able to get strong performances from each of his actors.  The film
pushes mood to the max with its outstanding costumes by Sandy Powell
and its period sets by production designer Dante Ferretti.  Academy
award winning cinematographer Phillippe Rousselot deserves another
nomination for this film's soft, yet dark look.  The score by Elliot
Goldenthal and the editing by Mick Audsley will make you jump out of
your chair, although, there were a few too many of these cheap
thrills.</P>
<P>     INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMMPIRE is well crafted but its lacking
narrative is often slow and just downright goofy.   It is successful in
de-mything the vampire, making them into real beings with real
problems.  Unfortunately, in humanizing the vampire, they become less
frightening and eventually, less interesting.  After watching Lestat
and Louis for over two hours, I understood why Count Dracula was the
prince of his kind.</P>
