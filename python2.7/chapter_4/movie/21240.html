<P>Antonio Banderas' directorial debut. Whoop-dee-doo! Melanie Griffith
starring in the role of a wannabee movie actress. Harumph...whatta stretch!
Rod Steiger?!! Yikes! These were all the things going through my head as I
approached the viewing of this film. Admittedly, I was not excited to see
this movie. One of the few films that I see for the sake of my movie
criticism. Having said all that, Banderas' directing was top-notch, Griffith
pulled out one of her better roles in years and Steiger, well Steiger,
you'll have to read on to find out.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Set in the 1960s, a mother of six children murders her husband in cold blood
after 13 years of mistreatment and heads out to Hollywood to take a shot at
the big-time. Meanwhile, her favorite nephew Peejoe is left back home with
some of her secrets and a dilemma, after he sees the local sheriff kill an
innocent black youth.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This film combines various elements from a handful of other films, beginning
with a solo THELMA & LOUISE theme, and actually manages to meche all of the
different situations into a cohesive whole by the way of interesting
characters, a sharp eye and direction from Antonio Banderas and a
captivating performance by Melanie Griffith. Thank God, she actually plays
something other than an airhead bimbo in this one! I also enjoyed the way it
was shot with both stories intercrossing one another all the way through
with overall effectiveness. I think the most credit has to be given to the
director in this case, who was able to juggle the two plot lines with great
aplomb, and bring out solid performances from all of his players. I thought
that both the kid and Melanie stood out in the cast, despite my initial
mixed reaction to his strong accent. Add to that an excellent ensemble of
supporting actors, including the always effective David Morse, the
surprising Meatloaf and the scene-stealing antics of the 'contender's brothe
r, Rod Steiger.</P>
<P>Now when you consider that I wanted nothing to do with this film before
actually seeing it, my recommendation should carry even more weight (At
least to those who care : ). One thing which does worry me about this film,
is the fact that it might never find a real target audience and get lost in
the shuffle of this weekend's five opening films. If so, be sure to catch
this movie on video because it really does offer many telling lessons on
love, persistence and freedom. And even if you're not interested in these
messages, you should at least try to see it because of the extremely
well-handled directorial debut of Antonio Banderas, a strong performance
from his wife, Melanie, and a hilarious supporting role by Rod Steiger, who
takes the ball and runs with it! Not a major motion picture, but definitely
one that ought to be savored as a major surprise.</P>
