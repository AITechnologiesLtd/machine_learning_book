<P>We know Ron Shelton can do sports movies. He has a knack for capturing
the familiar ups and downs accompanied by professional athletics, from
baseball (`Bull Durham') to basketball
(`White Men Can't Jump') to golf (`Tin Cup'). With `Play it to the
Bone', Shelton has
tip-toed in boxing territory. Unfortunately, `Play It' is not a sports
movie - it's a road movie
about sports. This sets up an unnecessary obstacle course that Shelton
has difficulty in
overcoming, and the audience is short-changed with predictability in the
process.</P>
<P>Right down to the bare details, `Play it to the Bone' is a guy movie. We
open in Las Vegas,
where the undercard match for the upcoming Mike Tyson fight has just hit
a patch of trouble.
One of the boxers is dead, and the other is doped up in a hotel room,
surrounded by half-naked
prostitutes. Joe Domino (Tom Sizemore) needs two new fighters, and fast.
So he decides to
recruit a pair of washed-up boxing buddies named Vince Boudreau (Woody
Harrelson) and
Cesar Dominguez (Antonio Banderas). As best friends, it's an awkward
position for Vince and Cesar to be duking it out in the ring, but a
handsome $100,000 purse aids in the decision
process. Within a few hours, the two chums are traveling the road to
Vegas, with juggled
girlfriend Grace (Lolita Davidovich) behind the wheel. `Play it to the
Bone' actually doesn't
venture into boxing until the final blood-soaked bout between Vince and
Cesar. Until then, it's a road movie, in which we admire the attractive
Nevada desert scenery and marvel at the
inconsistent attempts at solid character development. Shelton's
screenplay is obvious and
derivative, but to his credit, the story moves at a relatively
harmonious pace and the viewer's
attention never strays too far.</P>
<P>During their trek to Vegas, we are obviously intended to learn important
details about the
characters of Vince and Cesar. The extent of Shelton's personality
navigation leads us to the
realization that Cesar once experimented with homosexuality after a
humiliating match in
Vegas, and that Vince regularly sees Jesus. Great, huh? To add a little
dash of spice, Shelton
adds the character of Lia (Lucy Lui), a confused sex kitten who joins
the car pool when she
offers to buy gas and waffles. Although it's occasionally quite funny,
it's safe to say that `Play
it to the Bone' has its priorities in a tangle. The final boxing tussle
between the two friends is a
bloody, merciless war of well-choreographed cuts and jabs. Grace, who
runs from corner to
corner to offer advice and encouragement, can't bear to watch as the
bone-crunching battle
continues through several rounds. She has the same problem as the
audience: knowing both the fighters, she doesn't want either to lose.
The big scuffle, though exciting, is an awkward
predicament for everyone involved, and Shelton doesn't pull the right
punches to emerge
unscathed.</P>
<P>Harrelson and Banderas do fine jobs. I was particularly impressed with
Antonio, who is
displaying more range and versatility than his sullen `Desperado' days.
Both actors look very
convincing in the ring. With Grace, Lolita Davidovich creates an
interesting character. She
offers some feminine stability to separate the testosterone-driven Vince
and Cesar, and most of the time it works. Sadly, like many things in the
movie, her character is little more than an
elaborate cliché. While he totally explored the sport of baseball in
`Bull Durham' (possibly his
best), Shelton does little more than scratch the surface of boxing.
There is urgency lacking in
his approach, and even by simple guy-movie standards, there is something
missing. One thing
that is guaranteed - a Ron Shelton trademark - are a few raunchy moments
sprinkled here and
there.</P>
<P>Go with a group of your guy buddies, and you may enjoy this predictable
Shelton offering. But
overall, `Play it to the Bone' misses the knock-out. It merely circles,
looking for an opportunity
to strike that never quite arises.</P>
