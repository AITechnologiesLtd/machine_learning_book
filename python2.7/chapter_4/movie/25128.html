<PRE>THE PERFECT STORM
------------------</PRE>
<P>In 1991, the swordfish boat Andrea Gail left Gloucester, Massachusetts in
October, late in the season, because its captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney)
wanted to prove he could still find the fish.  He pushed his boat farther 
into the Atlantic than most boats normally ventured mid-season.  </P>
<P>Meanwhile, Hurricane Grace, which had been dying off the coast of Bermuda, met 
up with an old frontal system from New England and a new one coming out of the 
Great Lakes, rejuvenating itself into one perfect storm right in the Andrea 
Gail's pathway home.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Wolfgang Petersen, director of the below-water submarine classic "Das Boot,"
creates the surface maelstrom of Sebastian Junger's bestseller from a 
screenplay adaptation by William D. Wittliff.</P>
<P>The film begins on location in Gloucester, where the Andrea Gail's disappointed
crew receive less than their expected wages, even as they're thrilled to
be reunited with friends and family at The Crow's Nest, the local watering hole
presided over by Ethel Shatford (Janet Wright, TV's "More Tales of the City," 
"Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains" (with Diane Lane)).  Her son,
rookie fisherman Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg, "Three Kings") only wants to 
stay in the game to make the quick cash needed to regain custody of his 
girlfriend Christina's (Diane Lane, "My Dog Skip") children, even though she 
begs him to take a safer, albeit less lucrative job.  When Tyne decides to
head out one more time, Shatford signs up as does old salt Murph (John C. 
Reilly, "Magnolia"), who's paying child support to a wife he still loves but 
lost over his seafaring absences.  Bugsy (John Hawkes (I), "Blue Streak) is
attempting to begin a new relationship with Irene (Rusty Schwimmer, "Amistad")
the night before they sail, while Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne, "A Price Above
Rubies") kisses goodbye the blonde he just kissed hello.  Tyne also
recruits new crew member Sully (William Fichtner, "Go") which doesn't go 
down well with Murph because the man once had an affair with his ex-wife.</P>
<P>The trip seems jinxed from the outset as the swordfish supply dries up and
Bobby has a run-in with a shark that's hauled aboard.  Murphy gets hauled
overboard and under when he's hooked by a line (ironically it's Sully who
dives in first to save him) and a rogue wave challenges the whole crew.
Then Tyne announces he's heading for the Finnish Cap, a distant point that 
causes grumbling among the men until they begin to haul in swordfish like
there's no tomorrow.  Meanwhile, the audience is clued in to the birth of the
devasting storm by witnessing the plight of three people (Bob Gunton,
Karen Allen and Cherry Jones) forced to issue Mayday from a yacht and
the weather reports being watched in fear back on the barstools of Gloucester.</P>
<P>"The Perfect Storm" bears some resemblance to another seafaring flick,
Stephen Spielberg's "Amistad," a film of quality that demanded admiration
without quite achieving a strong emotional response in the viewer.  
Petersen and his special effects/technical crew deliver an astoundingly
realistic storm and put the viewer into the thick of it, whether on
the Gail or inside a Coast Guard rescue copter.  The screenplay establishes
character background, yet once on the boat, the Andrea Gail's crew isn't
all that distinguishable in the face of the elements, unlike, say the three
disparate shark hunters of "Jaws."  They become symbols of 'man
against nature,' while the women at home too fleetingly (yet ably) provide
the emotional impact.</P>
<P>Better is the irony that those who suffered - both the luxury yacht 
vacationers and the blue collar fisherman, wouldn't have been in their 
ultimate predicaments if it weren't for the almighty dollar (the yacht's 
owner foolishing refuses to abandon his boat and the Gloucestermen decide to 
head back through the storm instead of losing their 60,000 lbs. of swordfish), 
although this doesn't extend to the heroic rescuers, one of whom was lost.</P>
<P>"The Perfect Storm" boasts a fine cast, yet the standout performances are
to be found in minor supporting players.  Janet Wright embodies the tough
and gruffly tender North Shore bartender Ethel, whom the fishermen's women
lean on.  Two beautifully real, funny and honest moments are
created between Hodge's hopeful Bugsy and Rusty Schwimmer's initially
distrustful Irene.  The bigger stars are solid, although a concensus of 
emphasis on the Boston area accent would have been nice, with native son
Wahlberg underplaying his, Diane Lane pushing hers north to Maine and
the rest waffling to varying degrees in the middle.</P>
<P>Technically the film is top notch with the aforementioned effects,
cinematography by John Seale ("The Talented Mr. Ripley"), editting
by Richard Francis-Bruce and sound by Keith A. Wester and Eric Gotthelf -
these are the credits that are most likely to be rewarded with Oscar
nominations.  James Horner's ("Titanic") score, however, is rather 
pedestrian.</P>

<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>The swordfish boat Andrea Gail, also called a long-liner for the miles of
fishing gear they play out for a night's fishing, has not had a good season.
Her captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney), has always prided himself on "getting 
the fish," so he decides to take the risk of a late season run, unknowingly 
setting a course that will bring him and his crew in harm's way of director 
Wolfgang Petersen's "The Perfect Storm."</P>
<P>The lucrative North Atlantic fishing grounds is a hard place to make a living
in the best of weather. In 1991, late season hurricane Grace took an
uncharacteristic turn away from the East Coast of the United States and
barreled out into the Atlantic. Simultaneously, two other storms formed nearby 
with alarming intensity. These three massive weather systems collided directly 
in the path of the Andrea Gail and these events are brought to life on the big 
screen from Sebastian Junger's book, the true-life adventure, "The Perfect 
Storm."  The book covers far more than the fate of the missing Gloucester boat 
and deals with the destiny of other unfortunates who experience the real power 
of Mother Nature. As expected, the film has a very different focus than the 
Junger nonfiction novel.</P>
<P>The movie, directed by the talented Wolfgang Petersen ("Das Boot") and adapted
for the screen by William D. Wittliff and Bo Goldman, takes the essence of the
very technical details of Junger's book and gives it a human face. As you'd
expect in a major F/X event film such as "The Perfect Storm," the emphasis is
on the raw power of the gigantic storm. The characters are introduced quickly,
personalities and conflicts are established immediately, then the filmmakers
get down to the business of making an epic scale disaster flick. The actors 
aren't just along for the ride, but they do take a back seat to the stupendous 
storm of the title.</P>
<P>As such, "The Perfect Storm" does exactly what it sets out to do. Petersen and
his team pour their film crafting talents into the project and come out with a
first rate adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat once the action
begins. The seamless nature of the awesome storm effects defies the viewer to
see the F/X sleight of hand that takes place on the screen. The immensity of
the perfect storm is depicted with an incredible realism that makes you almost 
feel the rain, wind and waves. And there are some big mutha waves!</P>
<P>The screenplay centers on the last trip of the doomed Andrea Gail, one of the
Gloucester fishing fleet that survives on its annual haul of swordfish. It's a
fickle business, though, and the key is not to catch the most fish, but to get
it back to port first, when the prices are best. Captain Tyne gambles that
being the only sworder out in the stormy Atlantic in November is worth the risk 
to get a successful haul. The captain and his crew, going much farther out than 
normal this trip, make a killing and fill the holds with swordfish. The giant 
storm is not a problem - until the ship's ice making machine irreparably breaks 
down, forcing the Andrea Gail to save the catch by taking the direct path home 
- into the heart of the storm of the century.</P>
<P>The production is first class on many levels. The working class, blue color
costuming, with loads of flannel, by Erica Phillips ("The General's Daughter)
practically reeks of fish. Set design by William Sandell ("Deep Blue Sea"),
especially the confines of the Andrea Gail, are convincing. John Seale's great
lensing captures the feel of Gloucester and provides fast and furious filming
during the action sequences. Kudos to the F/X team, with the help of Industrial
Light & Magic, that creates 100-foot waves, spectacular air-sea rescue action
and gut wrenching sequences that squelched any desire I had to become a
swordfisherman.</P>
<P>Although the cast of "The Perfect Storm" plays second fiddle to the special
F/X, they are, to a man and woman, professional and give as much depth to their
characters as allowed. Clooney plays Captain Tyne as a cool professional
sailor, but one whose facade is showing cracks in his self-confidence. Mark 
Wahlberg dusts off his Boston accent for the role of Bobby Shatford, the rookie 
crewman on the Andrea Gail who Tyne calls a natural seaman. John C. Reilly and 
William Fichtner play adversaries, Murph and Sully, who drop their animosity 
when danger arises. Those left back on land make the most out of their small 
roles, especially Janet Wright who plays Bobby's mother and friend to his 
girlfriend, Christina Cotter (Diane Lane).</P>
<P>More interesting and believable than "Mission: Impossible 2," but not nearly
the fun of "Shaft," "The Perfect Storm" is the perfect picture for the looming 
hot summer nights. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone planning a cruise anytime
soon.  I give it a B+.</P>
