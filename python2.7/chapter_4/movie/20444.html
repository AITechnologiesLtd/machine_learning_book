<P>Imagine Joan Cusack as a weird, wild and wonderful woman with certain
insecurities about herself, living in a town not unlike Mayberry or
Pleasantville. She falls in love with an older reporter (Hector Elizondo) who
comes into town trying to verify rumors about a bride who runs from each and
every wedding opportunity, hence Cusack. Cusack falls for the old tiger, but
differences settle in about age difference, and she confides in a therapist
(Richard Gere) who is a bespectacled man with a mustache - somewhere within
this stiff she finds an attractive man if he would only shave that mustache and
remove the glasses. Unfortunately. Gere has an attractive sister (Julia
Roberts) who tries to protect him from her wooing. Naturally, Cusack ends up
with Elizondo but there is a sense of bitterness and sadness that she did not
end up with Gere. Alas, "Runaway Bride," although be warned that the plot
description I just offered is not the movie itself. This is simply something I
thought of while watching and trying to stay awake with this stale, laughless
stupidity of a movie.</P>
<P>In reality, Garry Marshall's latest romantic comedy confection stars Richard
Gere as "Ike" Graham, a columnist for the USA Today who has trouble coming up
with any fresh ideas. He resorts to going to the local bar and is inspired by a
patron who speaks of a "runaway bride," a woman who leaves men at the altar.
Almost immediately Ike writes the column based on the patron's testimony
(though this is never really made clear). Women on the street berate Ike and
hit him on the head with rolled-up newspapers before he discovers a snarling
letter from the bride herself printed by the editor. Apparently, Ike
misrepresented many facts and exaggerated many figures. He is fired by the
editor, his former wife (Rita Wilson). Now, Ike goes to this picture-postcard,
Mayberry-like town and confronts the snarling woman, Maggie Carpenter (Julia
Roberts). She is about to get married again, and Ike senses that she will run
like a rabbit again. Or will she succumb to Gere's charm and smooth-talking
demeanor? And is it possible that good romantic comedies are a thing of the
past?</P>
<P>Basically, the formula is set up for this movie, and all the cliches are in
place, and nothing else. This is one of the most charmless, dullest and
periodically dumbest movies I have ever seen. How can a respected director like
Marshall reduce Gere and Roberts to cardboard cutouts with about as much sex
and romantic appeal as a pair of refrigerators? Roberts is actually boring to
watch in this movie - her wide grins and "duckbill platypus" mugging is
unflattering to say the least. Gere seems more stiff than ever, and shares no
charisma or chemistry with Roberts. Interesting, considering what a solid pair
they were in "Pretty Woman," also directed by Marshall. I never understood the
latter's success but it had gobs of wit and real emotions unlike this scrap
heap. Nevertheless, Gere and Roberts felt like real people in that movie - here
they are sitcom variations.</P>
<P>While desperately trying to stay awake, I noticed a couple of nods to "Pretty
Woman," a cameo by Garry Marshall at a baseball game, and a video copy of "The
Graduate," one of my favorite comedies of all time. There also is one good line
about Fed-Ex trucks, and a couple of briefly delicious moments by the droll
Elizondo. Outside of that, this "Bride" is of little merit. Even the quirky
Joan Cusack (not weird as she is described by Roberts) is often excruciating.
Jean Schertler as Grandma supplies a couple of chuckles but nothing more. And
for trivia buffs, there is Julia's sister, Lisa Roberts, as "Elaine from
Manhattan" in one scene. </P>
<P>Forget the silly "Pretty Woman," "Notting Hill," released earlier this year,
was one of the best films of Julia's career - she carried the film with grace
and subtlety and had the good sense of co-starring with the daffy Hugh Grant.
They had sweet chemistry and had a solidly good script to boot from "Four
Weddings and a Funeral" scribe, Richard Curtis. "Runaway Bride" has none of
those virtues and seems to have been made in a rush. My advice to Ms. Roberts
about future romantic comedies is to follow Lola's example: Run Julia Run!</P>
