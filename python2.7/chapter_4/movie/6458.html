<PRE>                            THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Jesus, I didn't realize when I went to the movies this morning I
was going to have to *think*!</P>
<P>     But seriously, that's what you're going to be doing if you see THE
PORTRAIT OF A LADY -- Jane Campion's follow-up to THE PIANO, based on
Henry James's "classic" novel that you've probably never read.  Now, I'm
wishing that I had, though, because PORTRAIT is a fantastic movie to
watch, exquisitely crafted and painstakingly detailed, gorgeously
photographed and full of style -- but it is just plain impossible to
follow.</P>
<P>     I mean *impossible* to follow -- I'm guessing that's why I get
copies of the production notes and why you get to read reviews like
this:  to explain the plot.  So here goes:  Isabel (Nicole Kidman) is a
woman in 1872 Europe who eschews the traditional life of the time (i.e.
marry a rich guy) and has the world's first afro (check out the
publicity stills).  She's a rare free spirit in an age of repression. 
Turning down suitors played by Viggo Mortensen, Richard E. Grant, and
AMATEUR's Martin Donovan, Isabel turns out to be pretty gullible, too,
and gets suckered into marrying the manipulative Osmond (John
Malkovich), thanks to the duplicity of Osmond's evil friend Madame Merle
(a nearly unrecognizable Barbara Hershey).  (Yes, it does sound very
DANGEROUS LIAISONS-ish.)  Isabel soon finds her life pretty miserable,
and then 124 years later they make a movie about it.  That's *way*
simplified.</P>
<P>     You're probably saying that PORTRAIT is probably not the best movie
material out there, and I agree, but if anyone was going to have the
ability to pull this off, it was Campion, and I've got to give her
credit for trying.  Unfortunately, unlike THE PIANO, PORTRAIT is
incredibly hard to get at, a dense and mostly inaccessible try at making
something into art.</P>
<P>     There's so much good about the film, though, that it's hard not to
recommend -- the performances are top-notch, especially Donovan as
Isabel's cousin, who really deserves notice for this production.  Kidman
is really coming into her own as a true talent, as well, and the
remaining cast are all great.  Again, beautiful art direction,
cinematography, direction by Campion, and interesting editing all work
to the film's advantage.  The only problem I had:  what's with the black
& white inserts, slow-motion, askew angles, and singing beans(!?) that
show up now and then?  We do *not* need another ERASERHEAD.</P>
<P>     Oh well... you should still see it, if for no other reason than it
will give you plenty of conversation material for a *long* time.  And
you'll get some interesting hairstyling ideas.</P>
<P>     [Be sure to listen for the best inside-joke line:  "I would have
given my little finger..."]</P>
