<P>I love movies, but every now and again, a stint of films comes along and I
just wonder why it is that I love movies so much. This past week was a
little like that, as I sat to watch THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE, WHAT WOMEN
WANT and MISS CONGENIALITY with very little enthusiasm invested in any of
the three films. But surprise, surprise, I really loved the Disney animated
movie, and an even bigger surprise, I didn't completely hate this movie
(okay, so two out of three ain't bad). So why is it that I continue to love
movies so much? Well, it's simple. When even the lesser films can actually
entertain me from time to time, the joy of movie-watching is reinvigorated
once again, even if it is just on a very, very fluffy level. Bottom
line...entertainment. This movie was just that...fluffy, cute entertainment.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A smart but clumsy female FBI agent, who happens to be a huge tomboy, has to
go undercover in a beauty pageant in order to investigate a serial psycho
case. Opposed to the idea at first, the "ugly duckling" eventually begins to
appreciate some of the finer points of being a lady during her
transformation, while continuing to work on the case.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This movie is all about Sandra Bullock. If you like her, like her
personality, her vibrancy, her humor, her goofiness, then you will more than
likely enjoy this fluff-piece. She's extremely adorable in this movie as she
trips over stuff here and there, kicks guys butts there and here, and
actually has us forgetting about the incredible dumbo plot-line of the
movie. It's actually the perfect "Sandra Bullock" role. She fits the
character like a glove. And don't you think that I will try to defend this
film's "Scooby Doo" mystery here, folks, because I will leave that chore to
anyone else who cares. I was cracking up pretty consistently throughout this
entire movie, so ho-hum plot-line aside, this movie worked for me. In fact,
Bullock pretty much had me at "hello". But before I continue to gush all
over her some more, allow me to try and make some more sense out of this
movie. Granted, the basic story's been seen a million times. First of all,
there's a crazy psycho out there who sends cops enigmatic clues about his
next big crime. Woo-hoo, unoriginality police...lock these guys up! Then of
course, you've got the whole "ugly duckling" transformation scenario, with
every possible "fish out of water" joke that you could imagine, topped off
with the typical beauty pageant jokes. But what can I tell you, little ol'
Sandy had me the whole time. But to be fair, I also enjoyed Benjamin Bratt's
performance, who is great as usual, but is now in definite need of a "real"
role to show the world his range. I mean, all of these "great looking guy
with a heart" roles are fine to pay the bills, dude, but you gotta break out
of that mold. Show us what you're really made of, you sexy bastard!</P>
<P>I'd also like to tip my cap to Michael Caine who glides into this goofy
comedy and actually comes out smelling pretty gosh darn sweet. Here's an
"Oscar" winner delivering some really hokey lines and pulling it
off...completely! I really liked his character, he was sincere, assertive
and even more importantly, funny! This movie is actually a perfect "video
movie". One of those films that you check out for the evening, turn off your
brain, sit back and laugh out loud. And please don't try to dissect this
goofy movie's mystery because it's so obviously NOT about that! The
"villain" in this movie is so ridiculous, that you just want to slap the
screenwriters silly for having watched too many Saturday morning cartoons.
This film is about Sandra Bullock and her cuteness...end of story. This
movie is also funny and a crowd-pleaser. It's got a lot of easy laughs and
plenty of well-intentioned hilarity all around. I usually lace into films as
such, especially when it's so obvious that not much ambitiousness was put
into the project, but you know what, this movie is a comedy and the bottom
line is...was it funny? Did it make me laugh? And the unequivocal response
to both of those questions is a resounding "yes", so if you take this movie
on its light, fluffy, cutesy, poopsy level, you will more than likely enjoy
it as much as I did. But please Hollywood (whoever you are), no more beauty
pageant comedies!!! For the love of God...</P>
