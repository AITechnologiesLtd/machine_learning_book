<PRE>     "While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand.
When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall,
        And when Rome falls - the World falls as well"
- Byron</PRE>
<PRE>"What we do in life, echoes in eternity"
- Maximus, 'GLADIATOR'</PRE>
<P>Amidst the mighty city of Rome, stands the Coliseum, shining in the sunlight
in all its splendor and magnificence. It is the greatest construction in
human history and a proof of that Rome truly is the center of the earth. In
it -- blood flows and heads roll amidst the laughing and applauds of the
noble crowd. This is the symbol of the Roman Empire -- a symbol of the
pride, mesmerizing beauty and inhuman power, but also of the savage
brutality of the Roman ideology.</P>
<P>It has been four decades since chariots raced and swords flashed across
movie screens in epic dramas of a time long past. Now, director Ridley Scott
brings the glorious battles of the ancient Roman arena back to the big
screen in a sweeping story of courage and revenge. The great Roman General
Maximus (Russell Crowe) has once again led the legions to victory on the
battlefield. The war won, Maximus dreams of home, wanting only to return to
his wife and son; however, the dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard
Harris) has one more duty for the general-to assume the mantle of his power.
Jealous of Maximusí favor with the emperor, the heir to the throne, Commodus
(Joaquin Phoenix), orders his execution and that of his family. Barely
escaping death, Maximus is forced into slavery and trained as a gladiator in
the arena where his fame grows. Now he has come to Rome, intent on avenging
the murder of his wife and son by killing the new emperor Commodus. Maximus
has learned that the one power stronger than that of the emperor is the will
of the people, and he knows he can only attain his revenge by becoming the
greatest hero in all the empire.</P>
<P>This is Ridley Scott's greatest and most successful achievement since 'Blade
Runner' (1981). 'Gladiator' is what 'Titanic' was supposed to be: a
combination of a dramatic emotional story, grand star cast and breathtaking
visuals. A film with spectacular locations, wonderous cinematography, fast
paced editing and heavenly music. But when 'Titanic' stopped at visual
perfection, creating merely an illusion of a great epic, 'Gladiator'
succeeds because of David Franzoini's complex script, multidimensional
characters and impressive acting. Russel Crowe , recently Oscar nominated
for his role in 'The Insider', is equally spectacular in his recent
achievement as the vengeful Roman general. It is a role that demands more
presence than acting, but Crowe has both. Scott , along side with
screenwriter David Franzoini ('Amistad') have created very strong, mature
and complex characters that are all spirits of their time. Maximus is the
greatest general of Rome and a loyal servant of his good master Marcus
Aurelius, fabulously played by Oscar nominee Richard Harris. Maximus was an
idealist -- a noble warrior that believed in justice, perfect worlds,
rightisnous kings and sacrifices for the greater good. But a tough life has
shown him the dark side of his paradise. He is a simple man with simple
needs. The endless wars, the constant death around him and his hands still
warm from his enemies blood, don't bother him anymore. He has become numb.
The only light in his life is the hope that someday he will see his wife and
son again. When he looses his master, his family and his reputation, he
cheats death and returns to Rome, with one single purpose -- avenge the
death of his family. He soon finds himself a part of a conspiracy to murder
the young Emperor, Commodus. Commodes is the most complex character in the
story and has a striking resemblance to Amon Göth from Steven Spielberg's
'Schindler's List'. A man that is capable of unspeakable crimes, and jet
never becoming a consistent villain in our eyes. He is a man with not so
many great qualities, but with great desires and ambitions. As the film
progresses, we get to know him as a person and dive deeper into his dark
heart. He is filled with emotions that he can not express, reaching for love
and respect he can not gain. Phoenix ('8MM') plays him fabulously as an
amoral, insecure young man driven to near madness by total power and the
inherent loneliness that attends it. The only support he thinks he has is
from his sister, Lucile. Played by Connie Nielsen ('The Devil's Advocate' ),
she is a wise, mysterious beauty. She remains at her brother's side until
she realizes the incredible danger, but then it is too late. In the latter
part of the film, we see her cruelly abused and mistreated by Commodes, with
her past intelligence and freshness lost forever. Proximo is an old
gladiator that gained his freedom with the blood of his opponents and the
will of the crowd. He is a lion. His eyes have not lost the fearsome power
and his voice has not lost its strength. In Maximus he sees himself at a
younger age, and this encounter awakens memories of his glorious past.
Energetically played by Oliver Reed in the last role of his life, where he
shows why he was elected one of the best actors alive. Proximo teaches
Maximus the tricks of the trade and makes it possible for him to go to Rome
and dream of revenge against the new emperor. All these lives and many more
are crossed together, woven into a magnificent web of events. There is a
great and touching friendship between Maximus and Juba, a good-hearted man
that has suffered the same fate as Maximus himself, is emotionally portrayed
by 'Amistad's Djimon Honsou . This friendship remains the only pure and good
in a world of blood and death. There is a very interesting and heartbreaking
relationship between Commodus, his sister and her son; and a touching
connection between Proximo and Maximus. The film is also filled with
intellectually stimulating conspiracies and betrayals -- the darkness under
the sparkling facade -- the Senate.</P>
<P>'Gladiator' is a perfect combination that will certainly appeal to the mass
audience, and although it's not as primitive as 'Titanic', it will still
rock the box office. But this is much more than a commercial success, it's
an artistic and intellectual achievement. It has an extremely powerful
emotional impact. Grotesque battles in all their glory (inspired by 'Saving
Private Ryan' ), a great love lost and friendship gained. Hopes, dreams,
fantasies, ideas and ideologies. Revenge in all its darkness, justice,
sacrifice, betrayal and destiny in all its mystique. This film has it all.
And it is presented in such beauty and elegance that it's impossible to
refuse. Although Maximus existed only in ancient legends, this film has
otherwise a very strong grounding in history. Both Marcus Aurelius - the
philosopher, Lucile - the wise and the Roman senators depicted in this
movie, really existed. As for Commodes it is said: "[He was] one of the few
Roman emperors of whom nothing good can be said..". Off course characters
such as Proximo are all fictions, but extremely effective.</P>
<P>Rome is recreated in all its splendor and power thanks to Benjamín
Fernández's and John King's magical art direction and miraculous digital
special effects. Here, even Romans would feel at home. Every detail is
perfect, whether it is the 100's of statues that surround the Coliseum or a
tree in the forests of Germania. The sets look even more real when you see
the costumes these actors are in. They are supremely crafted with every
detail taken care of. The lighting, the framing, the blue camera filters,
in-depth high speed filming of a war with the Germanic Barbarians and a
Gladiatorial reenactment of the war of Cartage. But what Ridley Scott has
achieved is much more than visual splendor. He has somehow recreated a
multidimensional picture of Rome, with its corruption and wickedness hidden
under the shining mask of grandness. He has created an uneasy and disturbing
atmosphere where everyone are against one another. Where everyone is talking
about the welfare of Rome, while thinking only about personal gain and
happiness. It's a place where friends smiling stab each other in the back --
the whole specter of Roman mentality. This is 'Spartacus' with all its
intelligence, 'Braveheart' with all its pumping adrenaline, 'Saving Private
Ryan' with all its openness and raw emotions, and 'Titanic with all its
visual splendor. Whether it will win the Oscars is yet to be discovered, but
one thing is certain, Ridley Scott has created a true and glorious epic.</P>
