<PRE>"Who'd win a wrestling match, Lemmy or God?"
"Ha, trick question."
"Lemmy is God."
                - Brendan Fraiser and Steve Buscemi</PRE>
<P>     Heavy-metal humor ain't easy as proven by the air-headed AIRHEADS,
a good-to-bad-to-almost-unwatchable comedy about an unsigned band
(Brendan Fraiser, Steve Buscemi, and Adam Sandler) that raids a radio
station to get their demo played.</P>
<P>     Hip helmer Michael Lehmann and writer Rich Wilkes target the MTV
metal crowd and, if nothing else, get the costumes and dialogue right.
Best exchange:</P>
<PRE>        "69 copies of MOBY DICK."
        "The book or the movie?"
        "They made a book out of it?"</PRE>
<P>     What's missing, though, are any *real* references to the genre.
Oh, sure, there's a cameo from Mr. Kilmister and a couple cracks about
both Vince Neil and Ozzy.  As well as a call-in in from Beavis and
Butthead.  But the real *meat*--the tunes, man, the tunes--is
missing.  Come on, a cover of Van Halen's "I'm the One" by Four Non
Blondes?</P>
<PRE>     Play some Sabbath, dude!</PRE>
<P>     Three stooges Fraiser, Buscemi, and Sandler are all
extra-appealing.  And co-stars Joe Mantegna (jock) and Michael McKean
(PD) both emerge unscathed from the plot-from-hell.  But steer clear of
Michael Richards, Judd Nelson, and Chris Farley.  They're not worthy.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:   For the definite send-up of the genre, pay a call on
               Penelope Spheeris and her documentary THE DECLINE OF
               WESTERN CIVILIZATION PART II:  THE METAL YEARS.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C-</PRE>
