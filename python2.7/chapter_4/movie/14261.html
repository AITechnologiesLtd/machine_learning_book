<PRE>THHE SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Tamara Jenkins
Starring: Natasha Lyonne, Alan Arkin, Marisa Tomei, Keith Corrigan, David
Krumholtz, Eli Marienthal, Jessica Walter, Rita Moreno, Carl Reiner</P>
<P>There are many reasons why I enjoyed "The Slums of Beverly Hills," but I
think the aspect I admire the most is that it's poignant but never
heavy-handed.  So many autobiographical films make sure that there are many
a funny moment, but then isolate those from the similarly isolated dramatic
moments.  It's as if the film would be the same if it just had someone
enter the scene holding a sign that said "Now here's the dramatic part of
the film."  "The Slums of Beverly Hills" doesn't do that, and it's still
poignant.  It moves effortlessly from hysterical moments to more dramatic
moments but never feels like it's overly organized.</P>
<P>But that's hardly the only good thing about this film.  "The Slums of
Beverly Hills" is a feverlishly entertaining film with a fresh take on that
point in all of our lives when we begin to mature sexually and we're not
quite sure what to make of it.  We all go through that, though not all of
us go through what Vivian Abramowitz, the lead character, goes through, and
that's the sudden rack-dom thereof (read: she got her boobies).  Nearly
overnight, she has jumped from an A cup to a C cup, and in the film's
opening scene, finds she's being given her first significant braissere.</P>
<P>Vivian is played by Natasha Lyonne, the wonderful young actress from Woody
Allen's "Everyone Says I Love You" (and, less significantly, "Krippendorf's
Tribe," which she was actually very good in), who has wild red curly hair,
and seems to be blessed with a face that is both in perpetual snarl and
forever cuteness.  She provides the voice and characterization of the
film's writer and director, Tamara Jenkins, who no doubtedly had a similar
experience back in her youth.</P>
<P>The film takes place in 1976, and we are introduced to Vivian and her
family, headed by her 65-year old father, Murray (a priceless Alan Arkin),
an unsuccessful used car salesman.  Murray's not the greatest father, but
he does indeed have a great love for them that's his big strong point. 
Vivian also has two brothers, one older one, Ben (David Krumholtz, who, I
see, didn't have to change him hair style after doing "The Ice Storm" prior
to this), a hilarious pothead/musical-freak who knows way too much useless
information; and a younger one, Ricky (Eli Marienthal), who's just weird. 
Together they're a strange family, but their strangeness is their own,
making them unique like every other family in the world.</P>
<P>Since Murray has so little money, they have to live in the lower rent areas
of Beverly Hills (they stay for the schooling), and are constantly being
awoken in the middle of the night so they can move to other places so they
can avoid the rent.  The film's main center happens when their cousin Rita
(Marisa Tomei) hikes out to the West Coast from the East Coast so she stay
with them instead of her tyrannical rich father, Mickey (Carl Reiner), who
ends up supplying Murray with a monthly sum if he watches over her and
causes her to try and get ahead in life.</P>
<P>So begins the rest of the film, as they live in a nice apartment, and
Vivian begins to learn all about sex, not only from Rita, who introduces
her to the enigma known as the vibrator (which launches a scene which is
the best vibrator joke since "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About
Sex," and one other extremely poignant and hilarious scene), but also from
a tennant she meets in one of her older apartments, Eliot (Kevin Corrigan),
a marijuana dealer who piques her interest for awhile.</P>
<P>"Slums of Beverly Hills" is wonderfully organized so that it's not so
organized, and as a result it comes off as a sometimes episodic remembrance
of an important period that is often overlooked in autobiographical films. 
It's as if it were a modern-day version of Truffaut's "The 400 Blows," if
it were funnier, less traumatic, and much more randy.  Tamara Jenkins finds
a strong voice, one that is very perceptive to what living in that time
period was like and especially what it was like living during that period
that we all go through.</P>
<P>The film would seem less substantial if it weren't for the flawless casting
of Lyonne, who provides the film with such a strong performance that it
avoids the mistake that many films like this succumb to: she's as
interesting if not more than all of her extremely eccentric supporting
characters.  Most films like this provide us with a boring, lifeless
protagonist, and allow the supporting characters to do all the work. 
Lyonne's Vivian is an increasingly watchable and lovable character, who is
cynical and curious about everything that's going on around her, and by the
end, she's the character we remember the most.</P>
<P>But while it's very personal, it also works as a giant ensemble piece, and
the supporting characters are incredibly wonderful.  Alan Arkin reminds us
what a cinematic treasure he is, with a performance which is perfectly
nuanced and the right mix between stern and malleable.  His breakdown
scene, though featuring an element that just plum doesn't work, is a sight
to behold.  Tomei, who's been in a bit of a career slump as of late, shows
that she's still a great comic actress.  Corrigan, a staple of indie/art
house films, gives a greatly funny performance.  And Krumholtz acts as a
major scene stealer, a more confident symbol of Jewish neuroticism than,
say, Woody Allen.</P>
<P>If there's anything wrong, it's that the ending is a bit of a mess.  A
series of scenes at an airport lack the irony and material to really
succeed.  No matter.  It worked for me in that it brought the film to a
satisfying close that is mature and intelligent.  Which is basically what
you get here: a series of sequences that mostly work, and others that fail
honorably, and as a whole, a film that's not only poignant, but perhaps
more importantly, entertaining as hell.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
