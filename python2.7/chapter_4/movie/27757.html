VALENTINE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Jamie Blanks's VALENTINE is as generic a horror movie as you're ever 
likely to find.  Starring a bevy of beauties who are sliced and diced by 
a killer with a big shiny knife and a baby-doll mask, the movie is cast 
with twentysomething stars acting like teenagers.  Between violent 
interludes in the Land of the Rich and Gorgeous, the story titillates us 
as the handsome characters frolic in their mansions.  </P>
<P>"Roses are red," reads one of the threatening valentines that come to 
our lovely lasses, including Paige (Denise Richards), Kate (Marley 
Shelton) and Dorothy (Jessica Capshaw).  "Violets are blue.  They'll 
need dental records to identify you."  So sweet.  Another time they get 
chocolates laced with maggots.  So tasty.</P>
<P>You could write the script yourself and undoubtedly do a better job.  
Still, there are a few parts that aren't bad.  One involves a trophy 
wife who swaps barbs with her stepdaughter of the same age.  Another has 
one of the lovelies rinsing her hair in the toilet when the water goes 
out.  And, finally, there is a Turbo Dating service that gives each guy 
30 seconds to make his pitch before being summarily rejected by our 
catty stars.</P>
<P>One of my favorite ridiculous parts occurs when Dorothy takes a shower 
and washes her hair, an activity popular in this show with exemplary 
hygiene.  Although squeaky clean, she manages to keep on her makeup and 
lipstick.</P>
<P>So devoid of any imagination, VALENTINE makes one yearn for such 
mediocre fare as I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.  It's pretty pathetic 
when you find yourself wishing that you were at a better bad movie.</P>
<P>VALENTINE runs 1:37.  It is rated R for strong horror violence, some 
sexuality and language and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
