<P>Like "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," "I'll Be Home For Christmas" is a 
cross-country road story about the travails of trying to return home for 
the holidays. Jonathan Taylor Thomas stars in this lightweight Disney 
comedy that, while far from memorable, is at least pleasant. </P>
<P>With holiday films of this sort, no one expects any surprises. Thomas 
plays a self-absorbed young man trying to go home for all the wrong 
reasons, and there is absolutely no doubt that he will make it home and 
will learn valuable life lessons along the way. It's a standard film 
structure and the entertainment factor depends on how well the filmmakers 
and cast connect the dots. In this case, the results are, well, pleasant.</P>
<P>Jake (Thomas) is a smooth talking con artist at a Los Angeles college. 
Uncomfortable over his father remarrying a mere 10 months after his 
mother's death, the kid has avoided visiting the homestead. Anxious to 
see his son, Dad (Gary Cole) offers a bribe: if Jake makes it to the 
family's home in New York state by 6 p.m. Christmas eve, he gets a 
vintage Porsche. </P>
<P>Things go awry, of course. A group of football players, angered over one 
of Jake's botched scams, dumps him in the middle of the desert, dressed 
in a Santa suit with the beard and hat glued to his head. To make matters 
worse, his girlfriend Allie (Jessica Biel) is also on the road east, 
traveling with Eddie (Adam Lavorgna), Jake's loutish arch enemy.</P>
<P>Naturally, as Jake strains to make it home before the deadline, two 
things have to happen: he must encounter a variety of colorful eccentrics 
and repeatedly almost catch up with his girlfriend. To their credit, the 
filmmakers show some imagination while working the formula. Jake meets a 
clueless thief (Andrew Lauer, the guy on skates from "Caroline in the 
City") and a heartsick cop (Sean O'Bryan), leading up to a cute scene 
that is both sentimental and funny. </P>
<P>A meeting between Jake, Allie and Eddie in a Midwest Bavarian village is 
also cleverly staged, although it contains a "Three's Company" style 
scene that falls flat on its face. Jake finds his girlfriend's motel room 
which, out of sheer necessity, she shared with Eddie. While Jake and 
Allie are talking, Eddie comes out of the bathroom wearing only a towel. 
Allie quickly makes it clear that she is not romantically or sexually 
involved with the guy and Eddie makes a smart-aleck remark. What's Jake's 
response? He inexplicably jerks Eddie's towel off, leaving the 
athletically-built young man standing nude in front of his girlfriend. 
The mildly-embarrassed Eddie grabs something to cover his genitals, Allie 
shows no reaction whatsoever, and I scratched my head, wondering why a 
scene as illogical, poorly-staged and unfunny as this one was left in the 
film.</P>
<P>That peculiar episode aside, "I'll Be Home For Christmas" works more 
often than not. The performances range from pretty good (Biel, O'Bryan 
and Lauer), to fair (Lavorgna), to cardboard (everyone in Jake's family). 
As for Jonathan Taylor Thomas, the "Home Improvement" graduate really 
needs to work on his facial expressions. Regardless of the emotional 
state of his character, there's always a vague hint of a smirk on Thomas' 
face, rendering his scenes of redemption less than convincing.</P>
<P>As far as holiday movies go, "I'll Be Home For Christmas" ranks right in 
the middle of the pack. It's mixture of smiles and sentiment is good 
enough for the film to qualify as a mildly pleasant diversion, but lacks 
that special magic necessary for it to rise above average. If you're a 
Jonathan Taylor Thomas fan, prepare for a veritable Thomas-fest. If not, 
rent "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" and see how the big boys work the 
holiday formula. </P>
