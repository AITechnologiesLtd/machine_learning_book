<P>It's a good thing WAG THE DOG didn't use some of the special effects Robert
Zemeckis favors (and heavily showed off in CONTACT), because if President
Clinton had been "morphed" into the film, Barry Levinson may have become the
Nostradamus of modern political scandal. Perhaps a sequel is in order, and
this time we *can* put Clinton in it, and this time we'll also show the
President's mistress (Monica Lewinsky superimposed into the scene), and this
time when Bubba bares all, we'll simply call it FLUBBER 2. Or, with Clinton
and Lewinsky both blended into the picture, maybe the suitable title will be
SPLICE WORLD. Oh what fun we can have watching Bill do a bad Blues Brother
impression, blaring on his saxophone while Lewinsky sings a catchy dance-pop
tune. ("If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with the Pres"?)</P>
<P>One must admit, the latest White House scandal riding the coattails of WAG THE
DOG's national release is more than interesting. Who would've thought this
movie would serve as the opening act to a scandal that has gone on to dominate
headlines and news magazines for the past few months? I can only assume it has
helped WAG THE DOG bring in more business as residents of the good ole U.S.A.
flock into theaters to see how closely the outside world parallels that on the
big screen. But WAG THE DOG's focus remains more on covering the scandal than
on the scandal itself. When the President is accused of sexual misconduct
around election time, he enlists the aid of the White House's top spin doctor,
Conrad Brean (Robert De Niro), to deviate the public's attention from such
crushing allegations. In turn, Conrad enlists the aid of acclaimed Hollywood
producer Stanley Motts (Hoffman) to fabricate some overseas conflicts . . .
not quite a war, but a "pageant".</P>
<P>Picking Albania as the hot spot to ensure Americans' knowledge will remain
minimal, Motts hires some of his best to create "genuine" news footage,
legendary heros, and even an overly patriotic theme song. The acting is sharp,
the script clever, but there is also plenty to improve on. WAG THE DOG is too
much idea and not enough story. The pacing is hectic, creating the right
atmosphere for what's going on onscreen, but as beautifully presented as it
is, it would work much better as a thirty minute short. While one can easily
walk away from this film appreciating its biting satire and powerful cast, it
doesn't stretch far beyond a really, really good idea. Speaking for myself, I
want just a bit more.</P>
<P>De Niro has received quite a bit of praise for his role here, and although he
was delightfully on key, it is Hoffman who gives the only truly stellar
performance. It's obvious this project was a bit of a trip to the candy store
for both Levinson and Hoffman. The acting adrenaline is high, and Hoffman
reflects it well. On the other hand, we also have Anne Heche as White House
aide Winifred Ames. If you believe this movie, it appears that White House
aides do nothing more than sit around looking bored out of their minds. Heche
seems to add nothing more than a tranquil backdrop to an otherwise eccentric
cast of chatter-box characters.</P>
<P>Not only the direction of the film is hectic - the camera work by Robert
Richardson is also a bit hyper, with sudden unnecessary zooms and pans that
made me dizzy. It's a bit distracting when you feel like you're watching a
political documentary shot by Mtv. Still, the intelligent comedy is a rare
thing nowadays, and this one is incredibly smart. For that aspect alone, WAG
THE DOG is one to see. With all the hoopla over Clinton going on however, it's
not much of an escape from the real world.</P>
