<P>Best known for his semi-improvised cinematic representations of
dysfunctional families and personal relationships trapped in the
oppressive web of British class society, director and screenwriter
Mike Leigh seemed like an unlikely candidate for a film based on the
career of Gilbert and Sullivan. The surprise is that he not only has
produced one of the greatest entertainment biographies of all time,
one that is faithful to the effervescent quality of Gilbert and
Sullivan's light operas, he has also managed to tell the story of the
frustration and suffering that went on behind the scenes. In doing so,
he remains faithful to the humanitarian spirit that defined his
earlier work.</P>
<P>"Topsy-Turvy" proceeds from the time in G&S's career when critics have
begun to detect a loss of creativity. Opening with the debut of
"Princess Ida", we see librettist Sir William Gilbert (Jim Broadbent)
in a rage over a review stating that the new work merely repeats
well-worn themes that have already appeared in their work over the
past 25 years. However, composer Sir Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner)
agrees completely with the negative review and announces his refusal
to collaborate with Gilbert until he has had the chance to compose a
serious opera based on a lofty theme rather than another
entertainment.</P>
<P>This coincidentally is the aspiration of film-maker John L. Sullivan
in Preston Sturges's screwball comedy "Sullivan's Travels", who is
tired of making comedies. This Sullivan wants to break free of
contractual ties to a Hollywood film studio in order to make a film
about the plight of the common man during the depths of the
depression, while the other Sullivan wants to be more like Verdi or
Wagner. (Sullivan did manage to create one serious
opera--Ivanhoe--which remains justly neglected.) D'Oyly Carte  (Ron
Cook), under whom Gilbert and Sullivan are obliged to contractually,
has the same attitude toward Arthur Sullivan that the film moguls have
in "Sullivan's Travels": why rock the boat. Not only does the tried
and true please the people, it also generates revenue. In essence,
this is the primary source of dramatic tension in "Topsy-Turvy",
namely the conflict between art and commerce.</P>
<P>Ever the hard-headed realist, Gilbert is depicted phoning the theater
box-office each morning after a performance in order to record the
receipts into a ledger book in his library. (One of the film's merits
is its attention to period detail. The phone is an unwieldy
contraption which forces people on either end to begin and end each
exchange with, "I am speaking now. Can you hear me." It has been
argued, by the way, that the period of the most rapid technological
change in human history is exactly the period depicted in
"Topsy-Turvy", when telephones, telegraphs, steamships and electrical
lights were first being introduced.)</P>
<P>This cash nexus is reflected not only between the clash between
Gilbert and Sullivan, but also in the manner in which the repertory
company in the Savoy Theater struggled for a sense of dignity and
accomplishment when management regarded them merely as wage labor.</P>
<P>In one of the most powerful scenes of the film, the principal male
actor-singers meet with impresario D'Oyly Carte for a salary review.
James Grossmith (Martin Savage) is told that he is to receive a 7.5
percent review, which is not only less than he expected, but
undermines his sense of self-worth as an artist. Anybody who has ever
been subject to a performance review in a corporation, upon which
salary increases are based, will appreciate how demeaning this
experience can be. Performing for Grossmith is as daunting a task as
it is for modern-day performers and he resorts to the same crutch
favored by many a rock star, the heroin needle. On the evening of the
first performance of "The Mikado," Grossmith is shown  in his
dressing-room plunging a needle into a scarred arm just five minutes
before the opening curtain.</P>
<P>The females also have it tough. Leonora Braham (Shirley Henderson),
the Savoy's ingénue, is not only an alcoholic, she can't seem to find
a unmarried man who will take an interest in her. As soon as she
mentions that she has a young son from a previous marriage, they shun
her. When co-star Jessie Bond (Dorothy Atkinson) suggests that she
sing at recitals in the home of London's wealthy, so as to meet
eligible bachelors, Braham complains about the class prejudices that
she finds there. Meanwhile, Bond performs on and offstage
flirtatiously night after night, despite a festering leg wound which
she gamely has fresh bandages applied to each day.</P>
<P>Despite the pain and frustrations of people from top to bottom of the
chain involved in producing these light-hearted operettas, when they
mount the stage we and the audience are left with sheer pleasure. This
is one of the great accomplishments of Leigh's film. It ranks with
Ingmar Bergman's filming of an onstage performance of Mozart's "The
Magic Flute." What gives Leigh's filming of G&S's classic ensemble
pieces even more power is its unstinting but compassionate portrayal
of the cast's vulnerabilities.</P>
