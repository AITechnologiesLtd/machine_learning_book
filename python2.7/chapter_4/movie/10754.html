<PRE>"Reefer Madness" (1936) </PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Jason Wallis </PRE>
<PRE>"Reefer Madness" zero stars 
Starring alot of bad actors 
Directed by Louis J. Gasnier </PRE>
<P>Up until a couple hours ago, I was completely convinced that Ed Wood's
"Glen or Glenda?" was the stupidest, most inane movie ever made. Well,
earlier today I decided to take a trip down to my local friendly Hollywood
Video to pick up some flicks. Looking in the cult classics section, a film
called "Reefer Madness" caught my eye. I thought it was like a Cheech and
Chong flick or something. So I read the box and discovered that it was a
short made in the 30s that was meant to warn families about the dangers of
marijuana addiction. So I figured, "What the hell? It might be good for a
laugh or two." </P>
<P>Well, a little over an hour later, I was trying to catch my breathe because
I was laughing so hard. "Reefer Madness" (originally titled "Tell Your
Children") is the single worst film ever made, but it is also one of the
most entertaining (unintentually, of course). </P>
<P>The "film", shall we call it, opens with a warning - "The film you are
about to see may disturb you." Well, it does, but not in the way that they
meant. What's disturbing about it is that someone actually thought it was
good enough to get produced. </P>
<P>The plot deals with a group of kids that hang out at the apartment of a
chick named Mae and get high together on pot. Mae's boyfriend/husband (not
sure which) is their supplier. I'm not going to bore you with anymore of
the story line. You just gotta watch it. </P>
<P>Very rarely does a film come along that I think warrents the dreaded zero
stars rating (other recipients include "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and
"New York Stories", by the way), but this movie truly deserves it. The fact
that it's funny as hell doesn't alter this because the only reason it funny
is because it's just so bad. </P>
<P>So I guess I actually recommend "Reefer Madness" for the simple fact that
it made me bust a gut watching it. Louis J. Gasnier has made a film that
joins the ranks of "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and "Santa Claus Conquers the
Martians" as great flicks to watch when you're in the mood for some really
bad camp classics. </P>
