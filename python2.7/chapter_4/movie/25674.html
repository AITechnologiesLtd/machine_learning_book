<P>   Think of "Into the Arms of Strangers" and you might
conclude that the movie is about two-income yuppie families
that feel guilty about leaving their little ones in the care of
nannies.  You can't blame these upscale folks for feeling
some compunctions about doing this, but ponder the guilt
feelings of parents who sent their seven-, eight-, ten- and
seventeen-years olds to another country, perhaps for years to
come.  What's more they knew they may never again see
their children.  Is this any way to treat your kids?  It certainly
is, if you're living in Germany years after the rise of Hitler and
his Nazi party.  </P>
<P>   When the so-called National Socialists, freaks from one of
the most advanced civilizations in modern history, were
elected--yes, elected! to office with 40 percent of the German
vote in January 1933--not a whole lot of months passed
before they began taking action on the ideologies of Hitler in
his "Mein Kampf."  In April 1933, the Nazis urged the
population to boycott Jewish-owned stores and then
successively passed decrees to deny Jews in Germany the
right to hold most occupations.  The children were forced to
attend separate schools to avoid harassment by their fellow
students.  The smart victims got out of the country when the
getting was good.  But by November 9, 1938, when in the
Kristallnacht tragedy (which involved the smashing of
windows in Jewish-owned stores) occurred, Jews were all
ready to admit that the Nazis were going to be around for
some time to come. Trouble is, the German Jews needed at
least three documents in order to leave their country, papers
which were difficult to come by, and even worse, most
countries refused to allow refugees from the German hellhole
to come in.  To the disgrace of the United States under a
president supposedly loved by Jews, FDR, the U.S. refused
to bend the anti-immigration rules to allow these Jews into
America.  </P>
<P>   One hope was left to the ill-fated people under attack in
Germany.  Children under 17 could leave the country during
the years 1938 and 1939 if they did so without their parents,
and to the glory of England, that country opened the doors to
10,000 of the youngsters.  Many British families, both
Jewish and Gentile, opened their arms to the alarmed, even
traumatized youth, and those children who could not get
adopted were housed in orphanages.</P>
<P>   "Into the Arms of Strangers" is a well-meaning
documentary about the Kindertransport--the trains and, by
extension, the policy of sending these kids out of Germany
into the arms of English strangers.  The film, which follows
the productions of several theater pieces and at least one
video entitled "My Knees Were Jumping," could serve as an
excellent primer for schoolchildren around the world,
particularly since children in school could identify with those
their own age who were victimized by psychotic adults and
saved by decent grownups from a far more civilized country. 
Narrated by Judi Dench, the story focuses on a handful of
individuals, now in their seventies and eighties, who were
members of the Kindertransport ("kind" means "children" in
German) sixty-two years ago.  As director Mark Jonathan
Harris intersperses file clips of the trains heading out of Berlin
into the harbor town of Hook of Holland where the kinder
would board ships headed across the rough waters of the
English Channel, he gives this assortment of now aging folks
the opportunity to relate their experiences to the camera.  All
are obviously grateful to their English "parents," and most
never saw their real folks again.  Their own parents had
mostly been deported in the opposite direction, to the
infamous death chambers of Auschwitz, where few people
survived.  </P>
<P>   All but one of the former victims on camera keep dry-eyed
as each tells his or her tale of woe and redemption.  None
have any particular comments about the Germans, but all
concentrate sharply on the actual months of the
Kindertransport operation and of their lives in England, where
for the most part they took on British accents and became for
all practical purposes wanted and cherished wards of the
British government.  (The House of Commons, unless the
U.S. Senate, immediately approved of the plan to take in the
10,000 children.)</P>
<P>   The most dramatic and heartbreaking story is told by one
septuagenarian who had been pulled from the train by her
parents who simply could not bear to part from their child. 
The girl spent the rest of the war in a concentration camp.  </P>
<P>   However well-meaning the film, "Into the Arms of
Strangers" suffers from being structured in the conventional
style, a form which has resulted in the public's staying away
in droves from documentaries of almost all kinds.  Harris trots
out one talking head after another, showing redundant file
films mostly of trains taking off and Nazi stationmasters
waving the pole to send the cars on their way.  While the file
films may not have been seen before by a wide public, they
are simply undramatic, showing the insipid parades that
welcomed the Germans wherever they marched, particularly
into Austria where they were welcomed with Nazi salutes,
flowers, and broad smiles by the hordes of Germanic-
speaking people in Vienna and environs.  </P>
<P>   Despite the movie's recurrences and recapitulations and
the plethora of talking heads, we do come away with a
greater political consciousness. The country which would
supposedly serve as a homeland for the tired and poor--in
this case those who would be put to death if not accepted
outside their own territory--turned its back on the desperate
children.  England, by startling contrast, not only tolerated
these kids but from a government level on down to ordinary
homes, the kinder were greeted with love and sympathy. 
Though "Into the Arms of Strangers" lacks sufficient drama
(considering the intense nature of its subject), it should be
required viewing for Pat Buchanan and isolationists of his ilk
and for those who believe that the U.S. should retreat into its
own shell.</P>
