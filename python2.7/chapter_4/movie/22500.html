film reviews every Friday morning on the 98.9 The Point morning show.---</P>
<P>Man on the Moon is a brilliant movie that tells you absolutely nothing 
about its subject. At the end of two hours you are no closer to 
understanding what made Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) so zany, innovative or 
genius. Rather, you come away with a complete comprehension and 
subsequent newly found appreciation of the man's work.</P>
<P>"Hello, I am Andy and I would like to thank you for coming to my movie. 
I wish it was better" is the opening line of Man on the Moon. Soon you 
learn that Andy (Jim Carrey) wishes it was better because, once all the 
bologna was done away with, the movie is now finished. Credits role, you 
are instructed to go home and the screen goes black. Anyone that gets 
up, demands a refund or even thinks of heading for an exit at this 
juncture becomes the punch-line of the film's first joke, one that would 
make Mr. Kaufman proud. Soon Andy is back on screen and inviting you to 
at least attempt to understand his career by watching the biography that 
follows.</P>
<P>Kaufman's roots are the same as most comedians': at home, with family 
looking on. Years later Kaufman is bombing at an improvisational comedy 
club because, despite a radically different type of audience, his act 
hasn't changed from his days as a bedroom performer. Tapping his guitar 
and making funny sounds, Andy soon gets a clear message from the 
manager: get with it or get out. Andy returns with a dead-on Elvis 
impression that is definitely with it.</P>
<P>Like many stars, Kaufman is discovered in the aforementioned humble 
night club environment. Agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito) doesn't take 
long to get his new client on Saturday Night Live and a little show 
called Taxi (for those of you still scratching your head as to exactly 
who this Kaufman guy was, he played Latka Gravas on the hit series whose 
cast returns to play themselves here, minus DeVito who is obviously 
occupied otherwise). Kaufman begins to perform in many different arenas 
with unheard of material. Whether it be wrestling women, disrupting a 
live TV show or taking the audience at Carnegie Hall out for milk and 
cookies; Kaufman ventures where few have previously gone and soars to 
the top in the process. But everything that goes up must come down.</P>
<P>Academy Award winning director Milos Forman helms this project with 
experience in both insanity and reality having also done One Flew Over 
the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus and The People Vs. Larry Flynt. Here is 
joined by screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski who penned 
The People Vs. Larry Flynt (supporting actress Courtney Love, giving a 
delicious performance in a limited role here, is also an alumni from the 
pornographer's bio-pic). There is little doubt that Forman and the 
writers will be nominated for Academy Awards.</P>
<P>The other person who will likely be in The Shrine Auditorium on Oscar 
night is Jim Carrey. Once considered a funny-faced comedian doomed to a 
career of potty-mouth fart-fests, Carrey suddenly shows up here with one 
of the greatest dramatic performances of our time. Much like Robin 
Williams, Carrey's new trend (with the primarily dramatic The Truman 
Show in the not to distant past) seems to be playing funny people in 
serious movies.</P>
<P>Andy Kaufman probably died in 1984. Some people are of the opinion that 
he is still very much alive, and Man on the Moon actually provides a 
very nice "out-clause" should that ever prove to be true. Regardless, 
Kaufman's public recognition was at an all time low on May 16, 1984 and 
has hardly risen since. This film will likely project his name into 
household status once again, perhaps permanently.</P>
<P>Although Man on the Moon may not win battles at the box office or even 
on Oscar night, although it certainly deserves to, the movie will likely 
be one of only a handful from 1999 that is still fresh in minds several 
years down the road. Andy Kaufman aimed to give his audience an 
experience they would never forget, and Carrey and Forman do just that 
in Man on the Moon.</P>
