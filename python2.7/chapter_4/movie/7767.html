<P>    A follow-up to the 1995 anthology of gay-themed short films, BOYS
LIFE 2 features four stories about ordinary guys in (mostly) ordinary
situations.  The four films are well-produced, exceptionally well-acted,
and, when seen in the context of a summer movie season, serve as a
bracing reminder of just how much raw storytelling can be accomplished
in a mere fifteen minutes of screen time.  For my money, the standouts
are Tom De Cerchio's NUNZIO'S SECOND COUSIN, about a gay cop's (Vincent
D'Onofrio, last seen in THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD) clever confrontation with
a gay basher (Miles Perlich, who looks to be Max's younger brother), and
the adorable Academy-award winning TREVOR, directed by Peggy Rajski and
starring Brett Barsky as a girlie boy suffering through his first ado-
lescent crush.  The only obvious gripe has been heard before:  the col-
lection is too short.  There's plenty of room, here, for a fifth film.  
Also featured: Nickolas Perry's MUST BE THE MUSIC and Mark Christopher's
