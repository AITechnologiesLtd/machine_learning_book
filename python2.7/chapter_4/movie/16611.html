<PRE>Wild Man Blues (1998)</PRE>
<P>Woody Allen has an interesting job: He makes movies which are, to
say the least, interesting. That does not mean that he himself is
an especially interesting person.</P>
<P>We see a lot of Woody Allen in Barbara Kopple's documentary about
Allen's European jazz tour. Mostly, we see one of three things.
There is a lot of footage of the concerts themselves; there is a
limited amount of film of the crowds and their reaction; and
there is an awful lot of Allen backstage, mostly with Soon Yi
Previn.</P>
<P>The concert footage is entertaining up to a point. New Orleans
jazz is niche music in America, but I'm willing to believe that
it's more popular in Europe, where most forms of traditional
American jazz and blues have been better received. Still, I'm not
a fan and I honestly can't say how well Allen plays (his
instrument is the relatively obscure clarinet).  He certainly
seems competent, and he should be, given the length of time he's
been playing, but I simply have no reference. I also have to
admit that by the end the film I'm fairly sick of New Orleans
music. This is my fault, but I found the music, and the concerts
rather monotonous.</P>
<P>Somewhere in the middle of the film, Wild Man Blues concentrates
on the crowds that come out to see Allen's touring unit. They
seem large and admiring. I also understand that, like New Orleans
jazz, Allen is more popular over there. That's worth knowing;
still, these scenes seemed a little too admiring, too
hagiographic, too fannish.</P>
<P>Then there is the behind the scenes stuff that occupies most of
the movie. Wild Man Blues is the diary of Woody Allen on the
road. He is in every scene, mostly with Soon Yi Previn, and he is
almost constantly talking. He's pretty much the way you would
expect him to be--smart, complaining, a little overwhelmed by
everything. The problem is that you almost expect him to launch
into shtick, and he never quite does. He's never very funny;
instead, he strikes you as stressed out.</P>
<P>The heart of the movie is Soon Yi Previn and Woody Allen, how
they get along and what they say to each other. For having such a
great difference in ages, they seem like an almost normal couple.
If anything, Ms. Previn is the solid emotional anchor of the
relationship, the one who makes sure that Allen doesn't fly
apart. She reassures him some, and spends a lot of time
explaining to him what other people think or what they feel,
which seems to mean that Allen himself doesn't have a good grasp
on the feelings of the people around him.</P>
<P>But this is about all we get to see of the two. There is
remarkably little insight about Allen or his relationship with
Ms. Previn here. We learn a few things--music is the love of his
life (which is easy for him to say because he doesn't have to
make a living doing it), he plays the music he does because
that's what he listened to when he was growing up, and he makes
the movies he make for similar reasons, because he liked foreign
films when he was a kid. Nothing remarkable, really. For the
rest, all we see is Allen talking nonstop, making trivial
observations, complaining, worrying, just going about his daily
life.</P>
<P>The problem is that the documentary style here-the informal
camerawork,  the behind-the-scenes approach, the interviews-gives
the day-to-day stuff a weight that it really doesn't deserve.
When you watch a movie like this for 103 minutes, you expect to
learn a little about the subject, and you just don't get that.
The point of this movie seems to be that you get to watch Woody
Allen for an hour and a half.</P>
<P>The questions left unexplored are surprising. There is no sense
of what the band members feel about all this. They are largely
ciphers, as is Allen's sister, Lefty Aronson, who went along on
the tour apparently as some kind of road manager. The movie never
explains just why this tour happened. Was it the money? A
celebrity vanity project? A chance for Allen to get out of the
country and play in front of adoring audiences while picking up a
couple of awards?</P>
<P>And I get no sense for why this movie was made. Let's face it; it
wasn't for the music, because nobody would make a road diary film
about a generic New Orleans band. The movie is about Woody Allen,
and yet it really doesn't have much to say about its subject,
more than just showing what Allen did for a few interesting weeks
in Europe. Wild Man Blues doesn't take a critical enough look at
Allen to yield any insights or new knowledge about the man. Given
the generally admiring tone of the project (we are reminded many
times of Allen's credentials) you wonder whether this was an
attempt to rehabilitate the man's reputation, or simply the
project of an overly enthusiastic fan.</P>
<P>The end of Wild Man Blues shows Allen with his parents, both of
whom are still alive, remarkably. There are a couple of nice bits
here--Allen's mother would have preferred that he had met a nice
Jewish girl.  He spent his adolescence living in his bedroom and
she doesn't seem to remember anything special about his musical
interests back then. She knew he was smart, but she seems
surprised by his success. Still, she doesn't seem to have a
handle on her son, either. There's really nothing here, either.
Overall, Wild Man Blues is a pleasant but ultimately unnecessary
documentary.</P>
