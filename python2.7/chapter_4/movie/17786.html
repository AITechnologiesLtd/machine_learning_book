<PRE>10 Things I Hate About You
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Love and lust, however they might be combined, are probably the most
fascinating of human endeavors. People will do the strangest things when
obsessed with either. A combination of the two emotions is almost deadly. With
the stars in the eyes, rational thought goes out the window and a beautiful
delirium takes over.</P>
<P>Lovers will reveal their innermost selves to each other and often it's a
person that the outside world never sees. The hard-edged and cruel can turn
into puppy dogs. On the other hand, the nicest person in the world might
become a maelstrom. It's a fascinating thing to watch from the outside and an
alternate dimension from the inside.</P>
<P>Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) and Heath Ledger (Patrick Verona) are seemingly a
couple made in hell. She's an hot blooded opinionated ill-tempered high school
beauty who has sworn off men. He's the local bad boy, drilling holes in text
books during shop class.</P>
<P>Kat's younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is the opposite of her sibling.
She desperately wants to be popular and has her sights set on pretty boy male
model Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan). Her problem is that her dad won't let her
date until Kat does. Kat has no intentions of hanging out with the local male riff-raff.</P>
<P>Nerdish Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is smitten with Bianca and
hatches a plot to toss Kat into the dating pool. He schemes with Joey and they
approach Heath with an offer he can't refuse. They offer him money to take out
the unapproachable Kat.</P>
<P>Loosely based on Shakespeare's "The Taming Of The Shrew", this is a notch
above current teen films. The characters are lively without being
unbelievable; humorous, but not remarkably stupid. There's a definite
chemistry between Stiles and Verona and both could become box office draws.</P>
<P>An aberration for high school films, the adults also have decent roles. Daryl
"Chill" Mitchell has a small but entertaining part as a literature teacher.
("I know Shakespeare is a dead white guy, but he knows his shit.") Larry
Miller is great as the girls' father. Unfortunately he is saddled with lame dialog.</P>
<P>There are other problems with the film. In any good story, the characters
eventually go through changes. Here they appear to transform instantaneously.
Bianca is shallow and self-centered and suddenly she's not. Heath is the
school bully but after 30 seconds with Kat, it turns out he's really an angel.</P>
<P>The biggest flaw is a plot device that must have been old even in the Bard's
time. After being paid to date Kat, Heath falls for her. It doesn't take an
olde English scholar to know that she's going to find out about the conspiracy
and break up with him.</P>
<P>This isn't a perfect film, but after the recent horrendous movies aimed at the
younger market, it's a tiny ray of hope.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for over 575 fortnights and decided
that he'd write another one even though the perfect light-hearted film remains
elusive. Email tales of love and lust to <A HREF="mailto:Redman@indepen.com.">Redman@indepen.com.</A>)</P>
