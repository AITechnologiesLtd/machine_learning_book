<PRE>_Holy_Smoke_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>  Up until a couple of days ago, the latest film from idiosyncratic New
Zealand-born director Jane Campion bore the more exclamatory moniker
_Holy_Smoke!_--an interjection that will serve as many people's immediate
reaction to the picture.  It certainly was mine--in a good way.  The
basic plot synopsis doesn't clue one in to the twisted path this unique
film takes.  A young Australian named Ruth (Kate Winslet) returns home
from a trip to India a changed woman, having fallen under the spell of a
spiritual guru.  Deeply concerned, her family enlists the services of
American P.J. Waters (Harvey Keitel), a cult deprogrammer with an
impeccable success record.  P.J.'s track record doesn't stand a chance,
however, when Ruth turns out to be as headstrong as he is.</P>
<P>Thus the stage is set for a traditional role reversal; as Ruth's
devotion to her guru fades away, P.J. finds himself falling under the
influence of a different cult--Ruth's formidable sexual allure--and he is
helpless to resist.  But this being a Campion film, the story hardly
unfolds in a traditional manner.  Walking into the auditorium, one would
not expect to see Keitel wearing a dress and full makeup for the last 20
or so minutes.  Then there are the surreal visual touches to rival the
talking lima beans in Campion's _The_Portrait_of_a_Lady_, such as the
comical parade of Ruth's past lovers, all of whom have twinkling eyes and
teeth.  It goes without saying that these flights of fancy lends the film
a bizarre fascination.</P>
<P>Which, I believe, is the point.  _Holy_Smoke_ is all about the strange
spells one inexplicably gets cast under, so it's only fitting that the
film itself craft one of its own.  But the audacity of Campion (and her
writing partner and sister, Anna) ultimately plays a smaller role in the
film's success than a more concrete quality: the performances.  It's a
testament to Keitel's work that P.J.'s emotional descent remains
believable while in drag.  More impressive, though, is Winslet, who once
again gets to bare another aspect of her being (in every sense) as Ruth. 
It's refreshing to see Winslet follow _Titanic_'s phenomenal commercial
success by returning to the edgy roles in smaller films that earned her
recognition in the first place.  As _Holy_Smoke_ displays, the work
proves more admirable and rewarding than anything in a big mainstream
Hollywood picture (such as _End_of_Days_, which she was offered and
understandably declined).</P>
