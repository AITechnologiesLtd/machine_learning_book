<P>Right before I saw "Habit" this past weekend, a friend of mine and I
were having a heated argument about whether or not any more vampire
movies needed to be made - ever.  Said friend said that he had been let
down by far too many vampire movies to care about either the concept of
vampires or any cultural product geared towards (or stemming from) their
legacy.  I, on the other hand, have admittedly seen more vampire movies
than he has, and told him that, while I definitely agree that there's a
definite quantity-to-quality discrepancy in the genre, then that's
hardly a reason to give up on them entirely.  For example, he had
written off the whole concept of sex in vampire movies, saying that it
was another genre of film entirely.  Whatever -- the concept of romance,
and physicality, and especially sex, has always been closely intertwined
with the concept of vampires, going all the way back to Bram Stoker's
original characterization of the Dracula legend.  Long regarded as a
symbol of unrequited love, it is the vampire's power to seduce its
victims that keeps their relationships on such an agonizingly surface
level.  You can't buy love; you have to earn it, along with the respect
and responsibility that goes along with it.  Draining someone's blood is
not a solution for this issue by any means.</P>
<P>This point is hammered in fairly solidly in Larry Fessenden's debut,
"Habit".  Clearly a two-man operation (Fessenden and producer Dayton
Taylor handled almost all of the direction, production and post-op
responsibilities themselves), it's as strong a debut as I think I'll see
in a while, but for some reason that's not enough.  An extremely
intriguing portrayal of ambiguity is carefully created in the first 90
minutes of the film, and in the final reel, he almost blows it with
cliches ripped out of "Fatal Attraction" and the countless
direct-to-video knockoffs that followed.</P>
<P>"Habit" centers around Sam (Fessenden, who looks like a cross between
Keith Carradine and Nick Cave), whose life has hit a pretty big wall. 
His father, a renowned historian, has recently passed on, and his
patient girlfriend Liza (Heather Woodbury) has moved out of their place,
in the hopes that Sam will take stock of his life and get a grip on his
alcoholism.  But he's a fun guy, and well-meaning, if a little unkempt
and disoriented.  All of his friends seem to recognize that he has a
problem, but never really confront him on the issue.  His moments of
true clarity shine when he's drunk, and it seems that this is the way
that he's remembered.</P>
<P>At a Halloween party hosted by his friends Nick (Aaron Beall, who should
rename himself "Mr. Drama") and Rae (Patricia Coleman), a particularly
plastered Sam is approached by a girl named Anna (Meredith Snaider). 
Her pixie-like frame, close-cropped black hair, and semi-goth Italian
model visage frame her as someone who wouldn't normally cross the street
to pee on a guy like Sam if he were on fire.  Nevertheless, they leave
the party together.  When he realizes he's taken someone else's coat,
Sam asks Anna to wait for him.  When he returns, she's gone, and later
he loses the phone number she gives to him.</P>
<P>A few days pass, and Sam can't stop thinking about Anna.  At his work
(he manages a small bar and restaurant in Greenwich Village), his friend
Lenny recounts a similar experience from the party, in which he met a
girl who lives on a boat, and they has hot sex on the poop deck all
night long.  Lenny looks a little ill, though, probably due to being
naked on a boat in a NYC autumn.</P>
<P>Anna predictably drifts back into Sam's life at a neighborhood street
fair.  Leaving his friends, he follows her to Battery Park, where they
engage in some sort of unspecified sexual activity.  Sam wakes up
outside, half-naked and with a bloody lip, and thinks nothing of it -
probably feeling like of of the luckier guys in the city.</P>
<P>Repeated visits to Sam's apartment and his work find Anna becoming an
integral part of his life.  His health is slowly deteriorating, and his
injured relationship with Liza is almost broken off completely.  All the
while, the audience is led to believe that Anna is a vampire, and that
Sam is really dumb for not realizing it earlier.  She only comes over at
night, won't eat or drink anything, won't reveal to Sam what she does
for a living.  She won't enter Sam's apartment until invited in, stands
out in the hallway when she smells garlic, and, most importantly, likes
to bite him and drink his blood, a little at a time, during sex.  Sam
just assumes it's her kink.  But there's a rational explanation to all
of her appearances and disappearances, and Snaider plays her role with
determination undercut with an honesty not often found in screen
vampires.  Her character slinks through "Habit" explicitly on her own
terms, and for the most part, avoids the cliches you might anticipate.</P>
<P>As for Sam, his blindness to the situation around him lends itself to
his internal stability, and how much of a toll life has exacted from
him.  He doesn't open up his personality but a little bit; it's
refreshing to see a character we can draw conclusions from, and feel for
without feeling sorry for.  In one of the film's stronger moments, Sam
reveals to Anna the numerous scars he's made on his arms over the years
"at parties".  Whether it was an attempt at suicide, an attempt to
impress people, or just Sam trying to set himself apart from everyone
else, he describes them to the camera with loving detail, admiring their
designs with an objectivity that belies the entire narrative style of
the film.  Fessenden obviously thought about this character for a long
time, and in writing, directing, and starring in the role, we get a
sense of completeness that might have otherwise escaped us.  With his
mussed up long hair and missing front tooth, he resembles an overgrown
child whose parents have long given up trying to raise him.  But Sam's
too old to be taken care of, and by instilling that function in Anna,
and to a more fine point, deriving it from naughty sex acts, he loses
his way even further.</P>
<P>There are no weak links in the cast; even the most flawed character,
Nick, brings his sense of overacting with a zeal that provides
much-needed comic relief.  The direction is well-crafted and paced, and
Frank DeMarco's grainy color cinematography borders on stunning.  In
particular, a scene where Anna takes Sam, who suffers from vertigo, on a
ferris wheel, is extremely memorable; using a hand-held camera mounted
on the wheel itself, the scene creates a sort of on-screen nausea that
perfectly foreshadows the instability of the events that will unfold.</P>
<P>Was it scary?  Somewhat, in the same way that "Jacob's Ladder" was
effective - in chronicling a character's descent into madness, though
the terms set in "Habit" are much more conventional, and unfortunately,
that much more obvious.  If Anna is a vampire, like we're led to
believe, what's her motivation?  Why is she so afraid to tell Sam, who's
obviously ensnared within her, anything at all?  B-movie kitsch is
something that, while noble in its own right, is more "Habit"'s copout
than anything else.  Subtlety is key here, and the film's gory ending is
a complete sledgehammer.</P>
<P>Made for a budget of under $200,000, "Habit" shows a promising new
filmmaker in Fessenden and, for the most part, a compelling narrative
restructuring of a modern vampire movie, the likes of which I haven't
seen since Kathryn Bigelow's "Near Dark".  Let's hope that he's able to
keep it up in the leg stretching period of his next few films, whatever
they may be.</P>
