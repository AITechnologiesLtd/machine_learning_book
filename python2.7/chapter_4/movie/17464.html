<P>All movies begin with a script, and all scripts begin as idle thoughts
in the minds of writers. Most scripts, that is, because there are those
which aren't written directly from the screen and instead adapted from
novels, plays, short stories, articles, and compendia of all kind. The
latest is THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN, an adaptation of Jacquelyn
Mitchard's novel by TRUE CRIME writer Stephen Schiff. While this Ulu
Grosbard film features some powerfully thematic content regarding the
strength of family ties, however, audiences and industry experts will
file this one away as evidence of the inferior nature of adapted movies. </P>
<P>DEEP END tells the story of the Beth (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Pat (Treat
Williams) Cappadora. The Cappadoras are loving folks who show their
affection for each other by appending "-y" to one another's names, and
we like them instantly. Turns out they're raising three children in
Madison, Wisconsin, during the late 1980's -- three, that is, until
their youngest goes missing in a crowded Chicago hotel lobby at Beth's
high school reunion. Nearly a decade later, the Cappadoras have pieced
their life back together and are living well in a suburb of Chicago when
Beth spots a kid on their block whom she supposes to be their lost boy.
Under a different name, now, it's with the help of Detective Supervisor
Candy Bliss (Whoopi Goldberg) that they establish his identity and go
through the process of reintroducing him to the family. </P>
<P>Unfortunately all of this comes off as a very lightweight drama for many
of the same reasons that caused the demise of last year's STEPMOM.
Adapted from a novel, the screenplay is by nature very brief, and, like
STEPMOM it cuts from scene to scene without building any true depth. The
characters are real enough, and acted well by the principals, but most
importantly they are simply cardboard cutouts which can be easily
dropped into any scene. Also, like STEPMOM, what should be a significant
and weighty event in a family's life is left largely unresolved or
treated with little respect. The return of the lost child (Ryan
Merriman) is not the focus of the movie; instead, the film's center of
interest is the shallow relationship between Beth and Pat. </P>
<P>On the positive side, the movie has a very good nature to it, and if not
for the significant tragedy involved it could almost be called a
feel-good movie. This uplifiting nature is something that was missing
from both STEPMOM as well as Pfeiffer's last live-action role in the
tragic drama A THOUSAND ACRES. Here, the theme of the strength of family
is decidedly the director's favorite, and we feel its winning qualities
in the end. Although all loose ends are not tied in the movie's running
time, they are implicitly resolved, and for this the audience is
grateful. The performances of all involved are vital to this success,
and for this Pfeiffer, Williams, Goldberg, Merriman, and Jonathan
Jackson (in the role of the Cappadoras' elder son) are to be commended.
On the whole, however, there's too many small mistakes or an overbearing
theme that's not present to call this movie a wholly fulfilling watch. </P>
