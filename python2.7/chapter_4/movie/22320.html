<P>In any given year, director Oliver Stone will attempt to focus his manic
tendencies into a version of reality seen through the eyes of a man who's
been through wars, Wall Street, the White House, Jim Morrison's dirty
laundry and a long, summer heat with Sean Penn and Jennifer Lopez. Now
whether you dig the man's style, personality, odor or not (I do), there is
one thing that we can all agree on: there is no one like Olly Stone! Cheers
daddy-o and smoke 'em if you got 'em!</P>
<P>PLOT:
An old-school football coach is faced with the possibility of ending the
season without his number one veteran quarterback. Luckily for him, a
younger, cockier QB is ready to take his spot in the limelight, but as per
his ego, the strappin' lad cares little about the sport, his teammates or
anyone else for that matter. And as the playoffs approach and the team's
headstrong owner looms overhead, the coach must figure out how his team is
going to overcome the odds to win the big game, win each others respect and
ultimately win as men.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Football fans rejoice, this film is tailor-made for you. Everyone else,
uhhmm....well, close your ears and get ready for an overlong, over-stylized
humpty-dumpty ride of loud banging music, loud crashing football players and
a loud, but surprisingly predictable, script. Stars galore, many wasted,
this film offers more names than any recent Woody Allen flick. Check Pacino,
as the old school coach, tough, rugged, chips on his shoulder but still
ballsy enough to get shit done. Good job. Check Diaz, going against type as
a strong-willed woman fighting to make her voice heard in a sport run wildly
by men with giant egos and wallets. Solid effort. You can even check Jamie
Foxx, last minute replacement for Puff Daddy, as the cocky, new kid on the
block, looking fine, feeling fine and acting, well, pretty damn fine. The
rest, uuuhhm, James Woods, pretty one-dimensional, Lauren Holly, even more
one-dimensional, Elizabeth Berkley, looking the mess, LL Cool J, underused,
and Matthew Modine, wow, what an insignificant career move, my friend.</P>
<P>The story, you ask? Well, the story is so-so interesting with much of it
predictable to anyone who has seen any other Hollywood sports movie done in
the past 50 years or so. Does Stone bring an extra stick of hot-peppered
pinnace to the proceedings? Sure, but unfortunately it materializes itself
mostly in many ridiculously overdone "symbolic" camera shots inter-spliced
between characters speaking to one another (Can anyone please explain the
whole Ben-Hur thing to me? Deeeeeep?), and some really cool scenes featuring
bang-up football at its best, but very little "insight" into the game
itself. I mean, by now anyone with a remote control knows that YES, some
sports doctors do allow their players to go on playing injured, YES, most
modern sports athletes think a lot more about the money than they do the
game itself, and YES, owners are generally cold-hearted pricks with very
little more on their mind than the bottom line. Nothing new here, folks.
Unless of course these accepted stereotypes were new to you, than oops, I
guess you might find something a little fresh in this story.</P>
<P>So why do I still rate this film as a "good movie"? It's simple really. It's
one great big kickass rock n' roll rappin' ride through the wonderful world
of professional football, including its rough and tumble menageries on the
green, its extra-curricular partying with the booze and the drugs and the
whores, and its ultimate high of winning the big game, teammates strapped by
your side. Basically, it's your ultimate testosterone rush, and unless you
spend your Sunday afternoons meditating over the "golf" channels, or you get
bored seeing football scene after football scene being followed by a party
scene and a "time to move the plot forward dialogue scene", this film should
blow your eardrums and eye-sockets right out of your ass! Wham-bam, thank
you man! (Bring your own condoms)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
On March 8, 1999, The New York Daily News reported that actor Jamie Foxx had
filed assault charges against rapper-actor LL Cool J after the two had a
dust-up on the set of this movie. Foxx apparently claimed that LL socked him
in the face while they were filming a scene for the movie.
Plenty of real football folks pepper this film's cast, most notably an
impressive turn by LT (Lawrence Taylor) as Shark, Jim Brown as defensive
coordinator of the Sharks, Warren Moon, Ricky Watters, as well as Dick
Butkus and Johnny Unitas featured as opposing coaches. Ex-Dallas Cowboys
coach Barry Switzer also takes a turn as a sports announcer, alongside the
writer/director of this film himself, Oliver Stone (who can be seen taking a
sip o' booze from his post high atop the proceedings early on in the film).
Sean "Puffy" Combs' official statement regarding his dropping out of this
movie from the role of Willie Beaman was that "Following numerous scheduling
changes that created conflicts with my other professional commitments, it is
clear that this is not a film in which I will be involved."
Veterans to Oliver Stone films include the always-funny John C. McGinley,
who makes his sixth appearance in a Stone pic with this one, and James
Woods, who shows up for number five.
This film is based partly on the novel written by Rob Huizenga entitled
"You're okay, it's just a bruise: A doctor's sideline secrets about pro
football's most outrageous team".
Male frontal nudity is also featured in this film, but none of the stars,
including Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid, Jamie Foxx or LL Cool J take part. Of
course, we all know that LL Cool J. stands for "Ladies Love Cool James".
Pretty corny, but hey, the man made it stick, so leave him alone! James
Smith is his real name.
Why no mention of the NFL you may ask? Considering the unyielding, honest,
and free depiction of professional football that Stone wanted to portray in
this film, he also wanted to splash an element of fiction in its physical
backdrops. Ultimately, the filmmakers and the National Football League
agreed to disagree, without interference from one party to the other, and
thus, the AFFA (Association of Football Franchises of America) was born, the
professional football league to which the Miami Sharks and all other teams
depicted in ANY GIVEN SUNDAY belong. In fact, the Shark Stadium, where the
fictitious Miami Sharks play football in this film, is actually the Orange
Bowl Stadium, in Miami, Florida.</P>
