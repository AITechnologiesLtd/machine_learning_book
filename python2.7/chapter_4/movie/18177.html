<P>Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review:</P>
<PRE>THE MUMMY</PRE>
<P>Brendan Fraser's stuck in the past again, but at least this time he has
something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo Alicia
Silverstone...</P>
<P>Fraser is the lead star of The Mummy, the second directorial effort from
action director Stephen Sommers (who also brought us the decent thrill
ride that was Deep Rising).  It's a rough adaptation of the 1932 film,
and I say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some
guy in bandages, like Boris Karloff was engulfed in.</P>
<P>But who cares, the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you
can't get from, oh, say, Godzilla or Armageddon.  Fraser plays a soldier
who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an Egyptian
ground.  Basically, it's a little sign from the mummy buried underneath-
a priest named Ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of
murdering the King and making out with his mistress.  His plan- wake
back up and wake her up also, making him invincible.</P>
<P>Of course, Fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian
(Rachel Weisz) and her brother (John Hanna), along with a former buddy
of his (Deep Rising's Kevin J. O'Connor) and some "Americans"...and
guess what?  Yup, Ihmoetep (Arnold Vosloo) awakens and wreaks havoc.
Fire flies from the sky, flesh-eating beetles crawl about, and, well,
Ihmoetep's plan begins to unfold.</P>
<P>OK, so it's not really all that new a story, but the way Sommers tells
it is entertaining enough.  The special effects from Industrial Light
and Magic are top notch, and the acting from Fraser and Weisz isn't half
bad either.  The action is pretty intense (favorite scene: the
sandstorm) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you
horror-loving folks as well.</P>
<P>No, it's no Phantom Menace beater, but if you're looking for a solid
warm-up to the summer movie season, you won't find a better film under
wraps than The Mummy.  If this doesn't give Fraser forgiveness from
Blast From the Past and Encino Man, then nothing will.</P>
