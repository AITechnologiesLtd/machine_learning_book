<P>"Three to Tango" stars Matthew Perry (TV's "Friends"), Neve Campbell (TV's 
"Party of Five"), and Dylan McDermott (TV's "The Practice"). I do not mention 
the fact that they are all currently starring on television series' to demean 
or criticize their acting abilities, but I mention it because their casting 
seems rather appropriate. There's no way "big" movie stars would have agreed 
to make "Three to Tango" because it is inauspiciously written by Rodney 
Vaccaro and Aline Brosh McKenna on a strictly television sitcom level, and 
rarely ever feels like a feature film. </P>
<P>Tellingly, the movie is stretched so thinly and told in such a 
paint-by-numbers way that there is very little interest that evolves within 
the story, and the only relationship that is able to develop satisfactorily 
is that between Oscar Novack (Matthew Perry), a Chicago architect, and Amy 
Post (Neve Campbell), a prospering artist. They come together and become 
close friends after Oscar, believed to be gay after a misunderstanding 
involving his gay partner, Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt), is hired by 
multimillionaire business magnate Charles Newman (Dylan McDermott) to keep an 
eye on his beautiful mistress, who happens to be Amy. Hitting it off at one 
of her gallery openings, followed by an adventurous evening in which their 
cab literally blows up and they get sick and throw up from eating tuna melts 
at a low-rent dive, Oscar instantly has fallen in love, and Amy likewise has 
feelings for him. Unfortunately, once the false news spreads around the area 
that Oscar is gay after his picture is plastered on the front page of the 
newspaper, he finds himself having to play up the rumor so he doesn't 
jeopardize his job or Amy's friendship.</P>
<P>Amidst a handful of charming little scenes and an absolutely winning 
performance from Neve Campbell that proves she's more than just a television 
actress, "Three to Tango" is a terminally empty-headed romantic comedy, and 
most of the blame should not be put on the actors (aside from Dylan 
McDermott, who is thoroughly unappealing), but on the dumb screenplay and 
flat direction, by Damon Santostefano (whose only previous film credit is 
1992's "Severed Ties"). Clocking in at just over 90 minutes, the film's 
aspirations are disjointed and very little of the mistaken identity plotline 
is successful. Moreover, its treatment of gays is, at times, surprisingly 
thoughtful, as with the subplot involving Amy's ex-boyfriend (Cylk Cozart) 
who has just recently come out, and other times it is simply offensive. The 
reaction of Oscar's father when he finds out he's "gay" is certainly the 
film's major low point.</P>
<P>Matthew Perry is perfectly fine in his good-guy role as Oscar, but he is 
pretty much playing his character of Chandler on "Friends." However, Neve 
Campbell abandons her sullen, problems-ridden Julia Salinger character from 
"Party of Five," and makes Amy a fun-loving, intelligent gal--the exact type 
you'd like to root for in a film of this genre. Campbell lights up the 
screen, and almost single-handedly steals the picture from everything and 
everyone else involved.</P>
<P>By the time the heartfelt climax and hugely predictable conclusion occur, 
you're left with a malnourished appetite, as you've been 
waiting--praying--for something of note to happen when nothing ever does. 
Oscar, being presented the award as Gay Man of the Year (is there seriously 
such a thing?), "comes out" to everyone, in reverse, letting the guests know 
that he isn't actually gay. Standing up for what he believes in and 
professing his deep love and admiration for Amy, his speech (the type that 
only occur in movies) sends off a warm applause from the audience before him. 
Why is this annoying cliche used in so many films, since it so obviously 
doesn't resemble reality or human nature at all? Accordingly, there are no 
twists, no unforeseen developments, and the ending does not make the most of 
its romantic intentions, even if we like Amy and Oscar, which I did.   </P>
<P>For no known reason, more of the running time is padded out by the opening 
and ending credits, which feature people dancing to swing music. How exactly 
does swing music factor in to anything else in the film, anyway? I'd almost 
bet money that no one involved could give me a plausible answer. When all is 
said and done, "Three to Tango" is like a loaf of stale bread. From afar, it 
may look fresh and mildly engaging, but get closer, and its appeal sours.</P>
