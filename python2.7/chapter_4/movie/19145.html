<P>The centerpiece of "Wild Wild West" is a huge mechanical spider. In one 
scene, the metallic arachnid looms over a small Utah town, then lumbers 
forward in an ungainly, but impressive fashion, destroying everything in 
its path. The film is a lot like that giant spider. It looks great, but 
moves awkwardly and, whenever matters are in doubt, just blows stuff up. </P>
<P>Based on the quirky sci-fi/western TV series from the '60s and directed 
by Barry Sonnenfeld ("Men in Black"), the credits for "Wild Wild West" 
indicate that it was written by (get this) S.S. Wilson & Brent Maddock 
and Jeffrey Price & Peter S. Seaman, from a story by Jim Thomas & John 
Thomas. Whew! Is there anything better than a film created by committee? 
The disjointed production plays as if Sonnenfeld threw several drafts of 
the script into the air, snagged pages at random as they fluttered down 
and started filming when he had a handful. Had the filmmakers spent a 
tenth as much time honing the script as they did on the nifty art 
direction, "Wild Wild West" would have been something more than drivel 
with a colorful candy coating. </P>
<P>Set in the post-Civil War era, the film opens badly with a cumbersome 
sequence set at a West Virginian bordello, then moves to the White House, 
where President Ulysses S. Grant teams up a pair of quarreling special 
agents; brawler and all-around stud James T. West (Will Smith) and Felix 
Unger-ish inventor/master of disguise Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline). 
Together, they set off to battle the evil Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), 
a megalomaniac who, after losing the lower portion of his body in the war,
 kidnapped a group of scientists to create a super-weapon that would 
force Grant to surrender the newly re-United States. Oh, and lovely Rita 
Escobar (Salma Hayek) hooks up with the guys, hoping to rescue her father 
from the clutches of Loveless. </P>
<P>The pluses of "Wild Wild West" are mostly visual. Gordon and West travel 
in a plush private train filled with Gordon's fanciful inventions. There 
are a number of striking sets, particularly Loveless' arachnid-themed 
mansion, which includes henchmen hidden within "living" paintings. The 
dapper Jim West and voluptuous Rita are easy on the eyes, and that giant 
mechanical spider is a knockout. </P>
<P>The minuses are the lurching, unfocused storyline and hack script, which 
forces a lot of talented actors to recite some truly lame sentences. For 
every good one-liner, there are five duds and even the charismatic Will 
Smith can't salvage lines like "That's it. No more Mister Knife Guy!" </P>
<P>"Wild Wild West" is designed as lightweight summer fun and its 
combination of attractive actors and retro-cool gadgets may be enough for 
some. But with Barry Sonnenfeld's track record and a cast this talented, 
we have a right to expect more than flashy effects, a few good moments 
and a lot of half-ass shtick. </P>
