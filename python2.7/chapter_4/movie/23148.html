<P>DIAMONDS
A film review by Athan Bezaitis.  Copyright filmcritic.com 2000</P>
<P>Kirk Douglas is a real trooper.  He still looks darn good for eighty,
and his resilience after suffering a debilitating stroke in 1996 is
quite admirable.  Unfortunately, he's the only thing really worth
cheering about in DIAMONDS.  In his first big-time Hollywood production,
director John Asher has three major stars with Dan Aykroyd, Douglas, and
the beautiful Lauren Bacall, but the newcomer fails to add anything
truly novel to the hackneyed formula of an implausible treasure hunt
that brings together an estranged family.</P>
<P>The story follows the life of Harry Agensky (Kirk Douglas), a former
welterweight champion who is devastated by the one-two punch of the loss
of his beloved wife and the after-effects of a stroke.  Once known as
the "Polish Prince," Harry is now faced with spending the rest of his
life in a retirement home.  But there is hope as, supposedly, fifty
years ago he made a deal with a Reno mobster to throw a fight so that he
could retrieve hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of diamonds... but
he can't remember where they are hidden.  Nobody will help Harry, and
his visiting son Lance (Aykroyd) doesn't buy his father's fable about
the fight and the diamonds, either.  Lance is his dad's opposite, a
super-sensitive San Jose Mercury News sports writer still trying to win
over his old man.  Ironically, Lance seems to have the same problems
with his own son Michael (Corbin Allred - ANYWHERE BUT HERE).  When the
three decide to go for broke and head to Reno, they clash hard and seem
to fail every step of the way.  However, what they lose in wealth they
gain in insight, and finally discover they can't live apart.</P>
<P>The story, despite being sappy and clichéd, is somewhat fun, and the
physical antics of Douglas, of all people, steal the show.  He's
surprisingly nimble and quick-witted, and he proves that the "Polish
Prince," after all those years, can still kick some butt.
Unfortunately, Aykroyd, who I was hoping would show stuff from the
hilarious days of THE BLUES BROTHERS and TRADING PLACES, was somewhat
limited in his role.  So much was made of him as a big wimp, constantly
sucking up to his father, that he didn't have the freedom to get really
wacky.  On the other hand, Lauren Bacall, playing a Reno madam, is
excellent as the love interest of Harry.  The two have great chemistry
and their tryst is strangely romantic and satisfying.</P>
<P>This one gets three stars simply because Kirk Douglas carries it on his
still powerful shoulders.  While it's not quite as good as GRUMPY OLD
MEN, it's light years ahead of THE ODD COUPLE II.</P>
