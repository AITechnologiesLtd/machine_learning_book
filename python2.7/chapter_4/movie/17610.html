THE TIME TO LIVE AND THE TIME TO DIE (director: Hou Hsiao hsien; cast:
You Anshun (Ah-ha), Tien Feng, Mei Fang,  Shufen Xin, Ann-Shuin Yiu,
Tang Ruyun, Xiao Ai, Yu-Yuen Tang (Grandmother),1985-Tai.)</P>
<P>An autobiographical film of Hou Hsiao hsien, grounded in the history of
Taiwan from 1947 through the 1950s and the early 1960s. This was a very
demanding and taxing film for me to follow, not because of its slow pace
and lack of action scenes, but because I didn't have a full knowledge of
what Taiwan was historically undergoing during that time frame,
therefore the many innuendoes and references to past events, didn't
always connect with me, as well as it should have. I could only watch
the film from the point of view of what I got from the film itself. And,
that is, the story of a family, trying to cope with their own secrets
and their own idiosyncrasies, that proves to be a very human tale,
something along the lines of an Ozu film.</P>
<P>The family leaves the mainland of China in 1947 and settles in Taiwan,
where the father, who remains aloof from running the family business,
leaving all that to his wife; as he concentrates on his job in a school.
He gives his wife most of the salary and she uses it to take care of
their big family, which includes the elderly grandmother. Ah-ha is the
child who seems to miss having a father around the most. He is seen as
being rebellious as a child, often disciplined by his mother. But he is
also shown acting like a typical child playing games and running around
with the other children, enjoying a rich childhood, growing up with many
pleasant memories. He is deeply loved by his grandmother, who tells him
stories about the mainland and their ancestors, telling him her wish to
return there, something he doesn't follow, especially since he feels
perfectly at home in Taiwan.</P>
<P>When he becomes a teenager, he hangs around with a street gang. As a
result he does not distinguish himself in school, until he realizes that
he will have to pass the exams and choose a career, or else he will have
a tough time surviving in Taiwan. He is also attracted to a girl who
wants him to go to the university, which stimulates him further to pass
the exams. His older sister is the more dominant one in the family, but
we see him growing more and more loyal to the family, especially when
his father dies, and then, when his mother dies, he is deeply shaken,
showing the great love he had for her. The film is shot through the
point of view of Ah-ha.</P>
<P>What is beautiful about the film is its lushness, the sunny colors it
evokes, giving it a strange sense of touching down on a paradise, and
the small matters that are very human that it pays very close attention
to, like the softness of the rain falling, his father sitting so nobly
by his desk, grandmother acting so eccentric and being loved by the
family for what she is. When Ah-ha reads the letters of his mother and
realizes that the father remained distant from the family because he had
tuberculosis and was constantly sick, not wanting to contaminate the
rest of the family, a condition that he didn't tell his wife about
before they were married, much to her displeasure, causing her to
remark, later on, to the family, that health might be the only thing
that is real, he begins to understand his father and the family he was
brought up in, perhaps for the first time in his life. It is amusing to
hear in the letters that he reads after his parents are dead, how his
father made the family buy bamboo furniture because he always thought
the move away from the mainland was a temporary one, and that someday
they would go home again and it would be no problem discarding the cheap
furniture.</P>
<P>This is a very subtle and wonderfully crafted film that depicts
childhood in a very simple but relevant manner, that only a very few
filmmakers have been able to do in such a sentimental but unsentimental
way. This is a work of considerable merit.</P>
