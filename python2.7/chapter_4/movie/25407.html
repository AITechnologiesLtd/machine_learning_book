<PRE>A Video Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>What happens when you get angry? Many people suppress their anger, and hold 
all of their feelings inside until everything eventually comes bursting out. 
Others let their wrath run wild, not really caring what damage is done as 
long as they feel better. Me, Myself & Irene, starring Jim Carrey, recently 
examined this idea. However, that was a comedy. The Butcher Boy is a drama. 
Little Francie Brady (Eamonn Owens) is an uncontrollable brat. His father 
(Stephen Rea) is a drunk who has a less than friendly relationship with his 
mother (Aisling Oâ^À^ÙSullivan). The two are always fighting in front of their 
child and the mother tries to hang herself within the first ten minutes of 
the movie. Francieâ^À^Ùs only friend is Joe (Alan Boyle). Joe treats Francie 
well, and fulfills his needs for companionship. Through a series of events 
(mostly involving another child named Phillip that Francie picks on) Joe 
begins to realize Francie is a rude and cruel person. He tries to distance 
himself from Francie as much as he can, and starts hanging out with Phillip. 
Wanting Joe as his own, Francie seeks revenge. He does horrible things to 
Phillip and his home. In his attempt to win Joeâ^À^Ùs friendship, Francie will go 
to extreme measures. How extreme he gets may shock you.</P>
<P>The reason this film requires such a long plot summary is because this is a 
very complicated movie. The film looks at anger and how itâ^À^Ùs handled by 
several people with insight. Ultimately, it reaches the idea that most anger 
stems out of confusion. Confusion plagues Francie Brady. The movie seems like 
it's told in first person, but is really told in third.  Some imaginative 
dream sequences only add to the puzzlement. In one scene, Francie and Joe are 
the last remaining humans after an apocalypse. In a strange attempt to link 
Communism and the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis with confusion, everyone 
in town turns into a pig. The remaining creatures all turn into aliens that 
look like something from an Ed Wood movie. Even stranger is the Virgin Mary. 
She appears to Francie and offers him advice. She also frequently uses the 
f-word. </P>
<P>Director Neil Jordan did an exhaustive search of the world for someone to 
play Francie, and he found the perfect person. Eamonn Owens is brilliant in 
his first role. He never seems to worry whether youâ^À^Ùll like his character or 
not, and he meets everything with an extensive set of emotions and often 
understanding. Alan Boyle is good too. They both capture the sense of freedom 
and change many people experience in their youth. Their performances help a 
movie where the adult acting is lackluster.</P>
<P>When Francie commits his disturbing final act, I could feel what was going 
through his mind. The Butcher Boy is a dark drama that brings its viewer 
deeper into childhood insanity than many will ever want to be. </P>
