<PRE>Bordello of Blood
*** of **** grade of B-</PRE>
<P>You don't see a movie about vampire hookers to view a masterful plot or
incrible characters, you see it for blood, laughs and T&A.  You get
plenty of those three in this film with plot on autodrive as Dennis
Miller offers up funny one-liners and cynical observations.  This movie
works very well until the third act which is a complete disappointment.</P>
<P>Super vampire opens a bordello, with vampires in place of the
prostitutes, and they kill the men and drink there blood.  There is
nothing new here but Dennis Miller shows up as a private eye to
investigate the disapperance of a loser who frequented the bordello, on
only one occasion.  Miller is sharp in this film, walking off with the
movie and shaping the T&A and blood around his very funny comedy act.  </P>
<P>I have meantioned Miller alot and neglected most of the other film,
including a plot element with a priest.  Who cares abut that? You go to
see this movie for a good time and it delivers.  Seeing this film is the
same reason that folks see midnight showings of The Rocky Horror Picture
Show.  You see enough to enjoy the film and walk out feeling somewhat
empty, but if you're a Miller fan your belly might be sore.</P>
