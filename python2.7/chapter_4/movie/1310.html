                           MY MOTHER'S CASTLE
                      A film review by Ken Johnson
                       Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>90 min., PG, Drama, 1990, In French with English subtitles
Director: Yves Robert
Cast: Sorry, missed them</PRE>
<P>     A young French boy is in love with the hills of France.  He would
like to spend all his time in his family's second house in the hills,
but because of schooling and his father's job he is unable to spend much
time there.  He tries, whenever possible, to go up to the hills so he
can have fun.</P>
<P>     I found MY MOTHER'S CASTLE to be a very interesting and beautiful
film to watch.  What makes this film so interesting is not so much the
plot, as it is in the scenery.  I highly recommend that if this film
comes to a theater near you, you go see it.  It will be well worth the
trip.  I rate MY MOTHER'S CASTLE a four on a scale of zero to five.  MY
MOTHER'S CASTLE is rated PG and I couldn't find anything that anyone
might find objectionable.</P>
<P>     MY MOTHER'S CASTLE is the sequel to Yves Robert's earlier film MY
FATHER'S GLORY, which unfortunately I have not yet been able to see.  MY
MOTHER'S CASTLE, and MY FATHER'S GLORY, are based on the writings of
Marcel Pagnol.  From the way this film ends I think that it will be the
last in the series.  The title of the film makes little sense until just
before the end when it gets explained to you.</P>
<P>     The best part, I feel, were the locations used for the filming.  I
assume that the locations are in France, but at any rate they are
perfect.  The film would not be near as good as it is if the locations
weren't as well picked.  The opening credits are shown while a camera
pans around a beautiful mountain.  The acting was really well done, by
all the people in the film.  The actors really convince you that they
are the person in the film.  I started to actually feel for the people
in the film.</P>
<P>     I almost didn't go to see this film when it was playing in my town,
because I thought that it was going to be boring.  I haven't had a good
record with imported films.  I have seen a dreadful French film called
CHOCOLAT, a boring Danish film called PELLE THE CONQUEROR, a semi-poor
French film called BAXTER, and a reasonably good Italian film called THE
STORY OF BOYS AND GIRLS.  But I am really glad that I went and saw MY
MOTHER'S CASTLE.  I just can't put into words the way that I felt about
it.  I am going to try to see if I can get my local art/import theater
to get MY FATHER'S GLORY to see if it is just as good.</P>
