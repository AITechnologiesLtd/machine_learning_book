<P>When I first heard about THE POSTMAN, the whole idea seemed very laughable to
me. It's the future, the world has become a wasteland, and somehow, somewhere,
a postman appears and becomes the icon of hope. A postman? A *postman*?!?! I
thought to myself, "this must've been written by some underappreciated mailman
in Nebraska or something". As it surprisingly turned out, THE POSTMAN had more
to offer than I ever thought it would.</P>
<P>The plot *is* similar to what I said, but I'll rephrase for the sake of
decency. It *is* the future (the year 2013 to be exact), and due to three-year
winters, bizarre weather, war, riots, etc., the world population has seriously
dwindled, the American government no longer exists, and the earth resembes the
middle ages with machine guns. A nameless wanderer (Kevin Costner) traveling
in search of food and water, finds a small village in the middle of nowehere,
and decides it is the opportunity to charm his way to nourishment. Performing
his own unique brand of one-man (and a horse) Shakespeare, he obtains the pity
and food he needs.</P>
<P>Peachy keen? Not quite. General Bethlehem (Will Patton) is the leader of a
KKK-influenced army that pillages and plunders small towns like the pirates of
old. Yes, he even sports a nice beard. When his army arrives in the same small
town, he wants more than supplies and food. He demands that all "eligible"
males between the ages of 15 and 30 come forward. The plan is to turn each and
every "eligible" man into a fighting machine for Bethlehem's brigade. To be
considered "eligible", you can't just be fit, you can't have any black in you.</P>
<P>While our wanderer attempts to sneak away, he is spotted and forced to join
the clan. Along with a few townsmen, he is taken to Bethlehem's training camp
of sorts, where Bethlehem picks on him right away. After a battle of wits,
Bethlehem derogatorily nicknames the wanderer "Shakespeare", and "Shakespeare"
quickly becomes the "runt" of the group - he's the least avid to comply, the
least to condone violence, and the one Bethlehem wants to see run into the
ground. Naturally the movie wouldn't get too exciting if "Shakespeare" didn't
escape, and so he finally does.</P>
<P>"Shakespeare" travels alone thru the bitter cold and finally takes up shelter
in an old mail truck. Inside, he finds the skeletal remains of a postman, and
quickly strips off the clothes to keep himself warm. He finds a lighter and
starts his own makeshift fire out of old, undelivered letters. Curiousity gets
to "Shakespeare", and soon he finds himself reading some of these old letters.
An idea!</P>
<P>The next we see of "Shakespeare", he is entering another town, fully dressed
as a postman and carrying a bag of letters over his shoulder. Once again, in
an effort to obtain food and nothing more, he approaches the small city. With
an outrageous tale of a "restored congress", "Shakespeare" claims to be a
postman, just like before the world went to hell. Everybody rejoices at the
news that back east the government is being renewed. The fable works, and
quickly "the postman" finds himself being fed and bathed by the rejuvinated
town. But questions start to arise, and "the postman" finds himself deeper in
his own fabrication than he ever thought he'd be. "Is there a president?" one
townsperson asks. Hesitantly, the postman replies, "Um, yes . . . Richard
Starkey".</P>
<P>In this town, we meet a couple of central characters. One is the young black
man determined to make something of himself. Going by the name Ford Lincoln
Mercury (Larenz Tate), he is so determined to become a postman himself that
Costner's character eventually swears him with pseudo-authority. We also meet
Abby (Olivia Williams), a young wife whose husband can't conceive. She
approaches "the postman" in the hopes that he will impregnate her so she and
her husband can have a child. Will he do it?</P>
<P>It doesn't take long before Bethlehem hears of this allegiant revival. He
quickly considers "the postman"  a threat to his dictatorship. What beings is
a hunt down for "the postman", and a war between Bethlehem's army and those
who wish to believe in a restored United States. I was reminded of a mixture
between BRAVEHEART and WATERWORLD. In fact, one of Bethlehem's comments refers
to an issue that was a major factor in BRAVEHEART.</P>
<P>What THE POSTMAN is really about, is patriotism. We watch as young hope-filled
eyes suddenly take on an aspiring radiance. It's corny as hell if you really
look at it, but THE POSTMAN carries enough charm to likely win over a large
sentimental audience. It's also surprisingly funny, and Costner's character
was my favorite of all his characters I've seen. Patton was very cliched, and
a lot of the film was very melodramatic, especially when you realize that
you're supposed to be breaking down into tears over a postman. It's sappy and
far-fetched, but it's also enamoring.</P>
<P>Kevin Costner seems stuck on making long, wannabe-epic films. THE POSTMAN is
no exception. Nearly stretching to three hours, this film has a massive dose
of overkill. Trim it by as little as thirty minutes, and you could've had a
cute, albeit saccharine film. But the dopey premise is forgivable thanks to
the load of sweetness. Let's just be grateful we didn't wind up with THE
U.P.S. GUY instead.</P>
