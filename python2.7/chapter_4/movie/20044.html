<P>If you've been pining to see William H. Macy removed from his element,
then "Mystery Men" is going to be your kind of movie. The "Fargo"
Oscar-nominee and critically-acclaimed character actor here plays a
blue-collar (and blue-jeans) crime-fighter known as The Shoveler, and
seeing him dispatch disco-vamping enemies with a swift whack of his
namesake weapon provides many a pinch-me-so-I-know-I'm-not-dreaming
moment. Be thankful you're wide awake: Chief among the perverse
pleasures of "Mystery" is witnessing him and more unexpected talents
deadpan their way through a story that's all punchlines and sensory
explosion.</P>
<P>A single member of a trio of hero-wannabes in the Gotham-like metropolis
Champion City, Shoveler's team also includes Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller,
radiating manic cool in stubble, spiky hair and black leather), prone to
attention-getting tantrums, and The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), a
fork-flinger sporting an effete British accent and a wardrobe that looks
stitched together from an elderly lady's housecoat. (It probably was.)
They genuinely want to help rid their hometown of bad guys, yet always
seem to fall into the shadow of the amazing Captain Amazing (Greg
Kinnear, perfectly utilized), Champion City's bonafide defender against
evil.</P>
<P>With this set-up, "Mystery Men" sounds like any number of comics brought
to large, lush life on the big screen - and, as every colorfully askew
frame makes evident, it's source is just that (specifically, a Dark
Horse publication called "Flaming Carrot"). But that the protagonists
are second-rate saviors hints at vast opportunities for a wicked sense
of humor, an edge that the performers, screenwriter Neil Cuthbert and
debut director Kinka Usher take to the hilt. And what a hilt: A
particularly amusing running gag involves Kinnear's promotional
sponsorship, his NASCAR-esque jumpsuit displaying logos for Reebok,
Rayovac and Pepsi.</P>
<P>Actually, Captain Amazing loses the latter endorsement after one too
many ho-hum rescues. This puts him in a glum mood, so he demands that
his publicist work to free old arch-nemesis Casanova Frankenstein (hammy
Geoffrey Rush) from the local asylum to spark some deadly new conflict -
only the plan backfires when he gets kidnaped by Casanova, allowing
Shoveler, Mr. Furious and Blue Raja to prove their worth. First order of
business: A backyard barbeque to hold auditions for new partners, where
such funny rejects as Waffle Man (special power: "truth syrup") and PMS
Avenger expire their moment in the spotlight.</P>
<P>Enter the real deals ... well, sort of: Paul "Pee-Wee Herman" Rueben's
flatulent Spleen, Wes Studi's uber-enigmatic Sphinx, Kel Mitchell's
affable Invisible Boy and "Mystery" MVP Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler,
whose ball - containing both her dead father's skull and spirit - throws
like a destructive boomerang. Once these cads come together following a
shaky beginning, "Mystery Men" stands tall and proud on terra firma.
Usher piles his freak show high in trappings so garish and silly that
they occasionally topple under the weight, especially the messy action
sequence that inaugurates the movie. But when they fly, they soar.</P>
<P>"Mystery Men" similarly finishes on a sloppy note, as each individual
good guy gets his or her chance to shine in the run-of-the-mill
climactic battle; the film dangerously courts becoming what it so far
has poked a generous amount of fun at. But even with Usher's
inexperience creating cluttered bookends, the long, strong midsection's
mirthful mayhem and summer-flick satirizing are as irresistible as the
priceless cast. Given the delightfully demented accomplishment here, a
sequel that reunites these super friends and their behind-the-scenes
counterparts - in some cases older, in others wiser - isn't out of the
question.<HR></P>

"Upon hearing word of this outrage, ‘Star Wars' creator George Lucas (in
the throes of developing scripts for the two remaining "Star Wars"
films) quickly removed all references to an upcoming character allegedly
named Stingy MacHaggis, a kilt-wearing alien who was to spend a good
portion of ‘Episode II' drinking, picking fights and playing an alien
musical instrument that strongly resembled a set of bagpipes.  He is to
be replaced by another alien character - a formless, colorless and mute
creature who in no way resembles any culture or individual that ever
existed or ever will exist. -AAlgar on "The Phantom Menace"'s
race-stereotyping controversy</P>
