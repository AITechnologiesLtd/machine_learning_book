<PRE>Deep Impact (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Before even seeing a single frame of the film, it would be easy to snicker
at Deep Impact, in which a comet on a collision course with Earth threatens
the existence of all life on the planet.  It is the latest entry in this
decade's dubious revival of the '70s disaster film, and the first of two
"the sky is falling" flicks to hit screens this year (the other being this
coming July's Armageddon, in which a meteor is the threat).  Its tagline,
"Oceans Rise.  Cities fall.  Hope survives" is not as cornball as that of
the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller Daylight ("They came in
alone... the only way out... is together"), but it's every bit as treacly.</P>
<P>The opening moments of Deep Impact offer more to snicker at.  The
cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions, such as the
usual opening "roll call," in which all the major characters and their
personal problems are introduced.  The most prominent of the "personal"
stories is that of ambitious TV news reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni), who
is distraught that her father (Maximilian Schell) left her mother (Vanessa
Redgrave) for a younger woman (Rya Kihlstedt).  What is just as
snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between Paramount and DreamWorks SKG
aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration, Microsoft
and NBC's cable news network MSNBC, which employs Jenny, who is the film's
ostensible main character.  In the vision of America presented here, MSNBC
is the television news source of choice in every home, when in reality it
only reaches a fraction of the country.</P>
<P>The initial signs point toward something along the lines of a Volcano or
Dante's Peak, but there's one thing about Deep Impact I underestimated: the
skills of director Mimi Leder.  She won an Emmy for her helming work on
NBC's smash ER, which is essentially a weekly disaster movie, each episode
featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical
crises.  The challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold:
(1) to make the audience care for these guest characters, regardless of how
briefly seen or thinly written they are, and (2) powerfully tug at the
emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic.  Having passed
the "ER challenge" in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating
suspense in The Peacemaker, Leder could not be a better fit to bring
Michael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin's rather formulaic disaster screenplay
to screen.</P>
<P>As the countdown to impact progresses, the ominous feeling of doom is
palpable, leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and
affecting emotional dimension.  There's nothing here that will profoundly
move anyone, but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high
achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects.  Situations
that initially feel contrived, such as Jenny's familial crisis and the
teenage romance between Sarah Hotchner (Leelee Sobieski) and comet
discoverer Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood), achieve some poignance; and even
the more vaguely drawn characters, including U.S. President Tom Beck
(Morgan Freeman), astronaut Spurgeon "Fish" Tanner (Robert Duvall), and his
rather faceless crew (Ron Eldard, Jon Favreau, Mary McCormack, Blair
Underwood, and Alexander Baluyev) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft
Messiah, have their share of touching moments.  The latter fact owes a debt
to the actors, who all do a solid job and are well-cast, with the possible
exception of Leoni; she delivers a decent performance, but her trademark
unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to
buy as a star news broadcaster.</P>
<P>Although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work (the
giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular) place Deep Impact in the
same category as the likes of Twister, it is the first of the '90s disaster
films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that
ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact, even if it isn't as deep as
hoped.</P>

 get it.  I still don't know how to react."
