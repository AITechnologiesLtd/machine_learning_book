THE GIFT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>THE GIFT, directed by Sam Raimi (A SIMPLE PLAN) and written by Billy Bob 
Thornton (Oscar winner for SLING BLADE) and Tom Epperson (ONE FALSE 
MOVE), is an entertaining psychological thriller and murder mystery.  
Even if the formulaic plot suffers from a certain amount of 
predictability, the movie has a superb cast who keep the tension up 
throughout.</P>
<P>Academy Award-nominee Cate Blanchett (ELIZABETH) delivers an empathetic 
performance as Annie Wilson, the only psychic reader, a.k.a. fortune 
teller, in a poor, small town.  She also serves as a one-person support 
group for all of the troubled people in town.  One of these is Valerie 
Barksdale (Hilary Swank, Best Actress winner for BOYS DON'T CRY), who is 
being abused by her husband Donnie (Keanu Reeves).  Giovanni Ribisi, who 
is best when playing nut cases, plays Buddy Cole, an auto mechanic full 
of hidden demons and another wounded soul being nurtured by Annie.  </P>
<P>Annie is a fairly recent widow with 3 young boys to raise on her own.  
Donnie, who thinks Annie is a witch, threatens her and her boys.  In a 
side story, Greg Kinnear plays the boys' principal, Wayne Collins, who 
is currently engaged to Jessica King (Katie Holmes), a frisky young 
woman with wandering eyes.</P>
<P>Into this soap opera of a story come a murder and a mystery.  Of course, 
Annie is asked to help out, and she reluctantly agrees.  The script 
carefully gives Annie less than laser sharp powers.  Her visions cannot 
be summoned at will.  When she does sense something, she experiences it 
personally.  As she trembles with palpable fear, she witnesses 
frightening events but frequently sees only small parts of a much larger 
episode.  Putting these mental puzzle pieces together in her head, she 
eventually draws certain conclusions.  Collecting the entire picture, 
however, is frequently difficult or impossible for her.</P>
<P>Blanchett's acting alone is enough to recommend the movie.  Annie is 
saddened by all of the woes she has heard and frightened by the events 
swirling around her.  Her power itself appears to be more burden than 
blessing.  Trembling, she keeps awaking from nightmare visions that are 
trying to reveal things to her so that she can help others.  She is a 
sensitive psychic who doesn't like to tell people the bad news that she 
sees coming.</P>
<P>Bringing up the natural background sounds sometimes and using 
melancholic instrumental country music at others, Raimi gives his movie 
a realism that transcends the story's more sensational elements.  I find 
that any movie, as this one does, that features a trial is usually a 
cinematic gift.  I'd trade a dozen teen comedies for one exceptional 
trial. I rate the trial in THE GIFT worth only two or three teen 
comedies. Still, a trial is a trial, and I'm happy to be able to enjoy 
it.</P>
<P>THE GIFT runs 1:50.  It is rated R for violence, language, sexuality and 
nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
