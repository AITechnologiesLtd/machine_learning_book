<P>I just can't believe there was actually a bit of controversy surrounding
this film.  Though aimed specifically at children (and those of childish
minds), this film was awarded a "PG-13" rating for basically toilet
humor, and it still grossed well over one hundred million.  But upon its
release, many critics were almost brutal in their dislike for the film.
Nathaniel R. Atcheson, for instance, completely flew off the handle and
said that this film made him want to vomit.  "Feces are never funny," he
proclaimed, as he completely dismissed toilet humor as an adequate
artform,  especially not as entertainment for kids.  Roger Ebert rebuked
that (though not directly).  In his review, he claimed that toilet humor
is not at all a bad thing, and in fact is part of the grounds for
developing a sense of humor.  I agree.  There are no rules to comedy,
and in fact anything can work as humor - that's the point of it:
laughing at the shit life drops on us, so to speak.  In fact, if I had
not been taught at a very young age to laugh at flatuation, I would have
never survived the way Elementary School and Junior High chose to
torment me because of the pronunication of my last name (and they didn't
even know what a "prig" was).</P>
<P>Ebert awarded the film a 3-star recommendation because of this.  I won't
even come close to taking it that far.  Yes, I agree that toilet humor
is a valid type of comedy, as I agree that anything and everything can
be a valid type of comedy.  But that doesn't mean this new adaptation of
"Dr. Dolittle" is actually funny, just because it was attacked for its
application of toilet humor.  In fact, I think I may have grimaced once,
if not twice, during the entire length of this film.  The problem, I
fear, is not in its tone or all that other bullshit it's been attacked
for, but rather in its actual jokes.  There's one thing wrong with them:
they're not funny.  You've heard a bad joke, right?  Not the kind that
offends you or anything, but instead the kind that isn't even worth
acknowledgement because it's just so unhilarious.  Well, think of an
entire 90 minutes of jokes exactly like that, and you have the newly
enhanced "Dr. Dolittle," which has nothing to do with the original Rex
Harrison musical classic except that for namesake and its very basic
skin-and-bones gimmick (that a man can hear animals talk).</P>
<P>The fact that this is a loose remake is not a problem, though: I don't
care what they do with a remake, even if they decided to remake "Citizen
Kane" starring Carrot Top; as long as they just made it work.  This one
doesn't, and it's not even in the plotting.  This one deals with a John
Dolittle (Eddie Murphy) who, as a kid, could hear animals talk, notably
his dog/best friend (voiced by Ellen Degeneres), but lost the ability
when his father (Ossie Davis) took the dog away.  He's grown up to be a
successful doctor, with a pretty wife (Kristen Wilson), and two nice
daughters (Kyla Pratt and "The Cosby Show"'s Ramon-Simone), and has
since forgotten all about his childhood ability.  One day, for no real
reason, animals start talking to him, first by a dog named Lucky (voiced
by Norm MacDonald), who is almost hit by him when driving, and then by
numerous others.</P>
<P>This begins to tax on his sanity, and when no one believes him, and he's
making unbelievably awkward decisions to accomodate his ability (such as
helping all the animals like the world's greatest veteranarian so
they'll just leave him alone - yeah, that's your cure, John), he winds
up in a nuthouse.  Meanwhile, his hospital staff is merging with another
one (in the form of Peter Boyle) and his two head assistants are divided
into the conservative nice guy (underrated character actor Richard
Schiff) and greedy-as-balls pseudo-villain (the great Oliver Platt), so
there's a bit of forced let's-take-up-some-screen-time conflict going on
other than the animals/sanity bit.</P>
<P>The most humorous thing about this film is the celebrities who play the
animals, but not really because of the writing involved.  I more or less
was mildly amused throughout the film as I distracted myself from the
boredom I had succumb to by playing "Guess Whose Voice That Is?"  Chris
Rock pops up as a guinea pig.  John Leguiziamo shows up as a rat.  Julie
Kavner and Gary Shandling make a cameo as a pair of bickering pigeons.
And (my favorite) Albert Brooks stars as a suicidal tiger.  Not that
their scenes are actually gut-bursting or anything.  Brooks, especially,
isn't given anything very interesting to talk about, even when it has
the potential to be the funniest thing about the movie (and it probably
is anyway).  Instead, his subplot is played nearly straight, and since
the idea of a sucidal tiger can probably only be played as comedy, his
subplot comes off as disturbingly, well, Live-Action-Disney-esque.
Never would I have thought that a side story involving a suicidal tiger
would be the cherry on the top of a dramatic arc, but then again, I can
be easily surprised.</P>
<P>The handling of the animals should have worked, though, as the
foundation of the comedy in this film.  There are many opportunities for
jokes, and it has the right fallacy: that the animals are exactly like
humans personality-wise, but have bitchings about their own kind of
lives.  Nothing they say is particularly humorous, though, and with
Murphy playing the straight man (and nicely, I should add - though this
film doesn't require old school Eddie Murphy tactics, it does show great
modesty on his behalf...or, at the very least, insecurity to take a big
comic risk after the result of his early-to-mid 90s career), there's
really nothing to keep interest.  The result is that the film is a big
fat bore, and after about a half hour or so of unfunny funniness, I
began checking my watch repeatedly, wondering how long I had left until
I could watch something with a little more class.  Say, "Dumb and
Dumber."</P>
