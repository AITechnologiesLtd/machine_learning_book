Toy Story 2</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Magnificent, super fantastic, rich, wonderful, full,
stop-what-your-doing-and-go-see-it appeal.</P>
<P>Where can I start? Voices? Terrific. How about visuals and art direction?
Superb. Action? Comedy? Fun? Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay, then screenplay and story
line? Better than the original "Toy Story." A mere ounce of this carefully
refined script could fuel a rocketship to infinity and beyond!</P>
<P>What are you doing this weekend? Don't worry about that new opera in town,
take a pass on the blues band at the local bar, blow off the Sunday night
game, duck out of your best buddy's big bash -- go see this film. Kids or no
kids, date or no date, heck -- go alone!</P>
<P>Oh, so you didn't see "Toy Story" (a mishap easily corrected). Relax, take
the week to rent it. Go see "Toy Story 2" next week or the one following --
don't worry, it won't be blasting off the screen anytime too soon. This is a
sequel after all, although it could still be enjoyed as a stand alone,
knowledge of the pre-story can only make this excellent production that much
more endearing.</P>
<P>And what a production it is! When 100% of the visual imagery is computer
generated, the director has millisecond control over ever edit, every cut,
every action sequence -- director John Lasseter takes full advantage. A
stream of star-burst colors blend animated characters with a kaleidoscopic
of voices, rock solid scripting and pinpoint direction. It's fun, uproarious
and plainly a great treat you shouldn't deny yourself. Forget the kids, take
two hours and go see it!</P>
