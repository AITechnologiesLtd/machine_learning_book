<PRE>                                 PULP FICTION
                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1994 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     An odd trend in movies this year is good filmmakers paying loving
tribute to bad art.  Earlier this month, director Tim Burton's tribute
to one of the worst filmmakers of all-time was released.  Now with PULP
FICTION, another hot young director, Quentin Tarantino, has paid
tribute to some of the worst that literature has to offer.  The result
is an intriguing, unusual film that eventually is hurt by the fact that
it emulates the lurid novels that inspired it a bit *too* well.</P>
<P>     Tarantino's screenplay intertwines four different stories
(credited to Tarantino and Roger Avery) only occasionally allowing
those stories to intersect.  The film occasionally shifts, sometimes
awkwardly, to follow different stories.  One story involves a couple of
robbers/lovers (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer)  who decide to try and
simplify their lives with a switch to robbing restaurants instead of
liquor stores.  Another story follows a hitman named Vincent (John
Travolta) as he is required to take his boss' wife Mia (Uma Thurman)
out to dinner while the boss (Ving Rhames) is out of town.  A third
story is centered around boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) who fails
to take a fall as ordered after being paid off by Rhames.  Finally, the
fourth story involves Vincent and his partner Jules (Samuel L. Jackson)
as they try to clean up the messy results of a hit gone wrong.</P>
<P>     The film does not attempt to tell these stories in a linear
manner.  The film is broken up into "chapters" much like a real pulp
novel.  It even includes cheesy chapter titles that are used to
indicate the shift to a different storyline.  The movie even doubles
back on itself a number of times instead of allowing events to unfold
in a chronological order.  Like the novels that inspired the film, PULP
FICTION largely abandons all the standard rules of structure and orders
the scenes for maximum impact.</P>
<P>     The cast works largely as an ensemble and the performances are
without exception very good.  Of course, pulp novels are not known for
strong characterizations, but the actors manage to create some very
distinctive and performances even with relatively little to work with.
Many critics have discussed this film as being a "comeback" for John
Travolta and it certainly is his strongest performance in a long time.
His character is written as kind of a dim bulb, but Travolta manages to
give him some distinctive personality.  During one of the film's best
sequences, Travolta and Thurman participate in a dance contest.  It
really comes through to the audience that he is having an absolutely
terrific time sending up his earlier career.</P>
<P>     Besides Travolta, Bruce Willis is probably the actor with the most
screen time in this movie.  Willis is another actor who often does not
receive the respect that he deserves.  He has occasionally made some
poor choices when selecting movies, but his performances are frequently
very strong.  Without strong direction he does sometimes mug a bit too
much, but Tarantino does a good job keeping him under control here.</P>
<P>     Samuel L. Jackson is the actor who may end up benefiting the most
from this film.  He is given the most serious and most well-developed
character here and gives a career making performance.  Jackson has been
solid in a number of high profile films (including JURASSIC PARK), but
this is the meatiest, most interesting performance he has given to
date.</P>
<P>     Two of the film's most enjoyable performances are essentially
cameos.  Like in his earlier screenplay for TRUE ROMANCE, Tarantino
wrote one wonderful, brief scene for Christopher Walken.  I won't ruin
anything by trying to describe his monologue, but it provides the
film's biggest laugh.  Harvey Keitel is also allowed to shine in a
small, but pivotal role as a "problem solver".  The role is basically a
variation on Keitel's earlier role in POINT OF NO RETURN, but he plays
it to the hilt.  Other entertaining cameo performances are given by
Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, and even Tarantino himself.</P>
<P>     Tarantino's biggest strength as a writer tends to be dialog.  This
movie is packed with clever conversation.  A number of cliched
situations are livened up by the unusually sharp and memorable dialog.
Tarantino perfectly captures the vulgar, profanity-laced dialog that is
standard in pulp novels.  Tarantino is also very good at capturing on
film the lurid and vulgar tone of the individual scenes from a pulp
novel.  The scenes all *feel* like they came from an old-fashioned dime
novel.</P>
<P>     Despite the film's many strengths, it eventually is hurt by its
very subject matter.  The movie is full of interesting parts and
pieces, but none of it ever really adds up to much of anything.  This
is generally true of the novels that inspired the film as well, but
this leaves the viewer with kind of an empty feeling.</P>
<P>     Another problem is that pulp novels tend to be best in small
doses.  The constant vulgarity and graphic violence tends to wear thin
after a while and to become kind of tedious.  At over two and a half
hours in length, PULP FICTION goes on a bit too long.  It is helped
somewhat by the shifts from story to story, but it still becomes a bit
headache inducing after a while.</P>
<P>     One of the best ways to judge a film is to look at how well the
movie accomplishes what it sets out to do and PULP FICTION really does
succeed very well by this test.  It is a *very* accurate recreation of
the pulp novels that inspired it with all of their strengths and
weaknesses.  The movie goes on a bit long and it consists of a lot of
interesting parts that never really come together all that well, but it
is still a very interesting and worthwhile effort.</P>
