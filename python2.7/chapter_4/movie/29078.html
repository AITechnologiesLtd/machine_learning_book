<P>Well, here's something we don't see very often. "Original Sin," based on the 
novel "Waltz Into Darkness" by Cornell Woolrich, is a motion picture that has 
enlisted the aide of two big stars to tell a melodramatic, overwrought 
potboiler. It plays like a cross between the latest installment of the 
direct-to-video erotica series, "Body Chemistry," and 1999's elegantly woven 
"The Talented Mr. Ripley," yet its occasional dips into pure insipid 
filmmaking are so loopy it sort of invokes a charm all its own. </P>
<P>Told through elongated flashbacks by American temptress Julia Russell 
(Angelina Jolie), who is in jail and about to be executed for an unknown 
crime, her troublesome ways lead her into the arms of Luis Vargas (Antonio 
Banderas), a wealthy, Cuban merchant who requests for a mail-order bride. She 
comes in the form of the bewitching Julia, who doesn't look like the picture 
that has been sent to him, but explains that she didn't want a man that was 
only looking for external beauty. Moving in with Luis and instantly getting 
married, Julia and Luis are both taken by surprise when they find that they 
truly are connecting and falling in love with one another. </P>
<P>Enter Detective Walter Downs (Thomas Jane), a man sent by Julia's sister to 
search for her whereabouts when she doesn't receive a reply to the letters 
she has mailed. Soon after, Julia disappears (along with practically all of 
Luis' bank account). Had Julia been merely deceiving Luis the entire time? 
And who exactly is she, when it is discovered that the real Julia Russell was 
murdered while on the ship transporting her to Cuba--the same one that the 
fraudulent "Julia" was on? </P>
<P>Written and directed by Michael Cristofer (who got his start with Jolie on 
the cable movie, "Gia"), "Original Sin" is a "Jeckyl and Hyde"-sort of tale, 
both in terms of plotting and payoff. Until the very end, the characters 
remain specters whose true intentions are always in question, and even then, 
their true selves are left open for debate. As a thriller set during the turn 
of the 20th-century, the film moves at a relatively slow pace, yet casts a 
spell of mystery of intrigue that is palpably felt. It features moments of 
sheer power and earnestness (and even a few surprising twists), and others 
that are so misdirected and ludicrously written, they must be seen to be 
believed. The movie is not a comedy, but judging from the near-consistent 
laughter that came from the audience, it has what it takes to become a camp 
classic. Like 1980's infamous "Mommie Dearest," the picture is serious-minded 
and ambitious, yet so incredibly banal as to become an unintentional riot. </P>
<P>To get an idea of just how goofy the movie can get, a key character blatantly 
shoots another right in front of two police officers, and then nonchalantly 
tells them that there's no need for him to get medical help--because he's now 
dead for good! In a "Naked Gun"-style spoof, this would be a comedic 
showstopper. In a serious period piece, it is so uninhibitedly oddball that 
it almost crosses over into the realm of brilliance for its sincerely 
clueless courageousness. </P>
<P>Just for keeping a straight face throughout, Antonio Banderas (2001's "Spy 
Kids") and Angelina Jolie (much better here than in this summer's "Tomb 
Raider") should receive well-earner accolades. Both actors bring an 
unexpected intensity to their roles that often manage to hide the technical 
inanities of the film, and for Jolie, this is her most challenging and 
impressive turn since 1999's "Girl, Interrupted," for which she won an Oscar. 
In a pivotal supporting role, Thomas Jane (1999's "Deep Blue Sea") is 
exceptional as the detective who teams up with Luis to find, and possibly 
murder, Julia. Jane has a smoldering profundity about him that calls upon the 
incomparable Russell Crowe for inspiration. </P>
<P>Of special note for those interested, Banderas and Jolie also perform a 
couple of sex scenes that are so prolonged and explicit (with Banderas 
getting ample opportunity to show off his backside, and Jolie exposing her 
double--ahem--assets), they could almost pass for soft-corn porn. How this 
got past the MPAA with an R-rating when the blasphemous organization unfairly 
strikes down upon every other sexual situation that occurs in today's movies 
is one for the stars. </P>
<P>I can't wholeheartedly recommend "Original Sin," although fans of the actors 
will certainly want to check them out in very good performances stuck in one 
of the weirdest big-budget movies to come around the pike in some time. Is it 
a laugh riot? An erotic thriller in the vein of "Red Shoe Diaries?" An 
involving romantic mystery that, as Julia Russell so eloquently puts it, "is 
not a love story, but a story about love?" You be the judge. One thing's for 
certain: "Original Sin" may not be looked upon as a particularly good movie 
(and it isn't), but it surely won't be forgotten. </P>
