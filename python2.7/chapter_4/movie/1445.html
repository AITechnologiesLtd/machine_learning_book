<PRE>                                 COOL WORLD
                      Film comments by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>   - The title has *got* to be a joke.  This is the ugliest and most uncool
     world I can imagine.  Gabriel Byrne must be mis-cast since he just does
     not seem freak-o enough to have imagined this world.  The parallel
     world would have anyone screaming to get out after fifteen minutes.</P>
<P>   - The idea that comic artists are really seeing a parallel universe is an
     old one.  I seem to remember in the 1960s they claimed that the current
     Flash lived in the same universe as the artists who drew the old Flash
     (the one with the Mercury helmet).  but the old Flash was really in a
     parallel universe.  And I'm pretty sure the idea goes at least as far
     back as 1930s fantasy.</P>
<P>   - Cardboard scenery seems out of place.  Cool World should be made of
     pure animation and live action.  The cardboard scenery makes no sense.</P>
<PRE>   - They seem to have made up the rules of the two universes as they went
     along and failed to explain some.  Why does Holli have clown flashes?
     What does the spike of power have to do with any of this?</PRE>
<P>   - There are a few clever little satires on other animated films and
     perhaps a good line or two, but the incoherent story just is not very
     interesting.  It's a pity, since at least initially the concept seemed
     more complex and interesting than that of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.</P>
<PRE>   - The pun on Holli Would is pretty lame.  Why repeat it in all the ads?</PRE>
<P>   - Harris in 1945 is seeing a world that is in a cartoon style that would
     not be invented for another twenty years.  He would be used to
     animation of the Fleischer and Disney schools.  That should make the
     Cool World seem even more alien to him.</P>
<PRE>   - I give it a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
