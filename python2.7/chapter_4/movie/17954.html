<P>I agree with most critics that this is a fine movie, but let's be frank
here, originality ain't this movie's strong suit! If you liked any
combination of the following movies, you will probably enjoy the goings-on
in this film, despite its deja-vu feel at times: ROUNDERS (7/10), RESERVOIR
DOGS (9.5/10), OUT OF SIGHT (8/10), TRUE ROMANCE (9.5/10), TRAINSPOTTING
(9/10) and PULP FICTION (7.5/10).</P>
<P>PLOT:
Four dudes that get in over their head after losing a chunk of dough in a
poker match to a really nasty, bad guy, have to figure out a way to repay
the man half a million pounds before the end of the week. Plenty of crime,
seedy, underground characters and unpleasantries ensue.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Fun, interesting, rehash of yet another crime caper starring a sackful of
quirky and degenerate characters, which features some fine acting by all
involved, a hot-dogging soundtrack, and some of the finer stylish shots to
hit crime cinema since 1996's TRAINSPOTTING. Granted, some of the filming
techniques used to stir our imagination are somewhat overused, but still
cool to watch, especially the stop-motion slo-mo stuff sprinkled throughout.
I did enjoy the plot line as well, but my rating of this film versus all of
the others mentioned above, gives you an indication of how derivatives of a
great thing, don't always impact the viewer as much as the originals did.
That, and the fact that I had to filter out a good lump of the dialogue due
to the ol' British accents and slang.</P>
<P>Unlike Tarantino movies, this film wasn't peppered with pop references all
over the place, but it did lace itself with a fine overtone of comedy and
irony. It doesn't even try to hide its influences, with plenty of hinted
homages to the many recent great crime films mixed into its lair of colorful
characters, stylish bravado and double-smoking entertainment. You'll
probably like this movie if you're "into" this whole hip, black comedic
crime flicks theme, or if you really dig films with a lot of flashy style.
You'll probably hate it, if you think that many of the films that I named
above sucked. Note: There are almost no women in this entire movie.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Guy Ritchie started his career off as a TV commercial director.
"Hatchet" Harry's collector in this movie named Big Chris, is played by
actual "football" star Vinnie Jones. Noted as one of soccer's hard men, he
leapt to fame when a photographer at a match snapped him "marking" another
player by grabbing his testicles. His nickname is "Psycho".
Trudie Styler is one of the executive producers of this film. In real life,
she is married to singer/actor Sting, who happens to play the role of Eddy's
dad in this movie. Sting's real name is Gordon Matthew Sumner.
This film was nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film
at the 1998 British Academy Awards, and won a best director award for Guy
Ritchie at the 1998 Tokyo International Film Festival.
