<P>   Much as we like to push such questions to the fringes of
our minds, we can't help thinking about what happens to
us after we die.  Is there a heaven and is there a hell?  If so,
would the latter be a more interesting place to spend eternity,
as some revisionists half-jokingly claim?  No one put the
inquiry in better literary form than Shakespeare, whose
suicidal Hamlet chose to live after fearing what would happen
"when we have shuffled our this mortal coil."  No wonder,
then, that directors and screenwriters have let their
imaginations run freely as they've conjured up comedies and
dramas about life after death, the splashy American entry,
"What Dreams May Come" being the latest commercial
venture into that crowded field.</P>
<P>   Films about the afterlife are a natural for the cinema, the
most visually kinetic of the art forms and so well suited to
flights of fancy.  What, then, got into the head of Kore-Eda
Hirokazu in his second directorial feature, "After Life," which
has to be about the most static film ever made about the
subject?  What a rejection of the most basic concept of film,
the principal factor that separates it from books.  Film is a
visual medium.  Don't tell me; show me.  Talking heads are
more suited to the stage and even in the legitimate theater,
directors typically exploit technology to bring the page to life.
Hirokazu makes the same mistake as had Mike Nichols in
choosing the inert "The Designated Mourner" as his first
acting vehicle.</P>
<P>   What is particularly surprising is the near-hysteria that
greeted the introduction of the film at various festivals,
evoking sell-out crowds and rave reviews online critics like
David Dalgleish, who called this "a masterpiece...warm,
intimate, direct" and Richard Scheib, who decided at the
Vancouver International Film Festival last year that this is a
"marvelous little Japanese film...that kind of creeps up on
you."  De gustibus non disputandem est, as they say, or in
other words, thank goodness critics' opinions on any given
movie run the gamut of else a lot of writers would have to
look for jobs.</P>
<P>   Director Kore-Eda Hirokazu was induced to make this film
by his grandfather's senility.  As he states in the production
notes, the poor old man suffered from Alzheimer's disease,
gradually forgetting even that he had eaten (he requested a
dinner just after completing a meal), could not find his way
home, and failed to recognize the people of his family or
even himself.  "I now understand," thought Hirokazu, "How
critical memories are to our identity."  </P>
<P>   "After Life" focuses on the importance of memory by
presenting an allegory about people who have just died and
are at a half-way house between earth and heaven.  There is
nothing elaborate about the space: a dilapidated building that
resembles a New York City public high school houses a
mostly young staff who interview a barrage of the newly
deceased each Monday, giving them three days to make a
decision.  They are told that heaven does not exist as any of
them now believe the place to be, but that a substitute is
currently available.  Each of the clients is to think of his or
her single fondest memory.  That is the recollection that will
be filmed, and then the subject could repeat the episode for
eternity. There's more.  All the client's other remembrances
will be deleted as easily as this computer can expunge this
entire review, as though Alzheimer's has claimed all the bad
memories and guilt trips.  Sound good?  Not to the Western
mind, perhaps.  We--at least in America--believe that variety
is the spice of life and that anything, even the most enjoyable
experience, can become like a hell woven from Jean-Paul
Sartre's "No Exit" if reproduced day in, day out.  Think of the
Malcolm McDowell's character in "Clockwork Orange" having
to listen to the glory of Beethoven's Ninth once, twice, thrice,
ad infinitum.</P>
<P>   Those who are enamored of this film will probably point to
the humor and poignancy of the newly dead who are being
interviewed by the staff.  One old lady, asked to conjure up
her favorite memory, simply stares out of the window or lines
up figurines on the table.  A young punk who died at the age
of 21 defiantly refuses to make a choice.  A girl of about the
same age recalls her trip to Disneyland and the kindness of a
friend who gave her a couple of pancakes when she did not
have the money to buy her own breakfast.  A disreputable-
looking man of late-middle age talks only about sex,
confirming what so women believe that this is the only thing
that men think about.  Of all the patrons, the most involving is
one 70-year-old fellow who, like several others, has had a life
so banal that he can barely think of a single memory he'd like
to preserve for all time.  He has to go through quite a few
videotapes which had recorded his life, one tape to a year,
and even then has difficulty eliciting a single, truly
pleasurable moment in three-score and ten years.</P>
<P>   Online critic David Dalgleish reports that he was
immeasurably moved by an interview with an elderly woman
who recalls a dance she attended to a song called "The Red
Shoes."  A young girl stands in for her and performed a brief
recital which, Dalgleish insists, "move me, inexplicably, to
tears."  Did we see the same film?</P>
<P>   Hirokazu's principal claim to imaginative fame is that he
interweaves a film with the looks of a documentary into a
fictionalized, allegorical drama, using real people he recruited
from such places as nursing homes along with professional
actors.  The film does possess tenderness and gentle humor,
but while the fable would make for a fine piece of literature,
on the screen it lacks the very life claimed by its title.</P>
