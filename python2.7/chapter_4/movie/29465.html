<P>Susan Granger's review of "TWO CAN PLAY THAT GAME" (Screen Gems)</P>
<P>  Since the success of "Waiting to Exhale," there have been several
romantic comedies about African-American professionals. This female revenge
fantasy, Vivica A. Fox plays Shante Smith, a stunning ad exec who seems to have
reached the pinnacle of success: a mansion, a sporty car and an idyllic
relationship with a hunky, hot-shot lawyer, Morris Chestnut. She's at a point in
her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girl-friends (Mo'Nique, Wendy
Racquel Robinson, Tamala Jones). "When your man messes up, no matter how small
it is," she smugly decrees, "yuh gots to punish him." So when she catches her
hot man dancing at a bar with a smart and sexy rival, Gabrielle Union, she
devises her own version of "The Rules," a 10-day "tough love" emotionally
punishing plan to get him back. Unfortunately, writer/director Mark Brown ("How
To Be a Player") breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy: you have to like
the protagonist - and shrill, self-congratulatory Shante Smith is a smirking,
superficial, spiteful shrew who doesn't realize that rational rules cannot
always be applied to love. Having her talk directly into the camera gets stale
very quickly and the "Day One," "Day Two" title-card device underscores the
tedium. Comic Anthony Anderson scores as Chestnut's boisterous best-friend, and
singer Bobby Brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic who's given a smooth
makeover by Ms. Robinson. But the out-takes over the closing credits contain
more humor than the film itself. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Two Can
Play That Game" is smarmy if slick 4, filled with misogynistic attitude and
blatant product placements (Coca-Cola, Miller Genuine Draft) but little else. In
this R-rated (for explicit sexual language), pseudo-hip battle of the sexes, the
audience loses.</P>
