<P>Few would have expected Rafal Zielinski, a director of simple teenage
sex comedies, to come up with this riveting study of two girls
detained in a juvenile correction facility.  Bonnie (Alicia Witt) and
Hillary (Renee Humphrey) meet on the side of the road one morning.  By
the day's end they have committed themselves to a lifelong friendship
sealed in a pact of blood.  William R. Moses and Leslie Hope play the
two adults trying to get to grips with the two girls and unearth the
full story behind their crime.  While both have common goals, their
motivations are different - Hope is a prim, businesslike prison
counselor determined to drive a wedge between the closed bond the
girls have formed; Moses is a magazine journalist who at first appears
out of his depth but gradually gains some insight into Hillary, the
more approachable of the duo.  His reasons for `getting the story'
have a resonance that is relevant to our experience of the film
itself: he feels it is Hillary's duty to explain every detail of her
senseless, violent crime so that she may share with his readers her
experience and help them understand what makes a young teenager go so
wildly off the rails.  Of course, we are undergoing an identically
vicarious situation by not only peering in on the interrogation of the
two girls but also reliving their crime through flashbacks.  Whether
or not, however, we gain a greater understanding of the girls is
murky.  Throughout, they insist on only one motivation for their acts:
fun.</P>
<P>I'm not sure why Zielinski chose to film the present-day sequences in
black and white and the flashbacks in color (other than to subvert the
convention of doing it the other way around) but they provide an
appropriate contrast of worlds - the word of adult reason, where there
is a clear definition of right and wrong/black and white; and the
girls' own world, an ephemeral, careless playground of `fun'.  As the
two teenagers, Witt and Humphrey are dazzling.  Witt is so natural
it's hard to believe her lines were scripted - what an ear for
dialogue writer James Bosley has!  Her delirious performance is what
you'll remember most from this film.  FUN is not for all tastes: these
girls are frank, vulgar, and frighteningly irresponsible - some
viewers may be disturbed that teenagers will identify with the
characters' high-octane teen angst and take their own best-friend
coteries to an illogical extreme.  This seems more specifically
pertinent when you remember that Bonnie and Hillary, who are greatly
influenced by movies and television themselves, appear uninterested in
forming any dissociation between their realities and fictions. 
Hillary frames her prison interviews the way they would exist in a
TV-movie; Bonnie, a habitual liar, persists in reciting a scenario in
which she is one of an army of invisible ninja.  The irony is that
this effect makes the movie appear even more real.  In fact, what's
most spooky about it is that its resemblance to based-on-fact
dramatizations is so strong there's virtually no distinction between
them.</P>
