<P>After winning an Oscar for "L.A. Confidential", Kim Basinger had a baby 
and took a rest from movies for three years. This is not a great way to 
return. "Bless the Child" is yet another shoddy and uninteresting movie 
about dark forces -- throw it onto the pile with "Stigmata" and "Book of 
Shadows: Blair Witch 2".</P>
<P>Basinger stars as Maggie O'Connor, a psychiatric nurse left to raise her 
young niece Cody (Holliston Coleman) when her heroin-addicted sister 
Jenna (Angela Bettis) skips town. The child is quiet and withdrawn -- 
autistic, everyone assumes, until she's kidnapped by a gang of 
Satan-worshipping child killers who have discovered she's the Second 
Coming, and want to use her power for evil.</P>
<P>The first half of the movie involves Basinger's raising of the child; 
it's dumb in its hammy dialogue and cliched, obvious scenes of creepy
noises coming from nowhere clear, but so familiar it's somewhat 
involving, and contains the potential to turn into good pulp fiction. 
Structural elements are stolen from "The Exorcist", and hey, if you're 
gonna steal, steal from the best.</P>
<P>Ah, but it turns to vinegar. It's annoying stupid, not fun stupid. There 
are a parade of vulgar scenes depicting the kid's greatness, showing her 
bring birds back to life and light candles through telekinesis, during 
which I thought, shouldn't the child of God be a wise and kind-hearted 
revolutionary, rather than a smug little kid pulling Houdini tricks? 
Several moments defy common sense, such as one in which a cult defector 
sits in a cafe giving Basinger information, and in run a bunch of 
Satanists who give the defector chase and don't think to touch Basinger 
at all. The movie wants us to take it seriously, and yet there are 
sneering villains, guns waved around, and cars dangling off bridges.</P>
<P>It's funny at times -- how could it not be when one of the baddies is a 
ludicrously stone-faced Mrs. Danvers clone, the climax takes place in a 
cobweb-filled haunted house, and at one point knitting needles are used 
as murder weapons? At other times it's just sick -- you can't laugh too 
hard when you're watching Devil-worshippers burning homeless people to 
death and committing ritual infanticide.</P>
<P>One other thing -- the special effects are terrible. They look like 
pieces of cartoon superimposed over live action. Five years ago movie 
visuals were so perfect that mentioning them in reviews seemed 
redundant. Nowadays they almost always suck. A sign, perhaps, that the 
digital revolution ain't all it's cracked up to be?</P>
