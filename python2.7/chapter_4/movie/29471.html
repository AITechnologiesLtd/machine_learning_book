<PRE>"Bully"</PRE>
<P>On 14 July 1993 teenager Bobby Kent disappeared without a trace in Florida.
Then, his friends were arrested and tried for his murder. The reason for
their heinous crime? He was their tormenter. Filmmaker Larry Clark ("Kids")
explores this incident in "Bully."</P>
<P>Bobby (Nick Stahl) has been a friend, since childhood, with Marty Puccio
(Brad Renfro). He has always held the dominant hand in the friendship,
though, abusing his buddy with the unexpected, painful punch for one
infraction or another. Up until now, Marty has accepted the abrupt
violence, but when he starts dating Lisa (Rachel Miner) and complains about
the abuse, she puts the bug in his ear that he can stop it. The seed of
murder is soon planted and a conspiracy begins to rid Marty and his friends
of Bobby and his abusive ways once and for all.</P>
<P>Larry Clark made splash for himself with his debut feature film, "Kids," an
unabashedly harsh look into the lives of a group of unthinking, selfish New
York City teens whose mission in life is to seek sex, drugs and trouble. It
was a hard film that looked, unblinkingly, at the ramifications of
promiscuity, unprotected sex and drug abuse in the AIDS era. If kids didn't
get the message, their parents sure couldn't miss it.</P>
<P>With "Bully," Clark changes his focus and locale and moves to Florida to
relate the account leading to the brutal group murder of Bobby Kent. Bobby,
raised in a normal-seeming family environment, has sociopath tendencies
that cause him to take violent action against his friend Marty for any
infraction, no matter how trivial. Marty, for years, has suffered under
this abusive friendship in a resigned, accepting way without striking back.
When timid Lisa falls for Marty, she can't stand to watch him succumb to
the tortures at Bobby's hands and soon convinces her none-too-bright
boyfriend that the best thing to do is to rid their lives of the bully.
Soon, others, like Ali (Bijou Phillips), a teen mother/sometimes prostitute
who also suffered abuse by Bobby, join the conspiracy and things get
totally out of control.</P>
<P>Enough about the story. What "Bully" is really about, in the hands of Larry
Clark, is a film that approaches soft-core pornography with a voyeur's look
at teen sex. It seems that fully half of the action shown in the film
involves young people screwing without concern for the consequences of
their libidinous actions. The inordinate amount of flesh-based antics among
the kids is geared to peeping tom status as Clark has his young actors
strip and have sex (I won't give the film credence by calling it "making
love"). There isn't much reason for all of the skin except to serve as
prurient titillation for the viewers.</P>
<P>"Bully" depicts a microcosm of our society of under-educated,
under-motivated, under-employed and over-sexed teenagers with too much free
time and, if Clark's assessment is correct, under-supervised by their
parents. Neither side comes across well in this tome of teen angst as the
kids wander around, without a clue, drinking, smoking dope and screwing
indiscriminately. The parents don't come across to well, either, being
shown as clueless, too, with their children operating beyond the pale of
any reasonable authority - they are kind of like juvenile versions of
Colonel Kurtz in "Apocalypse Now."</P>
<P>It's difficult to assess the acting of the various characters unless the
ability to perform simulated sex is considered thesping. Technical aspects,
too, are hard to judge since camera work is relegated to shooting the skin
of the young stars, with special attention given to shots of Bijou
Phillips's crotch - in close-up. The attention to sexual exploits pushes
the true story of murder into the background with the climax (no pun
intended) given the bum's rush in the end when all hell breaks loose and
the kids do in their nemesis, Bobby.</P>
<P>Larry Clark comes across more as a dirty old man and less a cutting edge
filmmaker with "Bully." I go to the movies to see a story unfold. If I want
to look at naked, sexy young women, I'll buy a copy of Playboy. I give it a
D.</P>
