<P>For the ignorant, 2000 may not have been the best year for film.  The
subtitled Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon destroyed records for both box
office take and Academy Award nominations.  Fellow Best Picture nominee
Traffic contains more than a few segments that feature non-English dialogue.
One could even argue that Chocolat, another Best Picture contender, should
have been filmed in French (it's not like Juliette Binoche is unfamiliar
with the language).  Some bewildered moviegoers have thrown up their hands
in frustration, saying things like, "I wanna see that there picture about
the flying lions and the ducking tigers, but the durn thing ain't in
American, Cletus."</P>
<P>Don't expect ol' Cletus to be in the ticket line with you for Place Vendôme
(unless inbreeding has suddenly created a race of hillbillies with a
fondness for subtle French noir).  The film was released over two years ago
in Europe, where it was a smash sensation, garnering star Catherine Deneuve
a Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival and racking up an
impressive 12 César nominations (the French equivalent of the Oscar).</P>
<P>Vendôme takes its name from a ritzy area in Paris known for being the home
of several of the world's most prestigious jewelry stores.  Deneuve (Dancer
in the Dark) plays Marianne, the alcoholic wife of one of Vendôme's biggest
diamond merchants.  Vincent (Bernard Fresson) accepts the fact that his wife
is a lush who spends most of her time in clinics, trotting her out in public
a few times each year for special occasions.</P>
<P>When the film opens, Vincent has, through some undetermined yet devious
means, obtained several large, valuable diamonds.  One night, he shows a
drunken Marianne the stones and their hiding place, and then kills himself
the following day.  She learns that their jewelry store is on the verge of
bankruptcy and that Vincent has been having an affair with a woman (The
Ninth Gate's Emmanuelle Seigner) who could be a younger version of Marianne
(literally, in one flashback).</P>
<P>The rest of Vendôme shows Marianne pulling herself together to use the
illicitly obtained jewels to free herself from the shady underworld of
international diamond trading.  She's kind of like the Catherine Zeta-Jones
character in Traffic, doing what she has to do to protect her own future, no
matter how crooked or underhanded.  Marianne uses old contacts and ex-lovers
to weave her way through the rough jewelry trade racket - a game in which
everyone's goal is to out-con each other.  Reputable dealers won't touch
Marianne's booty, leaving her to deal with seedy characters in hotel rooms.</P>
<P>Vendôme isn't a typical film about stolen jewels.  There isn't a lick of
action, and its slow, methodical pace may frighten off those who weren't
already scared by the subtitles.  Like any deliberately sluggish film that's
worth watching, Vendôme is held together by the very strong performance of
its star.  Sure, I'd probably watch Deneuve read a phonebook for two hours,
but France's national treasure is terrific in her subtly restrained and
underplayed role.  Not a lot of people could have pulled it off, but she
does, and, as always, with style.</P>
<P>Vendôme was written and directed by French actress Nicole Garcia, who penned
the script with Jacques Fieschi (The School of Flesh).  Film buffs may
notice that Fresson and Deneuve also played husband and wife 30 years ago in
Bunuel's Belle de Jour.</P>
