<PRE>.                            TWENTYFOURSEVEN
                      A film review by Bradley Null
                       Copyright 1998 Bradley Null</PRE>
<P>The first thing that hit me about "TwentyFourSeven" was the starkness of the
black and white film and the bareness of the sets. That combined with the
film's slow pacing and simple plot make the first half of the film feel very
long.
     At the center of "TwentyFourSeven" is Bob Hoskins as Darcy, a
middle-aged man from a relatively rural area in England. Although not an
obvious leader, Darcy finds the motivation within himself to open a boxing
club for the local youth. It is his impression that this club, like the one
he had as a teen, will restore camaraderie and pride to the troubled lads.
     With its simple no-budget look, the film seems to have little going for
it on first glance. The often documentary-type camera movements,
intermittent jump cuts, and sometimes peculiar shooting angles could
contribute to an impression that first time feature film director Shane
Meadows is not quite ready for such a large scale project.       Around the
middle of the film though, we begin to see what Meadows is trying to show
us. His film is not an epic.  It is a character study of a small town and
how one man in that town tries to deal with its problems.
     With little plot to concern him, Meadows prefers to dwell on character
development and how the relationships between Darcy and the lads develop.
The lack of production values, the slow pacing, and the leisurely plot allow
Meadows to dwell exclusively on these relationships without distracting the
audience.
     Ironically, the film's major flaw may be that it spends too much time
chronicling the rise and fall of Hoskins' Darcy, and not enough time letting
us get to know the other characters. The plot is inconsequential. The power
of the movie comes in how it paints for us a scene of a society and a people
we have never met, yet after 100 minutes come to feel intimately familiar
with.
     "TwentyFourSeven" is a strong character picture, and could not have
succeeded without excellent performances by Hoskins, in his most complex
role yet, and a strong supporting cast of relative newcomers led by Danny
Nussbaum as Tim.
     Meadows substitutes passion and energy for his lack of experience in
making this film.  In the end, he gives us a telling view of his own youth.</P>
