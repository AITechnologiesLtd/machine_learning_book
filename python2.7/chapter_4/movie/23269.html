Review of DICK.</PRE>
<P>Dick, starring Michelle Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Dan Hedaya, Will Ferrell,
Bruce McCulloch, Dave Foley, Jim Breuer and Ana Gasteyer.  Directed by Andrew
Fleming.  1999.</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by John Carroll.</PRE>
<P>   With the supposed "teen revolution" hitting movie screens everywhere, it is
a shame that such trash as Drive Me Crazy is overshadowing and outgrossing
sharp and witty films such as Dick.  While the premise is a little crazy, Dick
is able to keep its audience laughing through a strong supporting cast that
looks a lot like a Lorne Michaels reunion.</P>
<P>   The two lead roles go to Michelle Williams of TV's popular Dawson's Creek
and Kirsten Dunst, who has recieved raves from such films as Drop Dead Gorgeous
and also her guest role in NBC's ER.  Williams plays Arlene, a ditsy 15 year
old high schooler.  Dunst, not to be outdone, plays an equally ditsy high
schooler by the name of Betsy.  The film takes place during the presidency of
Richard Nixon, in the 1970s.  Arlene and Betsy start off as two outsiders in a
disco world, but slowly evolve.  Unfortunately, as their characters evolve,
they get less and less funny.  Luckily, Lorne Michaels's graudates step in to
carry the load.</P>
<P>   Lorne's reunion in Dick includes current Saturday Night Live stars (Will
Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer), past SNL stars (Jim Breuer, Harry Shearer) and the
stars of Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy (Dave Foley, Bruce McCulloch).  These
cast members provide the slick and slightly irreverent humor that fuels Dick,
especially when Dunst's and Williams's characters lose the charm and hilarity
that they possessed at the beginning of the film.</P>
<P>   Dick starts off fast and furious.  Despite the old "dumb blonde" cliche,
Dick capitalizes on the sheer stupidity of the two main characters, Betsy and
Arlene.  They get their chance to meet Preisdent Nixon when they accidentally
see a confidential list of Nixon paying off certain high office politicians. 
They become "official White House dog walkers."  Plain and stupid comedy like
this is a constant throughout the first half of Dick, and it works due to the
irresistible charm of the lead characters.  Dick never goes political, except
for one funny sequence cocnerning Nixon's thoughts on the war.</P>
<P>   As Dick progresses, however, Andrew Fleming (who directed and wrote the
screenplay) puts his two main characters under metamorphasis.  They hear
Nixon's racial remarks and decide to not put up with it anymore.  While this
may seem like the right thing to do character-wise, it leaves an empty space in
this film because Fleming seems to forget he is directing a comedy.  Enter Will
Ferrell and Bruce McCulloch.</P>
<P>   Ferrell and McCulloch play Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the Washington
Post reporters who originally broke the Watergate scandal.  While not as funny
as Dunst and Williams originally were, Ferrell and McCulloch are able to
suffice for the rest of the film.  Dan Hedaya, who portrays President Nixon to
a dime, gives a strong performance throughout the film.  Fleming seemed to have
trouble transitioning his characters from good to bad (or vice versa), all
except for Nixon, which is why Hedaya is able to give such a strong
performance.  He moves from the mischievous Nixon, trying to cover up
everything, to a paranoid president looking out for every Tom, Dick and Harry
coming his way.  Hedaya's presence is welcome, and such a versatile actor is
very beneficial to such a young cast.</P>
<P>   Dick, overall, is a decent comedy.  The cast is picture-perfect, whether it
be the Lorne Michaels crew pitching in their efforts, or the young duo of
Williams and Dunst portraying their ditsy, out-of-touch 70s high schoolers. 
Dan Hedaya steals the show as Nixon, and had Fleming been able to keep his
characters the same, or transition them better, Dick could have been as great
as 1999's other comedy studs, Bowfinger and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me.</P>
<P>Final Verdict: B-
