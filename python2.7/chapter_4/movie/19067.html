<P>As the overture commences, we are presented with a sequence of monochrome
still photographs, of a theatre musical director waving his baton; of scenes
in a recording studio, with the principals, chorus , conductor, a large
orchestra, surrounded by microphones, booms and other equipment; of scenes
in the theatre dressing rooms as the principals and other performers the
actors preparing for the night's performance, applying their custumes and
make up, with a particular emphasis on Tony Tanner's transformation from
almost unrecognisable everyday self to the white faced clown Littlechap. At
the end of the credits, the image switches to orange hued Technicolor and
movement, and the performance begins................with a mime sequence.</P>
<P>>From the very beginning therefore, theatricality is emphasised. We are
to see a PERFORMANCE It is Brechtian, in the sense that one is never
allowed to forger the PROCESS of production. There are various
'alienation' devices to comment on the action, and prevent the viewer
getting too involved in the story: the film is on several occasions
interrupted when Littlechap shouts 'Stop the World! , and he launches
into a monologue to camera which returns to Black and White. The film
also shows us shots from the stage, of a theatre audience applauding
after some songs, and shots of the conductor in the pit.  The essence
of the appeal of STW is theatrical, a real challenge (if not
impossible) to turn into a film, and the film's producers have wisely
avoided all attempts at naturalism.....</P>
<P>Here we have what is basically a filmed record of a stage production, so
one's response to the film depends entirely on one's response to the show,
and the performers. Promoted in London and New York as a 'new style musical'
with a 'new style entertainer' (Anthony Newley) in 1961, STW was a
considerable stage success. It is a young man's show, and , in mood, a
typically early 1960s piece which seems rather 'quaint' by today's
standards. It caught the mood of the time with its comments on social class
and politics, and (some would say, banal) attempts to make a statement on
'the human condition'. At a time when audiences were willing to accept
experiment in the arts [including theatre(Beckett) and movies Godard)], it
had some of this sense of 'experiment'. A musical with very little
narrative, especially by todays standards ('Cats', also a mime show is its
nearest equivalent, but is much cosier and less challenging).
In STW one can see the influence of Charlie Chaplin on Newley and on the
production (especially 'Modern Times' - the images of the depersonalising
effect of machinery, skillfully portrayed in mime by the dancers). The film
also reflections certain 1960s notions of 'Art'. It opens with a very
stylised mime routine, revealing the influence of the French mime artist
Marcel Marceau, with Littlechap's clown costume and white face make up. A
circus ring setting is suggested in Sean Kenny's design.</P>
<P>The central character Littlechap is an Everyman figure, with roots going
back to medieval theatre, but also an 'antihero' (another very 1960s term
!), a 'little Englander' and a 'chauvinist' in his relations with Evie and
his daughters. (there are also 21 pretty girl dancers in the film, who have
an important role in the film - they act as a chorus, and comment on the
action, both visually in mime, and in words). The satire is at a pretty
shallow level, however. The role of Littlechap is a tour de force for the
leading actor, placing heavy physical and vocal demands on the performer,
who is never off the stage. The film 'Introduces' Tony Tanner (but this was
not his first film - he appeared in 'Strictly For The Birds' in 1963).
Tanner followed Newley in both the London and New York stage productions,
and replicates Anthony Newley's performance, including his vocal mannerisms.
Personally, although he gives a skilful performance in a very demanding
role, I found Tony Tanner overbearing and very irritating after a while, and
if one finds Littlechap tiresome, the show loses a lot of its appeal.
As a show STW had many admirers, especially Sammy Davis Jr. who recognised
the quality of its songs and appeared in it more than once, and adopted
several of its songs. Certainly, nobody could complain about the quality of
the songs in this show. With several excellent numbers [with powerful ('What
Kind of Fool am I?') and tender ('Someone Nice Like You Evie' songs], it is
one of the best scores of the period (from any source), and together with
'Oliver' is one of the great British musicals of the 1960s. Other songs
include: 'The ABC Song'(TT), 'I Wanna Be Rich' (TT), 'Typically
English[Deutsche/Russian/Japanese/All American]' (MM), 'Lumbered' (TT),
'Gonna Build a Mountain'(TT), 'Meilinki Meilchick' (TT/MM), 'Mumbo
Jumbo'(TT), and 'Once in a Lifetime'(TT).</P>
<P>Also both Newley and Bricusse deserve credit for the boldness of the
concept- a concept musical before the term became fashionable, it is only
preced by the Weill/Gershwin 'Lady in the Dark' and Rodger's and
Hammerstein' s 'Allegro' in its originality. Unfortunately, what was new and
'fresh' in the 1960s was bound to date quickly, and the show, far from being
timeless and universal, subsequently proved to be unrevivable, as various
short-lived attempts since the 1960s have shown.</P>
<P>This film attempts to capture the experience of live theatre. As this is an
impossible task, one has to give the producers credit for attempting to
place the show on record, although the film is fatally flawded by not having
Anthony Newley in the leading role. Whether Newley's non appearance was due
to contractual disagreements, or because he was appearing on Broadway in
another show, is not certain (if the latter, why wasn't the production of
this film moved to New York to accommodate Anthony Newley's other
committments?). It was crazy to proceed with a film of 'Stop The World'
without Anthony Newley on board.</P>
<P>The experience of seeing 'Stop The World' live in the theatre in 1961 ,with
the show's creator/performer, Anthony Newley on a good night, and in top
form, in 1961 must have been electrifying. Love it or loathe it, this film
is a poor substitute, but let's be grateful - it is all we have as a visual
record of this show..</P>
