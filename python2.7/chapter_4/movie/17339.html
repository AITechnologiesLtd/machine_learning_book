Reviewed March 20, 1999.</P>
<P>"Ravenous," the new horror film directed by Antonia Bird (1995's 
"Priest," "Mad Love"), is one of the most unsettling motion pictures I 
have seen. Although far from perfect, when the end credits began to 
roll, I physically felt sick in my stomach, not to mention surprisingly 
disturbed, at what I had just watched. Rarely does this ever happen, at 
least to me, anyway.</P>
<P>Set during the Mexican-American War and obviously obtaining much of its 
story ideas from the true account of the infamous Donner party, the film 
begins as Captain John Boyd (Guy Pearce) has sat down to eat with his 
comrades and, thinking back to his horrific experiences previously in 
the war (mistaken as a dead body, he was buried under the blood-drenched 
remains of his fellow soldiers), he runs out to throw up after 
witnessing everyone around him eating rare, very rare, meat. Immediately 
afterwards, Boyd is sent to stay at an outpost in the snowy Sierra 
Nevada mountains, where he meets a wide array of eccentrics: the 
commanding officer, Hart (Jeffrey Jones); Cleaves (David Arquette), the 
goofy, drug-addled cook; and Toffler (Jeremy Davies), a religious, young 
recruit, among others. Just as Boyd is starting to become acquainted 
with his new surroundings, everything ultimately changes when they come 
across a mysterious and bearded, nearly frozen man named Colqhoun 
(Robert Carlyle), who tells them of the pioneers he had been with who 
became stranded in a cave when winter arrived and, when worse finally 
came to worse, they ended up murdering and eating each other for food. 
Colqhoun claims he is the only one to have escaped the clutches of the 
maddest man there, Ives, so all of the men trek back to the cave to 
investigate the goings-on there. </P>
<P>Although this is only the basic set-up, it's decidedly best not to give 
away any more of the plot developments since "Ravenous" is a film that 
wins many of its brownie points for the high quotient of surprises that 
proceed this opening. Not only that, but "Ravenous" is a true example of 
a film that stands as a perfect moniker for the saying, "style over 
substance." There wasn't a second to be had that I wasn't completely 
impressed by the film's technical areas, many of which added to the fact 
that this is certainly one of the more frightening films to come along 
in some time (certainly more effective, overall, than the recent teen 
slasher movies we have recently been bombarded with). Scene after scene 
arrived from the half-hour point on that was almost nerve-rattlingly 
suspenseful, thanks, in part, to the bravura, remarkably eerie and 
complex music score composed by Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn. Even 
though it is only March, there is no doubt in my mind that this score 
will go down as one of the five best of the year, and it would be 
criminal for the Academy to overlook it. Also adding to the picture's 
potency is the chilly, atmospheric cinematography by Anthony B. 
Richmond, and the tight, captivating editing by Neil Farrell.</P>
<P>So far, however, the main elements that the film brings up have not been 
discussed, and that includes the overwhelming themes of cannibalism, 
which then can easily be linked to vampirism. If "Ravenous" had not 
dealt with this idea is a straight-forward manner, it, no doubt, would 
have ended up seeming like a cop-out. Instead, the film is filled with 
extreme violence and unimaginable gore, even for an R-rating, and it 
should be stressed that those people who are easily grossed-out should 
not, under any circumstances, torture themselves with this film. Even I, 
who almost always remains unaffected by the visceral experiece of a 
film, found myself often shrinking down in my seat, afraid to see what 
was going to happen next, but not daring to take my eyes off the screen, 
either. </P>
<P>The cast in "Ravenous" is filled with an equal measure of those actors 
who are recognizable and those that are less so. The supporting 
characters, headed by Arquette and Davies, are highly underused and have 
very little to work with, but they do their jobs professionally and 
disappear rather (and unpredictably) quickly. The main characters fare 
better and are more memorable, as Pearce, following his role in 1997's 
"L.A. Confidential," stands as a sympathetic, if not purely "good," 
protagonist, while Carlyle (1997's "The Full Monty") comes off as one of 
the more believably nasty and dispicable villains to grace the silver 
screen in a while. Meanwhile, Jones, an underused actor who has one 
classic performance to his name, in 1986's "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," 
is thankfully handed a rare meaty role to sink his teeth into (pardon 
the pun).</P>
<P>All of the technical expertise and professional performers, not to 
mention director Bird, who obviously understands how to make a powerful 
genre piece, work together to make "Ravenous" a stirring experience that 
will not easilty be forgotten. Sure, the film feels like more of an 
exercise in terror (with noticably dark, pitch-black humor) than a 
three-dimensional movie, but why should that be a problem? With all 
things considered, "Ravenous" is definately worthy of being looked upon 
as the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" of the '90s.</P>
