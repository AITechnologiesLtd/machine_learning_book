The Emperor's New Groove</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>"This story is about Me! ... I was a really nice guy and they ruined me 
for no reason," David Spade begins his reign over this Disney film from 
the get-go and never lets go. </P>
<P>Changed into a llama by Yzma, his wicked Grinchy-looking advisor, the 
emperor is forced to come to terms with his total lack of heart. In 
stark contrast, John Goodman, as the big-hearted Pacha, makes an 
unlikely partner in the emperor's attempt to reclaim the thrown. </P>
<P>Hey, this is a really funny movie! (And I'm a few years older than five) 
Spade's wry, dry, whiny, biting edge vibrates against the expected 
smooth gloss of Disney paint ... it'll set your funny bone resonating. </P>
<P>Kudos to the director, editor, and screenwriter as well, though Spade is 
definitely the star of this show (as Carrey in the Grinch); this film 
still packs plenty of well-timed physical humor and a healthy supply of 
delightful one-liners from other characters. </P>
<P>Kronk, Yzma's kid-spirited sensitive-male thug, delivers a host of juicy 
gags. Yzma orders, "Kronk, break down that door!"
Kronk narrow's his eyes, "What? Are you kidding? That's hand-carved 
mahogany." </P>
<P>A nervous villager stands before Yzma.
Yzma barks, "It's no concern of mine that your family doesn't have ... 
what was it again ... food?"
The villager mutters something inaudible.
Yzma finishes, "Yes, well you really should have thought about that 
before you became a peasant." </P>
<P>Toward making Emperor Kuzco even more vain (and since the story is told 
by him), other character's dialogue sort of blurs into blah blah as they 
fall victim to his short attention span and gross lack of empathy. A 
very nice touch. And then as a Llama, Kuzco stumbles clumsily around on 
his new hoofs -- strong creative insight to thicken this already rich 
character. </P>
<P>The film's only flaws are consolidated into one unfunny jungle 
restaurant scene that plays like a bad 1960's sit-com. It's an ugly 
blemish that is soon enough over and done with. </P>
<P>In sum, the emperor's jaded, Spaded, jagged-edge of vanity cuts a sharp 
b-line to the jugular. Though small tikes may miss some of these satiric 
nuances, the film still stocks a powerful momentum. At about an hour 
fifteen, it's smaller in length while decidedly passing on the usual 
Disney animation grandeur (not a one character ever breaks into song); 
still this is a pretty darned fun and funnier film. </P>
