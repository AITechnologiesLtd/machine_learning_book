<P>Ever seen 1970's "Love Story," where Ryan O'Neal had to come to terms with 
his love, and the impending death, of the sickly Ali McGraw? How about last 
spring's "Here on Earth," in which Chris Klein was forced to cope with Leelee 
Sobieski's bout with cancer? Joan Chen's "Autumn in New York" is yet another 
in a growing trend of romantic weepies, in which two people fall 
head-over-heels in love, but find themselves being torn apart by one of their 
inevitable deaths to a token, movie-style illness. Despite MGM's decision to 
not screen the picture for review for critics, which causes much controversy 
and talk in Hollywood about how bad it must be, it's with at least partial 
happiness to report that it really isn't that awful. In fact, "Autumn in New 
York" isn't bad at all, and while much of the film simply doesn't work based 
on its worn-out plot mechanics and extremely uneven screenplay by Allison 
Burnett, the actors manage to raise the film up a notch from being a disaster 
to merely a passable, flawed time-waster.</P>
<P>Will (Richard Gere) is a womanizing 49-year-old restauranteur who catches a 
glimpse of the angelic Charlotte (Winona Ryder) celebrating her 22nd birthday 
with some friends at his restaurant. Their eyes meet, and after a brief 
meeting, he can't get her out of his mind, despite the sizable age 
difference. Following an invite to a high-profile gala and a wonderful night 
together, a romance ensues between the two, although Will is quick to point 
out to the poetry-loving, child-like Charlotte that "the only thing I can 
offer you is this--right now." Ah, but Charlotte's got a secret which she 
quickly divulges to him so "there will be no chance for confusion later on." 
Charlotte's got a rare heart problem, and she has very little time left to 
live. So as their love blossoms further, and her time on Earth grows shorter 
by the day, Will becomes determined to find a possible surgery that will cure 
her, or at the very least, prolong the inevitable.</P>
<P>It honestly isn't giving anything away to say that Charlotte is dying, 
because not only do the televisions ads hint around the subject, but it is 
revealed no more than thirty minutes into the film. The decision to uncover 
Charlotte's "secret" so early on is one of the film's problems, because since 
Will now knows about her illness, all scenes between the two revolve strictly 
around their noticeable age difference and/or her heart problem, and little 
time is spent actually getting to know the characters. Relatedly, when 
Charlotte first announces she is sick, the rest of the picture becomes 
effortless to telegraph in advance, so for the remainder of the film all you 
can do is sit and wait for the climactic death bed sequence.</P>
<P>Richard Gere and Winona Ryder are lovely together, and it is their hefty 
acting chops that manage to carry us through the story, predictable as it is. 
Gere's Will is an earnest man who, nevertheless, has a wandering eye and an 
unfaithful sexual prowess, despite his love for Charlotte. In essence, she 
helps him become a better man so that, when she finally slips away, he will 
be able to eventually find a loving, committed relationship with someone 
else. Ryder's Charlotte is a sweet-natured, idealistic soul with just enough 
quirks to become the most original and interesting character in the film. The 
28-year-old Ryder has always been a radiant actress, and she handles her role 
with just the right amount of caring and wide-eyed innocence that makes her 
fully believable as a 22-year-old.</P>
<P>As written by screenwriter Burnett, the supporting cast is disappointingly 
developed and leave either no impression or just enough that it makes you 
wish they were around for more than a scene or two. The one exception is 
Elaine Stritch, both humorously biting and touching as Charlotte's 
grandmother, whom she lives with. The rest of the actors aren't given the 
chance to do much, and they cause the entire movie to rest upon the shoulders 
of Ryder and Gere, who seem oddly shut off from the rest of the world because 
of this problem.</P>
<P>Like all romantic film weepies, director Joan Chen wants nothing more than to 
pluck the heartstrings of the audience, but somehow, as the cards stack up 
more and more against the fate of Charlotte, the movie progressively grows 
ineffectual, and the final scene between Will and Charlotte is ham-handed and 
oddly indifferent.</P>
<P>"Autumn in New York" is a respectable enough love story that holds so much 
promise, yet doesn't seem to have had the screenplay kinks worked out before 
shooting commenced. If anything, the lush cinematography by Changwei Gu is 
resplendent, lovingly painting Manhattan with a fury of beautiful autumn 
leaves and marvelously colorful landscapes. If I didn't know any better, I'd 
think this is what Woody Allen's black-and-white "Manhattan" would have 
looked like had it been in color. It's just too bad the particulars of the 
film itself don't even come close to matching that one-of-a-kind 1979 
masterpiece.</P>
