<PRE>                             THE CROSSING GUARD
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>(1995) **</PRE>
<P>        Why did Sean Penn cross the road? I don't know and I don't 
care. My question is more along the lines of why Sean Penn devoted 
so much of his energy to scripting and directing this thriller whose 
only action scenes are at the beginning and end with a whole lot of 
boring melodrama in between. I don't know if you'll take my word 
for it, though, because from the video box it looks like a promising 
movie. Jack Nicholson plays the father of a murder victim who's 
been counting off the days to the killer's release from prison, when 
he'll exact his revenge, most likely in the eye-for-an-eye manner 
by killing the killer.</P>
<P>        But we know from the beginning that Jack ain't such a 
smart guy. He marches into the home of his ex-wife (Anjelica 
Huston), who was his wife at the time of the murder, and announces 
his plans to kill the murderer. Huston and Nicholson have had this 
discussion over and over (and will have many more before the 
fade-to-credits) and it's obvious Nicholson is a disturbed man 
who intends to go through with his plans, but Huston doesn't 
tip off the police, even after Nicholson gets in a fistfight with 
her new husband.</P>
<P>        So the murderer, played by David Morse of "St. Elsewhere" 
and 12 MONKEYS, gets out of prison and returns home to his loving 
parents. By this point we know something's wrong -- Nicholson is 
much more of a menace to society than Morse. That night Nicholson 
sneaks into Morse's bedroom while he's sleeping and points a gun at 
him before realizing there are no bullets. Morse wakes up and 
begins a casual conversation with him ("Oh hi, Jack. Come to kill 
me again?"), fully aware of Nicholson's plan to kill him. Everyone 
in this movie knows what Nicholson is up to but no one tries to 
stop him. All Morse does is ask for three days to live out his life 
before Nicholson claims it.</P>
<P>        Nicholson grants him the three days, beginning a long, 
no-action stretch of movie in which Morse falls in love with Robin 
"Jen-ny" Wright (you almost expect Forrest Gump to start stalking 
him too) and Nicholson spends most of his time at a strip club and 
lays at least ten separate women. This guy gets more action than 
James Bond, but unfortunately THE CROSSING GUARD has none 
of the action of a Bond film. That hour or so in the middle serves 
mostly to show us Morse is human after all, with a lot of remorse 
for what he did, and that Nicholson is nuts after all, which we 
know before the opening credits are even up.</P>
<P>        Even the climax is dull, beginning with Nicholson being 
pulled over by the cops. He runs off into the woods, leading them 
on a chase, before somehow ending up at the home of Morse. Then 
they both run down the street for awhile, take a bus, run some more, 
climb a fence or two -- mostly in slow motion. When even the action 
scenes are boring, there's a problem. And when there's at least thirty 
minutes of painfully-slow, superfluous drama, including Wright's 
interpretive dance of Salt-N-Pepa's "Whatta Man," there are a 
_lot_ of problems.</P>
<P>        Penn's message that the guilty are still able to feel remorse, 
to love and be loved, was later personified by Penn himself in DEAD 
MAN WALKING, which had genuine drama and none of the 
contrived action. The fault for THE CROSSING GUARD rests 
squarely on his shoulders. Lord knows Nicholson and Huston are 
wonderful actors, but when given crap, they can hardly rise above 
it. It may be high-quality crap, but it's still crap, a dead movie barely
crawling.</P>
