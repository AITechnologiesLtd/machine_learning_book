<PRE>SPECIES (1995) 
A Film Review 
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001 </PRE>
<P>By mid 1990s the author of this review has learned not to 
expect much from Hollywood blockbusters. However, despite 
those bitter experiences, disappointments still happen, 
because, sometimes, you simply want certain film to be good. 
Seeing complete lack of truly memorable science fiction 
films in this particular period, I was hoping that SPECIES, 
directed by Roger Donaldson in 1995, might be it. </P>
<P>The plot begins rather promising - sometimes between early 
1970s and early 1990s an alien civilisation has caught 
signals from Earth. As a result, SETI radio telescopes 
receive transmission with details of alien DNA and 
instructions to splice it with its human counterpart. 
Government scientist follow the instructions, but the 
resulting hybrid, girl named "Sil" grows too rapidly and the 
project leader Xavier Fitch (played by Ben Kingsley) decides 
to pull the plug. Little girl, however, doesn't like idea of 
being gassed to death so she uses her superhuman abilities 
to escape from the secret laboratory. In order to catch her, 
Fitch gathers a small team of two scientists, an empath and 
professional assassin. In the meantime, little "Sil" 
transforms into adult and gorgeous looking woman (played by 
Natasha Henstridge) and slowly discovers her genetically 
programmed mission is to procreate and settle this planet 
with as much of alien hybrids as possible. She comes to Los 
Angeles where her looks could serve her well in her mission, 
while the scientific team races with time in order to find 
her. </P>
<P>The premise of SPECIES looked like a really promising 
combination of Ridley Scott's ALIEN and Paul Schrader's CAT 
PEOPLE. Even more promising was really interesting cast of 
gifted actors led by "Oscar"-winning Ben Kingsley, as well 
as Swiss conceptual artist H.R. Giger (of ALIEN fame) as the 
designer of "Sil's" alien shape. Unfortunately, the script 
by Dennis Feldman quickly abandoned all interesting 
opportunities contained in its premise (including the human 
civilisation being seen through alien eyes). Instead, 
SPECIES quickly disintegrates into the series of plot holes 
and cliches (including the obligatory and not so plausible 
romance between the members of retrieving team) that 
culminate with the cheap ending more suitable for B-horrors 
than an ambitious science fiction film. Although director 
Roger Donaldson tries his best to fill inadequacies of 
script by nice visuals, his efforts are in vain, partly due 
to rather disinterested cast that fail to create any sort of 
interest for their cardboard characters. The only exception 
and probably the only potentially redeeming thing in this 
film is 20-year old Canadian supermodel Natasha Henstridge 
in her first major film role. She tries her best to give 
some sort of character to the shape-shifting alien monster, 
but the audience, especially male, would probably remember 
only those scenes in which she appears without clothes. 
Unfortunately, those scenes are only a tiny portion of 
SPECIES and not the reason enough to waste almost two hours 
of precious time watching this Hollywood garbage. </P>
