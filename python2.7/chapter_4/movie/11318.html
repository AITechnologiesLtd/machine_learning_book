<PRE>The Craft
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Four teenage girls at a Los Angeles Catholic high school who have ample
reasons to hate the world (even beyond the fact that they are teenagers)
attempt to solve their problems by becoming witches -- with disastrous results.</P>
<P>As the result of a Wiccan advisor, the film has about as much accuracy in the
area of witchcraft as you could hope for in the midst of a quasi-horror movie
from an effects-happy Hollywood. Some of the rituals and concepts come
directly from the modern neo-pagan religions, but then the special effects
blow it all away into science fiction land. It's as if a scene in a film about
Christianity featured a priest performing a baptism with a flood of water
flowing from his fingers and lightning bolts shooting from his eyes.</P>
<P>Films featuring religion as the center point have always been a difficulty 
for mainstream studios, especially belief systems that are seen as The Other.
The easy approach is to grab the most exotic and sensational aspects and go
with them: Moslems as Jihad warriors, Hindus as fakirs, witches as
power-hungry spell-casters. At least there is none of the usual miscasting of
witches as Satan worshipers.</P>
<P>This story does capture the teen fascination with magick as a means to their
ends. A couple of the universal truths of adolescence are feelings of
powerlessness and a dissatisfaction with the cultural status quo. Magick is
seen as a cure for both. Empowerment in a way sure to piss off the parents.
When the girls perform a ritual to evoke a powerful spirit, they are in true
form: over their heads with precision in their act but no grounding in theology.</P>
<P>When one of the young witches realizes that things are falling apart (a slow
learner, she catches on after several deaths and her coven-mates begin
attacking her), she goes to an older witch for help. The elder practitioner
gives her a few hints, but our young friend runs away before she can help much.</P>
<P>The movie especially falls apart towards the end. One of the three "bad"
witchs seems to see the error of using magick to control others and then
suddenly she's back in the role of "evil"  without explaination. The tale
moral appears to be one of the main Wiccan beliefs: what you put out, you get
back threefold – the witch's version of the Golden Rule. The good little witch
supposedly believes that and uses it to defeat her opponents, but the last
scene shows her using her powers in an act of vengeance to scare and warn her
former friends.</P>
<P>As a horror film aimed at the younger set, this is nothing amazing, but does
stand a chance of becoming a cult (no pun intended) classic. It topped the box
office list during its first weekend in release. Checking out the pagan
newsgroups on the internet, the Wiccan opinion seems to be "It's not as bad as
we feared."</P>
