<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An ambitious 28-year-old public relations executive in Chicago finds
herself knee deep in blackmail, deception, and murder. Allie Brayman
(Elizabeth Berkley) has just been informed by the new owner, Avery Shaw,
of the PR firm she works for, Vasco, that she is slated to take over
running the company from her mentor Blake Preston (Barry). He is taking
an early retirement, as the new owner is demanding certain changes in
restructuring the firm.</P>
<P>This thriller is directed by Doug Jackson; it will best explore the
fast-paced business world and its sterile atmosphere, where not telling
the truth or stretching the truth in different ways is the norm. It
succeeds in capturing that frenetic yuppie need for material things and
how that greed blinds the quality of life. But what it fails to do, is
build a mystery that goes beyond what could be read in the newspapers.
You get a few spine tingling moments out of the heroine's self-made
misfortunes and a surprise twist in the ending, but you don't get a
lasting sense that this isn't all manufactured tension to fit too neatly
into its premise of how anyone can be a victim of a random act of
violence and have their life put through the ringer.</P>
<P>The film opens with a Japanese family of three arriving in Los Angeles
and renting a car. They are soon gunned down by an assassin for no
particular reason. Allie, as the spin doctor for the rental firm, makes
the best of that situation, giving out newspaper reports that take the
blame away from the rental car agency, as she reassures the public that
it is still safe to rent a car from them: that the murders were random
acts.</P>
<P>We next see this ideal go-getter, workaholic, gorgeous nice girl,
relating well with her co-workers and being the best daughter parents
could have, except as the mother says,
she should be married by now.</P>
<P>Asked to arrange a party for the firm, she puts together a novel idea of
having one in the Chicago train yards. Among all the familiar guests, is
a stranger who keeps looking at her. Encouraged by her friends to talk
to the handsome stranger, they finally get together over a drink. He
introduces himself as Carl Jones (Joel), telling her he is an ivy league
graduate and a lawyer who is now into business ventures. The two
"yuppie" appearing romantics get off on a materialistic conversation.
His most revealing comment is, "I love to surround myself with beautiful
things. I love beautiful women, smart, and powerful women."The ideal
girl seems to get aroused by this banal materialistic conversation,
enough to go back with the young man to his Lake Forest mansion.</P>
<P>In the middle of getting it on, he is attacked by a lady with a knife.
Allie reacting with fear that Carl will be killed suddenly hits the
attacker over the head with a vase, which kills her. Her immediate
response is to call the police, but he talks her out of it. He plays
with her fears that the cops wouldn't believe her and all the adverse
publicity in the newspapers would ruin her career. She buys into this,
putting her ambitions above the truth, as she follows his plans to put
the dead body in the car and have her car go off the side of the road to
look like an accident.</P>
<P>The next day at work, she finds out that the lady owned the mansion they
were in, and she was a future client of the firm, someone who had an
alcohol and drug problem, and also was known to have been seeing a
younger lover. Things start to get tight for her as a police homicide
detective, Royko (Schorpion), comes to her office to question her as a
witness. He says the gas attendant took down the license plates of her
car near the scene of the so-called accident. All the cop wants to know
is, what she saw and what was she doing around there at that time, and
if she was alone. She manages to tell him complete lies and digs herself
into a deep hole.</P>
<P>Upon further contact with Carl, she becomes suspicious of who he is and
is able to get into the cheap hotel room he lives in and go through his
meagre belongings. She also finds a card in his wallet that says he's a
parolee with the first name of Kyle. She later finds out he was in
prison for murder.</P>
<P>The film became difficult to watch from here on. Its chills revolved
around the danger she was in from this psychopath, from the police
suspecting foul play in the rich lady's death and that she might be
involved in it, and how she was having a tough time balancing these
personal problems with dealing with her increasingly tense job
situation. She is affected that her new client's wife was the victim,
but she is more concerned with protecting her career than anything else.
It was hard too warm up to her plight, though it was remotely possible
to see how she got into this messy situation.</P>
<P>The script was too thin and had to be padded with too many non-involving
scenes. It took this bright young executive way too long to realize that
she had been set-up. It also became hard to root for her because of that
chink in her personality, which showed character wise, that this
corporation executive was almost as unethical as the criminal.</P>
<P>The film annoyed me more than it enlightened or entertained me. There
didn't seem anything special about the acting and too many of the
secondary characters were put in there as props to echo the director's
point he was making of greed influencing corporate decisions. It didn't
have the suspense of a Hitchcock film, instead it had more the look of a
second-rate movie made for TV, which could be entertaining for a late
night audience that is not that demanding.</P>
