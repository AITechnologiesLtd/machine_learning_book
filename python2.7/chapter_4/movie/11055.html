<PRE>STRIPTEASE …… BRIT STYLE!</PRE>
<P>Trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of
the semi-dramatic THE COMMITMENTS and the nearly slapstick A FISH CALLED
WANDA, THE FULL MONTY is one film which delivered the depth of the former
and the humour magnitude of the latter. The film opens with a narrated
documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of
Sheffield in the 60's, then cut to the harsh reality of the present.
Sheffield has become some sort of a semi-slum with the only visible
increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel-factories; a once
flourishing industry.</P>
<P>Gaz (Carlyle) spends most of his time in the Worker's Club, a sort of place
where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers. He and his `plump'
friend Dave (Addy) as well as their former foreman Gerald (Wilkinson) have
been sitting around the club for months without any `call for duty'. What
seemingly was just a passing hard time for Gaz suddenly transformed itself
into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child-support
money to his ex-wife. Suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of
losing custody of his son, he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild-idea
to get the money he desperately requires. </P>
<P>Dave and Gerald too have problems of their own. On top of his lack of
employment, Dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him
because of his current financial state as well as his`plump' appearance
while Gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his
layoff for as long as 6 months, leaving home for `work' when he was
actually a long-standing member of the Worker's Club. There we have it;
people with real problems and a not-so-practical solution for them. Gaz
manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a
few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag : to perform a strip-act
at the local pub. In Gaz's own words while looking at an add for a
strip-act featuring hunky `beautiful' men, `If women are willing to pay for
this, they sure as well will pay for REAL-men'.</P>
<P>THE FULL MONTY is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all.
It is a small film which delves in the harsh-reality of unemployment and
the desperation it drives people to. It also is a very light movie to watch
despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human-factor going
for it. Never for once, was it trying to be manipulative at all, THE FULL
MONTY was true to itself all the way. While the hilarity level of this film
soared unexpectedly high, audience will find that they are in no way being
cheated of a laugh, something lacking in many comedy films (wannabes?) from
Hollywood. </P>
<P>Other than Carlyle, who acted as the psychotic Begbie in TRAINSPOTTING, the
rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on-screen. However, the
acting presented in this film is more than satisfying. Carlyle's work here
is a stark contrast to his character in TRAINSPOTTING, implying real acting
skill and flexibility on-screen. Kudos to the people involved in this film,
especially to director Peter Cattaneo for being able to put together an
excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your
just-another-STRIPTEASE. </P>
<P>Already a critical and financial success for such a small film, THE FULL
MONTY is a humble film which deserves applause throughout. While TITANIC
managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way, THE FULL MONTY gives one
the same satisfaction…….in half the time.</P>
