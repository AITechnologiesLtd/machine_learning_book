<P>   When I taught high-school history I was determined that my
classes would not be among the 99.44% of teens who
acquired a deep hatred of humankind's record at worst, an
indifference to the subject at best.  So the books I assigned to
them for outside reading were always historical fiction.  No
matter that the genre can sometimes play fast and loose with
the facts.  The important thing was that these kids--who were
never going to become historians or scholars in that field--
acquire both a liking for the discipline and a feel for the spirit
of the times.  "Johnny Tremain" would do to give them a
feeling for the color of the American Revolution and "All Quiet
on the Western Front" for the horrors of World War I.  We'd
acquire the basic facts quickly in class and, in fact, would
have fun figuring out where the fictitious works deviated from
the truth.</P>
<P>   Some stories play so fast with truth that we'd have a difficult
time justifying their use with our chairmen and principals.  The
great swashbuckler "The Mask of Zorro," based on the
character created by police reporter Johnston McCulley, is a
good example.  The bad news is that the adventures of this
California Robin Hood might confuse the heck out of the
readers--what was the former governor of Spain doing still
tossing his weight around in California after the Spaniards
were kicked out of the province in 1821?  The good news is
that the story of Zorro would furnish a kaleidoscopic, dare one
say psychedelic, imagery about life in what became America's
most bountiful state during its transition from Spanish rule to
Mexico's dominion, while under the dictatorship of General
Santa Anna--who later lost his leg and a huge piece of
territory to the Stars and Stripes in America's most territorially
enriching war.</P>
<P>   Perhaps the biggest fib conveyed in director Martin
Campbell's lush new TriStar movie "The Mask of Zorro"
occurs when the older Zorro, Don Diego De La Vega
(Anthony Hopkins) acts as mentor to Zorro the younger,
Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas).  Having taught the
former thief the art of swordplay, he declares, "I will teach you
charm," to which Murrieta replies, "What's that?"  The trouble
is that Banderas cannot help oozing charm even when
unkempt in a scruffy beard, dragged along the dirt by a team
of horses into captivity.  This sexiest of male performers on
the screen today has already stunned the skeptics with his
singing ability in "Evita" and has wowed the crowds in witty
movies like Pedro Almodovar's "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!"
and in the no-budget comic western that solidifed his talent
with an American audience in "Desperado."  Now, in the role
of young Zorro previously mythologized by Douglas Fairbanks
Sr. in 1920, by Tyrone Power in 1940, and in a less-than-
thrilling achievement by Frank Langella in 1974, he provides
his rapt audience with laughs and love and adventure that
keep the two-and-one-quarter hour picture throbbing.</P>
<P>   "The Mask of Zorro" opens the way all movies should:
without credits, saving the roll of acknowledgments to its
proper place at the end.  It substitutes the character's logo
astride a buckling horse against the light of a full moon.  The
older Zorro (the word means "fox" in Spanish, which is why
two unrelated men can adopt the commission) is captured by
Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson), who has taken away the
man's wife Esperanza and his daughter, Elena (Catherine
Zeta-Jones) while imprisoning him for two decades.  Zorro
had fired up the Mexican crowds against the greedy governor,
who wants his arch enemy to be humiliated rather than killed. 
Ultimately springing himself from the dungeon, he meets
Alejandro Murieta and mentors him from a common thief and
clown into a swordsman who can perform acrobatic miracles
and who equals Eliza Doolittle in his ability to infiltrate and
impersonate a person of noble birth.</P>
<P>   Comedy, wit, and swordplay intermingle freely in this boldly
conceived adventure, as Zorro the elder teaches his charge
that "a noble is but a man who says one thing and thinks
another" and, when asking the still undisciplined student
whether he knows how to use a sword, receives the
response, "Sure: the pointed end goes into the other man."</P>
<P>   What makes "The Mask of Zorro" so different from the
usual blend of action-adventure movies today is its ability to
capture the concentration of an audience with only a token
amount of killing.  This is no small accomplishment
considering that today's moviegoers are brought up on
pictures with huge body counts.  How does it do this? 
Director Campbell relies on our love for seeing people
humiliated, and this is just what the two Zorros have in mind:
to make fools of people who have exploited armies of the
unwashed.  While carving a "Z" into the neck of the governor
is among the more violent acts, Campbell tickles our
funnybones by humbling young Zorro and the bad guys alike
with more pratfalls than Chevy Chase can accomplish in an
hour.  In short, the pointed end of the sword rarely goes into
the other man.</P>
<P>   The swordfights--and there are many--are accompanied by
James Horner's palpitating score which treats the battles s
though they were a Spanish-American version of flamenco, all
building to a climax extragantly photographed by Phil Meheux
over a gold mine which is about to be blown up together with
scores of Mexican laborers by the evil governor. </P>
<P>   For the love interest, Banderas meets his match in
Catherine Zeta-Jones who, as the daughter of the older Zorro,
Elena, matches the daring Robin Hood equally on the dance
floor and the saber-rattling grounds.  Not a single curse flies
in this PG-13 film, nor is there a conventional, hot sex scene. 
What does that mean?  We don't need such gratuities if a
movie has star power, some flat-out hilarious comedy, and
lavishly-budgeted crowd scenes photographed with passion
and good fun.  "The Mask of Zorro" is a hoot.</P>
