<P>I went into A Bug's Life with certain expectations, and I was not
disappointed. I expected to see a technically advanced movie, with visually
stunning sets. I expected to see cutesy little characters spouting bad
puns. I expected to hear lots of celebrity voiceovers. And I expected A
Bug's Life to rival it's predecessor, Toy Story, in providing that
ineffable something known as movie magic. If A Bug's Life did nothing more
than meet my expectations -- which it does -- it would be a very good movie
indeed. In movies, and life, you're supposed to expect the unexpected. What
makes A Bug's Life a wonderful movie is the one thing I didn't expect going
in. A Bug's Life just happens to be a grand celebration of something that
seldom gets celebrated in Hollywood these days: The Values that Made
America Great.</P>
<P>First, you need to know that A Bug's Life is about a clash between three
cultural and political systems. We start off with the Ants, who are a
nameless, faceless, Communist horde. (To their credit, the ants are the
nicest, cutest Communists you'd ever want to meet, and they're ruled by
Phyllis Diller instead of Big Brother.) They are opposed by the
Grasshoppers, who are an evil Fascist menace led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey),
who rules Grasshoppers and Ants alike with an iron, er, fist, I guess. The
Ants work like Stalinist shock-workers to gather enough food to feed
themselves and the Grasshoppers.</P>
<P>Along comes Flik, who -- with one exception -- is the digital embodiment of
the American Spirit.  (Save for his voice, which is provided by Canada's
Dave Foley.)  Flik is an Eagle Scout among bugs (yes, they have Scouting in
A Bug's Life).  We know right from the outset that he is smart, creative
and inventive -- we see him with a jerry-built harvester designed to
collect grain more efficiently.  When he accidentally endangers the colony,
he accepts responsibility and tries to stand up to the bully grasshoppers.
He bravely goes forth on a noble quest and returns heroically -- then uses
his daring and ingenuity in the final battle with the grasshoppers.  Flik
is the closest thing to a Frank Capra hero we've seen since Captain Miller
in Saving Private Ryan (and before that, Kevin Costner's Postman, which
makes you wonder where all the Capra heroes have gone.)</P>
<P>Flik is aided on his mission by a wandering troupe of circus bugs, who make
the trip to the ant colony thinking they're there to entertain -- instead
of serving as mercenaries.  The troupe provides all of the other elements
that you'd expect from a Pixar movie:  lots of celebrity voices, physical
humor, and cheap puns.  The top act at the flea circus is at least as
visually complex as the "falling with style" sequence in Toy Story, and the
ending battle with the grasshoppers is as inventive as Buzz and Woody's
final dash for the moving van.  My only complaint is that there are
probably one or two too many circus performers, and the ones who are most
interesting (say, Bonnie Hunt's black widow) don't get enough screen time.</P>
<P>However, this is a minor quibble, and in no way should affect my admiration
for the hard work of the Pixar team in bringing us this lively holiday
gift.  A Bug's Life is a labor of love in an industry that all too often
takes the quick and dirty approach.  Best wishes to them and to their
marketing department, which is now, I'm sure, busy selling little Flik
dolls... because capitalism is an American Value too.</P>
