<PRE>DECEIVER
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie.  This overly constructed
film succeeds in having many surprises, and, being true to its title,
being deceptive. But there is little in the film that is worthy of
deceit.</P>
<P>Braxton (Chris Penn) and Kennesaw (Michael Rooker) are two cops
investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute (Renee Zellweger).
Their lone suspect is Wayland (Tim Roth), a wealthy young man whose
phone number was found in the hooker's pocket.</P>
<P>However, a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators, as
the crafty Wayland somehow turns the tables.  Braxton and Kennesaw are
forced to confront their own troubled lives.  Braxton is a gambling
addict in deep to Mook (Ellen Burstyn), a local bookie. Kennesaw is
bitter about his marriage to a socialite (Rosanna Arquette), believing
his wife to be unfaithful.</P>
<P>The plot is twisty and complex, with lots of lengthy flashbacks, and
plenty of surprises.  However, there are times when it is needlessly
complex, and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled
that the answers to important plot points actually get lost.  Take a
look at L.A. Confidential, or the film's more likely inspiration, The
Usual Suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled.</P>
<P>The dialogue in Deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot.  For example,
the film tells a few substories (such as the tale of a woeful absinthe
bender, or an alternative telling of how Van Gogh lost his ear), but
they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and
unbelievable. There's never the sense that these are real characters
engaging in conversation. They appear to be nothing more than words on a
screenplay.</P>
<P>The characters, themselves, are rather pathetic and despicable.  Not one
of them is an ounce sympathetic, and as a result, the labyrinthine plot
is all for naught. What does it matter who is guilty of what and why?</P>
<P>Writer-directors Josh and Jonas Pate seem to desire to emulate the Coen
brothers' masterwork Blood Simple, or the Wachowski brothers' less
worthy Bound. But, while they have got the plot twists down cold, they
need to work on characterization and dialogue.</P>
