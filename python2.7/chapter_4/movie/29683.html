<PRE>"Innocence"</PRE>
<P>Five decades ago, Andreas (Charles Tingwell) and Claire (Julia Blake)
shared a passionate romance in Belgium, following World War II, then went
their separate ways. Now, a half-century later, they discover that they
live in the same Australian city and it soon becomes evident that their
love of so long ago has not faded. Although Andreas is a widower, Claire is
married and is torn between her loyalty to husband John (Terry Norris) and
the passion she still feels for her former lover in "Innocence."</P>
<P>Director Paul Cox is known for his artistic portrayals of life, such as
that of a lonely, aging voyeur in "A Man of Flowers" and a woman dying with
dignity in "A Woman's Tale." With "Innocence" the helmer/writer takes a
radically different filmic path with a subject matter - a long parted
couple, now aged, and their rekindled passion - that is not the kind of
thing one gets from Hollywood. With its theme of senior love, it is the
kind of thing that the internationally acclaimed filmmaker would explore,
though, and he is moderately successful in his effort. High marks go to Cox
for having the gonads to depict life during the twilight years where love
and passion are still real.</P>
<P>Using ample, even overused, flashbacks shot with a handheld camera and
exhibiting a grainy garishness, we see Claire (Kristine Van Pellicom) and
Andreas (Kenny Aernouts), 50-years younger, walking hand in hand,
frolicking around Belgium and making mad, passionate love. (Truth be told,
the flashbacks are the biggest problem with the film, taking up too much
time showing a young couple almost void of any real personality.) This sets
the stage for what will happen many years later to the young lovers after
they are, seemingly, parted forever.</P>
<P>We come to the present and meet septuagenarian Andreas, whose wife died
some 30 years ago and, since that time, he has reminisced about his first
love, Claire. When he learns that she lives nearby, he writes to her,
almost begging to see her again. Although Claire is married now, old
feelings flood back and she agrees to meet with her old flame. Their
passions are rekindled and Claire must make a choice between her
long-standing marriage and her newly re-sparked relationship with Andreas.</P>
<P>This study in elderly romance is handled with dignity as Cox shifts between
the modern-day love affair of Claire and Andreas and the long ago, though
not forgotten, involvement when the two were so much younger (but,
definitely, not more impassioned). The story segues between the quiet,
loving romance of the elder couple and the more energetic ardor when they
were young. The present-day interlude, as the couple beds down together
after half a century apart, is handled with sensitivity as the camera
lingers over their quiet loving that still has the fire (though a bit more
slowly generated) of their younger years..</P>
<P>Cox kicks it up a notch as he throws Claire's marriage into the mixture
with she and husband John coping with their side of this aging love
triangle. Married for over 40 years ("44 years, 3 months and 6 days,"
Claire informs John), there has not been a physical relationship between
them for two decades. When she drops the news of her newly awakened desires
for Andreas, John, at first, simply doesn't believe it, then, as the
reality sinks in, is angered, hurt and confused. Claire decides to accept
the consequences of her action and a tense truce is arrived at, but not
before John sends his physician son David (Robert Menzies ) to find out
what's wrong. Meanwhile, the widowed Andreas confides his feelings to his
incredulous daughter, Monique (Marta Dusseldorp), and garners her support.</P>
<P>Julia Blake takes charismatic hold of the screen as the still beautiful
Claire. The actress is the one in charge here as Claire is the one who
makes the decisions concerning her life and those of Andreas and John.
Blake has regal good looks and comes across as attractive and a convincing
object of desire for both of her men. Blake's real-life husband Norris
gives a solid tragic/comic performance as movie husband, John, who is torn
between maintaining the failing status quo of his marriage and the desire
to keep his wife, no matter what the cost. Charles Tingwell (one of the
heroes in the wonderful Aussie comedy, "The Castle") is two dimensional, at
best, and acts mainly as the catalyst for the changes that are to be
visited on the three senior citizens. The limited supporting cast helps to
give some depth to the background, but the focus is on the three principles
throughout the film.</P>
<P>There is a staginess to the proceedings that gives the film a static,
TV-like look that is more suited to the small screen. If an actress of a
lesser caliber than Blake were the focus of the film, I'd say that it
should go directly to television. Her performance, though, is worth the
price of theater admission. The subject matter is so fresh and untrammeled
it begs to draw in more mature audiences to this sweet, melancholy story of
love at the end of life, though I doubt that you'll see it at the local
multiplex. "Innocence" travels ground that is rarely seen on the screen and
is handle with sensitive care. I give it a B.</P>
