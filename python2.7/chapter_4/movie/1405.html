<PRE>                                THE ADJUSTER
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     THE ADJUSTER is a Canadian film directed and written by Atom
Egoyan.  It stars Elias Koteas, Arsinee Khanjian, Maury Chaykin, and
Gabrielle Rose.  It is rated R for sexual situations.</P>
<P>     THE ADJUSTER has moved from the recent Seattle International Film
Festival to a theatrical run in this town.  By all reports it was one of
the successes of the Festival.  Atom Egoyan is the Armenian-Canadian
director of FAMILY VIEWING and SPEAKING PARTS.  This new film is being
marketed as a black comedy.  Don't you believe it!  It is a serious
movie about values, seeking values, defining values, putting the price
on values, as it were.  In doing this, Egoyan weaves together three
stories, each one of which out-Lynches David Lynch at every turn for
bizarre situations and unlikely plot turns.  This is a strange,
ambiguous movie never goes out of its way to explain itself, but I doubt
you will find much that is comedic about it, even though it is witty and
canny as hell.  You will likely find it fascinating and surprising right
to the end.</P>
<P>     Elias Koteas plays Noah Render, the insurance adjuster who devotes
himself utterly and compulsively to the needs of his clients, who all
seem to be victims of fires.  He takes charge of their lives while they
are in the bureaucratic limbo of waiting to get their claims processed.
He puts them up in the same motel, he visits them daily, he even sleep
with them if that's what they need.  Amy Taubin in the Village Voice
calls him a "compassion junkie", which pretty much says it.  Of course,
what an insurance adjuster does is determine the value of what is lost.
His fallacy is thinking that what is lost can be regained, but he
determinedly tries to put a value on everything, even in coito.</P>
<P>     He lives in a model home in a bankrupt housing development that
otherwise consists of scalped ground and signs showing the house that
will never be built there.  He shares this house with Hera, her
Armenian-speaking sister, and Hera's young son.  You might think you
understand the relationships here, but there's a chance you're wrong.</P>
<P>     Hera, played by Arsinee Khanjian, is a censor.  She spends her days
viewing apparently horrific pornographic films and classifying the ways
each violates some code of moral values.  Her sister has taken an
interest in her work, too.</P>
<P>     Then there is the story of Bubba and Mimi (played by Maury Chaykin
and Gabrielle Rose, respectively).  Was Bubba a filthy street person
Mimi assaults on the subway, or is it one of her elaborate, kinky
fantasies?  As Bubba explains later, "They have everything, or at least
the means to have everything, they want, but they don't know what they
need, so they try different things."  Their ultimate try-out results in,
inter alia, uniting the three threads of the film.</P>
<P>     THE ADJUSTER gets off to one of those starts where you think the
film is never going to let you in on its secrets, but it does at its own
pace.  I think the pace could have been tighter, but that's just about
my only cavil.  The pacing problem is a problem at all because the
characters are all so emotionally dead; most of the time they brood.
Bubba and Mimi are pretty lively, but even Bubba can express himself
only with pauses you could drive a Mack truck through.  The actors are
uniformly excellent.</P>
<P>     I can cheerfully recommend THE ADJUSTER to any fan of Egoyan or Wim
Wenders, whose style makes similar demands of the viewer.  It is an odd
movie, but a uniquely satisfying one, one you will think and talk about
some time to come.</P>
