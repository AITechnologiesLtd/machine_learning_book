<P>     Anyone remotely familiar with the Robin Hood legend knows the
basic story behind this parody.  Robin (Cary Elwes) is the dashing hero
who, along with his band of Merry Men (which includes members Will
Scarlet O'Hara and Achoo the Moor), roams Sherwood Forest as the
champion of the common people.  His sworn enemy is the evil Sheriff of
Rottingham (Roger Rees), and his One True Love is Maid Marian (Amy
Yasbeck), she of the Everlast chastity belt.  To win the heart and hand
of Marian, Robin must defeat the Sheriff and his master, Prince John
(Richard Lewis).</P>
<P>     Imagine an amalgamation of THE NAKED GUN, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF
THIEVES, and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, and you have a pretty
good idea what to expect from MEN IN TIGHTS.  This is a film packed
start-to-finish with satire, puns, one-liners, and other assorted
visual and audile jokes.  Nothing is too high-brow or low-brow for Mel
Brooks, although you can bet there are more occurrences of earthy humor
than that of the intellectual variety.  Every opportunity for humor, no
matter how feeble or juvenile, is seized upon.</P>
<P>     There have been several parodies already this year (LOADED WEAPON
ONE, HOT SHOTS: PART DEUX!, and LAST ACTION HERO come to mind), none of
which have attained the level of MEN IN TIGHTS.  That's not to say that
this is a masterpiece of any sort, but its jokes are more clever, more
original, and more consistently funny than those in the other movies.
In a HOT SHOTS-type film, the humor gets stale by the end of the first
half-hour, and most of the laughs have dried up long before the final
credits roll.  Mel Brooks, on the other hand, has enough experience
(not to mention flair) with this kind of motion picture, that he knows
to vary the humor so that the gags don't wear thin before the running
time has expired.</P>
<P>     That's not to say that everything Brooks does works.  There are a
fair share of clunkers in MEN IN TIGHTS.  But with such a non-stop
barrage of jokes, regardless of what percentage work, there's not much
time in between laughs.  And whether your kind of humor is along the
lines of Shakespeare or Cheech and Chong, there's something in this
movie sure to provoke laughter.</P>
<P>     In many ways, this is the Mel Brooks of old, the same master of
humor that brought us classics like YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and BLAZING
SADDLES.  MEN IN TIGHTS is not as original, inventive, or hilarious as
those offerings, but it's a reasonable offering and certainly not in
the same dubious category as such Brooks duds like LIFE STINKS.  In
terms of scope, potential, and execution, this Robin Hood parody is
along the lines of SPACEBALLS, the Brooks take-off on STAR WARS.</P>
<P>     There's a fairly strong element of MONTY PYTHON in this movie.
While no one in their right mind would dare put this film on the same
level as THE HOLY GRAIL, there are moments in MEN IN TIGHTS that the
British comedy troupe would be proud of.  Most notably, perhaps, is the
rendition of the musical number, "Men in Tights," which bears a passing
resemblance to the Pythons' "Lumberjack Song."</P>
<P>     In a story that closely parallels the Kevin Costner account, Cary
Elwes does his best Errol Flynn imitation--a fine job acting serious
and swashbuckling amidst all the silliness around him.  The other major
players do reasonable jobs, from Roger Rees giving an over-the-top
performance that couldn't quite match that of Alan Rickman (from PRINCE
OF THIEVES) to a too-subdued Amy Yasbeck.</P>
<P>     As is frequently the case, those with cameos steal the show.  Dom
DeLuise shows up for one scene doing a superlative lampoon of Marlon
Brando from THE GODFATHER.  Patrick Stewart is on hand to imitate Sean
Connery's King Richard from PRINCE OF THIEVES.  Not only does he strike
as regal a figure as Connery, but he does an excellent job of mimicking
the accent.</P>
<P>     There are so many jokes in this movie that it's difficult to pick
out a memorable one or two.  Among the more subtle ones, I was partial
to the "moving mole" on Richard Lewis' face.  Nearly every time we see
Prince John, his rather sizeable mole has moved somewhere else.  At one
point, the Sheriff even feels compelled to mention this.  Then there's
Mel Brooks as Rabbi Tuckman (instead of Friar Tuck), who gives "half
off" circumcisions.  Most of the overblown musical numbers are also
fun, with obviously-dubbed singing voices and rappers fulfilling the
function of a Greek Chorus.</P>
<P>     Parodies are hard films to do, as the mediocre success of so many
recent ones has shown.  No matter how ripe a film or genre might be for
mocking, unless you know how to do it, there are no guarantees.
Fortunately for MEN IN TIGHTS, Mel Brooks has been doing this kind of
thing for decades.  As the ads say, "The legend had it coming", and
this film certainly dishes out all that the Merry Men can handle--and
more.</P>
