<P>   "I don't want to be alone," says Vanessa Williams to
Chayanne is the less-than-realized movie "Dance With Me." 
What she is really afraid of is not aloneness but loneliness, a
horse of a different color and an emotional state so frightful to
so many people that high-school kids consistently say in polls
that it is the condition they fear the most.  With so many
people in America now living alone, particular in urban
apartments, it's no wonder that psychotherapists make a
good buck in this country. "Living Out Loud" is about two
lonely people who get together for a while, talk about their
disaffection with life, provide comfort, effect great changes in
each, and then, inevitably, fall out because one cannot give
the other as much as he wants and is willing to give to the
relationship.   As a theme, it's not a wildly original one, but in
the hands of first-time director Richard LaGravenese ("The
Bridges of Madison County") it provides surprises, particularly
when the two people offering consolation to each other are so
mismatched in class, looks, and height.  "Living Out Loud"
features two actors known for their comic roles, Danny De
Vito and Holly Hunter, and highlights an even greater happy
surprise--that of Queen Latifah, heretofore known as a first-
class rap singer, in the role of a sensual chanteuse who can
rivet her sophisticated audience of supper-club denizens.</P>
<P>   Holly Hunter is known to avid filmgoers for her stunning
role in "The Piano" five years ago as a severe Nineteenth
Century woman repressed in everything except silent pride. 
With her current movie, though, she's back in a more typical
role as a fireball of energy, one who is given over to talk, talk,
talk as she was in her successes in a stage role in Beth
Henley's "Miss Firecracker" and an Emmy-winning job in
Gregory Hoblit's "Roe vs. Wade."  Now, as a woman who is
living the good life on Manhattan's Upper East Side courtesy
of a marriage to a successful cardiologist, she is faced with a
forlorn but not withdrawn existence as a newly-divorced
woman who has not lost her taste for living it up, or, as the
title goes, living out loud.  When Judith (Hunter) throws out
her philandering doctor husband, Bob Nelson (Martin
Donovan), she continues to go to fancy restaurants and night
clubs, but alone and feeling none too enviable.  At a club one
night she meets a striking singer, Liz (Queen Latifah), who at
first ignores her but after getting to know her introduces her
to an unusual and packed-to-the-rafters disco in Manhattan's
meat district.  Meanwhile she has established some
communication with her building's elevator operator, Pat
(Danny De Vito), likewise divorced, whose daughter had
recently died of cancer, who owes money to the mob, and
whose ambitions lie in establishing a food importation
business.  The two are in many ways mismatched, but
because of their common dilemma they console each other. 
While Pat is down-to-earth, Judith is given to leaps of
imagination--literally, when she pictures herself jumping from
her 17th story window and landing on her ex-husband and his
new wife, killing all three.  She has a quick, vivid fantasy of
kissing a mysterious man in a bar (Elias Koteas) and a real-
life experience with a strikingly handsome masseur--
photographed with erotic exquisiteness by cinematographer
John Bailey.</P>
<P>   La Gravenese's filming path takes the movie in two
directions: one relatively static, featuring characters sitting
over glasses of wine or cups of coffee commiserating about
their common misfortune; the other active and moving, as
when Judith pictures herself cavorting Fosse-style in a
lesbian night club with some gorgeous models, showing that
disco is anything but dead.  LaGravenese is most effective,
however, as a writer, as the film has drily comic, productive
dialogue that keeps us wondering whether Pat and Judith can
surmount their differences to unite on a more permanent
basis.  It is targeted to a forty-something or fifty-something
audience as opposed to the recent string of date movies
which highlight romances between lively but immature men
and women whose marriages would probably not outlast the
usual one-year honeymoon period.  Looking at a poster of De
Vito and Hunter sitting together in an elegant East Side
restaurant, you'll wonder how these two mismatched folks
can talk about anything romantic except their previous
companions.  But as you get to know them--and they get
familiar with each other--you'll root for them while knowing at
the same time that a durable bond between them is just not
going to happen.  "Living Out Loud," with its quiry characters
and poignant situations, is one of this year's best examples of
adult romantic comedy: a solid choice.</P>
