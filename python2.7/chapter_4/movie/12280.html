<P>The trailers for The Gingerbread Man boast that it's a film based on a
story by John Grisham, devised specifically for the big screen.  After
seeing the picture, I found that this statement essentially means that
it's a film about a Southern lawyer in a situation that doesn't require
him to use his skills as a lawyer.  Directed by the always-experimental
Robert Altman and starring the great Kenneth Branagh, I expected a lot
from this film.  What I got was a professional execution of a cliched
and only semi-amusing script; even worse, the conclusion provides more
questions than answers.  Unfortunately, The Gingerbread Man comes down
to little more than cheap shocks and Actors Faking Accents.    </P>
<P>Branagh is superb in the main role, featuring another flawless accent
completely dissimilar from his native British inflection.  He plays Rick
Magruder, a successful lawyer in Georgia.  The most prominent background
information we get on him is that his ex-wife, Leeanne (Famke Janssen),
hates him; and, because of a bitter custody battle, he only gets to see
his kids once a week.  The film opens with Rick meeting a strange woman
in a parking lot during a rain storm.  Her name is Mallory Doss (Embeth
Davidtz), and her car has been stolen by her crazy father, Dixon.</P>
<P>Naturally, the only thing Rick can do is take her home and seduce her
(she makes it really easy for him by taking off all her clothes to have
a crying fit).  The plot thickens when it turns out her father, played
by Robert Duvall, is terrorizing her by hanging her cat, among other
things.  Rick takes the case to court, at which point Dixon is sent to a
mental institution.  Not long after this, Dixon's destitute pals break
him out, and we are led to believe that he not only continues his
harassment of Mallory, but that his focus also falls onto Rick's
children.</P>
<P>There's a lot more to the story, but the last half hour or so is
reserved for unlikely plot twists, so I'll let you experience those for
yourself.  The problem with the story, I noticed, is that it's hard to
tell where it's going for at least an hour into it.  The threat of Dixon
never seemed threatening, so I was constantly wondering what all these
people were so incredibly worried about.  Then, just when it seems that
Rick is as useless a main character as I've ever seen, his kids are in
danger, and he must fight against the police and his ex-wife to keep
them safe.</P>
<P>The Gingerbread Man, as I said, relies on a story that is, for the most
part, composed of numerous plot devices and scenes that we've seen in so
many other films of the mystery and thriller genres.  Rick is a lawyer,
but he doesn't need to be:  his only source of motivation is his
children.  (Although the fact that he is a lawyer provides for one
particularly interesting scene in which he can't get help in a police
station because all the police men know he's a lawyer and hate him for
it.)  A lot of the film is suspenseful, but too much of it hinges on
cheap thrills (yes, you will see a cat knock over a glass bottle to
create a sudden loud noise and scare the characters).</P>
<P>Then, of course, we have the supporting characters, which is a vast
assortment of Actors Faking Accents.  Davidtz is a good actress, and
she's good here in her quiet, subtle way.  Robert Downey, Jr., whose
Southern accent is about as thick and exaggerated as any I've ever
heard, is fun to watch as Rick's detached partner.  Duvall has all of
two lines in the film, but still has fun with his role of the token
psycho.  Darryl Hannah plays Rick's secretary, and is almost completely
unrecognizable with the accent, dark hair, and glasses.  In fact, there
are so many Actors Faking Accents that I was distracted in every scene
because I know all these actors are faking these accents.  I wish the
film would have taken place somewhere other than the south, because then
everyone could have just spoken normally.</P>
<P>But that just points out another flaw of this film:  the setting has no
impact on the story.  The characters don't, either.  Rick never solves
anything because of his ingenuity or intelligence (he's even forced into
a pointless climactic battle in a rain storm on a catwalk with Tom
Berenger).  None of the characters are particularly well-drawn, though
they are interesting enough to have kept my attention.  Thrillers are
most effective when they rely on the characters to solve the problems
that the film offers.  The Gingerbread Man features a bunch of
one-dimensional people doing things that the story requires them to do.</P>
<P>But, it's not all bad.  Altman does a great job with the atmosphere,
and the fact that the film takes place almost entirely during a
hurricane is a nice touch for underlying tension and suspense.  The film
is adequately dark, and the music is subtle enough that it adds mood and
color to the scenes.  Not all of Altman's choices are great, though:  he
often makes it difficult to see (even Seven wasn't this ridiculously
dark), and I often found myself straining to pick up the image.  </P>
<P>I don't understand why The Gingerbread Man even needed to be a thriller
with car chases and gunfire.  This seems like it could have been an
almost completely psychological thriller.  For some reason, Altman and
crew have put their hearts into a story that just isn't very interesting
or even plausible.  It might prove to be a worthwhile evening of
entertainment for some, because it is a well-crafted picture.  But I was
hoping for a lot more than just a bunch of Actors Faking Accents.</P>
