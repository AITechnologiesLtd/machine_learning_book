<PRE>IN DREAMS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Director Neil Jordan takes a gamble and fails with his latest movie, In
Dreams.  He assembles a talented cast, and combines it with some superb
camera work.  But then he applies these paints to a fragmented and
nonsensical story.  Can a movie exist with style, but no substance? In
Dreams is a convincing argument in the negative.</P>
<P>Claire Cooper (Annette Bening) has had psychic visions all her life,
though she never knew what they meant.  However, lately they've been
getting much more disturbing, as she becomes certain that at least part
of what she's seeing involves a missing young girl.</P>
<P>The increasingly nightmarish visions are beginning to upset her husband,
Paul (Aidan Quinn), as well.  He begins to suspect his wife may slowly
be going crazy.  A psychiatrist, Dr. Silverman (Stephen Rea) suggests
that she be hospitalized.</P>
<P>Claire, however, begins to suspect that someone is feeding her dreams.
She fears that her psychic pen-pal may be a serial killer (Robert Downey
Jr.), and that her visions are anticipating his actions.</P>
<P>In Dreams is wonderfully shot by cinematographer Darius Khondji.
Haunting and evocative, the imagery of the film is easily the film's
strongest suit.  The only flaw here is that the film is a little
overreliant on a few questionable motifs (you won't leave the theater
craving any apples, that's for sure).</P>
<P>However, there is not much behind this pretty facade.  What starts out
as a mildly interesting premise quickly becomes ludicrous as the film
descends along its mindless path.  Disjointed and confusing at times, In
Dreams is like a bad dream itself.  Full of none sequiturs and loose
ends, just when you think the movie can't make any less sense, it
somehow surprises you.</P>
<P>There's some good talent here, though, that gives the material a fair
shot.  Annette Bening makes the strongest impression with her descent
into madness.  Aidan Quinn is also notable as her beleaguered husband,
yet the film doesn't quite know what to do with his role. It tosses him
a minor subplot early on, only to forget about it a few scenes later.
Robert Downey Jr. is appropriately creepy as the film's mysterious bad
guy. However, his familiar character seems to be patched together from
the assorted parts of serial killers of films past.</P>
<P>Despite the efforts of the cast, nothing can quite disguise the
hollowness at the film's center.  In fact, it's almost tragic that such
good actors and imagery have been wasted on such a worthless movie.</P>
