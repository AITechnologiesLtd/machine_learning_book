<P>   A couple of blocks from where I live is a vest-pocket park--
nothing like the spacious Toronto meadow of Bruce
McCulloch's new, light comedy--which is dominated from 7 to
9 each morning by a mostly young crew of neighborhood
residents and their mostly large dogs.  Few of the people on
the high ends of the leashes know one another's names, but
they all know the names of the canines that romp, play, and
fetch on the grassy knolls.  A few months ago, in fact, one of
the older walkers died.  A modest service was held for him in
the park, though not a single person attending the function
knew the name of the deceased.  Such is perhaps the politics
of dog parks everywhere, where pet lovers meet daily, sip
their Starbucks breakfasts, and get to know everything about
each other except for names.  Are dog parks the answer to
those who eschew gyms and single bars for meeting the
opposite sex?  Probably.  I've seen no evidence of this in my
own neighborhood but in the Bruce McCulloch's airy, 20-
something world, serial monogamy is the name of the game
as dog people assemble in the park, form bonds, break up,
and meet once again.</P>
<P>   McCulloch, who penned and directs the comedy, is known
mostly to young movie goers as a member of the Kids in the
Hall troupe whose "Brain Candy" deals with the effects of a
prescription drug's running amok.  The Edmonton-born writer
focuses on a serial monogamist, Andy (Luke Wilson), whose
many relationships belie his loneliness.  Compelled by his
lack of fulfillment to remain "single" for no more than four
days at a time, he flits from one unsuccessful relationship to
another, never giving himself time to be alone and reflective. 
After his woman du jour, Cheryl (Kathleen Robertson--a
lookalike for the Ally Sheedy of a decade ago), leaves him for
another (Gordon Currie), requiring him to share with her the
custody of his beloved dog Mogley (Casey), Andy runs into
the clean-cut Lorna (Nathasha Henstridge), whose perfect
skin and facial symmetry make her an ideal candidate for her
page-boy style hair.  While the two awkwardly pursue their
new relationship, each is mentored by a friend.  Andy takes
the advice of her newspaper editor Jeri (Janeane Garofalo),
who is virtually married to Jeff (Bruce McCulloch), while
Lorna, a TV host on a children's show, follows the counsel of
the Joan Cusack-like Rachel (Arnie Carey).</P>
<P>   The film's most interesting scenes are not of the unrequited
people but of the dogs whom they love--the beasts who take
the place of two-legged significant others.  The pooches are
being readied by obedience trainer-therapist Dr. Cavan (Mark
McKinney--taking on the same last name as the producer of
the movie)--easily the most amusing guy in the movie.  He
takes his job with deadly seriousness. Able to get the canines
to come and go from his therapy room with a single
command, he is the person you want to hire to have your
own pet sit, stay, and heel, though like all the others in the
film he has his share of neuroses.</P>
<P>   Aside from him, there are few we can care about.  You've
got to wonder how Andy is able to travel so easily from one
babe to another.  He has the mannerisms of David Arquette
with all the neuroses of a Woody Allen oddball--so passive
that he probably attracts only women who want boys to
mother.  In fact one female literally buys him at an auction
and proves to be so cheap and whorish that you wonder how
Andy is able to stand being with her long enough to celebrate
their 50th anniversary together--that's 50 instances of
lovemaking.</P>
<P>   The sexual revolution has not ended.  These characters
are as addicted to the pleasures of the flesh as are some
people in high places today.  McCulloch successfully merges
the dog panoramas with the more intimate scenes of these
eccentrics. But bizarre characters and whimsical episodes do
not necessarily make for a satisfying whole.  "Dog Park" is so
feather-light that it's as forgettable as yesterday's main
squeeze.</P>
<PRE>Rated R.  Running Time: 90 minutes.  (C) 1999
