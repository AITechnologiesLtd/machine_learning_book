<P>A mini-saga of a family of  Italian immigrants in London, "Queen of Hearts"
opens with a wonderful, dialogue-less sequence, like something recollected
from an old-fashioned silent drama. In an Italian village,  Rosa, promised
to the butcher's son Barbariccia , runs away with her true love Danilo in a
scene worthy of "The Perils of Pauline."</P>
<P>We next meet the couple in England, with several kids and Rosa's mother.
Ten-year old Eddie narrates the movie, from his point of view, a perception
which mixes fantasy and  fact.</P>
<P>The Luccas start out small but become  modestly prosperous when, one
Christmas,  a talking pig head on a platter advises ineffectual Danilo, a
waiter, to gamble. Danilo parlays five pounds into enough to buy The Lucky
Cafe.</P>
<P>The film follows with obvious affection the life of the Luccas within an
Italian enclave in London.  Beyond small  character skits nothing major
happens , until  spurned ex-fiance Barbariccia shows up, with loads of
money and shady connections. Bygones are bygones, says he, but  he's
really on a vendetta and tries to ruin Danilo.  Not to worry:  Eddie is
watching and he   devises a complex scheme to save the day.</P>
<P>The movie is low key, played with reserve, a more British than Italian
trait. It has improbabilities, anachronistic clothes and artifacts -- but
one must remember that nearly everything is filtered through the boy's
imaginative memory.</P>
<P>This is  the first theatrical feature by Jon Amiel., who  has been much
praised for his British TV movies and series , notably "The Singing
Detective."   "Queen Of Hearts" feels like  a transition  between the small
and the big screen.  Possibly,  Amiel tried to do for Italians in Britain
a little of what "My Beautiful Laundrette" did for immigrant Pakistanis.</P>
<P>The film has pleasantly original aspects, yet also has connections to
earlier movies: it is like a glimpse at the sunny side of "The Godfather,"
uses  comedy in the spirit of the Ealing Studios movies of the late 40s and
50s, and ends like  "The Sting."</P>
<P>These factors  come together  nicely , though not   flawlessly.  There are
some gratuitous or padded passages ,  especially after Danilo's father
joins the family. Past the early parts and noticeably in the mid-section,
there is slackness and gauche connections. The camera work is lively, with
flourishes and spirals like those of a brilliant cinematography student let
loose with professional equipment, but more probably this may be the
influence of stylists like Ken Russell,  with whom director of photography
Mike Southon has worked .</P>
<P>In spite of some imperfections  the movie spins its story with charm, uses
a lovely  score --a hybrid of Fellini movie-music and  Verdi operas ,-- and
has  soberly appealing , unfamiliar  actors from Italy and England.</P>
<P>After "Queen," John Amiel made, all in the USA, the nicely off-the wall
"Tune in Tomorrow,"then two so-so pics: "Sommersby" (the Hollywoodian
remake of "The Return of Martin Guerre") and "Copycat,"  followed by two
fizzles "The Man Who Knew Too Little" and "Entrapment"(1999)</P>
<P>" Le mauvais gout mene au crime" (Stendhal)</P>
