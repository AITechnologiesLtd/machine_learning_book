<P>_Reindeer_Games_ (R) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Ben Affleck is such a gosh-darn likable fella.  In every film (not to
mention talk show appearance) he does, he projects an ebullient, affable
charisma that easily endears him to the audience.  However, it's that
very quality that defeats him and the entirety of _Reindeer_Games_
-- though, in all fairness, there are plenty of others to blame for how
the film goes wrong.</P>
<P>_Reindeer_ was written by Ehren Kruger, and after making a strong debut
with last summer's chilling _Arlington_Road_, he is beginning to look
like a one-trick pony.  He ruined the _Scream_ trilogy with his weak
script for its final installment, and now comes this film, which, I must
admit, has the seed of a good idea at its core.  Affleck plays Rudy
Duncan, a just-released convict who decides to pose as his just-murdered
cellmate Nick to get some action with Ashley (Charlize Theron), with whom
Nick shared a passionate mail correspondence.  But the roll in the hay
comes at a price--turns out that Ashley's brother Gabriel wants "Nick" to
help in the robbery of a casino where "Nick" once worked.  Of course, the
problem is, not only is "Nick" not really Nick, but he also hasn't the
slightest idea how to pull off a heist--Rudy served time for grand theft
auto.</P>
<P>Numerous twists ensue, and per Dimension's request (as stated in a
disclaimer at the top of the press notes), I won't reveal any more. 
While a number of the turns are genuinely surprising, they soon spring
out of control.  By the final reel, the script twists for the mere sake
of twisting, going for the cheap shock at the expense of all logic or
sense of reality.  It could be countered that Kruger never takes the
material too seriously, throwing in numerous one-liners to break the
tension.  But, as evidenced in _Scream_3_, Kruger isn't much of a comedy
writer, and the failed attempts at humor end up taking viewers out of the
increasingly complicated story rather than making it more enjoyable.</P>
<P>With such a script so uneven in tone, it's little wonder that the
performances are wildly varied.  One minute Sinise is a sinister villain,
the next minute he's somewhat of a buffoon.  At least he tries to ride
along with the material, unlike the other two leads, who nail one extreme
and stick with it.  Theron is a good actress and a stunning screen
presence, but she plays her character much too straight, making certain
turns of events that much more preposterous.  Affleck plays up the
jokiness of the script, and while that famously light approach has worked
elsewhere, it isn't quite what's needed in this type of action thriller. 
Certainly Bruce Willis cracks wise in all of his action vehicles, but
when it came down to business, he was a convincing tough guy; Affleck, on
the other hand, has a look of smug bemusement on his face most of the
time, as if to knowingly mock the ridiculous affair.  If our hero doesn't
appear to believe--or believe in--what's going on, how does one expect
the audience to?</P>
<P>The audience may not believe in _Reindeer_Games_, but director John
Frankenheimer does his best to at least keep them superficially
interested.  The film is fast-paced; the numerous suspense and action
scenes are all smoothly done, and every now and again one is able to get
a momentary adrenaline rush.  But the excitement is just that, momentary
and very fleeting--proving that without a story or characters to really
care about, an action thriller is, to borrow the term Gabriel uses in the
film, just a silly little reindeer game.</P>
