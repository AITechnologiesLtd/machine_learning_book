<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
5 stars</PRE>
<P>Martin Scorsese's Kundun is to Tibetan Buddhist's what Jesus of Nazareth
is to Christians.  Both of them are revelations; religiously inspired -
and not specifically character driven - examinations of myth and
history.  They're more than just motion pictures.  They're visual
journeys through the beliefs of followers across the world.  Make no
mistake: Kundun is a daring, admirable work of art that depicts the life
of one of the greatest religious figures this century - the fourteenth
Dalai Lama.</P>
<P>Scorsese starts us off with the tale of a two-year old named Tenzin
Gyatso.  A Buddhist monk (disguised as a servant) finds him, and
believes he is the fourteenth reincarnation of the Dalai Lama.  Sure
enough, the boy correctly identifies the thirteenth's personal items and
becomes the spiritual ruler of Tibet.  Through the following years,
Tenzin is extensively trained by high-monks on how a Dalai Lama should
look, think and sound.</P>
<P>At only 16 years of age, Tenzin finds himself protecting his country
from the grasping hands of communist China.  Along the way he has to
cope with the death of his father, the tyranny of the Chinese and the
ever-increasing responsibilities of his godly role.</P>
<P>It's a hard to imagine a true story being more compelling, more
fascinating than that of the fourteenth Dalai Lama's.  It's also hard to
imagine a film that can grasp it successfully without the intrusion of
Hollywood influence.  Last years Seven years in Tibet was a potential
masterpiece that ended up looking sheepish and frivolous; a potent story
told incorrectly due to miscasting (Brad Pit as an Austrian mountain
climber?) and misinterpretation from the screenplay.  It may have been
an easy to watch, easy to enjoy flick - but it felt too simplified, too
refined to be taken seriously as a mature picture.</P>
<P>If Kundun had fallen victim to the above faults, it would have surely
been one of the biggest missed opportunities of recent years.  But much
to my astonishment, I found that Scorsese never falters in delivering
bounding, gripping cinema.  His vision and enlightenment into the life
of this remarkable human being is truly engaging as both a look at his
personal life, and his god-like life through the eyes of the people
around him.</P>
<P>Even on an optical level, Kundun never fails to triumph.  The lush
Morocco scenery (of course, the Chinese did not allow Scorsese to film
it in Tibet) is beautifully manipulated by cinematographer Roger Deakins
(The Shawshank Redemption, Rob Roy).  Combined with some flashy camera
techniques, the whole production looks pretty darn classy - so if you
can't appreciate Kundun on an intellectual basis, its amazing eye candy
will no doubt be enough to keep you gawking for more.  And if this isn't
enough pleasure for the senses, Philip Glass' swashbuckling music score
is used to great effect.</P>
<P>What is even more impressive is the film's almost perfectly composed
screenplay.  Reportedly, the Dalai Lama gave his input into the 14 draft
scripts written by Melissa Mathison (whose other screenplay credits
include ET: The Extraterrestrial and The Indian in the Cupboard).  What
eventuated is a balanced combination of historical fact and character
development; emotion and integrity.  One scene, when an Indian soldier
asks the Dalai Lama whether he is the Lord Buddha, his carefully placed
answer is given: "I believe I am a reflection, like the moon on water.
When you see me, and I try to be a good man, you see yourself."  But by
then I guess it really made no difference, as Scorsese already had my
heart totally immersed, my mind almost over powered with emotion and
respect for this character who continued to defy textbook expectations.</P>
<P>Just like the astonishing story of a man saving the lives of Jews in
oppression, which of course later became the motion picture Schindlers
List, the tale of the fourteenth Dalai Lama simply needed to be told.
And more than that, it needed to be told well - with respect not only
for the Tibetan Buddhists, but also for westerners who won't want to sit
through a two hour lecture on how good Buddhism is.</P>
<P>Perhaps that's why Martin Scorsese succeeds with Kundun on so many
levels.  If there were any biases, I couldn't spot them - he approaches
the subject matter with wise admiration for the Dalai Lama; not trying
to convince us of the Tibetan way of life but still presenting it to us
vividly and honestly.</P>
<P>A little man named Steven Spielberg once believed that there are two
different things a cinema might show: a movie, or a film.  If his theory
is correct, Kundun joins other moving historical epics like Schindlers
List, in a collection of true "films."</P>
