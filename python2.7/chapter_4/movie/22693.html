<P>It's exciting to own a camera; you can look through your viewfinder and 
comfortably mould life into perfect little rectangular artworks. Click on a 
button, and you've preserved a moment of reality. Cine cameras are even 
better; you've got the means to capture situations in more depth, and hey, 
you're making movies!</P>
<P>The filmmaker Spike Lee got his first cine camera in the Summer of 1977, and 
the imagination of the gifted young New Yorker must have been running wild. 
He must have done a lot of dreaming at that time, a lot of playing with his 
camera, and a lot of important thinking. I'll bet he remembers it well.</P>
<P>Lee's new film "Summer of Sam" is about that summer in his city, and takes a 
lot of time to illustrate the atmosphere. This was the strange, short time 
when disco and punk music were concurrently successful. When the Yankees had 
Reggie Jackson, and were winning the World Series. And when a serial killer 
dubbed 'Son of Sam' was terrorising the Bronx.</P>
<P>'Sam', eventually identified as a crazy mailman named David Berkowitz, 
stalked brunette women, or however they were with, and blew their heads off 
with a .44-caliber pistol. He sent creepy letters about his motives to the 
police, and to newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin; his case made front-page 
news every day; and he was as hot a topic of conversation as the sun, music 
or baseball.</P>
<P>Among those discussing 'Sam' are Lee's main characters, a bunch of 
Italian-American guys who hang out on a street corner all day, letting 
boredom and poverty lead them into talking a lot of crap. Vinny (John 
Leguizamo) is a chain-smoking, disco-dancing hairdresser who can't help but 
cheat on his wife Dionna (Mira Sorvino). His best friend Ritchie (Adrien 
Brody) is losing popularity in the neighbourhood, because of his punk 
hairstyle and his romance with Ruby (Jennifer Esposito), the local slut. Joey 
T (Michael Rispoli), a drug dealer, and his goon Bobby (Brian Tarantino), 
slouch back and watch everything through arrogant eyes, convinced that 
they're better than all the scum out there, and that they'd kick the crap out 
of anyone who wants to try them. </P>
<P>Lee plunges into this community and lingers around to see if any themes 
emerge. "Summer of Sam" is partly recollection, and partly a daydream about 
how elements of summer '77 could have driven people crazy. We get chilling 
glimpses into the apartment of Berkowitz himself, witness the tension and 
ignorance of our guys lead to the feeling that someone in their neighbourhood 
MUST be 'Son of Sam', and watch the lynch mob find its justifications for 
singling out an innocent culprit because he is different from the crowd.</P>
<P>"Summer of Sam" displays much fast cutting, grainy nostalgic footage and 
fancy tricks with lighting and loud music; like most of Lee's work, it's a 
visually and aurally engulfing film. As emotions get tenser, the temperature 
gets hotter, Sam takes more victims and people take too many ludes, Lee ups 
the film's pace, volume and reliance on close-ups, leading us into some 
frightening scenes of vigilante scapegoating.</P>
<P>The film is so involving because it seems to be a dance around Lee's memory 
and imagination. Yes, it falls far short of greatness because it's not really 
about all the themes that it brings up. But Lee has already made one strongly 
plotted examination of the way a community can be pushed over the edge in 
summertime, with his 1989 masterpiece "Do the Right Thing". Here he's trying 
something new. Good on him.</P>
