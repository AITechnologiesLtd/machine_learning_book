SOLAS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Like father, like daughter.   35-year-old María (Ana Fernández) is a 
bitter and angry single woman.  When we meet her father (Paco De Osca), 
he is a mean-spirited grouch who is stuck in the hospital.  He wants 
out, he informs his doctor, so that "I can look after what's mine."  
María's saintly mother (María Galiana), whom María barely tolerates, has 
come to stay with her while her father is in the hospital.</P>
<P>SOLAS, by writer/director Benito Zambrano, would have been more 
appropriately released in the United States under its translated title, 
ALONE, which perfectly captures the message and the mood of this slender 
but touching tale that feels like a short story brought to the screen.</P>
<P>María resents everything, especially her job as a cleaning woman and 
people with more money than her.  Her mother points out that she was a 
cleaning woman and was proud of it.  This only serves to further 
infuriate María.  </P>
<P>A proud woman, María refuses to take money from others but isn't above 
stealing it from her friends.  It is a twisted set of morals that she 
learned from her father.  And like her father, she too is an alcoholic.   
As unlikable as María tries to be, she wins our hearts since you can 
tell that she is a sad product of her environment.  Her father thinks 
that he was a good man because there was always food on the table.  If 
he beat his wife "some," well, so be it.  </P>
<P>The mother, who would only change one unmentioned thing if she had to do 
it all over again (you can guess what that would be), is befriended by a 
sweet widower (Carlos Álvarez-Novoa) who lives in the same apartment 
building as María.  He is the man that the mother deserves but has no 
chance of ever getting.  Nevertheless, they do share a few precious, if 
brief, times together.</P>
<P>If there is a quibble to be made about such a heart-warming tale, it is 
that María dresses and acts a bit too middle-class for all of her 
professed poverty.  But there are no complaints possible about the 
performances, which are all heart-felt and moving.  María's arc in the 
story, while predictable, is nonetheless poignant and honest.  Correctly 
guessing her transformation does not diminish its impact.</P>
<P>"It's dawn," the widower says to his loyal German Shepherd Achilles, as 
they both look out the window.  "God's given us one more day."  He is 
truly thankful for each of his blessings.  And you'll be thankful if you 
are fortunate enough to catch this lovely little story.</P>
<P>SOLAS runs 1:38.  The film is in Spanish with English subtitles.  It is 
not rated but would be an R for mature themes and brief sexuality.</P>
