<PRE>                                  MANHUNTER
                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp

<P>He's a completely different monster than the Wagnerian cannibal glimpsed
in The Silence of the Lambs.  Released five years earlier, Manhunter
(based on the book Red Dragon) views Dr. Hannibal Lecter (spelled
Lektor, here) with clinical restraint, as glimpsed in a clean,
antiseptic white cell.  Respected British actor Brian Cox (Rushmore)
would not be so gauche as to flare his nostrils while smelling you --
he'd catch you off guard, throwing away the line about your cheap after
shave with "a ship on the bottle" with a bemused note of thinly veiled
contempt.</P>
<P>One could discuss Cox's superb performance for the length of an entire
review yet he's only in three crucial scenes opposite his captor,
semi-retired Will Graham (William L. Petersen, To Live and Die in
L.A.).  As in Silence, Graham users Lektor as a vessel to recover the
mindset of tracking serial killers for the FBI.  Lektor's chilly,
sensual brilliance pervades the entire film, taking a psychic toll on
Graham.  Their scenes together alternate between mindfucking stabs
("Dream much, Will?") to vague, unsettling attraction.</P>
<P>The central conflict with Will Graham is his cursed ability to read the
mind of a psychopath, but decoding the mind of a killer is no easy
matter.  Despite the false promises from his friend and supervisor Jack
Crawford (Dennis Farina, Snatch) that he'll only be an advisor, Graham
finds himself once again slipping into old habits.  Before long, he's
empathizing with the killer, which may lead to some major breakthroughs
in the case while tearing Graham's family apart.</P>
<P>The presence of evil haunts Manhunter, intangibly.  The graphic
forensics reports Graham prepares, outlining the macabre crime scenes in
vivid detail, allow the imagination to fill in what happened within the
silent houses and rooms he explores.  Graham flatly describes blood on
the wall from arterial spray as the victim tried to fight, knowing that
the killer was headed for the children's room.</P>
<P>As serial killer Francis Dollarhyde, Tom Noonan (What Happened Was...)
is given the role of a lifetime.  Introduced at the midpoint of Graham's
search, this fiend is both demigod and terrified child trapped within a
shy, soft-spoken introvert.  Noonan brings an odd, unpredictable
stillness to the role, whether softly threatening to staple a victim's
eyelids to their forehead or making tender, awkward advances on a blind,
fiercely independent co-worker (Joan Allen, The Ice Storm).  Dollarhyde
is viewed with cool restraint, biding his time until unveiling his
twisted fantasy to transform into a God without remorse.</P>
<P>Michael Mann, well regarded for his minute attention to technical as
well as psychological detail, is very specific with the FBI procedures. 
There is a fascinating sequence concerning dusting a victim's eyes for
fingerprints and another in which the experts scan a handwritten note
from the killer, using infrared lasers to pick up details invisible to
the human eye.</P>
<P>While certain elements of Manhunter are slightly dated, such as
overdressed cops and the ever-present synthesizer score, Dante
Spinotti's crisp visuals still resonate.  His vaguely unsettling angles
often cramp actors into the corners of a shot.  The color scheme is
filled with rich, saturated hues that envelop images in a glossy,
pungent web.  Mann and Spinotti make extensive use of mirrors and
shadows, often framing Graham's reflection in glass during crucial
moments of duress.</P>
<P>Graham's investigation leads to a harrowing confrontation with
Dollarhyde, the troubled beast he had long envisioned on paper.  This
crucial meeting is symbolized by Graham smashing through a glass
doorway, breaking the thin mirror that kept them separate (at least in
Graham's mind).  Unsubtle, perhaps, but after two hours of slow burning
intensity the explosive moment feels earned (accompanied by Iron
Butterfly's surprisingly effective In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida).</P>
<P>The most perceptive scene is not the appropriately grisly finale or even
the company of Dr. Lektor.  It's a brief discussion between Graham and
his stepson (David Seaman) walking through the long aisles of a
supermarket.  The boy asks a few wary questions about Lektor's crimes
and their effect on Graham, who recovered through a long period in a
mental institution.  Graham must provide honest answers while protecting
the child from the horrific details.  Petersen finds the right balance,
investing the scene with careful tenderness.</P>
<P>The release of Manhunter on a limited edition DVD is meant to coincide
with Ridley Scott's Hannibal, the long anticipated sequel to Jonathan
Demme's eerie Silence of the Lambs.  Despite the appearance of Dr.
Lecter/Lektor, there's no guarantee of a crossover fan base.  Manhunter
lacks catchy one-liners about eating someone's liver with fava beans and
a nice chianti (fh-fh-fh-fh), nor does it present cold blooded
psychopaths as pop culture icons befitting a t-shirt.</P>
<P>Instead, Michael Mann unnerves his viewers with this psychologically
slippery, contemplative and disturbing thriller about a detective
searching under his own skin for the criminal impulse.  As Lektor
reminds Graham, "The reason you caught me is we're just alike.  You want
the scent?  Smell yourself."  As Graham ultimately discovers, once you
enter the mind of the killer, you may never return.</P>
