<P>This film could also have been titled "Deep Thoughts" by Terrence Malick.
The recluse director, who actually beats fellow recluse director Stanley
Kubrick in the number of years elapsed between movies (Malick's last film
was 20 years ago, while Kubrick's only dates back 13), returns to Hollywood
with a solid cast of names, and an attempt to recapture his brilliance from
BADLANDS and DAYS OF HEAVEN.</P>
<P>PLOT:
This film takes place in the Second World War during the Battle of
Guadalcanal. We specifically follow a set of soldiers as they attempt to
break the Japanese stronghold on a giant hill, while listening to their
words of wisdom, and breathing in the lush scenery.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This film may just be the best-looking movie of the year. It may also
contain a solid cast of actors, effective tension when required, and a
life-like feel of being in the bush with the boys. Unfortunately for this
170-minute, overdone, ode to philosophical poetry, this movie just doesn't
muster up enough real interest, plot development or character attachment,
for anyone to give too much of a crap about its existential insights.
There is a reoccurring narration that permeates the entire movie as the
supposed thoughts of the soldiers, which is supposed to make us ponder life,
death and everything in between. All it did for me was tinker the strings of
boredom, as the long pauses between the words had me losing track of most of
what was said, and feel like I was at a poetry hearing, instead of a movie
theater. The last third of the film is especially guilty of this offense, as
the director seemed to have overdosed on his own indulgences, and simply
shot exquisite sceneries, and inserted scattered scenes of the boys and
their apres-winning shenanigans. "Too many vague queries, and not enough
developed thoughts make JoBlo a very uninterested boy."</P>
<P>Acting-wise, this movie is rock-solid, with the lesser named actors pulling
off the best gigs, as Jim Caviezel, Adrien Brody, Ben Chaplin and Elias
Koteas stole the show from the rest of the big names. Within the better
known clique, Nick Nolte jerked off an effective Colonel Tall, with his
grimy impression of a man who lived to bark out orders and thrived on
adversity. And if you're actually thinking of checking into this movie, in
the hopes of seeing your favorite actor, John Travolta or George Clooney, in
action, then I suggest you think thrice about your move, cause they
respectively carry five and one minute screen times in this ocular
air-wafer. All in all, I would say that this film is a visual pearl caught
up in a masturbatory web of overly-profound drivel, which is meant to
stimulate the mind, but ultimately stretches itself too long, and into
indifference. Having said that, the first couple of hours are pretty good,
notably the tense-filled "battle for the hill", and actors solid. So if
you're in the mood for Kierkegaard, I guess this movie might be your
prescribed trip, as long as you don't forget to bring your weed, beret and
"thinker" glasses :)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actors Lukas Haas and Bill Pullman respectively played the roles of
"Newcomer" and Supply Sgt. MacTae in this film, before their scenes were
deleted by the director during the editing process.
After 1978's DAYS OF HEAVEN, director Terrence Malick apparently split his
time between Paris and Texas, supporting himself with lucrative, although
uncredited, screenwriting assignments. One such assignment had him helping
out the "wonder twins", Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, on their Oscar-winning
script for GOOD WILL HUNTING (7.5/10). Malick went to St. Stephen's high
school in Austin, Texas, where he played football, and then to Harvard. He
was a Rhodes Scholar. In his contract for directing this film, he stated
that no current pictures of him could be published or shown anywhere.
It took the producers ten years to get this story to film. The story rights
were bought from the author's (James Jones) wife in 1988.
Actor Nicolas Cage might also have starred in this film, were it not for a
little mix-up in telephone messages between him and Terrence Malick. The
misunderstanding ultimately left Malick feeling slighted by Cage for not
returning his call, and Cage feeling sorry because he never got the message.
There was a film in 1998 called A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER NEVER CRIES, which was
a biopic on the life of "A Thin Red Line" novelist James Jones, written by
his daughter, Kaylie.
Although some shooting for this film was actually done in the Guadalcanal
Island, most of the film was shot around Port Douglas in Queensland,
Australia.
The script for this movie was apparently 213 pages long, shot over 123 days,
and held a budget of $50Million.
Actor Elias Koteas was born in my hometown of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
Actor Jim Caviezel's feature film debut was as an airline clerk in Gus Van
Sant's 1991 film MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO (7.5/10).</P>
