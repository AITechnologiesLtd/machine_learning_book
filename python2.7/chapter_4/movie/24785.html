<P>"..We may be finished with the past, but the past is not finished with us.."
- MAGNOLIA</P>
<P>Paul T. Anderson's 'Magnolia' is truly an exotic flower, dazzling with its
freshness and beauty. And the closer you look, the more you see of its
splendor. Other critics have already written many reviews depicting its
length and dullness. There are many stories. Some even fall asleep in the
theatre. So if you were discouraged by such remarks, think again! Because
this picture is one of the most interesting and original films of the year.</P>
<P>To sum up 'Magnolia' is impossible and unnecessary, since I trust you'll see
this film anyway, but I'll try. On one random day in the San Fernando
Valley, a dying father (Jason Robards), a young wife (Julianne Moore), a
male caretaker (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a famous lost son (Tom Cruise), a
police officer in love (John C. Reilly), a boy genius (Jeremy Blackman), an
ex-boy genius (William H. Macy), a wealthy game show host (Philip Baker
Hall) and an estranged daughter (Melora Walters ) will each become part of a
dazzling multiplicity of plots, but one story. Through a collusion of
coincidence, chance, human action, shared media, past history and divine
intervention they will weave and warp through each other's lives on a day
that builds to an unforgettable climax. Some will seek forgiveness, others
escape. Some will mend frayed bonds, others will be exposed. Magnolia is a
mosaic of American life woven through a series of comic and poignant
vignettes. It is a portrait of a lonely city sometimes called up short on
love. It is a personal exploration of the hidden elements of crisis. It is a
story about putting things right again.</P>
<P>P.T. Anderson had his debut with "Boogey Nights" in 1997 -- a strong and
shocking peek into the porn industry. As many other original films, it was
underrated and unfairly treated, robbing Anderson for a deserved Oscar
nomination. "Magnolia" is his second venture into the world of filmmaking.
Anderson is an "actors' director". His cast consists of many great stars and
some not so great ones, but everyone gives an award worthy performance.
That includes Julianne Moore as the hysterical young beauty, Jason Robards
as the alienated and forgotten father. And then you have Tom Cruise , that
gives a mesmerizing and completely unexpected performance that is probably
the best I've seen this year. He plays Frank Mackey, a sex-guru that has
gained enormous popularity in the "underground". He is the leader of
confused men that are scared, hurt or dumped by women. His only problem,
underneath the sparkling facade, is dealing with his past. This is Tom as
you've never seen him - with a pony tail, leather clothes and an energy that
would make Muhamed Ali look like a slow turtle in comparison, Cruise
magnetizes the audience with his best performance in years. The reason that
the acting is at such high level has a lot to do with Anderson's fabulous
script. He creates characters that are so colorful and real, that they
almost jump out of the screen. There is a cop - an idealist that lives to
help people out of trouble. He dreams of a perfect world. Despite of his
goodness and genuine kindness, he is unappreciated and unlucky.
Coincidentally (?) he meets a girl and falls in love, but is too clumsy and
shy to tell her how he feels. There is a wiz-kid that can answer any
question, besides how to win his father's love. There is a young wife that
married her husband for money and only realizes that she really loves him
when he is dying. You really want these guys to be well, so that they can
finally find happiness.</P>
<P>'Magnolia' has resemblance to 'Eyes Wide Shut', in its story and character
development and surrealistic components. The film starts fast, almost
hysterically, with cameras moving quickly back and forth, and events
overlapping. After a while Anderson slows down and we can dive into these
people, although we only get to see one day of their lives. Each person and
event is like one unique beautiful leaf, each sprung out of one common
source, that somehow binds and connects them. It is simply a different
expression. You can't just observe it from a distance. You have to let
yourself go, and when Anderson has you, he doesn't let go. And then you'll
cry and laugh and walk out of the theatre enlightened.</P>
<P>"Magnolia" is a day in our lives. A fragment. It is a story about love,
regret and forgiveness. It is about coincidences and how they affect our
lives. It questions whether things "just happen" or whether everything is a
part of a big and complex plan. Is the universe laughing with us or at us?
Chance or Fate? Coincidence or Destiny? Yes, strange things do happen.</P>
