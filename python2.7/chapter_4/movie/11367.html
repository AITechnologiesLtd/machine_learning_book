<PRE>SWEPT FROM THE SEA
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>

<PRE>        How could I not love "Swept from the Sea"?</PRE>
<P>        First and foremost it's a love story, and I'm a sucker for one of
those.  It's also a period romance set in England, land of my birth, with
the northern wilds of Yorkshire (county of my birth) doubling for some of
the bleak, windswept Cornish locales.  And it features a lush, romantic
score by John Barry, the British composer whose music puts the icing on my
proverbial cake.  Heck, one of the dialogue coaches--Sandra
Butterworth--even bears my name.</P>
<PRE>        So did I love it?  I did not.</PRE>
<P>        That's too bad, because "Swept from the Sea" is far from
unwatchable.  The scenery is quite spectacular--Dick Pope's cinematography
brings the typically wet English locations to life, from surf pounding
against the craggy, desolate cliffs to rain pelting down on the tiny
coastal village.  The actors are equally attractive (I didn't say wet).
Not just the leads, Vincent Pérez and Rachel Weisz, but the supporting
performers too--Ian McKellen, Joss Ackland, and Kathy Bates.  Very
colorful.  And then there's the music, of course.  Full, rich, and
evocative.  Typical Barry.</P>
<P>        Part of the problem is the story.  It's just not much of one.
Based on a short story by Joseph Conrad, "Swept from the Sea" tells the
tale of Yanko, the soul survivor of an immigrant vessel bound for
"A-may-reeka" that flounders off the Cornish coast, and Amy Foster, the
servant girl with whom he falls in love.  Amy is an outcast and the
townsfolk are mean to Yanko because they don't like his "But I've just been
shipwrecked, dammit!" looks or understand his balmy accent.  But that's
about it.   Did I mention it's a *short* story?  There's not enough plot to
flesh out the film's overly long running time.</P>
<P>        Fortunately we've got Cornwall to look at and Barry's score to
listen to.</P>
<P>        Amy is distant and aloof, a spurned free spirit who uses silence as
a defense mechanism.  She likes to dance in the rain and wade through
tidepools looking for stuff for her collection, kind of like Ariel in "The
Little Mermaid."  The locals think she's simple, or simply crazy.  Amy does
a lot of staring and mopes around without saying very much but it doesn't
make for blistering drama.  Yanko, too, is distant and aloof and the silent
type but because he's foreign, a traveler from a remote region of the
Carpathian mountains.  This makes relating to the young lovers a bit of a
challenge since empathizing with or even understanding them is difficult.</P>
<P>        Pérez and Weisz aren't exactly household names and are unlikely to
become such on the strength of "Swept from the Sea."  They both turn in
creditable performances, but the characters they play seem strangely devoid
of passion; their love never really ignites on screen, it smolders a
little, then goes out.  Director Beeban Kidron should have thrust them
together more often; their one erotic scene together--in Amy's secret
grotto--is awkwardly handled, as if the actors themselves felt embarrassed.</P>
<P>        I did enjoy McKellen's role, as the doctor who befriends Yanko and
improves his own chess game in the process.  (Aha!  Yanko must be
*Russian*, Dr. Kennedy explains when Yanko shows him a move or two.
Russians are most excellent chess players.)  Mad.  Russian.  What's the
diff?  Ackland and Bates offer predictably staunch support but, sadly,
there's not much meat here.</P>
