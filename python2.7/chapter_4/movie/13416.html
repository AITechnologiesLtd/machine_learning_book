<PRE>"Small Soldiers" - Military Toy Fair Makes Amusing Warfare
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Forget about GI Joe.  Those action figures are now a thing of the past.
Today, a new generation of fighting toys are more gruff, rough and buff.
They have scowls a mile long.  And, they possess a sophisticated
microchip that enables them to talk, move about, and display other
characteristics that makes them seem alarmingly alive.  These are the
Commando Elite, led by Chip Hazard (voiced by Tommy Lee Jones).  Barking
out a melange of patriotic clichés ("ask not what your country can do
for you, but that you have only one live to give"), he leads his troop
of warmongering-named soldiers like Butch Meathook, Nick Nitro, and
Brick Bazooka on their one and only mission.  They are to destroy the
Gorgonites, an odd assortment of drawing board rejects whose greatest
talent is finding places to hide.  Gorgonites are also equipped with
these sophisticated microchips, but are programmed to lose in battle.
Led by the majestic lion-like Archer (voiced by Frank Langella), their
mission is to find freedom.</P>
<P>Young Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith), son of a toy store owner, manages
to get his hands on these figures before the rest of the world.  But
once the Commando Elite and the Gorgonite action figures are unpacked
within close proximity of each other, the toys take on a life of their
own.  The miniature military men begin to hunt down their prey.  Archer
appeals to Alan for help, who agrees to protect the Gorgonites.  This
alliance infuriates Chip Hazard, and he and the Commando Elite begin to
formulate a plan which involves building lots of small-scale yet
surprisingly harmful weapons, transforming skateboards and wagons into
military vehicles, and a plot to kidnap Alan's love interest (Kirsten
Dunst).</P>
<P>This movie is a little boy's imagination running wild.  The Commando
Elite use tremendous creativity to construct weapons such as a bomb made
from aerosol cans, a helicopter that launches bottle rockets and weapons
that fire staples and nails.  They are also genuinely threatening, which
may make this film somewhat frightening for the little ones even though
this movie about toys.  These soldiers are menacing and even ruthless at
times.  Trying to carry out their mission using any and all means
possible, there is a lot of destruction and mayhem in this film.  Not
much time is devoted to the interesting relationship between Archer and
Alan.  It's basically an all-out blitzkrieg of toy soldiers programmed
to annihilate the Gorgonites and their human allies.  Consequently, it
seems that only teenage boys would really like this kind of film.</P>
<P>Despite it's narrow appeal, this film is something of an enjoyable
curiosity spawned from the recesses of someone's inner child.  It's not
family-oriented affair such as Toy Story.  And it's certainly not
adult-oriented action fare either.  It falls somewhere in the murky
middle.  "Small Soldiers" is for the rebellious little kid that once
lived inside of us who enjoyed little green army men, raced Hot Wheels
and Matchbox cars, and loved the Autobots and Decepticons.</P>
<PRE>Grade:         B- (if you're a guy)
