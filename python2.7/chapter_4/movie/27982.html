<P>PLOT:
It's 1942 and Hitler's German army is making their way across Europe and
Russia. The city of Stalingrad is now in play and the Russians are losing
soldiers in droves. But along comes a young Russian sniper who starts
dropping German leaders like peanuts. The Germans worry and bring in their
own top sniper to whack out the Russian. The two men square off in a beaten
down city as the war rages on around them.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A very tense, cold, authentic-looking movie, featuring an engaging
mano-a-mano battle between two captivating characters and stars, Ed Harris
and Jude Law, many stunning artillery sequences and enough unpleasantries to
turn anyone off to war forever. Here's a movie which takes place during the
second world war, but isn't really about the war at all. This film focuses
solely on the smaller battle within the grander fight for Stalingrad,
featuring two marksmen searching for one another amid the greater chaos. A
concept which might not sound too exciting on paper but once you're in the
theater, this film pulls you in and dropkicks you across enemy lines. It
starts with yet another awesome combat sequence a la SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,
planes dropping bombs, soldiers getting drilled by bullets, pandemonium all
around, but quickly, the story's foundation is revealed to you. Here are the
Russians getting their asses whupped by the Germans and along comes a small
town dude with an ability to strike things down from afar. Is he the hero
needed to boost the morale of the Russian troops? You bet, and the film
really gives you that sense of despair, that lack of leadership and that
much needed fighting spirit required from the Russians. And then of
course...there's Jude Law. What else could a film as such ask for?</P>
<P>Here's a great looking man, admired widely by both sexes, oozing more of his
on-screen persona in this film and then upping the ante with a solid showing
as the sniper who may not be the person that everyone believes him to be.
Here's a character shown to be human with weaknesses of the heart and the
soul. A man caught up in something larger than himself, but able to come to
the forefront and do the things which he believes will help his country win.
Kudos to Law for holding up his end, Joseph Fiennes for coming through as
his nerdy comrade, and the ever-stoic Ed Harris for keeping his eye focused
and standing firm as Law's persistent adversary. This is also a film of
moments. As you might expect, a film focusing on two snipers is likely to
have a few scenes featuring guys staring each other down. And this one does
have plenty of those. But because of the strength of its characters, the
believability of its surroundings, its sheer grandness and its tight story
line, you cannot help but be truly engaged in every second of this film's
suspenseful moments. This movie might not have the grand scope of a SAVING
PRIVATE RYAN, the deep message of a PLATOON, or the poetry of the depressing
THE THIN RED LINE, but it does succeed in telling an interesting story and
delivering on various fronts of entertainment as well. There is also a wide
richness of detail in the film, a superb score which resonates way past the
film's unique credit crawl and some across the board eye-opening
cinematography.</P>
<P>This film was a definite treat for me, especially in the year of crapola
movies thus far. Here's a picture that gives you lots to look at, lots to
pay attention to and lots to care about. And yes, they've even added a small
romance angle for the ladies, which thankfully didn't take up much of the
film's runtime and is, for the most part, credible and touching. A grand
movie filled with suspense, impressive visuals and an absorbing story line!</P>
