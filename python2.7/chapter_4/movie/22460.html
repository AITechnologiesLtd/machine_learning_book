<P>The Mask of Zorro
<A HREF="http://www.ram.org/ramblings/movies/the_mask_of_zorro.html">http://www.ram.org/ramblings/movies/the_mask_of_zorro.html</A></P>
<P>I used to read a lot of Zorro comic books, and like Batman and
Phantom, Zorro is a normal human without any extraordinary super powers
fighting to overcome injustice and oppression.  /The Mask of Zorro/ is
an exciting tale that occurs a bit after the original Zorro years, and
unlike recent movies about the other two characters, this one is done
more in the style of the early novels and comic books.</P>
<P>The film begins in 1821 (the Zorro character himself was introduced in
1919). Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins), the original Zorro, is
finally baited and captured by his arch enemy Don Rafael Montero
(Stuart Wilson). Montero's attempt to capture Zorro results in de la
Vega's wife being killed and Montero adopts de la Vega's infant
daughter as his own.</P>
<P>Fast forward twenty years. Montero returns from exile with an evil
plot to turn California into an independent Republic.  This enrages de
la Vega who escapes from prison and begins planning his revenge.  He
runs into Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas) who once help saved
Zorro's life and who now has a grudge against Montero's right-hand
man.  De la Vega begins training Murrieta to become his successor and
Murrieta begins wearing the mask and thwarting Montero's plans.  As he
does this, Montero's adopted daughter Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones),
who is now all grown up (and how), runs into the new Zorro and sparks
fly. You can fill in the blanks.</P>
<P>The action in the film is cheesy, but it is good cheese. It is
refreshing to see that, in this day where action scenes involve
numerous explosions and crashes and death-defying stunts, the scenes
in /The Mask of Zorro/ rely on good old-fashioned choreography and
inventiveness to liven things up. In particular, the scenes are all
done comic-book style, where things happen that are highly unrealistic
but are acceptable only from a panel-by-panel perspective (for
example, the classic use of Zorro's sword as though it were a man to
mark whatever he chooses).  The acting is pretty good, and both
Banderas and Zeta-Jones are good looking people with plenty of
charisma and chemistry.  The dialogue is humourous and irreverent and
the naturally-filmed cinematography is bright and attractive.</P>
<P>Due to rather odd circumstances, I only got to see the second half of
/The Mask of Zorro/ and what I saw was pretty cool. Definitely worth
renting.</P>
