<PRE>.                                DEEP IMPACT
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<PRE>     I admit it.  I'm a sap for the touchy-feely business sometimes.</PRE>
<P>     DEEP IMPACT makes no apologies for being a sob-fest.  I mean, how else
do you smash a comet into the earth without killing off a few hundred
million people, and breaking a few hearts in the process?  As the first
disaster-from-space film of the year, DEEP IMPACT sets the bar at an
interesting level.  It's not an action film, although it has action
elements.  It's not a thriller, although suspense is in the mix.  It's more
a drama than anything else, the main story lines being a reporter (Leoni)
estranged from her father, a young astronomer (Wood) who finds he can't
abandon his girlfriend, and a codgery astronaut (Duvall) who gains
acceptance among a younger crew.</P>
<P>     Against the backdrop of a giant comet en route to the planet, it's a
surprise that there are so many lulls in the story where there's little to
do but check your watch.  Still, ER veteran Leder directs the action with
sufficient flair to keep you interested and keep those Kleenex in action.</P>
<P>     I'm not immune.  Once you get past the urge to dismiss the whole
shebang as an unlikely bit of Hollywood trickery, there are so many
sacrifices in the film from so many characters... even a cynic like me can
get a bit teary-eyed.</P>
<P>     Overall, it's a refreshing change of pace from the big budget
extravangzas that Tinseltown regularly trots out.</P>
