<P>     This just in:  Matthew McConaughey has already won the 1997 Best
Actor Oscar, will be on the cover of every magazine published in the
English language, and has been named Time's Man of the Year.  Those
suggestions should be absurd, but the way Warner Bros. is pushing John
Grisham's anointed one, they're merely the next logical step.  It's one
thing to be the Flavor of the Month, but McConaughey has become the Flavor
of Next Month, a star without a previous starring role.  That's a rather
unfair burden to place on an actor, but now that A TIME TO KILL is finally
here, it looks like the talent is up to the hype.  Leading an exceptional
cast, Matthew McConaughey helps create some riveting moments in an
occasionally melodramatic story.</P>
<P>     McConaughey plays Jake Brigance, a young lawyer in Canton,
Mississippi struggling to keep his practice afloat.  With bills to pay and
a family to support, Jake needs a big case, and he is about to find one.
Following the rape of a 10-year-old black girl by two white men, the
girl's father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) guns the two men down
before their arraignment, and now faces first-degree murder charges.  And
if it isn't bad enough that Hailey is a black man accused of murdering two
white men, he faces an ambitious district attorney (Kevin Spacey) who is
cozy with the trial judge (Patrick McGoohan).  Jake takes the case,
assisted only by law student Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock), but a lack of
resources may be the least of his problems when the brother of one of the
murdered men (Kiefer Sutherland) sets out to teach Jake -- and anyone
close to him -- a lesson.</P>
<P>     There is a fundamental problem which prevents A TIME TO KILL from
being a truly exceptional film, and it comes down to three letters:  KKK.
White supremacists are the Nazis of the 90s; film makers love them because
they know we love to hate them, and because they don't have to worry about
anyone protesting if they are portrayed as hissable cartoons.  But somehow
it detracts from the racial tensions at the heart of A TIME TO KILL to
have cross-burning, linen-wearing good ol' boys at the center of them.
There are plenty of complex issues involved in the story of A TIME TO
KILL, foremost among them the criminal justice system's entrenched racial
inequities, but director Joel Schumacher and his frequent screenwriting
collaborator Akiva Goldsman can't resist the impulse to be crowd-pleasers,
providing plenty of moments for audience members to applaud Klansmen being
beaten, spit upon, arrested or otherwise mocked, all underscored by Elliot
Goldenthal's strident strings.</P>
<P>     It is too bad that A TIME TO KILL needed the sneering evil and
repetitive cruelty of overt racists like Sutherland's character, and even
the poorly developed sub-plot involving the involvement of the NAACP,
because it is so much better at exploring its more three-dimensional
characters.  Samuel L. Jackson is superb as Carl Lee, a shaken man trying
to get some small piece of his life back.  Goldsman gives him a great
speech late in the film in which he forces Jake to confront his own racist
feelings, and what makes Jackson's delivery so potent is that there is so
little anger in it; he has come to an understanding of the gulf race
places between them.  Sandra Bullock, given an extremely misleading first
billing, turns in what may be her best work yet as the cocky legal prodigy
who smells a ticket to notoriety in the much-publicized case, and there
are memorable supporting turns by Oliver Platt (as a lovably unscrupulous
friend and colleague of Jake's) and Chris Cooper (as a sheriff's deputy
caught in Carl Lee's line of fire) among a handful of others.  A TIME TO
KILL is exceedingly well cast, and the performances sparkle.</P>
<P>     Then there is Matthew McConaughey.  He is being compared to everyone
from Paul Newman to Marlon Brando to Kevin Costner, but none of those
comparisons really does justice to his unique appeal.  There is an
absolute ease to his acting which you almost never see in actors his age
(McConaughey is a ripe old 26), along with a screen presence you rarely
see in actors of any age.  His Jake is a bit of an idealist and a bit of a
scoundrel; it's hard to get inside his head, but it's easy to like him.
And in a film which features a few too many loud and obvious scenes,
McConaughey is absolutely electrifying in a scene which is emotionally
crippling in its quiet power:  Jake describing the rape of Carl Lee's
daughter to the jury in graphic detail.  It is almost possible to accept
that Spacey's savvy prosecutor doesn't object to the obviously
inflammatory remarks.  Perhaps he, like us, was simply transfixed by
witnessing the birth of a star.</P>
