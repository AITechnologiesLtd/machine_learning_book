<PRE>                               LAST NIGHT
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     It's six hours until the end of the world, and Bruce Willis, Robert
Duvall, and Will Smith are nowhere in sight.  The world is *really gonna
end* -- so what do you do with those six hours?</P>
<P>     I rarely read film production notes, but writer/director/star Don
McKellar's introduction to LAST NIGHT caught my eye this time.  I quote,
`The world is ending, once again.  But this time, in my movie, there is
no overburdened loner duking it out with the asteroid, no presidents or
generals turning the tables on extra-terrestrials.  Those heroes are out
there, somewhere, one hopes, but I was interested in the rest of us
suckers-hapless individuals who, with limited access to nuclear
resources, would have to come to terms with the fast-approaching
finale.'</P>
<P>     This is heady stuff.  I've long toyed with the idea of writing a
black comedy set on the eve of our destruction, but always abandoned the
idea because it's just too maudlin.  Atom Egoyan veteran McKellar
doesn't completely escape that sentiment in this film, but he does a
commendable job at taking what might be the most difficult of subjects
and turning it into something that's enjoyable to watch.</P>
<P>     Reminiscent of SHORT CUTS in many ways, LAST NIGHT follows the
intertwined stories of the last six hours in the lives of several
people.  McKellar takes the lead as Patrick, a troubled man who has to
deal with his family (including sister Polly), sex-crazed friend Craig
(Rennie), and lost lamb Sandra (Oh), who's trying to get home in time so
she and her husband can kill each other before midnight, when the world
will go away (in a mysterious fate).</P>
<P>     None of this is played to comedy – well, maybe a *little* comedy,
and before long, the world has indeed ended for what might be the first
time on film, and everyone's life has changed along the way (you know,
before they died).</P>
<P>     LAST NIGHT is heavy filmmaking, but it rewards the patient viewer.
It's deep and thoughtful, and quite sleepy in parts, but McKellar, in
his directorial debut, has done an admirable job.  I know I couldn't
have done it.</P>
