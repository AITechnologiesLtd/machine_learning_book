<P>It seems as though mega-producer Jerry Bruckheimer is stretching his wings a
little this year with two follow-up films to his typical summertime macho
fest flick GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS. The first was COYOTE UGLY, a T&A film
disguised as a "woman's story" (or the other way around), and the second is
this movie, a real-life drama based on the forced integration of blacks and
whites in the early 70s.</P>
<P>So you're probably asking yourself, "What do you mean? No T&A? No loud
booming soundtrack? No hyped-up editing jobs? Es tu, Bruckheimer?" It's sad
but true, my friends, Mr. Jerry Bruckheimer has slipped over to the other
side of filmmaking and finally decided to make a movie that actually means
something! Bravo, sir! PS: Just don't ever forget your bread and butter,
Jerry... :)</P>
<P>PLOT:
Based on a true story set in 1971, a black coach is hired to take over a
newly integrated football team of black and white students. The old white
coach is kept on as his assistant, while everybody from the players, to the
coaches, to the townspeople have trouble adjusting to the forced racial
integration. Racism and intolerance follow as the coach attempts to whip
everybody into shape as one team working towards the same goal.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A well-packaged, well-acted, well-intentioned feel good movie that brings
nothing new to the table yet still manages to pull you into its wonderful
world of harmony. It is important to note that as with all films of this
nature, there is always a very fine line between sappy melodrama, selling it
all on the "TV movie of the week" mentality, and a real story with an honest
to goodness message. This film manages to ride that fine line very well for
most of the way through, primarily due to its solid cast, steady pace, no
major lulls or sermons delivered here, and Denzel Washington, who once more,
checks in with another outstanding performance. Of course, many will say
that Denzel isn't exactly stretching his acting muscles here, playing the
straight-talking leader-man once again, and surely, all of these people will
have a point. But the bottom line is the bottom line and the bottom line in
this case is that the charisma and talent combined in this one man is what
make this entire story stick together to such a greater extent, and that's
really all that matters.</P>
<P>Of course, the story itself is also an important one. Such extreme racial
divide still prevalent in the 70s. Who knew? Certainly not me, at least not
to this sad-sack extent (Segregated restaurants? Yikes!). And despite most
of the basic plot points of the film having been seen a thousand times
before (too many clichés to enumerate here), I was totally "into" this movie
because I cared about the people in it and the situations presented within.
Why, you might ask? Simply put, the director seems to have perfectly molded
all of the ideal elements needed to create an entertaining picture. He took
the cliches and mixed them in with a great cast. All solid actors across the
board, many of whom are given a three-dimensional quality for you to care
about. Added some needed humor, a quick pace, which may have otherwise
dulled people to death, captivating football scenes, sympathetic characters
on all sides, and ultimately, a profound message which you can't help but
root for in the end. "It's not the outside of a person that counts...it's
the inside". Sappy, right? You've heard it a million times, right? Well, so
had I, but this film still had me sogging up my nachos, an event that occurs
only once or twice every year.</P>
<P>Ultimately, I think this film was helped by the fact that it was based on a
true story because of that added sense of security, knowing that it all
really happened, investing more in the characters. And as per most true-life
movie tales, and my personal favorite part of all these films, an excellent
"where are they now" summary completed the presentation of this movie. I
love that! Woo-hoo! Great move, Boaz! So if you're a parent, bring the kids.
And if you're a kid, bring your parents. And if you're a jaded movie geek
just looking to rip into a movie that doesn't really offer much originality
but does more than make up for it with an outstanding cast and message, I
say...stay home. Don't ruin this one for the rest of us.</P>
