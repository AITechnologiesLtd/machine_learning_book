<PRE>Run Lola Run
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4) RUN LOLA RUN is the filmic equivalent of techno dance
music. There is never a gap between tracks and never a slow moment for
rest. It's all rhythm, style, and energy. There's not much you'd call a
melody, but then that's not what this style calls for.</P>
<P>Lola (Franka Potente) gets a phone call from her boyfriend Manni (Moritz
Bleibtreu). The crime they were supposed to be in on together went down
as planned, but Lola wasn't there to give him a getaway ride. Manni had
to take the train into town with the bag of loot. When the cops boarded
the train, he got off out of habit, only he forgot the bag. Now some bum
has the money and Manni has to tell the boss that he lost the money. He
knows for sure he's going to die. </P>
<P>Lola tells Manni to hold on. She'll be there ASAP to set things right.
She spends the next 20 minutes of film time running through the streets,
stopping only at her father's bank to ask for money. She arrives at
Manni's location just one second too late.</P>
<P>Manni walks into a grocery store to rob it so he can pay the big boss.
The robbery goes bad and the two end up dead. Lola screams "STOP!" and
the movie starts over again.</P>
<P>Lola runs through two more iterations of the same scenario with varying
results. The differences are both subtle and grand. Are the scenarios
alternate universes? Are they imagined? Are they three separate films?
That question is never answered, nor is it important to the enjoyment of
the movie, because it's all about form and style.</P>
<P>It's all form because the film's shape is a carefully structured
trident. It CAN come across as Tykwer's cheap way to avoid having to
write a real plot. But that's like saying there's no melody in techno
dance music. It's not that the plot is MISSING, it's that it was
deliberately de-emphasized.</P>
<P>It's all style because specific shots use stylistic techniques like
video footage, split-screen POVs, and even animation. Even WITHIN the
frame the importance of style is evident in the gothic clocks ticking
off the seconds, and in Lola's flowing, magenta hair and offsetting
green pants. It can come across as haphazard and gratuitous, except that
it permeates every corner of the screen, every second of the film. I'm
confident repeat viewings would reveal a method to Tykwer's stylistic
madness.</P>
<P>Does it sound frustrating? Do you get annoyed at movies that are all
style and no plot? Then don't see it.</P>
<PRE>STOP!</PRE>
<P>Does it sound intriguing? Do you get sucked in by movies that ignore the
rules and make new ones? Then don't miss it.</P>
