<PRE>Alien 3</PRE>
<PRE>Chad'z rating: ** (out of 4 = fair)</PRE>
<P>1992, R, 115 minutes [1 hour, 55 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[science fiction]</PRE>
<P>starring: Sigourney Weaver (Ripley), Charles S. Dutton (Dillon), Charles
Dance (Clemens), Paul McGann (Golic); written by David Giler, Walter Hill,
Larry Ferguson, Vincent Ward; produced by Gordon Carroll, Walter Hill, David
Giler; directed by David Fincher; based on characters created by Dan
O'Bannon, Ronald Shusett.</P>
<P>Seen November 23, 1997 on home video (borrowed from my sister's roommate).</P>
<P>During the opening credits to "Alien 3" I could tell it was going to be
different from the others in the series, and that gave me high hopes. And
there is a major difference here that is somewhat of a relief, but at the
same time the difference is the problem. If the other films failed from
excessiveness, this one fails from depravity and blandness.</P>
<P>Like the first two films, the opening sequence has the credits appearing
over the void of space. But this time they are intercut with quick images of
something strange happening on the ship Ripley (Weaver) and the survivors
used to escape from the alien planet. And wouldn't you know it - one of those
pesky aliens somehow got on the ship too. </P>
<P>Ripley's ship crash lands on a desolate planet used as a prison for violent
criminals, who seem to have formed some sort of cult. They have little
technology but manage to save only Ripley.</P>
<P>The first third is extremely slow in its storytelling. Almost nothing
happens in terms of plot development, instead we just get interaction between
Ripley and the prison doctor, Clemens (Dance), and the cult leader Dillon
(Dutton). The alien itself is barely shown, only in the shadows, and in
disorienting shots at that (how original). Somehow a larvae is imbedded in a
dog's body, and during a scene in which Ripley, Clemens, and Dillon cremate
the bodies of Newt and Hicks, we see it be "born" while Dillon recites an
eerie eulogy.</P>
<P>At first I was intrigued by the Gothic atmosphere here, and the
aforementioned scenes built up  at least some suspense. It's clear Fincher
wants to do something different, and for that I applaud him. However, just
when he had us in the palm of his hand and ready to squeeze, he lets us go by
allowing the story to become a complete re-tread of the first two films.
Ripley never mentions the aliens and her experience until almost the halfway
point, and of course when she does no one believes her. Therefore, is it
surprising the most cynical, easy-to-hate character is killed by the alien
for all to see?</P>
<P>You would think once some semblance of plot and conflict is established the
film would have direction. Unfortunately the second half is just as slowly
paced as the first. Not only that, but we get many of the same old gimmicks
such as Ripley and the others having to wait a long time for a rescue party;
the fact there are almost no weapons; supporting characters getting killed by
the alien; and of course lots of tunnels, drains, and other places for the
alien to hide, and for the people to trap themselves in.</P>
<P>The last act contains the same old climax with the five-minute countdown
that will "certainly" lead to the alien's doom, but kills off more supporting
characters in the process. Fincher at least shoots these scenes in a bizarre
manner that gives one a sense a vertigo. Elements like this crop up
throughout the picture and it's a shame they weren't taken advantage of.</P>
<P>It's not that "Alien 3" is a bad movie per se, there's just not enough to
appreciate.</P>
