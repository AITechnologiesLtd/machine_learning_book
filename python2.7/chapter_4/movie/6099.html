<P>     Gramercy Hospital's emergency room is a picture of overcrowded 
chaos.  Only one operating room is available, and Dr. Guy Luthan (Hugh 
Grant) has to make a decision:  operate immediately on an injured cop 
whose vital signs are stable or on the drugged-out junkie who shot him, 
whose condition is worse.  Luthan elects the former, and, while both 
patients survive, he's never wholly satisfied with his choice, as he 
later confides to Jodie (Sarah Jessica Parker), a sympathetic ER nurse.</P>
<P>     It's moral questions like these that lift EXTREME MEASURES above 
the level of a routine, paranoia-driven thriller like THE NET.  True, 
when you get right down to it, this movie is about a guy trying 
simultaneously to survive, clear his name, and bring the bad guys down, 
but there are more shades of gray here than in most modern-day 
Hitchcockian efforts.  EXTREME MEASURES never portrays guilt as clear-
cut, and its easy to see how, by telling the same story with a script 
slanted towards another character's perspective, the roles of 
protagonist and antagonist could be reversed.</P>
<P>     In the film MALICE, Alec Baldwin's character gave a delicious 
speech about the so-called "God complex" that affects some doctors.  "I 
am God!" he declared, indicating that he had the power of life and death 
over his patients.  EXTREME MEASURES is also about a doctor who crosses 
the line, although, unlike in MALICE, his goal isn't a big financial 
windfall.  In EXTREME MEASURES, Dr. Lawrence Myrick (Gene Hackman) is a 
world renowned neurosurgeon who believes he has discovered the means to 
heal severed spines and allow paralyzed people to walk again.  
Frustrated by the laws that constrain medical experimentation, he sets 
up an underground complex and begins to kidnap homeless people from 
hospital ERs to involuntarily assist him.  His goal is to be known as 
the man who enabled the lame to walk -- a very godlike ambition.</P>
<P>     Luthan becomes involved when lab tests on one of his dead patients 
reveal some very strange things.  Stonewalled by his bosses, who tell 
him to forget it or risk his promising career, he begins his own 
investigation.  Soon, pressure is being brought to bear on him, and he 
discovers the price of ignoring others' warnings.  Now, desperate to 
clear himself of a crime he didn't commit, he ends up wandering through 
New York City sewers and subway tunnels, dodging bullets and searching 
for the mysterious place where Myrick conducts his experiments.</P>
<P>     The question that Luthan eventually has to confront is whether the 
ends do indeed justify the means.  There's no court scene here, but, in 
an extended, well-played confrontation between the two leads, the 
morality of the entire medical profession (not to mention the validity 
of the Hippocratic Oath) is put on trial.  The resolution is perhaps not 
as powerful or satisfying as we might hope, but it's not a cop-out, 
either.</P>
<P>     Considering its overall format, EXTREME MEASURES employs the 
familiar rhythms that have fueled dozens of Hitchcock-inspired thrillers 
(including THE FUGITIVE).  The hero is on the run, being hunted by 
pursuers with uncertain motives.  Computer files are deleted.  Friends 
become suspicious and unhelpful.  Evidence is planted.  There's at least 
one betrayal.  Director Michael Apted, perhaps best known for his 7-UP 
documentaries, has fashioned a well-paced features, keeping the tension 
level high even during routine action sequences (of which there are 
perhaps a few too many).  He has a keen sense of atmosphere, and the 
underground sequences are especially creepy and claustrophobic.  In 
fact, EXTREME MEASURES is a surprisingly dark film.  Even the humor is 
of the gallows variety.</P>
<P>     So how does Hugh Grant, the "aw shucks" poster boy of feel-good 
movies, fare in a role that is significantly different from anything he 
has recently attempted?  For the most part, he's solid.  Not great, but 
effective in getting us to forget temporarily about his appearances in 
FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL and NINE MONTHS.  We come to identify with 
Luthan, which is really all that's necessary for EXTREME MEASURES to 
succeed.</P>
<P>     Gene Hackman is, as always, excellent, and it's in large part due 
to his performance that the film's central moral dilemma has teeth.  
Sarah Jessica Parker, another actor better known for playing light, 
undemanding characters, is fine in a supporting role.  David Morse (THE 
CROSSING GUARD) and Bill Nunn (THE LAST SEDUCTION) play guys with guns 
but no personalities (attempts to give them "character-building" scenes 
fail).</P>
<P>     EXTREME MEASURES isn't going to be described as the "slam bang 
thrill ride" of the Autumn, or any other such nonsense.  The film's 
inherent tension comes not from the shootouts and chases, but from its 
core ethical questions -- questions that ultimately have to be 
addressed, not only in movies, but in real life.  "If you could cure 
cancer by killing one person, wouldn't you have to do it?"  Obviously, 
there's no easy answer, and, whether you agree or disagree with the 
position taken by EXTREME MEASURES, at least the film frames its 
response in an entertaining, and occasionally thought-provoking, 
package.</P>
