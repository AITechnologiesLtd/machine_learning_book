<P>Susan Granger's review of "SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS" (Fox Searchlight)</P>
<P>First-time writer/director Tamara Jenkins scores with bawdy
humor and solid performances in this bizarre coming-of-age comedy.
"Happy families are all alike," reads the prologue. "Every unhappy
family has its own story." Based on her own memories of growing up on
the wrong side of the 90210 zip code, the story revolves the fractured
Abramowitz family whom Ms. Jenkins refers to as "nomads of divorce."
The movie begins in 1976, as the downwardly mobile father (Alan Arkin)
is once again moving his three children in search of a better
lifestyle. Firm in the belief that "furniture is temporary, but
education is forever," he is determined to stay within the Beverly
Hills school district, even if it's in "Casa Bella," a bleak two-story
apartment building with a fancy name and cheap rent. Natasha Lyonne is
the adolescent heroine. Confused and impressionable, she must cope
with distressingly well-developed breasts, an awkward situation only
exacerbated by her dysfunctional father and two insensitive
brothers. Complicating the situation, her wild, straight-out-of-detox
cousin (Marisa Tomei) arrives - to share her bedroom and teach her how
to use a vibrator. Then there's the boy-next-door (Kevin Corrigan)
who, in this case, is a Charles Manson-obsessed drug-dealer; the rich
uncle and aunt (Carl Reiner, Rita Moreno); and a snobbish, neurotic
socialite (Jessica Walter). Ms. Jenkins developed her script at the
Sundance Institute - hence Robert Redford's name as executive producer
- but her quirky humor is quite heavy-handed and she needs to learn
how to do some judicious editing. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to
10, "Slums of Beverly Hills" is a raunchy, rowdy 5, a romp that's
probably too vulgar for mature movie-goers but should get laughs from
younger audiences.</P>
