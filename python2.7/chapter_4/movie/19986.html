<PRE>BROKEDOWN PALACE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"We shouldn't be here," the frightened girl says on the tape that she's
sent to their prospective lawyer in Thailand.  "We're from Ohio, for
God's sakes!"</P>
<P>No, Jonathan Kaplan's BROKEDOWN PALACE is not based on a true story, but
most of it plays like some true-life tale that you've read before in
your newspaper.  Two girls, life-long buddies, have one big fling before
they go their separate ways after high school.  Where better than
Thailand -- an exotic and beautiful country in which they've heard that
you can live for an entire summer on $500?</P>
<P>As Alice, the poorer of the two, Claire Danes plays a good kid with a
little bit of a wild streak.  Kate Beckinsale, who was the best thing in
last year's wonderful and under-appreciated LAST DAYS OF DISCO, plays
Darlene, the slightly more naive of the two.  Actually, they are close
enough in looks and morals to be non-identical twins.  Both are quite
credible as likable, all-American teens who get sucked into a tragedy in
which they quickly lose all control.</P>
<P>It starts off innocently enough.  On a lark, Alice suggests that they
sneak into a swanky hotel in order to beat the heat with a swim.  When
the waiter asks their room number for the food and drinks that they
ordered, it's easy -- way, too easy -- to just pick some three-digit
number at random.</P>
<P>After being caught, they are saved and later wooed by a handsome
software instructor.  Soon he invites them to go to Hong Kong with him
for a few days, but he has to leave on an earlier flight.  In the
check-in line, soldiers with automatic weapons surround the girls and
pull out drugs that have somehow gotten into their backpack.  Before
they know it, they're sentenced to spend the next quarter century of
their lives in a Thai prison.</P>
<P>"I wasn't that scared at first," Alice continues on the tape that she
sent to the lawyer whom they hope to hire.  "I mean, I've had worse
haircuts."  The script by Adam Fields and David Arata has many such
tonality problems.  The girls are sometimes suitably scared and other
times unrealistically flippant, as in the comment about haircuts when
they are trying convince this lawyer, whom they've never met, just how
desperate they are.</P>
<P>On a more positive note, the prison has the feel of a real prison rather
than the overdrawn ones typically shown in films.  The girls' problems
include barely edible soup, a little sadistic treatment and bugs
everywhere; but most of all it is the lack of freedom and the daily
tedium of prison life that are their chief tormentors.</P>
<P>The best of the supporting cast is the ever-reliable Bill Pullman, as
their disheveled and slightly sleazy lawyer, Yankee Hank.  Hank, who
really has a heart of gold, has an early scene in which he calls
Darlene's father back in the states in order to negotiate his fee.  Hank
writes down successively smaller figures on his paper pad.  Before Hank
mentions a figure to her father, he has already negotiated himself down
on his own price.  Hank tells his wife and law partner that he doesn't
care if they win; even the reduced fee will pay for a new car.</P>
<P>Lou Diamond Phillips, on the other hand, overacts with a vengeance as
Roy, a smarmy, hard drinking, fast living DEA agent.  Roy's agenda isn't
clear, nor is his purpose in the story.</P>
<P>The funniest scene in the film, which is either boldly bad or terribly
cute, has Hank threatening a corrupt official with the most awful
retribution America has to offer.  If the official doesn't help, he'll
unleash Larry King and Barbara Walters on him.  Once they start, the
official's life will be unbearable.  Imagine Barbara, for example,
walking through Darlene's bedroom on national television as her sobbing
parents say that it's just as she left it.</P>
<P>The story takes many turns along the way.  Sometimes the writers are
quite inventive, and other times they borrow heavily from similar
movies.  The best and worst of the story is its resolution.  Your
thoughts afterwards are liable to be a conflicting mixture of
fascination and disbelief.  The ending visual image is definitely the
low point of the entire movie and the least credible.</P>
<P>BROKEDOWN PALACE runs 1:40.  It is rated PG-13 for brief strong
language, drug related material and some violent content and would be
fine for kids 12 and up.</P>
