<P>In 1976, director Brian De Palma released "Carrie," based on the novel 
by Stephen King, which went on to be nominated for two Academy Awards 
(Sissy Spacek for Best Actress and Piper Laurie for Supporting Actress, 
respectively) and is now considered a horror classic, with almost 
everyone familiar with the shocking and surprisingly touching climax set 
at the senior prom. Twenty-three years later, a sequel seems pretty much 
like a desperate attempt for MGM to make some money, and after seeing 
"The Rage: Carrie 2," that is apparently exactly what the studio's goal 
was, since this low-rent, convoluted follow-up gives the great original 
a bad name.</P>
<P>In a brief prologue, a young girl who has the ability to move objects 
with her mind sees her schizophrenic mother taken away in an ambulance. 
Switch forward to the present-day, that young girl is now 16-year-old 
Rachel (Emily Bergl), a teenage girl who is living with an insensitive 
foster family. Rachel is a tough, strong-willed young woman who stands 
apart from the popular crowd at school, but is not actually made fun of 
or tormented the way that Carrie was in the original, and so we don't 
get to sympathize with the Rachel character in the same way. When 
Rachel's best friends, Lisa (Mena Suvari), excitedly tells her that she 
lost her virginity the night before, Rachel is devastated to discover 
later on that day that Lisa has committed suicide from jumping off the 
school's roof. Developing her late friend's pictures at the photomat she 
works at, Rachel discovers that Lisa had a picture taken with the guy 
whom she had sex with, Eric (Zachery Ty Bryan), one of the school jocks 
who is in a group where those initiated have sex with people and then 
rate them on a points scale in a little notebook. The one guy in the 
group who actually is growing tired of this cruel and juvenile game, 
Jesse (Jason London), starts to have eyes for Rachel, even though she 
initially finds it hard to believe that such a popular guy would be 
interested in her. Meanwhile, the school's guidance counselor, Sue Snell 
(Amy Irving, reprising her character from the original), the sole 
survivor of the town massacre two decades before, begins to recognize 
similarities in Rachel to Carrie, including her obvious power of 
telekinesis, so Sue sets out to find if Rachel is of any relation to 
Carrie. All of this finally leads up to the inevitable horrific climax, 
just like its predecessor, when the mean kids at school plot to play a 
prank on Rachel at a party, which subsequently pushes her over the edge.</P>
<P>The more you think about it, the more "The Rage: Carrie 2" really does 
come off as a shameful ploy to rip off the infinitely superior original, 
as it steals all of the major elements of that film and then attempts to 
put a spin on them, even though all they really are doing is tarneshing 
the memory of the first movie. For the first 85 minutes, the film moves 
at a very, very slow pace that is only a set-up for the climactic 
showdown. Although "Carrie" did the same thing, I was able to sympathize 
a great deal with Carrie, in her fight to be happy amidst constant 
torment from her fellow students (all much more memorably written and 
played by Nancy Allen, John Travolta, P.J. Soles, etc.), as well as her 
religious fanatic mother (Laurie). When the fateful moment finally did 
occur, we watched with horror and sadness as Carrie was humiliated and 
took revenge on everyone there, and the sequence was all the more 
touching, as well as frightening, because we cared about some of the 
innocent people (and, of course, Carrie) in which terrible things were 
happening to.</P>
<P>In "The Rage: Carrie 2," Emily Bergl, making her feature film debut, 
gives just about as strong of a performance as could possibly be 
expected, taking the thankless and underwritten role (even though she's 
the main character) of Rachel and making it her own. Perhaps this fact 
is where the first major problem of the film arises, however, since at 
least a little weakness and vulnerability needed to be shown so that we 
could care more about her. In retrospect, I can't even recall anything 
that terrible that anyone did to her in the movie (aside from at the 
party), and she was certainly not the ultimate class outcast. Because of 
this, when the ending arrived and Rachel takes out revenge on everyone, 
this plot development comes off as more of a gimmick rather than a 
natural occurrence. When Spacek did the same thing in 1976, we could see 
the pain in her eyes and were able to understand why she was doing what 
she doing. It is not Bergl's fault that she does not accomplish this 
same thing, but rather Rafael Moreu's clumsy and uneven screenplay. If 
this aspect of the conclusion doesn't necessarily work, it could have 
come off as exciting nonetheless, but director Katt Shea (1992's "Poison 
Ivy") even botches the technical aspect, and certainly lacks the style 
and overall height of raw terror that director De Palma was able to 
reach. To top it all off, when Rachel finally takes her vengeance, the 
tatoo on her arm wraps all over her body like a vine which, I seriously 
doubt, is a characteristic of a telekinetic person and makes no sense 
whatsoever. If anything, a few of the death set-pieces were admittedly 
original and shocking in its sudden surge of gore, but they also did not 
service the plot in any way.</P>
<P>One of the most irritating things in "The Rage: Carrie 2" is the 
pointless way that the film mixes color and black-and-white. One 
particular scene mid-way through that might have been effective only 
came off as cheesy due to the mindless decision to film certain sections 
in b&w, and because of this, the movie often felt like a direct-to-video 
movie.</P>
<P>Unlike "Carrie," "The Rage: Carrie 2" does an inadequate and 
disappointing job of writing its large cast of characters (many of which 
come off as simply an afterthought) and the story also does not hold 
such close scrutiny. The movie is never the least bit scary or even 
suspenseful, only occasionally bloody. Sure, there were a few 
unintentionally funny elements thrown in for good measure, such as when 
Rachel and Sue visit the school from the original that was burnt down 23 
years before, and the firey remains still have not been cleaned up, but 
this ineptness was only a brief distraction from the lame proceedings. 
In the latest issue of Fangoria magazine, Amy Irving admits that the 
reason she agreed to make this sequel was because they offered her a 
sizable paycheck. At least she's honest.</P>
