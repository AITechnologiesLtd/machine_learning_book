<P>Six persons: a police officer, an escape artist, a doctor, a math -
genius, an engineer and a mentally demented boy, wake up inside a
giant, mysterious complex. None of them remember how they got there or
where they are. There is no food or water, no reason, logic or
explanations. Instinctively they try to explore the structure, but
soon find out that it is a Rubik's Cube-like prison. A complex of some
17,000 interconnected, perfectly square equal cells, filled with
traps, deadly ways and dangerous paths. And so the increasingly
paranoid prisoners must co-operate, using their different abilities,
moving from block to block in order to reach the surface. What is the
purpose of this? Is somebody watching them? Meanwhile their strength
is running out and their minds start changing...</P>
<P>The first-time director Vincenzo Natali creates an incredible
atmosphere. Claustrophobic and nerve-wracking. Shocking and
original. The feeling of being trapped, isolated and slowly going
paranoid has rarely been manipulated so well as in this movie. The
film slowly transforms into a terrifying psyho-thriller, where the
humanistic attitude is lost in the harsh competition for
survival. Slowly you see how these normal people change into
--->animals. Their minds become more frightening than the horrible
traps around them. The characters and the situation itself are so
primal, so grounded and basic that it momentary connects with the
audience. There is something indescribably frightening about such
simplicity. It effectively dismisses all unnecessary technical and
scientific details and concentrates on the most important -- the human
elements, an issue almost forgotten by sci-fi directors of today. We
can literally dive into people, exploring their complex
characters. Important philosophical, ethical and moral issues are
raised.</P>
<P>No unnecessary characters or scenes delude you from the purpose. There
are only six people and the only scene is the cube. The characters
undergo an evolution that has rarely been captured on film. The
psychological aspect of this film is unusually complex and incredibly
effective. The audience knows as much as the characters, desperately
trying to figure out the purpose of their situation and a way out of
it. Is it a governmental experiment? Aliens? A sick joke? Virtual
reality? The aspect of time disappears completely and after a while
you won't remember what your past world looks like. For you there is
nothing except the cube. Outside of it -- nothing exists. Maybe there
is no point in escaping? Maybe it is impossible? Maybe there will be
nothing outside the cube?</P>
<P>The ending is as mysterious and original as the rest of the film, and
(unlike in most science fiction films) it doesn't alienate it from the
rest of the picture, making it look primitive (such as in 'Dark City'
and '13th Floor'). Nothing is obvious. Nothing is primitive. Nothing
is conventional. And all you can do is presume and guess. In the
beginning the performances may seem a bit flawed, but they quickly
recover and by the end of this film nobody questions their
authenticity. Diana Magnus' fascinating art direction is an incredible
achievement. The sets are complex, strange and yet completely
convincing. The rest of the team handles the job well, though not
quite award worthy. In the end it is Natali who deserves all the
credit for his dark, unpleasant vision.</P>
<P>'Cube' is a story about ordinary people and products of our safe,
protected society that are suddenly transferred to a place where
everything is unknown, where nothing is safe or obvious, where no one
except themselves can protect them. And here, where only the strongest
survives, the makeup is gone, the mask slips off and the true, pure,
savage human nature is revealed. It is a story about the ways of
science seen from a lab-rat's eyes. And here the cube is a symbol of
science itself -- cruel, and too complex and powerful for our own
meaningless stupidity. The film is a representation of the human being
-- the specter of emotions, an analysis of the human mind and human
nature. Natali has created a brilliant and original psycho - analytic
tale that is probably one of the greatest science fiction films that
hit the silver screen during this decade.</P>
