<P>     If you take WHEN HARRY MET SALLY and cross it with BOOTY CALL, then=20
throw in a little STRICTLY BALLROOM for good measure, what do you end up=20
with?  Improbably, Rusty Cundieff's first attempt at a romantic comedy,=20
called SPRUNG.  With this, his third directorial effort, Cundieff=20
reinforces an impression that he has given viewers in his two previous=20
movies (FEAR OF A BLACK HAT, TALES FROM THE HOOD):  he knows how to make=20
audiences laugh but is unwilling to try something truly ambitious. =20</P>
<P>     SPRUNG starts out like any number of raunchy sex comedies, with a=20
couple of horny guys (Cundieff as Montel and Joe Torry as Clyde) on the=20
make at a party.  The women they eventually zone in on are a fine pair=20
of specimens:  Brandy (Tisha Campbell) and Adina (Paula Jai Parker). =20
Clyde quickly gets Adina into his Porsche, then into his bed.  And,=20
while the two are engaged in a bawdy night of sex, Brandy and Montel are=20
doing everything possible to prove how much they despise each other. =20
Next up, Clyde and Adina have big fight, and he ends up under arrest for=20
deviant behavior.  What follows is a hilariously outrageous (not to=20
mention homophobic and potentially-offensive) lineup scene that promotes=20
all sorts of unsavory stereotypes.</P>
<P>     It's then that Cundieff rather abruptly alters his film's=20
direction.  Suddenly, SPRUNG shifts gears and becomes an unexpectedly=20
sweet romantic comedy.  Stereotypes start to give way to real (if only=20
partially-developed) characters.  The brashness and least common=20
denominator humor are replaced by kisses, ballroom dancing, and romantic=20
music.  Brandy and Montel fall hard for each other and Clyde and Adina=20
call a truce in order to figure out a way to break them up. =20
Predictably, in the process, those two discover just how fine a line it=20
is between love and hate.</P>
<P>     It's impossible to deny that parts of SPRUNG are very funny, but=20
the jokes really don't amount to much.  Likewise, the formulaic=20
romances, developed in parallel, are a little flat (Clyde and Adina's=20
moreso than Montel and Brandy's).  Cundieff seems to believe that if he=20
puts together two attractive couples with decent chemistry that we'll=20
readily accept all of the clich=E9s that litter the road to the obvious=20
conclusion.  There aren't any of those special, little "character=20
moments" that elevate many similarly unoriginal romances, primarily=20
because SPRUNG has to juggle two relationships.  Each leeches time from=20
the other, and, as a result, neither gets the development it deserves.=20</P>
<P>     The actors, who are all appealing, arguably do better jobs than the=20
material warrants.  Cundieff and Campbell are effective as the low-key=20
couple, even though they're saddled with a falling-in-love music montage=20
at the heart of their romance.  Meanwhile, Torry and Parker are lively=20
enough on their own or together to make the pairing of Clyde and Adina=20
work.  Clarence Williams III, Sherman Hemsley, and a few other familiar=20
faces dot the casting landscape with amusing cameos.</P>
<P>     At one point, Montel, who is a photographer with aspirations of=20
becoming a director, states that he would like to make a movie with "no=20
gangstas, no drugs, and nobody getting shot=85 A love story, because=20
everyone loves a love story."  This is, of course, exactly what Cundieff=20
has done, and it's easy to hear the director speaking through his=20
character's mouth.  Ultimately, SPRUNG is probably a little too uneven=20
and familiar to be worth taking a trip to a movie theater for, but it is=20
solid enough to provide an evening's diversion once it makes its way to=20
your neighborhood video store.</P>
