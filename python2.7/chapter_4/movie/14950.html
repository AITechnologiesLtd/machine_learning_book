<P>"Apt Pupil" is one of the more peculiar films to come down the pike in 
quite some time. While the psychological horror story of the relationship 
between a teenage boy and a Nazi war criminal is certainly creepy, 
director Bryan Singer maintains an odd sense of distance that blunts the 
effectiveness of the production. We expect a probing examination of the 
essence of evil, but the film stays too close to the surface to deliver 
any insight. As a result, using a Nazi as the bogeyman feels arbitrary 
and vaguely exploitative rather than dramatically justifiable. </P>
<P>Set in 1984, the story (based on a Stephen King novella) introduces young 
Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro), a high school honor student who becomes 
fixated on Nazis and Holocaust imagery during sociology class and 
continues his private research at the local library. Bowden, a resident 
of Incredible Coincidences, California, notices that one of his fellow 
bus passengers bears a striking resemblance to a Nazi war criminal. 
Several weeks later, the boy shows up on the doorstep of Kurt Dussander 
(Ian McKellen), threatening to expose the man unless he tells him, 
"everything they're afraid to tell us in school." </P>
<P>And so the relationship begins, with the grizzled old man recounting 
tales of atrocities while the kid sits transfixed, drinking in every word.
 As their symbiosis-by-blackmail continues, two things happen: Bowden 
becomes increasingly demanding and dictatorial as his obsession grows, 
while Dussander finds his long dormant sadism resurfacing. Clearly, it's 
only a matter of time before the wily old man figures a way to turn the 
tables on his young master.</P>
<P>The psychological study of Bowden and Dussander is very intriguing, but 
director Bryan Singer doesn't sufficiently explore the psyches of his 
characters, leaving us with an aged one-dimensional monster and an 
underdeveloped monster-in-training. The actors are definitely not the 
problem. The remarkable Ian McKellan is skilled enough to give his 
character more depth than the anemic script provides (although he moves 
into caricature during an over-the-top goose-stepping scene), and Renfo 
is no slouch, maintaining a fierce focus that makes his fresh-scrubbed 
innocent appearance all the more chilling.  </P>
<P>At first the Nazi imagery is appropriately disturbing, but as the film 
wore on, it felt more and more like a simple gimmick; just another in a 
long line of Stephen King creep-outs. The story's level of coincidence is 
absurd. After successfully eluding the authorities for decades, McKellan 
gets spotted not once, but twice during the course of the tale. I'm 
willing to suspend disbelief to an extent, but two separate discoveries 
doesn't just strain credulity, it snaps it in two.</P>
<P>Beyond the film's problems with structure and logic, I also found certain 
shots of Renfro more than a little disquieting. Early in the film there's 
an aerial view of the youth resting on his bed wearing only boxers. The 
camera moves over the smooth curves of his underage body, sensuously 
accented by moonlight. Later, in a shower scene, we get a teasing shot of 
the boy's rear, followed by a front view oh-so-carefully framed to barely 
conceal his genitals, while displaying as much of his perfectly lit body 
as possible. While I enjoy looking at an attractive physique as much as 
anyone, these loving displays of the body of a minor made me 
uncomfortable. If the filmmakers want to flash some beefcake, I'd prefer 
they use grown-up subjects. </P>
<P>"Apt Pupil" shows evil as a force that is communicable, but doesn't 
provide the all-important character development that would explain the 
mechanics and motivations. It purports to be an examination of what 
drives humans to commit acts of indescribable horror, but barely scrapes 
the surface. By staying in the wading pool rather than taking a high dive,
 the film leaves us only with a compelling, if contrived, psychological 
cat and mouse story. Making matters worse, the story stretches on too 
long and even throws in the inexcusable cliché of a supposed corpse 
springing back to life for one more cheap scare. "Apt Pupil" had 
incredible potential, but in the hands of Bryan Singer and scripter 
Brandon Boyce, it ends up just a moderately involving creep show, and a 
veritable cavalcade of missed opportunities. </P>
