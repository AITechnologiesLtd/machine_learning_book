<P>There aren't a lot of zippy one-liners or acidic putdowns. Slapstick
is kept to a minimum. Dirty jokes are practically non-existent.</P>
<P>So what is it that makes "Rushmore" so consistently funny?</P>
<P>The question is probably unanswerable, but it appears to have
something to do with the combined forces of director Wes Anderson and
Owen Wilson's offbeat script, the spectacularly dry comic performances
by Bill Murray and newcomer Jason Schwartzman and that peculiar magic
that seems to develop out of nowhere whenever the right elements fall
into place on a film set. As he proved in his debut film, "Bottle
Rocket," originality is Anderson's hallmark, and it's evident in just
about every aspect of "Rushmore."</P>
<P>For instance, rather than cast the latest Tom Cruise wannabe as his
lead, Anderson has opted for Schwartzman, whose hollow eyes and
slightly inflated facial features recall a young Dustin
Hoffman. Though his plot centers on the possibility of a May-September
relationship between 15-year-old Max (Schwartzman) and comely
thirtysomething Rosemarie Cross (Olivia Williams), Anderson steers far
clear of the territory covered by "The Graduate" and "Summer of '42."
Even the soundtrack selections are unpredictable: The Who's "A Quick
One While He's Away," Chad & Jeremey's "A Summer Song," and John
Lennon's "Oh Yoko."</P>
<P>And who could have guessed Murray would find such a role this late in
his career, especially after a string of recent failures?  His turn as
joyless millionaire Herman Blume is both hilarious and a splendid
characterization, on a par with his performances in "Tootsie" and
"Groundhog Day."</P>
<P>Set primarily at a stately private school, "Rushmore" involves an
increasingly intense competition between Max and Herman for the
affections of widowed Rosemarie. For overachieving Max - who divides
his time between such activities as representing Russia in Model U.N.,
serving as the founder of Rushmore's Trap and Skeet Club and presiding
over the Calligraphy Club - Rosemarie is simply one more challenge to
meet. For Herman, she's one of the few bright spots in his otherwise
dreary existence.</P>
<P>She's also almost as far off the beam as the men pursuing her. With
the possible exception of Seymour Cassel's part as Max's dad, everyone
in "Rushmore" is at least slightly twisted, although rarely in obvious
ways.</P>
<P>Even the throwaway details in Anderson and Wilson's screenplay are
surprising. Max, we learn, got a scholarship to Rushmore on the
strength of a play he wrote at age 7, "a little one-act about
Watergate." A tense confrontation between Herman and Max's
solemn-faced prodigy Dirk (Mason Gamble) is followed by a bizarre bit
involving Herman's gleefully moronic sons. The lead role in Max's
lavish drama about Vietnam goes to a Scottish transfer student whose
pronounced burr somehow goes unnoticed by the audience.</P>
<P>Quirkiness abounds in "Rushmore," yet the beauty of the film is that
the weird touches and slightly warped personalities always seem to
make perfect sense in the context of the story. Even though you may
not always understand exactly why you're laughing, laugh you will.</P>
