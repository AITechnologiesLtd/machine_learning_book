<PRE>WAG THE DOG (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Ever wonder what happens behind the scenes with Presidential spin control?
What happens when a President -- who's up for re-election in a few days --
does something really horrible? How do you deal with this problem? Confront
the problem head on? Attack the problem from the side? No, hire a spin
control artist and just make people forget about the problem all together.</P>
<P>The President in Wag the Dog has a 17% lead in the polls. But, he has done
something wrong. Something completely wrong that will send his 17% lead
down the toilet. What's he done? Did he kill someone? Did he steal
something? Political policy gone awry? No, think Girl Scout -- actually,
Firefly girl. Think young.</P>
<P>So, what's a top Presidential aide, Winifred Ames (Anne Henche), going to
do? Bring in the best spin doctor around, Conrad Bream (Robert De Niro).
Bream has an idea on how to control the situation -- just steer the
attention away from the Firefly girl for long enough to get the President
re-elected. And what better to get the attention of the American people
than a war? Bream contacts a Hollywood producer, Stanley Motss (Dustin
Hoffman), about producing a war. Motss likes the idea and is willing to
produce the war. And from here the US goes to war with Albania. And the
dirt hungry American people have forgotten about the Firefly girl and have
taken up with the war in Albania.</P>
<P>Wag the Dog is a hilarious satire about how close Hollywood and politics
really are. How Hollywood and politics really do hold hands together. But,
it goes a bit farther than that, Wag the Dog shows how Hollywood, politics,
and the media in general are holding hands with each other. This is an
intelligent film that has something for us to think about, but all the
while not burdening us too hard with it.</P>
<P>The actors in Wag the Dog seem to be having a great time. De Niro is
playing a part he usually doesn't get to play, and that is the part of
someone who is not out to break your face or kill you. De Niro gets to play
a brilliant and intelligent man who is out to help the President. And he
does a great job with this. Henche, coming off her awful performance in I
Know What You Did Last Summer, does a great job with her part as the
Presidential aide who is willing to do just about anything to get the
President re-elected. And Hoffman is just superb as Hollywood producer
Motss. Among these leads are many cameos throughout the film which are
absolutely hilarious to see. Among the cameos is Kirsten Dunst as an
Albanian girl in some news footage, Denis Leary as some sort of creative
guy, Willie Nelson as a musical guy, William H. Macy as a CIA guy, Craig T.
Nelson as the Presidential opponent, Woody Harrelson as a military guy, and
James Belushi as himself.</P>
<P>The script by Hilary Henkin and David Mamet is intelligent and funny. The
direction by Barry Levinson is steady. And worth mentioning is the
wonderful music by Mark Knopfler. The only nitpicking that I have about the
film is the spotty camera work. Most of the camera work is great with the
exception of a few shots which just feel wrong -- to be specific there are
some quick zooms that felt out of place.</P>
<P>Wag the Dog is definitely a Don't Miss Film. I found myself laughing out
loud, along with the audience, during most of the film. The performances
are great and the cameos are even better. And you'll want to see the film
to find out why dogs wag their tails.</P>
