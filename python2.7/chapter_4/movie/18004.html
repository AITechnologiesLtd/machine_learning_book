<P>LE CERCLE ROUGE (director: Jean-Pierre Melville; cast: Alain Delon
(Corey), Gian Maria Volonté (Vogel), Yves Montand (Jansen), André
Bourvil (Mattei),  François Périer (Santi), André Ekyan (Rico),
1970-France)</P>
<P>This is a noir film, one of the last one's shot that can truly emulate
the spirit of the one's shot in the heyday of American noir, in the 40s
and the 50s. Melville shoots in a dark color tone, that sets the dire
mood of the violent story about a prison escape, a heist, a
double-cross, and the untrustworthy nature of people. Melville wanted to
make a French version of John Huston's noir classic, THE ASPHALT JUNGLE
(50), as Melville imbued in his film his strong beliefs about what a
gangster picture should look like, making it original while covering all
the subplots of that genre he could manage to fit into a film that runs
for 150 minutes. This is a transitional film, as it makes way for a new
wave of crime films to follow, one's that will reflect the changing
mores of society and the changes within the criminal code that the new
decade brings with it.</P>
<P>Corey (Delon) is a steely-eyed hood, who is being released from prison
tomorrow, when he breaks into the cell of another prisoner, Vogel
(Volonté), to tell him that he can arrange to help him escape tomorrow
if he agrees to join him in a heist he has planned. Vogel escapes from a
moving train, as a massive police hunt is on the way for his capture,
led by the fair-haired Corsican, Superintendent Mattei (Bourvil), who is
quite an interesting character, as well as being a cat-lover, whose
boss, the police commissioner, while pressing him to do everything
possible to get Vogel, lectures him that every man is guilty, something
that slowly sinks into Mattei's consciousness as his investigation
broadens.</P>
<P>While the escape is taking place, Corey goes back to Marseilles to get
money from his crime boss Rico (Ekyan), who tries to put him off, so
Corey robs him, causing Rico to send a couple of his gang members after
him, who end up getting shot by Vogel, who by this time has joined Corey
in the car he just bought with Rico's money. The intense action scenes
amidst the changing weather from rain to snow, plus the wooded area and
the roadblocks the men must cross to get back to Paris, gives the film
an air of resolute desperation, that is intriguing to watch, as each
camera shot is done by the hands of a master, reaching far into his
characters and their surroundings.</P>
<P>To help with the jewel heist,Vogel suggests a friend of his, a former
police marksman who cracked up from the pressure of the job, Jansen
(Yves), who is first seen having a nightmare that bugs are attacking
him, that is very movingly shot, and is framed like it is a painting on
canvas by one of the master's of horror painting, someone like a Francis
Bacon. Bunuel has very effectively used surreal shots like this in some
of his films.</P>
<P>The heist of the Place Vendome is excuted in silence for the 30- odd
minutes it takes to pull off the job. There are five men involved in
this jewel heist, these three plus a tip-off man and the fence. But when
the robbery is completed, the fence backs out because he is pressured to
by a local gangster, Santi (Périer), who is a nightclub owner and pimp,
and a one time informant for Mattei, who leans heavily on him to
cooperate in this case. For Mattei, there is no such thing as police
without informers. This relationship made in hell, makes no one an
innocent.</P>
<P>The film's conclusion is as violent as it has to be, since the mood was
set from the film's onset to end this way. By this time, we know all the
character's rather well, as we see who turns on the other, and how
hypertense a policeman's job is, with not that much sanity separating
his job from the criminal's.</P>
<P>This is a top notch noir film. It has done an outstanding job in
uncovering the themes of alienation and desperation, that drive men so
hard that it is impossible for them to transcend their criminal nature.</P>
