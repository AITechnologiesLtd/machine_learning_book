<P>     HEAVEN'S PRISONERS tries very hard not to admit what it really is.  
By throwing a tangled web of incoherent subplots into the mix, 
screenwriters Harley Peyton and Scott Frank (GET SHORTY), adapting James 
Lee Burke's novel, have cleverly concealed the fact that this movie is 
actually a revenge thriller.  Unfortunately, this camouflage has 
resulted in an overlong, convoluted story that's of limited 
entertainment value.  Had director Phil Joanou (FINAL ANALYSIS) 
attempted something in the more straightforward style of DEATH WISH, his 
picture might have worked better.  It certainly wouldn't have dragged on 
for more than two hours.</P>
<P>     It's inevitable that, in any movie featuring an alcoholic ex-cop 
who starts the film on the wagon, there will be some point when he takes 
a drink.  This is just one of many cliches employed by HEAVEN'S 
PRISONERS.  The ex-cop is Dave Robicheaux (Alec Baldwin), a one-time 
lieutenant on the New Orleans Police Force who got burned out, and, 
accompanied by his loyal, loving wife, Annie (Kelly Lynch), retired to 
the bayous, where he operates a bait shop.  Dave's new, laid-back life 
agrees with him -- he looks good and feels great, even if he 
occasionally gets a craving to down a beer.</P>
<P>     One day, Dave and Annie are out on a lake when a single-engine 
plane crashes into the nearby water.  Dave investigates the accident 
site, where he rescues the sole survivor, a Spanish-speaking little 
girl.  Through a series of rather hard-to-swallow plot contrivances, the 
child, named Alafair (Samantha Lagpacan), comes to live with the 
Robicheauxes as an unofficially adopted daughter.  But Alafair has a 
dangerous pedigree.  Suddenly, Dave and Annie are receiving some ominous 
visitors -- hitmen, drug lords, and DEA agents.  All of them have one 
message:  keep your nose out of our business.  Of course, these warnings 
pique Dave's curiosity.  He stops by to see Robin Gaddis (Mary Stuart 
Masterson), a strung-out stripper friend with knowledge and contacts, 
then drops in on a former schoolmate-turned-crime kingpin, Bubba Rocque 
(Eric Roberts), and his slutty wife, Claudette (Teri Hatcher).  For 
Dave, the price of these visits is steep and bloody.</P>
<P>     There's a lot going on in HEAVEN'S PRISONERS, but most of it 
amounts to very little.  The entire background story, which involves 
dead Federal agents, dueling crime lords, unfaithful wives, and all 
sorts of unsavory dealings, becomes window dressing for Dave's 
vengeance.  He goes after one bad guy after another, and, no matter how 
many he kills, there always seems to be someone else.  All this leads to 
an ending that, after one-hundred thirty-plus minutes of watching and 
waiting, is a big letdown.</P>
<P>     Although the characters are all flat stereotypes, that's no excuse 
for some of the bad acting.  Alec Baldwin has a narrow range in which he 
can be effective; HEAVEN'S PRISONERS frequently makes dramatic demands 
upon him that he is unwilling or unable to fulfill.  The result is an 
uninteresting, occasionally-overwrought performance.  Kelly Lynch is 
dull as the dutiful wife.  Mary Stuart Masterson, who normally is solid, 
fails to convince as a "bad girl" (much like in the movie of that 
title).  Teri Hatcher (of TV's LOIS AND CLARK fame) plays a superficial 
femme fatale whose Southern accent is as on-and-off as her clothing.  
Only a delightful Eric Roberts and Vondie Curtis-Hall (as a DEA agent) 
can boast any credibility.</P>
<P>     Presumably, HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is an attempt to elevate the revenge 
genre to an newer, more interesting level by including themes of 
redemption and responsibility.  The problem is that retribution in the 
movies is a vicious, nasty business, and all the extraneous plot 
elements needlessly encumber the story.  Co-writer Scott Frank, who 
penned MALICE (with Aaron Sorkin) and DEAD AGAIN, is known for twisty 
scripts, but this one loses itself in the maze.  There are too many 
characters working with too little new material.  In fact, this movie is 
so long-winded and repetitious that there are times when viewers of 
HEAVEN'S PRISONERS will feel like they're serving a sentence.</P>
