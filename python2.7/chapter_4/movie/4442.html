<P>     FATHER OF THE BRIDE II follows the 1991 FATHER OF THE BRIDE,
itself a remake of the 1950 movie by the same title.  The original was
a nice, high-bourgeoisie, mainstream film.  The father was Spencer
Tracy--who could do no wrong in his roles.  The daughter was Elizabeth
Taylor.  That film was followed by FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND (1951),
also with Tracy and Taylor.  It is that last movie that has been now
remade as FATHER OF THE BRIDE II.</P>
<P>     I have not seen the 1991 picture and my memory of FATHER'S LITTLE
DIVIDEND is hazy, so no comparisons will be made.  But I have seen
FATHER OF THE BRIDE II and I can tell you that if you want to see Steve
Martin in fine fettle in a good picture, find something else to watch.
There's ample choice, including four fine films that  for mysterious
reasons averaged poor-to-mediocre reviews: PENNIES FROM HEAVEN, THREE
AMIGOS, MY BLUE HEAVEN, and HOUSESITTER.</P>
<P>     The script of FATHER OF THE BRIDE II is based on that of FATHER'S
LITTLE DIVIDEND, but this time there are two pregnancies.  George Banks
(Martin) is a wealthy man approaching 50 contented with his life, kids,
wife and house.  He say so at the start of the movie, addressing the
audience.  There is more of this later too.  The uncreative way the
monologue is handled shows that it is used as a crutch.</P>
<P>     When his married daughter announces that she is pregnant, George
goes into a blue funk at the idea of aging and becoming a grandfather.
This too is handled lamely, opting for sentiment instead of having
Steve Martin do a manic-depressive turn.  George tries rejuvenating his
appearance by dyeing his white hair and other steps.  In a moment of
abandon he makes love to his wife Nina (Keaton) on the kitchen floor.</P>
<P>     Let's cut to the chase.  Some time later the  senior couple find
out that Nina is pregnant, to her delight and to his shock.  But he
comes around and everything goes swimmingly as mother and daughter both
produce babies next door to each other in the same hospital and at the
exact same time.</P>
<P>     If you can swallow that much coincidence you should see the
infinitely funnier (but naughty) "Micki + Maude," a 1984 farce by Blake
Edwards in which bigamist TV reporter Dudley Moore has two wives giving
birth at the same time and place.  Skip, however the 1995 pregnancy
movie "Nine Months" (with Hugh Grant), which is pretty poor, except for
Robin Wiliams's turn.</P>
<P>     FATHER OF THE BRIDE II is phony throughout and disconnected from
real life, or at least the life of the huge majority of viewers.  The
Banks live in a mansion that would make Cary Grant and Myrna Loy (in
MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE (1948) green with envy.  George's
profession and source of income are a mystery.  The only time we see
him in his work-place is when he crosses a large office while getting
from his secretary a list of famous people who are his seniors.</P>
<P>     FATHER OF THE BRDIE II is a Rich People's film.  When for reasons
I will not go into, George has sold his house then wants to buy it back
from Mr.  Habib (Eugene Levy) the entrepreneur, he thinks nothing of
returning Habib's check plus a bonus of $100,000.  With the help of
another entrepreneur, the family friend played by Martin Short, George
then gets going on building an addition, a "Baby Suite" that could
easily house a small family.  Then comes a luxurious two-babies-shower,
also orchestrated by Martin Short.  Wnna bet that George and Nina do
not clip grocery coupons?</P>
<P>     Very, very little is funny about this film, in spite of Martin's
unquestioned abilities.  Instead we get a lot of delighted squealing
(as when the daughter makes her announcement) and dumb, silly scenes
(as in the dog sequence).  We get oceans of glop and an overall
atmosphere that is like an updated or transplanted Eisenhower-era
mentality, when much of America was optimistic and thriving.</P>
<P>     The picture also wallows in corny sentiment, like a flashback of
George teaching basketball to his then-little girl to the sounds of
awful swelling music. (Normally composer Alan Silvestri does a lot
better than in this picture).</P>
<P>     What's even worse is that the film is so lethargic that a
sleeping-pills incident stands as a symbol of the whole.  At the same
time the movie manages to offend people right and left: Arabs (the
grasping, cold Mr. Habib), hospital staff (they make an initial
mistake) and doctors (there is mistrust of obstetrician Dr. Eisenberg
who is young and a woman).  Canines too.</P>
<P>     More irritating yet is the role of Martin Short as Frank
Eggelhoffer.  He is an unexplained friend (unless perhaps you know
FATHER OF THE BRIDE) who is now an interior decorator, now a
contractor, now a caterer.  Introduced as a flaming gay, in gestures
and speech he minces, flounces, overdoes everything so much that he is
an insult to both gays and straights.  With vague European origins, he
speaks with an accent that's neither German or anything else.  It
starts out highly exaggerated then ebbs, flows and changes as the movie
unreels.  His nom-de-film is taken, I bet, from the screwball classic
NOTHING SACRED (1937) where the great supporting actor Sig Ruman
played Dr. Eggelhoffer.</P>
<P>     The only four things I liked in FATHER OF THE BRIDE II were Jane
Adams in her small part as the  charming and most professional
Dr.Eisenberg; the two Dobermans; and George's beautiful two-seater
convertible.  Neither the end credits nor the body of the movie
identify the car.  For once, product placement would have been
welcome.</P>
