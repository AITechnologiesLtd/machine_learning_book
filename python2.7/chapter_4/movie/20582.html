<P>     To paraphrase Garrett Morris as Chico Escuela from the old "Saturday
Night Live," baseball been bery, bery good to Kevin Costner.  Arguably his
two strongest performances -- in two of his strongest films -- have come
when he was dealing with baseball:  BULL DURHAM, and FIELD OF DREAMS.
There's something about Costner, some combination of his convincingly
athletic build and his aw-shucks, laconic manner that makes him
well-suited to tales of our peculiarly mythologized national pastime.
It's only natural that he'd want to return to the diamond for a film like
FOR LOVE OF THE GAME.  Could he maintain his perfect batting average,
even playing a non-hitting American League pitcher?</P>
<P>     The short answer is yes, though it's more of a solid single than
FIELD OF DREAMS' ground-rule double or BULL DURHAM's inside-the-park home
run.  Costner stars as Billy Chapel, a one-time great Detroit Tigers
pitcher now 40 years old, staring down the end of a career and the end
of a relationship. On the last day of a disappointing season -- the same
day that his long-time girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) announces she's
moving to London for a job as a magazine editor -- Billy learns that he
will be traded to another team unless he retires.  Over the course of that
evening's game, Billy reflects on his career and his five years with Jane,
almost unaware that he has a chance at throwing the pitcher's dream: a
perfect game.</P>
<P>     FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is deftly constructed as perhaps the ideal date
movie -- it's a love story that also happens to be a baseball movie.  In
the flashback segments, we watch the arc of Billy's romance with Jane,
including his acceptance of Jane's teenage daughter Heather (Jena Malone).
Though Costner is plenty agreeable in his easy-going way, it's Preston who
really sells the romantic side of the story.  She gives a bright,
appealing performance as a woman whose tentative steps into a relationship
with a professional athlete all feel momentous to her.  The chemistry
between Preston and Costner is solid, but there's a nagging sense that
there's much more to know about Billy.  The absence of any previous
romantic history for Billy robs the love story of context; it's hard to
see the person he was, so we can feel for the person he needs to become.</P>
<P>     Some of that context is provided by the baseball sequences, which are
satisfying in their own right.  They're less about the game than they are
about Billy's intensity and gamesmanship: his ability to "clear the
mechanism" and remove all external distractions, his internal monologues
about the batters he is facing, his almost old-fashioned respect for the
game.  Though there are a couple of technical blunders -- a scoreboard
that shows no hits for both teams shortly before the announcer says the
Tigers have two hits -- the game sequences do their job as character
development.</P>
<P>     Still, it's sometimes difficult to lock into the fate of Billy and
Jane's relationship, not because of the distractions of the game 
sequences, but because Billy remains so enigmatic.  In one sense, that
mystery gives FOR LOVE OF THE GAME an intriguingly different romantic
tone, since Jane remains oblivious to Billy's focus on baseball until an
injury causes him to turn that intensity against her.  In another sense,
that mystery could simply be a distraction from a viewer's confidence that
these two people actually belong together.  </P>
<P>     Make no mistake, FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is fundamentally satisfying --
it can't help but be with _two_ big payoff scenes -- and well-acted.
Director Sam Raimi delivers the crowd-pleasing goods, and the film
delivers more laughs than you might expect.  I only wish Billy Chapel had
been more of a complete character, and less one of those baseball icons
Costner has exploited so successfully in other films.  The game continues
to be bery, bery good to him.  It just could have been better.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 pitch meetings:  7.</PRE>
