<P>As we move closer to the 21st century we are reminded that racial tensions
still remain high around the world.  'Ghosts of Mississippi' is a story
dealing with the aftermath of assassinated American Civil Rights leader
Medgar Evers who was shot in the back with a high powered rifle in the
driveway of his home as he arrived from work late one evening in June of
1963.  Byron De la Beckwith, the man accused of the crime (portrayed
chillingly and absorbingly by James Woods) was given two trials and both
ended in hung juries.  Twenty five years later the case is re-opened through
the persistance of Evers' widow (Whoopi Goldberg) with the help of civil
rights organizations seeking a conviction and De la Beckwith is again tried
by the District Attorney's office in the hands of Alec Baldwin and Craig T.
Nelson.  This is a low key and very sedated picture to be admired for its
attempt rather than for its execution as most of the scenes are quite subtle
and director Rob Reiner ('Misery,' 'A Few Good Men,' 'The American
President') demonstrates his diversity with the courtroom by making the
scenes appear realistic with little or no outbursts of fiery dialogue and
sometimes pretentious emotion as was the case in 'A Few Good Men' which
featured a harrowing courtroom climax.  Reiner chooses to tell the story in
'Ghosts of Mississippi' as one of truth since it is based on an actual event
and Reiner does a good job with the characterizations but could have drained
a bit more from Alec Baldwin and Whoopi Goldberg and it's James Woods who
steals the show as an unrepentant racist convinced he will never be convicted
of killing a black man in the state of Mississippi.  Perhaps 'Ghosts of
Mississippi' will play better on home video as it could easily pass for a
television movie of the week.  For a different look at how courtroom
procedures are usually undertaken and for reasonably satisfying entertainment
which unfortunately for some may leave them a bit flat, 'Ghosts of
Mississippi' is a movie which will seem different than most others of its
type.  I suppose in some ways that's a good thing.</P>
