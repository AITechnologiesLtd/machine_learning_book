TIME AFTER TIME
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov</PRE>
<P>For many scientific purists, concept of time travel is so
preposterous that they tend to bar time travel films and
novels from science fiction domain. According to them, time
travel books, comics and films should be branded fantasy
instead. That position might find its arguments in the way
that Hollywood usually treated time travel. Most of the
time, that concept was nothing more than a convenient excuse
for exotic, but standard adventures and films without any
ambitions of seriousness. But, every once in a while, there
comes a time travel film with brains. George Pal's classic
adaptation of equally classic H.G. Wells' novel THE TIME
MACHINE is one of them. TIME AFTER TIME, 1979 film and
directorial debut by Nicholas Meyer, is perfect companion
piece to it.</P>
<P>In George Pal's film, by naming the hero - Victorian time
traveller - "George", the authors hinted that the real hero
of the novel might be H.G. Wells himself. Meyer, who had
already played with mixing fiction with real historical
personalities in his novel SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION, goes even
further - the time traveller in his film is really H.G.
Wells (played with Malcolm McDowell). Same as his "George"
incarnation, he invites his friends in London 1893 to
present them his new innovation - the time machine. The
presentation is, however, interrupted when Scotland Yard
arrives. It turns out that one of the guests, Doctor John
Leslie Stevenson (played by David Warner) happens to be Jack
the Ripper. While Wells and his friends struggle with
shocking revelation, Stevenson uses the confusion and, out
of desperation, decides to test this new machine. Examining
Stevenson's mysterious disappearance, Wells concludes that
the killer managed to travel to year 1979. Feeling
responsible for allowing bloodthirsty maniac to roam in
future Utopia, Wells goes to future too in order to bring
him to justice. His travel brings him to San Francisco 1979,
strange new megalopolis that at first sight looks like an
utopian society. But, soon he discovers that the Utopia has
its bad side, and, most of all, his quest for Stevenson is
failing. Things change when he meets Amy Robbins (Mary
Steenburgen), bank teller and liberated woman, who decides
to help him in his quest, mostly because she fancies bizarre
but charming Englishman.</P>
<P>Although it is actually not based on H.G. Wells' novel, this
film is closer to its spirit than 1960 version. When he
wrote the novel, Wells was less interested in pure
scientific speculations; instead, he saw science fiction as
a way to talk about burning social issues of his time, as
well as to offer some solutions. This film presents us Wells
as a man before his time, socialist reformer who fought for
free love, feminism, racial equality, people's rights, and
many other things we now take for granted. Meyer uses time
travel to confront Wells' ideals with reality - when he
arrives in San Francisco during the zenith of ultra-liberal,
hedonistic era of sexual revolution and counter-culture, he
discovers that many of his ideals are reality. But, on the
other hand, human nature hadn't improved and, all those
ideals are paired with world wars, nuclear weapons,
pollution, terrorism and other horrors Wells couldn't have
imagined. While poor idealistic reformer has trouble fitting
into this fascinating, but in the same time frightening
world. On the other hand, bloodthirsty yet cynical and
practical Stevenson makes 1979 his home without any
difficulty.</P>
<P>Clever commentary is the reason enough to fend off all the
critics of this film, who had considered TIME AFTER TIME to
be nothing more than light- hearted fantasy. Their argument,
of course, is valid only the movie is entertaining indeed -
conflict between Victorian gentleman and the modern
environment provided excellent opportunity for many subtle
yet effective jokes. The humour in this film is really
charming, and it is helped by Malcolm McDowell who uses this
film as rare opportunity not just to play a good guy for a
change, but also to express his comedic talents. His partner
Mary Steenburgen shows her comedic talent too, and also the
great skill that helps her in the transformation between
strong modern liberated woman and classic damsel in
distress. The romantic chemistry between the two is great,
and it shouldn't surprise anyone that they transcended their
partnership into real life.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, David Warner didn't feel particularly
inspired in the role of Jack the Ripper. He lacks the
charisma of pure evil that is necessary ingredient for any
effective villain that this film required. Flaw in the
characterisation is just one of the many of this film -
cheesy and totally unconvincing special effects, scientific
plot holes and implausibilities, some rather uninspired
lines - that culminate in rather disappointing and ultra-
conventional finale. The musical score of Hollywood veteran
Miklos Rozsa, on the other hand, might have looked
anachronistic in any other film of the period, but it was
right on the target in this story. But, all in all, TIME
AFTER TIME is more than good piece of science fiction
cinema, that could outrank not only some of the time travel
atrocities of its own time (FINAL COUNTDOWN comes to mind),
but also some of the future films with much more fame
(TERMINATOR, BACK TO THE FUTURE).</P>
<P>(Special note to x-philes: Charles Cioffi, who played
skeptical FBI official in the pilot episode of the X-FILES
appears in this film with similar role of skeptical San
Francisco police inspector.)</P>
