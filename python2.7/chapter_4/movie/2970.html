<PRE>                                  PULP FICTION
                       A film review by Thomas Skogestad
                        Copyright 1994 Thomas Skogestad</PRE>
<PRE>Rating (out of four): ****</PRE>
<P>Running time:  144 minutes
MPAA rating: R (This being a Tarantino film, no extra explanation is
             necessary)
With: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel,
      Bruce Willis
Written & Directed by:  Quentin Tarantino (with Roger Avary on stories)
Produced by: Lawrence Bender
Released by Miramax
Reviewed at: Landmark's California, Berkeley, CA, Oct. 14, 1994 (with a very
             enthusiastic audience)</P>
<P>     The film starts and ends at a coffee shop, where two petty crooks
decide to rob something no one would ever expect to be the target of a
robbery: the very coffee shop they're having breakfast in.  The movie
cuts from them just after they start their heist, and then tells three
more stories before returning to our coffee guests.  Quickly, the three
segments are about taking the boss's wife out on a date; a boxer is
forced to take a dive--and doesn't comply; and deposing of a body.</P>
<P>     Just because this is the order things happen in the movie, does
not mean that this is the order things are chronologically.  Tarantino
successfully juxtaposes time to pack that extra punch.</P>
<P>      It's like having a dinner with several different foods, some you
don't like, some you love.  Therefore you save the best for last, but
once in a while you can't restrain yourself, you need that good stuff.
But you overeat on what you don't like, so you're a bit disappointed
when you're not able to eat all that good stuff.  But when the dessert
arrives, it's like a whole new stomach opens, and you eat all the
treats that are being served.</P>
<P>     The movie opens wonderfully, but loses some steam after a
while.  Not to worry: Tarantino strikes back with an overwhelming
power.  Especially the last hour and a half or so, which is one long
joyride.  Just like a good book where you keep counting pages, hoping
that there's a lot left.  Alas when the end comes--after two and a half
hours--the movie is definitely over.  You just sit there begging for
more.</P>
<P>     Like Tarantino's debut--and one of my favorite movies--RESERVOIR
DOGS, this movie is full of references to movies and life of all kind.</P>
<P>     Butch the pugilist, played by Bruce Willis, plans to run off to
Knoxville, Tennessee--the same town Tarantino himself was born.</P>
<P>     In the Tarantino executive produced and Roger Avary directed film,
KILLING ZOE, Eric Stoltz had a major part.  Well, he's here too!</P>
<P>     From RESERVOIR DOGS we have Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel in major
roles, but not the same.  Keitel more or less reprises his role from
POINT OF NO RETURN.</P>
<P>     And from TRUE ROMANCE we have Christopher Walken, Patricia
Arquette's sister--Rosanna, and making personal decisions in a
bathroom.</P>
<P>     Blaxploitation, pulp, noir, Godard.  And the list goes on and
on.  Really, the movie just has to be experienced.</P>
<P>     Yes, the trademark Tarantino dialog and violence is also in this
movie.  While the violence is perhaps more subdued, it's more often
played for humor.  There's no resisting laughing when Travolta
accidentally (because of a bump in the road) kills a guy and his blood
and brain splatters all over the car he's in.  It might be sick, but
it's a whole lot of fun.  This might not seem restrained, but it could
be a lot more violent.</P>
<P>     And for those wanting S&M, don't waste your money on EXIT TO EDEN,
this movie contains a rather shocking sadomasochistic scene with Bruce
Willis and Ving Rhames (who plays the man who makes Butch take the
fall).  The build up to this scene contains a scene where the one
person you wouldn't expect to die does.  (Tip: Don't go to the bathroom
without your weapon.)</P>
<P>     Christopher Walken has just one scene in the movie, in which he
explains how came the family gold watch which has gotten into his
possession--and more important how it was hidden during seven years of
P.O.W. captivity.  Things like this explain why the movie is more that
just "pulp."  In a lesser movie we would have the violence, but not the
humor.  The stars would just be there for sake of a simple cameo, and
nothing more.  The plot itself might not be considered as that
original.  But that's not what makes this film interesting.  It's what
happens to the characters that make the film so great.</P>
<P>     I could go on about more technical matters, but I wouldn't want
you to miss the next screening of PULP FICTION.</P>
