<PRE>                          THE EVENING STAR 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon

<PRE>‘Memories of Endearment' by TMT Voon</PRE>
<P>The death of a young mother named Emma,
Claimed by that deadly ill known as cancer,
Leaves three children in the care of their grandmother,
The ‘Grand Dame of doing things her own way'.</P>
<P>The sequel to ‘Terms of Endearment' is a bad move in the direction of an
awful movie. One should not attempt to make a sequel to a classic tale
of dying if it is to be as morbid and unhappy as this. There was enough
misery in the first movie, why torture the audience with more sorrow.
How does one top a finale like death? More people dying of course. Not
just one death this time, but a minimum of two. Let's not toy with
cancer again, it's soooo yesterday. Let's use a vague disease that
nobody's heard of, or perhaps a handy debilitating illness known as
stroke. Sorry chaps (director Harling and author McMurty), no sympathy
points will be gained for killing off little old ladies. There's nothing
new in this material that can't already be found in a Nursing Home.</P>
<P>Aurora (Shirley Maclaine) hasn't learnt much from the suffocating
mistakes she made with her own daughter. She now reeks dominance and
disaster on her grandchildren. History repeats itself as the three
grandchildren, now adults, rebel in very different ways. Stubborn,
strong willed and impulsive. The youngest (Juliette Lewis) follows in
her mother's footsteps and becomes involved with the wrong guy (Scott
Wolf) despite advice to the contrary. The eldest (George Newbern) who is
also the angriest, has a history of juvenile delinquency and is
currently caged in a penitentiary. The middle (Mackenzie Astin) who is
perhaps the most stable has no ambitions, but carries a job, a de facto
and a child.</P>
<P>I don't blame them and I don't back them either. If had a grandmother
like Aurora, I would be jumping off a high rise building to escape her
clutches, and if I had grandchildren like these ungrateful mutts, I
would be bagging them alive. In truth this unhappy family deserve each
other's tormented misery.</P>
<P>Aurora's life is in shambles. Numerous failed marriages and affairs,
leads this ‘unhappy come sleep with me' sixty year old, to hop into bed
with her much younger psychological counsellor (Bill Paxton). Things get
more tedious and fantastic when there is vying competition with Emma's
best friend (Miranda Richardson), a now wealthy divorcee who tries to
outshine and outdo Aurora in every way - including reading bed time
stories to the psychological counsellor.</P>
<P>Talk about unprofessional counsellor-patient conduct. Can you imagine,
Bill Paxton and Shirley Maclaine in bed ‘doing it' several times over
and over - Ewwwwwhl! What was the director thinking - the ‘turn on' of
the decade? Throw up.</P>
<P>Comment: Aurora - ‘The Evening Star' - ‘she who shines the longest and
burns the brightest', unfortunately doesn't also ‘fizzle out the
fastest'.</P>
