A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Andrew Fleming</PRE>
<P>Written by: Andrew Fleming and Sheryl Longin</P>
<P>Starring: Kirsten Dunst, Michelle Williams, Dan Hedaya, Dave Foley</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Tricky Dick Nixon (Richard M. Nixon), the 37th President of the United
States, was famous for a few things and infamous for one. Nixon ended the
Vietnam War and held successful strategic arms limitation talks with his
Cold War nemesis, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. But soon came the 1972
Watergate office complex break-in, an attempted burglary and wiretapping of
the Democratic National Committee headquarters by thugs hired by Nixon's
close associates. In the end, President Nixon resigned in disgrace after
erasing tapes which allegedly contained conversations in which he
obstructed justice by halting the FBI's Watergate investigation just when
big names were starting to become implicated.</P>
<P>The spoof DICK is a caricature of the Nixon years in which the Nixon
administration's main accomplishments are accidentally caused by two ditsy
teenage girls named Arlene and Betsy (played by Michelle Williams and
Kirsten Dunst) who are hired by the White House as dog walkers. </P>
<P>In DICK, Nixon (Dan Hedaya) thoughtlessly erases the tapes which lead to
his resignation because he doesn't want the world to hear Arlene singing an
embarrassing Olivia Newton-John love song. Another running gag is that
Nixon has a dog named King Timahoe, but he keeps absent-mindedly calling
the dog Checkers, the name of a pet Nixon immortalized in a political
speech, defending himself from charges of corruption 20 years before
Watergate. Nixon era characters such as Leonid Brezhnev and Henry Kissinger
are also spoofed.</P>
<P>Opinion: 
DICK is great satire, a hilarious take on the Nixon years. Even folks who
weren't born in the days of Tricky Dick, Kissinger, Liddy, Dean, or
Haldeman will still laugh at bigwig politicians eating the wrong
(marijuana-laced) cookies. Or at the two oblivious teens - - Betsy and
Arlene, like Jan and Marcia from the Brady Brunch, only mentally vacuous -
- who witness surreptitious corruption time and again but fail to see
what's going on. While nefarious events swirl, Arlene and Betsy dream of
only cute 70s pop idol Bobby Sherman and the furtive man of their dreams,
Richard Nixon.  </P>
<P>Comedic parts concerning investigative reporters Woodward and Bernstein
fall flat, and some of the film's jokes are inside jokes, but for the most
part DICK is pretty funny. And the DICK soundtrack includes everything 70s,
from young Michael Jackson to Yes.</P>
