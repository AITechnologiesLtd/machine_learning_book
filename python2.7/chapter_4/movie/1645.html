<PRE>                             LEAP OF FAITH
                       A film review by Jon Webb
                        Copyright 1992 Jon Webb</PRE>
<P>     Steve Martin plays a con man revival preacher who goes through a
life-changing experience.  Part of the film is a look into technically
sophisticated cons -- identifying people in the audience with particular
problems so the preacher can call on them as if God told him they needed
his help, using wireless microphones to control the show with the aid of
a computer -- and part is a story about a man's relationship with, well,
God.  It's an interesting film in that it doesn't back down an make
acceptable to this Godless world its central dramatic moment, which
hinges on the difference between real and fake miracles.</P>
<P>     This is Steve Martin's first major non-comic role.  He does fairly
well, especially during the shows, when the moves he developed as part
of his comic routines come in handy.  But I found him less believable
off-stage.  He seems too young and hip to be an evangelist.  I suppose
this contrast is intentional, and maybe even based on studies of the
private lives of evangelists.  But either the writing or the acting
didn't convey what it was supposed to convey, to me.</P>
<P>     Another problem with Steve Martin's role is that it is undeveloped.
He was supposed to have an affair with the Lolita Davidovich role, but
that part was almost completely cut.  (She is left with a few scenes,
and almost a superfluous presence in the film.)  So we're left with an
incomplete person.</P>
<P>     By contrast, Debra Winger's character is well-developed in much
fewer scenes.  The only thing left out was parts of the relationship
between her and Martin's character.  I found her role and acting to be
completely credible.</P>
<P>     Lukas Haas is good as the crippled brother of Davidovich, and Liam
Neeson is good (though his role is depressingly familiar from other
movies) as the sheriff.</P>
<P>     The direction is great, particularly during the shows.  Martin's
sermons and the gospel singing move us even though we know they are a
con.</P>
<P>     I liked this film.  But it's a lot more shallow presentation than its
subject matter demands.  A little more soul-searching by Martin's
character, which might have been provided had the relationship with
Davidovich been more developed, would have made it much stronger.</P>
