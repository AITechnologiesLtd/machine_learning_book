<P>As some of you may know... this is the movie that is "supposed to" compete
with Disney's Mulan.  I saw an advanced screening of the movie three weeks 
ago.  My original reaction to the movie was that "IT SUCKS" but the more I 
think about it, it's not that bad actually.  And I bought the soundtrack 
yesterday just for the heck of it.</P>
<PRE>There are seven new songs and two scores.  
The soundtrack features:        Leann Rimes
                                Celine Dion
                                Steve Perry
                                The Corrs
                                Bryan White
                                Gary Oldman
                                Andrea Bocelli
                                Eric Idle and Don Rickles</PRE>
<P>First impression:      The songs were produced by David Foster, thus Celine
Dion's appearance in the movie.  the songs are not "Broadway-like", the
singers don't act out as much like Disney musical features.  The folks at
Warner Bros are trying to get away from the traditional Disney music.  It's
a fresh start but it's still not as good as the music as in
say...Pocahontas.  The people singing do not go over the board as they would
again like Broadway.  </P>
<P>With the singing kept at bay, the emotional aspect of the songs are
compromised. Sometimes, the instrumental are louder than the voices so as
you can tell, the voices are not as emphasized.  Warner Bros might have
thought it was a good move, but I don't think so because the songs seem dull
and boring compared to Disney standards.  One thing that they made sure of
is that most of the songs are very radio-adult-contemporary-friendly.</P>
<P>I'll go through the songs one by one in order as they appear in the CD.</P>
<P>1. Looking Through Your Eyes by Leann Rimes
this song is the love theme in the movie.  I expected more from this Grammy
winner.  She delivered, but still not enough.  I also wanted more of a
distinction between the duet in the movie and Rimes' rendition.</P>
<PRE>2. I Stand Alone by Steve Perry
bad.  That's all I can say.  </PRE>
<P>3. The Prayer by Celine Dion
this is definitely the best song in the movie.  This is actually the song
that is played in the feature.  Celine is the singing voice for Lady
Julianne.  Celine is surprisingly effective and affective.  Very emotional.
She doesn't get very loud.  She's actually very subtle and her "prayer" is
believable.  When this song was played in the movie, it is the only song
that I felt truly involved in. Lyrics are good.  This song may be forgotten
because it's not catchy or memorably funny. While the other songs are really
dull, this one comes the closest to "Disney".</P>
<P>4. United We Stand - ensemble
opening anthem.  it pales in comparison to "Virginia Company" and "Steady as
the Beating Drum" anthems in Pocahontas.</P>
<P>5. On My Father's Wings - Andrea Corrs
Although her voice is limiting, she has a really nice soothing voice.  No
doubt about that.  The first part of the song is okay, but then it gets
routine-like. Needs more variation within the song.</P>
<P>6. Looking Through Your Eyes - Andrea Corrs and Bryan White
Same song that Leann Rimes sings.  After awhile through out the duet,
Bryan's voice gets a little irritating.  But then, Andrea's voice saves it
with her high-pitched singing.</P>
<P>7. Ruber - Gary Oldman
Bad.  Bad.  Bad.  More focussed on the plot than on the melody, but I don't
fault them for that.  But it's still bad.  Could've been more interesting.
Could've been better.  And as for Gary Oldman, not a bad job!  You were
pretty good at being bad!</P>
<P>8. I Stand Alone - Bryan White
I dont fault Bryan White... actually I kinda do. His delivery is not
believable.  What ever happened to Garrett's "Inner pain" for being blind?
Lyrics are not bad, but because the singing is softer than the instrumental,
it can't be emphasized or heard as much.  To me, it's not distinctive
enough.  Sounds very the same as Steve Perry's rendition</P>
<P>9. If I Didn't Have You - Eric Idle and Don Rickles
Not bad.  I found this song funny in the movie.  But it is no "Hakuna
Matata" or "A Friend Like Me".  But it's better than "A Guy Like You"</P>
<P>10. Dragon Attack/Forbidden Forest
11. The Battle
12. Looking Through Your Eyes (Instrumental)
all of these three are forgettable
I don't see a point why they had to make an instrumental version of Looking
Through Your Eyes.  The "orchestra" sounds like digital synthesizers to me.
Not a good arrangement.  Get away from the keyboards, Mr.David Foster.
13. The Prayer - Andrea Bocelli
great voice.  I like the translating parts.</P>
<P>Do I recommend seeing the movie?  Well... for little kids, sure why not?
I'm not too thrilled with the movie.  I give it a "B-".  But there are
certain redeeming aspects of the movie that I liked and took note of.  To
tell you the truth, I actually plan to see it again and I'm taking my little
brothers with me.  </P>
<P>Do I recommend buying the CD soundtrack?  I give the CD a "C"...well... go
see the movie first.... then decide.</P>
