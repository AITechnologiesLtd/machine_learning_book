<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Warning: the review includes an important spoiler in the first and last
paragraph.</P>
<P>There's a surprise that is revealed during the end credits: this
fascinating documentary turns out to be a mock-documentary, after it
hits you over the head with the problems facing many American workers
during the changing times of the 1990s and spends the entire film
looking like a real documentary. The film depicts a dramatization of
this fictional all-American small town called Dadetown, a seemingly
peaceful town that becomes polarized into fractions of yuppies versus
blue-collar types.</P>
<P>Russ Hexter, the 27-year-old writer-director, unexpectedly died of an
aortic aneurysm shortly after shooting the innovative film, cutting
short a possible brilliant career.</P>
<P>Prosperity and the virtues of living a quiet family life, in a sleepy
town in rural upstate New York, suddenly changes after the town's main
industry, Gorman metal works, once a renown manufacturer of airplane
parts, but due to declining economic circumstances, now unexcitingly has
come down off its high perch to make paper clips and staples in order
for the plant to remain open. A high tech company dealing in imaging
communication, called American Peripheral Imaging (API), has just moved
to town after getting tax breaks and finding the idealized small town it
was seeking for its workforce. The workforce is better paid, more highly
educated, and the workers come from the more sophisticated urban places,
which creates a cultural separation from them and the locals. To make
matters worse, the aim of API is to do away with the need for paper
products, which happens to be the exact opposite business aim of
Gorman's.</P>
<P>The documentary filmmakers originally came to Dadetown to do a 15-minute
PBS documentary about the small towns of America and stayed on for
months to cover the impending labor crisis that was growing worse. To
show you the attitudes of the town, they interview many of the locals
and newcomers: including, town council members, workers at Gorman's, and
managerial spokesmen from API.</P>
<P>The chasm between the locals and the newcomers is enormous, being caused
mostly by a cultural clash. Even as API tries to fit into the community
by donating a playground, they still can't win the locals over. The new
workers want changes in the town, such as more upscale shops, a bagel
shop and a modern movie multiplex. The longtime councilman, Bill
Parsons, the most beloved figure in town, who arranged for API to come
here in a secret sweetheart deal for the new company, suddenly dies.
Soon, because of downsizing, Gorman's lays off over a hundred workers
and the remaining workers fear the plant will close due to competition
because of cheaper labor from Third World countries.</P>
<P>Looking to blame someone at hand for their troubles, the layed off
workers start random violent acts against the newcomers, such as
throwing paint on their mailboxes, breaking house windows, trying to
scare an API homeowner living in a luxury house by leaving a gutted deer
on his front steps, and the local kids vandalize the gift playground.</P>
<P>The documentary filmmaker while trying to be objective and have his
cameras be everywhere, is accused of being intrusive and bias by the
locals.</P>
<P>The general problems covered are what is happening across America. And,
the new town industry, a Silicon Valley high tech company, brings about
a renewed prosperity due to the need for more luxury housing and the
changing way the town looks, but is one of the underlying causes for the
bad times the workers at the old plant are going through. The tragedy
lies in the old workers who lose their jobs and can't afford to live in
town anymore unless they get retrained and are lucky enough to get work
in the new industry.</P>
<P>That it was not for real, does take away a lot of the film's impact and
poignancy, but still it leaves the viewer with a sense that it cut
through something perplexing that is currently happening, that is part
of the human drama that causes some strange behavior to emerge. Hexter
has thrown open a look at all the social, political, and economic
factors involved in the evolution of a small town, and he has done a
nice job in showing the human tragedy above all else as being the most
important thing to consider, even though in the bigger picture things
might look like they are working out, there's still a face you have to
put on someone who loses his job.</P>
