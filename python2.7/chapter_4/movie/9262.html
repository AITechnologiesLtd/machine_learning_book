<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>As the summer films begin to dwindle in numbers at theatres, it
becomes increasingly clear that in 1997, only two films have been
able to breach the gulf between specialty theatres and the mainstream
to become indisputable crossover successes -- Victor Nunez's family
drama ULEE'S GOLD and Peter Cattaneo's striptease comedy THE FULL
MONTY, both of which in recent months improbably made appearances in
weekend domestic Top 10 box office totals, typically dominated by
mainstream fare.  (One could also make a case for John Madden's
historical drama MRS BROWN and Masayuki Suo's uplifting SHALL WE
DANCE? as similar crossover successes; neither of them were able to
crack weekend box office Top 10 listings, but they have both had
long, relatively successful runs.)</P>
<P>As has been well publicized, the focus of THE FULL MONTY is a group
of unemployed men who, inspired by the success of a visiting troupe
of Chippendale dancers, form a striptease act in order to scrape up
some money.  The kicker is that our protagonists are not the hunky
beefcakes which typify a lineup for the Chippendale dancers -- one is
decidedly overweight, two are scrawny, and the only two which know
how to perform anything resembling dance aren't exactly in the prime
of their youth anymore.  Uh oh.</P>
<P>The opening reels of THE FULL MONTY sets up the basic framework for
the predicament our heroes face in order to arrive at their
striptease solution.  Set in Sheffield, proudly proclaimed in a
sardonic 1970s promotion reel as a thriving, healthy "City On The
Move", we cut forward in time -- indeed, this may be the first film
I've seen where a title card reading "Twenty five years later"
precedes any live-action footage -- to a city rife with unemployment,
where the town's steel mills, its primary industry, have been shut
down.  Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and best friend Dave (Mark Addy) frequent
the local unemployment centre, ostensibly to write employment inquiry
letters, but spend most of their time instead playing cards.  Even
their priggish former steel mill foreman, Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), has
been released, humiliatingly putting him on equal terms with his
ex-employees.  It's an all-too-familiar situation in the contemporary
reality of working-class towns, where an aura of resigned
hopelessness, broken dreams, and wounded pride permeates the
environment.</P>
<P>However, THE FULL MONTY is such a determinedly cheerful film, full of
levity and upbeat moments, that there's no real sense of despair or
gloom in the characters' situation of unemployment; it's really a
superficial depiction of their dilemma.  Admittedly, given that the
film is a comedy, it would probably be inappropriate for THE FULL
MONTY to deeply delve into the characters' plights in a mournful and
downcast fashion, but the film is so jovial and spirited in nature
that the artifice of the construct of THE FULL MONTY is blindingly
clear and mildly distracting -- everything is centered around and in
service of the striptease storyline.</P>
<P>Simon Beaufoy's debut screenplay, save for the wickedly funny
premise, is a rather bland one.  THE FULL MONTY's protagonists are
essentially a group of collected idiosyncratic individuals who make
for unlikely pals, but the film gathers them together in a trite
manner which fails to fully exploit its full comic potential, and the
three principal characters are given would-be touching personal
subplots which are too familiar in nature (Gaz is threatened with
loss of shared custody for his obligatorily cute son due to his
inability to afford child support; Dave's insecurity with his
appearance results in a faltering relationship with his spouse;
Gerald, too ashamed to tell his wife about his lack of employment,
bravely continues a charade of heading off to work every morning) to
be as affecting as aspired.  THE FULL MONTY's characters are
consequently likable, but lack real depth and aren't particularly
compelling.</P>
<P>While THE FULL MONTY seems to explore aspects of social realism in a
halfhearted manner, there is a detectable momentum built up towards
the film's dance scenes, which are very funny indeed.  The scenes
where the uncoordinated men are being taught how to dance by Gerald
-- himself intuitively not the most obvious instructor for a
striptease endeavour, given that his dance repertoire seems to
consist primarily of amateur ballroom dancing; hardly suitable
credentials to school on the art of gyrating pelvises, one would
think -- are terribly amusing (two great scenes in this vein are
where one whips off his belt, lashing the fellow next to him, and
where Gaz twirls his leather jacket over his head, pelting onlookers
with spare change from his jacket pockets), while the group lineup
dance in the unemployment office to Donna Summer's "Hot Love", as
revealed in the film's trailers, is a real scream, an unadulterated
burst of infectious, joyous energy.</P>
<P>The ensemble cast in THE FULL MONTY is invariably solid, with the
standout performance coming from chameleonic Mr. Carlyle, who in a
role completely different from his most famous turn as the
temperamental Begbie in Danny Boyle's TRAINSPOTTING, shows great
expressiveness and demonstrates the ability to be irrepressibly brash
and unrestrainedly free-spirited while remaining empathic.  He makes
a fine central character in THE FULL MONTY, and shows promise as an
unconventional, down-to-earth leading man.</P>
<P>THE FULL MONTY is a feelgood crowd-pleaser, and inevitably, after the
film reaches its low point at the end of its second act, there is a
build up towards the big nightclub stripping performance which serves
as the film's showcase.  All loose ends are dutifully resolved in a
suitably upbeat manner, and in front of a full house, the boys
finally hit the stage to the strains of "You Can Leave Your Hat On".
They, of course, do not.</P>
