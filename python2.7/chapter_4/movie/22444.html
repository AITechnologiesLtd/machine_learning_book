<P>`How the Grinch Stole Christmas!' is a Holiday tradition for many
families, in the same regard as the Christmas turkey or decorations on
the tree. I, myself, can hardly think of a more rewarding manner to
spend a snowy evening in December than curling up and watching this
Holiday gem. It's 26 minutes of warmth, humor and moralizing that clicks
perfectly upon every viewing.</P>
<P>Everybody knows the Grinch. He is a pudgy, reprehensible green creature
with spindly fingers and a wicked heart that is two sizes too small. He
looks down from his desolate mountain cave toward the citizens of
Whoville, furrowing his brow and frowning the most hateful of frowns.
The Grinch is completely fed up with the Christmas celebrations of the
Who's: their annual singing at Town Square, the pretty decorations they
put up, and all of the aggravating noise that results from the Who girls
and boys playing with their new toys. The Grinch devises a plan - an
evil plan - to put a stop to all of this warmth and jubilation in
Whoville. He will disguise himself as Santa Claus, ride down the
mountainside in a sleigh, and steal all of the presents and decorations
in the happy little town.</P>
<P>`How the Grinch Stole Christmas!' is full of delightful Seussian humor,
which makes sense, because it was originally written by the incomparable
Dr. Seuss (aka Theodor Geisel, the King of rhyme). Some of the toy names
are particularly inventive in all of their exuberant, tongue-twisting
glory. And the musical numbers are absolutely wonderful, with everything
from the more traditional `Trim up the Tree' to my personal favorite,
the low-octave charmer `You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch'. The film is
narrated by the legendary Boris Karloff to sheer perfection, and the
three central characters are each memorable in their own separate way.
The Grinch himself is a villain to be remembered, his dog (or unwilling
reindeer) is cute and affectionate in his shy attempts to please his
master, and Cindy Loo Who (a tiny girl who stumbles upon `Santa' in the
act) is adorable. With all of this fun and imagination at work, how
could you not love this movie?</P>
<P>`The Grinch' originally aired on television in 1966, but it has grew in
popularity with every passing year. The animation is certainly nothing
special, but for the demands of a children's story, it is perfectly
rendered. Most importantly, `How the Grinch Stole Christmas!' strives
for a moral that everyone in the family can learn from. This Christmas,
dedicate a mere 26 minutes to this Holiday classic. `The Grinch' is one
Yuletide selection that will always be welcome in my book.</P>
