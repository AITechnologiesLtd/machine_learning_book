<P>Meet Joe Black, and then say good-bye to him.  Like an oddity you would
meet at a friend's party, Joe Black is the sort of guy that reminds you
of the person who sits in the corner for the duration of the party and
says nothing not because he's shy but because he just isn't
interesting.  Ditto for this character study?  Notice the question
mark.  180 minutes of mumbling, meandering and dull facial expressions
are inexcusable from a director, Maritn Brest, who has been responsible
for film gems such as 'Going in Style', 'Beverly Hills Cop' and 'Scent
of a Woman'.  Talented in every sense of the word, Brest makes his films
technically flat and academically exciting as his characters always
stand out and Brest's sub text isn't always challenging but his films
are usually captivating and always entertaining.  What's more shocking
is how a pair of actors like Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt can read a
script and not use the chef's line...."It needs more flavouring!"  In
the dictionary under "bland", you will see a description of this movie.
The most disappointing thing about this movie is that its last half hour
is great and I don't understand why the same technique wasn't applied to
the rest of the film.</P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins is a media mogul whose decency as a person shines
through at every turn.  He loves his family, misses his late wife, has
not re-married for the sake of his enormous wealth and resists the idea
of making a deal with a rival to merge with his company and under mind
his life's work.  Hopkins wakes up one morning and hears a strange voice
that keeps saying "Yes."  The key to the film's story is his daughter
(Claire Forlani), a medical intern who meets an un-named man (Brad Pitt)
in a coffee shop one day.  She's pretty much an item with her father's
right hand man in business but finds that it's more of a business
arrangement and her father can sense this.  After striking up a
conversation with Pitt at the coffee shop, the two of them obviously
feel struck by the love thunderbolt.  They part strangely outside and as
she goes one way and turns the corner, he goes the other and watches her
fade from sight while standing in the middle of the street and is hit by
a car.</P>
<P>Hopkins experiences chest pains at the office and convulses and hears
the strange voice again and later that night before dinner, he hears it
again and is visited by what we learn is death (yes, the grim reaper)
who has assumed Pitt's body and wants a lesson in life before taking
Hopkins to the next world and the two of them know that their time left
on Earth is short.  Hopkins is able to reflect on his life and Forlani
thinks that the body she sees is the man from the coffee shop and the
film explains things clearly later, although there is no reason for this
film to be three hours in length.</P>
<P>When I think of films such as 'The Godfather', 'Citizen Kane' and other
movie classics that can tell a story in less time than this film, I'm
appalled.  'Meet Joe Black' has brief musical interludes here and there,
too many close-ups and much of the dialogue is barely audible giving the
impression that it could pass as a silent film if subtitles were added
which would probably get the words across more clearly than the
underachieving vocal chords of the cast.</P>
<P>Based loosely on the 1934 classic 'Death Takes a Holiday', 'Meet Joe
Black' is written by Ron Osborn, Jeff Reno, Kevin Wade and the brilliant
Bo Goldman who is way off the mark by allowing his name, along with
director Martin Brest to be attached to this film.</P>
<P>'Meet Joe Black' is not a bad movie.  It is, however, a very under
achieving and disappointing one.  It has no punch to move an emotional
nerve in the body of a movie fan and while a film like '2001: A Space
Odyssey' can be hypnotic and mistaken as boring, 'Meet Joe Black'
doesn't even have the technical supplements to warrant being what it is,
flat and unappealing.</P>
