<P>"A Little Bit of Soul," an Australian film, directed by Peter Duncan (1997's 
"Children of the Revolution"), is about as crazy as a mental patient and just 
about as painful as poking your eyeballs out with a sharp scalpel. What 
starts off as a subdued comedy takes an unforeseen downward turn south (in 
more ways than one; think about it) and becomes a preposterous, asinine 
horror movie (also, in more ways than one) that is about as subtle as a 
freight train crashing into your house.</P>
<P>As the film opens, a down-on-his-luck scientist, Dr. Richard Shorkinghorn 
(David Wenham), who believes he has discovered the key to stopping the aging 
process based on experiments with chickens, is invited for the weekend to the 
home of Grace Michael (Heather Mitchell), of the Michael Foundation, for 
potential funding. Once Richard arrives, he is discouraged to find that his 
ex-girlfriend and ex-research assistant, Kate (Frances O'Connor), has also 
been invited for the weekend, and whoever convinces Grace the most 
successfully will be the one who receives the money. Also present at Grace's 
country house is her evidently twisted husband, Godfrey Usher (Geoffrey 
Rush). The weekend grows more and more curious after one of their other 
guests is found dead in the bathroom, of an apparently very bloody suicide. 
Predict all you want to what's going on with Grace and Godfrey, but you are 
never going to figure it out.</P>
<P>The twist that comes midway through "A Little Bit of Soul" is so inanely 
far-fetched and loony that the only excuse for the movie's ludicrous nature 
is that director Peter Duncan was taken over by an escapee from an insane 
asylum. Either that, or...you get the picture. One of the most confusing 
things about the film is the question of what genre the movie belongs in. As 
the press release makes note, is it supposed to be a "Howard Hawksian 30's 
comedy," a bloody horror movie, or something in between? The problem is, the 
movie has all of two laughs with the rest just posing as an embarrassment for 
the good actors, and the movie is more imbecilic than scary. One thing's for 
sure: after the first 45 minutes, the film unplants itself so loosely from 
reality that it definitely transforms itself into a sort of dark fantasy. 
Make that a dark fantasy without an ounce of sense or vacant thought.</P>
<P>Scene after scene, the four actors run around trying to add energy or an air 
of "knowing" ridicule to compensate for their foolish decision to star in the 
film to begin with. Of the thespians, Geoffrey Rush turned in a star-making, 
Oscar-nominated performance in 1996's "Shine" before wasting his time since 
in numerous inferior roles that do not do justice to his talent. Frances 
O'Connor (1997's "Kiss or Kill") is the standout here, if there is one, but 
only because she is such a fresh face that I felt bad watching her and 
everyone else destroy their careers just a little bit more with this turkey. 
David Wenham, the main actor in the piece, is a dull presence and seriously 
miscast, considering that both female characters are supposed to lust after 
him even though he could put an insomniac to sleep and has no distinctive 
physical features. And Heather Mitchell, who I don't believe I've seen 
before, may be a fine actress, but you can't tell it with this role. The big 
mystery regarding the cast is how they would even consider making such a 
lame-brained movie in the first place, especially when none of them have a 
challenging character to work with. The only challenge they apparently had 
with this film is trying not to look like a bunch of morons.</P>
<P>So what exactly was director Duncan's purpose for making "A Little Bit of 
Soul?" Is there any sort of point to be made about anything, or an actual 
purpose for the wacky "twist" that he has in store for the (unlucky) viewers 
who may stumble into a theater playing this? Even the superb music by Ted 
Hawkins and Louis Armstrong is poorly-used, as it appears in practically 
every scene to the point of annoyance, and is clearly trying to cover up the 
story flaws. "A Little Bit of Soul" has sat on the shelf for close to three 
years awaiting release in the U.S., and after viewing the film, I now know 
why. There is, frankly, no good reason that this ill-conceived movie ever 
needed to be made.</P>
