<PRE>                                SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE
                       A film review by Keith Meng-Wei Loh
                        Copyright 1993 Keith Meng-Wei Loh</PRE>
<P>     SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is every bit the equal of WHEN HARRY MET
SALLY, the movie to which most reviewers will be making their
comparisons what with Nora Ephron (writer and director), the gorgeous
and funny Meg Ryan, the beaming-smile romance, kismet, dialogue to die
for, acting in every corner as precious as diamonds in a large jewelry
store and even a bit part with Rob Reiner thrown in.</P>
<P>     This is a movie which will make you smile for an hour after it is
finished.  I've been very lucky going to the movies recently, running
into a quite a few very magical, very good looking films like MAP OF
THE HUMAN HEART and LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE.  SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is
a capper to what has been a very good spring-summer.</P>
<P>     Two stellar performances from Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are jewels
amid the many funny characters inhabiting SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.  Meg
Ryan is a comedic actress of the first rank, perhaps of the only rank.
She's designed for everyone to fall in love with.  Tom Hanks,
thankfully, has lost many of his kidstuff mannerisms and puts forward a
mature and thoughtful performance as a widower who thinks he can never
find love again.  There is one scene, however, in which Hanks' comedic
skills really blows the audience over.</P>
<P>     The real star is the writing.  Nora Ephron is a genius.  The
dialogue is fast and witty and every bit as intelligent as in WHEN
HARRY MET SALLY.  The story is mature without losing its essential
magic, in that two people from opposite sides of America can find each
other through a radio show.  When I brought up MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART
and LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE I meant to compare their themes of love
and magic and happenstance. SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is full of the same
romantic fantasy but in a way that makes the me feel that the same
thing could happen to me.</P>
<P>     SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is beautifully shot, as well.  Three cities
are photographed like post cards: Baltimore, New York and Seattle each
have an atmosphere that comes through the screen.  And have I ever seen
a lingering look, a look of grief as powerful as this?  Simply, not
that I can remember.</P>
