WHIPPED
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>How's this for an original concept?  A bunch of young adult males spend 
their time hitting on women for sex and then lying among themselves 
later about their exploits.  Pretty tired.  The only possible twist in 
writer/director/producer Peter M. Cohen's WHIPPED is whether the women 
are as innocent and vulnerable as they seem or whether they are scamming 
the men just like they are being scammed.  The twist, of course, is no 
twist at all since anyone with any intelligence whatsoever can guess it.</P>
<P>All of this might be ignored if there was good acting or a bright 
script.  WHIPPED, however, features some of the worst acting this side 
of a high school play.  The movie, which badly wants to be a THERE'S 
SOMETHING ABOUT MARY version of DINER, has a script that is disgustingly 
crude but almost never funny.  Its repulsive humor includes anal-oral 
sex on someone who suffers from diarrhea.  The talented Farrelly 
brothers might find a way to make this scene work, but Cohen is in no 
danger of being mistaken for a third Farrelly brother.</P>
<P>The film's four obnoxious fellows like to hang out at their favorite 
diner and talk dirty -- very dirty and very loud.  Their shoot their 
favorite questions at each other -- "Did you nail her?"  "Did you stuff 
her?" -- with salivating coarseness.  The movie's harsh sound makes 
listening to them about as enjoyable as enduring a heavy rainstorm under 
a cheap metal roof.</P>
<P>The leader of the pack and the self-described "good catch" is named Brad 
(Brian Van Holt).  He is a broker with an electronic stock ticker over 
his bed.  Zeke (Zorie Barber) is a martial arts type who likes to buy 
extra-large-sized condoms although he needs extra small.  Told that he 
needs to be nice to women, he replies with "Man, that sucks!"  Jonathan 
(Jonathan Abrahams), called "fag boy" by the others, is an obsessive 
masturbator who worries that we might think he is gay.  He carefully 
dispels this notion by confiding to the camera that he isn't homosexual 
and is just more in touch with his feminine side than his friends.</P>
<P>The odd-man out is the constantly blinking Eric (Judah Domke), an 
unhappily married guy.  He was in charge of "jumping on the grenade" 
when the four of them used to cruise bars looking for chicks.  He would 
jump on the ugliest one to save the other guys.  He married one of these 
"grenades" and now relegates himself to using various pieces of kitchen 
cutlery to spice up their sex life.</P>
<P>Mel, who is the proud owner of a 5-speed that's not a bicycle, meets and 
falls for each of the guys, except Eric.  In the first act, the men talk 
about her constantly but somehow never manage to mention her name so 
that they don't realize that they are dating the same woman.  In the 
second act, they find out but still keep dating her.  And in the third 
and final act, their situation gets resolved exactly as you would 
expect.</P>
<P>Consider what this movie teaches the teenage and young adult audience 
for which the movie is clearly aimed.  Sex is only something to be 
"scammed" from someone and to be snickered at.  The movie reinforces 
this by making the sex acts themselves happen fast and under cover.  
After making sex so filthy, they certainly wouldn't want to show it to 
us.  The act of love is considerably cheapened by this film without any 
comedic payoff in return.  Our packed audience, which had just the right 
demographics for the picture, produced only sporadic and scattered 
laugher.</P>
<P>On a more positive note.  The film is short -- albeit not near short 
enough.</P>
<P>WHIPPED runs 1:25.  It is rated R for strong sexual content and language 
and would be acceptable for college students and older.</P>
