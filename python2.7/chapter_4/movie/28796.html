<PRE>THE BLACKOUT
A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>One of these days, I'll make good on my promise never to rent another
Abel Ferrara movie.  King of New York and Body Snatchers notwithstanding
(and Bad Lieutenant is only fit for a single, emotive viewing), his
exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art-house
trappings.  It's a perfume-drenched, coke-addled visit to the seedy
pornography shop, where beautiful models (no, hookers -- no, courtesans)
usher you through the silk curtains.</P>
<P>Ferrara's only consistently smart move has been casting Christopher
Walken over and over again, since Walken can make a good movie great and
a loathsome movie durable whenever he's onscreen.  His 8-minute scene in
The Addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal,
unwatchable, and pretentious failure.  When he starts talking about his
vampiric bowel movements, or questions whether Lili Taylor has ever read
Naked Lunch, there's a much-needed dose of humor in an otherwise
terminally unfunny affair.  You know those Gothic club kids who are too
cool to smile and let you know they're actually having fun?  The
Addiction is that movie.</P>
<P>Walken, sadly, does not appear in The Blackout.  The central role of
Matty, a junkie film star whose lightning paced Hollywood life among the
beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction, is played by
Matthew Modine (who takes what he can get after Cutthroat Island).  Much
like the protagonists of Michelangelo Antonioni's terminally bored
cultural elite, Matty is involved in a bitter pill "relationship" with
high fashioned model Annie (at least I think she's a model.)  Matty's
lady is played by French actress Béatrice Dalle, arrested twice for
cocaine possession during filming of The Blackout -- not that you needed
to know that, but it lends credence to the idea that Ferrara's entire
oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout.  No kidding.  Requiem For
a Dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in Ferrara's movies
and his controversial urban lifestyle.</P>
<P>Matty and Annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without
consulting him.  No doubt, he was off chasing the dragon.  In his
despair, Matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery,
tooling around the streets of Miami with video filmmaker Mickey Wayne
(Dennis Hopper, in full "dirty ol' man" mold smacking models on the ass
and telling them to spread their legs.  Wider!)  Toward the end of the
night, they pick up a teenage waitress also named Annie (Sarah Lassez),
start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene, then Matty thankfully
blacks out.  Something happened that night which haunts him throughout
the rest of the movie, and it's exactly what you think it was.  Suffice
to say, there's some confusion over whether he killed Annie One or Annie
Two, or anyone at all.</P>
<P>The Blackout is typical Ferrara: no plot to speak of, plenty of raunch,
and horribly vogue images of Matthew Modine downing a bottle of Jack
Daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see-through curtain in
his hotel room by the sea, by the sea, by the beautiful sea. 
Cinematographer Ken Kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating
gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu-style sleaze (and we're back to
Dennis Hopper leering at girls in bathing suits.  "Yeah!!! YEAH!!! 
ARRRGHHH!" says Mr. Hopper.  Dirty old sod.)</P>
<P>It's compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way, leading to a ridiculous
climax where Modine seizes control of his destiny.  How's that for
cryptic?  Never fear -- Ferrara finds time for some female full frontal
nudity to remind us what he's all about.  I can picture it now.  "Take
off yer clothes, kid -- it's essential to depict the inner maelstrom of
my central protagonist, and you're his visual id.  You're the soul, the
heart, the bloodstream of the picture.  Take it off!  TAKE IT ALL
OFF!!!  HA HA HA!"  Friggin' vampire.  Yeah, you, Ferrara.</P>
<P>A final word about Matthew Modine: He's actually a fine actor when
properly cast, but there's something too squeaky-clean in his demeanor. 
He's ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations,
such as his Private Joker in Full Metal Jacket or the time-bomb nebbish
in Short Cuts (who is every bit as superb as Julianne Moore in that
famous scene, though no one seems to notice him).  [He was in that
scene? -Ed.]  Here, he's asked to let it all hang out, sporting a
three-day stubble and oily bangs.  He throws around furniture like
Stanley Kowalski, but it's somehow lacking.  Modine lacks the feral
intensity of Brando, entirely miscast in Ferrara's flesh fair.  Better
luck next time, Matt.  Someday, you'll be forgiven for Cutthroat Island,
which wasn't really your fault in the first place.  Maybe Atom Egoyan
will find a place for you somewhere, and all will once again be well in
your world.</P>
