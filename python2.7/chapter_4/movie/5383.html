<P>     The rapid-fire formula that worked so well in AIRPLANE!, the
"Police Squad!" television series, TOP SECRET!, three NAKED GUN films,
and two HOT SHOTS!  movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with
SPY HARD.  Even Ezio Gregio's THE SILENCE OF THE HAMS is arguably
funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof.  Leslie
Nielsen stars as secret agent WD-40, who returns from retirement to
battle his old nemesis, General Rancor (a cackling Andy Griffith).  The
jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint,
timing, or tact.  Most the movie is comprised of recycled AIRPLANE and
NAKED GUN gags, recreated movie sequences, and soggy star cameos.  Yeah,
maybe we *do* need Ray Charles driving an L.A. bus bound for a SPEED
bump, but did Mr. T, Hulk Hogan, and Dr. Joyce Brothers also have to
appear in the same movie?</P>
<P>     Leslie Nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair.  There
is something oddly inspiring about the sight of Nielsen wearing a nun's
habit, even the resulting SISTER ACT spoof is silly.  As are the bits
directly lifted from HOME ALONE, PULP FICTION, TRUE LIES, etc. etc.
(Adolescent males might enjoy this mess, tho.  The butt shots, breast
peeks, penis pokes, flatulence gags, and related innuendo are right up
Beavis and Butthead's alley.) Beyond the hilarious title sequence with
"Weird" Al Yankovich performing the theme song, SPY HARD is barely the
stock that it's printed on.  My recommendation:  duck in while you're
waiting for another movie to start.  Stay long enough to see the camera
dart inside of Weird Al's nostril and then leave.  You won't miss a
thing.</P>
