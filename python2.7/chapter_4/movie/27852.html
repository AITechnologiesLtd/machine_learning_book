IRIS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Aurelio Grimaldi's IRIS is a charming little story about a day in the 
life of a first grade girl named Maria.  Maria is played by the winsome 
Arancia Cecilia Grimaldi, a girl with a big smile and adult front teeth 
just peaking through.  On a sunny day on Ustica, a beautiful Italian 
island, Maria has her heart set on getting a bunch of "those blue 
flowers" for her Mama for her birthday.</P>
<P>A girl on a mission but with only enough money to buy one Iris, she goes 
on a long walk to where her father, a bricklayer, is working.  The 
florist told her to get the money from her father, whom Maria, 
incorrectly, assumes has "lots." Along the way in this sweet story, she 
encounters everything from a barking dog to a topless swimmer.  One 
briefly creepy scene amply demonstrates the downside of letting young 
kids roam on their own.  IRIS is quite a simple story but a 
heart-warming one.</P>
<P>IRIS runs a fast 1:16.  The film is in Italian with English subtitles.  
It is not rated but would probably be stuck with an R because of the 
topless swimmer scene, something common in Europe but not the U.S.  The 
film would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.</P>
