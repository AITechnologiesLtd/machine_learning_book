<PRE>**The Peacemaker**
Reviewed by Jeff Walters</PRE>
<P>           Disappointment #2. Well not so much a dissappointment,
everyone I'd talked to before hand regarding this movie
had made it clear that this was nothing special. But I still was
hoping to be pleasantly surprised by 'The Peacemaker' which truth be
known was actually made over a year ago but only released recently.
Not to be though. Ordinary is the word that pops to mind when I think
of this film. Plain ordinary. </P>
<P>               The acting is not really worth focusing on much because
the two lead characters were so weak and undeveloped.
The audience feels no real attachment to Kidman or Clooney's character
(particularly Clooney's brain-dead Colonel Thomas Devoe) and the two
emotional sequences between the two fizzle badly and seem like carbon
copies of each other. The villian was actually not too bad, the
writers opted for a little extra originality here by making him an
ordinary man with very little fighting skills.</P>
<P>               What saves this movie from being an outright stinker is
a couple of nifty action  sequences that kept the audience involved to
a certain degree. The first of these is at the start of the film which
involves two trains and some nice camera work. This scene is
practically given away in the previews for the movie but is fresh
enough so that it sets up a nice tense atmosphere. The special effects
for the resulting nuclear explosion  that closes the scene is fairly
budget, but doesn't looks so cheesy that it ruins the scene.</P>
<P>               The best scene is really no contest and appears about
two thirds into the film. A trio of helicopters penetrates
Russian airspace in an attempt to halt a truck carrying some very
dangerous cargo before it can cross the border into Iran. This scene
is a real show stopper from start to finish and really grabbed my
attention after my mind was starting to drift from the dull and
somewhat idiotic earlier parts.</P>
<P>               The climax sequence in the streets of New York City is
pretty well done and does put you on the edge of your seat
 to a certain degree when everyone is madly searching for a bomber.
This however leads to a fairly dull and predictable confrontation
scene that we've all seen before many many times. </P>
<P>               Now onto the 'idiotic earlier parts' I mentioned above.
What I am referring to here is a lengthy sequence that occurs
 around 40 minutes into the film. This involves Kidman and Clooney
'interrogating' a trucking executive in his own office and then their
following escape. This part was so dumb it defies description.
Seriously. Suspension of disbelief, once again, only stretches so far.
Devoe's actions in this series of events are simply S T U P I D.
Unfortunately stupidity is a common thread throughout The Peacemaker.</P>
<P>               The Peacemaker failed at the box office and it's not
hard to see why. It's a long time since I've seen weaker
chemistry between male and female leads. The movie's saving grace is
some exciting action sequences that draw the auidence back in and
that's the only way it got 2.5/5 stars in my book. See it if you feel
you can survive till the 1 1/4 hour mark when things start to pick up.</P>
<PRE>2 1/2 stars out of 5</PRE>
