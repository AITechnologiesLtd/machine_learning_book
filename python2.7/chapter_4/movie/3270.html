<PRE>                            MIAMI RHAPSODY
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: David Frankel writes and tries to
          carve out a piece of Woody Allen territory with
          this film that borrows much of the style we
          associate with Allen.  His story is just too slight
          to hold the gags together.  Rating: 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     David Frankel, who wrote and directed MIAMI RHAPSODY, has a style
much too close to Woody Allen's to be a coincidence.  He starts with a
jazz song, Louis Armstrong's rendition of "Just One of Those Things,"
under fairly plain-looking credits.  Allen would use white on black,
Frankel uses lavender on black, but it clearly is a conscious
imitation.  And the dialogue has the main character making just the
sort of wisecracks that Woody Allen would write.  And at least an
imitation of Allen at his most creative would be amusing.
Unfortunately, the story is slight and more than a little boring.  Part
of the problem is that the whole plot can be described in two
sentences.  I will not divulge the second sentence here, but the first
is that Gwyn Marcus (Sarah Jessica Parker) cannot commit to her
relationship with her fiance because every other couple she knows hasa
relationship that is falling apart because of infidelity.  The plot,
told in flashback and flashbacks-within-flashbacks goes through one
relationship after another, mostly in her own family, and each
relationship has one or both people fooling around on the side.  The
plot has more detail than that, of course, but it all adds up to Gwyn's
unwillingness to commit in her relationship.  Parker's Gwyn narrates
the film staring right into the camera, then popping into connecting
dramatized anecdotes about her family.  Her father (Paul Mazursky),
himself a philanderer, correctly suspects her mother of infidelity.
The mother is played by Mia Farrow who appears in this imitation Woody
Allen film purely for the artistic challenge of the role, no doubt.
Other flashbacks show Gwyn's siblings, each totally self-absorbed and
happy to cheat on any relationship he or she has.</P>
<P>     Sarah Jessica Parker is clearly a Woody-Allen-like character,
alternately indignant and sarcastic.  One can almost hear Allen's
delivery of some of her lines.  But she has a good delivery and a
screen presence that may get noticed after this film.  Antonio Banderas
plays Antonio, the male nurse of Gwyn's grandmother who gets involved
with the weird relationships in the Marcus family.  Gil Bellows is
Gwyn's fiance, who seems likable enough in the role as just about the
only decent person in the film, but he does not have a lot to do.
Kevin Pollak is also memorable as Gwyn's older brother who leaves his
own pregnant wife for the wife of his business partner.</P>
<P>     Perhaps MIAMI RHAPSODY could have worked better as a comedy with
more likable characters.  Instead there is a cold satisfaction in the
poetic justice that these characters are screwing up their lives and
will likely continue to do so.  In spite of the warm Miami settings,
this is a cold comedy about people it is hard to like or care about.
The story is told with affection for this family, but Frankel is not
yet a good enough writer to make us care for his characters.  This film
gets a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
