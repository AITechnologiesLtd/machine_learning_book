<P>Made in 1962 on a shoestring budget of only $15,000, Herk Harvey's 
"Carnival of Souls" is not a perfect film by any stretch of the 
imagination, but when considering its low-budget and amateur actors, it 
turned out about as good as could possibly be expected. The film is like 
a nightmarish puzzle, one that you think you've figured out, but really 
haven't until the final twist arrives in the last scene.</P>
<P>The film begins abruptly, as a carload of young women are challenged to 
a drag-race by some guys. While passing over a narrow bridge, the 
women's car accidentally loses control and plunges into a deep river. 
Hours later, as the police have arrived and are attempting to find the 
car in its deep watery grave, one of the passengers of the ill-fated 
car, Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss), miraculously appears climbing out 
of the river. Not remembering anything about the accident, and looked 
upon by everyone as a miracle, Mary immediately moves to a small town in 
Utah to play as the church organist. She rents out a room from a kind, 
elderly landlady (Frances Feist), meets and is somewhat charmed by the 
other resident of the home, John Linden (Sidney Berger), and attempts to 
begin putting the pieces of her life back together. Everything is not 
perfect, however, as Mary begins to frequently see a ghoulish, 
frightening phantom figure everywhere she goes, even though no one else 
claims to see anything. Is it simply a hallucination, sparked from the 
trauma of the car crash? Not only that, but Mary also begins to feel a 
sort of connection to an adjacent, closed-down, desolate amusement park.</P>
<P>At a decidedly too-brisk 75-minute running time, "Carnival of Souls" 
moves at a gradual, dream-like pace that makes it almost impossible not 
get caught up in the proceedings. And although only with a miniscule 
budget, since its release, the film has quickly become a cult classic 
for all horror afficionados. Even George Romero has mentioned, in fact, 
that he got his idea for 1968's "Night of the Living Dead" from 
"Carnival of Souls," and it is obvious that so did David Lynch when he 
made "Blue Velvet," "Twin Peaks," and "Lost Highway." That these 
filmmakers were influenced by such a "petty" movie from the early-'60s 
proves of the extraordinary power that the film ultimately holds, both 
in its storytelling techniques and glorious style.</P>
<P>Candace Hilligoss, an unknown who was cast in the lead role, contains 
just the right amounts of vulnerability and strong will to bring Mary to 
life as a sympathetic character. One of the major highlights of 
"Carnival of Souls" is the magnificently atmospheric, brooding 
black-and-white cinematography that paints the settings, including the 
unforgettable images of the somehow off-kilter amusement park, as major 
characters themselves. The sequences of Mary simply walking around the 
eerie park, which is out on the dock of a bay, are some of those rare 
moments in motion picture history that will forever be ingrained in my 
long-term memory.</P>
<P>The story goes that director Herk Harvey scratched the money together to 
make "Carnival of Souls," but never made another film again. That's 
really too bad, since he obviously was a major filmmaking talent and I 
would have loved to have seen a sophomore effort. Ultimately, Harvey 
died in 1996, but left, in his memory, his one and only film, a movie 
that affected, as well as inspired, many different people, thanks to its 
untarnished storyline and visual expertise. </P>
<P>Note: Viewing this motion picture right before its direct-to-video 1999 
remake, I was appalled to see how much the '90s version trashed the 
memory of this classic. By complicating the story from its originally 
simple premise, the makers of the '99 edition simply made everything 
feel contrived, as well as frustrating and confusing. And, tellingly 
enough, the original "Carnival of Souls" is also infinitely more 
disturbing, even though it was made thirty-seven years ago. It's aged 
very well.</P>
