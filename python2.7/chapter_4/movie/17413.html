<PRE>The Winners
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) "Unfortunately, there are many great pianists who don't
have careers." -- Lawrence Tucker, Columbia Artists</P>
<P>The lack of demand for classical music is just one of the pitfalls young
musicians face, even exceptionally talented ones. THE WINNERS
is a documentary that looks at four winners of a world renowned Belgian
music competition. Each has worked hard to forge his career in music,
and yet world fame and worldly fortune have eluded them all.</P>
<P>The most cheerful of the four is Berl Senofsky, an American who teaches
music in Baltimore. He entered the competition just to see where he
stood in relation to his colleagues. In this documentary he looks back
on a life well-lived. He has no regrets and seems to truly enjoy what he
does.</P>
<P>Yevgen Moguilevsky is a timid Russian pianist whose career was damaged
for twenty years because the USSR wouldn't let him leave the country (he
was labeled "politically unreliable"). During the filming of the
documentary, he was getting photographed for the cover of a new
recording, but Lawrence Tucker, his new manager, confides to the camera
that the novelty of a Russian pianist is wearing off now that the cold
war is over, and that Moguilevsky may not have the "swagger" necessary
to make it big.</P>
<P>Mikhail Bezverkhny comes across as a perfectionist, and as such, the
classical music business has taken a toll on him. One of the most
telling scenes involving Bezverkhny shows him berating his accompanist
(also his wife) over a detail most people can't hear. At the start of
his career, he couldn't practice in his first apartment because his
neighbors wouldn't tolerate the classical music. He had to buy an old
van in which to practice. He complains that the globalization of
classical music has caused musicians and audiences to sink to a low,
common, "gray" level of performance which is unsatisfying for him.</P>
<P>The musician who's had the roughest breaks is perhaps Philipp
Hirschhorn. His early career was the most promising of the four. His
contemporaries had him pegged for worldwide fame and importance, and the
archival footage supports their claim. Yet at the time of the interview
(he died shortly thereafter) he had been forced to give up his career in
music because of cancer. His tone and mannerisms make it clear he had
not yet come to terms with his loss - he builds an emotional wall that
denies the importance of music in his life.</P>
<P>Some might see "The Winners" as an ironic title. After all, its subjects
are not household names, even in the most musical of houses.</P>
<P>But I don't think filmmakers Paul Cohen and David van Tijn intended it
that strongly. Their subjects have all pursued careers in music --
recording, performing, and teaching. All still work in music, and two
still perform for a living. Bezverkhny is shown playing for the King and
Queen of Belgium and Moguilevsky is beginning a new American contract.
All four are a far cry from being losers, and they all make interesting
subjects for a documentary.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the bitter point is made that bad luck, ill health, or the
wrong personality can easily keep one from achieving the world renown
that is the unspoken dream of so many musicians.</P>
