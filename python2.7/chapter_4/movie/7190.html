<P>     You've got to hand it to Saban Entertainment, keepers of the Power
Rangers franchise.  In the notoriously fickle business of children's
entertainment and merchandising, the Rangers have survived by changing
just enough to keep their young fans interested.  Costumes have been
updated; new iterations of action figures have filled the shelves.  Even
characters have been replaced in rejuvenating line-up changes, making the
Rangers akin to a super-powered Menudo.  Yet the most misguided changes to
date have been those in 1995's lifeless MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS: THE
MOVIE, which substituted high-tech hardware for low-tech charm.  TURBO: A
POWER RANGERS MOVIE is still dopey kiddie fare, but it's an improvement
over MMPR:TM by orders of magnitude, with a couple more changes still up
its sleeve.</P>
<P>     The Power Rangers are, of course, a team of teen do-gooders from
Angel Grove, currently consisting of Tommy (Jason David Frank), Adam
(Johnny Yong Bosch), Catherine (Catherine Sutherland), Tanya (Nakia
Burrise) and Rocky (Steve Cardenas).  The film begins with a karate
practice during which Rocky is injured, leaving the Rangers short-handed
at a particularly inopportune time.  it seems that evil galactic pirate
Divatox (Hilary Shepard Turner) has a plan to unleash a demon and gain
untold riches, a plan requiring the magic of a benevolent gnome-like
wizard named Lerigot (Jon Simanton).  When Lerigot flees to earth,
Divatox pursues, and the Rangers take on the task of protecting Lerigot
and foiling Divatox's nefarious scheme.</P>
<P>    It can be a monumental effort for anyone over 12 to make it through
Power Rangers material, simply because it is so steadfastly simplistic.
The Rangers themselves are distinguishable from one another strictly by
their color-coded clothing, making the line-up changes as significant
Curly Joe replacing Joe in the Three Stooges.  Low-brow comic relief is
provided by the dim-witted Bulk and Skulk (Jason Narvy and Paul Schrier)
and the incessantly "Ay-yi-yi!"-ing robot side-kick Alpha, and the plots
are elemental fantasy tales with an "Afterschool Special" moral usually
tacked on somewhere.  TURBO adds to the mix a lovable little character
who can heal with a touch and can't survive long on earth...no, not E.T.,
but an incredible simulation in the Muppet-faced Lerigot.</P>
<P>     The formula is so unshakeable in its blandness that, within the
context of the Rangers universe, the twists TURBO serves up can only be
described as ingenious.  The smartest is the inclusion of 10-year-old
Justin (Blake Foster) filling the Blue Ranger costume of the incapacitated
Rocky.  When he morphs, Justin instantly becomes a buffed, battling
teenager who gets to drive a souped-up truck; it's such an obvious child's
fantasy that it's astonishing nobody thought of it sooner.  It's also nice
to have someone repeating the Rangers' morphing mantra of "Awesome!" who
doesn't sound like an immature nit-wit while doing it.  Another nice idea
brings back Ranger alumni Kimberly (Amy Jo Johnson) and Jason (Austin St.
James), who become prisoners of Divatox and eventually transform into evil
dopplegangers who battle their former teammates.  The appearance is good
for a gasp of recognition from long-time Ranger watchers, but it also
gives the characters a dose of personality they never had as heroes.</P>
<P>     Kimberly and Jason actually spend most of their screen time trying to
break out of the cargo hold of Divatox's ship, and those scenes are
surprisingly well-crafted and tense.  For an action film designed for
children, TURBO is actually rather restrained, with more emphasis on
suspenseful escapes than special effects-laden free-for-alls.  There are
only a couple of lengthy fight scenes, and the Rangers in their full
costumed glory are saved for the climactic battle.  Directors David
Winning and Shuki Levy are working with some pretty limp material, but
they make the most of it.  They also correct the fatal flaw of the first
POWER RANGERS feature by dumping the computer-generated Zords and making
the final Megazord-vs.-megademon battle what it always should be:  a
battle of two guys in big rubber suits.  TURBO is unquestionably more fun
for kids than for adults, but it is put together with some care, and it's
a step in the right direction.  Who knows...some day the ever-evolving
Rangers might morph into a movie franchise worth watching.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 turbo props:  5.</PRE>
