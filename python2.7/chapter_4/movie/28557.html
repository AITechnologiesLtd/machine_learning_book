<P>   If you've ever been to summer camp you'll see that "Wet Hot
American Summer" is not so much a hilarious parody of the
annual rites of July and August as much as an actual
demonstration of the goings-on in that peculiar institution.  Summer
is a time for romance, for cutting loose, and what better place to
find a season of love and time to go zany than up in the
mountains?  Filmed at Camp Towanda, Donald Wheeler's Camp
and Honesdale in Pennsylvania,  Michael Showalter and David Wain's 
story directed by Mr. Wain takes place in 1981 at Camp Firewood in 
Waterville, Maine, where on the last day of the eight-week season all the
pent up
sexual energy and youthful enegy go into making up for a whole
season of just goofing off by putting on a talent show and by
taking part in a compressed series of the usual camp activities,
which include a nature walk, making out, a science
demonstration, making out, a talent show and making out.  </P>
<P>   Wain and Showalter's parody of an American institution that
hardly needs to be parodied is not the first attempt by filmmakers
to send up a long-standing American institution, one sponsored
primarily by well-off parents who need a break from their kids and
young adults who get paid for having fun.  Ivan Reitman's 1979
Canadian-made feature, "Meatballs," which starred Bill Murray,
described the camp season as alternately cruel and sloppily
sentimental while Ken Wiederhorn's sequel following five years
later with Richard Mulligan spoofed not only Jewish aliens but the
classic film "From Here to Eternity."  Just when you think the
genre would come to a rest after "Meatballs III" in 1987 (George
Mendeluk directing Sally Kellerman and Patrick Dempsey
sending up a dead porno star who coached a teen on losing his
virginity), along comes "Wet Hot," more a series of Saturday-
Night-Live sketches except that it's been conceived by two
members of MTV's sketch-comedy group the State.</P>
<P>   With absurdist comedy that turns reality on its head, Showalter
and Wain present a batch of sex-crazed counselors and wide-
eyed charges who eschew packing up to go home in favor of
doing what comes naturally.  Presided over by Beth (Janeane
Garofalo is her typically deadpan and often hilarious manner), we
look in on Associate Professor of Astrophysics Henry Neuman
("Frazier"'s David Hyde Pierce), hanging out in camp for just that
day, destined to have Beth take his mind out of the clouds. 
While Henry acts frantically to save the camp rec hall from
demise by a falling slab from Skylab, counselors in heat make 
moves on one another vaguely aware that once
they back to "the city," the romances would be just a memory. 
Molly Shannon as Gail bursts into tears at the demise of her
marriage only to be comforted by the nine-year-old hands of
Aaron (Gideon Jacobs) while the camp chef, Gene (Christopher
Meloni), recounts his glorious days in Vietnam in front of a
despairing captive audience, assistant cook Gary (A.D. Miles). 
The nerdy Coop (writer Michael Showalter) makes the move on
the terminally sexy Katie (Marguerite Moreau) who's lookin' good
in tight shorts, but he faces strong competition from the idiotic
lifeguard Andy (Paul Rudd).  </P>
<P>   As expected from this group, the action moves with MTV
rapidity, shifting from skit to skit, some missing of course, some
hitting with laugh-out-loud hilarity.  Just listening to Beth call out
the names of the predominantly Jewish campers (one guy is
David Ben-Gurion) is a cause for celebration in a movie that (like
any other) is not for everyone but is a winner for kids like me--in
my case a guy who can look back with genuine nostalgia to 
nine years in Camp Kee-Wah, Wingdale, New York, days that I
realize only now were the best of my life.</P>
