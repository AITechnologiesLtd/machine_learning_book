PALMETTO</PRE>
<P>Grade: B- (Nothing spectacular, but worth a look on a rainy day)</P>

Rating: R</PRE>
<P>    After the embarrassingly inept obscenity charge leveled against his 
1979 masterpiece The Tin Drum last year in Oklahoma City, Director 
Volker Schlondorff understandably has some mixed feelings about all 
things Americana, and this at times hilariously smutty flick, in which 
an entire town is seemingly populated by nothing but opportunistic 
sex-crazed weasels, lets him exploit that to the max. (Virtually every 
character in this film has an aura of 30-weight Valvoline). Woody 
Harrelson headlines as a none-too-bright journalist just released from 
prison who gets immediately drawn into an ill-fated kidnapping scheme. 
It's a plot that's been done countless times before, but 
Schlondorff's sardonic affection for the cliches and a game cast 
(particularly Chloe Sevigny who, as the Lolitaish center of the plot, 
more than fulfills the promise she showed in Kids and Trees Lounge) 
makes it all seem relatively fresh. The true ace in the hole here proves 
to be Something Wild scripter E. Max Fry, whose screenplay contains 
enough unpredictably weird elements to keep even the most jaded noirist 
interested.
    Palmetto is nowhere near great - it's a little too hamstrung by 
the iron-clad conventions of the genre that it's riffing on - but 
it's not half-bad, either. I have a feeling Jim Thompson would 
grudgingly approve.</P>
