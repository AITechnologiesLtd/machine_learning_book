<P>American classic deals with the effects of urbanization, loneliness,
and the lost American Dream. Scorsese's gritty urban drama was brought
even greater attention when real-life psychopath John F. Hinckley Jr.
attempted to assassinate President Reagan in 1981. He claimed that he
was committing the act in order "to impress Jodie Foster". </P>
<P>PLOT:
Taxi driver Travis Bickle drives along the scummiest streets in the
world, New York City. He doesn't know "much about much", but he does
know that he does not like the continuing propagation of the pimps,
hookers, junkies and low-lifes in his fair city. He also likes a girl.
She doesn't like him back. He is lonely. He likes to drink. He gets
depressed. He gets angry... </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Great urban drama accurately demonstrates the development of a
sociopath within a realistically portrayed city of hell. Travis Bickle
seems like a nice guy, who just couldn't take it anymore. Have any of
you ever felt the same way in your lifetime? Of course. We all have.
And herein lies the continuing popularity of this classic film which
despite some aging concerns, still stands up in time after all these
years.</P>
<P>On the surface, this film will not blow you away in one sitting, but
the symbolism used by Scorsese, the extremely effective acting by
Robert DeNiro, and the superb writing by Paul Schrader, turn this movie
into a cinematic adventure of many layers. The ticking of the cab fare
ticker representing Bickle's growing dissatisfaction with the world
around him (like a bomb), the red and green lights garbing Bickle's
moods, and the plethora of other symbols used to convey anger,
confusion and ultimate frustration.</P>
<P>The soundtrack is perfect (Mrs. JoBlo remarked that it set her into an
icky and depressed state...exactly what was needed to appreciate
Bickle's character), in that it allows you to feel the depravity of his
being. You understand the point that he's reached when he begins to
pour Peach Schnapps into his morning cereal (Bernard Herrmann wasn't
going to write the score for this film, but agreed to do it (his last)
when he saw this pitiful scene.) He is no longer very logical. His
anti-socialism has got the better of him. The direction is top-notch,
with Scorsese showing up in no less than two scenes. And the acting is
superb with DeNiro leading the way, Foster pulling off an effective
"12-and a half year old" hooker, and Keitel, well, being Keitel. The
scene where DeNiro and Keitel haggle for Foster's "services" is one of
my favourites in this movie. </P>
<P>Many classic scenes and lines are now splashed across this film, such
as the infamous "Are you talking to me?" line (completely ad-libbed by
DeNiro, bien sur), the trademark Scorsese slo-mo's, and the green Army
jacket and penchant for pie and coffee (all used in an effective
hommage in 1993's TRUE ROMANCE (9/10) by writer Quentin Tarantino and
director Tony Scott.) I have always watched this film when I was
feeling down and out, and now I know why. As bad as anything gets in my
life, I could always count on Mr. Travis Bickle's life to be so much
more pathetic.</P>
<P>Keep an eye on the last scene of the film after Bickle drops his
passenger off and notices "his inner demons" quickly appear through the
rearview mirror. Some of the monster still remains... </P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Robert DeNiro was married to the attendant at the porno theater in this
film (actress Diahnne Abbott) from 1976 to 1988. He has been quoted as
saying about his own films, ""I don't like to watch my own movies - I
fall asleep in my own movies." He stands 5"9.
Writer Paul Schrader had spent weeks sleeping in his car while writing
this script, when he realized that he hadn't spoken to another human
being in about three weeks (he was depressed and an alcoholic at the
time.)
Jodie Foster was second choice to play Princess Leia in STAR WARS
(8.5/10). 
Various studios considered producing this film...one had even suggested
Neil Diamond for the lead role.
Director Martin Scorsese claims that the most important shot in the
movie is when Bickle is on the phone trying to get another date with
Betsy. The camera moves to the side slowly and pans down the long,
empty hallway next to Bickle, as if to suggest that the phone
conversation is too painful and pathetic to bear.
Jodie Foster's real name is Alicia Christian Foster. She stands 5"4. In
1980 she graduated as the best of her class from the College Lycée
Français and began to study English Literature at Yale University, from
where she graduated magna cum laude in 1985. She was nominated for Best
Supporting Actress at the 1977 Oscars for her role as Iris the
prostitute in this film (the award went to Beatrice Straight from
NETWORK (7/10).)
Before becoming director, Martin Scorsese had thought about entering
the priesthood. He has been married four times, including actress
Isabella Rossellini, and his sometime producer Barbara De Fina.</P>
