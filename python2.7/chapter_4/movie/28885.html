<P>The computer-animated comedy "Shrek" is designed to be enjoyed on
different levels by different groups. For children, it offers
imaginative visuals, appealing new characters mixed with a host of
familiar faces, loads of action and a barrage of big laughs (including
numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances, apparently
a requisite in contemporary family films). For adults, it's a fractured
fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the
kids. All in all, "Shrek" is a snappy ride, although there are a couple
of points I found disturbing.</P>
<P>But first the basics. Based very loosely on a 1990 children's story,
"Shrek" follows several momentous days in the life of the title
character, a rotund green ogre voiced by Mike Myers in that pleasant
Scottish accent he is so fond of using. Shrek is a grumpy fellow living
a solitary life deep in the swamp, until a local nobleman disturbs his
peace.</P>
<P>Petty tyrant Lord Farquaad (take away the "awk" in the middle and you
have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners) owns the land on
which Shrek resides. He proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an Ellis
Island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings
from his castle. As a result, Shrek finds himself surrounded by legends
like the Three Blind Mice, Pinocchio, the Big Bad Wolf, the Seven
Dwarfs, and the Three Bears, to name but a few.</P>
<P>An enraged Shrek storms to the castle, only to find Farquaad (John
Lithgow) ready to bargain. Lord Obnoxious wants to become king and the
magic mirror from "Snow White" has shown him the way. All he has to do
is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife. The mirror unveils
three choices in a presentation straight out of "The Dating Game" (when
Snow White is shown, the cheeky announcer purrs, "Even though she lives
with seven men, she's not easy!")</P>
<P>Farquaad selects the lovely Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and offers
Shrek a deal: If the ogre snatches Fiona from the dragon-protected, lava
moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the
throne, the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his
grounds. Shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest, accompanied
by a motor-mouthed donkey (Eddie Murphy) determined to make the green
grump his best friend. They finally hook up with the princess, only to
learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet. For the
matter, the dragon offers a few surprises as well.</P>
<P>The movie references a great many other flicks, from "Babe" ("That'll
do, donkey. That'll do") to "The Graduate." But the lion's share of the
jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of Disney. The
public-domain characters made into icons in various Disney films take
their hits – Pinocchio is referred to as a "possessed toy" and when
Shrek spies a sleeping Snow White in his cabin, he bellows, "Get that
dead broad off the table!" – but the biggest slams come when Shrek
visits Farquaad's royal domicile, which closely resembles a certain
magic kingdom, from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of
animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy
tune that sounds a lot like "It's a Small World."</P>
<P>Which brings me to disturbing point number one. I laughed at all the
Disney swipes, but found the mentality behind them a bit sad. The
acrimony between Dreamworks honcho Jeff Katzenberg and Disney big wheel
Michael Eisner is well known. For years the two companies have tried to
sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar
competing productions on the same day. And now we have Katzenberg using
an entire movie to attack his former employer. Here's a suggestion for
the two boys: Grow up! Put the past behind you! There's room in the
sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice, then go to
your rooms!</P>
<P>The other area I found troubling came in the portrayal of Lord Farquaad.
Beyond all the irreverence, "Shrek" actually has a message: People
should learn to look beyond physical appearances, because true beauty
lies within. It's a lovely notion, but the film betrays its own moral by
incessantly taking cheap shots at Farquaad's diminutive stature. Do we
really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people
is acceptable? The pompous, selfish behavior of Farquaad is enough to
make him a target for zingers. Adding short jokes is simply mean.</P>
<P>Still, "Shrek" is a rollicking good time. The computer animation is
mostly impressive (although several key characters look like animated
rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky), the voice
work is strong (particularly from Eddie Murphy), the laughs come fast
and furious, and the moral, tainted though it may be, is a good one. To
trot out a cliché, "Shrek" is fun for all ages. Parents, though, should
remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others
because they are short, tall, skinny, fat, etc. is a bad thing.</P>
