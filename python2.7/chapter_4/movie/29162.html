<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A gritty, realistic look at life in the black ghetto. It was shot by 19-year-old
Matty Rich, who never went to film school. He financed the film on his own, and
took about 2 years, starting at age 17, in filming it in his neighborhood. He
brings with him his heartfelt experiences growing up in the Red Hook housing
projects of Brooklyn, as the intense film is an honest effort to look into the
psyches of those living there. The film is flawed by the obviousness of the
situation it shows, yet despite these flaws there is a power in seeing how real
these people are. There was no new ground broken, but it did hit a nerve as to
what life in a housing project looks like. </P>
<P>There's not much of a story, as it follows for a few days the adventures of a
high school kid, Dennis Brown (Gilliard Jr.), who lives in the project with his
teenage sister Carolyn (Sanon) and his working mother Frankie (Sanders) and gas
station attendant father Ray (Odom). </P>
<P>The film has a powerful opening, which sets the stage for its tragic tale.
Dennis and Carolyn share the same sleeping room and are awakened by their
drunken father beating his wife for no reason, and who in his anger breaks many
household objects by throwing them around the room. The father goes on a drunken
rant of how the white man ruined him. He confronts the cowering Dennis by
telling him, "Do you know what it is to be black?" </P>
<P>Dennis' dream is to get out of the ghetto anyway he could, and to do that he
feels pressured to get some fast money. He talks with his two friends, who
aimlessly loaf around the projects, Kevin (Malone) and Larry Love (Rich-the
director), and suggests they pull a robbery of a local drug lord by getting a
gun and a car. Larry suggests they get jobs in his uncle's gas station, which is
sneered at by the angry Dennis. </P>
<P>Shirley (Drummond) is Dennis's sweet girlfriend, who works as a waitress and
suggests that Dennis should use his smarts to go to college. But he says that he
doesn't have four or five years to spend in college. Looking out to the
Manhattan skyline, he tells her those rich corporation people got there by
breaking the rules. She tells him that she won't have anything to do with him if
he goes about getting his dream the wrong way. </P>
<P>Dennis feels trapped by his circumstances and can't respond in the right way to
solve his problem. His mother accepts the beatings as part of life, as the women
all appear to be martyrs and saints. The men are confused and filled with anger
and violence, wanting the American Dream but distorting it by saying it can only
be gotten by illegal means. There seemed to be little choice for the troubled
teens, as they are stymied by living in poverty and in dysfunctional homes. They
narrow the choices down to either being criminals and possibly getting rich, or
of being stuck in the ghetto the rest of their lives as working stiffs. </P>
<P>The film works because it had an honest energy to it, though when it tries to
say something 
meaningful it feels like so much jive. The triteness and predictability of the
story prevents the film from traveling too far from the reality of the housing
projects the filmmaker knows. The film can't penetrate any further than some
surface responses. It's a cautionary inner-city film that should well serve the
youthful urban audience that will be most attracted to its story and should
relate to them better than it would to a wide audience. </P>
