<P>BEST DRAGON ON SCREEN SINCE PUFF THE MAGIC DRAGON</h3></P>
<P>Post-Arthurian England: dragons and men share the land as the only
sentient beings around. One thing though, dragons were much smarter,
mystical and their lifespan allows them to outlive generations of human
civilisation. Not since the Disney outing way back in the early 80's,
DRAGONSLAYER, has any studio dared to venture into similar territory.
Now, with the advent of technology that can achieve near perfect
integration of computer graphics with reality, DRAGONHEART was
conceived. With Lucasfilms ILM, creating the special effects for the
film, there is no doubt that audiences will be duly impressed with their
work. While the effects do bite.....the film on whole doesn't.</P>
<P>Bowen (Quaid), a knight which follows the teachings of the Old Code, has
the duty to train the King's son, Einon (Thewlis). Knowing his father's
tyrannical and brutal rule, Bowen is determined to train Einon by the
teachings which he believed in, to ensure that when Einon takes the
throne, he will be a much better ruler than his father. When Einon sees
his father being outnumbered in one of his attacks on the village, he
runs to his aid, only to see him killed by the angered villagers. In a
freak accident, he was stabbed in the heart. Bowen, his caring mentor,
rushes him back to the castle. When all hope of saving Einon was lost,
the Queen (Julie Christie) begs for the help of a dragon, believing in
their magical powers of healing. The Dragon however, made Einon take an
oath that he will be a better ruler and will always abide to the Old
Code and saved
his life.</P>
<P>However, the oath was not to be. Einon went on to become an even more
ruthless ruler than his father. Disappointed in himself, Bowen believes
that the dragon's magic had destroyed all the good within Einon and vows
to destroy it. He becomes a dragonslayer, killing dragons in return for
gold, totally living against the teachings he was brought up to believe
in. All that changed when he meets up with Draco (voice of Connery), the
last surviving dragon in the land. Realising that he cannot make more
gold by killing the last dragon, he befriends it and together,  they
form an acting duo, cheating villages of their gold. </P>
<P>In an odd twist of fate, they stumble upon Kara (Meyer) who is
determined to avenge her father's brutal murder and free the land of
Einon's tyrannical rule. And the rest, well....the rest is a fairy tale.</P>
<P>The computer-animated dragon, needless to say, is spectacular and very
lifelike, coming from the same creative team behind CASPER and TWISTER. 
Connery's voice accentuated its strength and wisdom. Draco is the star
of this  film. However, the high ratio of investment on Draco takes its
toll on the rest of the film. The action sequences without Draco seemed
bland and unspectacular,  such as the many clashes featured in this
film. Perhaps the filmmakers wanted the film to appeal to as wide an
audience as possible, but whatever they did,  they tried too hard. </P>
<P>On a positive note, this film is safe for children: though many deaths
are featured, gore and blood stains were kept to a minimum, which may
prove a general letdown to action thirsty audiences today.</P>
<P>Still, every fairy tale has a good message to it and DRAGONHEART does
not disappoint in this department. Kids should love it, adults should be
delighted with Draco's antics. Just don't expect a fairy-tale version of
BRAVEHEART and you'll do  just fine. Great fans of SFX may want to check
this one out.</P>
