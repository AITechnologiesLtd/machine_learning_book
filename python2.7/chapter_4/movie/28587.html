<PRE>KISS OF THE DRAGON
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Wham, bam, thank you ma'am!  Jet Li has finally returned to prime
ass-kicking form in his latest kung fu extravaganza Kiss of the Dragon.</P>
<P>Jet Li - one of the most popular stars in Asia rivaling Jackie Chan and
Chow Yun-Fat - has had an impressive string of over 25 films under his
belt in his two decades of kung fu prowess and strong acting turns.  But
after two dismal attempts at winning over American audiences with a
small villain role in Lethal Weapon 4 and the horrendous Joel Silver
monstrosity Romeo Must Die, it was looking pretty grim for this mighty
warrior.  So, Li read the e-mails from his fans, taking their
compliments and complaints via his web site.</P>
<P>This undertaking prompted Li to construct a film that would capture the
powerful imagery of his earlier masterpieces -- The Bodyguard from
Beijing, High Risk, Fist of Legend, and Once Upon a Time in China I and
II.  Li wanted to move away from the wire work and computer graphics of
such recent films as The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,
which seemed to remove the authenticity of the art form.  He instead
wanted to provide American audiences with an authentic glimpse of a
martial artist at work, just like the master Bruce Lee.</P>
<P>To help construct a compelling story, Li brought in action maestro Luc
Besson to help write the screenplay from Li's original story as well as
aid in the production of the film.  This combination provides more hits
than misses, culminating in the most successful, straight-action genre
film I've seen in a very long time.</P>
<P>Kiss of the Dragon begins with the story of Asian supercop Johnny (Jet
Li) who joins forces with nefarious, megalomaniac French cop Richard
(Tchéky Karyo) to capture an Asian drug lord hiding out in Paris.  When
the drug lord get killed in bloody fashion by the Frenchy and his small
army of bad-ass mofos, Johnny gets framed for the murder and ends up on
the run.  Along the way, he gets in fights with about a million bad guys
while Richard and his small army shoot up the bystanders.  Johnny then
joins forces with one of Richard's hookers named Jessica (Bridget
Fonda), rescuing Jessica's baby girl from the clutches of Richard and
retrieving the evidence that will clear Johnny's name. </P>
<P>Hong Kong cinema has never been known strongly for its original story
lines but rather for its character development.  Indeed, Li is
impressive in his quiet but powerful role, proving himself an authentic
action star that actually sheds blood and shows more signs of exhaustion
in the face of adversity.</P>
<P>The main flaws of the film are found in Besson's script, whose
fingerprints muddy every scene, from incredible action sequences to the
weak female characters.  Besson has never been able to create a solid,
multi-layered woman's role in any of his films.  Even La Femme Nikita
showed his inability in developing a compelling female character who
wasn't in desperate trouble, down on her luck, and needing a strong man
to help her get back on top.  Bridget Fonda's hooker role who needs
Johnny to help rescue her daughter is a classic example of the
virgin/whore complex that obsesses Besson.  Fonda's melodramatic moments
are at times laughable and distracting.</P>
<P>Additionally, Besson draws the character of Richard as a shadow of Gary
Oldman's corrupt cop character from Léon.  The only saving grace is
Karyo's ability to turn a very shallow villain into a multi-layered
monster.  Li's role also feels like an Asian version of Léon himself,
and Besson stages many of the action sequences by echoing his earlier
works.</P>
<P>The ho-hum story aside, the action sequences are amazing.  Director
Chris Nahon (best known for French commercials) handles the action as
deft as any Peckinpah or McTiernan production, capturing Li in stunning
motion.  The violence meter is extremely high and even Li recommends
children not see the film on his web site.  I even found myself
cringing, and I'm a whore for violence.</P>
