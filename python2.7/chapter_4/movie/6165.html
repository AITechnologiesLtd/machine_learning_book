<P>Coincidences again, or better call them connections. The current  "The
First Wives Club" is about four older women,  once best college pals,
now abandoned by their husbands for chicks. One woman commits suicide.
The surviving three are reunited and unite against their spouses.</P>
<P>In "Girls Town" four young women, two black (Nikki and Angela),  two
white ( Patti and Emma), have their own clique. When they are close to
graduating from high school, Nikki, the academically smartest of the lot
and a future Princetonian,  unexpectedly and inexplicably commits
suicide. After swiping Nikki's diary, the surviving three conclude that
she had killed herself because she had been date-raped by a co-worker
outside the school. His name, Richard Helms, sounds like a dig at
politics.  </P>
<P>The diary helping, discussions among the trio reveal to them how little
they had really known their best friend Nikki, induce self-analyses.
bring to light that Emma had also been the victim of a date rape.</P>
<P>The most forceful member of the three, and the oldest one, is Patti,
played with unbound energy by Lili Taylor, the star of  "I Shot Andy
Warhol." She is a single mother. Her ex-boyfriend Eddie is an abusive
brute. She dresses so horribly in bulky overalls that it makes your eyes
hurt--not that her friends are fashion models either. Nor is any of the
three a looker, which fact reinforces some anti-Hollywood aspects of the
movie. (The overalls may be a sign of defiance or seeking and affirming
one's identity, like the graffiti of names in the school bathroom). </P>
<P>The trio more or less affirm their feminism in long talks, unstructured
and coming to a large degree from sessions of improvisations between the
film's director-co-writer, members of the cast, and others. The ladies
avenge themselves by trashing the car of Emma's rapist, attacking (not
too violently) on the street Nikki's rapist,vandalizing Eddie's place
and pawning his TV set. </P>
<P>While "The First Wives Club" is a costly Hollywood Establishment
production and "Girls Town" an independent, micro-budget film, and while
one is set in ritzy Manhattan and the other in a pronouncedly grungy,
working-class neighborhood somewhere in New York, both aim at a female
audience, respectively mature and young. And while "Girls," which is by
far the better of the two movies --early this year it won the Sundance
film festival's filmakers trophy and special jury prize-- it is not
without raising some questions.</P>
<P>Both "Wives" and "Girls" have weighty subjects, which the first film
chooses to treat as entertainment for the audiences, unlike the  second
which is eager, serious and heavy on naturalism, "Girls" tries to
involve the audience by having it peep and eavesdrop into the concerns
of its young women. As this is done mostly through talk, the process
exacts the price of inducing some fatigue in the public. No matter how
true to life and to the speakers, the improvised, diffuse babbling is of
uneven interest to the viewers-listeners. It can hit arid passages, lead
to rambling rather than to crystallizing specific points. (The
first-time director is a lover of documentary cinema and has a
background of music videos).</P>
<P>Art has to go beyond literal reproduction. It must select, prune and
structure, ideally in ways that seem to be natural. The organization of
"Girls" lacks tightness and simply does not go far enough.  </P>
<P>Then there's the Political Correctness factor that balances
symmetrically the black and the white girls and shows a remarkably
endearing, entirely natural non-consciousness of race. This goes beyond
the original quartet. When there are only three women left, another
black schoolmate eventually becomes a marginal confidante. There is an
additional black-and-white pair of best friends around, with whom the
threesome fights. </P>
<P>"Girls" goes way beyond plain old racial harmony and tolerance. 
Blackness or whiteness matter to the friends as much as the Man in the
Moon, which means not a whit. Think about it: this wonderful
indifference is taken light-years farther than in any other movie I can
think of. It is, for me, the core of the picture, the high point I will
remember above all others.  Is this genuine?  An artifice? Wishful
thinking? I cannot tell, but no matter. This is what gives the film its
warmth and its positive thinking.</P>
<P>Hard to judge is Nikki's suicide because we have not enough clues. Was
it her rape that caused it? Was the rape the last straw in some problems
unknown to us?  Unexplained too is the original relationship between
Patti and Eddie, The lack of antecedents makes it confusing. Was Patti a
patsy who, peculiarly, used to put up with Eddie's brutality? Did she
become an activist-leader almost overnight, with her pent up feelings
and thoughts catalyzed by Nikki's death and the reinforcement of the
group? </P>
<P>The film knows its three Rs, race, rape and rap.  Its soundtrack adds
much female singing of rap. As Jean-Luc Godard might put it in one of
his playful but not necessarily meaningful wordplays, remove the "e" and
rape becomes rap. </P>
<P>In the movie's mix of weaknesses and virtues add to the latter that 
"Girls" qualifies for inclusion in the lists of BBNMM, the Bring Back
the Ninety Minute Movie Society.</P>
