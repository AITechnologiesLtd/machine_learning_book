<P>One-Line-Summary
----------------
     A coach fights corruption within himself and the system as he
tries to assemble a winning basketball team.</P>
<P>Tak Plot Summary
----------------
     Coach Pete Bell (NICK NOLTE) is facing his first losing season and
doesn't like it, but can't compete for the best high school talent (the
Blue Chips) unless he breaks the rules and offers "enticements."
Ex-wife Jenny (MARY McDONNELL) knows Pete plays by the rules, but
wealthy alumni Happy (J.T. Walsh) is more than eager to tempt him, with
reporter Ed (ED O'NEILL) waiting if Pete should slip.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts 
------------
     This sports movie focuses on one coach's love for the game of
basketball.  He is passionate about the game and would do almost
anything to have the best team. He can't stand the corruption almost
inherent in the game--"You've taken the one thing really pure in your
life ... and you've corrupted it."  But he can't have the best team
without that corruption, which provides the focus for the movie.</P>
<P>     There are lots and lots of real basketball stars and legends in
BLUE CHIPS.  You can't watch 5 minutes without tripping over a
real-life basketball player, coach, or sports caster.  Oddly enough, it
works, and you don't have to be a huge basketball fan. (I'm not)</P>
<P>     The basketball action is exciting and energetic, both players and
crowd were real and it shows.  Since all the games were played with
real players, the film makers had no problem filling the bleachers--the
action was filmed in four standing-room-only games in Indiana.  Nick
Nolte: "We had ten cameras working but nobody was aware of where the
cameras were and the filming never interfered with the game. It wasn't
like filming at all."</P>
<P>     The few basketball figures who can't seem to act well come off a
bit flat, but none of them have more than cameo appearances, with the
possible exception of legend Bob Cousy, who my friend commented on
with--"You can tell which ones are basketball people--they can't act."
While this may be true for Bob Cousy (arguably) and Shaquille O'Neal,
Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway did a great job as Butch, the clean-cut
talent from Chicago.</P>
<P>     It would seem Nick Nolte's been really busy--I'LL DO ANYTHING and
BLUE CHIPS both released within a week of each other.  It's a testimony
to his acting ability that he performs excellently in both movies, with
a completely different character in each.  As coach Bell, Nolte is the
complete coach: hot-headed, intelligent, and dedicated to the game he
loves.  He looks more like a coach than the real coaches in the
film--Bobby Knight, Rick Pitino, and George Raveling.</P>
<P>     Mary McDonnell put in a strong supporting performance as Jenny.
You'll also see Ed O'Neill, who always surprises me with his acting
ability--initially it's so hard to see past his Al Bundy ("Married with
Children") character.  Louis Gossett, Jr., a college scholarship player
himself, appears as a high school coach.</P>
<P>     Despite the subtitles at the end ("Blah went on to play in the
NBA") this is *not* a true story.  The screenplay was first written
twelve years ago and was intended to deal with themes of corruption,
morality and ambition.  The events depicted are extremely realistic and
more timely than ever--a bunch of last year's University of Washington
Husky football squad got in trouble for just such antics.</P>
<P>Tak Rating system:
------------------
     I was surprised by this movie.  I thought it would be a showcase
movie for the numerous NBA characters.  Instead, we get an inspiring
story about a man who loves basketball and how that love affects every
aspect of his life. It's always a treat to watch people who love what
they're doing, and BLUE CHIPS provides us that opportunity.  Check it
out one evening, I think you'll like it.</P>
<PRE>    avoid at all costs
    watch it on cable
    wait for videotape
    see once as a matinee 
    see several times (w/friends) as matinee
 X  see once at full price
    see it several times - full and/or matinee
    see many times at full price</PRE>
