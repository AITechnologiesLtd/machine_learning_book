<P>   If the doctrinaire ayatollahs of the film industry in Iran ever
get up the guts to allow their people to see movies that are
not about children, "American Psycho" would fit their
propaganda plans perfectly.  What have the high priests of
the Iranian government been saying over and over about the
Great Satan?  "America is so consumed by materialism that
its people have lost all spiritual values."  This is not an
exceptionally new idea, nor one restricted only to regimes of
extremist political energy.  A case could indeed by made that
almost any rich country is going to list shopping and
consuming among its eminent pleasures, Sunday church-
going aside.  But in the hands of Mary Harron, who directs
and co-scripted "American Psycho" based on one of the most
controversial novels of the early nineties by Bret Easton Ellis,
the theme gets a razor-sharp representation, its title
character compensating for his inability to feel and his
incapacity to express a personal identity by an uncontrollable
urge to kill.</P>
<P>   Harron and her co-writer, Guinevere Turner, have taken 
pivotal scenes from the book, furnishing a swift pace to the
story of the psychotic Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale).  They
capture novelist Ellis's response to the spirit of the 1980s in
America, but particularly in the world's finance capital of New
York, where thousands of people in their twenties and thirties
made millions not by erecting buildings and bridges or
inventing better mousetraps but simply by shuffling paper in
the midtown offices of Manhattan's skyscrapers.  Lest any in
the audience think of the film as merely a period piece about
a bygone era, think of today's wild stock market, with prices
of stock--particularly of Internet companies that haven't
turned a profit--soaring to surreal price-earnings ratios.  </P>
<P>   Director Harron lays out a coterie of nattily clad young
men, vice presidents all in the Wall Street mergers and
acquisitions department of a leading brokerage house.  As we
watch these vapid individuals get together several times a
week at pricey restaurants for arugula salads, chateaubriands
and Scotch, we wonder how they ever find the time to get
their work done, the labor for which they are grossly
overpaid.  Look closely and you will not find a single moment
of the movie describing what these people actually do, so
busy are they in one-upping each other in tangible goods
from exquisitely designed business cards to elegantly tailored
suits.  The almost unbelievable name dropping in the book is
almost completely dispensed with, however.  Still, Bateman's
opening monologue will give those who have not perused the
Viking book--scheduled for re-release in April--a good idea of
the lengths to which the author goes to impress on the reader
the importance of labels to the yuppies of the Reagan years. 
As Harron's photographer, Andrzej Sekula ("Pulp Fiction")
follows Bateman to his morning shower, we hear the 27-year-
old executive discuss his skin treatment with no one in
particular, gesturing to an array of bottles in the bathroom of
his Upper West Side apartment house that would tap the
envy of the most gorgeous models in the city.  We get an
early hint that Bateman (whose name may have been
inspired by the Bates Motel) is a deranged personality in that-
-despite an array of beautiful women at his disposal--he
watches sadistic porno movies on his TV as he performs his
daily two-hour workout.</P>
<P>   The scenario of these yuppies is so amusing that we're
almost saddened when Harron cuts to Bateman's earliest
victim, a homeless man whom he distracts by seeming to
befriend him only to stab the poor, hungry and cold man
several times in the stomach and chest before stomping his
friendly terrier to death.  The violence of the act is in no way
comparable to the fury of the book's murder scenes.  Take a
look at the way Bateman describes the vicious attack on the
seated, smelly beggar on the printed page...</P>
<P>   "I put out a long, thin knife with a serrated edge and, being
very careful not to kill him, push maybe half an inch of the
blade into his right eye, flicking the handle up, instantly
popping the retina...with my thumb and forefinger hold the
other eye open and bring the knife up and push the tip of it
into the socket, first breaking its protective film so the socket
fills with blood, then slitting the eyeball open sideways, and
he finally starts screaming once I slit his nose in two..."</P>
<P>   Harron is determined, however, to avoid slasher-movie
formula so that at no point do we witness a prolonged display
of any of the man's twenty to forty killings.  Slasher fans,
however, will be reasonably amused by one of the book's
pivotal scenes displayed in somewhat gory detail.  Bateman
picks up a street hooker, Christie (played with almost
priceless facial expressions by Cara Seymour), takes her to
his flashy pad, whereupon he phones an escort service for a
more sophisticated young woman.  (This is the scene that
was later cut to give the movie an R rating.  Bateman, in the
midst of a sexual orgy, observes the action in his mirror as
he flexes his muscles...we see the menage-a-troi in the
mirror's reflection, which photographer Sekula films in blue as
though Bateman were watching not himself with the
prostitutes, but a disembodied porno video.)  After arranging
a second date with a reluctant Christie who, at this time joins
a rich debutante (co-writer Guinevere Turner), Bateman
dispatches the deb and then runs naked through the hallway
chasing the panic-stricken Christie with a chain saw.</P>
<P>   Much of the dark comedy throughout the movie comes
from Bateman's observations which he expresses aloud to
whoever is in the room with him--or to us in the audience if
no one is present.  An almost hilarious monologue has
Bateman discussing the works of Whitney Houston as though
he were a true connoissuer in a scene that Ellis and Harron
might just have intended to be a riff on critics in general.</P>
<P>   The one concept difficult to sort out is this...Bateman is
shown as a Frankenstein monster, a man who cannot control
his homicidal instincts, presumably because he was
genetically deformed from birth.  Yet we are tempted to make
the stretch and try to interpret his endeavors as a reaction
against the soul-stifling conformity of his business and social
circle.  His inability to feel, which is not a truly rare
psychological state, does not come from his being part of a
greedy, 1980s society.  Greed and hostility are the only
emotions he can feel, but this aberration would exist in him
regardless of the spirit of the times.  </P>
<P>   Nonetheless, "American Psycho" is not a picture you'd
want to miss.  The scenarios are as cut to the bone as the
victims of Bateman's chain saw, nicely edited by Andrew
Marcus with thrills and humor alike pumped up by Barry
Cole's original score.  Christian Bale--who is said to have
worked out just like his character for months before the shoot
began and who has obviously had an effective speech trainer
to give him an authentic preppy accent--is unbeatable in this
role. The handsome Welsh performer apparently was chosen
after Leonardo Di Caprio turned down the role (a fortunate
decision for the movie).  Jared Leto as Bateman's victimized
friend Paul Allen gives new meaning to being axed from the
cast, while Chloe Sevigny is absolutely charming as an alpha-
male, idol-worshipping secretary who is thrilled to the core
when invited on a date with her loco boss.  Other performers
include Reese Witherspoon in a silly, undeveloped role as
Bateman's fiance and Willem Dafoe as a private investigator
looking into the disappearance of Bateman's hatcheted friend.</P>
<P>   Filmed in New York and Toronto, the movie has an
impressively expensive look courtesy of Gideon Ponte's
production design.  The sparkling scenes of Manhattan by
night should be welcomed by the New York Tourist
Commission, providing a gleaming backdrop for what is
justifiably the most talked-about movie of early 2000.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 97 minutes.  (C) 2000
