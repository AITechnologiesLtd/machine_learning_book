<PRE>"Joe Dirt"</PRE>
<P>In 1985, little Joe Dirt (Eric Per Sullivan) was abandoned by his white,
trailer-trash parents at a Grand Canyon tourist stop. He has had to fend
for himself ever since and, even though he has lived a life of hard knocks,
he has not forgotten his mom and dad. Now, 15 years later, Joe (David
Spade) decides it is time to find his roots and begins his quest in "Joe
Dirt."</P>
<P>David Spade, since the death of Chris Farley, has not been able to break
out on his own in feature films - see "Lost & Found" for bad starring
choices. Usually, he plays the caustic, wise-cracking smartass - a routine
that gets tired outside of his Dennis Finch character on TV's "Just Shoot
Me." In "Joe Dirt" there is a kinder and gentler Spade in the role of Joe,
a not-too-bright but genuinely nice guy. Unfortunately, the movie isn't too
good.</P>
<P>Joe Dirt is a pathetic little guy who sports a 70's style shag hairdo
because, when he was a baby, his skull did not close correctly, so his mom
put a wig on him. When his head finally closed up, she forgot to remove the
wig and he has been burdened with the out-of-date hairpiece ever since.
But, he has an intense joie de vie that keeps him going even when he gets
covered in pooh-pooh or picked on by school kids. Joe firmly believes that
if you are a good person, you will get what you want from life.</P>
<P>Joe begins a cross-country, crisscrossing journey to dig up clues and track
down the parents that dubbed him "Dirt." This consists of a series of
disjointed, short incidents involving various wacky characters. Some help
him, some hinder him and you get the whole story via a radio talk show
hosted by the sarcastic Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller). Joe is brought onto
the show by the bored emcee to discuss what a loser he is and Joe tells his
story. As the tale of his search unfolds it is so compelling Joe instantly
gets a huge listener following.</P>
<P>The script by Spade and Fred Wolf is a mishmash of goofy slapstick scenes,
emotional moments, an oddball love story (Joe gets the beautiful girl,
Brandy (Brittany Daniel)) and a whole bunch of positive messages to the
audience. Joe's life, as we see it, is a string of mishaps ranging from
falling out of a balloon shaped like a molar to sleeping in a house being
fumigated. There are laughs along the way, but most are forced and none too
funny.</P>
<P>This Adam Sandler produced effort attracts a whole bunch of comedy figures
to it, mostly in small, fleeting performances. Christopher Walken plays
Clem, a school janitor in a witness protection program, who helps Joe,
dignifies the film with his presence. The rest - Rosanna Arquette as an
alligator rancher who hates gators; Joe Don Baker as an abusive, drunken
parent to Joe's girlfriend (funny, huh?); Fred Ward as Joe's greedy, stupid
father; Carson Daly as Carson Daly; and others - walk in and out of their
scenes without note.</P>
<P>At the end of the screening for "Joe Dirt" I chatted with one of the
patrons and asked what he thought of the movie. His response was, "If you
want a no-brainer, it's just what the doctor ordered." Now, I see enough
no-thinking-required movies as it is without wanting/needing to see yet
another one, but I know what the guy means. I, personally, prefer to be
challenged to think about a movie, but, if you want to leave your brain at
home, maybe "Joe Dirt" is the prescription you need. I give it a C-.</P>
