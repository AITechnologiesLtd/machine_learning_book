<PRE>                               BOTTLE ROCKET
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The moment you know that Dignan's really lost it is during the trio's
getaway from a not-so-daring bookstore robbery, when he excitedly states,
"We're heading back to Bob's, we're gonna split up the loot, and go on the
lam!"</P>
<P>     In this hilarious first feature from director Wes Anderson and
screenwriter Owen Wilson, a trio of young men with questionable work
ethics try in vain to become hardened criminals.  Anthony (Owen's brother
Andrew Wilson) has just "escaped" from a voluntary mental hospital with
the help of old pal Dignan (Owen), a neo-manic-depressive who's mapped out
his life with felt-tip pen in a 75-year plan.  Bob (Bob Musgrave) is the
group's timid getaway driver whose main qualification is that he owns a
car.</P>
<P>     After a practice robbery on Anthony's Dallas house, the plans for the
first big score, a strip center bookstore, are put into action.  With
literally *hundreds* of dollars, the men then find their way to a
middle-of-nowhere motel, planning to return for the job that will launch
them to the Big Time:  robbing a cold storage center.</P>
<P>     Filmed by Texans in Texas, BOTTLE ROCKET is a surprisingly funny look
at childish obsessions and "growing up" as a twentysomething.  Wilson's
dialogue is maddeningly comical and oddly realistic--we've all had a
friend like Dignan who doesn't quite have all his screws in.  The
performances by the principal actors are dead-on, too.  Throw in a
supporting role by James Caan (his best since HONEYMOON IN VEGAS) and a
bizarre final heist, and you've got yourself a pretty good film.</P>
<P>     The only time the movie is derailed is during an ill-thought-out love
sequence with a motel housekeeper (Lumi Cavazos).  It doesn't really seem
to belong in this picture, but at least it's somewhat entertaining.  The
picture's selection of music is a very unconventional one, too, and while
it's somewhat refreshing in its difference, it can also be distracting.</P>
<P>     Details aside, I recommend BOTTLE ROCKET to anyone who enjoyed last
year's THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN.  And while not the unequivocal success the
latter film was, BOTTLE ROCKET is still a phenomenal ride that manages to
be consistently funny, without once resorting to someone being struck in
the groin.</P>
