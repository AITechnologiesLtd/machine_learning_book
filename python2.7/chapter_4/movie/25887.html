<P>Disaster-movies form a genre that is probably the least respected of
all genres. It is simply the dumbest and most primitive of what
Hollywood has to offer, besides 'Godzilla' and 'Lost in Space' (who
are disasters in their own peculiar way). Lately there have been many
additions to this lowest layer of entertainment. The normal procedure
is to leave your brain at the counter and then take your place in
front of the screen. But we don't care. We love watching
disaster-movies: 'Twister', 'Volcano' ext.. We love to not
think. We've seen all kind of natural disasters: volcanoes,
earthquakes, twisters and even giant lizards in New York. But there is
one element missing: storm. This time director Wolfgang Petersen ('Das
Boot'), wants to pay with natural phenomenas, and luckily manages to
breathe some life into this godforsaken genre. The media kit for "The
Perfect Storm" begins with a special request that reads, "Warner
Brothers Pictures would appreciate the press' cooperation in not
revealing the ending of this film to their readers, viewers or
listeners." And so, following this request I will not reveal anything
specific about the premise, which is pretty simple: "In the fall of
1991 six fishermen left Gloucester, Massachusetts. And encountered a
natural disaster that has never before occurred in recorded
history. Nature has created a monster.."</P>
<P>It is not much of a story. And the film is mostly driven by characters
and special effects, who compete for screen time. Petersen manages to
create the right feeling, the mood, the atmosphere. And when that is
accomplished, you don't even need a story. The first we experience is
the fear and anticipation that we share with the wives, children and
parents that anxiously await the return of the fishermen, and the joy
of actually seeing them alive. Already the audience is given a peek
into the lives of these simple men, their trade and their
paradox. While their loved once are happy when they return, they feel
emptiness and longing. As much as they love their family and friends,
the deep blue sea is constantly calling for them in their
dreams. Their passion for the ocean is also their tragedy. It
alienates them from their earthly existence and the only place they
feel alive and at home is at sea. Petersen stimulates this romantic
notion of 'man versus nature' and paints the poetic contrast between
the gray, dark village and the magical blue sea. Sometimes it is
sapphire-blue, sometimes it is full of golden sparkles from bright
sundowns and pink sunrises. Sometimes it shines like liquid silver in
the reflection of the moonlight. The fresh ocean breeze, the sound of
seagulls in the morning and singing whales in the evening. It is like
a different and magical world of true peace and freedom. Captain Billy
Tyne (George Clooney) is heading towards the sunset with the fresh
breeze in his face, and his trusted vessel glides through the pure,
blue water. Now he is at home. And on his face, which has always been
sad and shy, is a smile. Tyne is probably the best developed character
in this story. He has fallen into a slump and takes his vessel out on
a desperate late-season voyage; there's a hint of Hemingway's "Old Man
and the Sea" in his character, with the wounded dignity and human
complexity. Clooney portrays him well, without making him a one
dimensional hero, but rather as a hurt and misunderstood human
being. His mos t quite, good hearted youngster, who is ripped apart
between his devotion to his loving girlfriend and the deep blue
sea. Mark Wahlberg continues to grow in confidence and ability, giving
surprising depth and shading to Bobby. The rest of his fearless crew
consists of Murph (John C. Reilly), a silent veteran who has estranged
himself from his wife and child and hides at sea, with his love and
emotions sealed inside him, Bugsy (John Hawkes) -- a sweet-natured,
but socially inept guy who has nothing to do on earth. He has nobody
that cares for him, nobody that will be glad when he returns. Sully
(William Fichtner), is the sullen adventurer and apparently Murph's
lifelong adversary. And of finally the Jamaican fishermen Alfred
Pierre (Allen Payne), who is almost never shown. He is like a shadow
on the ship, helping silently and fearlessly when the problem comes.</P>
<P>When the storm finally hits, the atmosphere changes. And the magical
blue waves turn into a midst of a monstrous, black fury. There is
something devilish, something unearthly about these gigantic
creations. The scale is enormous and frightening. And from this point
the film transforms from a melancholic drama to a magnificent thrill
ride. Peterson inserts some incredibly inventive shots and scenes. The
camera circles the ship, swims under water and flies through the
stormy clouds. The feeling is indescribable, an amazing adrenaline
rush, but regrettably hardly anything else. Peterson may have created
the perfect storm, but hardly a perfect film. Unfortunately the waves
have as much (if not more) screen time as the actors, who at times
seem like a background, with their character development almost
forgotten. Whether it was intentional, or whether the director was too
preoccupied with the special effects to think about his script, we
will never know. Another important element that was completely out of
place was ironically the music. Ironically because the composer is
James Horner, who created the Oscar-winning score for Titanic and
'Apollo 13'. However in 'The Perfect Storm' the good composer
completely misunderstood the director's intentions. Instead of
portraying the menace and silent horror that slowly crops up, Horner
adds a proud, patriotic fanfare, which seems completely out of place
and beyond any logic. In fact it quite often ruins the poetic
atmosphere that Peterson tries to create. The script may likewise need
some polishing and complexity. What Petersen does best is reflecting
the atmosphere, the terror and despair that these fishermen are
feeling. In this effort he achieves an incredible level of tension,
anxiety, drama and suspense. The fact that we know something about
them, make us care. We know about their families that anxiously await
them to return, about their dreams and hopes for the future. It is a
peek into a fisherman's life. Petersen tries to simultaneously tell
several parallel stories.  A raging waters and shows the situation at
home, where their families and friends sit in fear, terror and
isolation on an island surrounded by a furious blackness. And it is
here that he should stop. Instead of concentrating more on the six
fishermen and their emotional development and evolution, Petersen is
shifting his sets and characters in a terrible speed. He shows the
meteorologists, the other unfortunate sailors, fishermen and tourists
lost at sea and even the heroic rescue personnel that before saving
themselves had to save the others. This disturbing lack of
concentration is really what in the end ruins the film's otherwise
well directed drama. And yet, 'The Perfect Storm' never seems as a bad
effort. It will capture your attention like few movies have in recent
time. And unlike most disaster movies, this film feels like an amazing
adrenaline rush, a feeling that feels like a roller coaster ride. And
for that achievement alone, Petersen deserves praise.</P>
