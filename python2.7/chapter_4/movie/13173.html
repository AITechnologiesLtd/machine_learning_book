<P>Vampires (1998, USA, Largo Entertainment, 103 min.)
director/composer: John Carpenter
script: John Carpenter, Don Jacobi, Dan Mazur
actors: James Woods, Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee, Thomas Ian Griffith,
Mamilian Schell
rating: >= 12 years (in France)
some people should be warned that the movie contains: extreme violence,
some nudity, foul language, a delightful absence of Hollywood-type
morals or political correctness.</P>
<P>At the moment, John Carpenter's latest movie can only be seen in France,
where it did good business (esp. considering it's a horror movie). USA
release is planned for the autumn. For interested tourists: keep in mind
that the French release is dubbed in French. I don't know if the movie
is also screened with subtitles. Luckily, my French was good enough so I
only didn't fully get some subtleties of Jack's Crow swearing... I also
believe that the movie is at the end of its career in France.
For those who haven't heard about it: here follows a very short and
relatively spoiler-free synopsis of the intro: Jack Crow (James Woods)
and his team are full-time, Vatican-endorsed vampire hunters. Team Crow
employs drastic measures, to say the least. They manage to seriously
anger the "original vampire" Valek (an impressive Griffith) and now the
hunters become the hunted...
John Carpenter is back. Remember those delicious shivers you experienced
during his best movies? Remember the impeccable wide-screen
compositions, the trademarked thumping soundtrack? The much-copied
"spring-loaded-cat" shocks? The non-conformist anti-heroes with the
snarling one-liners? This movie delivers it all in spades. Carpenter
needed a hit movie. It was hoped that his previous effort, Escape from
LA, would bring him back to the commercial top, but it wasn't the
expected hit. Perhaps this was only to be expected, how could a public
that adored the extremely populist "Independence Day" appreciate such a
cynical take on America? Before EFLA, there was "Memoirs of an invisible
man" (which I believe is underrated), "In the mouth of madness" (which
had a good story, but was not really scary) and the remake of "Village
of the damned" (somewhat impersonal, but like most of JC's movies, it
seems to get better with each passing year). I believe that all these
movies made some money world-wide, but we have to go back to "They Live"
(1998) for Carpenter's last real commercial success. Commercial success
is not necessarily a synonym for artistic success (just reconsider
Independence yawn), but a hit now and then typically means easier
funding for new projects. This movie might just be it.
You can expect Carpenter doing things differently. A vampire-movie is a
classic, strongly coded style, but Carpenter injects it with new blood,
by filming it as a contemporary western. Many Carpenter movies have some
Western-type situations or characters, but it was never this obvious.
You can notice it in the group of Team Crow (a wild bunch), the dusty
southern landscapes, the music... I believe it is an appealing,
refreshing mix (as far as I know, only Near Dark has more or less the
same atmosphere) and I think the movie will benefit from strong
word-of-mouth. Don't expect a soft horror movie. Vampires is a raw and
brutal movie. The vampires themselves act more like leopards (very
quick, beastly, deadly) than like classic vampires.
Carpenter's style has evolved. I always admired the relatively calm and
pure but elaborate filming style of his earlier work. Alas, it seems
that this very classic filming style is out of fashion. The style of
Vampires is still visibly Carpenter (this is one of the very few
directors who have a recognisable style) but on the whole it's "faster"
than before. The global effect is more like the style of Desperado. More
camera's are used and editing is generally faster than before (certainly
during action scenes), but we're not talking 3-cuts-per-second Michael
Bay style here. Well, the Reborn Carpenter Style works. It is also
interesting to note that an extreme carnage in a motel is edited with
fades. You would expect fast cuts (fades seem like "nicer" transitions)
but it works. In this case I thought it gives a more mythical aura to
the action.
Considering actors: James Woods truly shines. You really believe he's
vampire hunter Jack Crow. He is not a likeable man, but then Snake
Plissken or the killer from Assault (forgot the name) weren't nice
either. These are truly "Carpenterian" heroes (lone, cynical,
anarchist), and the director has said he sees them as idealised
projections of himself. If that's true, better not mess around with this
guy... It must also be said that Crow's attitude to women is not
politically correct. Jack Crow won't have an Erica Jong novel in his
bookcase... Daniel Baldwin is not special at all. Competent, nothing
more. This could have been a nice role for Kurt Russel. It is a pity we
don't see Sheryl Lee more often on the screen: she's a good actress
(though her dialogue is minimal here) and of course, rather pleasing on
the eye. But the big surprise of the movie is Thomas Ian Griffith. I
didn't know him, but it seems he played in some B-grade action movies.
His Valek is a truly magnificent, powerful and scary vampire. He has the
charisma of Christopher Lee. The fact that he is really tall, makes him
seem even more supernatural and invincible. What a change compared to
Coppola's wimp Dracula!
Some other nice touches: the music has evolved, too: there are some
typical Carpenter rhythms but they are held together with guitar sounds
which reminded me of Ry Cooder (okay, not as good as Cooder). All in
all, it seemed like one of JC's better soundtracks, and I am curious if
it will also work as stand-alone music. And considering the story: the
way the church is tied-in to the vampire myth is refreshing and there's
some nice use of telepathy (also unexpected in a vampire movie). The
inventive way the vampires are killed produces some extreme images.
Perhaps it works so well because it isn't played for laughs (unlike From
Dusk Till Dawn, for example). You'll see...
Perhaps you are thinking: "Okay, but what about cardboard characters? Or
an underdeveloped script?" Well, since you insist, I have to explain
it... This movie deals with professionals. They don't start some
freudian whining when something bad happens. They act. The characters
are defined by their actions, less by their dialogue. Therefore, the bit
of love-interest isn't drenched in Titanic-like romanticism. Vampires
just wants to be creepy. The rest is superficial. By concentrating fully
on the essential elements of what makes a good horror film, it succeeds.
You can actually apply this reasoning on most of Carpenter's movies.
Is everything in the movie that excellent? Sadly, I have to make one
remark: it really feels like the remaining budget suddenly evaporated
while the ending was being filmed. It should have been a big,
nail-biting finale. What we get to see is reasonably suspenseful in its
build-up but like I said, it seems the moviemakers ran out of money. I
don't want to give away too many spoilers, I think you will notice it
yourself. Some running people, some shots are heard (not seen). It's all
over rather quickly. I believe Carpenter wanted to save it with quick
editing. Now, if Stanley Kubrick is allowed to film for 15 months and is
recently even doing re-shoots for a month, perhaps it would be nice to
flesh out the ending of Vampires somewhat. Otherwise, the movie is very
enjoyable and there's a constant tension. The motel scene will be
classic among horror fans. If I compare the movie to Prince of Darkness,
Carpenter's last truly excellent horror movie, Vampires scores less on
the edge-of-the-seat factor, perhaps because POD was much more
claustrophobic. Or perhaps also because of the change in filming style.
Whatever, Vampires is suspenseful and there's a lot of (gory) action.
Highly recommended for genre lovers who are tired of standard
horror-movies, or amateurs of wayward but skilled film-making in
general.</P>
<P>Score: I think it is in Carpenter's top 5. You can convert this to your
own units of appreciation.</P>
