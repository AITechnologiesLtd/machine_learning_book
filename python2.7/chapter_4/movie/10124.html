<P>The third adaptation from novelist Henry James, "Wings of the Dove" is
a complex and heartbreaking love story taken place in turn of the
century Europe. It's more absorbing and much deeper than what most
moviegoers might be accustomed to. In stark contrast to most of this
summer action blockbusters, or even drama for that matter, "Wings" is a
plot, character, and dialogue driven story that relies on shrewd and
perceptive writing to entertain the audience. Conventional Hollywood
material this is not.</P>
<P>Apparently movie-makers have a strong desire for James' novels. This
last year has seen Jane Campion's "Portrait of a Lady," Agnieszka
Holland's "Washington Square" and now Iain Softley's "The Wings of the
Dove." </P>
<P>This emotionally involving story explores love, would be lovers, and
the desire to be loved in a status-conscious 1900s Europe. Helena
Bonham Carter gives a subtle but heartfelt performance as Kate Croy.
Her character is introduced just after she has been acquired as a ward
by her aunt, the dominant and aristocratic Maude (Charlotte Rampling).
Maude gives Kate wealth and status and also provides money for the
girl's father, but at a price. Kate is forbidden to marry for love
alone or do anything else that might offend the sensibilities of the
ruling class. Aunt Maude makes no pretense of the fact that she intends
to marry Kate off to an equally wealth-obsessed suitor, and she's shown
doing just that early on in the film.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for her, Kate is in love with a handsome journalist
Merton Densher (Linus Roache). He wants to marry her immediately, but
Kate, is reluctant professing to be "not good at being impulsive." She
also knows such an act would threaten both her own and her father's
security. Her apprehension eventually breaks the relationship apart.</P>
<P>Time passes, and American heiress Millie Theale (Alison Elliott), "the
world's richest orphan," appears in London. A free-spirit blessed with
a warm heart and, she quickly develops a relationship with Kate.</P>
<P>Their friendship grows but Millie doesn't reveal that her trip is also
for medical reasons. Kate starts to suspect that Millie's trip to
Europe is indeed for more than just an impulsive need to travel.
Consequently, she develops a brazen plot that may result in her and her
father's financial dependence on their control-freak aunt.</P>
<P>The two of them eventually run across Merton at a social gathering.
Millie eyes the handsome young reporter and quickly develops a crush on
him. Kate doesn't reveal until later that the two of them were once
involved.</P>
<P>We're led to believe that Kate is just using the friendship to gain
wealth but when suspicions of her fragile wealth are confirmed, it
turns out she does in fact, have deep personal connection with Millie.
This is shown in one of the more touching moments of the movie. Upon
finding out Millie is dying, Kate walks to her bedroom and curls up in
bed next to her with a look of sadness on her face.</P>
<P>Millie's wandering needs eventually leads the two of them to Venice,
Italy where we see the relationship continue to grow. She doesn't hide
the fact that she would like to feel a man's love, but continues to
hide the reason for her urgency. Kate, being quite perceptive,
persuades Merton to join them in Italy. He shows up and eventually
finds out the real purpose of why she is going out of her way to him
and Millie together. When questioned whether the ploy will work, Kate's
best reply is "I know how she loves."</P>
<P>"Wings" is a powerful movie due primarily to the skillful acting by all
the cast. Carter especially stands out, giving a well developed, deeply
moving performance as the lead protagonist. You can truly feel the
romantic desires and passions both expressed and repressed as she
reluctantly pushes herself and her companions to continue in what will
obviously and in emotional tragedy. She's adept at portaying an
enigmatic character; she causes much of the anguish yet we can't help
but feel sympathy when she says, "I hurt so much you can't imagine."
Being required to play someone unknowable and emotionally complex, she
is sensational.</P>
<P>The setting itself is richly appointed and beautifully artistic. The
filming takes place in both upper-crust London and an especially artsy
Venice, which may lead an imaginative viewer to believe this was the
Italy of the renaissance era. Costume designs are equally elaborate,
whether it's the simple tweed of the men's suits or the intricate
dresses and enormous hats that were in vogue during that period. </P>
<P>The settings being what they are, "Wings" succeeds because of James'
gift for developing charters throughout the story. This is indeed the
quintessential "art-house film" that is all too lacking from the
studios of Hollywood.</P>
