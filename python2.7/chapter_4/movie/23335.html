LOLITA (1962)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Contemporary media are flooded with images of young, often
adolescent, girls (and boys), who are sometimes not so
subtly presented as desirable sexual objects. However, if
someone takes those not so subliminal messages seriously and
tries to act on them, he is usually branded as worst
possible human scum and monster. Even worse things happen to
those who try make books or movies in which they try to
present that problem from the perspective of such monsters.
If such reaction could be expected in our, presumably more
liberal, time we could only imagine the difficulties that
faced the authors of similar books and films few decades
ago. Taking this into account, we must really appreciate the
bravery of Russian emigre author Vladimir Nabokov. In 1955
he risked his reputation with his novel LOLITA, novel that
described obsession of middle-aged intellectual with 12-year
old girl. Seven years later, the literary world was still
recovering from the shock when another great artist showed
the same bravery. Stanley Kubrick took almost impossible
task of adapting this controversial novel for the silver
screen, and the result was one of the landmark events in
history of cinema.</P>
<P>Plot of the film deals with Professor Humbert Humbert
(played by James Mason), European writer who came to America
after WW2. Before he takes teaching position in one of
American colleges, Humbert would like to spend summer in
small resort town of Ramsdale, New Hampshire. He rents the
room in the home of Charlotte Haze (played by Shelley
Winters), widow who is obviously attracted to cultivated
European. Humbert, on the other hand, becomes enchanted with
her 15-year old daughter Dolores alias Lolita (played by Sue
Lyon), who seems to enjoy teasing him. After some time
Humbert decides to marry Charlotte only to remain close to
the object of his affection. This bizarre love triangle is
crushed when Charlotte finds Humbert's secret diary in which
he described his true feelings. Unable to confront mind-
shattering discovery, Charlotte runs on the street and gets
killed by a car. Humbert is now free to have his way with
Lolita and use his role of stepfather in order to become her
lover. But his idyllic life and relationship would be
threatened by group of mysterious people that seem to be
connected to television writer Clare Quilty (played by Peter
Sellers).</P>
<P>Although Nabokov himself wrote the screenplay and although
he praised the film in later interviews, many fans of the
novel accuse Kubrick of unfaithfulness to the film's
literary source. Many of those people forget that the best
novels are often very difficult or almost impossible to be
faithfully adapted for the screen, and that Kubrick, like
any other sensible filmmaker, had to make some serious
changes in the material and re-write Nabokov's original 400
page screenplay in order to make it filmable. During such
re-writes Kubrick also had to take censorship into account;
some changes had to be made in order to accommodate the
producers and conservative segments of the audience. The
most important in all those changes was the decision to
raise the age of Lolita from 12 to 15, thus making her
relationship with Humbert somewhat more acceptable for 1960s
standards. Kubrick thus made the film more acceptable for
censors, and LOLITA today seems rather tame. But the
promotional tagline "How did they ever make a movie of
Lolita?" was quite on the spot in its time, because it was
one of the first Hollywood films that tackled the issue of
erotic obsession and unconventional sexuality.</P>
<P>One of the reasons why the public accepted LOLITA was in
Kubrick's approach to Nabokov's material. Kubrick in all of
his classic films liked to present People As They Are, and
not People As They Should Be. Troubled characters of the
novel and writer's often-sarcastic observations about
post-WW2 America were perfect for Kubrick's trademark
cynicism. So, instead of moralising or presenting the events
of the novel as mind-shattering tragedy, Kubrick simply
turned LOLITA into dark comedy. All major characters in the
novel are deeply tragic, yet in Kubrick's vision they are
also very funny. The script equipped them with lines full of
double entendres, but Kubrick also makes us laugh with his
superb directorial skills. Almost any scene is elaborately
staged, with great care for the details that reveal much
about characters and things that they couldn't do or say on
the 1960s screen. The movie takes place in America, but
Kubrick used exclusively English locations. The audience,
thanks to suggestive black-and-white photography by Oswald
Morris, doesn't notice it, and this is another proof of
Kubrick's talent. Another example of such talent is the way
Kubrick turned producer's meddling of screenplay into
advantage - the producers insisted that the last scene of
the novel had to be shown in the beginning in order to
initially show the protagonist as cold-blooded murderer and
thus prevent any sympathies for him in the rest of the film.
Kubrick, instead, used this opportunity to make characters
more tragic - the audience know that they are doomed and all
their actions have a flavour of Greek tragedy laced with
misanthropy and black humour.</P>
<P>However, the most memorable element of the film is in its
characters and actors playing them. Sue Lyon, who plays
Lolita, was 16 years old during the production and that is
probably movie's only major flaw. Her figure - which is
quite evident in the scenes like her introduction to
Humbert, when she tans herself on the lawn, wearing skimpy
bikini - is somewhat too developed for someone we usually
associate with paedophiles' dark objects of desire. Lyon
tries to compensate that by playing Lolita as immature
annoying brat trapped in the body of grown woman, and,
later, as clever teaser and manipulator. Lyon's talent is
enhanced with infantile, yet somewhat menacing musical theme
by Bob Harris that plays constantly in background. Another
great performance is given by Shelley Winters, whose role
seems somewhat similar to the role she had played in
Laughton's NIGHT OF THE HUNTER. Similarity is mostly in the
terms of sexual frustration; in this film Winters is quite
successful in portraying obnoxious and shallow woman, whose
pathetic attempts to show herself as educated and cultivated
cause many laughs among intellectuals within film's
audience. Although Shelley Winters became somewhat typecast
after this film, her performance is great; her character
might be poster girl for misogyny, but we still pity her.
James Mason as Humbert Humbert has more scenes, since the
story is being told from his POV, but he fares no better in
the end. Mason portrays this cultivated, mild- mannered
gentleman from aristocratic Europe as being equally affected
by dark desires and perversions as the rest of society.
Contrast between his noble outside image (and the fact that
he remains desirable sexual object for females despite being
middle-aged) and his downright pathetic actions bring a lot
of dark humour to this film. However, the man who stole the
film is Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty. Sellers does wonders
with the character reduced to nothing more than dark,
menacing presence in the novel, making him vulgar,
unscrupulous but intelligent and finally superior to
old-school Humbert. Sellers also used this opportunity to
experiment by playing the same character in three different
incarnations, which would, later lead to the great multiple
roles in Kubrick's DOCTOR STRANGELOVE. Many people like to
criticise Sellers' multiple appearances in the film as too
distracting, but his presence actually contributes to film's
ironic tone.</P>
<P>The biggest flaw of LOLITA is perhaps the fact that it
wasn't made ten or fifteen years later, when the attitudes
towards depiction of sex or taboo subjects like paedophilia
and incest were more liberal (when Louis Malle made few
brave excursions into such dark area). However, Kubrick made
excellent film even in such circumstances, and today's
audience may still enjoy it, which is another proof of its
timeless quality. LOLITA also became one of those great
films that have the rare privilege of having been remade in
satisfactory fashion by Adrian Lyne in 1997.</P>
