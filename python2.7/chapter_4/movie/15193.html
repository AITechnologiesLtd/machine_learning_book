<P>If you think the 18-month shoot of "Eyes Wide Shut" is out of the ordinary
for perfectionist director Stanley Kubrick consider that "The Shining" also
took two years to get onscreen; the film began shooting in May of 1978 and
was released in June of 1980.
 Early reviews were decidedly mixed, with some critics wondering what
attracted Kubrick to Stephen King's tale of murder and madness in a remote,
snowbound hotel in the first place and why, if he had to make the picture at
all, Kubrick had given it such a deliberate, dreamy pace and allowed Jack
Nicholson to go so far over the top. Though "The Shining" performed fairly
well at the box office, it continued to be controversial: King panned it in
the press for the liberties Kubrick had taken with his book, and instead of
Oscar nominations, Kubrick and Shelley Duvall instead found themselves in
the running for the uncoveted Golden Raspberry Awards as Worst Director and
Worst Actress respectively. Just for the record, both lost.
 As demonstrated by an excellent website devoted to "The Shining" at
brain.mindbuilder.com/mkraft/shining/index.html, the movie's reputation has
improved substantially in the past 18 years. Nicholson fans hail his work
here as one of his landmark funny/scary performances and Kubrick admirers
who once dismissed the movie as a misstep have since learned to appreciate
its special brand of psychological terror. Few directors would dare to make
a horror movie in which the first hour is devoted almost entirely to
backstory and character development, but that's one of the reasons Kubrick
is, well, Kubrick.
 Its unconventionality makes "The Shining" one of those rare thrillers that
actually benefits from repeated viewings, although the movie is so unnerving
many viewers have never made it all the way through even once. Frustrated
writer and recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance (Nicholson), his colorless
wife Wendy (Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) agree to move into the
mammoth Overlook Hotel and to look after the property during the winter
season when the mountain resort is shut down. Almost immediately however,
the bad vibes begin to flow, and Danny's psychic powers go into overdrive,
conjuring up visions of blood-spattered walls, sinister-looking twin girls
and the cryptic message "REDRUM."
 Though the recent "Shining" TV mini-series was more faithful to King's
original and was perhaps more frightening in the traditional sense, few
films have ever built up and sustained an eerie atmosphere as successful as
Kubrick does here. Although The Overlook is an enormous place with multiple
floors and seemingly endless hallways (which we are forced to explore
repeatedly in one Steadicam tracking shot after another) Kubrick makes it
clear the hotel is as constraining as a prison cell -- a nicely appointed
cell, perhaps, but a cell nonetheless. By the movie's midpoint, the feeling
of claustrophobia is inescapable, and when Jack's mind finally snaps and he
begins stalking Wendy and Danny, "The Shining" becomes a true nerve-wracker.
 Of course, nobody plays madness quite like Nicholson, and you can see him
laying the groundwork in this manic performance for such later wackos as
Darryl Van Horn in "The Witches of Eastwick" and the Joker in "Batman." With
her fey Texas accent and rag-doll smile, Duvall is truly irritating, but
that actually works in the actress' favor; she daringly challenges us to
root for Wendy. Scatman Crothers is also effective as the Overlook veteran
who has something in common with Danny.
 Is "The Shining" really the masterpiece Kubrick worshippers would have you
believe it is? No. Even though the tension is sustained throughout, the
first reviews were right about the movie being overlong, and Jack flies off
the handle a bit too abruptly rather than gradually sinking into psychotic
behavior as he did in the book. The ending may initially strike you as
clever, but the more you think about it the less satisfying it seems.
 But there's never been a shocker quite like "The Shining," and it seems
likely to remain one-of-a-kind. Like all of Kubrick's films, whether you
love it or hate it, it's sure to be a conversation-starter.
