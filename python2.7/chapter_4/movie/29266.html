<PRE>AMERICAN OUTLAWS
----------------</PRE>
<P>When Jesse (Colin Farrell, "Tigerland") and Frank James (Gabriel Macht,
"The Adventures of Sebastian Cole") and Cole (Scott Caan, "Ready to Rumble")
and Bob Younger (Will McCormack, "Boiler Room") return home as renegade
soldiers from the wrong side of the Civil War, they immediately must face
losing their farms to railroad expansion.  Hot-tempered Cole kills two men
defending his family and is sentenced to be hung, but Jesse James saves
Cole while humiliating railroad baron Thaddeus Raines (Harris Yulin, "Rush
Hour II") and his hired detective agency head Alan Pinkerton (Timothy Dalton,
"License to Kill").  They retaliate by burning down peoples' homes, killing
Jesse and Frank's Ma (Kathy Bates, "Misery") in the process.  Jesse and his 
friends decide they need to go to war against the railroad and the James Gang 
is born in "American Outlaws."</P>
<P>"American Outlaws'" tagline of 'Bad is good again' couldn't be more apt -
this is one flick that's so atrociously ridiculous it's entertaining,
the classic bad good movie.  Thankfully it has the sense not to take itself
too seriously, although there are groaners a'plenty when it does.</P>
<P>Screenwriters Roderick Taylor (TV's "Wild Horses") and John Rogers (standup
comic!) throw history out the window, give Jesse a comely, modern love
interest in Zee (Ali Larter, "Legally Blonde") and turn their young guns
into Robin Hoods.  While some of the sparring is amusing, other dialogue
is unintentionally gutbusting ('Don't turn around.  If you don't see it, 
it's not real.')</P>
<P>Director Les Mayfield ("Blue Streak") maintains a fast pace and makes his
cast look (mostly) good while showing no aptitude for creating a realistic
Western (one central stunt is right out of "The Wild, Wild West").  Gabriel 
Macht has good screen presence as mediator Frank James, Scott Caan does the 
chipped shoulder well and Will McCormack provides some top notch comic relief. </P>
<P>Colin Farrell, so highly praised for his work in the little seen "Tigerland," 
is the pretty, daring-do loverboy here, and proves himself capable of both 
a teen heartthrob turn and 'Matrix' era stunt work.  Gregory Smith ("The 
Patriot") also acquits himself well as the younger Younger brother, who 
insists on riding with the gang.  Kathy Bates plays Ma for yucks and gets 
them, even in her death scene (grossly mishandled by Mayfield).  Timothy Dalton</P>
<P>does a horrendous Sean Connery impersonation and Terry O'Quinn ("The 
Stepfather") mostly looks constipated.  Ronny Cox acts cutely clueless as 
Zee's dad.</P>
<P>"American Outlaws?"  More like Ludicrous Larcenists...</P>
