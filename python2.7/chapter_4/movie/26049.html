<PRE>POLA X
A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>When I left the theater, an angry woman was berating her boyfriend for
dragging her to another one of those films, to which I assume she meant
a pompous French soap opera. Furthermore, she didn't understand what the
title had to do with anything. Seems she didn't read the press release,
which the theater was kind enough to dole out. Pola X is a French
acronym of the Hermann Melville novel on which this film is based (and
shakily updated to modern times): Pierre, Or, the Ambiguities. The X
stands for the tenth draft of the screenplay which writer/director Leos
Carax completed.</P>
<P>While the title, Pola X, certainly has a nice ring to it, it stands
representative of everything Carax's movie is: all flash, pointless
trickery, grating snobbery and, ultimately, no more substance than a
private joke only one person finds amusing.</P>
<P>As with most soap operas, the lead character, Pierre (lanky Guillaume
Depardieu, son of Gerard) is an affluent, slightly tormented and wholly
beautiful young writer who stays with his Oedipal mother, Marie
(Catherine Deneuve, adding a touch of elegance) on her lavish estate
near the banks of the Seine. He is happy enough riding around on his
motorcycle through the countryside, sitting on the hills, and enjoying
sunsets with his fiancée (Delphine Chuillot) and living the life of a
spoiled dilettante.</P>
<P>The cinematography by Eric Gautier is luscious, painted in golden
sunsets and the rich creamy whites of sheets and elegant tablecloths. As
Pierre and his mother coast through their lazy days, there's comfort to
be found in the crisp images of a fine chateau, or freshly trimmed grass
being watered by ominous sprinklers. This beauty gives way to a bleak,
bleached, Dickensian look when Pierre encounters a homeless stranger
(Yekaterina Golubyova) with a haunted expression in her eyes and a thick
Russian accent. This simple woman claims to be his sister, Isabelle.</P>
<P>In the longest scene in the film, the one which director Leos Carax
claims inspired him to shoot Pola X, this mysterious woman leads Pierre
deep into a fairy tale inspired by some tangled wood and spins a long,
slow dramatic monologue about her life of misery and squalor.
Golubyova's slow, mannered delivery was difficult to follow and my
attention continually wavered, but the plot thankfully marched on
thereafter.</P>
<P>To right the wrongs of his father, Pierre abandons his old life and runs
away with Isabelle to a life of filthy hovels, dirty apartments and art
communes with a strange John Zorn-experimental rock group in a cavernous
warehouse. They are accompanied by a vagrant mother, her precocious
"cute" little daughter (who tells passers-by that they stink -- ain't it
cute?) and Scott Walker's rousing score of lush violins.</P>
<P>"All my life," he whispers with vigor, "I've waited for something that
would push me beyond all this." Feeling as though he has never had any
true experiences in life, he throws himself into writing his Great Book
of Truths while sleeping with Isabelle in extended, fleshy sex scenes.
The body doubles are working overtime, as Leos Carax leaves no orifice
unturned. He'll go to any lengths to push the buttons of his audience,
though it seems to play merely for shock value alone.</P>
<P>Pola X has a terrific look to it. The homeless scenes seem inspired by
Mike Leigh's Naked, and Guillaume Depardieu, in his all-black attire,
long coat, and scraggly beard bears more than a passing resemblance to
an angry David Thewlis. Unfortunately, the story is an annoying mass of
manipulative contrivances involving Grand Drama, such as the main
character's descent into madness, the severe illness of another major
character a la Camille, accidents, suicide, children in peril, incest,
family secrets hidden behind a stone wall, and revelatory speeches.</P>
<P>These elements are more fitting of an opera than a motion picture.
Director Leos Carax sprinkles on some images that scream art-house
indulgence, such as a dream sequence where characters spiral naked down
a waterfall of blood. Despite his title, there's nothing ambiguous in
that at all. Excessive in every way, Pola X flounders and drowns in its
own melodrama.</P>
