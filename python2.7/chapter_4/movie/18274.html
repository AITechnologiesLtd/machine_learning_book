LANDSCAPE IN THE MIST  (director: Theo Angelopoulos; cast: Michalis Zeke
(Alexandre), Tania Palaiologou (Voula), Stratos Tzortzoglou (Oreste),
Vassilis Kolovos (Truck driver), Dimitris Kaberidis (Uncle), 1988-Greek)</P>
<P>None of us know where we are going, could be the theme for this road
movie, which is more intense and somber than most other movies of this
ilk. The plot is very simple, a small boy and a slightly older girl want
to go to their father, who their Greek mother told them is living in
Germany. They don't know his name or have his address, or for that
matter know if he really exists, yet one day they steal aboard a train
and they are heading north, through the Greek countryside, their
destination being Germany. Trains are always mysterious places for
travelers, they take on their own strange landscape.This Greek
travelogue is definetly not a touristy one, the itinerary is
frightening, the barrenness of the stations is eerie, the mood is
strikingly joyless, as these kids are living in a dream world, seeing in
their dreams a father they never knew but deeply yearn for. When they
are caught by the conductor as possible runaways and are turned over to
the authorities, all they manage to say is that they are going to their
uncle's place. It turns out that they do have an uncle in this
small-town, but when he meets with the police, he tells them that he
can't take responsibility for these kids, that his sister lied to them
about their father, because she didn't want to tell them that they were
illegitimate.The girl overhears this, but refuses to believe it, running
away with the boy, as they continue hitchhiking  north.</P>
<P>They are picked up by a miserable truck driver, and are subject to his
depravity. Their dreamlike odyssey, nevertheless, continuing, ever
moving northward. One of the more interesting and better people they
meet, is Orestes, a young man on a motorcycle, a roadie for an acting
troupe, a loner about to go into the army. He becomes a father figure to
the kids, his silence and mythic presence is a tower of strength to the
frightened and lost kids, who can't open up to him and tell him where
they are going, they can only tell him that they are heading north. He
vows to help them get on the train, he sees that as his special mission.
His youth can be viewed in contrast to the old country dying all around
him. His goodness and restlessness represents the hope of the country.
The north represents the unknown, a place of childhood fantasies.</P>
<P>The question asked, is why carry on, if you can't reach where you are
going? The subtle answer, probably lies in what lies beyond the mist,
there must be something to believe in, even if you can't see it.</P>
<P>The camera work is stupendous, capturing in total the dreamlike quality
of the film. We witness a wedding in the snow, a giant hand of creation
being lifted out of the sea by a crane, and the innocent kids gazing out
at a world of adults that is incomprehensible to them. The mood is so
harsh, even biblical in scope, that when it asks the question in its
voice-over, "If I were to shout, who would hear me?" We are left
speechless, knowing that we are ruled by fate, that the poor kids, whose
plight tugs at our heartstrings, will not be given an easy way out of
their predicament. This film is not a soapy Hollywood production, it is
a film that is meant to haunt us, to make us ask questions that we
cannot easily answer.</P>
