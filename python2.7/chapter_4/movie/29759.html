<PRE>"Training Day"</PRE>
<P>Idealistic, rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is about to face the most
important day in his life. He has 24-hours to prove himself worthy of a
detective's shield under the watchful eye and guidance of Detective
Sergeant Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), a 13-year veteran who lives and
breathes the streets. Jakes sense of honor and justice is about to be
challenged by the experience drug enforcement officer who has developed his
own sense of honor and justice in "Training Day."</P>
<P>Alonzo establishes his authority as the big dog right from the start when
he phones Jake in the wee hours of the rookie's test day, ordering the
younger man to meet him at a certain diner and hanging up as Hoyt begins to
thank him for his chance to make detective. From here, Alonzo maintains the
upper hand with Jake and forces him to do things that Hoyt knows are
downright wrong. Harris continues to challenge the newcomer, showing Jake
the real underbelly of the streets as he brings him through places where no
white guy, especially an eager young cop, has gone before. Almost from the
start of their relationship, Alonzo unabashedly declares that Jake will be
his "nigger" if he wants to get ahead.</P>
<P>Denzel Washington is being touted, in some circles as a contender for
awards come year's end. The actor gives a good, not a great, performance in
a solid role that is counter to his usual noble, kind persona he normally
takes one. His Alonzo Harris is a studied performance with the actor
getting down and dirty as a cop whose sense of justice has evolved away
from enforcing the written law to honoring what he calls "street justice."
When the naïve Jake makes him pull over to stop the rape of a 14-year-old
Catholic schoolgirl, Alonzo kicks the bejeezus out of the perps, steals
their money and sets them free, much to the rookie cop's amazement and
chagrin. King Kong, he tells us near the end, ain't got nothin' on him as
the veteran detective walks a dangerous line. A side story, important in
the finale, has Alonzo in deep with the Russian Mafia, further establishing
the vet's walking the dark edges of illegality, though this sidebar seems
unnecessary.</P>
<P>Ethan Hawke gives a convincing performance as Jake Hoyt. Jake kissed his
wife and baby in the morning and left home a fresh-faced idealist. He
returns, a day later, as a battered and bruised cynic, but, for all that, a
man transformed into an enlightened, better cop. Alonzo shook Jake's
concepts of "justice" and the younger man comes away with a more intense,
realistic understanding of right and wrong. Hawke gives an effective
character study to his perf and stands toe-to-toe with the much more
flamboyant Washington, whose Alonzo Harris is an unpredictable loose canon
who has been, unbeknownst to himself, completely changed, morally, by his
constant dealings in the mean streets of LA.</P>
<P>While few members (actually none) of the supporting are given a great deal
of screen time, there is a wealth of fine acting in what are,
unfortunately, very small rolls. Most notable is Macy Gray as the wife of a
drug dealer whose home Alonzo invades on the pretext of looking for drugs
but his real agenda is to rip off the merchant of his ill-gotten cash. The
newcomer makes a splash as the street-savvy housewife who sees Alonzo for
what he is. Snoop Dog is depravedly solid as a wheelchair bound crack
peddler that Alonzo forces information from. There are many more tight
little perfs given by mostly unknown thesps. For name actors we have Scott
Glenn as one of Harris's victim/criminals and Tom Berenger as one of
Alonzo's equally corrupt colleagues.</P>
<P>The screenplay, by David Ayer ("U-571" and "The Fast and the Furious"),
packs an awful lot of gritty activity into what is supposed to be a single
day. This throws the pace of the film off as it takes a suspension of
disbelief to accept that so much tension, angst, confrontation and violence
would happen in just 24-hours. After a day like this, Jake should be ready
to retire as Alonzo first coerces him into smoking PCP (jeopardizing Jake's
professional status as a cop), involves him in an unsavory bust that
results in cold-blooded murder, drags the rookie into an illegal shakedown
and strands him in a life-threatening situation in a place where no
inexperienced, young, white cop should ever find himself. I understand the
single-day story, but question the amount of action and narrative that is
compressed into the limited timeframe. By the end of Jake's first day at
school I felt like I needed a vacation.</P>
<P>Director Antoine Fuqua ("The Replacement Killer") keeps things tight and
moving along at a brisk pace, even when much of the action consists of the
two cops driving around with Alonzo pontificating to his latest disciple
about the rules of survival on the streets of Los Angeles. Relatively
unknown director of photography, Mauro Fiore, provides an active, fluid,
moving camera that helps get across the street flavor and danger. He
manipulates the normal color palette when Jake smokes PCP for the first
time and sees the world in screwed up colors and distorted images. The
night shoots are crisp and clear as Jake confronts his demon, Alonzo, to
stop his superior's personal, corrupt plans. Costuming, by Michele Michel,
maintains the look of the streets with Alonzo dressed all in black, like an
avenger descended upon the city, with his shield hung around his neck like
an over-gold gangsta.</P>
<P>The hype preceding "Training Day" makes expectations for the film high. It
is, like Washington's performance, good not great. Hawke gives one of his
best perfs to date. I only wish the wonderful supporting cast were given
more to do. I give it a B-.</P>
