<P>Duets (2000) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Paul Giamatti,
Andre Braugher, Huey Lewis, Scott Speedman, Maria Bello and Angie
Dickinson. Written by John Byrum. Directed by Bruce Paltrow. Rated R.</P>
<P> When the performers are on stage, "Duets" soars. But when this uneven
movie follows its performers offstage it is transformed into a
discordant, cliched, mess.</P>
<P> This episodic comedy-drama lacks direction and cohesion as it follows
three plotlines that converge on the stage in Omaha, Neb., for the
$5,000 Grand Prize Karaoke Contest.</P>
<P> The most intriguing story involves Todd Woods (Paul Giamatti), a driven
salesman who suffers a meltdown while chasing the American Dream, who
chucks it all to go on stage and sing, and his connection with Reggie
Kane (Andre Braugher), an ex-con with the voice of an angel who is
unwilling to follow society's rules.</P>
<P> When these two performers are on screen - and on stage - "Duets" is
magical.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, the film's other stories are weak sisters. One involves
a Karaoke hustler (Huey Lewis) who is saddled with the daughter he
hasn't seen in years. She's a Las Vegas showgirl (Gwyneth Paltrow) who
wants only to belong to a family.</P>
<P> The other story involves Suzi Loomis (Maria Bello), an earthy waitress
who sees winning the contest as a stepping stone to a musical career and
is willing to do anything to attain her goal. She hooks up with an
idealistic cab driver, Billy (Scott Speedman), whom she convinces to
drive her to Omaha.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, director Bruce Paltrow (Gwyneth's father) cannot get
screenwriter John Byrum's script to gel. It is fragmented and jagged,
never coalescing into one coherent story.</P>
<P> Plus the mixture of schmaltz, drama and comedy never comfortably
adhere.</P>
<P> Gwyneth Paltrow's character, Liv, is very unfocused and ill-defined.
She acts like a naive, almost simple, child, chasing dad Ricky Dean
(Lewis) around like a hurt puppy.</P>
<P> Bello's Loomis is too self-centered to care about, while Speedman's
Billy is too idealistic to be believed.</P>
<P> And while Giamatti's Woods is a bit over the top, he is the one
character you can root for and make an emotional connection with. You
feel his pain and disillusionment.</P>
<P> Braugher's character, while interesting, seems a bit too sketchy and
his ultimate sacrifice seems more a plot contrivance.</P>
<P> But the movie's best moments are the ones involving the music. When
these characters are on stage - whether singing themselves or via voice
doubles - "Duets" shows signs of greatness.</P>
<P> If you like good music, "Duets" is a movie you should see, despite its
many flaws and shortcomings.</P>
<P> It is too bad that the care and attention lavished on the musical
numbers could not be transferred to the other parts of the film.</P>
