<PRE>
_Jay_and_Silent_Bob_Strike_Back_ *** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        More than other filmmaker in recent memory, writer-director Kevin
Smith is unusually receptive and accessible to his rabid (and
consistently growing) fanbase.  The discussion board on his official
website (viewaskew.com) is legendary for the amount of interaction he has
with fans; and public appearances and autograph signings are far from
rare occurrences, with the latter usually extending hours beyond their
allotted time blocks in order to accommodate every last person in line. 
But even Smith has outdone himself in terms of giving back to his public
with the wild comic romp _Jay_and_Silent_Bob_Strike_Back_, which behind
its outrageous surface is an affectionate valentine to those who have
loyally followed him and his work over the years.</P>
<P>        So for this film more than any of his others, it certainly is
beneficial (though just as certainly not necessary) to walk in with some
prior knowledge of Smith's "View Askew-niverse," which officially closes
with _Strike_Back_.  The title characters, foulmouthed drug dealer Jay
(Jason Mewes) and his laconic "hetero lifemate" Silent Bob (Smith), are
the Askew-niverse's most beloved figures, having appeared in all of
Smith's previous films in capacities small (_Clerks_, _Chasing_Amy_) and
larger (_Mallrats_, _Dogma_).  _Strike_Back_ gives the pair their
long-due turn on center stage, and in an added bonus for the fandom,
resurfacing especially for this occasion are other popular characters
from those four films.  Needless to say, only those with some Smith
oeuvre familiarity will fully appreciate the appearances of people such
as _Clerks_' Dante and Randal (respectively played by Brian O'Halloran
and Jeff Anderson), who to the VA-virgin eye would seem to be just bit
players.</P>
<P>        The significance of _Amy_'s Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) and Banky
Edwards (Jason Lee, who also turns in an appearance as the best thing
about _Mallrats_, Brodie Bruce), however, won't be lost on any newcomers,
for they nudge Jay and Silent Bob--the movie and the characters--into
action.  _Bluntman_and_Chronic_, the superhero comic book Holden and
Banky modeled in the likeness of Jay and Bob, is about to be adapted into
a film without our dynamic duo's permission, and so they set off on a
cross-country trip from New Jersey to Hollywood to stop the production. 
Obviously, the more serious overtones of Smith's last two efforts, _Amy_
and _Dogma_, are nowhere to be found in _Strike_Back_, and don't come in
looking for some innovations in plotting, either; the film is simply a
road/chase comedy that wants nothing more than to make the audience
laugh.</P>
<P>        And are there ever laughs to be had in _Strike_Back_.  Indeed,
Smith's famous (infamous?) predilection for dick and fart jokes is very
much in evidence (though, thankfully, there's nothing here approaching
the scatological nadir of _Dogma_'s Golgothan), yet while he may have
gained a fair amount of notoriety for that lowbrow brand of humor, his
greatest strength has always been the rapier wit of his dialogue,
whenever raunchy or not.  On the receiving end of many of the film's best
verbal barbs is the glitzy world of Tinseltown moviemaking.  No one is
shielded from the hysterical satirical onslaught: not Internet gossip
sites; not Affleck, who gamely pulls double duty as Holden and himself;
not the film's distributor, Miramax; not even
_Jay_and_Silent_Bob_Strike_Back_ and the View Askew canon itself, and as
such the fourth wall is not only broken, but flat out bulldozed.</P>
<P>        Lest the film sound extremely insular with all its in-jokes and
Hollywood insider humor, _Jay_and_Silent_Bob_Strike_Back_ also offers a
number of broader-appeal delights, particularly in the performance
department.  That Mewes and Smith have their act down by now is no
surprise; Mewes invests his usual gusto into every last one of Jay's
four-letter words and vulgar gestures, which are, as always, countered
with expert reaction takes by Smith.  What is surprising, though, is
Shannon Elizabeth's beguiling turn as the sweet Justice, who falls for
Jay as she and her more sour friends Sissy (Eliza Dushku), Chrissy (Ali
Larter), and Missy (Jennifer Schwalbach, Smith's wife) spend time on the
road with him and Bob.  Other colorful characters pop up throughout the
course of the film, the standouts being Will Ferrell's clueless Federal
Wildlife Marshal Willenholly and Chaka (Chris Rock), a militant
African-American film director; and a multitude of stars recognizable to
all audiences turn up in some enjoyable cameos.</P>
<P>        The polished and at times--brace yourselves--slick visuals of
_Strike_Back_, undoubtedly due in large part to cinematographer Jamie
Anderson, will be downright shocking to Smith fans and especially to his
detractors, who will find themselves with one less thing to knock him on.
 I'm sure they will come up with plenty of compensatory ammunition in the
content of the film--or rather lack thereof.  With its shameless (and not
always successful) riffs on other movies, frequent references to his own
previous work, and slant toward broad antics in general, even Smith has
called _Strike_Back_ "a step backward" in his progression as a filmmaker.
 To hell with any perceived requirements for "artistic growth," I say, if
stagnation and regression are done in the name of offering a good time at
the movies--and _Jay_and_Silent_Bob_Strike_Back_ is nothing less than a
rollicking blast.  (This film is not yet rated; opens August 24)</P>
