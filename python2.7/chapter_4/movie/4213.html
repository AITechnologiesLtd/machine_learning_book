<PRE>                                COPYCAT
                       A film review by Ed Powell
                        Copyright 1995 Ed Powell</PRE>
<P>     COPYCAT is a suspense/thriller, where Sigourney Weaver plays a
criminal psychologist, that is attacked by a serial killer.
Fortunately for her, she isn't killed, and the killer is sent to
prison.  The attack has, however, left her mentally scarred, and she
now suffered from agrophobia (sp?).  Thirteen months later, still
scarred, she is asked by a police detective (Holly Hunter) to help
solve a series of murders.  It turns out that there is a serial killer
at work, and as you may have guessed, he is copying the methods of
other serial killers.  And ... to top it all off ... he is in league
with the serial killer that attacked Sigourney's character.</P>
<P>     The pace of this film seemed slow at times, but it wasn't boring.
It was suspenseful, but it wasn't edge-of-your-seat nail-biting
thrilling.  The story itself seemed real enough to have come from
today's headlines.  The script was well researched and was thoroughly
engrossing.</P>
<P>     The acting in this film was top-notch.  Sigourney played her part
of a criminal psychologist who drinks and takes a wide assortment of
medication in order to be able to get through the day without having a
mental breakdown quite well.  Holly, while not as believeable in the
role of a police detective, nevertheless was quite convincing in the
role.  A good deal of the male roles in the film seemed to get killed
off, but their roles were well played.</P>
<P>     Direction of this film was well above top notch.  I may not agree
with the director's (Jon Amiel) decision in using a few shots that made
me want to reach for a barf bag, he made the film a true visual
delight.</P>
<P>     COPYCAT is tamer than some suspense films I have seen, but it is a
great extra-dramatic experience.  If you have some or any interest in
what goes on in the minds of serial killers, this is great
entertainment.  Go see this film.</P>
<P>Produced by Arnon Milchary and Mark Tarlov.  Directed by Jon Amiel.
A Regency Enterprises/Warner Brothers release.</P>
