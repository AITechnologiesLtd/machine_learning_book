<P>  As the song "Yesterday" goes, "Why'd she have to go/ I
don't know/ She wouldn't say./ I said something wrong/ Now I
long for yesterday..."  Who doesn't?  If only we knew then
what we know now, our mistakes would be corrected and
life's mishaps would fall neatly into place.  Or would they? 
Many philosophers and psychologists believe that given the
basic character that each of us is stuck with, we'd make the
same blunders all over again--kind of like the person who
knows the smoking and overeating are bad for him but
continues to indulge in both.  Still, the opportunity to go back
to the past to smooth out our bungles and fumbles is so
tempting that a good many of us, given the choice, would opt
for doing just that over winning the lottery.  All of which
makes the premise a fascinating one for the storytellers,
including the Spanish team of Maria Ripoli, who directed
"Twice Upon a Yesterday" and Rafa Russo who wrote the
screenplay.  Though magic realism comes into play, the film--
once called "The Man with Rain in His Shoes" and then
named "If Only" before receiving the current title--does not
have the sci-fi look.  This film is for the most part not far from
a conventional romantic comedy with dramatic overtones,
whose characters are at once so thinly drawn and yet so
irritating that at times you may be tempted to look away from
the screen.  </P>
<P>   Take a look at the male lead,  Douglas Henshall in the role
of a Scottish 30-something who is so immature and
exasperating that you'd have to look back to a character like
Mari Hoff (Brenda Blethyn) in Mark Herman's movie "Little
Voice," to uncover his equal.  He acts in London's fringe
theaters, is considered mediocre, and lives in a flat that is as
untidy as he is unkempt.  Sylvia Weld (Lena Headey) and he
seem made for each other, given Sylvia's gamin-like
demeanor and flighty behavior.  Sylvia's best girl friend,
Alison (Charlotte Coleman) is even worse: she spends much
of her time advising Sylvia to dump the lad, putting him down
as a mediocrity in every way who is entirely unsuitable for the
likes of Sylvia, while for his part, Victor's best friend Dave
(Mark Strong) deigns to counsel Victor on the ways of women
while he himself hasn't a clue about how to connect with any
one of their ilk.</P>
<P>    When Sylvia discovers that Victor has been unfaithful to
her (and Victor adds to injury to confessing that he loves
another), Sylvia leaves him.  Victor soon regrets what he has
done and gets his chance to correct his misbehavior when
two Spanish trash collectors sprung from the pages of Don
Quixote kick him back a year or so, giving the hapless suitor
the opportunity of a lifetime to make amends.  In one of the
two interesting twists to the tale, Victor finds that being on his
best behavior cannot prevent similar disasters from taking
place, while an even more arresting turn of events occurs in
the final minute of the story--one which encourages us to
debate over our post-cinema coffee how the situation will
ultimately turn out.</P>
<P>   On the whole, however, the movie has an awkward, first-
draft feel because most of the characters are so silly or bland
that caring about them is out of the question.  Not that a film
must have likeable personalities.  "Goodbye, Lover," for
example, features an unholy mess of evil people but the
performers are so attractive, so strong and convincing, that
we show concern for them despite their sinister
temperaments.  The one redeeming feature of "Twice Upon a
Yesterday" is the lovely Spanish actress Penelope Cruz--who
wowed lovers of art movies recently in the far more
imaginative production "Open Your Eyes."  As a bartender
with more class than the rest of the cast combined, Ms.
Cruz's Louise--the woman who gets the now-mature Victor's
undivided attention--is the movie's compelling high point.  On
the whole, however, the film lacks the whimsy that fables
must possess to realize their potential.</P>
