<PRE>The Man with the Golden Arm (1955)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 65</PRE>
<P>Otto Preminger directed this intense, dramatic
character study involving heroin addiction.
While sometimes overblown, the film is
interesting throughout.  The depiction of
addiction is not quite as harrowing as in
"The Lost Weekend", but still has more teeth
than most attempts by Hollywood studios.
Preminger's efforts were rewarded with three
Academy Award nominations, including a
Best Actor nod to Frank Sinatra.</P>
<P>Frank Sinatra starred as Frankie Machine, a
respected card dealer in illegal poker games,
and a sometime dope addict.  Frankie attempts
to rebuild his life after leaving prison,
by becoming a professional drummer.  But,
having returned to the old neighborhood,
the old vices return as well, and Frankie
ends up back where he started: addicted and
dealing.</P>
<P>Sinatra gives an excellent performance, and
any excesses can likely be attributed to
Preminger's direction.  The supporting cast
is good as well, with some interesting
characters.  Arnold Stang plays a nasal-voiced
dog lover who is also dog-like in his devotion
to Frankie, and in his antagonism towards
Frankie's enemies.  Eleanor Parker is fine
as Frankie's clinging, disturbed wife, who
pretends to be paralyzed in an attempt to
keep his sympathy.  Darren McGavin is
surprisingly creepy as Frankie's pusher.
Kim Novak plays Frankie's mistress, but her
character is flat and conventional.  Well,
you can't have everything.</P>
