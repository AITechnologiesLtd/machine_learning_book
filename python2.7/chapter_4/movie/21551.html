<PRE>The Blackboard Bungle?  </PRE>
<P>Kevin Williamson is one of the hottest writers in Hollywood at
the moment.  He reinvigorated the slasher genre with Scream, and gave
us the intelligent, articulate, but typically angst-ridden teens of
the popular tv soap Dawson's Creek.  It seems he can do little wrong -
which is probably why the brains behind Miramax optimistically allowed
him to direct this screen adaptation based on the first screenplay he
wrote.</P>
<P>Williamson's main strengths as a writer are his sense of irony
and his ability to subvert genre clichés, and although many of
those typical touches are in evidence here, there is also something
lacking.  As a director, Williamson fails to make the grade with this
inauspicious debut.  The pacing is uneven, and the dialogue often
banal.  His direction is laboured and uninspired.  One feels
Williamson would have been better off leaving the directorial duties
to someone else.</P>
<P>The eponymous Mrs Tingle (Helen Mirren, from Prime Suspect,
etc) is a history teacher and a humourless curmudgeon who has been a
fixture at Grandsboro High for twenty years.  Far from inspiring her
students, she belittles their endeavours at every opportunity and
ruthlessly tramples over their ambitions and aspirations.  But now she
is about to get her comeuppance.
 </P>
<P>Leigh Ann Watson (Katie Holmes, from Dawson's Creek and the
recent Go, etc) is a top student, who has pinned her hopes on earning
a scholarship to college, thus enabling her to escape this dead end
town.  But Mrs Tingle puts a crimp in her hopes of becoming school
valedictorian by giving her a low grade for her history project.  Then
when Mrs Tingle catches Leigh Ann with a copy of the forthcoming exam
paper in her possession, she faces expulsion and humiliation.  In
desperation, Leigh Ann and her two friends, Jo (Marisa Coughlan) and
Luke (Barry Watson), the handsome but dumb jock, visit Mrs Tingle at
home and try to explain the misunderstanding.  Things quickly get out
of hand, and before long they have their unforgiving teacher tied to a
bed.</P>
<P>Even though helplessly bound, Mrs Tingle musters all the
skills developed over twenty years of negotiating the blackboard
jungle to unnerve her three captors and slowly turn them against each
other.  What begins as a promising scenario quickly degenerates into
unconvincing farce.  The ending itself is contrived and makes no real
sense dramatically, especially given the events that preceded it.</P>
<P>Although she spends a good deal of time uncomfortably tied to
a bed, Mirren still manages to steal the film with a polished
performance.  She delivers her acerbic one-liners and venomous put
downs with a relish that comprehensively outshines her adolescent
co-stars.</P>
<P>Williamson has cast '80's icon Molly Ringwald (a veteran of
John Hughes early comedies like The Breakfast Club, etc) in a small
role as the school assistant who briefly takes over Mrs Tingle's class
and becomes something of a hero to her students with her irreverent
interpretation of historical events.</P>
<P>Originally entitled Killing Mrs Tingle, the film underwent a
name change following the last high school massacre in the States to
the more inoffensive Teaching Mrs Tingle.  Under any title this is
still a rather tired blend of black comedy, horror and typical
adolescent high school drama that will only appeal to undemanding
teens.</P>
