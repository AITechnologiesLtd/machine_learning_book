<P>The third computer generated animated film from Pixar, "Toy Story 2" can be 
regarded with ease as one of those very rare sequels that actually improves 
upon its predecessor. Watching the original, in its entirety, for the first 
time since its theatrical release in November of 1995, and then going to see 
the sequel two hours later, it is abundantly clear that "Toy Story 2" is 
richer and more awe-inspiring in the animation department, has a stronger, 
appreciatively non-preachy message to make about the act of growing up, and, 
most importantly, is at least twice as imaginative. Sure, there are a 
sampling of corny jokes (as in the first one) to satisfy the children in the 
audience, but also like the original, it is a film that has a snappy pace, 
clever writing, and is condescending to neither kids nor adult viewers. Those 
attributes are, at least, something I doubt you could find in the new 
"Pokemon" movie. </P>
<P>Picking up a couple years after its precursor, this immensely entertaining 
sequel reintroduces all of the old toys that are owned by the young boy named 
Andy, most notably Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), a cowboy, and Buzz Lightyear 
(Tim Allen), a space explorer. Now all friends, the gang of toys, which also 
include Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky the Dog (Jim Varney), Hamm the 
Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger) and Rex the Dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), find 
their worst fear come true when, through a chain of unfortunate events, Woody 
is stolen at a yard sale by spiteful toy owner Al (Wayne Knight). While Buzz 
Lightyear and a select few of the other toys set out to rescue Woody, Woody 
himself discovers why Al wanted him so badly: he unknowingly used to be the 
star of a popular television show, and is the one missing character in the 
collection. Meeting and becoming quick friends with the other toys from the 
show, cowgirl and confidante Jessie (Joan Cusack), a horse named Bullseye, 
and the old paternal figure called The Prospector (Kelsey Grammer), Woody 
begins to have second thoughts about going back to Andy because he believes 
he might have finally found his rightful place in the world of toys.  </P>
<P>What is so utterly delightful about "Toy Story 2" is that it never once 
rehashes the original, instead consistently coming up with sensationally 
innovative new ideas and branching the story off into many enlivening 
directions. Due to this, it dodges the usual fate of becoming an unnecessary 
sequel because, for once, Walt Disney Pictures does not seem to be aiming for 
a quick buck, as they have patently directed all of their efforts into making 
an exemplary continuation of a recent beloved family film.</P>
<P>While the 1995 picture grew a little frustrating because of the majority of 
the action taking place in bedrooms, "Toy Story 2" is akin to the also 
superior 1993 sequel "Addams Family Values," in that it takes the characters 
into a much-needed outside setting. Opening in Andy's bedroom, then going 
into the city, through a toy store, and culminating at an airport (with pit 
stops in between), the film is a grand achievement and another step forward 
in the world of animation, appearing more sharp and detailed than even 
Pixar's last film, 1998's "A Bug's Life." Never short of being colorful and 
visually extravagant, certain shots are so very impressive that they almost 
look like live-action, while the human characters also appear slightly more 
real than their artificial representations in the original.</P>
<P>Staying true to the memorable toy characters he previously created, director 
John Lasseter does not try to miraculously alter the personalities of Woody, 
Buzz, or the rest of the ensemble, but simply continues their evolvement as 
regular people. By doing this, Lasseter also has introduced several fresh 
characters, including Mrs. Potato Head, The Prospector, Bullseye, Tour Guide 
Barbie, and the most effective, Jessie. Marvelously voiced by Joan Cusack, 
Jessie is one of the most well-written and realistically portrayed modern 
animated characters in some time. In an unusually touching and meaningful 
flashback for a family movie, we watch how Jessie's life has lead up to this 
moment. She used to have an owner, a loving girl who was her best friend, but 
as the years went by, the girl turned into a young woman, the places where 
her toys used to be changed into posters and make-up, Jessie stopped being 
played with, and finally, ended up being thrown away. "You never forget your 
owner," Jessie tearfully says, "but they forget you." This line is so 
powerful and stirring because it is completely true, and even if toys aren't 
actually alive in real life, its connotation remains wholeheartedly valid.</P>
<P>For every minor instance where something doesn't work (in a throwaway ode to 
the first "Star Wars" trilogy, Buzz Lightyear discovers his arch nemesis, 
Zurg, is actually his father), there are no less than twenty other things 
that do. The climax, for example, is ingeniously set at a busy airport, and 
stands as one of the most exciting action set-pieces this whole year. Joyous 
and lighthearted, "Toy Story 2" is ideal family entertainment, and the most 
satisfying Disney movie since 1991's "Beauty and the Beast." </P>
