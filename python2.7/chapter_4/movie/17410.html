<P>SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: * (out of ****)
20th Century Fox / 1:36 / 1999 / PG-13 (language, sexual suggestiveness)
Cast: Sarah Michelle Gellar; Sean Patrick Flanery; Patricia Clarkson; 
Dylan Baker; Betty Buckley; Larry Gillard Jr. 
Director: Mark Tarlov 
Screenplay: Judith Roberts <HR>TV's Buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum 
in "Simply Irresistible." Sarah Michelle Gellar, that never-ceasing 
crusader against never-ending evil every Tuesday night on the WB 
network, here plays a down-on-her-luck chef suspected of dabbling in 
witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of 
magically scrumptious meals. Taste test results: Some vampire slaying, 
though out of place, would have really livened this excruciating movie 
up. "Simply Irresistible" is actually quite easy to deny, a disaster of 
culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on. </P>
<P>Gellar's Amanda finds herself falling for harried Henri Bendel exec Tom 
(Sean Patrick Flannery of Powder) around the same time she discovers an 
uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking, a secret 
ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the public's in her 
tiny TriBeCa eatery. All this love and sorcery have a lot to do with the 
telekinetic crab that also figures into the story, a tale that at times 
plays like an American spin on 1993's Mexican classic "Like Water for 
Chocolate." Several differences: One, "Like Water" didn't have a 
telekinetic crab, and two, "Like Water" was a good film. </P>
<P>"Simply Irresistible," on the other hand, is about as challenging as an 
Easy-Bake Oven. Amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in 
their badness, from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog 
to an impromptu dance sequence where Tom and Amanda do their best Fred 
and Ginger - though Fred and Ginger never took part in anything this 
garish. The intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at 
regular intervals, but it's not like you're were going to miss much. In 
fact, take away the few instances of salty language and this has 
made-for-Disney Channel written all over it. </P>
<P>But a majority of "Simply Irresistible"'s resistibility factor has less 
to do with the afore-mentioned overkill than the bland leads - Tom and 
Amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that there's just no fun 
rooting for their inevitable "happily ever after." Nor do the 
otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense, so 
we're left with a ho-hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs; it's 
not going to last long, people. Perhaps sensing this, the filmmakers 
have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like Betty 
Buckley, Dylan Baker and Patricia Clarkson, but they don't go anywhere 
either. </P>
<P>In fact, nothing in "Simply Irresistible" goes anywhere save for Gellar, 
and she doesn't go somewhere so much as you wish she'd go _somewhere_ - 
like to a better movie. Already proving major talent with relatively few 
big- and small-screen roles, she's the sole reason this overcooked 
souffle isn't completely fit for the garbage disposal, looking smashing 
in her Todd Oldham-designed duds and investing much more in her 
perfunctory part than she ever gets in return. It's certainly a dish 
best not served in it's current condition, but one can only guess that, 
without Gellar, "Simply Irresistible" would be strictly unwatchable.<HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck

"She doubles up in pain. Her body is wracked by great cataclysmic sobs. 
Her two friends weep in sympathy, the three of them wailing and 
gnashing. So great is their grief that mere words cannot encompass it, 
and they sink to the ultimate form of lamentation: They clean house. 
Bitter salt tears course down their cheeks as they Ajax the bathtub and 
Bab-O the pots and pans, while the audience collapses in disbelieving 
laughter." -Roger Ebert on "Let's Talk About Sex"</P>
