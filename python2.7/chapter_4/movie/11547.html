<PRE>"The Man in the Iron Mask" - The Sword is Mightier than the Pen
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>TMITIM does a couple of smart things to ensure that potential
movie-goers will at least think about seeing this film.  First, it's a
story that soothes us with the familiarity of Aramis, Athos, Porthos
and D'artagnan - the legendary four Musketeers.  Little introduction
is needed about these men, and we can quickly jump into the story.
Louis XIII, the great King whose throne the Musketeers served, has
died and has now been succeeded by his arrogant and cruel heir, Louis
XIV (Leonardo DiCaprio).  The original three Musketeers have now
retired from service and now live relatively quiet lives. D'artagnan,
still an active Musketeer, is now Captain of the young king's
bodyguards.  </P>
<P>Louis XIV is not a well-liked King.  His selfish actions result in
deep resentment by the people.  He is the target of numerous
assassination attempts.  He is also greatly disliked by the retired
Musketeers, who believe that this is a leader truly unworthy of a
Musketeer's devotion.  However, their ire for the king puts them at
odds with D'artagnan, who has sworn an oath to protect the king with
his life.  Nonetheless, the original three know that France will never
prosper unless a change is made.  A bold plan is devised, and it's
success rests on the Man in the Iron Mask, a mysterious figure that
was imprisoned years ago and almost forgotten.  The three Musketeers
must first devise a way to free him and then execute their plan.  If
they succeed, they could alter the future of France.  But, their
biggest obstacle is D'artagnan.</P>
<P>The other attractive element is that the film puts together an
all-star ensemble.  Co-starring Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gerard
Depardieu, and Gabriel Byrne as the Musketeers, it has tremendous
international star power and mass appeal.  </P>
<P>Yet, despite all these positive points, the story never comes close to
reaching the legendary status of the Musketeers.  One thing that was
unsettling was listening to the actors lines.  At times, they spoke
using the 'Dialect of Infinite Wisdom' (where one speaks so slowly as
if to simulate awesome intelligence), which was void of any conviction
or passion.  At other times, the banter was so tongue-in-cheek that it
seemed to purposely anchor itself in swashbuckling commercialism
rather than dramatic greatness.  Still, at other times, the dialogue
seemed so forced that actors looked like they were straining not to
look or sound foolish.  Additionally, there were some extraneous
subplots and some totally off-the-wall surprises that made me slap my
forehead or cock an eyebrow.</P>
<P>Written by Randall Wallace, the same person that wrote "Braveheart", I
really expected a powerful drama that would explore the rift between
D'artagnan and the Musketeers; the motivating nature behind the young
king; or even the possibilities that present itself when an impostor
with ambitions of sheep-tending assumes the almighty throne.  Yet it
seemed content on just being an action-adventure film about old heroes
that reunite to bring back an era that had been forgotten.  </P>
<P>I felt that a potentially great film was squandered.  TMITIM is an
uneven production that was glorious at some points but unfocused at
others.  I did, however, enjoy Gabriel Byrnes as D'artagnan, who
desparately tried to find a balance between his oath to the king and
his ability to live up to the code of the Musketeers.  And the
climactic ending is a rousing finish that shows how good this film
could have been.  But for much of this film, we needed a  fifth
Musketeer.  His name could have been Pathos!</P>
