 Writer:   Atom Egoyan from a novel by William Trevor

<P>   The terrible price that individuals from dysfunctional
families must sometimes pay has been a favorite topic of
playwrights and other writers since the Greeks.  Clytemnestra
kills her husband for coming home with a fortune teller. 
Medea murders her two children to punish her straying
husband.  Hamlet kills his uncle for the murder of Hamlet's
father.  In more recent times, Sam Mendes electrified the film
world with "American Beauty," about the ultimate price that
Lester Burnham pays soon after his loins are inflamed by a
high-school cheerleader.  But few contemporary films delve
into the depths of loneliness and despair as sincerely as
"Felicia's Journey."  The movie centers on an otherwise
gentle, unremarkable person whose conflicted relationship
with his mother turns him into a serial killer.  </P>
<P>   "Felicia's Journey," an adaptation of William Trevor's quiet
thriller of the same name, is the story of an association
between two people who are of different ages and from
diverse backgrounds but who share a pattern of self-delusion
that drives each of them to obsessive behavior.  For the
younger of the pair, the fixation is painful to bear, like the
anguish felt by a betrayed lover in Victor Hugo's "The Story
of Adele H."  For the more mature individual, the lifelong
yearning for connection leads to serial murder, to a
progression of crimes of which the killer has no memory.  </P>
<P>   The titled Felicia of the story has taken a journey from a
remote village in Ireland's County Cork to the highly
industrialized English city of Birmingham.  More important is
her psychological excursion, from the naivete of a guileless
young woman to a person who becomes aware of the ways
of the world and reconciles herself to the reality.  Joseph
Ambrose Hilditch, a catering manager in a large Birmingham
factory, takes a similar journey of self-realization, and while
his outcome is not as sunny, he is at last able to come to
terms with his true nature.</P>
<P>   The film is written and directed by the remarkable Atom
Egoyan.  Egoyan set the movie-mavens' world on fire two
seasons ago with "The Sweet Hereafter," about a tenacious
lawyer who travels to a remote Canadian village trying to sign
up the survivors of a terrible bus accident which took the lives
of many children.  Like that elliptical tale with its many
flashbacks and dream-like sequences, "Felicia's Journey"
takes a patient, methodical approach, with frequent closeups
to the faces of the two principals evoking the complex, mostly
confused, emotions that they feel. Essentially a two-character
story, the movie never has the claustrophobic feel of a filmed
play because Egoyan leaves his native Canada for the first
time to cast his camera's lens across the expansive greenery
of rural Ireland, which he contrasts with the smoldering
smokestacks and the ominous nuclear power plant of a
nightmarishly industrialized Midlands city.  Similarly, he
displays the bustle of everyday life as seen by one character
and suddenly swaps scenes to portray the commotion in the
life of the other.  </P>
<P>   Until we become aware of the monster that inhabits the
soul of Joseph Hilditch (Bob Hoskins), we cannot help liking
him.  He's a roly-poly man, a catering manager in a large
food factory who is not only well-liked by his employees but
highly respected for his opinions about the food which they
prepare.  Their affection for him is not difficult to understand:
in one scene he gently chastises a man who is trying to sell
him a machine that can do everything that a series of cooks
now perform, but Hilditch would not think of firing human
beings, whose preparation of food is an act of love to the
diners.  Hilditch lives in a large house by himself, preparing
his own dinners under the videotaped instruction of a TV
chef, Gala (Arsinee Khanjian), who we learn is his mother--
whose 1950s programs now exist in the extensive library of
tapes that Hilditch maintains along with far more sinister
videos.</P>
<P>   His loneliness comes to a temporary halt when he runs into
a similarly forsaken person, the young Felicia (Elaine
Cassidy), who has been seduced and impregnated by a
young man, Johnny (Peter McDonald), and whom she now
seeks in Birmingham.  Since he did not leave her his
address, she depends on the kindness of the strange Hilditch
to help her find the boy, and the connection that Hilditch and
Felicia enjoy temporarily lifts both from their misery.  Egoyan
takes us all on a psychological journey involving two lost
souls, an excursion which is wholly original, thought-
provoking, involving, and searing.  </P>
<P>   If Atom Egoyan lucked out two years ago by employing two
greater actors--Ian Holm and Sarah Polley to depict two
haunted individuals--his good fortune continues this time
around as well.  Bob Hoskins, turning in the achievement of
his career, portrays a tormented man so subtly, so bereft of
obvious Hollywood-style melodrama, that our hearts go out to
him while we are simultaneously repulsed by the sick acts
that his diseased soul compels him to perform.  His Hilditch
becomes the person we all know from work, from school,
from right next-door: the kindly, unobtrusive, considerate
person who we'd swear could not hurt a fly.  His pairing with
Elaine Cassidy as the lovesick girl frantically searching for the
boy who lied to her is surely as recognizable to each of us. 
Gullible, impressed by a guy's convincing line, she has no
memory of the hundreds of similar women whose lives have
been portrayed in novels and films, women who have been
tricked by rogues with one thing on their minds.  Her not
quite typically Irish features display a bevy of emotions--her
expressions of shyness, trust, confusion, and anger as easy
to read as a road map of midtown Manhattan.  Egoyan's
supporting cast add considerable depth and credibility to the
tale, particularly Felicia's dour dad who rejects his daughter
as a whore who has slept with the enemy and Hilditch's
cheery mom who is not ashamed to embarrass her boy and
show affection equally while they share a TV screen but who
treats him like excess baggage when off the stage.</P>
<P>   If commercial American filmmakers got their hands on this
piece of work and tried to fashion it into an American-style
thriller, the picture would be corrupted so extensively that it
would become another been-there-done-that.  In its present
form, "Felicia's Journey" not only might convince you that the
Canadian filmmakers can do no wrong but could give you
faith that vital movies are indeed possible without the
distorting endowment of Hollywood's hand.  "Felicia's
Journey" was appropriately selected as the closing work of
the 1999 New York Film Festival.</P>
