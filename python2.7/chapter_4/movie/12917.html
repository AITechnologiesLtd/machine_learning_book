<P>GODZILLA
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: **1/2 (out of ****) 
TriStar / 2:19 / 1998 / PG-13 (language, violence)
Cast: Matthew Broderick; Jean Reno; Maria Pitillo; Hank Azaria; Kevin 
Dunn; Michael Lerner; Harry Shearer; Arabella Field; Vicki Lewis; Doug 
Savant 
Director: Roland Emmerich 
Screenplay: Dean Devlin; Roland Emmerich<HR>As movies featuring gigantic lizards go, "Godzilla" is no "Jurassic 
Park." Heck, it's not even "The Lost World," although this tale of an 
atomic iguana loose in New York City is going to seem to some like a 
very extended version of "World"'s dinosaur-in-San Diego capper, only on 
a much larger scale as far as the monster and demolition are concerned. 
Despite its inescapable "Size Does Matter" promotional campaign, 
"Godzilla" proves that bigger isn't always better. Cool-looking
creatures in all of their computer-generated glory really can be 
overshadowed when you're missing the best special effect of all -- a 
strong screenplay with interesting characters. But, although "Godzilla" 
is a pretty flat summer movie in the end, it's at least a moderately 
entertaining one that courts success more often than disaster. </P>
<P>"Godzilla"'s creative team is that of director/co-writer Roland Emmerich 
and producer/co-writer Dean Devlin, the duo who gave us "Independence 
Day" only two years ago. I was in the small clique of those who did not 
appreciate that film (I hated it, actually), having felt that its every 
aspect was blatantly forced -- a cardboard cast of stereotyped 
personalities use a jingoistic tone to cover up a story that refuses to 
admit how infuriatingly silly it is. "Godzilla," while oh so very far 
from being a good movie, is much more grounded than "ID4"; it only 
momentarily masquerades as something it isn't. Sure, both films offer 
ineffective, one-dimensional characterization (though, judging from 
"Godzilla"'s press notes, the filmmakers would argue otherwise), but 
mostly gone here is the clunky, laughable human drama and conflict that, 
for me, sank "ID4" to a surprising low.</P>
<P>A plot summary is largely superfluous, but I shall proceed for those few 
of you who want to know what kind of narrative thrust this baby has. 
Matthew Broderick plays Nick Tatopoulos, a biological scientist studying 
the nuclear radiation-induced mutations of creatures great and small, 
the latter being earthworms and the former a mysterious creature that's 
swimming from Polynesia to the United States, and leaving all kinds of 
havoc in its wake. This entity, of course, turns out to be the titular 
behemoth, and Nick is hot on its trail when it decides to crash -- 
literally and figuratively -- in the Big Apple. The military, having 
never before faced such a deadly adversary, isn't very helpful. 
Complicating matters further is the presence of Nick's ex-flame, plucky 
local TV journalist Audrey (Maria Pitillo), but the last thing a movie 
like this needs is a rekindled-romance subplot. </P>
<P>To be fair, however, the Nick-Audrey relationship is no less silly than 
the Jeff Goldblum-Margaret Colin one in "Independence Day"; "Godzilla"'s 
"love story" is less a glaring flaw than a minor distraction. So, 
instead of copying its predecessor's flaws to a T, it invents some new 
ones. Devlin and Emmerich play down the malevolence and up the sympathy 
in "Godzilla," so much to the point where one really wonders if the king 
of all monsters can truly be called an antagonist. Gone is the sense of 
deliberate, careless destruction that characterize this movie's Japanese 
ancestors; by "humanizing" the beast, we're torn when it comes time to 
root for somebody -- or against something. Also sorely missed is the 
sense of fascination, wonder and pseudo-credibility that Steven 
Spielberg used to distinguish his "Jurassic Park," a film that 
"Godzilla" will be inevitably compared to, from just another ride. </P>
<P>Yet some strong key assets keep "Godzilla" far from being a total 
downer. The special effects (the unarguable reason that this film was 
made) are fantastic, and the movie's look -- especially in the 
helicopter chase scenes -- often works on a Tim Burton-level of dazzle. 
Some of Emmerich's action sequences, like the climactic cab ride, offer 
sudden, genuine bursts of excitement. "Godzilla" even has a notable 
sense of humor (mostly courtesy of comic co-star Hank Azaria), save for 
one running joke that's funny at first but gets old fast. The gag in 
question pokes fun at film critic deities Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, 
allegedly because Devlin and Emmerich are not too happy about the 
negative write-ups they gave "StarGate" and "ID4." The best way to get 
revenge against reviewers for disliking your previous movies isn't to 
gibe them in your current work, guys -- it's to make sure that current 
work is a great film.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"Suggestions, please, for the fourth movie in the series. How about 
'Look Who's Talking Back,' in which the audience gets its turn?" --
