<PRE>                     PSYCHO (1998) ** (out of four)
                       -a review by Bill Chambers
              ('Tis the season to visit FILM FREAK CENTRAL:
       <A HREF="http://filmfreakcentral.net">http://filmfreakcentral.net</A>  Or my name isn't Santa Claus.)</PRE>
<PRE>   starring Anne Heche, Vince Vaughan, Viggo Mortensen, Julianne Moore
                      screenplay by Joseph Stefano
                        directed by Gus Van Sant</PRE>
<P>Were Alfred Hitchcock alive today, he probably wouldn't give half the
damn that Psycho 1998's detractors do-I'll bet that he would simply wish
Van Sant "good luck" and turn the other cheek. In fact, the new film is
unlikely to continue to drum up controversy; my guess is that within
weeks it will have all but vanished from cinemas and moviegoers' memory
banks, mostly because Van Sant has given a sixties movie a modern spin,
yet succeeded in taking the edge off the original.</P>
<P>Must I recount the tale of Norman Bates and his mum? Phoenix, Arizona
receptionist Marion Crane (Heche) steals a bunch of money ($400 000 this
time around) from her real estate company, with the intention of running
off with her lover, Sam Loomis (Mortensen). She stops at the Bates Motel
for a good night's sleep along the way to California, where she shares
sandwiches, milk, and stitled conversation with the taxidermist owner,
Norman Bates (Vaughan), a mama's boy if there ever was one. Later,
Marion is murdered in the shower by Mrs. Bates; her body, her car, and
her personal belongings-including the loot-are disposed of in a nearby
swamp by fearful Norman. An investigation ensues: Detective Arbogast
(William H. Macy), and amateur sleuths Loomis and Lila (Moore), Marion's
sister, attempt to uncover the truth behind Marion's disappearance.</P>
<P>Van Sant's version is basically a recreation of the original, with the
exception of a few wrongheaded additions (do we really need those added
flashcuts of storm clouds and human atrocities during the murder
sequences?). What struck me most about Psycho 1998 was how the
replicated pacing-a perfect tempo for the original-seemed too damn
sluggish for today's viewers: audience members were dropping off to
sleep all around me. (Perhaps that does defend Van Sant's MTV-style
killings, after all.) Psycho's screenplay remains brilliant-the stolen
money having no ultimate significance to the story was of course
Hitchcock's greatest red herring, but Heche is not nearly the big star
Janet Leigh was in 1960: even virgins to the tale will not be fazed by
her demise halfway through the film, as she's just one member of a cast
of solid but not popular actors. The current shower scene lacks its
predecessor's sense of pulp, mischief and kink. (Aside: for whatever
reason, the psycho-babble epilogue is more palpable this time around.
Another aside: Danny Elfman's reorchestration of Bernard Hermann's score
sounds great in digital sound.)</P>
<P>How are the performances? Occasionally, the dated dialogue sounds a
little silly coming out of their mouths. (If Van Sant went so far as to
update Hitch's vision by shooting in colour, why not extensively revise
the script, too?) The most successful at reinventing his role is Macy as
Arbogast, whose previous work with David Mamet positively affects his
delivery-whenever Macy is on screen, it's impossible to turn your head.
Heche, Mortensen, and Moore are just fine, but they seem to be dying to
improvise and ad-lib. The movie is such a rigid remake it barely allows
them breathing space.</P>
<P>With only a few puckers of his bee-stung lips and the occasional
narrowing of his fashion model eyes, Vaughan comes off as much more
sinister (not to mention physically imposing) than Anthony Perkins'
Bates-ultimately, Vaughan fails to convince us his psychotic behaviour
isn't premeditated. An impish Van Sant can be glimpsed through the
window of the real estate office in scene two, and I couldn't help but
think he should've played the title character: he bares a resemblance to
Perkins and obviously has a deeper affinity for the material than
Vaughan.</P>
<P>Ultimately, what disappointed me most about this Psycho was its
softness. Why is Marion lolling around in bed with her naked lover
wearing a bra and panties? Why the use of such obvious visual metaphors
as storm clouds? Is this same director responsible for Drugstore Cowboy
and the envelope-pushing My Own Private Idaho? I can't help but think of
the moment in Psycho 1998 when Moore is startled by her own reflection
on a giant mirror. It's as if Van Sant was too busy looking at
Hitchcock's movie and too frightened to explore the truly personal
aspects of the yarn, rendering this recreation functional but pointless.</P>
