<PRE>HANGING UP</PRE>
<P> Reviewed by Harvey Karten
 Columbia Pictures
 Director:  Diane Keaton
 Writer:  Delia Ephron & Nora Ephron, novel by Nora Ephron
 Cast: Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton, Lisa Kudrow, Walter
Matthau, Adam Arkin, Cloris Leachman</P>
<P>   The three sisters in Nora Ephron's novel are nothing like
their counterparts in Chekhov's story.  Unlike Olga, Masha
and Irina, they are not bored, provincial women longing to go
to the big city where they can find the excitement so sadly
lacking in their lives. These L.A. gals have already arrived:
one of the in particular is up to her turned-up nose in activity,
another perpetually distracted by attention as the head of a
terminally hip, successful magazine, and the third  is a TV
soap-opera performer in one of those hospital serials.  If
"Hanging Up" is inspired by any classic, it would take a page
from Shakespeare's "King Lear," about the relationship
between an over-the-hill monarch and his three
daughters--only one of whom exhausts herself to do right by
her dad and is largely unappreciated.  But if this picture,
directed by Diane Keaton, takes a page or two from "Lear," it
takes just a title from another of the Bard's plays: "Much Ado
About Nothing."  Almost torture to sit through its one hundred
minutes of banal chatter and counterfeit crises, "Hanging Up"
makes us long for the pleasant-enough fluff of Nora Ephron's
"You've Got Mail" to supplant the repetitious scenes of
cranky-old-dad-shows-ingratitude-to-loving-daughter.  </P>
<P>   The production notes reveal that when novelist Delia
Ephron's father got sick, she was the only one of her family
in L.A. and was on the phone constantly with her sisters
about him--and on the phone as well with her father.  "I live
half my life in the real world and half on the telephone"
became the statement around which the novel, and now the
movie, revolve.  </P>
<P>   If you've ever been baffled to see the intensity with which
people use their cell phones--while walking on the street, in
restaurants, shopping at the supermarket, and even to the
extreme annoyance of their neighbors in the Broadway
theater--you can sense the addiction that the three women
and one elderly man in this story possess.  Since the three
women are what we would today call smart, they are highly
verbal, spending a good deal of their energy both at work and
at leisure vocalizing in person or especially on the
phone.  The trouble is that while the daily conversations of
these people must be awfully absorbing to them, they have
little interest for the audience, who must sit through the
endless banter and decide that eavesdropping on these
people is about as interesting as listening in to a woman at
the greengrocer interrogating her husband via her cellphone
about what he would like her to pick up for their dinner.  </P>
<P>   Meg Ryan takes center stage in the comedy-drama which
is light on laughs and oddly dry-eyed in its pathos.  As the
owner of a business that coordinates conventions--such as
the one depicted in the Nixon library--she has a difficult time
balancing home, work, and extended family.  With a bratty
12-year-old kid, Jesse (Jesse James), who laughs at his
mother with a donkey's bray, a handsome husband who has
little to do in this story but throw his father-in-law out of their
home, and a curmudgeonly father who is hospitalized and
supposedly dying (though we haven't the foggiest idea of
what), this middle sister is a modern representative of the
liberated woman who tries to have it all.  Her dad, Lou
(Walter Matthau), rewards her constant attention by telling
her that her mother wanted to "throw her back" after she was
born.  Eve must put up with her dad's adolescent attempts at
humor while he is being wheeled about, jokes about John
Wayne's allegedly small pecker ("that's why he carried those
guns"), about the location of the mini-bar in his hospital room,
about how he might go to bed "but not with you" (to a middle-
aged nurse).  Supposedly Lou went nuts when his wife, Pat
(Cloris Leachman), walked out on him ten years earlier, but
given the story's lack of development, we don't know whether
she left because he was looney or whether he became
unbalanced because she left.  Matthau wears yet another of
his outrageous rugs for the role, while cameraman Howard
Atherton hones in on his face to highlight the man's wrinkles.</P>
<P>   The frequent flashbacks to happier, more carefree times in
this family are generic and unenlightening.  When Georgia
(Diane Keaton), the oldest and most successful and much
envied sister, gives a talk before a roomful of adoring women,
we don't know whether Ephron means to satirize the currently
fashionable Cosmopolitan-type periodicals or to praise them. 
Nor do attempts work at parodying Nixon about tapes in his
library available for the visitor to click into to find what the ex-
president considered his favorite food and other important
issues.  We're left with a troupe of experienced, fine actors
bereft of anything of significance to say, but they're the last to
know this as they jabber and banter and jest and rail at one
another.  Too bad the Ephrons do not display half the talent
of Arthur Miller who knew how to write a story about siblings
who were not so concerned with hanging up as they were
with their own hangups.  In Miller's "The Price"--currently in a
Broadway revival--two brothers who get together after
disposing of their late father's belongings, deal with their
jealousy, their hatred, their corrosive and unacknowledged
anger, and their resentment against a selfish, child-devouring
father.  The first is a policeman who sacrificed his education
and probably career as a scientist to care for his invalid
father.  The other is an eminent surgeon who walked out on
the demands of family to concentrate on his personal
ambition.  This work, unlike "Hanging Up," examines the
dilemma with compassion, humor and insight--all of which are
missing from this movie.</P>
<P>   Look inside any high-school classroom during homeroom
period and observe which kids are doing the most jabbering. 
It's the dull ones.  They say that empty vessels make the
most noise.  The vessels in "Hanging Up" are particularly
sharp women: ironically, they make quite a bit of noise both
on the phone and in person and yet they say nothing--as
empty as the underwritten script in this meandering movie. 
Pick up the video some months from now and tune into it
next time you're sleepless in Seattle.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 100 minutes.  (C) 2000
