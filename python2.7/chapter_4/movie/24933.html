<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>When a movie targeted at children tries to appeal to adults, it usually 
does so by offering an additional, more mature level of dialogue and
humor: material which will go unnoticed by the younger set but
will be appreciated by the grown-ups. There is some of this in "Dinosaur",
but not a lot. Instead, what will entertain the adults is pretty much
exactly what will entertain the kids: a visually spectacular production
which takes the art of computer animation to a whole new level.</P>
<P>I first became aware of the possibilities of computer graphics when I saw 
"Jurassic Park". I can still remember the thrill I felt at actually being 
able to watch dinosaurs walk, eat, attack, and interact with one another.
And while "Jurassic Park" is still pretty impressive -- certainly, seven 
years on it has not dated badly at all -- on a technical level, it has
been altogether surpassed by "Dinosaur". For here not only do we see the
reptiles as more of a presence in their environment than ever before, but
we are witness to a tremendous variety of the creatures, all acting as
though they were real, individual beings. One of the most incredible shots
in the whole picture sees the camera pan up over a rise to show a massive
caravan of dinosaurs, dozens of them representing many different species,
all galloping off into the distance.</P>
<P>And the success of "Dinosaur" lies not just in these bold, epic scenes 
but also in the details. Check out the way the wind blows realistically 
through the hair of the lemurs, for example, or how the sand breaks under 
the feet of the heavier dinosaurs. Granted, the animation is not perfect: 
the dinosaurs feel entirely too textured and clean, and many of the faces 
(especially the lemurs) still bear a hint of their cartoon ancestry. But 
these are minor gripes; "Dinosaur" is the sort of movie you can just sit 
back and watch for an hour and a half, and let your eyes feast.</P>
<P>Of course, there's a story too, although it's a relatively simple one. 
Aladar (DB Sweeney) is a dinosaur who has been raised by a family of 
lemurs after his stolen egg was dropped into their midst by a flying
creature one day. (Realistically, mammals were nowhere close to this level
of evolution prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs, but in this case
the science gaffe is forgivable, with the lemurs acting as more
accessible audience identification figure than most of the dinosaurs.)
Aladar leads a happy, if somewhat lonely, life with the lemurs on their
verdant island for many years.</P>
<P>Then one evening, a violent meteor shower rains down upon the land,
forcing Aladar to flee the island with as many of his family as he can
carry. (This sequence is a wonderful example of mixing beauty and horror;
the storm is initially very beautiful, burning across a purple evening
sky, and very gradually builds in intensity and fury.) The survivors
include misfit "love monkey" Zini (Max Casella), young Suri (Hayden
Panettiere), Aladar's "mother" Plio (Alfre Woodard), and lemur patriarch
Yar (Ossie Davis). Swimming to the mainland, Aladar and friends discover
it to be a burnt, barren wasteland in the aftermath of the meteor storm.
(It's not made clear if this shower is intended to be the one which would
eventually lead to the extinction of the dinosaurs.)</P>
<P>They soon come upon a huge pack of dinosaurs in search of the fabled
Nesting Grounds, a secluded valley paradise. The dinosaurs are led by the
draconian Kron (Samuel E Wright), whose sister Neera ("ER"'s Julianna
Margulies) quickly attracts Aladar's eye. Kron adheres strictly to the
law of the survival of the fittest, and is perfectly happy to let the
older dinosaurs, such as Aladar's new friends Eema (Della Reese) and
Baylene (Joan Plowright), perish if it means stronger, younger pack
members will live. The dinosaurs soon find themselves crossing a long
stretch of arid desert a la "Lawrence of Arabia", with the terrifying,
fang-mawed carnotaurs at their backs and only the faintest promise of
reaching the Nesting Grounds ahead.</P>
<P>"Dinosaur" is well-written, although the simplistic, straightforward 
script by John Harrison and Robert Nelson Jacobs leaves little doubt
about the intended audience. But there are some very amusing sequences
(after Zini's ill-considered attempt to get Neera to notice Aladar, she
quips, "That, children, is what we call a jerkosaurus"), and the story
proceeds at a reasonable pace which shouldn't allow tedium to set in for
adults or kids.</P>
<P>After an opening ten-minute sequence in which none of the animals actually
speak, it is initially rather jarring when the lemurs and Aladar begin
conversing. But this feeling of displacement quickly fades, and the
voicework is altogether competent. Much of the characterisation is fairly
shallow, however, so the artistes don't have a lot to do besides read
lines. Only Davis, as the gruff but lovable Yar, really stands out.</P>
<P>The movie benefits from some luxurious cinematography by David R
Hardberger and S Douglas Smith. Images of the sprawling grasslands and 
waves pounding the ocean cliffs are beautiful even without the presence of
the animated dinosaurs. Also helping to raise the bar is the glorious
score by James Newton Howard, which adds an epic feel to the events.</P>
<P>Most kids will enjoy "Dinosaur", and the content is generally quite 
appropriate. There are some nice lessons to be learned about the value of
teamwork and the importance of caring for the elderly, and the movie
doesn't get overly preachy. Parents of very young or sensitive children
should be warned that a handful of scenes are quite savage, however. The
destruction of the lemurs' island and the antics of the carnivorous
dinosaurs, like the ferocious carnotaurs, have the potential to be
nightmare fodder for some. For the most part, though, "Dinosaur" is a
rousing and delightful adventure, another success from the Disney stable
of animated films.</P>
