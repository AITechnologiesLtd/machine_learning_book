<P>     Since the release of JURASSIC PARK, Michael Crichton has become a 
Hollywood staple.  Rights to each new novel are quickly optioned, and 
the resulting film is on the market as soon as ILM can get the special 
effects done.  CONGO is the fourth adaptation of a Crichton novel in two 
years (following JURASSIC PARK, RISING SUN, and DISCLOSURE), all of 
which performed well at the box office.  Given its position in the 
summer blockbuster race, it's unclear how this latest picture will do, 
but one thing is certain:  this is easily the worst filmed version of 
anything penned by the prolific author. </P>
<P>     A group of scientists embark on a safari to the heart of the Congo.  
Included are Dr. Karen Ross (Laura Linney), an ex-CIA agent currently 
working for a huge communications corporation; Dr. Peter Elliot (Dylan 
Walsh), a primate expert; Herkermer Homolka (Tim Curry), a strange man 
with a bizarre Romanian accent; Monroe Kelly (Ernie Hudson), a guide who 
knows all the tricks and short cuts; and Amy, Dr. Elliot's prize student 
-- a female gorilla.  Each member of the expedition has a different 
reason for coming.  Dr. Ross is searching for her missing ex-fiance 
(Bruce Campbell) and the experimental laser gun he had in his possession 
when he disappeared.  Homolka is looking for the fabled city of Zinj, 
which hides the diamond mines of King Solomon.  And Dr. Elliot is trying 
to cure Amy's homesickness.  This party braves numerous dangers, 
including attempts to shoot down their air transportation, erupting 
volcanos, and attacks by a cluster of hungry hippos.  But none of this 
prepares them for their greatest challenge:  a troop of extremely 
vicious and unsociable killer apes that make King Kong look like the 
Jolly Green Giant. </P>
<P>     With CONGO, Paramount Pictures is probably hoping to duplicate the 
success of Universal's JURASSIC PARK.  It isn't going to happen.  
Gorillas, no matter how mean, don't hold nearly the same fascination as 
dinosaurs -- especially when they're really people dressed in ape suits.  
The tongue-in-cheek script by John Patrick Shanley (who wrote 
MOONSTRUCK) is inferior to the more straightforward Crichton/Koepp 
collaboration, and director Frank Marshall is no Steven Spielberg 
(despite having studied under him).  JURASSIC PARK is a solid thriller; 
CONGO is something distinctly less. </P>
<P>     In the first place, it's difficult to build tension with so many 
plot threads.  The first half of this film is overburdened with 
exposition -- but it's background that lacks character development.  
Ultimately, Amy has a more fully fleshed-out personality than her human 
companions, and she's a creation of Stan Winston's creature shop.  The 
whiz-bang climax, which features a lot of impressive visual effects and 
collapsing sets, is nicely-choreographed, but marred by adventure film 
cliches that get the heroes in and out of life-threatening jams.  With 
its deus ex machina ending, CONGO harkens back to typical B-type 
adventure flicks.  </P>
<P>     Laura Linney, doing her best Indiana Jones imitation, provides a 
too-rare strong female lead who never needs a helping hand from her 
various male cohorts.  In fact, there's no question that Dr. Ross is in 
charge.  The actress gives an able performance, and she still looks 
pretty good after trudging through all that underbrush.  Ernie Hudson is 
equally enjoyable to watch, and seems to be having some fun.  Tim Curry, 
saddled with an unfortunately silly accent, is his usual fatuous self, 
and Dylan Walsh (last seen as Paul Newman's son in NOBODY'S FOOL) fights 
a losing battle against being upstaged by Amy. </P>
<P>     CONGO's greatest asset is that it's the only pure monster movie/
adventure of the season, and, even obviously flawed as it is, it still 
fills a niche left vacant by the CRIMSON TIDEs, BRAVEHEARTs, and 
BATMANs.  The movie has its moments of high-energy excitement (all 
during the rushed second half), but they don't leave the audience as 
breathless as they should.  CONGO is basically a JURASSIC PARK/KING KONG 
wannabe that never quite makes the cut. </P>
