ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Jim Carrey is one of the most talented comic actors of our
time, but his reputation often suffered because of the
critics' snobbery. Carrey still suffers because of the huge
popularity of his early movies, especially comedies that
relied solely on his comedic talent and hardly anything
else, causing animosity among critics who demanded higher
standards of American film comedy. ACE VENTURA, 1994 hit
film by Tom Shadyac that turn Carrey into the mega-star is
one of those films that explain why some critics don't like
Carrey and why this actor didn't get his well- deserved
"Oscar".</P>
<P>The protagonist of this film, with screenplay co-written by
Shadyac, Carrey and Jack Bernstein, is Ace Ventura (played
by Carrey), private detective specialised in locating and
retrieving lost pets. His talents are spotted attention of
Miami Dolphins football team, whose owner hires him to find
team's mascot - dolphin named Snowflake. In his quest Carrey
is aided by Dolphins publicist Melissa Robinson (played by
Courtney Cox), while inimical police lieutenant Lois Eichorn
(played by Sean Young) thwarts his investigation. When
Dolphins star Dan Marino (played by himself) also
disappears, Ventura's investigation receives further
complications.</P>
<P>ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE is a film almost without the plot
but that doesn't discourage Carrey. Instead the lack of
meaningful story is seen as an opportunity for him to
display his great comedic talent, including almost
indescribable skills of physical comedy. Humour is often
bellow standards of good taste and definitely not suited for
children, especially in scenes that spoof CRYING GAME. All
supporting actors seem uncomfortable or disinterested for
their roles. However, as long as Carrey appears on screen
the film is truly hilarious, and since Carrey appears with
86 minutes, many of those shortcomings can be forgiven. At
least by those viewers who want nothing more than
light-hearted entertainment and comedic talent in its barest
essence.</P>
