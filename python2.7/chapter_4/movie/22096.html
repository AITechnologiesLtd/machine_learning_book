<P>Would you get into a car that you knew was going to be in a horrific
accident?  Unless you're a character from David Cronenberg's Crash, the
answer is probably no.  But in Jesus' Son, FH has no problem making this
decision.  Hitchhiking, he accepts a ride from a nice family in an
Oldsmobile, waits for the crash and, afterwards, hangs around at the
hospital long enough to hear the mother's sickening screams.</P>
<P>FH (Billy Crudup, Without Limits) obviously isn't your ordinary guy.
His name, an abbreviation for `F--- Head', was given to him because he
constantly screws things up, especially when he tries to help people.
But who is FH?  Is he an angel?  Is he really Jesus' son, or did he just
listen to Velvet Underground's Heroin too many times?  Perhaps he's just
a delusional junkie.  FH says that he knows everything before it happens
and even knows the names of each raindrop.  But it's hard to tell if he
can really peer into the future, or if the drugs are making him think he
can.</P>
<P>Jesus' Son follows the adventures of FH during his
drug-and-alcohol-hazed travels throughout the ‘70s.  Beginning in Iowa
City and culminating in an Arizona nursing home, FH staggers throughout
the country searching for everything, yet, at the same time, nothing in
particular.  He meets strange people, finds strange lines of work, and
continually crosses paths with a woman named Michelle (Samantha Morton,
Sweet & Lowdown) that FH feels is his soulmate.  The couple often gets
together for weekends of sex and drugs that dissolve into screaming
fights.</P>
<P>The surreal film seems to lack a cohesive plot, partially due to the
fact that it's based on a collection of short stories written by Denis
Johnson.  I'm not sure if the tales in Johnson's book are as unrelated
as they appear here (it was adapted by three novice screenwriters), but
the film isn't really presented in a way that emphasizes separate
stories, resulting in a jumble of characters that you expect to jump
back into the story but never do.  There are only three constants – FH,
Michelle and the drugs.</P>
<P>Eerily resembling Kurt Cobain in both appearance and lethargic demeanor,
Crudup delivers a fine follow-up to his underrated turn as Steve
Prefontaine in last year's widely overlooked film Without Limits.  His
FH, who also narrates the movie, has eyes that look haunted and lost,
yet totally aware and ominiscient, which almost convinces you that he
does have some type of special healing power.  But like any decent film
that revolves around drug use (Drugstore Cowboy, Rush), it's hard to
decipher what's real as FH's hallucinations blend seamlessly into
reality.  Hell, one time I hit my thumb with a hammer so hard that I
thought I saw a leprechaun.</P>
<P>Directed by Alison Maclean (Crush), Jesus' Son offers a ton of great
‘70s songs and some fine supporting roles (namely Denis Leary, Holly
Hunter, Will Patton and Jack Black).  But the finest part of the film is
perhaps the utterly believable appearance of FH and Michelle.  These two
are simply disgusting.  The only time either of them got anywhere near
soap is when FH nearly overdosed and Michelle dragged him into a cold
shower hoping to revive him.  You could almost smell the stench of body
odor in the theater (or maybe it was that guy next to me).</P>
<P>1:49 - R for graphic drug use, adult language, nudity and graphic
violence</P>
