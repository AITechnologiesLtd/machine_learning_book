<P> East Is East (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Om Puri, Linda Bassett,
Ian Aspinall, Jimi Mistry, Raji James, Emil Marwa, Chris Basson, Archie
Panjabi and Jordan Routledge. Directed by Damien O'Donnell. Written by
Ayub Khan Din. Music by Deborah Mollison. Rated R.</P>
<P> With a title borrowed from a line in a Rudyard Kipling poem, you are
aware beforehand that "East Is East" is going to be a story about a
clash of cultures.</P>
<P> And so it is. This 1999 British release is a mixture of comedy and
drama, set in the 1970s. The story revolves around the mixed-race Khan
family.</P>
<P> As the story opens, George Khan's eldest son, Nazir, has disgraced by
father by fleeing from his arranged marriage.</P>
<P> Undeterred, George continues to plow ahead and try to control the lives
of his six remaining children.</P>
<P> George, who came to England from Pakistan and married an English woman,
tries to run his family as if he were back in the old country.
But that type of patriarchal domination doesn't work in swingin'
England, and his children continually rebel as their lifestyle of discos
and bellbottoms clash with their father's idea of studying the Koran and
wearing traditional Pakistani garb.</P>
<P>"East is East" is an interesting movie. As portrayed by Om Puri, George
Khan is a character with whom you can empathize and scorn
simultaneously.</P>
<P> He is a bully, always yelling and cursing at his kids, demanding they
follow his precepts simply because he is the father and his word is law.
But he also is a lovable figure, only wanting the best for his
offspring.</P>
<P> He cannot understand them wanting to make life decisions on their own.
His attempts to turn his home and family into a little piece of Pakistan
are continually thwarted by his free-spirited offspring.</P>
<P> "East Is East," despite its cultural baggage, actually is very
universal in theme. Parents, especially those with teen-agers, will be
able to identify with George, while young viewers will certainly see
parts of themselves in the Khan clan, while recognizing traits of their
parents in George.</P>
<P> For those filmgoers who say they want more diversity in their movie
selections, "East Is East" fits the bill. At about 96 minutes, it is
charming in its own rugged way, a film you can appreciate as well as
enjoy.</P>
