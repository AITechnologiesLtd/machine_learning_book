<PRE>DANGEROUS BEAUTY
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Marshall Herskovitz directs this alternatively comic and earnestly
serious period piece based on the biography of a famous 16th century
poet/courtesan, Veronica Franco.</P>
<P>As a girl, Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) has only eyes for Marco
Venier (Rufus Sewell).  Yet fate schemes to keep them apart.  For, you
see, this is 16th century Venice, where marriage is a political tool,
and women are little more than property, their worthiness judged by
their dowry.  Marco comes from a high standing political family, and
Veronica, alas, is poor.</P>
<P>However, there is a way out for Veronica.  Her mother (Jacqueline
Bisset) gives her the option of becoming a high-class prostitute, a
courtesan, as she once was herself.  Although it may seem appalling at
first, the courtesan dwells amid luxury, freedom and riches.  And (the
point which wins Veronica over) courtesans are the only women in which
education is encouraged, since they are the confidants and bedtime
advisors of nobles and generals.</P>
<P>By taking this path, rather than following her friend, Beatrice (Moira
Kelly), into the sheltered life of an arranged marriage, Veronica hopes
to be Marco's lover, since she can't be his husband.  But will Marco be
accepting of the love of a courtesan?</P>
<P>Dangerous Beauty is at its best when it is lighthearted, a mood which
dominates most of the film.  However, there are moments, particularly in
the film's finale, when the film's tone shifts to one of deadly
seriousness. At such times, the dreadful self-importance threatens to
overwhelm the film.  Luckily, they don't make up the bulk of the film.
As long as you have an open mind about the film's subject matter, the
playful attitude of Dangerous Beauty wins out.</P>
<P>Catherine McCormack delivers a splendid performance as Veronica,
believably running the gamut from innocent to...not so innocent, with an
appropriate mix of inquisitiveness and longing. Though Rufus Sewell
turns in a decent performance as her would-be lover, Oliver Platt steals
the show as his penniless friend, Maffio, who engages Veronica in a
battle of wits, while he secretly longs for her.</P>
<P>The film faithfully recreates 16th century Venice, with some stunning
vistas along the canals.  The beautiful scenery helps to enhance the
atmosphere which made Venice one of the most decadent cities of its
time.</P>
<P>Dangerous Beauty is anything but the stuffy period drama a cursory look
might curse it to seem.  As a lighthearted and funny look (most of the
time) at 16th century mores, the movie is a delightful sweet to savor.</P>
