<PRE>"Romeo Must Die" (2000)</PRE>
<P>Starring Jet Li, Aaliyah, Isaiah Washington, Russell
Wong, DMX, and Delroy Lindo.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak  
Written by Eric Bernt, John Jarrell</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>For those expecting a clever masterpiece of an ancient
Shakespeare play, Romeo Must Die will not be
satisfying. The only real similarity is that both
contain rival gangs from rival families. That's it. In
this "adaptation" you won't find any monologues, any
romance, any dukes, nor, for that matter, any
characters named Romeo or Juliet. You will find a lot
of violence, rap music, curse words, and bad acting.
This is not necessarily a bad thing; the soundtrack
and beautifully choreographed fight scenes add a much
needed Matrix-like environment while the bad acting
reminds its viewers that this is a movie that doesn't
require much thought, just pointless eye-candied
entertainment. And when star Jet Li shows off his
impressive Martial Arts talent, the movie is extremely
fun. He is so graceful at his job that he makes
beating up huge gun-carrying gangsters look extremely
easy. 
The elaborate plot made simple follows Han (Jet Li) as
he escapes a Hong Kong prison to find out who killed
his brother. When Han reaches America, he finds that
two gangs, one African American the other, led by his
father, Chinese, are in the middle of a nasty battle.
As Han continues to search for the truth about his
brother, he meets Tricia (singer Aaliyah) the daughter
of the opposite gang's leader (Delroy Lindo). The two
find they have much in common while the gangs do all
they can to separate them. </P>
<P>The real problem with Romeo Must Die is that Li is
rarely given a chance to show off his skills. The film
is held down by a confusing subplot involving the NFL,
in which the two families try to profit off of the
league. Also there are way too many characters in this
movie. In a pleasing action movie, there should be
five main characters max: the hero or the two heroes,
the person they try to rescue, and a couple of
villains. There are so many actors in this film that
Li has to wait large portions of the running time
before returning for more action. The other actors do
a fine job, they just stand in the way of the main
point of the film. Russell Wong and Isiah Washington,
in particular, add perfect charisma to their "2nd in
charge" characters. Other Martial Arts flicks with
thinner (almost nonexistent) plots are entertaining
because what is expected, creative fighting scenes,
are shown one after the other. Rumble in the Bronx is
a good example of a ridiculous plot cured by the
expertise of its star (Jackie Chan). </P>
<P>Another problem is that Han and Tricia never give a
convincing case that they care for each other. They
both disobey their families by secretly meeting to try
and find out who killed Li's brother but there is no
real reason why they do this. Missing is a scene where
the two bond and understand their partner's struggles
in life. Would you risk your life for someone you
hardly knew? These people would at the blink of an
eye. </P>
<P>The scenes in which Jet Li skillfully gets himself out
of danger are highly recommended, but unfortunately
they are not given the center spotlight. Rent Rumble
in the Bronx and save yourself some money. </P>
