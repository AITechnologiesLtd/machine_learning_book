<P>The Spanish Prisoner (written and directed by David Mamet, 1998)</P>
<P>        If David Mamet's THE SPANISH PRISONER is not the best film of the 
year when it's time to party like it's 1999, 1998 will have been a 
phenomenal year for the cinema.  This film is a carefully woven tale, a 
tapestry of deceit sown in the wonderful dialogue of David Mamet, who has 
taken a break from the writer-for-hire chores of THE EDGE and WAG THE DOG 
to both pen and direct a new masterpiece about con artists.</P>
<P>        And con artists is the perfect term.  The confidence game to 
which Joe Ross (Campbell Scott, son of George C.) falls victim is nothing 
less than an artistic and aesthetic masterpiece; you applaud each of the 
game's twists even as you feel for Ross, an Everyman trapped nearly every 
step of the way.  The beauty of THE SPANISH PRISONER is that even if you 
are one step ahead of the con, you still are not sure exactly how it will 
play out, what the ramifications are, or how Ross will react.  There is 
always an extra step, and always an extra element to each step.  THE 
SPANISH PRISONER certainly keeps one on one's toes.</P>
<P>        Any plot information is too much; it is best to enter the film 
without expectations about any character.  It is evident quickly who the 
victim will be; what is not evident is who exactly is playing who and 
how.  Suffice to say that there is a lot of money at stake; suffice to 
say that the MacGuffin of the day is a mathematical uberformula dubbed 
The Process; suffice to say that if The Process falls into the wrong 
hands there will be hell to pay for Joe Ross; suffice to say that The 
Company will watch Ross and The Process very carefully.</P>
<P>        But no one is careful enough in The Spanish Prisoner.  No one is 
careful enough because almost no one is who they claim to be.  Everyone 
acts to one degree or another, everyone deep in facades and masquerades. 
There is a sinister menace in a world where an innocuous summer 
conversation alters one's life.  Everyone's acting, everyone wants 
something, everyone's out to con everyone.  Mamet does not spare us one 
moment of the menace, and we are all a lot richer for the experience.</P>
