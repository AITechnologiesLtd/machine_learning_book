<PRE>³ American Beauty ³          * * * *</PRE>
<PRE>     ... um.  Wow.</PRE>
<P>Ever seen a film so well-constructed, so accomplished
every moment, one to the next, you get chills?  That happened
to me about ten times during the brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant AMERICAN BEAUTY.</P>
<P>Hard to describe, and how often does that happen to
movies, BEAUTY stars Kevin Spacey (in _the_ performance of
1999) as Lester Burnham, a self-proclaimed loser who tells
us candidly he¹ll be dead soon.  He feels dead already,
anyway, so his presage sounds like that of someone content
with, at least, knowing how things are going to turn out,
knowing they gave a crack at changing their dolorous existence
for the better while they still had a chance to.  As opposed
to living in a constant state of numbness, and certainty life
will always be unsatisfactory and the best to possibly hope
for, from it, is to occasionally experience mediocrity.  Noone
around you respects you, you¹re stuck in a dead-end job, home
and family couldn¹t be more wrought with dysfunction -- so
much so that it¹s like everybody knows their role, and nobody
even feels connected to themself any longer.  I can¹t imagine
a lower form of being, which is right AMERICAN BEAUTY kicks
off.</P>
<P>Lester can¹t take anymore.  The day to day to day emotional
void; the resent laying dormant, just below the surface,
chafing everything.  The nagging sense of detachment.  His power-
trip wife, Carolyn (a most energetic Annette Bening), places
too high a value on their couch, and dresses professionally to
tend garden; no time for sex.  His daughter Jane (Thora Birch)
hates both parents, equally, and wishes they would just go away.
At work, his boss hints around a firing, unless he writes a
company letter begging them to keep him on.  Hopeless scenario.</P>
<P>Then, Lester meets two individuals who¹ll turn things around.
One is Amanda Hayes (Mena Suvari), his daughter¹s cheerleader
classmate.  At a high school basketball game, he spots the blonde
lolita -- in a rather racy dance sequence, ages considered, where
it¹s just the two of them: Lester alone in the bleachers, spot-
light on her -- and is marvelled.  There¹s a great scene right
after -- Jane introduces Amanda, and Spacey stares at the girl,
mouth agape, stumbling desperately for something to say; it¹s an
embarassing moment because Spacey plays it with genuine infatuation,
crush written all over his face, exposed and vulnerable.  Later,
he eavesdrops on an integral conversation which promptly inspires
Lester to start working out, get buff.  To impress, at first,
but it becomes more about building self-confidence.</P>
<P>Person #2 is Ricky (a mesmerizing Wes Bentley), the new
arrival next door with a propensity for filming everything in
sight; broken home, it¹s a means of escape.  He hooks Lester
up with weed and, in another terrific scene, quits his job as
a waiter -- probably just as big a waste of time as Lester¹s
advertising position -- without batting an eye.  Lester¹s
floored by that kind of indifference; friendship is instantaneous.</P>
<P>We also meet Ricky¹s domineering Marine colonel father
(Chris Cooper), who beats him up for disrespecting privacy and
requires a drug test every six months.  Something I can¹t recall
ever having seen before in a movie.  I didn¹t so much agree
with that character¹s turn of events, but he¹s performed with
a firey intensity by Cooper that brings the caricature bully
out of cliche zone.</P>
<P>Same goes for the rest of this cast.  Thora Birch, as
Jane, with a permanent cautious/troubled gaze, lets us know
the isolation of jaded youth from scene one, as she is video-
taped by an unseen Ricky who asks her if she wants him to kill
her old man.  Birch finds just the right tone and sustains it
effortlessly.  She has the generation-angst, sure -- mom and
dad (mostly mom) construe her as brat -- but a scarred soul to
boot, and the actress looking lovely in her teens, hair dark,
face ravaged by repressed emotion, haunts in a knock-out piece
of work.  I loved all her scene with Bentley (Supporting nom for
this guy, please), the creepy new guy Jane catches spying on her
and dismisses with a ³fuck you².  Face to face, though, Ricky
staring directly at Jane, nothing but eye contact, it isn¹t so
easy since he seems to be looking into her.  Through her.
Getting to know her, which we presume nobody¹s ever taken the
time to do, without words -- just pure, unspoken honesty.  Their
best scene is spent watching a plastic bag dance in the wind;
he explains it¹s like God speaking to anyone aware enough to
notce.  He notices.  And, there¹s the great line, ³... so much
beauty in the world, I feel like I can¹t take it², made all
the more powerful by Bentley¹s tear-eyed delivery.  Ricky is
observant, forthright:  ³I¹m not obsessing.  I¹m just curious,²
he tells Jane; or, ³You¹re ugly.  You¹re boring.  Totally
ordinary.  And, you know it² to the superficial Amanda.  Sometimes
the words hurt, but they¹re always true.  It¹s a defense
mechanism, his brutal honesty, we sense.  We get to sense a lot,
with this nuanced portrayal of sophisticated toughness.</P>
<P>I have to go back to Kevin Spacey.  He¹s found a career
high.. no minor feat (his work, here, surpasses even GLENGARRY
GLENN ROSS - my favorite).  Like Billy Bob Thornton, in last
year¹s A SIMPLE PLAN, or Robert Downey, Jr., in TWO GIRLS AND A
GUY, this is truly superlative acting.  I always measure the
effectiveness of a performance by whether or not I can make
out an actor¹s face, or if there is only the character; wierd,
but it happens.  Only the great ones do that, and in BEAUTY,
Spacey does it.  I was glad to see Lester Burnham regain self-
esteem.  I cared.  His alliance with the much younger, but only
in appearance, Ricky is palpabe and memorable.  His perhaps
insalubrious relationship with Amanda is expertly handled.
Lester is turned on by her, and she by him, and that doesn¹t go
away once the script has established Lester¹s awakening, rebirth
so to speak; the sexual longing still remains, even after Lester
has become a Œbetter person¹.  He also loves his wife (quite
obviously, from their couch scene), and that doesn¹t disappear,
either.  This is three-dimensional writing at its best, and
the magnetic Spacey makes it unforgettable.</P>
<P>Three specific moments mark AMERICAN BEAUTY -- along
with everything else I have said -- best film of the Fall,
and year, thusfar:  Ricky¹s final, mental revenge against
his father; perfect.  The long, aforementioned close-up of a
plastic bag, with voice-over; perfect.  And, in the warm,
poignant scene between Lester and the underage object of his
affection, when she asks him how his life has been; Spacey¹s
expression, reflecting back, the way it curls into a triumphant
smile moved me to tears.</P>
<P>Bravo to Adam Bell¹s uninhibited, progressively interesting
screenplay.  Bravo to a stellar ensemble.  Bravo to myriad
inevitable Oscar nods.  AMERICAN BEAUTY reminds us, above all,
the vitality of indisputably great cinema.</P>
<P>    Best line:  "I'm looking for the least possible amount</P>
<PRE>         of responsibility."</PRE>
