<P>THE OTHER SIDE OF SUNDAY, was one of the Final Nominees for the
Foreign Film Oscar. And it made its first Portland appearance in this
21st Portland Film Festival, so others would get a chance to see this
interesting, not really great, but very well written film, that really
wants to make a serious point, despite its opinionated nature.</P>
<P>The subject matter itself, is a tired one, specially for American
standards, and it really leaves one with only one thing left... what
is it like in other places? We know through Ingmar Bergman that these
things are till strong, and that fundamentalists had a very strong
hold on their flocks for many years, in that area, and if this film is
any indication, it is extended into Norway as well.... not that we
really want to mix film and reality, but why would anyone try it,
right? One can guess that the problem still exists, although the film
points to the 50's.</P>
<P>The story is that of Marie, who is growing as a teenager, and is
finding herself in the midst of many pranks by other fellow students,
who pick on her as she is the priest's daughter, and quite naive. She
befriends a Mrs.  Tunheim, who is the caretaker of the church, and
they become friends, where Marie learns a few things here and
there.... like about makeup and a little different hair style, even
some earrings.</P>
<P>As Marie grows, her innocence begins disappearing, and she starts
doing things with a few of the other girls in the school. In one
outing, it appears that the other two friends of hers are ready for
sex, and Marie, is the odd one out. All of this, just adds to Marie's
rebellion, and she begins slowly by comfronting her father, at first
regarding her younger brother's flatulence, and later about lies. In
both cases she gets slapped hard. But one thing is clear, Marie is
beginning to win the battle, and she has not planned to give up, like
some of her friends have already done.</P>
<P>And in the end, Mrs. Tunheim kills herself, apparently she has waited
all her life for Marie's father, and has been a faithful mistress in
all that time, and he has not come through. His own wife's illness has
not helped things much, although it is not clear in the film if this
relationship involves anything beyond some intimacy. This is hard for
Marie, but it is the liberating force she really needed. Her father
has been a bit of a hypocrite in the pulpit, and she now has a chance
to shine on the father, and does so with a really nice of earrings,
that Johannes obviously recognizes. The daughter knows, and he knows
that she knows.</P>
<P>The film ends with the young Marie stepping out on her own... she has
fled the coop. Unlike most other girls, who never got over their guilt
feelings, for whatever they decided to do, and eventually became pure
Christians, Marie never quit on herself, or what he knew to be an
obvious sham, and nothing but a control game.</P>
<P>The best part of this film is the viciousness it attacks Christianity
with, in just a few well placed lines... the film treads quietly until
the moment for each line, and these situations are never set up in a
way that we can expect. Well, sort of. We know that they sit up at the
dinner table every night, we just don't know what is going to happen,
and that's when things tend to get out of hand. But the real loser in
all these confrontations is the Johannes, who is, in the end, noticing
that his own way has broken up what he thought was a happy
family.... one that he does not really love, it seems, although he
claims that it is his duty to do so... once again, ogligated to do
something, rather than wanting to be a part of it. This is what the
film is about, all the way through it, and us, in the audience, as
Americans, can only sit back and applaud that Marie makes it, rather
than fall by wayside like so many others have.  While, from a film
making stand point there is little that makes this film special,
still, in topic and design it is a nice one. The filming, or the
print, seem to be washed out, and there never really is any sunshine
in the film, with the exception of one moment... the ending shot. This
stark feeling permeates the whole film, and does make it a bit dreary
and heavy, and at times rather slow. But it is all from Marie's point
of view, really, which is akin to this feeling... but one need not
take it literally, I don't think.</P>
<P>Enjoyable in all this, is the way that the young girls are
growing. While it appears that a few of them are winning on Marie,
they really are not.  They just had the opportunity which Marie did
not. But, in the end, this opportunity does not amount to a hill of
beans, and all the girls that crossed the line, to find out what the
new world was all about, had pretty much repented and gone back to the
old world of the Christian design. Which is to say, that Marie did it
right, until she knew that she had the freedom to take such a jump,
and not worry about her parents, or anyone else. All the other girls
do not have this intelligence, and come off as dolls, by comparison.</P>
<P>A good film, depending too much on the dialogue to make its point. But
the chances it creates for its venom, are excellent, and really break
through well.</P>
