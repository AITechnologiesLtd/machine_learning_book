<P>     KEEPING THE FAITH is not a feature length version of the old joke
about a priest and a rabbi walking into a bar ... not exactly, anyway. 
The set-up finds director/co-star Edward Norton exploiting exactly that
concept as his character -- New York Catholic priest Brian Finn -- relates
the film's story to an incredulous barkeep. It seems that Brian has been
friends since childhood with Jake Schram (Ben Stiller), who grew up to
become a rabbi. Their middle-school cohort also included Anna Reilly
(Jenna Elfman), who moved away to California fifteen years earlier but has
recently returned to New York for her job. Her return creates romantic
tensions between the three friends, what with vows of chastity,
Jewish/Gentile relationship conflicts and all.</P>
<P>     There's a lot of ground to be covered in a romantic comedy that also
introduces questions of faith, cultural and religious melting pots and
balancing career and personal goals. And KEEPING THE FAITH seems intent on
covering every last square foot of it. Brian and Jake, each in his way,
sets out to shake up the complacency of their respective congregations
(usually with some sort of pop culture reference point in the mix). Anna
struggles with whether her go-go job as a corporate consultant has left
her soulless. Characters fret over how others will perceive their
decisions to cross cultural barriers. Screenwriter Stuart Blumberg dashes
madly back and forth between themes, while Norton dashes madly back and
forth between tones (how else to describe a sentimental romance that also
includes slapstick dips in holy water fonts and the surreal inclusion of
"Heroes of the Torah" trading cards?). Oh, and somewhere along the way
they're supposed to fit in a love story. It's no wonder Norton felt the
need to have a lightweight film clock in at two hours plus.</P>
<P>     Thank heaven that KEEPING THE FAITH is often quite funny in its
fragmented, scattershot way. Blumberg's script is ripe with good dialogue,
and a couple of solidly crafted set pieces (including a Jewish American
Princess date from hell). Stiller continues to build a body of comic
screen work that measures up to any of his contemporaries, giving zing to
Jake's self-deprecating manner. There are eye-catching bit parts,
including Ken Leung in a very funny scene as a karaoke machine salesman. 
And there's Jenna Elfman, who has never particularly impressed me in the
past except as a ball of energy. Here she's a completely convincing object
of desire (even if Norton lingers on her close-ups a bit too lovingly),
luminous, intelligent and driven. As one part of a romantic pairing, she's
a tough act to match.</P>
<P>     The match, as it turns out, becomes one of KEEPING THE FAITH's bigger
problems. Eventually the story pairs Anna with Jake, inspiring gags
surrounding Jake's fear of offending either his mother (Anne Bancroft) or
his more conservative congregation members by dating a Gentile. The
premise is sound enough, but Stiller never looks comfortable as a romantic
lead. In fact, there's more plausible chemistry between Elfman and Norton,
and not just because both actors are blonde -- the pairing we're expected
to root for just doesn't seem like a particularly good combination of
personalities. How much more interesting -- and daring -- KEEPING THE
FAITH might have been if the film had suggested Anna was merely
sublimating her desire for Brian with Jake, making for much tougher
choices at the film's conclusion.</P>
<P>     That's probably too much to ask from a film that, at its core, is a
fairly fluffy Hollywood confection. It's another one of those love poems 
to New York as the place where nice Jewish boys meet the goys of their
dreams, like ANNIE HALL or WHEN HARRY MET SALLY only less effective as
romance or comedy (though more than a match in romanticized Manhattan
skyline shots). It's certainly a pleasant enough diversion, good for more
than enough chuckles to make it worth a look, but it's surprisingly timid
for a film that tries to cover so many thematic elements. It's also a lot
warmer 'n' fuzzier than you'd expect from the cinematic equivalent of "a
priest and a rabbi walk into a bar..."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 ecclesiashticks:  6.</PRE>
