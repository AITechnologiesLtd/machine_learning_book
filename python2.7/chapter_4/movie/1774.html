<PRE>                                     THE TEMP
                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Peter Derns (Timothy Hutton) is an executive at a cookie producing
company.  When his usual assistant becomes indisposed, Kris Bolin (Lara
Flynn Boyle), a temp, arrives to help Peter get his office in order and
prepare his reports on time.  However, Kris isn't satisfied with just
being an assistant, and is soon setting her heights on one of a number
of executive jobs that suddenly become available as a result of the
deaths of the people who previously held them.</P>
<P>     I actually liked the ending of this movie.  Compared to what
usually comes at the end of the majority of today's thrillers, the final
scene in THE TEMP is cleverly-written and nicely surprising.
Unfortunately, it's about the only thing in this film that the word
"clever" could be used to describe.  Put simply, most of this motion
picture is puerile rubbish.</P>
<P>     The plot is a colossal mess.  It heaps implausibility upon
implausibility until the viewer is left scratching his or her head and
saying, "They can't be serious about that."  It's the movie's job to
present its events, no matter how outlandish in a convincing manner so
that the audience can suspend disbelief.  THE TEMP either has no idea
how to do this, or doesn't care enough to make the attempt.  There are a
number of subplots that are started, given some background, then
inexplicably dropped, never to be heard from again.  One or two of them
seemed to have some promise.  The relationships between certain
characters are also left tangled or dangling without resolution.</P>
<P>     Of course, this film is in the grand tradition of second-rate
garbage like THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, UNLAWFUL ENTRY, SINGLE
WHITE FEMALE, etc.  I keep going into these films hoping that they're
going to have some new twist to apply to the genre.  None of them,
including this latest entry, do.  If you've seen one, you've seen them
all.  In this case, THE TEMP doesn't even have a catchy title.</P>
<P>     Timothy Hutton is decidedly unconvincing in his portrayal of the
sometimes-paranoid Peter Derns.  Hutton goes from wooden to
over-the-top at fairly regular intervals.  With a little more effort on
his part, we might have gotten the feeling that there was something in
Derns worth caring about.  As it is, we get a dull, one-dimensional man
in a business suit who has psychological, financial, and marital
problems.</P>
<P>     Two performers do reasonable jobs.  One is Lara Flynn Boyle in the
title role.  Not known for solid acting in the past, she's the best
thing about this film.  It's too bad that her most convincing
performance to date (excluding a few memorable scenes in the TV series
TWIN PEAKS) comes in a picture that has so little to recommend it.  Also
doing an impressive job in a smaller role is Maura Tierney (as Derns'
estranged wife Sharon), who may play the only genuinely likable
character in the whole movie.</P>
<P>     THE TEMP is a poor thriller.  What's worse, it's unimaginative,
with a plot filled with holes that even the easiest-to-please movie-goer
will have a hard time explaining away.  There's also the expected blood
and gore, and the familiar "did she or didn't she do it" questions.  But
you didn't expect anything better, did you?  Not from a movie with a tag
line of "Don't get mad.  Get promoted."</P>
<PRE>                         Rating:  5.2 (D+, *1/2)</PRE>
