<PRE>                            THE LAST SEDUCTION
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     If you like black comedy (film noir), this one should be right up
your alley.  It's mostly about an unbelievably monstrous conniver,
Bridget Gregory (Linda Fiorentino) who from the very first scenes is
obviously a woman to avoid.  She has sent her husband, Clay (Bill
Pullman), out to make a drug deal with some very unsavory characters.
No sooner does he return with the briefcase full of bills than she
takes off with the money, leaving him to face the mobsters who expect
their cut.</P>
<P>     Aware that her husband is going to do everything to find her, she
holes up in a small town where she seduces Mike (Peter Berg) a nice
nobody she meets at a bar.  He is tired of this mall town life and
would like to branch out and Bridget, he believes, can help him out.
Has he got the wrong number!  Bridget has her own agenda about how she
will use Mike; her plotting keeps the moving reeling along.</P>
<P>     Like with much of black comedy you have to ignore the many things
you are expected to believe which you would not accept in a
straightforward drama.  But given that, this one is quite entertaining
with Fiorentino great as the femme fatale.</P>
<PRE>     Directed by John Dahl of RED ROCK WEST fame.</PRE>
