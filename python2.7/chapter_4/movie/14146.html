<PRE>                      RATING: ** (out of a possible *****)</PRE>
<P>        It's always disappointing to realise, halfway through a movie,
that you have no idea what it's about.  On the surface, "54" seems to be
straightforward enough: it tells the story of a legendary '70s Manhattan
nightclub, a place so trendy that the doorman refused admission to 9 out
of every 10 people who tried to get inside.  For those lucky enough to
gain entrance, drugs and sex were free for the asking.  Simply being seen
at the club could get you invited into an elite social circle, which
included not only royalty, but the biggest celebrities of the day.</P>
<P>        Shane (Ryan Phillippe) is a teenager with a crush on soap-opera
star Julie Black (Neve Campbell).  When a newspaper article reports that
Julie has been spotted at the nightclub several times, the handsome but
dim-witted Shane pays a visit.  Gaining admission via his rugged good
looks, he manages to land a job as a busboy, eventually working his way
up to bartender.</P>
<P>        The club's owner, Steve Rubell ("Wayne's World" creator Mike
Myers, in a highly-touted dramatic role), is a drug-addict who runs
the nightclub his way, with little regard for the consequences of his
actions.  (In a nationally-televised interview, for example, Rubell
cheerfully admits that he lies to the IRS about how much money the club
makes.)  His is a world of pills, music, and regrets, none of which are
easily remembered the next day.</P>
<P>        This had the potential to be an interesting story, but the
execution is, alas, very clumsy.  The script is unfocused; it doesn't
really succeed at conveying either the excitement of the era, or any
indication why the club was so highly regarded.  It's "The Last Days of
Disco" meets "Boogie Nights," with all the high-points somehow lost
along the way.</P>
<P>        But whatever flaws the film may have, they are not the fault of
Myers; indeed, so convincing is his performance that all thoughts of Wayne
Campbell and Austin Powers were forever purged from my mind.  Myers knows
that Rubell is not a hero; he's just a junkie trying to get by the best
way he knows how, and he plays the role accordingly.  I have new respect
for his abilities as an actor.</P>
<P>        In fact, Myers is so good that the film suffers when he's not on
the screen.  Although the character of Rubell is intriguing, he's reduced
to a relatively small part.  Considering that nearly all the events which
happen in the movie (including an IRS audit of the club and the death of
a patron) would significantly affect his character, it's surprising that
he's given so little screen time in comparison to the exceedingly bland
Shane.  Ryan Phillippe seems to be sleep-walking through his role,
mumbling his lines and showing little interest in any of the remarkable
things that happen to him.  Neve Campbell turns in her usual competent
performance, but the script never allows her to become a "real" person.
She remains just another face passing briefly through Shane's life.  This
is one of the most disappointing facets of the movie: getting to know the
"real" person behind the Famous Actress persona that Julie wears should
be fascinating; instead, it comes off as trite.</P>
<P>        The movie succeeds, however, at capturing the claustrophobic feel
of a crowded nightclub.  Nearly every scene is "lit" only by neon signs
or disco strobe lights.  The grainy, underexposed look which results from
this method of shooting is just right.  The music is also well-chosen,
capturing the feel of the late '70s.  Rubell's spoken introductions to
many of the songs are also quite amusing.  An "A+" for atmosphere, but
alas, that alone doesn't make a great film.</P>
<P>        "54" isn't horrible, but it steps all over itself while attempting
to convey a story.  Rather than needing MORE plot, the film needs to drop
its superfluous elements and instead focus on its most interesting
storyline: Steve Rubell's struggle to keep the club open in the face of
adversity.  The film rolls along nicely during Mike Myers' scenes, but
overall it plays out like the disco music featured on its soundtrack:
occasionally pleasant, but ultimately going nowhere.</P>
