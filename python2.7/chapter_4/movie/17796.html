<PRE>"Do you wish you could be 18 again?" </PRE>
<P>If you've ever asked this question to someone of considerable age, you
undoubtedly know the answer is something like, "Not unless I could have
the knowledge I do now." And indeed, there's a certain naïveté about the
teenage years that befits the young but baffles the elderly. This
philosophical fountain of youth is pondered in the lyrics of songs and
countless movies, but most recently it's given a home in the flighty
Raja Gosnell romance NEVER BEEN KISSED. </P>
<P>Gosnell (HOME ALONE 3)'s story is also a foray into the
fish-out-of-water theme, which posits a character in unfamiliar settings
and exploits the implied, resultant humor. In this case, Chicago
Sun-Times copy editor Josie Gellar (Drew Barrymore) is chosen to write
an undercover piece on today's high schoolers. Unfortunately, in her
first go at it, Josie was a real geek -- worse than Paul on "The Wonder
Years." To the rescue comes her brother Rob (David Arquette), who proves
the little-known truth that it only takes one person to think you're
cool to be "in." Soon Josie is in the running for prom queen and the
romantic interest of stud English teacher Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan). </P>
<P>Throughout this story the movie attempts to juggle several different
ideas before dropping them all in favor of a predictable and
disappointing ending. The first of these themes is Josie's inadaquate
character for the job of undercover reporting -- she's a control freak
copy editor, accustomed to correcting people's grammar and not sliding
into hip-and-trendy MTV-era high school. This idea gets dropped in favor
of the second one, which is the inevitable humiliation that will occur
when Josie attends high school. The third subplot, which is unfinished
and consequently unsuccessful, is the romantic possibility between Josie
and her English teacher Coulson; the resolution to this plot does not
make sense. And finally, the fourth facet of the script is Rob's minor
role in Josie's life, as well as his "redemption" in high school. Truly,
his story holds interesting potential, but it too is compromised in a
quick-and-easy ending. </P>
<P>The cast carries off these different larks in typical and unremarkable
fashion. Barrymore gives a lackluster performance here, which is
especially disappointing after she had received such high acclaim for
her last two romantic pictures (EVER AFTER and THE WEDDING SINGER). She
proves here that she's unable to carry a movie which has little support
and relies heavily on the lead. In terms of support, both Arquette
(SCREAM 2) and Vartan (THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS) have too little
screentime and not enough to say to make an effective appearance. There
is not a standout player among the lot. </P>
<P>In terms of romantic offerings this year, NEVER BEEN KISSED falls below
par. There are those who will sympathize with the geekiness of
Barrymore's character, but in its own right, the movie paralells its
oddity. Nothing ever comes together, and other than a good laugh or two
at the expense of others, time and money are best spent elsewhere. </P>
