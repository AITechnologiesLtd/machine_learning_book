<PRE>Spawn (1997) * * 1/2
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<PRE>CAPSULE:</PRE>
<P>SPAWN is the kind of movie they used to pass out scratch 'n sniff
cards for -- "to enhance the sensory experience". It's not the
greatest film ever made -- not by a mile -- but it's ambitious as all
hell, pardon the pun, and is so over the top that it actually
works. It's about a man who's been chosen to lead the Devil's armies
on earth (and eventually, in heaven), and it slams this comic-book
story home with gobbets of gory special effects and eye-searing
computer graphics. If this isn't your cup of Diet Pepsi, I say pick
another review. If it is, read on.</P>
<P>The man who we come to know as Spawn (Michael Jai White) starts off in
life as an assassin for a secret government bureau. He's sick of it
and wants out, but his boss (Martin Sheen, looking weirdly like
Stephen King with that beard and hair) double-crosses him. Instead of
dying, however, our hero is whisked down to hell and drafted into the
service of Satan (named Malebolgia in this movie): if he leads Satan's
armies, he will get to see his wife and children once more. He's also
given a controller, of sorts, a vile bucket of suet and four-letter
words with a clown's face (played, incredibly, by John Leguizamo), who
turns out to be another stab in the back.</P>
<P>The movie quickly turns into a high-tech special effects ride, with
the usual obligatory nods towads a plot and theme. Movies like this
succeed or fail largely based on the level of energy and inventiveness
they possess, not the originality of their plots, and SPAWN is if
nothing else energetic. Spawn's suit (done with CGI) sprouts horns,
fangs, claws, chains, and a giant undulating cape that reminded me of
a sentient glob of bubble gum. The soundtrack's a loud, unending roar
of industrial-strength drumbeats and guitars; the acting rapid-fire
and goofy. There's always something weird to look at or listen to.</P>
<P>The movie's sole ambition is to be brassily entertaining, and it does
that well.  The worst thing you can say about SPAWN, I guess -- beyond
it being very silly frat-boy level fun -- is that it sets itself up
for a sequel.</P>
