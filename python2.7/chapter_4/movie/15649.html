Susan Granger's review of "PRINCE OF EGYPT" (DreamWorks)</PRE>
<P>Set in ancient Egypt, this animated tale follows the Biblical
story of Exodus in which Moses grew from slave to prince and led his
people to the promised land, progressing from hedonistic unawareness
to an acceptance of faith and responsibility as God's chosen leader of
the Jewish people. It's a loose adaptation, capturing the "essence and
values" of the Bible story. Scholars may quibble with the fact that
Moses is rescued by Pharaoh's wife (Helen Mirren), not daughter but,
despite details which have been changed, the epic holds true as the
baby is set adrift on the Nile by his mother to escape the wrath of
Pharaoh (Patrick Stewart) against the Hebrews. Miraculously, he is
found and raised as a member of the Royal Family. Ignorant of his
heritage, he forms a close bond with Pharaoh's son Ramses (Ralph
Fiennes) yet, the step-brothers are torn apart by fate (think Cain and
Abel) as Moses (Val Kilmer) meets his sister (Sandra Bullock) who
reveals who he is and where he came from. The brothers' teenage
relationship is a DreamWorks invention that works dramatically since,
eventually, Moses must appeal to Ramses to let his oppressed people
go, amidst plague-and-pestilence. DreamWorks' animation is stunning,
never surrendering to "cute" touches that would make it into a
whimsical cartoon for moppets. It's a risky, PG-rated choice that may
lose the pre-school "Antz" audience but should pay off in the long
run, combining "Raiders of the Lost Ark" with "The Ten Commandments."
And the music is magnificent with a score that should dominate Oscar
night. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Prince of Egypt" is a
fanciful yet reverent 10, an instant classic that redefines the
animation genre with a new sophistication. One of the best pictures of
the year!</P>
