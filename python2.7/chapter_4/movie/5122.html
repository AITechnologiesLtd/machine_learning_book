<P>        Francesco Dellamorte has a bit of a problem. He's the live-in
watchman at Buffalora Cemetery in northern Italy, where the corpses are
crawling back out of their graves after spending a mere week or so in the
ground. As you can imagine, that's something of a nuisance, but if he
reports it to the authorities, he's certain of one thing -- they'll shut
down the cemetery to investigate, and Francesco will be out of a job. 
Since he can't have that happening, he keeps a loaded pistol with him,
which he carries to the door whenever he answers a knock. It's usually
just one of them coming back, and a single bullet blown solidly through
the head -- where have you gone, George Romero? -- takes a zombie down
easily enough. For a misanthrope like Francesco, it's a pretty good gig. </P>
<P>        Surrounded by death, and with only the clumsy and deformed Gnaghi
for company, Francesco's life is pretty stable until he falls for a
mourning widow. Anna Falchi plays the object of his desire (known in the
credits as "She"), whom he seduces in the Buffalora Ossuary (where the
bones of the dead are deposited); the two indulge their strange affections
on her poor husband's grave.  Naturally, the old man comes back. The woman
dies in her spouse's ensuing fit of jealous violence, and Francesco is
stricken with despair.  Naturally, She comes back again. And again. </P>
<P>        That's only the surface of the remarkable DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE. 
You might expect even a stylish horror director to milk these situations
for all they're worth, but Michele Soavi knows that zombie hijinks have
been done to death by such precocious directors as Sam Raimi and Peter
Jackson.  Accordingly, the movie never stops moving, twisting and turning
its way to an oddly existential climax. The scenario, written for the
screen by Gianni Romoli from a comic book scenario by Tiziano Sclavi,
concentrates on the human characters rather than the zombies, and gives as
much play to turmoil of the spirit as it does to the carnage that spills
from the body. The world of Francesco Dellamorte runs parallel to George
Romero's zombie apocalypse. Like Romero's trilogy, and quite unlike many
of its imitators, DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE is a zombie movie with character. </P>
<P>        I have to wonder what American audiences are expecting on the way
into this picture, given that the normally staid October Films has created
a mild cheeseball of an ad campaign to push the film into U.S. theaters. 
"Zombies, Guns and Sex, OH MY!" reads the tagline, stripped across poster
art that may lead audiences to believe that CEMETERY MAN is actually a
cheap horror flick from the 50s or 60s. I find it hard to believe that
this campaign will actually attract a discriminating audience, but
stranger things have happened, and we'll just have to see. Rest assured
that CEMETERY MAN/DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE is a confident, creepy little
horror film with a winning sense of humor, a sure feel for outrageous
imagery, and a healthy mean streak. </P>
<P>        As played by Rupert Everett (READY TO WEAR), Francesco is a misfit
and a nihilist. (The main character in the Dylan Dog comic book series
originated by Sclavi is based on Everett, and his casting here is
something of a coup.) He's also a remarkable Everyman who commands our
attention and our sympathy as he slouches toward the inevitable. Francois
Hadji Lazaro's Gnaghi is by turns irritating and pathetic. (You may have
seen Lazaro as the meanest-looking cyclops in THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN.)
By the time he develops a decidedly unhealthy crush on the mayor's
daughter (and the mayor's daughter's disembodied head), Lazaro has invited
viewers to inhabit his character, and the results are unsettling. The
relationship is consummated at the end of the film, but these two are
shown early on to be classic codependents. Along those lines, the movie
exhibits a well-developed sense of humor that Goes a long way toward
eliciting the viewer's sympathy. The characters aren't very pleasant, but
you start to identify with them in spite of yourself. By the time the
movie is over, their predicament almost seems to take on mythic
proportions. </P>
<P>        Herein seems to lie the problem for many American critics, who
have been less than impressed with what may be a vigorous political
allegory.  I guess I'm a little slow, but I didn't understand right away
that the Italian citizens who are zombified -- a disquietingly fascist
troupe of boy scouts, Buffalora's highest ranking incompetent bureaucrat
-- may represent the dead archetypes of Italian society come back to haunt
the living. Instead, I fell for the grisly comedy and the sharp cinematic
style, which references such influential pictures as VERTIGO and ONCE UPON
A TIME IN THE WEST (on which Soavi's progenitor Dario Argento received a
story credit). And while that bastion of genre reporting, CINEFANTASTIQUE,
had decidedly unkind words for the film's alleged misogyny, I read it
instead as a look inside poor Dellamorte's head. Francesco, as noted
above, is an equal opportunity curmudgeon, and if She is treated as the
most maddening of all the characters, it's because she is the object of
Francesco's most maddening obsessions. At the same time, I think these
critics complain a little too much. Stephen Holden, writing in THE NEW
YORK TIMES, criticized the film's decision to make Francesco impotent --
missing the important joke, which is that he's really not impotent at all,
despite the rumor around town (you have to wonder if Holden left partway
through). </P>
<P>        The cemetery itself is a triumph of production design, an
inhabited world with curious nooks and crannies (the Ossuary, Gnaghi's
cellar in the watchman's house). It's also a representation of Francesco's
state of mind, and the essence of the movie rests in the ways he discovers
to break away from it. Gory and playful, darkly humorous and flippantly
bleak, Soavi's film is a joyride through a sullen state of mind. After
Francesco takes his revenge on the world outside, and sets himself to
escaping from the life he's made, DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE finally offers up
its own definition of madness. </P>
