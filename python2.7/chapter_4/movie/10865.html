<P>The Hitcher 
(Review by Philipp Lenssen/ <A HREF="mailto:Jester@T-Online.de,">Jester@T-Online.de,</A> Jan. 1998)</P>
<P>"Out on the desert highway, the rule of thumb has a different meaning..." </P>
<P>The story here is basically good man against evil man. Jim Halsey 
(C. Thomas Howell) is driving a car through Texas and takes up hitcher 
John Ryder with the words "My mother told me never to do this", 
foreshadowing the tragedy ahead. The man sitting in his car, played by 
Rutger Hauer (seen in Blade Runner), turns out to be a psychopath. 
Little does Jim Halsey know when he bravely throws the hitcher out of 
the car that by escaping death he just qualified himself for his worst 
nightmare. The hitcher found someone to play a deadly game with...</P>
<P>The nice twist here is the Hitchcock-like innocent hunted as murder
theme... when he cannot even turn to the police, the hero is
suddenly very alone. The other interesting thing is the neverending
nightmare, when you're never sure when it's over, and you never
quite get behind the hitchers mask and now what it's all about
anyway. The Hitcher's brilliant play (Robert Townsend writes "C.
Thomas Howell declared later that he was actually frightened of
Hauer throughout the filming, and not just acting") and shooting
makes this for an atmospheric, unforgettable experience. </P>
<PRE>The Halsey Ryder relation-ship</PRE>
<P>During the course of the movie we see that the hitcher John Ryder focusses
on Jim Halsey. Other peolpe surrounding Halsey are massacred, but he
himself is even getting help, and Ryder tells him how to do things.
Ryder's not making it easy for Halsey but he's also making sure there's a
fair chance for Halsey to always escape. Nash, a waitress Halsey gets too
know, will cry out: "Why didn't he kill us?" </P>
<P>Roger Ebert states in his 1986 review of The Hitcher that "there is
something sadomasochistic going on between the two men". He also writes
"this movie is diseased and corrupt. I would have admired it more if it
had found the courage to acknowledge the real relationship it was
portraying". Ryder might be sadistically enjoying his actions, but I don't
see Halsey getting into this situation deliberately, or enjoying it, or not
wanting to get out of it. </P>
<P>"'The Hitcher' begins and ends with the same sound: a match being struck,
flaring into flame. At the beginning of the film, the sound is made by the
villain, a hitchhiker who is a mass murderer. At the end of the film, the
sound is made by the hero, a young man whose life has been spared so that
he can become the special victim of the hitchhiker." </P>
<P>What Ebert describes here is wrong. The person striking a match at the
beginning and at the end is both times the hero Halsey. I don't want to
analyze this symmetry (we'll see many cigarettes lit during the movie,
which is not too absurd when the characters smoke), but it shows
Ebert uses false proof. Still, "there is something strange going on 
between the two of [them]", as a police man tells us near the end. </P>
<P>Keith Myles quotes "Derek Winnert's assertion that the relationship of the
protagonists is dominated by latent homosexuality". There is a subtle
sexual undertone in the way Rutger Hauer plays the character, and it
emphasizes Ryder's evil ironic humor. But not only do we see him touching
Halsey, we see him kiss the little girl in the car and the same tender
scheme towards Nash. A cat's playing with the mouse before striking, 
showing a certain elegance which might arouse sympathy in us... it makes the
movie even more ambigue and intriguing.</P>
<P>The hitcher chooses a male counterpart because he is looking for both a
contrast and reflection. The contrast is that Halsey is the good man (you
can't play a game without conflict), and the reflection is Halsey's
youthful male energy. It'll become a teacher - pupil/ master - apprentice
relationship. Halsey's survival skill is trained. The pupil chosen has to
be good enough to be able to understand the scope of evilness he sees and
to challenge his master. </P>
<PRE>At the beginning:
Halsey: "What do you want?"
Ryder: "I want you to stop me." </PRE>
<PRE>And later on: 
Halsey: "Why are you doing this to me?"
Ryder: "You're a smart kid, figure it out." </PRE>
<P>When Jim Halsey's girl Nash is being is tied between the two trucks, Ryder 
makes Halsey put the gun against his face, he wants Halsey to pull the 
trigger and kill him. It's again very clear who's making up the rules
of this game. When Halsey can't do it, Ryder is disappointed and suddenly 
stops to smile: "You're useless waste." He punishes him by killing off Nash
(the importance of Nash to Ryder is only in her relation towards Halsey: 
For Ryder she is functioning as hostage and "price to pay" for Halsey here).
Ryder's disappointment expresses that he thought Halsey to be a worthy opponent 
so far, expecting him to be an equally good judge now. When he steps on the gas
it becomes, though not graphically violent, a truly horrible scene. We're put 
back and shocked by the reminder that the hitcher is not following any 
convention - Ebert thinks this is "so grotesquely out of proportion [...] 
that it suggests a deep sickness at the screenplay stage", which I would 
rephrase by saying it suggests a deep sickness of the hitcher, and suggesting 
anything else would be glorifying mass murder. </P>
<P>When Nash is killed, the screen fades to black and this event will result
in a turning point in Halsey's character. Halsey knows that the killer
will not stop until he's put to death by him; he understands the perverted
game and the fact that he has to play it (he's clearly forced to act).
When the police is questioning the hitcher, Halsey enters. He touches
Ryder and spits him in the face, and in that scene Ryder knows that Halsey
has understood the game and hates Ryder for it. </P>
<P>Later when Halsey is sitting in a police car, he tells the police man:
"You'll never hold him."
"There's something I gotta do."
When we look back on Halsey's character we see this is his second turning
point in the movie. The first crucial moment was Halsey resisting the urge
to commit suicide when he put the gun up his head earlier on: by choosing
to live on he accepted to be the hitcher's contrahent and play his game.
Now, when Halsey takes over the police car and turns around, for the first
time Ryder is the one who's being followed: Halsey accepts to be the
hitcher's judge and kill him. </P>
<P>After what happened Jim Halsey does indeed feel relieved when he gets his
revenge. It's true that a bond is created during the move, the unyfing
element of hunter and prey. The hero ends this game - he had to switch the
roles and became the hunter for this purpose. </P>
<P>At the police station Ryder says he feels tired. His suicidal rampage
makes clear he's tired of life. Shane R. Burridge writes about the
possible salvation and succession motif: "Has [Ryder] found a way to end
his curse--or worse, pass it on--by goading [Halsey] to end his life?
(When he places coins on [Halsey]'s eyes, he is suggesting that he is
damned). Significantly, during their final confrontation, [Ryder] drops a
chain to the ground and smiles: he is free at last." </P>
<P>When John Ryder laughs as he knows he's going to be killed now, this final
satisfaction is triggered by Halsey's proof of a learned lesson (the
relevance is not in eventual masochism): The teaching was a success,
because Halsey accepted the god-like responsibility of playing judge over
Ryder's life. The hitcher's game of survival, and his archaic view of an
amoral world which seperates the strong and the weak, has been absorbed by
his apprentice. He didn't want to kill Halsey, he wanted to make him "gaze
into the abyss", so that his ego projects itself onto Halsey.</P>
