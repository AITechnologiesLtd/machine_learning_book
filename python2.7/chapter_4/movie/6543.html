<P>     Another long sit.  Director Penny Marshall's all-black, sometimes-
musical remake of THE BISHOP'S WIFE-- the 1947 Best Picture nominee that
starred Cary Grant as an angel who arrives on Earth to assist a man of
the cloth-- is a good twenty minutes too long.  Maybe thirty.  The
padding is obvious in the musical numbers, of which there are at least
eight.  (I lost count.) Most of the singing is done by Whitney Huston,
whose character commands a church choir.  (Her voice soars, but her
acting doesn't.  Neither she nor co-star Courtney B. Vance appear
excited about anything in this romantic holiday comedy.)  The forced
fuzzies are also overkill.  From foster homes to fidelity, every con-
ceivable crisis is confronted and given a cheery resolution.  The jokes
are funny, thank good- ness, and there's a Microsoft gag midway through
that's worth the price of admission.  Even with a nice performance by
Denzel Washington, who plays the visiting spirit, and some occasionally
impressive supporting work, I still wanted to go home and strangle my
Tickle Me Elmo.</P>
