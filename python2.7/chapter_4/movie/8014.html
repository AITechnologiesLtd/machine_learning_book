<PRE>                                  CON AIR
                  A film review by Marty Mapes and Andrea Birgers
                   Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes and Andrea Birgers</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) In a Newsweek story, Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of
Con Air, said that, after reading an earlier version of the script, he
insisted that the movie be more character driven. David Ansen, the
Newsweek reviewer, said that he couldn't detect the subtleties of the
characters through all of the loud explosions.</P>
<P>This particular outing is about an escape. A group of America's worst
criminals are being flown to a new, state-of-the-art jail. Oh, and
Cameron Poe is also on the flight. He's being released to go home to
his wife and daughter. Two of the cons manage to unlock their cuffs,
free the rest of the prisoners, kill most of the guards, and hijack the
plane. Cameron Poe decides to help bring the plane down and return the
criminals to captivity which entails many fights, shooting and of
course, explosions</P>
<P>One scene stood out as an interesting quirk. The entire movie takes
place on or near this airplane. There is very little opportunity for
car crashes.  But one is worked into the script where a body is
jettisoned from the plane and lands on a car. The movie didn't require
that we see the body land; in fact the scene is an interlude, isolated
by the elevator music soundtrack; and just for kicks, three or four
cars crash into the car onto which the body has fallen. You gotta
admire the ability to include a car crash scene into a movie that
doesn't call for it.</P>
<P>John Malkovich was good as the evil leader of the escapees. I almost
wonder if his talents are being wasted, but this seems to be the sort
of role that he takes most often, so I suspect he likes it.</P>
<P>At the end of an action movie, the bad guy has to die, and he has to be
doing something so awful and unrelentingly that he deserves it. Con Air
makes a mistake at the end of the movie by making the villain's death
unnecessarily gruesome. We don't really feel sorry for him, but by the
time he was staring death in the face, he wasn't fighting back
anymore.</P>
<P>Producer Bruckheimer knows what he's doing. He's the man behind Top
Gun, Crimson Tide, The Rock, and now Con Air. His formula is rather
simple:  testosterone, loud rock music, cool explosions, a little plot
here and there, and voila: a summer blockbuster.</P>
<P>One idea that Bruckheimer's been toying with recently is including a
dweebish, bookish young man in the mix and making his masculinity
really show through. In The Rock, Nicolas Cage was more of a scientist
than a mercenary, but he's put in a tough circumstance where he has to
become a mercenary to survive. In Con Air, that role is filled by John
Cusack. Cusack is an upper-middle manager in the prison system, but he
gets some hands-on experience with escaped convicts by the time the
movie's over.</P>
<P>I must admit that I had fun watching this movie, as I did watching all
the other Bruckheimer movies, but it's not a great movie. It may not
even be a good movie, except that it's fun.</P>
<P>Even so, there is something about Jerry Bruckheimer movies that leaves
me feeling a little slimy. First, there is a certain macho, military
point of view to all of his movies. Somehow male posturing is linked to
patriotism in a Bruckheimer film and I have to disagree. There's more
to patriotism than blowing up enemies of society.  And second, the
problem in all Bruckheimer movies is a man (or men) with too much
testosterone, and inevitably, the solution is more testosterone.  I'm
not saying a more feminine attitude would make a better action movie,
but the idea that the solution to violence is more violence is
disquieting.</P>
<P>But that's what we can expect from Hollywood in these June scorchers,
and given the genre, Con Air is okay.</P>
