<PRE>                       THE ART OF WOO
               A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>    CAPSULE: This is an attempt at writing a modern fairy tale.  
    Alyssa Wong is a successful art expert who has to decide if 
    she wants to marry for money or for love.  The story calls 
    for a woman with Audrey Hepburn charm and Sook-Yin Lee does 
    not fill the bill.  The film is contrived and dissatisfying.  
    Rating:  3 (0 to 10), -1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>THE ART OF WOO attempts to be one of those films like BREAKFAST AT 
TIFFANY'S in which the audience is rooting for some sweet, 
vulnerable, irresistible woman to work out her problems and to 
find happiness.  The problem is that Helen Lee who writes and 
directs seems to have written Alessa Woo (played by Sook-Yin Lee) 
as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible.</P>
<P>Alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer 
in the Toronto art scene.  This is some sort of alternate world 
art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for 
paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly 
back and forth to places like Switzerland.  One of the most 
knowledgeable of the art dealers is Alessa.  She also happens to 
be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has 
suitors camped outside her window.</P>
<P>Next door to Alessa moves struggling genius artist and Native 
American Ben Crowchild (Adam Beach).  He sees that behind the 
facade that there is really a sad little girl within Alessa who 
really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is 
dating.  Ben gets emotionally involved with Alessa.  (As Alessa so 
delicately puts it, "We were bosom buddies, now we're fuck 
buddies.")  But Alessa will have to decide whether she wants love 
with Ben or wealth with her rich suitor.</P>
<P>The real problem with the film seems to be Helen Lee's inability 
to decide what she wants to be saying.  She undercuts nearly 
everything she wants us to believe about Alessa.  Alessa is 
looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large 
sums of money for her clients.  This appears to be a high profile 
and well-paid job.  We are supposed to care about Alessa's 
feelings, but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father.  
Alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art 
auction she turns into OUR MAN FLINT.</P>
<P>This is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on 
the appeal of its main character and comes up double-zero.  I rate 
it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale. </P>
