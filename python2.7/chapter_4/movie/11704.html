<P>"Hana Bi", the Japanese word for fireworks, literally translates its
two Kanji characters as "Flowers (of) Fire", the twin elements that
represent a familiar contraposition of evanescent life with violent
death.  For me, the worst thing about the present version is that it
makes Quentin Tarantino look like a gutless loser that he is.  And I
only saw _Pulp Fiction_ four times in theaters.</P>
<P>The core of the movie is its moral angle.  Detective Nishi evidently
feels himself responsible for the crippling of his partner Horibe,
shot and consequently wheelchair-bound while Nishi absents himself to
visit his terminally ill wife Miyuki at the hospital, as well as the
death of another cop at the hands of an armed robber Nishi was unable
to control.  Overcome by the awareness of failure and the sentiment of
remorse, Nishi quits the force and borrows money from yakuza in order
to enable Horibe to become a painter and help the young police widow
reduced to working at a fast food stand.  And in order to repay the
yakuza he buys a stolen taxicab from a junkyard, paints it as a police
car, dons patrol uniform, and singlehandedly robs a bank with a toy
revolver.  The interesting part comes next.  While Nishi returns the
principal to his exacting creditors, he neglects to pay the interest,
knowing full well that this oversight will oblige them to pursue him.
Thereupon the profit from his heist underwrites his final farewell to
Miyuki on a traditionally sentimental pilgrimage to Mt. Fuji, as Nishi
casually dispatches his relentless pursuers and abruptly flabbergasts
the occasional salaryman interloper or bystander with his exacting
capacity for retaliatory justice coupled with an exquisite disregard
of native decorum, in a quintessentially Japanese way of terminal
rebellion.</P>
<P>Highlights include indirect depiction of ultraviolence, which is both
very Japanese and very revisionist in style.  For example, there is a
fifteen-second scene in Kurosawa's _Red Beard_, where Toshiro Mifune,
who plays a provincial doctor in Tokugawa Japan, is confronted by a
dozen yakuza in a whorehouse yard over a sick little girl he intends
to rescue therefrom.  So we see Mifune, encircled by arrogant louts,
somberly dispatch them in a smoothly flowing sequence, visiting upon
each with his bare hands the most terrible violence possible, only to
survey the therapeutic carnage and express his misgivings about having
transgressed the Hippocratic principle to his ambitious young samurai
understudy.  And now, we have Beat Takeshi boxed in and surrounded by
sneering adversaries in the yakuza Benz, swiftly addressing each of
them in turn with a revolver abruptly confiscated from their hapless
colleague, only to proffer a final posthumous admonition to the inert
body of a thrice-thrashed, yet thitherto twice spared pompadour punk.
Thus the action has been distilled and compressed, whereas the earlier
protagonist's conscientious alter ego has been inverted and mooted.</P>
<P>On a break in their journey, as Miyuki squats at a lake shore to water
a bouquet of dead flowers, a boorish interloper upbraids her about the
futility of her melancholy gesture, whereupon Nishi abruptly shoves
him underwater and colors the lake with blooming petals of his blood,
in a warm-up for dealing with the next batch of yakuza pursuers due to
catch up with them shortly.  The juxtaposition of sentimentality and
ultraviolence exemplified in this scene certainly represents a retreat
from the more tough-minded narratives of Akira Kurosawa and Hideo
Gosha, whose stoic brooding heroes Takeshi Kitano obviously seeks to
emulate.  But the staccato beat of hard action punctuating the silent
contemplative portrayal of the hero's quiet love for his dying wife,
equally well rooted in the chambara tradition and especially evocative
of Tatsuya Nakadai oyabun's generous resignation to the emerging prior
claim on his wife that is left loyally unarticulated by his recovering
amnesiac retainer in Gosha's sublime _Hunter in the Dark_, both in
munificence of spirit and operatic surfeit of painstakingly suppressed
underlying emotion epitomize the Japanese Liebestod suggested by the
title, an indigenous plot device doubtless destined to be imitated but
unattained by callow American filmmakers.</P>
