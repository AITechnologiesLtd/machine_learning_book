<P>Venus Beauty Institute is a clumsy and unremarkable French film that's
either a run-of-the-mill chick flick, a caustic look at women's obsession
with beauty, or both.  Its main character is a desperate, middle-aged woman
who loves to strike up conversations with strangers, hoping they'll take her
to bed (or to their car, if there isn't a bed close by).  Maybe I missed the
boat on this one, being a 30-year-old abstinent male loner, so take the
following with a grain of salt.</P>
<P>Angèle (Nathalie Baye, An Affair of Love) works in a Parisian beauty shop,
where she provides facials, manicures and massages to those ravaged by both
age and gravity.  She's twice as old as her co-workers, doesn't wear makeup,
hates love and is terrified of relationships because of something that
happened to her parents when she was a child.  But Angèle still loves sex
and will spread for just about anyone after a couple of drinks.</P>
<P>It comes as no surprise when Angèle, who is used to stalking her own sexual
prey, is turned off when a man approaches her with romantic aspirations of
his own. Antoine (Samuel Le Bihan) is a sculptor who professes his undying
love for Angèle, despite having a fiancée.  Even though he's probably half
her age, Antoine is relentless in his pursuit of Angèle, no matter how
little interest she shows in him.  Because this is a movie, you know his
persistence will eventually pay off (in real life, she'd get a restraining
order and he'd be in jail).</P>
<P>As Angèle's relationship with Antoine plays out, we are also introduced to
her beauty shop co-workers and the wacky customers attendant thereto.
Everyone talks about looking young and beautiful, but they're all just as
emotionally broken as Angèle in one way or another.  The shop sells various
lotions, balms and ointments, and has an irritating door chime that, at
first, made it seem like something magical was about to happen on the screen
(it didn't...and then rings about 75 more times).  The not-so-subtle message
here is that people can shell out hundreds of francs for an expensive salve
to mask their exterior flaws, but it won't do a damn thing to cover up the
fact they're damaged on the inside.</P>
<P>Though Venus' ending is somewhat visually pleasing (sparks fly - literally)
and Baye does a good job playing the unhappy lead desperately clinging to
her youth, the film failed to strike an emotional chord.  It is refreshing
to see a movie that features women (both in front of and behind the camera)
refrains from bashing all men, like pictures of this ilk tend to do.  Baye
is 52 in real life, but can easily pass for Angèle's early 40s.</P>
<P>Venus was written and directed by French actress Tonie Marshall, who crams
the film's beauty shop scenes full of colorful pastels.  She adds some
unique camera angles and there are several interestingly edited segments,
but other than that and Baye's standout performance, there just isn't much
to gush about.  Venus did sweep through the 2000 César Awards (the French
version of the Oscars) like Ted Kennedy through happy hour, winning trophies
for Best Film, Director and Screenplay.</P>
