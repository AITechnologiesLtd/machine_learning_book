<P>     Twenty-eight years ago, Peter Fonda became a counter-culture icon in
EASY RIDER.  If you can name two other Peter Fonda films since then, you
have my deepest sympathies; it probably means you sat through delights
like WANDA NEVADA.  Anyone who remembers Peter Fonda on film probably
remembers him as Captain America, which is why it's so startling to see
him in ULEE'S GOLD.  The broad forehead, the determined chin and the stoic
demeanor are all eerily reminiscent of another film Fonda.  At some point
during the past three decades, Captain America turned into Tom Joad.</P>
<P>     It's not just in his physical appearance that Peter resembles Papa
Henry.  In ULEE'S GOLD, Peter Fonda gives the kind of intense and
introspective performance which characterized his father's best work.  He
plays Ulysses "Ulee" Jackson, a Florida beekeeper trying to hold together
the tattered remnants of his family.  With his son Jimmy (Tom Wood) in
prison and Jimmy's wife Helen (Christine Dunford) run off to parts
unknown, Ulee cares for his two granddaughters (Jessica Biel and Vanessa
Zima) and keeps to himself.  That is before a call from Jimmy informs Ulee
that Helen is in the company of Jimmy's old running buddies Eddie (Steven
Flynn) and Ferris (Dewey Weber), and possibly in trouble.</P>
<P>     At first, Helen's predicament does not move Ulee in the least.  One
of the riskier steps writer/director Victor Nunez takes is making Ulee
fairly unlikeable at the outset, and not unlikeable in that fussy,
irrascible but ultimately good-hearted Hollywood way.  Wartime experiences
in Vietnam, the death of his wife and the problems of Jimmy and Helen have
left Ulee scarred and emotionally repressed; even worse, they have left
him bitter and judgmental towards those he considers responsible for their
own tragedies, like Jimmy and Helen.  He no longer knows how to reach out
to help others, or how to accept help when someone like his kindly 
neighbor Connie ("Home Improvement's" Patricia Richardson) reaches out to
him.</P>
<P>     Like Nunez's 1993 gem RUBY IN PARADISE, ULEE'S GOLD is about a
journey of self-discovery, not exactly a high-concept premise.  Nunez's
particular gift as both a writer and a director is the ability to convey
the struggles of troubled souls without resorting to melodramatic
situations or hyperbolic speeches.  The most spectacular thing about Peter
Fonda's performance is exactly that it is so unspectacular, a textbook
study of dramatic economy.  We understand his survivor guilt in one weary
line to his granddaughter about how he made it out of Vietnam ("Your
grandpa was tricky"); we see the comfort he takes in his solitary labor as
extended sequences follow him through the harvesting of the tupelo honey.
This stubborn, driven, hard-working man is not entirely pleasant to be
around, but he's fascinating and thoroughly human.  Even when the plot
takes a turn into crime drama with the search for money from a long-ago
holdup, Nunez and Fonda don't take the plot or the character into
steely-eyed reluctant heroism.  The action in Fonda's lined face is more
compelling than a shootout in the swamps.</P>
<P>     ULEE'S GOLD is exactly the kind of film some people get suspicious
about when the critics go ga-ga, primarily because it is the kind of film
critics are _expected_ to go ga-ga over.  As a casually-paced,
character-driven drama in the middle of summer, it certainly stands out in
a crowd, but it is not a flawless masterpiece.  Nunez has a tendency to
devote almost all his creative energy to his main character, leaving his
supporting players far less to work with.  There are moments when ULEE'S
GOLD starts to wander, when the languid character interactions are merely
slow instead of meaningful.  Still, one fascinating, carefully-constructed
character is one more than almost any other film of the last few months
has taken the time to give us.  In a way, that makes ULEE'S GOLD just as
rebellious a film as EASY RIDER was in its time.  Maybe there's still a
streak of Captain America in Peter Fonda after all.</P>
