<P>A work (novel, movie, whatever) only gets the story-behind-the-story
treatment when it's been part of conventional knowledge for so long that the
audience gets all the little in-jokes, can appreciate the asides, the irony,
etc. To look at it another way, a work only gets the story-behind-the-story
treatment when it's been overdeveloped in so many other directions that
burrowing into the myth of its own origins is about all that's left. This is
what Shakespeare in Love does for Romeo and Juliet, what Love and War tries
to do for Farewell to Arms. This is also what the 13th Warrior tries to do
for Beowulf--to tell it from the POV of a minor/forgotten participant in the
'actual' event, of which Beowulf is a loose retelling. The thing is,
however, Shakespeare in Love had the advantage of coming right on the heels
of 199x's Romeo + Juliet, meaning the play was still fresh in our minds, we
were already piqued for a little more iambic pentameter, please. The 13th
Warrior doesn't have such an advantage: disregarding the recent
sci-fiBeowulf (not released in America),there's been nothing to leave us
hungry for Old English, mead, all that.
Writer/director Michael Crichton (along with Diehard's John McTiernan) was
likely aware of this poor timing, too, so, for the big screen, this
adaptation of his historical novel Eaters of the Dead draws more on, say,
the enthematic swordplay of Braveheart, the 'good fight' against-all-odds
feel of Starship Troopers, and, further back, all the Dungeons &
Dragons-type movies (Flesh and Blood(1985), Excaliber, etc.) which also
manage to assemble a rag-tag group into some honorable world-saving
campaign.
In The 13th Warrior, that rag-tag group is composed of twelve Viking
volunteers, plus the initially-reluctant exiled Arabian poet Ibn Fadlan
(Antonio Banderas). The world this group has to save is a village in
Scandinavia. What they have to save the village from are creatures of
legend--eaters of the dead. Which is to say transgressors of one of our most
fundamental taboos: cannibalism. And, when fighting cannibals, you're
automatically the good guy, which is how Crichton manages to erase any
raping and pillaging Eric the Viking-type associations, making the
campaigners honorable. In addition, though--or, to really establish the bad
guys' inhumanity--the bad guys are never really personified, which makes Ibn
Fadlen and Co.'s series of skirmishes with them impersonal, as it would be
with a mass of animals. And this isn't necessarily a weakness, but more of
an identification trick: the bad guys are as dark and mysterious to us as
they are to Ibn Fadlan and Co. It does have a flipside, though: when the
battle gets pared down to the individual level, it doesn't have that same
finality you get with, say, Conan and Thulsa-Doom. Meaning we're not sure
it's over when it is, in fact, over.
If that was the only flaw, The 13th Warrior could possibly be a great movie.
But there's more. There's the castle-intrigue in the opening sequence, which
establishes so little that it's never mentioned again. There's Ibn Fadlan's
love interest in the village they're saving, which feels tacked on. There's
Antonio Banderas playing a devout Muslim. There's some unwisely foregrounded
translation difficulty (Old English to Latin, then Latin to Arabian, which
is cinematically rendered in English, etc) which slows things down
considerably. On the plus side, though, there is a lot of flashy AD&D-type
sword and horseplay, there's an ancient woman who talks with Yoda-syntax
('Seek you me?'), and there's even something of a transformation in Ibn
Fadlan, which allows him to put pen to paper again, write that epic. More
than all that, though, what The 13th Warrior leaves you with is a distinct
nostalgia, not for a period in history that's lost, but for a period in
history that never really was, at least as it's presented on-screen. Which
is to say it does get us to buy its illusion, if only for a while.
