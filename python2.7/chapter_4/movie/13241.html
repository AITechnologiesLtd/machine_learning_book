<P>HENRY FOOL (Sony Pictures Classics) Directed by Hal Hartley
Simon can feel something's on the way. Standing in the street near his
home in Queens, Simon puts his ear to the ground and picks up the sound
of Henry's footsteps, coming steadily down the street. The peripatetic
Henry brings with him a message, part of which is revealed in the first
words he says to Simon: "Get up off your knees."</P>
<P>Aptly named, Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) is a garbageman whose mouth is
a frozen frown. With his rigid hair, unflattering glasses and mousy
manner, Simon is the kind of man who feels he has to tell people "I'm
not retarded," since his demeanor suggests otherwise. Henry Fool (Thomas
Jay Ryan) is Simon's polar opposite, a verbose, passionate wanderer who
seeks out new worlds to conquer. Henry is in the process of writing his
"confession," a multi-volume autobiography that he promises will "blow a
hole right through the world's own idea of itself" when it's published,
and, at Henry's urging, Simon puts pencil to paper and creates a poem so
controversial it divides first his community, then the literary world.</P>
<P>"Henry Fool," which won writer-director Hal Hartley the prize for Best
Screenplay at this year's Cannes Film Festival, is a deft, sometimes
perplexing comedy-drama that stubbornly refuses to bow to convention or
to soft-sell its darker, more upsetting aspects in the name of drawing a
wider audience. And why compromise anyway? It's stories like this one
that put the "independent" back into "independent film."</P>
<P>Hartley has crafted a demanding, sometimes funny, sometimes bleak tale
of a houseful of people thrown off-balance by fate's unexpected twists
and turns. In the beginning, Simon is the kind of guy who appears to
have never gotten a break in life: He always looks like someone has just
offended him. Henry, with the quizzical face of a big suspicious cat and
eyes like lasers, sees the potential within this underachiever and
forces it out. Simon's loud-mouthed, promiscuous sister Fay (Parker
Posey) likes to pretend she's much younger and sexier than she really
is, and she's perturbed when Henry doesn't automatically make advances
on her. Fay and Simon's mother (Maria Porter) spends most of her days
stretched out on the couch, although it's never clear if she's actually
sick or just a hypochondriac who wants attention. By the time the
quartet's story wraps up, nearly a decade later, personalities will have
evolved, fortunes will have reversed and births, deaths and disclosed
secrets will have changed everyone markedly.</P>
<P>Ryan, in his film debut, is made to walk a thin line. Henry has a
florid manner of speech that suggests an overeager salesman, and his
penchant for posing is reminiscent of a self-involved drama student
who's always "on." The temptation in creating such a personality is to
play him like, well, a fool. But Henry must also serve as the core of
the movie, the sun around which all the space cadets revolve. Ryan
manages to have it both ways, letting us see just enough of what's
beneath Henry's bluster to make his character arc seem credible.</P>
<P>An even greater challenge falls to Urbaniak, who must come up with a
way to make the often silent, vaguely menacing-looking Simon someone the
audience can identify with on a certain level. Urbaniak finds the key in
Simon's resilience, the fact that even though he's stuck in an awful
situation, he's putting up with it because he feels responsible for his
family. "Henry Fool" also marks a new high point in the meteoric career
of Posey, whose Fay matures from bratty slut into hard-won womanhood
with humor and pathos.</P>
<P>Hartley's script always catches the viewer a little off-guard.
Everytime you think "Henry Fool" is about to settle into a safe comedic
groove, it takes a tragic or shocking detour, and just when the movie
starts to seem morose, Hartley throws in a bit of off-the-wall humor.
There's also a strain of satire running below the surface, as evidenced
by recurring references to a Congressman who claims to be devoted to
restoring American morals: His most vocal supporter turns out to be a
former drug dealer who beats his wife and daughter while praising his
candidate's high ideals. "Henry Fool" seems slightly overlong at 138
minutes, but it's difficult to come up with much material that could be
easily trimmed. That, in and of itself, is a pretty high compliment to
Hartley and his outstanding cast.
