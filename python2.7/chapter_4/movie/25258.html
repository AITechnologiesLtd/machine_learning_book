<P>     You don't have to be a baseball fan to love Aviva Kempner's 
documentary about legendary Detroit Tiger slugger Hank Greenberg, though 
it probably helps.</P>
<P>     Greenberg wasn't the first Jewish player to reach the majors, but 
he was the first to achieve stardom without downplaying his religion, 
and it made him the idol of American Jews in the decade when Hitler was 
stoking his cauldron of hate in Germany, and anti-Semitism was 
conspicuously alive and well in this country too.  Greenberg played in 
Detroit, home of such major league bigots as Henry Ford and the infamous 
Father Coughlin.  He filled the star void left by the departure of 
all-time Tiger great and world-class sonofabitch Ty Cobb.</P>
<P>     Greenberg was 6'4", with muscles like Paul Bunyan, and he muted the 
jeers of "kike" and "sheeny" with an awesome barrage of homers and RBIs. 
 His average never fell below .300 till his last year with the Tigers, 
after he'd returned from four years in WWII.  He was twice the American 
League's most valuable player, and that didn't include the year ('37) 
when he drove in 183 runs, one shy of Gehrig's record, or the year ('38) 
when he electrified baseball with his 58 homers, two short of the 
immortal Bambino's mark.  He was baseball's first $100,000 man. </P>
<P>    "He may have been the single most important Jew to live in the 
1930s," says Alan Dershowitz.  "I thought he'd be the first Jewish 
president." </P>
<P>     Greenberg wasn't an observant Jew, but he was a proud one.  In his 
second year with the Tigers he agonized over whether to play on Rosh 
Hashanah.  A Detroit rabbi sent him a Talmudic passage that okayed it, 
and Hankus Spankus walloped two homers to win a 2-0 game (the rabbi, a 
baseball fan, later admitted he'd fudged his interpretation.) When he 
declined to play on Yom Kippur, the poet Edgar Guest saluted him in the 
Detroit paper:</P>
<P>"We shall miss him in the infield, we shall miss him at the bat,</P>
<P>"He is true to his religion, and I honor him for that."</P>
<P>     Aviva Kempner's labor of love took her 14 years, beginning with 
interviews with the great man shortly before his death in '86.  She 
talked to teammates, opponents, sportswriters, and fans, and dug out 
vintage baseball film and Mandy Patinkin's Yiddish "Take Me Out to the 
Ballgame" for the soundtrack.  She clutters things a bit with extraneous 
footage from Hollywood baseball movies, and sometimes her narrative 
drive slumps.  It's not great filmmaking, but it's an impassioned 
treatment of a great subject.</P>
<P>     Poetically, Hank Greenberg ended his career with the Pirates in 
'47, bringing him to the National League the year Jackie Robinson broke 
in.  "I didn't know what having it bad was till I saw what happened to 
Robinson," he said.</P>
