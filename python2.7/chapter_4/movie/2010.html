<PRE>                                  DAMAGE
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>1:54, unrated version (NC-17 version), Drama, 1993
Director: Louis Malle
Cast: Jeremy Irons, Juliette Binoche, Miranda Richardson, Rupert Graves,
      Ian Bannen, Peter Stormare, Gemma Clarke, Julian Fellowes, Leslie Caron</P>
<P>     Jeremy Irons is having an obsessive affair with Juliette Binoche.
Binoche falls in love with Rupert Graves, Irons's son.  As Binoche and
Graves relationship gets more and more serious, Irons tries to end it.</P>
<P>     DAMAGE is an incredibly slow-moving boring film that is a complete
waste of time.  I can't recommend this film to anyone, unless you enjoy
watching grass grow in the dark.  DAMAGE is now available on
videocassette in two versions, the R rated theatrical version that runs
for 1:50 and the unrated (original NC-17 version) that runs for 1:54
(the version that I am reviewing).  On a scale of zero to five, I give
DAMAGE a zero (too bad it doesn't go lower).  DAMAGE is unrated and
contains female nudity, brief male nudity, adult situations, and
explicit language.</P>
<P>     Louis Malle, the director of the good film PRETTY BABY, has made a
real loser of a film.  Hopefully this film will be a low point in his
career.  Jeremy Irons (whom I have heard is a good actor) was not at
all impressive in this film.  The only way to describe his acting is
wooden and uninspired.  Juliette Binoche (a newcomer to films I
believe) also didn't do a good job.  She didn't ever seem to be with
this film.  Miranda Richardson (who did such a good job in the recent
THE CRYING GAME) is not at all interesting in this film.  I was very
disappointed, especially considering she received an academy award
nomination for best supporting actress.  Rupert Graves (WHERE ANGELS
FEAR TO TREAD) does the best job out of the cast.  He seemed to put
some life into his role.</P>
<P>     This film is poorly written and moves along slowly.  The
characters are boring and invoke no interest from the viewer.  I have
something to say about the "hot and steamy" sex scenes too, they were
neither hot or steamy.  Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche have about as
much sexual chemistry as two eggs.  The sex scenes look fake and are
erotic in no way.  If you are looking for a good erotic drama, may I
suggest THE BLUE LAGOON with Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins or
WILD ORCHID with Mickey Rourke and Carre Otis.  And if you are looking
for a well done film, may I suggest that you just skip this one.</P>
