<P>Cranky Critic® Reviews: Stigmata
Starring Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne, Jonathan Pryce
Screenplay by Tom Lazarus and Rick Ramage
Directed by Rupert Wainwright

<P>IN SHORT: A great commercial for a non-scary flick.</P>
<P>If you were fascinated by the Stigmata television commercial, try to
imagine watching 60 straight minutes of it. That editing overkill is
what stops Stigmata dead in its tracks as a movie. If it were a
mathematical formula, Stigmata would = (Blade - vampires) + (The
Exorcist - pea soup and obscenity) / story. Drawing heavily from
Christian mysticism and attacking the inner political construction of
the Roman Catholic church, Stigmata spends more time allowing director
Rupert Wainwright to show off his photographic knowledge and editing
chops than it does on the story. Cranky was ready to yell at the screen
"Hey! It's story time already" when just enough intrigue dribbled out to
keep his attention focussed for a few more minutes. Unfortunately it was
way too little, far too late.</P>
<P>Stigmata features a lot of effects -- levitation, blood, fire -- and
one, true mystery: how is it that the wounds of Christ manifest
themselves on the body of a cute blonde resident of Pittsburgh, PA? The
Vatican has a special section, the Special Congregation for the Causes
of Saints -- whose job it is to investigate religious mysteries and its
Cardinal Houseman (Jonathan Pryce) dispatches Father Andrew Kiernan
(Gabriel Byrne) to investigate.  This is the second investigation
Kiernan does in this movie, the first involving a South American statue
of the Virgin Mary that weeps tears of human blood. There's a tenuous
link between the two, but I'll leave that for you to discover.</P>
<P>When Kiernan finds the lovely Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette), his
investigation ends almost as quickly as it begin, for Frankie is not a
member of the True Church. That means she, and her wounds, is of no
interest to his section. But Frankie speaks in tongues -- turns out to
be the kind of Aramaic spoken 2000 years ago in Galilee -- and has
scribbled strange characters on the walls of her loft. They, too, are
Aramaic, and the words therein are part of a hidden document that could
shake the theosophical nature of the Vatican to its core.</P>
<P>Stigmata features a gorgeous first hour of photographic effects and
heavy duty editing over a soundtrack of techno-heavy metal music. for
purposes of this film, it is constantly raining in Pittsburgh, which
means lots of slow motion shots of water dripping and plopping. The
Catholic Church being loaded with symbols and icons, this film also goes
heavy on symbolic things whose meaning is quite beyond the knowledge of
this Member of the Tribe. What I do know is that Stigmata is based on
two fragments (part of phrase 3 and the latter half of phrase 77) of the
Dead Sea Scroll called The Gospel of Thomas, which this film has used to
create a "new" text that is even more heretical than the "Thomas".
Anyone that has studied the Dead Sea Scrolls (Cranky pleads guilty) can
tell you that there are lots of tempting heretical bits and pieces that
would fascinate anyone that has even a mild knowledge of Christianity.
Stigmata drowns any interesting mystery in so much visual nonsense that
it defeats the purpose of any movie, to tell a good and interesting
story. There is a story here, but it's buried way too deep. And, of
course, time is wasted while the priest is tempted by the blonde . Been
there, done that.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Stigmata, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$3.00</PRE>
<P>Rental level. Oh, yeah. The Gospel of Thomas is attributed to Didymos
Judas Thomas, founder of the Eastern Church and Twin Brother of Jesus.
Told ya it was a good bit of heretical bit info. Theoretically, the
Gospel of Mary is even worse, 'cuz it strips the Vatican of any
authority as guardian and sole arbiter of the Word. But that's a story
for a different movie.</P>
