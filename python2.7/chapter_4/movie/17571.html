<P>Doug Funnie (voice of Thomas McHugh), the 12-year-old star of Jim
Jinkins's ABC and Nickelodeon animated series _Doug_, indeed has his
first film, but if there's to be a second, he'd best find a vehicle more
interesting to flesh-and-blood moviegoers over his age.  As it is,
_Doug's_1st_Movie_, in which Doug and his friend Skeeter (Fred Newman)
befriend a gentle monster from a polluted lake, is a suitable
entertainment for its target audience.  It's simple, good-natured, and
tackles an environmental theme with an admirable lack of preachiness. 
That said, for adults, the film is pleasant but hopelessly vanilla. 
While the film will hush up the kids for its lean 77 minutes, but the
older ones in the audience (read: parents) will find their attention
wandering elsewhere.  Still, families can do worse for a night at the
movies...</P>
<P>...such as Warner Bros.'s curious animated version of Rodgers and
Hammerstein's venerable musical _The_King_and_I_.  Since animation is the
only medium in which the movie musical is still alive and kicking, using
the form to adapt a successful stage production is a natural and
undeniably intriguing extension.  Plus, there is no need to worry about
coming up with snappy tunes when there is a tried-and-true score at one's
disposal.  (And, indeed, the classic songs "I Have Dreamed" and "Shall We
Dance?" are a pleasure to hear in this film, as they would in any
setting.)</P>
<P>Yet this _King_and_I_ is the most stupefyingly incompetent animated
feature to reach the big screen in recent memory--even worse than
Warner's misfire of last year, _Quest_for_Camelot_.   Like _Quest_,
_King_ features some ragged, Saturday morning-level artwork and animation
(granted, so does _Doug's_1st_Movie_, but at least there it's more or
less intentional) and some clumsily integrated (to say the least)
computer-generated effects.  But while I can see how the flighty _Quest_
could divert the young ones in the audience, _King_ is a film with no
clear audience.</P>
<P>The story is still basically the same: sometime in the 19th century,
British teacher Anna Leonowens (spoken by Miranda Richardson, sung by
Christiane Noll) develops a warm friendship with the initially icy King
of Siam (Martin Vidnovic) while tutoring his many children.  But, in
accordance with the Disney mold, director Richard Rich has given the tale
more kid-friendly trappings.  Toning down the material is not necessarily
a bad thing--witness Disney's triumphant, underappreciated
_The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame_--but here the material is _dumbed_ down;
the addition of cuddly animal companions, portly comic sidekicks, a
sorcery-using villain, and a ridiculous action climax simply distract and
never feel like necessary and natural outgrowths of the source story. 
(_Hunchback_'s wisecracking gargoyle device didn't always work, but for
the most part, it was convincingly handled--as possibly being a figment
of Quasimodo's imagination.)  Hence, adults who are engaged by the basic
story and the music will likely be annoyed by the obligatory kiddie
concessions.  </P>
<P>But what about these kids, for whom the alterations were made?  The
broad comedy garnered some giggles from the children in my audience, but
most of the time I heard a lot of murmuring, some whining, and I felt a
general sense of antsiness.  This is because the story of Anna and the
King, while all-ages-appropriate, is a mature, subtly cerebral one.  And
the lushly orchestrated Rodgers and Hammerstein tunes, while timeless
standards, aren't exactly of the bouncy, "Hakuna Matata"-like jingle type
that leaves kids humming on the way out of the theatre.</P>
<P>Animating any traditional Broadway musical makes for an intriguing
experiment, and indeed _The_King_and_I_ is one--albeit in the wrong,
train wreck-like sort of way.  Based on this disastrous result, one can
only hope that Warner Bros., which holds the feature film rights to
Andrew Lloyd Webber's _The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_, doesn't decide to
sidestep the casting controversy and opt to go the animated route.</P>
