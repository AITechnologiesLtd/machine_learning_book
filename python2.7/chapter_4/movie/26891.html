<PRE>RUGRATS IN PARIS
A film review by James Brundage

<P>Well, the Rugrats are back, and, as usual, they're way too sophisticated
for their audience.  The Simpsons of the Nickelodeon Network has
meandered its way back onto the big screen, and this time they are
hitting the streets of Paris with more Freudian slips than a
sexually-charged first date.</P>
<P>To start with, Grandpa Lou has gotten remarried (leading into, by the
way, an excellent parody of The Godfather in the first scene) and all
Chuckie wants is a mommy.  Meanwhile, Stu Pickles gets a call from Paris
demanding that he come to fix a giant mechanical Reptar (a wonderful
running Godzilla/Pokemon spoof gag from the series) which he designed.</P>
<P>After discovering the mommy button on an airplane (the flight attendant
button), Chuckie decides that Paris is the perfect place to find a new
mommy.  The group proceeds to EuroReptarLand, where we discover that one
Coco LaBouche (Susan Sarandon) needs to become a mother so she can move
ahead in the Japanese conglomerate for which she works (oh, all the
feminist implications one can see in this).  Manipulative as Coco is,
she decides to romance Chuckie's dad via her secretary Kira's knowledge
of childrearing.</P>
<P>>From here on in the plot flows predictably, and the movie inserts its
share of both lowbrow puns and intelligent humor throughout the entire
film, making for a satisfactory viewing experience... a kid's movie the
rest of us can stand (or even enjoy).</P>
<P>Of course Rugrats in Paris is hardly exemplary.  It lacks the witty
parodies of the first Rugrats film, and goes for too many
fart-and-diaper jokes that are strictly kids-only.  The show would
better serve itself to go completely the route of The Simpsons and
dropping all pretense of being kiddie fare, instead using its writers'
satiric wit for all it's worth.  But, as the Rugrats franchise will be
raking in quite a few pretty pennies, don't expect anything like that to
happen anytime soon.  Instead, expect that these movies will gradually
get less and less intelligent, until one day Rugrats is nothing more
than just another one of those dumb kid's movies you can't stand.</P>
