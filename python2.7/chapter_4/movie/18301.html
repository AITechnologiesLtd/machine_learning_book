<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</P>
<P>Who would have thought that a film about Sarah Michelle Gellar learning
how to cook would be as fun and amusing as Simply Irresistible?  Yup,
it's true.  Long time producer Mark Tarlov reveals a lively energy in
his first attempt as a director and creates a film that is, pretty much,
irresistible.  It would be pretentious to consider any of this film's
elements as fresh or original, but they certainly feel that way thanks
to Geller's appealing performance and Tarlov's direction.  The film
comes together very well, with a cute central romance that is a nice
blend of passion and fun, with a little touch of magic thrown in for
good measure.</P>
<P>Amanda Shelton (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the owner and chef of a small,
homely restaurant that she inherited from her mother.  The restaurant is
about to go bust because Shelton's cooking skills leave a lot to be
desired.  Tom Bartlett (Sean Patrick Flanery) is a suave executive for a
famous department store, and the two first meet at a food market thanks
to help of a mysterious crab seller.  Sure enough, they bump into each
other again and love is in the air.  Suddenly, Shelton can now cook, and
cook very well.  Her dishes are so irresistible that Bartlett's boss
(Dylan Baker) chooses Shelton to cook for an important corporate dinner
at the launch of a new department restaurant.  Shelton begins to grasp
her unique ability to evoke emotion through her food, and an outrageous
night of chaotic dining unfolds.</P>
<P>Simply Irresistible is film colored by bright and adorable performances
and shaped by a screenplay that never makes the mistake of taking itself
too seriously.  The relationship between Shelton and Bartlett is too
shallow to be believable, but it's a cute bit of fantasy fluff that
doesn't feel dated or too modern.  Though sometimes frustrating in its
simplicity - the film purposely frustrates viewers by prolonging the
final get together - watching Gellar and Flanery in these flatteringly
good-natured roles is a treat.  Simply Irrisistible is a surprisingly
enjoyable picture with a kind-hearted temperament and a sweet,
sentimental aftertaste.  It restores faith that there is a little bit of
magic in life that, like love, doesn't always make a lot of sense.
Neither does this film, I suppose, but you won't hear me complaining.</P>
