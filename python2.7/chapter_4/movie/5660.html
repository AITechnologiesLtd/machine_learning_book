<PRE>                               A TIME TO KILL
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Remember the hoopla over the novel "A Time To Kill"?  It was
celebrated author John Grisham's second book -- actually his *first* book
-- the book he published after "The Firm" became a hit.  The book that no
one wanted before he was famous.  The book, apparently, that, if it hadn't
had his name on it, would never have been published.</P>
<P>     Now it's the fourth Grisham movie to be made, continuing in grand
fashion that franchise of increasingly average film versions of his
increasingly average writing.</P>
<P>     In fact, A TIME TO KILL is the *most* average of all of these films,
and it hinges on two vital elements:  if you take a book written by John
Grisham and throw in Sandra Bullock in a see-thru tank top, you've got
yourself a hit!  And the producers are probably right.</P>
<P>     The story is so simple it barely merits retelling here:  A young girl
is raped.  Her father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), faster than you
can yell "Oswald!", murders the two rednecks responsible.  Young upstart
lawyer Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey, playing the most-pumped-up
lawyer of all time) defends him, with a little pro bono help (if you catch
my drift) from Ellen Roark (the tank-topped Bullock).  Bad guy Rufus
Buckley (Kevin Spacey) prosecutes.  And good ol' boy Judge Noose (get it?)
(Patrick McGoohan) presides.</P>
<P>     Never has a 145 minute film been less thrilling and more predictable.
>From a continuity standpoint, it makes absolute perfect sense why each
scene follows another.  From an audience standpoint, this is *terribly*
boring.  Sure, A TIME TO KILL has some frightening imagery (particularly of
the KKK uprising) and some great speeches (Brigance's closing argument
brings everyone on the screen to tears, and probably some of the audience,
too), but you can't overcome a limp plot with that stuff.</P>
<P>     I suppose that's where Bullock's clothing comes in.  And another thing
-- why is everyone so *sweaty* in every scene?  I know this is the deep
South, but they do have air-conditioning in Mississippi, don't they?  And
why doesn't Brigance ever light his cigar?  Little questions... but
annoying ones.</P>
<P>     Who knows the answers?  Who cares?  Fine performances all around,
typical Joel Schumacher direction, and a nice analysis of Southern race
relations make for a movie that is simply indescribable as anything other
than...</P>
<PRE>     Average.</PRE>
