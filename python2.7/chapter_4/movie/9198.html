<PRE>                          THE LAST SUPPER 1995
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
               :-( :-( :-( :-(  for a deluded dinner party</PRE>
<P>Cast: Cameron Diaz, Courtney B. Vance, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner,
Ron Eldard, Nora Dunn, Ron Perlman Director: Stacy Title Screenplay: Dan
Rosen</P>
<P>The question posed to the viewer. If able to journey into the past to
kill Adolf Hitler, would you do it?</P>
<P>This group of supposedly intelligent college graduates (see above cast),
with very liberal views would. As a result they have decided to rid the
world of all the would be Adolf Hitlers. Namely people who are harmless,
but politically incorrect in their eyes. Reverends not sympathetic to
the HIV cause; war veteran racists; male chauvinistic pigs; the
illiterate who have no appreciation for "Catcher in the Rye";
anti-abortionists; and a school girl with qualms about sexual education.</P>
<P>This meal is particularly distasteful, as we watch these college
graduates become the person who they hate most - Hitler himself. What
gives them the right to decide who lives and who dies. There is no
victory or satisfaction in watching people murdered at the dining table,
just because they have a different perception to life than what is
considered the norm. Although the grads realise their mistake in the
end, it doesn't make the viewer any happier that they had to kill eleven
people to find this out. Now if they had truly understood the full
meaning of "The Lord's Supper", words like forgiveness, tolerance and
compassion would have been extended to their guests instead of a bottle
of wine laced with arsenic.</P>
