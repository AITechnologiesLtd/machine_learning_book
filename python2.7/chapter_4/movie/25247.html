<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>There have been very few films about the American Revolution and most of
them have been terrible, with the exception of D.W. Griffith's 1924 epic
"America." German director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day/Godzilla)
and screenwriter Robert Rodat (he also scripted "Saving Private Ryan")
combine to work their mindless view of history on this corny, flag
waving, dumb film, which tries to make the American Revolution fit into
the politically correct thinking of the 21st century. They make this
story into a personal revenge movie and pull all the strings out for
popular consumption. At least, they kept it moving at a brisk pace, but,
unfortunately, they used a good deal of violence. There were a multitude
of choreographed battle scenes, face-to-face combat scenes, and sweeping
panoramic shots of the beautiful countryside, which should take your
mind off all the empty messages of the film. The filmmaker even made
slavery appear as not such a bad thing by having the slaves seem more
like workers than slaves, they just seemed to be having themselves a
good old time on the plantation. When the 158-minutes are up, you might
not have much of an historical perspective of the war, but you should
feel good that the arch villain got his just desserts.</P>
<P>The Revoluntionary War in 1776 brings a South Carolina farmer, Ben
Martin (Mel Gibson), who is a widower with seven children eventually
into the conflict, against his anti-war feelings. The forty-something
aged farmer is reluctant to go to war after becoming a hero in the
previous French and Indian war, where a bloody massacre at Fort
Wilderness occurred that he wants to forget about.</P>
<P>His reason for getting pulled into this war is personal. When his
headstrong son Gabriel (Heath) comes home wounded from the war and the
British soldiers come to his plantation to fetch him, Mel's other
teenage son Thomas (Gregory Smith) is unnecessarily shot when he tries
to release Gabriel, who is told that he will be hung. Then, Mel's house
is torched by the mean-spirited villain in the film, British Colonel
Tavington (Isaacs).</P>
<P>The colonel's villain role is about as one-dimensional and predictable
as it gets for such a villain, whereby he becomes more cartoonish and
less menacing as the story rolls on. Somewhere after the halfway point
in this epic (sic!), Mel tells him that he's going to kill him and it
then becomes a matter of how. And there you have the plot, which is not
much on history and not much on character development.</P>
<P>Mel becomes known to the British as "The Ghost" after he kills twenty of
them in an ambush of the patrol bringing Gabriel to the British command,
where he is to be hung. Mel gets the help of his young boys to shoot the
officers, while he gets a chance to use his Cherokee tomahawk from the
French and Indian war to hack the soldiers to death. After that attack,
Mel sends the kids to stay with his wife's sister and he joins with his
old friend Col. Harry Burwell (Chris Cooper) and leads the local militia
in guerilla-type attacks against the British patrols. He becomes a
growing menace to the Redcoats  - so much so, that even General
Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson) orders that he must be captured by any means
possible.</P>
<P>Everything is so predictable about this glossy photographed film,
everything is so banal, everything seems so dishonest, and the dialogue
is so disparaging, that I found this to be such a morbid attempt at
history, such a futile way to tell a story. And the story itself is a
questionable one, since the Mel Gibson character is loosely based on
Francis Marion, whom historians credit with being a racist.</P>
<P>Everything from the acting and the script was flat. The obligatory
romance Mel has with his wife's sister (Joely), simply had no magic in
it. Everyone was reduced to a cardboard figure, and the war seemed to be
a manufactured one, as if this film was made as a TV episode. The story
lacked vitality, only scoring points for its fine costumes and John
Williams musical score. The film always seemed to be an unhealthy
mixture of mawkishness and carnality, offering nothing but shallow
responses for all its preaching about freedom. No scene seemed truly
honest; the most honest scene is when Mel is embracing his children and
the most dishonest, is showing him with the Negroes who just love being
his slaves.</P>
<P>This film resembles those other exploitive Mel Gibson movies, where
someone dear to him gets hurt and he gets revenge. Only this film comes
with some bogus history lesson thrown in, which makes it more shamefully
exploitive, a "Payback " with the Redcoats as the gangsters. I had an
ugly feeling when I left the theater, like someone was trying awfully
hard to sell me on patriotism: using children, the flag, a horrid
villain, all to shamelessly stir me up, instead of telling me a story
about a credible character who got involved in the War for Independence.</P>
