<P>     APARAJITO, the middle installment of legendary Indian film maker 
Satyajit Ray's APU TRILOGY, follows his 1955 debut, PATHER PANCHALI, and 
precedes 1959's THE WORLD OF APU.  Although PATHER PANCHALI is a study 
of near-perfect cinematic style and exquisite emotional insight, 
APARAJITO lifts Ray's talents to new levels.  The word "masterpiece" is 
certainly overused, but this is one instance when it is deserved.</P>
<P>     When APARAJITO opens in 1920, Apu (Pinaki Sengupta) and his 
parents, Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee) and Sarbojaya (Karuna Bannerjee), are 
living in the city of Banaras, where they moved following the events of 
PATHER PANCHALI.  In Banaras, along the banks of the holy Ganges River, 
Harihar, a Brahmin priest, recites Hindu scriptures to earn a living, 
while Sarbojaya attends to their home.  Apu, like any typical child, 
spends his time running off to play with his friends.  In the early 
sequences of APARAJITO, Ray paints a memorable picture of the city and 
its culture -- Banaras is a place where the ordinary and the majestic 
blend seamlessly together.  Shots of the sacred steps and the men 
immersing themselves in the river are among the movie's most lasting 
images.</P>
<P>     Tragedy strikes when Harihar falls ill, then dies.  Suddenly, Apu 
and Sarbojaya are left alone, without means of support.  After working 
as a cook for a wealthy man in Banaras, Sarbojaya and Apu move to the 
Bengali village of Mansapata to live with her uncle.  There, Apu begins 
attending school, and quickly becomes a top student.  After several 
years, Apu (now played by Smaran Ghosal) is offered the opportunity to 
continue his education in Calcutta, but he is concerned that his mother 
will forbid his leaving home.</P>
<P>     APARAJITO was filmed forty years ago, half way around the world, 
yet the themes and emotions embedded in the narrative are strikingly 
relevant to modern Western society (thus explaining why it is called a 
"timeless classic").  While watching this film, who doesn't nod 
knowingly when Sarbojaya carefully packs Apu's suitcase before his trip, 
adding a jar of home made butter and pleading with him to write soon?  
And how familiar is it when mother and son meet after a long separation, 
and her first comment is that he has grown taller and doesn't appear to 
be eating well?  One aspect of Ray's mastery is that, even though he 
creates unique worlds for his stories, the films' basic, universal 
truths allow them to speak directly to the hearts of each viewer.</P>
<P>     The overriding theme of APARAJITO is that nothing is static -- life 
is about change and discovery.  In PATHER PANCHALI, the characters and 
settings are much the same throughout.  Here, supporting characters and 
locations are in a continual state of flux.  The only constant is 
Sarbojaya; even Apu undergoes a visible metamorphosis as the younger 
actor gives way to the older one.  </P>
<P>     It is an undeniable fact of life that children grow up and move 
away.  And, though their motives in turning their back on their homes 
are not necessarily unkind, their actions may appear selfish.  Such is 
the case in APARAJITO.  As Apu leaves for Calcutta, he is excited about 
the future, and barely gives a thought to the mother he leaves behind.  
For her part, she puts on a brave face for his sake, but, the moment his 
back is turned, the mask crumbles, revealing her fear and loneliness.  
With her husband dead and her son gone, Sarbojaya has nothing left to 
live for.  Especially during the film's closing half-hour, her scenes 
are poignantly realized.  The emotional conflict between her despondence 
and Apu's exhilaration creates a powerful dichotomy that is only bridged 
in APARAJITO's closing moments.  I can't say enough about the strength 
of Karuna Bannerjee's performance, not only in the concluding act, but 
throughout both of Ray's first two movies.</P>
<P>     APARAJITO is an amazing motion picture.  Its rich, poetic 
composition is perfectly wed to the sublime emotional resonance of the 
narrative.  For those who have seen PATHER PANCHALI, APARAJITO provides 
a nearly-flawless continuation of the journey begun there.  Yet, for 
those who missed Ray's earlier effort, this film loses none of its 
impact.  On its own or as part of the APU TRILOGY, APARAJITO should not 
be missed.</P>
