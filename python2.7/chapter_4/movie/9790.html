<PRE>                    THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE</PRE>
<PRE>BAD!</PRE>
<P>Every year there are some bad movies but they usually involve
non-stars.  That Bill Murray should be in a film that is so bad is
pitiful.  It is not alone the story; it is Murray himself who has
grown chubby in the face, looks dissipated but still tries to exude
the boyish charm and glib speech for which he has been noted lo
these many years.  You cannot keep doing that; it palls.</P>
<P>The story reeks of contrivance.   Wallace (Bill Murray) is a video
store clerk from Iowa.  Flying to London to celebrate his birthday
with his wealthy brother James (Peter Gallagher) he is treated to a
surprise by James who takes him to a "Theater of Life" where the
audience gets into the act and takes on a role.    Wallace takes it
seriously and is soon unable to distinguish the participatory part
of the theater with real life.   Not very funny.</P>
<P>When Wallace takes a phone call, it is a wrong number call which
should have gone to government-hired assassins who wants to overthrow
the current British government and start another cold war with
Russia.  Wallace becomes involved with this assassination group.
He thinks it is part of the acting he is doing.  Are you still with
me?   This is as far as I will go.</P>
<PRE>Joanne Walley is wasted in the film.</PRE>
<PRE>It took two writers to write this mess of a screenplay:
                 Robert Farrar and Howard Franklin.</PRE>
<PRE>It took only one director:
                              Jon Ami</PRE>
