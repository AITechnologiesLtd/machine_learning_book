Dareh</PRE>
<P>   Political hacks who are appointed by repressive
governments are not generally known to be intellectuals, so
that if writers, or playwrights, or filmmakers want to get
something critical past the censors, they'd better disguise
their allegorical works as non-political.  A good example of
Jean Anouilh's 1943 adaptation of Sophocles' tragedy,
"Antigone," about a young woman who rebels against her
uncle, the king.  Assumed by Nazi officials to be simply a
retelling of an old legend, this French drama was known by
every intelligent person in the audience to be critical of the
German occupation during the War.  When a oppressive
theocracy was set up in Iran during the 1960s there was
some question about the role of cinema and how the movies
could fit in with the fundamentalist Islamic society.  Abbas
Kiarostami has so far been able to pass muster with the
censors who presumably consider his films of no threat to the
regime.</P>
<P>   However Kiarostami's latest work, "The Wind Will Carry Us"
(whose title is taken from a poem about the beauty of nature
and the wonder of life), can readily be taken as a parable
about the regime currently in power in Iran, but its political
meaning is dwarfed by a more philosophic meditation about
nothing less than life and death.  At the same time the
filmmaker even deprecates his own arrogance by setting up a
character who can probably be taken for his stand-in.</P>
<P>   This slow-moving, deadly serious morality tale which in a
stretch could remind theater-lovers of a Christian parable,
"The Road to Damascus," has been filmed on location in the
Kurdistani village of Siah Dareh, built into a mountain 450
miles from Tehran and about 450 years from modern
technological civilization.  A man known simply as "The
Engineer" (as though this were a German expressionist
drama) is traveling with a crew of two by Land Rover to this
remote area presumably to look for treasure, or at least that's
the impression he gives to the villagers.  His squad is never
shown, allowing photographer Mahmoud Kalari to focus our
attention quite strictly on the Engineer, particularly on his
ambiguities and complexities.  A tall, lean fellow dressed
informally in blue jeans, a plaid shirt, and fashionable
eyeglasses, he is welcomed by the villagers almost as though
he were the Ayatollah himself, despite their lack of
information on his mission--which is, actually, not to look for
treasure but to record an ancient ritual set to take place when
an old woman dies.  Unbenownst to the locale, he is looking
out for his own career in Tehran (though we're not clear how
the photos he takes of a funeral procession can be so
important to his employers).  Despite his self-absorption, he
seems also to have a genuine interest in the townspeople,
and regularly pumps a young schoolboy, Farzad, for
information.</P>
<P>   The film is as spare and as studied as previous works of
Kiarostami, such as his best-known "A Taste of Cherry,"
about a man contemplating suicide.  The audience gets a
good look at the women of the village, most of whom are old,
with one in particular who has no problem shooting her mouth
off when an auto's fumes are polluting her tea salon while
another, have just given birth to her tenth child, is back at
work on the farm one day later.  </P>
<P>    The village, ostensibly not atypical of the areas in which
many Iranians live and eke out a living, is backward both
physically and politically.  The cell phone brought into the
town by the engineer might just be the first such contraption
of its kind ever seen by the people--who may be alien to the
concept of telephones altogether.  Politically, the government
seems to have buried the burg in its medieval ways,
symbolized plainly and literally by a man who is digging a
hole to set up telecommunications (or so he says) but who, in
an accident is buried alive and rescued just in time, taken to
a hospital for an administration of oxygen--which in
Kiarostami's allegory is what the whole country needs to
sweep away the dominance of fundamentalism. Even the
young girlfriend of the digger, from whom the Engineer
mooches a jug of milk taken directly from her cow, is living in
a cave not unlike the cavity described by Plato--a residence
devoid of love, beauty and truth.  As for the central character
played by Behzad Dourani, the filmmaker leaves one loose
end untied.  While the Engineer may choose to be of more
service to the villagers than he had been so far, he also
unethically takes pictures of the funeral procession despite
the feeling of the townspeople that photographs are a
violation of privacy and respect for the dead.    </P>
<P>   "The Wind Will Carry Us" is loaded with metaphoric
baggage, a somber, heavy, piece slow to the point of
ponderousness.  The film moves along like the turtle spotted
by the Engineer moving along at its own pace, kicked gently
on its back only to right itself up and continue its daily journey
to nowhere because any sort of life is preferable to death. 
This is a film not simply for an audience of foreign-film
enthusiasts but for a highly specialized cadre of buffs who will
appreciate the work as an effective antidote to the current
crop of MTV-ish, special effects action-adventure creations
that dominate the American screen.  </P>
