<P>STARRING:  Antonio Banderas, Diane Venora, Omar Sharif, Vladimir Kulich
DIRECTOR:  John McTiernan, Michael Crichton
WRITTEN BY:  William Wisher, Michael Crichton (based on Crichton's
"Eaters of the Dead")</P>
<P>At last, the long wait to bring this adaptation of Crichton's 1976 novel
(an interesting blend of an actual manuscript and the epic
poem "Beowulf") is over, giving audiences nationwide a chance to see...
a moderately entertaining, fairly by-the-numbers
Hollywood action film that lacks the scope and significance to make it
really click.</P>
<P>Banderas plays Ahmad Ibn-Fahdlan, a 10th-century Arab emissary who fools
around with the wrong woman and ends up
essentially banished to the North, where he meets a rowdy group of
Vikings.  After word is received that a village in the
Vikings' homeland is being threatened, he is chosen in typical
Hollywood-cliché fashion to accompany twelve Norsemen who
will investigate the situation.  During the journey, Ibn (as he is
dubbed by the Vikings) quickly learns their language in typical
Hollywood-cliché fashion.  When they arrive, they find partially eaten
bodies (which Banderas helpfully informs us have been
"gnawed upon") and a distinct lack of men.  That evening, they are
attacked by a group of Wendels (rhymes with Grendel, get
it?), mysterious creatures who just as quickly vanish, carting away
their own dead (along with the heads of a couple of Vikings
for good measure).  Soon enough, they are beset by a horde of Wendels,
which appear to be a hybrid of human and bear.
Barely holding out after the second night, they consult a local oracle
(an old, gap-toothed, Hollywood-cliché hag that talks like
a Scandinavian Yoda) to determine a way to counterattack the Wendels.
The rest of the film deals with their covert raid on the
Wendels' lair, and the resulting final battle for the village before
reaching its resolution just shy of the two-hour mark.</P>
<P>Watching this film, one gets the feeling that McTiernan was too busy
this summer with his remake of "The Thomas Crown
Affair" and the upcoming "Airframe" (also with Crichton) to give "The
13th Warrior" his full attention.  Instead, he seems content to cobble
together a few hoary-but-useful Hollywood clichés, throw in some
recycled scenes from his own "Predator", and let Crichton's and
Banderas' reputations do the rest.  Banderas, in fact, is his usual
charismatic self, but he's at his most appealing when acting with women,
and this film gives him very little opportunity (not that this is a bad
thing; McTiernan and Crichton are to be credited with paying only lip
service to the love-interest aspect of the plot, which didn't need to be
any larger).  The film's major flaw is a glaring lack of
characterization of the Vikings, who have to be summarized with little
descriptions like "The Superstitious" during the end credits just so the
audience will remember who they were!  The actors are all suitably
craggy and bearded, but that's not enough.  The exception to this rule
is the extremely well-cast Kulich ("Firestorm") as Buliwyf, the group's
newly crowned King.  With his size and Nordic features (especially a
mane of blond hair that makes him look like the Marvel Comics version
of  Thor), he is completely believable as the strongest and most capable
warrior of the bunch.  Still, more time could have been spent developing
these characters, even at the expense of some of the battle sequences.
Speaking of which, they are some of the film's better moments, despite
their obvious debt to "Braveheart"'s skirmishes (which already seem in
danger of becoming a Hollywood cliché).  The two films also share some
great cinematography; British Columbia fills in for the fjords, and
provides some striking coastal vistas and misty forest settings.
Unfortunately, "The 13th Warrior" lacks the epic scale and sense of
historical importance that distinguished Mel Gibson's masterpiece.
Combined with the lack of character development and the weight of all
those Hollywood clichés, it ends up feeling like a Reader's Digest
condensation of the book.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, it is well paced, the costume design is noteworthy, and the
"Beowulf" references sprinkled here and there (like
Buliwyf's line about luck resulting from courage) are a nice touch.
Action fans likely won't be disappointed.</P>
