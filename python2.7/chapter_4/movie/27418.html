JUST MESSING AROUND
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>A 32-year-old painter, Edward (Tonio Arango), is JUST MESSING AROUND.  
He never finishes a painting, preferring instead to continually paint 
over his works.  A consummate dilettante, he's never quite satisfied 
with anything.</P>
<P>This constant recycling of art works is turned into a form of 
storytelling by the filmmaker.  Edward likes to paint life as he 
imagines and feels it.  When his beautiful model, Hanna (Alexandra Maria 
Lara), keeps making unwanted overtures towards him -- he doesn't date 
people from work -- he envisions her 4 inches tall, smothering his face 
in a grip like a creature from ALIENS.  The movie shows us his 
successive painting variations in stop-action animation which gives his 
images a certain life of their own.  I must admit that I kept wishing 
that he was a more interesting artist since we have to see so much of 
his work.</P>
<P>The problem with movie, written and directed by Jochen Kuhn, is that, 
much like Edward's pictures, Kuhn never finishes anything.  Everything 
is surface gloss, and none of the characters are ever defined well 
enough to care about.</P>
<P>Edward doesn't need to sell his works because he has a benefactor, Poser 
(Maximilian Schell), a wealthy art dealer and the Minister of Art.  
Schell doesn't lend much to the movie other than the marquee value of 
his name.  His performance is as just as weak as the other actors.  
Poser, who has a definite position of power in the art world, boasts, 
"If I tell people it's good, they agree."  He derives his income from 
secretly commissioned forgeries of great paintings, which he auctions 
off as the real McCoys.  "I help to ease the cultural inferiority of the 
wealthy," he brags.  "Everyone gets the fake they need."</P>
<P>Much is made of the silliness of what passes for art.  One "artist" 
sells 4 plastic pots holding plastic tulips.  Another "artist" uses 
toilet paper, teddy bears and garden gnomes in her works, which are 
quickly snapped up as wise financial investments.</P>
<P>Most of the movie, however, consists of Edward's trying to figure out 
what he wants to do with his life.  Although it seems to take forever, 
his indecision does finally get resolved in a cute way that would work 
great in a brief epilogue.  Instead, it is drawn out into a long last 
act, thereby destroying almost all of its impact.  This is a movie that 
is definitely JUST MESSING AROUND.</P>
<P>JUST MESSING AROUND (FISIMATENTEN) runs a long 1:37.  The film is in 
German with English subtitles.  It is not rated by the MPAA but would be 
an R for nudity and some language.  It would be fine for most teenagers.</P>
