<P>REVIEWER'S NOTE: For those of you who are paying attention, yes, I had already
written a review of FARGO some time ago. I recently saw the film again, and
while this isn't the first time I have changed my mind about a film after
another viewing, this is the first time that I felt like I had cheated a
four-star masterpiece out of its rating. See below for explanation. </P>
<PRE>Film review by Kevin Patterson</PRE>
<PRE>FARGO
Rating: **** (out of four)
R, 1996
Directed by Joel Coen. Written by Joel and Ethan Coen.
Starring Frances McDormand, William Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare.</PRE>
<P>As the Coen Brothers' FARGO begins, shifty Minneapolis car salesman Jerry
Lundegaard (William Macy) drives down a snow-bound road to a bar in Fargo,
North Dakota, where he meets two thugs-for-hire, Carl Showalter (Steve
Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare). He has a rather unique
proposition for them; they are to kidnap his wife and demand $80,000 in ransom
from her wealthy father, then split the ransom money with Jerry. What is
instantly clear, however, is that, as well as being generally unsavory types,
Showalter and Grimsrud are dumber than a box of rocks and probably should not
be trusted with Jerry's laundry, much less his wife. Between that and the fact
that FARGO is the latest from Joel and Ethan Coen, who brought us BLOOD SIMPLE
and RAISING ARIZONA, among others, it's a pretty safe bet from then on that
things are going to go haywire. Pretty soon, the very pregnant Sheriff Marge
Gunderson (Frances McDormand) of Brainerd, Minnesota is being called in to
investigate a triple homicide on an isolated highway and Jerry's
scatter-brained scheme is going hopelessly awry.</P>
<P>FARGO is far from the typical crime/suspense thriller. It is "about" this
kidnapping scheme, but it is about a lot of other things too. It is about
Northern accents and expressions like "you betcha." It is about ice on the
windshield and large quantities of snow. Most importantly, it is about how a
laid-back community of Northern Midwesterners come face-to-face with
cold-blooded evil in the persons of Showalter and Grimsrud, and how they deal
with it in their typically laid-back, golly-gee-whiz (or in this case, "oh
yah, yer darn-tootin'!"), easy-going way. McDormand herself has described it
as "miles and miles of pure white snow, splattered with red blood." </P>
<P>Stylistically, FARGO occupies a middle ground between BLOOD SIMPLE and RAISING
ARIZONA: it has both the disturbing violence of the former and the wacky humor
of the latter. Sometimes it even has both at once, such as when Jerry finds a
piece of Showalter's handywork in the form of a dead parking lot clerk and
mutters, "Oh jeez" with all the animation of someone who just stubbed his toe.
The kidnapping scene itself is a similar mix; Mrs. Lundegard and Showalter
stare curiously at each other through the window for a good thirty seconds
before the two thugs break in, and later, when she bites Grimsrud's hand in
attempt to escape, he goes upstairs to clean himself up in the family's
bathroom, leaving Showalter to chase her. The Coens do not make the mistake of
laughing off the violence entirely, however; the scene in which Grimsrud hunts
down two witnesses and kills them execution-style, for example, is unabatedly
vicious and brutal.</P>
<P>FARGO is sometimes black-comic and sometimes just plain black, but there is
plenty of good-natured humor as well, most of it deriving from the quirks of
the local culture and the charm of McDormand's character. "Oh, for Pete's
sake, he's fleein' the interview!" she exclaims at one point when a suspect
eludes her during an interrogation. Not only is she instantly likeable and
intelligent, she is also remarkably hardy and persistent for a woman seven
months pregnant. When she arrives at the initial crime scene, for example,
beset with morning sickness, she excuses herself momentarily to vomit, then
returns and promptly gets back to her job. The locals, meanwhile, are featured
in several scenes in which witnesses call the police with long-winded, banal
stories but can only describe Showalter as "a little fella, kinda
funny-lookin'." The interaction between Showalter and Grimsrud is also quite
amusing at times, such as when Showalter, frustrated by Grimsrud's lack of
interest in coversation, delivers a thoroughly un-silent monologue about how
"two can play at that game, buddy," and how he is going to be completely
[bleeping] silent.</P>
<P>What the Coens have created in FARGO is not only an interesting, off-beat
slice of culture but also an examination of the moral conflicts underlying the
characters' behavior. It's almost like the flip-side to David Lynch's BLUE
VELVET: in both films, innocent, clean-cut protagonists from a seemingly
peaceful small town stumbles into a shockingly violent crime scenario that
reveals ugly secrets hidden underneath their heretofore laid-back existence.
But while Lynch's protagonist found himself unable to deal with the evil and
perversity that he discovered without first dealing with his own "dark side,"
Marge Gunderson emerges untainted. She investigates the crimes with notable
intelligence and stands her moral ground, as she confronts the criminals'
selfishness head-on, allowing herself to feel disgust and even bewilderment,
but never letting it shake her long-held perceptions of herself and of what's
right and wrong. </P>
<P>The Coens have, throughout their filmmaking career, returned periodically to
the theme of an Ordinary Joe who perseveres even when confronted by nutcases
and two-timing jerks. FARGO isn't quite their best film (that honor still goes
to BARTON FINK, their 1991 surreal psychodrama that sent up artistic
pretension and Hollywood commercialism) but at the very least, Marge Gunderson
turns out to be an Ordinary Josephine who almost certainly outclasses all the
Coens' previous Ordinary Joes (which is not an easy act to follow). Poignant,
intelligent, and occasionally hilarious, FARGO is a fine example of filmmaking
that no one should miss. </P>
<PRE>- - Why I re-wrote this review - - </PRE>
<P>For one thing, I don't think I fully grasped the moral conflicts that I
discussed in the second-to-last paragraph above when I first reviewed the
film: at the time, I saw FARGO as mostly just an off-beat examination of the
local culture within the framework of a crime thriller. Also, I criticized the
film on two grounds which, in retrospect, were mostly irrelevant. The dangling
plot thread of which I spoke was incidental at best, and returning to it at
the end would almost certainly have disrupted the narrative flow. As for the
criminals taking too long to get things moving, there does seem to be a slight
amount of sloppiness - they seem to take half the day driving from the Twin
Cities to Brainerd, when in reality it's only a few hours - but again, this is
at most a minor flaw and not a serious detraction from the film's overall effectiveness.</P>
