<P>"My Son The Fanatic", the latest from director Udayan Prasad, is an
occasionally comedic drama that tackles an important subject, but does
so incoherently. Om Puri gives an exceptional performance as Parvez, a
Pakistani cab driver in Northern England whose son has just called off
his wedding to an Englishwoman because of his budding Islam
Fundamentalist beliefs. Parvez, who recieves most of his business by
driving around prostitutes(most notably Bettina, played by Rachel
Griffiths), puts up his argument for British conformity against his
son's Muslim idealism. The interesting thing about "My Son The
Fanatic" is that both arguments are convincing. But while the film's
conflict is a relevant one, the film itself is poorly wrought.
Despite a few powerful scenes, "My Son The Fanatic" is largely dull
and uninviting. The elements of comedy that are worked it seemed
forced and unnecessary, since the theme of the film is decidedly
downbeat.  Director Udayan Prasad has decided to forget about style
and structure and let the actors do their work. Om Puri brings a lot
of emotion to his role as the torn father; while bit players Rachel
Griffiths and Stellan Skarsgard seem merely competent in his
presence. "My Son The Fanatic" presents many moral questions, and in a
better-made film, they would have been answered.</P>
