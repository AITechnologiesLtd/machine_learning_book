<P>     This Sunday afternoon I had the priviledge of
attending a private screening at the Sony Astor Cinema
in New York City, of James Cameron's most heralded
film, TITANIC.</P>
<P>      Postponed from last Summer, with an escalated
budget that makes it the most expensive movie in
history, this was one film I was eager to preview.</P>
<P>     So, is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday?
My best guess....it will sink, though with many awards
attatched to its hull.</P>
<P>      No doubt, TITANIC is the most elaborate disaster
movie ever made.  It boasts the most amazing effects that
I have ever seen done to date.  To see a ship fall apart,
with actual people running across the ship, flying across
the deck, and falling to the water, is just amazing to look at.
The effects are so stunningly realistic, you would swear you
were looking at actual footage.</P>
<P>      But TITANIC is more than a disaster movie, and that's
where the problem lies.  There is a love story attatched that
nearly ruins the entire premise.</P>
<P>      I'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling
anything for you:</P>
<P>      The film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts
of the sunken Titanic.  We see actual footage of the sunken
ship, as Cammeron had set up special cameras to film the
wreckage on the ocean floor.</P>
<P>     Bill Paxton leads the expedition, in search of sunken treasure.</P>
<P>What he finds instead, leads him to a mysterious old woman
who recounts her tale of the Titanic voyage.</P>
<P>      We meet Rose (Kate Winslet), a young woman,  who comes
from an upper-class family.  Rose is to be wed to a man she
does not love.</P>
<P>       We meet Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young man, who
comes from a poor financial background, and wins a ticket aboard
the Titanic, in a poker game.</P>
<P>       The two meet under interesting circumstances, and the
love story begins.  Add in a jealous fiance, and a not-so-nice
law officer played by David Warner, and you have a story that,
well, gets a bit overplayed and oversappy.</P>
<P>       I must add, at this point, that the most likeable character
in the movie is played by Kathy Bates, as a woman with
"new money" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk
on the ship.  She is a pleasure to see on screen.</P>
<P>       When the ship does hit the Iceberg at exactly 1:40 into
the film, and eventually sinks, you never really feel for any of
these characters.  The film is just loaded with unlikeable rich
snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on.</P>
<P>       The effects are tremendous.  From the roars of gears and
pumps in the engine room, to a doomed ship cracking at the
seams, this is an effects picture that looks and sounds
like no other.</P>
<P>       We saw TITANIC in Dolby Digital surround, and by far, it
is the best sounding movie I have ever seen.  My friend
commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard.
When people are in the water, at film's end, you are surrounded
by the voices of lost soles.</P>
<P>       TITANIC runs far too long.  The movie is 3 hours and 15
minutes in length.    And, while most of the first 2.5 hours runs
very fast and well-paced, the final 45 minutes almost comes to
a sudden stop, and you realize that this sappy love story has to
finish itself out before the movie finally ends.</P>
<P>       Don't get me wrong about TITANIC....it's not a bad as I
am making it out to be.  It really is an exceptionaly well-made
film.  The costumes and sets are incredible, and true to the time
period.  The ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form,
as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage, transformed
into the movie depiction.  This film will certainly win on effects,
costume, set design and sound.  Cameron has certainly made his best
film to date.</P>
<P>      Unfortunately, Titanic is not a Best Picture candidate.  It
just doesn't have a strong supporting story.  It's an exceptional
disaster film with sappy filler inside.  It just doesn't have the
emotional impact that I suspect Mr. Cameron was shooting for.</P>
<P>       I predict that Titanic will open to likeable reviews.  It is
a film worth seeing.  I predict that it will only do moderately well
at the Box Office.  With its extreme running time, and lack of
enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth, I expect that it
will do even better on Home Video.  This will certainly be the
definitive AC3 movie for all you Home Theater enthusiasts.</P>
<P>      Titanic opens December 19th, and is released by Paramount
Pictures and Twentieth Century-Fox.</P>
<PRE>       I give TITANIC 3 stars (***) out of 4.  That's not bad.</PRE>
