<P>        First time Writer/Director Julian Schnabel uses film as his
canvas to paint the portrait of Jean Michel Basquiat. JMB (played
elegantly by Jeffrey Wright) is an enigmatic individual who is never
fully explained. Coming from a fairly stable and supportive home-life we
never truly know why Basquiat decides to spend his nights in a cardboard
box at the films opening. A struggling "vandalistic" artist, Basquiat
moves through the streets with an uncaring and self-destructive
attitude. He fends for his daily meals by scrounging what he can and
ultimately stops wherever he feels like it to use any materials he has
on hand to express his feelings on walls, signs, and delicatessen
tables. Basquiat travels, much like Schnabel's camera work, aimlessly
from encounter to encounter sprawling his eclectic prose across
buildings and alleys as he goes. After impressing a small time waitress
by painting her portrait in syrup on the restaurant table, Basquiat
starts a relationship with the beautiful Gina Cardinale (played by Clair
Forlani).  Gina, herself, wants to be an artist and her works are
scattered throughout her meager apartment. Basquiat, who is so lost in
his own quest to alter all that is out of place, wakes up early one
morning to scribble all over her art and paint across one of her nicer
dresses. It is this kind of attitude that follows Basquiat throughout
the entire movie. He only answers to himself and fails to compromise his
integrity, or at least what he mistakes as such, by lashing out against
anyone and anything that doesn't see his vision. David Bowie does an
incredible job portraying Andy Warhol, the most notorious of "pop"
artists. In an early scene Basquiat interrupts a lunch Warhol is having
with his agent, Bruno Bischofberger (Dennis Hopper) to try and pawn off
some of his post-card size scribblings at ten bucks a pop. It is evident
that Basquiat is only motivated by his own means and when his works
begin to gain notoriety, the fame never really changes him. His attitude
is unwavering and he is completely unconcerned with who he angers,
antagonizes, lies to or dicks over along the way. The only thing that
his growing fame and increasing income affords him is the ability to
paint more and to take even more drugs. One of the biggest debates we
had after the movie was whether or not John Michel Basquiat (based on
the workds portrayed in the film) was actually artistic or simply a scam
artist. I believe he was an extremely talented individual who lived on a
higher plain than most other artists. In a scene where Christopher
Walken was interviewing him on his new found success and meaning of his
works, Basquiat was able to show us a little of how he thinks when he
draws. To me this served to show that his talent was out of the normal
scope of what most consider "art", which is what made his paintings so
remarkable. John Michel Basquiat was not a nice person, nor someone who
had any real feelings for anyone other than himself and his mother. He
did, however,  develop an interesting relationship with Andy Warhol, but
even that was a peculiar one. Basquiat's relationship with his mother
was never really revealed though we know that she was locked away in a
mental institution and that he made regular visits to see her. He even
attempted to rescue her from that place late in the film but was so
destructive to himself and out of control by then that he never managed
to help her. BASQUIAT is an incredible journey through the underground
art world and showcases an all star cast. Decidedly depressing and
visually out of sync, BASQUIAT triggers many emotions and succeeds in
all of it's endeavors to let us follow the obusive actions of a man
whose visions are only known to himself.  4 spots (out of 4)</P>
<P>Favorite Line: Andy Warhol - "I can't tell what's good anymore."</P>
